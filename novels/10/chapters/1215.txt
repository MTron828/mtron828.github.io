The astonishment in the eyes of all Nefarious Devil Tribe experts was gradually replaced by suspicion and disbelief.

‘Are they seeing ghosts in the daylight?’ A bunch of their old Ancestors were resurrected, wasn’t this seeing ghosts in daylight?!

“Honored Old Ancestors must have known that the Demon-Buddha Clan wants to annihilate our tribe, that’s why they all came to life again!” One of the settlements’ Head muttered dreamily.

“This is a Heaven’s blessing for our Nefarious Devil Tribe ah!” Suddenly, a settlement Head knelt on the ground, crying tears of joy.

He had thought that the annihilation of Nefarious Devil Tribe was certain, but who’d have thought that the wind of change would blow— their ancestors had risen from their tombs and had come back to life. This was akin to a ray of hope brightening their hellish nightmare.

Then again, Xie Sheng, Xie Xiao, and many others were doubtful. The four Ancestors were feeling incredulous and astonished at the same time.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the Nefarious Devil Tribe’s Ancestral Hall.

“It’s, it’s Great Patriarch Xie Li?!” One of the four Ancestors exclaimed loudly while staring fixedly at Xie Li who was standing behind Huang Xiaolong as he considered this possibility.

The other three Nefarious Devil Tribe Ancestors, as well as Xie Sheng, Xie Xiao, Xie Luoxing, and Xie Xiao trembled hearing Xie Li’s name.

Great Patriarch Xie Li!

Over a million years ago, the Nefarious Devil Tribe was a united tribe. All of the settlements had one common Head, who was under the governance of the Great Patriarch.

Xie Sheng, Xie Shan, and others distinctly remembered all of the past generations of the Great Patriarch that their tribe have had for the last tens of millions of years.

“You are right, I am Xie Li!”Xie Li said to Xie Sheng, Xie Shan, and others while standing behind Huang Xiaolong, after receiving his instruction to do so.

The four Nefarious Devil Ancestors shook, so did Xie Sheng, Xie Shan, and everyone else.

“You, you are Great Patriarch Xie Li; for real?!” One of the Nefarious Devil Tribe Ancestors suppressed the waves of shock in his heart as he asked Xie Li disbelief.

“I, Xie Li, was born with Nether Soul Nefarious Physique. I broke through a God Realm at fifteen years of age, a Heavenly God Realm at forty, and an Ancient God Realm at one hundred and fifty!”Xie Li stated solemnly, “After cultivating for less than five hundred years, I achieved Tenth Order Ancient Highgod Realm. If it wasn’t for my accidental death when I was a late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, I’d have stepped into Ancestor God Realm before my bone-age would have reached eight hundred years!”

Listening to Xie Li’s words, the four Nefarious Devil Ancestors trembled hard with excitement.

That’s right!

According to old Nefarious Devil Tribe records, Great Patriarch Xie Li was indeed born with the Nether Soul Nefarious Physique, hence he had an outstanding talent. He had broken through to God Realm at fifteen, a Heavenly God Realm at forty, and Ancient God Realm at one hundred and fifty years of his age!

If it wasn’t for his accidental death at that time, Xie Li would have been an Ancestor God Realm master! Moreover, the Nefarious Devil Tribe’s youngest Ancestor God Realm master!

At the time of the Great Patriarch Xie Li’s death, his cultivation realm was already at late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

All of these secrets were recorded in Nefarious Devil Tribe’s old records. No one else could possibly know so many details about Xie Li. Not to mention, Xie Li and the other thirty-three Nefarious Devil experts had the genuine Nefarious Devil’s innate physique. the nefarious qi exuding from their nefarious bones was also genuine. It was impossible that they were imposters..

They were really the Nefarious Devil Tribe’s Old Ancestors!

The more of this truth sunk into them, the more excited the Nefarious Devil Tribe became.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong’s high-level Grandmist Puppetry Technique played a big part in these Nefarious Devil puppets. Puppets refined through this technique have a strong vitality, to the extent that there is no noticeable difference between them and the living people. Due to this, the Nefarious Devil Tribe did not suspect otherwise.

“Great Patriarch Xie Li!” Finally, one of the Nefarious Devil Tribe Ancestors knelt on his knees in salute.

“Greeting Great Patriarch Xie Li!” The other three Nefarious Devil Tribe Ancestors followed suit.

Seeing the four Ancestors’ action, Xie Sheng, Xie Shan, and the other settlement Heads also knelt on their knees.

“All of you, get up!” Xie Li ordered.

All of the Nefarious Devil Tribe experts acknowledged respectfully before rising to their feet.

After Xie Li, all of the other refined Nefarious Devil puppets came out and stated their past identities and details as a proof.

“Greetings Ancestor Xie Xuan!”

“Greetings Ancestor Xie Ying!”

Voices of Nefarious Devil Tribe experts echoed in the air for a long time.

When Nefarious Devil Tribe experts had finished greeting all of the thirty-four Nefarious Devils— Old Ancestors, Xie Li spoke again, “We know you all have doubts in your heart. In truth, all of us were resurrected from the ancestral burial ground with supreme chaos level technique by the Master!” Xie Li respectfully indicated at Huang Xiaolong.

Predictably, all Nefarious Devil Tribe experts were shocked and turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. ‘This black-haired young man used supreme chaos level technique to resurrect Ancestor Xie Li and other Old Ancestors!’

Master?!

“All younger generations of Nefarious Devil Tribe, hear my words! In the future, he is our Master!” Xie Li’s sonorous voice boomed. “Master will surely lead our Nefarious Devil Tribe back to its original glory as in the ancient times! Any Nefarious Devil dissentients who prove to be disloyal to the Master, will be punished as Nefarious Devil Tribe’s betrayers!”

Xie Li’s voice rumbled in the sky, traveling far into the distance. The nefarious qi from his body rose to a peak, covering all four directions of the Ancestral Hall ground. No one dared to utter a sound of objection, there was only a heavy silence.

“Greetings Master!” A breath after, Xie Li turned to Huang Xiaolong, respectfully kneeling in salute. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Greetings Master!” Xie Xuan, Xie Ying and other Nefarious Devil puppets refined by Huang Xiaolong knelt down in salute, their voices thundered in the air.

Yet hesitation lingered on the four Nefarious Devil Tribe Ancestors and experts’ faces. Accept a human as their Master?

This...!

“Insolent! On your knees quickly and greet the Master!” Xie Li looked over his shoulder and snapped at the four Nefarious Devil Tribe Ancestors.

The four Ancestors’ hearts jumped in fright.

“Greetings Master!” At last, the four Ancestors went down on their knees in salute.

Since this young man— even though he was a human, had resurrected Nefarious Devil Tribe’s Old Ancestors, as well as, these Old Ancestors had also acknowledged him as their Master; the only right thing they could do was to follow him.

Xie Shan, Xie Sheng, Xie Luoxing, Xie Xiao, and other settlements’ Heads also knelt down, greeting Master Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction as the experts of Nefarious Devil Tribe knelt before him. Conquering the Nefarious Devil Tribe had been far smoother than Huang Xiaolong imagined. Though, if it wasn’t for his success in refining Xie Li and others into his puppets, he’d have faced great resistance from the Nefarious Devil Tribe.

After all, ancient races such as the Nefarious Tribe has their inherent notions. For one, they couldn’t acknowledge a human as their Master.

Huang Xiaolong flew into the Ancestral Hall on the little cow. Xie Li and the thirty-three Nefarious Devils puppets followed behind. The others were then permitted to get up.

After everyone stood up, they too headed inside the Ancestral Hall.They invited Huang Xiaolong, Xie Li and other Old Ancestor puppets to sit down. But on the other hand, the four Ancestors and the group of settlement Heads did not dare to sit down; they simply continued standing, straight as a rod, inside the great hall.

Huang Xiaolong spoke first. He inquired the settlement Heads about the reason for being assembled at the Ancestral Hall. The Evil Heart Settlement Head Xie Sheng hurried forward and answered Huang Xiaolong’s question respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong was bewildered for a second. He then laughed loudly when Xie Sheng told him that the Demon-Buddha Clan and Ouyang Family were soon going to attack the Nefarious Devil Island.. Ouyang Family! Ouyang Family!

The little cow too snickered at his side. “Looks like we don’t need to make a trip to Ouyang Family, right?”

“Are Ouyang Bin and Ouyang Xuguang heading here?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“From what I’ve heard, only Ouyang Clan Ancestor Ouyang Bin is coming.” Xie Sheng answered.

‘Only Ouyang Bin?’ Huang Xiaolong nodded. It didn’t make much difference to Huang Xiaolong, if he killed Ouyang Xuguang after he had killed Ouyang Bin.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently asked some questions related to the Demon-Buddha Clan and Ouyang Family’s recent movements. He then had Xie Sheng prepare for war!

...

On the other hand, Ouyang Family Ancestor Ouyang Bin, as well as Ouyang Family’s several Grand Elders— Ouyang Xun,Ouyang Jiang and others; were currently sitting in the great hall of Demon-Buddha Clan’s headquarters planning their attacks on the Nefarious Devil Tribe.
