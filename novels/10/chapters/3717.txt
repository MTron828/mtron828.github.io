Chapter 3718: A Fourteenth Universe Treasure?

As he made his way towards the White Deer Cave, he sent Pangu to somewhere safe. After all, Pangu’s presence would make challenging the White Feather King much more difficult.

When he sent Pangu to a safe spot, he asked his master to return to the World of Departed Souls in the Blazing Dragon World. He also told him to remain there in case the Universe First Race came looking for slaves again. If Pangu traveled the world like he used to, he might be captured and sent back.

The White Deer Cave was extremely distant. Even with the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong took an entire year to arrive.

He was shocked to discover that there were plenty of experts charging towards the White Deer Cave. Most of them were experts from hidden ancient races.

Their races were mostly born along with the Thirteen Universes, and they were created slightly later than the Universe First Race at best.

All of them had remained in hiding all this whole. Even when Huang Xiaolong toured the universes, he failed to locate their presence. He only learned of them when he spoke to the Dragon Overlord and the others in the Unknown Space.

In the past, the Universe First Race called upon the first Extermination Tribulation. The Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen weren’t the only ones who managed to survive. There were several hidden experts who managed to live.

The old ancestors of the races were those who had broken through the 20 billion mark!

In the past, the Ferocious Devil said that he was afraid of two supreme existences in the Thirteen Universes before it was destroyed for the first time. One of them was the Black Nether King, but the second wasn’t the White Feather King! The White Feather King might be as strong as him, but he wouldn’t be afraid of someone he could challenge one-on-one!

The other person was the Old Man Fortune!

He was the old ancestor of the Fortune Race, and he outclassed even the Ferocious Devil! He might not be as strong as the Black Nether King, but he was an existence who could beat the Ferocious Devil anytime he wished!

The Ferocious Devil’s combat strength neared the 29.9 billion mark, and Old Man Fortune was above him! One could say that other than the Black Nether King, he was the only other person closest to the Universe God Realm!

Huang Xiaolong slowly approached the White Deer Cave despite his shock.

“Fellow Cultivator, did something happen in the White Deer Cave to draw over too many experts from the hidden races?” Huang Xiaolong asked someone in his way.

Huang Xiaolong could recognize the other party as an expert from the Yang Lightning Race due to the energy fluctuations around his body.

Like the Fortune Race, the Yang Lightning Race was one of the earliest races to exist in the Thirteen Universes.

When the person he addressed turned around to look at him, he was shocked to discover that he couldn’t feel Huang Xiaolong’s aura.

“Didn’t you hear? An absolute treasure was born in the White Deer Cave! It’s said that a universe treasure was born there.”

“Universe treasure?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped. “Aren’t there only thirteen universe treasures?”

“Since the creation of the Thirteen Universes, there have only been thirteen universe treasures. However, no one can say for certain that another universe treasure will never be born!”

“I heard that the fourteenth universe treasure has appeared in the White Deer Cave!”

However, he shook his head slowly and sighed, “Perhaps it’s just a rumor. I personally do not believe that the fourteenth universe treasure is about to be born.”

Even so, he wished to satisfy his curiosity.

Naturally, greed had a part to play in it.

Those who came to the White Deer Cave didn’t do so because they were merely curious.

Everyone would want to obtain a universe treasure for themselves.

After thinking about it for some time, Huang Xiaolong made a bold guess. There might not be a fourteenth universe treasure, but they might be talking about the Universe Source Stone.

After all, it was quite impossible for another universe treasure to spawn. If there really was a chance for the fourteenth universe treasure to appear, it would have done so countless years ago.

“I am the ancient ancestor of the Yang Lightning Race, Yang Dingsheng. May I know who you are?” The expert cupped his fists and asked.

For races that were as ancient as theirs, there was another rank for experts of their race. Instead of calling them doyens, they were called ancient ancestors.

Their strength was nothing to scoff at. From what Huang Xiaolong could see, Yang Dingsheng was comparable to Wu Xin, the Limitless Master of the Unknown Space.

“I am Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to hide his identity.

Visible shock flashed across Yang Dingsheng’s face. “You… You’re the owner of the Blue Dragon Manor, Huang Xiaolong?!”

Huang Xiaolong’s feat of crushing the various alliances and the Creation Palace in the First Universe had long since spread through the universes. He established the Blue Dragon Manor after, solidifying his position as the strongest in the lands! As such, his name reached the ears of many hidden races.

“That’s me. The Blue Dragon Manor is only a small existence in the universe. I can’t compare to fellow cultivator’s Yang Lightning Race…”

Yang Dingsheng chuckled, “You’re too humble.”

Even though there were countless experts in the First Universe, Huang Xiaolong was the only one who managed to cross the 10 billion units mark. As such, none of the ancient ancestors could be bothered with him. To them, he was merely an ant.

According to their investigation, Huang Xiaolong would accumulate 15 billion units of grand cosmos energy at best.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong entered the White Deer Cave with Yang Dingsheng.

As soon as they entered, darkness enveloped the lands. However, the darkness was nothing to experts at their level.

The White Deer Cave wasn’t as barren as everyone thought. It was filled with signs of life and it slightly resembled the Universe Vault. The only difference was the feeling it gave off. The White Deer Cave seemed extremely bleak.

As the two of them flew, they chatted with each other. The two of them hit it off immediately and they seemed like old friends after half a day of traveling together.

“There’s no need for me to hide this from you. I’m not just here for the rumored universe treasure. I’m here for something else,” Yang Dingsheng sighed and said.

Even though it had only been half a day, the two of them were calling each other brothers.

“Oh? What is Brother Dingsheng looking for?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“I’m looking for the White Deer!”

“White Deer?!”

The reason behind the name of the White Deer Cave was because of the legendary White Deer that lived in it. It was said to be born with the Rebirth Bloodline and it was created from the purest form of energy from the universes!

Its bloodline had the ability to regenerate any wound one might suffer!Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

However, the number of people who had seen the White Deer could probably be counted on one hand.

“That’s right…” Yang Dingsheng sighed.
