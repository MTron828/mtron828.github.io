Chapter 2381: Black Corpse Continent

In the blink of an eye, another year passed.

The space in Huang Xiaolong’s Darkness Holy Ring was getting filled up as the days passed. Even Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected that there would be so many holy herbs and origin spiritual herbs located at the bottom of the bottomless river.

How could they classify it as a holy herb treasure trove? It was obviously a super treasure trove!

Even though it had only been a year, Huang Xiaolong had already located more than four hundred stalks of holy spiritual herbs! As for the high-grade origin spiritual herbs, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother counting them after a certain amount.

Along the way, he had obtained all the origin treasures he needed to complete his tasks.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t focus fully on collecting the herbs. His strength had already reached the peak of the early-Seventh Order Venerable Realm. With a little inspiration, he would be able to step into the mid-Seventh Order Venerable Realm!

During his search for the herbs, Huang Xiaolong met several profound beasts and he subdued a few of them along the way. Only those who were at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm could catch his eye.

With the terrifying number of profound beasts, Huang Xiaolong was a little pickier when it came to choosing those he wanted. Only those who had great potential and those with the ability to enter the True Saint Realm were chosen.

Even with his shockingly strict criteria, Huang Xiaolong managed to capture around a hundred and ten of them in a single year.

With a hundred and ten Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm profound beasts unleashing the Holy Dao Grand Formation, they would be able to injure ordinary First Heaven True Saint experts!

The only thing that caused Huang Xiaolong’s head to ache was the fact that he had failed to locate the grandmist holy spiritual aura and the holy lake! He had passed through tens of continents, but they were nowhere in sight!

Throughout the year, it went without saying that disciples of the holy grounds he had run across would set their sights on ‘poor little’ Huang Xiaolong.

All of them who dared to challenge him suffered the same fate as Chen Zifeng of the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate. They were completely devoured by Huang Xiaolong. Those who died at his hands weren’t few in number, and they allowed Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes to soar up the rankings.

Without him noticing, his saint attributes ranked in the eighties.

Even though it was only a mere increase of 20 ranks from the time he had left the Holy Heavens City, Huang Xiaolong’s combat abilities had increased by more than twenty percent!

When one’s saint attributes ranked in the hundreds, their strength would increase by a huge amount with a jump in the ranks.

“Young Master, the Black Corpse Continent is located right up ahead.” Chen Zhi, who was following behind Huang Xiaolong, reported respectfully.

After a year of subservience, the fear and respect he held for Huang Xiaolong had reached the limit. Like the Departing Sword Sage, they were terrified of the youngster!

Huang Xiaolong turned his head to stare at a black patch of space. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t see anything beyond the initial screen of darkness. Even with Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul, he felt as though his senses were obstructed from investigating the space.

The Profound River was dangerous, but there were certain spots inside that were forbidden lands several times more dangerous than the other areas in it!

The Black Corpse Continent was one of the deadliest locations in the river!

“Young Master, we should take another route and leave that place alone....” The Departing Sword Sage hesitated for a moment before trying to persuade Huang Xiaolong, “The Black Corpse Continent is extremely dangerous, and it’s not somewhere ordinary True Saint Realm experts would step into. Even if they do, it will be extremely difficult for them to leave! The profound beasts on the continent are really scary!”

Chen Zhi added, “Brother Wu Wo is right. Young Master, we should think of a way to go around it. The corpse devil qi around the continent is able to corrode the bodies of True Saint Realm experts!”

“I’ve heard that there’s a special holy herb growing in the Black Corpse Continent! It’s called the White Boned Dark Lotus!” As soon as he heard the introduction of the continent, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up.

White Boned Dark Lotus! A high-grade holy herb!

It was one of the most famous high-grade holy herbs in the Profound River! It was also one of the rarest herbs in the Holy World. Even with holy bills, one wouldn’t be able to buy a single stalk! If one really wanted to exchange for a single stalk of the White Boned Dark Lotus, they would probably have to take out several hundred stalks of other holy herbs in exchange....

Even though Huang Xiaolong had obtained more than four hundred stalks of holy herbs along the way, none of them could compare to the White Boned Dark Lotus!

A bitter smile formed on Chen Zhi’s face when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “It’s true that there’s a stalk of White Boned Dark Lotus in the Black Corpse Continent.... However, it’s not that easy to find! Even when the three palace masters of the Devil Palace entered the continent, they failed to locate it!”

Normal holy herbs were intelligent enough to hide themselves, making it extremely difficult for anyone to locate them. High-grade holy herbs like the White Boned Dark Lotus were even harder to find! It was easier to ascend to the heavens than to locate herbs like that!

A chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “It’s fine! The palace masters were unable to locate the herb, but that doesn’t mean that I won’t be able to do it! One requires luck to find a stalk of White Boned Dark Lotus!”

Chen Zhi stared at the Departing Sword Sage, and they both revealed a helpless smile.

Whatever the case, they had to admit that Huang Xiaolong’s luck was something that defied the heavens! They had seen it in action in the past year, and they knew that no amount of persuasion was going to stop Huang Xiaolong from entering the Black Corpse Continent.

Looking at the screen of darkness before him, Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a second before retrieving the Winged Dragon Flying Ship.

As soon as it appeared, the flow of energy around it turned sluggish. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Staring at the ship that had appeared before them, Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage widened their eyes in shock. They felt a bolt of lightning running through their bodies, and they stuttered in shock, “This... Is this a high-grade saint artifact?!”

Their reactions were understandable. It wasn’t common for one to see a high-grade saint artifact in the Holy World. There were probably less than ten flying ships at that level!

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and interrupted their chain of thoughts.

The moment everyone entered the ship, the two of them stared at the intricate Holy Dao Grand Formation in the middle of the ship and waves crashed against their heart.

Ignoring the both of them, Huang Xiaolong activated the flying ship and pierced through the black screen. He charged into the space shrouded in darkness.

Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage only managed to snap back to attention after they entered the space around the Black Corpse Continent. A bitter smile formed on their face, and they finally understood the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s confidence.

High-grade holy artifact! The flying ship was a high-grade holy artifact! Throwing Huang Xiaolong’s Darkness Holy Ring into the mix, he would be able to escape as long as they didn’t run into high-level True Saint Realm experts!

Seeing the treasures on Huang Xiaolong, the two of them couldn’t help but suspect his identity.

It was basically impossible for Huang Xiaolong to dig the high-grade holy flying ship out from some random treasury... Right?!

The speed of the Winged Dragon Flying Ship was unmatched, and it pierced through space. Several minutes later, a massive continent appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s sights.

The continent was jet-black in color, and it caused the hearts of anyone who laid eyes on it to tremble. The surroundings were icy cold and even before they arrived, they could feel the corrosive might of the black corpse devil qi.

Knowing that the slightest bit of carelessness would be fatal, Huang Xiaolong tossed a hundred pieces of high-grade holy spiritual jade stones into the formation. He opened the protective formation of the ship instantly.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong circulated his energy into the dark holy world in his Darkness Holy Ring. He covered the entire ship in the special qi it emitted in order to hide from many of the profound beasts around the continent.

In the blink of an eye, he arrived in space above the continent.
