Chapter 2512: Hefty Losses

After clearing their memories, Huang Xiaolong led Lin Xiaoying and Chen Yi’s group out of the Blood Plains.

Right now, he needed to look for a place to refine the holy souls he had gathered.

Otherwise, the factions behind them would definitely launch a search for them as soon as the trial was over. If they managed to track him down, they would demand for him to release their disciples. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If that happened, he would lose his chance to kill those b*stards!

As such, Huang Xiaolong needed to refine them all before the Trial of Blood ended.

Even though refining their holy souls meant that he wouldn’t be able to kill ghost devils, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care too much about it. After all, he was already in the third position. His points could be said to be sky-high, and even if he stopped, he would remain in the top ten ranks by the time the trial ended.

As soon as he killed Xiao Lengxue, Bai Buren, and She Nanfeng, there would be several spots emptied out in the top ten. Those who entered the leaderboards because of their deaths wouldn’t be able to catch up to Huang Xiaolong no matter how hard they tried. After all, the difference in points was too large!

When he separated from Lin Xiaoying, Chen Yi, and the rest, he chose an unremarkable mountain range in the Blood Plains to cultivate.

Out of the holy souls he had gathered, Huang Xiaolong decided to refine Dou Rui before anyone else. The reason wasn’t too complicated. After all, Dou Rui was the one he wanted to kill the most.

Sitting in the space within the cave he had created, Huang Xiaolong released Dou Rui’s holy soul.

As soon as he reappeared, Dou Rui laughed with glee, “Huang Xiaolong, what’s wrong? Are you planning to release us now that you realized that you can’t exterminate our souls?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head as a sneer formed on his lips. He didn’t wish to speak too much, and he immediately started to activate his dao heart. Strands of grand dao emerged from his body as pillars of piercing light appeared beside Dou Rui.

The smile on Dou Rui’s face froze, and he stared at the pillars of light with a stunned expression. His countenance changed when the light pierced into his body, and he seemed to have thought of something as a terrified expression slowly revealed itself on his face.

“You… How?! This isn’t possible! No!” Dou Rui screamed in horror.

“Impossible?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Don’t you wish to know how Cang Ping died?”

Previously, Zhang Yihui, and Cang Ping had their names erased from the leaderboards. Everyone who participated in the trial had trembled in fear, and Dou Rui had felt that there was a Primal Ancestor Realm ghost devil on the loose.

However, something clicked in his mind when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Was it you?!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother answering. Instead, he focused on his dao heart and Dou Rui’s saint attributes instantly turned into nourishment that flowed into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

If Dou Rui had merely guessed previously, right now, he was sure that Huang Xiaolong was the one who had killed Cang Ping. Feeling his saint attributes growing weaker and weaker, Dou Rui started to panic.

“No… No… Huang Xiaolong, you can’t kill me! You can’t kill me!” Dou Rui screamed in panic. Now that he knew there was no chance of escaping, fear finally took root in his heart. He was the same as Cang Ping, who had begged for mercy previously.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he increased the speed of absorption.

Dou Rui’s miserable screams filled the cave, but nothing mattered.

One day passed in a flash.

In the plaza outside the city, everyone felt blinded by a flash of light that emerged from the jade stele. A crisp shattering sound filled their ears as Dou Rui’s name exploded. The explosion was really pretty, and multi-colored rays of light entered the eyes of everyone present.

Silence descended on the plaza as everyone widened their eyes in shock. They stared at the stele as Dou Rui’s name disappeared from their sights. When the light finally dissipated, everyone snapped back to attention.

In an instant, the plaza erupted.

“Dou Rui from the Devil Palace fell! What’s going on?! Could he have run into the Primal Ancestor Realm ghost devil?! Did he run into the same one Cang Ping did?!”

“What a shame! It’s a huge loss for the Devil Palace!”

Discussions broke out in the crowd.

There were those who were gloating in the Devil Palace’s misfortune, and there were others who felt a sense of loss. There were some who rejoiced, and there were some who despaired.

Whatever the case, those who were happy, they definitely outnumbered those who were devastated.

After all, the Devil Palace had offended many superpowers. The Devil Palace had caused so much damage to the ancient races and the holy gates that many of their experts wanted to jump in joy when they noticed Dou Rui’s death.

Cao Nan’s heart sank, and his expression turned ugly.

As one of the six Devil Princes, the Devil Palace had poured an insane amount of resources into Dou Rui! The person who had the least chance of dying in this trial was Dou Rui, but reality proved everyone wrong.

“NICE!” A yell rang through the skies and someone started celebrating.

Even without seeing the person who was reveling in the Devil Palace’s misfortune, everyone knew that there was only one person who had the guts and strength to do so.

Tyrant Chu nearly broke out into a dance as his clapping, and cheering entered the ears of everyone present.

Cao Nan’s expression sank even further when he noticed Tyrant Chu’s actions.

When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, the Cangqiong Old Man frowned. A trace of suspicion appeared in his eyes. There wasn’t supposed to be a Primal Ancestor Realm expert in the Ghost Devil City. Even though the creatures living in the city had lived for several billions of years, he had never heard of a Primal Ancestor being born. Granted, even if there was a Primal Ancestor Realm ghost devil, it would hide itself deep in the city. There was no way it would roam around to kill weaklings at the First and Second Heaven True Saint Realm.

Moreover, he had conducted a check before the trial had started. He hadn’t discovered any traces of another Primal Ancestor.

However, now that two True Saint Realm disciples were dead, he couldn’t think of any other explanation!

Yet another day passed. When everyone was still discussing Dou Rui’s death, another burst of light emerged from the jade stele. This time, Xiao Lengxue’s name started to fade.

Eventually, his name disappeared from the leaderboard!

Everyone, clamoring in the plaza, fell silent instantly.

They widened their eyes in disbelief as their jaws dropped to the ground.

After several seconds of complete silence, the plaza erupted once again, this time stronger than before. No one could believe that Xiao Lengxue had died.

“Xiao Lengxue died in the trial!”

“Wouldn’t that mean that two out of six Devil Princes from the Devil Palace are dead?!”

However, the third day arrived quickly and Su BIqing’s name exploded like fireworks.

After Su Biqing’s name disappeared, You Lingzi followed in his footsteps. Soon, Bai Buren and She Nanfeng disappeared as well.

A True Saint died every single day!

Everyone stared at the jade stele in disbelief. When She Nanfeng died, none of them had anything else to say.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong had no idea what happened in the outside world. After devouring She Nanfeng, he could feel his holy soul trembling. After devouring so many super talents, Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes took another step forward and entered the top fifty.

His strength rose accordingly.

Spending some time to digest his gains, Huang Xiaolong started to refine the Black Corpse Holy Ring. He only emerged when he dropped back down to the tenth rank on the leaderboards.

After several days of killing, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the trial had ended and waited to be transported out of the city.
