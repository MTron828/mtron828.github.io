Chapter 3022: Which Palace do you Belong to?!

The white-haired old man assumed that Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu were disciples of the Leiyu Creed previously, and if they were willing to help, the members of the Scarlet Blood Clan wouldn’t dare to touch anyone present.

“Lord, this…” The white-haired old man spoke to Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden.

“Alright. Since I ate your Fiery Light Maize, let’s consider it as though we were brought together by fate. I’ll deal with this.” As soon as he spoke, he turned to the group surrounding the courtyard and sighed, “I’ll give you ten seconds to leave.”

The young man from the Scarlet Blood Clan was taken aback for a second, but he stared at Huang Xiaolong like he was looking at an idiot. “Brat, who the f*ck do you think you are? You can’t even protect yourself. Why are you thinking about helping them? Are you stupid?”

The group behind him roared with laughter.

Stepping forward, the white-haired old man explained, “The two lords are disciples of the Leiyu Creed!”

“?!” The members of the Scarlet Blood Clan were shocked. They looked at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu suspiciously.

“I wonder which division of the Leiyu Creed you’re from? Or are you associated with any palace?” One of the Ninth Heaven True Saint stepped forward and bowed slightly when he addressed Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu.

Palace? Division?

Lei Yu frowned. “We’re not from either of that.”

He had created the Lei Yu Creed from scratch! He was the forefather of the Leiyu Creed, and it was named after him. How could he belong to any of the divisions? The palaces and divisions in the Leiyu Creed belonged to him!

Everyone was stunned.

“Aren’t you disciples of the Leiyu Creed? Can we see your disciple plaques?” The Ninth Heaven True Saint followed up with another question.

“I don’t have one,” Lei Yu snapped.

Huang Xiaolong kept his calm, and he stared at the members of the Scarlet Blood Clan. Eight seconds had already passed.

A sneer left the Ninth Heaven True Saint’s lips when he heard Lei Yu’s reply. “I was almost fooled by you sly dogs! How dare you pretend to be disciples of the Leiyu Creed?!” He turned to the white haired old man and roared in rage, “You should know the punishment if one pretends to be a disciple of the Leiyu Creed, right?”

The white haired old man felt the blood draining from his face.

He hadn’t expected the two of them to be unable to retrieve the identity plaques of those of the Leiyu Creed.

Was he wrong? Were they not from the Leiyu Creed?

A sense of regret formed in his heart, but it was interrupted by Huang Xiaolong’s soft voice.

“Time is up.”

The experts surrounding the courtyard frowned as they had no idea what he meant.

Raising his purple-colored head to the skies, Lei Yu summoned a countless bolts of lightning that poured down from the void.

Those from the Scarlet Blood Clan were devoured by the lightning instantly. By the time the lightning scattered, only the stench of blood was left in the air.

Since Lei Yu was extremely adept at controlling the power of lightning, he didn’t affect the surroundings in the slightest.

The white-haired old man and Lin Tong stared at Lei Yu like they were looking at two monsters.

Was that it?!

As they stared at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu in shock, Huang Xiaolong climbed onto Lei Yu’s back and got ready to leave. Before he left, he looked at the youngster standing beside the white-haired old man and laughed, “This kid is pretty talented. If you plan to enter the Leiyu Creed, you can come and look for us.” He threw a transmission symbol at the old man after speaking.

When the white-haired old man stared at the transmission symbol in his hand, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu had already disappeared.

“What… What did he just say?” The old man stared at the object in his hand and muttered to himself.

“Grandfather, he said that we can look for them if we want to enter the Leiyu Creed!” the youngster explained.

After looking in the direction where Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu had left, the old man looked at the transmission symbol in his hand again.

“Don’t tell me the two of them are really from the Leiyu Creed…” Lin Tong frowned. “Why would they not be able to take out the identity plaques?”

The white-haired old man was bewildered as he couldn’t understand what had just happened.

“Senior Brother Liu, I’ll take my leave. The members of the Scarlet Blood Clan were killed, and they will definitely be able to track this place down. You should start moving.” Ignoring the old man’s reaction, Lin Tong sped away.

…

Several days later, they descended before a massive city.

When they arrived at the city gates, Lei Yu sighed. The city was created by him in the past, and he had used top-grade lightning attributed grand dao stones in order to craft it. The formations etched into the heart of the city were personally inscribed and branded by his dao soul!

Stopping for a second before the city gates, the two of them finally strode in.

Releasing his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong managed to observe the entire city.

“Is the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable your disciple?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

There was indeed a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable sitting in the inner hall of the headquarters, and he was the strongest individual in the Leiyu City. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nodding his head, a smile appeared on Lei Yu’s face. “Indeed. He’s called Zhou Hong and when I left, he had barely entered the Dao Venerable Realm. It’s been so long since we’ve last met, and he has already entered the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!”

When he had left, Lei Yu’s power of absolute lightning was only at the large completion stage. He wasn’t even near the peak of it! When he finally returned to the Leiyu Creed, his power of lightning was already at a whole new level…It was truly a long time since he had left.

“Let’s just look for your disciple and avoid alarming the others.”

Understanding Huang Xiaolong’s intentions, Lei Yu bowed respectfully.

As their figures started to blur, they reappeared in the inner hall of the Leiyu Creed.

Even though the formations around the inner hall were carefully placed and of a certain strength, it was nothing more than decoration to the two of them.

“Who?!” Zhou Hong discovered their presence the moment they appeared. However, a look of disbelief formed on his face when he saw Lei Yu. “Master… Master! You’re back!”

Even though Lei Yu wasn’t in his true form, Zhou Hong still managed to recognize him.

Nodding happily, Lei Yu smiled, “At least you didn’t forget me!”

Getting down on his knees, Zhou Hong kowtowed three times. After slamming his head heavily into the ground, tears started to well up in his eyes. “You’re back… You’re finally back!”

When Lei Yu saw Zhou Hong’s behavior, he face-palmed. “What are you crying for?! Hurry up and come over here! Greet His Highness!”

“His Highness?” Zhou Hong was stunned for a second. “Who are you talking about?” Looking at Huang Xiaolong, Zhou Hong didn’t understand what was going on.
