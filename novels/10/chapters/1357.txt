What is your relationship with Huang Xiaolong?

As Huang Xiaolong had not given them any prior instructions about dealing with such a situation, Feng Er asked a counterquestion, “Are you the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders?”

Xiang Yuan frowned with displeasure, “That’s right, we’re the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders. Since, Huang Xiaolong injured the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s disciples in our royal city, I hope Miss will hand over Huang Xiaolong to us, and not interfere in this matter!”

Feng Er shook her head and ordered, “You can leave now. We will stop by the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s headquarters, but not right now.”

It would be after Huang Xiaolong would have resurrected the petrified divine elephant!

Xiang Li sneered and asked mockingly, “What a joke! Do you mean to say that capturing Huang Xiaolong depends on whether he’s free or not? Do we have to wait tens of thousands of years, or several hundred thousand years to check his availability in order to capture him?”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s eyes swept coldly over the several Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders before looked away; he was too lazy to entertain these fools.

Xiang Wei glared coldly at Feng Er. “Since you’re so stubborn, we’ll capture you along with Huang Xiaolong!”

The four Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders exchanged a look and nodded slightly. Xiang Yuan and another Grand Elder suddenly attacked Feng Er, whereas Xiang Wei and the remaining Grand Elder reached out from across the space to capture Huang Xiaolong.

The four Grand Elders tacitly cooperated—two people went to delay Feng Er, while Xiang Wei and the other Grand Elder went to capture Huang Xiaolong. After that, all four of them would concentrate on capturing Feng Er.

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders were all late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters. They were confident that they could cooperate and easily suppress Feng Er, despite her strength.

Of course, this is what they believed naively.

Just as Xiang Wei and the other Grand Elder thought that they had caught Huang Xiaolong, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, who had been standing silently in one corner, suddenly stood up and raised his right paw and flicked two of his claw nails, as if he was flicking dirt from under them. Xiang Wei and the other Grand Elder wailed as both of them were sent flying backwards akin to broken kites.

Xiang Yuan and another Grand Elder were just about to attack Feng Er when they were startled by two loud wails. They stopped as they looked over their shoulders, and saw two flying figures. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Their shocked gazes fell onto void devil beast Xu Baisheng.

“You, you’re a God King Realm master!”

A God King Realm master!

Xiang Li seemed to hear thunder rumbling in his eardrums, and he got goosebumps.

There’s actually a God King Realm master—!!

This forgettable and charcoal of a demonic beast at Huang Xiaolong’s side was actually a peerless God King Realm beast king!

Xiang Li shuddered as he remembered that he had followed Guo Jun to block Huang Xiaolong.

Two consecutive booms sounded as Xiang Wei and the other Grand Elders crashed into a medicinal shop in the far distance, destroying a large number of herbs. The two fainted into oblivion from the fall.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s cold gaze swept over Xiang Li’s group, and was finally fixed on Xiang Li.

Xiang Li’s knees buckled and gave out under Xu Baisheng’s stare.

Xiang Yuan retrieved his gaze from the two who had crashed into a shop in the far distance. He could see that they had merely fainted, and had not really suffered heavy injuries. Clearly, Xu Baisheng had held back.

“Sen-Senior, you, you and Huang Xiaolong, are...?” Xiang Yuan suppressed his shock and tried to ask void devil beast Xu Baisheng. His manner had completely changed, while his haughtiness had flown away with the wind.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng stated coldly, “What is our relationship is not for you to know. You can leave now.”

Xiang Yuan didn’t expect this answer. He wanted to ask more, the other Grand Elder pulled his sleeve, and dissuaded him with a look. He smiled and greeted, “In that case, we shall take our leave!”

With that said, he pulled Xiang Yuan away. He picked up the two unconscious Grand Elders, and disappeared from sight along with Xiang Li, using a Great Space Teleportation.

“If it were up to me, I would have killed that Xiang Li.” Gui Yi snorted.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng said, “It is more important for the Master to resurrect the petrified divine elephant, before that it is better we do not to form a deep grudge with the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan.” Then, he turned respectfully to the little cow and inquired, “Senior Xiaoniu, what do you think?”

The little cow nodded in agreement. She said, “You did well this time, this is to reward you.”

She took out a common chaos spiritual pill and looped in his direction.

The void devil beast Xu Baisheng was stupefied, and then disappointed.

Reward? This is just a common chaos spiritual pill! This...! Compared to Master, Senior Xiaoniu is too stingy!

“What, you don’t want it?” The little cow widened her eyes and glared at the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s disappointed expression.

Xu Baisheng’s heart jumped, and he replied hurriedly, “No, no, of course not. I couldn’t be happier with Senior Xiaoniu’s reward.”

The little cow drawled, “That’s good! You don’t know how many powerful beast kings used to dream about being rewarded to be rewarded by me, but they didn’t get a thing.”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng smiled wryly as he said ‘yes.’

Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er, laughed secretly at Xu Baisheng.

“Alright now, everyone be on alert and guard. Those few Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s kids would most likely bring reinforcements after returning. Don’t allow them to disturb the Master!” The little cow cleared her throat and reminded everyone.

“Yes, Senior Xiaoniu!” The four complied.

...

On another side, Xiang Yuan, Xiang Wei, and the others’ were inwardly relieved when they finally descended at the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s headquarters. A feeling of escaping death came over them.

Had the void devil beast Xu Baisheng wanted to kill them, they wouldn’t have been able to escape at all.

“What is our plan?” Xiang Yuan asked as he looked at Xiang Wei.

Xiang Wei and the other Grand Elder had consumed healing pellets and their condition had improved.

“There is only one way left for us; we need to report to the Patriarch and Ancestor!” Xiang Wei hesitated, then sighed heavily.

Half an hour before, it had never crossed their minds that Huang Xiaolong would have a God King Realm follower at his side!

At this point, they would be nothing but fools, if they were to continue in believing that Huang Xiaolong was merely a Fortune Gate’s disciple.

“That’s the only way!” Xiang Yuan nodded in agreement.

The few of them took out elephant-shaped communication talismans and reported the matter to the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Patriarch and Ancestor.

Soon, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Patriarch Xiang Tai, who was cultivating inside a secret space within the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City, received Xiang Yuan and the others report.

Xiang Tai wasn’t very concerned about the matter until he read the latter part of the report.

“Trouble?” The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Ancestor Xiang Hui asked when he noticed Xiang Tai’s fluctuated emotions.

Xiang Tai nodded solemnly, and briefly recounted what Xiang Yuan and the others had reported. Xiang Hui too was shocked when he heard about what had happened.

“The Fortune Gate’s disciple, Huang Xiaolong? God King Realm master?” Shock and disbelief flickered in his eyes.

“That is so, Ancestor. This matter, you see?” Xiang Tai asked with a serious expression.

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Ancestor Xiang Hui spoke in a heavy tone, “What is Huang Xiaolong doing at the divine elephant’s square? What are his intentions?” Although there were a lot of unknown people who came to observe the petrified divine elephant, it was obvious that Huang Xiaolong had another goal.
