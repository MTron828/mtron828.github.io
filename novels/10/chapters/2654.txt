Chapter 2655: It’s Impossible for Me to Lose to You

The various races’ experts around the battle stage began to ridicule and throw insults at Huang Xiaolong, who was standing there like a fool.

“This Huang Xiaolong, is he frightened foolish?” Yao Ji muttered with confusion.

Yuan Wangfeng snickered, “I don’t know if he’s frightened foolish, but he will soon turn into a fool.”

“Grand Hall Master is right,” Chen Muguang promptly flattered. “In a while, His Highness Yuan Qianxing is going to inflict inhuman torture on Huang Xiaolong that he won’t even remember his own surname.”

Laughters sounded all around.

At this time, Yuan Qianxing stopped a meter away from Huang Xiaolong. As he saw that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t moved even an inch, still standing arrogantly at death’s door, Yuan Qianxing’s fury lit up instantly, and he punched out in a rage.

“Return to Origin!”

It was the same grand dao art.

After fully comprehending the Return to Origin dao art, Yuan Qianxing could smoothly execute any of the attacks like it was part of his body, and it didn’t take much effort at all. And each attack was more than ten times more powerful than before!

Origin energy roiled vigorously, roaring and howling, causing the battle stage’s space to vibrate violently, targeting Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Just as everyone thought Huang Xiaolong would be sent flying by Yuan Qianxing’s punch, Huang Xiaolong raised his right hand and lightly waved, just like how one would wave away some dust. The world seemed to sway with Huang Xiaolong’s wave of his hand, and the world-destroying Return of Origin fist force was redirected.

The Return of Origin fist force hit on the battle stage’s barrier instead, and the remnant impact jarred Yuan Wangfeng’s, Yao Ji’s, Chen Muguang’s, and the others’ heads, buzzing endlessly.

Yuan Wangfeng and the rest retreated in alarm with their eyes wide with astonishment at this sight.

Long Shengtian blanked momentarily.

Mo Wunian, too, had a blank expression on his face.

The experts of Myriad Origin Race, Enchantress Race, and Golden Buddha Race were dazed. So were all the Otherworldly Mansion’s higher echelons.

The Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi’s eyes were wide in astonishment like many others.

On the scene, only Fei Yanzi managed to keep a calm composure. However, she was just as shocked as anyone that Huang Xiaolong had deflected Yuan Qianxing’s attack so effortlessly.

On the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong was enjoying the shocked expression on Yuan Qianxing’s face. Then, without any warning, he swung out his fist. Yuan Qianxing, who was still in shock, was flustered when he felt the terrifying force coming from Huang Xiaolong’s punch, and he raised his fist to counter in a panic.

RUMBLE!

The collision of their fists was akin to two giant mountains slamming into each other.

The mountain under their feet quaked.

Yuan Qianxing’s body shook after being struck by a great impact, and he couldn’t help staggering back to steady himself but failed several times. He finally managed to stop forcefully at the edge of the stage. As he stood there, he felt the prickling numbness traveling up his right arm. His blood flow was chaotic, and his holy energy almost stagnated.

Most of the experts present were already shocked speechless, and there was only dazed expression on their faces.

Yuan Qianxing stared at the deep foot imprints on the battle stage floor in disbelief. He had made these deep foot imprints as he had staggered to regain his balance moments ago. These foot imprints were like humiliation and loud slaps on his face!

“What b*llshit Return-to-Origin? To me, it’s a vulnerable attack!” Huang Xiaolong looked at Yuan Qianxing with cold and indifferent eyes and his tone was the exact imitation of the way Yuan Qianxing had ridiculed Mo Wunian when he had smashed Mo Wunian down from the air.

Now, Huang Xiaolong retaliated in the same manner.

Vulnerable attack?!

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze, the contempt within Huang Xiaolong’s eyes stimulated Yuan Qianxing’s rage, and his killing intent roared in his chest.

Roar!

Yuan Qianxing’s eyes had turned bloodshot. Intense rays of golden light burst out from his body as origin energy surged violently around him. At the same time, a terrifying power emerged within his body, and the moment this power emerged, all present Primal Ancestor experts felt like endless origin energy had come flooding down from the starry void.

At this moment, Yuan Qianxing had awakened the Myriad Origin Race’s innate talent’s power.

If Yuan Qianxing was a docile rabbit a moment ago, then he was definitely a raging ferocious tiger now.

The coercion coming off him was several times stronger than before.

Every strand of his hair stood on ends because of the energy rushing out from his body, and under the coercive pressure from his body, the energy flow around the Five Spirits Peak froze. This phenomenon rendered Feitian Longpeng, Yin Zhangguo, Feng Jiu, and others dumbfounded.

“Huang Xiaolong, you will die in the most miserable, tragic way!” Yuan Qianxing spoke every word through gritted teeth, and it was bone-chilling.

When he was still a Sixth Heaven True Saint, he could defeat the average First Resurrection Primal Ancestor. At that time, he was hailed as the Alien Lands strongest person below the Primal Ancestor realm!

After he had entered Seventh Heaven True Saint, many Second Resurrection Primal Ancestors were no longer qualified to be his opponent. But today, right in front of so many Otherworldly Mansion’s experts, he was sent staggering back by a Fourth Heaven True Saint human!

Humiliation! Absolute humiliation!

Yuan Qianxing suddenly screamed, and his fists punched at Huang Xiaolong, carrying intense killing intent.

“Return to Origin, Complete Annihilation!”

“Die for me!”

BOOM!

Everyone on the Five Spirits Peak felt the world rumbling as Yuan Qianxing’s fists swung out as if a mighty force had struck it. They saw two colossal fists that were completely condensed out of origin energy flowing across the air. It gave everyone the illusion that even the unreachable sun in the sky would shatter into pieces if it was hit by Yuan Qianxing’s fists.

Faces ashened at the fists’ destructive force.

As he watched the two fists speeding at him, Huang Xiaolong spurred the holy energy within him, and the Holy Mandate Imprint between his brows came to life, emitting resplendent rays of light as he punched out with both fists.

Boundless rays of purple light rushed out following Huang Xiaolong’s fist force. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Rumble!

Four fists collided.

The battle stage that had been repeatedly forged and strengthened for countless hundred millions of years by Primal Ancestor experts began to crack. Overwhelming destructive force swept violently outwards in the four directions. Whereas, Yuan Qianxing was sent staggering back again. Moreover, this time, Yuan Qianxing nearly fell off the edge, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“What?!”

Yuan Wanfeng, Yao Ji, Chen Muguang, and many others were stupefied.

Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, Yin Zhangguo, and all the Otherworldly Mansion’s higher echelons were agape.

Yuan Qianxing, who had awakened his innate talent’s power, was forced back by Huang Xiaolong just the same!

Not to mention, this time, Yuan Qianxing vomited blood, and his blood glistened on the battle stage like gold.

On the battle stage and all around was dead silence.

Fei Yanzi’s gaze was glued to Huang Xiaolong’s figure. She had expected Huang Xiaolong’s combat power to have exploded upon entering Fourth Heaven True Saint, but it had never occurred to her that Huang Xiaolong would be this strong!

So, so strong!

Not long ago, Mo Wunian, who had broken through to Primal Ancestor Realm, had failed to withstand even one strike from Yuan Qianxing, but now Yuan Qianxing seemed weaker in comparison to Huang Xiaolong?! Didn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong…?!

Yuan Qianxing vomited three mouthfuls of blood before he managed to suppress his roiling blood flow. He roughly wiped away the blood from the corners of his mouth, and glared at Huang Xiaolong as shock and fury were obvious on his face. “You, impossible! I am the Son of Origin, I have the Origin Saint Godhead, the number one saint godhead. How could I possibly lose to you?!” The more he said, the murderous aura around him grew increasingly chilling.

“Huang Xiaolong, I won’t lose to you!” A saint godhead flew out from Yuan Qianxing’s body.

The world quivered when the saint godhead appeared. Every ray of light and color in the world seemed to gather on this saint godhead! This was the king of saint godheads, the Origin Saint Godhead!
