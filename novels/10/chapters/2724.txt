Chapter 2725: Gift?

Completed world!

Long Jianfei’s voice rang in the minds of everyone, and they failed to regain their sense even after a long time.

“If our Mansion Master has already formed the tiny world in his body, wouldn’t that mean that he would enter the God of Creation Realm the moment it evolved into a completed world?” Zi Dongping asked with a dazed expression etched on his face.

Everyone turned to look at Long Jianfei.

Even Huang Xiaolong looked at Long Jianfei as he really wanted to know the answer to that question.

A stunned expression slowly formed on Long Jianfei’s face. He had never thought of the answer to the question. That was because nothing of the likes had ever happened before.

“Ordinarily, the world contained in their bodies would experience a transformation after a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable enters the God of Creation Realm. The tiny world would turn into a completed world!” Long Jianfei muttered, “That’s the legend that has been passed down in the Divine Tuo Holy World since the start of time, and I have no idea what Young Lord is experiencing right now…”

After all, Huang Xiaolong’s situation was special. His world might evolve into a completed world before he stepped into the Dao Venerable Realm! After all, he was only at the True Saint Realm!

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong allowed Long Jianfei to use his dao soul to observe the golden ball of light in his dantian. After checking it out for himself, Long Jianfei could no longer contain the excitement in his heart. “Indeed… The golden ball of light was a world formed by a Dao Venerable!”

Despite the fact that it was in its initial stages of development, Long Jianfei was sure that it was the fabled world possessed by Dao Venerables.

Huang Xiaolong was equally as excited after obtaining Long Jianfei’s confirmation.

The only one with an indignant expression stood by the side, pouting. “I told you guys it was a tiny world! None of you believed me! Humph! Why are you listening to that newborn kid instead of me?!”

The one who spoke was naturally Skylet, and the newborn kid referred to Long Jianfei.

An awkward expression formed on Long Jianfei’s face when he realized that even as the ancestor of the Dragon Fish Race in the Cangqiong Holy World, he was like a newborn calf compared to the innate Xuanhuang Stone.

As such, he felt that it wasn’t wrong for the little spirit to call him a newborn kid.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked the little spirit and Long Jianfei about the tiny world in his body and what he needed to do about it. Since the little spirit was able to tell that the golden ball of light in his body was a tiny world with a single glance, he no longer dared to look down on little Skylet. Even though it looked cute as a little ball of light with a weird temperament, it seemed extremely reliable when it came down to actual business.

After hearing that the innate Xuanhuang Stone and other stuff similar to it were beneficial for the growth of his world, Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated to keep the entire chunk into his world.

From what he heard, the Tree of Grand Dao and grand dao source spring were also useful in the development of his world. Retrieving all of them from the Cangqiong Dao Palace, he pulled them all into the tiny world contained by the golden ball of light.

Since they were of use, the more the merrier.

According to Skylet and Long Jianfei, there were differences in strength if they had to compare the strength of the various Dao Venerables. The worlds were split into different levels accordingly, and they were the initial level, maturing level, perfect level, and extreme level.

Ordinarily, one would need several billion years to develop one’s tiny world from the initial level to the maturing level. With the assistance of so many heavenly treasures, Huang Xiaolong could easily shorten the duration!

In fact, it was possible for him to shorten the time to a hundred thousand years!

“It seems like I need to look for treasures at the level of the innate Xuanhuang Stone,” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. The only thing he desired was to turn the world contained in his dantian into a completed world as soon as possible!

After he was done, he brought everyone back to the Otherworldly Mansion.

When they passed through the Dragon Fish Domain, Huang Xiaolong decided to stay for a couple of days.

Perhaps it was because he was about to head over to the Divine Tuo Holy World with Huang Xiaolong that Long Jianfei felt a little melancholic when he looked at the Dragon Fish Race that he had single-handedly brought up after crossing over to this world.

No matter how relieved he was to return to the Divine Tuo Holy World, he would be lying if he said that he was no longer attached to the Dragon Fish Race.

Finally, they continued on their journey back to the Alien Lands, and Mo Zhi and the others brought up their desire to follow Huang Xiaolong to the Divine Tuo Holy World.

When Huang Xiaolong heard their request, he was slightly taken aback.

After a short moment of consideration, he decided to bring Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, and Zi Dongping along. However, he also mentioned that if he failed to bring them across, they would have to remain behind obediently.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

A burst of excitement filled their hearts when they heard that Huang Xiaolong had agreed to bring them with him.

When they finally arrived at the newly named Blue Dragon Mansion back in the Alien Lands, Huang Xiaolong summoned Duan Feng and the other ancestors. He passed down a whole list of orders, and it was clear that he was making preparations to leave the Cangqiong Holy World.

He had no idea how long it would take him before he could return once he left. As such, he had to arrange everything beforehand. For example, he chose the person to be in charge of the Blue Dragon Manor in his absence.

Also, he handed down his authority and arranged for different people to be in charge of the Alien Lands and World River.

When he was done, he brought Fei Yanzi, Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and those he had promised to bring along with him back to the Holy Heavens. He went to greet his masters and the Primal Ancestors of the Holy World along with Lin Xiaoying.

Learning that Huang Xiaolong was about to leave, Lin Xiaoying hugged him and sobbed her eyes out.

When he looked at the despondent Lin Xiaoying, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know what he could say to comfort her.

However, the little lady’s face soon turned red, and her sobs stopped. As she stared into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, Lin Xiaoying whispered in a tiny voice, “Xiaolong, I… I wish to give it to you!”

“?!” Unable to react in time, Huang Xiaolong stared at her with question marks filling his mind. “What do you want to give me?”

How could Lin Xiaoying speak of something so embarrassing?! By raising her leg, she kicked Huang Xiaolong’s shin before turning to leave.

He only reacted after she reached the main entrance. With a shake of his body, he arrived behind her, and he hugged her in his arms. A squeal left her lips, but it soon turned into pleasurable moans. Spring filled the room in a couple of minutes as sensual cries rang from time to time.

Huang Xiaolong only emerged from his room after several months.

As soon as he appeared, Long Jianfei stared at him with a questionable gaze, and he was smacked on the head in response.

With his lips curling upwards, Long Jianfei rubbed his head. Chuckling excitedly, he continued, “Actually, no one said that you wouldn’t be able to bring Lin Xiaoying over to the Divine Tuo Holy World.”

“HUH?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened and his jaws dropped.

“You couldn’t do so in the past, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t do it now,” Long Jianfei explained. “After all, the tiny world in your body wasn’t present before!”

“Tiny world?!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up and a possibility flashed through his eyes. “Do you mean…?”

“That’s right! Young Lord can bring Lady Lin over by keeping her in your tiny world!” A sinister smile formed on his face soon after. “Of course, young master can bring all of your beauties over with you! Aren't there still Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and Xue Lingyun?”

Before he completed his sentence, Huang Xiaolong’s figure had already disappeared.
