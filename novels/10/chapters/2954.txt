Chapter 2955: There Are Others Inside Here?

It could be said that Huang Xiaolong’s third tribulation’s White Incineration Lightning, Origin Flame, and Light of Creation a while ago seemed tame compared to the waterfall of ice lightning in front of him.

The ice-lightning waterfall in the land up ahead let out deafening roars as if there were billions of lightning beasts raging war at the heavens. Huang Xiaolong also sensed a faint trace of absolute lightning power from the ice-lightning waterfall!

Definitely the power of absolute lightning!

The average Dao Venerable experts might not be able to sense the presence of absolute lightning power, whereas Huang Xiaolong was a person who wielded four types of absolute powers, such as, frost, blaze, poison and the power of nirvana. Although the power of absolute lightning was well hidden amongst the ice lightning, Huang Xiaolong managed to capture its presence.

Now, Huang Xiaolong was looking at the waterfall of ice lightning in anticipation. Others would be afraid to step into this land of ice lightning, but to Huang Xiaolong, it was a treasure!

It was because he had the God of Creation, Huang Long Bloodline!

He could devour the absolute lighting power in the ice lightning waterfall!

Adding the power of absolute lightning to his existing ones, he would have five kinds of absolute power!

Between heaven and earth, there were thirteen kinds of absolute powers!

There was an old myth claiming that even the God of Creation wouldn’t be able to kill the person who wielded thirteen kinds of absolute powers and cultivated them until all thirteen absolute powers reached perfection state!

Although this was a myth, things like myths and legends existed on some basis of truth.

Other people couldn’t master thirteen absolute powers, but Huang Xiaolong was someone with a high probability of succeeding, and he had practiced each power to perfection.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath, and spurred his Huang Long Bloodline’s power. A majestic golden dragon emerged behind him, as he stepped into the ice lightning land step by step.

When Huang Xiaolong’s foot first touched the ground within ice lightning’s domain, the ice lightning waterfall falling from the sky slammed against his body like a hundred million ice mountains. Huang Xiaolong swayed from the impact, and his body sank into the ground. Despite his powerful Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, he felt electrifying pangs of pain spreading through his body, and it was a heart-wrenching kind of pain. Not to mention, he was simultaneously attacked by the ice qi and lightning qi, rendering his body stiff and numb.

Then again, that was all there was to it.

This degree of heart-wrenching pain wasn’t much to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong did not call out the Huang Long Armor, but he purely relied on his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth to reach the central region of the ice lighting domain in a single stride. He sat cross-legged and fully focused on circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, devouring and absorbing it.

The overspilling ice lightning waterfall seemed to have found an outlet, and it rushed towards Huang Xiaolong in a frenzy.

As strong as Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth was, he felt tremendous amounts of pain.

Huang Xiaolong was completely surrounded by swarms of lightning snakes, baring their fangs at him. Before these violent lightning snakes’ lightning qi and ice qi could rush into Huang Xiaolong’s body and cause damage, they were devoured clear by the dragon of creation behind Huang Xiaolong.

Even as Huang Xiaolong absorbed these lightning qi and ice qi, more flowed from the ice lightning waterfall.

This went on for several months.

As the more of lightning qi and ice qi Huang Xiaolong absorbed, sparks of lightning formed in his Huang Long Bloodline, and this was the power of absolute lightning, albeit it was a little weak. However, the power of Huang Long Bloodline had grown stronger, exuding a sense of danger, stronger than the White Incineration Lightning.

While Huang Xiaolong was fully immersed in devouring and absorbing the ice lightning waterfall, at a distance far away from Huang Xiaolong’s location, Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the rest of the group were glaring angrily at the snowy-browed Ancestor Xuan in the opposite group.

Elder Tong and other experts in Feng Yue’s group were all stained with blood and injuries. They were injured, and these were not some light injuries.

“What do you guys want?” Feng Yue faced the other side coldly, staring at the snowy-browed Ancestor Xuan and the young man beside him. She had not expected someone else to have obtained the other Eye of Frost, and this group of people had entered right after them.

More importantly, the snowy-browed old man’s cultivation seemed to have reached the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

It was this old man, who had injured Elder Tong and the others with one wave, including Feng Yue, who was wearing a Dao Venerable cosmos artifact for protection.

The icefrost rune on the young man’s forehead shone softly as he observed Feng Yue from head to toe. He smiled amiably and said, “Young Lady is one of the three moons, Young Lady Feng Yue? I didn’t expect that I, Bing Jun, would encounter Young Lady Feng Yue here. Though our race has stayed away from the world for a long time, I have heard of Young Lady Feng Yue’s unparalleled beauty. After seeing it with my own eyes, I can say that everything I have heard is true.”

Feng Yue frowned, and kept silent. The naked desire and greed in the young man’s eyes made her disgusted. She had seen too many of these kinds of gazes.

The young man Bing Jun continued as if he had not seen Feng Yue’s dislike, “I guess Young Lady Feng Yue can guess what we want to do. And that holy staff, we want it too! And also, I’ll trouble Young Lady Feng Yue and everyone to take out all the treasures on you!”

“What?!” A Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable beside Elder Tong glared at them and refused, “Impossible!”

But his word of refusal barely left his mouth, when he was sent flying with a slap from Bing Jun to be buried into the hall’s stonewall. No further movement came from the hole in the wall.

“Song Jun!” Elder Tong and the others cried out as their faces ashened.

Feng Yue glared at the young man coldly. The young man not only wanted the treasures they had found here, but he even wanted the treasures that originally belonged to them.

“You’ve crossed the line!” Feng Yue stated icily, “Your Frost Eye Race was powerful back in the past, but now your race is struggling to survive. Aren’t you afraid that the Traversing Wind Creed and Traversing Wind Heavenly Cave will come seeking revenge?”

Bing Jun smiled, “As long as we captured all of you, who will know we did it?” And he added with a malevolent gleam, “I’ve heard that Young Lady Feng Yue has the rare Wind Awn Dao Physique, which is most suited with my Ice Phoenix Dao Physique. When I and Young Lady Feng Yue became dao companions, the Frost Eye Race and Traversing Wind Creed would form an alliance. Wouldn’t it be an ‘all’s well that ends well’ situation?”

Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the others’ expressions turned ugly.

The other side’s meaning did not need any more deciphering. He wanted to detain all of them, bring them back to the Frost Eye Race, and finally become dao companions with Feng Yue!

Everything would be too late by the time Feng Yue’s master, the Traversing Wind Creed’s patriarch, learned about it.

“How dare you?!” Feng Yue raged. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Bing Jun laughed, “Why wouldn’t I dare?”

To Bing Jun, encountering Feng Yue during this trip was a pleasant surprise. When he would become Feng Yue’s dao companion, he could borrow the Traversing Wind Creed’s power to help the Frost Eye Race return to their past glory.

“Do you think people from the Traversing Wind Creed entered this space?!” Suddenly, a Dao Venerable behind Feng Yue couldn’t stop himself.

Feng Yue paled and snapped at the expert behind her, “Cui Zheng, shut up!”

If the other side learned that Huang Xiaolong was also inside here, Huang Xiaolong would be in danger.

“Oh, there are others that entered?” Ancestor Xuan, who had been silent the entire time, spoke this time, “Speak, who else came in with you?”

Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the rest kept quiet.

“Not speaking?!” Ancestor Xuan sneered, “No problem, I have many ways to make you speak!”
