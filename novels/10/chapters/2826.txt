Chapter 2827: My Father Will Really Kill You!

Yi Beihang, Wang Jin, Yi Xiaotang, Aunt Qing, and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong as they finally understood what Yu Sheng meant! With the power he showed, he definitely had more than eight high-order Saint Fates!

More than eight!

The possibility had flashed in their minds previously, but they had forced themselves to deny it. Eight high-order Saint Fates would make someone a freak in the Divine Tuo Holy World. No one would ever guess that a mere disciple of Cangqiong Sacred Land would possess more than eight!

Now that Yu Sheng brought this up, everyone couldn’t help but doubt themselves.

Ignoring Yu Sheng, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Yi Beihang and the others. “All of you better do it yourself. The disciples of the Blue Heaven Creed will be sending themselves to die if they try anything.”

Their expressions sank instantly.

They didn’t think that a mere Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor would dare to challenge them. Moreover, he issued the challenge to all four of them at once.

Whatever the case, they knew that Xiang Yi wasn’t Huang Xiaolong’s match, and no one else they sent would be able to change a thing.

The one thing they couldn’t understand was how a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor could control the power of absolute flame and frost!

That was simply inconceivable! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

According to the laws of the world, one shouldn’t be able to control two opposing powers! Huang Xiaolong proved their knowledge of the laws wrong, and he was a freak of nature!

They didn’t know if they should continue their assault.

Yi Beihang and Yan San’s faces were cloudy.

“Huang Xiaolong, if you are willing to become my disciple, I will promise you that I will spare no efforts in teaching you. As soon as you enter, I will give you the same authority as us! Not only will we pardon your crimes, we will also allow you to choose any treasure you desire in the treasury!” Wang Jin spoke all of a sudden.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Just a moment ago, Huang Xiaolong had mocked Wang Jin. He had destroyed Xiang Yi’s grand dao physique, and he challenged the authority of the Blue Heaven Creed. Now, Wang Jin was willing to accept him as a disciple!

Snapping back to reality, Yi Beihang continued, “That’s right! Huang Xiaolong, we will forgive everything you did in the past! As long as you choose to join us, I will make you the young patriarch of our faction! We will spare no efforts in nurturing you, and the moment you enter the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, we will promote you to the position of the patriarch!”

Everyone was struck speechless.

Yi Beihang added another term, and he allowed Huang Xiaolong to be the young patriarch the moment he entered!

He would even be able to take on the role of the patriarch once he entered the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

This... This!

Everyone was stunned.

The patriarch of every single creed had to be a Dao Venerable, but they were making an exception for Huang Xiaolong!

That was unheard of in the Divine Tuo Holy World!

There was no way anyone would reject such great conditions!

Of course, it wasn’t anything special when they thought about how Huang Xiaolong could control the power of absolute flame and frost.

Based on that fact alone, it was more than enough for the Blue Heaven Creed to place down their grudges to recruit Huang Xiaolong.

When everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong would accept the offer, a snort left his lips. “Wang Jin, didn’t you hear what I said? You’re not qualified to be my master. Not to mention the fact that I have no desire to become the patriarch of your Blue Heaven Creed.”

If Huang Xiaolong revealed his identity as the Son of Creation, the strongest creeds would be fighting to bring him in as their patriarch.

The Dragon Fish Creed was one of them.

The Blue Heaven Creed was too tiny to enter his sights.

Moreover, he had no intention of compromising today.

Those standing around were shocked when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s rejection.

The faces of Wang Jin and the others turned unsightly.

As the number one expert in the Blue Heaven Creed, Wang Jin had been embarrassed time and time again by Huang Xiaolong.

Roaring with laughter, Yi Beihang snorted, “Since you have no interest in being the patriarch of the Blue Heaven Creed…”

Killing intent flashed in his eyes. Since his offer was rejected, he wouldn’t mind getting rid of Huang Xiaolong!

There was no way they could allow a threat like Huang Xiaolong to live on.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re such a fool! My father wanted to make you the young patriarch of the Blue Heaven Creed, and there are many people who would kill to be in your place! Why would you reject him?!” Yi Xiaotang urged, “Hurry up and agree! Otherwise, my father will really kill you!”

Even though Yi Xiaotang wanted her father to exact revenge for her, a feeling of despair filled her heart all of a sudden when she realized that her father was actually going to do as he said.

A flash of surprise crossed Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he didn’t think that she would be worried for him. Shaking his head slightly, he sighed, “I said this before, and I shall say it again. I have no interest in being the patriarch of your Blue Heaven Creed. Not to mention the fact that your father wouldn’t be able to kill me.”

Everyone was stunned.

Yi Xiaotang screamed in anger, “You! Do you really think that you’re comparable to a Dao Venerable because of the power of absolute frost and flame?! My father is a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable! You can’t even imagine how strong he is! He can kill you in a single hit!”

“No matter how talented you are, you’re not his match!”

“Quickly agree with my father and Ancestor Wang Jin!”

Anger surged through Yi Xiaotang’s heart when she heard how arrogant Huang Xiaolong was acting. She couldn’t understand why he would reject such great terms!

Remaining silent, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Wang Jin. There was absolutely no point in saying any more.

Killing intent leaked out from Yi Beihang’s eyes, and he sneered, “Since that’s the case, there’s no need for you to live a second longer!” The might of a Dao Venerable was released and the space around him shook.
