Chapter 3643 – Raising a Marriage Request to the Jian Family

Just as Tao Hang was about to refute, Jian Bifei brought out a spatial ring and tossed it over. “There’s a low-grade universe-level spiritual vein in there. You should know how precious that is. It’s something you will never be able to obtain even if you used your whole life trying. Let it be your reward for raising Little Sister Han’er.”

Tao Hang’s expression fluctuated, but Huang Xiaolong reacted before he could say anything.

“Heh, isn’t it just a low-grade universe-level spiritual vein?” He said before tossing out two high-grade universe-level spiritual veins.

In a state of shock, Jian Bifei was sent flying backwards from the impact of the two spiritual veins crashing into him.

“Here’s two high-grade ones. Since you look like a beggar, you can have them.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Take these and get out of my face.”

“You’re looking to die!” Jian Bifei roared as he crawled to his feet. His sword stabbed towards Huang Xiaolong as rays of resplendent light emerged from the tip.

Jian Bifei was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and he was stronger than Yu Jingyu and Wu Qifeng of the Limitless Lands!

Well…

Before his sword could even arrive, a hand emerged from behind Huang Xiaolong to catch the blade.

Cao Dehong was the one who moved, and Jian Bifei roared in anger, “Cao Dehong, how dare you stand in my way? Even though I don’t know why the few of you are standing on his side, I’ll exterminate your clans if you obstruct me!”

Cao Dehong flicked his finger casually and sent Jian Bifei tumbling to the side.

“Exterminate my clan?” Cao Dehong raised an eyebrow slightly. “Let’s talk about it if you have the ability to do so.”

“Great… Great!” Jian Bifei got to his feet and glared at everyone on Huang Xiaolong’s side.

“We’ll meet again.” He spat before turning to leave.

Huang Xiaolong’s cheery laughter rang in his ears, “You’re right. We most definitely will.”

He didn’t make things difficult for Jian Bifei as he allowed the man to leave.

Hesitating slightly, Tao Hang asked, “Lord, should we notify Han’er about our issue with the Jian Family?” He naturally referred to the difference between the Xiaohong Celestial Empire and the Jian Family. Even though Yu Xiaohong taught Jian Xiyuan and the others a small lesson, the tyrannical Jian Family wouldn’t let things go.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Of course not. Jian Wushuang isn’t strong enough for us to care about him. At best, he’s a side character…”

Side character?!

Cao Dehong and the others revealed a bitter smile when they heard what he said. Those in the Unknown Lands who could call Jian Wushuang a side character could probably be counted on one hand.

Huang Xiaolong strolled around for a little more and headed over to the residence of another God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage to rest for the night.

Huang Xiaolong looked through the sword manual, the night passed unknowingly. He only realized that morning had arrived when Cao Dehong and the others came over to notify him.

“If you didn’t come to look for me, I wouldn’t have realized that dawn had broken!” Huang Xiaolong joked.

“Lord, you can comprehend the sword manual due to your overwhelming talent. If we obtained the sword manual, we wouldn’t be able to comprehend it.” Cao Dehong praised.

Chuckling lightly, Huang Xiaolong knew that Cao Dehong was trying to kiss his *ss. However, there was some truth in his words. Not many people could comprehend the sword intent contained in the sword manual written by Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s go. The auction should be starting.” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and headed towards the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce.

As it wasn’t too far from the place they were staying, the group arrived in less than half an hour.

It was a perfect coincidence that they ran into Zhu Jian, Zhu Yun, and the others at the entrance of the chamber of commerce.

When Zhu Jian and the others saw Huang Xiaolong’s party, they were shocked. “It’s you guys!” Zhu Jian growled with hostility in his voice the moment they met.

Huang Xiaolong snorted casually as he looked at Zhu Jian’s arm. “You’re pretty healthy… Looks like your arm is alright now.”

Just the day before, Cao Dehong shattered Zhu Jian’s arms. He obviously used a ton of precious herbs to recover after returning.

Killing intent flashed in Zhu Jian’s eyes after he heard what Huang Xiaolong said, “I’ll make you regret your actions soon!”

“I’ll be waiting.” Huang Xiaolong said as a yawn threatened to escape his lips.

Snorting angrily, Zhu Jian wanted to enter the hall. Before they could, a shockingly powerful aura appeared to lock them in their place.

“Cao Dehong, what’s the meaning of this?!” Zhu Jian glared at Cao Dehong and roared.

Ignoring the man, Cao Dehong gestured for Huang Xiaolong to enter the venue. “Lord, please.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded contentedly as he entered the hall. Tao Hang, Cao Dehong, and the others followed closely behind.

Zhu Jian raged in his heart when he saw what had happened.

“Young Master, don’t be angry. They should be here to obtain some treasures. When they bid for the items they want, we can outbid them at every turn.” Zhu Yun whispered into Zhu Jian’s ear.

Suppressing the anger in his heart, Zhu Jian snapped, “Alright, this young master will play them to death later. I refuse to believe that that brat has more money than me!”

The Zhu Family was the strongest power in the Zhu Lan Lands! Their wealth was terrifying! As Zhu Chen’s grandson and Mei Jie’s son, Zhu Jian possessed shocking wealth!

When Huang Xiaolong and the others stepped into the auction venue, Tao Han’er’s adorable voice rang through the air. “Lord, Father, I’m over here!”

Huang Xiaolong and the rest turned to see Tao Han’er walking towards them.

Jian Bifei and the rest of the Jian Family had arrived a long time ago and they were sitting in one of the VIP pavilions.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly and Tao Hang exchanged greetings with her.

As for Jian Bifei, he glared at Huang Xiaolong with killing intent brewing in his eyes.

He seemed to be the only angry one as Huang Xiaolong ignored him completely. He headed over to another VIP pavilion beside the Jian Family. Huang Xiaolong might not be a venerated guest of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, but Cao Dehong was! As the old ancestor of the Cao Family, he was naturally held in high regard by the chamber of commerce. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhu Jian who arrived later didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to know Tao Han’er, and he was shocked to hear the exchange between them!

“That… Is that the princess of the Jian Family?” Zhu Jian asked Zhu Yun.

“Yes, young master.” Zhu Yun replied. “That’s her. It’s said that she was left in the Limitless Lands a long time ago. The Jian Family only managed to locate her after using up a ton of resources. Her talent is extremely good. Lord Jian Wushuang plans to cultivate her into his successor!”

Zhu Jian’s heart trembled slightly. “That brat seems to possess some kind of relationship with her. Do you think that the brat will go crazy if I ask for the Jian Family princess’ hand in marriage during the ceremony in a few days?”
