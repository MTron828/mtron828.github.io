Zhao Chengyu fell into silence for a moment before saying, “What are Lord Archdevil Ancestor’s thoughts?”

The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor paused for a moment before saying, “Go and investigate the power standing behind the Six Nether Gate. Someone who can kill Li Tong and Tian Changyue should be an expert in the Tenth Order Emperor Realm!”

“Yes, Lord Archdevil Ancestor!” Zhao Chengyu replied, but he had another question. “Lord, do we pass down the order to take care of the Six Nether Gate now, or...”

The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor thought about it for a moment and said, “No. We’ll head straight for the Eternal Devil Lands. The Devil Steles should be our main goal. Didn’t you say that the Six Nether Gate will be heading over to the Eternal Devil Lands as well? We’ll wait for them there!” He narrowed his eyes, and killing intent burst out of them. “I don’t care who they are. Since they dared to touch the disciples of my Devil Ape Cult, they will have to die! I want them to die without a proper burial ground!”

Everyone felt their bodies going cold when they heard the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s declaration.

When the Archdevil Ancestors had followed the Archdevil Lord into battle in the past, they had reaped billions of lives. The killing intent born from the blood in his hands was terrifying to the extreme.

His killing intent alone caused many of the present Emperor level experts to feel a suffocating pressure.

No longer hesitating or stopping for a rest, all of them charged straight towards the Eternal Devil Lands.

Before long, Zhao Chengyu managed to obtain some reports about what had happened in Six Nether City.

“Reporting to Lord Archdevil Ancestor, we managed to obtain reports on what happened in Six Nether City.” Zhao Chengyu turned and reported to the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor. “According to what we know, a black-haired man appeared at the Six Nether Gate Headquarters a few days ago. He requested for Gao Changran to receive him personally. Still, he eventually entered the Six Nether Gate Headquarters under the lead of Gao Fan, the young master of the Six Nether Gate.”

“Oh. Black-haired young man...” A frown slowly formed on the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor. “What does he look like? Have you found out his background?”

Zhao Chengyu quickly described Huang Xiaolong’s appearance but shook his head eventually. “We failed to obtain news of his identity, but according to our sources, he was responsible for the deaths of Li Tong and the rest. The only thing I don’t understand is that he is only at the Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.”

“Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor was stunned for a second, and a weird light flashed through his eyes. “It seems as though his identity isn’t as simple as it seems.”

The fact was as clear as day. For an Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch to request for the Chief of the Six Nether Gate to personally receive him, it was evident that he had some sort of backing...

“Is he the personal disciple or son of some old monster in the Devil World?” Zhao Chengyu guessed. “He might also be the young master of some ancient superpower.”

The Devil World had some old fellows who had already secluded themselves from the world. Even if the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor met them, they would be a headache to deal with. Moreover, some ancient superpowers also didn’t want to reveal themselves in the world. Their strength was in no way lesser than the Devil Ape Cult.

The Stone Ape Devil Ancestor’s cold voice sounded out suddenly. “Let them continue to investigate. We have to ascertain that person’s identity as soon as possible. Even if he is the son or personal disciple of those old fogies, they will have to give me an explanation!”

“Yes, Lord Archdevil Ancestor!”

Just when everyone was running about to reveal Huang Xiaolong’s identity, the news of Wu Jingnan’s death started to spread like wildfire. Frigid North City was shaken.

On the Frigid North Continent, a stunning lady sat on the throne of one of the massive palaces. Her every movement brought with it unspeakable charm.

Several tens of experts sat around her, and all of them emitted terrifying auras.

It was obvious that they were all Emperor Realm experts.

“The young master of the Devil Ape Cult was killed?” The beautiful lady opened her mouth in shock when she heard the news.

The Devil Ape Cult ranked fifth among the superpowers in the Devil World. It wasn’t a small matter for their young master to be killed.

“Yes, young lady. The Six Nether Gate did it, and as soon as they killed Wu Jingnan, Li Tong, Tian Chengyue, and the others, they locked down the city and massacred all the disciples of the Devil Ape Cult. Not a single disciple managed to live.” One of the ancestors made the report, and his expression was solemn.

The lady was Xing Yinuo from the Heavenly Punishment Sect. She was the daughter of the strongest Archdevil Ancestor, the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor. She wasn’t just part of the Devil World’s three supreme geniuses, but she was also part of the four great beauties.

A light flashed through her pretty eyes, and she asked. “There is definitely someone backing the Six Nether Gate. Have you found out who it is?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The ancestor sitting beside her shook his head. “We only know that a black-haired man is behind it. No one has managed to dig out his identity.” Following this, he spilled everything they knew about Huang Xiaolong.

The results of their investigation were the same as what the Devil Ape Cult had found out. They only knew that Huang Xiaolong was an Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch. This point alone was enough to prove that his identity wasn’t simple.

“Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch...” Xing Yinuo paused for a moment before continuing, “Even Gao Changran had to kneel before him?”

“That’s right.” Li Yu, the ancestor who had made the report, nodded.

“What about the people from the Devil Ape Cult? What did they do about it?”

“I heard that the leader and Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor have already arrived in Frigid North City. They didn’t stopover at the Six Nether City. They are planning to head straight to the Eternal Devil Lands.” Another ancestor, Wang Zhiqiao, said.

Xing Yinuo raised her eyebrows in surprise.

“Rumors are going around that the Six Nether Gate will be going to the Eternal Devil Lands soon. I’m guessing that the Stone Ape Devil Ancestor is planning to take care of them there.” Li Yu guessed.

Xing Yinuo nodded her head and continued, “In a few days, my father will be arriving at Frigid North City. There are six other Archdevil Ancestors gathered here, including my father. I heard that Qin Hongbao and Chen Weijian are here as well?”

Qin Hongbao and Chen Weijian were the other two supreme geniuses in the Devil World.

Qin Hongbao was the personal disciple of the Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor, and Chen Weijian was the descendant of an ancient superpower, the Hundred Transformation Sect.

If they were to compare their experiences with each other, all three of them would stand on the same line.

“It doesn’t matter how many experts arrive. The Devil Steles will definitely belong to us!” Wang Zhiqiao’s confident voice boomed through the hall.

Afterwhich, the topic returned to the situation on the Frigid North Continent. Eventually, Xing Yinuo passed down the order to dig out Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

Like the Heavenly Punishment Sect, all the superpowers passed down the order to investigate Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

A day passed just like that.

In one of the Six Nether Gate’s secret rooms, Huang Xiaolong saw Gao Changran enter the room during his cultivation session. He had a guilty expression on his face as he stammered, “Your Majesty, this subordinate received news that someone robbed our goods. The Fire Phoenix Divine Armor, Fire Dragon Scorched Heavenly Pills, and Icy Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ship are gone! All the disciples responsible for bringing them back are dead!”

“Your Majesty, please punish me accordingly!”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised that someone had dared to make a move against them. “Have you found out who did it?”

Everything that they had prepared for the trip to the Eternal Devil Lands was stolen!

“According to our investigation, it has something to do with the Silver Devil Sect.” Gao Changran replied with his head lowered.
