In fact, there were numerous deserted islands in the Vientiane World, some with dead air lingering over them. Perhaps those islands used to be like the current Green Cloud Island a hundred thousand years ago, where the human race prospered and countless families, sects, and forces of various sizes once lived.

After being besieged by the sea beasts and sea tribes at one point, the families, sects, and forces of those islands were wiped off, annihilated, and became a full meal inside the sea beasts’ bellies.

“Master, should we go lend a hand?” The little cow inquired.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No need, we need to hurry to the Lin Family Fort instead.” Judging from the situation, this horde of sea beasts wouldn’t get past the Jadeite Kingdom’s army and defenses.

The matter worrying Huang Xiaolong the most was Yao Chi who was currently at the Lin Family Fort.

Merely these sea beasts here couldn’t be considered the true force of their attack. There had to be other places on the Green Cloud Island currently under attack.

Although there was Bing Xingying at Yao Chi’s side, protecting her, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but worry.

Sitting astride on the little cow’s back, Huang Xiaolong directed Xiaoniū onward in the direction of the Lin Family Fort, while the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast followed behind them.

The entire way, Huang Xiaolong met with several groups of sea beasts; small groups consisting of a dozen or so, while the bigger groups reached several thousand.

In less than an hour since Huang Xiaolong left the Jadeite Royal City, he came across a dozen sea beast attack.

Though Huang Xiaolong easily dealt with these sea beasts, his worry toward Yao Chi’s situation at the Lin Family Fort rose exponentially. Moreover, there hadn’t been any reply to the messages he had sent to her through the communication talisman.

Had something already happened to Yao Chi?

Huang Xiaolong became more anxious. No longer cared for the consequences, he called out Bing Jiuyi and had him fly over while bringing him. With Bing Jiuyi’s speed, they could reach the Lin Family Fort in half a day’s time.

As for the group of sea beasts they ran into, they were all frozen into ice statues by Bing Jiuyi.

Hence, it became quite a sight of ice statues falling from the sky.

A little over an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s communication talisman suddenly shook. Huang Xiaolong swiftly took it out from his spatial ring and his divine sense swept over it. After reading the message inside, he breathed out in great relief.

It was a reply from Yao Chi, saying that she was cultivating earlier and had just checked the communication talisman.

Her words had a tinge of sweetness and restlessness as if she was afraid Huang Xiaolong would be upset.

Huang Xiaolong was completely speechless.

However, knowing that Yao Chi was safe and sound, he doesn’t feel as anxious and returned Bing Jiuyi to the Godly Mt. Xumi space. Unless absolutely necessary, he would rather not expose Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du’s existence.

Three days later, when Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at the Lin Family Fort, everything was calm and tranquil, not a single sea beast in sight.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised.

“Young Lord!” Knowing that Huang Xiaolong was coming, Lin Hang had been waiting, so when he saw his figure in the distant, Lin Hang swiftly flew out from the fort to welcome Huang Xiaolong.

“Where’s the Young Miss?” Huang Xiaolong asked, referring to Yao Chi.

“Young Miss is a little tired after cultivating, she’s now soaking in the spiritual pool in the back mountain. I’ll go report to the Young Miss that Young Lord is here.” Lin Hang quickly offered himself for the task.

Soaking in the spiritual pool at the Spiritual Pool Palace!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart thumped loudly in his ears, swiftly stopping Lin Hang, “No need, no need.” He waved Lin Hang away and flew toward the back mountain.

At the Lin Family Fort back mountain, a short distance from the Lin Family Fort, there was a small place named Spiritual Pool Palace that had been built by the Lin Family Fort in the past. The source of the spiritual pool came from the underground Yang Wood spring.

This Yang Wood spiritual energy had healing properties, from nurturing the soul to strengthening one’s body, also beautifying the skin. It was no wonder Yao Chi likes to spend her time soaking at the spiritual pool at the Lin Family Fort back mountain.

While Huang Xiaolong was flying to the back mountain, he couldn’t help picturing the nose-bleeding scene of Yao Chi being fully naked in the spiritual pool.

Inside the crystal clear pool, Yao Chi’s enchanting curves were vaguely showing, her voluptuous breasts, down to her flat stomach...

As his imagination traveled down this path, Huang Xiaolong felt his blood quicken and his throat becoming dry.

Then Huang Xiaolong snapped back to his senses and chided himself, since when had his restraint became so weak? Taking a deep breath in and exhaling, Huang Xiaolong felt his head cleared slightly.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Spiritual Pool Palace.

Standing guard outside the palace main entrance were two maids.

When the two maids saw Huang Xiaolong, they hurried forward in small steps and saluted on their knees.

“On your feet.” After both maids stood up, he had the little cow and the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast wait outside while he alone walked into the Spiritual Pool Palace.

The Spiritual Pool Palace was divided into the outer and inner hall, while the pool was located in the inner hall.

Upon stepping into the front hall, Huang Xiaolong could hear the splashing of water coming from the hall; needless to guess, Yao Chi was bathing inside.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong could only cough dryly several times to alert Yao Chi of his presence.

Seconds elapsed then came Yao Chi’s shy yet sweet voice, “Is it Xiaolong? You... can come in.”

Come in!

Huang Xiaolong’s breath was caught in his chest for a brief moment.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated, albeit less than a second later his feet were already crossing the several meters length of the front hall and into the inner hall. Inside, he saw Yao Chi standing shyly beside the pool, clad in a soft phoenix outer robe.

Her long hair fell softly on her shoulders, still a little damp. The soft phoenix robe clung to her body, accentuating her curves, especially around her decolletage.

Elegant, enchanting, cute yet mature; Huang Xiaolong was dazed as he stood there.

Watching Huang Xiaolong looking at her foolishly, Yao Chi chuckled softly, “It’s not like you haven’t seen me before.”

Huang Xiaolong grinned sheepishly, “That’s because you’re just too beautiful.”

Yao Chi pouted her small sexy mouth, “What about Xiaofei and Li Lu?”

Huang Xiaolong choked, not knowing how to answer the question. Although the saying that ’might is king’ was true anywhere, a powerful cultivator having a few hundred, or even a few thousand women was nothing out of the ordinary. Still, Huang Xiaolong was originally from the modern Earth, thus when Yao Chi asked this question, it was inevitable he felt awkward.

The expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face did not escape Yao Chi, she stepped lightly, coming to Huang Xiaolong’s side. She reached out to hold Huang Xiaolong’s hand saying, “Fool.” So gentle that Huang Xiaolong’s heart melted into a pile of water.

They no longer spoke of the matter, holding hands as they slowly walked out from the inner hall.

Even though they had kissed before, Huang Xiaolong still felt nervous holding Yao Chi’s hand.

After all, in the lower realm, Yao Chi was his Master.

Sensing Huang Xiaolong’s nervousness, Yao Chi let out a peal of laughter, pretending to be offended, “I won’t eat you, what are you being nervous for?”

Huang Xiaolong spontaneously blurted out, “I’m afraid I’ll eat you up.”

Yao Chi froze, her face quickly turned red like an apple, adding to her charm.

Huang Xiaolong even shocked himself. Seconds elapsed and Huang Xiaolong changed the subject, mentioning the sea beast attacks he had seen on Green Cloud Island. “The Highlands Kingdom’s royal city was under siege as well, but our Lin Family Fort is not one of the important cities, we won’t be targeted by the sea beasts for now.”

The Highlands Kingdom wasn’t far away from the Lin Family Fort.

Huang Xiaolong went on telling Yao Chi about the progress of the Reverse Incarnation Pill. When Yao Chi heard that Huang Xiaolong had found more than half of the medicinal herbs, including the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus, she was overjoyed, giving Huang Xiaolong a wet kiss on impulse.

When Huang Xiaolong recovered his senses and prepared to retaliate, Yao Chi had escaped, leaving her laughter ringing in the air.

Huang Xiaolong chased up with a fierce expression.

Giggles and shrieks rang in the back mountain.
