“18, 165 beads!” The Elephant Genesis Sect Chief Pan Jue threw his head back in laughter hearing Zhao Wuya’s answer, then his voice rang in the air. “Good, good, good! When we return to the sect, I and the Ancestor will heavily reward you!”

18, 165!

In Pan Jue’s eyes, with this amount of Crimson Flame Beads, Zhao Wuya was undoubtedly the first place winner of this joint training.

In all previous joint trainings, ten thousand Crimson Flame Beads were enough to secure the first place. Compare that to Zhao Wuya’s current result and it was granted that the first place belonged to him!

Pan Jue didn’t even bother to disguise his happy laughter, therefore, the surrounding disciples as well as the other two sects’ disciples and masters heard his words clearly.

The Great Whale Sect Chief Wuyue’s face turned sullen and ugly. His gaze was fixed on Zhao Wuya’s body, flickering with thick killing intent. Although he was unable to confirm that his nephew Wang Dafeng and Fan Yuan had been killed by Zhao Wuya, he subconsciously believed the killer to be none other than this Zhao Wuya.

Of course, the Barbarian God Sect Chief Gu Ling did look that happy either.

“Sect Chief, Huang Xiaolong is out!” Right at this time, a Grand Elder reminded Gu Ling, shifting his attention.

Gu Ling’s gaze swept over the crowd, locating Huang Xiaolong among the many disciples. Only then did his expression turn slightly better. In this term’s joint training, he was concerned about the Barbarian God Sect’s performance, and at the same time he was also worried about Huang Xiaolong’s safety. Now he saw Huang Xiaolong returning safely from the Ice Hail Ruins, having escaped the Great Whale Sect and Elephant Genesis Sect’s disciples pursuit. This was truly great luck!

Gu Ling watched him approach and salute before he asked Huang Xiaolong about the situation and the events that took place inside the Ice Hail Ruins. At the end, he paused for a moment before asking about his result, “The amount of Crimson Flame Beads you collected, are there at least five thousand?”

Following the past results, five thousand Crimson Flame Beads were enough to enter the top ten.

“Five thousand?” Huang Xiaolong looked dazedly at the nervous Gu Ling for a moment, then nodded, “Yes.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s affirmative answer, a trace of joy rose to Gu Ling’s face. Inwardly, his tense nerves relaxed. The other Grand Elders standing close to him also revealed a smile.

Only Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei wore ugly expressions, especially Cao Yang. Before the joint training started, he had gleefully assumed that Huang Xiaolong was dead for sure once he entered the Ice Hail Ruins, but contrary to his expectation, Huang Xiaolong walked out alive! Not only did he not die, the punk had actually collected at least five thousand Crimson Flame Beads!

Thinking about how Huang Xiaolong would be taking one of the top ten spots, granting him the right to enter the Primordial Celestial Shrine to comprehend the ancestor heritage tablets within, anger burned in his chest.

‘Those useless wastes from Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect!’ Tens of thousands of disciples had been hunting Huang Xiaolong, yet they couldn’t kill one measly inner disciple!

While Cao Yang was fuming in anger, Gu Ling was asking the other disciples about their results, but to his dismay, only three Barbarian God Sect disciple managed to collect at least five thousand Crimson Flame Beads, including Huang Xiaolong!

He felt extremely disappointed with the result.

“Alright now, disciples with five thousand Crimson Flame Beads and above, please come forward for the tabulation and ranking.” At this time, the Elephant Genesis Sect Chief Pan Jue announced.

The three sects took turns leading each term’s joint training, and this time it was the Elephant Genesis Sect’s turn.

At Pan Jue’s announcement, all the three sects’ disciples who managed to collect at least five thousand Crimson Flame Beads flew out, gathering in front of him.

However, counting Huang Xiaolong, there were only twelve disciples from the three sects with that amount of beads.

Three disciples from the Barbarian God Sect, four from the Great Whale Sect, and five disciples from the Elephant Genesis Sect!

Seeing this difference, Gu Ling and the Barbarian God Sect Grand Elders’ expressions darkened. Cao Yang and Huang Junfei, on the other hand, were secretly rejoicing, conversing through sound transmission, “Really unexpected ah, there’s actually twelve disciples from the three sects who managed to gather at least five thousand Crimson Flame Beads! It seems Huang Xiaolong may not make it into the top ten!”

“That’s right, if that kid is squeezed out from the top ten, he won’t be able to enter the Primordial Celestial Shrine.” Zhuang Xuan’s voice interjected into the conversation.

On the other side, Pan Jue had the five Elephant Genesis Sect disciples take out all the Crimson Flame Beads they obtained.

The results were as such, Zhao Wuya ranked first with eighteen thousand one hundred and sixty-five beads, while two of the other four collected over eleven thousand beads; the third disciple had over seven thousand, while the fourth disciple had around six thousand and five hundred Crimson Flame Beads.

Watching the results of the five Elephant Genesis Sect disciples, Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei were blooming inside. The better the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect disciples’ results were, the higher the chances of Huang Xiaolong being squeezed out of the top ten became.

Subsequently, it was time to tabulate the results of the four Great Whale Sect’s disciples.

The highest number of Crimson Flame Beads collected also exceeded eleven thousand. Two disciples were within the range of eight thousand, and the last one was had over six thousand and nine hundred.

This result only fueled Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei’s elation.

If Huang Xiaolong wanted to enter the top then, he needed at least six thousand and five hundred Crimson Flame Beads.

Lastly, it was the Barbarian God Sect disciples’ turn. Due to Huang Xiaolong’s qualification, his result was the first one being tabulated.

Watching Huang Xiaolong stepping up, Pan Jue flashed him a sunny smile, “Huang Xiaolong, it’s been less than three years since you entered the Barbarian God Sect, but you being able to collect more than five thousand Crimson Flame Beads in this joint training really exceeded my expectation.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly at Pan Jue’s hypocrisy, thinking ‘I’m going to exceed that expectation real soon.’ On the surface, there were no changes to Huang Xiaolong’s face as he said, “Sect Chief Pan, can I take out my Crimson Flame Beads for tabulation now?”

Pan Jue nodded, “You can.”

As Gu Ling, Wuyue, Pan Jue, and all three sects’ Grand Elders and disciples’ attention was on Huang Xiaolong, he took out his collection of Crimson Flame Beads.

Instead of taking everything out at once like the others did previously, Huang Xiaolong grouped them into batches of one thousand.

“One thousand.”

“Two thousand.”

“Three thousand.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Every time Huang Xiaolong brought out a batch, the Elephant Genesis Sect Grand Elder in charge of tabulating the results would count loudly.

When Huang Xiaolong took out the sixth batch, the atmosphere suddenly turned abnormally quiet and heavy. All eyes were staring fixedly at him as if they were afraid of missing something.

Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei felt their hearts tighten.

Everyone’s gaze followed Huang Xiaolong’s hands as he took out the seventh batch of Crimson Flame Beads from his Asura Ring.

“Seven thousand!” The Elephant Genesis Sect Grand Elder’s voice was stuck in his throat for the briefest second before shouting.

Seven thousand! The dark clouds over Gu Ling’s face dispersed. Instead, it was Cao Yang’s group that was feeling nervous right now. Seven thousand, that meant Huang Xiaolong was certain to enter the top ten.

Watching Huang Xiaolong taking out the seventh batch, Pan Jue was slightly surprised, then his brows creased in a faint frown.

In this short moment, Huang Xiaolong had taken out the eighth batch of one thousand Crimson Flame Beads from his Asura Ring.

The three sects masters and disciples were dumbfounded right now, they had thought the seventh batch was the last one.

It was actually eight thousand!

“Eight thousand!” The same Grand Elder shouted again.

Just as his voice fell, Huang Xiaolong’s hand took out another one thousand from his Asura Ring.

Everyone’s eyes widened and their mouths were agape.

“Nin-nine t-thousand!” The Elephant Genesis Sect Grand Elder looked at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief, and so did everyone else.
