Chapter 3625 – Entering Bewilderment Island

Bi Luo tried to hold Bi Shifei back, “Grand Elder, listen to me! Haizhou tried killing the man first!”

He was quickly interrupted by Bi Shifei, “If you try stopping me, I’ll cripple you along with him.”

Bi Luo’s expression changed slightly.

When Bi Shifei approached Huang Xiaolong, he growled, “Even though we were ordered to avoid causing trouble with the Human Race, no one can save you today. Not even if the king of the Ocean Race comes, you’ll be leaving your life behind!”

After he spoke, rays of jade-colored light surrounded his body and he started to transform into his true form as a giant blue whale.

Members of the Ocean Race could transform themselves to look like a human, but they could also return into a half-beast half-human form after activating their bloodline.

When Bi Shifei transformed, giant spikes grew out from his limbs. His mouth grew in size until it rivaled the size of an actual whale’s.

“I’ll use my poison spikes to tear through your dao soul and dao heart! You’ll die a miserable death!” Bi Shifei snorted before rushing towards Huang Xiaolong. The spikes around his body started to glow a sinister dark blue color.

The Jade Whale Race boasted the most terrifying poison in the Sleepless Sea. There wasn’t a need to speak about how scary the poison was when unleashed by a God of Creation!

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to grab Bi Shifei’s bone spike. When the inky blue poison seeped through his skin, Huang Xiaolong was completely unaffected.

Bi Shifei, Bi Luo, and Bi Xi were stunned to see that Huang Xiaolong didn’t react to the poison.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong flicked his wrist. The bone spike in his hand snapped into two as Bi Shifei was sent flying. When he crashed into the wall, another giant hole formed. However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t as light handed when it came to Bi Shifei. He didn’t stop when he crashed into the wall. Instead, Bi Shifei was sent flying out of the city.

He was reduced into a pile of bloody flesh outside the city and like his son, the meridians in his body were torn to shreds. His dao heart was shattered and the great world in his body was in shambles. Huang Xiaolong crippled him completely.

“It might be a good thing to listen to other people before you try anything stupid.” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

If Bi Shifei listened to Bi Luo, he might not have been reduced to a cripple.

Turning to look at the headquarters of the Jade Whale Race, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Do you want to try shattering my dao heart?”

No one responded to his challenge.

“Seems like you don’t plan to do anything.” Huang Xiaolong sneered before leaving.

Crossing the city, he quickly departed.

After he left, an old expert glared into the distance with rage eating at his heart. Killing intent clouded his mind as he clenched his fists tightly together. Despite his anger, he chose to remain silent.

The old expert was Bi Haizhou’s ancestor and he was a half step Universe God. He crossed the 10 billion units mark and was ranked among the top ten in the Jade Whale Race.

Bi Luo also looked at the direction where Huang Xiaolong left.

…

After leaving, Huang Xiaolong went straight towards the Bewilderment Island. He crossed several other cities, but nothing noteworthy happened. In several days, he saw the island sitting before him.

The Bewilderment Island was a massive land mass that stood at the bottom of the Sleepless Sea.

In the distance, it looked like a giant blue city that existed at the bottom of the ocean.

Faint blue rays could be seen around it. Even with his dao eye and dao souls, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t tell anything that existed on the island.

Standing there silently, Huang Xiaolong eventually decided to enter the island.

As soon as he did, he noticed the entire world around him turning blue.

It was as though he entered a separate world. His dao souls felt as though they were trapped in a quagmire, unable to extend out of his body even the slightest bit. His head also started to spin.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

Was that the illusory restrictions contained in the Bewilderment Island?

Activating the Star Dragon Divine Tree, a pillar of starlight covered his body. With the additional help, Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls finally managed to awaken.

Every single one of the thirteen universe treasures contained a mythical power. The universe origin fires had the power to refine everything while getting rid of all types of frosty qi. The Star Dragon Divine Tree had the ability to focus one’s mind while strengthening one’s dao soul. That was the reason Huang Xiaolong had the guts to enter the island.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t confident in his willpower. Even half step Universe Gods would be trapped within for countless years, much less himself. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When Huang Xiaolong regained his clarity, he started to fly towards the core of the island. However, he flew slowly as he observed everything that went on around him.

All of a sudden, a ray of light shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

The light was similar to the glow that covered the Bewilderment Island, but it was extremely stealthy. If ordinary God of Creation Realm experts were not careful, they wouldn’t be able to discover it. Of course, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary weakling. He noticed it instantly, and he saw a little bug in the middle of the light ray.

The tiny bug looked grotesque. It emitted a sharp cry when it was caught by Huang Xiaolong before trying to struggle free. It was too bad it was turned into dust when Huang Xiaolong pinched it slightly.

The bug was a special leech that existed in the Bewilderment Island. The poison in its body had the same effects as the formations in the island. One would hallucinate when they were bitten, and the leeches could hide in one’s body. It would feed on one’s grand cosmos energy, seriously affecting one’s strength.

That was why the leeches were terrifying.

They could devour more than ten thousand years worth of accumulation in a single day!

After crushing the bug, Huang Xiaolong continued on his way.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong left the region covered in light before arriving on a green pasture.

The green was mesmerizing, but Huang Xiaolong knew that there was a more terrifying creature than the leeches located on the plains. They were called Death Locust and they were pretty terrifying.

They could feed on one’s bloodline after invading one’s body.

No one would be afraid of the Death Locusts if they were at their peak condition as they could get rid of the bugs whenever they liked. However, that wasn’t the case if their dao soul was confused.

Unwilling to let his guard down, Huang Xiaolong used the power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree once again. He transformed the entire space into the Star Dragon Space before entering.
