Chapter 3234: Returning to Earth

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t cried in too long. The unfamiliar feeling of tears streaming down his face caught him off guard, but he knew that even the strongest of men couldn’t hold back their tears. No longer holding back his emotions, he allowed the tears to stream down his face.

After arriving at his current level of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong’s understanding of the world had already changed.

“There’s no need to worry about me. I’m fine.” Huang Long reassured him, “You grew up faster than I imagined. It seems like you managed to form three small worlds in your body when you broke through in the past?”

Nodding his head, a smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Yes, I managed to create three small worlds.”

Others might not understand the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s special growth, but Huang Xiaolong understood that his current achievements were due to Huang Long’s painstaking efforts.

“Other than the Soaring Dragon Art, you managed to cultivate the Blazing Dragon Grand Art?!” A ray of golden light shot into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

A chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Yes, father, the Blazing Dragon is my master.” He quickly spoke about the part where the old dragon took him in as a disciple before changing the topic to talk about the Pangu Axe.

A gratified smile formed on Huang Long’s face. “It’s good that the old dragon is protecting you. With him around, I don’t have to worry about you any longer. Also, there’s a reason behind your appearance on Earth.”

“Do you mean that the Pangu Axe is located on earth?!” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled and he yelped in shock.

Nodding slowly, Huang Long sighed, “That’s right. However, I have no idea where the exact location of the axe is. You will need to locate it yourself. One will have to rely on fate if they wish to obtain a treasure of that level. No matter how hard I tried in the past, I failed to find the axe.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Even you failed to locate the axe?”

“Even if I didn’t manage to find it, you might be able to. Pangu mentioned that one wouldn’t need to use grand cosmos energy if they wished to discover the Pangu Axe. Neither did they have to possess the power of dao souls!”

Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of helplessness forming in his heart.

“I wonder what Lord Creation, Pangu, means by that… Is he trying to look for someone with a strong will?”

That was a possibility.

Huang Long continued, “Probably… No one knows what that weird fellow is thinking. However, one can be sure that only talented individuals can locate the Pangu Axe. He’s extremely particular about one’s talent. I probably wasn’t talented enough, or it might be because I have already entered the God of Creation Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock.

“There’s no need for you to worry. With your talent, there is no way for you to fail to meet Pangu’s expectations” Huang Long continued, “Not to mention the fact that you haven’t entered the God of Creation Realm yet. As long as you return to earth and begin your search, you will definitely be able to find the axe.”

Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Father, you can rest assured that I will definitely locate the axe. When I enter the grand perfection level of the God of Creation Realm, I’ll save you!”

“Go on. I believe in you.” Huang Long chuckled. “There’s no need for you to worry about me. It won’t be easy for Huang Sheng to devour my blood essence.”

Staring at Huang Long with a reluctant gaze, Huang Xiaolong turned to leave. Entering the tunnel, he disappeared in an instant.

Not too long after he left, a golden robed young man appeared in the space above Huang Long. When he raised his hand, the universe bent to his will. A deep gaze could be seen in his eyes, and nothing could hide from him. He seemed to be able to peer through time and space itself, and a suspicious look could be seen on his face when he looked all around.

The person who appeared was precisely Huang Sheng!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had the Soul Burying Orb and didn’t stay for a long time, Huang Sheng managed to feel that something was wrong. After surveying the space around him, he glared at Huang Long and snapped, “Huang Long, you better behave yourself. Otherwise, your life will turn into a living hell!”

Roaring with laughter, Huang Long ignored the man.

“What are you laughing at?!” Huang Sheng turned to stare at Huang Long in contempt. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“You won’t be able to get your way for much longer.” Huang Long sneered.

“You will be able to see the day where I devour your bloodline and power. On that day, I will surpass the God of Creation Realm. I will turn into the true ruler of the universe!” Huang Sheng snorted.

“Relax. You won’t get so far.”

…

When Huang Xiaolong returned to the Blazing Dragon World, he felt a mountain weighing on his heart.

The old dragon didn’t say a word as he took his leave. He knew that Huang Xiaolong needed some time alone.

He only returned three days later.

“Master, I plan on heading over to the Pangu World in a few days.” Huang Xiaolong mentioned the moment the old dragon showed up.

Seemingly unprepared for such a sudden decision, the old dragon raised an eyebrow in shock. “That’s quick…”

Nodding slowly, Huang Xiaolong continued, “I plan to leave in a few days.” After his meeting with his father, he wanted nothing more than to look for the Pangu Axe.

When he obtained the Pangu Axe, his cultivation would increase yet again. When his third world accumulated 1.299999 billion units of grand cosmos energy, it would be time for him to enter the God of Creation Realm!

He would become the God of Creation, Huang Xiaolong!

The old dragon looked at Huang Xiaolong and sighed, “Alright. You won’t be able to hide forever. Even though locating the axe would waste quite some time, you will be able to make up for all the time you lost after training the Pangu World Creation Art! Perhaps finding the axe would be even better than entering seclusion!”

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had reached a bottleneck. He had to locate the Pangu Axe if he wanted to ascend, but he didn’t plan on explaining everything to the old dragon.

“With your strength, you can probably sweep the entire Pangu World along. However, you need to be careful of a single person.”

“Are you talking about Hong Jun?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

In the legends of the Pangu World, Hong Jun was the teacher of all saints. He supported the heavens on his own, and he was the strongest individual under Pangu!

“That’s right.” The old dragon nodded. “Hong Jun has already entered the God of Creation Realm, and he’s the second God of Creation after Pangu.” Soon after, the old dragon spoke of several other matters.

Noting everything down, Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless.

In the next few days, the old dragon clarified any doubts Huang Xiaolong had with his cultivation. He wasn’t the oldest God of Creation for nothing. He knew practically everything, and Huang Xiaolong felt his road ahead clearing up with the help of the old dragon.

Before he returned to Earth, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Huang Family to visit Shi Xiaofei and the others.

After several more days, he left the Blazing Dragon World.

The Pangu World was located quite a distance away from the Blazing Dragon World, and it was several times the distance between the Huang Long World and the Blazing Dragon World! In the past, he took several tens of thousands of years to travel to the Blazing Dragon World, but with his current speed, it would only take him a year to arrive at the Pangu World!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother using the Purple Lightning Peak. Instead, he used his fleshy body to soar through the space. At his current realm, he was much faster than the Purple Lightning Peak.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong would refine the Sun Moon Furnace and the Purple Lightning Peak with his grand cosmos energy. Even though their hopes of becoming a creation artifact was slim to none, Huang Xiaolong believed that with enough dedication, there would come a day when they did.
