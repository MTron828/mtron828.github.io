“Lord Sea God, we will reach Vientiane World in two days with our current speed!” Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da commented to Feng Yingying. Bloodthirst and excitement glimmered in his eyes as he said that!

Jun’er, we’ll be back in Vientiane World soon! Huang Xiaolong would soon accompany you!

You won’t be lonely!

Feng Yingying merely nodded; Huang Xiaolong’s figure inexplicably appeared in her mind.

The scenes where Huang Xiaolong had defeated Guo Jun in the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony flashed in front of her eyes. She shook her head and sighed inwardly, ‘Unfortunately, Huang Xiaolong was not someone she could use!’

It would have been wonderful if she could have made Huang Xiaolong her male slave...

......

Huang Xiaolong rushed through the door the moment he arrived at the Brimming Snow Palace. His heart ached when he saw Li Lu lying comatose on the cold jade bed with her pallid complexion.

“Li Lu!” Huang Xiaolong cried out, his voice a little hoarse. In a few large strides, he reached Li Lu’s side and held her hand.

“Careful!” Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor shouted in unison as they arrived right behind Huang Xiaolong.

They very well knew the strength of the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body—a tiny amount of the evil spirit’s nefarious qi could render a high-level Ancestor God Realm comatose, ending up like Li Lu.

Even so, their warning came a bit too late, as Huang Xiaolong was already holding Li Lu’s hands.

The moment Huang Xiaolong touched Li Lu’s hand, a piercing shriek sounded from the inside of her body. Ripples of green light surfaced over Li Lu’s body and flowed into Huang Xiaolong through his hand.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor ashened at this sight.

Black Ice Ancestor arrived just in time to witness this. A spark of delight shone in the depths of her eyes when she saw the green light seeping into Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

Everyone was gripped by panic as they thought that Huang Xiaolong would be entangled by the evil spirit, but an aureate suddenly burst from between his brows. Waves of chaos lightning qi which was invisible to Golden Brow Ancestor and others rushed throughout Huang Xiaolong’s entire body. In a split second, a green light was expelled out from his body before it disappeared. At the same time, the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body let out scream full of screeching pain; it was clearly injured.

This unexpected result surprised Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestors, and the others.

‘What’s going on?’ Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The little cow’s eyes glimmered when she saw the green light emitting from Li Lu’s body.

Huang Xiaolong was a little startled seeing the green light from Li Lu’s body. Is this the evil spirit inside her body? When he thought of this, he became excited. Did the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s chaos lightning qi expel the evil spirit’s nefarious qi just now?!

If that’s the case, then...?

But he remembered that he still wasn’t able to the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation with his current strength! Hence, he was unable to manipulate the chaos lightning qi!

Huang Xiaolong’s bright eyes dimmed almost immediately.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was obvious to all. Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were about to say something, but before they could say anything, Huang Xiaolong suddenly turned around and asked the little cow, “Xiaoniu, do you have a way to expel the evil spirit from Li Lu’s body?”

The little cow stepped forward with her head swaying as she spoke, “There is, but it’s a little troublesome. This evil spirit is likely to be the ancient nefarious nightmare soul!”

“Ancient nefarious nightmare soul?” Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed.

Though Huang Xiaolong didn’t know anything about the nefarious nightmare soul, he could tell that it was going to be a very difficult task to expel this soul if the little cow had said so.

“Xiaolong, our Fortune Gate headquarters’ Fortune Divine Artifact is capable of suppressing all godforce, along with suppressing and eliminating all evil spirits and phantoms. If we can borrow the Fortune Divine Artifact, and have a high-level God King Realm master to activate it, then we can suppress and eliminate the evil spirit and nefarious qi from Li Lu’s body!” Golden Brow Ancestor interjected.

“However, it is impossible for us to borrow that Fortune Divine Artifact with our identities. Only the headquarters’ Gate Chief and Ancestors are eligible to use it!” Blood Knife Ancestor chimed in. “Moreover, where are we going to find a high-level God King Realm master?”

Fortune Divine Artifact?

Huang Xiaolong pondered slightly and asked the little cow again, “This nefarious nightmare soul, is it very powerful?”

The little cow nodded in affirmation, and added, “Yes, it is very powerful. It’s the undispersed soul of an ancient Nefarious Nightmare Tribe’s tribesman, formed after several million years of absorbing nefarious energy. The stronger the nefarious nightmare soul is, the more powerful it is. Once it possesses a victim, it strives to merge with the victim’s godhead, and gradually devour the victim’s souls. Finally it takes over the victim’s body and turns it into an evil creature!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression changed greatly.

If it was really as the little cow had said, then the moment Li Lu’s soul gets devoured, would she turn into an evil creature? Once that happens, will there be no chance for Li Lu to recover at all?!

The little cow continued, “This nefarious nightmare soul in front of us has the strength of a mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. If it wasn’t for Li Lu’s emperor rank Yin Yang Godhead, and resilient soul, her soul would have been devoured clean by this time. However, Li Lu won’t be able to last very long. The duration and the intervals of her unconscious spells are getting longer with each time she falls into a coma after waking up, am I right?”

“At first, Li Lu could wake up once every day, but now, she remains unconscious for the duration of half a month.” Myriad Flames Ancestor nodded.

Myriad Flames Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor and the others were inwardly thinking, ‘Even we couldn’t recognize the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body despite our identities, then how come this cow knows that it’s the nefarious nightmare soul?’

What is this cow’s origin?

“How long can Li Lu last?” Huang Xiaolong asked the little cow anxiously.

“Six years at the most!” The little cow answered.

“What, only six years?!” Huang Xiaolong gritted his teeth to keep calm.

“All of you go out, I have something to talk to Xiaolong.” The little cow said to Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and the others.

Black Ice Ancestor sneered, “You want us to go out? Who do you think you are?!”

Huang Xiaolong looked piercingly at Black Ice Ancestor.

Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others also glared sharply at Black Ice Ancestor. At the receiving end of several piercing gazes, Black Ice Ancestor could actually sense death looming over her head.

In the end, Black Ice Ancestor obediently adhered to the little cow and went out following behind Blood Knife Ancestor, Zhu Yi, and other Ancestors. Outside, she was slightly panting and looked a little pale.

After everyone had exited the room, the little cow erected a soundproof barrier over the room, then said to Huang Xiaolong, “In truth, you don’t need to feel anxious, since your Senior Xiaoniu is here. Your little darling is going to be alright!”

Hearing the little cow was still in a mood to joke, he slapped her head and scolded, “Speak quickly.”

The little cow shook her head, and she continued nonchalantly, “In fact, you’ve already guessed the way to help your little darling. You can use your chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s chaos lightning qi to eliminate that nefarious nightmare soul.”

Huang Xiaolong said gloomily, “You know that I will be able to control the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation only after reaching high-level Ancestor God Realm!” If everything were to go as he had estimated, it was something that would probably happen a hundred years later.

But Li Lu can’t wait so long.

“If you could feed Li Lu a God King Realm Buddhist cultivator’s Buddha Pellet, it could suppress that evil spirit and ensure her condition won’t deteriorate any further.” The little cow said straightforwardly.

“You mean, if we have the Buddha Pellet, Li Lu can wait until I breakthrough to high-level Ancestor God Realm, and control the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation to expel that evil spirit?!” Huang Xiaolong was a little overwhelmed by the rising hope over the horizon.
