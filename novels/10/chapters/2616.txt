Chapter 2617: Suppression of Four Races

While they went about doing their own things, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo returned to the Chaos Essence Holy Peak. However, they sensed something wrong as soon as they returned.

The mountain peak was too quiet.

In the past, there were traces of living beings no matter how quiet the mountain peak seemed. Right now, it seemed as though the entire area was covered in death qi.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to scout out the mountain peak with his holy souls. A trace of surprise flashed across his face. The disciples of the Chaos Essence Holy Peak were gone!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

Is this a sign that a storm is coming?

The disciples who left the Chaos Essence Holy Peak were obviously running away from the impending storm.

Narrowing his eyes, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before deciding to return to his cultivation cave.

…

Standing on the platform outside the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave, Huang Xiaolong stared at the rolling clouds under his feet.

He had already devoured Yuan Changyao’s saint attributes, and he had crippled the other party’s holy soul previously. There was no way the Myriad Race Race would let him off easily.

In fact, Yuan Qianxing might personally move against him.

“Yuan Qianxing…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

With his current strength, he knew that he was no match for the man. As such, Huang Xiaolong had to increase his strength as quickly as he could.

Dao Gate!

As long as he could enter the Dao Gate and comprehend the grand dao contained within, he would be able to receive the assistance of the grand dao! His powers would take a huge leap forward, and he would definitely enter the Third Heaven True Saint Realm!

However, he knew the difficulties of comprehending all ten thousand strands of grand dao. After all, even someone at Yuan Qianxing’s level had only managed to comprehend 9,326 strands. Can I surpass that?

Huang Xiaolong really didn’t know the answer to the question.

It was a pity he hadn’t managed to evolve his saint godheads into the top ten ranks during the competition. Despite devouring Yuan Changyao’s saint attributes, he had only managed to advance his saint godheads by a little bit. It was still quite a distance away from the tenth rank. If he wanted to comprehend the Dao Gate, pushing his saint godheads into the top ten ranks would allow him to obtain the highest chance of success.

In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.

There were only three days left until the opening of the Dao Gate, but a terrifying aura descended on Huang Xiaolong. No, instead of saying that it descended on Huang Xiaolong, the horrifying pressure covered the Chaos Essence Holy Peak.

With no hesitation, Huang Xiaolong smashed his way out of the courtyard with Hei Luo.

It was too bad he slammed into a barrier as soon as he arrived in the air above the courtyard.

Primal Ancestor Grand Formation?!

That is the power only Primal Ancestors hold!

In the distance, a group of people slowly made their way over as they were led by a youngster who had his hands clasped behind his back. Even Grand Hall Master Yuan Wangfeng had to follow behind the young man obediently.

Yuan Qianxing!

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils shrank when he noticed the killing intent rolling off Yuan Qianxing’s body.

Even though he knew that Yuan Qianxing would move against him, he hadn’t expected the man to arrive so quickly! Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had never expected him to move in broad daylight!

This time, nearly everyone from the Myriad Origin Race, Twin Dragon Race, and the Golden Buddha Race came. Huang Xiaolong even caught sight of Zi Yutong, the beautiful lady who was sent flying with a single slap from Hei Luo. Despite the injuries she had sustained the other day, she was fully recovered now. Moreover, the seductive smile on her face was still present.

Ignoring everyone else, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on the person beside her, Chan Wuwo.

Core disciples of the Golden Buddha Race belonged to two clans, and they were split into the Chan and Jin clans. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Of course, Huang Xiaolong noticed someone other than the young masters of the Myriad Origin Race and the Golden Buddha Race. His attention turned to another young man, and the man in question looked too pretty to be a man.

He was Yao Ji, one of the four Mansion Master candidates from the Enchantress Race!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but wonder if they were there to kill him before he could continue to wreak havoc in the Otherworldly Mansion. After all, their lineup was too luxurious.

With three candidates making a move on him, Long Shengtian wouldn’t be able to criticize them in the slightest. Moreover, Long Shengtian was already finding it difficult to suppress Yuan Qianxing in the Otherworldly Mansion due to the man’s superior talent.

However, Yuan Qianhang had underestimated Huang Xiaolong if he was only prepared to deal with Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads.

Very quickly, the group arrived on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak.

“Huang Xiaolong, we meet again,” the first to speak wasn’t Yuan Qianxing, and it was Long Zhenyang of the Twin Dragon Race.

“Let me guess. You’re extremely anxious now that we’re here. You must be thinking of a way to escape right now! Hahaha! You’re dreaming if you think that you can leave. We have already sealed off a hundred million miles with this mountain as the center. With the Primal Ancestor Dao Artifacts we used to seal off the area, you won’t be able to escape. No one will be able to save you now! Not even my fourth uncle will be able to make it in time!”

Long Zhenyang stared at Huang Xiaolong gleefully.

Huang Xiaolong ignored him as he turned to Yuan Qianxing. “Do you really think your current lineup is enough to kill me?”

“Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that your bodyguard will be able to save you? His Highness Yuan Qianxing, and the others are definitely capable of holding that bodyguard of yours back! You’re definitely going to die today!”

The four races really went all out in their attempt to suppress Huang Xiaolong.

When Zi Yutong thought about how she was flung away after Hei Luo had grabbed her breasts, anger welled up in her heart once again.

Chan Wuwo glared at Huang Xiaolong, and he sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, even if Senior Brother Yuan Qianxing acts alone, he will be able to suppress that bodyguard of yours! We were planning to kill you, but Senior Brother Yuan Qianhang felt that you were too talented to be killed.”

“If you kneel and promise to serve our races as the lowest of slaves, we will spare your life! Of course, you will have to hand over your bodyguard too!”

“Not to worry. We shall give you a minute to make your decision.”

That was the final plan they could come up with. If Huang Xiaolong submitted, that would be the best case scenario. After all, Huang Xiaolong’s bodyguard was a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Corpse. With Huang Xiaolong’s undead spirits and ghosts, they would definitely suffer if they had to take him down with force.

Yuan Qianxing didn’t speak, and he merely stared at Huang Xiaolong. If the other party dared to disagree, he would move immediately!

A sneer formed on his lips when Huang Xiaolong heard Chan Wuwo’s ‘suggestion’. It seemed as though he finally had a reason to conduct a mansion-wide massacre to upgrade his saint godheads! The timing couldn’t be better!
