Chapter 2328: Three Beauties of the Clear Snow Palace

“That’s right.” Chen Kaiping laughed, “Back when Senior Brother Li Chen comprehended the eleventh sacred stele, there were countless disciples from the Clear Snow Palace and Holy Lands Alliance who challenged him. I’m sure they will do the same with Huang Xiaolong”

Li Chen nodded, “The disciples should be instructed by their seniors from their factions to challenge us. There’s no way any sane person will challenge us in front of the Primal Ancestors during the apprenticeship ceremony.”

Lin Jiayi laughed, “Whatever the case, I hope the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace will attend the ceremony. It’s been too long since I last saw Junior Sister Ji Xinyi!”

The three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace were Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and Lin Xiaoying!

Not only were they the most beautiful female disciples in the younger generation, but they were also the most talented! It was only natural that they were goddesses of all the Holy Princes in the Holy World!

“In my view, only Senior Brother Li Chen is worthy of Tan Juan!” Xie Yao said.

Tan Juan was known as the leader of the beauties and even people like Li Chen had their eyes on her.

Chen Kaiping laughed, “Wrong. In the Holy World, only Tan Juan is worthy to marry Senior Brother Li Chen!”

“Yes, yes, yes! I was wrong!” Xie Yao laughed as he continued, “I misspoke! They are simply a match made in heaven!”

The other core disciples roared in agreement as well.

Li Chen waved his hand and smiled, “It’s fine to make jokes like these in front of me. However, you can’t make such jokes in front of Junior Sister Tan Juan a year later at the apprenticeship ceremony.”

Lin Jiayi laughed, “Look at him! Senior Brother Li Chen, rumour has it that you met her in the Profound River in the past! You even managed to save her life!”

“That’s right! Senior Brother Li Chen, tell us about how you rescued a damsel in distress.” Chen Kaiping and the others urged.

Li Chen smiled to himself and explained, "Please stop making a fool of yourselves. Junior Sister Tan Juan was fighting with a profound beast, and I merely helped her in passing. With her strength, she would have killed it either way. There’s nothing going on between us.”

However, none of them believe Li Chen and roaring laughter could be heard in the air.

......

Huang Xiaolong sat inside one of the secret rooms inside the Holy Heavens Manor and circulated his Holy Mandate Imprint. He could feel the difference in the effects of one night of cultivation!

That was one of the biggest benefits of being a Holy Prince in the Holy Heavens.

“Xiaolong!” All of a sudden, Di Huai’s voice came from outside the secret room.

Huang Xiaolong emerged without hesitation.

“Xiaolong, the Holy Heavens made the announcement that you would be accepted by all four Primal Ancestors as their joint personal disciple!” Di Huai couldn’t control himself, and he jumped in joy, “The apprenticeship ceremony would be held a year later!”

As someone who had discovered his talent and brought Huang Xiaolong to the Holy Heavens, Di Huai was filled with pride and excitement. Of course, that was even more so when he realized that Huang Xiaolong would become a disciple of all four supreme beings of the organization!

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he saw the look of excitement on Di Huai’s face. “Is that it?”

Di Huai was startled as a bitter smile appeared on his face, “It’s an honor to be accepted by even one of the supreme beings, but you’re going to be accepted by all four of them!”

“Since I comprehended all twelve sacred steles, according to the rules of the Holy Heavens, I should be accepted as their disciple.” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “There’s nothing surprising about it!” He then changed the subject and asked Di Huai about some matters after joining the Holy Heavens.

For example, he asked about the benefits of becoming a joint personal disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, but Di Huai was naturally unable to provide him with an explanation.

“Oh right, if I remember correctly, you will be able to make a request to the four ancestors during the ceremony.” Di Huai suddenly said.

“Really?” Huang Xialong asked.

Di Huai laughed, “It’s true. During Li Chen’s apprenticeship ceremony in the past, Lord Long allowed him to raise a request. Do you have something in mind?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and revealed, “Fire and Ice Lake!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After learning from Di Huai about the existence of the lake, Huang Xiaolong had been thinking of ways to get a chance to cultivate in it!

After cultivating in the Emperor Yu Holy Grounds, he had managed to transform part of his soul into a holy soul. Now, he needed to borrow the Fire and Ice Lake to complete its transformation.

Of course, there were rules set by the Holy Heavens. One would only be allowed access if they managed to enter the top three ranks in the Holy Prince contest. With his current strength, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know how long it would take for him to obtain a high ranking.

“Fire and Ice Lake?” Di Huai was startled, “Even though cultivating in it will be beneficial for you, are you sure you don’t want to ask for something else? For example, you can ask for a primal artifact! You can even choose to enter the treasury of the Holy Heavens to choose whatever you desire!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled, “I want to enter the Fire and Ice Lake!”

Even though a primal artifact was good, the most important thing he had to do was to obtain a holy soul.

A completed holy soul was worth much more than a primal artifact to him right now.

There was no doubt that the Devil Palace would have received news of his comprehension of the twelve sacred steles. They would stop at nothing to kill him. However, if he managed to transform his divine soul into a holy soul, he wouldn’t have to worry about their schemes any longer! At the very least, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be afraid of True Saints!

When Di Huai saw Huang Xiaolong’s insistence to enter the lake, he didn’t try to dissuade him any longer. Instead, he thought of something else. “There’s another thing you should take note of. The disciples of the Clear Snow Palace and the Holy Lands Alliance will probably ask to spar with you during the ceremony.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second.

Di Huai nodded his head, “Yes, during Li Chen’s ceremony of apprenticeship, many disciples from Clear Snow Palace and Holy Lands Alliance requested to exchange pointers with him. They will probably send a disciple with cultivation realm similar to yours to challenge you.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and frowned. It looks like I must prepare thoroughly for the ceremony.

Even though he had the Holy Mandate Imprint to boost his combat ability, his saint attributes were really too weak!

However, it was impossible for him to devour so many saint attributes in such a short amount of time!

If he wanted to hunt the disciples of the Devil Palace, he wouldn’t be able to locate too many of them in a single year!

Moreover, leaving the Holy Heavens was too dangerous.

All of a sudden, a light flashed through his eyes. He thought about the Devil Cave that imprisoned tons of criminals from the Devil Palace in the Holy Heavens City.

There was a rule that stated that disciples of the Holy Heavens could enter the cave to improve their battle capabilities!

If he accidentally killed several criminals in the process, there wouldn’t be any problems, and the Holy Heavens wouldn’t pursue the matter.

Huang Xiaolong made a decision in his heart.

There should be quite a number of them in the high-level Venerable Realm, right? After all, the foundations of the devil cave have spanned for billions of years.
