Chapter 2928: Only Dumb*sses Will Believe Such a Rumor!

Everyone present heard of Huang Xiaolong, and all of them did so through the battle in Monarch Yu Sacred Land.

Who was Xuanyuan Potian?! He was one of the two tigers of the Divine Tuo Holy World, and he had ten high-order Saint Fates! He was a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable, but a little brat at the Primal Ancestor Realm sent him packing!

The stories said that Xuanyuan Potian was sent flying several million miles, and he rolled across the ground till his face was full of dirt!

The creeds and any superpower in the Divine Tuo Holy World that had the slightest bit of power trembled when they heard the news.

Huang Xiaolong might have been in seclusion when he refined the armor, but his reputation didn’t suffer in the slightest. If anything, he became even more famous!

“Isn’t Huang Xiaolong a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor? How can he send Xuanyuan Potian flying with a single kick?!”

“Xuanyuan Potian and Bi Ye were both sent flying! The three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World were there to watch what happened!”

“Isn’t Huang Xiaolong a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor?”

Discussions broke out in the crowd.

The rumors of the battle might have spread far and wide, but there were only disciples of the Dragon Fish Creed present during the battle in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land. The experts of other factions didn’t believe what they were told. After all, Huang Xiaolong might be talented, but talent didn’t translate to strength. Even with eleven high-order Saint Fates, three dao souls, and the ability to wield cosmos energy, they would rather die than to believe that Huang Xiaolong could take down the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable, Bi Ye.

“The Xuanyuan Dao Venerable will definitely appear during the Creation Ceremony, but Huang Xiaolong dares to show his face here. Isn’t he seeking death?!”

“The Xuanyuan Dao Venerable isn’t the only one coming. There are tons of people planning to kill Huang Xiaolong, and there are rumors going around that even His Highness, Huang Shuai, is planning to make a move! Huang Xiaolong killed too many disciples of the Dragon Fish Creed, including Yu Zhou, the disciple of Enforcement Hall Master, Zhu Hui! If they refuse to deal with him, they would be sullying the reputation of the Dragon Fish Creed!”

Everyone pointed at Huang Xiaolong and cursed him behind his back.

“Young Master Huang…” Zhang Wen and the others revealed cheerful smiles when they approached him, “We have been waiting for you.”

Huang Xiaolong returned the greeting.

Just as they were about to invite him into the Mystical Pavilion, a haughty voice rang through the skies. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re said to be an unbeatable experience! Let me test if that rumor is true!”

All of them couldn’t help but stop in their tracks. Turning around, a middle-aged lunk with a square face and a big mouth stood before him.

“It’s Zhou Xingyu of the Lifeless Creed! He’s said to be a mid-Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable!”

“Zhou Xingyu of the Lifeless Creed? I’ve heard that the blood of the Golden Phoenix flows through his veins. He has an undying dao physique, and his dao soul ranks in the top ten! His combat prowess is terrifying, and even Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t dare to fight him!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What?! Golden Phoenix Bloodline?! Undying Dao Physique?!”

Everyone around them was taken aback.

The Golden Phoenix Bloodline was one of the strongest bloodlines in the Divine Tuo Holy World. It wasn’t any weaker than Xuanyuan Potian’s Lightning Tiger Bloodline. His Undying Dao Physique was also one of the top thirty grand dao physiques in the Divine Tuo Holy World!

Casually glancing at Zhou Xingyu, Huang Xiaolong asked. “Are you sure you wish to fight me?”

He knew what Zhou Xingyu was thinking of. If he managed to defeat Huang Xiaolong in front of so many experts, his reputation would soar.

It seemed as though the man was extremely confident in his own strength. He knew that Bi Ye of the Xuanyuan Creed suffered in Huang Xiaolong’s hands, but he was still willing to try.

“That’s right.” Zhou Xingyu nodded before raising his head to physically look down on Huang Xiaolong. He was clearly belittling the other party, and he felt that the rumors of Huang Xiaolong’s battle in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land was something people were exaggerating for the sake of doing so.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong was a mere Primal Ancestor. He had only seen Primal Ancestors lowering their heads around him.

“Do you think you have the qualifications to fight me?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhou Xingyu and sighed, “Not any random dog on the street can request to fight me.”

Random dog on the street!

The crowd erupted the moment the words left his lips.

“Huang Xiaolong compared Zhou Xingyu to a random dog trying to challenge him! That's… That’s too arrogant of him!”

“He doesn’t know what’s good for him!”

Zhou Xingyu’s expression was as ugly as could be, and an enraged laugher escaped his lips. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that only Fifth Esteem Dao Venerables reserve the right to challenge you?!”

Unexpectedly, Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I don’t think so. You can probably try it if you’re at the peak of the Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.”

With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he could probably kill a peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable with a single punch if he wanted to. However, he couldn’t tell them that!

Silence descended on the lands as they stared at him in stunned silence.

Only peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerables had the rights to challenge Huang Xiaolong?!

Everyone started to shake their heads. They felt that Huang Xiaolong was being too arrogant for his own good. They even thought that his brain devolved after he cultivated. If he felt that only peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerables could challenge him, he would have the strength of a high-level Dao Venerable!

Not even Zhang Wen and the others could believe what they just heard.

No matter how strong Huang Xiaolong was when he fought Bi Ye and the others, and regardless how talented he was, he would rival a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable at best.

With Zhou Xingyu’s abilities and talent, he was more than qualified to issue a challenge.

As his chest inflated to the size of a balloon at the borders of bursting, killing intent rose in his heart. He glared at Huang Xiaolong, wanting nothing more than to tear him to shreds on the spot.

Stepping forward all of a sudden, Zhang Wen spoke, “Daoist Friend Zhou Xingyu, Young Master Huang is an esteemed guest of our branch pavilion master. Please don’t make things difficult for us today.”

Zhang Wen might be trying to diffuse the situation, but his tone was firm. There was no negotiating with him.

In an instant, Zhou Xingyu’s expression sank. He nodded eventually, but he growled in anger, “Alright, I shall leave it at this since Daoist Friend Zhang Wen has spoken.” Before he left, he turned to Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “The Mystical Pavilion can protect you today, but if you run into me again, you won’t be lucky enough to leave with your limbs intact.”

“Hehe, we’ll meet again.”

His meaning couldn’t be clearer.

Tering through the skies, Zhou Xingyu left.

“Young Master Huang, please.” Zhang Wen gestured for Huang Xiaolong to enter the inner hall.

As soon as they entered the inner hall, the streets erupted.

“Huang Xiaolong is definitely bullsh*tting! He’s definitely afraid of fighting Zhou Xingyu! He’s just using the excuse to avoid the battle!”

“The battle in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land should be fake! Someone definitely exaggerated Huang Xiaolong’s achievements… How can a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor send Bi Ye flying with a single kick?!”

“That’s right! Even with eleven high-order Saint Fates, he wouldn’t be able to fight Xuanyuan Potian in a one on one battle, much less Lord Bi Ye!”

“His ability to use cosmos energy should be fake too! How can a Primal Ancestor wield the power of a Dao Venerable? This lie is nonsense! Only dumb*sses will believe these sort of rumors!”
