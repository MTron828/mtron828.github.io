While shrieking in pain, the mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm stared venomously at Huang Xiaolong and vowed, “I want you dead after we are done with the competition!”

“I’ll be waiting.” Huang Xiaolong responded coldly as he stomped down on the disciple’s lower body once again. This time, he also sent a flow of Asura’s frigid qi into the disciple.

The disciple let out another blood-curdling scream, and fainted.

Huang Xiaolong’s used suction force from his palm to get the disciple’s spatial ring and easily found the Fortune Divine Fruit inside it. When he had used his divine sense to locate the contents inside the spatial ring, there were mostly common grade-five and grade-six spirit stones. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong casually flicked the spatial ring, sending it zooming out of sight.

Huang Xiaolong then turned around, facing the remaining five disciples.

There were still one or two of the five disciples who were still conscious. As they saw Huang Xiaolong looking at them, they quickly clamped their legs together with petrified faces.

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless by their actions.

He didn’t have this kind of unique hobby, okay!

“Hand out all your spatial rings.” Huang Xiaolong ordered curtly.

None of the disciples hesitated, and offered their spatial rings in fluster to Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong collected their spatial rings with a simple wave of his hand.

In a short time, Huang Xiaolong had gained five more Fortune Divine Fruits.

Seeing that these five disciples were so tactful, Huang Xiaolong did not make things difficult for them. But just as Huang Xiaolong was about to fly away, his action halted suddenly.

The five disciples relaxed as they saw that Huang Xiaolong had turned to leave, but when he stopped suddenly, their hearts rose to their throats, and their faces paled. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“This is my communication talisman, when you come across Liu Qin or Fu Feiyu, or even that Zhou Wen, contact me.” Huang Xiaolong took out five communication talismans from his spatial ring and distributed them to the five disciples.

The five disciples looked dazedly at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong actually wanted them to contact him when they saw Liu Qin or Fu Feiyu? Has he gone crazy?

They were still in a daze after Huang Xiaolong flew away.

The five of them recovered their senses a long time after Huang Xiaolong left.

Even so, they looked at each other with baffled expressions.

“Is he stupid? Is he so brazen to think that he has the capital to battle a First Order God King Realm master even though he is just a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm?!”

“But that kid is indeed very strong, I think his strength rivals a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple. Even if he’s not, it’s very close!”

“Even if he has battle strength comparable to a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, isn’t it equivalent to seeking death in front of a God King Realm master. He actually gave us his communication talismans! If we have the chance to run into Senior Brother Liu Qin and Senior Brother Fu Feiyu, we must report to them, then contact that kid! Senior Brother Liu Qin and Senior Brother Fu Feiyu will avenge us!”

“That’s right! Whether it is Senior Brother Liu Qin or Senior Brother Fu Feiyu, it doesn’t matter, as long as one of them deals with that kid, it’s beneficial to us!”

These five disciples flew away as they discussed their plans for Huang Xiaolong. As for the mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm who was ‘injured’ by Huang Xiaolong had gotten abandoned without a second thought.

Inside the large palace hall, Hall Master Zhang Dong and Elder Bai were standing in front of the mirror jade, and they finally came to their senses.

“Powerful indeed!” A happy smile flashed over Zhang Dong’s face. He finally believed that Elder Bai had not exaggerated Huang Xiaolong’s physique.

Elder Bai smiled contentedly as he spoke, “But it seems I still underestimated this kid’s True Dragon Physique.”

Zhang Dong smiled. “This kid probably has the strength to battle a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. His cultivation combined with his True Dragon Physique actually allows him to have the battle power of a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm! It’s amazing!”

Though Zhang Dong had seen numerous geniuses being the Supreme Harmony Hall’s Hall Master, at the moment, he had to admit Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique was amazing.

“But this kid’s a little too arrogant since he has the guts to leave communication talismans with those disciples so that Liu Qin or Fu Feiyu could contact him! Even though he has strength rivaling a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, this level of strength is insignificant in front of Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu.”

Zhang Dong’s brows creased slightly. Inwardly, Huang Xiaolong had become his ideal personal disciple candidate. If Huang Xiaolong were to challenge Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu, and end up severely injured, it would harm Huang Xiaolong’s future potential and achievements.

“Then again, Hall Master can rest assured as Cloudless Island is quite big and the rankings competition’s duration is only three months, those disciples might not even run into Liu Qin or Fu Feiyu.” Elder Bai added, “Even if he did manage to run into Liu Qin or Fu Feiyu, I don’t think Huang Xiaolong would dare to challenge Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu openly. I am guessing leaving those disciples his communication talismans was merely an act to save some face.”

Zhang Dong’s brows smoothened as he nodded in agreement, “That’s true.” He looked around the hall at several other Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders. They were also watching different mirror jades, occasionally scratching their heads in frustration.

The centerpiece mirror jade in the hall showed the competition’s latest rankings— first was the disciples’ names, followed by the number of Fortune Divine Fruits they have.

Peng Xiao was in the first place on the rankings list for now.

Even though it was only the first hour into the rankings competition, Peng Xiao had already eleven Fortune Divine Fruits!

Fu Feiyu and Liu Qin were in second and third place respectively, with ten and nine Fortune Divine Fruits.

Looking at the rankings list, Zhang Dong sighed in appreciation, “Peng Xiao is truly a supreme godhead genius, she has gotten eleven fruits in such a short time!”

“Sun Shihai in the first batch of disciples, obtained 1,123 Fortune Divine Fruits at the end of the competition! I wonder if Peng Xiao could exceed Sun Shihai’s result?!” Elder Bai said curiously.

Sun Shihai was a supreme godhead genius who had entered the Fortune Emperor Palace in the first batch of recruited disciples. Not only Sun Shihai had taken first place in the first batch of disciples’ rankings competition, but he had also snatched 1,123 Fortune Divine Fruits! No one had broken this record thus far, even though there had been four subsequent batches of recruited disciples after Sun Shihai’s batch. In fact, their results were far below in comparison.

Zhang Dong shook his head, “Hard to say, but most likely, Peng Xiao might not surpass Sun Shihai.”

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong’s name on the rankings list glimmered with seven accumulated Fortune Divine Fruits.

Zhang Dong and Elder Bai were surprised, neither of them had expected Huang Xiaolong to have snatched another Fortune Divine Fruit so quickly.

With seven Fortune Divine Fruits, Huang Xiaolong ranked fifth on the rankings list, sharing the position with two other disciples.

The rankings competition had just begun, so the current positions on the rankings list did not mean much, as these rankings would go through a big reshuffle once the competition progressed from ten days to half a month.

However, neither Hall Master Zhang Dong nor Elder Bai had expected to see Huang Xiaolong’s position on the rankings list to rise up to the fourth place so quickly!

The fourth place was just one spot behind Liu Qin.

Three days later, Huang Xiaolong had accumulated one hundred and fifty-one Fortune Divine Fruits.

The more the two of them followed Huang Xiaolong’s progress through the mirror jade, the more they were astounded.
