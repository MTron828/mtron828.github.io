He Lai and Luo Yun hurriedly waved their hands and said, “No, no, we don’t dare to accept such high a greeting.”

He Lai smiled wryly at Huang Xiaolong as he began, “When I first saw Brother Huang, I had an intuition that Brother Huang would perform well and snatch a spot in the top one hundred rankings, but it was unexpected that Brother Huang performed way higher than my estimation; not only did you win the sixth batch disciples’ first place, but also snatched the title of an overall champion.”

Luo Yun also had an embarrassed smile on his face. Before the rankings competition, he had told Huang Xiaolong that it would be an extremely good result if he could make it into the top one hundred. But who would have known that Huang Xiaolong would shock everyone with a boom, a super big boom.

“Brother Huang, please cover our backs a little in the future eh.” Luo Yun smiled and said with a hint of enthusiasm and awe.

Though Huang Xiaolong was still only an outer sect disciple, that was about to change by the end of that day. Soon Huang Xiaolong was surely going to get accepted as a disciple by one of the big shots during the Supreme Harmony Hall’s ceremony.

Huang Xiaolong smiled amiably as he said, “Senior Brothers are too polite, as I merely have a high emperor rank godhead, so with my level of talent, who knows if anyone will accept me as their disciple.”

He Lai and Luo Yun exchanged a few more perfunctory words with Huang Xiaolong.

Right at this time, a group of people were flying in their direction from the horizon. At the front of the group was a silver-haired, feminine looking young man with sky-blue eyes, bespeaking mesmerizing charm. This young man was carrying himself with a noble bearing, and his every move and gesture were exuding an awe-inspiring majesty.

Other disciples gathered around this young man akin to stars around the moon as they flew in the direction of the Supreme Harmony Hall.

Among the disciples behind the young man were Liu Qin, and Fu Feiyu, as well as Zhou Wen, and the other disciples Huang Xiaolong had defeated during the rankings competition.

Both Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu were very respectful as they remained a step’s length behind the young man, which was an ideal behavior of a modal follower.

“It’s Sun Shihai!” He Lai and Luo Yun both whispered to Huang Xiaolong in a low voice.

Sun Shihai!

He was the most dazzling supreme godhead genius to appear in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s branch disciples’ recruitment during this round of recruitment! Although none of them knew anything about the type or rank of Sun Shihai’s supreme godhead, there was a rumor among the disciples that his supreme godhead rank was a little higher than the purple-haired young woman Peng Xiao.

Precisely at this moment, Sun Shihai’s gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong.

“Senior Brother Sun, that’s Huang Xiaolong!” Noticing Sun Shihai’s line of sight, Liu Qin took half a step forward and informed Sun Shihai as his hatred-filled stare fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

Because of Huang Xiaolong, by the end of the rankings competition, Liu Qin’s ranking had not only fallen out of the top ten, but also out of the top one hundred. With hard work, he had managed to gather enough Fortune Divine Fruits, barely squeezing into the top three hundred rankings.

Fu Feiyu was also staring at Huang Xiaolong with hatred. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, Zhou Wen who had clamored to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson from the very beginning was dodging Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, and the fear in his eyes was obvious.

In the blink of an eye, Sun Shihai, Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, and the rest of their group descended several meters away from Huang Xiaolong, Luo Yun, and He Lai.

Luo Yun and He Lai both greeted Sun Shihai with smiling faces, “Junior Brother Sun.”

Sun Shihai glanced indifferently at them, without any intention of responding, and replying to their greetings. His curious gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong as he asked curiously, “You’re that Huang Xiaolong? The same Huang Xiaolong whose result surpassed mine?”

Huang Xiaolong merely looked at Sun Shihai and did not reply to his question.

Sun Shihai was inwardly taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s attitude.

“Huang Xiaolong, are you deaf? Didn’t you hear Senior Brother Sun’s question? Why aren’t you answering quickly?” Fu Feiyu snapped at Huang Xiaolong. “Do you think the Hall Masters are going to accept you as their disciple because you got the first place? What a joke! In my opinion, just based on your godhead rank, it’s already a pie falling from the sky if there’s an Elder who’s willing to accept you as a disciple. In short, you’re going to be just an Elder’s disciple at most, so where did you get the confidence to act arrogant in front of Senior Brother Sun!”

Huang Xiaolong looked indifferently at Fu Feiyu who was doing his best to flatter Sun Shihai, then turned around and said to He Lai and Luo Yun, “Senior Brothers, let’s go inside.” With that, he leaped into the air and flew away.

He Lai and Luo Yun hesitated only briefly then hurried after Huang Xiaolong into the Supreme Harmony Hall.

A gleam of coldness flickered in the depths of Sun Shihai’s eyes as he watched them leave.

“Senior Brother Sun! Should we...?” Fu Feiyu furtively inquired Sun Shihai, if they should block Huang Xiaolong from leaving.

Sun Shihai waved his hand offhandedly and smiled as he said, “No need, as he is merely an insignificant outer sect disciple. He is not worth it, it would only lower our identities.”

Even though he had heard the rumors about Chen Yirong being willing to break the rules for once and accept Huang Xiaolong as his disciple-in-name, there was still a fundamental difference between personal disciple and disciple-in-name, especially in terms of status and identity. Huang Xiaolong could not be compared to him, a personal disciple, in any way.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong’s godhead was just a high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead. So no matter how strong his physique was, the rank of Huang Xiaolong’s godhead limited his hope of breaking through to the Emperor Realm. At that time, most of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s resources would naturally be concentrated on cultivating Sun Shihai. The amount of resources that Huang Xiaolong could receive couldn’t be compared to the amount he would receive.

He would have a lot of opportunities in the future to deal with Huang Xiaolong if he wanted to.

Liu Qin smiled and said, “Senior Brother Sun is absolutely right. Senior Brother Sun will be an Ancestor’s personal disciple, so he does not need to pay attention to Huang Xiaolong. We really don’t need to lower ourselves to Huang Xiaolong’s level.”

Sun Shihai nodded his head, then flew into the Supreme Harmony Hall.

Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, and the others quickly followed behind him.

On the other side, after Huang Xiaolong entered the Supreme Harmony Hall, he saw that purple-haired Peng Xiao and many other disciples had already arrived.

Peng Xiao was standing closest to the center of the hall, exuding a cold noble air, looking extremely eye-catching in the hall.

When Huang Xiaolong, Luo Yun, and He Lai appeared in the hall, many of the disciples turned to look at them. Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong, a low rumble of whispers echoed in the hall.

Peng Xiao also turned to look. She harrumphed coldly and turned her head away as if she was angry with Huang Xiaolong.

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, while inwardly thinking, ‘Wasn’t it just six hundred Fortune Divine Fruits? On second thought, six hundred Fortune Divine Fruits is quite a lot.

There were a total of six batches of disciples in this round of recruitment and each of the disciples stood in their own groups respectively.

Under different meaningful gazes from various directions, Huang Xiaolong, the overall rankings competitions’ champion, walked to the front most spot among the sixth batch of disciples. As Peng Xiao was also in the same batch, Huang Xiaolong and Peng Xiao were standing next to each other. Though there was some distance between them, Huang Xiaolong could still smell the scent from her body.

Smells nice. Every woman has a unique scent.

Peng Xiao gave Huang Xiaolong a ferocious, cold glare when she saw that he had chosen to stand next to her. But she was still looking adorable despite her coldness.

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly, without any concern.

At this time, the crowd of disciples stirred again, even louder than the time Huang Xiaolong had come in. Huang Xiaolong saw Sun Shihai coming in after him.

After Sun Shihai entered the great hall, he looked straight ahead and saw Huang Xiaolong standing beside Peng Xiao, and his brows furrowed. He walked to the front but he belonged to the first batch of disciples, so he had to join his group.

Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, and Zhou Wen belonged to the sixth batch, therefore, they had to separate from Sun Shihai, and stand behind Huang Xiaolong.

Fu Feiyu, Liu Qin, and the others also felt uncomfortable watching Huang Xiaolong stand so close to Peng Xiao.

But Huang Xiaolong ignored these hostile gazes, looking extremely comfortable as he stood there like a meditating monk, waiting for the Fortune Emperor Palace’s higher echelons to arrive.
