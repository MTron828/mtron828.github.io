Chapter 3739: Lord Shen An

“I heard that he didn’t return alone!” Peng Ze lowered his head and muttered.

“What do you mean?”

“He… He seemed to come back with Lord Shen An,” Peng Ze explained. His voice trembled slightly when he mentioned Shen An.

“Lord Shen An?! Which Shen An are you talking about?” Peng Xian didn’t think too much about it and snapped in irritation.

“Lord Shen An from the Heaven Sage Palace!”

“What?! Heaven Sage Palace?!” Peng Xian yelled as he jumped to his feet.

The Heaven Sage Palace was the holy land in the Nine Cauldron Land!

The person who created the Heaven Sage Palace was the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, the expert whose combat strength crossed the 27 billion mark!

To people like Peng Xian, there wasn’t even a need to mention the Heaven Sage Human Emperor! Anyone who crossed the 20 billion mark would be comparable to god in his eyes!

Once Peng Ze mentioned where Shen An came from, Peng Xian’s mind raced to connect the dots. Shen An was the direct disciple of the Heaven Sage Human Emperor!

“How can this happen?! What’s going on?!” Peng Xian yelled in shock. “How in the world did Wang Kaifei get acquainted with Lord Shen An? That’s not possible… Did you make a mistake somewhere?!”

Peng Ze knew that his father was pushing his luck, but he had to explain the situation no matter the cost. “Wang Kaifei was said to have been saved by Lord Shen An back in the Eastern Plains. Lord Shen An looked highly upon him and quickly promoted Wang Kaifei to be his right-hand man.”

Peng Xian’s expression changed drastically.

“This… This might not be true, however, it’s extremely likely that’s what happened.” Peng Ze sighed.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Wang Kaifei returned to his manor just a moment ago, and Lord Shen An was invited in as a guest of honor,” Peng Ze continued.

The last trace of hope in Peng Xian’s heart disappeared.

Falling to the ground, Peng Xian felt the world crumbling around him.

“Why… Why do the heavens wish to see my Peng Family destroyed?!”

“Why!!!”

“Did I do something to anger the heavens?!”

Peng Ze felt tears welling up in his eyes when he saw the state his father was in.

Since Huang Xiaolong remained in the inner palace, he didn’t bother going out to explore the city. He spent his time comprehending the Nameless Devil Mirror.

As dawn broke the very next day, Peng Xian went over to Huang Xiaolong’s palace early in the morning. He might have hidden his expressions well, but Huang Xiaolong could see that he had a lot on his mind.

Since Peng Xian didn’t wish to talk about it, Huang Xiaolong didn’t pry.

After all, it probably had something to do with his family.

Peng Xian quickly brought Huang Xiaolong over to the main palace.

It was Peng Xian’s birthday, but he allowed Huang Xiaolong to take the seat of honor in the room. Of course, Huang Xiaolong could read the room. He didn’t wish to take the limelight away from the man celebrating his ten billionth birthday and he chose a seat on the left of the main throne of the hall.

Even so, everyone was shocked to discover Peng Xian’s intention.

They started to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

“Could he be someone invited by the Peng Family? He might be a half-step Universe God…”

“Even if he is, there’s no use! Who dares to offend the Heaven Sage Palace?! Wang Kaifei threw in his lot with Lord Shen An, and he’s someone under their banner now. Humph. Wang Kaifei will definitely show up later.”

“If he does, we’ll be in for a treat.”

Several experts spoke among themselves.

Even though Peng Xian couldn’t hear what they said, nothing could be hidden from an expert at Huang Xiaolong’s level.

“Heaven Sage Palace?” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

From their secret conversations, Huang Xiaolong could tell that the Wang Family was at loggerheads with the Peng Family. Moreover, he learned that Wang Kaifei just returned from the Eastern Plains after throwing in his lot with Shen An.

The moment Peng Xian arrived, many people came up to present their gifts. However, the festivities were broken by a shrill cry as experts of the Peng Family were thrown into the hall. All of them suffered serious injuries, and there were some whose bodies were split wide open. Some of them also had sharp spikes stabbed straight through their eye sockets.

The faces of Peng Xian and Peng Ze turned extremely ugly as the hall fell silent.

Everyone could guess what was going on.

Indeed, mocking laughter rang through the air. “Old Man Peng, it’s your birthday today and it’s weird that you didn’t invite me. I hope you don’t mind that I invited myself.” A middle-aged man clad in purple-gold battle robe strode into the hall followed by a group of experts from the Wang Family.

Peng Xian’s expression changed slightly when he saw the person who came.

It was none other than Wang Kaifei, the old ancestor of the Wang Family.

The experts of the Peng Family no longer dared to stop him after the carnage he caused. They retreated over to Peng Xian’s side and the experts who came to offer their congratulations made their way to the side of the hall.

“Wang Kaifei, what’s the meaning of this?!” Peng Xian growled as he looked at the disciples on the ground.

Even though the Wang Family was strong, they wouldn’t dare to cripple the disciples of the Peng Family in their territory, much less, core disciples!

“I don’t have any other intentions! I’m here to celebrate your birthday for you! In fact, I brought you a lavish gift!” As soon as he spoke, he gestured for someone to bring a metal case forward.

A feeling of foreboding appeared in the hearts of Peng Xian and Peng Ze.

Opening the lid, Wang Kaifei revealed the contents to everyone in the hall. It was the head of a man whose eyes were filled with indignation and hatred.

“Tao’er!” Peng Ze screamed.

That was the head of his son, Peng Tao!

In a fit of rage, he wanted to charge at the members of the Wang Family but was stopped by Peng Xian.

Staring at Wang Kaifei, Peng Xian growled, “Where is my grandson’s dao soul?”

“Dao soul? Hahaha! It’s in the furnace of my Wang Family! We’re torturing him as we speak!”

Peng Ze roared with rage, “Wang Kaifei, the grudge between our families will never be buried!”

Killing intent filled Peng Xian’s heart, and he snapped, “Wang Kaifei, aren’t you afraid that I’ll do the same to your son and grandson?!” Even though Wang Kaifei had been missing for a long time, the Peng Family merely suppressed their businesses. They kept their bottomline, and they didn’t kill members of the Wang Family.

Wang Kaifei sneered, “Peng Xian, do you really think that you will get the chance to do anything? Today might be your birthday, but it’ll be the anniversary of your Peng Family’s extermination in a year!”

Several figures appeared around the manor after he spoke.

When Peng Xian recognized those who were surrounding the manor, he gasped in fright, “Heaven Sage Palace!”

The members who arrived were precisely members of the Heaven Sage Palace.

Moreover, all of them were half-step Universe Gods. They might not have broken through the 10 billion mark, but they were more than sufficient to exterminate the Peng Family.

“That’s right! These four experts are Lord Shen An’s subordinates!” Wang Kaifei gloated, “Today, no one in your Peng Family will be able to live!”
