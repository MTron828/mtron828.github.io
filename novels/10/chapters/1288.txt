All of the Meteoric Soar Manor’s guards quickly gathered at the main entrance, as they noticed the disagreement between the steward and Huang Xiaolong’s group. All of them stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, and warned him through their piercing gazes that they would detain his group if he did not deliver a gift to show respect to their master.

Just as the little cow, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest were about to attack, Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked over his shoulder and said to Gui Yi, “Go, send a congratulatory gift.”

The rest of his group was astounded. However, Gui Yi quickly acknowledged and walked to the side, towards the disciple who was in charge of receiving gifts.

The steward proudly tilted his chin in victory and looked at Huang Xiaolong with a satisfied expression.

Moments later, Gui Yi arrived in front of the disciple who was collecting the gifts. He then took out a shenbi and placed it on the table in front of all the anticipating eyes.

The disciple stared agape at this one shenbi, as he was unable to understand what Gui Yi meant.

“Congratulatory gift, one unique shenbi!” Gui Yi spoke.

Congratulatory gift, one unique shenbi!

One top of that, unique?!

Gui Yi’s words thundered like a bomb at the main entrance. The lively atmosphere at the entrance suddenly died down. The various sects’ experts who had come to congratulate Xiao Teng looked in a weird way at Huang Xiaolong’s group and Gui Yi.

Then, a few of them simply started laughing.

The laughter jolted the Meteoric Soar Manor’s steward to his senses. His face darkened in an instant as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, you came to make trouble at Meteoric Soar Manor? Do you know that your action is equivalent to seeking death?”

Huang Xiaolong looked unconcerned, and he calmly explained, “One shenbi can buy a lot of steam buns. If Xiao Teng thinks this is too little, I can give him one more shenbi, it should buy him a few days’ worth of steam buns.”

A young woman in a blue dress in the crowd let out a peal of laughter.

Steam buns?

A few days’ worth?

Huang Xiaolong’s words were obviously implying that Xiao Teng was a beggar.

“Court death!” The steward reacted. In the next second, a yellow earth element light burst around his fist as he angrily took a swing at Huang Xiaolong, using the force of a great mountain.

Naturally, someone who was given the position of a steward by Xiao Teng was not going to be a weakling. In fact, he was a late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm master.

The force of his punch was powerful enough to flatten a ten thousand li mountain range. Not to mention, his punch would even leave another late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm extremely miserable, if not crippled.

However, when he tried to attach Huang Xiaolong, his mighty fist force simply dispersed like smoke, and he was sent flying backwards as he was hit by a mighty force. This was the doing of the void devil beast Xu Baisheng. Xu Baisheng had sent the steward’s body smashing into several stone pillars and crashing onto the floor by simply lifting his claws and pointing out a nail at him.

Following this shocking event, everything around the Manor suddenly fell into a momentary, eerie silence. But seconds later, thundering footsteps, angry shouts, and whistling winds broke this silence.

In a distance, everyone could see a person levitate above the Manor, raising whistling winds across the sky. In the next second, this person appeared in front of the crowd, and a powerful momentum billowed from his body, enveloping all four directions of the Meteoric Soar Manor in an unstoppable bearing.

“Manor Lord!”

“Elder Xiao Teng!”

The manor’s guards and various experts greeted.

This person was none other than the Xiao Family’s Elder Xiao Teng. His gaze was locked on Huang Xiaolong’s group the moment he arrived.

Xiao Teng and Huang Xiaolong scrutinized one another for some time. Huang Xiaolong could see that Xiao Teng was not very tall. He had a pale white skin, and a clean-shaven face.

“Friend, you have made a wrong choice by coming to my manor and creating unnecessary trouble.” Xiao Teng smiled coldly at Huang Xiaolong, “This is Xiao City, the Xiao Family’s territory. A few years back, a high-level Ancient God Realm fool had caused trouble at Xiao City. Do you know what happened to him? His soul was imprisoned, his body was chopped alive, and fed to demonic beasts.”

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he said, “I have heard there are three pieces of chaos five-colored heaven refining stones.”

Xiao Teng raised an eyebrow, ‘the chaos five-colored heaven refining stones?’

But Xiao Teng sneered and said icily, “So, you have come for the chaos five-colored heaven refining stones? That’s right, I indeed bought the three chaos five-colored heaven refining stones some years back. If you are interested in buying them from me, I may agree to sell them to you for thirty trillion!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, ‘thirty trillion? Huh, one piece of chaos five-colored heaven refining stone costs about three trillion shenbi, thus three pieces come up to roughly ten trillion. Xiao Teng was asking for thirty trillion from him?’

“What? Can’t afford it?” Xiao Teng snorted coldly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s you!” Right at this time, someone exclaimed from behind Xiao Teng. A young man appeared in front of them and glared hatefully at Huang Xiaolong.

“Master, it’s this punk who injured me and robbed us of the batch of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones, when we were in the middle of purchasing that batch of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones as a gift for Master.” The young man explained as he came to Xiao Teng.

Robbed? As if that batch of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones were theirs to begin with.

There was a cold gleam in Xiao Teng’s eyes as he looked at Huang Xiaolong once again. He snickered maliciously and said, “Punk, you dared to come here, despite robbing my batch of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones?!”

Just as Xiao Teng was about to attack, someone shouted, “Xiao Family’s Young Lord Xiao Zhangyu and Hundred Tribulations’ Faction’s Young Lord Chang Fang are making their appearance, make way for them!”

The crowd stirred with excitement.

Subsequently, the people opened up a path in the middle as a group of people walked through the crowd. Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang were walking in front of the group.

Xiao Teng couldn’t be bothered with Huang Xiaolong at that moment as he quickly turned around with a wide smile, “My Meteoric Soar Manor is extremely blessed by Young Lord and Young Lord Xiao Zhangyu’s presence.”

Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang chuckled, and exchanged perfunctory greetings with Xiao Teng. Xiao Zhangyu’s gaze swept the surroundings, and immediately saw Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Xu Baisheng. His expression turned gloomy as thick killing intent surged from his body.

Chang Fang also saw Huang Xiaolong.

Xiao Teng was shocked sensing Xiao Zhangyu’s killing intent, “Young Lord, did this kid offended you?”

Xiao Zhangyu sneered, “He has more than offended me.” As he said this, his gaze swept past Feng Er, Gui Yi, and others, and he went on, “If I have guessed right, this punk here is the current Ghost Manor’s Lord.”

“What?!” Xiao Teng exclaimed. His heart was thumping against his chest. Some months ago, Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang had returned from the Ghost Manor, after failing to become the personal disciple of the Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue, as that position was snatched by an unknown disciple. This was not a secret, and all the forces’ experts in the Clear Spirit World knew about this.

It... it was actually this kid!

Xiao Teng suddenly looked at Feng Er who was standing beside Huang Xiaolong, and then his gaze turned towards Gui Yi, and the others. If this punk was actually the new Ghost Manor Lord, then these people’s identities were clear. Thinking of this, Xiao Teng’s body quivered and his back dampened from cold sweat. Fortunately, he had not attack Huang Xiaolong, otherwise, instead of standing there alive, Xiao Teng would have been a corpse that was lying on the ground.

Seeing Xiao Teng’s expression, Xiao Zhangyu said, “In truth, it doesn’t matter even if this punk is the new Ghost Manor Lord. From the news that I have heard, the Ghost Manor Lord was poisoned by some unique poison, which has left his one foot in the coffin; his days are numbered. A Ghost Manor without Gui Yue is nothing more than a first-rank force level. Our Xiao Family can easily annihilate the Ghost Manor!”

The crowd gasped in shock.

The Ghost Manor Lord was close to death? Was this true?

Huang Xiaolong’s brows wrinkled slightly, ‘From where did Xiao Zhangyu get the news about Gui Yue being poisoned? Is there a spy in the Ghost Manor?’

“So, that’s the case.” Xiao Teng chuckled, and then said, “Young Lord, if it is as you’ve said, should we get rid of this punk? It’s even easier to annihilate the Ghost Manor with him dead.”

Xiao Family had always harbored the intention of annihilating the Ghost Manor, but they were wary of Gui Yue. Now that it was open news that Gui Yue’s death was close, there were no scruples left.
