Chapter 2286: Huang Xiaolong’s Importance

Jiang Wuji laughed when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You might not be aware, but in order for my Jiang Family to increase our strength, we used all of our level seven origin spiritual pills to boost the cultivation of our experts. As for the jade stones with spirituality, Jiang Tian used them to construct his Holy Alliance Palace. There is indeed none left.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was true. In order to nurture experts like Jiang Tian, the Jiang Family burned through all their resources. Most of the level six origin spiritual pills and several level seven ones were given to Jiang Tian.

As for the construction of the Holy Alliance Palace, it was true that a part of the jade stones stored in the treasury was used for that.

Regardless, it was impossible for the Jiang Family to be out of level seven origin spiritual pills and holy spiritual blood stone.

It was exactly as Huang Xiaolong had expected. Jiang Wuji had swept the treasury clean the day before.

Since a single night wasn’t enough for him to hide any more items, he only managed to move away the most precious of items in the treasury. He failed to hide the copious amounts of holy bills in the treasury.

Jiang Tian stared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted, “That’s right. Huang Xiaolong, I’ve refined all the level seven origin spiritual pills in the treasury. Do you have a problem with it? Am I supposed to spit them out for you?”

After speaking, Jiang Tian roared with laughter.

A look of indifference remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “There’s no need for that. The effects are the same anyway.”

After he devoured Jiang Tian, he would be able to enjoy the benefits of all the spiritual pills the other party swallowed. There was no need to fuss over several pills.

It was clear that no one got his meaning as Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji stared at him with a face full of doubt.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong swept through the treasury and retrieved everything he was promised.

As he flew through the treasury, he threw holy bills, divine pills, and jade stones into the space inside the lightning bead.

Very quickly, medicinal fragrance filled the space within the lightning bead.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t care much about level four or five origin spiritual pills at his state, he kept them all anyway. If he couldn’t use it himself, he would simply use it to cultivate a bunch of experts under him!

As he swept through the treasury, Huang Xiaolong had no idea how many origin spiritual pills under the fifth level he obtained. However, the one thing he knew was that it was enough for him to form an army of low-level Venerables! He could even form a squad of high-level Venerables if he wished!

He hadn’t even considered the jade stones and holy bills!

He took nearly six trillion holy bills after going through the Jiang Family’s treasury, and it was higher than Jiang Tian had estimated!

Looking at Huang Xiaolong sweeping up half their wealth, Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji couldn’t help but feel a sharp pain shooting through their hearts. Even though they hid the most valuable items in the treasury, half of their accumulated wealth was being taken away!

No matter how massive the Jiang Family was, that was more than six trillion holy bills worth of items they were giving away!

There wasn’t a need to mention the six trillion. Many top clans and families would be hard pressed to take out six trillion holy bills! In the span of a single night, Huang Xiaolong managed to ‘earn’ himself a thousand times that!

Jiang Tian couldn’t help but mock Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong aren’t you afraid that the various families would send out their experts to hunt you down for your treasures?”

Huang Xiaolong snickered softly, “With so much treasures here, aren’t you afraid that all the top factions in the Central Holy Dynasty would form an alliance to raze your Jiang Family to the ground?”

Jiang Tian was stunned for a second and his expression soon fell.

Ignoring the angry looks of Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji, Huang Xiaolong left the treasury before leaving the Jiang Family’s residence.

“Forefather, do we...” Jiang Tian drew a line across his neck as he looked at Jiang Wuji for further instructions.

As rays of light flashed across Jiang Wuji’s eyes, a look of contemplation appeared on his face. It was clear that he was seriously thinking about assassinating Huang Xiaolong.

He knew that Li Wen would definitely find out the Jiang Family’s hand in the matter the moment he ordered for Huang Xiaolong to be killed, and he was currently considering if the Jiang Family could withstand Li Wen’s crazed counterattack.

If Huang Xiaolong was any ordinary Holy Prince, Li Wen might show some mercy and let the Jiang Family off with a slap on the wrist. However, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary Holy Prince.

“Forget it...” After thinking about it for a long time, Jiang Wuji shook his head.

There were many more chances to kill Huang Xiaolong, and there was no need for them to sacrifice their entire family to achieve their goals.

Jiang Tian stared at Jiang Wuji in shock and he frowned, “Forefather, we have absolute confidence of killing Huang Xiaolong now. Even if Li Wen manages to track us down, he wouldn’t go berserk and deal with our Jiang Family for him!”

After all, Jiang Tian’s position in the Holy Gate was solid and he felt that it was impossible for Li Wen to go all out on him in order to take revenge for Huang Xiaolong.

Jiang Wuji shook his head as a solemn expression appeared on his face. “You have no idea how important Huang Xiaolong is. Right now, his importance has already surpassed the safety of the Zhouyuan Holy Ground.”

“What?! How can he be more important than the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground?!” Jiang Tian felt a bomb going off in his head.

“Even if you form an alliance with all the Holy Princes in the Holy Gate, your alliance is but a farce if Li Wen has to choose between the two of you. If we really make a move on him, our Jiang Family...”

He didn’t need to complete his sentence for Jiang Tian to understand his meaning.

“How is this possible?!”

It went without saying that Jiang Tian didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong was of such importance to the Holy Gate.

The look in Jiang Wuji’s eyes deepened as he sighed, “If my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me, Huang Xiaolong is able to improve his complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique.”

“Is that even possible?! Why haven’t I heard of something like that?!” Jiang Tian’s body shook as he yelled in shock.

Jiang Wuji shook his head and explained, “Of course you wouldn’t have heard of something like that. This is a secret kept by a small number of people in the Holy World. This matter concerns the peak existences in the Holy World, and those who know of it wouldn’t go around spreading the news. This is also why I’m only telling you about this now.”

“This has something to do with the peak existences in the Holy World?!” Jiang Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief. Could it be?

“That’s right! This has something to do with the existences surpassing the True Saint Realm in the Holy World!” Jiang Wuji’s voice trembled when he spoke about them. There was a trace of excitement, along with several parts of fear when he continued, “Out of all the existences who surpassed the True Saint Realm, eight of them have the ability to constantly improve their complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique.”

Jiang Tian felt his world spinning as he stared at Jiang Wuji in shock.

There were actually eight monsters who had the same ability as Huang Xiaolong! All of them had surpassed the True Saint Realm!

He finally realized the reason behind the emphasis the Holy Gate placed on Huang Xiaolong.

“Of course, I am only guessing that Huang Xiaolong is able to do that.” Jiang Wuji sighed, “Right now, I have no idea if he can actually do it. Whatever the case, my suspicions might be true considering how Li Wen and the others are protecting him.”

It might actually be possible!

Jiang Tian stood rooted to his spot as he felt a little lost. How could someone he had already tagged as a useless b*stard be a person with the ability to surpass the True Saint Realm?!

“Huang Xiaoong has to die!” Huang Wuji softly growled, “But since he has already killed Yang Rong of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground, we shall let them do the dirty work. There is no way they would sit still on this matter.”
