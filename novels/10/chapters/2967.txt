Chapter 2968: Heart Devourer Twin Devils

Not a trace of panic could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he looked at the monstrous poison qi that covered the sky along with the life and death sword qi that could cut all beings, vines that could shatter everything, and the boundless blade qi, fist imprints, and palm forces bombarding down on him.

B-O-O-M!!

One punch and a burst of blood mists covered the opposite side’s momentums. Huang Xiaolong didn’t even need to employ any cosmos energy from his three small worlds, not the power of his three dao souls, Saint Fates, and inextinguishable dao heart, much less the five absolute powers he can wield. That counter-attack was merely the power of his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!

Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth had been tempered by five tribulations, breaking the limits by increasingly stronger White Incineration Lightning, Origin Flame, and Light of Creation. Not forgetting, he had refined more than two hundred Fruits of Beginning in the last two hundred years. Based on the current strength of Huang Xiaolong’s peak early Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable expert wouldn’t be able to take one punch from Huang Xiaolong head-on, then what was more to these Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Esteem Dao Venerables?!

When Huang Xiaolong burst the body of the first person with a punch, the sky-covering poison qi, vigorous life and death sword qi, overpowering vines, and all other attacks landed on Huang Xiaolong.

The crowd all around saw these overwhelming attacks hit Huang Xiaolong akin to a breeze passing the mountain—Huang Xiaolong didn’t even move an inch!

“How is that possible!” After seeing this result, Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, Qiu Ruosheng, and others shouted almost in unison.

Unbelievable!

A Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert couldn’t remain unscathed after taking a combined hit from Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, Qiu Ruosheng, and thirty others, and it was definitely impossible to stand still as a mountain.

Didn't they say Huang Xiaolong was merely a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable?!

Because Huang Xiaolong had not employed any cosmos energy, his current cultivation realm was not exposed yet. Therefore, everyone was still stuck thinking Huang Xiaolong was merely a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable.

Before many unbelieving eyes, Huang Xiaolong blurred into a flicker, arriving in front of his second target. He then sent out another punch. After a thunderous explosion, there was golden blood mist above the Dragon Fish City.

The blood of Dao Venerable experts contained grand dao energy, and these fine mists of golden blood glistened beautifully when the sunlight hit them as if the sky was raining golden raindrops. This sight was both beautiful and chilling at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong flickered away again.

The third punch!

The third person exploded! Then the fourth punch! The fifth punch, the sixth punch!

These experts who came from either genesis races or top-tier creeds didn’t even have a chance to grunt before exploding to their deaths under Huang Xiaolong’s fist.

Whether they were Fifth, Sixth, or Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, or regardless of whether they were wearing Dao Venerable Cosmos Armor, the results were the same. All of them exploded to their deaths. More importantly, Huang Xiaolong’s speed was too fast for them to capture, much less dodging Huang Xiaolong’s fist. They couldn’t dodge even if they wanted to.

After a dozen breaths later, no more than ten people were left from the initial thirty-plus people!

When another ten breaths passed, Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, and the others finally felt fear and panic set in their hearts. Looking at the amount of golden blood mist that had been increasing above them, it seemed like the death god was closing in on them.

“Listen up everyone. As long as someone successfully captures Huang Xiaolong, the Poison Valley will grant him one condition, and he can ask whatever he wants!” Liu Ran suddenly shouted to the surrounding experts.

“Capture Huang Xiaolong, and our Supreme Sword Palace will pass him the Life and Death Sword Dao, and help him comprehend the Life and Death Sword Dao!” Yan Bubi reacted and quickly added the chips.

“Our World Tree will reward the person with one hundred drops of water of life!” Qiu Rupeng also shouted out urgently.

The few surviving ones also quickly made a promise of rewards on behalf of the forces behind them. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The streets were in a furor.

Whether it was the Poison Valley’s promise, the Supreme Sword Palace’s Life and Death Sword Dao, or the World Tree’s water of life, any single of these was enough to tempt those experts watching from the dark.

The Life and Death Sword Dao hailed as the number one sword technique in the world, which was why it was also nicknamed the Invincible Sword Dao. It was said that when one fully mastered the technique to the limit, they would also comprehend the dao of life and death.

The World Tree’s water of life was a panacea that could heal all injuries and cure all sickness, and it was so magical that it was called the immortal medicine. As long as one had enough water of life, even if a Dao Venerable Realm’s dao physique was destroyed, it could recover with the water of life. Moreover, they could recover to the same state as before destruction, and maybe even become a little stronger!

The Poison Valley’s promise was no less valuable than the Life and Death Sword Dao or the water of life.

However, despite Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and others’ tempting rewards, the strength Huang Xiaolong had shown so far was a much stronger demotivator, and the fact remained that Huang Xiaolong was the Son of Creation. Therefore, no one took action.

Yan Bubi and the others turned when another explosion rang, watching another one of them burst into pieces.

“Whoever captures Huang Xiaolong, the World Tree will reward him with two hundred drops of water of life!” Qiu Ruopeng shouted as he grew increasingly afraid.

If the present experts could maintain their reason earlier, when Qiu Ruopeng upped the chips to two hundred drops of water of life, someone tore space and two people stepped out from the void.

There was no overwhelming aura from their bodies, but when those in the crowd recognized them, faces went pale with horror.

“It’s the Heart Devourer Twin Devils!”

The words Heart Devourer Twin Devils sounded like a curse. The streets immediately fell into horrified silence.

“They, they are the Heart Devourer Twin Devils?!” a creed’s young patriarch asked in stutters.

The Heart Devourer Twin Devils were notorious since ancient times, causing a storm of blood every time they appeared. Not to mention, both of them shared the same peculiar hobby of devouring their enemies’ hearts! No one knew for sure how many experts’ inextinguishable dao heart these two had dug out and eaten!

Both of them were Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts, skilled in escaping and concealment. Hence, they were able to escape despite being besieged several times by many top-tier creeds that nothing could be done about them.

The Heart Devourer Twin Devils were made up of one tall man and one rounded man. The rounded man’s eyes were mere slits as he smiled slyly at Qiu Ruopeng, Yan Bubi, Liu Ran, and the others, “Does what you’ve said stand?”

The tall man that was as pale and stiff as a vampire squeezed out a smile, “I am sure you know the consequences of lying to us!”

His gaze swept over Yan Bubi and the others as he spoke, and a cold invisible hand seemed to clutch at their hearts as that gaze swept past them.

“Of course, Senior Devil Twins can rest assured, we wouldn’t dare to jest in this matter with you.” Yan Bubi hurriedly answered.

The Heart Devourer Twin Devils nodded and shifted their attention onto Huang Xiaolong. The rounded man chuckled sinisterly. “Huang Xiaolong, handover the Tree of Beginning, hand it over and be captured obediently. We won’t make things difficult for you, or else!” His eyes stared at Huang Xiaolong’s chest where his heart was located.

“Actually, I want to taste his inextinguishable dao heart, and see if it tastes any different from the others.” The vampiric tall man sneered.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the two with a placid expression, “Mid-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables, not bad. You qualify to be a minion under me. I’m lacking a batch of Dao Venerable minions.”

All around were flabbergasted faces, including Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and Yan Bubi. But soon, these people were overjoyed by Huang Xiaolong’s words as they were worried that Huang Xiaolong would give the Heart Devourer Twin Devils a better deal and have the Heart Devourer Twin Devils kill them instead. Who could have thought that Huang Xiaolong would openly insult the Heart Devourer Twin Devils and fantasize about having them be his minions!

Huang Xiaolong’s literally speeding down the road to hell!

As expected, the moment Huang Xiaolong said those words, the Heart Devourer Twin Devils’ eyes emitted chilling devilish lights, and the devilish auras from their bodies threatened to drown the world.
