“Master, Wang Wei and his Master Blue Empyrean, what..?” A long time passed, before Liang Mai asked Chen Zhifa with much difficulty.

Chen Zhifa’s gaze fell upon the deep pit not far then, then it shifted to Wang Wei who was lying sprawled on the street. In the end, he heavily sighed and said, “Let’s bring them back to heal first!”

But he could already see that Blue Empyrean and Wang Wei’s cultivation had already been abolished.

Unless there is an Emperor who is willing to heal them, these two are going to spend the rest of their lives as wastes.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong reached the auction house’s main entrance.

Huang Xiaolong’s group was about to enter the auction house, when the crowd around the entrance suddenly stirred.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder curiously, following others’ gazes, and saw a group of experts enshrouded in golden luminance headed by a young man walking towards the main entrance of the auction house.

“It’s the Venerable Buddha Sect’s Sect Chief Chen Xiao!”

“The Venerable Buddha Sect’s Sect Chief Chen Xiao is following behind that young man? Who is that young man?! Could he be someone from the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace?!”

Everyone in the crowd whispered in low voices with their companions.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell onto an imposing-looking middle-aged man, walking behind the young man. ‘This middle-aged man is the Venerable Buddha Sect Chief, Chen Xiao?’

The Venerable Buddha Sect was one of the biggest sects in the Royal Buddha World, and it ranked above the Thousand Autumns Buddha Sect. Huang Xiaolong had not expected the auction to attract the Venerable Buddha Sect’s Sect Chief Chen Xiao.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze then shifted to the young man at the front of the group.

Though the Venerable Buddha Sect was one of the biggest sects in the Royal Buddha World, they were still a liege force of the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace amongst many others. Yet this young man was being accompanied by the Venerable Buddha Sect Chief Chen Xiao. This showed that this young man had a high status in the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace.

“Does this mean that the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace’s people are also interested in the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste? If that’s the case, then we won’t have a chance even if we have collected enough grade eight spirit stones. Who would dare to compete with the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace ah?”

“It’s people from the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace ah. Maybe they’re here for the auction’s last two superior treasures, and not the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste.”

As the people continued discussing, Venerable Buddha Sect Chief Chen Xiao arrived at the auction house’s main entrance as he accompanied the young man.

However, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the rest had been standing at the main entrance, indirectly blocking the young man and the Venerable Buddha Sect Chief Chen Xiao’s group’s path.

Chen Xiao’s brows furrowed when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s group in the middle of their path.

At this point, one of the Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciples shouted at Huang Xiaolong’s group, “Make way!”

Without missing a beat, Huang Xiaolong turned and stepped into the auction house. Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest naturally followed after him into the auction house.

For a second, everyone witnessing this was dumbfounded.

The Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciple’s face was extremely ugly at Huang Xiaolong’s action. Just as he was going to stop Huang Xiaolong, the young man casually waved his hand and said, “It’s alright.”

The Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciple respectfully complied and obediently returned to the back of the group.

“That black-haired young man seems to be the one that has been buying top-grade chaos spiritual pills and top-grade chaos spiritual herbs. Is that Young Noble Huang?”

“It seems to be him! In the recent one month, almost all the top-grade chaos spiritual pills and top-grade chaos spiritual herbs were bought by him, on top of that, he also bought them with high grade-seven spirit stones!”

“I wonder who he is? He also dared to walk into the auction house before the Venerable Buddha Sect!”

Some disciples furtively pointed at Huang Xiaolong as they discussed. Many sects and families’ disciples had seen Huang Xiaolong’s shopping spree during the month’s period.

Chen Xiao and the young man were surprised hearing the disciples’ whispers.

Almost all the top-grade chaos spiritual pills and top-grade spiritual herbs in the city center’s shop were bought by that black-haired young man?

The crucial question was that the total amount of spirit stones required to make such a purchase was an astonishing amount, and definitely not something even a first-rank force could afford.

“Young Noble Huang?” The young man repeated the title with a stroke of curiosity. “It seems like this person is going to be a competitor when I will be bidding for the God King’s Buddha Pellet.”

“Hehe, Young Lord Wang is joking. Even if he has some spirit stones, he won’t have the guts to compete against Young Lord Wang.” Chen Xiao smiled flatteringly as he said to the young man.

The young man Wang Tong smiled meaningfully. “Not necessarily. In this world, there are always some people that become arrogant and reckless because they have some money.”

Chen Xiao laughed softly. “Young Lord Wang is right, but that depends on who the other side is. Even a primordial divine dragon has to lower its head for Young Lord Wang to ride on it!”

Wang Tong grinned. “Your words are not wrong.” With that said, he walked in through the auction house’s entrance with Chen Xiao, and the others followed after him.

As the auction house’s private rooms were specially reserved for the higher echelons of Royal Buddha World’s forces, Huang Xiaolong’s group could only find a place in the auction hall this time around.

As Huang Xiaolong’s group was delayed slightly due to Blue Empyrean and Wang Wei’s group, the seats at the front and middle section of the auction hall were already taken. Huang Xiaolong’s group sat on the seats on the seventh row close to the edge, these were not too secluded nor too eye-catching.

After everyone was seated, they waited quietly for the auction to begin.

More and more experts trickled into the auction hall, gradually filling all the seats.

Suddenly, a delicate fragrance of a woman’s body drilled into Huang Xiaolong’s nose, as a young girl leaned slightly towards him and took the seat next to him.

“Uncle, is this seat next to you empty?” The young girl smiled sweetly as she greeted Huang Xiaolong politely.

Uncle!

The little cow, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the others blanked for a moment.

The little cow couldn’t contain her laughter. “Little sister, there’s no one sitting, you can take that seat.”

The pretty young girl’s eyes lit up, and her gaze was attracted by the little cow. “Uncle, from which auction house did you buy this little cow? So pretty!”

Puff!

Xiang Xun spurted in laughter, losing all his image. So did the others.

On the other hand, the corners of the little cow’s mouth were twitching with frustration.

Pretty? This was the first time someone had used the adjective ‘pretty’ to describe her.

“Hello, my name is Bei Xiaomei.” The pretty young girl generously introduced herself to Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“Hello.” Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San greeted her with a smile. This little lady was quite cute, making them wonder what family she was from. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bei Xiaomei asked Huang Xiaolong, “Uncle, are you also interested in bidding for the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect her to ask this question, but answered frankly, “Yes.” In truth, the matter was not worth concealing, as Li Lu needed the Buddha Pellet to suppress the evil spirit in her body, whereas he needed the Buddha Paste to improve his strength.

Bei Xiaomei pouted and grumbled, “I knew it! I knew that there would be a lot of people coming to this auction for the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste.” Her delicate brows wrinkled. “My allowance is surely not enough for this auction.”

Huang Xiaolong was speechless. ‘This girl has brought her allowance to buy God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste? She’s really cute and innocent.’

“Uncle, do you think my ten million low grade-eight spirits stones allowance will be enough to buy the God King’s Buddha Pellet and Buddha Paste?” Bei Xiaomei turned and asked Huang Xiaolong another question.

Ten million low grade-eight spirit stones... allowance!

Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and the others nearly choked on their saliva. Even Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were ‘startled.’

The little cow took another look at Bei Xiaomei from head to toe, and her eyes glimmered.
