Chapter 3334: International Star

Huang Xiaolong contacted Lu Dingming after his parents agreed to go on a holiday. When Lu Dingming heard that they were going to be arriving the next day, he jumped in joy as he started to banter with Huang Jiyuan.

After refining the Blue Dragon Pill, Lu Dingming became a whole new person.

When they finally disconnected the call half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong arranged for Huang Shengan to get them a ticket to Tokyo the very next day.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Huang Shengan didn’t take long to book a ticket for a plane that left at nine in the morning.

When night fell, Wang Meilan and Huang Jiyuan started to get busy. Just like the time they went to visit Huang Wen in the Lin Family, Wang Meilan filled up several chests with spiritual treasures and herbs.

“Mom, we’re going to Tokyo for a holiday. We’re not there to visit our relatives, why do you need so many things?!” Huang Xiaolong sighed in defeat. 

As she threw even more items into another empty chest, Wang Meilan snapped, “Stop annoying me, you little brat. Uncle Dingming and your dad are childhood friends. We have to bring gifts over now that we’re visiting him! It’s not like we lack any of these treasures either.”

Staring at the chests of spiritual herbs and spiritual fruits, Huang Xiaolong revealed a helpless smile. “Uncle Dingming is the chairman of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce. He doesn’t lack any of this!”

“Humph! It doesn’t matter if he has them or not! These are proof of our sincerity. Didn’t you say that the herbs grown in the Blue Dragon Orchard are one of a kind? They won’t be able to buy them in the Japanese Alliance.” Wang Meilan snorted.

Turning to look at his father, brother, and sister, all of them saw the look of amusement in each other’s eyes.

“Xiaolong, why don’t you ask Sister Yuhan to come along with us?” Huang Wen chuckled all of a sudden.

“Yeah! It will be so much more fun with Sister Yuhan!” Huang Chenfei couldn’t help but join in the fun.

Looking at Huang Chenfei, Huang Xiaolong snapped, “You’re one to talk! You’ve been single for god knows how long now. It’s time for you to find a girlfriend.”

Scrunching his face up into a ball, Huang Chenfei’s face turned as red as a tomato.

“I heard that Chenfei found someone several days ago…” Huang Wen winked at Huang Xiaolong.

Staring at Huang Chenfei in shock, Huang Xiaolong continued, “Is that true? That’s great! Who is she?” 

Wang Meilan stopped chucking stuff into the chests as she turned around to stare at Huang Chenfei. “Little brat, why didn’t you tell me? Hurry up and tell us who the lady is!”

Clearly, Huang Chenfei didn’t tell anyone about the matter.

A look of joy formed on Huang Jiyuan’s face.

The two of them had made a lot of plans with regards to Huang Chenfei’s marriage arrangements. However, no one had fancied him with his semi-crippled body and their situation in the Huang Family.

When they heard that Huang Chenfei had finally found someone he liked, the two of them were jumping in joy.

“It’s someone from the Xiao Family in Huazhou City. She’s called Xiao Yu, but she doesn’t seem to know who I am.” Huang Chenfei looked at all of them with an embarrassed expression.

“Xiao Yu… That’s a nice name!” Wang Meilan smiled in response. “What does she look like? Is she tall? Is she skinny? Is she pretty?” 

“No, no, no. It doesn’t matter even if she isn’t that pretty. As long as she’s kind and filial, that’s all that matters. We won’t interfere with your decisions!”

Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter when he saw how happy his mother was.

Huang Wen giggled in amusement when she looked at Huang Chenfei’s uneasy expression.

“Mom… We only met thrice!” The corners of Huang Chenfei’s mouth started to twitch. “Moreover, I won’t need you guys to interfere with my matters!” 

“Nonsense! This concerns all of us!” Wang Meilan snapped. “You’re too innocent… I’m afraid you’ll be cheated by her!”

Another wave of laughter filled the space around them when Huang Xiaolong and Huang Wen heard how Wang Meilan described Huang Chenfei.

Huang Jiyuan chuckled in amusement. “He’s an adult now… Why are you afraid of him getting cheated on?!”

Wang Meilan glared at Huang Jiyuan and sneered, “What do you know? Go away and stop interrupting me.”

With a helpless sigh, Huang Jiyuan could only stand silently at the side.

“The patriarch of the Xiao Family seems to be called Xiao Cheng, right?” Wang Meilan turned to ask Huang Chenfei. “His reputation isn’t bad.”

Even though the Xiao Family wasn’t a powerful family, they were of considerable status in the city. Xiao Cheng was a mid-level Nascent Soul Realm expert.

As he had always been inclined to do charity work, he was a pretty famous person even in the Huaxia Alliance. Naturally, the Xiao Family’s financial prowess wasn’t too weak.

“Yes.” Huang Chenfei nodded. “Xiao Cheng is Xiao Yu’s uncle.”

A flash of light crossed Wang Meilan’s eyes. “That’s great. When we return from the Japanese Alliance, we shall make a trip over to the Xiao Family.”

Huang Chenfei jumped in fright when he heard where the conversation was headed. “No, no, no! This is going too quickly! We only met several times in the past, and you’ll scare her if we head over to the Xiao Family immediately!”

Huang Xiaolong remained silent as he chuckled to himself at the side.

The very next day…

The patriarch of the Huang Family, Huang Shengan, became a chauffeur for Huang Xiaolong and his family as they brought them over to the airport in Huazhou City.

Even though there were six of them who were going to the airport, the car Huang Shengan used was a special limousine built by the luxury car company, Rolls Royce. It could fit ten people easily, and they enjoyed a comfortable ride to the airport.

“Xiaolong, when did we buy this car for the family?” Huang Chenfei looked at the interior of the car and gasped in shock. His eyes flashed with excitement as he looked all around.

“I got them to customize the car for our family. This is the only kind in the world, and it arrived this morning.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Even the body of the car contained an insignia of a blue dragon, and the handles were stamped with the same crest. Everything about it screamed luxury.

“If you want another one, I’ll get them to make a few more,” Huang Xiaolong explained. 

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Chenfei exclaimed, “Wouldn’t it take quite a bit of money for them to customize all of it? This should cost more than ten million low-grade spirit stones, right?”

“Nope. It’s free.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Everyone stared at him in shock.

“Free?!” Huang Datou was the first to break the silence. He had seen several articles in the newspaper in the past, and he knew that a western prince had once ordered a personalized Rolls Royce. It cost more than ten million low-grade spirit stones and the price gobsmacked those who read the articles.

“Yeah, I didn’t pay a cent.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

During the battle, or beatdown, in the Purple Flame Sect, one of the old ancestors who submitted to Huang Xiaolong was the founder of the Rolls Royce Company! Who would dare to accept money from Huang Xiaolong after he flattened the Purple Flame Sect alone?!

When they arrived at the airport, Huang Xiaolong didn’t use the Huang Family’s authority to cut in line. Instead, they waited like everyone else.

Huang Shengan only left when Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the departure hall.

As there was still half an hour till their flight, Huang Xiaolong and the others found a place near the gate to take a short rest.

All of a sudden, the crowd broke into an uproar as a group of bodyguards clad in black suits and sunglasses entered the airport. They surrounded a pretty-looking lady who was wearing a windbreaker. A massive group of fans was screaming behind her.

“Pan Yingying, I love you!”

“Pan Yingying, can I get your autograph?”

“Pan Yingying!” Huang Datou stood up all of a sudden. “She’s my idol!”
