The disciples guarding the lowest level of the prison were the core disciples of the Snow Moon Hall. Once Huang Xiaolong entered the lowest level, he directly slapped aside these core disciples and planted them all into the wall.

However, when he arrived at the cell and saw his master Zhao Lei, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and his senior brother Chen Hao chained to a stone pillar, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned red.

Every one of them was bruised and had numerous scars. The flesh on Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s legs was scraped to the bone!

White bones!

Huang Xiaolong roared angrily, and the Radiance Divine Scepter appeared in his hand. He smashed it forward, and a white light emerged to shatter all the chains holding them to the wall.

Fang Xuanxuan and the rest of them were shocked.

The iron chains of the lowest prison level were made by chaos, which was refined thousands of times. Even a normal grandmist spiritual artifact would be unable to cut it apart. No one would have thought that the item in Huang Xiaolong’s hand would shatter them all at the same time.

Zhao Lei and the others who were tortured beyond recognition struggled to open their eyes and were shocked when they saw Huang Xiaolong.

By this time, Huang Xiaolong had already rescued everyone from the chains, and he appeared before them.

“Xiaolong, you’re finally back.” Zhao Lei said as he gasped for air. After all, he was an Emperor Realm expert. He was in a much better state than everyone else who had suffered the prison’s torture.

“Hurry up and leave, Zhou Chen has colluded with outsiders and schemed against our Fortune Emperor Palace. He even offered a bounty for capturing you.” Zhao Lei said impatiently, “You shouldn’t have returned! Hurry up and escape with Fang Xuanxuan, the further, the better!”

The expression of Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao became strange as they thought back to how tragically Zhou Chen had died.

Huang Xiaolong felt warm in his heart as he said, “Master, Zhou Chen is already dead. Don’t worry about me.”

Zhao Lei, who had originally wanted to ask Huang Xiaolong to run away, stopped dead in his tracks. He stared at Huang Xiaolong as though he had misheard. Even Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and Chen Hao were startled.

“You... What did you just say?” Zhao Lei asked incredulously, “Zhou Chen is dead?! Did you miss a word somewhere?!”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao almost burst out in laughter.

Huang Xiaolong felt extremely helpless, and he could only try to explain himself. “Zhou Chen has already died, and those men in black he brought with him are all dead as well. Alright, master, let me take care of your wounds first. If you still have any questions left, you can ask later.”

Huang Xiaolong then took out a few Great Brahma Sarira Pills.

“This... is this the Great Brahma Sarira Pill?!” Zhao Lei exclaimed in surprise.

Fang Mingyu’s eyes lit up at the sight of them. When he had suffered grave injuries in hell, Huang Xiaolong had taken out the same pill to heal him. The effects of the pill had left a very deep impression on him.

“This is indeed the Great Brahma Sarira Pill.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and then fed the four of them one pill each.

Very soon, vitality returned to the pale faces, and their complexion slowly turned rosy. A faint white halo appeared around their bodies.

Huang Xiaolong let out a sigh of relief when he saw this, and immediately after, he took out some black paste. As soon as he took it out, a heart calming fragrance filled the space around them. It even managed to suppress the smell of the Great Brahma Sarira Pill.

“This... could it be the Black Jade Dragon Blood Paste?!” Zhao Lei gasped. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Black Jade Dragon Blood Paste was an ointment that was even more precious than a top-grade grandmist spiritual pill. After using it, one’s bone and flesh could be regrown. The paste itself was refined using numerous grandmist spiritual ingredients by the Primordial Dragon Race.

Huang Xiaolong then applied the ointment on the bones of Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor. Bright and sacred energy radiated from his hand and enveloped the ointment that he had applied, and in an instant, rays of light fused with the black paste around Golden Brow and Blood Knife’s injuries.

An astonishing scene suddenly appeared as their arms and legs regrew at speed visible to the naked eye. Before long, their limbs were completely restored, as though they had never been injured in the first place.

“This!” Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor waved their arms with a look of surprise.

Even though they were in the God King Realm and could slowly regenerate their flesh, the regrown limbs could never be as strong as before. However, with the help of the Black Jade Dragon Blood Paste, they recovered to their peak state in an instant! No, it could even be said that they were stronger than they once were!

“Master, let’s get out of here first.” Huang Xiaolong said to Zhao Lei, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor before heading towards the prison’s exit.

“Xiaolong, earlier you said that Zhou Chen and the men in black had all died. What exactly happened?!” Zhao Lei couldn’t help asking on their way out.

Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong laughed and pointed towards the four odd beasts behind him, “They are the ones who killed them.”

Even though he was the one who had killed them in the end, it was only possible because of the four odd beasts.

“What?!” When they heard this, Zhao Lei and the rest turned and focused all of their attention on the four odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong. Like Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao, they were full of shock after scrutinizing the four odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong.

Even Fang Mingyu was taken aback.

“You... you are saying that they...” Zhao Lei stammered and asked with disbelief.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Both Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao can be my witness.”

Zhao Lei looked at the two of them, who nodded like chicken pecking on rice.

“Then... Special Envoy Chen and Special Envoy He...?” Zhao Lei asked.

“Dead.”

Everyone who had been trapped in the prison sucked in a breath of cold air.

Those were late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts! Wouldn’t that mean that the four beasts behind Huang Xiaolong...

“They are all peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts.” Huang Xiaolong explained as though he had already read their minds.

Peak late-Tenth Order Emperors! Zhao Lei, Fang Mingyu, and everyone else felt their bodies trembling.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even mention that the four odd beasts weren’t ordinary peak late-Tenth Order Realm Emperors. He casually left out the part where their combat prowess had already surpassed the Emperor Realm.

Despite that, no one knew how to react to the shocking news.

“Senior... four seniors, Zhao Lei from the Fortune Emperor Palace, pays his respect.” Zhao Lei’s heart was beating wildly as he clasped his hands respectfully to greet the four odd beasts.

On the other hand, Fang Mingyu, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and Chen Hao had no idea how to greet the four seniors.

Huang Xiaolong smiled when he saw how flustered Zhao Lei had become, “Master, they are my subordinates, you don’t have to be so polite with them.”

“Subor... Subordinates, Subordinates?!” Everyone felt as though a bomb went off in their head, and they stared at Huang Xiaolong in amazement.

These peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts were his subordinates?!

This!

They felt as though they were going to fall out of the sky as a wave of dizziness threatened to overwhelm them.

Even Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao found it inconceivable for the four odd beasts to be Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates.
