Chapter 3668 – Ghost Yin Race

“What is your name?” Huang Xiaolong asked as they left the city.

“Lord, my name is Jiang Dacheng. I am an eminent elder of the Jiang Family.” The man who volunteered to bring Huang Xiaolong to the Yin Ghost River replied hastily.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. Jiang Dacheng had comprehended three elements to the grand perfection level, and he should be from some tiny family in some celestial empire in the Green Ghost Lands.

“I wonder which family Lord comes from?” Jiang Dacheng asked cautiously. “I don’t mean any disrespect! I was just curious!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I’m not from the Green Ghost Lands.”

Jiang Dacheng gasped in fright. “Not from the Green Ghost Lands? Do you mean… You came from other continents?”

He didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would actually be able to cross the continents to arrive at their Green Ghost Lands.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Are you surprised?”

Jiang Dacheng scratched his head in embarrassment and chuckled, “Yeah. Not many people will come to our Green Ghost Lands. Lord, did you come for the Yin Ghost River?”

“Nope.” Huang Xiaolong replied casually. “I wanted to look for someone in the Fengdu City. I ran into news of the Yin Ghost River on the way and decided to check it out.”

Jiang Dacheng laughed along with Huang Xiaolong, “So that’s the case… Lord, you came at the right time! The Yin Ghost River only fills up every billions of years! If you reach the other side, you might be able to obtain some supreme treasures or opportunities!”

“Haha, alright! If I manage to get anything good, I’ll reward you heavily!”

“I’ll thank you in advance then!” Jiang Dacheng said casually. He didn’t think that it was possible for Huang Xiaolong to obtain anything good, but he accepted the other party’s good intentions.

“Lord, when we arrive at the Yin Ghost River, you must remember not to clash with the experts of other clans.” Jiang Dacheng reminded Huang Xiaolong earnestly. “There are countless experts who arrived this time. Even the Ghost Kings and old ancestors of the ancient races have come. Lord Nether Yang King and his son came this time too!”

In the Green Ghost Lands, Ghost Kings referred to experts at the God of Creation Realm.

“Is the Nether Yang King strong?” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

A solemn expression appeared on Jiang Dacheng’s face when he heard the Ghost King’s title. A heated gaze appeared in his eyes. “Of course he is! Lord Nether Yang King is super strong. He’s the strongest person in the Green Ghost Lands!”

“Strongest person in the Green Ghost Lands?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually. “Isn’t the Green Ghost the strongest expert here?”

An awkward chuckle left Jiang Dacheng’s lips. “Of course Lord Green Ghost is an exception! He hasn’t appeared in a long time! There are even some who say that Lord Green Ghost left the Green Ghost Lands some time ago. Other than Lord Green Ghost and Lord Gui Chi, Nether Yang King and the other ten kings are the strongest experts here!”

Huang Xiaolong said half jokingly, “Since he’s so strong, I have to get a taste of his power later…”

The blood drained from Jiang Dacheng’s face instantly. He jumped in fright, “Lord, you most definitely cannot! Lord Nether Yang King’s strength is something we cannot imagine! You must not infuriate him! Otherwise, no one will be able to save you! Lord Nether Yang King can kill half-step Universe Gods with a wave of his arms!”

“Those are half-step Universe Gods we’re talking about! Do you know how strong they are?!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he saw the terrified expression on Jiang Dacheng’s face. “Relax. I was joking! Why would I piss him off for no reason?”

Jiang Dacheng heaved a sigh of relief.

Several days later, the two of them arrived.

Looking at one of the riverbanks, countless experts of the Green Ghost Lands piled high on top of each other.

There were yin ghosts, humans, and ghost beasts ready to start their attempt to cross the river!

The humans gathered around each other, and the yin ghosts found an area of their own. The ghost beasts huddled around each other, away from the other two.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the river and noticed a giant empty spot. There was only a young man and a group of experts standing behind him. No one dared to approach the group.

When Jiang Dacheng saw that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over, his heart nearly leaped out of his chest. “Lord, you can’t go there!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Why not?”

“Those are members of the Yin Ghost Race. I know one of them! He’s the son of the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! The Heavenly Blood Ghost King is the overlord of the area and he’s a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage!”

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong grunted once and continued to make his way over. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Dacheng was shocked and he wanted to pull Huang Xiaolong back, but he missed.

“Hold it right there!” The experts of the Yin Ghost Race yelled when they saw Huang Xiaolong heading towards them. “Brat, this place belongs to Young Master Yue Qing! If you come one step closer, you better not blame us for throwing you into the river to feed the spirits!”

As the Yin Ghost River continued to rise, terrifying yin spirits would appear from time to time. They wouldn’t come up to the shore, but if anyone fell in, they would be devoured down to the last bone. Experts who fell in wouldn’t be able to return back to shore easily and in the end, they would also become yin spirits that roamed the river.

No one wouldn’t be terrified of the yin spirits.

Huang Xiaolong ignored them all as he continued to make his way over.

The experts standing around gasped in shock.

“Which family is he from? Is he crazy or deaf?”

“He might actually be deaf!”

Many people joked.

As the group of experts from the Yin Ghost Race saw Huang Xiaolong ignore their warnings, one of them reached over to throw him into the river.

Before he could touch Huang Xiaolong, he flew backwards and landed into the river himself.

As soon as he did, countless yin spirits swarmed him. They devoured him whole as his miserable screams rang through the air.

Widening their eyes in shock, the young man who was looking at the other side of the river turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. The person who flew into the water just a second ago was his subordinate, and it was one of his most loyal subordinates!

Yue Qing’s expression sank.
