Chapter 2737: Chen Birui?

Without warning, Huang Xiaolong pointed at Tang Yuan, and the man instantly blew up. Qiao Bai and the disciples of the other sacred land were scared stiff. All of them present were the youngest and most outstanding ones in their respective factions. They had guards protecting them everywhere they went, and they had never experienced such danger before!

First, it was Tang Jin, Yuan Yue, and Chu Zhouyun, and then it was He Ba. All of them were destroyed by Huang Xiaolong in a blink of an eye. In fact, it was respectable for the disciples present not to sh*t their pants.

Qiao Bai’s legs went soft in fear. He was the one who had alerted the upper echelons of the Ice Blue Sacred Land, and he knew that he would be doomed if Huang Xiaolong learned about it!

“Now, it’s time for all of you to make your choice. I hate repeating myself,” Huang Xiaolong snorted as he looked at those present.

As soon as he spoke, a loud thump could be heard as Qiao Bai fell to his knees. He wanted to keep his life, and he didn’t dare to dally in case Huang Xiaolong decided to kill him.

“Master Huang, I wish to serve you, I wish, I wish,” Qiao Bai rambled on.

Not only were the disciples of the Ice Blue Sacred Land surprised by his outburst, but the disciples of the other factions were equally as shocked. After all, Qiao Bai was a direct disciple of the patriarch of the Ice Blue Sacred Land.

“Senior Brother Qiao Bai, you traitor! Do you even know what you’re doing?! You’re betraying our master! You deserve death!” a fellow disciple jumped out and chided.

However, he was killed by Duan Feng with a flick of the finger as he turned into a rain of blood.

The rest of the disciples shuddered as they watched.

In the end, almost everyone chose to submit. There were a few who cursed Huang Xiaolong, but if curses worked, Huang Xiaolong would have died a miserable death a long time ago.

Without a doubt, all of them were killed by Duan Feng.

After gaining control of Qiao Bai and the others, Huang Xiaolong strolled over to Wang Xueru and invited her to take a trip over to the headquarters of the Ice Blue Sacred Land if she wasn’t in a rush to return.

“Why do you want to go to the headquarters of the Ice Blue Sacred Land?” Wang Xueru was still in a trance from what had happened. It was so overwhelming and unbelievable that it changed the perception of everyone about Huang Xiaolong.

It took her a long time to clear her head.

“Huang… Senior brother Huang!” Wang Xueru stumbled over her words.

Initially, she had felt that calling Huang Xiaolong ‘senior brother’ was a disgrace to herself. After all, his cultivation realm was lower than her.

Huang Xiaolong’s appearance had made her rather distressed. The Cangqiong Old Man was willing to take in someone weaker than her as a direct disciple, but he had only allowed her to remain as a named disciple!

Now, facing Huang Xiaolong again, she failed to hide her shock and a seed of fear was even planted in her heart.

She was terrified by his strength, and his vicious methods.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled at her mixed expression and extended her another invitation, “Junior Sister Wang, I’m heading to the headquarters of the Ice Blue Sacred Land. Do you wish to come along? Or would you like to return to the Cangqiong Sacred Land?”

He knew exactly what she felt.

Nodding slightly, Wang Xueru indicated that she would do as Huang Xiaolong said.

When he turned to look at the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land, all of them agreed to follow him to the Ice Blue Sacred Land.

Indeed, they were afraid of Huang Xiaolong. However, now that they had agreed to follow him, there was no need for him to explain himself.

Just like that, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, Duan Feng, and Fei Yanzi led the way as they charged towards the headquarters of the Ice Blue Sacred Land. Wang Xueru and the others followed closely behind.

There was no need to mention the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s destination. There was no way he would try to make peace with the patriarch of the Ice Blue Sacred Land.

From the moment he annihilated the Tang Jin, Yuan Yue, and He Ba’s physical body, he was destined to become mortal enemies with the Ice Blue Sacred Land. As for the Tang Dragon Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land, they were destined to die after Huang Xiaolong had gotten wind of them trying to end the Cangqiong Sacred Land.

Before the Ice Blue Sacred Land could join hands with the other two, Huang Xiaolong decided to get rid of them.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be afraid even if all three sacred lands came for him. However, it was better if he could get rid of them as quickly as he could.

As they approached the headquarters of the Ice Blue Sacred Land, the Ice Blue Patriarch had gathered in the hall with the other Primal Ancestors.

“The commotion earlier on came from the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak. Did He Ba make his move?” Hou Ting frowned.

The Thunder Fire Sacred Peak was located a distance away, but they were shocked to feel the commotion from so far away.

“From Qiao Bai’s report, a disciple of the Cangqiong Sacred Land, Huang Xiaolong, was the one who started the fight. The kid is a disciple of the Cangqiong Old Man, and he brought about a lot of Primal Ancestors with him. Is He Ba fighting against those Primal Ancestors?” someone asked.

Someone else suspected that Chen Birui was the one participating in the fight since his strength was comparable to He Ba. After all, it was possible that he had already arrived.

There were many sacred lands who would send their Primal Ancestor Realm experts out to fight for others, in return for spirit stones or money.

Chen Birui was one of the experts hired by the Cangqiong Sacred Land. He was a late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and he was the second strongest expert in the Cangqiong Sacred Land.

Hou Ting glared at the others icily and growled, “It must be Chen Birui. There is no one else strong enough to fight He Ba! How dare the Cangqiong Old Man ignore the rules of the Convent of Wind and Clouds? He dares to send a Primal Ancestor over to cause trouble! He’s clearly disregarding the rules set by all the sacred lands!”

The murderous intent in his heart intensified.

“This Cangqiong Old Man is asking to die! He has already offended the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the Freezing Desert Sacred Land. The two patriarchs want him dead!”

“Patriarch, even though the Cangqiong Sacred Land rose recently, I heard that their vault is extremely well equipped. They have tons of treasures! We cannot let the Tang Dragon Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land snatch our stuff!”

“That’s right, since the Cangqiong Old Man started it first by sending Primal Ancestors over to the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak to mess with us, we can use that as an excuse to destroy them!”

The Primal Ancestors of the Ice Blue Sacred Land babbled among themselves as they got ready to deal with the Cangqiong Sacred Land. They had been tempted by the vault for a long time, and that was a perfect excuse to make their move.

A grand elder of the Ice Blue Sacred Land barged into the hall suddenly.

“Patriarch, an expert from the Cangqiong Sacred Land is on his way here now!”

Hou Ting and the others were taken by surprise.

“Make yourself clear! What is going on? An expert of the Cangqiong Sacred Land?! Was that not Chen Birui?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
