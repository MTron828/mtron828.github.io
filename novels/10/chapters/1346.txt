Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders climbed up from the ground. They looked terrified as their attention fell on the void devil beast Xu Baisheng.

A Second Order God King Realm magical beast!

Absolutely above early Second Order God King Realm! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Had the void devil beast Xu Baisheng been merely an early Second Order God King Realm master, he absolutely couldn’t have broken the Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation in one strike!

In fact, Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, and Li Ye were right about the strength of the Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation.

In the last two years, with the effects of the Blue Spectre Spring and numerous chaos spiritual pills, void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s strength had recovered further.

Currently, his cultivation was at the peak late-Second Order God King Realm.

Huang Xiaolong rode on the little cow and approached Cao Fang. Deng Qishun and Li Ye were also nearby. Huang Xiaolong began with his usual aloof coldness, “You have one chance, submit to me, or die!”

“The three of you have two minutes to think about it!”

Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, and Li Ye’s faces tightened with anger, their expressions had never been so ugly.

“I don’t need your two minutes. This is total nonsense. Kill me if you want! Submitting a mere peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm ignorant junior is nothing but a joke!” Cao Fang stared poisonously at Huang Xiaolong, and added, “Even if you kill me today, one day, my avatar would avenge me!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong said nonchalantly. He then said to the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, “Since he wants to die, fulfill his wish!”

Cao Fang’s face clearly ashened. ‘Would this black-haired kid really kill him?!’

“Yes, Master!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng said in a frosty voice.

Master...! Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the rest of Sand Waves Sect’s group thought they had misheard Huang Xiaolong.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s giant claw fell on Cao Fang like a small mountain in the blink of an eye.

Cao Fang opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but before a word could come out, he was ruthlessly smashed deep into the ground by void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s claw. The ground quaked and spider web like cracks spread out rapidly. Deng Qishun and Li Ye retreated in panic.

“Is he still alive?” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng exclaimed in surprise. There was still Cao Fang’s breath even after his body had exploded.

Huang Xiaolong looked into the pit.

It was Cao Fang’s godhead!

Cao Fang’s godhead was actually a top emperor rank godhead, moreover, it was a top emperor rank godhead known for its powerful defense, the Extreme Clear Godhead.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng struck down again. His corrosive devil qi condensed into corrosive devil flames and it slammed onto Cao Fang’s Extreme Clear Godhead. Instantly, a heart-wrenching scream came from the inside of the godheads, but it only lasted for seconds.

Dead!

Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and other Sand Waves Sect’s Elders were deathly pale after witnessing Cao Fang being ruthlessly killed in front of them.

In the next second, Deng Qishun and Li Ye saw a cow picking up Cao Fang’s godhead and then she did something that dumbfounded the two of them—the cow put Cao Fang’s godhead into her mouth and crunched it into pieces!

“That doesn’t taste too bad!” The little cow commented while she continued munching, as if it was something delicious.

Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the others wished they could faint on the spot. ‘Is this really a cow?!’

And not some kind of fierce grandmist beast?!

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the little cow speechlessly. He then turned and fixed his gaze on Deng Qishun. “Now, you have two minutes to consider. Either submit to me like Zheng Guowen and Chen Zheng, or die! Choose yourself! Of course, if you submit to me, you can still continue being the Sand Waves Sect Ancestor, and still possess the same authority!”

Deng Qishun and Li Ye both hadn’t expected this.

Still have the same authority in Sand Waves Sect?! This made them hesitate!

On the side, Gui Yi began counting, “One hundred-twenty, one hundred nineteen, one hundred eighteen...!”

“Fine, I’m willing to submit!”Deng Qishun finally agreed by the time Gui Yi counted seventy.

But his face scrunched in anger when Huang Xiaolong ordered him to open his soul’s barrier.

Seeing his reaction, Zheng Guowen, Chen Zheng, and the other Grand Elders bitterly persuaded Deng Qishun.

In the end, Deng Qishun relented and opened his soul’s protective barrier which allowed Huang Xiaolong’s grandmist worms to merge within his godhead smoothly.

Li Ye was next in line after Deng Qishun. Having Deng Qishun and Cao Fang as examples, Li Ye also chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong.

Subsequently, it were the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders’ turns. Even though some of the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders were unwilling, they were powerless to resist. In the end, they too submitted.

“Lockdown the Wind Waves Desert, and look for Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars!” Huang Xiaolong ordered Deng Qishun and Li Ye.

‘Though Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars won’t raise much of a wave, it’d be better to uproot all troubles.’

“Yes, Manor Lord!” Deng Qishun complied respectfully. He ordered the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders to lockdown the Wind Waves Desert, as well as hunt for Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars.

“You, bring me to the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury!” Huang Xiaolong said to Li Ye. He complied respectfully, then turned to lead Huang Xiaolong to their Sand Waves Sect’s treasury.

Huang Xiaolong followed Li Ye on the little cow, followed by Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, Xu Baisheng, and the group of chaos spiritual beasts behind him. As for Zheng Guowen, Chen Zheng, and the rest of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders, Huang Xiaolong had them accompany Deng Qishun to deal with Cao Fang and Chen Wenli’s avatars.

Half an hour later, after flying through layers of restrictive formations, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the Sand Waves Sect’s core area.

Although the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury was surrounded by numerous layers of restrictive formations, they did not meet with any troubles along the way due to Li Ye’s guidance. It didn’t take them long to reach Sand Waves Sect’s treasury.

The Sand Wave’s Sect’s treasury had humongous steel doors. Even without Huang Xiaolong’s instruction, Li Ye took the initiative to deactivate the restrictive formations placed on the steel door, and opened them. He then retreated to the side, gesturing Huang Xiaolong to enter.

Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, and the others stepped inside.

The moment Huang Xiaolong entered the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury, they came upon a vast plain. Above the plain were a sea of crystal balls the size of a football.

Inside every crystal ball were mountains of chaos spiritual herbs, divine pills, spirit stones, divine armors, and other divine artifacts.

Though Huang Xiaolong and the others had expected the Sand Waves Sect’s treasury to be wealthy from nearly a hundred million years of accumulation, they were still astounded by what they saw.

But the little cow seemed blase as she sauntered to the plains leisurely.

“Wishful Golden Flowers, Black Flames Ganoderma!” Huang Xiaolong halted when he saw inside one of the crystal balls. There were several hundred kinds of chaos spiritual herbs, and two of them were the ones he had been looking for!

Huang Xiaolong could hardly control his excitement. ‘The Sand Waves Sect’s treasury does have the Wishful Golden Flower, and even the Black Flames Ganoderma!’

In other words, he finally had all the herbal ingredients to refine the Brilliant Black Soul Divine Pill!

Suddenly, the little cow reacted as if she had seen a peerless treasure. She was full of excitement as she flew towards a crystal ball in a streak of light.

Her action stoked Huang Xiaolong and the others’ curiosity. They looked into the crystal ball, and inside was a strange item, but they couldn’t see anything special.

“It really is! It’s really the Firmament Bear’s soul crystal! The desolate era’s Firmament Bear Clan’s soul crystal!” The little cow exclaimed in excitement.
