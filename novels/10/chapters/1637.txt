In truth, it wasn’t only the Mohe Plane, but the whole Asura World, no, in fact it was Hell’s all three worlds’ experts, who strongly felt like something was taken away at the same time!

“This, what happened?!”

“Did someone from Hell successfully break through, surpassing the existence of Emperor Realm?!”

“Im-impossible, right? I think it’s more likely a treasure is about to be born!”

“Could it be related to the Holy Mountain’s impending appearance?”

There were surging undercurrents through Hell’s three worlds from this incident.

The black light that appeared above the Green Flame Mountain Range vanished a split second later. It was gone too fast for the old monsters in Hell’s three worlds to explore.

......

Hell’s Spirits World.

At the Nine Yin Mountain Range, inside the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters’ main hall was a giant figure in meditation amidst dense roiling death qi. Sporadic screams could be heard from this roiling death qi, screams that would send a chilling cold down an Emperor Realm expert’s spine.

The giant figure was none other than the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor, Shi Ming!

His face was obscured by the dense death qi around him.

Further down from Shi Ming, a middle-aged man sat cross-legged, completely wrapped in corpse cloth.

On the corpse cloth were mysterious runes condensed out of death qi, exuding an eerie aura. This middle-aged man was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang.

Wushuang, means unparalled heaven and earth, he was the only one.

"Shuang, that phenomenon just now, what do you think?" The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming broke the silence. His voice seemed to contain an unparalleled power that incite despair.

“Maybe someone succeeded in refining a grandmist treasure?! The power of a grandmist treasure triggered strong spatial fluctuations?” The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Patriarch Shi Wushuang took a guess.

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming shook his head, his expression solemn as he stated, “Unlikely.” He went on, “It is likely someone has obtained Hell’s most origin energy, and at the last moment of refinement, it triggered Hell’s three worlds’ spatial fluctuations as the origin energy was extracted away!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hell’s origin energy!” The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang exclaimed in shock, inwardly thinking, ‘Could it be the origin energy transformed from the heart of Hell?’

Old Ancestor Shi Ming’s eyes gleamed as he spoke, “Perhaps!”

Without seeing it with his own eyes, Shi Ming couldn’t say for certain.

“How’s the investigation about Huang Xiaolong progressing?” Old Ancestor Shi Ming then asked, changing the subject.

“We have confirmed that Huang Xiaolong has entered the Asura World, but the Asura World is too big, it’s still an arduous task to fish him out. However, I’ve already ordered Shi Siyang to head to the Asura World. As long as he can find Huang Xiaolong, he can kill at all cost!” The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang reported.

Shi Siyang was one of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Elders, a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert! Sending a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert proved the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s determination to kill Huang Xiaolong.

“Increase the search effort! Send Shi Qingqiu there as well, make sure there is no accident, Huang Xiaolong cannot be allowed to leave Asura World alive. Also, the Holy Mountain is about to appear and Huang Xiaolong might head there. Have Shi Siyang and Shi Qingqiu pay special attention to those geniuses of unclear backgrounds that try to ascend the Holy Mountain. As long as there’s doubt, kill!” Old Ancestor Shi Ming ordered icily.

Shi Qingqiu was also a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

“Yes, Old Ancestor.” Patriarch Shi Wushuang complied.

At the same time, inside the inheritance hall within the City of Eternity.

Huang Xiaolong stood in midair, surrounded with a faint black light. The sight was as if Huang Xiaolong was born as the king of hell!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart was thumping in a strange rhythm inside his chest. He could clearly feel his heart beat, and there was a sound of heartbeat across Hell’s three worlds following his heartbeat.

His heart seemed to be the heart of Hell’s three worlds.

The beginning of Hell’s three worlds, seemed to be inside this heart!

“The heart of hell.” Huang Xiaolong whispered under his breath. His body exuded a superior noble air. The black light he had been absorbing was transformed by the heart of hell.

Now, he had preliminarily refined the heart of hell, merging it with his own heart.

Generally speaking, when a cultivator’s soul was destroyed, his death was certain. But now that Huang Xiaolong had merged with the heart of hell, even if his soul and godheads were destroyed, as long as his heart remained, he would not perish!

More importantly, the heart of hell was the condensation of Hell’s purest origin energy. Anywhere within the Hell’s three worlds, even a high-level Emperor Realm expert was incapable of destroying Huang Xiaolong’s heart of hell.

Thus, except for those few old monsters, no one in Hell could truly kill Huang Xiaolong!

Thinking of this, ecstasy gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

In other words, after merging with the heart of hell, he was now the new generation of Lord of Hell!

But his strength was still low enough for him to be able to fully exert the heart of hell’s power. Wait until he breaks through to Emperor Realm, he would be able to control Hell’s three worlds, and at that time, as long as he was in Hell, no one could kill him.

Not even existences like the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, Devil World’s Archdevil Lord, or people similar to his Master, the King of Grandmist, could kill him. Unless that person was capable of destroying Hell’s three worlds simultaneously, then only they might be able to kill him. Then again, even if ten thousand experts of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s level joined hands, they won’t be able to destroy Hell’s three worlds.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Netherworld King’s Jade hovering in front of him. It was time he refined the fifth restriction within it.

His current mid-Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm was more than sufficient to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade’s fifth restriction.

Without wasting any time, Huang Xiaolong activated both the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool and chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool’s power. Streaks of chaos golden dragon lightning and chaos black tortoise lightning rushed out and wrapped the Netherworld King’s Jade. The Netherworld King’s Jade shone brightly, and an archdevil condensed out of darkness element energy and appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong manipulated the golden dragon lightning’s power and black tortoise lightning’s power, entangled around the archdevil. With a forceful tug, the archdevil was pulled towards Huang Xiaolong’s front. Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and sucked in the air. The archdevil elongated into a stream of darkness element energy and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Several years later.

The archdevil was cleanly absorbed by Huang Xiaolong.

In the past, it had been a battle of life and death every time Huang Xiaolong had refined one of the Netherworld King’s Jade restrictions, but this time, it was the easiest of all.

With the heart of hell, he wouldn’t need to worry about the risks of backlash when refining the Netherworld King’s Jade in the future.

“Peak late-Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he checked his own cultivation realm after he was done refining the fifth restriction in the Netherworld King’s Jade.

It’s time to go out.

Huang Xiaolong kept the Netherworld King’s Jade away and took a step forward. In the next moment, he was out of the hall. Another step later, he was already outside the City of Eternity’s gates.
