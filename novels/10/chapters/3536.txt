Chapter 3537: Die A Miserable Death

 

Before he entered seclusion, his intention was to head over to the Black Sea. Even though he entered the Eternal Heaven Alliance and could receive their protection, he knew that he was never truly safe.

In the future, he knew that his secrets would eventually be revealed. When that happened, people would learn that he had three great worlds, and he fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree! When that happened, even the members of the Eternal Heaven Alliance might scheme against him! As such, Huang Xiaolong needed to look for a safe space in the First Universe before anything of the sort happened.

The moment he located a naturally formed great world in the Black Sea, he would be able to refine its world origin. When he hid in the world, he wouldn’t be afraid of half-step Universe Gods!

As he traveled towards the Black Sea, he arrived at the territory of the Creation Palace before long.

The moment he entered, he became even more careful with his actions.

Half a month passed, and the Black Sea was within reach. He would arrive in less than two years. 

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at one of the inhabited planets, he slowly descended.

As the area was close to the Black Sea, dense dark mist covered the area. One couldn’t see their hands if they placed them out in front of them, and Huang Xiaolong decided to take a short break before continuing.

According to his understanding, the black mist around the sea would subside every once in a while.

Not too long after he arrived, he noticed several other figures flying towards him. It was clear that every single one of them was a God of Creation Realm expert.

Releasing his dao soul, he discovered someone who was from the Eternal Heaven Alliance. He recognized the man, and he was called Han Zaifei. He was one of Wang Meiqi’s old acquaintances.

Wang Meiqi knew several other people in the Eternal Heaven Alliance, and there were two other suitors who entered the God of Creation Realm. One of them was Han Zaifei, but his strength was barely comparable to Jin Shenglin and Huang Zongquan. He barely had 2 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

There were two people following closely behind, and they were in hot pursuit. The two Gods of Creation behind him were from the Creation Palace, and the two of them were a lot stronger than Han Zaifei. Both had more than 2.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

Racing to surround him, the two of them eventually pincered Han Zaifei.

“Han Zaifei, hand the World Evading Pearl over,” one of the short and fat God of Creation sneered as he reached his hand out towards the man.

In the millions of years Huang Xiaolong spent in the Eternal Heaven Alliance, he gained a clear understanding of the powers in the First Universe. The short and fat God of Creation was called Chu Long, and the other was called Kong Wufang.

The only thing that shocked Huang Xiaolong was the fact that Han Zaifei had the World Evading Pearl. The World Evading Pearl was one of the rarest treasures in the First Universe, and it might not be at the same level as the four universe origin fires or the Star Dragon Divine Tree, but it was close.

How in the world did Han Zaifei obtain the World Evading Pearl?

“Han Zaifei, there is no escape!” Kong Wufang snorted, “Hand it over now!” 

Han Zaifei saw that he was surrounded, and he growled, “If I hand it over, do you swear to leave me alone?!” 

Chu Long roared with laughter the moment the words left Han Zaifei’s lips. “Leave you alone?! Do you think that’s possible?! Do you think we’ll allow the news of the World Evading Pearl to spread?”

“I can swear an oath on the universe dao that I won’t spread the news,” Han Zaifei added.

Shaking his head slowly, Kong Wufang sighed, “Do you think we’re stupid?”Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Turning into a streak of light, Han Zaifei tried to make his escape. It was too bad Chu Long’s sword sliced into his back the moment he moved. Han Zaifei was sent smashing into the planet below, and as luck would have it, he landed right beside Huang Xiaolong.

Chu Long and Kong Wufang charged at Han Zaifei, and they quickly discovered Huang Xiaolong. They were shocked to discover his presence as they weren’t expecting to see anyone on the uninhabited planet.

Huang Xiaolong had retracted his aura completely, and he knew that they wouldn’t be able to detect him with their strength. However, he didn’t expect them to appear right in front of him.

“Huang Xiaolong! Fellow Cultivator Huang!” Han Zaifei seemed to have seen his savior, and he cried out in shock.

Chu Long and Kong Wufang were stunned for a second, but joy soon filled their hearts. “Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong of the Eternal Heaven Alliance!

Everyone knew that he had Star Dragon Scales on him, and the amount he had was more than enough for them to go crazy!

Chu Long and Kong Wufang stared at each other before bellowing with laughter.

The news of Huang Xiaolong leaving the alliance had long since spread, and every single God of Creation in the First Universe was looking for him! They were either looking for him to make a trade, or they were waiting to hunt him down. Of course, the latter was more likely.

Now, he appeared right in front of them!

Chu Long roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would run all the way here?!” 

When he laughed, his eyes narrowed into slits.

“Huang Xiaolong, let’s not beat about the bush. Hand over all your Star Dragon Scales,” Kong Wufang sneered.

With a weird look on his face, Huang Xiaolong decided to play along. “Do you know who my sworn brother is?! He’s the Star Dragon, Ao Xing!”

Chu Long and Kong Wufang chuckled.

“Of course we do. We’re afraid of the Star Dragon Couple as much as everyone else, but so what?! I’m so afraid of them, but I’m still going to kill you anyway! What are you going to do?! It’s not like you can escape from this place! As long as we wipe away all evidence of your death, they won’t be able to discover the truth!” The fat man chuckled as his belly bounced about.

Kong Wufang snickered at the side.

When Huang Xiaolong entered the Eternal Heaven Alliance, he displayed 2.3 billion units of grand cosmos energy. According to them, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to improve by too much even if he had several million years to train! To the two of them, Huang Xiaolong was a walking treasure trove!

Han Zaifei suddenly thought of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, and his excited expression sank.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong was completely indifferent as he looked at the two. When the two of them were still confused, he made his move. 

Before Han Zaifei could react, the two of them were sent flying.

Slamming into the earth, the two of them stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. Even Han Zaifei couldn’t believe his eyes.

“You… Peak of the small completion stage!” Chu Long crawled to his feet as a trace of fear formed on his face.

Kong Wufang was stuck in a state of disbelief. He couldn't believe how quickly Huang Xiaolong cultivated!

Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards them, and he snickered in his heart. He barely used the strength of his first great world, but it was more than enough to deal with the two.

The two of them didn’t care to hesitate as they crushed the transmission symbol in their hands! They notified the experts of the Creation Palace instantly!

“Be careful!” Han Zaifei yelled when he saw their actions, but it was too late.

Kong Wufang and Chu Long sneered after they crushed the transmission symbol.

“Huang Xiaolong the experts of my Creation Palace will arrive shortly. You’ll die a miserable death!”
