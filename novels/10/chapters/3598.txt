Chapter 3599 – Yin Yang City

No one knows how many people were in the Death God Army, and not even the marshals there were privy to the information! Only the God of Death was aware of the strength his army possessed.

The faces of Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were solemn when they spoke of the Death God Army.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He knew that he would break through the 20 billion units mark soon, and when that happened, he would definitely head over to the Land of Death in order to exchange pointers with the God of Death.

One day later, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi left Huang Xiaolong’s manor after bowing respectfully.

When he saw their leaving figures, Huang Xiaolong fell deep into thought. Since Lin Qiankun had a batch of universe-level spiritual veins up for grabs, he had to pay the man a visit.

It might not be worth it for others to make the trade with Lin Qiankun, but that wasn’t the case for Huang Xiaolong!

He had tons of top-grade creation artifacts!

Kun Feng, Kai Dong, Hong Xuan, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong possessed one each. All of them belonged to him after what happened in the First Universe.

Adding on the two flying ships in the Creation Palace, he had seven top-grade creation artifacts from the First Universe alone!

There was also Huang Sheng and Yu Long. All in all, he had more than ten top-grade creation artifacts on him, and they were completely useless! He might as well trade them for some treasures.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong summoned Tao Hang and Tao Han’er.

“Lord, are you really planning to go to the Yin Yang Celestial Empire?!” Tao Hang and Tao Han’er were taken aback by his sudden decision.

The two of them had always been afraid that Huang Xiaolong would leave the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, and it seemed that the day had come.

“That’s right. From what Jin Hai and Wei Zhi said, Lin Qiankun has a batch of universe-level spiritual veins he wishes to trade. I’ll make a trip over there in a few days.”

“We will follow you to Yin Yang City!” Tao Han’er said.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly and sighed, “No. You can stay here and continue to cultivate in peace. I’ll get Golden Bear, Poison Dragon, Silver Wolf, and Black Lion to stay behind to guide you in your cultivation. After I leave, you can look for Jin Hai and Wei Zhi if you run into any trouble. I spoke to them earlier, and they will definitely solve any problem you run into.”

In fact, he didn’t have to say anything and the two of them would help Tao Hang and Tao Han’er anyway.

However, Tao Han’s eyes started to turn red as tears threatened to fall from them. “I really wish to follow you to Yin Yang City!”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second and he stared at her silently.

Tao Hang quickly pulled her sleeves and he cried, “Han’er, you’ll only inconvenience the lord if you follow him over!”

Tears started to stream down her face, and Huang Xiaolong quickly waved his hands in response. “There’s nothing inconvenient about it. However, I won’t be staying there for long. In the future, I’ll head over to the Ice Mountain to meet Zhou Chi. I might even go to the Sleepless Sea! If you follow me around, your cultivation will be affected!”

“We’ll cultivate well even if we follow you around…” Tao Han’er pouted.

Falling silent for a moment, Huang Xiaolong eventually sighed, “Alright. When we arrive in Yin Yang City, you can stay there for some time to cutivate. When I go to the Ice Mountain and Sleepless Sea in the future, you won’t be able to follow me anymore. It’s too dangerous.”

“Alright!” Tao Han’er revealed a brilliant smile after hearing what he said while complicated emotions filled Tao Hang’s heart.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong left for Yin Yang City with the two of them and the five beast kings.

Jin Hai and Wei Zhi led the experts of the various families to see him off.

When they looked at his leaving figure, Wei Zhi spoke softly to Jin Hai, “Brother Jin Hai, do you really think Lord Huang is a half step Universe God?”

Half step Universe God?! Jin Chengguang and the others nearly fainted when they heard his evaluation.

The members of the Tao Family felt their legs going soft.

“Perhaps…” Jin Hai paused for a second before answering. He wasn’t sure himself.

After all, only half step Universe Gods would possess top-grade creation artifacts. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jin Hai turned to stare at everyone and he growled, “We merely made guesses about Lord Huang’s strength. None of you are allowed to spread rumors! If Lord Huang hears anything out there, he’ll definitely settle the score with you!”

Jin Chengguang and the others quickly swore an oath to keep themselves in check.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong and the others left the territory of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire.

They were still quite some way away from the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, and Huang Xiaolong decided to use the Blue Dragon Flying Ship.

Since the Blue Dragon Flying Ship had already surpassed the level of top-grade creation artifacts, it took them less than a month to arrive. As soon as they entered the territory of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the flying ship.

They rode on the beast kings as they headed towards the capital.

After several days, they arrived.

As Lin Qiankun was the oldest half step Universe God in the Limitless Land, his status was something Jin Hai couldn’t begin to compare to. Jin Hai barely entered the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, and Lin Qiankun was already a half step Universe God! Yin Yang City was several times the scale of Golden Sea City!

“It’s so crowded here!” Tao Han’er couldn’t help but exclaim the moment they arrived.

The two of them felt like country bumpkins now that they entered Yin Yang City.

Tao Hang and Tao Han’er gawked at the structures along the street.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the look of excitement on Tao Han’er’s face. “I’ve heard from Jin Hai that there’s a dish called the Bathing Phoenix in the city. Let’s try it later tonight.”

Even though Huang Xiao Long was an expert at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, he still loved to enjoy delicacies.

“Alright!” Tao Han’er jumped in joy.

As for Tao Hang, he chuckled slightly, “Back in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire, I heard many experts talking about the Bathing Phoenix. It’s said that that’s one of the tastiest dish in the Limitless Land, and it costs three million dao coins for a single serving!”

“Three million dao coins?!” Tao Han’er was stunned.

She was a mere True Saint, and ten thousand dao coins was a fortune to her! Much less three million…

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “We’ll look for Jin Hai’s manor in the city before going for dinner!”

When Jin Hai learned that Huang Xiaolong was headed there, he gave Huang Xiaolong the manor he had in the city! The manor was something he purchased a long time ago, and it had been empty since he bought it.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony as he accepted the gift. After all, a manor might be unattainable for ordinary experts, but for experts at the God of Creation Realm, purchasing a manor in a capital city was nothing special. It’ll probably cost him some spare change, nothing more.
