Chapter 2948: I Am the Real Son of Creation

Contrary to Li Xue’s aghast expression, Yin Yue, who was clutching her mouth tightly with her hands, stared at Huang Xiaolong with sparkling eyes, making her look even more beautiful than usual.

Huang Shuai who had been looking at Huang Xiaolong with a condescending superiority, and smug arrogance, was shaking when he saw the heaven-propping golden dragon behind Huang Xiaolong. He was shaking from his dao soul to his skin.

Huang Shuai’s face was deathly pale as he stared fixedly at the golden dragon of creation behind Huang Xiaolong, “You, you, you are?!”

The few words seemed to be heavier than ten thousand catties, too heavy for Huang Shuai to utter them.

“I am Huang Xiaolong,” Huang Xiaolong stated unhurriedly.

That’s right, he was Huang Xiaolong! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

But, he was also the Son of Creation at the same time!

Huang Shuai felt something stuck uncomfortably in his chest, and he felt like he was going to vomit blood.

“Why is it like this? No, you’re not the Son of Creation. It’s me. I am the real Son of Creation!” Huang Shuai suddenly roared, and he pointed the tips of his blades at Huang Xiaolong, “You’re a fake! Huang Xiaolong, how dare you pretend to be the Son of Creation. That’s a crime worthy of clan annihilation!”

“Get on your knees and beg a quick death for your crime!”

Huang Shuai was clearly agitated, and he was close to running amok.

At this time, Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng finally reacted, and plummeted to the ground. He fell to his knees before Huang Xiaolong and greeted, “Bi Cheng greets His Highness Huang Xiaolong. Your Highness is mighty and invincible!”

As one of the vassals who had served under Lord Huang Long, he knew a lot more secrets than others. He already had some thoughts when he had seen Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, and now, seeing Huang Xiaolong’s creation dragon, he no longer had any doubts.

When the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng knelt to Huang Xiaolong, Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun, Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingye, and remaining seven top-tier patriarchs were stunned, but they reacted a moment later, and all of them were kneeling on the ground in no time.

“Wu Kun, Hu Qingye…. Greets His Highness Huang Xiaolong. Your Highness is mighty and invincible!”

Other creeds’ patriarchs, ancient races’ patriarchs, and genesis races’ patriarchs quickly follow suit. The other forces weren’t slow either. All of them were either kneeling or prostrating on the ground.

“We greet Your Highness Huang Xiaolong!”

“Your Highness is mighty and invincible!”

Ten thousand experts’ voices rose to the sky, shaking heaven and earth.

At that moment, outside the Dragon Fish City, except for Huang Xiaolong and Huang Shuai, everyone was on the ground.

After watching Bi Cheng and the others kneel and prostrate to Huang Xiaolong, Huang Shuai was alone on his side, looking despondent. In the past, even when Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, and the others had acknowledged that he was the Son of Creation, none of them had ever knelt to him, but now, these old men were kneeling to Huang Xiaolong!

Really kneeling on their knees, with utmost reverence and respect!

Huang Shuai pointed at Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, and the others, bellowing furiously, “You, all of you, I am the real Son of Creation. Have all of you gone blind?! Huang Xiaolong’s a fake!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered because at this juncture, Huang Shuai still couldn’t sober up and see reality. It looked like he had been playing the Son of Creation role for far too long, and he had made himself believe that he was really the Son of Creation.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to capture Huang Shuai and retrieve the Huang Long Cape, suddenly, an extremely sharp dagger appeared from the void and stabbed at Huang Xiaolong’s back.

This dagger was sharper than Huang Shuai’s Golden Dragon Twin Blades!

More importantly, the person wielding the dagger and attacking Huang Xiaolong had an aura stronger than Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and the others!”

This was definitely a powerful peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert!

A peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable wielding a peak-grade dao artifact dagger was trying to assassinate Huang Xiaolong!

Terrifying coercion enveloped Huang Xiaolong in an instant, and never before at any other time had Huang Xiaolong felt such danger.

Even with the powers of three worlds protecting his body, as well as his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, Huang Xiaolong had never felt such strong danger.

Huang Xiaolong had an inclination that the dagger could tear through his three worlds’ powers and pierced a gaping hole through his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, giving him a severe injury. And this injury might affect his future cultivation.

Just as the other party made a move, Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and others’ heads jerked up upon sensing something. Their faces tightened, and they cried out in unison, “Your Highness, watch out!”

But it was already too late for them to stop that person.

Zi! The dagger tore through Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds’ protective barrier, and successfully stabbed onto Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth.

However, when the dagger came in contact with Huang Xioalong’s body, it emitted a loud ‘zheng’ noise, and sparks flew. A resounding dragon roar that contained heavenly might sounded and everyone saw a golden dragon flying out from the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The assassin couldn't help exclaiming when he saw the golden dragon, “Huang Long Armor!”

Huang Long Armor!

Others were just as shocked.

Upon seeing that his attempt to kill Huang Xiaolong had failed, the peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable did not linger. In a flicker, he grabbed Huang Shuai, tore space, and disappeared from the spot.

“Chase!” Huang Xiaolong reacted immediately and shouted.

Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and the rest of the ten top-tier creeds’ patriarchs tore space and disappeared on the spot as they went after the assassin and Huang Shuai.

Everyone looked confused as no one had foreseen it would end like this.

Bi Cheng and the others returned a while later with sullen expressions. Clearly, the assassin, and Huang Shuai had escaped.

“Your Highness, forgive us, we…” Bi Cheng bowed as he wanted to explain.

“I know.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, cutting off Bi Cheng’s explanation. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised that Bi Cheng and the others had failed to capture that person. After all, that attack just now had proven that person’s terrifying strength. That person’s strength was above Bi Cheng and the other patriarchs.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered. Who was that person? What is his connection with Huang Shuai?

Because that person was entirely enshrouded in golden fog, Huang Xiaolong didn’t get a look at his face, or his physical features. But Huang Xiaolong sensed the dragon power contained within that dagger!

That person had to be someone from the dragon race!

Moreover, it was definitely a high-level member of the dragon race, that person’s dragon qi was very pure, indicating that his dragon bloodline was very high.

Someone from the Holy Dragon Race?

Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and the others were uneasy at Huang Xiaolong’s silence. After all, they were blind earlier for taking Huang Shuai as the Son of Creation, and they had jointly issued a bounty for Huang Xiaolong’s capture with Huang Shuai!

If Huang Xiaolong blamed them, then…?

“Your Highness, how about entering the Dragon Fish main hall with us?” Wu Kun mustered up some courage and asked cautiously, “We were unaware of Your Highness’ identity earlier, and nearly made a grave mistake. Hope Your Highness can give us a chance to compensate for our mistake.”

“Yes ah, Your Highness,” Bi Cheng quickly followed up, “The day after tomorrow is the Creation Ceremony. The ten creeds can announce to the world, at that time, that Your Highness is our ten creeds’ young patriarch!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Bi Cheng, do you think I value the ten creeds’ young patriarch position?”

Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, and the others were stomped.

All along, Huang Shuai had taken to becoming the young patriarch position of ten creeds as his honor, but they had forgotten, Huang Xiaolong was no Huang Shuai.

“Moreover, the Creation Ceremony is something you were going to hold for Huang Shuai. What has it got to do with me?”

Huang Xiaolong pointed out tepidly and left with Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng, disappearing from sight, leaving a sea of experts crouching on the ground.

Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and the others watched Huang Xiaolong leave dazedly. A while later, Bi Cheng smiled bitterly. “His Highness blames us.”

But it was understandable that Huang Xiaolong held grudges.

Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and the others also showed bitter expressions.

However, Liu Xinxin’s dao soul muttered under her breath, “Don’t want, then don’t want. What’s so great about you?”
