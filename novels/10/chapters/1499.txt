Originally, Bei Xiaomei had been doubtful of the little cow’s words. While she was on her way to see her father, she had hesitated to interrupt her father’s meeting, thinking if she should turn back. But now, watching her father’s reaction..., could the little cow’s words be true? Does she and father really know each other?

Even the Myriad Swords Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Zhao Shihai was astonished whilst baffled at the same time watching Bei Lengyang’s reaction. He had known Bei Lengyang for several hundred million years, and rarely had he seen Bei Lengyang so excited. In truth, this was the first time he was seeing Bei Lengyang lose his composure.

As the Silver Fox Commerce’s President, he had seen too many things and had long been indifferent to worldly matters. Hence, there were a very few things that could affect his emotions this way.

However...!

Zhao Shihai’s eyes fell onto the token in Bei Lengyang’s hands.

He was aware of the Silver Fox Commerce’s several grades of silver fox tokens, but looking at the cow head at the center of the token in Bei Lengyang’s hand, he was as confused as Bei Xiaomei. Did the Silver Fox Commerce issue this kind of token?

“It is, it really is ah!” Bei Lengyang exclaimed as he held the token with trembling hands. It seemed like the more he looked at the token, the more excited he became.

Bei Xiaomei was completely stupefied. It is really what?!!

Is this token really genuine or fake?!!

“Xiaomei, quick, tell me, quickly tell me, that Senior, where is she now?! Hurry, hurry, take me to her!” Bei Lengyang finally snapped out from his overexcitement and rushed his daughter Bei Xiaomei. He actually pulled his daughter’s hand and went out in a haste, completely forgetting Zhao Shihai, the Myriad Swords Emperor Palace’s Ancestor’s existence.

Bei Lengyang’s footsteps halted after he took a few steps as he remembered Zhao Shihai was still in the hall. He turned and seemed a little embarrassed as he said, “Brother Zhao, I have something to tend to, please excuse me as I won’t be able to continue with our discussion today.”

Zhao Shihai stood up, chuckling as he cupped his fists at Bei Lengyang. “Why place such courtesy between us? Since you have something to tend to, it’s just the same we continue our discussion of dao next time. How about, I accompany you to meet this Senior?”

Zhao Shihai was very curious about the ‘Senior’ Bei Lengyang had spoken about. Merely a single token had made Bei Lengyang so excited.

Not to mention, there were not many people in the entire Divine World worthy of being called ‘Senior’ by Bei Lengyang!

Could it be the King of Grandmist? Or one of those old monsters from the same generation as the King of Grandmist?

If ‘Senior’ was the King of Grandmist or one of those same generation old monsters, then they were worthy of being Bei Lengyang’s ‘Senior.’

Bei Lengyang showed a troubled expression at Zhao Shihai’s request. “Brother Zhao, that Senior’s temperament is a little strange. If I bring you to see her like this, I don’t know if she would...?”

“It’s alright, I was just asking casually.” Zhao Shihai laughed it away.

“If I get Senior’s permission, I would bring Brother Zhao next time?” Bei Lengyang added as an afterthought.

“That’s a good idea.” Zhao Shihai nodded his head, then added, “I’ll trouble Brother Bei then.”

Bei Lengyang did not dally further, pulling Bei Xiaomei out of the hall in a haste. He ordered Bei Xiaomei to take him to the Senior who had given her the token.

On the way, Bei Xiaomei couldn’t help feeling curious. Even her father had to call Little Cowie, Senior?

Hasn’t the little cowie copied that token? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Little Cowie might not be the Senior her father had spoken of.

In the inner hall, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and others had barely waited long, when they saw a tall middle-aged man with spirited eyes stride in with vigorous steps, with Bei Xiaomei in tow.

This is the Silver Fox Commerce’s President Bei Lengyang? Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.

Fang Xuanxuan had once seen Bei Lengyang, while she had been following her father Fang Gan, thus she recognized Bei Lengyang the moment he entered. His momentum scared her to stand up from her seat, and she quickly greeted respectfully.

Peng Xiao, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others stood up nervously. Whelp, the person who was standing in front of them was the Silver Fox Commerce’s President after all, someone even the Heavenly Emperor had to be courteous to.

Huang Xiaolong also became slightly nervous, influenced by the four women’s reaction.

Among those present, the little cow was the only one who was the most relaxed, as she laid on the floor, cleaning her body, as if a few more licks would make her hair shinier...?

Bei Lengyang’s bright spirited eyes swept over the hall the moment he entered. There was confusion in his eyes when he didn’t find the figure he was looking for until his gaze fell upon the little cow who was ‘cleaning’ herself.

The confusion in his eyes deepened.

“What? Kiddo Yang, haven’t seen you for so long that you can’t even recognize me?” The little cow stopped licking her cow hair, raising her head as she said to Bei Lengyang. She then stood up and released a unique aura from her body.

Upon hearing her words, Bei Lengyang shuddered. His spirited eyes glimmered as he took a step forward, wanting to kneel in salute.

“Let them go out first.” But the little cow cut Bei Lengyang’s words.

Bei Lengyang reacted. He immediately understood that the little cow didn’t want the others in the room to know her true identity. He looked at Elder Fu and ordered, “Escort Xiaomei out with you, and keep watch at the door. Remember, without my order, no one is allowed to come in!” There was an inviolable toughness in his voice.

Elder Fu respectfully complied and firmly pulled an unwilling Bei Xiaomei out of the hall. Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, Li Lu, Yao Chi, Xiang Xun, and the rest tactfully left the hall as well.

In the end, there were only three left in the room—Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Bei Lengyang.

Bei Lengyang looked perplexedly at Huang Xiaolong, and his brows scrunched together, displeased. Just as he was about to rebuke Huang Xiaolong and send him out, the little cow’s voice sounded, “He’s fine here, he’s this cow’s Master in this lifetime!”

Master!

Bei Lengyang’s heart nearly stopped from fright, and his knees almost buckled!

Mommy, Senior Cow’s Master!

Bei Lengyang felt his head swell from disbelief.

“You don’t need to act too restrictive with the kid, just call him how you should.” The little cow went on nonchalantly.

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes at the little cow, then greeted Bei Lengyang politely, “Hello, Uncle Bei, I am Fortune Emperor Palace’s Huang Xiaolong.”

Bei Lengyang blanked for a second, and before he knew it, he had already blurted out, “What? You’re the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Huang Xiaolong?”

He too had heard that a king of supreme godhead disciple had appeared in the Fortune Emperor Palace not long ago, and he had heard it first hand from his daughter Bei Xiaomei’s mouth. At that time, he had thought to have his daughter bring Huang Xiaolong to see him, but who would’ve thought that that disciple would be this black-haired young man! Moreover, he and Senior Cow’s relationship was...!

“Yes, Uncle Bei. I am Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong reaffirmed.

“Kiddo Yang, I haven’t seen you for so many years, you’ve already broken through to Emperor Realm. Time passes so quickly ah! More than five hundred years have passed in the blink of an eye.” The little cow lamented.

“Lengyang could advance to Emperor Realm is all thanks to Senior’s guidance in the past.” Bei Lengyang respectfully responded. He lowered his head, just like a child being admonished by his elder.

Outside the hall, great waves of shock were roiling inside Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others’ hearts. The little cow had called President Bei Lengyang as ‘Kiddo Yang.’ It was simply mind-blowing for them.

In the entire Divine World, who has the guts to call Bei Lengyang ‘Kiddo Yang?’

Fang Xuanxuan couldn’t come up with any name at all.

If that scene from now were to spread out, it would surely send waves of shock through the entire Divine World!
