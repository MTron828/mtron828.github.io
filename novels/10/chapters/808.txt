“Are you thinking about your Master again?” Noticing Shi Xiaofei’s dazed gaze, he teased.

Shi Xiaofei nodded, the picture of gentle obedience. Faint frost flowed from her mouth as she spoke, “Master is very good to me.”

Huang Xiaolong gazed deeply into her eyes, not saying a word. This sudden deep gaze made Shi Xiaofei blush. Lowering her head in shyness, she protested, “Why are you looking at me like that? You’ve already seen me so many times throughout the years, isn’t it enough?”

Huang Xiaolong replied, “Looking at you just like this, a million years, even ten million years, it still won’t be enough.”

Shi Xiaofei’s beautiful, alluring, flawless face belonged to the kind that moved one’s heart. The more a person looked at her, the more it made them want to look at her.

Listening to Huang Xiaolong’s affectionate words, Shi Xiaofei blushed a deep red, sweetness filled her racing heart.

“The Highgod Advancement Tournament is around the corner. When it ends and I breakthrough to Highgod Realm, I’ll give you a big wedding.” Huang Xiaolong inched close to Shi Xiaofei, breathing the words softly into her ear.

Shi Xiaofei looked at him with lucid eyes, giving a low ‘en’ in reply. Before he could say another word, Shi Xiaofei’s arms wrapped around him tightly, her cherry lips pressed against his. Huang Xiaolong was stunned by her rare initiative, lost in the moment.

When he regained his senses and prepared to ‘retaliate,’ Shi Xiaofei released her arms with a brilliant smile on her face, a hint of mischief lurking in her beautiful eyes, “Big brother Huang, both of our names have a ‘Xiao’ in them, do you think it’s fate?”

Huang Xiaolong touched his lips, feeling the lingering the warmth from Shi Xiaofei’s lips. He smiled wryly, answering, “Maybe.”

Shi Xiaofei pursed her lips, clearly disgruntled with Huang Xiaolong’s answer.

A low laugh sounded from Huang Xiaolong, “Later, when we have children, let’s name them Feilong (flying dragon) if it’s a boy, or Longfei if it’s a girl (dragon flying).”

Shi Xiaofei objected with hesitation, “Absolutely not, so ugly.”

Huang Xiaolong gave a hearty laughter.

The pair continued to laugh and joke. Soon, they arrived at Yang Yi’s the land of new moon.

However, Huang Xiaolong and Si Xiaofei were informed by one of Yang Yi’s maids that she wasn’t around, having gone to the White Tiger Galaxy with the Ascending Moon Old Man.

“They went to White Tiger Galaxy?” Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were surprised.

Why did they go to the White Tiger Galaxy?

The maid replied, “Yes, Owner and Senior Ascending Moon heard that the White Tiger Galaxy’s Firmament Divinity Mainland is holding a grand auction, that’s why they rushed over.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Grand auction?” Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei exchanged a glance. It seems there were things the two elders wanted in this grand auction of the Firmament Divinity Mainland. Otherwise, the two elders wouldn’t have gone all the way to the White Tiger Galaxy.

“How long have they been gone?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“About two days.” The maid answered.

Two days? Huang Xiaolong frowned. He tried asking the maid if she knew what the two elders wanted to bid for, but the maid didn’t know.

Shi Xiaofei hesitated. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, she asked, “Big brother Huang, then should we also head to White Tiger Galaxy’s Firmament Divinity Mainland?”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong pondered, then nodded in agreement. They might as well, since he already planned to go to the White Tiger Galaxy’s Devil Domain Mainland to search for the last part of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s body.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong agree, Shi Xiaofei rewarded him with a radiant smile, happily pulling his hand, “Let us leave now.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help smiling at her excitement, letting her pull his hand. Out from the manor, the group of maids watched as Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei left on the phoenix’s back.

Just like before, they both sat on the phoenix while the Dark Hell Tiger followed behind them.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong was curious what items were being auctioned in the Firmament Divinity Mainland’s auction that made even the two elders run all the way there in such a hurry. At this point, there weren’t many things in this lower realm that could rouse the old man’s interest.

While Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were making their way to the White Tiger Galaxy, a piece of news astounded the four galaxies. The Firmament Divinity Mainland was auctioning the godhead a Heavenly God!

Heavenly God’s godhead!

The moment this news spread, the four galaxies’ masters were beyond astonished. At the same time, high level cultivators from almost every world surface flocked to the White Tiger Galaxy.

In the shortest time, White Tiger Galaxy’s Firmament Divinity Mainland became the focal point of the four galaxies’ masters.

When Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei heard the news, they were both dumbfounded. In the four galaxies’ long history, there had only been one Heavenly God master, that person from the Heavenly Mountain!

‘Could it be?!’

While Huang Xiaolong was thinking of this, another piece of news spread that this godhead came from the Heavenly Mountain’s master. What Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect was the news mentioning that this godhead was found by the White Tiger Institute Principal’s personal disciple, Wan Zhenxing, at the Heavenly Mountain itself!

Last time, when the Heavenly God’s blood pool appeared, Wan Zhenxing also entered the Heavenly God Mountain to search for it. He failed to find the blood pool, but he actually found the Heavenly God’s godhead!

However, Huang Xiaolong was slightly disappointed when he heard the following news; the godhead Wan Zhenxing found was incomplete, merely a broken piece of the whole godhead, one-fifth of a whole.

Many other masters also heard the news, yet they continued to rush toward the Firmament Divinity Mainland.

Even though the godhead was only a broken piece, it was still a piece of a Heavenly God’s godhead. If they succeeded in bidding for it, maybe they could research a Heavenly God’s heavenly law. Perhaps they could even comprehend the Heavenly God’s powerful techniques!

Also, wasn’t there news that Wan Zhenxing had broken through to Highgod Realm not long ago? Could this fragment of the godhead have contributed to his breakthrough?

Almost everyone believed without a doubt that Wan Zhenxing was able to advance to the Highgod Realm thanks to that godhead fragment.

On the way, listening to the speculations and rumors, Huang Xiaolong shook his head. If the Highgod Realm was so easy to achieve, wouldn’t there be more of them?

In his opinion, that godhead fragment was the least of all related to Wan Zhenxing’s breakthrough, otherwise the White Tiger Institute Principal wouldn’t agree with auctioning it.

A few decades had passed since the Heavenly God’s blood pool appeared. Huang Xiaolong was sure that the White Tiger Institute had labored over the godhead fragment all this while, but they didn’t have any harvest, which was the main reason why they were taking it out for auction now.

Learning that the auction would be held in three weeks’ time, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei stopped rushing. With the speed of their beast mount and their use of transmission arrays in between, there was ample time for them to reach the Firmament Divinity Mainland.

One the back of the phoenix, beautiful memories were made.

Because the Dark Hell Tiger did not conceal its aura, even though they came across more than a few cultivators going in the same direction, there had been no more troubles.

With accurate timing, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei arrived at the Firmament Divinity Mainland exactly twenty days later.

Being the largest mainland in the White Tiger Galaxy, the Firmament Divinity Mainland was to the White Tiger Galaxy what the Cloudsea Mainland was to Black Tortoise Galaxy, the center of activity. The prosperous and bustling Firmament Divinity Mainland was now crowded with visitors coming for the auction.

Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei travelled to the White Tiger City on the phoenix’s back.
