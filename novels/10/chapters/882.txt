Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Beside the Heavenly God’s godhead, there was also an enormous egg with tiny flickering lightning patterns on its surface.

One could feel the beating pulse from the egg, which caused even the surrounding space to ripple.

This was a lightning beast egg, possessing a top ranked bloodline even in the Divine World!

The spectating cultivators gasped for breath with gleaming desire in their eyes.

After the lightning beast egg, a token inscribed with Divine World symbols appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong. Next to the token was a Divine World cultivation technique manual, glowing with an alluring light.

Next, one hundred sacred grade immortal spirit stones!

One hundred Heavenly God Pills refined by Heavenly Gods!

One hundred All-spirit Divine Fruits!

Before many feverish and greedy gazes coming from the cultivators in the square, Huang Xiaolong collected all of this into his Asura Ring with a wave of his hand.

That Divine World messenger spoke some perfunctory words before sending Huang Xiaolong away. He acknowledged respectfully and flew off the Highgod Advancement Podium back to the Aeon Square below.

Following that, the Divine World messenger had Wangu Yanhui, Zhou Yao, Mu Qi, and the others come up to the podium to receive their rewards. After saying a few words, the Divine World messenger gave the participants ranking from second to ten their rewards, however, the ones ranked after that did not have such a privilege. After the nine disciples’ rewards were distributed, the Divine World messenger indicated they could return to the square.

Soon, all the rewards for the top one thousand were given out.

The space tear in the sky mended itself, and that tall figure disappeared before everyone’s eyes. From the beginning until the end, no one ever saw the messenger’s face.

When things calmed down, the Wangu Clan group of Elders came in front of Huang Xiaolong and other disciples, informing them that the Wangu Clan Patriarch had prepared a celebration banquet, inviting Huang Xiaolong and several others to attend it at the residence of their main branch.

Naturally, most of these disciples readily agreed to attend. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong naturally couldn’t decline, hence he was also among the disciples heading to the Wangu Clan’s banquet. Before that, though, he went to his Master Feng Yang’s side and told them to return to the Surging Waves Mansion and wait for him there.

Feng Yang nodded incessantly, advising Huang Xiaolong to build a good rapport with some Wangu Clan core disciples as well as other galaxies’ disciples, and also reminding him to avoid conflict with others if possible.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, obediently complying while smiling wryly in his heart.

Feng Yang watched Huang Xiaolong leaving with other disciples and Wangu Clan Elders, beaming. His heart was filled with contentment, comfort, astonishment, and a surreal feeling.

Before the tournament, it had never ever crossed his mind that his disciple could win the first place. He could already imagine the great waves of shock spreading over the Black Tortoise, Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird Galaxies when they would receive this news.

“Father, what do we do now?” Yelu Tianhao glared venomously at Huang Xiaolong’s figure leaving with the Wangu Clan Elders.

Yelu Chufei’s eyes gleamed coldly, “Let’s first return to the Saint Lord Galaxy! I don’t believe that Huang Xiaolong can hide here in the Aeon City his entire life! The time they leave the city to return to the Black Tortoise Galaxy is the time they die!”

Yelu Chufei did not linger around the square. With a flick of his sleeve, he led his group away, out of the Aeon City, rushing back to the Saint Lord Galaxy.

While the Yelu Family members were rushing back to the Saint Lord Galaxy, Huang Xiaolong and the other disciples reached the Wangu Clan’s main residence.

At the banquet, Huang Xiaolong’s sitting was arranged at the head of all other disciples, having the same degree of importance as the Wangu Clan Patriarch.

No doubt, Huang Xiaolong had become the center of attention during the banquet, even the brightness of the acclaimed peerless genius of the Wangu Clan in the last ten million years, Wangu Yanhui, dimmed before him.

During the banquet, the Wangu Clan Elders were almost taking turns toasting to Huang Xiaolong. Even the smile on Wangu Yutai’s face, who was the Patriarch, seemed friendly and warm.

This brought many envious gazes from other galaxies’ disciples, without exception. Some had hatred and jealousy laced within, one amongst them was Zhou Yao.

Watching Huang Xiaolong being at the center of attention, Zhou Yao was sneering in his heart, ‘Punk, let’s see how long you can enjoy this, hmph!’

Huang Xiaolong had killed Fang Chu, and he believed the Fortune Gate would soon make their move. He was waiting with anticipation to see how Huang Xiaolong was going to fend off this ancient behemoth.

‘Against the Fortune Gate, being the peerless genius that you are is of no use!’ Between heaven and earth, one’s strength spoke the loudest.

The banquet soon came to an end and everyone left.

Huang Xiaolong and the few other disciples not from the Wangu Clan bid their farewells and left.

However, just as they were stepping out from the Wangu Clan’s main residence, the Tempest Academy’s Jiang Xiaosu suddenly obstructed Huang Xiaolong’s path, demanding to exchange pointers with him.

After a brief surprise, Huang Xiaolong shook his head, ignoring the crazy woman.

Jiang Xiaosu shouted loudly behind Huang Xiaolong: “Are you afraid of losing to me?!”

Huang Xiaolong’s steps halted hearing that. He then glanced at Jiang Xiaosu who shuddered and subconsciously retreated several steps. By the time she stopped, she realized that Huang Xiaolong had already left.

Jiang Xiaosu looked stricken with horror, her cherry red lips opening and closing, “Not possible, how can the gap between us be so big?!”

She had the confidence to fight even Wangu Yanhui. But just now, a single glance from Huang Xiaolong was enough to make her retreat?!

After Huang Xiaolong and the other disciples left the banquet, the Wangu Clan’s Patriarch and Elders moved to the main hall, including Wangu Yanhui.

“Hui’er, in the Overflowing Lightning World, did you have a chance to fight this Huang Xiaolong? How is this child’s strength?” Wangu Yutai asked Wangu Yanhui, who was sitting several seats down in the main hall.

Wangu Yanhui had a somber expression, answering respectfully, “Although this disciple did not fight with Huang Xiaolong, this disciple estimates that Huang Xiaolong probably possesses strength comparable to a Sixth Order Highgod Realm master!”

“What?!”

“A Sixth Order Highgod Realm master’s strength!”

The instant Wangu Yanhui finished, all the present Wangu Clan elders were astounded. Some even blurted out in horror, and even Wangu Yutai showed doubt.

Thus, Wangu Yanhui recounted what happened after they activated the central formation of the Lightning God’s cultivation dwelling, about Fang Chu’s plan of killing all four of them.

When Wangu Yutai and the rest heard that Fang Chu’s cultivation was actually at Fifth Order Highgod Realm, everyone present was once again shocked.

Up until this point, all of them thought that Fang Chu was an early Fourth Order Highgod Realm disciple.

“You’re saying that Huang Xiaolong killed a Fifth Order Highgod Realm Fang Chu with only his Third Order Highgod Realm strength?!” said Wangu Yutai.

But Wangu Yanhui shook his head, “No, at the time Huang Xiaolong killed Fang Chu, he had yet to breakthrough to Third Order. He was still a late-Second Order Highgod Realm.”

“Late-Second Order Highgod Realm!!” Quite a few Wangu Clan Elders present exclaimed the same words, their eyes rounded in astonishment and they jumped to their feet.

“That is so. Although I did not see with my own eyes how Huang Xiaolong killed Fang Chu, at that point in time, Huang Xiaolong was truly a late-Second Order Highgod Realm.” Wangu Yanhui stated, he himself was dumbstruck during that time.

Wangu Yutai muttered under his breath like he was speaking to himself, “A late-Second Order killing a Fifth Order Highgod Realm! Moreover, it wasn’t the average Fifth Order Highgod Realm master either! Monster, a peerless genius, one that doesn’t appear in tens of millions of years ah!”

Wangu Shuo and Wangu Changqing exchanged a look, their wry smile reflected in each other’s eyes. Despite having praised Huang Xiaolong’s talent before, only now did they realize the fact that they still underestimated Huang Xiaolong.

“Hmph, this Fang Chu dared to harm Yanhui while knowing his identity full well. This matter cannot be forgiven just like this!” A long time later, Wangu Zhi recovered from his shock, harrumphing in anger.

The Elders echoed his sentiments.

A light flickered passed Wangu Yutai’s eyes, “Naturally this matter won’t be forgotten so easily, however, that Huang Xiaolong...”
