Chapter 2691: Come at Me!

As Huang Xiaolong’s arm turned a little transparent, it seemed to transform into Immemorial Xuanhuang Jade as he became immune to all sorts of poison.

Bang!

A blast rang through the skies and Huang Xiaolong’s arm finally came into contact with the pagoda. The moment it did, the Magic Pagoda trembled for a moment as it tried to pour in all its poison into Huang Xiaolong’s body. However, the poison scattered when it came in contact with his arm.

Piercing through the Divination Poison, Huang Xiaolong grabbed the Magic Pagoda.

Trembling slightly, the pagoda failed to budge in Huang Xiaolong’s grasp.

“What?!” Elder Ming wasn’t the only one who exclaimed in shock. Yuan Qianxing and the others couldn’t believe their eyes.

How was he able to withstand the Divination Poison?!

Even without mentioning the poison surrounding the pagoda, it was a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact! With Elder Ming’s constant refinement, it was a terrifying existence to say the least! Even Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestors wouldn’t dare to grab the pagoda casually! Their dao physiques would probably crumble before they could get close to it! However, Huang Xiaolong managed to grab it with his hands!

The defense of the pagoda couldn’t even scratch him!

Wouldn’t that mean…?

At the peak of the late-Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong’s body was comparable to the dao physique of a Primal Ancestor at the Fifth Resurrection Realm or higher! If he entered the high-level True Saint Realm, wouldn’t that make him indestructible?!

“Grand dao physique!” Elder Ming stared at Huang Xiaolong and yelled in shock.

He clearly had a grand dao physique! Moreover, it was a physique more perfect than any Primal Ancestor he had ever seen in his life! Huang Xiaolong’s grand dao art was stronger than anything he had ever experienced, and it was as though he was the incarnation of the grand dao himself!

Yuan Qianxing and the others couldn’t hold back their shock. After Elder Ming pointed it out, the fog before their eyes cleared.

“Grand dao physique!”

Not a single person managed to remain calm.

Yuan Qianxing’s expression sank. Up until now, he used to think that he was the most talented disciple in the Alien Lands when he had obtained his Dao Heart in the True Saint Realm. However, some brat called Huang Xiaolong had appeared out of nowhere to challenge his position as the most talented disciple in the later generations! Huang Xiaolong had even managed to obtain the Inextinguishable Dao Heart in a cultivation realm lower than his own!

He had suffered quite a huge blow when he made the discovery.

As someone who was hailed as the incarnation of the origin, he was less talented than a mere human!

Now, the other party had managed to form a grand dao physique to one up him!

He hadn’t even touched the border of forming his grand dao physique, but the other party was already done with it!

Humiliation and hatred filled his heart.

All of a sudden, he felt as though the heavens had given up on him. As the incarnation of the origin itself, he was the proudest son of heavens! How could a human shine brighter than him?!

Yuan Qianxing wasn’t the only one feeling humiliated. Yuan Wanfei and the others felt the same way.

Yuan Wanfei and the others had managed to rise to prominence when they had entered the Primal Ancestor Realm, and they were hailed as geniuses of their generations! However, their talent was less than dog sh*t when compared to Huang Xiaolong!

Flexing all the muscles in his arm, Huang Xiaolong ruthlessly swung the pagoda towards the ground. With unstoppable momentum, it went crashing down.

Elder Ming, who was controlling the pagoda with his body, nearly fell together with it.

His expression finally changed.

“Attack!” Elder Ming yelled as he turned to Yuan Qianxing and the others who were standing at the side.

However, his order was met with stunned silence. Not a single person reacted in time as no one had expected Elder Ming to request for assistance when dealing with Huang Xiaolong!

“What are you waiting for?!” Elder Ming’s roar reverberated through the hall and rang in their ears, pulling them out of their confusion.

Finally returning to their senses, Yuan Qianxing and the others attacked.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With the two members of the Myriad Origin Race unleashing the ‘Return to the Origin’, the power contained in the grand dao law increased yet again. Yuan Qianxing didn’t hold back as he summoned his Origin Saint Godhead before activating the power of the origin. Grand dao energy poured down from the void.

Compared to the time he had unleashed the skill previously, it was several times stronger!

As the Origin Saint Godhead had become stronger together with him, it had become a frightening existence compared to before.

Chan Yuli and Yao Chengxin threw their concerns to the back of their mind as they used everything they had to take Huang Xiaolong down.

All of them knew that if they failed to take Huang Xiaolong down, it would be their end. With Huang Xiaolong’s personality, there was no way he would let them off! Moreover, their races would be exterminated when they lost. The destruction of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race was the best example of what could happen to those who tried to kill Huang Xiaolong.

When they thought of Mo Jincheng’s horrifying end, their heart trembled.

From the moment Huang Xiaolong had entered the hall with Long Jianfei, they were sure that Long Jianfei was the reason the Devil Eye Race was exterminated. From what they saw now, that didn’t seem to be the case.

As for Jiang Heng, Teng Xiao, and the others, they hesitated for a moment when they saw Yuan Qianxing and the others making their move. They were planning to suck up to the Myriad Origin Race and Elder Ming previously, but it seemed as though Huang Xiaolong was not a powerless ant.

Since they didn’t have some sort of death grudge with the kid, they didn’t feel the need to join in the assault.

However, Elder Ming roared at them when he noticed that they were remaining in their place. “Jiang Heng, if you guys refuse to do anything, you can’t blame me for being ruthless after I deal with Huang Xiaolong!”

His threat caused their expressions to sink.

No one could ignore Elder Ming’s threats.

Even if Huang Xiaolong won the battle, there was a possibility that Elder Ming could escape. If he held the grudge and looked for them in the future, they would be in deep sh*t!

After a short moment of consideration, the Primal Ancestors in the hall decided to move against Huang Xiaolong. After all, they were more afraid of Elder Ming whose reputation was formed from his hellish treatment of his victims.

After seeing how everyone was about to make their move, Huang Xiaolong sneered as he summoned his three dao souls and the twelve high-order Saint Fates.

“Dao soul?!” The Primal Ancestors who wanted to attack Huang Xiaolong together, were stunned by his revelation.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t just form his grand dao physique! He even managed to transform his holy souls into dao souls! All three of them!

With the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, grand dao physique, and dao souls, Huang Xiaolong was basically a Primal Ancestor-level existence!

However, his cultivation realm was only in the late-Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm!

Long Jianfei looked at Huang Xiaolong with a burning gaze from a distance. That was their young lord! He was the son of the God of Creation with the Huang Long Bloodline flowing in his veins!

Boom!

After sending his punches out at his opponents, everything in his path crumbled. Nothing could resist the power of the grand dao as everything that stood in his way returned back to nothingness. This was the real meaning of returning to the origin, and it was at a level higher than Yuan Qianxing’s grand dao art!

Like salt dissolving in the sea, the ‘Return to the Origin’ unleashed by Yuan Qianxing and Yuan Wanfei scattered in the face of Huang Xiaolong’s attack!
