Chapter 3724: White Feather King, Who Would Have Thought

Ordinarily, the Radiant God Staff was more than capable of suppressing the Ghost Staff. However, everything was as the Golden Cymbals King said when he attacked Huang Xiaolong for the first time. No matter how strong one’s universe treasures were, it depended on the user! Huang Xiaolong was more than capable of suppressing the White Feather King alone, and the Ghost Staff was countless times more powerful in his hands!

Once again, the White Feather King was forced to retreat.

He felt his arms going numb as rage filled his mind.

“White Feather King, who would have thought that you would be in such a sorry state…” The White Deer mocked from the side.

It was more than happy to see the White Feather King being suppressed by Huang Xiaolong. The only thing that would make it happier was if Huang Xiaolong killed the White Feather King!

Glaring at the White Deer in anger, the White Feather King aimed his Ghost Spike at the creature before stabbing straight at it. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi arrived the moment he made his move. He barely managed to dodge the wave of sword qi directed at him, but his hair wasn’t as lucky. A huge chunk of his hair was sliced away by Huang Xiaolong.

When he got to his feet, he realized that there was a giant bald patch on his head.

The White Deer laughed happily. “White Feather King, you should change your name to the Featherless King!”

“Huang Xiaolong, you forced me to do this!” The White Feather King roared as a pair of white wings appeared behind him.

His body started to expand as white feathers formed several layers over his skin.

The feathers that covered him were no ordinary feathers. Every single one of them contained an extremely concentrated radiant energy and white flame surrounded them.

It was a flame created after the power of radiance reached a certain level.

A sea of white flames surrounded the White Feather King and it covered an area of several hundred million miles.

The White Deer’s expression turned solemn when it noticed the power the White Feather King emitted. Like the White Feather King, it was able to control the power of radiance. It knew how terrifying the sea of flames was.

Yang Dingsheng escaped a long time ago. Even though his strength was comparable to the Limitless Master, he would turn to ash if he came into contact with the flames.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless as he faced the White Feather King who had gone all out. He activated all three great worlds in him as he circulated the Universe Transformation Art.

The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand.

“Huang Xiaolong, eat my radiant flame!” The White Feather King swung his Radiant God Staff once again as the sea of flames funneled towards Huang Xiaolong.

A sneer left his lips as the Universe Origin Fires turned into a sea of flames that revolved around his body. The two blazing oceans crashed into each other. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s halberd went straight for the White Feather King’s chest. As the Three Gods Halberd swept outwards, the Black Source Ice that was behind him started to move.

Layers upon layers of Black Source Ice formed a massive world that slammed into the White Feather King.

Boom!

When the two fiery oceans crashed into each other, a heaven-shaking explosion rang through the air.

The Black Source Ice continued on its way towards the White Feather King.

The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng could see that the White Feather King’s sea of radiant flames was completely suppressed after that one exchange.

Huang Xiaolong might not be able to destroy the sea of radiant flames with his strike with the Three Gods Halberd alone, but the Universe Origin Fires were the source of all fire in the universes! It suppressed the radiant flames and the Black Source Ice that came along with the halberd strike was more than enough to overwhelm the White Feather King!

No one could deny the frightening power the Black Source Ice possessed! Not even the White Deer could melt the layers of ice to get the Universe Source Stone after countless years!

Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air once again and the Golden Sun Circlets appeared. It turned into a streak of light that flew straight towards the White Feather King.

“Golden Sun Circlet?!” The White Feather King gasped as he twisted his body unnaturally. If he had moved a second later, he would have been struck in the chest. Even so, the circlet smashed straight into his right arm.

The white feathers might possess the strongest defense in the Thirteen Universes, but the Golden Sun Circlet was a universe treasure! A huge chunk of feathers fell from his body.

Sounds of shattering bones could be heard.

He was enraged as anger clouded his mind. He hadn’t been injured in countless years! That was the first time he had suffered an injury, and it was at the hands of a mere human!

“Huang-Xiao-Long!” His eyes turned completely red, and he gnashed his teeth together.

The Radiant God Staff soared into the void above as endless radiance energy poured down towards them. As he absorbed the power of radiance, his injuries healed instantly.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. After all, the White Feather King was basically an existence similar to the White Deer. They could cure every single injury instantly.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care too much as the Yin Yang Flame Wheels appeared under his feet. He appeared before the White Feather King as the Reversal Sword chopped downwards.

As the sword slashed downwards, space and time reversed as the world seemed to return to its origin.

In a desperate attempt to defend himself, the White Feather King raised the Radiant God Staff once again. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s sword was faster, and it went deep into his chest.

More than an hour passed…

Their battle lasted all the way, and the White Feather King had no idea how many injuries he sustained. Luckily for him, he was able to recover almost immediately after he was struck.

Other people might not be able to tell, but Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer both knew that the White Feather King’s recovery speed was starting to slow down.

Even though it looked to be the same, it was unmistakably slower than it once was.

The White Feather King’s ability to control the power of radiance was unparalleled, but his strength was starting to decline after such a terrifying battle.

Since the White Deer and Huang Xiaolong could tell, the White Feather King was naturally able to notice the condition of his body. He knew that if the battle carried on, it would be a matter of time before he lost.

Stopping suddenly, the White Feather King glared at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, you made a wrong choice to oppose my Universe First Race! You’ll die a horrible death!”

“I should be the one saying that. Your Universe First Race will regret standing against me.”

Killing intent burst out from the White Feather King’s eyes. “You can gloat for now, but Lord Black Nether will be out from seclusion before long. When he enters the Universe God Realm, everyone related to you will die!”

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Without the Universe Source Stone, do you really think that he can break through to the Universe God Realm?”

The White Feather King felt the words getting stuck in his throat like a bone.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, he soon snorted, “Even if Lord Black Nether doesn’t break through, he can still kill you with a wave of his hand! He’ll break through even without the Universe Source Stone! Do you really think that you can stop our plans by snatching away a mere rock?!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered in response, “Without the Universe Source Stone, the Black Nether King will only be able to break through in several billion years. When that happens, I would have long since entered the Universe God Realm! If you choose to submit to me now, I’ll spare your life when the time comes!”
