Chapter 2530: Key to the Seventh Floor!

Instead of killing the beasts guarding the herbs, Huang Xiaolong tried to subdue those he could. Only if the beasts were too stubborn, Huang Xiaolong killed them to imprison their holy souls.

It wouldn’t be too late for him to refine the holy souls after leaving the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

Two days passed in a flash.

More than twenty holy herbs appeared in the space in the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

Even someone with Huang Xiaolong’s wealth couldn’t help but rejoice in his heart.

The Cangqiong Old Man was really willing to part with his treasures. He even allowed experts of the younger generation to pick them freely.

Of course, how was he supposed to know that an ordinary disciple wouldn’t be able to act as wantonly as him when they entered the sixth floor?! With their holy souls, they wouldn’t be able to locate the holy herbs!

There wasn’t even a chance for some of them to defeat the beasts guarding the more valuable herbs!

None of the beasts guarding the herbs were weak. One could even say that they were existences who could stomp on cultivators with the same floor. Well, it wasn’t their day as they ran into an abnormal existence like Huang Xiaolong.

As if it wasn’t enough for him to possess three holy souls, he even had a Dao Heart! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

None of the beasts managed to withstand several blows from Huang Xiaolong.

According to the Cangqiong Old Man’s plan, the disciples who could enter the sixth floor would have to join hands to fight off a strong guardian beast in order to obtain a single herb. No matter how hard they tried, they wouldn’t be able to obtain more than a stalk each.

… Obviously, his plan was flawed.&nbsp;

Three days passed, and the number of holy herbs in Huang Xiaolong’s storage increased to forty!

Moreover, he managed to find three high-level holy martial art and two high-level holy secret art.

Out of the five, there was one that came from the Cangqiong Old Man before he had broken through to the Primal Ancestor Realm. As for the others, the old man had probably obtained them from other experts.

Even though Huang Xiaolong managed to harvest huge gains in the sixth floor, he was still a little disappointed.

He hadn’t even sensed the existence of the key to the seventh floor!

According to his estimations, Tan Juan, Li Chen, and Xie Bufan would arrive at the sixth floor in several days!

Even with his Inextinguishable Dao Heart, he knew that they wouldn’t be too far behind with the assistance of dao artifacts.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid even if the three of them joined hands against him. He was only afraid that they would step into dog-sh*t luck and find the key before him!

If that really happened, Huang Xiaolong would have to kill himself in regret.

If people like Li Chen or Xie Bufan accepted the inheritance, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to do a thing even if he killed them! After all, there was only a single inheritance!

One day later, the sixth floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor emitted rays of brilliant light once again.

Someone else finally arrived on the sixth floor.

“Who can it be?!” Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

“Could it be Tan Juan? What if Xie Bufan arrived first?”

Regardless, their appearance wasn’t good news to Huang Xiaolong.

After soaring into the skies, Huang Xiaolong tried even harder to locate the key.

However, Huang Xiaolong forgot about someone extremely important! The person who had entered the sixth floor after Huang Xiaolong wasn’t Tan Juan or Xie Bufan. Instead, it was Li Chen who had the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring!

Even though Tan Juan and Xie Bufan had Primal Ancestor Dao Artifacts bestowed on them by their respective factions, the artifacts ultimately belonged to others! They were unable to unleash their full strength!

That wasn’t the case for Li Chen. The Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring belonged to him, and he had spent all of his time refining the weapon. By now, he had an initial grasp on how to use the ring!

He had also received a part of the All Extinguishing Holy Emperor’s inheritance!

“KEY!”

“I have to find the key!”

A determined light flashed in Li Chen’s eyes the moment he stepped onto the sixth floor. Upon touching the space between his eyebrows, a strange strength started to gather.

As a mysterious light emerged, a complicated rune appeared.

After taking a spot between his eyebrows, the rune looked like a third eye and it seemed to be able to see through everything.

With the portion of the inheritance he had obtained from the All Extinguishing Holy Emperor, he had managed to obtain a skill called the All Extinguishing Heavenly Eye. With it, he could see through the void, and he felt that it would be easier for him to locate the key compared to a blind search.

After soaring through the skies, he started to look for the key.

Half a day later…

Another burst of light emerged from the sixth floor.

The third person finally arrived.

Xie Bufan’s figure quickly charged through the skies, but he was quickly followed by a fourth participant. Tan Juan had also arrived.

Soon after the two of them arrived on the sixth floor, Li Chen stared at a weird rock at the bottom of a mountain with a look of joy on his face.

Even though it looked extremely ordinary, Li Chen slapped it once and felt an overwhelming backlash coming from the piece.

Instead of getting angry, Li Chen became even happier as he unleashed his attacks on the rock.

After half an hour, cracks finally started to show. Several minutes passed and the rock finally exploded.

As soon as it did, golden light pierced through the skies and a golden-jade-like key emerged.

‘Cangqiong’! That was the only word carved onto the key.

“The key to the seventh floor!”

Wild joy swept through Li Chen’s heart, and he roared with laughter. “It’s the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance! I’m the one who gets to lay my hands on it!” He reached out to grab the key, but a terrifying surge of energy slashed at him before he could retrieve the key. After feeling the power contained in the strike, Li Chen didn’t bother about the key as he pushed his body to the limit to dodge.

When he turned around to look at the person who had attacked him, he couldn’t help but sneer. “Huang Xiaolong!”

Previously, he was afraid that the person who had arrived was Tan Juan or Xie Bufan. As long as it wasn’t them, he was confident of dealing with his attacker.

“Who would have thought that you would arrive on the sixth floor?!” Li Chen snorted. “Whatever. It’s good that you’re here. I was thinking that I missed my chance to kill you. Now that you’re here, I’ll kill you before receiving the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the key before chuckling, “What a coincidence. I’m thinking of doing the same thing.”
