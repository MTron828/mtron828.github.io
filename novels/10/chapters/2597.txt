Chapter 2598: The Proper Way to Treat Guests

By the time Huang Xiaolong made his way into the main hall, the patriarchs of the powers in the surrounding regions had filled the place to the brim.

“Is that him?! I wonder, what made Lord Zi Dongping accept him as a foster son…?!” One of the patriarchs frowned.

“He’s just a f*cking human! How talented can he be? The number of humans who possess godheads ranked in the top hundred can probably be counted on both hands!” Another patriarch jeered loudly, “If that b*stard has a godhead ranking in the hundreds, he should be thanking the lords!”

“Yeah! I wonder what kind of sh*t he stepped in for him to arrive in the Second Heaven True Saint Realm.”

In the main hall, the patriarchs who appeared were all extremely famous individuals. Even those at the lowest tier were at the level of the Mysterious Ice Patriarch. All of them were extremely talented, and they looked at Huang Xiaolong with a trace of contempt.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong entered the hall, Zi Dongping and the various experts of the Purple Spider Race entered the hall behind him. The attitudes of all the patriarchs stopped immediately.

Just as the ceremony was about to begin, a shout resounded through the air. “Stop right there!”

Everyone stared at the entrance with a stunned expression as a group of people charged into the hall.&nbsp;

“It’s Lord Jin Fei of the Golden Violation Domain! He’s from the Golden Buddha Race!” Someone recognized the person in the lead and yelled.

The hall erupted instantly.

Everyone present knew about the grudges the Golden Buddha Race had with the Purple Spider Race.

Now that Jin Fei had arrived, things were about to get interesting.

“Jin Fei, the Domain of the Golden Violation Domain, and a disciple of the Golden Buddha Race greets Lord Zi Dongping.” Jin Fei bowed ‘respectfully’ when facing Zi Dongping.

“Did the old fart send you over? What do you want?” Zi Dongping growled, “You interrupted my ceremony as soon as it started. If you don’t satisfy me with your reply, don’t blame me for breaking your legs and throwing you out of my hall!”

Even though Jin Fei was a Domain Lord, he was someone from the Golden Buddha Race. Hence he was no different from a piece of sh*t.

The experts in the hall stared at each other silently.

The expression on Jin Fei’s face sank, but he quickly recovered. “My ancestor sent me over with gifts when he heard that you were accepting a foster son!” He brought out his gifts in front of everyone.

Glancing at the stuff from the Golden Buddha Race, Zi Dongping waited for Jin Fei to continue.

“Lord Zi Dongping would definitely not accept someone with no talent as your foster son. Since all of us are from the later generation, a disciple of my race, Jin Yue, wants to challenge your disciple! Jin Yue’s talent is pretty average, and I wonder if Lord Zi Dongping would allow the competition to happen?”

Jin Fei was obviously trying to goad Zi Dongping into allowing the fight.

After saying everything about how Jin Yue had average talent, if Zi Dongping didn’t accept the challenge, he would become a laughing stock in front of everyone!

Of course, if Zi Dongping accepted the battle, Jin Yue would use all his power to cripple Huang Xiaolong. They would definitely shatter Huang Xiaolong’s meridians and destroy his physical body! They would slap Zi Dongping in the face, and he wouldn’t be able to accept Huang Xiaolong as his foster son any longer! That was the Golden Buddha Race’s true goal!

For someone with Jin Yue’s talent, Jin Fei was extremely sure that he wouldn’t lose to anyone from the same generation! He was one of the most talented cultivators in the junior generation, and his saint godhead ranked in the top thirty!

Jin Fei was supposed to warn Zi Dongping during the ceremony, but after a suggestion from Jin Fei himself, the patriarch had allowed them to send Jin Yue over to cripple the human’s cultivation!

Chan Yuli had clapped happily when he had heard the suggestion and allowed Jin Fei to do as he wished.

A chilly light flashed in Zi Dongping’s eyes when he heard the challenge. How could someone at his level be unaware of what those from the Golden Buddha Race wished to do? However, Huang Xiaolong accepted the challenge before anyone could stop him. “Sure!”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Joy filled Jin Fei’s heart. However, he hid it really well, and he praised Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang Xiaolong’s courage is praiseworthy!” As if he was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would back out of the challenge, he immediately introduced Jin Yue. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sneer in his heart when he noticed how happy Jin Fei was.

“Brother Huang, you’re the star of the show here. As the guest, I should allow you to make the first move,” Jin Yue snickered.

“Since that’s the case, I won’t be polite.” A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and his figure blurred. He appeared in front of Jin Yue in an instant as a punch was sent straight into his face.

“Bang!”

Before Jin Yue, or anyone for that matter, could react, Huang Xiaolong’s fist had already completed its job. Jin Yue’s head was like a watermelon and Huang Xiaolong’s fist was the sledgehammer that smashed it into pieces. Blood sprayed through the hall.

As a golden ray of light tried to escape, Huang Xiaolong reached out casually and threw it into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong as their eyes went wide after witnessing the scene before them.

The smile on Jin Fei’s face froze, and an expression of disbelief slowly took its place.

It ended with a single move!

Everyone couldn’t believe their eyes!

It was especially so for those who knew of Jin Yue’s actual talent and combat abilities!

“You…!” Jin Fei glared at Huang Xiaolong. However, he didn’t know what to say.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong asked, ‘It’s true that your disciple is barely better than average. So is Domain Lord looking down on me to send such a weakling out to battle?”

Sending out a weakling to battle?!&nbsp;Jin Fei nearly vomited blood when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“If Domain Lord Jin Fei really wants to send someone to spar with me, please send someone stronger,” Huang Xiaolong added another sentence as though whatever he said before wasn’t insulting enough.

Jin Fei was speechless, and his expression was worse than Hei Luo’s.

One of the experts behind Jin Fei could no longer hold it in, and he screamed, “You destroyed the body of one of our elders! How dare you capture his holy soul?! You had better give us a proper explanation for this!”

“Elder? How can someone with such lousy talent be an elder of a race? Whatever. What do you have to trade for him? Am I supposed to look for another useless cultivator to make up for it?”

The experts behind Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter and so did everyone in the hall.

The person from the Golden Buddha Race, who spoke previously, pointed at Huang Xiaolong and screamed in rage, “You’re just a mere human! Who the f*ck do you think you are? Not killing you right here and now is enough compensation for you to hand him over!”

As soon as he was done, Hei Luo smashed his head with a single punch.

Jin Fei and the others widened their eyes as fear crept up their hearts.

The expert was a Seventh Heaven True Saint! He was also one of the vice hall masters of the Golden Buddha Race!

“Lord Zi Dongping, what’s the meaning of this?!” Jin Fei was enraged, and he snapped at Zi Dongping, “Is this the way you treat your guests?”
