Chapter 3671 – Scram

Nether Yang King!

The three words seemed to contain a terrifying power and the riverbank fell into silence. They stared at the incoming flying ship in a respectful silence.

Those who were fighting over a spot on the ships returned to the riverbank. Those who returned included those who had already obtained a position on their ships.

That was how scary the name of the Nether Yang King was!

Initially, the combination of the three ghost kings was enough to terrify thought around them. However, the appearance of the Nether Yang King eclipsed them instantly.

The Heavenly Blood Ghost King, Green Winged Ghost King, and the Evil Dragon Ghost King were considered supreme existences who controlled millions of cities. However, they were mere side characters in the face of the Nether Yang King.

He was the true boss level figure in the Green Ghost Lands!

A massive ship drifted over from afar, and the body of the flying ship burned a bright red. A group of experts stood at the bow of the ship. There weren't too many of them and the person who stood at the front was a young man clad in crimson and black robes.

Nether Yang King!

He didn’t exude the slightest bit of qi around him. Even so, his presence overshadowed those around him. No matter if they were experts from the Yin Ghost Race, Human Race, or the Ghost Beasts, they got to their knees as soon as the Nether Yang King arrived. Even Jiang Dacheng fell to his knees.

When the flying ship stopped, the group of experts disembarked. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Nether Yang King took the lead and walked towards the riverbank.

When he saw one figure standing tall on the riverbank facing away from him, he stopped in his tracks and a frown formed on his face.

“Master, do you want me to…” A middle-aged man appeared from behind the Nether Yang King and spoke. He wanted to ask if he should kill Huang Xiaolong for the disrespect he was showing.

The Nether Yang King looked at Huang Xiaolong suspiciously, and he shook his head. “It’s fine. There’s no need for that right now.”

At that moment, three more flying ships tore through the air.

“Lord Wu Zun!”

“Senior Bing Yu!”

“Lord Jiu Yu!”

Wu Zun came alone, but there was a huge group of experts behind Bing Yu and Jiu Yu. There were hundreds of them in each group!”

When they saw that the Nether Yang King had already arrived, the three of them bowed respectfully.

The Nether Yang King didn’t put on airs when facing the three of them. He cupped his fists and smiled, “Looks like all of you heard the news!”

Bing Yu was the master in name of the Yin Reversal Ghost King. He existed since the start of the universe, and he was the Nether Yang King’s senior!

Bing Yu laughed, “Lord Nether Yang King possesses overwhelming strength. Even if we heard the news, we won’t be able to fight you for it!”

Laughter rang through the air.

The three of them noticed Huang Xiaolong in succession.

“Who is that?” Bing Yu frowned.

The Nether Yang King shook his head in response.

“The brat is pretty gutsy…” Wu Zun chuckled.

“More like he’s ignorant.” Bing Yu mocked. Turning to one of the female attendants behind him, he yelled, “Throw him into the river.”

The female expert he spoke to was a God of Creation at the small completion stage. With a respectful bow, she started to walk towards Huang Xiaolong. However, a burst of light filled the air as a massive ship appeared on the river.

All the black ships were pushed to the side with its appearance.

Staring at the change, the cultivators along the riverbank gasped in fright. The giant ship was black and gold in color, and the aura it emitted was overwhelming!

“Supreme Ghost King Ship!” The Nether Yang King and the others yelled in shock.

“Nether Yang King, please.” Senior Bing Yu gestured.

However, the Nether Yang King replied respectfully, “Senior Bing Yu, you should take the lead…”

Bing Yu hesitated for a second and looked at the other two.

“We don’t mind…” Wu Zun and Jiu Yu smiled.

“Alright. I shall take the lead and start the ball rolling then!” Bing Yu cupped his fists towards the other three before soaring into the air.

Before he could arrive, Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air. “Let’s go! Our ride is here.”

A stream of energy wrapped around Jiang Dacheng and brought him towards the Supreme Ghost King Ship.

Those who were looking at him gasped in fright. No one would think that an unknown expert would dare to fight for a spot on the Supreme Ghost King Ship without the Nether Yang King’s approval!

Naturally, the Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu were equally as shocked.

Jiu Yu shook his head and smiled, “This brat… He’s in trouble now.”

Bing Yu wasn’t just their senior. He was a supreme expert who had 16 billion units of combat strength!

Wu Zun chuckled in amusement, “Even I have to show Senior Bing Yu some respect when he goes all out. Hehe, his temper isn’t the best! That brat must be crazy to challenge him!”

Indeed. Bing Yu’s expression turned gloomy and killing intent filled his eyes the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong flying towards the ship.

“Get him to f*ck off!” Bing Yu didn’t take action personally. Instead, he ordered a God of Creation at the grand completion stage beside him.

A slap flew towards Huang Xiaolong, attempting to send him falling into the water.

A stream of starlight emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and returned the favor. He sent the God of Creation falling into the water below.

They failed to react in time as the God of Creation released wretched cries of help.

When those around them finally realized what had happened, Huang Xiaolong arrived on the Supreme Ghost King Ship.

Bing Yu and the experts behind him boarded half a second later.

Staring at his subordinate who fell into the water, Bing Yu growled at Huang Xiaolong, “You’ll die a horrible death!”

“Scram. If you leave the ship now, I’ll let you live. Otherwise, none of you will be walking away. No one can save you…” Huang Xiaolong’s words and actions had long since caused Jiang Dacheng to fall to the ground in fright.

Bing Yu chuckled as anger filled his heart. “No one can save me?” He released his aura completely and white colored qi icy qi filled the space above the ship. A punch flew towards Huang Xiaolong suddenly.

The space around his fist froze as it soared towards Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Without batting an eyelid, Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand. The moment he did, the Nether Yang King and the others felt as though the river of time had reversed. The universe around them flipped upside down!
