Chapter 2590: It’s Time!

You Shiheng wasn’t alone. The vice domain lord, Chen Bo, was also leading the various experts of the Dissociation Domain over. Practically, everyone in the Dissociation Domain was mobilized.

With more than three hundred Holy Grounds in the Dissociation Domain, more than two hundred holy emperors had answered the call! Adding on the power of the domain lord himself, more than three hundred Fourth Heaven True Saints charged towards the Hong Zhen Holy Gate!

More than half of the power from the Dissociation Domain was gathered.

Also, there was a pair of middle-aged men who stood beside You Shiheng. They looked exactly the same, and the aura they released suppressed the late-Seventh Heaven True Saint.

There was no doubt that they were in the Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm or higher!

“Brother Xu Wen, Brother Xu Hai, you might need to make a move when the time comes…” You Shiheng addressed them respectfully.

“Domain Lord You is being too humble. The two of us received so much help from you that we’re happy to be of use!” Xu Wen chuckled. However, a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes. “For a human to act so unbridled in the Alien Lands, he’s asking to die! It’s our duty to beat some sense into him!”

Xu Hai nodded in agreement. “That’s right. Domain Lord, please be at ease. We will not hold anything back when dealing with the human! However, I am very curious as to how Li Yapeng died…”

You Shiheng knew about their concerns, and he quickly reassured them, “There is no way for a human to be a Primal Ancestor. I already investigated him thoroughly. That human is only a Second Heaven True Saint, and the bodyguard around him doesn’t even seem to be a True Saint. For him to be able to kill Li Yaping, he should have a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact on him!”

“Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact!” Xu Wen and Xu Hai were shocked.

“That’s right. He probably used the grand dao law sealed in the dao artifact to kill Li Yapeng!” You Shiheng continued, “You should know that there hasn’t been a single Primal Ancestor from the human race who entered my Dissociation Domain.”

The Xu Brothers nodded slowly.

Due to the suppression from the Alien Lands, those from the human race weren’t able to produce a single Primal Ancestor. In fact, there hadn’t even been a Ninth Heaven True Saint!

“Could he be a human from the Holy World?” Chen Bo asked all of a sudden.

You Shiheng and Xu Wen stared at each other in shock.

“That’s impossible!” Xu Wen returned to his senses as a smile formed on his face. “There are only so many Primal Ancestors in the Holy World. I’ve seen the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Qiao Jinyang, and others during the war in the past. There’s no way for the kid to be a Primal Ancestor. After all, it has been several million years since the appearance of a new Primal Ancestor in the Holy World.”

“What if the brat really has a dao artifact?” You Shiheng couldn’t help but ask.

“Domain Lord can relax. The dao artifact will belong to you if we kill him. However, we’ll take everything else!” Xu Wen looked at Xu Hai, and he stated his terms.

A brilliant smile appeared on You Shiheng’s face. “Nice! Hand the brat over to us after you deal with him. You can play with the black ghost guard around him as you see fit.”

“Alright!” The two of them agreed instantly.

Several days passed.

As the giant army made its way over to the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds, they alerted many holy grounds along the way. The only time the grand army of the Dissociation Domain would be mobilized would be when they met with something that could threaten the position of the Domain Lord!

“This… It seems like the last time the army gathered was several hundred thousand years ago… What’s going on? Did something happen for the Domain Lord to gather the troops?” Several Venerable Realm patriarchs yelled in shock.

“Half a year ago, an honorary Eminent Elder of the Mysterious Ice Race humiliated Princess Qing Ying. He killed Teng Baining of the Soaring Serpent Race while he was at it. Recently, he killed Li Yapeng during the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s apprenticeship ceremony!”

“Qing Xuan, Xiao Shan, and Lin Cong lost contact with Lord You!”

“What?! Lord Li Yapeng died? Did the human kill him? Would it be possible for that human to be a Primal Ancestor?”

“B*llsh*t! There hasn’t been a human Primal Ancestor in our Alien Lands since a long time! The person who killed Lord Li Yapeng might have a dao artifact…”

“Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact! No wonder Domain Lord mobilized the army…”

The entire Dissociation Domain shook as the army made its way towards the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

From what they noticed, You Shiheng had already sealed the Dissociation Domain, and not a single living being could escape.

Of course, the activities that You Shiheng ordered couldn’t be hidden from Huang Xiaolong. However, he didn’t care. He knew the reason the Dissociation Domain was locked down, and it was to prevent him from escaping.

After making his estimation, he felt that it would take the army two to three months to make its way to the Hong Zhen Holy Gate. In the time it took them to travel over, he was extremely confident of taking Zi Dongping down.

The only thing he had to do now was to strengthen the Cangqiong World he had created around the holy gate.

Two months passed before Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo stopped.

“It’s time!” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on the forbidden domain in the depths of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

It took Huang Xiaolong half an hour to arrive in the forbidden domain. With no one other than Hei Luo beside him, Huang Xiaolong got ready to battle. In a battle between Primal Ancestors, any number of True Saints was useless. Even late-Ninth Heaven True Saints wouldn’t be able to last for a second before dying. As such, he didn’t bother bringing the members of the Purple Spider Race over. Neither did he allow the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm undead spirits to take part in the battle.

Very quickly, they arrived in the space above the forbidden domain. Pushing his three holy souls to the limit, Huang Xiaolong located Zi Dongping.

After a slight hesitation, Huang Xiaolong’s body flashed, and he arrived several dozen thousand feet under the land with Hei Luo. With a single punch, he tore through the space barrier around Zi Dongping.

The instant he destroyed the barrier, Zi Dongping’s eyes snapped open.

The light in his eyes turned into two massive purple rivers as terrifying waves of energy shot towards Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo. No matter how injured he was, his status as a Primal Ancestor couldn’t be challenged. Even a Ninth Heaven True Saint wouldn’t be able to last for a second if they were struck by the purple river.

However, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary True Saint. He welcomed the purple river with a single punch.

“Heavenly Master’s Incarnation!”

Holy force surged through the surroundings as a phantom of the Heavenly Master appeared in the air. With the power to control life and death, the phantom punched Zi Dongping.

Hei Luo didn’t remain idle as he made his move.

Boom!

Two punches tore the purple river in half.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
