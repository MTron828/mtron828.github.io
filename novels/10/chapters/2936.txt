Chapter 2937: You’re a Son of Creation too?

“What?!” Zeng Lei cried out as the corners of his mouth trembled uncontrollably, and his eyes widened in disbelief. The golden dragon behind Huang Xiaolong was too eye-catching!

Everyone else was similarly shocked. It seemed as though they had seen a monster!

“Huang Long… Huang Long Bloodline!” Zeng Lei yelled again after recovering from his shock. He could feel the heavenly might emitting from the golden dragon as he stared straight at Huang Xiaolong. Out of surprise, he had forgotten to make his move.

What shocked him, even more, was that Huang Xiaolong had completely released his qi at that moment and was actually a peak mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable!

How is he a peak mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable!

Several decades ago during the battle in Monarch Yu Sacred Land, was he not just a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor?

Sometime later, when he showed up in the Silver Shadow Creed, he was merely a Seventh-Order Primal Ancestor. How is it possible that in just several decades, Huang Xiaolong has managed to break through to Dao Venerable?!

No!

This is absolutely impossible!

Zeng Lei could not believe and accept this.

To him, even if it was the Huang Long Bloodline, it was impossible to have such unbelievable ability!

Indeed, Huang Shuai, who possessed the Huang Long Bloodline, did not.

Just then, a Sixth-Esteem Dao Venerable expert from the Dragon Fish branch Mystical Pavilion pointed at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief and uttered, “You, you’re the Son of Creation too? Don’t tell me there are two Sons of Creation in this world?!”

“No way, how could there be two Sons of Creation in the world! Absolutely impossible, I’m certain that one of them is fake!” Another expert shook his head in disagreement.

“But, this heavenly might felt so real. The giant golden dragon clearly connects with the world power of the Divine Tuo Holy World!” the former expert replied.

“The Son of Creation, Huang Shuai was appraised together by the ten patriarchs of the Dragon Fish Creed, Divination Creed, and Red Fox Creed, so he cannot be fake. Huang Xiaolong must be the fake one! He must have used some brilliant illusion technique or possessed the Dao Venerable Realm weapon with illusion technique restriction. What we saw and felt was all fake!” Many branch pavilion experts conjectured rowdily.

Zeng Lei lifted his hand to signal the crowd to be silent. Then, he forced himself to contain his shock to look at Huang Xiaolong. With a determined look in his eyes, he said firmly, “Huang Xiaolong, I don’t care if you’re the real Son of Creation or not, today, you must die!”

If Huang Xiaolong was truly the real Son of Creation, it must be the heavens helping him out!

The Huang Long Bloodline!

If he refined Huang Xiaolong into a pill, then that medicinal pill would most certainly have an unbelievable effect!

It would be far more than a lifetime benefit if he took that medicinal pill! Perhaps he could even break through peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable in the future, become invincible and crush the heavens! Even their main pavilion master would have to look up to him! Thinking of these things, Zeng Lei grew excited, and his heart pumped faster.

“Attack, capture Huang Xiaolong! I’ll deal with the beasts beside him, and the remaining twenty-six of you will join hands to capture him. Capture Huang Xiaolong, and you’ll be heavily rewarded!” Zeng Lei ordered impatiently.

Even if Huang Xiaolong was really the peak First Esteem Dao Venerable, Zeng Lei was certain his men could instantly subdue him easily.

Among the twenty-six men, four were Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, fourteen were Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, and the rest were Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable! This terrifying force was enough to wipe out any Dao Venerable experts below the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

“Yes!” Without hesitation, the twenty-six men charged towards Huang Xiaolong as everyone strived to be the first to capture him. They were afraid to lose out to one another.

A peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable was first to arrive before Huang Xiaolong, and with one punch, he wanted to destroy Huang Xiaolong once and for all!

However, Huang Xiaolong appeared unaffected. He did not use his three dao souls or any bit of his cosmos energy. He merely exerted the power of his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you take me as Bi Ye of the Xuanyuan Creed?! You really think you can blast me off with just a punch?!” The peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable expert laughed out loud in response.

At that moment, Huang Xiaolong’s fist connected.

Bang!

The moment they collided, the smile on the expert’s face vanished, and a terrifying look replaced it instantly. Subsequently, he was flung out and his right arm was shattered into pieces immediately. Following this, his chest turned into flecks, then it was his head, waist, lower body, and the remaining limbs. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He ended up turning into countless drops of blood rain!

Golden rain of blood!

Dao Venerable expert was known to live and die along with the world, and he was the strongest existence in the Huang Long World!

The dao physique in the Dao Venerable expert had the strongest defense in the Huang Long World so much so that a boundary weapon was unable to hurt them a single bit.

In fact, nobody had heard of any Dao Venerable expert being destroyed!

But now, a peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable of the branch pavilion had just been blasted off with a punch from Huang Xiaolong!

“What?!” Screams were heard.

The other experts of the branch pavilion were intimidated by what they saw. All those who had rushed forward initially halted immediately. Some were unable to stop in time and came right in front of Huang Xiaolong. Seeing him so close up, they were almost scared to death.

The golden rain of blood fluttered everywhere from the sky and soon enveloped half of the space.

The blood of a peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable expert was extremely powerful. Every drop of it contained astonishing grand dao energy.

Zeng Lei was also frightened and stopped dead in his tracks. His face was completely pale thinking back of the power that came along with Huang Xiaolong’s punch. He stuttered in fear, “You, this is the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth! You actually cultivated the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth successfully!”

Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!

The most powerful dao physique in the world!

The most frightening dao physique!

It only existed in legends, but till now, nobody had ever cultivated it successfully.

Now, he was looking at it with his own eyes!

As to why the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth was frightening, it was because, between every punch, it could use the power of the Huang Long World! The entire power!

No matter how terrifying the physiques of those from the Mystical Pavilion were, they couldn’t stand against Huang Xiaolong’s cosmos energy!

As soon as the other branch pavilion experts heard of the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, they were even more afraid, and their bodies turned cold as if hundreds of millions of years of icy rain had rained on them.

Huang Xiaolong looked at pale Zeng Lei and grinned widely, “That’s right, it’s the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!”

The dao physique of a Dao Venerable expert and the dao physique of a Primal Ancestor expert were two different concepts and the saint physique of a True Saint Realm couldn’t even be compared to them.

“Huang Xiaolong, I…” Zeng Lei was about to say something but was cut off as Huang Xiaolong’s punch headed straight towards him in a flash. He was taken by surprise, and a giant blade appeared instantly in his hands. This giant blade had many densely packed dao runes carved on it. Clearly, it was a Dao Venerable Realm weapon that had gone through many great blessings from Dao Venerable experts.

His giant blade swished horizontally in an attempt to block Huang Xiaolong’s punch.

Dong!

Huang Xiaolong’s fist hit the blade, and subsequently, Zeng Lei witnessed many cracks emerging on his giant blade, a Dao Venerable Realm weapon. Soon after, Huang Xiaolong did not change his stance and attacked Zeng Lei’s chest together with the giant blade.
