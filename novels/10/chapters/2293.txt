Chapter 2294: Going Overboard!

No one had expected Jiang Tian to side with the outsiders the moment he appeared. No one had expected him to smear Huang Xiaolong’s name in front of everyone present!

“Jiang Tian, how dare you make up lies to side with the outsiders? How dare you frame Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong?” Li Wen roared in anger. “When Yang Rong was baited by your Jiang Family to challenge Huang Xiaolong, everyone saw how you chose to make them sign the life or death challenge contract!”

Jiang Tian sneered, “Eminent Elder Li Wen, I’m merely speaking the truth. Why would I frame Huang Xiaolong? As for your accusation of me siding with the outsiders, that’s what framing is! Even if you’re an Eminent Elder, you can’t accuse me of something I didn’t do! You need to be punished for framing a Holy Prince!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Even if you say that there are many people who saw me forcing Huang Xiaolong to sign the contract, you can call them out to testify against me!”

Jiang Tian smirked.

As for Li Wen and the others, their expressions were in stark contrast as they turned gloomy the moment Jiang Tian challenged them.

When Jiang Tian had forced Huang Xiaolong to sign the life or death contract, the family leaders present were those who were on the Jiang Family’s side! There was no way they would testify against Jiang Tian!

Luo Hong sneered, “Li Wen, did you hear that? Huang Xiaolong was the one who forced my junior brother to sign the life or death contract. He conspired against a Holy Prince of my Evolving Dragon Holy Ground! Since your head disciple can be a witness, why are you stopping me from taking the culprit away?!”

Tan Hongyi couldn’t help himself as he quickly tried to kick them while they were down. “Not only do you have to hand Huang Xiaolong over, but you also need to pay us with one thousand level-seven origin spiritual pills as tribute! Otherwise, our master will personally come over to negotiate with you guys! If he shows up, you’ll have to take out ten thousand rank-seven origin spiritual pills at the very least!”

“What?! One thousand level-seven origin spiritual pills?!”

Li Wen and the others raged.

Even as Eminent Elders, they wouldn’t be in possession of more than several level-seven origin spiritual pills. Even if they swept through the entire Zhuoyuan Holy Ground, they wouldn’t be able to find a hundred of them! Right now, the other party was requesting for a thousand of them!

“You’re going too far!” Xu Jun smashed the jade teacup in his hand and he seethed with fury, “Tan Hongyi, who do you think you are? The members of your Evolving Dragon Holy Ground came here to look for trouble, and Luo Hong even tried to assassinate our Holy Prince. Do you really think that we won’t kill all of you right here and now?”

Killing intent congealed throughout the hall, and it locked on to Luo Hong and everyone from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground.

Feeling the killing intent locked on to him, Luo Hong chuckled, “Xu Jun, why are you going so far for a single Huang Xiaolong? Do you really want to stake your Zhuoyuan Holy Ground on this? If you dare to harm any single one of us, my master will lead the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground to stomp on your Zhuoyuan Holy Gate! Do you think you will be able to endure the wrath of my patriarch?”

“Hand over Huang Xiaolong and one thousand level-seven origin spiritual pills, and we’ll pretend as though nothing happened.”

“How about that? One thousand level-seven origin spiritual pills isn’t a large number at all. We spent so much to nurture Junior Brother Yang Rong, and you should compensate us for it!”

Jiang Tian interrupted all of them before anyone could rebut Luo Hong. “That’s right. Eminent Elder Li Wen, are you really going to send our Holy Gate down the path of no return for a mere Huang Xiaolong? As the leader of the Holy Princes, I have to stand up for us! We cannot allow you to ruin our future over a small conflict!”

Wan Zhuoyuan laid down the order in the past. When the thirteen doyens were unable to come up with a conclusion, Jiang Tian, as the top-ranked Holy Prince, would be allowed to make the decisions for them.

Since the Eminent Elders were biased towards Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Tian had made up his mind to tear off all pretences and go to war with them.

Now that the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground had sent people to get rid of Huang Xiaolong for him, he would go along with it, sending his strongest ‘competitor’ to the afterlife without lifting a finger!

“Jiang Tian!” Gong Chen lost it, and he growled, “As a Holy Prince of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, you have been siding with the Evolving Dragon Holy Grouns the moment you stepped into the hall! You have been trying to send Huang Xiaolong to his death all this while, and according to the rules of the Holy Gate, we Eminent Elders should strip you of your rank and send you to the Holy Prison!”

The Holy Prison was a place used to detain Holy Princes who broke the rules of the Holy Gate.

However, Jiang Tian seemed completely unaffected as he said, “Gong Chen, bring out the evidence if you wish to accuse me! You’re accusing me of plotting against a fellow Holy Prince because I spoke the truth. This is blatant ignorance of the rules! Am I fair to say that all of you are conspiring against me?”

“Enough!” Luo Hong stood up and interrupted them. “Enough of the internal affairs of your Zhuoyuan Holy Gate. Right now, I’ll give you five minutes to consider whether or not you’ll be handing Huang Xiaolong over. I have no time to waste with you!”

“Moreover, you’ll have to give us one thousand level-seven origin spiritual pills in a month’s time. All of you doyens will bring them to me personally in the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground!”

Luo Hong laid down the order and prepared to leave.

Too bad for him, all he was met with was a cold snort from Li Wen. “Luo Hong, let me tell you our answer now. Firstly, we will not be handing Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong over to you. Secondly, neither are we going to give you level-seven origin spiritual pills as compensation. Thirdly, you carried out a sneak attack on our Holy Prince and injured Guardian Gu Tianxing in the process. For that, you will have to leave your spatial divine artifacts behind as an apology!”

Li Wen’s words rang through the hall, leaving everyone in stunned silence.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t stupid as he quickly made his way to the thirteen Eminent Elders’ side.

Luo Hong roared with laughter when he heard what Li Wen said. “Li Wen, what the f*ck did you just say to me?! Are you delirious?!”

“Alright. Since you refuse to hand him over, you have to bear the consequences!”

“You forced me to make a move!”

Luo Hong released his aura completely, and a terrifying gale swept through the hall.

With the suppressive might of his aura, the thirteen Eminent Elders felt an irrepressible pressure landing on them, and they found it difficult to breathe!

“Ninth Tribulation Half-True Saint!” Li Wen’s expression finally changed.

Luo Hong chuckled coldly in response. “That’s right. I am already at the peak of the Ninth Tribulation Half-True Saint Realm! With my top hundred ranked saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, none of you can fight me!” He raised his arm and grabbed at Huang Xiaolong, who was standing beside Li Wen.

“Huang Xiaolong, get over here!”
