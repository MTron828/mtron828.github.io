The person stationed right outside the pool was Yan Tianchen, and another marshal stood behind him.

“Huang Xiaolong...” Yan Tianchen laughed when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s arrival. His smile was gentle, and there were no traces of any injuries left from the battle between him and Huang Xiaolong’s two odd beasts.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and said, “I wish to cultivate in the Heavenly Court Lightning Pool. Open the gates.”

Yan Tianchen seemed to have anticipated whatever Huang Xiaolong wanted to say, and he chuckled, “Of course. As the winner of the Battle of the Heavenly Court, you are allowed to cultivate in the lightning pool whenever you wish. However, The keys aren’t with me right now, and I can’t open the gate.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned, and he narrowed his eyes. “What are you trying to say?”

Yan Tianchen laughed. “Only our Emperor has the key to open the gates.”

“Why don’t you ask Di Jun for the keys then?”

When Shi Yu, who was standing behind Yan Tianchen, heard what Huang Xiaolong said, he raged. “Preposterous! How dare you call the Heavenly Emperor by name?! Do you really think that we can’t deal with you just because of your identity as the King of Grandmist’s disciple?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother glancing at Yu Shi, and he merely turned to Yan Tianchen.

Raising his arm, Yan Tianchen stopped Yu Shi. “I have no idea. Our Heavenly Prince received grave injuries, and the Heavenly Emperor brought him to a mysterious place to recover. No one knows where he is right now, and I can’t retrieve the key from him.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered in response.

Damn you, Di Jun! How dare you use such a lousy excuse to prevent me from entering the lightning pool!

“If Di Jun refuses to show himself, the lightning pool won’t be open. Am I right?” A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Yan Tianchen put on a serious face as he said, “That’s right! Please take your leave. We will call for you as soon as he comes back.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response. “Do you really think I’ll leave?”

Yu Shi was unable to hold himself back any longer, and he screamed, “The Heavenly Court Lightning Pool is the core region of the Heavenly Court. Do you really think that you can do whatever you want here? If you dare to barge into the lightning pool, you’ll receive the death sentence! We’ll kill your relatives and anyone related to you! Even if we take you down, your master, the King of Grandmist, won’t be able to save you! We’ll uphold the rules of the Heavenly Court no matter what happens!”

Huang Xiaolong nearly laughed out loud in response. “Are you sure?” The space behind him fluctuated, and the two odd beasts appeared again.

The instant they appeared, one of them raised its palm and slammed Yu Shi into the pillar behind him. He turned into meat paste instantly, and his godhead was exterminated together with his soul.

Yan Tianchen felt his vision going blurry.

In a secret space somewhere deep in the Heavenly Court, Di Jun and Di Jing were soaring through the air. On the surface, Di Jing’s injuries had healed entirely.

“Father, are you really going to allow Huang Xiaolong to cultivate in the lightning pool?” Di Jing knew that Huang Xiaolong had the chaos lightning pool and felt extremely unsettled that Huang Xiaolong’s strength would increase once again.

“Don’t worry about that.”

Di Jun laughed and continued, “The keys are with me. I’ve activated the Locking Dragon Formation on the gates, and no matter how Huang Xiaolong tries, he won’t be able to enter the lightning pool. Even if he brings out the two beasts, he won’t be able to break the formation.”

When he mentioned Huang Xiaolong, a trace of killing intent rose inside Di Jing. A cold light flashed through his eyes. He felt that he wouldn’t be able to relax unless he killed Huang Xiaolong. Even though Huang Xiaolong was the disciple of the King of Grandmist, he thought that he should be the only genius in the world! “I’m the embodiment of Heavenly Dao itself! As soon as I break through to the Emperor Realm, no one in the world will be able to kill me! No one can threaten my position as the strongest talent the world has ever seen!”

Di Jun nodded his head and comforted his son, “Don’t worry. Your injuries will heal in no time with me around. I also obtained news about the Heavenly Dao Stone. With it, you’ll definitely be able to enter the Emperor Realm!”

“However, I have no confidence to deal with both the King of Grandmist and Jiang Hong’s rage. We can’t touch Huang Xiaolong for now.”

“Imperial Father, please be at ease.”

As the two of them spoke, they moved deeper and deeper into the mysterious space.

...

At the Heavenly Court Lightning Pool gates, Huang Xiaolong ignored Yan Tianchen and everyone else lying on the ground. He walked straight towards the entrance.

Arriving before the gate itself, Huang Xiaolong looked at the glow coming from the Locking Dragon Formation set by Di Jun. He frowned. He was obviously able to feel the might of the formation before him.

He retreated several steps after thinking about it for a moment, and he ordered the two beasts to smash the gates open.

In an instant, four arms shot out and slammed towards the gate. A destructive might containing the power to eradicate worlds blasted the gates.

A buzzing sound resounded in the air, and the explosion caused the world to shake. Huang Xiaolong was shocked at the fact that the gates remained completely intact. The restrictions on the gate seemed to be completely untouched after the attack from the two beasts.

Huang Xiaolong ordered them to transform before unleashing all their power on the gate.

BOOM!

After transforming into their true forms, the two beasts circulated all of the energy in their body before sending their strongest attack towards the gate. Cracks formed in the ground and the runes engraved on the gates started to crack.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked, but there was a trace of happiness hidden behind his shocked expression.

The two beasts struck out once again.

The restrictions on the gates were finally blasted open after the second wave of attack.

Huang Xiaolong walked through the gate as he approached the lightning pool with quick steps.

The moment he entered, a terrifying wave of energy struck him. Instead of acting surprised, a look of joy appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. The space past the gate was way larger than he had imagined. It was boundless, and two massive lightning pools hovered in mid-air. One was blue, and the other was black.

He wasn’t mistaken. One of the lightning pools was jet black. As blacklight rolled around it, the radiance of lightning lit up the sky.

Huang Xiaolong recognized both lightning pools the moment he laid eyes on them. They were the eighth-ranked ‘Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool’ and the third-ranked ‘Black Light Chaos Lightning Pool,’ respectively.

Huang Xiaolong quickly ordered the two beasts to stand guard at the gate, and he flew into the Black Light Chaos Lightning Pool. He sat down and circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, together with the Black Tortoise and Golden Dragon lightning pools in the space between his eyebrows. He swallowed the energy coming from the Black Light Chaos Lightning Pool at astonishing speed.

Di Jun, who was flying deeper into the secret region with his son, suddenly stopped when he received a transmission signal. The moment he opened it, a look of rage flashed past his face, and he nearly raged. Without a doubt, it was a report on Huang Xiaolong breaking into the Heavenly Court Lightning Pools sent by Yan Tianchen. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Di Jun clenched his fists, and his killing intent pierced the sky.

“Imperial Father, did something happen?” Di Jing couldn’t help but ask.

Di Jun passed the transmission symbol to Di Jing, and he didn’t say a word.

“Huang Xiaolong’s beasts managed to break through the formation!” Di Jing’s shock was evident on his face, and he roared in anger when he read the later parts of the report. “How dare he kill my marshal! Huang Xiaolong really thinks that we won’t dare to kill him! He even dares to barge into the core region of the Heavenly Court under our noses! Preposterous!”

Di Jun muttered under his breath with chilling, killing-intent concealed behind his calm expression, “I underestimated the power of his beasts. I never expected them to be able to break the formation guarding the gate...”

“Imperial Father, what are we going to do about this?!”
