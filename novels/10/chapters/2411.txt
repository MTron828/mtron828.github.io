Chapter 2412: You’re Not Only Embarrassing Yourself

“I’m afraid Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to take out so many low-grade saint artifacts when the time comes.” Lin Yijia chuckled softly.

According to the bet Huang Xiaolong had made, he would’ve to take out sixteen saint artifacts if he lost the bet.

Low-grade saint artifacts weren’t cabbages grown at the side of the street. Even existences like the patriarch of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate wouldn’t be able to take out sixteen low-grade saint artifacts as he pleased. If he were to lose them in a bet, he would probably vomit blood.

“Relax. Even if he can’t pay up, the four Primal Ancestors will be able to.” Xie Yao cackled loudly. “When he really kneels before the city gates, he will no longer be able to challenge Senior Brother Li Chen for the position of the patriarch. The four Primal Ancestors will be extremely disappointed in him, and his position in the Holy Heavens will definitely drop.”

“Whatever the case, won’t our masters rage at us after taking Huang Xiaolong up on the bet?” Chen Kaiping hesitated for a moment and asked.

It was finally Li Chen’s time to step up to reassure them. “You can rest assured. The condition of kneeling at the gates was brought up by Huang Xiaolong. We had nothing to do with this. Even if Grand Hall Master Wu Ge or the four Primal Ancestors try to blame us, they won’t be able to do a thing to us.”

“I’ve heard that Yu Fujiang of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate was slain by someone recently.” Lin Yijia changed the topic all of a sudden. “The killer’s name is Thirteen, and it’s said that he managed to obtain a Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast when adventuring the Profound River. He also managed to form some sort of connection with Lin Xiaoying.”

“I’ve heard of this too.” Li Chen nodded and continued, “Right now, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate has sent out a ton of experts to hunt him down. The rewards they are offering for his capture can be said to be a little tempting even for someone like me. They are willing to bring out a thousand pieces of high-grade holy spiritual jade stones and a holy martial art. They are also willing to give out a hundred pieces of high-grade origin spiritual pills...”

Chen Kaiping tutted, “That’s a pretty heavy reward.... The Holy Lands Alliance is really going all out this time. It’s no wonder the entire Holy World is fired up about this.”

“I’ve heard that the Beast Tamer Holy Emperor, Shen Jiewen, is planning to personally make a trip over to the Clear Snow Palace to ask Lin Xiaoying about Thirteen,” Li Chen explained.

“I’m more interested about Thirteen’s identity. He dares to kill Yu Fujiang from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate. It’s said that he’s only in the Seventh Order Venerable Realm. However, he managed to subdue two True Saints to be his subordinates,” Xie Yao revealed an excited expression as he chuckled to himself.

When Li Chen and the others were discussing Thirteen’s matters, Fu Yunjie was laughing to himself. After all, he was laughing at Huang Xiaolong for taking up Li Chen and the others on their bet.

A wave of satisfaction washed over him when he thought about Huang Xiaolong kneeling at the gates of the city.

“Whatever the case, I have to think of a way to get rid of Di Huai...,” Fu Yunjie muttered to himself. He knew that Di Huai would pose a hidden danger to him as long as Huang Xiaolong lived. No matter how they humiliated Huang Xiaolong, he was still the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong finally returned to the Blue Dragon Manor. When he saw Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and the others, a celebration took place.

They asked about everything he went through in the time he had left, and Huang Xiaolong spoke of his adventures with a smile on his face. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, he didn’t say anything about Chen Zhi and the others. Right now, he knew that it was for the best if no one knew about his identity as Thirteen.

After replying to all of them, Huang Xiaolong started to ask about the matters that happened in the manor.

“Xiaolong, Fu Yunjie went to throw himself under Li Chen’s lead. He has been swaggering around arrogantly in the city without anyone to stop him.” Feng Tianyu explained, “In the past few years, when Lord Di Huai, and I went out to shop around, we ran into him, and he threw insults at us without restraint. He would buy anything we set out eyes on no matter the price....”

“Oh?” Frosty light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. It seemed as thought Fu Yunjie was really favored by Li Chen. He actually dared to move against the members of the Blue Dragon Manor openly.

“Did he do anything to you guys physically?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Di Huai received the question. “He doesn’t dare to. After all, we are all from the Blue Dragon Manor.”

“He even teased Wenyue...,” Feng Tianyu’s disciple, Xue Qi, spoke all of a sudden.

The temperature in the hall dropped by several degrees the moment the words left her lips. Killing intent welled up in Huang Xiaolong’s heart as he smashed the cup in his hand to pieces.

“Young Master...,” Zhang Wenyue shook her head when she realized that Huang Xiaolong was about to blow. “Even though what he said was nasty, he wouldn’t dare to do anything to us.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly. “Don’t worry. Fu Yunjie won’t be able to hop around for much longer.” He quickly told the others about the bet he had made with Li Chen and the other Holy Princes.

The night passed eventually.

As soon as the sun rose the next day, Huang Xiaolong left the manor and went towards the Holy Heavens headquarters. He planned to meet his masters in the Primal Ancestors’ space in the depths of the organization.

“Breaking news! His Highness Huang Xiaolong made a bet with Holy Prince Li Chen! If Huang Xiaolong fails to qualify after the Trial of Blood, he will kneel before the city gates of the Holy Heavens City! He will also lose sixteen low-grade saint artifacts!”

“What?! Trial of Blood? I’ve heard that only Ninth Tribulation Half-True Saints will be able to qualify for the top three hundred spots! Is Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong crazy?”

“I’ve heard that Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong recently returned from his adventures in the outside world. He doesn’t know about the new rules regarding the Trial of Blood! He was also the one who proposed the idea of kneeling at the gates of the city if he lost!”

“Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong is screwed! Even though he can be said to be the most talented individual in the Holy World, the Trial of Blood requires true strength! With his combat ability, he wouldn’t be able to change the outcome of the battle! When he kneels at the gates of the Holy Heavens City, he will turn into a laughing stock of the Holy World!”

Huang Xiaolong heard the discussions along the streets before he even neared the headquarters. There were some who were concerned for him, and there were others who laughed at his stupidity. There were also some who felt that it was extremely unfair for Huang Xiaolong. Whatever the case, everyone felt that it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to win the bet.

“That’s fast....” Huang Xiaolong laughed in his heart.

It hadn’t been a full day, and the details of the bet had already reached the members of the public. He didn’t need a working brain to know that Li Chen, Xie Yao, and the others were fanning the flames from behind.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Holy Heavens Manor, the guard disciples bowed in greeting, but a weird expression flashed in his eyes. It was clear that even someone like him had managed to learn of the bet.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the weird look the disciple was giving him, and he entered the manor. He didn’t stop as he made his way towards the Primal Ancestors’ space.

As soon as he arrived before them, he was met with a frown from Tyrant Chu. “Humph! Brat, you’re really confident in your abilities.... You didn’t even ask about the details of the Trial of Blood and you made a bet with Li Chen. I wouldn’t care if you made a simple bet, but why did you add the condition of kneeling at the city gates for a day? You’ll be embarrassing all four of us when that happens!”
