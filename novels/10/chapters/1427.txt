Several months passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars finished refining the early Third Order God King Realm Buddha Paste, and Buddhism energy coursed vigorously inside their bodies.

Huang Xiaolong continued to refine the second piece of Buddha Paste.

He chose to refine another early Seventh Order God King Realm Buddha Paste. After he finished refining all the early Seventh Order God King Realm Buddha Paste, he moved on to the mid-Seventh Order, then late-Seventh Order God King Realm Buddha Pastes.

His momentum grew significantly day by day as high-level God King Realm Buddha Pastes disappeared from the world one after another. Robust Buddhism energy filled the whole cultivation room, lighting the room in a golden luminance.

While Huang Xiaolong was refining the God King’s Buddha Pastes, chaos lightning qi from the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool was tempering and strengthening his physique and godhead.

The four divine fires were shining brightly within Huang Xiaolong’s body as chaos spiritual energy fell from the void.

In the upper part of Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness, the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell was emitting a silvery moonlight essence that fell on his three supreme godheads, nourishing his three godheads and his souls, strengthening them.

...

The days went by.

The Dragon Shark Flying Ship continued to speed through space, passing by various world surfaces as Huang Xiaolong and his group journeyed back to the Vientiane World.

The journey proceeded smoothly.

As Huang Xiaolong and others each cultivated inside the cultivation rooms, four years went by in the blink of an eye.

Four years later, somewhere within the Vientiane World’s surface, ripples waved across the air as a space crack appeared as if torn by something, and ann enormous flying ship emerged from the void.

The flying ship’s door opened and a group of people exited it. This group consisted of Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er and the others that had returned from the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

The sun was shining bright at this time of the day.

The fluffy white clouds were floating quietly high in the sky, and the radiant sunshine shining over several hundred li of Vientiane World. A peaceful feeling filled Huang Xiaolong’s chest seeing this view. He stretched and took a few deep breaths, with all of his pores shouting, ‘I’m finally back!’

To Huang Xiaolong, the Vientiane World surface was his home in the Divine World, therefore, the feeling of returning home was very good.

“Master, are we heading back to the Fortune Gate now?” Xiang Xun inquired.

Huang Xiaolong was just about to say something when his expression turned frosty all of a sudden. He looked around the surrounding land and stated, “We’re above the Green Cloud Island?!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Green Cloud Island, was the place where Huang Xiaolong had arrived when he had first ascended to the Divine World.

“It is the Green Cloud Island. Does the Master want to go over and take a look?” Feng Er asked. Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San knew that the first force Huang Xiaolong had entered was the Barbarian God Sect, therefore, the Barbarian God Sect had a special place in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and made ‘en’ sound in agreement. “Since we’re already on Green Cloud Island, might as well go take a look.” He put the Dragon Shark Flying Ship into the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space.

“Let’s go!”

Huang Xiaolong led the group and flew towards the Barbarian God Sect.

But they had not flown far when Huang Xiaolong suddenly halted and dove downwards.

The others were baffled by Huang Xiaolong’s abrupt action but followed him.

Huang Xiaolong descended in front of a fort. His eyes flickered while he looked at the fort as a name popped into his mind, ‘Tie Family Fort.’

Since he had left Green Cloud Island, Huang Xiaolong had been focusing on improving his strength that he had almost forgotten about the Tie Family Fort’s people who had given him the warmth of a family in the past. Passing by the Tie Family’s Fort, Huang Xiaolong was reminded of the pair of siblings, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu.

They were the first people he met in the Divine World.

With the rest of the group behind him, Huang Xiaolong strode towards the Tie Family Fort’s entrance.

At this time, a gloomy atmosphere was enveloping the Tie Family Fort.

The Tie Family Fort’s Lord, Tie Qianyuan was lying on the floor of the hall with blood flowing out from his mouth. Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were crying their hearts out.

“Father, you, you must hang on!” Tie Xinlan cried woefully.

Tie Quanyuan shook his head and said, “My internal organs are shattered, and godhead is cracked. I don’t think I can hold on for long. After Father is gone, you two must live on, live well, cultivate diligently, but never, ever think of avenging my death!”

Tie Mu shook his head vehemently, choking on his tears as he said, “No, Father! You’re going to be alright, I will definitely avenge you!”

Tie Qianyuan forced himself to raise his voice, sternly reprimanding, “So now, you don’t even want to listen to my words anymore?! I’m telling you not to avenge me, did you hear me?!” His eyes were needled with piercing sharpness.

In the end, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu both nodded, and promised.

“After I die, both of you quickly leave the Tie Family Fort, as you can no longer stay here.” Tie Qianyuan’s voice weakened abruptly, as he insisted, “Go look for your Third Uncle at the Sky Will Country.”

“But, with Prince Chen’s power, I’m afraid he would find you two in no time. Even though Prince Chen’s hand won’t be able to stretch into the Sky Will Country, but he has many Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciples, and if he borrows the Barbarian God Sect’s power, then...!” Tie Qianyuan sighed heavily with worry.

“Father, what about we look for Big brother Huang at the Barbarian God Sect?” Tie Xinlan suddenly suggested.

Tie Qianyun blanked for a moment, but a light emerged in his eyes. “You mean Huang Xiaolong?”

Tie Mu nodded, “That’s right, if we can find Big brother Huang, he would surely help us!”

Tie Qianyuan shook his head, “Although Huang Xiaolong is also a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple, the other inner disciples who are in good terms with Prince Chen have the backing of an Elder, and Grand Elder. So, Huang Xiaolong might not be willing to offend those inner disciples because of us. Not to mention, even if he’s willing to help us, he might be powerless to do anything. Though it has been several decades since he entered the Barbarian God Sect, I don’t think he has much influence within the sect.”

As the Tie Family Fort was located in a remote area, their news was somewhat outdated. Therefore, Tie Qianyuan was assuming that Huang Xiaolong was merely a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu’s face turned bleak as their hopes dashed.

Suddenly, a Tie Family Fort’s disciple ran excitedly into the hall while shouting, “Fort Lord, Young Lord, Young Miss, Young Warrior Huang is here, he’s right outside!”

Young Warrior Huang? The three people didn’t react for a moment.

“You, you’re saying, it’s Huang Xiaolong, Big brother Huang? He’s here, right outside?!” Tie Xinlan was the first to react and stammered in excitement.

The Tie Family Fort’s disciple nodded, “Yes, Young Warrior Huang is right outside.” He had seen Huang Xiaolong in the past so he knew how Huang Xiaolong looked.

“Xinlan, Mu’er, help me outside.” Tie Qianyuan struggled to his feet.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were alarmed and just as they wanted to dissuade him, Tie Qianyuan shook his head, “Don’t worry, I can hold on for a few days.” He barely finished his sentence, when blood started flowing out from the corner of his mouth again.

Snapped by Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu had no choice but to help their father out towards the Tie Family Fort’s entrance. From afar, the three of them spotted Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

Huang Xiaolong was initially waiting for the Tie Family Fort’s disciple to take him inside after reporting his arrival to Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu. But when he saw the three of them come out a moment later, Tie Qianyuan seemed to be injured, and the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards them in a hurry.

“Big brother Huang!” Tears flooded Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu’s eyes when they saw Huang Xiaolong.

“Who was it?” Huang Xiaolong asked sternly.

Tie Qianyuan forced a smile on his face, whizzing slightly as he said, “It’s alright, I happened to spar with someone a few days ago, and was accidentally injured by the other party. I’ve made Young Warrior Huang see a joke. Several decades have passed since we’ve last seen each other, and Young Warrior Huang is still as dazzling.”

Tie Qianyuan had decided against telling Huang Xiaolong the truth, considering the other party’s powerful force.
