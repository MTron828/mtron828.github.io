Chapter 486: Give You Double Reward

The Violent Lion Temple generals were extremely shocked. The skinny young man beside Ao Kun actually forced back their revered invincible Temple Master!

Lei Ge’s expression changed again and again before bursting into laughter, “Ao Kun, this is the expert that your Nine Dragons Temple hired?”

In Lei Ge’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong was merely a subordinate hired by Ao Kun.

“Young man, what did Ao Kun give you that tempted you to serve the Nine Dragons Temple?” Lei Ge then added, “How about you join my Violent Lion Temple? I can give you double the reward!”

Ao Kun and the Nine Dragons Temple experts had odd expressions on their faces. Especially Ao Kun. The corner of his lips twitched.

“All of you retreat.” Huang Xiaolong interrupted everyone thoughts at this moment.

Retreat? Lei Ge was bewildered, trying to figure out the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words. But in the next moment, he saw Ao Kun and all the experts from the Nine Dragons Temple comply respectfully: “Yes, Master!”

Ao Kun and the Nine Dragons Temple experts retreated behind Huang Xiaolong, in the distance.

The eyes of Lei Gei and the present Violent Lion Temple experts were protruding from their sockets from astonishment.

Master?!

Just now, what did those Nine Dragons Temple experts call that young human? Master?!

Ao Kun, as the acknowledged Ten Directions Continent’s strongest expert, actually recognized a human youth as his Master?! Lei Ge and the rest found it hard to believe.

Huang Xiaolong walked toward Lei Ge slowly, the expression on his face cold like a brewing blizzard, “Lei Ge, today you only have to two options; one, submit to me like Ao Kun, two, choose death.”

Huang Xiaolong’s voice reverberated through the whole Violent Lion Temple and even the men guarding in every corner of the temple heard each word clearly, stunning them silly.

Raucous laughter sounded from Lei Ge’s mouth after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words. His deep, sonorous voice thundered high in the air as he fixed a glare at Huang Xiaolong with a dangerous glint in his eyes, “Little kiddo, I don’t know why Ao Kun and his lackeys submitted to you, but even so, relying on these Nine Dragons Temple experts, do you think you can withstand my entire Violent Lion Temple’s Retaliation?”

At that point, all Violent Lion Temple’s experts emerged from every corner of the temple, crowding the square in a tight encirclement. There were tens of thousands of people, including a large group of early and mid-level Saint realm experts.

Other than the one hundred and eight generals, there was another elite group named Guardian Vajra under Lei Ge’s command, consisting solely of Saint realm experts.

All these years, Lei Ge had been accumulating his forces secretly, and today, the Violent Lion Temple’s overall strength had exceeded the Nine Dragons Temple.

Watching Huang Xiaolong and Ao Kun’s group cut being off from any possibilities of escape, Lei Ge smirked, “Ao Kun, what do you think? My Violent Lion Temple’s strength is not bad, right? All these years I’ve been slowly expanding my forces, all for the purpose of annihilating your Nine Dragons Temple one day and rule over the entire demonic beast race!”

Ao Kun’s gaze swept over the mass of Violent Lion Temple experts, a cold sneer rising at the corner of his mouth. No hints of panic or fear could be detected.

“Kill them for me!” Lei Ge roared suddenly, issuing the kill order.

Immediately, Violent Lion Temple’s experts rushed toward Huang Xiaolong, Ao Kun, and the Nine Dragons Temple experts in crazed madness.

Huang Xiaolong’s narrowed his eyes, slightly veiling the coldness in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, the Devils and Ghosts Flag flew shot up high into the sky, growing bigger as it did so. After reaching a hundred zhang tall, it secured itself directly into the fabric of space.

Intense ghost aura flooded out, turning into one evil spirit after another.

Ghost aura pierced the sky. The whole Violent Lion Temple was shaken by the flood of monstrous ghost aura.

This sudden scene made Lei Ge and the Violent Lion Temple experts’ faces tighten.

Each evil spirits formed from that ghost aura actually possessed Saint realm strength. Moreover, they didn’t merely possess the strength of early-level Saint realm, but the strength of Fifth to Sixth Order Saint realm!

Before this odious evil spirits army, the tens of thousands of Violent Lion Temple experts that were rushing forward looked like rotten wood, being instantly pulverized into smithereens without any power to resist.

“Retreat, quickly retreat!” Lei Ge anxiously bellowed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In fact, even without Lei Ge’s order, the Violent Lion Temple experts had dispersed in all directions like headless chickens, screaming in fear. Whether it be those who ran first or those who ran last, all of them were turned into nourishment for the evil spirits.

The great evil spirits army spread out several hundred li in every direction, crushing everything in its path before stopping.

Some Violent Lion Temple experts that managed to survive breathed out in relief seeing this, feeling the damp robe sticking to their backs.

When the great evil spirits army stopped, it had surrounded the whole Violent Lion Temple.

“You, you’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Lei Ge blurted the question out in shock, staring at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s Poison Corpse Scarabs were terrifying, however, his Devils and Ghosts Flag also caused those who heard of it to turn deathly pale. It finally struck Lei Ge who this young human in front of him was!

“Huang Xiaolong!”

“He’s Huang Xiaolong!”

Hearing that, all Violent Lion Temple generals and experts became ashen.

Despite their discussion full of bravado earlier, not putting Huang Xiaolong in their eyes, at the crucial moment when Huang Xiaolong was in front of them, the fear in their hearts was irresistible.

Huang Xiaolong did not say anything. He waved his hand, sending out a huge swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs.

Watching those Poison Corpse Scarabs flying toward them, Lei Ge’s general retinue and other experts became whiter than corpses.

Half an hour later.

Apart from Lei Ge, the entirety of the Violent Lion Temple experts and Lei Ge’s generals were bitten by Poison Corpse Scarabs. However, Huang Xiaolong kept their lives. These experts merely lost the strength to resist.

Ao Kun and the group of Nine Dragons Temple expert witnessed Huang Xiaolong crush the Violent Lion Temple without losing a single soldier or waste much effort in a mere half an hour, beads of sweat rolled down their foreheads like a storm.

The nine Ao brothers rejoiced inwardly, extremely glad they decided to adhere to the bet they made with Huang Xiaolong, willingly submit to him. Otherwise, their ending would be too miserable to describe.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re merely relying on those Poison Corpse Scarabs and the Devils and Ghosts Flag, I refuse to accept this defeat! If you are somewhat capable, come and fight me fair and square with your own strength!” Lei Ge repelled a cluster of Poison Corpse Scarabs with a punch, roaring in fury at Huang Xiaolong with red glowing eyes.

Ao Kun was the first to shake his head when he heard Lei Ge challenge Huang Xiaolong. If he knew that the nine brothers still lost to Huang Xiaolong in a nine against one battle, perhaps Lei Ge wouldn’t be feeling so upright and confident.

With a casual wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong retrieved all the Poison Corpse Scarabs and disappeared in a flicker. He appeared in front of Lei Ge, flicking out an elixir at him, “This is a ten-thousand-year-old Spirit Clearing Thistle, swallow it, recover your battle qi.”

Ten-thousand-year-old Spirit Clearing Thistle!

Lei Ge’s arm reached out to catch the elixir while looking at Huang Xiaolong with obvious doubt, but he still swallowed it down in the end. Instantly, his depleted battle qi that was used to deal with the Poison Corpse Scarabs was replenished in the shortest time.

Lei Ge wasted no time to trigger his beast transform, awaking the ancient divine lion bloodline in his body, transforming into a giant flame lion and charged at Huang Xiaolong.

A chain of collisions thundered in the air, but it merely lasted a few minutes before everything quieted down.

Similar to Ao Kun’s situation before, Lei Ge plummeted to the ground with a punch from Huang Xiaolong, head and neck buried in the ground, no longer able to move.

One hour later, more than half of the Violent Lion Temple’s one hundred and eight generals chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong, leaving a few stubborn ones. Huang Xiaolong decisively moved them into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, letting the Poison Corpse Scarabs deal with them.

Whereas Lei Ge chose to submit in the end.

After Lei Ge and the rest of the Violent Lion Temple experts chose to submit, Huang Xiaolong ordered them to release their soul barriers. All of them were branded with a soul imprint. At this point, both the Nine Dragons Temple and Violent Lion Temple was fully under Huang Xiaolong’s control.

Thus, only the Ape Deity Temple remained.

The same method was used to prevent news about the Violent Lion Temple battle from leaking out, the entire Violent Lion City was in lockdown.

Three days later, Lei Ge and everyone’s wounds healed and Huang Xiaolong led Nine Dragons Temple and Violent Lion Temple’s experts to the Ape Deity Temple.

But, what surprised Huang Xiaolong was, when they arrived in Ape Deity Temple, the Temple Master Zhou Yunpeng wasn’t around! Capturing the Ape Deity Temple’s second in command for questioning, he spilled everything in a stammering voice, “Our Temple Master received news that a Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey appeared in the Mystic Elephant Peak’s proximity. Two days ago, our Temple Master departed to the Mystic Elephant Peak to capture that Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey and refine its spirit devourer bloodline!”
