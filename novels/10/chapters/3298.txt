Chapter 3299: Asking About Someone

“Yes, yes, yes. Senior Huang, my father is Murong Di.” He replied hastily.

Several days ago, a deputy head of the school handed in his resignation, and Murong Qing’s plan was to get someone from the Murong Family over to take over his position. However, the slot was taken away by someone called Huang Xiaolong, and he felt a little uncomfortable in his heart! After he investigated the man, he received a huge shock.

Huang Xiaolong!

The leader of the grand elders of the Huang Family!

He reported the matter to his father, Murong Di, and he didn’t think that his father and the old ancestor of the Murong Family would rush over to the university that very day!

The two of them came specifically to remind him to be respectful to Huang Xiaolong! According to them, he would have to respect the man more than the old ancestor of the Murong Family!

Murong Qing was terrified when he heard their warnings.

That was the reason the scene before them played out that very day. As the principal of the university, he was extremely enthusiastic when welcoming a deputy head! That was something unheard of before!

Initially, he thought that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t someone important, and he raised his view to his father. He was scolded so badly that he didn’t dare to show the slightest disrespect to Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t even dare to ask about Huang Xiaolong’s matters, lest he be punished by the old ancestor!

“Oh? Is Murong Deng your grandfather?” Huang Xiaolong recalled the members of the Murong Family who attended the battle in the Blue Dragon Orchard. There was some guy called Murong Di beside Murong Deng, and he looked like the old man’s son. It was no wonder Murong Qing knew of his identity.

Raising his hand, Huang Xiaolong casually shook the other party’s hand.

Feeling as though he hit the jackpot of several trillion dollars, Murong Qing’s eyes lit up in glee and he exclaimed, “Yeah! Senior Huang, my grandfather is Murong Deng, and he told me to agree to any request you may have! As long as we can achieve it, our Murong Family will go through the depths of hell to fulfill your order!”

He was basically admitting that the Murong Family had submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

Chuckling lightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind. “Is my office ready yet?”

“Yeah! I had it prepared this morning, and we can head over right now!” Murong Qing pushed the doors open before welcoming Huang Xiaolong in with a friendly gesture.”

When the three of them finally left, the bald man and the lady stared at each other in shock.

The bald man was a disciple Murong Qing accepted, and he was the deputy dean of a field in the university. The lady was Murong Qing’s secretary, and it couldn’t be more clear that she was enough to take care of his every need…

Several moments later, Huang Xiaolong brought Huang Xiaolong into his office.

It was massive, and one could see the care put into the renovation.

It was even more luxurious than Murong Qing’s office, and it was clear that Murong Qing made special arrangements for the office to be made the way it was.

“This isn’t too bad.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw how careful Murong Qing was.

When Murong Qing heard what he said, he heaved a sigh of relief. Huang Xiaolong’s praise was more important than receiving recognition from a high-ranking officer in the nation.

Soon after, Murong Qing brought Huang Xiaolong over to his residence. It was a special villa, and it might be lacking when compared to his courtyard in the Blue Dragon Orchard, but it was well taken care of. Only vice principals and those ranked higher would be able to live in their own villas, but Murong Qing had made special arrangements for Huang Xiaolong to get one.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind too much. After all, he would only be staying for some time. The residence didn’t matter too much to him.

“In the future, there’s no need for you to call me Senior Huang. You can call me like how Murong Deng does.”

With his heart shaking in happiness, Murong Qing knew that Huang Xiaolong had accepted his acts of grace.

“Oh right. I wish to ask about someone.” Huang Xiaolong turned and asked, “Is the head of the university called Zhang Yuhan?”

Murong Qing felt his jaws drop in fright. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to ask about someone on his first day!

As the principal of the university, he should be more than familiar with the head of the school.

“Your Highness, Zhang Yuhan is indeed the head of our university.” Even though he didn’t understand why Huang Xiaolong was asking about her, he didn’t dare to hide anything. “However, she hasn’t been around as she has some family matters to deal with. She should be back after a week.”

“Oh? Do you know what’s going on with her family at the moment?” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Shaking his head, Murong Qing sighed, “I’m not too sure. If I were to guess, it should be related to her parents.”

However, he didn’t continue.

“What does it have to do with them?” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to back down now.

Nodding slowly, Murong Qing explained, “I've heard that her parents have been forcing her to marry someone since the start of the school term.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Who’s the man she’s supposed to marry?”

“He seems to be an eminent elder of the Six Swords Gate… But I’m not too sure which eminent elder it is…”

Six Swords Gate?

Why was it them again?

Huang Xiaolong seemed to have heard of them since he stepped into Earth.

When he thought about it, the power of the Six Swords Gate was concentrated around the Huaxia Alliance, and it didn’t seem too out of place.

After asking several more questions, Huang Xiaolong dismissed Murong Qing.

Lin Kai looked at the principal who was leaving and a complicated expression could be seen on his face. He was finally convinced that his uncle’s status in the Huaxia Alliance was no joke! Even the principal of the best university in the nation had to be respectful to him!

“You can live with me if you feel out of place in your dormitory.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

As students were required to share a room with three other people, rooms would get squeezy fast.

Scratching his head, Lin Kai stuttered, “Umm… Would that be convenient?”

“What are you talking about?” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “It’s not like I’m hiding a woman here…”

Lin Kai chuckled under his breath and responded, “Alright! I’ll move over tomorrow!”

As the school term was starting soon, Lin Kai left to make his preparations.

Seeing as the sun was still pretty high up in the skies, Huang Xiaolong decided to head over to the library for a short while. He would be able to browse materials on the Pangu Axe while he was at it.

By the time he arrived, Huang Xiaolong realized that there wasn’t a single piece of news about his rampage on the streets! Not even the reporters of the small TV stations were talking about him! It was as though nothing happened, and even the social media platforms had nothing about the incident!

It was as though a power was suppressing the news in the dark!

When the witnesses of the battle told everyone what happened, everyone felt that they were hallucinating. Not a single soul believed their story.
