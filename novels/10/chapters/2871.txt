Chapter 2872: Picking a Blue Lotus

Outside the Blue Lotus Pond, all the gathered Ten Swords Creed’s disciples were overjoyed by Chen Dingtian’s arrival, and they rushed forward to welcome him.

“Greeting Senior Brother Chen Dingtian!”

Even other sacred lands, as well as creeds’ disciples, went up to greet Chen Dingtian.

“Where’s that punk?” Chen Dingtian asked the present Ten Swords Creed’s disciples icily.

The Ten Swords Creed’s disciple surnamed Chen quickly answered, “Knowing Senior Brother Chen is coming, that punk went hiding inside the Blue Lotus Pond!”

Chen Dingtian’s gaze turned colder still as he spoke, “Does he think he can hide inside the Blue Lotus Pond for a lifetime? Never mind, I’ll wait for him outside the Blue Lotus Pond, and he can live for a few more days inside.”

The pressure within the Blue Lotus Pond rapidly consumed everyone’s grand dao energy. Even a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor wouldn’t last more than ten days in that kind of environment. Therefore, Chen Dingtian wasn’t worried that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t come out.

Thus, Chen Dingtian sat cross-legged in the air, closed his eyes, and entered meditation as he waited for Huang Xiaolong to come out.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Blood Sword floated in front of him in the air, glowing in blood-red luster.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong, Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, and Duan Zheng continued to head into the deeper region.

As they got deeper, the pressure of water energy pressing against them had increased greatly. At Duan Feng, Duan Zheng, and Long Jianfei’s current strengths, every step was a strenuous effort that Huang Xiaolong had to help dissipate the pressure around them.

“Your Highness, it would be better if you go ahead alone. We can wait for you here,” Long Jianfei suggested.

At this rate, they would only be dragging Huang Xiaolong back.

“Alright,” Huang Xiaolong agreed after some thought.

But considering Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, and Duan Zheng’s safety, Huang Xiaolong left the Immemorial Ice and Fire Qilins with the three of them. With the pair of qilins around, even if the three of them couldn’t find any blue lotus, there was a chance of finding blue lotus nectar.

From there on, Huang Xiaolong separated from Duan Feng and the others.

Without Duan Feng and the others, Huang Xiaolong moved twice as fast.

Half a day later.

Huang Xiaolong stopped abruptly.

A short distance in front of him, right above the water surface, was a drop of silvery golden liquid suspended in midair, and it was extremely agile as if it was a living entity. It emitted a golden-silver halo, and it looked gentle and comforting. Seemingly, this drop of liquid was the concentration of the world’s most captivating lights.

Blue lotus nectar!

Huang Xiaolong beamed with joy.

There were two kinds of treasures to be found in the Blue Lotus Pond, one was the blue lotus, and the other was blue lotus nectar!

Although blue lotus nectar was far from a blue lotus, it beat most of high-grade holy pills. Moreover, blue lotus nectar also contained a trace of creation qi, and it was beneficial for Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation!

However, just as Huang Xiaolong extended his palm to suck the drop of blue lotus nectar over, the blue lotus nectar turned into a streak of light and escaped, disappearing from Huang Xiaolong’s sight.

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded.

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s speed, under the hindrance of Blue Lotus Pond’s environment pressure, he couldn’t catch up to the fleeing blue lotus nectar.

After momentary dazedness, Huang Xiaolong smacked his forehead in absolute regret.

Long Jianfei had already told him that similar to the blue lotus, blue lotus nectar also had its own awareness. It would flee if it was not contained before trying to acquire it.

He had forgotten Long Jianfei’s caution due to the excitement that rushed to his head.

He should have blocked the area with his Huang Long Bloodline’s aura.

Huang Xiaolong soon calmed down and continued deeper in.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong came across his second drop of blue lotus nectar.

Having learned his lesson from earlier, Huang Xiaolong carefully spread out his Huang Long Bloodline aura, encircling the blue lotus nectar.

Huang Xiaolong tried moving forward a little, and as expected, the drop of blue lotus nectar did not flee like the previous one. It suspended silently at the same place. Not only that, it actually flew towards Huang Xiaolong a second later, emitting rings of bright light as if it was extremely happy.

Huang Xiaolong was thrilled.

The drop of blue lotus nectar fell into Huang Xiaolong’s palm without suspense.

As he looked at the nectar droplet suspended above his palm, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Good little guy, this time, you can’t escape!”

With his Huang Long Bloodline, wouldn’t the blue lotus and blue lotus nectar in this Blue Lotus Pond be his to take?

Naturally, there were distinctions between blue lotuses as well. Low-grade blue lotus had only one lotus seed, whereas high-grade blue lotus could have as many as nine lotus seeds, or even ten!

Even a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert would go crazy to snatch a nine-seeded blue lotus.

Huang Xiaolong proceeded further in.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong collected his second drop of blue lotus nectar, followed by the third drop, then the fourth, and so on…

A little over an hour later, Huang Xiaolong had collected six drops!

For other disciples, who had entered the Blue Lotus Pond, the heavens would have heard their prayers if they managed to get even two or three drops of blue lotus nectar, and it would make them forget their own names. But Huang Xiaolong had found six drops in a little over an hour!

“At this rate, by the time I go out, I should be able to collect one thousand drops of blue lotus nectar.” Huang Xiaolong estimated happily.

In one day, he could roughly collect one hundred drops. With his strength, Huang Xiaolong was certain that he could stay inside there for ten days or more. Therefore, he was very confident that he would be able to collect more than one thousand drops. Of course, that was a safe estimation, and there was a possibility of him finding two thousand drops!

At the thought of this number, Huang Xiaolong even frightened himself.

Over a thousand drops of blue lotus nectar, ah!

At some top-tier creeds’ auctions which occasionally auctioned blue lotus nectar, one drop could fetch a hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins. If he took out everything he had collected to auction, wouldn’t that be several hundred million Tuoshen dao coins?!

Thinking of this, Huang Xiaolong’s heartbeat quickened.

Several hundred million Tuoshen dao coins! Not merely Tuoshen holy coins!

The amount of Tuoshen dao coins inside a creed like the Blue Heaven Creed’s treasury merely came up to ten million or so.

Even many creeds that were bigger than the Blue Heaven Creed would be hard-pressed to take out several hundred million Tuoshen dao coins!

A while later, Huang Xiaolong adjusted his excited heart and increased his speed. The first day passed quickly.

After looking at the one hundred and twenty-plus drops of blue lotus nectar suspended before him, Huang Xiaolong felt happy. This was his harvest on the first day.

The second, third, fourth day…

As the days passed, the amount of blue lotus nectar Huang Xiaolong obtained increased steadily.

While Huang Xiaolong was busy collecting blue lotus nectar, news traveled from disciples, who had entered the Blue Lotus Pond. “Dragon Fish Creed’s Yu Zhou got a drop of blue lotus nectar!”

“Blue Lotus Creed’s Yang Jia found a blue lotus leaf!”

As more news was brought out of the Blue Lotus Pond, the disciples waiting outside were amazed and envious at the same time.

Blue lotus leaves fell off when blue lotuses grew. Although their efficacy was less than a blue lotus, it was in the same grade as the blue lotus nectar.

The tenth day passed.

“Young Lady Yu Yue has got her first blue lotus!”

“Moreover, it’s a three-seed blue lotus!”

When the news spread out, the crowd of disciples around the Blue Lotus Pond was in a furor.

The Blue Lotus Pond had existed for billions of years, and only a hundred people or so had managed to pick blue lotuses, and every one of these one hundred-plus was a supreme existence and an outstanding genius. Every time someone successfully picked a blue lotus, the news would shake the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Now, one of the three moons, Yu Yue had successfully picked a blue lotus!

“Didn’t I say it early on that Young Lady Yu Yue would definitely find a blue lotus!”

“A three-seed blue lotus was rare even in the past!”
