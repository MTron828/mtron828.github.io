The next day, Huang Xiaolong’s group left the Stone Buddha City. Fortunately, they were able to travel back to the Ghost Manor without any incidents.

Huang Xiaolong wished to bid farewell to his Master Guo Yue before going back to the Vientiane World.

Gui Yue had safely retreated from the battle at Xiao City, after Huang Xiaolong and his group had escaped safely from that city. During the time Huang Xiaolong had been in seclusion, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others had been in contact with Gui Yue.

One thing was baffling Huang Xiaolong, since the time he had walked out from his seclusion at Stone Buddha City, ‘Even though he had been holding Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang hostage for a year, neither Xiao Family nor the Hundred Tribulations’ Factions had pursued him, how was that possible?’

...

Inside the Ghost Manor’s main hall, Gui Yue listed to Huang Xiaolong, as he explained to his Master that he wished to return to Vientiane World for the purpose of participating in the sea tribes’ God of the Sea Grand Ceremony. Gui Yue understood there were things Huang Xiaolong needed to take care of, thus, he did not ask Huang Xiaolong to stay back. On the other hand, he urged Huang Xiaolong to be careful, and visit him at the Ghost Manor whenever Huang Xiaolong could manage to do so.

Gui Yue was going to stay in the Odious Ghosts Forest for several hundred years, or at least, until his Poison of Thousand Corpses was completely cured. After all, this forest has been his old nest.

As they were talking, Gui Yue suddenly said, “These two, just release them.” He said as he pointed at Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised by Gui Yue’s request at first, but then nodded in agreement, “Alright, Master.”

He agreed because Gui Yue still needed to stay in the Clear Spirit World, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t want any deep grudges between Gui Yue and Xiao Family as well as the Hundred Tribulations Faction.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong decided to release Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang.

On that same day, Huang Xiaolong set off from the Ghost Manor, accompanied by Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San.

As for Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang, they were thrown on a random mountain at the edge of the Odious Ghosts Forest.

Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang tumbled and rolled down from the mountain peak to the foothills, before coming to a stop. Both of them were completely covered in dirt and dried leaves.

Finally, both of them struggled to their feet from the mossy ground, in a sorry state. By this time, Huang Xiaolong’s group was already on their way towards the transmission array to travel back to the Vientiane World. Xiao Zhangyu glared in the direction of Huang Xiaolong as he sped off. Extreme hatred and killing intent roiled and filled inside his heart. Finally it became so overwhelming that he couldn’t bear it anymore, and he screamed his lungs out, like an angry wounded beast.

“You dead punk, I, Xiao Zhangyu wants you dead! Die, die, die, die! No! I want you to feel pain a thousand times, a million times worse than death!” He shouted with every cell of his body, his voice shook the heavens.

Xiao Zhangyu’s deranged screams and shouts continued for a full hour, before they died down. This was a proof of his intense hatred and killing intent towards Huang Xiaolong. In fact, Chang Fang of Hundred Tribulations Faction had also screamed as maniacally as Xiao Zhangyu had done, with an equal amount of the surging killing intent.

“Brother Zhangyu, what should we do now?” Roughly an hour later, Chang Fang asked Xiao Zhangyu through gritted teeth.

Xiao Zhangyu inhaled deeply, “We return to Stone Buddha Mainland first. Let that dead punk live a few more days, while we send someone to check his identity. I want to know every single detail about him, including the eighteen generations of his ancestors!” Anger boiled inside his heart increasingly, the more he talked about this, “I want to squash everything of his to hell!”

“Go!” Xiao Zhangyu did not want to delay any further. Both he and Chang Fang left in a whistling winds.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong’s group was already out of the Odious Ghosts Forest. A day later, they arrived at the Clear Spirit World surface’s transmission array.

During this time, Xiao Family, Chen Family, and Ma Family’s disciples guards did not make things difficult for Huang Xiaolong’s group. Dazzling lights burst out from the transmission array, as it activated to send Huang Xiaolong’s group to Void Sky World, after Huang Xiaolong paid the required shenbi.

Since, it took three months to reach the Void Sky World, Huang Xiaolong was not idle inside the transmission array light tunnel. He took out Eidolon Crystalline Rocks and chaos spiritual pills and began refining them, entering cultivation.

Although it would be difficult for Huang Xiaolong to breakthrough to peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm before the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, he was confident that he could at least advance to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm by then.

Huang Xiaolong had refined these chaos spiritual pills in the Pill Blending Tower during his one year seclusion. He had used all of the chaos spiritual herbs and precious items from various treasuries and spatial rings into refining these chaos spiritual pills. However, Huang Xiaolong limited refining the chaos spiritual pills to three kinds, namely the Sky King Buddha Dragon Holy Pill, Dark Devil Sea Divine Pill, and Ninth-Layer Moon Tyrant Divine Pill.

Cultivating after swallowing these three kinds of divine pills was beneficial in improving Huang Xiaolong’s strength, True Dragon Physique, and also his soul.

At least, these three kinds of chaos spiritual pills were the most effective before Huang Xiaolong broke through to Ancestor God Realm. Each time, he would take out ten pellets of each kind of pills and consume them simultaneously.

When Huang Xiaolong was done refining the chaos spiritual pills, he would then refine the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks for a day before swallowing thirty chaos spiritual pills once more. He kept repeating this whole process.

Three months later, when they arrived at the Void Sky City’s transmission array, Huang Xiaolong had finally broken through to the late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. During this time, void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s strength had recovered at an alarming speed, and he had reached the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm.

The little cow’s strength improvement was also obvious. Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San’s strengths had also increased after Huang Xiaolong had given them one Eidolon Crystalline Rock and ten chaos spiritual pills each,. However, their improvements were not as significant and obvious as Huang Xiaolong, Xu Baisheng and the little cow.

This was mainly because it was impossible for high-level Ancestor God Realm cultivators like Feng Er, Gui Yi, and others to see such a significant increase in their strength in as short as one or two years.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath as he stepped out from the Void Sky City’s transmission array formation. He could sense the difference between the spiritual energy in Clear Spirit World and Void Sky World.

Now that he was back in the Void Sky World, the next thing on his to-do list was to pick up the Yellow Springs Magic Robe. Naturally, this was something that he would never forget.

Huang Xiaolong decided to stay in the Void Sky City for a day or two after getting the Yellow Springs Magic Robe, before continuing their journey back to the Vientiane World.

With this decided, Huang Xiaolong led Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and others straight to the Devil Prison Mountain.

The Devil Prison Mountain still stood tall in the Void Sky City, enshrouded by shocking corrosive devil qi. More cultivators had come to try their luck this year, as compared to a year before. This has happened, especially after the news of treasures being discovered had spread to the different parts of this world. Thus, battles and killings had grown increasingly, as various sects’ experts had begun to rob and steal from other cultivators.

Even the Ancestor God Realm masters had fallen during these battles. Although most of them who had died were First and Second Order Ancestor God Realm masters, the number of deaths was still alarming.

The conversations of passing cultivators fell on Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

“The Yellow Springs Archdevil’s treasury has actually appeared in the Devil Prison Mountain!”

“Yellow Springs Archdevil! Is it for real? How could the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s treasury appear in the Devil Prison Mountain?!”

“It’s a hundred percent correct information! I have also heard that the Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Virtual Returning Sect, and Yama Gates’ disciples have started killing each other for the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s treasures. But until now, none of them have been successful. Therefore, the three forces are going to send out a disciple each, to compete and decide the owner of the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s treasures!”

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly shocked when he heard that the Yellow Springs Archevil’s Treasury had been discovered! ‘Then, did the Yellow Springs Magic Robe fall into the hands of one of the three forces?’

“Master, don’t worry. Even if they have discovered the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasury, they won’t be able to open it without the key.” The void devil beast said. In a flash of light, he was holding a small axe in his paw. This axe was entirely black, and two words were inscribed it’s handle: Yellow Springs.
