All four mainlands’ forces had arrived at the square. The battle for which everyone had been waiting with anticipation was about to finally begin.

The four mainlands took turns to host the New Disciples Battle. During this term, it was the Fortune Gate’s turn to host, and the emcee was none other than Wang Shi.

Wang Shi stood up and after silently obtaining Golden Brow Ancestor’s permission, appeared on the battle stage at the center. He looked around and announced in a sonorous voice, "The four mainlands’ participants please come to the stage to draw lots!"

Huang Xiaolong, Zhou Xu, Tan Lin, Luo Yunjie, Wangu Ziyi, Wangu Dongchen, You Wuxin, and other participants all stepped out and landed on the center stage in a single leap.

Subsequently, the participants took turns to walk up to the assigned box and put their hands inside to draw a number.

A short while later, each of the participants held a numbered stick in their hands. Huang Xiaolong had gotten the stick with the number one inscribed on it!

He was one of the first participants to battle on the stage!

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, then a faint mocking smile lifted the corners of his mouth, thinking that his luck was ’quite good’ in getting the first match. He did not particularly take the scheme behind him getting the stick inscribed with the number one to his heart. For him, whether it was the first match or the last match made no difference.

In truth, he was looking forward to battle Wangu Ziyi in this first match.

But it seems like the heavens did not hear Huang Xiaolong’s wish, as the other person who drew stick inscribed with the number one was a disciple of Black Wind Cult from the Primal Chaos Mainland, named Gu Jiannan.

Gu Jiannan? Although Huang Xiaolong hadn’t paid much attention to the participants from the Primal Chaos Mainland, he had heard of Gu Jiannan because he was the Primal Chaos Mainland’s All-Islands Great War first place disciple!

First place disciple of Primal Chaos Mainland? Huang Xiaolong found this interesting and the smile on his face deepened.

The crowd was in an uproar when Wang Shi announced that the first match was between Huang Xiaolong and Gu Jiannan. The various sects’ experts were obviously excited.

It was very interesting that The Fortune Mainland’s number one champion was going to battle with the Primal Chaos Mainland’s number one champion.

Wangu Ziyi, Zhou Xu, and other participating disciples returned to their assigned viewing spots respectively. Only Huang Xiaolong and Gu Jianan stayed on the battle stage. Everyone’s gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong and Gu Jiannan..

“You guys say, who will win?”

“Of course it’s going to be Huang Xiaolong. Three years ago, Huang Xiaolong was still a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm when he defeated the early Third Order Ancient God Realm Zhou Xu. I have heard that two years ago Huang Xiaolong successfully broke through to peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm from peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm!”

“What? He broke through to peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm from peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm in one go? Impossible! This is definitely a rumor! Breaking through to peak mid-First Order Ancient God Realm is already hard to believe!”

Discussions waved through the crowd.

Huang Xiaolong and Gu Jiannan stood on the opposite sides from each other, without moving.

Gu Jiannan’s physique was on the smaller side, about five feet five inches tall, which was distinctly shorter compared to Huang Xiaolong’s five feet nine inches height. But Huang Xiaolong noticed Gu Jiannan’s palms and arms were thick and rough. Huang Xiaolong judged that Gu Jiannan must have cultivated similar technique to Hu Qi’s Divine Qilin Arms.

"This one is Black Wind Cult’s Gu Jiannan, please enlighten me." Gu Jiannan looked solemnly at Huang Xiaolong as he cupped his fists.

Huang Xiaolong was the popular choice for third place in this term of Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle and Gu Jiannan had heard of Huang Xiaolong’s extraordinary battle prowess. Huang Xiaolong was one of three people he was most unwilling to meet on the battle stage. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Fortune Gate’s Huang Xiaolong, please enlighten me." Huang Xiaolong returned the courtesy.

Just as Huang Xiaolong finished speaking, Gu Jiannan’s body suddenly enlarged. Right in front of everyone’s eyes, his five feet five inches tall figure doubled in size, becoming bigger and taller than five feet nine inches tall Huang Xiaolong. Black symbols filled the surface of his skin, especially on both of his arms, and the sleeves of his robe burst into fragments. Green veins bulged up under his skin as two black scorpions formed from the black symbols on his body.

This pair of scorpions were five to six times bigger than the regular scorpions. They were entirely greenish-black with lines of arresting red symbols on their backs.

“This is the Black Wind Cult’s Black Demon Poisonous Body; successful cultivation of this technique not only increases the cultivator’s defense, but their body also becomes poisonous from head to toe. In order to cultivate this Black Demon Poisonous Body, the cultivator requires to soak inside the toxic liquid for a long period of time, enduring the excruciating pain the whole time. An average person would find it very difficult to cultivate this technique successfully!”

"On his arms are the ancient poisonous green demon scorpions! Extremely toxic! Gu Jiannan actually managed to tame a pair of green demon scorpions!"

"The green demon scorpions had disappeared for several tens of thousands of years, right? Judging from the situation, it seems like these two green demon scorpions have completely integrated with Gu Jiannan’s Black Demon Poisonous Body. Even though Huang Xiaolong is stronger than Gu Jiannan, it is going to be a hard win for him against Gu Jiannan, given Gu Jiannan’s Black Demon Poisonous Body and two ancient green demon scorpions!"

"On top of that, Gu Jiannan has actually broken through to peak late-Third Order Ancient God Realm, just half a step more and he would breakthrough to Fourth Order Ancient God Realm!"

When Gu Jiannan exposed his Black Demon Poisonous Body and a pair of ancient green demon scorpions, the crowd was in a furor of excitement.

Below the battle stage, Tan Lin said to Zhou Xu via a voice transmission, "Huang Xiaolong won’t lose in the first round to Gu Jiannan, right? If that’s the case, we won’t be able to defeat him personally."

"I didn’t expect Gu Jiannan to be actually so strong. No wonder he can win the first place in the Primal Chaos Mainland." Zhou Xu frowned.

Even Zhou Xu himself did not have the confidence to defeat Gu Jiannan after seeing his Black Demon Poisonous Body and a pair of ancient green demon scorpions. His confidence was further affected as he also learned that Gu Jiannan had already broken through to peak late-Third Order Ancient God Realm.

On the Fortune Gate’s viewing stage, Black Ice Ancestor sneered coldly, "If Huang Xiaolong loses right in the first match, that’s going to be a big joke. Then he doesn’t humiliate just the Fortune Gate, but also the entire Fortune Gate Mainland. And if that happens, I will request the Sect Chief to revoke his Grand Elder benefits upon our return to the Fortune Gate!”

Blood Knife Ancestor was about to retort, when all of a sudden on the battle stage, Gu Jiannan attacked. He leaped into the air with both of his palms aimed at Huang Xiaolong.

Even before Gu Jiannan’s palm attacks reached Huang Xiaolong, something roiling and greenish black surged towards him. The pair of ancient green demon scorpions on Gu Jiannan’s arms flew out and landed in front of Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye. Soon after, two poisonous stings struck at Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Just as everyone thought Huang Xiaolong would retreat or dodge, a wooden sword appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. In the next moment, the crowd saw an extremely bright sword light flash across the air.

The two green demon scorpions screeched sharply as streaks of green-colored blood appeared on their backs and they tumbled backward. Gu Jiannan plummeted from high in the air, with blood spurting out from his chest.

The spectating experts saw that there were two long sword’s cuts starting from Gu Jiannan’s chest to his waist. Gu Jiannan was sucking.

The crowd fell into a heavy silence, experts sucking in a breath of cold air.

Gu Jiannan who had the Black Demon Poisonous Body and the two ancient poisonous green demon scorpions, along with being a peak late-Third Order Ancient God Realm master was defeated just like that!

What was that sword technique just now?!

Even Sky Sword Ancestor was stunned. He then turned to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, and said as he sighed, “Huang Xiaolong is actually the best candidate to inherit my legacy!”

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor merely chuckled.

“We don’t mind if you are willing to pass your Sky Sword inheritance to Xiaolong.” Blood Knife Ancestor laughed and said.

Myriad Flames Ancestor laughed hearing their conversation, “We have known that Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique is monstrous, but who’d have thought that his sword skill would be just as monstrous!” His words showed his appreciation for Huang Xiaolong.

Only Black Ice Ancestor’s old face was as cold as her name.

Blood Knife Ancestor’s gaze swept over Black Ice Ancestor’s face and he taunted, “Black Ice Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong won against the Primal Chaos Mainland’s Gu Jiannan in the first match, adding glory to our Fortune Gate, and it is the entire Fortune Mainland’s glory. When you return to the Fortune Gate, shouldn’t you request the Sect Chief to reward him?”
