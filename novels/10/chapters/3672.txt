Chapter 3673 – Sword Grave

Long after Huang Xiaolong and the rest disappeared, Yue Hong and the rest were still standing there, dumbfounded.

“This… Did we see wrong?” Yue Qing cried all of a sudden.

Yue Hong snorted angrily, “Enough! Even if you were mistaken, do you think we’re all blind?”

Yue Qing looked at his father who was on the verge of exploding and he whispered, “I… I just found it a little incredible!”

The three ghost kings were curious as well. From what they knew, the Supreme Ghost King Ship should only contain one of the four supreme experts.Why would it be taken by some nameless human?

“Something definitely happened…” Yue Hong frowned. “I’ll ask the rest of the ghost kings on the shore. Let’s see what they have to say.” He said before taking out the transmission symbol to contact the experts left behind.

He quickly received a reply.

When he read the report, Yue Hong felt his mind buzzing. An expression of disbelief formed on his face, and he failed to respond to the Green Winged Ghost King and Evil Dragon Ghost King calling him.

“Brother Yue, what happened?” Wei Guang used his grand cosmos energy to propel his yell and woke Yue Hong up.

Snapping back to reality, he handed over the transmission symbol to the two of them with his hands trembling.

The two of them raised their eyebrows in unison.

However, their expressions resembled Yue Hong after they read the report.

Fear and anxiousness filled their hearts.

“Father!” Yue Qing cried.

“Look at what you’ve done!” Yue Hong gave him a slap across the face, causing him to slam into the deck of the ship.

Yue Qing touched his swollen face and he looked at his father in disbelief. That was the angriest he had ever seen his father!

Ao Fangwu’s voice trembled at the side, “Who in the world is that young man?! Not even Senior Bing Yu is his match!”

Yue Qing’s eyes widened in fright.

He wondered if he heard wrong. From what Ao Fangwu said, the youngster snatched the Supreme Ghost King Ship from Senior Bing Yu!

“I heard that all of Senior Bing Yu’s subordinates were thrown into the river by the young man. Luckily for him, the Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu worked together to drag him out. He was the only one who survived in the exchange with the young man!” Yue Hong’s face turned as white as a sheet.

Initially, he planned to get rid of the human. If not for the appearance of the Ghost King Ship, he might have already…

“Father, what do we do now? Should we… Should we apologize and compensate the young man after reaching the other side? We’ll beg him to spare our lives!” Yue Qing panicked.

Yue Hong’s expression sank. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“No… Things aren’t as bad as they seem. Senior Bing Yu has already contacted Lord Yin Reversal Ghost King. I heard that Lord Yin Reversal is nearby and he’s rushing towards us as we speak. No matter how strong that brat is, he won’t be Lord Yin Reversal’s match!” Ao Fangwu muttered.

“Unless he’s an existence at the level of Lord Gui Chi…” Wei Guang frowned. “However, it’s impossible for him to be that strong! Existences at that level can be counted on both hands in the entire Unknown Lands…”

…

Even though the Supreme Ghost King Ship moved terrifyingly quickly, they needed half a day to arrive on the other side.

In the half a day, Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the various secret arts he had seen.

Jiang Dacheng behaved cautiously at the side.

“This cultivation technique seems suitable for you. Take a look.” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden before handing a manual over.

Receiving it carefully, Jiang Dacheng gasped in fright, “First Heaven Sword Manual?”

“This… Is this the sword manual produced by Tian Yi Ghost King?!”

Tian Yi Ghost King was a supreme expert of the Green Ghost Lands! He was comparable to Wu Zun and could be said to be slightly stronger than Bing Yu!

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. He could see that Jiang Dacheng’s talent in the way of the sword was pretty impressive. The First Heaven Sword Manual was perfect for him.

The reason he didn’t share Jian Wushuang’s sword manual was because the principle behind it was too profound. Even if he gave it to Jiang Dacheng, he might not be able to comprehend anything.

“Thank you, Lord!” Jiang Dacheng kowtowed before Huang Xiaolong. He knew that he had chosen to stand on the correct side this time.

“Get up.” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “This is an opportunity for you too.”

Jiang Dacheng kowtowed another time before finally getting to his feet.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong took out several peak-grade grand dao pills and handed them to Jiang Dacheng to assist in his cultivation.

Half a day later…

They arrived on the other side of the Yin Ghost River and disembarked.

The Supreme Ghost King Ship remained in place after they left. One month later, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng would have to return on it before the river started to drain. If that happened, they would be trapped until the river filled up again.

Once the Yin Ghost River ran dry, the side of the river they were on would fill up with poison mist. It could cause people to lose control of themselves, and even half-step Universe Gods wouldn’t be able to protect themselves! They would turn into a yin spirit after their souls were corrupted.

As such, anyone who didn’t leave the island before the river ran dry again would face death.

“Lord, should we go to the Enlightenment Mountain now?” Jiang Dacheng asked.

“There’s no need to rush. Since we have to cross through the Sword Grave to get there, we can explore the area first.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “The Enlightenment Mountain isn’t too far away.”

In order to arrive at the Sword Grave, the two of them would need several hours. The Enlightenment Mountain was three days away and the journey there was fraught with dangers!

They needed to cross through ten different tribulations in order to get there!

The two of them made their way over to the Sword Grave without the slightest delay.

Not too long after they left, another Ghost King Ship arrived. The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu disembarked with the rest of their subordinates.

The three of them wanted to take their own ship, but Huang Xiaolong’s appearance caused them to feel slightly threatened.

“We don’t know where they went…” Jiu Yu muttered.

“If Lord Gui Chi came, we wouldn’t be afraid of him!” Wu Zun growled. “Whatever. I’m going to find myself a good sword after going to the Enlightenment Mountain!”

“It’s along our way… We’ll go to the Sword Grave first.” The Nether Yang King made the decision for them.
