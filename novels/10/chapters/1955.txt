Huang Xiaolong knew that even if they managed to locate the other half of the inheritance, they would never be able to refine it. After all, the key to the other gate of the Heavenly Hall was in his hand!

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Radiance Divine Scepter, and he looked at the gentle and pure light it emitted. Huang Xiaolong was immersed in it.

The Radiance Divine Scepter was precisely the key they needed to open the gate of the other half of the Heavenly Hall. Without the Radiance Divine Scepter, Dun Ei and Lan Zhi would only be able to squat at the other half of the Heavenly Hall’s entrance.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong could already picture the scene where Dun Ei and Lan Zhi tried bombarding the Heavenly Hall’s entrance, only to realize that they were unable to enter.

“Xiaolong, is your master, the King of Grandmist, very strict with you?” Shi Xiaofei slowly approached Huang Xiaolong from the back as her gentle voice resounded through the air.

All of a sudden, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others appeared.

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao felt their hearts pounding at an astonishing rate when they thought about how they were going to meet the King of Grandmist. That’s the King of Grandmist they were talking about! The master of the publicly acknowledged number one expert of the Divine World, the Grandmist Emperor, and Huang Xiaolong!

Even though they had already seen the King of Grandmist during the Battle of the Heavenly Court, they hadn’t interacted with him!

Huang Xiaolong turned around and chuckled, “Relax. The old man is pretty laid back. He treats everyone nicely as well... Just pretend he’s an ordinary grandpa.”

Everyone’s jaw dropped in shock.

Cold sweat formed on Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan’s forehead. Only Huang Xiaolong can call the King of Grandmist, ‘an old man’ in the myriad of worlds.

Ordinary grandpa?! If the King of Grandmist was an ordinary grandpa, what would they be?!

“Xiaolong, when we arrive at the Grandmist Lands, are you going to head over to the Radiance World?!” Su Yan asked.

Knowing that his mother was concerned about him, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Don’t worry! Nothing will happen to me.”

Su Yan opened her mouth, but no words came out. She contemplated for a long time before nodding her head. “Take care of yourself.”

“Of course.” A solemn expression appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he nodded his head. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Regardless of one’s identity and strength, one would always be a little child in their parent’s mind. Huang Xiaolong was no different. Even though he had rampaged around the various big words for several hundred years, Huang Xiaolong knew that Su Yan was merely worried about him.

“Uncle, is the Radiance World fun?! Why don’t you bring us along?” Guo Xiaofan piped up all of a sudden. “I really want to see the Radiance World too! Not to mention the fact that you just reunited with my aunt! Are you really going to leave us?”

Huang Xiaolong nearly roared with laughter, but he held back and chided Guo Xiaofan, “Do you think that I’m going to the Radiance World for fun? I’m going to pick a fight with the ruler of the Radiance World! If you can block the energy coming from his pinkie, I’ll bring you with me.”

Guo Xiaofan widened his eyes in shock.

The energy from the ruler of the Radiance World’s pinkie!

In the next instant, the look on Guo Xiaofan’s face changed. He muttered, “Nevermind then...”

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the anxious look on Shi Xiaofei’s face, he grabbed her hands and explained, “I won’t be gone for too long. When I come back, I’ll bring you to anywhere you want.”

Shi Xiaofei nodded her head slowly, and she said, “Alright. When we arrive at the Grandmist Lands, I will try my best to cultivate. I shall wait for you to return.”

Half a month later...

They arrived at the Darkness Galaxy.

Through the clear walls of the control room, everyone saw the desolate and horrifying galaxy that was completely dark before them, and they sucked in a cold breath of air.

“That’s the Darkness Galaxy. After we cross this, we’ll arrive at the Desolate World. We’ll arrive at the Grandmist Lands after that,” Huang Xiaolong explained.

This was the second time he went to the Grandmist Lands. When he looked into the space outside the ship, he couldn’t help but think of the first time he went to the Grandmist Lands. He was together with his senior brother, Jiang Hong, and at that time, he was a mere God King Realm expert. Right now, he was already an Emperor Realm expert.

After two hours, the Netherking Flying Ship crossed the Darkness Galaxy and appeared in the space above the Desolate World.

Initially, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship had taken half a month to cross the galaxy. The Netherking Flying Ship took a mere two hours.

When they arrived in the space above the Desolate World, Huang Xiaolong decided to bring everyone to the land of inheritance of the Black Dragon Clan.

Ever since he had obtained the three Black Dragon Treasures from their land of inheritance, Huang Xiaolong had developed some feelings for the World.

After they took a tour around the world surface, Huang Xiaolong and the others finally left for the Grandmist Galaxy.

Looking at the resplendent galaxy before them, everyone in the Huang Family gasped in shock. Their reactions were the same as when Huang Xiaolonhg had first visited the Grandmist Lands.

“This is the Grandmist Galaxy.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “The Grandmist Galaxy used to be like the Darkness Galaxy, filled with nothing but frigid qi. After billions of years of effort by my master, he managed to reshape the entire galaxy.”

“Billions of years!” Shi Xiaofei, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others gasped in shock.

“Those are Starfall Stones. My master used a lot of effort to gather them from many different worlds. There are a total of one million Starfall stones and every single one has been inscribed with grandmist formations. Even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert would be blown to nothingness if he tried to barge into the Grandmist Galaxy.” Huang Xiaolong pointed at one of the Starfall Stones located in the space outside the flying ship.

Huang Xiaolong’s explanation and introduction drew the attention of everyone on the flying ship. Half an hour passed before they knew it and a brilliant continent appeared in the space before them.

Looking at the fantastic and well thought out decorations on the continent and the spirit fruits that exuded a mesmerizing radiance, everyone felt their jaws dropping to the ground. There were countless spirit beasts running about and tons of chaos crystals lying about on the continent.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Let’s head inside. We are almost at the Grandmist Lands.”

Huang Xiaolong kept the Netherking Flying Ship and flew towards the Grandmist Lands with the others in tow.

When they arrived, everyone could feel the astonishing concentration of spirit qi in the air. It was as though they had walked into a holy land they could only dream of.

A yellow shadow flew towards Huang Xiaolong, and everyone was stunned at its sudden appearance. Despite its sudden appearance, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Little bear, long time no see!”

The yellow figure was precisely the Earth Bear Huang Xiaolong had saved in the past. In order to save it from Grand Elder Wu Tian from the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong had met with all sorts of trouble.

“Big brother, are you here to look for the grandpa or me?!” The little bear stared at Huang Xiaolong with shining eyes.

“I’m here to look for both of you.” He reached out to stroke the little bear’s soft fur. He could feel that the little bear’s strength had improved tremendously after more than a hundred years of cultivation in the Grandmist Lands. After the nourishment from the spirit qi in the Grandmist Lands, the little bear looked even more adorable than before.

When everyone saw the cute little bear in Huang Xiaolong’s arms, they couldn’t help but feel their hearts melting. Shi Xiaofei, Peng Xiao, and the other ladies rushed up to Huang Xiaolong, and they reached out to play with the little bear.

“Big brother, are they all your women?!” The little bear asked with an innocent expression on its face. “They are so pretty!”

Shi Xiaofei, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao felt their faces flushing red. It was mostly so for Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan.

Cold sweat formed on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

Before long, a group of people flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s group.

The playful look on Huang Xiaolong’s face changed as he turned to look at the others. “Master is here. Let’s head on over to greet Master.”

The man in the lead of the incoming group was an old man who looked to be in his seventies. His eyes shone like stars, and there was a short stubble on his face. It was precisely the King of Grandmist himself.

When everyone heard that the King of Grandmist was about to arrive, they didn’t dare to dally as they flew behind Huang Xiaolong.
