Everyone burst into joyous laughter when they heard Huang Xiaolong say that they were all going together to Martial Spirit World, especially the two younger ones. Guo Xiaofan and Heaven Devouring Beast Lil’ Tian whooped in delight.

Though the Black Warrior Institute was a hundred, even a thousand times better than Martial Spirit World, to these people, the Martial Spirit World was their root, the home and native land in their hearts.

Watching Guo Xiaofan and Lil’ Tian cheering, as well as the happy faces around him, a smile spread over Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Everyone got busy preparing. In fact, there wasn’t much to prepare.

Inside Huang Xiaolong’s spatial ring were numerous spirit pellets and spirit stones from saint and divine to sacred grade. Everything anyone could need or want was there, even divine armors, alchemy ingredients, and forging materials were piled mountain high.

Xuanwu coins were the least of their worries as the supply stretched like a vast sea.

Even Huang Peng, Su Yan, Shi Xiaofei, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and several others’ spatial rings contained a great wealth of spirit pellets, spirit stones, and herb elixirs.

Their group did not include everyone on the Golden Dragon Peak; for this trip back to Martial Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong decided to bring no more than thirty people—his immediate Huang Family, adding Shi Xiaofei, Blessed Buddha Emperor and his Empress, Xie Puti, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, Lil’ Tian, Violet Spirit Devour Monkey Huang Xiaoyong, and a few more people.

In the last five years, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and those at Tenth Order Saint realm had all broken through to God Realm, becoming First Order God Realm masters. Shi Xiaofei, on the other hand, was a mid-Fourth Order God Realm.

The Blessed Buddha Emperor, Xie Puti, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu’s strength also greatly improved.

Just like the last time Huang Xiaolong returned to Martial Spirit World, their group used the Cloudsea Mainland transmission array to reach the Cosmos World surface, and from there they transferred to the Guoer World. After transferring more than a dozen times, they reached the Iron Radix World surface, the closest to Martial Spirit World that had a transmission array.

In his previous journey, Huang Xiaolong was rushing back to Martial Spirit World with his Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun and Third Apprentice-sister Qi Wen. At that time, from the mouth of Sin City Castellan’s son, Zhao Chen, Huang Xiaolong found out that his family, who was still in the Martial Spirit World, was in danger.

However, this time, the trip proceeded at a leisurely pace. Along the way, they would stop for a few days to rest, play and shop on the world surface they were passing through.

Hence, by the time Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Iron Radix World, more than one and a half months had passed since they departed from the Black Warrior Institute.

Once the group reached the Iron Radix World, they only had a short distance left to travel, taking less than a day’s time to reach Martial Spirit World. Their flying speed increased while riding on the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger and other beast mounts that Huang Xiaolong captured from the Great Wasteland.

“We’re finally back in the Martial Spirit World!” After more than a month, everyone stood in the vast space, looking at the Martial Spirit World ‘hanging in space’ before them, joy spread over their faces.

Guo Xiaofan and Lil’ Tian were jumping with excitement, they were the first ones to dive in, breaking past Martial Spirit World’s natural outer barrier.

Shi Xiaofei laughed happily watching these two.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, laughing, ‘These little ones...’

“Father, Mother, let us go too.” Huang Xiaolong said to Huang Peng and Su Yan.

Huang Peng and Su Yan both nodded with a smile, “Yes.”

With that said, the remaining people also dove into the chaotic layer on the outermost part of Martial Spirit World’s natural barrier.

Both Huang Peng and Su Yan sighed inwardly. When they left Martial Spirit World years ago, neither of them was a Xiantian realm expert, but now, they were already God Realm masters!

This was something they dared not even dream about.

God Realm!

Even those monstrous geniuses of super forces backed by enormous wealth and resources couldn’t compare with Huang Peng and Su Yan’s group in terms of cultivation speed. Advancing from a Houtian warrior to God Realm master in less than a hundred years, this was something that had never been heard of before!

However, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and those who followed Huang Xiaolong from Martial Spirit World cultivated by consuming large amounts of sacred grade divine pellets. On top of that, they were supported by the overflowing rich spiritual energy on the Golden Dragon Peak that was restructured by Ascending Moon Old Man, Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang, and Huang Xiaolong himself. Last but not least, they even had the tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets refined by Huang Xiaolong.

Therefore, it would hard for these people’s cultivation speed not to be shocking.

No matter how these galaxies’ super forces nurtured their geniuses, they couldn’t and wouldn’t provide a nearly endless supply of Exalted Divinity Pellets for their cultivation. It was even more impossible to get their hands on tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Because, in the four galaxies, only Huang Xiaolong alone was capable of refining tribulation grade Exalted Divinity Pellets!

Not to mention, Exalted Divinity Pellets were something that even Highgod Realm masters coveted. Even if a family possessed them, they wouldn’t distribute them to the younger generation.

While Huang Peng and the others were feeling nostalgic about their transformations in recent years, the surrounding scenery changed as they came out from the chaotic barrier, appearing in high air.

“Martial Spirit World, I, Guo Xiaofan, have returned~~~!” Guo Xiaofan’s loud shout reverberated in the air, the shockwave pushing away the nearby white clouds.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, and everyone else smiled watching Guo Xiaofan’s antics.

Huang Xiaolong, however, frowned the moment he entered the Martial Spirit World. Although the Huang Family members did not sense anything odd in particular, Huang Xiaolong keenly noticed obvious differences in the environment compared to the last time he was here.

Right now, he clearly felt that Martial Spirit World’s spiritual energy flow had become chaotic. A piercing light flickered in Huang Xiaolong eyes.

“Xiaolong, is something the matter?” Shi Xiaofei asked. Standing beside Huang Xiaolong, she immediately felt the sharp aura from Huang Xiaolong’s body for a brief moment.

Not wanting to alarm anyone, Huang Xiaolong shook his head: “Nothing.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s answer, Shi Xiaofei tactfully refrained from asking further questions but reached out to hold Huang Xiaolong’s hand. At this point, she too had felt the changes in the Martial Spirit World’s environment.

Huang Peng and the rest remained in the dark, laughing cheerfully as they flew in the direction of Snow Wind Continent.

One hour later, the group spotted land—the Snow Wind Continent.

But when Huang Peng and everyone else reached the edge of the Duanren Empire’s territory, all they saw was a stark and devastated landscape. The land itself was emitting an aura of despair. This sight made everyone frown deeply.

“What happened?! I remember this location to be Emerald Jade Mountain, why has it turned into this?” Huang Xiaohai exclaimed in disbelief.

Emerald Jade Mountain was a scenic spot in Duanren Empire famous for its captivating scenery, lush age-old ancient trees, and herbs that grew aplenty. A paradise for small animals and beasts alike. But what were they looking at now?!

Lifeless, barren land! Herbs? There wasn’t even a single weed in sight.

The small villages that used to be around the Emerald Jade Mountain were abandoned, not a single shadow could be seen, it was more like a piece of dead land.

Huang Xiaolong’s face turned grim, speaking to everyone: “Let’s head to Duanren Imperial City!” He shot forward, and others quickly followed behind him.

By this point, even the Huang Family members could see that something was wrong with Martial Spirit World. The cheerful atmosphere earlier was buried under worry, no one was in the mood to talk and joke anymore.

When the Duanren Emperor left with Huang Xiaolong, he passed the throne to his son. Duan Wuhen would not allow anyone to exploit the Emerald Jade Mountain to this degree.

Then, could something have happened to Duan Wuhen and the Duanren Empire?
