Chapter 2704: Yin Borer City!

When She Mu was staring at Long Jianfei’s back in a daze, Yun Bitian roared at Huang Xiaolong, “Little brat, hurry up and apologize to Grand Patriarch She Mu!”

Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, Zi Dongping, Jiang Heng, and the others slowly turned around.

She Mu finally saw Long Jianfei’s face!

Feeling as though a lightning bolt had slammed into his mind, She Mu’s body trembled violently.

Yun Ke’er didn’t manage to see She Mu’s expression, and she couldn’t help but rage when she saw that Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of apologizing. “Do you know that Grand Patriarch She Mu is the Patriarch of the Golden Dragonhorse Race in the World River?! Even Chen Luo will have to kneel before him!”

She was afraid that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t know who She Mu was, or the existence of the Golden Dragonhorse Race. Since the Chen Luo Sect was the number one power of the humans, Huang Xiaolong had to know them, right?

She was thinking that Huang Xiaolong’s expression would change, and he would jump up in fright, when a loud thud rang through the hall. She Mu fell to his knees, facing Huang Xiaolong.

No, it was more accurate to say that he was kneeling towards Long Jianfei!

Since he didn’t cushion his fall or control his body when kneeling, the ground trembled a little and the members of the Rising Clouds Commerce were shocked by his sudden change in attitude. Even the experts sitting around the hall couldn’t help but stare at She Mu in shock.

“Is that the Grand Patriarch of the Golden Dragonhorse Race?!”

“It seems like it!”

As the patriarch of one of the top races in the World River, he was pretty well known. There were quite a lot of people who could recognize him.

When they saw She Mu getting on his knees, they couldn’t help but feel their jaws dropping in shock.

“Grand Patriarch She Mu, this…” Yun Bitian jumped in fright, and he wanted to help She Mu to his feet. He didn’t manage to understand what went down.

Ignoring Yun Bitian’s attempts to help him up, She Mu started crawling towards Long Jianfei with a terrified expression hanging on his face. Trepidation gripped his heart and there were no other emotions left in his heart other than complete and utter fear for Long Jianfei.

The members of the Rising Clouds Commerce stared at the scene before them, wide-eyed.

Of course, the only exception was Yun Fang’er.

As for the two experts from the Golden Dragonhorse Race, who were following behind She Mu, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“She Mu greets Lord Long!” As he slammed his forehead into the ground in a massive kowtow, She Mu’s face stuck to the ground. With the mucus streaming out from his nose, a puddle formed under his face.

His body trembled uncontrollably as he could sense the anger radiating from Long Jianfei!

The ancestor of the Dragon Fish Race was about to blow!

He didn’t dare to mention Long Jianfei’s full name, and he addressed the man as respectfully as he could without revealing his identity. After all, if he casually revealed the identity of the Dragon Fish Race’s ancestor, Long Jianfei might actually blow.

Yun Bitian and Yun Ke’er stared at She Mu with a dumbfounded expression.

How could this be?!

Isn’t that person a mere human?

Why would Grand Patriarch She Mu kneel to a human’s subordinate?! Moreover, he even addressed the man as ‘lord’!

This…

Everything that happened had already exceeded the scope of their comprehension.

Of course, another thought that flashed in Yun Bitian’s head was his second daughter, Yun Fang’er! How did she make a friend like this?! He subconsciously turned to look at his second daughter.

In the entire hall, the only person not on Huang Xiaolong’s side, who wasn’t surprised at the outcome, was Yun Fanger!

She Mu kneeled on the ground as he slowly raised his head to look at Long Jianfei.

A cold voice rang through the hall all of a sudden, and surprisingly, Long Jianfei wasn’t the one who spoke! “Cut off your right arm.”

No one knew how to react.

When She Mu heard the unfamiliar voice, he couldn’t help but turn to look at Huang Xiaolong. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The person who spoke was obviously Huang Xiaolong, and he wanted She Mu to leave behind the hand he touched Yun Fanger with.

Upon seeing how She Mu was hesitating, Long Jianfei snorted, “Are you deaf? Didn’t you hear what my Young Lord said?!”

Young Lord?!

She Mu, who was still pondering over Huang Xiaolong’s identity, felt his mind go blank once again. Beads of cold sweat started forming on his forehead.

“Yes, yes! I know what to do!” Without hesitation, his left hand formed a blade to chop down on his right arm.

As the arm fell, Yun Fanger felt her heart trembling as the other members of the Rising Clouds Commerce stared at She Mu in shock. Other people might not know the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s order, but Yun Fanger knew that he was doing it for her.

When She Mu sliced off his right arm, he didn’t dare to use his energy to stop the bleeding.

As he kneeled obediently before Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei, fear filled his heart. He replayed the scene of Long Jianfei calling Huang Xiaolong ‘young lord’ in his mind over and over again.

“I wasn’t planning on interfering with the matters of the Rising Clouds Commerce. But she is my friend.”

She Mu raised his head and looked at Yun Fanger.

In fact, everyone present turned to look at her.

She Mu finally realized the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s order.

After getting over his shock, She Mu crawled over to Yun Fanger and apologized profusely. He knew that as long as she didn’t forgive him, he might have to leave his life behind. The only way he could live was for this young lady to plead for mercy on his behalf.

Just a moment ago, the Rising Clouds Commerce was begging him for help. In the blink of an eye, he was the one begging them to forgive him. Yun Fanger didn’t know how to react, and she felt extremely conflicted.

Under Yun Bitian’s urgings, Yun Fanger finally forgave She Mu.

Seeing as Yun Fang’er didn’t plan to blow the matter up, and that She Mu was one of Long Jianfei’s subordinates, Huang Xiaolong felt that it wouldn’t be right for him to dole out the punishment. Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was planning to leave the man’s punishment up to him, Long Jianfei felt grateful. After all, She Mu was someone who worked for him. Even though he wouldn’t kill the man on the spot, he knew what to do. Sending She Mu away, Long Jianfei told him to be prepared for punishment.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to harp on the matter, She Mu still had to be punished.

When She Mu heard that he was pardoned, he couldn’t help but thank Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei profusely. Bringing his subordinates along with him, he left the pavilion in haste.

When She Mu was gone, Yun Bitian stood in the middle of the hall, not knowing what to do. He wanted to head over to greet Huang Xiaolong, but he didn’t dare to make the first move. Turning to Yun Fanger, he pleaded with her with his gaze to do the introductions.

However, Huang Xiaolong shook his head silently while looking at her.

A wave of disappointment filled her heart. She knew that her father and sister’s actions had angered Huang Xiaolong.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong and the others wrapped it up and returned to their courtyard.

The night passed uneventfully, and the next day, they left the city. On the night of the next day, they arrived at the Yin Borer City.

As soon as he arrived, Yin Ming received the news of their arrival, and he sent a group of men over to ‘welcome’ Huang Xiaolong’s party.
