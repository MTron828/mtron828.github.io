As a late Emperor Realm expert, Zhou Chen’s aura was terrifying as he appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong instantly.

“Brat, hand over your Seed of Enlightenment!” Zhou Chen glared at Huang Xiaolong with fire in his eyes.

Looking at Zhou Chen, who was charging at Huang Xiaolong, one of the four odd beasts moved. As its body blurred, it arrived between Huang Xiaolong and Zhou Chen.

Zhou Chen widened his eyes when he saw the beast that blocked his path.

Following this, the odd beast raised its right hand and stretched out its palm.

“Scram!” Zhou Chen yelled with fury. He couldn’t believe that someone would block his way when he was about to obtain the Seed of Enlightenment. Circulating all the godforce in his body, he slapped out at the beast.

Their palms collided.

“Kacha!”

The sound of broken bones resounded through the air, and Zhou Chen let out a miserable shriek as he smashed into the wall behind him. Like Sun Shihai, he emerged from the other side of the wall before falling to the ground outside.

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Before Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao could even warn Huang Xiaolong about Zhou Chen, he was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong’s beast.

The two of them stared blankly at Zhou Chen, who was thrown outside.

This... was this really the Ancestor Zhou Chen they knew?!

This scene was even more shocking than when Huang Xiaolong had sent Sun Shihai flying.

Even Li Shan, Chen Yirong, and the men in black were dumbfounded.

The hall master of the punishment hall, Gong Sunchi, felt light-headed.

A while later, everyone regained their senses, and their gazes landed on the odd beast.

“Huang Xiaolong, no wonder you have the guts to return. You even dare to show off all your treasures...” Special Envoy He broke the silence and said, “Is that beast of yours in the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm?!”

A bright gleam flashed through his eyes as he stared at the beast with a grave expression.

Even though Zhou Chen was just an ordinary high-level Emperor, a regular Eighth Order Emperor Realm Expert couldn’t injure him with a single move.

When the beast unleashed its attack, the aura it emitted made them wary. They felt slightly threatened by its strength.

For them to feel danger, their opponent had to be in the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!

“What?!”

“Late-Tenth Order Emperor?!”

Li Shan, Chen Yirong, Gong Sunchi, and the others exclaimed in horror.

Initially, they had thought that the strongest Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates would be the Ninth Order Emperor Realm. Never in their wildest imaginations would they have believed that the beast was a late-Tenth Order Emperor!

Nobody doubted the words of Special Envoy! All of them knew he was a supreme existence in the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!

Even Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao were dumbfounded when they heard what Special Envoy He said.

“Is it really a late-Tenth Order Realm expert?” Fang Xuanxuan muttered.

Nobody had paid any attention to the four beasts following behind Huang Xiaolong when he had walked in.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Special Envoy He and said with indifference, “Are you from the Fiend God Emperor Palace?”

Special Envoy He secretly crushed a jade talisman as he smiled, “What Fiend God Emperor Palace? I’m just a grand elder that Zhou Chen invited to the Fortune Emperor Palace to take charge of the discipline and security.”

Huang Xiaolong sensed a slight spatial fluctuation the moment Special Envoy He crushed the jade talisman.

He sneered in his heart. It looks like he is trying to call for reinforcement.

However, this was exactly what Huang Xiaolong wanted.

Sure enough, space started to fluctuate as a group of men clad in black appeared before everyone.

Like before, another group of ten appeared.

Looking at this group of men in black, Special Envoy He calmed down.

“Special Envoy Chen.” He greeted as his gaze landed on one of the men inside the group.

Special Envoy Chen nodded his head and acknowledged.

“Be careful, that monster is in the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. The other three might be as well.” Special Envoy He reminded.

It was precisely because he was afraid of the four monsters behind Huang Xiaolong that he called Special Envoy Chen and the rest over. He was worried that all of them were in the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

“What?!” The men in black, who were called over, were shocked as they stared at the four odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong.

When they were summoned, they had felt that Special Envoy He was making a mountain out of a molehill. However, that didn’t seem to be the case.

Special Envoy Chen’s expression turned grave.

However, even if the four odd beasts were late-Tenth Order Emperors, they were extremely confident that the Ancient Slaughtering Array would take care of them. Unless they had surpassed the Emperor Realm, there was absolutely no way for them to escape from it.

“Set up the array!”

Suddenly, both Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen shouted out in unison.

Nearly thirty over high-level Emperor Realm experts shot to the sky and formed the array. A type of chaotic and desolate aura was released from the middle of the array and enveloped the entire hall.

“Divine Desolate Glory Array!”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised that they knew about this array. The Divine Desolate Glory Array was an Ancient Slaughtering Array from Hell and was extremely powerful.

The men in black were surprised that Huang Xiaolong recognized the Divine Desolate Glory Array with a single glance, and they chuckled, “Huang Xiaolong, you have pretty good eyes to be able to recognize our Divine Desolate Glory Array. Since you know about the Divine Desolate Glory Array, you should also know that no one under the Emperor Realm would be able to escape. You should stop struggling now.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled indifferently, “Is that so?”

“Xiaolong, don’t care about us, hurry up and escape!” Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao screamed.

At this moment, the four odd beasts made their move. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Roar!”

Their earth-shaking roar echoed through the air and spread across millions upon millions of miles.

The four odd beasts returned to their original forms, and four massive giants, thousands of miles tall, appeared. A horrifying aura filled the area, and a type of fierce, brutal, bloody, dark, and terrifying energy poured out from their body.

Everyone felt suffocated when the energy appeared, and Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen were not exempted.

All the faces of the men in black changed drastically.

“This... could it be them? No... this!” The voices of Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen trembled uncontrollably.

“Roar!!!”

The four beasts grew larger by ten folds, and they smashed through the ceiling of the palace. No longer holding anything back, the aura around them grew endlessly.

Gong Sunchi and several hall masters fainted in an instant.

Even Li Shan and Chen Yirong felt as if they were crushed to death by the beasts’ pressure.
