Chapter 2995: You Won’t be Able to Leave the Holy Dragon World

As the beam of energy transformed into massive dragons that flew towards Huang Xiaolong and the Tortoise Ancestor, they formed a massive river that threatened to swallow them whole! As the terrifying wave of dragon qi swept through the lands, the skies started to shake, and the weaker disciples who failed to escape from their countries located in the Six Vision Sacred Land felt as though the world was ending.

Every single dragon contained the power to send a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable flying. As the dragons started to gather, they emitted a terrifying pressure. If a single dragon was compared to a bullet, there were several million dragons charging towards Huang Xiaolong. The might of a single bullet might not be able to blow through a solid wall, but what if there were ten thousand of them? What if there were millions of them shooting at the same spot?

As the roars of dragons filled the region all around them, soundwaves that contained endless power sent Primal Ancestor Realm experts reeling as they spat mouthfuls of blood.

A pillar of light pierced through the skies of the Six Vision Sacred Land as the final form of the Coiled Dragon arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

Right before it could slam into the platform, the house-sized Tortoise Ancestor started his transformation, and his body became larger than the original Soaring Dragon Mountain Range. He was like a massive continent hovering in the skies. As his body started to expand to cover the kingdoms all around, the skies seemed to turn completely dark.

The Six Vision Sacred Land was the home of several hundred thousand kingdoms, but the Tortoise Ancestor expanded to the size of nearly half the Six Vision Sacred Land!

The elders of the various races felt their hearts pounding when they felt the aura coming from the Tortoise Ancestor. It was something they couldn’t forget as long as they lived, and it was something that brought them unprecedented fear.

“This!” Ao Bi sucked in a cold breath. He stared at the Tortoise Ancestor's foot, which was larger than the size of a mountain before him, and he tried to look for the end of the tortoiseshell.

“Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable!” someone in the crowd screamed.

Previously, they had suspected that the Tortoise Ancestor was a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and now, they were sure of it!

Only Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables could exude such strength!

“Ultimate Suppression!” A cold voice rang through the skies, and everyone stared on as black and green light emerged from the tortoiseshell. The Tortoise Ancestor started to fall from the skies, and a horrifying pressure none of them had ever felt in their lives descended on them. With his body as his weapon, the Tortoise Ancestor planned to crush everything in his way!

Since the Tortoise Ancestor was a creature born during the world's creation, its body was an invincible existence. It was stronger than peak-grade cosmos artifacts, and with his cultivation at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, he came crashing downwards. Everyone who stood in the crowd felt as though the world was crumbling, and they were the tiny ants standing in the path of sheer destruction.

The feeling they felt wasn’t an illusion. The Tortoise Ancestor was stronger than they could imagine, and when he fell, the Six Vision Sacred Land sank several dozen feet in space!

When he smashed into the Coiled Dragon Grand Formation, it came as no surprise when the formation exploded into a million pieces. The dragon qi that filled the earth moments ago dissipated as the Tortoise Ancestor continued downwards towards the Coiled Dragon Flying Ship.

The faces of everyone from the Coiled Dragon Race changed.

When the members of the various dragon races around felt the crushing pressure coming from the Tortoise Ancestor, they felt overwhelmed. However, the members of the Coiled Dragon Race felt even worse as they bore the brunt of the pressure. A sense of hopelessness appeared on their faces when they realized they were nothing more than a cockroach sitting along the Tortoise Ancestor’s path of destruction.

“Use everything you have to activate the grand formation on the flying ship!” Ao Shiming screamed.

As rays of light emerged from the ship, they did nothing to stop the Tortoise Ancestor’s descent. No matter what technique or formation they used, the Tortoise Ancestor crushed their hopes and dreams with sheer force alone.

Boom!

Under the terrified gazes of everyone present, the Tortoise Ancestor slammed into the Coiled Dragon Flying Ship. The cracking sound filled the skies and it broke into a thousand pieces as the remains flew into the crowd.

When the Coiled Dragon Flying Ship made its first appearance, everyone was awed by its majestic presence. However, it was nothing compared to the Tortoise Ancestor’s true body!

Along with the destruction of the Coiled Dragon Flying Ship, miserable shrieks filled the skies. Bloody mist emerged in the skies as they shined an eerie golden light in the eyes of many.

Other than the nine grand ancestors of the Coiled Dragon Race, not a single Dao Venerable of the Coiled Dragon Race survived. There was no need to mention those under the Dao Venerable Realm.

The golden blood mist permeated through the lands, and it drifted through the kingdoms around the Six Vision Sacred Land.

As they looked at the golden mist drifting around them, the experts of the various races couldn’t believe what they were seeing. The Tortoise Ancestor killed a good half of the experts from the Coiled Dragon Race with a massive body slam!

Looking at the nine grand ancestors of the Coiled Dragon Race, they looked a little worse than beggars with bits of shattered armor hanging off their bodies. They might not have been killed in the exchange previously, but they were not too far off from death.

They stared at the Tortoise Ancestor with fear gripping their hearts.

Just as they were about to speak, the Tortoise Ancestor’s leg came crashing down on them!

Boom!

As their vision went to black, the Six Vision Sacred Land quaked under his might. Cracks started to form around the land and a bottomless abyss formed.

Turning to glance at the abyss under him, the Tortoise Ancestor returned to the size of a tiny house as it stood quietly above the Soaring Dragon Platform.

Everyone turned to look at the fate of the nine grand ancestors, and they sucked in a cold breath when they realized that the nine of them had turned into nine puddles of mush in the ground below them.

Their bodies started to convulse when they realized the extent of the Tortoise Ancestor’s power.

“This… Is this the power of a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable?!”

“There’s no way! The black tortoise might be reaching the peak of the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!” A grand ancestor from another race muttered in a state of shock.

Everyone felt giant waves battering against their hearts, and their knees nearly gave way.

If a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable was an unbeatable existence, a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable would be a super unbeatable existence! However, they could feel that the tortoise was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable! It could be said that the black tortoise was an expert who stood at the peak of the Divine Tuo Holy World!

“Who in the world is he?!” Someone stared at Huang Xiaolong with a weird look in their eyes. How could a mere Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable be protected by a beast at that level?!

“The Coiled Dragon Race kicked a metal plate this time…”

“No! Don’t forget that the Coiled Dragon Race is backed by the Radiant Winged Dragon Race! The Radiant Winged Dragon Patriarch is the second strongest expert in the Holy Dragon World, and he is also a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable! He reached the large completion when controlling radiant energy, and he will definitely be able to deal with the tortoise!”

“If Ao Dong was the only casualty of the battle, the Radiant Winged Dragon Race will probably overlook the matter. After all, the other party is a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. However, the Coiled Dragon Race is practically exterminated after this incident, and there is no way for the Radiant Winged Dragon Race to sit by idly at the side!”

“Don’t forget that about the Heavenly Phoenix Race! Feng Xue was killed, and this is the first time someone dared to disrespect them! If the Radiant Winged Dragon Race works with the Heavenly Phoenix Race, even the Holy Dragon Race wouldn’t be able to stand against them! There is no way this young man will be able to escape from the Holy Dragon World with his life intact!”
