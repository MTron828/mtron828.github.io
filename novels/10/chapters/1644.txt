The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu and Ancestor Zhang Xiaomeng felt that their blood flow had reversed, and a sweet taste gushed into their throats, then puhh-f!

Both spat out a mouthful of blood.

Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng were dumbfounded. At their level of strengths, even if the opponents were peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts, it was impossible to injure them to this extent in a split second collision!

The Undeads were more powerful than they were rumored to be! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In truth, neither Gao Yu nor Zhang Xiaomeng realized that these one hundred Undeads were puppet Netherguards. The previous Lord of Hell had spent a great deal of effort, countless chaos grade and even grandmist grade spiritual herbs, and rare spirit stones to reforge these Undeads’ bodies. This had made them more powerful than the time they were alive.

Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng were not the only ones ignorant of that fact, even Jin Yuan, Tai Yue, and the others were astonished by the puppet Netherguards’ power.

They had seen these puppet Netherguards ten billion years ago, but why had these puppet Netherguards become so powerful after ten billion years?!

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong ordered four late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards to attack Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng.

All of a sudden, there were six late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards besieging Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng. Moments later, Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng’s tragic screams resounded in high air as both of them miserably tried to dodge and run for their dear lives.

These one hundred puppet Netherguards were divided into ten teams, ten in a team. Each team consists of a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm captain, thus, there were a total of ten late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards altogether.

Though these ten captains sounded slightly weaker compared to Asura King Jin Yuan and other Great Commanders, the gap in their strength was almost negligible.

Huang Xiaolong did not leave the remaining four late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards idle. Under Huang Xiaolong’s order, the four puppet Netherguards captains attacked the rest of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors.

Even Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng were no match against these puppet Netherguards captain, then what was more to the other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors.

In a few breaths’ time, four of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors were squeezed to their deaths!

That’s right, squeezed to death!

Little by little, squeezed into a meat paste!

Watching their Ancestors being squeezed into a pile of meat paste while struggling and screaming in despair, it brought devastation and fear to the Massacring Gods Gate’s Grand Elders, Elders, and disciples.

The rest of the puppet Netherguards by Huang Xiaolong’s side also rushed into the fray, diving into the Massacring Gods Gate’s army like wolves charging at a herd of sheep. Blood splattered wherever they passed.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion strong was utterly defeated, not a shred of resistance remained.

Seeing this situation, Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng’s eyes turned red. Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng bellowed, “Netherworld King’s Organisation, today’s matter is absolutely irreconcilable between us! One day, there’ll be a day when our Massacring Gods Gate will raze the Netherworld King’s Organisation to the ground!”

But they had just finished bellowing, when both of them were smashed into the ground below by two puppet Netherguards captains. One of the puppet Netherguard even tore off one of Zhang Xiaomeng’s arms!

Golden-colored blood splattered like raindrops from high air, hitting the ground with loud thumps of heavy objects.

This was the blood of an Emperor Realm expert, every drop was as heavy as a mountain.

Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng who were smashed into the ground. A cold sneer rose at the corner of his mouth as he said, “Raze us to the ground? What a pity, you won’t live to see that day.”

Huang Xiaolong glanced in the direction of the Massacring Gods Gate’s army. He disappeared in a flicker, and in the next moment, his fist struck a Massacring Gods Gate’s early Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm disciple.

That disciple merely felt his sight blurred, then everything turned black forever.

Huang Xiaolong had exploded the disciple’s head with a punch.

Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a flicker again, and again, and again. Everytime he appeared, a Massacring Gods Sect disciple’s head would explode.

Huang Xiaolong was selective, instead of going for high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples, he only killed those disciples below Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

In the time it took to blink, over a hundred Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

This sight amplified the fear in every Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples’ hearts.

Huang Xiaolong, a peak late-Second Order Heavenly Monarch was killing Sixth Order Heavenly Monarchs as if he was killing chickens and dogs!

They had never heard of such a frightening battle power.

“Kill him!!!” A peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Massacring Gods Gate’s Grand Elder close by roared in fury. His body was enshrouded in a fiery blood-red light as he thrusted the sword in his hand at Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

A burst of radiant light came from the tip of the spear, condensed from his entire body’s strength, even enhancing his attack using an ancient taboo technique by burning his blood essence.

As the Grand Elder was in close proximity to Huang Xiaolong, his speed reached the level of an early First Order Emperor Realm expert due to the taboo technique. Thus, his sword arrived within a meter from Huang Xiaolong’s chest almost instantly.

Asura King and the others were not going to make it in time to help Huang Xiaolong.

“Master!” The Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Yihai and the others shouted in alarm.

In the distance, those Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors that were miserably injured by the puppet Netherguards were thrilled seeing this.

Suddenly, a dragon’s roar reverberated between heaven and earth. A black divine armor rose to the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s body and desolate black dragons flew out roaring as they blocked the Massacring Gods Gate Grand Elder’s attack.

Jin Yuan and the others were stunned for a second, then sighed in relief.

“That is, the ancient Black Dragon Clan’s inheritance divine armor, the Black Dragon Divine Armor?!” Fan Hui exclaimed in pleasant surprise.

“Who’d have expected that the Black Dragon Divine Armor would be in the Master’s hands!” Wan Yutian laughed exuberantly.

That Massacring Gods Gate Grand Elder’s most powerful attack was actually blocked. Just as he wanted to make another attack, a big palm struck him, smashing him into the ground.

The attacker was a puppet Netherguard.

Although Massacring Gods Gate Grand Elder was a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm who had executed an ancient taboo technique, he was not strong enough to withstand a high-level Emperor Realm puppet Netherguard’s one palm strike. Smashed to the ground, the Grand Elder was reduced to a pile of watery meat paste.

Then again, even though the Black Dragon Divine Armor had managed to block that Massacring Gods Gate Grand Elder’s most powerful attack, merely the sword qi had sent Huang Xiaolong’s blood surging violently, and it gushed up his throat. A little bit of blood trickled out from the corner of his lips.

Seeing this, the surrounding Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples rushed towards Huang Xiaolong for the kill.

Huang Xiaolong sneered at their reactions. Instead of using the puppet Netherguards, he circulated the godforce from his Archdevil Supreme Godhead into the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s array. Immediately, the Black Dragon Divine Armor was akin to the sun exploding in darkness, shooting out rays of black blade light. The Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples in the path of these blade rays were slashed into two!

In the blink of an eye, several thousand Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples all around Huang Xiaolong plummeted to the ground, clearing a large airspace in the immediate proximity.

Seeing the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s power, even Jin Yuan and the others couldn’t help hiss in shock.

“Any disciple who kills him, the Massacring Gods Gate will protect his family for a hundred generations! Guaranteed hundred generations of prosperity!” One of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors bellowed furiously as he pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

Hearing that, a wave of Massacring Gods Gate’s disciples rushed towards Huang Xiaolong again like a swarm of hungry locusts.

Seeing this, an iciness spread over Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “In that case, I shall slaughter enemies to my heart’s content today!” A throne emerged under his feet, and it was none other than the Black Dragon Throne.

At the same time, the Black Dragon Divine Armor reconverged on Huang Xiaolong’s body as he sat on the Black Dragon Throne. A sea of black qi roiled from the throne, the harbinger of the king of myriad dragons, the lord of darkness.

Huang Xiaolong simultaneously pushed the power of his darkness supreme godhead, the Black Dragon Divine Armor, Black Dragon Throne, and Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle to the limit. The little rays of light from the sky were immediately swallowed by darkness as an army of thousands and thousands of black dragons appeared in high air.
