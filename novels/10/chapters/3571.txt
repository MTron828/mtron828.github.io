Chapter 3572 – Kneel

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, he saw Kun Feng, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong. Zhu Qiming was nowhere to be seen.

Jiang Hong’s expression sank. “Where’s Zhu Qiming?”

Lin Tong sneered in contempt, “Lord Zhu Qiming isn’t someone you can meet as you wish! Do you really think he will welcome you in person?”

Chen Yizhen continued, “It’s more than enough for the three of us to welcome you.”

Jiang Hong wanted to continue, but he was cut short by Huang Xiaolong. “Lead the way.”

Kun Feng shot a glance at Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong before bringing him towards the depths of the Creation Palace.

“Lord Zhu Qiming has already prepared a grand banquet. However, he only wishes to meet you. Huagn Xiaolong, leave all of them out here.” Kun Feng said.

“What?!” Wang Zaixu and the others felt their expressions sinking.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t care much about it.

A frown formed on Kun Feng’s face when he heard how easily Huang Xiaolong agreed. However, he didn’t say anything about it.

Several moments later, they arrived at the main hall of the Creation Palace and Huang Xiaolong got the rest to wait outside.

When he was brought into the main hall by the three of them, the gates slammed shut. The grand formation activated and surrounded the main hall.

Wang Zaixu and the others wanted to charge into the hall to help Huang Xiaolong, but they were stopped by the strong barrier.

“Huang Xiaolong, go ahead.” Kun Feng sneered in the hall and he gestured into the hall.

Huang Xiaolong strolled in nonchalantly.

As the main hall was massive, it took some time for them to arrive in the depths of the hall.

When they arrived, Huang Xiaolong saw a youngster who had a majestic aura around him. Clad in crimson robes, Huang Xiaolong knew that he was looking at Zhu Qiming for the very first time.

He also noticed that a middle aged expert was standing behind Zhu Qiming. The middle-aged expert might look extremely ordinary, but the aura he emitted told Huang Xiaolong that he had more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

“Lord Zhu Qiming.” Kun Feng and the rest were extremely respectful.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Qiming indifferently.

“Huang Xiaolong, why aren’t you greeting Lord Zhu Qiming?” The middle-aged man behind Zhu Qiming snorted. As the words left his lips, it was as though a clap of thunder boomed in everyone's ears.

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Why should I be greeting him? He should be the one welcoming me.”

Zhu Qiming waved his hand to stop the middle-aged expert behind him from jumping out. “Huang Xiaolong, I won’t beat about the bush with you. The Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance chose to serve my Zhu Family. Surrender now and release Kai Dong and Xuan Hong. Kneel to accept me as your master.”

Zhu Qiming spoke casually, but his words were like an imperial decree.

“Kneel? Surrender? Release Kai Dong and Xuan Hong?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Qiming like he was looking at a clown. “Are you actually stupid?”

Kun Feng and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong, happy to watch him make a fool of himself. Indeed, Zhu Qiming’s expression sank.

The middle-aged expert behind Zhu Qiming growled in anger, “How dare you!”

Rushing towards Huang Xiaolong with his outstretched hands, lightning surrounded the hall instantly.

The lightning he summoned contained a terrifying amount of energy. However, Huang Xiaolong’s arm pierced through the sea of lightning and a punch landed on the middle aged man’s chest. Casually swinging his arm, Huang Xiaolong tossed the man to the side of the hall like he was nothing more than hot garbage. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Kun Feng and the rest stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. The middle-aged man might have hidden his strength, but they knew how strong he actually was! Even if they worked together, they wouldn’t be able to hold him down in battle! He had 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy, but he was sent flying all the same!

Zhu Qiming was equally as shocked.

“You… Don’t you have 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy?” Zhu Qiming’s expression sank.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive as he muttered, “Did you hear about my strength from these dumb*sses?”

Kun Feng and the rest felt their intestines turning green when they heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed them, but they knew that they wouldn’t be able to do a thing after Huang Xiaolong revealed his strength earlier.

Getting up from his seat, Zhu Qiming slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong. He released his aura completely and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong you surprised me time and time again. Looks like you have 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy…”

“... Hahaha! Too bad that’s the extent of your strength! Today, you will kneel and surrender to me!”

Releasing his grand cosmos energy, the space in the hall started to twist from the sheer pressure.

Zhu Qiming had 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

From what it seemed, he had barely broken through to that level.

“Kneel!” Zhu Qiming pressed his palm down, and a frightening pressure descended from the void.

With 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy, there wasn’t a need to mention experts at the grand completion stage. Even Kun Feng would be crushed to bits!

However, Huang Xiaolong greeted Zhu Qiming’s palm with a punch of his own. Punching upwards, a blue dragon tore through the skies to shatter Zhu Qiming’s attack. Before he could react, Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed on his jaws.

The sound of bone shattering filled the air and the blue dragon tore through the roof of the main hall. A giant hole was formed.

Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air and stomped on Zhu Qiming’s chest, sending him face planting into the ground.
