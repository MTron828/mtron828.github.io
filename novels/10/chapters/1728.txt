“I don’t like to repeat my words twice.” Huang Xiaolong calmly stated, but there was a glint of killing intent in his eyes.

The Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder Chen Dongyue had an ugly expression on his face. The other side had insulted the Piercing Moon Cult.

He had explicitly indicated that their Head had ordered them to capture this person.

However, due to Luo Haoming’s identity as the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elder, Chen Dongyue tried to calm his anger by taking a deep breath before speaking, “My Master and your Hall Master Li Buqun are good friends. I hope that you will not interfere in this matter, considering the relationship between Hall Master Li Buqun’s relationship with our Head.”

Li Buqun was one of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Hall Masters and had a high status within the tribe.

Before Huang Xiaolong had killed Luo Haoming, he had scoured through Luo Haoming’s memories. Therefore, he had an understanding of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s external connections.

Had Huang Xiaolong been the real Luo Haoming, he wouldn’t have interfered in this matter. However, Huang Xiaolong was not Luo Haoming, and Fang Mingyu was a person Huang Xiaolong had to save.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong snorted at Chen Dongyue’s words, “I don’t care which Hall Master your Head knows. You and your group can scram now.”

The expressions of Piercing Moon Cult’s experts’ faces turned gloomier.

Even the spectating passersby were surprised by ‘Luo Haoming’s’ uncompromising attitude.

“Fine then, we have no choice but to be rude.” The Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elder Chen Dongyue narrowed his eyes as he spoke. Black rays of light suddenly erupted from his body, turning into a swarm of giant black pythons. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Before Chen Dongyue could attack, a shadow blurred, and Huang Xiaolong was already in front of him.

Chen Dongyue was startled and took a step back by reflex.

But Huang Xiaolong struck his palm accurately on Chen Dongyue’s chest. Metallic ember flames interweaved, and death qi swirled around Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

Chen Dongyue was knocked backward from Huang Xiaolong’s palm strike, smashing onto the streets far away. His divine armors shattered into pieces, and blood stained his face and torso.

“You, the Metallic Corpse Palm!”

The spectating crowd retreated in alarm.

The Metallic Corpse Palm was the supreme technique of a Spirits World’s ancient super force. The technique was lost in time, and Luo Haoming happened to have learned it due to a fortuitous adventure.

Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Supreme Godhead, his Lord of Hell’s inheritance, and the heart of hell enabled him to imitate any supreme divine art of Hell with ease. More importantly, others couldn’t tell whether it was genuine or fake.

This time, two different rebuking voices sounded. Two figures lunged towards Huang Xiaolong with their palms outstretched. Overlapping shadows of palm imprints formed a great palm mountain, pressing down on Huang Xiaolong from above.

The other two Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elders had joined hands to attack Huang Xiaolong.

Both of them were mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch experts.

Not even a late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch could escape unscathed after facing two mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarchs’ combined sneak attacks.

Unfortunately, their opponent was Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even spare them a side glance. He raised a hand and waved. Overwhelming palm force dispersed the other side’s attack. Then, he repelled both Piercing Moon Cult’s Grand Elders high into the air.

Two tragic screams shook the air. A long time later, two bodies crashed to the streets, demolishing buildings.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept across the rest of the Piercing Moon Cult, and he asked, “Anyone else wants to attack me?”

The Piercing Moon Cult’s experts immediately retreated. No one dared to step forward.

Several Piercing Moon Cult’s Elders helped Chen Dongyue and the other two Grand Elders up. Chen Dongyue glared venomously at Huang Xiaolong as he spoke, “Piercing Moon Cult will demand an explanation from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe for today’s matter.”

“Let’s go!”

In a second, the Piercing Moon Cult’s group left decisively.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the spectating crowd, frightening them away. Everyone quickly scattered away. Who could guarantee Huang Xiaolong won’t suddenly use them as targets because of his bad mood.

Only then did Huang Xiaolong turn to look at Fang Mingyu.

Huang Xiaolong was confident that the person in front of him was Fang Mingyu because of the jade Fang Xuanxuan had given him. Fang Xuanxuan had told him that Fang Mingyu also carried a jade on him. Within a specific range, the jade Fang Xuanxuan had given him would sense Fang Mingyu’s Jade.

“Many thanks for this friend’s helping hand.” Despite his doubts about why an unknown person would save him, Fang Mingyu quickly stood up and cupped his fists in gratitude at Huang Xiaolong.

“Swallow this pill.” Huang Xiaolong threw a healing pellet at Fang Mingyu.

Fang Mingyu caught the pellet with an astonished expression, “Is this a top-grade grandmist spiritual pill?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, “It’s Great Brahma Sarira Pill.”

The Great Brahma Sarira Pill was a kind of top-grade grandmist spiritual pill specifically for healing injuries.

Fang Mingyu checked the Great Brahma Sarira Pill in his hand with his divine sense. After confirming there was nothing wrong with the pill, he swallowed it. In an instant, warm streams of energy filled his whole body, and his injuries healed at speed visible to the naked eye.

Huang Xiaolong silently watched Fang Mingyu as he checked the pill with his divine sense before consuming it. It was clear that Fang Mingyu did not trust him. Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind his actions at all.

“Alright, I’ll send you out of the city now, then send you back to the Divine World.” Huang Xiaolong stated strictly.

“This...” Fang Mingyu hesitated.

“You’re still thinking about the Fallen Divine Flower?” Huang Xiaolong hit the nail on the head at Fang Mingyu’s reaction. Even under these circumstances, Fang Mingyu was still thinking about the Fallen Divine Flower.

“You know that I came to look for the Fallen Divine Flower? Who are you?” Fang Mingyu stared warily at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong did not answer his question. Instead, he took out the jade Fang Xuanxuan had given him before. The jade emitted soft resplendent halos, and it looked indescribably beautiful.

Fang Mingyu was overjoyed when he saw the glowing jade and stammered, “You, this, how, how come you have this jade?”

“Your sister gave it to me.” Huang Xiaolong went on, “When we’re out of the Nightless City, I have my way to send you back to the Divine World. Decide for yourself whether you want to return to the Divine World or stay here searching for the Fallen Divine Flower. However, if you choose to stay, I won’t accompany you while you go looking for that Fallen Divine Flower. I have my own things to do.”

Fang Mingyu’s eyes flickered with hesitation.

“Fine, I’ll go back to the Divine World.” In the end, Fang Mingyu agreed with much difficulty. His identity was exposed, and the Piercing Moon Cult was targeting him. Remaining on the Nine Yin Plane was equivalent to wooing death. Furthermore, the chances of finding the Fallen Divine Flower had always been slim, and now, those chances were even slimmer.

“Very good, let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong said. Without delay, he brought Fang Mingyu towards the Nightless City’s gates.

It was somewhat inconvenient to summon the Gates of Hell within the Nightless City, as they would be easily detected. Hence, Huang Xiaolong decided to summon the Gates of Hell outside the Nightless City, and then send Fang Mingyu back to the Divine World.

While Huang Xiaolong brought Fang Mingyu out through the city gates, inside one of the corpse pools within the Nine Yin Mountain Range, dense corpse qi roiled. Suddenly, a deafening roar shook the ninth heaven as dense corpse qi above the corpse pool roiled violently, growing stronger. A silhouette gradually became clearer above the corpse pool. This was none other than the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Young Lord, whose physical body was destroyed by Huang Xiaolong. It was Shi Yinyu!

“Congratulations to Young Lord’s new body.” Several Emperor Realm Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors flew over to congratulate Shi Yinyu.

During the time at the Nethersea, Huang Xiaolong had nearly killed Shi Yinyu. He had suffered severe injuries. Ever since his return to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, he had been in healing in seclusion, and now, more than a decade had passed, when he was as good as new.

Shi Yinyu nodded with satisfaction as he examined his newly reconstructed body. He then faced several Ancestors and asked, “Do you have that punk Duwei’s news?”

One of the Ancestors smiled and said, “Young Lord, we were just about to report this matter to you. That Duwei is here in Spirits World.”

“What? That punk’s in Spirits World!” Shi Yinyu was astonished at first, then exploded into manic laughter, but his laughter contained chilling killing intent.
