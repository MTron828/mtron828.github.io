Chapter 3642 – Stop Bothering Younger Sister Han’er

Allowing Cao Ying to get up, Huang Xiaolong ignored the other experts of the Cao Family.

“This city is really busy. The night life is pretty good too. Let’s go walk around a little.” Huang Xiaolong said.

Cao Dehong stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence for a second, but he didn’t say anything else. Bowing respectfully, he understood what Huang Xiaolong’s intentions were. When they just arrived, Huang Xiaolong planned on taking a look in the Cao Family’s residence. However, their actions earlier disgusted him so much that he didn’t want to look at their faces any more.

As such, Huang Xiaolong and his group left the Cao Family Manor and they decided to stroll about the city aimlessly. Cao Kezhang and the others remained on their knees in the Cao Family Manor as they didn’t dare to get up without Huang Xiaolong’s explicit permission. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When they saw their ancestor disappearing together with Huang Xiaolong, Cao Kezhang stared at his father in shock. Were they supposed to kneel there forever?

“Father!” Cao Kezhang yelled.

Ignoring his son, Cao Dehong continued to follow behind Huang Xiaolong. Only when they had disappeared from the sights of the members of the Cao Family did Cao Dehong plead with Huang XIaolong, “Your Highness, the members of the Cao Family…”

“They can get up after kneeling for an entire day.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“Many thanks, Your Highness!” Cao Dehong bowed.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others went around the city, Tao Han’er and the young master of the Jian Family, Jian Bifei, were also strolling about.

Tao Han’er arrived in the Stoneless City with the members of the Jian Family a day earlier.

“There are many things to do in the city!” Tao Han’er chirped excitedly as she looked all around.

Jian Bifei laughed, “There are many fun things to do back in our Unparalleled City. Little Sister Han’er, you haven’t experienced all of it.”

Jian Bifei was the son of the Jian Family’s patriarch, Jian Weifeng. As Tao Han’er was the daughter of Jian Weifeng’s seventh brother, she was considered Jian Bifei’s cousin.

Tao Han’er pouted softly, “No, there’s not! There’s nothing fun about the Unparalleled City. I cultivate every day without taking a break! Humph! I’m tired of looking at sword manuals! It’s so much more boring than when I lived in the Limitless Lands…” The figure of a young man appeared in her mind subconsciously.

Jian Bifei chuckled, “That’s because the ancestor thinks extremely highly of you. Not everyone can learn the Unparalleled Sword Manual you’re given! I'm not even qualified to look at it.” He continued, “I know that you’re thinking about your foster father. However, the two of you are from different worlds. There’s no need for you to meet in the future. Since he took care of you, I’ll send someone to give him a universe-level spiritual vein in the future.”

He knew that Tao Han’er had a father called Tao Hang, but he also knew that he was a mere disciple in a small family of the Golden Sea Celestial Empire.

In Jian Bifei’s eyes, Tang Hang was nothing more than a mortal.

Tao Han’er pouted after hearing what he said. “Without him, I would have died a long time ago! The grace he has shown me isn’t worth a small spiritual vein…”

“There’s the lord too! Without him, I would have died with my father! He saved us that year! He saved my life!” Tao Han’er yelled.

Jian Bifei frowned in response. “Han’er, you are now the princess of our Jian Family. Do you not know your status now? The man you call the Blue Dragon Young Master doesn't even have the qualifications to hold your shoe. In the future, do not call him lord any more. Otherwise, we’ll become a joke to the world.”

He had long since gotten people to investigate Tao Hang and Huang Xiaolong. With his abilities, there was no way for him to uncover any of Huang Xiaolong’s secrets. All he knew was that Huang Xiaolong resided in the Golden Sea City.

He heard about Huang Xiaolong’s act of defeating the three God of Creation Realm corpses. Even so, the number of God of Creation Realm experts at the grand completion stage in the Jian Family was huge. They didn’t need to care about someone like Huang Xiaolong.

When Tao Han’er heard how Jian Bifei looked down on Huang Xiaolong, she snorted angrily, “If you speak ill of the lord again, I’ll… I’ll tell grandfather that you’re bullying me!”

Jian Bifei jumped in fright. “Alright, alright… I was wrong!”

Tao Han’er snorted triumphantly and turned to leave.

The experts of the Jian Family ran after her and they tried to appease her any way they could. No matter how hard they tried, she refused to speak to them.

As she strolled along the streets, she caught sight of Huang Xiaolong and the others and she couldn’t help but stop in shock.

“Lord! Father!” Tao Han’er yelled.

Huang Xiaolong and Tao Hang were equally as surprised to meet her, and they slowly approached with Cao Dehong and the rest.

“Han’er!” Tao Hang exclaimed happily as he started to walk over.

Before he could approach, the experts of the Jian Family stopped him. They glared at Tao Hang like they would a mortal enemy. When Tao Han’er saw what was going on, she yelled, “Go away! That’s my father!”

The experts of the Jian Family hesitated slightly as they turned to look at Jian Bifei.

With a frown on his face, Jian Bifei eventually nodded for him to back down.

“Han’er!” Surprise filled his face and tears of joy streamed down hers. “Father… How have you been all these years?””

“Great! I broke through to the Dao Venerable Realm thanks to Lord Huang…” Tao Hang nodded.

Tao Han’er ran over to Huang Xiaolong and bowed, “Many thanks to the lord…”

Chuckling in amusement, Huang Xiaolong replied, “Don’t worry about it. It’s been so many years and you have become more beautiful since then!”

Tao Han’er lowered her head and blushed slightly, “Why did you guys come to the Zhu Lan Lands?”

“Naturally, we came over to see you.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Tao Han’er’s eyes turned into tiny little crescents and the grin on her face grew wider.

Jian Bifei’s frown got deeper when he saw the exchange happening between them. Stepping up, he said to Tao Han’er, “It’s getting late. We should return. Lord Jian Long told us not to stay out for too long.”

Tao Han’er revealed a reluctant expression, but Huang Xiaolong quickly interrupted them, “In that case, you should return. We can meet again at the auction tomorrow.”

“Are you going to the auction too? That’s great!” Tao Han’er jumped in joy.

Jian Bifei signaled for the experts of the Jian Family to bring Tao Han’er away before approaching Huang Xiaolong alone.

“Are you the person they call the Blue Dragon Young Master? Let me tell you right now, Little Sister Han’er is the princess of my Jian Family. Your status is like dirt compared to hers. Stop bothering her in the future. She’s not someone you can hope to latch up to.”

He turned to Tao Hang and growled after speaking to Huang Xiaolong, “In the future, you better not tell anyone you were her foster father…”
