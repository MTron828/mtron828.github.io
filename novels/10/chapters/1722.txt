The white light was swift and instantly penetrated the eyebrows of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s disciple.

As the disciple fell to the ground, his eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

Everyone was dumbfounded when they looked at the scene before them.

“Who?!” Gao Ning turned around suddenly and yelled, “Show yourself!”

As soon as the words left his lips, a streak of light shot through the air and smashed into Gao Ning’s chest before he could react.

Gao Ning flew out with a scream and slammed into the main hall’s walls, causing cracks to spider-web across it. His chest continued to sizzle as white smoke emerged from it.

Everyone felt their jaws drop in shock.

This!

Gao Ning was a late-Tenth Order Emperor! But an anonymous party had injured him severely!

Even Zhang Long and Ma Lairui had a face full of shock.

Everyone turned to look at the object that had smashed into Gao Ning.

“This is?!”

Zhang Long and Ma Lairui’s eyes brightened.

Miserable screams suddenly sounded one after another from outside the main hall.

Those were the screams of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s disciples who were standing guard outside.

Under everyone’s gaze, an Asura noble entered the main hall, riding a black lion.

“Your... Your Majesty!” Zhang Long and Ma Lairui greeted him emotionally.

The faces of all the experts from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe changed drastically as they retreated in panic.

Zhang Long and Ma Lairui stumbled as they walked towards Huang Xiaolong, and the experts from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe didn’t dare to move a muscle.

“Zhang Long and Ma Lairui greet Your Majesty!” The two of them came up to Huang Xiaolong and knelt in excitement as they bowed in unison.

Huang Xiaolong reached out to help them get up.

“Your Majesty, we...,” Zhang Long got up and tried to explain himself. However, Huang Xiaolong shook his head and reassured them, “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure they pay the price for spilling our men’s blood!”

Zhang Long was shocked initially, but soon after, he retreated behind Huang Xiaolong as he stood with his hands behind his back.

Without warning, a figure suddenly flashed, and a very fierce blade light slashed towards Huang Xiaolong. In an instant, it arrived in the space above Huang Xiaolong’s head.

The blade light surged, and it tore the space it had traveled.

Just as the blade light was about to reach Huang Xiaolong, a tall figure appeared and blasted it away with a punch. With no suspense, the blade light dispersed. The figure who had launched the sneak attack was sent flying away.

Everyone looked over and saw that the person who had launched the attack was He Xin, who had betrayed the Netherworld King’s Organization.

He Xin landed among the stone pillars located in the main hall, and his internal organs were destroyed. The meridians in his body were torn to shreds, and he vomited a mouthful of blood.

Huang Xiaolong glared at him with a cold expression.

“Cough, cough.” Gao Ning, who had been sent flying earlier, struggled to get up from the ground. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, a sinister smile appeared on his face. “So you are that piece of sh*t Nether King? Brat, you are practically seeking your death by coming to the Spirits World! Since you are here, you can forget about leaving! Our old ancestor will kill you and hang your corpse on the gates of our headquarters!”

Instead of raging, Huang Xiaolong looked at him with an indifferent expression. “I don’t know if your old ancestor is going to hang my corpse on the gates of your headquarters or not. But I do know that your corpse will be hanging on the gates of Death Tomb City. Moreover, your death will be extremely miserable!”

After Huang Xiaolong spoke, he waved his arm. The Heavenly Hall turned into a streak of light as it shot through Gao Ning’s chest and heart.

A miserable cry filled the air.

Under the corrosion of the power of sacred light, the pain in his heart spread throughout his body, and the distorted expression on his face was enough to express the pain he felt.

When the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe experts saw the scene before them, their faces turned pale. No one knew who was the first to scream, but everyone scattered and fled in horror.

As soon as they raised their leg, a brilliant white light brushed across their bodies. They dropped onto the ground in succession, and anyone could see a hole between their eyebrows.

Very soon, all the experts lay dead on the floor, leaving behind Gao Ning and He Xin.

A few hours later...

The bodies of Gao Ning and He Xin, who had betrayed the Netherworld King’s Organization, were hung on the city gates of Death Tomb City by Zhang Long and Ma Lairui, shocking almost every expert present in the city.

Their corpses were in a horrible state, and some people vomited when they saw them.

The original lively and bustling city suddenly became a lot quieter, and soon, it fell into a state of complete silence.

When night fell, Huang Xiaolong rode on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin across the streets of Death Tomb City as if nothing had happened.

“Refining a grandmist treasure artifact...” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered.

Before killing Gao Ning and He Xin, Huang Xiaolong had performed a soul search on them. He had learned about a lot of happenings in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

One was about a Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s old ancestor, Shi Ming combining forces with Lu Kin to refine a grandmist artifact. Even though he didn’t know what it was, he knew that once they successfully refined it, Lu Kun and Shi Wushuang would rely on it to surpass the Emperor Realm.

If this were the case, things would start to get troublesome.

As he thought of the possible implications, the two of them arrived before a massive mountain.

The mountain was entirely crimson, and it looked as if it was made up of red-hot iron.

“Death Volcano?” Huang Xiaolong was startled.

This should be the famous Death Volcano in Death Tomb City... right?

The Death Volcano seemed to be deeply integrated with the Death Tomb City. As for why it was able to continuously erupt death qi and magma for the past billions of years, nobody knew the real reason.

After standing there for a while, Huang Xiaolong proceeded towards the Death Volcano’s crater with the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

Within the Death Volcano, there were countless numbers of cultivation rooms. As long as one paid several spirit stones, one could enter those rooms to cultivate. Of course, depending on the location, the magma death qi’s concentration would be different—the denser the death qi, the more expensive the room.

When the two of them arrived at the crater, the Death Tomb City guards stopped them.

“Give me a cultivation room that’s on the lowest level. I want to use it for a month.” Huang Xiaolong threw a spatial ring to the guard, and it contained precisely thirty low-grade chaos spirit stones.

He knew that the cultivation room at the lowest level was the best for cultivating, and he had heard from Zhang Long that one needed to pay a low-grade chaos spirit stone to cultivate inside for a single day.

After looking at the thirty low-grade chaos spirit stones inside the spatial ring, the guard looked at Huang Xiaolong and said, “If you are not a disciple from a race inside Death Tomb City, you have to pay sixty low-grade chaos spirit stones.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong frowned. According to Zhang Long and Ma Lairui, the price should be the same regardless of where one came from, but the guard was asking him twice the amount.
