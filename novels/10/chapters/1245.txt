Standing on the battle stage, You Wuxin looked coldly at Huang Xiaolong. Even though You Wuxin had lost to Huang Xiaolong, while using his Divine Destruction Eye Art in the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City, You Wuxin was still confident to easily destroy Huang Xiaolong in this battle.

Wangu Ziyi and Wangu Dongchen watched Huang Xiaolong and You Wuxin intently.

"Big brother Ziyi, how many moves do you think Huang Xiaolong can take from You Wuxin?" Wangu Dongchen asked.

Even though both of them knew that You Wuxin had suffered a loss at Huang Xiaolong’s hands in the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City, their thoughts were also similar to You Wuxin’s. They also thought that Huang Xiaolong was no match for You Wuxin.

"Probably a hundred moves." Wangu Ziyi answered solemnly.

"A hundred moves!" Wangu Dongchen was genuinely shocked. "Is Huang Xiaolong that strong?! You Wuxin most likely broke through to Fifth Order Ancient God Realm a long time ago!"

Initially, Wangu Dongchen had thought it was not bad if Huang Xiaolong could barely take thirty moves from You Wuxin. He didn’t expect that Wangu Ziyi would think Huang Xiaolong could withstand a hundred moves from You Wuxin!

Light glimmered in Wangu Ziyi’s eyes, "My intuition tells me, Huang Xiaolong is far stronger than what we can tell from the surface. He will be able to take a hundred moves from You Wuxin, but it’s a pity that I won’t get an opportunity to defeat him myself!"

Wangu Dongchen glared hatefully at Huang Xiaolong’s figure, "Count him lucky!"

On the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong suddenly turned to look at Wang Shi and said, "Wang Shi, can we start?" His tone seemed to voice another meaning. Personally, he did not hold a good impression about Wang Shi.

During his time in the Golden Wheel City, Huang Xiaolong had learned the reason behind Wang Shi’s hostility towards him—Wang Shi was Wang Wei’s great-uncle!

After learning this, Huang Xiaolong could understand Wang Shi’s attitude towards him with more clarity. In addition to this, his suspicion that Wang Shi was tampering with the lots deepened after he drew You Wuxin as his opponent in this second round.

"Battle!" Wang Shi said as his face sank after hearing Huang Xiaolong call him by his name, but he still announced for the battle to begin.

"Battle!"

Wang Shi’s voice reverberated through the square.

Huang Xiaolong made his move right at this instant.

R-r-rumble!

A terrifying momentum broke out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, similar to a volcano erupting suddenly, after being in a slumber for a million years. Lava and tephra flew out in all directions.

Huang Xiaolong pushed his True Dragon Physique to its limits. Boundless dragon qi spread out from the stage as one black and another blue dragon heads appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s back.

You Wuxin had yet to react when Huang Xiaolong’s figure enlarged in front of his eyes. Then, Huang Xiaolong’s fist force roiled towards him.

Alarmed, You Wuxin was about to raise his arm to defend himself, but he felt a great force smashed into his chest, as if he was struck by a divine mountain and he was sent flying backward.

You Wuxin vomited mouthfuls of blood in midair, dyeing half of the stage crimson red, and then crashed heavily on the edge of the stage.

Booming sounds came from the battle stage.

Huang Xiaolong stood where You Wuxin initially stood, with his hands clasped behind his back.

Wangu Ziyi who had just said that Huang Xiaolong could withstand a hundred moves from You Wuxin was stupefied.

So was Wangu Dongchen, who had thought that Huang Xiaolong could only last thirty moves before he was defeated by You Wuxin.

Zhou Xu who was feeling smug after he had defeated Wangu Chang was equally stupefied.

Tan Lin, Luo Yunjie, and others were stupefied as well.

Li Lu and Wu Qian’er’s cherry mouths were agape with astonishment.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor who had reassured Huang Xiaolong to remain calm and had advised him to try his best by using his True Dragon Physique, were staring dazedly at You Wuxin who was lying on the stage.

The most interesting of all the reactions were Black Ice Ancestor’s colorful expressions, while her chest rose and fell; only she knew whether she was excited or angry.

A dark green light glimmered in the Dark Elf Tribe Patriarch You Kui’s eyes as he suddenly stood up, otherwise, he had been silent the whole time.

Wangu Clan Patriarch Wangu Rui, the Black Wind Cult Leader, and Barbarian Shaman Sect’s Chief had different thoughts regarding the scene that had just unfolded in front of them.

The entire square was deathly silent for a few seconds, and then everyone exploded in shock.

"How is this possible? Don’t tell me You Wuxin deliberately lost to Huang Xiaolong?"

"This is hard to say, but perhaps they had a secret agreement, otherwise, how could Huang Xiaolong defeat You Wuxin with just one strike?! For sure Huang Xiaolong must have offered some benefits to You Wuxin, so that he would lose on purpose!"

The crowd was getting increasingly noisy.

Most of them refused to believe what they had just witnessed—refused to believe You Wuxin had lost to Huang Xiaolong, moreover, in just one move!

Huang Xiaolong sneered to himself as he listened to these voices that were denying his victory. The majority of these people came from the Eternal Mainland and Dark Elf Mainland, even quite a few were sea tribe’s people.

‘Sea tribe? Probably instructed by Guo Gang.’

At this time, You Wuxin slowly struggled up on the stage, while staring fixedly at Huang Xiaolong as his face distorted with a killing intent. The white of his eyes had completely turned black.

In fact, his entire body was changing as black symbols wriggled over his skin, and soon covered him from head to toe. Even more shockingly, the black symbols on You Wuxin’s body kept changing, forming images of evil ghosts.

“Ghost Domain’s Ghost Body!” Several people in the crowd exclaimed.

There was an amazement in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he was surprised that You Wuxin could still stand on his feet, especially after exerting seventy percent of his True Dragon Physique’s strength during his first move.

It seemed like he had underestimated You Wuxin.

Judging from You Wuxin’s current momentum, not only he had broken through to Fifth Order Ancient God Realm, but had already reached peak early Fifth Order Ancient God Realm.

Ghost Domain’s Ghost Body? This is quite similar to his Asura frigid qi.

“Huang—Xiao—long!” You Wuxin’s pair of emotionless eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, while he bit every word as he spoke. “Go to hell for me!” He circulated the ghost qi in his body, and various evil ghosts appeared behind him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, just as You Wuxin was about to attack, a figure flickered in front of his eyes. Huang Xiaolong attacked first, punching with his fist.

This time, Huang Xiaolong exerted his physique’s hundred percent force!

In a moment of panic, You Wuxin raised his arm to defend, and managed to block Huang Xiaolong’s punch.

However, when Huang Xiaolong’s fist struck You Wuxin’s arm, You Wuxin’s arm broke, and Huang Xiaolong’s fist flew straight to You Wuxin’s chest.

You Wuxin was sent flying off the stage, similar to a broken-lined kite, crashing on the ground outside the square. His body jerked once and twice, then no longer moved.

The disciples from the Eternal Mainland started clamoring at You Wuxin’s defeat, and sea tribes’ voices were stuck in their throats. A while later, Wang Shi retrieved his eyes from You Wuxin’s body and announced the result with complicated feelings.

In front of the crowd’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong nonchalantly returned to the Fortune Gate’s viewing stage.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor looked at Huang Xiaolong, but neither of them knew what to say to him

Wu Qian’er had starry eyes as she looked at Huang Xiaolong and asked, “Senior Brother Huang, what is the name of your fist technique, which you used in the battle just now?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Invincible Supreme Number One Hegemon Divine Fist!”

Wu Qian’er had a dazed look on her face, then ‘puff’ she burst into laughter. Beside her, Li Lu too was smiling like a flower after the rain.

Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, and Myriad Flames Ancestor chuckled at Huang Xiaolong’s answer.

From the corner of his eye, Huang Xiaolong saw Zhou Xu and Tan Lin’s wax-colored faces. He asked with a fake concern, “Zhou Xu, and Junior Brother Tan Lin, aren’t you two feeling well?”

Huang Xiaolong’s question drew others’ attention to Zhou Xu and Tan Lin.

Zhou Xu and Tan Lin quickly squeezed out a smile, while shaking their heads and insisted, “No, no!”
