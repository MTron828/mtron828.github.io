“Then can I bid ten thousand?” A first rank force Grand Elder heard what the auctioneer said and asked in a jesting manner.

The others in the auction hall also broke out in amiable laughter.

“You can.” The auctioneer did not mind at all, joining the laughing crowd, “Who would like to be the first one to bid a price?”

“One million.” Someone from the crowd instantly cried out.

Although it was said they could call out any bid price, in the end, no one really called out ten thousand.

Hearing someone calling out ‘one million’, the easy laughter in the hall stopped.

“Two million!”

“Five million!”

“Ten million!”

“Thirty million!”

Following the first bid, many more cries followed like waves from the back, the price continued to rise.

Sitting inside the private room, listening to the voices calling out ever increasing prices, a wry smile flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s face. Indeed, he was the one who agreed to give the freedom of bidding price for to the current him, money was a mere figure. The amount was irrelevant.

When the bidding price reached one hundred million, it quickly jumped to one billion in a short few breaths’ time.When it reached one billion, the super forces families spectating from the private rooms also began to join in the bidding frenzy, turning it even fiercer.

“Ten billion.” From private room eight, the Azure Dragon Xiang Mingzhi’s voice sounded.

The last bid offer was six billion, and Xiang Mingzhi’s offer suddenly propelled the price to double digits in the billions, causing the hall to fall into an abrupt silence.

“Twelve billion.” After a momentary silence, from private room number four, a sharp icy voice belonging to a woman sounded.

“Fifteen billion!” The person inside private number room three cried out.

“Twenty billion!” A sharp gleam flitted in Xiang Mingzhi’s eyes.

“Twenty-two billion!” The voice came from private room five.

After the price exceeded ten billion, some of the first rank forces and families sitting in the auction hall had stopped competing. The price quickly skyrocketed, exceeding twenty billion.

Sitting inside his private room, Huang Xiaolong was frowning at the moment despite the ever increasing price offered. Could it be that Senior Crazy Lady did not get wind of the auction for the sacred grade immortal spirit stone and therefore did not come?

If this was the case, then it defeated the purpose of him taking out the sacred grade immortal spirit stone for this auction.

Huang Xiaolong lightly squeezed Shi Xiaofei’s hand, his eyes conveying remorse.

Shi Xiaofei shook her head, flashing him a comforting smile, “It’s alright. Even if Senior Crazy Lady didn’t come, I will still cultivate diligently so that I can awaken my Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique.”

It was at this time that a knocking sound came from their private room door.

“Come in.” Huang Xiaolong permitted.

The person who entered was one of the auction house’s supervisors. He faced Huang Xiaolong as he spoke, “Lord Institute Principal said that Senior Crazy Lady is here, in private room number four.”

“Private room four!” Both Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei shook slightly as joy rushed to their faces.

As long as Senior Crazy Lady showed up, the rest of the matter would be much easier.

A short while later, the bidding price for the sacred grade immortal spirit stone reached fifty billion. Fifty billion had far surpassed the internal limit set by many super forces’ Ancestors and Patriarchs. Despite that, there were people willing to offer higher still.

Inside private room number eight, Xiang Mingzhi’s face was gloomy to the extreme.

This time, he had only brought fifty billion, when the offer had exceeded that range, he could only give up. But, he was unwilling to give up just like this!

He had arrived in Black Warrior City filled with confidence to bring back the True Dragon King’s beast cores as well as the sacred grade immortal spirit stone, but now, not only had he failed to get the sacred grade immortal spirit stone, even the True Dragon King’s beast cores flew from his hand!

‘It was that Huang Xiaolong!! That Huang Xiaolong!’ Xiang Mingzhi’s eyes turned scarlet, the more the thought about it, the more his hatred surged. Everything was that Huang Xiaolong’s fault!

“Initially, I didn’t plan to do anything during the inner disciples’ assessment four years later, but since you asked for it, I will personally take the matter in my hands. Huang Xiaolong, I want your life! I will let you know the consequences of offending me!” He gritted his teeth, voice chilling to the bones.

In the end, the sacred grade immortal spirit stone fetched a sky-high price of sixty-five billion, but it was bought by the guest in private room number three instead of private room number four.

The guests inside private room number three were from the Gudu Family.

With that, the curtain fell on this year’s Black Warrior Auction House’s Annual Auction.

Knowing that Senior Crazy Lady had appeared and would be invited to his Master Feng Yang’s cultivation manor, Huang Xiaolong was finally able to relax a little.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were coming out from the auction house, they bumped into the three people from the Azure Dragon Institute, Xiang Mingzhi, and the two old men.

Xiang Mingzhi extended an arm out, blocking the two people’s path, his tone cold and condescending: “You’re Huang Xiaolong?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the other side’s attire and sneered, “I am. A good dog does not block the path, if there’s nothing else, please move away.”

The two old men behind Xiang Mingzhi were instantly enraged.

Whereas Xiang Mingzhi’s face reddened as his finger trembled pointing at Huang Xiaolong angrily, “What did you say? You! Huang Xiaolong, at first I did not want to do anything in the inner disciples’ assessment four years later, but now, you’ve completely infuriated me. Four years later, I will personally squash you like the measly ant that you are!”

The people passing by inevitably stopped to watch and listen.

“That looks like the Azure Dragon Institute Principal’s personal disciple, Xiang Mingzhi?”

“Xiang Mingzhi? The one hailed as the Azure Dragon Galaxy’s most heaven-defying genius? If I’m not wrong, they said he is already a Fifth Order God Realm master after less than a hundred years of cultivation!”

The people around whispered and sighed.

Listening to the whispers around him, Huang Xiaolong looked coldly opposite him. He didn’t expect the young man in front of him to be that Xiang Mingzhi.

Truly as the old adage goes, enemies meet on a narrow road. It seems like the person who fought him for the True Dragon King’s beast cores was this kid.

In a way, Huang Xiaolong understood why the other side was pissed at him.

“Huang Xiaolong, we’ve set our eyes on the True Dragon King’s beast cores, sell them to us now and we’re willing to give you two billion. In the inner disciples’ assessment four years later, our Young Lord can spare your life.” One of the old men standing behind Xiang Mingzhi stated icily as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

“What a joke! Your brain must have been damaged colliding with a Tyrant Boar, right? I paid thirty billion for the True Dragon King’s beast cores and you want me to sell them to you for two billion?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the old man as if he was looking at an idiot: “Are you an idiot?”

“You!!” The old man’s face flushed a deep red, his eyes spitting fire, and his killing intent pierced the sky.

“What? Want to fight?” Huang Xiaolong jeered.

They were in Black Warrior City. If the other side dared to make a move, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could make that old man lose his life here.

Xiang Mingzhi had calmed down by now, raising a hand to stop the old man from acting impulsively. Still looking at Huang Xiaolong with the same cold eyes, he calmly spoke, “Even without the True Dragon King’s beast cores, I can still flatten you just the same in the inner disciples’ assessment. Flatten you with one finger, like an ant.” His eyes as he shifted toward Shi Xiaofei at his side, “Your woman is not bad, enjoy the last four years of your life.”

“Let’s go.” Xiang Mingzhi’s group of three walked away.

Huang Xiaolong watched the three men’s leaving silhouettes. He acknowledged that Xiang Mingzhi was indeed very strong, but four years later, who will squash who like an ant was yet to be determined.

“Let’s head over to Master’s manor.” He said to Shi Xiaofei, no longer bothering with those who had left. They both headed to the Black Warrior City transmission array, arriving in Feng Yang’s manor shortly and meeting with that Senior Crazy Lady.

She was actually a slender woman, resembling an attractive madame in her forties. It was just that she was more than a little aloof and cold. Her real name was Yang Yi.

After knowing Huang Xiaolong’s intention, Crazy Lady Yang Yi did not agree to pass the Moon Summoning Rhyme to Shi Xiaofei in the beginning, but when Huang Xiaolong took out a sacred grade immortal spirit stone, she relented with a condition. The condition being for Shi Xiaofei to worship her as her disciple.

“Apprenticeship?” Huang Xiaolong looked over to Shi Xiaofei, seeking her opinion.
