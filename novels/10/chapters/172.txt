Chapter 173: Imperial City Battle (5)

Cui Li arrived wearing an elaborate and formal looking outfit. It had a very wide and open collar, making her deep gorge hard to miss. Her small delicate face was pure, yet there was an inexplicable charm.

However, Cui Li did not come alone. Another woman of about twenty-four to twenty-five years old came along with her, whose appearance was absolutely stunning.

Similar to Cui Li, this woman was also wearing a wide-collared dress that was fuchsia in color, complimenting her fair skin. Her beauty was different from Cui Li’s. The kind of charm this woman emanated was bone deep and like that of a flaming rose.

When this two woman arrived, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou were discussing the relocation of Nine Tripod Commerce over to Duanren Empire.

The moment they entered, Cui Li stuck herself onto Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye, flashing a bright smile, “Xiaolong, come, let me introduce you. This is Sis Zhao Wuji, isn’t she beautiful? She is one of the famous four beauties in our Duanren Empire.”

The person who arrived with Cui Li was precisely Zhao Wuji, the same woman who was with Heartless Young Noble Yao Fei in the private room next to Huang Xiaolong when he was at Unforgettable Intoxication Restaurant.

In that moment, Zhao Wuji approached him with a faint smile on her lips as she amicably said to Huang Xiaolong, “Young Noble Huang, you won’t mind if I call you Xiaolong like Young Sis Cui Li does, will you?” When Zhao Wuji smiled, she raised her hand up, causing the deep gorge in between her cleavage to show more prominently, making one’s blood boil.

“I’d like to know what the purpose of your visit is?” Huang Xiaolong asked with his usual unhurried tone.

Cui Li did not take it to heart hearing Huang Xiaolong’s less than warm welcoming attitude, maintaining her smile she said sweetly: “Of course it is to bring good news.”

Zhao Wuji took out a golden-colored invitation and handed it to Huang Xiaolong with a smile, “Xiaolong, you suppressed everyone today on the stage. Heartless Young Noble is holding a banquet in Unforgettable Restaurant to celebrate your accomplishment and hopes that you will come for a drink.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong took the golden-colored invitation, opened it and casually closed it back again. Shaking his head, he said: “Not happening.”

Both Cui Li and Zhao Wuji were shocked, for neither of them expected Huang Xiaolong would decline.

Cui Li hastened to persuade, “Xiaolong, Heartless Young Noble, like His Imperial Highness Second Prince, is one of the five most influential Young Nobles in Duanren Empire. People that are honored enough to receive an invitation from him are scarce in number.” A trace of anxiety seeped into Cui Li’s voice.

“I heard the Huang and Guo Family’s set a wedding engagement not too long ago.” At this time, Zhao Wuji suddenly spoke, “Even if we were talking about Guo Family’s Old Man Guo, he would need to give some face to Heartless Young Noble.”

When Zhao Wuji mentioned the Guo Family, she was undoubtedly referring to Guo Shiyuan and Guo Tai’s family. Huang Min and Guo Tai’s engagement was no secret, thus it was easy for Zhao Wuji to find out about it.

Zhao Wuji might have said these things in a docile tone while smiling, but every word spoken contained an easily discernible flavor of threat that did not escape anyone present.

Since Guo Family’s Patriarch must even give Heartless Young Noble face, she didn’t believe that after Huang Xiaolong understood the enormity of Heartless Young Noble’s identity, he would still dare to refuse!

Cui Li opened her mouth wanting to speak, but in the end, said nothing. After all, she felt Huang Xiaolong should not offend Heartless Young Noble for such a small matter. Which Duanren Institute student didn’t want to climb up the social ladder and build relations with Heartless Young Noble? Yet lady luck never had the time for their requests.

Huang Xiaolong faced Zhao Wuji with the same insouciance, “Really?” Then, he turned towards Fei Hou and said, “See the guests out!”

Both Cui Li and Zhao Wuji were astounded.

See the guests out?!

They had clearly explained Heartless Young Noble’s identity just now. A character that someone like Old Man Guo must give face and be courteous to was still rejected by Huang Xiaolong?!

Zhao Wuji had a strange expression on her face. She tried again, “Young Noble Huang, do you want to think it over one more time?”

Prior to this, she referred to him as Xiaolong, but now, even the salutation had changed to Young Noble Huang.

Cui Li’s heart lurched for a moment. Because she was familiar with Zhao Wuji’s character, Cui Li knew she was upset.

“Xiaolong, you!” Cui Li tried to salvage the situation.

“Send the guests out!” Huang Xiaolong repeated.

“Two Miss’s, please.” Fei Hou approached, indicating to Cui Li and Zhao Wuji. Zhao Wuji stared at Huang Xiaolong before shaking her head, laughing as she voiced her opinion, “Young Noble Huang, you will regret your actions today!” Leaving such a sentence, she turned around with Cui Li, preparing to leave.

“Wait!” Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded.

Zhao Wuji looked over, a friendlier smile appeared on her face, “Did Young Noble Huang change his mind? You are a smart man.”

But, just as her words ended, Huang Xiaolong threw the golden-colored invitation in his hand back to her, “This, take it with you.”

Catching the invitation in her hand, Zhao Wuji’s expression sank. In the end, she held herself back from saying anything else.

Fei Hou escorted the two ladies out and returned a brief moment later, reporting to Huang Xiaolong of their departure.

“Sovereign, that Heartless Young Noble, would he...?” Fei Hou hesitated.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No need to bother.”

Not to mention what’s-his-name Heartless Young Noble, even if it was Duan Wuhen who were holding a banquet for Huang Xiaolong, he would not go if he did not want to.

Pandering or ingratiating others was something he would not do. Huang Xiaolong was qualified to refuse an invitation from this Heartless Young Noble.

Zhao Shu interjected, “I can only hope Heartless Young Noble has good enough insight. Otherwise, I don’t mind crushing his ‘eggs’ to give him his lifetime’s most memorable lesson!”

Crush his ‘eggs’?

Huang Xiaolong, Yu Ming, and Fei Hou sweated at the thought.

“Fei Hou, investigate details about Heartless Young Noble’s background within the next few days.” Huang Xiaolong’s solemn voice instructed.

“Yes Sovereign!”

At this time, Cui Li and Zhao Wuji arrived at the Unforgettable Intoxication Restaurant, entering private room number two.

Inside private room number two, other than Heartless Young Noble Yao Fei, Yanggang, Pang Yu, and Dai Shanni were seated at the table. Adding Cui Li into the mix, four of the six young geniuses that possessed superb talent martial spirits were gathered together.

When Heartless Young Noble noticed Cui Li and Zhao Wuji return without Huang Xiaolong, his face darkened slightly, “Where’s Huang Xiaolong?” A terrifying pressure enveloped the area, almost solidifying the atmosphere in the room. Yanggang, Pang Yu, and Dai Shanni felt immense pressure, making it hard to breathe.

Cui Li was startled.

But Zhao Wuji ignored the pressure emanated from Heartless Young Noble, letting out a coquettish giggle as she walked to the empty seat next to him and sat down. “That fella surnamed Huang stole everyone’s thunder and doesn’t put you, the famous Heartless Young Noble, in his eyes.”

The underlying meaning was obvious, Huang Xiaolong did not accept his invitation.

A frosty chill spread from Yao Fei, and the temperature in the entire room dropped drastically.

“Did you clearly explain my identity to him?” Yao Fei’s expression seemed unperturbed but his voice was icy.

Zhao Wuji snickered, “I’ve already informed him thoroughly. I even said Old Man Guo must also give you some face, but Huang Xiaolong was not moved at all hearing that. He directly ‘sent’ us off. Before I left, he told me not to forget to take back the invitation!” She took out the golden-colored invitation as if to prove her words.

Yao Fei took the invitation, a spark of gloomy light shone in his eyes as a blue flame suddenly rose from his palm and engulfed the invitation in his hand. The invitation was instantly incinerated into nothingness, not even ashes remained as a clue to its existence.

“This is the first time someone dared to decline my invitation!” Yao Fei remarked coldly.

This time, he had sent out invitations to Yanggang, Pang Yu, Dai Shanni, Cui Li, and Huang Xiaolong. A total of five people. Huang Xiaolong was the only one to refuse. This caused him to lose a lot of face in front of Yanggang, Pang Yu, and the rest.

Xie Puti was a member of Duanren Imperial City’s Xie Family, and like the Yao Family, the Xie Family was one of Duanren Empire’s super families.

Therefore, Yao Fei did not invite Xie Puti.
