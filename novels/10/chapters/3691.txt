Chapter 3692 – Devil Land

Yin Guan felt his body turning stiff when Huang Xiaolong approached him with Zhu Chen, the Dragon Overlord, and the God of Death following closely behind.

“Lord… Lord Huang Xiaolong!” Yin Guan’s voice trembled.

With the three of them following behind Huang Xiaolong respectfully, Yin Guan had no idea what was going on.

“Where’s your city lord?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“He… He… He’s in the City Lord Manor,” Yin Guan stuttered. “I’ll bring all of you over now!”

The Dragon Overlord sneered when he heard what Yin Guan said. “Are you asking us to follow you into the manor to meet the city lord?”

Yin Guan jumped in fright, and he waved his hand in panic. “No… No… That’s not what I meant! I’ll report this to Lord Yin Qi immediately! He’ll personally come out to welcome you!” His legs went soft and he nearly fell to his knees.

“What are you so afraid of?” The Dragon Overlord chucked when he saw the look on Yin Guan’s face.

“I… I’m not afraid!” Yin Guan stammered.

“What?! You’re not afraid of us?!” The God of Death frowned.

Yin Guan opened his mouth, but no words came out. He was like a fish out of the water as he tried to rack his brains for the right words to say.

“Enough. Stop messing around with him.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “It’s alright. We’ll follow you back to the manor. Get him to wait for us there. I’ll leave after asking him some questions.”

The Dragon Overlord and God of Death shut their mouths the instant Huang Xiaolong spoke.

When Yin Guan saw the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death’s subservience, his heart pounded with fear. He turned to Huang Xiaolong and stuttered, “Yes… Lord Huang Xiaolong, I will notify the City Lord right now!” After he spoke, he brought the whole group towards the city lord manor. At the same time, he sent a report to Yin Qi about everything he saw.

The Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and the masters of their various regions followed behind Huang Xiaolong. With the experts they brought along with them, there were more than a million people following behind Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone in the city fell to their knees wherever the group of experts passed.

When everything was going on outside, Yin Qi was sitting in his manor as he trained his daughter, Yin Ping, in the way of the sword. His transmission symbol trembled slightly and he saw that it was from Yin Guan. Casually sweeping through the contents, he felt as though his mind was struck by a lightning bolt.

“Father, what’s wrong?” Yin Ping asked when she saw the look on his face.

Yin Qi opened his mouth slightly, but he didn’t say a word as he handed the report over to his daughter.

When she read the contents of the report, her eyes widened with shock.

“What?! Lord Huang Xiaolong is currently leading the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Lord Zhu Chen, and the various regional masters towards the City Lord Manor?!”

“Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen are extremely respectful to him!”

“This… This can’t be true, right?!”

Yin Ping felt her heart pounding in her chest.

“Father… Father!” A moment later, she snapped back to reality and she saw Yin Qi standing there like a wooden chicken. She couldn’t help but ask, “Senior… Seniors Yin Guan said that they are currently heading to the manor!”

“Should we head out to welcome them?”

Yin Qi woke up from his daze and quickly ran towards the entrance of the manor. “Hurry! Summon every single expert in the manor to welcome Lord Huang and the others!”

With a single order from Yin Qi, the entire City Lord Manor fell into chaos.

The experts who were eating, sleeping, or meditating, got to their feet, and they ran out with the fastest speed possible.

Huang Xiaolong might have said that it was alright for Yin Qi to welcome them alone, but there was no way Yin Qi had the guts to do that! The Dragon Overlord who was known for his explosive temper was following closely behind, and if he pissed the man off, they would be in for a world of pain. They charged out en masse to welcome Huang Xiaolong’s party.

Not too long after, they saw Huang Xiaolong leading a group of more than a million experts following behind him. The most notable of them were the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the various region masters!

Even after all that he had been through, Yin Qi didn’t know what to do!

He ran over to Huang Xiaolong hastily and he got to his knees. “Yin Qi greets Lord Huang Xiaolong, Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen!”

His daughter and the experts of the manor got to their knees after him.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “City Lord Yin Qi, you’ve become so formal after several dozen years… Please get up!”

Only then did Yin Qi and the experts of the City Lord Manor dare to get up.

“Let’s enter the manor. We’ll talk about the other stuff later.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I’ve heard that this is the greatest city in the Green Ghost Land. I wish to take a look around your manor…”

Yin Qi grinned in embarrassment. “It’s our honor.”

Soon after, he brought them into the City Lord Manor.

Long before he left to welcome them, he ordered for a banquet to be prepared.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the main hall of the manor, Yin Qi invited Huang Xiaolong and the various supreme overlords to take a seat.

However, Huang Xiaolong took the main seat and the others chose to sit on the seats a level lower.

Yin Qi felt his throat going dry when he understood the meaning behind their seating arrangements. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong asked Yin Qi about everything and anything during the banquet. They spoke about the Netherworld, the city itself, and Huang Xiaolong also spoke about his meeting with the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race. He also told everyone that the Golden Cymbals King stole the Ghost Staff from the eye of the formation.

Yin Qi felt beads of cold sweat dripping down his forehead when he thought about the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race.

Huang Xiaolong left the city after staying for one entire day.

After leaving, he brought the entire party towards the Devil Land.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong got the various supreme overlords and the region masters to send their troops back. The only people who were following him to the Devil Land were the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Zhu Chen, the five monster kings, and the region masters.

There was no doubt about it. There was only one goal in his mind. Huang Xiaolong wished to look for the Ferocious Devil.

The appearance of the Universe First Race caused worry to burn in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. The sense of threat he felt pressed down on his heart like a mountain. He came to look for the Ferocious Devil as he wanted to form an alliance to resist the members of the Universe First Race.

It would take him an entire year to travel to the Devil Land even if he used the Universe Boat. As such, he used the time to discuss the dao with the three supreme overlords.

With all of them by his side to test out his understanding of his techniques Huang Xiaolong gradually managed to comprehend three different types of techniques.

One year passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived in the Devil Land as planned.

The Green Ghost Land might be covered in weird negative qi, but the Devil Land was not. Although both regions had no sunlight, the Devil Land gave off a feeling of freedom one hardly ever felt.
