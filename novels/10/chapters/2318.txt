Chapter 2319: Big Brother Fu Yunjie is so Cool!

Very quickly, the participant on the bridge failed.

“Big Brother Yunjie, it’s your turn!” Feng Yuanyuan revealed a mesmerizing smile, and she spoke to Fu Yunjie, “When you pass the second test, we shall head over to the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse to celebrate your achievement!”

It seemed as though they were thinking of the same thing as Huang Xiaolong.

“Sure!” Fu Yunjie revealed a thousand-watt smile and promised, “Little Sister Yuanyuan, wait for me to comprehend the steles!” He approached the bridge and handed the slip over to the examiner.

Even though the examiner wasn’t Xiao Fuwen, their statuses were the same. The only difference was that the examiner, this time, was called Zhou Ruo.

Handing his slip over to the female examiner, Fu Yunjie leaped onto the bridge.

The Holy Bridge was a test created by an existence who had surpassed the True Saint Realm. The entire bridge was crafted with holy spiritual jade stones, and it levitated high in the skies above the manor.

There were twelve steles situated along the bridge, and all of them were spaced out equally.

The first stele was located at the head of the bridge, and the twelfth was located at the tail. It went without saying that the first stele was the easiest to comprehend, and the difficulty would only increase as the participant moved forward.

Completely confident in himself, Fu Yunjie placed his palm onto the first stele and started to feel the energy coursing through his body.

The only thing he needed to do was to gain an understanding of the energy contained in the stele. By doing so, he would be able to feel the holy dao contained in the source energy of the Holy World.

“Father, how long do you think it will take Big Brother Yunjie to comprehend the first stele?” Feng Yuanyuan turned to ask Feng Cheng.

While shaking his head, Feng Cheng explained, “It’s hard to say. With his talent, he will probably take ten minutes.”

Feng Yuanyuan giggled and made a bet with him. “I bet that Big Brother Yunjie will take only eight minutes!”

Fan Xia laughed when he heard what she said. “Yuanyuan, are you so confident in your Big Brother Yun?”

“Of course!” Her crisp laughter rang through the air.

Feng Cheng and Fan Xia exchanged a knowing look and chuckled softly. Amidst his laughter, Feng Cheng turned to look at Di Huai. After a short moment of consideration, he decided against greeting this old friend of his.

Since everything they had done together was in the past, he had decided to let it remain as part of history. Feng Cheng sighed in his heart. He knew that Fan Xia was the one who had exterminated Di Huai’s family, but he eventually decided to side with the True Reason Holy Gate.

With Fu Yunjie’s talent, there was no doubt he would be accepted into the Holy Heavens. Moreover, he would definitely be accepted by one of the elders as a personal disciple the moment he entered the organization.

Eight minutes quickly passed, and the second Holy Stele lit up with brilliant rays of light. The runes and carvings on the stele lit up, as though it had gained a life of its own.

“Nice!” Feng Yuanyuan jumped in joy. “I knew that Big Brother Yun would only need eight minutes!”

Feng Cheng and Fan Xia chuckled to themselves quietly.

The experts, who surrounded the bridge, clapped loudly, and they burst into cheers.

The examiner who presided over the second test nodded to herself when she noticed that he only took eight minutes to gain an understanding of the Holy World’s source energy. When disciples of the Holy Heavens had first taken the test, there were very few of them who had managed to comprehend the first stele in eight minutes.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t seem to care when he noticed Fu Yunjie’s outstanding comprehension ability. Instead, his gaze turned to Feng Cheng, and he comforted Di Huai, “Senior Di Huai, it’s better for you to forget about these b*stards who prioritize cheap interests over brotherhood....”

Di Huai sighed, “Yeah... I was blind to have treated him as my brother.”

Obviously, Feng Cheng had to have already learned of Di Huai’s race being exterminated. However, he still chose to side with Fan Xia despite the experiences they had shared together. The rage in Di Huai’s heart burned a little brighter as the hatred ran even deeper.

The joy of meeting his old friend vanished completely.

As Feng Yuanyuan and the others cheered him on, Fu Yunjie arrived at the second stele. He started to comprehend the source energy contained in the second stele.

This time, he took a little longer and only managed to comprehend it after twelve minutes.

It took twenty minutes to comprehend the third stele.

Thirty minutes to comprehend the fourth stele.

Forty minutes to comprehend the fifth stele!

It took him an entire hour to comprehend the sixth stele!

Feng Yuanyuan screamed in excitement when Fu Yunjie completed his comprehension of the sixth stele. Fan Xia and Feng Cheng couldn’t hold in their praises any longer and it was especially so for Fan Xia. He couldn’t close his mouth after smiling so much. After all, passing the sixth stele meant that Fu Yunjie would be accepted into the Holy Heavens! With his talent, he would be an inner disciple of the organization for sure!

After passing the sixth stele, Fu Yunjie walked towards the seventh stele under the bated breath of everyone present.

After two entire hours, light pierced through the skies and formed a faint image of a True Saint in the air.

“Nice!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Feng Yuanyuan clapped and cheered.

Many of the disciples were only able to comprehend the sixth stele when they were accepted into the Holy Heavens. Fu Yunjie actually managed to comprehend the seventh stele, putting him ahead of the rest! His talent had placed him in the top half of the inner disciples of the organization!

Fan Xia laughed non-stop as the cheery look on his face became even brighter.

After the seventh stele, Fu Yunjie didn’t even bother trying the eighth stele, and he left the bridge.

According to the rules set by the Holy Heavens, one could only take two hours to comprehend a single stele. Since he wasn’t confident to comprehend the eighth stele in two hours, Fu Yunjie decided to keep his perfect record.

“Big Brother Yunjie is too cool!” Feng Yuanyuan rushed up to him and giggled, “Congratulations for comprehending the seventh stele and entering the Holy Heavens!”

Fu Yunjie chuckled and thanked everyone for their good wishes.

As Huang Xiaolong waited for his turn to be called, the participants before him failed one by one. Finally, it was Huang Xiaolong’s turn.

Huang Xiaolong approached the bridge and handed the slip to the examiner. She didn’t bother looking at him and she simply placed the slip onto a table beside her. “Little kid, it’s good to know your limits.”

Since Xiao Fuwen hadn’t notified her after speaking to the vice hall master the day before, she had no idea that Du Cheng was extremely interested in Huang Xiaolong’s test!

“I will.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as he stepped onto the bridge.

When Huang Xiaolong started the second round of his test, Fu Yunjie and the others returned from their trip to the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse.
