All the experts in the hall were alarmed by the intensity of the black light. The weaker ones couldn’t even open their eyes as it them.

Xiao Zhangyu was dumbstruck by the black light filling the hall.

Chang Fang, Guo Jie, and Du Gao were also dumbstruck.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue dazed for a second. Feng Er who had examined Huang Xiaolong’s godhead earlier was dumbfounded.

"This?!" A moment later, Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue came to his senses. His lips quivered with excitement and he clenched his fists tightly to control himself.

It’s... actually—the Asura bloodline!

That’s right, the Asura bloodline! Asura bloodline—hell’s royal bloodline

‘I finally found it, I, Gui Yue, finally found it!’

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue roared ecstatically in his heart and almost laughed out loudly.

The crystal ball’s black light continued to intensify, darker and stronger akin to a black sun on the verge of exploding, delightfully releasing all its brilliance within.

The hall was dominated by the black light and there was no other color. It kept filling the hall with a mysterious atmosphere, quietness, and antiquity.

For a moment, everyone in the hall could feel that the darkness could also be beautiful and enchanting.

Soon, the black light spread out from the Ghost Manor and rose to the sky above it. The Ghosts Sea lit up in the black light down to the seabed, as if there was nothing between heaven and earth that could block this black light nor anything could conceal it.

“Indeed, the ultimate black light!” Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue couldn’t rein in his excitement anymore and jumped up from his seat. Even though he was a peerless master in the Clear Spirit World at par with the Xiao Family’s Ancestor, Ma Family’s Ancestor, Chen Family’s Ancestor, and a few more, excitement took him over.

Contrary to the crystal ball’s brilliant black light, Xiao Zhangyu’s face was as white as it could be. There was disbelief and denial in his eyes, ‘How could this be? How? Impossible! This punk actually triggered the crystal ball’s ultimate black light!’

Chang Fang, Xiao Family’s group, and the group of Hundred Tribulations Faction felt the same as Xiao Zhangyu.

In the entire hall, the only noise was the sound of the little cow smacking her lips as she lay on the floor, looking extremely laid back.

“What a boring group of people. Isn’t it just the ultimate black light, what’s there to be so excited about?” She knew that there was a stronger and more powerful black radiance above the ultimate black light, and Huang Xiaolong could surely trigger the black radiance due to his bloodline.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong suddenly removed his hand from the crystal ball. For a second, everyone’s sight darkened, and the hall returned to its normal ambience.

The crystal ball hovered quietly in the hall. Had they not witnessed the scene from earlier with their own eyes, they would’ve thought that it was an illusion

There was a pin-drop silence in the hall as everyone was looking at Huang Xiaolong. Suddenly, the little cow sneezed and the crackling lightning broke the heavy silence.

People were startled by it and they nearly jumped out of their skins. Anger rose in their hearts due to this, but it quickly vanished when they saw that the culprit was Huang Xiaolong’s mount.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue let out a hearty laughter, his laughter shook the entire Ghost Manor. There had never been a moment he had felt this happy.

“Ghost Manor Lord, you have said you will accept the person who triggers the ultimate black light from the crystal ball as your personal disciple, but what if there were two people that could do it?” At this time, Xiao Zhangyu suddenly said.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue had not expected this question and he blanked for a second.

“If I can also trigger the crystal ball’s ultimate black light, what happens then?” Xiao Zhangyu attempted to corner the Ghost Manor Lord with his question.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue said solemnly, “Then, I will accept both of you as my personal disciples.”

“Then, the position of the Ghost Manor Lord?” Xiao Zhangyu asked urgently, this was the question he was most concerned about.

But the Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue’s face sank, “Since you are confident, we can talk about it after you actually trigger the crystal ball’s ultimate black light.

Xiao Zhangyu could feel the sudden coldness coming from Ghost Manor Lord’s body and his heart tightened nervously. He dared not utter another word and walked straight to the crystal ball. Black qi appeared around his body as he circulated his godforce and soon the darkness element’s clouds were formed above his head.

Xiao Zhangyu’s godhead was a darkness element emperor rank godhead. Thus, this was his trump card.

Black light burst out from the crystal ball when Xiao Zhangyu placed his hand on its surface, and the black light grew increasingly stronger and brighter.

The Xiao Family’s group cheered.

Joy shone in Xiao Zhangyu’s eyes as deliberately glanced in Huang Xiaolong’s direction a few times. Yet, Huang Xiaolong kept looking calmly at the black light.

The black light from the crystal ball grew stronger as time passed, and the proudness in Xiao Zhangyu’s eyes thickened with it.

Everyone watched nervously as the black light filled the crystal ball. The Xiao Family’s group members were holding their breaths.

However, just as the black light was about to fill up the crystal ball, it stopped suddenly, as if it had met with resistance. Xiao Zhangyu froze momentarily, but he quickly pushed his darkness element godforce to its limit, yet he was unable to break through the resistance.

The smiles on the Xiao Family’s Elders and disciples’ faces dimmed and gradually disappeared along with the black light within the crystal.

A strange silence permeated the hall.

“This idiot thinks that having a little bit of darkness element power could trigger the ultimate black light.” The little cow’s harrumphed with disdain.

Everyone looked towards the source of the voice. It was the little cow that was lying comfortably on the floor with her butt up and tail swinging.

Xiao Zhangyu’s face turned red and then purple due to his anger at the little cow’s words. But he was more angry and annoyed that no matter what method he used, he was unable to trigger the crystal ball’s ultimate black light.

“I already told you that you are an idiot, but you don’t believe it, don’t you?” The little cow’s disdainful voice rang again.

Xiao Family’s Elders and disciples glared daggers at the little cow. It was obvious from their expressions that they wanted nothing more than to tear this little cow apart.

In the end, Xiao Zhangyu retrieved his hand from the crystal ball.

Instead of returning to his seat, his said to the Xiao Family’s group, “We’re leaving!” He stepped out of the hall leading the Xiao Family’s group, but he dared not show insolence. He respectfully said to Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue, “Ghost Manor Lord, this junior bids his farewell.”

Xiao Zhangyu did not conceal his killing intent as he glared at Huang Xiaolong and the little before leaving, as he passed by their side.

As Xiao Zhangyu stepped out of the front hall, Chang Fang also led his group of the Hundred Tribulations Faction out after bidding farewell to Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue.

Huang Xiaolong remained cold and indifferent as he watched Xiao Zhangyu and the others leave; he did not stop them from leaving. This was mainly because Xiao Family’s Elder Xiao Teng had not come to the Ghost Manor, thus, he would have to make a trip to the Xiao Family’s main residence on the Stone Buddha Mainland anyways.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue also did not stop the Xiao Family and the group from the Hundred Tribulations Faction from leaving. After Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang left, his gaze fell back on Huang Xiaolong, a gaze filled with gentleness and comfort.

“Congratulations to Ghost Manor Lord for finding a fine disciple.” The Ma Family’s group and other experts stood up to congratulate the Ghost Manor Lord.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue laughed happily and nodded his head as he exclaimed ‘good’ a few times.

Roughly an hour later, these various forces’ experts took their leave from the Ghost Manor.

Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue waved his hand and called Huang Xiaolong to stand in front of him. He took off his ghost mask and smiled amiably, “Kid, come and quickly greet your Master.”
