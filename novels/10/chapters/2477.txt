Ceng Ze nodded his head and agreed to Ji Yu’s request. “In that case, I’ll help pull the strings a little. However, in order to prepare for the Trial of Blood, His Highness Huang Xiaolong has been in seclusion without meeting any outsiders since his return six years ago. Even our Patriarch hardly gets a chance to see His Highness, so I cannot guarantee if His Highness would be willing to meet you.”

Ji Yu was over the moon, “I’m already very grateful Uncle Ceng could do this favor for me. How can I possibly ask for a guarantee that His Highness Huang Xiaolong will meet me?”

…

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong’s group, Ji Cai and the old man among them, reached the Blue Dragon Manor.

After he had paid several trillion holy bills for the Blue Dragon Manor, Huang Xiaolong had spent another enormous sum, hiring people to redecorate it. The current Blue Dragon Manor was more majestic and magnificent than ever, with abundant holy spiritual qi filling the scope of its land. Passersby could feel the rich holy spiritual qi within the Blue Dragon Manor coming from its four walls.

The whole Blue Dragon Manor exuded an imposing aura, giving others the illusion that it was one entity with the entire Holy Heavens City. Just the thought of this was enough to deter many people, including the high-level True Saints, from trespassing.

Ji Cai’s heart raced as she drank in the sight of the Blue Dragon Manor in front of her.

“This is His Highness Huang Xiaolong’s residence, the Blue Dragon Manor?!” Ji Cai asked dazedly.

Huang Xiaolong answered with mirth in his eyes, “That’s correct, this is the Blue Dragon Manor.”

“Come, let’s go inside.”

“Elder Brother, don’t we need the guard to inform the people inside before walking in?” Ji Cai was baffled by Huang Xiaolong’s casualness. She looked at the Blue Dragon Manor’s main entrance. The gates were wide open, and there were no guards standing at post.

“There is no need for that.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. I am going back to my own residence. Why do I need to inform anyone?

Huang Xiaolong went in first. Yu Ming, the Departing Sword Sage, and the rest followed right after him.

Ji Cai followed them in a daze, while the old man Guard Chen once again looked at Huang Xiaolong doubtfully.

The Blue Dragon Manor is His Highness Huang Xiaolong’s residence! There is no need to inform prior to entering the Blue Dragon Manor? Ji Cai was a little innocent that she didn’t think too much into things, but he was not the same innocent little Ji Cai.

He moved closer to Ji Cai as they walked in, surprisingly, unimpeded.

“Your Highness, you’re back!”

A group of Blue Dragon Manor’s guards on patrol spotted Huang Xiaolong, and hurried over to salute respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and had them rise from kneeling.

These guards were among those sent over by Wu Ge.

Despite the obvious, Ji Cai asked naively, “Elder Brother, you’re a ‘Highness?’ Are you some ancient race’s young patriarch prior to entering the Holy Heavens?”

Some ancient races in the Holy World referred to their young patriarchs as His Highness.

Old man Guard Chen trembled when he saw the several guards kneeling down and respectfully saluting Huang Xiaolong. A thunderbolt struck in his mind, and his eyes protruded as he stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, “You, you are really His Highness Huang Xiaolong?!”

Not just someone with the same name?!

In the Holy Heavens organisation, only the core Holy Princes, or a Primal Ancestor’s personal disciple could be titled as His Highness. In the entire Holy Heavens organisation, among the core Holy Princes and Primal Ancestors’ personal disciples, there was only one Huang Xiaolong! There cannot be another person of the same name!

“What really is meant by His Highness Huang Xiaolong?” Ji Cai turned and asked Guard Chen behind her in confusion.

Whereas Huang Xiaolong said to the old man Guard Chen, “I already told you that I am Huang Xiaolong.”

Another shi+ver ran down Guard Chen’s back as he hastened down to his knees, feeling flustered as he saluted, “Chen Baoqin greets Your Highness Huang Xiaolong. We were not aware of Your Highness’ identity before, so please pardon us!” Big drops of sweat trickled down the side of his face.

He had actually suspected Huang Xiaolong harbored ill-intentions earlier, and there was a moment that he had thought Huang Xiaolong might be in cahoot with Ji Yu, performing a show to blindside him and Ji Cai.

Ji Cai was agape with shock, staring at Chen Baoqin, who was kneeling on the ground. By this point, no matter how ‘innocent’ she was, she realized who this elder brother in front of her was.

“You, H-Huang, His Highness Huang Xiaolong?!!” Ji Cai finally blurted out with eyes wide with absolute shock, and her cherry mouth was agape at the end.

“Princess, remember your manners.” Chen Bao hurriedly reminded Ji Cai.

Only then did Ji Cai’s senses return and she quickly knelt before Huang Xiaolong in salute.

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he lightly held the young girl’s elbow, bringing her up to her feet, “Stand up. Just call me Elder Brother. Either way, it’s just a salutation.”

Then, Huang Xiaolong had Chen Baoqin rise as well.

But Huang Xiaolong had just helped Ji Cai up to her feet, when the young girl once again plopped down to her knees. On top of that, her arms were wrapped around Huang Xiaolong’s thighs as she wailed her heart out.

Huang Xiaolong froze on the spot. Yu Ming, Chen Zhi, Departing Sword Sage, and even Chen Baoqin were stupefied by this sight.

Chen Baoqin’s body swayed. He was terrified. Just as he wanted to pull Ji Cai off Huang Xiaolong’s thighs, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, indicating that it was fine. A while later, Ji Cai’s voice sounded through intermittent sobs as she recounted what had happened to her to Huang Xiaolong. She was originally the Blood Qilin Race’s princess, but her father’s subordinates had rebelled and usurped, imprisoning her parents and several elder brothers. She begged and begged Huang Xiaolong to rescue her parents and siblings.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry looking at the pitiful human-pendant hanging on his thighs, with tear-stains streaking down her face. Ji Cai’s tears had made a big wet patch on his robe, and an even more awkward thing was that Ji Cai was hugging his thighs as she cried, indirectly squeezing her bosom onto his thighs… Despite Ji Cai’s youthful appearance, she had got a curvaceous shape.

Huang Xiaolong tried to pull her up.

But Ji Cai tightened her hold around his thighs in a panic, begging Huang Xiaolong to save her parents and siblings, vowing that as long as Huang Xiaolong was willing to rescue her parents and siblings, she was willing to be his slave, or whatever Huang Xiaolong wanted.

Unable to withstand the pressure coming from the girl’s generous bosom, Huang Xiaolong could only nod his head and agreed to her request.

Ji Cai broke into laughter through her sobs at his promise, and finally released Huang Xiaolong’s thighs.

Huang Xiaolong helped her up then asked, “Acting the way you did, aren’t you afraid I would be angry?”

Ji Cai looked at Huang Xiaolong with a pair of innocent doe-like eyes, asking timidly, “Then, Elder Brother, would you be angry?”

Huang Xiaolong was utterly speechless.

“I have to stress that I merely promised to rescue your parents and siblings, but I won’t interfere with other things.” Huang Xiaolong stated.

Ji Cai quickly nodded her head, while Chen Baoqin kneeled towards Huang Xiaolong with utmost reverence in gratitude.

After this small fiasco ended, Di Huai emerged, and with him was Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and the others. All of them were surprised when they saw Ji Cai. Huang Xiaolong didn’t explain anything. He merely made a round of introductions between two sides, and then had Zhang Wenyue arrange accommodation for Ji Cai.

Moments after Huang Xiaolong had Zhang Wenyue arrange for Ji Cai’s accommodation, he received a calling card from the Mission Hall’s Elder Ceng Ze saying the Blood Qilin Race’s Princess Ji Yu wanted to pay her respects to him.

Huang Xiaolong smiled when he saw the calling card. He was just about to have Elder Ceng Ze come over, and here he was already. Huang Xiaolong said to Di Huai, “Tell Ceng Ze to bring that Blood Qilin Race’s Princess Ji Yu when he comes to see me.”

Before long, Ji Yu who was staying at Ceng Ze residence received news that Huang Xiaolong wanted to see her. Her face beamed with ecstasy as she sought confirmation, “Uncle Ceng Ze, really, is what you’ve said for real? His Highness Huang Xiaolong, he’s willing to see me?”

Ceng Ze laughed heartily watching her reaction and reassured her, “That’s right, His Highness Huang Xiaolong’s steward has just replied to me, telling me to bring you to see him in a bit.”

“In a bit?”Ji Yu’s eyes twinkled with unspoken joy, “Uncle Ceng Ze, please wait a moment, I’ll go freshen up.”
