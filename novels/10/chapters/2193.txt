Chapter 2194: Already Captured the Old Man

The instant the barrier broke, countless weapons pierced towards the experts of the Massacring God Heavenly Country.

The ruler’s cold voice resounded through the air, “Their resistance is futile.” He chopped down with the edge of his hand and shattered every single weapon sent out by the members hiding inside the barrier.

The members of the Massacring God Heavenly Country were already prepared, and they made their move. They blocked the desperate attacks of the King of Grandmist and more in an instant.

As they realized that there was no other choice, the King of Grandmist, the Xumi Old Man, and the experts of the two heavenly countries shot into the skies.

“Take the King of Grandmist and the others. Kill the rest!” The ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country ordered.

His figure blurred as soon as the words left his lips, and he chopped a fleeing general from the Heavenly Saint Country into two.

Blood rained down on the lands as the battle began.

Shrieks filled the air as experts fell one after another.

After killing several generals from the two Heavenly Countries, Massacring God Ruler appeared before the King of Grandmist. After all, the old man was the most important target.

“Old man, resistance is futile.” A cold glare bore into the King of Grandmist’s eyes as Massacring God Ruler continued, “Give yourself up, or I will show you the price you have to pay for resisting!”

Even though he couldn’t kill the King of Grandmist, there were still a ton of ways he could torture the other party before handing him over to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

The King of Grandmist roared with laughter, “If my disciple returns, everyone in your Heavenly Country will pay the price!”

As soon as Huang Xiaolong was brought up, Massacring God Ruler lost his cool. Humiliation and fear filled his heart, but it was soon replaced by hatred. “Old b*stard, you’re looking to die! Since you’re not willing to surrender, I’ll torture you all I want before handing you over to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country! That little dog of a disciple won’t be here to save you!”

“Is that so?”

A chilly voice broke the tense situation before Massacring God Ruler could make his move.

The ruler’s body froze when the voice entered his ears. Why does that sound so familiar? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

A look of surprise appeared on the King of Grandmist’s face. “Xiaolong!”

In contrast, a dumbfounded expression found its way onto the Massacring God Ruler’s face when he heard what the King of Grandmist said. However, a mocking smile soon formed on his face. “Your acting skills are pretty good... you almost fooled me!”

According to him, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could still be alive.

No one could survive once they were swallowed by the lightning barrage. Even the leader of the 33 Heavens Race wouldn’t be able to withstand it, using his half-completed saint artifact. It was even less possible for Huang Xiaolong to escape with his life.

It was too bad a frosty growl proved him wrong. “Kill them!”

Kill!

The rulers of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country made their moves as they killed their way into the battlefield. They appeared among the experts of the Massacring God Heavenly Country and started their killing spree. Like a wolf among a flock of sheep, no one managed to stop them. Cultivators started falling once again.

As soon as Massacring God Ruler saw the newcomers, waves of shock battered against his heart. The blood drained from his face and his body froze. Turning around with a stiff body, he stared at Huang Xiaolong who was less than a meter away from him.

He nearly died from fright when he stared at the monster standing behind him. He jumped backwards and only stopped when he was several tens of thousands of miles away from his original position. His heart was pounding and he felt that it could stop at any moment.

“Huang... Huang... Huang...”

He failed to complete Huang Xiaolong’s name no matter how hard he tried.

Staring at the terrified ruler, a smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “We meet again! If my memory serves me right, this should be our third meeting...”

The first was when they were fighting over the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruit. They had met again during the epic showdown between Huang Xiaolong, Yang Tianchen, and the Giant Kun Ruler.

This was their third meeting!

The Massacring God Ruler shook his hands in a hurry as he yelled, “Lord Huang Xiaolong, this isn’t my doing!”

“Are you sure you had nothing to do with this?”

“I swear that I had nothing to do with this!” Massacring God Ruler choked and he didn’t know how to respond. Getting to his knees in a hurry, he tried to explain everything to Huang Xiaolong. “Lord Huang, this is an order by the Giant Kun Heavenly Country! I didn’t make this decision!”

When everyone saw Massacring God Ruler kneeling to Huang Xiaolong, they felt as though a bomb was going off in their heads.

Thinking about things thoroughly, they couldn’t really blame Massacring God Ruler for his actions. The battle between Huang Xiaolong, Yang Tianchen, and the Giant Kun Ruler was still fresh in their minds. Even though a long time had already passed, the battle was too impactful for any one of them to forget.

Three hegemons of the Heavens Path had surrounded Huang Xiaolong in the space outside the 33 heavens. Instead of killing Huang Xiaolong, they had experienced a miserable defeat! Nearly all of their troops had died and a super expert like the Giant Kun Ruler was battered to a sorry state by Huang Xiaolong! The fear he had for Huang Xiaolong was deeply rooted in his heart and there was no way in hell he would choose to battle against Huang Xiaolong ever again! If someone like that was afraid of Huang Xiaolong, there was no need to mention anything about the Massacring God Ruler! He was a mere Eighth Order Sovereign and he was a far cry from the top expert in the Heavens Path!

As he stared at the Massacring God Ruler kneeling in front of him, Huang Xiaolong chuckled in a low voice, “If you say that you have nothing to do with this, why are the members of your Massacring God Heavenly Country surrounding my master? Do you think that I’m retarded? Weren’t you planning to hand my master over to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country for the reward?”

The ruler’s body couldn’t help but tremble when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Turning into a streak of light to escape, the Massacring God Ruler ran hundreds of millions of miles away in the blink of an eye. It was clear that he had planned his escape the moment he had seen Huang Xiaolong.

Watching the Massacring God Ruler’s frantic escape, Huang Xiaolong causally stretched his hand out. A palm strike broke through the void and landed on his back. A wretched scream filled the skies as the divine armor around him shattered. He was slammed into the ground and a human-shaped indentation appeared in the earth.

“Your Majesty, hurry up and leave!” The generals of the Massacring God Heavenly Country rushed towards Huang Xiaolong as they tried to buy time for their ruler to run.

“You guys are seeking death!” A chilly light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and he no longer held back. The lightning bead appeared and shot towards them, lightning qi filling the space around it. As soon as they came into contact with the lightning qi, their bodies turned to ash.

In the space outside the 33 heavens, the lightning bead had consumed an ungodly amount of lightning spiritual qi and its power had increased by leaps and bounds. How could anyone from the Massacring God Heavenly Country withstand the lightning qi it emitted?

After killing dozens of generals, he waved his hand to grab all the living generals. Although they were living, it was more appropriate to say that they were on their last breaths.

After looking at Massacring God Ruler, who was close to breaking down, Huang Xiaolong said, “Don’t worry. I’m not going to kill you.”

Massacring God Ruler stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock as a trace of hope appeared in his eyes.

“Send a report to Giant Kun Ruler right now. Tell him that you have my master and the others and are bringing them over now!”

At that moment, Massacring God Ruler realized the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s ‘mercy.’

“Lord Huang... After I send the report, will you spare my life? I can swear to the heavens that I will only follow your orders from now on!” After a moment of hesitation, Massacring God Ruler begged.

“!!!” He was only met with a frosty glare by Huang Xiaolong.

With a trembling heart, the Massacring God Ruler could only retrieve his transmission symbol to contact the Giant Kun Ruler.

When the Giant Kun Ruler received the message, a brilliant light flashed in his eyes, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Father, this...” Giant Kun Heavenly Prince spoke up all of a sudden when he saw his father’s unusual reaction.

Hearty laughter left the lips of the Giant Kun Ruler, and he explained, “The Massacring God Ruler sent news that he has managed to capture the old man! They are currently on the way here with the captives!”
