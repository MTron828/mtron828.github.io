“That’s right, Ancestor! Even though Huang Xiaolong has done a meritorious deed by winning the first place in the three sects’ joint training, bringing glory to our sect, we cannot break long-established rules and give him authority and treatment equal to a Grand Elder!” Seeing Cao Yang spoke, Zhuang Xuan also bravely stepped forward, trying to persuade Lu Zhuo.

“Chen Hao is our Barbarian God Sect’s chief disciple, but even he only has authority and treatment equivalent to an Elder.” Huang Junfei joined in cautiously. “Huang Xiaolong is still a mere core disciple, how could he possess authority exceeding Chen Hao?”

Several Grand Elders who supported Chen Hao also joined in, ‘sincerely’ persuading Lu Zhuo.

Lu Zhuo’s brows furrowed slightly, getting annoyed. In an instant, an overwhelming divine might soared to the sky from his body as he snorted in displeasure, “Rules? Aren’t my words rules?”

Facing Lu Zhuo’s overwhelming pressure, Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, Huang Junfei, and the others became ashen, quickly falling to their knees in apprehension and screaming they dared not defy.

“Enough, this matter is decided!” Lu Zhuo harrumphed coldly, leaving no doubt toward his decision.

The trio formed by Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei dared not utter another word of objection.

Lu Zhuo turned toward Huang Xiaolong, the sharp stern face from earlier was replaced by a kind and warm smile, “Xiaolong, rest well these couple of days. Two days later, I will bring you to cultivate inside the Primordial Celestial Shrine.” The change was like a different person altogether.

Huang Xiaolong and another inner disciple who were in the top ten complied respectfully.

Lu Zhuo subsequently mentioned to Huang Xiaolong that he could make two requests, which Huang Xiaolong used to claim a grade three spiritual vein and ten thousand Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm godheads.

The grade three spiritual vein was for himself, whereas the godheads were for Xiaoniū.

The Barbarian God Sect might not be able to take out ten grade three spiritual veins, but they could still afford one. Thus, in public, Lu Zhuo took out the grade three spiritual vein and ten thousand Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm godheads, giving them to Huang Xiaolong.

A short while later after the reward ceremony came to an end, everyone dispersed.

Another half an hour later, from inside Chen Hao’s cultivation dwelling, a beast-like furious roar shook the air. Chen Hao was smashing everything in sight and his eyes were scarlet like an angered wild beast. Several stone pillars inside the hall were shattered amidst his fury, hence the hall’s roof was swaying at the moment, on the verge of collapse.

All the present Sky Dragon League members quivered in fear.

“Lu Zhuo that old fart! I, the chief disciple, only have an Elder’s authority and treatment, on what basis does that Huang Xiaolong exceed me?!” Chen Hao bellowed.

“Based on what?!”

“Why?!”

Chen Hao’s raging shouts continued to shake the hall, yet no one had the answer.

In the hall, Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, Huang Junfei, and others watched the manic Chen Hao. They couldn’t help frowning, then shook their heads in slight disappointment moments later. Then again, anyone in Chen Hao’s shoes would go crazy at the news!

“Alright, all of you go out.” Cao Yang ordered the present Sky Dragon League disciples.

Everyone quickly acknowledged and fled out of the hall.

Cao Yang looked at Chen Hao and said, “For that old guy Lu Zhuo to announce such a decision today, there must be a reason deeper than winning first place in the three sects’ joint training.”

Zhuang Xuan spoke with heavy solemness, “We’ve long since doubted that Huang Xiaolong’s godhead is a low grade king rank. Judging from the events today, Ancestor probably knows what his real godhead is, otherwise he would not have announced it in such a high-profile manner.”

Chen Hao had calmed down slightly by now and his eyes glimmered, resembling the venomous stare of a viper.

“I would guess Huang Xiaolong’s godhead is at least top grade king rank!” Huang Junfei made a bold guess.

“Top grade king rank!” Cao Yang and Zhuang Xuan exclaimed. Their expressions weren’t necessarily filled with shock, but denial.

Chen Hao’s eyes narrowed dangerously at the possibility.

“Although it might not be a top grade king rank godhead, it should at least be a high grade one.” Huang Junfei added solemnly, “Otherwise it cannot explain his frightening cultivation growth. In my opinion, he most likely has some kind of unique physique as well, a unique physique ranked within the top one hundred.”

“Not very likely, right?” Cao Yang refuted. “I don’t believe that punk is monstrous to that degree.”

Chen Hao gloomily interjected, “Top grade king rank godhead and a unique physique, on top of those things, his good luck in obtaining chaos spiritual herbs does explain his terrifying growth in a short few years!”

Cao Yang had no words to refute.

“This punk cannot be left alive, or else, based on his horrifying cultivation speed, we’re going to die in his hands sooner or later.” Zhuang Xuan’s worry was laced with strong killing intent.

A golden light sparked in the depth of Chen Hao’s eyes, “Huang Xiaolong won’t live for long unless he plans to hide inside the Barbarian God Sect his entire life.”

Cao Yang’s tone suddenly changed, looking at Zhuang Xuan and Huang Junfei, “Five months later, it is my Cao Family young master’s big wedding day. At that time, I hope both of you can come and have a drink ah.”

“The Cao Family young master’s big wedding ah, we will naturally be there to celebrate.” Zhuang Xuan and Huang Junfei both laughed.

“We can drink our fill after killing Huang Xiaolong.”

...

After the reward ceremony ended, Huang Xiaolong returned to his manor from the Soaring Sky Hall, however. He was in no hurry to refine the drop of Blood Phoenix blood essence, taking out ten thousand Tiger Form Pills instead. However, when he was about to swallow those Tiger Form Pills and cultivate, his actions halted.

He summoned his Godly Mt. Xumi, Linglong Treasure Pagoda, Absolute Soul Pearl, and the God Binding Ring. He wanted to ask Xiaoniū if she knew the origin of these artifacts.

But who would have guessed the little cow would barely glanced at them before bluntly commenting: “All fakes.”

“Fakes?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes rounded in shock.

Xiaoniū nodded its head, “There really is a Godly Mt. Xumi in the universe, including that Linglong Treasure Pagoda, Absolute Soul Pearl, God Binding Ring, and other similar chaos divine artifacts. Each of them contains origin chaos qi and chaos divine formations. These playthings you have, forget origin chaos qi, they don’t even contain a wisp of turbid origin chaos qi.”

Huang Xiaolong was crestfallen looking at his collection, then Xiaoniū’s voice sounded in his ears. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Although these four divine artifacts of yours aren’t chaos divine artifacts, they are still something refined by Ancient God Realm masters, quite powerful. For example, the Godly Xumi Art from your Godly Mt. Xumi is quite powerful.” The little cow said.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head instead.

If it was any other Barbarian God Sect disciple who obtained divine artifacts refined by Ancient God Realm masters, they would probably be over the moon, but to Huang Xiaolong, it doesn’t count for much.

More importantly, if these were merely copies, where were the genuine ones? And how high was their power?

Huang Xiaolong remembered that old man he met while searching for the Godly Mt. Xumi and wondered who he was. Could he have been a big shot’s avatar from the Divine World?

Subsequently, he thought about the Fortune Gate’s Fang Chu. He had killed Fang Chu’s avatar, but he still had no idea what his real identity was in the Divine World...

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

In this short time, Huang Xiaolong had refined all ten thousand Tiger Form Pills, solidifying his Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm foundation. As for that drop of Blood Phoenix blood essence, he decided to wait until he returned from the Primordial Celestial Shrine. After all, there was no hurry.

When the time came, the Barbarian God Sect Ancestor Lu Zhuo personally led Huang Xiaolong and the other disciple towards the Primordial Celestial Shrine, which was located on a flat plain at the intersection between the three sects.
