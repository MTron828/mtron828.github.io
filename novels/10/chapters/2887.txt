Chapter 2888: Cosmos Energy!

When they saw that Yong Luosheng was back, everyone felt a trace of relief in their hearts.

“I knew it! How can a mere Primal Ancestor brat harm Brother Yong Luosheng?” Xu Xiaofeng chuckled. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

From what they could see, Yong Luosheng was unharmed, and his body was in perfect condition.

“What bullsh*t… World Harmony? He can’t even do a thing to Brother Yong Luosheng even if he managed to fuse with the world!” Han Tong sneered.

A calm expression hung on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Even though his previous strike was strong, he knew that it would be unable to seriously injure someone with two dao souls, nine high-order Saint Fates, and two peak-level bloodlines.

A Dao Venerable could temper their body with the cosmos energy produced by their small world, and their grand dao physiques were something Primal Ancestors would never be able to compare to. Even if Huang Xiaolong used the power of his own world, it would be difficult to smash Yong Luosheng to bits.

He hadn’t even used cosmos energy in his previous strike, and it was no wonder Yong Luosheng could still fly about.

If he really wanted to shatter Yong Luosheng’s grand dao physique, the cosmos energy from his two small worlds would do the trick.

Whatever the case, Yong Luosheng was merely putting on a strong front. There was no way getting hit by the previous attack hadn’t injured him in the slightest.

Even though he looked fine, the sword qi was currently wreaking havoc inside his body. He was only suppressing it with all the cosmos energy he could muster.

As he slowly descended from the skies, the sword qi that surrounded him became stronger and stronger. Another sea of sword qi surrounded him as traces of mysterious energy appeared from every part of his body.

The energy that emerged seemed to belong to another world, and it was something only Yong Luosheng could control.

“Cosmos energy!”

“Yong Luosheng is finally using his cosmos energy!”

There were half-step Dao Venerables who yelled when they noticed the change around him.

“Isn’t it a little humiliating for a First Esteem Dao Venerable to call out their cosmos energy when dealing with a Primal Ancestor?” someone in the crowd tutted.

Everyone knew that the reason Dao Venerables were supreme existences was because of the presence of cosmos energy. There was no way for a Primal Ancestor to challenge a Dao Venerable because they wouldn’t be able to get past the barrier of cosmos energy in the first place!

The difference between cosmos energy and grand dao energy was insurmountable. It didn’t matter how strong the grand dao energy was!

“Yong Luosheng’s cosmos energy is extremely pure! The small world in his body should have already reached the fifth level… It’s no wonder he’s the leader of the ten swords!” The Second Esteem Dao Venerable, who was scolding Huang Xiaolong earlier, sighed. “With his strength, he will definitely kill the brat in three moves or less!”

Xuanyuan Potian nodded his head slowly. He suppressed the shock in his heart, and the gaze in his eyes grew colder as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Regardless, the brat had to die today!

There was no way he could allow a threat like Huang Xiaolong to mature. As a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong had sent someone at Yong Luosheng’s level flying out of the sacred land! Even without using cosmos energy, Yong Luosheng was a force to be reckoned with.

If they allowed someone like Huang Xiaolong to enter the Dao Venerable Realm, the Xuanyuan Creed wouldn’t be able to deal with him even if they activated all their resources!

However, a trace of suspicion remained in his heart. Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong said to be a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor? Why was he a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor? Could the rumors be wrong?

The moment Yong Luosheng summoned his cosmos energy, the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World reacted in unison. Feng Yue spoke to the old expert beside her, “Elder Tong, if he runs into any trouble, you have to save him!”

“What about those from the Xuanyuan Creed?”

“Ignore them! We’ll deal with it when the time comes!” Feng Yue didn’t hesitate to throw the Lightning Tiger Prince’s threat to the back of her mind.

“Yes, Young lady.”

Yin Yue and Yu Yue ordered the Dao Venerables around them to do the same.

As cosmos energy poured out from Yong Luosheng’s body, the sword qi around him started to increase at a frightening pace.

Monarch Yu Sacred Land seemed to be shrouded by a storm of sword qi as terrifying waves of energy swept across the lands.

Under the might of Yong Luosheng’s cosmos energy and sword qi, Monarch Yu Sacred Land seemed to reach its limits.

Finally, Yong Luosheng’s aura peaked and his sword qi started to scatter.

As silence descended on the lands, only one voice could be heard booming through the skies.

“Dragon of Creation!”

Waving his arms in the air, sword qi poured out from Yong Luosheng’s body as though there was a never-ending supply. A dragon formed from sword qi stretched several dozen thousand miles long.

The moment it formed, the faces of everyone around changed. Every single Second Esteem Dao Venerable turned serious when they noticed the power continued in the strike.

Even someone blind would be able to feel the power contained behind the strike.

As the sword qi dragon formed, cosmos energy surged out from Yong Luosheng’s body and fused with it. In the next instant, the dragon, spanning thousands of miles, charged at Huang Xiaolong.

Buzz…

The hearts of everyone in Monarch Yu Sacred Land started to tremble under the might of the horrifying sword qi, and sword users no longer retained control over their swords as they flew out from their scabbards.

They couldn’t help but drop their jaws in shock.

“Fusing his sword intent, cosmos energy, and power from his dao souls, Yong Luosheng actually managed to complete his final strike!”

“Even mid-level Dao Venerables would find it hard to do something like this!”

Everyone couldn’t help but marvel over Yong Luosheng’s slash.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Under the combined might of Yong Luosheng’s dao souls, sword intent, and cosmos energy, the world seemed to shatter under the sheer power contained in his final slash.

Right before it could find its target, Huang Xiaolong casually raised his arm and stretched his fingers.

When Xuanyuan Potian saw what Huang Xiaolong was doing, he couldn’t help but sneer out loudly. “This brat is really planning to stop Yong Luosheng’s strike with the same move… He must be tired of living!”

“He’s probably a one-trick pony…” Han Tong sneered, “He can only use this move if he plans to show off! Hahaha! Whatever the case, this brat is really stupid. He can’t even recognize Yong Luosheng’s cosmos energy! He really thinks that he can take on the same move with the spatial energy he controls…”

Everyone burst into laughter.

As laughter rang through the air, Huang Xiaolong stretched out his hand, and a wave of mysterious energy pervaded the air. Like Yong Luosheng’s cosmos energy, the power Huang Xiaolong controlled flooded his surroundings.

It was streams of energy even purer than what Yong Luosheng had summoned!

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong as an explosion went off in their minds.

Even people at the level of Xuanyuan Potian, Feng Yue, Yu Yue, and Yin Yue couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Cosmos… Cosmos energy?!”

That was cosmos energy!

The Primal Ancestor Realm brat standing before them was wielding cosmos energy!

Moreover, it was purer than what Yong Luosheng could bring out! As for the power it contained, there was no need to compare a firefly to the moon.

As the attacker, Yong Luosheng’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

Boom!

As the heavens and earth trembled, the sword qi dragon slammed into a barrier formed from Huang Xiaolong’s cosmos energy. Like an unstoppable wall, Huang Xiaolong’s cosmos energy charged forward and shattered whatever remained of the sword qi dragon. A familiar scene played out as Yong Luosheng’s sword qi dragon was crushed to bits once again.

Looking at the sword qi dragon that was slowly crumbling, Yong Luosheng finally started to panic. Fear gripped his heart as his body turned icy cold.
