Chapter 3395: Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Goddess

The eyes of every single demon widened when they saw their weapons stopping in midair.

Huang Xiaolong flipped his hand once to send every single artifact flying back towards its user. As they smashed into each other, everyone fell from the skies.

Many of them slammed into the surrounding peaks, and others landed in the valley all around. Some fell into the lakes, and others crashed into the structures all around them.

Miserable cries rang through the air as dust clouds filled the skies.

It was as though armies of tens of millions of troops had clashed with one another, but the only problem was that the only army present was that of the demons. They were only facing a single opponent, but they couldn’t even put up a fight!

The artifacts that they used were nothing more than dust that remained on the ground, and whatever shards there were left were filled with cracks.

The Ice Rhino felt a sense of awe spreading through his veins. That was an entire army of tens of millions of demons! There were demon kings in the mix, and there were several demon ancestors at the Sage Realm as well!

Anyone who could enter the Goblin Mountain was an expert in their own right! All of them were demons who had peerless bloodlines! There were even many who were about to enter the Sage Realm! For example, the Tiger King and the Nine Tailed Fox King! They were the ancestors of an entire race!

The weakest among them was a Golden Immortal, and there were countless Immortal Emperors in the mix!

As for Sages, there were more than a dozen of them present.

Yet, all of them failed to take on a single blow from Huang Xiaolong.

Xi Jiu wasn’t the only one who was surprised. The demon ancestors like the Nine Tailed Fox King were equally shocked.

“Combined Dao Ancestor!” They stared at Huang Xiaolong with blood leaking from their lips.

They felt that he wasn’t an ordinary Combined Dao Ancestor.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Nine Tailed Fox King’s evaluation caused the hearts of many demons to tremble.

All of a sudden, a lady’s voice rang through the air. “Fellow Daoist Huang is so powerful. It’s no wonder you’re known as the Innate Devil Ancestor!”

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at two ladies who wore immortal robes standing in the air above. They were riding on clouds as they drifted slowly towards Huang Xiaolong and the rest. 

The Tiger King and the others forced themselves to their feet and bowed respectfully, “We greet the Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Goddess!”

They were the Heaven Piercing Sage’s students, and Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised to see them there.

Since a long time ago, the Heaven Piercing Sage, Nuwa, Laozi, Yuanshi, Zhunti, and Jieyin had been receiving teachings from Hong Jun. The two of them could be considered somewhat related to Goddess Nuwa in that sense.

“Please rise.” The two of them nodded casually.

Next, they turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with serious expressions on their faces.

“Did Fellow Daoist Huang come all the way over here to look for us? Is there anything we can help you with?” the Tortoise Spirit Goddess asked.

“I heard that your master has the Pangu Axe.” 

The two of them stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, and so did everyone else.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t state his intentions outright, everyone could tell that he wanted to obtain the Pangu Axe!

Strange expressions filled the faces of those present.

They didn’t dare to believe that Huang Xiaolong was actually plotting against the Heaven Piercing Sage!

He might be strong, but he seemed a little too full of himself!

The Heaven Piercing Sage was someone who had existed for countless years! He was one of Hong Jun’s most treasured disciples, and he was one of the earliest Sages in the Pangu World!

Even the Heaveless Devil Ancestor had to lower his head when speaking to the Heaven Piercing Sage!

Out of all of Hong Jun’s disciples, the Heaven Piercing Sage possessed the greatest amount of fame! In the past, he had killed so many people with his Immortal Punishing Sword that the three worlds would tremble at the mere mention of his name!

The faces of the two goddesses sank when they heard that Huang Xiaolong planned to mess with their master. “The number of people who covet my master’s axe cannot be counted, but none of them dares to make a move. Even the Heavenless Devil Ancestor isn’t brave enough to do it. I’m afraid that Fellow Daoist Huang wouldn’t dare to make a move even if my master appears right now.”

One of the Goddesses was belittling Huang Xiaolong. After all, there weren’t many people who would dare to fight the Heaven Piercing Sage.

Not even the Heavenless Devil Ancestor would dare to fight the man head-on.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in amusement. It seemed as though he had overestimated the intelligence of everyone in the Pangu World. He wouldn’t be getting rid of his identity as the Innate Devil Ancestor any time soon.

“Alright. You can make your move now.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “I’ll give you a chance. If you manage to resist a single strike from me, I’ll give you this grand dao spiritual vein.”

A spiritual vein comparable to the size of an immortal dragon appeared above Huang Xiaolong. It was several hundred thousand miles long, and it swirled about in the heavens above.

“Grand dao vein!”

The goddesses exclaimed in shock.

The demon kings who were present felt the world spinning around them.

“That’s right. This is a high-grade grand dao spiritual vein,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

High-grade grand dao spiritual vein!

Gulping down a mouthful of saliva, no one could believe what they were seeing.

It had been a long time since the goddesses were so tempted to obtain something.

Looking at each other, the two of them came to an agreement.

“Are you serious?” the Tortoise Spirit Goddess asked.

They wondered if Huang Xiaolong would allow them to work together.

The two of them knew that they were no match for Huang Xiaolong, but all they had to do was to resist a single attack from the man! They were confident of dragging out a battle with him if they joined hands, not to mention defending themselves from a single strike.

“That’s right. As long as you manage to defend yourself from a single attack, I’ll give you the grand dao spiritual vein. Moreover, I’ll leave you alone,” Huang Xiaolong uttered.

“Alright.” A horrifying aura emerged from the Wudang Goddess’ body the moment she spoke. Grand dao laws filled the area as the power of a dao ancestor filled the lands.

“Combined Dao Ancestor!” The Ice Rhino screamed in shock.

When the Tortoise Spirit Goddess released her aura next, everyone could feel that she was slightly stronger than the Wudang Goddess.

The Ice Rhino’s jaws dropped, and he was flabbergasted.

…

“I wonder which dao ancestor appeared! That’s a terrifying aura!”

“It seems to come from the Goblin Mountain!”

The experts in the northern region felt the change clearly, and many of them were frightened by the sudden change.

The Nine Tailed Fox King and the others felt the reverence they had for the two goddesses growing stronger.

Next, a multi-colored stone appeared above the Wudang Goddess’ head, and it emitted rays of blinding light.

“Sky Mending Five Colored Rock?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in amusement.

The Pangu World had once experienced a calamity that caused the world to crumble. Goddess Nuwa had managed to refine a slab of Sky Mending Five Colored Rock, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect her to give a piece of it to the Wudang Goddess. 

The Sky Mending Five Colored Rock was a famous treasure, and a single piece of it managed to create an existence at the level of Sun Wukong! One could only imagine how precious it was.

“That’s right! This is the Sky Mending Five Colored Rock!” The Wudang Goddess yelped haughtily. The Sky Mending Five Colored Rock she used was one that was refined from grand dao energy. When Nuwa mended the heavens and gave life to countless creatures, the grand dao laws and grand dao energy that were used had fused into the piece the Wudang Goddess was using.
