Chapter 3501: Chen Kezhi Loses Control

“No! The Dragon’s Impasse is too dangerous!” Huang Long shook his head when he saw how adamant Huang Xiaolong was.

“Father, you can relax. I am confident that I’ll get out alive,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Staring at his son in shock, Huang Long sighed, “How sure are you?”

“Probably eighty percent…” Huang Xiaolong replied after thinking about it for a second. Even though he had all four universe origin fires, nothing was set in stone. He wasn’t certain that he would be able to leave the Dragon’s Impasse, but he estimated that he had an eighty percent chance to exit. After all, Huang Xiaolong witnessed the might of the origin flames throughout the years. They saved him more than once during his journey.

“Eighty percent?!” Huang Long stared at him in shock. “Are you sure?!”

Lu Qianqian and the others were equally as shocked. It was especially so for Lu Qianqian, the native of the Star Dragon Universe.

“Brother Xiaolong, the Dragon’s Impasse is more difficult than you can imagine,” Lu Qianqian advised. “There are universe storms everywhere, and hurricanes filled with universe source energy sweep through the land. The space within isn’t steady, and even Gods of Creation would need to use up a lot of energy in order to escape once they are swallowed up by the spatial cracks…”

“The principal once said that even if he went to the Dragon’s Impasse, he would have less than a fifty percent chance of returning alive.”

Wang Meiqi and the others stared at her in shock. The second strongest expert in the Star Dragon Universe, Yu Long, didn’t even have a fifty percent chance of returning!

They finally understood how terrifying the Dragon’s Impasse was.

“Xiaolong, if Yu Long isn’t confident of coming back alive, you better drop the idea.” Huang Long shook his head. He couldn’t accept putting his son in danger just to accomplish a task in the Submerged Dragon Institution.

Moreover, he wouldn’t be taking a small risk when he chose to do the mission.

Huang Xiaolong burst out laughing when he saw the look of doubt on their faces. “Relax. When I say that I’m eighty percent sure of making it out alive, I’m not exaggerating.”

After Huang Xiaolong’s insistence, Huang Long could only agree.

He knew that even if he refused to let Huang Xiaolong accept the mission, the kid wouldn’t listen to him anyway.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong accepted the mission to retrieve a piece of dragon scale from the Dragon’s Impasse. As the elder of the Mission Hall escorted them out, they left for Lu Qianqian’s manor.

Along their way back, they were met with weird gazes from many students.

“Seems like Shan Fei’s fate has already made its rounds around the institute,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Shan Fei is the leading disciple of the institute, and it’s not surprising for the news to spread so quickly.” Lu Qianqian paused for a second and continued, “You will need to take note of the retaliation from the Enforcement Hall. Shan Fei’s power in the institute isn’t low, and the Enforcement Hall will definitely try to stick their nose into this.”

Long Yi was the first to grin when he heard about the retaliation. “Since His Highness didn’t break the rules of the institution, the Enforcement Hall wouldn’t be able to do anything. If they come, we’ll throw them out! Even if that old man Yu Long stands on their side, we won’t be afraid of them!”

Lu Qianqian shook her head and sighed, “Hall Master Chen Kezhi is a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. He has always been an unreasonable person, and he will catch everyone he feels like! No one dares to stand up to him! There was a teacher who tried resisting arrest in the past, and he crippled his dao veins and sealed his bloodline! He threw the teacher into the dark abyss for several million years, and till this day, the teacher hasn’t been released.”

Lu Qianqian frowned.

In fact, Lu Qianqian knew that Pangu was a God of Creation. However, she had no idea how strong he truly was. If she did, she wouldn’t be worried about any of them!

After all, Pangu could toy with a mere expert at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. What was there to be afraid of?”

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong and the others were of a different mind. All of them chuckled in amusement.

“How much grand cosmos energy has Chen Kezhi accumulated?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“I…. I have no idea.” Lu Qianqian lowered her head and muttered, “However, he seems to have entered the grand completion stage for several hundred million years.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. After entering the God of Creation Realm, one wouldn’t be able to improve as rapidly as before. It was even worse for someone at the grand completion stage, and Huang Xiaolong estimated Chen Kezhi to possess 7 to 7.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

When they returned, Pangu emerged from the courtyard and barked at Huang Xiaolong, “Little brat! It’s been less than two days since you came here! Why are you causing trouble everywhere?!”

After he spoke, a trace of a smile formed on his lips.

It went without saying that he was referring to Shan Fei.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “It doesn’t matter… After all, you’re here to take care of it. We have nothing to worry about.”

Huang Long and the others burst out laughing.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, Pangu’s mood changed when he learned that Huang Xiaolong chose to enter the Dragon’s Impasse.

He stared at Huang Xiaolong for a second and snapped, “Preposterous!”

It was clear he felt the same way as Huang Long when he learned about the mission.

“Huang Long, why didn’t you stop this little brat when he decided to go crazy?” He turned to Huang Long and frowned.

A bitter smile appeared on Huang Long’s face and he sighed, “I did! This kid refuses to listen to me! According to him, he has an eighty percent chance of returning from the Dragon’s Impasse.”

“Eighty percent?!” Pangu turned to look at Huang Xiaolong with a strange look on his face.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

After falling silent for a moment, Pangu sighed, “Alright. I won’t stop you if that’s the case. However, you need to be on your toes the moment you enter.”

He understood Huang Xiaolong a little more than Huang Long, and he knew that Huang Xiaolong still had a lot of hidden cards on him. He shouldn’t be exaggerating about his chances of returning alive. After all, he knew that Huang Xiaolong was someone who always liked to play things safe.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong decided to leave for the Dragon’s Impasse the very next day.

As everything went down in Lu Qianqian’s residence, Chen Kezhi looked at Shan Fei who was kneeling before him. Shan Fei pleaded with him to take Huang Xiaolong down.

Shan Fei’s masters were not in the Submerged Dragon Institution at the moment, but Chen Kezhi was a friend of theirs. It was especially so for his elder master.

“Get up.” Chen Kezhi helped Shan Fei’s dao soul up as a cold expression hung on his face. “Rest assured. I’ll ensure that he suffers the same fate as you.”

Jumping in joy, Shan Fei thanked Chen Kezhi.

“Go investigate Huang Xiaolong’s whereabouts,” Chen Kezhi spoke to one of the grand elders beside him.

“Lord Chen Kezhi, Huang Xiaolong entered Lu Qianqian’s palace, and he hasn’t left.” The grand elder quickly returned with the information.

“Lu Qianqian?!” Chen Kezhi was stunned.

“Yes. It’s said that Huang Xiaolong is Lu Qianqian’s foster father’s inheritance disciple.” The grand elder continued, “Huang Xiaolong came to the institute with her foster father the day before, and they clashed with a core disciple, Shen Shijie, at the entrance to the inner courtyard.”

“What?! Huang Xiaolong is that guy’s inheritance disciple?!” Chen Kezhi leaped to his feet in shock as he lost control of his emotions.

He was beaten up really badly by Pangu in the past, and he knew how fierce Pangu really was. If not for Yu Long showing up to save his life, he might not even be alive right now.
