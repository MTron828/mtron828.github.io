Under Huang Xiaolong’s consecutive attacks, Lightning Beast Valley’s Ancestors tumbled to the ground one after another.

These Lightning Beast Valley’s Ancestors either died under the Blood Eye Devil Stele’s power as they were shrunken down to their bones, or they got completely corroded under the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s curse power. Others died by turning into glass statues under the Glaze Devil Stele’s power.

And soon, the sixty-plus Lightning Beast Valley’s Ancestors were reduced to twenty or so.

Everything happened too fast, and it took only less than thirty breaths.

Far away, Violent Lightning Archdevil, who was entangled by the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels, was bellowing with rage when he noticed the situation on Huang Xiaolong’s side. It was as if someone was cutting off the flesh of his heart, layer by layer.

All these were Emperor Realm Ancestors, ah! Each one was nurtured and cultivated by many resources, and each of them had taken the Lightning Beast Valley’s numerous spirit stones, pills, and spiritual herbs.

At times, one Emperor Realm Ancestor had been hard to come by in a million years.

But now, Huang Xiaolong was slaughtering these Lightning Beast Valley’s Ancestors as if they were worth nothing.

One-sided slaughter!

“Huang Xiaolong! You son-of-a-b*tch!” Violent Lightning Archdevil roared anxiously, “F*ck your mother, you bastard! I’m going to chop you into pieces!”

“The day will come when you will fall into my hands. I’ll make you beg on your knees for me to end your life!”

The air shook with Violent Lightning Archdevil’s crazed and outraged roars. Curses flew out from his mouth without any image. At this time, the Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie, the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor Chen Xie, and the others were flabbergasted by his behavior.

Although the Black Killer Sect and Hundred Transformation Sect’s experts were being suppressed by the Three Skull Ancestors and a group of Ice Dragons, their situations were better than the Lightning Beast Valley, especially the Black Killer Sect’s experts.

Even though the Three Skull Ancestors were strong, they merely fought to a draw against the several hundred Black Killer Sect’s Ancestors.

Minutes passed by, and Huang Xiaolong wiped off the remaining twenty-plus Lightning Beast Valley’s low-level Emperor Realm Ancestors.

Huang Xiaolong remained cold and indifferent as he looked at the Lightning Beast Valley’s Ancestors’ corpses strewn all over the ground. Violent Lightning Archdevil’s veins were throbbing, and he was wishing nothing more than tearing Huang Xiaolong into pieces with his bare hands.

But under the two fourteen-winged Radiance Angels’ constant attacks, Violent Lightning Archdevil gradually fell into a disadvantageous sorry state.

Violent Lightning Archdevil’s cursing fell on deaf ears as Huang Xiaolong turned his attention towards the Black Killer Sect’s side. Seeing the Three Skull Ancestors’ situation, he joined in the fray in a flicker.

“Kill Huang Xiaolong!”

One of the Eight Order Emperor Realm Black Killer Sect’s Ancestors spotted Huang Xiaolong flying over with the three devil steles and was overjoyed. He slashed at Huang Xiaolong with the blade in his hand and shouted to his comrades at the same time.

However, the City of Eternity within Huang Xiaolong’s body flew out, smashing the Black Killer Sect’s Eighth Order Emperor Realm Ancestor into a pulp.

Even before the Black Killer Sect’s Eighth Order Emperor Realm Ancestor fell to the ground, his corpse was already unrecognizable. Hence, no one saw the shocked expression on his face.

Other Black Killer Sect’s Ancestors who were intending to attack Huang Xiaolong shuddered and swiftly backed away. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, Huang Xiaolong had already jumped in the middle of the Black Killer Sect’s Ancestors, swinging his fist. In a split second, a late-Third Order Emperor Realm Ancestor was sent flying high into the air.

At the same time, under one hundred Undead Netherguards’ control, the City of Eternity continued to slam onto the other Black Killer Sect’s mid-level and high-level Emperor Realm Ancestors.

The Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie was incensed after seeing Huang Xiaolong kill four Black Killer Sect’s Ancestors in a few seconds. He was like a wolf that had run into a flock of sheep. He hollered, “Whoever kills Huang Xiaolong, that person will be my Black Killer Sect’s Deputy Sect Chief, and stand above million others, under one person!”

As expected, Cui Huajie’s words roused everyone’s motivation. The Black Killer Sect’s Emperor Realm Ancestors, who were retreating after seeing the City of Eternity, renewed their attacks on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly, watching this. Want to kill me?

At this point, even if the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming were to be here, he wouldn’t be able to kill him, much less this Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie and his sect’s Ancestors.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, watching the Black Killer Sect’s high-level Ancestors targeting him. With a turn of his body, he transformed into a ten-thousand zhang long divine dragon. At the same time, ten Netherguard captains appeared by Huang Xiaolong’s side to help him parry the Black Killer Sect’s high-level Emperor Realm Ancestors’ attacks.

The moment Huang Xiaolong transformed into a ten-thousand zhang long divine dragon. The hill-sized dragon claw reached out and grabbed, easily catching two Black Killer Sect’s early Fourth Order Emperor Realm Ancestors. Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw tightened over them. Immediately, blood-curdling screams cut across the air. Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw crushed the two Emperor Realm experts and even shattered their godheads and bones into pieces!

Others nearby gasped in apprehension. Even Chiyou was astonished. After all, Huang Xiaolong had broken through to early First Order Emperor Realm not too long ago. In his dragon form, he actually could kill a Fourth Order Emperor Realm expert like he was killing a chicken?

Before anyone could react, Huang Xiaolong’s dragon tail swept across the land, knocking several of the Black Killer Sect’s Third Order and Fourth Order Emperor Realm Ancestors into the air.

As Chiyou and Huang Xiaolong’s sides battled, the surrounding one hundred million li radius; no, one billion li radius was reduced to ruins by turbulent destructive powers. Mountains crumbled, fissures ran across the land, the mountainous terrains disappeared into plains, ancient city ruins resurfaced to the ground, and dead winding rivers were cut off in multiple sections.

Although this intense battle was taking place in the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield’s central region, it still alerted the experts that continued to enter through the space tunnel.

The experts approaching by flight were startled and halted abruptly after sensing the strong fluctuations of destructive power.

“... Are Sovereign experts battling to the death?!”

“Other than Sovereign experts, there are several hundred Emperors as well!”

“Could it be, two of the Kingdom of Devil Beasts’ top masters are in a life and death battle?”

“Even if that is the case, none of the empires have so many Emperor Realm Ancestors!”

Various forces’ experts discussed heatedly.

Indeed, even the strongest force in the Kingdom of Devil Beasts, the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire, did not have so many Emperor Realm Ancestors.

Some of the high-level Emperor Realm experts once again approached cautiously, relying on the confidence towards their own strengths.

Even so, these high-level Emperor Realm experts merely dared to watch from far away.

“That, why are there so many Ice Dragons?!”

These high-level Emperor Realm experts were rendered agape seeing the palpitating ice cold qi that covered a piece of heaven and earth, formed by the seventy-plus Ice Dragons.

“Fourteen-winged Radiance Angels!”

“The Undead Race!”

“That one, that person who is besieged by the four giants, looks like Chiyou Archdevil Ancestor!”

After a while, these spectators sucked in a breath of cold air as they got a better understanding of the battle taking place in front of them.

Huang Xiaolong’s dragon roar at this time attracted everyone’s attention. His claws slammed down, burying two Black Killer Sect’s Fourth Order Emperor Realm Ancestors deep into the ground.

Everyone’s gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

“This Dragon Race kid is only an early First Order Emperor Realm?! But he could kill Fourth Order Emperor Realm experts.”

Everyone was dumbfounded at the disparity.

“He, he’s not a Dragon Race!”

Suddenly, one of the Ancestors shouted as he remembered something that made his complexion pale.

Not a Dragon Race?

As if to prove that Ancestor’s words, Huang Xiaolong suddenly shook his head, and in the blink of an eye, he reverted to his human form.

“It’s him, the Nether King!”

His Majesty, the Nether King!

The other Ancestors’ heart skipped a beat.

After reverting to his human form, the heart of hell in his chest emitted dazzling rays of black light, and a resounding ‘thump’ exploded in the entire Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield space.
