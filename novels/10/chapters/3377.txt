Chapter 3378: Origins of the Holy Pavilion

Standing before the Holy Pavilion, they saw a giant structure reaching straight into the clouds.

“Did you say that six sages established the Holy Pavilion?” Huang Xiaolong asked casually.

“That’s right, Senior Huang.” Mu Shuihan replied respectfully. “It was created by the Great Sage, Heaven Pacifying Sage, Ocean Reversing Sage, Mountain Shifting Sage, Purification Sage, and the Heaven Smearing Sage!”

“Oh? Great Sage Sun Wukong?!” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

He definitely heard of Sun Wukong before.

At the same time, he knew that the other five were Sun Wukong’s sworn brothers. The Heaven Pacifying Sage was the Bull Demon King, the Ocean Reversing Sage was the Salamander Demon King, the Mountain Shifting Sage was the Camel Demon King, the Purification Sage was the Elephant Demon King, and the Heaven Smearing Sage was the Roc Demon King! All of them were existences comparable to Sun Wukong!

“Yes, Senior Huang. The six sages are sworn brothers, and they created the Holy Pavilion at the height of their strength.”

“Sworn brothers?” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Their bond doesn’t seem that strong to me.”

When Sun Wukong and the Bull Demon King fell out with each other, their battle caused the heavens to shake and the earth to tremble.

An awkward smile formed on Mu Shuihan’s face.

Entering the Holy Pavilion, Huang Xiaolong was greeted by a disciple of the Holy Pavilion immediately.

Mu Shuihan followed closely behind Huang Xiaolong.

“I am Mu Shuihan of the Shushan Immortal Gate. I am here to discuss something with your branch director. Please make the report.” Mu Shuihan said.

“Mu Shuihan?! The old ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate!” People in the hall gasped after hearing his name.

“What?! He’s the ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate?! That’s the genius of our Northern Dragon Region right there!”

“I heard that he has the talent to become a sage in the future!”

The hall was filled with commotion in an instant.

The hundreds of experts in the main hall stared at Mu Shuihan in shock. It was evident that his reputation preceded him in the Northern Dragon Region.

For an expert to reach the peak of the late-Ninth Level Grand Gathering Immortal Realm in eighty thousand short years, it was a legend in itself.

Moreover, Mu Shuihan cultivated in the way of the sword. His offensive abilities were much stronger than experts of the same realm. When he hadn't reached the Grand Gathering Immortal Realm, he was able to defeat Grand Gathering Immortals! He defeated two of them at once, marking his rise to fame!

There was a Holy Emperor who once said that Mu Shuihan was sure to become a sage in the future, causing an abrupt rise in his status. Due to this remark, experts of the other regions started paying attention to him.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“As it turns out, Ancestor Mu is here. Please wait a moment while I inform the branch master.” The manager of the Holy Pavilion branch said to Mu Shuihan.

Gesturing for Huang Xiaolong to proceed, Mu Shuihan bowed, “Senior Huang, please.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony as he took the lead.

The experts standing around sucked in a cold breath when they noticed the small gesture.

“Who is that guy? Even Ancestor Mu is so respectful to him… Could he be an Immortal King?” Someone guessed.

“Immortal King?! No way!”

The birth of a new Immortal King in the Northern Dragon Region was something that could shake up the entire region.

When they entered the inner hall, the manager left the room quickly to make the report. Huang Xiaolong turned to Mu Shuihan and smiled, “You’re pretty famous…”

A shy look appeared on Mu Shuihan’s face and he lowered his head. “I’m nowhere near Senior Huang’s strength.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “There’s no need for you to look down on yourself. WIth your talent, you’ll be able to reach the Combined Dao Ancestor Realm in the future as long as you work hard.”

Mu Shuihan felt his heart palpitating and he bowed, “Yes! Junior will remember what Senor Huang said and I’ll work hard in my cutivation!”

In fact, there was something Huang Xiaolong didn’t say. Even if hundreds of Combined Dao Ancestors came, he would be able to kill them off with a single strike.

“I wonder if Hong Jun is currency in the Purple Heaven Palace…” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

If he could find the Pangu Axe and cultivate the Pangu World Creation Art, he would be able to enter the God of Creation Realm! When that happened, he wanted to have a good fight with Hong Jun!

When Huang Xiaolong was wondering about various questions, a clear laughter broke the silence as a well-built man entered the inner hall.

The robes on his body were embroidered with six great demons, and it went without saying that they were pictures of the six sages.

“Brother Shuihan, you should have told me before coming. I’ll personally head over to welcome you!”

The person who spoke was the director of the branch pavilion, Du Yan!

Mu Shuihan got to his feet and laughed, “Forget it! Hahaha! I wouldn’t dare to inconvenience you!”

It was obvious that the two of them shared a close bond from the way they bantered with each other.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the two of them quietly.

“Brother Shuihan, this is…” Du Yan’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong. He received a report from his subordinates that Mu Shuihan called the young man sitting down ‘Senior Huang’, and he was extremely curious about the youngster’s status.

“This is Senior Huang!” Mu Shuihan introduced immediately.

He didn’t say anything more than that.

Du Yan was even more surprised by his reaction. Clearly, Mu Shuihan couldn’t say any more due to Huang Xiaolong’s desire to keep his status a secret.

“I apologize for any disrespect.” Do Yan cupped his fists towards Huang Xiaolong.

As the branch director of the Holy Pavilion, his status was higher than most people in the Immortal Word. After all, his backers were the six sages! Not even a Immortal King could get him to bow and scrape

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly and said, “I’m here today to buy some information. You don’t have to worry about the price.”

“I wonder what Senior Huang wishes to know about.” Du Yan was slightly started in his heart.

“I’m looking for the Pangu Sword, and I heard that it’s in the hands of the Heaven Piercing Sage.”

Hesitating slightly, Du Yan continued, “This…”

A branch director like him couldn’t make the decision to look into a sage. If the Heavenly Piercing Sage learns that the Holy Pavilion revealed his whereabouts, his rage wasn’t something Du Yan could hold off.

“I know it’s tough to look for the Heaven Piercing Sage. As such, I only require you to look for his disciples.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “I’ll give you this pill as payment.” Huang Xiaolong placed a jade case on the table after speaking.

Looking at Mu Shuihan, Du Yan frowned before cautiously opening the jade case. Grand dao qi filled the inner hall in an instant.

“Grand dao pill!” Du Yan jumped in fright.

“That’s right. As long as you manage to locate the four of them, this pill is yours to keep.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I’ll give you another one after the job is done.”
