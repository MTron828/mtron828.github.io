Chapter 2975: Perfection State Absolute Frost Power

Just as Old Monster Flame, Black Shadow Devil, and others entered the Blue Lotus Pond, the entire Divine Tuo Holy World’s grand daos became agitated, like bubbling boiling water. It was especially so for grand daos within and around the Blue Lotus Pond as the space trembled violently for a split second.

Everyone within the Blue Lotus Pond felt these movements. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Faces tightened tensely.

“This is?!” Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng was aghast. This phenomenon had happened a few times in the last several hundred years, so they were too familiar with it. During the past several times, they had predicted that there was a terrifying monster gestating in the Divine Tuo Holy World, which had caused the Divine Tuo Holy World’s grand daos to react violently.

“It’s the Blue Lotus Pond?!” Wu Kun’s head turned towards the Blue Lotus Pond as he exclaimed. In all previous times, they were unable to sense the source of the disturbance, but this time, they felt it clearly, and the source was within the Blue Lotus Pond area!

There’s a terrifying creature gestating inside the Blue Lotus Pond?!

The Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingye, and others also turned abruptly to look at the Blue Lotus Pond with solemn expressions.

The Divine Tuo Holy World’s grand daos roared, and the Blue Lotus Pond’s immediate space seemed to jerk forward as an indescribable aura enveloped the Divine Tuo Holy World. Everyone felt their breaths getting sucked out of them, and even peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables felt something pressing down on their chests, making them feel extremely uncomfortable.

“This overwhelming might?!” The Silver Shadow Creed Patriarch Zeng Lin looked extremely solemn.

“Master, this, could something have happened inside the Blue Lotus Pond?” Yin Yue was very worried, as she remembered that her master had once told her that the heavens were going to change.

An obscured silver light flashed in Patriarch Zeng Lin’s eyes as if his gaze was trying to penetrate through the Blue Lotus Pond’s barrier and numerous restrictions and see through everything, “There are changes inside the Blue Lotus Pond!”

Noticing her master’s deeply furrowed brows, Yin Yue was immediately anxious. “Master, if there are changes inside the Blue Lotus Pond, won’t Xiaolong be in danger?”

Zeng Lin was stumped by her question. A moment later, he shook his head, “I don’t know, His Highness has Huang Long Bloodline and the Huang Long Armor, so he should be fine.”

On the other hand, Poison Bodach and the others who had entered the Blue Lotus Pond were also alarmed by the sudden changes in the grand dao energy. The Blue Lotus Pond that had always been calm as a mirror surface was rippling, and the powerful water-attributed restrictions all-around became all the more scarier in the next moment. The usually serene surroundings were suddenly charged with a surging undercurrent, and a strong sense of unease of doom inexplicably rose in everyone’s heart.

“What’s going on?!” The Stonemen Race Patriarch Shi Dan blurted out in alarm, “Is a monstrous creature going to break out from his Blue Lotus Pond?”

“Poison Bodach, perhaps, we should retreat and wait outside?” The Nine-headed Tree Demon suppressed the ominous feeling in his chest and suggested. The foreboding feeling inside the Blue Lotus Pond was greatly disturbing.

Poison Bodach frowned because truthfully, he had the same feeling, which was very uncomfortable.

“Yes, we should go out first,” Sword Venerable agreed loudly, “We’ll wait outside. Once this abnormal phenomenon stops, we’ll come in again to search for Huang Xiaolong that brat. He won’t be able to escape us anyways. Because of these abnormal changes, the surrounding restrictions have become stronger and the space is unstable, so this makes finding that brat more difficult.”

“Alright.” Poison Bodach nodded his head in agreement.

Upon reaching an agreement, Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and the rest exited the Blue Lotus Pond.

Seeing this, other experts quickly retreated out from the Blue Lotus Pond. In the end, even Old Monster Flame and Black Shadow Devil also chose to exit.

But several years went by, and this abnormal phenomenon continued The ominous dooming feeling grew stronger, forcing the experts guarding around the Blue Lotus Pond’s entrance to back away by several times to reduce the suffocation in their chests. Even Poison Bodach, Old Monster Flame, Black Shadow Devil, Sword Venerable, and other Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts had backed a far distance away.

This seemed to be the only way to ease the suffocation they felt.

Almost another ten years later, the abnormal phenomenon began to slow down. Grand dao energy and space were no longer churning and unsteady.

Everything fully returned to calmness about half a month later. Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and the others cautiously entered the Blue Lotus Pond again.

They found out that everything inside the Blue Lotus Pond had been restored to normal, and there was calm and quiet as it had always been.

At this time, inside the space filled with blue lotus nectar, the shining Sun Moon Furnace flickered unsteadily. The Heart Devourer Twin Devils, the Eye Frost Race’s experts, and those fierce beasts Huang Xiaolong had subjugated, persistently sent cosmos energy into the Sun Moon Furnace.

And through the Sun Moon Furnace, their cosmos energies flowed vigorously into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded by crackling streaks of lightning, and the dragon of creation was like a pillar propping up the sky. Huang Long World’s origin energy came pouring down, and the Tree of Beginning’s beginning qi rolled down like a curtain of ethereal fog, wrapping around Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s momentum rose like tides that never receded, and his strength had risen exponentially. He was much stronger than before, and he had entered late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

Another ten years came and went by.

The lightning streaks around Huang Xiaolong gradually dissipated, and the overwhelming aura from his body converged back into his body.

Space fluctuations stopped as Huang Xiaolong’s opened his eyes. He has finally entered Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm after refining the eight-seeded, nine-seeded, and ten-seeded blue lotuses!

After absorbing the absolute frost power within the ten-seeded blue lotus, his absolute frost power had finally entered the perfection state.

This ten-seeded blue lotus was the first blue lotus growing in this Blue Lotus Pond. It was almost as old as the Blue Lotus Pond itself, and it had absorbed the Blue Lotus Pond’s water energy over a long period of time that had evolved into the power of absolute frost. The absolute frost energy within the blue lotus had greatly exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s imagination, and if it wasn’t for that, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t tell how many years it would have taken for his absolute frost power to reach perfection.

At the moment his absolute frost power reached completion did Huang Xiaolong realize how difficult it was to raise one’s absolute power to perfection state. Though it was not as hard as ascending to the heavens, it was almost the same.

His dao souls’ senses spread out, displaying the entire Blue Lotus Pond in his mind.

There were intricate layers of space within the Blue Lotus Pond that were further hindered by numerous restrictions, and not even late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables could see the entire Blue Lotus Pond situation like Huang Xiaolong!

Under Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls, Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, Old Monster Flame, and even the Black Shadow Devil’s actions and words were all seen by Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong sneered. It’s harvest time!

It must have been difficult for Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and others to have waited so long for him, so he naturally couldn’t disappoint them.

Without much effort, Huang Xiaolong appeared outside the Sun Moon Furnace. He then collected the Sun Moon Furnace and all the remaining blue lotus nectar in the space. He sent the Twin Devourer Heart Devils, and the rest back into the dragon pearl before leaving the space.

In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong appeared behind a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

“Who?!” The late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable reacted immediately, but just as he turned, icy blue absolute frost power dominated his sight. Wherever the extreme icy blue light passed, everything was sealed in ice.

Watching the late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable sealed in an instant, Huang Xiaolong also restrained his dao souls and small worlds’ cosmos energy, then threw the expert into the dragon pearl.

A late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert was resolved!
