Thus, Huang Xiaolong extended his stay at the Lin Family Fort.

During the day, he would go through the manuals and anecdotes he collected from the Zhenyu Sect treasury while at night he’d take out one of the Ancient God Realm godheads and cultivate as he absorbed the godforce within.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong would make it a point to accompany Yao Chi during the day, whether it was visiting the nearby cities or just taking a stroll around the Lin Family Fort.

Occasionally, he would give Yao Chi some advice in regards to her cultivation.

The problem was, Huang Xiaolong felt there were too many flaws in Yao Chi’s fundamental cultivation technique and therefore it was inadequate. At most, Yao Chi could only practice it until she broke through to Ancient God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong then went to the little cow and requested a cultivation technique suitable for Yao Chi.

The cultivation technique taken out by Xiaoniū was called《Goddess of the Nine Heavens Divine Art》. According to the little cow, if Yao Chi could cultivate this technique to the highest realm, she would be considered a hegemon in the entire Divine World, with almost no rival.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t decide if the little cow was bragging or not.

Still, with his own judgment, he could see that this cultivation method was quite good indeed, many times better than what he had seen in the Barbarian God Sect, Golden Dragon Gate, and Zhenyu Sect.

Even the Golden Dragon Divine Art he obtained from the golden dragon pearl seemed second-rate compared to this Goddess of the Nine Heavens Divine Art.

Other than a cultivation technique for Yao Chi, Huang Xiaolong also acquired another technique from the little cow, something called the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

After cultivating this technique, one could condense grandmist parasites with their godforce, and through these parasites control other people.

Huang Xiaolong had gradually noticed that his combination of Ancient Puppetry Technique and Soul Mandate used to control others was too much of a hassle. Even if his cultivation was higher, it still required the other person’s cooperation to voluntarily allow Huang Xiaolong to send his soul mark inside to brand their godhead, otherwise, it was pointless.

But with this Grandmist Parasitic Medium, things would be much more convenient.

The grandmist parasites condensed from Huang Xiaolong’s godforce could ignore the soul’s protective barrier as well as divine armor’s defenses, entering the intended person’s body before merging with their soul and godhead.

However, according to the little cow, the Grandmist Parasite Medium was a difficult technique to learn, not only did it require the cultivator to possess a supreme rank godhead, but also a high comprehension ability.

Huang Xiaolong had a supreme rank godhead and was confident that his comprehension ability wasn’t bad... until he started cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Only then had Huang Xiaolong understood what the little cow meant by hard to learn.

After one month’s worth of attempts, he barely grasped the first stage of the technique, in fact, it was no exaggeration saying that he only had one foot over the door.

There was still a long road until he could condense a grandmist parasite with his godforce, not to mention that he needed to reach the second stage to do so.

When Huang Xiaolong shared his miserable progress with Xiaoniū, it spurted out the godhead it was crunching in shock.

Its eyes looked at Huang Xiaolong up and down with a strange expression, “I say, Master, do you think this Grandmist Parasitic Medium is the same as the Golden Dragon Divine Art or the Barbarian God Divine Art? That kind of garbage level techniques? You want to master the first stage in a short one month? Heavens have mercy on me, do you know how long it took the Grandmist King that created this technique to master the first stage? Over one thousand years!”

“Over a thousand years!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened to his brows, beyond astonished.

The little cow continued with a very serious expression, “That’s right, over a thousand years. Moreover, as far as I know, other than the Grandmist King himself, there is only one other person who successfully cultivated this technique, so, if you succeed as well, you’ll be the third person in this whole wide world.”

Ripples of shock struck Huang Xiaolong’s heart, “In the whole world, only two people succeeded? Didn’t you say that as long as the person has a supreme rank godhead they can cultivate this Grandmist Parasitic Medium?”

There had to be more than two people with supreme rank godheads in the universe!

The little cow explained, “It is as I said, as long as a person has a supreme rank godhead, they can cultivate this technique, but it still depends on the person’s comprehension ability. In the old days, how many experts had tried cultivating the technique for several thousand years yet they still failed. This Grandmist Parasitic Medium consists of ten stages; even the Grandmist King merely reached the ninth stage, whereas the other person has only reached the seventh stage. Even so, he has no rival in the Divine World!”

“No rival in the Divine World!” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t begin to fathom how it felt like to be almost invincible in the whole Divine World.

The little cow reiterated, “Even though this technique is difficult to cultivate, once you enter the second stage and are able to condense the grandmist parasites, you’ll see how terrifying it is. Especially in the latter stages, the more powerful the grandmist parasite will be. By the third stage, you can use it to kill your enemy, while at the fourth stage, a grandmist parasite can attach itself to a person’s body undetected, regardless of distance and time. It can even devour that person’s godforce and channel it to you!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were protruding from their sockets, ‘Is such a thing possible?’

Wasn’t that even more powerful than his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power?

Right now, Huang Xiaolong’s target had to be within a certain range for his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power to be able to absorb their godforce, but this grandmist parasite could do the same while disregarding time and space constraints!

Scary, too scary!

The little cow went on, “I don’t know how powerful it can be when you reach the fifth stage, but I remember what the Grandmist King once said; there is probably an eleventh stage to this Grandmist Parasitic Medium, even a twelfth stage. However, with his ability, he was unable to further create these two stages. Then again, forget these two, if you can reach the tenth stage, you’ll already be invincible in this universe, with less than a handful of people that could be your rivals.”

Huang Xiaolong suddenly felt a strong thirst.

“I say, why don’t you stop cultivating that so-called Heaven Splitting Tenet? It is in fact quite useless, you know. Even if you managed to cultivate it to the tenth stage and subjugate that Hellion Tower from the lower realm, it is just a chaos grade spiritual artifact.” The little cow’s tone turned serious, “Why don’t you focus on cultivating this Grandmist Parasitic Medium? Weren’t you planning on creating your own technique? If you can create the last two stages of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, even the Grandmist King will have to worship you as his teacher!”

“Who is this Grandmist King?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked.

The little cow was caught off guard by the question for a second then it innocently shook its head, “The secrets of heaven cannot be revealed, however, if you can reach the seventh stage of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, maybe you’ll have a chance to meet the Grandmist King.”

As for the identity of the second person who succeeded in cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, the little cow did not mention it at all.

“Is there any way to increase the cultivation speed for this technique?” Huang Xiaolong asked hopefully. If the first stage required over a thousand years to master, that was simply too long a time. What about the second stage then? Would it take ten thousand years and above?

The little cow’s head slowly tilted to the right, then to the left, as it searched its memories. A while later, it said, “There is, but no one ever succeeded with this method. The Grandmist Parasitic Medium was created by the Grandmist King in the Grandmist World, so it’s origin is closely related to the grandmist aura. If you can find a source of grandmist aura, then absorb and comprehend it, not only could it increase your chances of success but also shorten the time you need to master the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.”

Huang Xiaolong was delighted, this was a good way.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, the little cow poured cold water over Huang Xiaolong’s excitement, “Don’t feel happy so fast.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“The grandmist aura has disappeared after the Divine World was formed, no one can find it anymore.”

“But it cannot be said to have completely disappeared from the Divine World. Others might not know of it, but I do know a place that should have some grandmist aura.” The little cow suddenly revealed.
