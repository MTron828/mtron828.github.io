Once Huang Xiaolong’s group disappeared from the horizon, He Fang vowed full of hatred, “Huang Xiaolong, I, He Fang will make sure you get expelled from the Fortune Gate if it’s the last thing I do, or I’ll renounce my surname!”

My surname won’t be He!

His voice rumbled in the sky, and the surrounding roofs were pulverized to dust by the soundwaves.

Zhu Feng, Lu Tai, and Sun Yao were shocked as they watched everything from a distance.

He Fang, a peak late-Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm master, had his his ten fingers twisted and broken! To top it off, he was sent staggering back by a small push!

Furthermore, the person who had stopped He Fang was an inconspicuous black-robed man by Huang Xiaolong’s side, instead of the two beasts!

Zhu Feng’s throat went dry suddenly.

Since when did so many high-level Ancestor God Realm masters start following Huang Xiaolong?!

How is that even possible?!

There were already three high-level Ancestor God Realm masters if Zhu Feng were to count the black-robed man and the two beasts!

In the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch, there were only eight high-level Ancestor God Realm masters, counting his father Zhu Yi and the seven Ancestors.

Naturally, Zhu Feng didn’t know that Feng Er and Gui Yi were also high-level Ancestor God Realm masters, more importantly, divine elephant Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng were actually God King Realm masters!

Not to mention, there were over a thousand Ancestor God Realm magical beasts, devils, and evil spirits inside Huang Xiaolong’s Xumi Temple.

Zhu Feng suppressed the fear that rose to his heart and hastened to He Fang’s side and said righteously, "Senior Brothers, leave it to me! Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate will capture and put Huang Xiaolong on trial for rebelling against his seniors. I will also have him heavily punished! Senior Brothers can then deal with him as you see fit! I will go report to my father about Huang Xiaolong’s lawless actions!"

He Fang’s eyes were gloomy and cold as he looked at Zhu Feng. He bellowed, "Why are you still standing here then? Quickly go and report your father and capture Huang Xiaolong for punishment!"

Zhu Feng’s face was a lot ugly since He Fang had shouted at him, but he complied flatteringly, "Yes, yes, yes, I’m going to report to my father right away!"

Just as Zhu Feng took out his communication talisman to report to his father, Chen Xuguang frowned and said, "If Golden Brow and Blood Knife refuse to cooperate, then it would be hard for the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate to capture Huang Xiaolong!" Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He Fang shouted angrily, "Golden Brow and Blood Knife have the guts to disregard the Fortune Gate’s rules to protect their disciples under such circumstances?!" He turned back to Zhu Feng and saw Zhu Feng standing stupidly, so he roared at him again, "Send a message to Zhu Yi immediately! He has one hour to capture Huang Xiaolong for me, or we will report this matter back to the headquarters, hmph, you know the consequences of that, don’t you?!"

In his moment of rage, He Fang had directly used Zhu Yi’s name, instead of using the courteous title of a ‘Gate Chief.’

Anger burned in Zhu Feng’s eyes at He Fang’s disrespect towards his father.

Still, he endured it, and quickly reported the matter regarding Huang Xiaolong to his father Zhu Yi. He naturally omitted some important details and even added his own versions to the narration of the incident, in order to portray Huang Xiaolong as the guilty party.

Therefore, even before Huang Xiaolong reached the Divine Fortune Kingdom, the Fortune Gate’s Chief Zhu Yi had received Zhu Feng’s report through the communication talisman.

Zhu Yi thought he had read wrongly when he first read Zhu Feng’s report, thus he looked at the message again while his eyes grew bigger in shock.

Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Black Ice Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, and Myriad Flames Ancestor were puzzled by Zhu Yi’s reaction. All of them were gathered to discuss and plan a strategy for dealing with the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body.

Did something happen?

“Gate Chief, what happened?” Sky Sword Ancestor asked curiously.

Zhu Yi did not answer immediately. He looked at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor with a concerned expression. This made everyone even more puzzled and curious.

“Feng’er just reported to me that Huang Xiaolong is back.” Zhu Yi began.

Huang Xiaolong’s back?

Everyone blanked for a second. ...Even if Huang Xiaolong was back, was there a need for such an expression?

“Moments ago, Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates heavily injured He Fang and Chen Xuguang in the Fortune city!” Zhu Yi finished with a boom.

“What—?!” Everyone gasped.

Black Ice Ancestor was enraged and spoke impulsively, “Huang Xiaolong is really lawless!” As she fumed, she turned and roared at Blood Knife Ancestor, “Didn’t I already say that Huang Xiaolong is a troublemaker! Look, he has already started making trouble, even in Fortune City; he actually let his subordinates heavily injure He Fang and Chen Xuguang...!”

But she suddenly stopped talking and spun around towards Zhu Yi, as if she had just comprehended what he had said. Her mouth opened and closed before finally squeezing out a question, “W-what did you say? Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates heavily injured He Fang and Chen Xuguang?! Are you sure, it was his subordinates?!”

He Fang and Chen Xuguang were peak late-Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, and peak late-Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm masters respectively. How were Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates able to injure the two of them...? The rest of the Ancestors had the same astounded expressions on their faces, except Golden Brow and Blood Knife.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor had known that Huang Xiaolong had inherited the Ghost Manor Lord’s position, thus they knew about Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San’s existence.

But both of them were frowning and had deep furrows on their foreheads. If Feng Er and the others had actually injured He Fang and Chen Xuguang, then how were they going to resolve this matter? He Fang and Chen Xuguang had come to the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch under their Master’s order. Although their Master wasn’t a Fortune Gate headquarters’ Elder, his status was not low.

In the meantime, Zhu Yi explained to Black Ice Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestors, and the others, “According to Feng’er, it was indeed Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates who injured He Fang and Chen Xuguang... He also said...” He paused momentarily and continued, sounding slightly awkward, “He said there are three Ancestor God Realm masters by Huang Xiaolong’s side!”

“What?!”

Black Ice Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, and Lightning Hammer Ancestor were dumbfounded. Whereas Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor nodded inwardly!

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor thought to themselves, ‘Yes, that sounds about right, it was indeed Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er!’

“Furthermore, Feng’er estimated that these three are most likely Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm masters!” Zhu Yi supplemented.

Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm masters!

Once again the four Ancestors dumbfounded.

Eventually, all eyes fell on Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, but neither of them spoke.

“Three Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm masters!” Black Ice Ancestor suppressed the great waves of shock in her heart and snorted coldly, “No wonder he’s so rampant and insolent that he even dared to the injure disciples from the headquarters—his trump card is these three Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm subordinates! Does he think we won’t punish him because of that?!”

“Feng’er also said, He Fang and Chen Xuguang are furious. They want us to detain Huang Xiaolong and heavily punish him! Otherwise, they would return and report the matter to the headquarters’ higher echelons!” Zhu Yi was looking at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor as he said this.

Black Ice Ancestor demanded angrily, “Golden Brow, and Blood Knife, you still want to protect Huang Xiaolong? Even if he’s your disciple, he cannot disregard the Fortune Gate’s rules. Not to mention, the headquarters’ Elder doesn’t have a goodwill towards us in the first place. If He Fang and Cheng Xuguang report this matter, do you even know what the consequences would be?!”

Golden Brow Ancestor sighed heavily in his heart, but he had to say something, “If the fault lies with Xiaolong, we won’t indiscriminately protect him!”

“If the fault is not with Xiaolong, merely Zhu Feng stirring trouble..., hmph!” Blood Knife Ancestor snorted coldly.

Black Ice Ancestor sneered in disdain, “Whether it is or not, we’ll know once we capture and interrogate Huang Xiaolong? He should be arriving soon!”

By this time, Huang Xiaolong had reached the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s entrance.
