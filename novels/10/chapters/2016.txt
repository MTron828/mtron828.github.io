As the little cow opened the cap on the bottle, she poured everything into her mouth, emptying the bottle instantly. Popping sounds could be heard as lightning swirled around her body.

“Nice!” The little cow’s body trembled, and a look of comfort washed over her face. “If only I can get my hands on the Twelve Winged Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills... That would be even better!”

Huang Xiaolong flicked her across the forehead. “Having ten winged ones is good enough. You must be dreaming if you’re thinking of getting your hands on Twelve Winged Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills. Don’t you know that every single pill you consumed was a priceless treasure?!”

The little cow chuckled in amusement. “This old cow barely managed to regain her strength. I need to take some supplements in order to stay strong. It’s just several dozen bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills. There might even be better stuff in the King of Darkness’ inner palace!

She was right. She wasn’t imagining things when she said that there might be even more precious treasures. In the past, the King of Darkness had massacred his way around the various worlds and killed god knew how many experts. He had managed to plunder an insane number of treasures, and there was definitely a chance of there being treasures more precious than the Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills.

“Let’s go. We need to enter the Ghost Pool Formation.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother fighting with the little cow over what she just said. He tapped on her back, and she turned into a streak of light that brought Huang Xiaolong over to the formation.

In just a few minutes, they appeared in the space above the Ghost Pool Formation.

Seeing that the formation that he had placed was still there, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He waved his hand and stopped the formation’s operation, revealing the existence of the Ghost Pool.

A snort left the little cow’s lips, and a surge of energy blasted against the formation. The space above the formation rippled, and the two of them disappeared from their original spot.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong arrived in the massive hall that used to contain the four odd beasts.

Of course, the hall was empty as Huang Xiaolong had already brought the four of them away. Previously, the four massive figures were chained to the wall. Now, all that was left of that memory was the broken chains on the ground.

Huang Xiaolong summoned the four beasts, and he ordered them to follow behind him. As he led the way, the small group eventually made their way towards the dark space formed by the King of Darkness.

The dark space was exactly how Huang Xiaolong remembered it. He couldn’t see his fingers if he stretched his hand out, and he could feel the waves of darkness washing over his body from time to time.

Huang Xiaolong circulated his Archdevil Supreme Godhead and started to swallow the darkness energy that came from the void. He slowly made his way forward with the little cow in tow.

After half an hour, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the dark space and arrived at the place the galaxial river used to be. Right now, Huang Xiaolong had already refined it, and it was a part of the City of Eternity.

After passing the space, the King of Darkness’s palace appeared in front of his eyes.

When he approached the palace once again, a type of nefarious and frigid qi surged towards him. Thanks to his previous experiences, Huang Xiaolong immediately summoned the sixteen wings and blocked the wave of qi from hitting him with the help of his radiance energy.

They slowly made their way towards the palace.

All of a sudden, a shocking wave of frigid qi charged towards Huang Xiaolong. It contained boundless might and possessed unstoppable power.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless. He raised the Radiance Divine Scepter as the Heavenly Hall, and Radiance Divine Seal appeared above him. Holy light shone down on the space before him, and the phantom of the Radiance Ancestor appeared. The phantom reached out and suppressed the wave of energy.

The little cow chuckled under her breath, “I haven’t seen you for a hundred years, and your strength has already grown to such a terrifying stage. You’re pretty good...”

“Aren’t you the same?”

“How can you compare yourself to me? I was merely regaining the strength that I had lost. You’re improving yourself!” The little cow continued, “The difference between the two is shocking!”

They chatted as they continued to make their way towards the palace.

The closer they approached, the stronger the darkness energy became as it repelled them. In the end, the three supreme treasures of the Radiance World shone with brilliant light as they poured radiance energy into the phantom of the Radiance Ancestor. With the support of the three treasures, the phantom managed to suppress the boundless darkness energy coming from the void.

While the treasures were suppressing the darkness energy, Huang Xiaolong was controlling his Archdevil Supreme Godhead to devour as much of the remaining energy as he could.

The darkness energy was actually a great supplement for Huang Xiaolong.

Step by step, they made their way towards the palace.

After several tens of minutes, they finally arrived at the entrance.

When they saw the terrifying structure that seemed to swallow all light standing tall in front of them, a solemn expression appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. He could feel the strength of the restrictions lying behind the entrance.

The heart of Hell started to pound once again, and it began to emit resplendent rays of light.

As the Heart of Hell rarely reacted to anything, Huang Xiaolong realized that he got the same feeling when he had approached the King of Darkness’s palace in the past.

He stared at the space above the entrance. Two large rings greeted his sight, and mysterious runes flowed around them. There was no doubt that those two rings were a set of restrictions, and Huang Xiaolong was sure that they were left behind by the King of Darkness himself.

Just as he was about to shatter the restrictions with the Radiance Divine Scepter, the little cow spoke out. “Let me do it.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, but he nodded his head after thinking about it for a second.

The horn on the little cow’s head enlarged several times over all of a sudden, and a dazzling golden light illuminated the space before them. The little cow slammed her horns directly into the two rings.

A massive explosion resounded through the air, and the palace trembled. The rings popped and shook as the glow around them started to dim. Before long, the light around them disappeared completely.

What in the world...

Huang Xiaolong stared at the scene before him in shock.

The little cow shook her head and laughed, “Sh*t! I haven’t used this move in a long time! My head is spinning right now!”

Huang Xiaolong felt his vision starting to spin when he heard what she said,

However, the little cow’s attack served to show how strong the restrictions were. If he were to try to break it on his own, he might not even be able to shatter them! He was lucky he brought the little cow along with him.

As the restrictions were broken, Huang Xiaolong managed to open the doors without much difficulty. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As soon as he opened the doors, a blinding ray of dark light pieced into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He was shocked, and he involuntarily raised his arm to protect himself. After a full minute, he finally opened his eyes. The sight of a massive hall greeted him, and there was a giant sacrificial table at the side.

Shockingly, a heart lay silently on the sacrificial table!

It was a heart that was completely black in color. The sight of it could cause people to fall into despair, bringing a sense of oppression. The heart was like the embodiment of all the evil, darkness, and chill in the world!

Huang Xiaolong stared at the heart in shock.

Why was there only a single heart?! Where was the King of Darkness?!

Anyway, why was the heart resonating with his Heart of Hell?!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had no idea what the heart represented, the little cow was much more knowledgeable when it came to matters like this. “Oh man, it’s the Heart of Darkness!”

“Heart of Darkness?” Huang Xiaolong subconsciously turned to stare at the little cow.

Instead of replying to him, the little cow nearly broke into dance as she exclaimed animatedly, “I never thought that he would actually be able to form the Heart of Darkness! If not for this, I’m afraid that he really would have died!”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart skipped a beat.

From what he heard, the little cow was saying that the King of Darkness wasn’t dead yet!

Seeing the look of curiosity on Huang Xiaolong’s face, the little cow started to explain everything to him. “Even though the Heart of Darkness isn’t as perverse as the Heart of Hell, it’s extremely similar! It has the same attributes that allow the owner to live on forever! It seemed as though the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had really destroyed the King of Darkness’s body with the Ancient Heavenly Court. However, as long as the Heart of Darkness is present, the King of Darkness will live on forever!"
