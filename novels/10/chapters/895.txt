Even the cultivators who came to reside in Martial Spirit World, attracted by its astonishingly rich spiritual energy, were now selling off their residences at rock bottom prices just so they could leave one second faster.

All of this was happening because the Yelu and Beitang Families had released word that they were coming for blood, to dye the soil of Martial Spirit World red.

“Since those Ancestors want to terminate their blood contract, tell them to come see me now.” Huang Xiaolong turned to Green Beast Dragon King and ordered.

Green Dragon Beast King respectfully complied and left the hall.

Shortly, he returned with more than a dozen people behind him.

There was hesitation on those Ancestors’ faces as they walked into the hall. Even though they still greeted Huang Xiaolong as they previously did, the respect was no longer there.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze, no one present could guess what he was thinking, “You all want to terminate your blood contract?”

The dozen of Ancestors confirmed in unison.

“That is correct.” One of them, a Second Order Highgod Realm Ancestor, gritted his teeth and took a step forward, “We can return the remaining divine grade spirit stones.”

“Huang Xiaolong, you cannot blame us. Who told you to offend both the Yelu and Beitang Families at once?” Another Second Order Highgod Realm master defended their actions.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s anger was clearly seen on his face, but just as he was about to reprimand the person who had just spoken, Huang Xiaolong spoke. “Sure, I can terminate your blood contract right now.”

Everyone was stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s words, especially the dozen Ancestors.

They had signed a blood contract with Huang Xiaolong, and now they were demanding to terminate it. Such an action was no different than betrayal, hence, they never thought that Huang Xiaolong would agree.

Yet, he just did! So simple and direct.

“You really agree to terminate our blood contracts?” One of the Highgod Realm Ancestors asked in shock, he even suspected that Huang Xiaolong had other hidden motives. After all, they had used quite a lot of his divine grade spirit stones during their stay in the Huang Clan Manor. In fact, they could be said to be nothing more than freeloaders so far.

Now, Huang Xiaolong and the Huang Clan Manor had a sword hanging above their necks, and at this crucial time they came demanding to terminate their blood contracts. It would be granted that anyone would be furious. But Huang Xiaolong’s calm demeanor and reaction were too strange.

At this time, several small bursts of light flashed in the air as more than a dozen blood contracts appeared before Huang Xiaolong. He then flicked out a small fireball from his finger, which separated into a dozen smaller fireballs, burning away the blood contracts.

“Alright, your blood contracts are now terminated. Leave behind the divine grade spirit stones and you can all leave.” Huang Xiaolong stated in a flat tone.

Watching this, those Ancestors’ delight was clearly exhibited on their faces. Their actions were quick and swift, taking out a few divine grade spirit stones and throwing them to the floor. Without another word to Huang Xiaolong, all of them turned around and left the Huang Clan Manor.

“Little Huang brat, these treacherous people, you’ll really let them go like this?” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi asked.

“That’s right, Master, I can go and kill all of them right now.” Ancestor Bifang fumed with anger.

Huang Xiaolong nonchalantly waved his hand, his voice flat, “No need, they will return very soon begging on their knees for us to accept them again. I will make everyone understand the consequences of betraying me, Huang Xiaolong.”

Huang Xiaolong continued to discuss Martial Spirit World’s current situation with Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi and the rest.

Listening to the old dragon talk about the cultivators who came to Martial Spirit World and were now fleeing like there was a fierce beast behind them, Huang Xiaolong commanded, “Have all the cities list out the names of those fleeing cultivators. In the future, they are not allowed to take half a step into Martial Spirit World, otherwise they shall be killed without mercy!”

A whelming killing intent exploded from Huang Xiaolong like a hurricane and disappeared just as suddenly as it appeared.

“Yes!” The Green Dragon Beast King and several others loudly acknowledged.

Huang Xiaolong gave a few more orders before telling the Green Dragon Beast King and the rest to retreat, after which he returned to his own yard, entering the Heavenly Mountain and continuing to cultivate.

Although his current strength was enough to defeat Yelu Chufei, he still needed to improve his cultivation to mid-Fourth Order Highgod Realm. When that happened, he was fully confident that he could kill Yelu Chufei. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Without delay, Huang Xiaolong reached the depths of the Heavenly Mountain’s underground space, sitting cross-legged above the suppressed lightning dragon spiritual vein.

He breathed out and his three supreme godheads started rotating.

Instantly, a terrifying amount of lightning force from the spiritual vein surged into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

During the first contact, Huang Xiaolong’s body quivered from the overwhelming rush of lightning force.

In a short time, he was submerged under currents of lightning force, rippling around him, gathering, expanding, forming a heavenly ocean of lightning.

Staying for a short time within this lightning force ocean could temper a Fourth Order Highgod Realm cultivator’s physical body to another degree. A single strand this lightning spiritual energy was comparable to one stalk of three-million-year-old medicinal herb.

Now, multiple strands of that force were being devoured by Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads, refined, absorbed, and converted into his own godforce.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose with every breath.

The day passed by.

Huang Xiaolong had completely disappeared into the ocean of lightning force.

From afar, one could only see a divine ocean of lightning force floating in an underground space, large waves rolling on its surface. Its center seemed to be nurturing a chaotic Lightning God.

In the blink of an eye, half a month flew by. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation reached the peak of early Fourth Order Highgod Realm.

Sitting cross-legged at the center of the lightning force ocean, Huang Xiaolong’s mind had entered an ethereal state, every part of him seemed to fuse with the whole Martial Spirit World.

Huang Xiaolong could detect in detail every ripple in the outer space surrounding Martial Spirit World. His senses continued to expand further and further.

In the end, his divine sense even reached neighboring world surfaces such as the Peace Emperor World. Every secret underground chamber was clear to Huang Xiaolong, even a certain family’s Ancestor ‘exercising’ with his little concubine, as if everything was right in front of his eyes.

Above Huang Xiaolong’s soul sea, his three supreme godheads emitted brilliant radiance.

While Huang Xiaolong was absorbing the lightning dragon spiritual vein’s lightning force, far away in the Saint Lord Galaxy at the Yelu Family’s main residence, Yelu Chufei was leading the Yelu Family’s Elders and Grand Elders, heading toward the Black Tortoise Galaxy.

This time, Yelu Chufei had brought eight-tenths of the Yelu Family’s Grand Elders and Elders, totaling over six hundred masters.

Over six hundred Highgod Realm masters, most of which were Fifth and Sixth Order!

With Yelu Chufei and those Yelu Family masters’ speed, they could reach Martial Spirit World one day before or on Huang Xiaolong’s wedding.

On the way, Yelu Tianhao said to his father, “Father, I heard Huang Xiaolong has been in seclusion these days.”

Yelu Chufei snickered, “He really thinks that two or three months of cultivation could give him the strength to fight me? How naive!”

Yelu Tianhao went on, “Last time I saw that Shi Xiaofei, she was still a virgin, I wonder if she still is.” His eyes glimmered with a lecherous light. Every time he thought that he would soon be able to enjoy Shi Xiaofei, moreover, doing it in front of Huang Xiaolong, Yelu Tianhao could feel his blood grow hot with anticipation.

He could barely contain himself.

More than a dozen days passed by.

The Yelu Family’s group stood there in space, looking at the Martial Spirit World in front of them. In a flicker, the massive number of people passed through the outer space barrier, descending on the Martial Spirit World.
