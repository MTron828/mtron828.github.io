Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts churned listening to these disciples’ conversations. The Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss? Doesn’t that mean, Bei Xiaomei will be attending the apprenticeship ceremony in a month?

Remembering Bei Xiaomei’s cute and innocent personality, Huang Xiaolong smiled subconsciously.

More than twenty years had passed since he had left the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, and that was also the same amount of time since he had seen Bei Xiaomei.

Thinking of their meeting, Huang Xiaolong felt as if the time at the auction house had just happened yesterday.

“Just now, you were saying that the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss would be attending the apprenticeship ceremony, is that right?” Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of the conversing disciples in a flicker and asked them.

The disciples look at Huang Xiaolong, and when they noticed the pattern on Huang Xiaolong’s robe, all of them quickly stood at attention and saluted, “Greetings Grand Martial Uncle!”

Personal disciples of Elders and above had different patterned robes.

As the Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei’s personal disciple, Huang Xiaolong’s brocade robe had an eye-catching lightning symbol. Thus, these disciples were able to determine Huang Xiaolong’s identity at a glance. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s Senior Brother was Chen Hao, and being in the same ‘generation’ as Grand Elder Chen Hao, it was only proper for these disciples to call Huang Xiaolong as Grand Martial Uncle.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at them and said, “No need to stand on ceremony.”

Only then did the disciples straighten their backs.

“Replying to Grand Martial Uncle, from the news that we have heard, the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss will attend the ceremony with the Silver Fox Commerce’s masters, but we are not certain if the news is true.” One of the disciples respectfully replied to Huang Xiaolong’s question.

Obviously, this disciple was the group leader amongst them.

“What about the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace? Are people coming from these Emperor Palaces as well?” Huang Xiaolong asked casually.

The same disciple replied, “They are, Grand Martial Uncle. The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace are quite close to our Fortune Emperor Palace, hence, they will certainly send people to attend the ceremony; it’s just that we don’t know if their Emperors will come in person or not, but the four Emperor Palaces’ Emperor’s Disciple would come.”

“Other than these four Emperor Palaces, there are also people coming from the Royal Buddha Emperor Palace, Ice Phoenix Emperor Palace, Eternal Emperor Palace, Dark Spirit Emperor Palace, Poison Emperor Palace, the Medicine Emperor Palace...” The disciple went on to name more than fifty Emperor Palace forces.

Some of these Emperor Palaces ranked in the top one hundred, and quite a few ranked in the top three hundred.

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly astonished. Even though Senior Brother Chen Hao had informed him there would be a lot of Emperor Palace forces attending the grand apprenticeship ceremony, it had not occurred to him that the list would be so long.

The fifty plus Emperor Palaces mentioned by the disciple weren’t the only ones attending the Fortune Emperor Palace’s apprenticeship ceremony.

According to the disciple, there were three to four hundred Emperor Palace forces’ representatives attending the ceremony.

Masters from three to four hundred Emperor Palace forces!

Just imagining the scene was scary enough.

It was probably enough to attack the Heavenly Court with just all these Emperor Palace forces gathered together, isn’t it?

“Tell me about the Dark Spirit Emperor Palace and Eternal Emperor Palace.” As an afterthought, Huang Xiaolong told the disciple.

He didn’t know that there were the Eternal Emperor Palace and the Dark Spirit Emperor Palace in the Divine World.

In that case, were the Vientiane World’s Wangu Clan and Dark Elf Tribe the Eternal Emperor Palace and Dark Spirit Emperor Palace’s branches respectively?

The disciple complied respectfully then reported to Huang Xiaolong everything he knew about the two Emperor Palaces.

However, the disciple was only a Fortune Emperor Palace’s inner sect disciple, thus his knowledge about the two Emperor Palaces was limited. For more information, Huang Xiaolong would have to go look for his Senior Brother Chen Hao.

Or perhaps, he could go to the Fortune Emperor Palace’s library? The Fortune Emperor Palace’s library consisted of twenty floors full of vast information.

Huang Xiaolong immediately acted on his thought. With his identity, he had the permission to access the first twelve floors of the library.

Huang Xiaolong asked the disciple a few more questions about the Silver Fox Commerce, before flying away.

The group of disciples inwardly breathed a sigh of relief as they watched Huang Xiaolong fly away. Regardless of Huang Xiaolong’s casual attitude, his identity inevitably made them feel the pressure of his position.

“He is our Chief of Hall Masters’ newly accepted personal disciple, right? That Grand Martial Uncle Huang Xiaolong?” One of the disciples said in a hushed voice.

“Our Chief of Hall Masters only has two personal disciples. Other than Grand Elder Chen Hao, he has only accepted Grand Martial Uncle Huang Xiaolong as his new disciple. It should be him. It seems like the rumors are correct and he is indeed only an Ancestor God Realm.” Another disciple said.

“Grand Martial Uncle Huang Xiaolong had amazing results in the rankings competition, and I’ve heard that even our newly recruited supreme godhead genius Peng Xiao was no match against him. Great Grand Martial Uncle Peng Xiao is a late-First Order God King Realm master, you know, whereas Grand Martial Uncle Huang Xiaolong is just a Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, just thinking of it feels unbelievable.”

These disciples talked among themselves in hushed tones after seeing Huang Xiaolong was already out of sight.

“Grand Martial Uncle specifically asked about Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss, so could it be that they know each other?” Interest sparked in one of the keen disciples eyes.

“It’s said that Grand Martial Uncle Huang Xiaolong came from the Vientiane branch. How could Grand Martial Uncle know the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss with his previous identity? I think he also heard rumors about the Second Miss being adorable and generous, so he asked about her specifically.”

“That’s right, as even our Hall Master couldn’t associate with the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss, so Grand Martial Uncle Huang Xiaolong has a lesser chance of knowing her.”

After separating from the group of disciples, Huang Xiaolong continued roaming around the Fortune Emperor Palace instead of returning to the Tiger Dragon Palace Gardens.

“The Myriad Treasure Palace.” When passing by a palace building, Huang Xiaolong stopped, seemingly attracted by the name. Senior Brother Chen Hao had spoken about this Myriad Treasure Palace before.

He had mentioned that the disciples could trade and exchange treasures at this Myriad Treasure Palace.

Other than being the place where the Fortune Emperor Palace’ disciples could trade and exchange treasures, it was also a place for the disciples to sell and buy treasures. As long as a Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple had enough spirit stones, they could get any treasures they liked inside this Myriad Treasure Palace.

Or you could sell the treasure to the Fortune Emperor Palace, the Fortune Emperor Palace would give contribution points instead.

“I wonder if I can find any grandmist grade velocity stones in this Myriad Treasure Palace?” Huang Xiaolong wondered as his legs carried him inside.

Grandmist grade velocity stones were the most important material to repair his Dragon Shark Flying Ship.

The moment he stepped inside the Myriad Treasure Palace, Huang Xiaolong noticed that it was much bigger than he had imagined. At a single glance, the hall was several thousand meters in length and several hundred meters wide.

In between two sides of several thousand meter length walls were rows of stalls!

There was a disciple at each stall, either standing or sitting, with various kinds of treasures displayed in front of them.

These disciples had rented these stall spaces from the Fortune Emperor Palace on a monthly basis, and each disciple had to pay a certain fee as rent.

Huang Xiaolong randomly picked a direction and started browsing through the stalls in the hall.

Though the treasures displayed by these disciples were not bad, they didn’t catch Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong strolled until the end of the hall, but shook his head in disappointment. He hadn’t found any good things. He then stepped into the inner hall.

The Myriad Treasure Palace was divided into outer hall and inner hall. The Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples could sell and trade their treasures in the outer hall, whereas the Fortune Emperor Palace sold treasures in the inner hall.

Huang Xiaolong looked around upon stepping into the inner hall. Rows and rows of grids made of unknown material were stacked high against the walls on both sides. Within each grid space contained various forms of spatial artifacts.

All of the spatial artifacts were openly displayed, allowing others to view the items inside—from mountain-high piled of various chaos spiritual herbs, to spiritual pills, ores, steel, divine artifacts, and divine armors.

Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised inwardly. Just these items inside the Myriad Treasure Palace’s inner hall were enough to cause all the forces of a world surface to head and claws for it. But they were simply displayed inside this Myriad Treasure Palace’s inner hall.

There were quite a few disciples inside the inner hall, and all of them had come to select or sell treasures here.

Huang Xiaolong walked around casually, but moments later, a frown creased his forehead. A group of disciples was in his course of path and at the front of the group was Sun Shihai! Behind Sun Shihai stood Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu, Zhou Wen, and several other inner sect disciples.

Sun Shihai was standing in front of a grid, obviously interested in the item store inside that particular spatial artifact.
