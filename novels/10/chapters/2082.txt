Chapter 2083: Devil Extermination Gate

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to move against disciples like Wu Qianzhen. He didn’t care about the glare Wu Qianzhen shot at him as he casually wandered away with the little cow and Cang Mutian in tow.

After all, they were merely the Thousand Despair Devil Sect.

When the members of the Thousand Despair Devil Sect left, the female disciple of the Devil Emperor Sect, Zhu Sijia, turned around and spoke to Huang Xiaolong. “Don’t worry. Everything is fine now. Haven’t you realized that the regions outside the Saint Devil City are extremely dangerous? You should follow the elders of your sect around.”

It was clear that Zhu Sijia had taken Huang Xiaolong to be some disciple following his faction’s elders around.

This time, the appearance of the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia had attracted lots of superpowers. Some of the juniors had followed their elders to the Saint Devil City in order to gain experience and widen their horizons. They were also ready to make some connections with the disciples from the other sects.

After hearing how Zhu Sijia warned him about the dangers with the tone of an elder, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle to himself, “Alright.”

When was the last time anyone had lectured him?

With his current identity, even the Reverence Moon Old Man and the King of Grandmist wouldn’t talk to him in that tone.

After seeing how Huang Xiaolong brushed her off, a frown formed on Zhu Sijia’s face. Even though she was clearly displeased with Huang Xiaolong’s attitude, she remained quiet as she watched them leave.

“Hold it!” Before they could enter the mountain range, a disciple who stood behind Zhu Sijia yelled at them. “My Senior Sister saved you guys! Why aren’t you thanking her?”

The little cow, Cang Mutian, and Huang Xiaolong stopped as they turned around to stare at the group of disciples from the Devil Emperor Sect.

Before they could say anything, Zhu Sijia raised her hand and stopped her junior brother from going any further. “Junior Brother Wang, forget it.”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t enraged in the slightest as a gentle smile formed on his face. “Alright... I would like to thank you for saving me today. If you meet with any difficulties in the future, you can look for me.”

Just like that, Huang Xiaolong made a promise to the members of the Devil Emperor Sect.

Zhu Sijia and the others stared at him with a dumbfounded expression.

“That’s rich...” The disciple who had spoken up previously continued, “Are you sure you’ll be able to solve a problem that even my senior sister cannot solve? Do you really think that our Devil Emperor Sect needs your help?”

Huang Xiaolong simply chuckled in a low voice before bringing the little cow and Cang Mutian away.

The disciple sneered when he saw the backs of Huang Xiaolong and the others. “A retard who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. He’s full of sh*t...” He turned to Zhu Sijia and continued, “Senior Sister, you shouldn’t have bothered helping him!”

“What a waste of time...”

The other disciples from the Devil Emperor Sect couldn’t help but curse at Huang Xiaolong after seeing that he had left.

Zhu Sijia shook her head and turned to face the others. “Let’s go. We have to head back right now. I received news that Junior Brother Huang offended the members of the Devil Extermination Gate...”

“Devil Extermination Gate?!” The group of disciples gasped in shock.

The Devil Extermination Gate was the seventh-ranked superpower in the Devil World. It was the faction the Devil Extermination Archdevil Ancestor had founded in the past.

As for the Devil Extermination Archdevil Ancestor himself, he was ranked fifth among the twelve Archdevil Ancestors. Despite being a little weaker than Chiyou, his reputation resounded far and wide.

“That’s right...” A look of worry flashed across Zhu Sijia’s face as she continued to explain the situation to the others. “An ancestor of the Exterminating Devil Gate brought several experts over to our sect in the Saint Devil City in order to demand an explanation.”

If they failed to deal with the matter, the Devil Emperor Sect would probably...

When they thought about the possibilities, everyone felt their hearts sinking.

No longer hesitating, Zhu Sijia and the others charged towards Saint Devil City in order to negotiate with the members of the Devil Extermination Gate.

As soon as she arrived at their sect’s headquarters, she saw her master, Huang Zhe. She hastily asked about the situation, “Master, how are things with the Devil Extermination Gate?”

Huang Zhe was an Emperor at the peak of the late-Fourth Order, and he was one of the ancestors in the Devil Emperor Sect. Zhi Sijia’s junior brother, Huang Junfan, was also his disciple, and he was the one who had offended the Devil Extermination Gate’s disciple.

Huang Zhe felt the rage bubbling in his heart as he spat in anger, “Zheng Hao is going too far! He wants me to hand over Junfan, and he also wants me to bring gifts over to appease his anger personally! He wants ten thousand high-grade grandmist spiritual pills as compensation!”

Zheng Hao was the Devil Extermination Gate’s ancestor, and he was a high-level Emperor to boot.

Zhu Sijia’s face changed the moment she heard about the price Zheng Hao demanded. Huang Junfan was the son of her master, Huang Zhe, and he possessed incredible talent. He had always been doted on by Huang Zhe, and there was no way he would hand his son over to the members of the Devil Extermination Gate! It went without a doubt that Huang Junfan would suffer a miserable fate as soon as he was handed over. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Moreover, the ten thousand high-grade grandmist spiritual pills were nothing more than blatant extortion. Even high-level Emperors in the Devil Emperor Sect wouldn’t be able to bring out so many high-grade grandmist spiritual pills, let alone a mid-level Emperor like Huang Zhe.

“Also... Zheng Hao mentioned that if we fail to give him ten thousand high-grade grandmist spiritual pills, he would order his disciples to trash the members of our Devil Emperor Sect on sight!” Huang Zhe raged.

Zhu Sijia’s expression turned ugly when she heard what he said.

...

After Huang Xiaolong entered the mountain range, he searched for half a day before returning to the Saint Devil City before night fell.

“The disciples of the Devil Extermination Gate are fighting with the members of the Devil Emperor Sect! Hurry up. Things are getting heated up!”

“I’ve heard that Huang Zhe’s son, Huang Junfan, managed to injure Zheng Hao’s disciple! Zheng Hao ordered for Huang Zhe to hand Huang Junfan over before sending over ten thousand high-grade grandmist spiritual pills as compensation!”

“The Devil Extermination Gate is going overboard. Huang Zhe can’t hand his son over! Not to mention the exorbitant number of high-grade grandmist spiritual pills...”

“They are the Devil Extermination Gate, after all. No matter how strong the Devil Emperor Sect is, they wouldn’t be able to go against the Devil Extermination Gate!”

Huang Xiaolong’s group of three stared at each other when they heard the news.

“Devil Emperor Sect?” The little cow roared with laughter. “Isn’t that lass from the Devil Emperor Sect? Hey! Xiaolong, let’s go take a look!”

The little cow didn’t bother waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s reply as she charged straight towards the battle. Cang Mutian followed behind the two of them as a smile appeared on his face.

Very quickly, the three of them arrived at the scene of the fight.

By the time they arrived, a crowd had formed.

An invisible pressure appeared and forced everyone in their way apart as a path formed before the three of them. As they made their way towards the fight, they saw tens of people facing off against each other. Some disciples were already wounded as both parties glared at each other without intentions of backing off.

Among the disciples from the Devil Emperor Sect, Huang Xiaolong caught sight of Zhu Sijia and her junior brother, who had scolded them when they had walked off.

When Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the members of the Devil Extermination Gate, he saw members of the Thousand Despair Devil Sect in the mix as he recognized the disciples who had stopped him from entering the mountain range.

When Huang Xiaolong saw Wu Qianzhen, Wu Qianzhen turned around, and their gazes met. As soon as Wu Qianzhen saw Huang Xiaolong, a sinister smile appeared on his face.
