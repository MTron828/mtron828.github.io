When everyone thought that Jiang Bi would unleash his anger on Huang Xiaolong, retaliating with ferocity, he instead spoke calmly, “Huang Xiaolong, I admit I underestimated you earlier. Five years later will be the inner disciples’ assessment, at that time, I will fight you on the Hidden Dragon Arena stage and I will defeat you in front of the Institute Principal, Grand Elders, and Elders!”

“We’re leaving!” Jiang Bi flicked the side of his robes, turned around and left.

Everyone was dumbfounded on the spot as they watched Jiang Bi’s leaving silhouette. Li Dufeng and the several disciples with him snapped out of their daze moments later, scampering after Jiang Bi as they followed him out from the Supreme Harmony Hall without daring to turn their heads in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

It wasn’t until Jiang Bi, Li Dufeng, and the several disciples left that the Elders and other disciples in the hall reacted. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Bi was afraid to battle and left?! The disciples were left in a racket of disbelief.

Even Huang Xiaolong did not expect that Jiang Bi would leave so casually. Watching the other side’s leaving silhouette, Huang Xiaolong’s expression was calm; the inner disciples’ assessment? It seems like Jiang Bi thought that he could easily defeat him five years later.

Perhaps Jiang Bi encountered a fortuitous adventure that would allow his strength to break through, or perhaps he was cultivating a certain technique that needed another five years to achieve a desirable result.

Regardless, Huang Xiaolong already threw this person to the back of his mind. In fact, to Huang Xiaolong, this was even better.

‘Five years, I can probably break through to Fourth Order God Realm by then.’ Huang Xiaolong estimated inwardly. In the coming inner disciples’ assessment five years later, the disciple from the Azure Dragon Institute, Xiang Mingzhi, was Huang Xiaolong’s real opponent.

Ignoring the gazes of the others around him, Huang Xiaolong walked toward the side hall distributing medicinal pellets and spirit stones and collected his dues of four thousand Black Warrior Greater Strength Spirit Pellets and saint grade spirit stones. After leaving the Supreme Harmony Hall, he headed straight toward the North Star Square’s transmission array to reach the Black Warrior City. From there, he flew towards Changzhi City’s Divine Fort Residence.

The news that the Black Warrior Auction House would be putting up a piece of sacred grade immortal spirit stone for auction had already spread out, hence, many strong experts were already rushing to the Cloudsea Mainland from every corner of the galaxy.

Black Warrior City, Changzhi City, and other nearby cities became livelier.

Reaching the Divine Fort Residence, Huang Xiaolong gave the Black Warrior Greater Strength Spirit Pellets to his parents and others to refine. However, considering the domineering medicinal effect, he told them to grind the spirit pellets into powder, refining them bit by bit.

Deep into the night, the bright moon hung high in the velvet-colored sky over the quiet land.

Huang Xiaolong stood alone in the yard outside his room in the Divine Fort Residence in contemplation.

“Thinking about the inner disciples’ assessment five years later?” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke, breaking the silence.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “That Jiang Bi is not a threat, but the Azure Dragon Institute’s Xiang Mingzhi might not be an easy opponent.” Despite not having seen the person, Huang Xiaolong felt that this Xiang Mingzhi could be the toughest opponent he ever faced.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said, “When I was still a Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciple, I had some experience with the inner disciples of the Azure Dragon Institute. In short, the Azure Dragon Institute’s inner disciples are all freaks. Our Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciples have the top ten rankings, whereas the Azure Dragon Institute has the top hundred rankings. Let’s put it this way, any one person within that top hundred ranking could easily flatten that Li Dufeng!”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into furrows. Meaning to say, within the ranks of the Azure Dragon Institute inner disciples, there were at least one hundred people stronger than Li Dufeng? He didn’t expect the strength of the Azure Dragon Institute’s inner disciples to be at such a level.

If the inner disciples were as such, then what about their elite disciples?

“If that Xiang Mingzhi is the leader of the Azure Dragon Institute’s inner disciple, his strength is definitely not as simple as Fourth Order God Realm!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi added, “The top ten of the Azure Dragon Institute’s inner disciples, even the one at the bottom, their strength would be at Fifth Order God Realm, at the very least, not to mention Xiang Mingzhi who is ranked first. Although you can summon the Gate of Hell and cross over to Hell to cultivate, after five years, the best result you can achieve is Fourth Order God Realm.”

“At that time, you might be able to defeat Jiang Bi with ease, replacing him as the number one among the inner disciples, but he’s far from being Xiang Mingzhi’s equal. Don’t mention Xiang Mingzhi, any of their top ten inner disciples can defeat you without breaking a sweat!”

“Old Dragon, speak, what do you have in mind?” Huang Xiaolong asked. Theoretically, it was impossible to advance from peak mid-Second Order God Realm to Fifth Order God Realm in a short five years, but somehow, Huang Xiaolong felt that the Old Dragon might have a way.

As expected, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke, “It’s not that there’s no way about it. During my years, I found a treasure map, if you can get your hands on that treasure, there would be some hope to break through to Fifth Order God Realm in five years’ time!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t imagine that Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi would genuinely have a way.

“Treasure?” Huang Xiaolong’s interest was stirred, urging, “There are sacred grade divine pellets in that place?”

Above divine grade spirit pellets were sacred grade divine pellets. Each and every sacred grade divine pellet contained unfathomable medicinal effects that could enhance a God Realm master’s strength by leaps and bounds.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi nodded, “Indeed. Among the treasures of the treasure map I have, there’s sure to be sacred grade divine pellets, but the most important thing within is not the sacred grade divine pellets. Moreover, even if it is sacred grade divine pellet, it cannot help you break through to Fifth Order God Realm within five years.”

“What is it then?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t think of anything better than a sacred grade divine pellet.

“It’s a Highgod Realm divine dragon’s beast core,” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said. “And, as far as I know, there’s more than one.”

Highgod Realm divine dragon’s beast core!

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, then his breathing quickened. Highgod Realm divine dragon’s beast core!

“That’s right, Highgod Realm divine dragons’ beast core!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi continued, “It’s just that, this treasure... is located deep within the Hailstone Mainland, a very dangerous place, even for a high-level God Realm master, the chance of survival does not exceed one-tenth. Venturing into that place at your current strength, the chance of survival does not even reach a one-hundredth!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly.

It didn’t cross his mind that this hidden treasure would be in Hailstone Mainland. He had heard of this Hailstone Mainland before, one of the top perilous lands of the Black Tortoise Galaxy. According to rumors, on this Hailstone Mainland lived Highgod Realm ice element demonic beasts! Although he couldn’t be considered weak, he was no different than a little ant before a Highgod Realm demonic beast.

At this time, soft footsteps sounded behind him that prompted him to turn around. It was Shi Xiaofei.

“Big brother Huang, you’re still awake?” Shi Xiaofei asked.

“Can’t sleep, I was thinking about some matters.” Huang Xiaolong replied.

“Thinking about the auction?’ Shi Xiaofei asked. “Say, do you think that Crazy Lady Senior will come?”

Huang Xiaolong reached out, holding Shi Xiaofei’s petite hand in his palm, comforting softly, “She’ll come. Master said she has always been looking for a sacred grade immortal spirit stone, and once she heard about the news that the Black Warrior Auction House released, she will definitely come.”

Huang Xiaolong knew what Shi Xiaofei was worried about, he too hoped that her Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique could be awakened even a day faster.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong left the Divine Fort Residence, having decided to go to the Hailstone Mainland to search for the treasure Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke of.
