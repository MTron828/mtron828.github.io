Chapter 3661: Search!

“Where is that Huang Xiaolong now?” Ancestor Chen Bi asked.

Chen Bi could tell that his ancestor was finally going to take action and he sniggered in his heart. “That brat came with a few of his subordinates to climb the Heavenly Peak. They should have arrived.”

“Arrived?” Ancestor Chen Bi turned to look at the crowd around him.

The Heavenly Peak was massive and it spanned hundreds of million of miles. It was indeed quite impossible to look for several people in the crowd.

As the clouds were still dissipating, the restrictions around the Heavenly Peak hadn’t loosened yet. There were some experts who tried to use their dao souls to probe around and they were attacked by the restrictions! Their dao souls were seriously injured, and they lost their minds.

Not even half-step Universe Gods dared to use their dao souls before the restrictions disappeared.

“The Heavenly Peak will close in a month. We’ll look for them after this is over.” Du Chengjiang said.

Ancestor Chen Bi nodded in agreement.

“Lord Ancestor, why don’t we go look around for him now?” Chen Bi said all of a sudden.

“Alright.” Ancestor Chen Bi muttered. “If you find him, report back to me immediately.”

The disciples of the Chen Family started their search. They went to look for traces of Huang Xiaolong and all those they saw around him.

Despite their best efforts, they failed to catch a glimpse of them.

Seeing as the clouds were about to disappear, Chen Bi started to panic.

The disciples of the Zhu Family were doing the same thing as them! Despite the number of Zhu Family disciples in the crowd, they failed to find Huang Xiaolong all the same.

Soon, the shadow of the mountain peak appeared in the air.

Massive platforms started to appear around the Heavenly Peak.

“Ascend!” One of the experts yelled excitedly.

Countless experts made their move as they rushed towards the platforms in the air.

“Young Master, it’s time to climb the mountain!” One of the disciples around Chen Bi yelled. “We’ll look for them after the Heavenly Peak closes! Once it does, that brat won’t be able to escape!”

“He can count himself lucky… I’ll let him live for one more month!” Chen Bi snoted before turning towards the mountain.

At that moment, Gui Chi was staring at the peak of the mountain with a heated gaze.

He wanted to use the chance to transform the two great worlds in his body! When that happened, his combat strength would also break through the 20 billion units mark!

As for Jian Wushuang, he felt the sword qi in his body heating up slightly.

“Climb the mountain at your own pace. There’s no need to worry about me.” Huang Xiaolong noticed the looks in their eyes and he said.

Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Wu Xin, and Ye Ye glanced at each other before bowing respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Lord, we’ll start our ascension now.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Go ahead.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The four of them moved at once as they arrived on the first platform. They didn’t stop as the pressure on the first platform failed to obstruct them. They immediately moved on to the second platform.

“Let’s head up too…” Huang Xiaolong laughed as he looked at Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er.

Tao Han’er giggled, “I want to follow you up there!”

“Me too!” Yu Xiaohong revealed an enchanting smile.

With a helpless shake of his head, Huang Xiaolong explained, “I’m going to try to reach the peak of the mountain! You won’t be able to follow me up there.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The stronger they were, the higher they could climb. That was a fact. There was no way the two of them could follow him, considering the difference in their strength.

“Regardless, we wish to start the climb with you!” Tao Han’er pouted.

“Alright, alright.” Huang Xiaolong smiled before soaring up to the first platform.

The platforms were filled with intricate runes and Huang Xiaolong found them to be slightly similar to the runes in the Universe Boat.

As he stepped onto the first platform, he felt a mysterious energy entering his body. It was like a warm current that extended to every corner of his being. His three great dao souls felt a sense of enlightenment.

Refining the energy from the first platform in the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong took another step and arrived on the second platform.

Yu Xiaohong appeared beside him the moment he did, but Tao Han’er wasn’t so capable. She remained motionless on the first platform.

As a Second Resurrection Dao Venerable, she needed one day’s time to digest the energy from the first platform!

One could only advance after refining the energy on the platform they were on. If they tried to force their way up, they would receive a backlash from the Heavenly Peak.

Tao Han’er could only watch as Huang Xiaolong and Yu Xiaohong got further and further away!

Huang Xiaolong continued up the platforms at a leisurely pace.

Initially, Yu Xiaohong was able to keep up with him. However, she started falling behind soon enough.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to catch up to Wu Xin and Ye Ye.

Next came Gui Chi and finally, he overtook Jian Wushuang.

All of them looked at Huang Xiaolong with admiration in their eyes. Wu Xin turned to Ye Ye and asked, “Do you think His Highness will be able to reach the peak?”

“It’s hard to say. Lord Ferocious Devil and Lord Green Ghost tried to do so, but neither one of them managed to do it. Lord Ferocious Devil once said that only Universe Gods would be able to arrive at the peak.

The five overlords tried to ascend the Heavenly Peak more than once in the past. However, not even the strongest of them all, the Ferocious Devil, could reach the top.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

As Huang Xiaolong stood at the halfway point, his speed started to slow down. He looked down towards the foot of the mountain and tried to look at all the experts below him. Every single platform contained its own world and one couldn’t see too far away. Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see further than ten platforms down.

“Is it really true that only Universe Gods can reach the top?” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He knew what the Ferocious Devil said. However, he wanted to challenge the fact and arrive at the peak of the mountain without reaching the Universe God Realm!

After taking several breaths, Huang Xiaolong continued to ascend.
