Chapter 329: Unable To Rescue?

Huang Xiaolong and giant ghost Feng Yang climbed up to the first floor upon entering the restaurant, but he didn’t expect to run into the restaurant’s boss just as he stepped on the second floor. Seeing Huang Xiaolong, the boss’s eyes widened to the size of fists, he was so excited that there were tremors in his voice, “You, you’re Young Noble Huang?!”

Although it had been many years since Huang Xiaolong left the Luo Tong Royal City, and just as many years since he visited the Delicious Restaurant, the boss still recognized Huang Xiaolong in one glance.

He might forget others, but not Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong was someone that represented the Luo Tong Kingdom in the in Duanren Empire’s Imperial City Battle, the legendary figure that won the first place, how could he forget!!!

That year, Huang Xiaolong won the Duanren Imperial City Battle’s first place, when the news was sent back to the Luo Tong Kingdom, celebrations were held throughout the kingdom. King Lu Zhe held a three-day celebration feast when he announced the glorious achievement!

Moreover, the boss was well aware that Huang Xiaolong was someone that even the sole Marshal of Luo Tong Kingdom, Marshal Haotian was respectful to!

Watching the restaurant boss’s expression, Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded slightly, he didn’t expect the boss to remember him after so many years.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong admitted his identity, the boss grew more enthusiastic, nearly performing a full kneel and kowtow to salute Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong easily stopped the boss’s action, extending his left hand out, indicating him to stand up while his eyes looked at him and then the surroundings meaningfully.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s actions, the restaurant boss instantly understood that Huang Xiaolong didn’t want others to know of his presence. Only then did he hurried to a stand, but even so, his demeanor was of utmost respect, the angle of his waist probably exceeded ninety degrees. He personally led Huang Xiaolong to a secluded section and took Huang Xiaolong’s orders.

Other customers noticed the complaisant attitude of the restaurant boss before Huang Xiaolong, most were shocked and curious.

A short while later, the boss excused himself respectfully.

While waiting for the dishes to arrive, the sudden loud commotion on the streets attracted Huang Xiaolong’s attention. Huang Xiaolong looked outside through the restaurant’s window and saw the common subjects moving in small and large groups heading in one direction.

At this time, discussions on tables nearby reached his ears.

“Quickly eat, after we finish eating we’re rushing over to the square across the palace doors to watch a good show!” One customer said.

“Life is really strange, ah, who would’ve thought that, as a Prince, Lu Kai would end up so tragically.” Another person commented.

Lu Kai?! Huang Xiaolong was stunned hearing Lu Kai’s name being mentioned.

‘What is happening?’

“Young Noble Huang, your dishes are here.” At this point, the restaurant boss returned, personally bringing Huang Xiaolong his dishes.

As he put the plates one by one on Huang Xiaolong’s table, Huang Xiaolong questioned, “About Lu Kai, what’s that all about?”

The restaurant boss’ action lagged for a second, not knowing what to say. It was known to many people in the Royal City that Huang Xiaolong and Prince Lu Kai were good friends back in the day, thus he also knew. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Speak!” Huang Xiaolong’s face sank, exuding a powerful momentum that enveloped the entire restaurant. The noisy restaurant instantly fell into a dead silence, the customers all around were filled with apprehension.

Whereas the restaurant boss was so scared that he fell to his knees, “Huang, Young Noble Huang...” ashen face and cold sweat, he looked at Huang Xiaolong with awe.

Watching the restaurant boss’ reaction, Huang Xiaolong converged the terrifying pressure he released, slightly adjusting his expression as he said, “First, stand up.”

Not daring to delay, the restaurant boss hurried to his feet, respectfully recounting the matter from the beginning to Huang Xiaolong in a trembling voice.

The more Huang Xiaolong listened, the gloomier the expression on his face became.

Until the end, the restaurant boss noticed the hot dishes he just served moment ago with steam still curling were now covered with layers of white ice. They were in the peak of spring, where did this ice come from?

Finished telling the matter, the restaurant boss felt his throat feel dry and itchy as he stood there, not daring to move.

In plain words, Lu Kai’s younger brother, Lu Jing, in order to seize the kingdom’s throne, joined a sect that called themselves Wind God Cult, worshipping the Sect Leader as Master, working hand in glove on a conspiracy. Controlling King Lu Zhe, they forced him to renounce Lu Kai’s Prince status and throw him into the dungeon.

They even announced that Lu Kai will be brought to the square opposite the palace doors for public beheading!

“How much time till the execution?” A moment of silence later, Huang Xiaolong looked at the restaurant boss.

The restaurant boss looked at the sky outside, answering, “Around one hour’s time.”

One hour. Huang Xiaolong stood up, preparing to leave with giant ghost Feng Yang.

Guessing what Huang Xiaolong wanted to do, the restaurant boss courageously stepped in, “Young Noble Huang, I know you want to rescue Prince Lu Kai, but with just the two of you, it’s impossible to cope with the tens of thousands of palace guards. At that time, not only will you fail to rescue Prince Lu Kai, you might even lose your life in this gamble.”

That year, when Huang Xiaolong relocated his family to Duanren Imperial City, Marshal Haotian also went, following beside the Huang Family. Thus, Huang Xiaolong had no reinforcement in Luo Tong Royal City anymore. If he planned to rescue Prince Lu Kai with a mere two people, in the restaurant boss’ opinion, it was a hopeless feat, regardless if Huang Xiaolong was the champion of Duanren Imperial City Battle and had already broken through to Xiantian.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the restaurant boss and smiled, “Lose my life in this gamble?” He was not angry, for he understood that the restaurant boss reminded him out of good intentions.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was still nonchalant about the matter, he grew solemn, emphasizing, “Yes, I know that Young Noble Huang has broken through the Xiantian realm, but other than the numerous palace guards, I’ve heard that the person responsible for guarding Prince Lu Kai was a peak late-Xiantian Second Order expert.”

“Peak late-Xiantian Second Order?” Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded. A small kingdom such as Luo Tong Kingdom has a peak late-Xiantian Second Order.

The restaurant boss nodded gravely, “That’s right. An expert from the Wind God Cult, also Lu Jing’s Eldest Senior Brother, named He Hui.”

‘So, someone from Wind God Cult, Huang Xiaolong mused, but where did this Wind God Cult pop out from? Even the restaurant boss doesn’t know.’

No matter what hole they came out from, it was fated that the Wind God Cult would be destroyed.

“Keep the dishes warm, after I rescue my brother, I’ll come drink with him.” Huang Xiaolong said to the restaurant boss laughingly, a finger casually pointed at the table of food.

The restaurant boss blanked momentarily before he understood the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words, Huang Xiaolong and giant ghost Feng Yang’s silhouettes had vanished from his sight.

The restaurant boss looked dazedly at the spot where Huang Xiaolong and the giant ‘man’ stood earlier, now it was empty and airy. A long time passed before he shook his head, muttering to himself, “I hope that the Heavens bless Young Noble Huang so that he can escape from this disaster.” He didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong and his friend had any chances of rescuing Lu Kai.

At this time, the palace’s main doors slowly opened. Lu Kai, with his four limbs chained down to an iron column, escorted out by a group of palace guards, all the way to the square center. Lines of palace guards barricaded the square’s perimeter tightly.

Commoners that came to watch a lively show crowded the square some distance away, pointing fingers and shaking heads, some with pity, some gloated.
