“One month later, when you guys are heading to the celebratory banquet, come call me...” Huang Xiaolong told Liu Yilong and the others.

“You got it, Big bro.” All of them eagerly answered.

“Big bro, I heard that the demonic beast clan’s Piercing Sky Beast King has issued a Piercing Sky Absolute Kill Order on you, anyone who kills you and brings your head as proof will be rewarded with ten billion Zhuque coins!” Liu Yilong hesitated then said, “Big bro, if you’re going out of the institute, you must be careful.”

Piercing Sky Absolute Kill Order?

Huang Xiaolong nodded at Liu Yilong, “I know.”

Liu Yilong was slightly dejected at Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant response, sullenly asking, “Big bro, you’re not worried even a little bit?”Any other people would have gone deathly pale at the mention of the Piercing Sky Absolute Kill Order.

That was the Piercing Sky Beast King ah, one of the demonic beast clans’ most powerful Beast Kings.

Huang Xiaolong laughed with ease, “What’s to worry about? Isn’t it just a Piercing Sky Beast King?”

Just a Piercing Sky Beast King? Liu Yilong and the others secretly slapped their foreheads, looking at Huang Xiaolong in speechlessness.

Then again, they were used to Cheng Huai’an’s arrogance and show off personality, therefore no one felt like it was strange.

Those people’s expressions didn’t escape Huang Xiaolong’s notice. He knew what they were thinking, but he did not elaborate on the matter. Huang Xiaolong changed the subject, saying, “Alright, if there’s nothing else, I’m heading to the library.”

When Liu Yilong and the rest heard this, they looked oddly at Huang Xiaolong.

“I say, Big bro, you weren’t hexed or something, right?” Liu Yilong asked cautiously, his gaze fixed on Huang Xiaolong, “You did nothing these years except standing dazedly in the library?”

Cheng Huai’an was famous in the past because of his imperious and licentious personality.

Whereas now, Cheng Huai’an was famous because he had turned into a fool.

In recent years, Cheng Huai’an only did one thing; stand dazedly in front of a bookshelf inside the Vermilion Bird Institute library, no different than a fool, paying no attention to anything else.

Including the famed beauty of the Vermilion Bird Institute, Qi Qianqian, their Big bro was cold and aloof.

Some said that Cheng Huai’an was cursed, that’s why he was acting this way. Even his lower part was cursed and couldn’t be used anymore. Otherwise, how could he remain untempted facing a beautiful woman like Qi Qianqian?

“It’s you guys who are cursed.” Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, snapping at the lot of them, “Scram now! If not, I’ll throw all of you down from the peak.”

Only then did Liu Yilong and the others run away in panic.

After they left, Huang Xiaolong headed to the Vermilion Bird Institute library as usual.

Huang Xiaolong was aware of the rumors going around the Vermilion Bird Institute regarding Cheng Huai’an, it was just that he had no interest in rectifying anything. After all, he would be leaving this Vermilion Bird Institute in two years or so. His main focus at the moment was pinpointing the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire’s location.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong descended on the Lone Solitude Peak where the library was.

Standing in front of the building, Huang Xiaolong saw that the library’s surroundings were decorated with colorful festive lanterns bearing good wishes, the peak was planted with many red colored plants that signified prosperity and good luck.

He Feifan’s breakthrough added another Highgod Realm master to the Vermilion Bird Institute. All the important peaks in the Vermilion Bird Institute were decorated with the same festive red decorations.

Those inner disciples and elite disciples entering and leaving the library were smiling more than usual, every word that came out of their mouths was about He Feifan.

Huang Xiaolong closed his mind to all of this as he walked into the library, stopping on the sixth underground floor and continuing where he left off last time.

The days passed.

As the days grew nearer to He Feifan’s celebratory banquet, the Vermilion Bird Institute’s atmosphere became increasingly lively.

The Vermilion Bird Institute Principal even announced a reward for all inner disciples, elite disciples, Elders and Grand Elders.

The inner disciples were rewarded with one hundred low saint grade spirit pellets and one hundred low saint grade spirit stones, whereas the elite disciples received one hundred top saint grade spirit pellets and one hundred top saint grade spirit stones.

Elders and Grand Elders’ rewards were even more extravagant, however, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to go collect these spirit pellets and spirit stones...

To the current Huang Xiaolong, this grade of spirit pellets and spirit stones was something he deemed a waste of time to pick up even if there was a pile of them on the ground right under his feet.

One month quickly passed, and finally, the day of the celebratory banquet arrived.

On this day, the sun had just peeked out on the horizon, but Liu Yilong and several others of ChengHuai’an’s followers were already on their way to the Lightning Fire Peak.

They were practically dragging Huang Xiaolong along as they flew in an excited but hurried manner toward the Vermilion Bird Peak.

He Feifan’s celebration ceremony banquet was held on the Vermilion Bird Peak.

Some distance from the Vermilion Bird Peak, Huang Xiaolong, Liu Yilong and the rest could already see people crowding the mountain from the foothills to the peak.

There was a sea of humans moving here and there on the mountain, like a battalion of black ants. Still, from afar, many people could be seen flying to the Vermilion Bird Peak, some were the institute’s disciples, mixed with disciples of other super forces and sects.

Huang Xiaolong’s group flew and landed on the square in front of the guest reception hall.

“That’s the Celestial Peach Sect’s Patriarch?!”

“Ye Family Ancestor!”

Just as their feet touched the ground, Liu Yilong’s widened his eyes looking at the masters passing by in the distance, exclaiming in an exaggerated fashion.

Both the Celestial Peace Sect and Ye Family were super forces of the Vermilion Bird Galaxy. Old monsters like the Celestial Peach Sect Patriarch and Ye Family Ancestor hadn’t appeared in public for a good number of years, who would have thought these old monsters would appear in this celebratory banquet.

Liu Yilong and his other buddies were exclaiming these legendary existences’ names one after another when the crowd behind them suddenly rippled with excitement.

“It’s Senior Brother He Feifan, Senior Brother He Feifan is here!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s Vice Principal He Feifan!”

In a split second, the crowd up in front also began to stir with excitement.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder. A tall, handsome looking young man in a white brocade robe was flying to the top of the Vermilion Bird Peak with a train of other disciples following him, descending on the Vermilion Bird peak’s square.

This young man was none of other than He Feifan.

A second later, the disciples following behind He Feifan rushed up to Huang Xiaolong and Liu Yilong’s group, snapping rudely, “Punk, are the lof you blind? Didn’t you see that Vice Principal He Feifan is coming over, what are you lot standing like a wood blocking the path for? Quickly roll to the side!”

One of them stepped up, wanting to push away Huang Xiaolong who was standing in the middle of their path.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed dangerously, a sharp light glinted in their depths.

The disciple that was about to push Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, recognizing Huang Xiaolong a second later.

“Cheng Huai’an, it’s you.” A middle-aged man in Elder robe walked over to them, wearing a cold sneer as he watched Huang Xiaolong, “Can’t you see that Vice Principal He Feifan is walking over, why aren’t you rolling over to the side?”

This middle-aged man was none other than Liang Guang’s Second Senior Brother, Wang Qingjiang.

Due to Liang Guang’s incident, Wang Qingjiang was subjected to strict investigation and was interrogation by Vermilion Bird Institute. Naturally, he bore a deep grudge towards Huang Xiaolong.

Liu Yilong and the others hurried forward, smiling and grinning at Wang Qingjiang, and pulled Huang Xiaolong away to the side.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group retreated to the side, He Feifan walked over, brushing past Huang Xiaolong without a glance.

To him, who had broken through Highgod Realm, only people of certain status such as Patriarchs of super forces and families, Sect Chiefs, and Ancestors deserved his attention. An Institute Elder like Cheng Huai’an or the elite disciples were nothing but measly existences in his eyes.
