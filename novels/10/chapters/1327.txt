Unknowingly, three months passed.

Huang Xiaolong could absorb pinky-sized lightning energy strands into his body by now. A numbing pain was tingling all over his body, while his three supreme godheads were spinning at unprecedented speed, swallowing the lightning energy like a whale drinking water.

By this time, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had already reached the peak of mid-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm.

The general norm was that the higher one’s cultivation, the slower was their cultivation improvement. However, Huang Xiaolong had completely overthrown this norm because as time passed, his comprehension of lightning element esoteric deepened, and the rate of his lightning element energy absorption also increased. The more lightning element energy he absorbed, the faster his strength rose.

Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had progressed shockingly as it had reached the late-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm!

This speed was unheard of until now.

Other high-level Ancient God Realm masters would only advance one small order with ten years of hard work. Zhu Feng, and even Wang Wei were examples of such high-level Ancient God Realm masters.

After Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation reached late-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm, his strength continued to rise daily.

It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation reached peak late-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm, and breakthrough to Ninth Order Ancient God Realm with an irresistible force!

The instant Huang Xiaolong broke through to Ninth Order Ancient God Realm, the lightning sea roiled violently from below as a strong golden light burst out from the lightning sea, and the waves reached several hundred feet high.

An overwhelming power burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body like a hurricane, sweeping outwards in all the four directions. Air blasts reverberated in the air.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others were awakened by this overwhelming momentum.

When they discovered Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Ninth Order Ancient God Realm, their jaws dropped all the way down to their chests in shock.

“Is Manor Lord the reincarnation of an ancient great emperor?” Feng Er muttered under her breath subconsciously.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng shook his head and said, “Could ancient great emperor breakthrough to Ninth Order Ancient God Realm from Eighth Order Ancient God Realm in one year?"

Gui Yi and Gui Er shook their heads like a rattle-drum as they answered in unison: "No!"

No!

That’s right, even an ancient great emperor with supreme godhead would not have this cultivation speed in the chaos lightning pool!

Since an ancient great emperor would have been unable to do this, then...?!

When everyone thought of the existence above ancient great emperor, their breaths quickened subconsciously.

“Is M-manor, Manor Lord the reincarnation more scary than that?!” Feng Er had some difficulty breathing as she said this and her voice quivered.

“May-maybe!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng was also quivering. However, that level of existence was not something they could think of, hence, he didn’t dare to say anything with certainty.

Suddenly, a thunderous blast shook the space as a terrifying momentum broke out from another direction. Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er immediately turned to look towards the little cow. Purple lightning that was enshrouding the little cow opened up like blossoming petals around her.

Everyone was left dumbfounded, as they could sense that the pressure from the little cow was no weaker than pressure exerted by Huang Xiaolong.

“Se-Sen-nior Xiaoniu wouldn’t be that kind of existence too, right?!” Gui Yi gulped loudly.

“May-maybe!” Xu Baisheng repeated with the same quivering voice.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were unaware of these conversations, as they had long entered into an ethereal state, temporarily detaching themselves from the outside world.

Huang Xiaolong felt like he was floating in an ocean of lightning, that was warm and soft. He could even hear the gurgling from the depths of the sea, like music in the air.

...

Two years went by.

The sound coming from the depths of the lightning ocean grew louder like it was imprinted on his soul. Seemingly, only this sound existed in the world.

Three years, four years...

Sitting cross-legged above the golden lightning sea, Huang Xiaolong’s figure was submerged by lightning. Compared to four years ago, Huang Xiaolong had grown many times stronger akin to the golden lightning sea below.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s progress had slowed down slightly after he had broken through to Ninth Order Ancient God Realm, it was still shocking. In these four years, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had not only reached Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, but it had reached the peak of early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

However, he needed more energy to advance through the Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, not to mention, his three supreme godheads needed even more energy than an average cultivator. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong’s progress slowed further after he advanced to Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

Six years passed by.

At one point, Huang Xiaolong’s figure was actually emitting ripples of lightning liquid from above the golden lightning sea !

Golden-colored lightning liquid!

These ripples of golden lightning liquid was exactly the same as the ripples on the golden lightning sea’s surface.

At first, these ripples were broken and intermittent like raindrops splattering on leaves of trees, but as time passed, these ripples became stronger, frequent, and smoother, and then slowly started gathering into a puddle around Huang Xiaolong.

In the blink of an eye, eight years were gone. The golden lightning puddle around Huang Xiaolong had accumulated into a lake, and it was still expanding. As if influenced by the ripples from Huang Xiaolong’s body, the golden lightning sea below him had started emitting lightning mists.

......

After ten years, the golden lightning lake from around Huang Xiaolong’s body began merging with the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool.

At this point in time, Huang Xiaolong had broken through to late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

......

By the fifteenth year, Huang Xiaolong’s physical body strangely melted into a golden lightning liquid, including his three supreme godheads!

This was not an illusion.

Huang Xiaolong seemed to have turned into a part of the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool.

Suddenly, on this day, the golden lightning in the air became chaotic. The golden lightning flood-dragon roared nonstop, and the waves rose high in the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool, as if a fearsome lightning beast was about to be born.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and the little cow were jolted awake from their cultivation.

“What is happening?!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng exclaimed in shock. The chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s energy was violent, as if it was going to crumble into pieces!

The little cow looked towards a certain spot in the air above the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool. She looked beyond astounded as she exclaimed, “This kid, has he already comprehended the lightning pool’s esoteric?!”

Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and others were stupefied. ‘What?! Manor Lord has comprehended the chaos lighting pool’s esoteric? But, how many years has it been? Didn’t Senior Xiaoniu mention that it would take several hundred years?’

Everyone followed the little cow’s gaze and looked at a certain spot above the lightning sea, but none of them could see anything.

Right at that time, a bright pool of golden lightning liquid glimmered from that direction. In the next second, arms extended out from it, then a torso, head, legs, and then finally eyes.

Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and even the little cow looked bewildered as they watched Huang Xiaolong gradually emerging from the pool of golden lightning liquid. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“This kid, could he have acquired the knowledge about the embodiment of all living beings, since he is able to change his form into a beast, liquid, etc?” The little cow muttered under her breath.

After Huang Xiaolong had completely recovered his original body, the golden lightning sea actually moved! Not just moved, but it actually shrank! The chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool was shrinking in size, so was the whole space.

Everyone’s jaws were agape at this sight.

...Could it be?! A possibility flashed in the little cow’s mind.
