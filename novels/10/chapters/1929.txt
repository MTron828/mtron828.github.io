Huang Xiaohai shot towards the inner hall and retrieved the Ginseng King.

The body of the herb was transparent, and it emitted a dense aura of vitality. As soon as Huang Xiaohai brought it over to Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong circulated his radiance energy to wrap around the Ginseng King. He slowly brought it to the Ascending Moon Old Man’s lips.

As soon as the Ginseng King entered his mouth, it seemed like the old man’s body found a path to survival. Color returned to his ghastly white face.

Huang Xiaolong slowly circulated his radiance godforce around the old man’s body.

Finally, they managed to hear the Ascending Moon Old Man’s soft breaths again, and he struggled to open his eyes. When he saw Huang Xiaolong’s face, a smile formed on his lips. “Little brat Huang, I never thought that I would dream of you before I die. Godd*mn!”

Huang Xiaohai and the others couldn’t help but laugh.

“Old man, why are you so sure that you’ll die? Are you really tired of living?” A chuckle escaped Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Relax. You’re not dreaming. I’m back, and there is no way I’m letting you die.”

“I’m not dreaming?!” The Ascending Moon Old Man widened his eyes in shock and scanned his surroundings. He was greeted with the sight of Huang Xiaohai, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the others. He finally realized that he was at the entrance of the Abundant Deities Manor.

After his eyes spun one complete round, the Ascending Moon Old Man stared at Huang Xiaolong with his eyes wide open. “You... Brat... Are you truly back?!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Yes, I’m back.” He paused for a moment before continuing, “I’m back to see all of you.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man felt his body tremble, and a look of excitement appeared on his face. “God d*mn! You’re finally back to visit this old man! I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see the hair on your lips even after crawling into my coffin!”

The hair on his lips?!

Huang Xiaolong forced a bitter smile onto his face as he looked at the old man.

He realized that the old man’s behavior hadn’t changed even after so many years had passed. Everything felt so familiar, as though he had never left.

“Alright, alright. Stop talking. Your condition isn’t stable yet. I’ll help you recover, and you can talk whatever nonsense you want after you recover,” Huang Xiaolong said.

The injuries on the Ascending Moon Old Man’s body were really terrifying, and despite using the Ginseng King to heal his wounds, they barely managed to keep him alive. Huang Xiaolong needed to give him proper treatment if he wanted to return to his peak.

The Ascending Moon Old Man nodded his head and allowed Huang Xiaolong to bring him back into the Abundant Deities Manor.

After choosing one of the secret rooms located in the manor, Huang Xiaolong started to treat the old man’s injuries.

Huang Xiaohai, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the others waited outside patiently.

In a flash, night fell.

Compared to the bustle in the morning, Divine Dan City quietened down, and it seemed to fall asleep in the night. However, the peace was unnerving as everyone knew that something big was about to go down.

In the day, the streets were full, and experts streamed in and out of various shops. Countless beasts stomped about, dragging carts behind them, but all of those were a stark contrast to the sight of the streets at night. Not a single soul could be seen, and even if there were people walking about, they would be sneaking about with anxious looks plastered on their faces.

A suppressive air hung above Divine Dan City, and everyone knew that the peaceful night was merely the calm before the storm.

When Wangu Rui was killed, no one had felt as though anything big would go down. After all, it was just a disciple of the Wangu Clan. However, when all the experts of the Wangu Clan’s branch in Divine Dan City were wiped out, the hearts of all the present experts shook. They knew that something big was definitely going to happen.

In the past hundred years, the Huang Family had been suppressed to the point of asphyxiation by the Wangu Clan. Could this be their counter-attack? Were they finally making a final stand?

In the Mu Family’s branch...

All the experts of the Mu Family were gathered together in the main hall.

“I received news that Wangu Wudi has gathered all the experts under him. More than a hundred superpowers are sending their experts over to Divine Dan City as we speak. There are several hundred thousand of them.” The grand elder of the Mu Family, Mu Rong, said in a solemn voice.

An elder, Mu Jingzhi, shook his head and said. “I have no idea what the Huang Family is thinking. Why would they kill all the experts from the Wangu Clan stationed in Divine Dan City after killing Wangu Rui?! Are they tired of living? With so many experts, Wangu Wudi is definitely going to exterminate the Huang Family!”

Almost a hundred superpowers! That was the collective strength Wangu Wudi has gathered to deal with the Huang Family! Their scalps turned numb just thinking about it.

The combined strength of all of them would be able to destroy anything in their path!

Even a Heavenly God would fall at their hands!

“This matter has alarmed our old ancestor, Mu Qi. I’ve heard that all of them are making their way to Divine Dan City as we speak,” Mu Rong said.

“What?! Ancestor Mu Qi is coming here?!” The other elders swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock. Mu Qi was the strongest expert in their Mu Family, and he hadn’t appeared for several hundreds of years. No one had expected him to personally head over to Divine Dan City.

Mu Rong nodded his head before he continued, “I’ve heard that Ancestor Mu Rong had a pretty good relationship with the previous director, Huang Xiaolong. He is probably coming over to plead on behalf of the Huang Family. If that is the case, things will go south really quickly. Wangu Wudi has already warned that he would destroy every family who dares to plead for mercy on behalf of the Huang Family!”

Despite the Mu Family being part of the ten strongest superpowers, they severely lacked when it came to the number-one ranked Wangu Clan.

Looks of panic appeared on the faces of all the present elders.

“What! I hope Ancestor Mu Qi doesn’t do anything stupid...”

The sun eventually rose, and a new day started.

The day of the competition arrived!

People filled the streets, and it seemed as though the entire population of Divine Dan City was headed in the same direction.

Wangu Wudi left his residence early in the morning. He led whatever remained of his disciples towards the competition venue.

“We greet Lord Wudi!”

“Senior Wudi!”

On the way, many people greeted Wangu Wudi fervently.

Wangu Wudi scanned his surroundings like an emperor surveying his subjects and nodded with satisfaction.

“I’ve heard that several disciples from the Huang Family have enrolled in the competition...?” Wangu Wudi turned and asked an elder from the union.

“Yes, Lord Wudi, that is indeed the case.”

“Cancel their participation rights. They should not appear on the competition grounds.” After he spoke, he thought for a moment before relaying another order. “Pass down my order! No Huang Family’s disciple is allowed a thousand meters from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union!”

“Yes.” The elder didn’t dare to refute, and he immediately left to convey Wangu Wudi’s order.

......

In the secret room of the Huang Family, Huang Xiaolong released a long sigh. After all his efforts, he had finally managed to stabilize the Ascending Moon Old Man’s condition.

When he saw that the old man was fast asleep, Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and left the secret room.

“Big brother, we managed to gather news that it was Wangu Wudi who dismissed the Ascending Moon Old Man from his position. When the Senior Ascending Moon scolded him, Wangu Wudi began his ruthless attacks.” Huang Xiaohai revealed everything he had managed to learn about the situation the moment Huang Xiaolong appeared.

Huang Xiaolong’s face sank. “Is today the day of the Alchemist Association’s competition?”

“That’s right. Wangu Wudi is taking part in it,” Huang Xiaohai replied.

“Let’s go. We’ll take a look at that scoundrel b*stard.” Huang Xiaolong’s frosty voice echoed through the air.
