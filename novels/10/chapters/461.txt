Chapter 462: Running Into the Lion Tribe

Immediately, Huang Xiaolong sped off in one direction, tracing the dragon scent. A short while later, he reached the bottom of a cliff.

Indeed, there was Dragon God Grass! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up.

Looking up on the cliff wall, around a hundred zhang high, there were three little plants protruding out, shaped like majestic primordial divine dragons.

Huang Xiaolong leaped up, his hand reaching out to grasp the three stalks of Dragon God Grass, but exactly at this moment, a figure rushed at him at breakneck speed as wind howled behind him. The figure punched at Huang Xiaolong with undisguised killing intent.

The fist force struck out like surging layers of tsunami, containing the power to destroy everything in its path.

Alarmed at the sudden ambush, Huang Xiaolong had no time to collect the Dragon God Grass at this moment, his body swiftly whirled around and countered the attack with his palm.

A booming blast rendered the air and gravel crumbled down from the cliff wall.

Huang Xiaolong landed gently on the ground from mid air.

“Ei!” The attacker was surprised that Huang Xiaolong was able to take a hit from him head on, then another two figures were seen speeding towards them.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, these three people were clearly part of one group. Moreover, judging from their dressing and appearance, all three were members of the Lion Tribe. On top of that, all three were Saint realm experts.

Two of the three were high-level Saint realm experts, while the youngest one was slightly weaker, a Fifth Order Saint realm.

The youngest one walked over, scrutinizing Huang Xiaolong from top to bottom, “Human race?” He pointed toward the three stalks Dragon God Grass on the cliff wall and said to Huang Xiaolong, “I want those three stalks of Dragon God Grass. You can leave, I won’t kill you!” the condescending tone was irrefutable.

In that single exchange just now, although Huang Xiaolong was quick, it wasn’t enough for that Lion Tribe expert to pay any attention to him.

“And if I don’t leave?” Huang Xiaolong retorted.

The young one revealed a malicious smile, “Do you think you can fight the three of us? Let me tell you, I’m the Lion Tribe’s Little Patriarch, and these two are Elders of my tribe. Both of them are Eighth Order Saint realm experts.”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained unperturbed.

The truth was, Huang Xiaolong had more or less guessed the young beastman’s identity to be the Lion Tribe’s Jesse, whereas the two Elders, one of them should be Reid and the other Chris.

A few days ago, before entering the Poison Dragon Valley, Huang Xiaolong had inquired about the Lion Tribe’s situation from the Tiger Tribe Patriarch Chuck, including the other ten main beastmen tribes, especially their Saint realm experts. He committed this information to his memory.

The Lion Tribe’s Little Patriarch Jesse went on, “If you entered this Poison Dragon Valley for Dragon God Grass, then you can get out now, not only are these three Dragon God Grass stalks mine, but all the Dragon God Grass inside this Poison Dragon Valley is mine!” he declared with arms around his chest.

Huang Xiaolong snickered at his words, “That means you have a lot of Dragon God Grass? Now, take out all the Dragon God Grass and hand it over!”

Evidently this Lion Tribe’s Little Patriarch was also aiming for the Dragon God Grass coming to the Poison Dragon Valley. He probably managed to collect quite a few of them.

All three beastmen were stunned and their faces were ugly with anger.

“What did you say just now?!” Jesse’s face was grim, killing intent exploded in his eyes.

“I’m taking all the Dragon God Grass inside this Poison Dragon Valley!” Huang Xiaolong continued calmly, “Also, take out all the Dragon God Grass you have on you and scram!”

“Punk, you’re seeking death!” Jesse’s eyes sparked fire, then he turned to the two Elders behind him, Reid and Chris, “Kill this lowly human scum!”

Reid and Chris nodded. Without a word, both leaped forth, attacking Huang Xiaolong simultaneously.

Huang Xiaolong snorted, aiming a Great Divine Void Fist with his left hand and an Asura Demon Claw with his right hand—attacking with both hands at once.

Loud collision sounds boomed.

Both Reid and Chris’s bodies were forced back, and even Huang Xiaolong staggered a few steps back.

“You!” Both Reid and Chris looked at Huang Xiaolong with shock on their faces. With their strength at Eighth Order Saint realm, Huang Xiaolong’s Seventh Order Saint realm cultivation could hardly be hidden, but now, a Seventh Order Saint realm actually fended off their attacks.

Lion Tribe Little Patriarch Jesse’s eyes also widened in shock.

Watching their faces, a cynical smile flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s face as his figure vanished from view. When he appeared again, Reid and Chris were within an arm’s length, startling them both. Just when they thought that the human was going to attack, a vertical eye split open at the center of his forehead. A glaring red light flickered and the two felt their mind being hit, feeling dizzy and confused.

The next thing they knew, a sharp momentum struck them squarely on the chest, blasting them backward.

Retrieving his hands, Huang Xiaolong watched the two figures with stoic face.

Although these two Lion Tribe Elders were Eighth Order Saint realm, they were only early Eight Order. At Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, defeating these two required almost no effort at all.

After he was done dealing with the two Elders, he turned his attention to the little Little Patriarch, Jesse.

Jesse watched Huang Xiaolong approach warily, recovering his senses as fear crept up his eyes, shouting as he moved back, “You, if you dare to...!”

Huang Xiaolong kicked out, sending Jesse flying back several hundred meters, crashing into the cliff wall. Sliding down the cliff wall, Jesse was bending over and clutching his stomach. A loud groan sounded as blood spurted out from his mouth. That kick from Huang Xiaolong was hard enough to shatter his gallbladder.

Huang Xiaolong slowly walked over to the wall cliff. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“No, don’t, I can give all the Dragon God Grass I have to you!” Jesse blurted in fear, hands waving madly as he took out all the Dragon God Grass from his spatial ring.

Five stalks in total!

A suction force came from Huang Xiaolong’s palm, wrapping around the Dragon God Grass stalks and putting them away into the Asura Ring.

“I’ll scram immediately, I don’t want any Dragon God Grass here in Poison Dragon Valley, I don’t want any!” Jesse stumbled and fell as he scrambled to his feet to flee. Reid and Chris also struggled to their feet, trailing behind Jesse, disappearing in less than a second.

Huang Xiaolong watched the three sorry figures fleeing, but he didn’t pursue.

When the three figures disappeared from view, he leaped up the cliff wall again, collecting the three stalks of Dragon God Grass.

He received five stalks Dragon God Grass from the Lion Tribe’s Little Patriarch, Jesse, and adding the three stalks from the wall cliff, he had a total of eight Dragon God Gras stalks. Huang Xiaolong still had some Dragon God Grass from before, so he could refine another primordial divine dragon.

But he was not in a hurry to leave, instead he proceed deeper, continuing the search.

...

Jesse and the two Elders ran as fast as they could in panic, and when they were sure that the human did not chase after them, the three of them stopped on a random peak. Jesse’s fingers dug into his palm as he glared in Huang Xiaolong’s direction, his eyes filled with rage and hatred: “Lowest of scum dog! There will come a day when I’ll let you die without an intact corpse!”

“Little Patriarch, in just a few more days, the annual tribes’ congregation will take place, and at that time the Patriarch will definitely be elected as the new Beast God, ruling over all beastmen tribes!” Reid added, “Even if we have to dig three feet under, we’ll dig that punk out!”

“Human race!” Jesse’s eyes were tinged scarlet, “When Father rules over the beastmen, the first one I’ll destroy will be none other than the human race!”

“Little Patriarch, shall we return to Alpha Lion City for now?” Chris suggested.

Jesse was unwilling to leave just like that, but he knew that the three of them weren’t Huang Xiaolong’s opponents. In the end, he nodded with reluctance.

“Go!” The three flew away.

Very quickly ten days passed.

In ten days’ time, Huang Xiaolong practically flipped the Poison Dragon Valley over, finding more than twenty stalks of Dragon God Grass. Bearing good harvest, Huang Xiaolong left the Poison Dragon Valley.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong killed numerous poisonous Saint realm creatures, which turned into the Poison Corpse Scarabs’ nourishment, triggering another transformation. The Sea of Devils and Ghosts Array was more powerful with the addition of these souls.

When Huang Xiaolong made it back to the Sacred Tiger City, here were ten days left to the beastmen tribes congregation.
