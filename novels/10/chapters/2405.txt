Chapter 2406: Yu Fujiang’s Desperate Attempt to Escape

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but burst into laughter when he heard Yu Fujiang’s conditions.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Yu Fujiang, who stood haughtily in the middle of the skies, and his holy soul slowly raised its palm. With a single slap, Yu Fujiang was sent crashing into the ground below.

According to what Yu Fujiang said, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate would move to exterminate Huang Xiaolong’s clan if he dared to harm a single hair on his head. However, the slap Huang Xiaolong unleashed sent him straight into the ground. Forget about harming a single strand of hair, but it was more appropriate to say that Huang Xiaolong was ready to pull out every single strand of hair on his body!

“Your Highness!” The two True Saints from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate had not expected Huang Xiaolong to move against Yu Fujiang, and they screamed in shock.

In a flash, they appeared beside Yu Fujiang. After dragging him out of the ground, they stared at his battered face and noticed that even his cheekbones were shifted out of position. That wasn’t all. His skull was deformed, and the once haughty appearance was nowhere to be seen.

Yu Fujiang felt his head spinning, and all he could see were stars.

The experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate glared at Huang Xiaolong, and if looks could kill, he would be dead several times over.

“You... How dare you harm His Highness?! You’re asking to be killed!” One of the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints, who followed Yu Fujiang’s entourage, screamed. However, he was barely able to complete his sentence when Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul sent a punch flying to his face. In an instant, his body was shattered. Circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, Huang Xiaolong devoured his essence energy along with his saint attributes.

Even though he managed to devour the other party’s saint attributes, Huang Xiaolong felt as though it didn’t do too much to aid in the evolution of his own.

Of course, it wasn’t because the other party was trash. However, with his saint attributes ranking in the one hundreds, it was truly ineffective to aid in Huang Xiaolong’s evolution.

“Trashy talent....” Huang Xiaolong shook his head in disappointment.

The members of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate were enraged by his comment. When they noticed how he had devoured their fellow disciple, they couldn’t help but roar in a fury.

Yu Fujiang, who had suffered no small amount of injuries, shook his head as he absorbed energy from his surroundings to restore himself to his peak state. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted, “Brat, you’re definitely going to die! I’ll hunt down your clan and exterminate the faction standing behind you! Do you really think that I won’t be able to do anything to you due to Lin Xiaoying’s support?!”

As soon as the words left his lips, he was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Since Huang Xiaolong wasn’t as merciful as he was previously, Yu Fujiang’s body was lodged into the ground.

“Attack!” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with the rage of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and he quickly ordered the experts on his side to make their move.

WIth Yu Jingjian and the others holding the line, they suppressed the half-True Saints on the other side in an instant.

Even though the Beast Tamer Holy Gate had sent over a hundred half-True Saints to escort Yu Fujiang, more than half of them were killed when Huang Xiaolong had fought with Lu Ding previously. A mere sixty half-True Saints from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate were left.

With their small numbers, they were naturally unable to challenge the members of the Four Seas Holy Gate. Yu Jingjian and the other doyens completely suppressed them.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage soon. As the Departing Sword Sage fought the mid-First Heaven True Saint on the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s side, he was holding his own. However, Chen Zhi was getting battered as he challenged the peak early-First Heaven True Saint on the other side.

Seeing as his follower was getting beaten up, Huang Xiaolong released his holy soul and a thousand arms appeared behind it.

Thousand Arms Holy Devil!

In an instant, the peak early-First Heaven True Saint from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate was sent flying. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong reached out with one of the many arms to grab Yu Fujiang.

Feeling the threat to his life, Yu Fujiang burst forth with all his strength. A terrifying wave of energy that didn’t come from his body emerged.

With the sudden change, Huang Xiaolong lost his grip on Yu Fujiang.

“Huh?” Huang Xiaolong stared at him in shock.

When he was wondering how Yu Fujiang had managed to escape, the other party had already disappeared.

“Brat, do you really think that someone of your caliber will be able to take me down? What a joke! You should wash your neck and prepare for your entire clan for extermination for trying to kill me! Even Lin Xiaoying of the Clear Snow Palace wouldn’t be able to help you!” Yu Fujiang screamed from an unknown location in the void.

It was evident that he had managed to escape with some sort of formation talisman.

As the leader of the Holy Princes of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, he should have more than a single life-saving talisman on him. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. However, he didn’t bother searching for Yu Fujiang immediately. He had long since expected for something like this to happen, and he had implanted a soul imprint in Yu Fujiang’s body the moment he had grabbed at him previously. There was no way Yu Fujiang would be able to escape!

Turning to look at the battle between the Departing Sword Sage and the True Saint from the other side, Huang Xiaolong released his holy soul once again. A second holy soul appeared, and the Golden Buddha Holy Soul shot towards the enemy.

When the elders and disciples of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate felt the sudden increase in strength, they turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a terrified gaze.

“Two... Two holy souls!”

The blood drained from their faces in an instant.

As soon as the words left their lips, Huang Xiaolong started his second wave of attacks. A fist and a palm shot towards the True Saint from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate.

Thousand Arms Holy Devil!

Four Seas Heavy Palm!

Essence energy filled the skies around the Four Seas Holy Gate as holy light emerged the shine upon the lands. The elders of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate stood no chance as they were swallowed whole by the terrifying waves of energy. No matter how they tried to protect themselves, they were thrown around like a leaf in the wind.

Sending them all flying, Huang Xiaolong disappeared from his spot and started to hunt Yu Fujiang down.

“Take them all down and wait for me to return!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice passed through the void and entered the minds of the members of the Four Seas Holy Gate.

“Yes, Young Master!”

“Yes, Patriarch!”

By the time they replied, Yu Fujiang had already utilized the energy contained in his talisman to tear his way out of the Four Seas Grand Formation. As soon as he left the light barrier, he started to run like a beaten dog.

No one knew how far he ran, and he finally arrived in a desolate region devoid of human life. His breathing was haggard, and his body was stained red from his blood. He cut an extremely sorry figure as the deformity to his face hadn’t been fixed.

As soon as he arrived on the surface and noticed his pitiful appearance, killing intent welled up in his heart. It was soon followed by endless humiliation when he thought about how Huang Xiaolong had smashed him into the ground with a single palm.

“F*ck! F*ck this!” Yu Fujiang roared. “How the f*ck can a First Tribulation half-True Saint possess a holy soul?! Who is this b*stard?! Whatever. Regardless of who you are, I’ll contact the experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate to hunt you down! I’ll crush you beneath my feet the next time we meet!”
