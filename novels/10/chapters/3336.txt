Chapter 3337: Deal With Them As I Wish

The pilot remained completely impassive, and he continued, “Young Lady Pan, everything you did was recorded by the cameras up there. We know that you started the problem. You got your subordinates to block off Lord Huang Jiyuan’s path! You violated the regulations of our airline.”

Pan Yingying glared at the pilot and snapped, “Are you saying that I should be the one apologizing to them now?!”

“That is correct.” The pilot nodded.

Pan Yingying was so angry she decided to call Tan Zong immediately. However, she couldn’t get through no matter how many times she tried.

After trying several times and failing, Pan Yingying could only glare at Huang Xiaolong and the others before leaving behind her final threats. “All of you will definitely regret this!”

Soon after, she found a seat in the economy class.

When she left, Huang Jiyuan received a video call from Tan Bi.

The first thing Tan Bi said as soon as the call connected was, “Lord Huang Jiyuan, I know everything that happened on board the plane.”

The pilot had seen Tan Bi once during one of the banquets hosted by the Tan Family, and he managed to recognize the man. When he heard how Tan Bi addressed Huang Jiyuan, his eyes widened in surprise.

“Tan Bi, you are Tan Wei’s grandfather. There is no need for formalities.” Huang Jiyuan chuckled helplessly.

“Yeah, Tan Bi, he’s right!” Wang Meilan nodded at the side.

“No, no, no, I cannot do that! I am His Highness’ slave! I cannot disregard the rules!” Tan Bi hastily shook his head. 

His Highness’ slave?! The pilot felt his jaws dropping in fright.

Didn’t Tan Hong call Huang Xiaolong ‘His Highness’ just a moment ago?!

Could it be…

Turning his head slightly to look at Huang Xiaolong, the pilot felt his body trembling in fear.

“Get Pan Yingying and all her bodyguards off the plane,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “From now on, she’s barred from taking any flights from your Four Seas Company.” 

“Yes, Your Highness, I will pass the order down immediately!” Tan Bi seemed to have received an imperial pardon when he heard the order.

“Alright. Go ahead and do it. The plane should be leaving in a few minutes. We shouldn’t waste everyone’s time.”

Tan Bi quickly made a bow before disconnecting the video.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The pilot stared at the scene in shock as he couldn’t believe what he had just witnessed.

As Huang Jiyuan and the others were the only ones in the first-class section of the plane, the pilot was the only one who saw what had happened. Pan Yingying and her bodyguards had no idea what had happened.

Not too long after the call was disconnected, the pilot received an order from his higher-ups that he had to chase Pan Yingying off the plane. Suppressing the shock in his heart, he quickly spoke of their decision.

“What?! What did you just say?!” When Pan Yingying heard that they were chasing her off the plane, she stared at the pilot in shock. “This is not possible!” 

She didn’t believe that they would kick her off the plane.

“Also, you have been blacklisted by our Four Seas Company. You will no longer be able to enjoy our services.”

“Nonsense! This is not happening!” Pan Yingying screamed in anger.

“Please chase them off the plane,” The pilot spoke to the enforcers.

He didn’t even tell them to escort her off the plane, and instead, he got them to kick her out!

When they went over to grab Pan Yingying and her bodyguards, she made a final ditch attempt as her shrill voice rang through the plane. “What are you doing?! I’ll sue your company! How dare you chase me off the plane!”

After going back and forth, all of them were thrown off the plane.

When they were screaming in anger at the gate, the plane took off.

Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, Pan Yingying returned to the departure hall after several minutes.

With an ugly expression, she got one of her bodyguards to make another booking. However, he returned to bring her the bad news. She was barred from flying with the Four Seas Company and the next flight to the Japanese Alliance also belonged to the Four Seas Company.

Stamping about in anger, Pan Yingying tried to call Tan Zong once again. After more than twenty tries, she managed to connect a video call.

“Grand Elder Tan Zong, it’s me, Pan Yingying!” She seemed to have found her saving grace when the call connected.

“I know everything that happened.” Sweeping his gaze around him, he seemed to be afraid that there were other people who would overhear his conversation with her. “Don’t contact me anymore, please.”

“Grand Elder Tan Zong, they are just elders of the Huang Family, you…” 

Before Pan Yingying could complete her sentence, Tan Zong’s expression changed to one of fear, and he cut her off immediately. “Shut up!”

Staring at him in stunned silence, Pan Yingying didn’t know what she said wrong.

“If you wish to die, please don’t drag me into this. The Tan Family has nothing to do with this!” Tan Zong sighed. “I’ll let you in on something. The person who passed down the order was the old ancestor of my Tan Family.” After speaking, he disconnected the call.

Pan Yingying stared at the blank screen in shock. She didn’t understand why the old ancestor of the Tan Family would be the one to pass down the order!

“Boss, why don’t we take another airline…” one of the bodyguards whimpered.

“Yeah… After all, the Four Seas Company isn’t the only company with planes in the Huaxia Alliance.”

With her expression sinking, Pan Yingying sighed, “Go take a look at the other flights. Get me the one that leaves soon.”

“I found it. It’s from the Dragon Wind Company, and it leaves at five in the afternoon. However, we will need to go to the Laixin Airport.” 

Wouldn’t that mean that they would have to hurry over to the other airport?! Pan Yingying’s expression fell even further.

The hatred she had for Huang Xiaolong became even stronger. “When I arrive in the Japanese Alliance, you’ll regret everything you have done!” She was heading over because of the Murasakigawa’s request, and she was there to film a show.

As one of the disciples of the Murasakigawa Clan, Murasakigawa Tatsuya, seemed to be interested in her, she planned to use his influence to take care of Huang Xiaolong and the others.

According to her, the Huang Family might be a big shot in the Huaxia Alliance, but they would be powerless in the Japanese Alliance! When they arrived, she could do as she pleased!

“We’ll head over to the Laixin Airport now.”

When Pan Yingying boarded the plane towards Tokyo in the afternoon, Huang Xiaolong and the others had already arrived.

When they did, Huang Xiaolong saw several dozen limousines parked beside the plane. Every single one of them was part of a limited edition series. The old ancestor and patriarch of the Murasakigawa, Mitsui, and Iga Clans stood respectfully beside their cars as they waited for Huang Xiaolong’s arrival.
