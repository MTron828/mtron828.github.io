Wangu Yanhui was a little surprised discovering that the black-haired young man beside You Wuye was just a late-Second Order Highgod Realm. He had assumed that, as someone who was eligible to act together with You Wuye, he would be stronger than a mere late-Second Order Highgod Realm.

“Wuye Bro, how do I address your friend?” Wangu Yanhui asked You Wuye, pointing a finger at Huang Xiaolong.

You Wuye hesitated, his eyes secretly inquiring Huang Xiaolong’s opinion.

Noticing this, Wangu Yanhui was stunned. Thus greatly strayed from his assumption; between the two of them, You Wuye was not the decision maker? Judging from You Wuye’s actions, it seemed like the decision maker was actually the black-haired young man?

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to say something, a mocking voice rang in the hall, “Wangu Yanhui, since when did you start paying attention to a measly Second Order Highgod Realm punk?”

This newly arrived young man exuded a faint but sharp sword qi from his body, combined with an invisible pressure thick with an aura of blood and slaughter. The moment this young man appeared, his presence filled the hall with a whelming slaughter qi. The average Third Order Highgod Realm disciples who didn’t possess a strong will would have their consciousness destroyed by the intense slaughter qi even before the young man came close.

“Zhou Yao.” When You Wuye saw this young man, his face tightened with trepidation.

This newly arrived young man was none other than the disciples ranked third, the Zhou Family’s Zhou Yao.

Although Zhou Yao was ranked third, below Wangu Yanhui, You Wuye was warier facing this ranked third young man. That was because Zhou Yao’s reputation for indiscriminate slaughter had reached quite a number of galaxies, he was a horrifying god of slaughter!

Zhao Yao had never been pedantic about the identity of the person he killed. As long as he disliked that person, they would become a sacrifice for his sword.

“Hehe, it’s so lively here. Wangu Yanhui, Zhou Yao, You Wuye, it looks like I’m a little late.” Barely a moment after Zhou Yao arrived at the hall, another young man flew in from a different entrance.

This hall had entrances in all eight directions.

“Mu Qi,” You Wuye half-exclaimed in shock.

Mu Qi, ranked fourth, hailing from the Eternal Galaxy’s Mu Clan.

Huang Xiaolong watched with interest. Running into Wangu Yanhui could be called a coincidence, but was Zhou Yao and Mu Qi’s presence here also a coincidence?

Naturally, there could only be so many coincidences in the world.

If these people gathered here in this place, their purpose must be something inside the hall. Could the central formation be right here in this palace hall? However, how did these people determine that the central formation was in this place?

While Huang Xiaolong was contemplating this matter, Zhou Yao glanced around, snorting coldly, “Looks like the three of you also obtained the key to activate the central formation.”

Keys to activate the central formation! Huang Xiaolong immediately realized the reason.

It was now clear that Zhou Yao and the others were here because they found some kind of key that led them to this hall, and this place was precisely the location of the central formation. From Zhou Yao’s simple sentence, Huang Xiaolong immediately caught onto a fact: there was more than one key!

“There’s a total of five keys. Punk, did you get one of them?” Zhou Yao looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong entered the palace hall together with You Wuye, so Zhou Yao naturally assumed that he and You Wuye had found one of the five keys each and proceeded here together.

“But, a mere late-Second Order Highgod Realm such as yourself isn’t qualified to participate in the activation of the Lightning God cultivation dwelling’s central formation, and even less qualified to possess anything left behind by the Lightning God. I advise you to obediently hand over the key.” Zhou Yao added, “I’ll give You Wuye’s face and spare your life as long as you hand over the key.”

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong let out a laugh and was still laughing as he looked at Zhou Yao, “To tell you the truth, we don’t have any key, we entered this palace by coincidence. But, if you hand over your key to me, I’ll give face to the Zhou Clan and spare your life.”

The instant Huang Xiaolong said those words, everyone present was stunned.

Wangu Yanhui and Mu Qi shook their heads, the look in their eyes clearly pitied Huang Xiaolong. In their opinion, he was already a dead man.

A mere late-Second Order Highgod Realm punk actually dared to threaten Zhou Yao? Did he think having You Wuye on his side could protect him from everything?

Zhou Yao was stunned, but the frigid glint in his eyes and the killing intent in his voice grew even thicker, “Punk, you think I won’t dare to kill you because You Wuye is here? Today, I don’t give a damn who you are, no one can save you!” At the end of his words, the invisible sword qi from his body soared, and his slaughter qi became several times stronger.

Resounding blasts rang in the hall as streams of sword qi formed whirlwinds.

If just the slaughter qi rushing out from Zhou Yao’s body could affect the surrounding space to such a degree, one could imagine the extent of this Zhou Yao’s strength. Who knew how many cultivators had died in his hands for him to have such overwhelming slaughter qi.

Zhou Yao strode toward Huang Xiaolong in deliberately slow steps, directing a snort at You Wuye, “You Wuye, I must kill this punk today. If you insist on interfering, don’t blame me for dealing with you as well.”

Although both Zhou Yao and You Wuye’s cultivation was at Fourth Order Highgod Realm, Zhou Yao’s true strength was marginally stronger than You Wuye. This was evident from the sequence on the ranking list.

You Wuye’s expression turned slightly ugly at Zhou Yao’s words. Even though he was wary of Zhou Yao’s strength, he wasn’t really afraid of him.

There wasn’t a large gap in their strengths, and now Zhou Yao actually insulted him in front of these people, You Wuye felt his anger rising.

Just as You Wuye was about to step forward to confront Zhou Yao, Huang Xiaolong suddenly lifted his arm, stopping You Wuye and saying, “Wait at the side.”

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s monotone voice, it exuded unchallengeable authority; and to Wangu Yanhui and Mu Qi’s amazement, You Wuye actually acknowledged respectfully and retreated to the side.

Zhou Yao’s eyes narrowed watching this, his voice growing even colder, “Punk, I don’t give a damn who you are, I must kill you today as an offering to my dao of slaughter.” A bright light enshrouded Zhou Yao and he completely disappeared in the next second.

Suddenly, a sword light radiant to the extreme sliced through space and disappeared. It was as if Zhou Yao had completely merged into the sword light.

This was the true meaning of becoming one with the sword!

Zhou Yao’s sword qi was different from You Wuye’s; You Wuye’s sword was strange, hence unpredictable and hard to defend against. Whereas Zhou Yao’s sword qi was overbearing, direct, only focusing on killing, destruction, and slaughter.

Even Wangu Yanhui couldn’t help but admire this sword attack.

Without putting up any defense, even an early Fourth Order Highgod Realm master would suffer grave injuries trying to withstand this attack.

When Wangu Yanhui and Mu Qi had already accepted Huang Xiaolong’s impending death as a fact, Zhou Yao’s brilliant sword light halted in midair all of a sudden. Their faces showed disbelief when they saw the reason.

The tip of Zhou Yao’s longsword was pinned in place between Huang Xiaolong’s two fingers.

Zhou Yao felt the greatest shock amongst all present.

The punk blocked it? No, he actually caught his attack! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong ignored these shocked reactions. Exerting force in his two fingers, Zhou Yao’s longsword, which was named Killing Sword and was crafted from unknown Divine World iron and metal, was snapped into a dozen pieces.

The sword tip of the broken sword between Huang Xiaolong’s fingers penetrated Zhou Yao’s chest with a turn of Huang Xiaolong’s wrist, flying out from his back.

That sword tip pierced through the wall, leaving a gaping hole.
