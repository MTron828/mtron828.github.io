Chapter 102: The Yuwai Kingdom

Finally, he had broken through to the Ninth Order!

The sky was getting clearer and Xiaolong stopped practicing with delight in his heart.

A Ninth Order in any families or big counties within the Luo Tong Kingdom’s territory was a force in one’s own right. In the previous Huang Clan Manor, other than Huang Qide, only the Chief Steward Chen Ying was a Ninth Order expert.

Those so-called Huang Clan Manor Elders were just at the Eighth Order or worse, the peak late-Seventh Order.

Huang Xiaolong came out from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space.

Just as he came out from there and out of the room, he ran into Fei Hou; seeing him, Fei Hou exclaimed in shock, “Sovereign, could it be, you...?!” He already was a Xiantian expert and Huang Xiaolong did not intentionally hide his breath fluctuations, thus Fei Hou noticed the difference at first sight.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and laughed: “I was lucky and I was able to break through last night.”

Fei Hou felt a dizzy spell.

Was lucky?

To Fei Hou, it felt as if every other day he would come across Sovereign’s lucky breakthroughs!

But wasn’t this level of lucky coincidences a little too abnormal?

After a while, Fei Hou repressed the shock in his heart, but he still hesitated for a moment.

“Sovereign, this Subordinate would like to make a trip home.” Fei Hou honestly brought up his request.

“Go home?” Huang Xiaolong choked; and dazed for a moment, he still yet had not connected the dots. Fei Hou had followed Huang Xiaolong for seven years, but he had never mentioned anything about his family. That was why when Fei Hou mentioned the matter, he was a little slow on the uptake.

“Yes, Sovereign. Just now, a letter came from my son: he said next month my eldest grandson is getting married and I have not been back for seven years. Therefore, this Subordinate wants to go home and take a look.” Fei Hou explained, feeling slightly embarrassed.

When Huang Xiaolong recovered, he smiled and said, “Fei Hou, this is a big happy event ah, no need to feel embarrassed.” he asked: “Then, where is your home?”

“This Subordinate is a Marquis of the Yuwai Kingdom.” Fei Hou answered.

TheYuwai Kingdom? Huang Xiaolong was surprised by this news.

It had occurred to Huang Xiaolong that Fei Hou might not be a Luo Tong Kingdom local, but he did not expect Fei Hou to be a Marquis from the Yuwai Kingdom.

The Luo Tong Kingdom was located at the south side of the Silvermoon Forest whereas the Yuwai Kingdom sits on the north side. This knowledge was gained from the hours he spent in the Academy’s library; the Yuwai Kingdom was one of the strongest kingdoms amongst the thousand over kingdoms under Duanren Empire and was much stronger than the Luo Tong Kingdom many times over.

“When do you plan to leave?’ Huang Xiaolong asked.

“This Subordinate plans to leave in another two days.” Fei Hou answered.

“How about this, I will make this trip with you to the Yuwai Kingdom.” Huang Xiaolong ‘suggested’ in a low voice.

Fei Hou was startled: “Sovereign, you want to come with this Subordinate to Yuwai Kingdom, then....?”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand unconcernedly, and laughed, “Since it is your eldest grandson’s wedding, no matter what, I must also prepare a wedding gift, moreover, I also want to have a look around a new place. Am I not welcome?”

Since he came to this world, other than the Luo Tong Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong’s time was spent in the Silvermoon Forest training and because of that, he wanted to take this opportunity to go outside.

Fei Hou quickly smiled, “Sovereign is going with this Subordinate, of course, I am very happy.”

Huang Xiaolong said, “Then you go and make the proper arrangements; we’ll depart the day after tomorrow.”

“Yes, thank you, Sovereign!” Fei Hou replied respectfully, turned around and left to make arrangements.

After Fei Hou left, Huang Xiaolong went to the main hall. Both of his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan were there, and Huang Xiaolong told them he would be leaving to the Yuwai Kingdom with Fei Hou in two days’ time.

When they heard that, although a little unexpected, neither one objected.

These years, Huang Xiaolong had spent most of his time outside, in the Silvermoon Forest.

“Are you coming back at the end of the year?” Huang Peng inquired.

“Not sure– if nothing happens, we should be back in six months.” Huang Xiaolong gave an estimate.

Then, Xiaolong gave his parents roughly ten Fire Dragon Pearls and explained a little about the management of the Nine Tripod Commerce. Fei Hou was the one in charge of the Nine Tripod Commerce and now that Fei Hou was going away, these things needed to be handled by his parents. Luckily, his parents were involved in some aspects, and with Marshal Haotian behind them, there shouldn’t be any problems.

Two days passed.

Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou left the Luo Tong Kingdom and they were sent off by a crowd of family.

Just like every time before when he left the Royal City, Xiaolong would ask Marshal Haotian to look over his parents and little siblings’ safety.

After leaving the Luo Tong Kingdom Royal City, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou came before the Silvermoon Forest. Once they cut through the forest, they would arrive at the border of Yuwai Kingdom. This was the fastest route; while hurrying their way, the two of them could kill some demonic beasts and train.

Two months passed.

In a silent night.

Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou sat near the bonfire, lighting up a small area of the dark forest.

Two months passed and the two of them had arrived at the northernmost part of the Silvermoon Forest; tomorrow, they could probably make it across the border into the Yuwai Kingdom.

Sitting close to the bonfire, even as a Xiantian, Fei Hou could not help but feel excited thinking that he was about to return to the Fei Manor.

It was seven years of separation, how much had the Fei Manor changed in his absence.....

Looking at Fei Hou’s face, Xiaolong could empathize with his mood.

The first year he left the Huang Clan Manor and returned at the end of the year, he felt the same on the journey from the Luo Tong Royal City to Huang Clan Manor.

“Another ten days, we will reach Yuwai Royal City, right?” Huang Xiaolong spoke.

“That’s right, Sovereign,” Fei Hou added, “That year when I left, Fei Ming that little brat was only seventeen. Seven years passed in the blink of an eye and that brat is already getting married!”

Fei Ming was Fei Hou’s eldest grandson.

In his son, Fei Rong’s letter, this eldest grandson of his had already broken through to the Seventh Order, and this made Fei Hou feel comforted; when he left, Fei Ming was just a late-Fifth Order.

Night slowly faded away.

And daybreak inched up from the horizon; Xiaolong and Fei Hou continued onwards and one day later, they came out from the Silvermoon Forest, reaching the Yuwai Kingdom’s border.

Still, with Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou’s speed, they needed at least eight to nine days to reach the Yuwai Royal City.

As they entered the Yuwai Kingdom’s land, both of them would only delay little time at cities to rest for the night.

Six days passed.

As the two got closer to the destination, three more cities popped up, and soon, they would reach the Yuwai Royal City.

While Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou were hurrying, two carriages came from behind and when they neared them, a surprised exclamation sounded, “Is it Senior Fei Hou?”

This made Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou turn around to look and they saw one of the horse carriages stop. From inside the carriage, a twenty-something pretty young woman came out.

Coming before Fei Hou, the pretty young woman had surprise shining in her eyes. Sounding a little awed, she asked again: “Is it Senior Fei Hou?”

Fei Hou scrutinized the young woman in front of him with a puzzled expression, nodded, and said, “I am Fei Hou, and you are?” He really can’t recall who this young woman in front him was.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
