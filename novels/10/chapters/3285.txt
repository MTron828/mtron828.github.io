Chapter 3286: Lin Xiaotian

When the disciples of the Lin Family saw the luxurious flying ship Huang Xiaolong arrived in, they didn’t dare to tardy as they invited them in. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You are…” One of the disciples asked.

Tossing his identity plaque over to the other party, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother introducing himself. When the disciples looked at it closely, he nearly fainted from fright.

“Senior you are…” Using both hands, he handed the plaque back to Huang Xiaolong.

“You can call me Huang Xiaolong. I’m here with my parents to visit our relative.”

Huang Xiaolong? The disciple was stunned for a second. It was clear he hadn’t heard of Huang Xiaolong in his life. Huang Xiaolong might be famous in the Donglin Province, but the members of the Lin Family had no idea who he was.

However, the disciple didn’t dare to show any disrespect after seeing the plaque. Inviting Huang Xiaolong towards the main hall, he bowed, “Senior, please hold on a minute while we call our grand elder, Lin Qihao, here.”

There were ten grand elders in the Lin Family, and Lin Qihao was the one responsible for greeting guests.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong brought the others into the main hall.

When the disciple reported the matter, Lin Qihao jumped in fright. “What?! Did you just say that he’s called Huang Xiaolong?!”

The disciple might not have heard of Huang Xiaolong, but as a grand elder, he learned of Huang Xiaolong’s name several days ago. He knew that Huang Xiaolong was a newly appointed grand elder of the Huang Family, and he had a lot of respect from the new Huang Family Patriarch, Huang Shengan!

“Yes grand elder…” The disciple was shocked to see such a huge reaction from the grand elder.

Lin Qihao hastily got to his feet and rushed out of the room instantly. He no longer bothered with his wives and concubines who were having a meal with him, and he charged towards the main hall. “Hurry up and bring me to him!”

Something clicked in his mind all of a sudden and he turned around to bark out several orders. “Notify the other grand elders in the manor right now! We have to welcome Huang Xiaolong properly!”

“Oh right, tell the patriarch too!”

The disciple of the Lin Family was stunned and so were his wives.

His main wife couldn’t help but ask, “Qihao, isn’t he just a grand elder of the Huang Family? It’s good enough for you to go alone, why do you need to notify the patriarch?”

“What the f*ck do you know?!” His yell startled everyone present. “The Huang Family isn’t what it used to be!”

His wives looked at each other in shock.

The Huang Family’s transformation didn’t make its way to the ears of his wives as they weren’t expert cultivators…

As soon as Lin Qihao left his courtyard, he didn’t bother gathering everyone as he charged towards the main hall. His expression was solemn, and the disciples who looked at him felt their hearts pounding in fear.

“Grand Elder Huang Xiaolong is an esteemed guest of our Lin Family. How dare you guys leave him in the outer section of the main hall?!” Lin Qihao snapped at the disciples of the Lin Family.

Opening his mouth, no words came out as the disicple had no idea what to say.

Ordinarily, the grand elders were all made to wait in the outer section of the main hall when they came. He was doing what they normally did and saw no reason for Lin Qihao’s anger.

After lecturing the disciples on their behavior, Lin Qihao suppressed the anxiety in his heart and muttered to himself, “I wonder why Grand Elder Huang Xiaolong came all the way over to our Lin Family…”

It was already 7pm by the time Huang Xiaolong arrived, and any one who came to pay a visit at that timing would be a cause for concern.

“Grand Elder Huang Xiaolong said that he came with his parents to visit his relative.” The disciple reported.

“Visit his relative?!” Lin Qihao was even more confused. Was there someone of the Huang Family in the Lin Family?!

After thinking for some time, he couldn’t recall anyone in the Lin Family whose surname started with Huang.

Whatever the case, he arrived at the grand entrance of the main hall and he sucked in a deep breath. Regaining his composure, he stepped into the main hall with a dignified expression on his face.

Lin Qihao’s behavior was understandable when one looked at the difference in power between the two families. Now that Huang Shengan entered the Enlightement Realm while accepting the Tan Family and Sun Family under their banner, they had a total of three Enlightement Realm experts under their command!

With the Nascent Soul Realm experts of the other families, the Huang Family’s strength increased by more than one fold!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong was the grand elder who gained the trust of Huang Shengan, and he could be said to be someone who had supreme power in the Huang Family!

As soon as Lin Qihao entered the hall, his gaze locked onto Huang Xiaolong. He was shocked. He heard that Huang Xiaolong was a youth who looked to be in his mid-twenties, but he refused to believe that it could be possible. Now, he realized that Huang Xiaolong looked even younger than the rumors! Moreover, he was just too damn handsome!

“I am Lin Qihao, and I greet Grand Elder Huang Xiaolong.” Lin Qihao walked towards Huang Xiaolong and smiled, “I’ve long since heard of brother’s reputation!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly in response.

Ignoring Huang Xiaolong’s lack of reaction, Lin Qihao continued on to greet those around him.

Very quickly, the other grand elders of the Lin Family arrived, and the entire place bustled with activity. Greetings were thrown all around, and when it finally settled, the patriarch of the Lin Family, Lin Guodong, started the ball rolling. “I’ve heard that Grand Elder Huang Xiaolong is here to visit your relative. Is that true?”

“That’s right. I heard that my sister, Huang Wen, is married into your Huang Family. I’m here with my parents to visit her.”

According to Huang Xiaolong’s plans, they would head over to visit Huang Wen directly. However, his parents insisted on paying their respects to the upper echelons of the Lin Family in order for them to take note of her.

“Huang Wen?” Everyone from the Lin Family looked at each other in surprise.

“Her husband is Lin Xiaotian.” Huang Jiyuan explained.

“Lin Xiaotian?!” Lin Guodong and the others were shocked. Lin Xiaotian was an elder of the Lin Family, and all of them knew who he was. However, they didn’t expect that Huang Xiaolong’s sister would be married to an elder in the Lin Family! After all, a mere elder of the Lin Family wasn’t important enough to catch anyone’s eyes!

“Oh!” Lin Guodong forced a laugher while he racked his brains to recall who Huang Jiyuan had mentioned. “I’ll get someone to summon them over right now!”

Very quickly, the direct disciple of the Lin Family Patriarch received the order and he rushed over to Lin Xiaotian’s residence.

Even though Lin Xiaotian was an elder of the Lin Family, his status wasn’t too high. As such, his manor wasn’t located in the headquarters of the Lin Family, and they had to run over to his place to get him. Of course, he didn’t live too far away from the actual headquarters of the Lin Family.

“Brother Lin Xiaotian, congratulations, congratulations!” When Lin Chengtian, the direct disciple of the Lin Family Patriarch, arrived, a look of enthusiasm could be seen on his face.

He felt that Lin Xiaotian was too damn lucky. He was actually able to form a relationship with Grand Elder Huang Xiaolong, and a trace of jealousy formed in his heart.
