Chapter 2064: Opening the Ancient Heavenly Court’s Treasury

Unifying the Fiend World proceeded with almost zero resistance. It went smoothly, just like it did with the Fire World. After all, Huang Xiaolong had successfully passed the Fiend Shrine’s test and obtained the Fiend World’s inheritance, as well as the symbolic fiend cloak. On top of Huang Xiaolong’s resounding reputation in recent years, no experts in the Fiend World had thought of defying.

Roughly a month later, Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness made their way back to the Divine World.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong learned about the Divine World’s latest situation from the King of Darkness. In the past year, the little cow had finished organizing the Demon World’s forces and had led a great army to assist the Grandmist Emperor Palace together with the Six-Winged Green Mosquito Race and Dragon Bear Race.

With the reinforcement from the little cow and the others, the Divine World’s several old monsters’ alliance was crushed to the ground. Just a few months back, Jiang Hong had successfully unified the Divine World and ascended to the Heavenly Emperor’s throne. Jiang Hong had taken complete control over the Heavenly Court as its new master, becoming the new Heavenly Emperor.

If Huang Xiaolong could rush over, he could catch up with Jiang Hong’s inauguration ceremony.

“Xiaolong, three of the five Greater Worlds—Hell, Demon World, and Divine World have fallen into our hands. The Devil World is bound to join our ranks in a matter of time. After you gather all Six Great Devil Steles, you will be able to ascend to the supreme Archdevil Lord’s position and rule the Devil World. The last one would be the Buddha World!”

As they hurried back to the Divine World, the King of Darkness said, “In my opinion, after your Senior Brother has ascended to the Heavenly Emperor’s throne, we should immediately launch a war against the Buddha World and collect it into our ranks!” There was a glint of bloodthirst in the King of Darkness’s eyes as he spoke. He even ran his tongue over his lips as if he could taste blood on them as he added, “Those old Buddhists’ blood is delicious. It has been a long time since I have tasted any.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head but did not say anything.

In the last moments of the Radiance World War, Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, and the others had delayed the Ancient Heavenly Court by awakening the Xumi Old Man’s soul imprint in the Godly Mt. Xumi. They had seized this small window of time and escaped in the Godly Mt. Xumi. After seeing the Xumi Old Man’s phantom, Huang Xiaolong had already determined that Xumi Old Man was the same old man he had met in the lower realm when he had found the miniature Godly Mt. Xumi.

Thinking of the Xumi Old Man, Huang Xiaolong inevitably remembered the vow he had made in front of the old man.

“Is something the matter?” The King of Darkness asked when he noticed that something was off with Huang Xiaolong’s expression.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and denied, “It’s nothing.”

On second thought, Huang Xiaolong told the King of Darkness about the promise he had made to the Xumi Old Man when he was still in the lower realm.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s recount, the King of Darkness was astounded. He had never imagined that Huang Xiaolong could meet someone like the Xumi Old Man in the lower realm.

He had even made a vow to the Xumi Old Man.

After listening to Huang Xiaolong’s recount, the King of Darkness was silent for a long while before he spoke, “You made a vow before the Xumi Old Man that you won’t attack the Buddha World unless the Buddha World attacks Hell first. Buddhist Shi Zhen joined hands with Shi Ming against you. Therefore, even if you attack the Buddha World now, it does not violate the vow you made that year.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, stating, “Although Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen joined hands with Shi Ming in the Radiance World War, he did not attack Hell. Therefore, my vow that year still stands. If I attack the Buddha World now, I will be violating my vow.”

“Not to mention, Xumi Old Man can be considered as having bestowed a great grace to me.” Huang Xiaolong sighed as he added, “We will talk about attacking the Buddha World later.”

Xumi Old Man had given him the miniature Godly Mt. Xumi, which was a great grace to Huang Xiaolong at that point in his life.

In the lower realm, the Godly Mt. Xumi was the number one amongst the wondrous treasures, and because he possessed the Godly Mt. Xumi’s support, his cultivation had improved at a shocking speed.

It was no exaggeration to say that the benefits and usefulness of the Godly Mt. Xumi to him, while in the lower realm, were equivalent to the grandmist treasure artifact Ancient Heavenly Court in the Divine World.

The King of Darkness said, “I had not expected the Xumi Old Man to have really entered reincarnation and cultivated again from zero. It seems like Xumi Old Man might really break through to high-level Sovereign Realm in this lifetime.”

“If Xumi Old Man really breaks through to high-level Sovereign Realm, which side would he side with?” The King of Darkness said with a worried expression.

It was a reasonable concern. After all, Shi Zhen was the Xumi Old Man’s personal disciple, whereas Huang Xiaolong was merely someone he had the fate of meeting once. By common judgement, Xumi Old Man would favor Shi Zhen more.

Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly, “We’ll see when the time comes.” Struggling with these thoughts at that time was futile.

However, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling the Xumi Old Man might stand on his stand. Although he and the Xumi Old Man had only met once, he was confident that Xumi Old Man would not blindly help Shi Zhen.

This was an inexplicable trust. It was similar to how the Xumi Old Man had trusted Huang Xiaolong and his vow, and given him the Godly Mt. Xumi. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Oh right, Xiaolong, you haven’t opened the Ancient Heavenly Court’s treasury, right?” The King of Darkness suddenly popped out a question.

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded. Only then did he remember that he had yet to take a look inside the Ancient Heavenly Court’s treasury.

Earlier, after refining the Ancient Heavenly Court within the Devil Abyss, he had received his master, King of Grandmist’s message that the Radiance World’s war had reached a crucial stage. He was just about to open the treasury then. But instead, Huang Xiaolong’s group had sprinted back to the Radiance World due to the urgent nature of the message. Later on, after unifying the Radiance World, he had visited Hell and destroyed the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe headquarters, the Massacring Gods Gate headquarters, and Fengdu City.

Then, Huang Xiaolong had traveled to the Ksana Divine Temple and Fiend Shrine, which had delayed Huang Xiaolong from looking at the Ancient Heavenly Court’s treasury.

“Come, let’s go into the Heaven Vault Palace!”

Without further delay, Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness headed out from the Complete Heaven Palace to the Heaven Vault Palace.

As the Heaven Vault Palace was merely a short distance from the Complete Heaven Palace, the two of them arrived a moment later.

Standing in front of the Heavenly Vault Palace’s door, they looked at the glowing doors intricately decorated with iridescent gems and pearls.

That’s right, iridescent gems and pearls.

The Heaven Vault Palace’s doors were laid with precisely ten thousand Iridescent Divine Pearls. Apart from ten thousand iridescent divine pearls, the door was also inlaid with many other precious gems and stones.

Naturally, these iridescent divine pearls were no ordinary iridescent divine pearls. Every single iridescent divine pearl was the beast core of top-grade bloodline divine beasts. Each of the other treasures on the door had its own origin and history.

“Good Heavens! Just this door alone is already a wealthy treasury!” The King of Darkness sighed in admiration.

A bright glow enshrouded Huang Xiaolong’s palms as he pressed them against the door. All ten thousand iridescent divine pearls and other precious treasures inlaid on it glowed brilliantly as the door creaked open.

Dazzling lights seeped out from the door’s gap. Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness narrowed their eyes from the blinding light. Moments later, the dazzling lights dimmed, allowing the two of them a good sight of the treasures placed inside, rendering them to gasp in astonishment.

“That’s the Ancestral Dragon Godly Armor!”

“Golden Spider Blade!”

......

The King of Darkness exclaimed the names of one treasure after another.

The Ancestral Dragon Godly Armor was a set of divine armor personally forged by the Dragon World’s Ancestor. It was hailed as the Dragon World’s most powerful defense divine artifact. It was also the Dragon World’s sole grandmist treasure artifact.

But as the Dragon World’s Ancestor went missing, the Ancestral Dragon Godly Armor was lost as well. Who would have thought it would actually appear inside the Heaven Vault Palace?

“Blossom of the Flame Dragon!”

“Immortal Metallic Star!”

“Sky Star Dao Fruit!”

The King of Darkness quivered with excitement when he saw certain treasures—all these were level one and level two origin treasures, ah!

Inside the Ancient Heavenly Court’s treasury were more than twenty level-one and level-two origin treasures!

Moreover, these origin treasures had clearly matured. Some had matured for several hundred years, and the most current ones were already matured for several million years!
