Even though Huang Xiaolong’s progress had slowed down compared to the beginning, his pace was still startling compared to Qin Huangzhong, Shi Yinyu, Song Litao, He Jingyi, and the others.

The day finally came to an end, and Huang Xiaolong had killed all ten thousand Blackstone Monsters on the fourth floor.

When the last of the Blackstone Monsters turned into energy and drilled into his body, Huang Xiaolong heaved loudly in relief, feeling more than a little drained.

It took him two full days to kill the ten thousand Blackstone Monsters on the fourth floor, while he had managed to clear the first three floors in half a day. In summary, it merely took him two and a half days to clear four floors!

Huang Xiaolong remembered that Tai Yue said Qin Fan had spent more than eight months to pass the first four floors!

In retrospect, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to enter the fifth floor. He had time to adjust his condition back to the peak and recover his consumed godforce before entering the fifth floor. At his peak condition, he would be able to slaughter all the hell beasts on the fifth floor more effectively.

Simultaneously, all the spectating experts outside were staring fixedly at the Holy Mountain’s fourth floor. All of them were discussing how fast could the mysterious genius clear the fourth floor’s obstacles.

“Castellan Qin Fan took more than eight months to pass the first floor to the fourth floor. This mysterious genius would probably take a month to clear the fourth floor!”

“One month? Not likely, is it? The fourth floor’s obstacles are not so easy to clear as the first three floors. Even though this person progressed quickly at the start, that doesn’t mean he could do the same on the fourth floor.”

“I feel it might take less than two months. Who knows, maybe this mysterious genius might clear the fourth floor in less than half a month.”

Various forces’ experts had differing opinions.

“Half a month? Mad Devil Ancestor, interested to make a bet? If this mysterious genius really can clear the fourth floors in half a month or less, I win, and you will give me five hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. However, if this mysterious genius takes over half a month to pass the fourth floor, I lose. I’ll give you five hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones, how about that?”

“This...”

“What? Are you afraid?”

“A bet it is, five hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones!”

Many other Ancestor generation experts were betting on how long it would take for Huang Xiaolong to clear the fourth floor. Some bet a dozen low-grade chaos spirit stones, while a few bigger bets reached several hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones, and some even bet on divine artifacts that they fancied.

“What do you guys think, how many days would this person take to clear the fourth floor?” Tai Yue suddenly looked sideways as he asked Fan Hui and the others.

Fan Hui pondered slightly before answering with uncertainty, “Maybe more than a month.”

“I, on the other hand, feel it’s around twenty days or so.” Jin Yuan chimed in.

“I think two months is the safest bet.” Wan Yutian stressed his opinion.

Precisely at this time, the Holy Mountain shone brightly, and dazzling rays soared skywards as the fifth floor lit up.

All discussions, talks of bets, other noises, and whatever actions the spectators were doing, came to an abrupt stop.

“Th-the fifth floor!”

“How many days?!”

“... It seems, just slightly over two days!”

Slightly over two days!

Everyone felt a cold breeze blowing past them, but it went straight to their souls.

The spectators outside shuddered in astonishment, their mouths agape as if trying to eat a big egg.

It isn’t one month, much less, two months!

Not even half a month! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

A little over two days!

“Hahaha, I won! I won! Mad Devil Ancestor, those five hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones, you have it on you, right? Take it out now!”

Suddenly, one of the Ancestors who had made a bet with the Lifeless Sect’s Mad Devil Ancestor cackled with a rush of joy, shattering the abrupt silence.

Other Ancestors who had also bet that Huang Xiaolong would be able to clear the fourth floor in less than half a month broke out in ecstatic laughter.

“Haha, Ancestor Luo Ding, you lost. Where’s the divine armor you forged with cold yin iron?”

“Scarlet Wind Ancestor, where’s your grandmist golden raccoon? Jolly refreshing, I feel so good! With that grandmist golden raccoon’s blood, I can refine the Enlightenment Divine Pill.”

As some rejoiced, some despaired.

The news of Huang Xiaolong clearing the fourth floor quickly reached the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

When the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming heard it, he dazed for a second and did not react for a long time.

“Old Ancestor.” The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang called out as his tribe’s Old Ancestor did not react for some time.

Only then did Old Ancestor Shi Ming return to reality, but the quivering excitement was evident in his voice, “Sli-Slightly over two days from the first floor to the fourth floor! This...! Pass my order, if that person is willing to be friends with my Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, a position of my tribe’s Lord Ancestor would be his. Also, he can choose any two items from my Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury. No, he can choose four items!”

Shi Wushuang couldn’t help feeling astounded hearing the Old Ancestor’s promise.

The position of a Lord Ancestor!

That was a position that stands above millions, only under one person, ah!

The authority of a Lord Ancestor within the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe was equal to him, the tribe’s Patriarch. It was only under the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor.

On top of that, he would be offered four items from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s treasury!

“Old Ancestor, those conditions, aren’t they too high?” Patriarch Shi Wushuang was reluctant to agree.

Old Ancestor Shi Ming let out hearty laughter, then asked in return, “High? Not high at all. If we can have this person’s assistance, do you think our tribe would need to worry about unifying Hell? Not only Hell, but even the Divine World, Devil World, Demon World, and the Buddha World would have to submit to our Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe! At that time, the whole universe will belong to our tribe. Do you still think the conditions are high?”

That’s right. If they could win the support of such a genius, their tribe could conquer the entire universe!

In comparison, what was the Lord Ancestor’s position, and four items from the treasury are worth?

“Old Ancestor is wise, I understand.” Patriarch Shi Wushuang complied smilingly.

The Ghost World’s Qin Fan, the Misty Palace, Massacring Gods Gate, Howling Moon Wolf Race, and various other forces were just as shocked when they received the news of Huang Xiaolong clearing the fourth floor. They also raised the conditions they offered to win over ‘the mysterious genius’—they needed to win him over to their side.

Back inside the Holy Mountain, Huang Xiaolong, who reached the fifth floor, collected the rewarded three holy fruits and put them into his Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle. Then, he flew towards the entryway leading to the sixth floor, but the fifth floor’s hell beasts soon blocked his path.

Looking at the fifth floor’s hell beasts, Huang Xiaolong subconsciously frowned. This time, he was facing ten thousand Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards!

Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm! The thing was these Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards had two godforce attributes—wind and thunder. Due to this, these Leopards had immense destructive power and shocking speed.

A Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard could easily kill a dozen late-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Blackstone Monsters on the fourth floor.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath, then another. His three supreme godheads spun to the limit, and wind vortex rose around him. In the eye of the wind-vortex was rumbling thunder with crackling lightning.

Since these Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards had the power of wind and thunder attributes, Huang Xiaolong planned to use supreme wind and thunder godforce to eliminate them.

Huang Xiaolong’s body spun as he approached the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards. The wind-vortex around him grew bigger.

As Huang Xiaolong spun faster, the wind-vortex sucked in a Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard.
