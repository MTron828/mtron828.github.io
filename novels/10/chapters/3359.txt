Chapter 3360: Presumptuous!

 

Chen Haoguang and the others finally relaxed when they saw how confident Tao Wei was. Indeed, that was the Immortal Reverence Empire they were talking about. If Huang Xiaolong wasn’t stupid, he would submit for sure!

In the Deserted Galaxy, who would dare to go against the Immortal Reverence Empire?

Anyone who dared to oppose them would find their clans exterminated! In fact, they might be captured and tortured for eternity! Their essence souls would be used to refine pills!

In fact, they might be turned into creatures similar to vengeful ghosts who roamed the world. They would never be reincarnated!

“After a few days, we’ll look for His Third Highness.” Tao Wei muttered. “All of you can present His Third Highness with the immortal cave. His Highness will definitely reward you.”

Chen Haoguang and the others looked at each other silently.

“We have to thank Brother Tao Wei for the help. After all, we’ll all be on the same side in the future.” Chen Haoguang and the others thanked him.

“Well said! In the future, all of us will be part of the same family!” The third prince told Tao Wei that he would be given the entire region once he subdued Chen Haoguang and the others. Now, all of them would be his subordinates! 

“Brother Tao Wei, I already got some people to prepare a banquet in my Divine Court Sect. Do you think…” Chen Haoguang turned his gaze to the man and asked.

“Alright. Since we’re pretty close to the Flowing Flame Star, let’s go take a look.” 

Chen Haoguang and the others bowed before gesturing for Tao Wei to proceed.

After they retrieved the treasure, the entire group proceeded to the Divine Court Sect.

As they returned, Huang Xiaolong and Liu Huang approached the space around the Flowing Flame Star. Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before deciding to head over.

In the past, he had told Chen Haoguang and the others to look for medicinal herbs. He wondered if they had managed to accomplish their task.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother manipulating the space around them as he flew towards the star casually. In a few minutes, he arrived in the Divine Court Sect.

“Call your old ancestor out here,” Huang Xiaolong ordered the disciples guarding the main hall.

Even though Huang Xiaolong took them in as his subordinates, none of the disciples knew of his identity. They were shocked to hear someone summoning their old ancestor, and they quickly made a report.

…

When Chen Haoguang and the others heard the report, they were shocked for a moment as they were in the middle of the banquet. 

“Is the person wearing some sort of weird dao robes? Is there also a strange mark on his forehead?” Chen Haoguang asked.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Yes, old ancestor…” the disciple replied.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Chen Haoguang and the others yelled in unison.

“Oh?” Tao Wei placed his glass down and chuckled, “Did he come? Great. This saves me a trip down to Earth.” 

“Brother Tao Wei, should we go out to look for him?” Chen Haoguang and the others asked nervously. They might have submitted to the third prince and possessed the protection of the Immortal Reverence Empire, but Huang Xiaolong’s strength still scared them.

“Why should we?” Tao Wei waved his hand nonchalantly. “Send a disciple out there to call him in to meet me. We’ll continue drinking!” 

They weren’t even sure if Huang Xiaolong was an expert at the Grand Completion Realm! 

“This…” Chen Haoguang couldn’t help but hesitate. However, he saw the look of annoyance forming on Tao Wei’s face, and he nodded reluctantly. He summoned a disciple and said, “Bring Huang Xiaolong over to meet Lord Tao Wei!” 

“Yes, ancestor!” The disciple felt a wave of euphoria washing over him when Chen Haoguang addressed him directly. He quickly left the hall to summon Huang Xiaolong.

He quickly arrived at the entrance.

When Huang Xiaolong noticed a lone disciple coming out of the main hall, he couldn’t help but frown. He released his dao souls to look at the situation, and he quickly discovered Tao Wei and the others.

He quickly pieced together everything that was happening. After all, he was a monster who had been alive for far longer than anyone in the hall.

A cold smile appeared on his lips.

“Your Highness, do you want me to bring Chen Haoguang out here?” Liu Huang muttered. As an existence at the peak of the Void Immortal Realm, Liu Huang’s divine sense was extremely powerful. It might not be comparable to Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls, but it was strong enough to discover what was going on in the hall.

“There is no need. We’ll allow them to be merry for a bit.” Huang Xiaolong shrugged.

A disciple in the Foundation Building Realm approached Huang Xiaolong, and he sneered, “Follow me into the hall. Lord Tao Wei wishes to see you. Do you know who Lord Tao Wei is? He’s a vassal of the third prince of the Immortal Reverence Empire! When you meet him later, you best behave yourself! Otherwise, no one will be able to save you if you anger him.”

A frosty light flashed through Liu Huang’s eyes when he heard the disciple’s dismissive tone. He casually pointed at the disciple and a trace of crimson light pierced through his chest.

The disciple’s body rotted in an instant, and he turned into a puddle of black blood.

Liu Huang’s devil qi was something that could kill experts at the Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm. That disciple was a mere Foundation Building Realm cultivator, and he wouldn’t be able to take on a millionth of Liu Huang’s power.

Seeing as the disciple was killed, those standing around charged at Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to take him down. However, all Liu Huang did was snort, and blood leaked from all their orifices. They fell to the ground in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong strolled towards the main hall casually. 

Along the way, Liu Huang released his aura to sweep the disciples of the Divine Court Sect away.

Very quickly, a report was made to Chen Haoguang.

All of them couldn’t help but think about Huang Xiaolong’s warning when he came over the first time. He had said that anyone who betrayed him would die without a complete corpse!

Tao Wei narrowed his eyes, and he growled, “Presumptuous!” 

The moment the word left his lips, a figure entered the main hall. A body flew in alongside the man, and the body was turned into a pile of black liquid.

The faces of Chen Haoguang and the others changed instantly.

Under their shocked gazes, Huang Xiaolong stepped into the main hall with a cute little black spirit on his shoulder.

“Looks like I’m interrupting your celebrations…” Huang Xiaolong sighed.
