Zhao Lei and Li Shan released their aura when they saw the aggression. However, even though their strength was no less than Chen Jianwei, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace had five people on their side. Hence, many of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples felt like f a large rock had crushed their hearts.

Suddenly, a vast and boundless aura appeared from behind Huang Xiaolong and dissipated the five emperor’s pressure.

Chen Jian and the rest were surprised as their gaze landed on the two odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong. One of them had casually released some energy to dissipate the pressure emitted by the five Emperors.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t let them reveal their actual strength. No matter how hard Chen Jianwei and the rest tried, they failed to probe the two odd beasts’ real strength.

Chen Jianwei and the others stood ten meters away from Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Lei, and Fang Xuanxuan.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Chen Jianwei withdrew his gaze from the four odd beasts and looked at Huang Xiaolong. A firee burned in his eyes, and he didn’t bother concealing his murderous intent.

“Chen Jianwei, this is the Terrace of Heaven. How dare you make a move?” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

If the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace were to make a move here, the Heavenly Court would deal with them severely.

The disciples from the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace became furious when they heard Huang Xiaolong addressing their Azure Dragon Emperor by his name.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you call me by my name!”

“Kneel now and beg our Emperor for mercy!”

Some of the disciples yelled in anger.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Emperor? In my eyes, he’s just a grasshopper.”

“What?! Huang Xiaolong, you are too arrogant!”

The surrounding disciples raged, and they screamed at the top of their lungs. Veins popped on their forehead, and if it was not for the Heavenly Court’s rule, they would have pounced on Huang Xiaolong.

Hearing that Huang Xiaolong had called Chen Jianwei a grasshopper, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s remaining four emperors’ faces turned unsightly. As the Azure Dragon Emperor, Chen Jianwei was ranked number two out of the nine dragons in the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace. The four of them were ranked third, fourth, sixth, and seven.

Didn’t that imply that they were worse than a grasshopper? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It’s best to think clearly before speaking. Don’t you know that what you said might implicate everyone around you?” The White Dragon Emperor, Chen Huoan, said coldly.

“Huang Xiaolong, was my disciple killed by your subordinate?” Chen Jianwei growled and stared at Huang Xiaolong like a poisonous snake.

Even though they were quite sure that the murderer was Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate, they still wanted Huang Xiaolong to admit it.

Subordinate? Huang Xiaolong was startled and smiled indifferently, “I guess so?”

It seemed as though they were unwilling to believe that he had done it himself.

Guess so? Chen Jianwei frowned and sneered, “If you kill, then be prepared to be killed. During the preliminary round, I hope you won’t meet the disciples from my Nine Dragons Emperor Palace. Otherwise, I will let you know why death is a luxury!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to mess around with him. “Then I will wait for you...”

Chen Jianwei’s eyes flickered, and he looked at Zhao Lei. “Zhao Lei, I advise you to hand over Huang Xiaolong to our Nine Dragons Emperor Palace! Otherwise, don’t blame us for being cruel to your disciples. If Fang Gan were still around, we would have probably thought twice before doing this. But now that Fang Gan is no longer around... Hehe, we can toy with you however we want!”

“Chen Jianwei, stop spewing shit from your mouth and polluting the air. You want me to hand over my disciple to you? Then why don’t you hand over the girls from your Nine Dragons Emperor Palace for me to handle? Let the male disciples from our Fortune Emperor Palace handle them carefully!”

Everyone from the Fortune Emperor Palace and Nine Dragons Emperor Palace felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

Spewing shit from his mouth?

Even Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao’s face turned red.

All the disciples from the Fortune Emperor Palace burst out in laughter.

Even Huang Xiaolong laughed out loud.

This was more like the master he knew in the past.

Chen Jianwei’s face turned extremely unsightly as his eyes burst into flames, and he gritted his teeth, “Perfect, Zhao Lei. Since this is the case, don’t blame me for not remembering our past relationship. You just wait and see!”

“Let’s go!”

In the end, Chen Jianwei didn’t dare to act and left with the people from the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace.

“Stupid fool.” Zhao Lei sneered loudly.

When Chen Jianwei heard this, he almost turned around and charged at Zhao Lei.

After they had left, Zhao Lei took out the jade plaque to open the restriction for their manor and entered with the rest of them.

However, there were only fifty-six rooms inside the manor, while there were thousands of participating disciples from the Fortune Emperor Palace. Hence, dozens of disciples had to be squeezed into a single room. Fortunately, the rooms were quite large and could accommodate many people.

After walking a few rounds around the manor, Huang Xiaolong, Peng Xiao, and Fang Xuanxuan returned to their rooms and started cultivating.

The Battle of the Heavenly Court was getting nearer and nearer, and Huang Xiaolong had to make fair use of this time to fully refine Sun Shihai’s Archdevil bloodline and merge it into his own.

After returning to his room, Huang Xiaolong took out a thousand Brilliant Sun Divine Pill and circulated his Grandmist Parasitic Medium. His three Archdevil bloodlines appeared and condensed into his archdevil avatar.

The night passed quietly.

When the sun rose, Bei Xiaomei came over and dragged Huang Xiaolong, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the rest of them for a walk. Huang Xiaolong had no choice but to accompany her.

After shopping for a day, the rich Huang Xiaolong was forced to throw out tens of millions of low-grade chaos spirit stones to foot the ladies’ bill.

He had bought divine armors, divine weapons, and accessories and jewelry that belonged to some female Emperor.

He naturally had no use for all those things and gave all of them to the girls as presents.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had spent millions of low-grade chaos spirit stones on presents for them, the three girls were surprised and felt a sweetness in their hearts. Bei Xiaomei was so happy that she gave Huang Xiaolong a peck on his cheek.

As the night gradually fell, Huang Xiaolong and the few of them walked back towards Manor 61. However, just as the manor was within sight, they saw a group of heavenly troops surrounding it.

Zhao Lei, Li Shan, and the disciples from the Fortune Emperor Palace were currently standing outside and confronting a group of generals donned in their battle armor.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

“Xiaolong.” Zhao Lei’s eyes sparkled as he looked at Huang Xiaolong from afar.

Zhao Lei, Li Shan, and the others walked over hurriedly to Huang Xiaolong.

“Master, what’s wrong?” Huang Xiaolong asked directly.

“These six generals want us to move out of the manor.” Zhao Lei answered.

“Move out? Why?” Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao said in surprise, and a hint of anger flashed through their eyes.

“They say that they have received an order to arrange Manor 61 for the Solitude Emperor Palace. As the people from the Solitude Emperor Palace would be arriving here soon, they want us to move out of the manor.” Zhao Lei explained angrily.

One of the generals wearing silver battle armor said coldly, “This is the order of Marshal Yu Shi. As Fang Gan has disappeared, the strength of your Emperor Fortune Palace has decreased greatly, and you are no longer fit to be ranked sixty-one. Get out of Manor 61 immediately.”

“If we leave, where are we going to stay?” Fang Xuanxuan yelled in rage.

“In the next few days, Marshal Yu Shi will arrange a new place for you.” The general replied expressionlessly.

“So, are you telling us that we will have to sleep on the streets for the next few days?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed with a trace of coldness, “Or are you implying that as long as Marshal Yu Shi doesn’t arrange a place for us to stay, we will have to continue sleeping on the streets?”
