Chapter 2033: Du Hai’s Condition

Du Chen sneered, “Thanks to Old Ancestor Azure Cow, I managed to improve my cultivation after the injury you inflicted on me.”

The little cow couldn’t help but size Du Chen up again. She nodded her head in ‘amazement,’ “Not bad... It looks like you managed to gain something after I shattered your eggs in the past. You managed to enter the Second Order Sovereign Realm in such a short amount of time...”

Shattered his eggs?!

Everyone couldn’t help but turn to stare at Du Chen when they heard what the little cow said. A complicated look appeared on their face, and even the experts from the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race revealed a weird look when they looked at their leader.

When she brought up his embarrassing past, flames of rage erupted from Du Chen’s eyes. He glared at the little cow with thoughts of beating her up. If not for the fact that he was unable to defeat her, he would have already shredded her into a million pieces.

“Hehe!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Cold laughter broke through the air and sent chills down everyone’s spine.

A figure tore through the void and appeared between the two parties. The newcomer was also a part of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race, and he was an old man. The six wings on his back were pitch-black in color, and the poison marks on his body were extremely dense. The wings on his back were way larger than the ones on Du Chen’s back.

When the little cow saw the old man, she narrowed her eyes and snapped, “Old fogey, you’re finally here. I thought that you died a long time ago...”

The newcomer was precisely the old ancestor of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race, Du Hai.

Du Hai looked at her and chuckled under his breath. “Old Ancestor Azure Cow, you became prettier after the countless years that passed since our last meeting. Are you here because you miss me? You should go back and think about my proposal. If you marry me, we can join hands to sweep through the Demon World!”

When Huang Xiaolong and the others heard what he said, they stared at him with their jaws agape.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but glance at the little cow. He could have never expected there to be such a juicy story between them.

It was too bad the little cow roared and sent a streak of purple lightning flying towards the old man before he could continue his nonsensical speech. The moment the lightning came out from her mouth, it appeared in the space above Du Hai’s head.

Jumping in fright, Du Hai’s body blurred as he dodged the lightning bolt.

As the purple lightning descended, the mountain peak below turned into a fine dust.

“Old cow, why can’t we speak like proper humans? I was just kidding. Why did you take it so seriously?” Du Hai chuckled and glanced at Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness. “They...”

Huang Xiaolong got on the little cow, and a look of amazement appeared on Du Hai’s face.

There was even less of a need to mention that Du Hai noticed the Divine Radiance Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. It’s the Radiance Ancestor’s Radiance Divine Scepter! Why does he have it?

He couldn’t be more familiar with the Radiance Divine Scepter.

As she stared at the confused look on Du Hai’s face, the little cow snapped, “He’s my master.”

Du Hai lost his balance and nearly crashed into the ground when he heard what she said. The experts from the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race, including Du Chen, who recognized the little cow, stared at her with a blank expression as they faltered in mid-air.

“Hey, old lady, are you messing with me?” Du Hai swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock, and his voice shook slightly. An incredulous look appeared on his face when he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

It was no wonder he was shocked by the sudden revelation. No one had ever heard of anyone becoming Old Ancestor Azure Cow’s master. Even Lord Wan Shi from the City of All-Heavens didn’t have the qualifications to be one.

How could an overlord who could dominate anything under the heavens submit to someone?!

It was a ridiculous thought!

The little cow rolled her eyes and ignored the shock Du Hai was feeling. She pointed at the King of Darkness and said, “Old fogey, you should recognize him.”

Du Hai finally snapped back to reality, and he turned to look at the King of Darkness. His pupils constricted as he greeted, “So it’s Brother Darkness... I’ve long since heard of you.” Even for someone like Du Hai, who had once swept through the lands unhindered, didn’t dare to look down on the King of Darkness.

If they had to take into account cultivation realms, the King of Darkness was leagues above him.

As for the King of Darkness’ reputation, it had long eclipsed his after he had massacred billions in the past.

When the members of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race heard that the man standing beside Huang Xiaolong was the King of Darkness, their bodies started to tremble with fear.

It was especially so for the first group of experts who had arrived to stop Huang Xiaolong. The blood drained from their faces as the feeling of narrowly escaping death washed over them.

The thought of a monstrous killer appeared in the minds of everyone who thought of the King of Darkness. In their eyes, he was a supreme devilish existence!

The King of Darkness turned to Du Hai and returned the greeting with one of his own. However, it wasn’t as enthusiastic as when Du Hai had greeted him as he remained expressionless. “I’ve heard about Brother Du Hai’s name as well.”

Du Hai burst into laughter when he heard how the King of Darkness addressed him. “I gained my fame through my deadly poison while Brother Darkness gained yours through combat. My reputation is far below yours.”

The King of Darkness stared at him and failed to produce a reply.

“Is there a reason you came to look for my Six Winged Green Mosquito Race?” Upon seeing that the King of Darkness was no longer going to reply to him, Du Hai returned to the main topic at hand. His gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong.

With his years of experience, he could tell that Huang Xiaolong was the person in charge. It was also why waves were crashing about in his heart. The person he was looking at was a mere late-Sixth Order Emperor. However, he commanded three Sovereign Realm experts around! Two of them were supreme existences like the Azure Cow and the King of Darkness! The more he thought about it, the more cautious he became. Du Hai didn’t dare to look down on Huang Xiaolong in the slightest.

Of course, he was tactful enough not to bring up the matters of Huang Xiaolong killing the pets they had raised.

“I need to enter the mountain range to look for something.” Huang Xiaolong pointed towards the mountain range below and said.

Since Huang Xiaolong knew that he wouldn’t be able to hide his intentions from Du Hai, he simply revealed his purpose. Of course, he wouldn’t speak a word about the item he was here to find.

Di Hai’s heart shook, and he chuckled, “It seems so... I wonder what fellow cultivator is looking for? If you tell me, I’ll get my men to get it for you.”

The little cow snorted coldly, “Old man, stop with your shady ideas. Just tell me if you are going to let us in. If you’re not, we’re going to start killing our way in.”

The experts of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race felt rage bubbling in their hearts, but none of them dared to speak out. After all, two monsters were standing on the opposing side.

Du Hai sank into silence as he thought about something. However, a smile soon formed on his face. “Old lady, don’t get angry! How about this. Since we know each other, I’ll let one person into my mountain range. He can go in, but everyone else has to wait for him here.”

“Impossible.” The little cow and the King of Darkness snorted in unison.

Sending Huang Xiaolong in alone was akin to sending him into a tiger’s den. No, in this case, they would be sending him into Du Hai’s mosquito nest.

Du Hai wasn’t an upright person, no matter what he might say.

A smile immediately appeared on Du Hai’s face as he had expected them to disagree. “Alright, if you plan on heading on in with him, you’ll need to pay a fee of one hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones per person! If the two of you want to go in, give me two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones!”
