Chapter 2448: Life Reversing Saint Godhead

Sui Yunfeng was ecstatic after hearing that, and he replied, “Thank you, Patriarch!”

He had gotten an opportunity to enter the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s treasury once in the past, and even though he had only seen as far as the outer hall, the treasures there had greatly moved him.

Shen Jiewen chuckled knowingly and motivated him. “After you defeat Huang Xiaolong, you should start calling me Master.”

“Yes, Patriarch!” Sui Yunfeng complied respectfully. He could barely keep the corners of his mouth from rising.

Huang Xiaolong watched Shen Jiewen and Sui Yunfeng’s warm interaction from the stage with a cold sneer formed on his face.

A second later, Sui Yunfeng briskly leaped onto the battle stage with the wind, landing with his head held high.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong’s strength really surpassed my estimation.” After getting on to the stage, Sui Yunfeng smiled confidently at Huang Xiaolong. “Your Highness’ complete dao saint godheads have probably advanced to the top fifty ranks, right?”

Earlier, there were guesses that Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads had advanced into the top one hundred ranks, but some thought this conjecture was too much an exaggeration. To this group of people, it was already an excellent result if Huang Xiaolong had managed to raise his complete dao saint godheads into the top two hundred ranks, but the strength Huang Xiaolong had shown in his match against Fang Xing had blown everyone away.

Fang Xing was someone with the Sacred Emperor Saint Godhead ranked at twenty-three!

Yet Fang Xing was defeated in one move!

Just seeing this, one could be certain that Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads had definitely advanced into the top one hundred ranks!

Thus, Sui Yunfeng estimated that Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads now ranked in the top fifty. If Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads had really improved and entered the top fifty ranks, then by adding his Holy Mandate Imprint to the equation, it was nothing strange that Huang Xiaolong could defeat Fang Xing.

As Sui Yunfeng thought of this, an uneasy feeling slowly crept back into his heart.

When Huang Xiaolong had registered for the Holy Heavens’ assessment, his complete dao saint godhead was tested to be the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead that was ranked nine hundred sixty-eighth!

At that time, Huang Xiaolong was reduced to a laughing stock on the spot. Later on, Huang Xiaolong had comprehended all twelve sacred steles in one go, and he had astounded everyone.

Now, in a short several decades, Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads had actually rushed up by almost a thousand places into the top fifty ranks?!

This was unprecedented!

Sui Yunfeng, Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Zhang Zhiyuan, Xie Bufan, and others could not hide the shock in their hearts.

They really could not figure it out as to how Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads had evolved at this frightening speed!

They had never heard of anything like this before.

Mo Cangli was Huang Xiaolong’s predecessor as the Holy World’s future’s strongest person. The speed of Mo Cangli’s saint godhead’s improvement rate was already shocking enough, but compared to Huang Xiaolong, Mo Cangli’s speed could be compared to a snail.

Even Li Chen, Xie Yao, and the others were jarred by Huang Xiaolong’s talent.

After hearing Sui Yunfeng guess that his complete dao saint godheads had entered the top fifty ranks, Huang Xiaolong smiled casually and responded, “You can say that.”

He was too lazy to explain.

Huang Xiaolong’s ‘admission’ sent great waves of shock against Sui Yunfeng, Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Xie Bufan, Li Chen, and the others’ hearts.

After the shock receded, Sui Yunfeng spoke again, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong’s talent is amazing. Then again, even though Your Highness’ complete dao saint godheads have risen to the top fifty ranks, and counting the Holy Mandate Imprint’s enhancement, you are still not my opponent. If you admit defeat now, and hand over that grandmist holy spiritual aura, I can....”

After listening to Sui Yunfeng speaking in a similar tone as Fang Xing did before, Huang Xiaolong’s patience was spent. He directly cut off Sui Yunfeng’s words, “Are you finished talking? If you’re done, make your move. Of course, if you admit defeat on your knees right now, I can spare your life.”

Sui Yunfeng’s face sank at Huang Xiaolong’s words, and he laughed in rage, “Very well, don’t blame me!” With that said, rings of holy light extended from his body as a complete dao saint godhead flew into the air.

This complete dao saint godhead’s appearance was different from the general complete dao saint godhead for it did not have a shape. Perhaps, it was more accurate to say that there were no words to describe its shape. On top of that, the light it emitted changed colors from colorful stripes to being entirely azure. Or it even changed its form. Once it was a prism, or then it was completely translucent like crystal, but every kind exuded a heart-palpitating charm!

That’s right, a charming power!

A kind of charming power that surpassed this realm of heaven and earth, jarring one’s soul.

Inside this complete dao saint godhead were tiny streams of energy, and these tiny streams of energy seemed to be infinite laws and principles, but these powers of laws and principles were ungraspable to others.

These tiny clear streams were flowing in a reverse direction.

Many experts in the crowd could feel the changes in the surroundings’ laws and principles as the tiny energy within the saint godhead flowed in reverse direction. These changes were too subtle at the moment for them to describe.

“Life Reversing Saint Godhead!” Someone shouted in awe.

The complete dao saint godhead that flew out from Sui Yunfeng’s body was exactly his Life Reversing Saint Godhead.

It was ranked sixteenth!

It was one of the rarer saint godheads found in the Holy World.

This was the first time some experts among the present holy grounds’ and ancient races’ present experts had seen such a high ranking complete dao saint godhead with their own eyes.

Each of the Holy World’s top ten complete dao saint godheads exuded heaven-shaking might. Although the Life Reversing Saint Godhead was not in the top ten, it was close enough. It was said to possess the heaven-defying power of changing one’s destiny which was terrifying to think of.

Huang Xiaolong was also genuinely amazed as he stared at the Life Reversing Saint Godhead in the air. Fang Xing’s complete dao saint godhead ranked twenty-third, and even though it was merely a difference of seven places between the two, the power of Sui Yunfeng’s complete dao saint godhead was certainly higher than several times.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, watch out. That River of Life is currently changing the time and space of the battle stage area!” From below the stage, one of the Holy Heavens’ experts shouted, seeing Huang Xiaolong’s dazed expression.

The tiny streams flowing within the Life Reversing Saint Godhead were none other than the River of Life! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Sui Yunfeng had yet to break through to True Saint Realm. And once he advanced to True Saint Realm, his Life Reversing Saint Godhead would undergo a world-shaking rise in power, and the River of Life flowing within, definitely won’t be these tiny streams anymore. When Sui Yunfeng enters True Saint Realm, these tiny streams would become hundred zhang wide rivers, and the saint godhead’s power would rise by several thousand times.

Upon hearing the Holy Heavens expert’s caution for Huang Xiaolong, Sui Yunfeng laughed aloud smugly, “Reminding him now is already too late!”

Just moments ago, his Life Reversing Saint Godhead’s River of Life had already started to change the time and space around the battle stage. It could be said that within the battle stage’s stipulated space, he was the overlord!

Within the battle stage space, he could do as he pleased! He could easily rob Huang Xiaolong’s vitality if he wanted to.

“Huang Xiaolong, I gave you a chance earlier.” Sui Yunfeng went on, “It’s a pity you didn’t grasp it.” As he said this, he spurred the power of his Life Reversing Saint Godhead.

In an instant, the River of Life emitted a blinding light.

“The light of destiny can defy the heavens to change destiny. Let’s see how I rob your vitality!” Sui Yunfeng bellowed, and the light of destiny flew towards Huang Xiaolong, as rings of light locked the battle stage’s space, cutting off all of Huang Xiaolong’s retreat.

The light of destiny submerged Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye.

Enveloped by the light of destiny, Huang Xiaolong’s body withered as his entire body’s vitality was rapidly flowing away.

Lin Xiaoying was anxious and agitated watching this. She pulled at Tan Juan’s sleeve and urged, “Senior Sister Tan Juan, what do we do? If the light of destiny continues to rush past him like this, even Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads will wither!”

Tan Juan shook her head, “Huang Xiaolong was careless. If he had made the first move and attacked Sui Yunfeng before he released the Life Reversing Saint Godhead, he could have had a winning chance, but now, there is only defeat!”

Ji Xinyi too shook her head. “At the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong was too complacent, thinking that since he had won over Fang Xing, he could easily defeat Sui Yunfeng as well.”
