Chapter 3665: Zhu Chen’s Location

Huang Xiaolong sauntered into the main hall of the palace and arrived before Zhu Ji and Zhu Yao. The various experts of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire were also present.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Yao who was stained red with blood and he dragged the man over to himself.

“Who the hell are you?! What do you want?!” Zhu Ji roared in fright and anger. “You dare to harm my second brother… Once Lord Father returns, he won’t let you off!”

“Zhu Chen won’t let me off?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow. “Do you think your father is my opponent?”

Zhu Ji stared at him in silence.

Turning to Zhu Yao, Huang Xiaolong snorted. “Go back to my mother? Weren’t you jumping around just a moment ago claiming that I won’t be able to break your grand formation?”

The blood drained from Zhu Yao’s face. He truly didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would be able to break through the grand formation. He had seen the power of the formation. His father, Zhu Chen, said that even the Dragon Overlord wouldn’t be able to break through forcefully!

Who would have thought that an unknown expert would be able to do so?!

He suppressed his shock and growled, “You only relied on your weapon to destroy the formation. Hmph, you wouldn’t be able to do a thing to us otherwise! You’re nobody without your weapon!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly. “If I’m nobody without my weapon, who are you without Zhu Chen’s formation?”

Zhu Yao was dumbfounded.

“What else do you have to say?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Zhu Yao stuttered, but no words came out of his mouth.

Huang Xiaolong tightened his grip on Zhu Yao and the latter’s body was crushed. Despite his creation level armor and physical body that was stronger than many half-step Universe Gods, he was still turned into a mist of blood.

Huang Xiaolong held the other party’s dao soul and tossed it into the Sun Moon Furnace.

The members of the Zhu Family flew into rage when they saw what happened to Zhu Yao.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You!” Zhu Ji jumped into the air and roared with anger.

Huang Xiaolong pressed down on the air in front of him and crushed the Zhu Lan Celestial Emperor into the ground.

…

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong looked down at the Zhu Lan City as he stood in the skies above.

In the days that passed, he managed to gain control over the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire.

Several moments later, Zhu Ji appeared behind Huang Xiaolong and he bowed respectfully, “Lord…”

“Is there news on your father?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Zhu Ji shook his head and bowed slightly, “No, there isn’t.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned. He had been getting Zhu Ji to contact Zhu Chen in the days that passed, but he failed to receive a reply. He didn’t even know what Zhu Chen went to the Green Ghost Lands for! He only knew that his father went to search for something.

Alas. Zhu Chen didn’t say anything about the item he was searching for. Huang Xiaolong expected him to reply to Zhu Ji’s reports, but he was wrong.

Huang Xiaolong asked Zhu Ji about other matters before dismissing him.

After Zhu Ji left, Gui Chi, Jian Wushuang, and the others appeared beside him.

“Lord, is there still no news about Zhu Chen?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly.

“Why don’t we go over to Fengdu City to search for him?” Jian Wushuang probed.

Gui Chi cackled happily, “Alright! I’m extremely familiar with the city!”

Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before sighing, “We won’t be heading there for now…”

The actions he took in the Unknown Lands were growing larger and larger. The chances of him exposing himself were huge! He needed to raise his strength before the Ferocious Devil and the others started to put up their guards against him.

He could only put aside the Zhu Chen matter for the time being.

Of course, he could cultivate in the Zhu Lan Palace while waiting for Zhu Chen to reappear.

Naturally, he got Jian Wushuang and the others to continue monitoring for news on Zhu Chen.

Huang Xiaolong sent Wu Xin and Ye Ye back to their respective territories. Even Gui Chi was sent back to the Green Ghost Lands! He didn’t want to arouse the Green Ghost’s suspicion, especially before he dealt with the other overlords!

Huang Xiaolong looked at Yu Xiaohong and chuckled softly, “You should go back too…”

She lowered her head and whispered softly, “I wish to stay by your side…”

“The situation in the Xiaohong Celestial Empire isn’t stable yet. You should go back and handle matters. You can come back when it’s all been dealt with. After all, my seclusion this time will take a couple million years.” Huang Xiaolong explained.

He had more than eight hundred universe-level spiritual veins after the battle in the Jian Family. With those in the Zhu Family’s treasury, he gathered more than a thousand.

According to his estimations, he would need at least a million years in seclusion to digest all of them!

Yu Xiaohong only nodded after learning that he would enter seclusion for a long time.

As night fell, Huang Xiaolong remained in the depths of the Zhu Lan Palace.

Naturally, he remained in the second layer of the universe boat. He chose ten strands of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins and tossed it into the eye of the formation. He started to circulate his Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art and devoured the universe qi in the air around him.

When Huang Xiaolong was cultivating in seclusion, Zhu Chen looked at a blood-red bridge before him and he hesitated slightly. He was currently in one of the spaces contained in the Green Ghost Lands.

He saw weird movement on the bridge, and it seemed as though bloodworms were tunneling around the place. If he looked closely at it, they seemed to resemble blood runes.

The bridge led into a deep abyss that no one could see the end of. Occasionally, creepy laughter would come from the depths.

“Naihe Bridge…” Zhu Chen muttered to himself.

If anyone were to hear the words that left his lips, the blood would drain out of their face immediately. The Naihe Bridge was the most terrifying forbidden ground in the Unknown Lands! No one knows what lied at the end of the bridge, but they were sure that leaving after reaching the end was something impossible! The Green Ghost attempted it once in the past and when he finally emerged, he said that he would never enter ever again! From the fear he held for the bridge, anyone could tell the terrors it held!

“There’s no reward without risk…” Zhu Chen seemed to have made up his mind. He took a bold step onto the Naihe Bridge and the moment he did, a blood wave that was countless miles high rushed towards him. Zhu Chen felt as though he had stepped into an endless hell as the squirming runes on the bridge converged at his location.

A light surrounded his body as he forced the squirming creatures back.

The bloodworms that were on the ground ate through the grand cosmos energy around him and he continued on his way forward. The deeper he went, the stronger the corrosive ability.
