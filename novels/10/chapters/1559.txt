The Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder Chen Qinghai was in the midst of reporting to Hall Master Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu inside a hall when he suddenly sensed his communication talisman shook. He frowned and stopped speaking.

Seeing Chen Qinghai’s reaction, Wang Shuchen asked, “The people below reported something?”

Chen Qinghai respectfully answered, “It is so, Hall Master.”

“Since it’s a report from the people below, it should be something important, take a look at it now.” Wang Shuchen permitted.

With Wang Shuchen’s permission, Chen Qinghai could only comply. He then took out the communication talisman and when his divine sense swept over the message within it, his forehead creased into deep furrows.

Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu looked doubtfully at Chen Qinghai’s reaction.

“What’s the matter?” Wang Shuyu asked.

Chen Qinghai truthfully relayed the Devil Tiger City’s Mayor Wu Chao’s message to the two Hall Masters.

After listening to Chen Qinghai’s report, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu exchanged a glance.

Wang Shuyu’s expression turned cold as he said, “Another group that dares to injure my Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s disciple in the Floating Twilight Land! Looks like disciples of my Martial Demon Emperor Palace have been keeping a low-profile for too long that stray cats and dogs think my Martial Demon Emperor Palace is a soft persimmon they can squash as they please?!”

“The other side has a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert?” Wang Suchen asked Chen Qinghai.

Chen Qinghai respectfully replied, “This is what Wu Chao said.”

Wang Shuyu spoke solemnly, “If it’s a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert, you won’t be able to help on your own. Since we’re here, both of us will go take a look with you.”

Chen Qinghai was genuinely surprised, “Hall Master wants to go over there personally? In fact...”

Wang Shuyu waved his hand and said, “Enough said, let’s head over there now. The two of us are going into seclusion for a period of time when we return.”

“Yes, Hall Master!”

Chen Qinghai had no choice but to comply.

Thus, Chen Qinghai went out of the hall following behind Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu. The three flew straight towards the Devil Tiger City.

Before Chen Qinghai, Wang Shuyu, and Wang Shuchen departed, the Devil Tiger City’s Mayor Wu Chao received a message about their impending arrival. Wu Chao was elated and excited

Hall Master Wang Shuyu and Hall Master Wang Shuchen were coming as well!

Although he was the Devil Tiger City’s Mayor, he had never had a chance to associate with upper echelons’ existences such as Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu.

Watching Wu Chao’s obvious excitement, Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang were baffled.

“I just received my Master’s message, and he said that our Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Master Wang Shuchen and Hall Master Wang Shuyu are coming here with him!” Wu Chao spilled the good news before Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang could ask any questions.

“What! Your Hall Master Wang Shuchen and Hall Master Wang Shuyu are coming!” Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang were pleasantly surprised hearing Wu Chao’s words.

They had naturally heard of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu—one was a late-Fourth Order Emperor Realm master and the other was a mid-Fifth Order Emperor Realm master!

Both of them were mid-level Emperor Realm masters ah!

Although Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu were not as famous as the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Ancestors, they had a loud reputation.

Watching Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang’s eyes widen in astonishment, there was a kind of smug joy in Wu Chao’s heart. He smiled and added, “It’s our Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Master Wang Shuyu and Hall Master Wang Shuchen!”

Tian Ziyi smiled when he reacted. “I wouldn’t have expected Hall Master Wang Shuyu and Hall Master Wang Shuchen to come here personally. This time, that punk can’t fly even if he grows wings.”

Bai Yunxiang chimed in, “If that punk knew two of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Hall Masters were coming over here to kill him personally, I wonder what kind of expressions he would make?”

“What expression can he make? Frightened silly, I bet.” Wu Chao chimed in on the joke.

The three laughed and chattered on. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Considering the Master and the two Hall Masters’ speed, they should arrive here very soon. We should go and welcome them,” said Wu Chao.

“Alright, we’ll go welcome them with Brother Wu Chao.” Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang both followed behind Wu Chao.

Facing Wang Shuyu and Wang Shuchen, neither Tian Ziyi nor Bai Yunxiang dared to act superior.

Wu Chao, Tian Ziyi, and Bai Yunxiang led a group of people to the Devil Tiger City’s transmission array and waited patiently for Wang Shuchen’s group of three to arrive.

Shortly, the quiet transmission array suddenly emitted flickering radiant rays of lights. Then, three figures appeared in the middle of the transmission array.

The Devil Tiger City was only a short distance away from the Martial Demon Emperor Palace. So, it took Wang Shuchen’s group less than half an hour’s time to reach their destination by transmission array.

Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu were not surprised to see Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and other Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples waiting by the transmission array to welcome them. Wu Chao had mentioned that Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang were at the Devil Tiger City in his report to Chen Qinghai, and Chen Qinghai had informed Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu of the same.

Seeing Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, and Chen Qinghai step out from the transmission array, Wu Chao and other Devil Tiger City’s experts stepped up to greet them. Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and other Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples cupped their fists in greeting as well, and their demeanor was extremely respectful.

Wang Shuchen went straight to the point. He asked Wu Chao, “Where are those people now? Lead us to them.”

Wu Chao respectfully complied, not daring to talk too much.

Wu Chao turned and led Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, Chen Qinghai, and the rest towards the location of Huang Xiaolong’s group.

He had sent people to follow Huang Xiaolong’s group earlier, hence he knew that Huang Xiaolong’s group was actually drinking inside a restaurant not far ahead.

Huang Xiaolong’s group would be dying miserably in a short while, would they still be in the mood to enjoy the wine in their cup? Wu Chao sneered inwardly.

As Wu Chao’s group were hurrying over, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Jiang Hong, and the others were indeed enjoying a cup of wine in a restaurant.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong’s group had long discovered the people Wu Chao had sent to track them, but none of them really cared. They were waiting to see what the Devil Tiger City’s Mayor planned to do.

A short while later, Wu Chao arrived with Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, Chen Qinghai, and the others to the restaurant where Huang Xiaolong’s group was drinking merrily.

Wu Chao pointed at the restaurant and informed Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, and Chen Qinghai respectfully, “Hall Masters, Master, they are drinking inside. Should I go and order them to come outside?”

Wang Shuchen spoke, “No need for so much trouble, let’s just go inside.” With that, he and Wang Shuyu strode into the restaurant. Chen Qinghai, Wu Chao, and the others followed closely behind them.

As Huang Xiaolong’s group was seated right at the center of the restaurant, Wu Chao spotted them almost immediately and he prompted, “Hall Masters, Master, it’s them right there!” He pointed a finger at the table where Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and others were seated.

Cold and cruel gleams of light burst out from Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang when they saw Huang Xiaolong.

In the meantime, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu’s faces turned pale when they saw Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong. Their lofty manner shattered in an instant as fear took over them. Their hands started trembling and knees almost buckled under their weight.

Although Martial Demon Emperor Mo Xiao had not disclosed Jiang Hong’s real identity to them, the news that Mo Xiao had been injured had still reached the ears of Hall Masters like Wang Shuchen, as well as the Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Ancestors.

Not even their Martial Demon Emperor Mo Xiao was a match against Jiang Hong!

Furthermore, with Mo Xiao’s order to avoid stirring up trouble with Huang Xiaolong, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu couldn’t help feeling fearful seeing Huang Xiaolong’s group again.

“Hall Masters, Master, why don’t I go up and capture them?” Wu Chao inquired about Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, and Chen Qinghai’s opinion. Only then did he notice the fear on Wang Suchen and Wang Shuyu’s faces, and was stupefied.
