Chapter 3732: Brute Force

 

Those who were charging at him a second ago jumped in fright when they noticed the five universe treasures.

Many of them stopped dead in their tracks.

“Star… Star Dragon Divine Tree!” 

“Kill Huang Xiaolong and all his treasures will belong to us!” Zhou Fu yelled in excitement, “Kill! Kill him right now!” 

Leaping towards Huang Xiaolong, a giant axe appeared in his hand. The axe seemed to be born from darkness as it was jet black in color. As the axe slashed towards Huang Xiaolong, a weird absorption strength emerged.

Shi Jian used a long spear that glowed an earthly yellow. It shot towards Huang Xiaolong as the earth below trembled. A shocking amount of power emerged from beneath the ground and went straight for Huang Xiaolong’s legs.

Huang Ren used the deformed Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade to chop at Huang Xiaolong once again.

As for the other experts, they attacked in unison.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

What would happen when over two hundred experts at their level struck at once?

The heavens shattered as the city was blasted to smithereens.

Every single structure in the city crumbled in an instant as the space around them showed signs of cracking.

It was utter annihilation.

Yang Dingsheng gasped in horror as Huang Xiaolong circulated the Universe Transformation Art.

29 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body instantly. Huang Xiaolong no longer held back.

As he revealed his full strength, a blinding ray of light emerged from the various universe treasures he revealed.

The Star Dragon Divine Tree spewed out star dragon qi endlessly as the Universe Origin Fires turned into a blazing inferno that swept towards the members of the Fortune Space. The Golden Sun Circlets turned into a shining golden dragon as the Blade of Death emitted waves of death qi. The Three Gods Halberd drew over the power of water from all over the lands.

Die!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t retreat in the slightest when faced with so many experts. The weapons in his hands swung towards the nearest few.

Rip!

The artifacts in the hands of those from the Fortune Space were torn to shreds by the Blade of Death and the Three Gods Halberd. When they were struck by the energy wave that followed, many of them were sent flying as they spat out mouthfuls of blood.

In the instant Huang Xiaolong made his move, the White Deer did the same. It rushed into the group of experts as a milky white flame covered its body. Two rays of light emerged from its horns.

The light that emerged seemed to contain the purest form of radiance energy in the Thirteen Universes!

Everyone felt as though their dao souls were trembling when the light emerged.

The faces of Huang Ren and the others changed. “Beware! That’s the Light of Life!” 

Light of Life!

There was only a single existence who possessed a bloodline strong enough to wield the Light of Life!

As the source of all life, the Light of Life not only had the power to give life… It could also take away whatever vitality one had!

Despite their warning, it came a little too late. One of the ancient ancestors was struck by the Light of Life.

In an instant, his divine armor and the grand cosmos energy he used to protect himself shattered.

The Light of Life didn’t stop there. It continued towards someone else! It pierced through another expert before carrying on to the third.

Finally reacting, the third expert sent out a punch to stop the Light of Life but he was far too weak compared to the White Deer. The Light of Life pierced through his arm and went straight into his chest.

Zhou Fu yelled in shock, “F*ck! Don’t bother fighting it! Dodge it! Unless you have a universe treasure, you won’t be able to block the Light of Life!” 

It was too bad the Light of Life reached the fourth expert.

When the fifth in line managed to dodge the Light of Life, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Slamming straight into the only structure left standing in Lion King City, the city walls, the Light of Life tore a massive hole through it.

“You… You’re the Master of the White Deer Cave!” someone gasped in terror.

Previously, everyone had their eyes on Huang Xiaolong. No one would pay attention to an unassuming white deer that was beside him! Now, everyone felt their minds buzzing in shock when they thought of its identity.

Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian were equally as shocked.

Even though they had never seen the White Deer, they knew how scary it was.

If they fought it one-on-one, none of them would be its match!

Another change happened on the battlefield as blood qi filled the skies. Six oddly shaped creatures appeared beside Huang Xiaolong.

“Are those the five monster kings from the Netherworld in the Unknown Space?!” someone screamed.

They were right. Those were indeed the monster kings from the Netherworld. However, there was something they were mistaken about. There were six of them! Not many people knew about the existence of the Ghost Devil King, but he was the strongest among the six!

“No! They are the six monster kings!” Zhou Fu yelled in fright.

No one expected Huang Xiaolong to subdue them all.

“That’s right,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “It’s my turn now. Kill them all!” 

The Blade of Death and Three Gods Halberd disappeared all of a sudden. In their place appeared a golden boat.

The golden light around the boat contained the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes, and a mysterious qi surrounded all of them.

“Could it be?!” A horrifying thought flashed through Huang Ren’s mind, and his expression changed.

The golden boat in his hand expanded by tens of thousands of times and it covered the skies above Lion King City.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand once and sent the Universe Boat smashing into the crowd.

Not many people reacted in time and many of them were struck. When they were, they were sent flying.

The golden light around the Universe Boat wasn’t for show. It contained extreme power and it shot towards Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian!

“That’s the Universe Boat! Hurry up and run!” Zhou Fu gasped.

It was too bad that the Universe Boat was too damn fast! No one could escape!

Seeing as there was no way out, Shi Jian screamed in a last-ditch attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong. “Die!” 

He circulated all the energy he had in order to block the incoming boat.

Huang Ren and Zhou Fu did the same. When they unleashed everything they had at once, not even Old Man Fortune would dare to take the strike head-on. However, Huang Xiaolong was no Old Man Fortune and the Universe Boat was no ordinary treasure.

Huang Xiaolong commanded the boat to crash straight into them!

The instant their attacks landed on the body of the Universe Boat, they were sent flying.
