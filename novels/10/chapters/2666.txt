Chapter 2667: Being Hunted

After escaping the giant octopus, Huang Xiaolong continued flying cautiously.

Two days went by.

Huang Xiaolong had reached deep into the dire region.

At this point, his surroundings were so dark that he had an illusion of reaching the end of the world, where darkness, emptiness, and loud silence dominated. Was this what the beginning of the heavens was like?

While Huang Xiaolong flew further in with caution, out of nowhere, a strong feeling of danger overcame him, and Huang Xiaolong immediately dodged away without thinking.

He barely dodged out of danger’s way, when a huge palm force struck down where Huang Xiaolong was a split second ago. A palm imprint abyss appeared on the ground below, raising violent tremors.

A wave of several attacks came at Huang Xiaolong from a few different directions the moment he dodged away. Huang Xiaolong’s expression tightened, he had nowhere to avoid these attacks, hence the Flying Heaven Spear and Cangqiong Blade appeared in his hands. At the same time, the Cangqiong Dao Palace and Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring flew out from his body simultaneously.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

RUMBLE!

Several consecutive booms thundered almost at the same time, and Huang Xiaolong had already exchanged several blows with the enemies. The overwhelming force sent Huang Xiaolong staggering backward miserably more than once, and finally smashing through mountain peaks.

Blood rushed up and Huang Xiaolong violently coughed out a mouthful of blood. He raised his head and saw Yuan Qianxing and five old men around Yuan Qianxing in a guarding stance as they looked coldly at him.

“Yuan Qianxing!”

“Chan Yuli!”

Huang Xiaolong growled the names of two familiar faces.

No wonder, he had felt there was a pair of eyes staring at him along the way.

In truth, he had been on his guard the whole time, but he didn’t expect that these people would join hands in order to kill him.

“Hehe, Huang Xiaolong, you didn’t expect this, right?” After seeing Huang Xiaolong coughing up blood, Yuan Qianxing laughed with undisguised joy, “The six of us joined hands just to deal with you. You should feel honored. Wait till we’ve destroyed your physical body, we’ll seal your holy souls and Inextinguishable Dao Heart, to be used when we’re refining pills or dao artifacts!”

Huang Xiaolong scoffed, “Even if I die, I’ll pull one or two of you with me! Which one of you wants to go first!”

Yuan Qianxing and Chan Yuli’s faces turned ugly. If Huang Xiaolong were to go all out in desperation, he would really pull one or two of them to hell with him. Whether they wanted to admit it or not, Huang Xiaolong had the strength to do that!

Moreover, never in their wildest imagination had they thought that Huang Xiaolong would actually have four dao artifacts in his hands!

Four!

Being the weaker ones amongst the six people, the thought of withdrawing flitted across the minds of the Golden Buddha Race’s Old Ancestor Chan Yuli and Enchantress Race’s Yao Chengxin. In the past, Chan Yuli had experienced the power of Huang Xiaolong’s Thousand Armed Holy Devil when he had passed by the Golden Buddha Domain.

As for Yao Chengxin, even though he hadn’t fought with Huang Xiaolong, he was well aware that he wouldn't be able to defeat Yuan Qianxing. Even Yuan Qianxing had suffered such an abuse on the battle stage under Huang Xiaolong’s hand, fleeing with his underpants barely hanging on, then could he, an early Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor, suppress Huang Xiaolong?

“Enough with the greetings!” The black-robed old man, Elder Ming, cut in. His cold gaze swept across Chan Yuli and Yao Chengxin, who had birthed the thought of withdrawing, and he chided, “Primal Ancestors like you are frightened off by a few words from a Fourth Heaven True Saint brat?! Leave everything to me!”

Chan Yuli and Yao Chengxin felt their faces burn with embarrassment, but neither of them dared to retort.

Huang Xiaolong’s attention shifted onto the black-robed old man, and he said, “It looks like you’re that Elder Ming.”

Before coming to the Alien Lands, the Heavenly Master had reminded him to be careful of the Alien Lands’ two top experts, one was the Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi, the other was this Elder Ming.

Elder Ming’s origin was a mystery, and even the Heavenly Master or the Alien Lands’ native Primal Ancestor experts did not know his background. However, Elder Ming’s strength was undeniable.

“It looks like your master, Old Man Long, and Cangqiong Old Fogey have mentioned me.” The black-robed Elder Ming laughed sinisterly. Even when laughing, his eyes still glimmered in an eerie red glow.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re destined to have one end today! Of course, if Cangqiong Old Fogey was here today, he might have saved you.” Elder Ming sneered, “It’s a pity though that he is not here.”

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a flicker, seizing the initiative to attack and arriving in front of Chan Yuli. The Flying Heaven Spear stabbed out decisively as Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads, twelve high-order Saint Fates, Holy Mandate Imprint, and Inextinguishable Dao Heart’s powers went out at full force.

“The Prosperity of Dragons!”

Amazing dragon might swept the four directions.

There was a dark glint on Huang Xiaolong’s solemn face. He had already said it just now that he was going to pull one or two of them down with him, and the first choice was Chan Yuli.

Once he killed Chan Yuli, it would definitely cast a shadow in the other five people’s eyes, and that would be his best opportunity to make a run for it.

Chan Yuli hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to attack all of a sudden instead of making a run for it, and him being the first target!

There already was a shadow in Chan Yuli’s heart, thus when he realized Huang Xiaolong was targeting him, he nearly jumped out of his skin. His face was distorted as his palm struck towards Huang Xiaolong, and he subconsciously shouted, “Elder Ming, save me!”

Although Huang Xiaolong couldn’t really kill him, the dao physique of a Primal Ancestor wasn’t really indestructible. If Huang Xiaolong’s attack was powerful enough, Huang Xiaolong could destroy his dao physique.

The other five had not expected Huang Xiaolong to actually attack them first, but the moment Huang Xiaolong made his move, the black-robed Elder Ming reacted and struck out with his palm. Darkness howled, and the surroundings’ darkness seemed to swarm towards Huang Xiaolong.

It was as if Elder Ming was the dire region’s monarch.

Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, Yao Chengxin, and Mo Jincheng reacted a second later and threw attacks at Huang Xiaolong.

However, Huang Xiaolong had expected Yuan Qianxing, and others would attack, thus the Cangqiong Dao Palace above him emitted a bright light that resembled a galaxial river, forming the Cangqiong World around him. At the same time, the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring, circulated around Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong wasted no time in throwing out the Cangqiong Blade in his hand.

Cangqiong blade rays shot through the sky, straight at the five people.

Whereas, the Flying Heaven Spear went straight towards Chan Yuli’s chest.

Huang Xiaolong’s actions showed his determination to kill Chan Yuli at the risk of being injured!

And his determination terrorized Chan Yuli.

Rumble!

As Yuan Qianxing and the others parried off the waves of blade storm, it knocked the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring onto the Cangqiong World’s barrier. By this time, Huang Xiaolong’s Flying Heaven Spear had pierced through Chan Yuli’s palm force straight into his chest, piercing his Inextinguishable Dao Heart.

Huang Xiaolong was knocked into the air by Yuan Qianxing and the others’ attack. With his Flying Heaven Spear still in Chan Yuli’s chest, Huang Xiaolong dragged Chan Yuli with him. The entire time, the Flying Heaven Spear’s destructive energy was obliterating Chan Yuli’s vitality.

Huang Xiaolong and Chan Yuli crashed into the valley in the far distance, and everything in the valley crumbled. Next came Chan Yuli’s miserable scream.

In the same instant the valley crumbled, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Flying Heaven Spear, and entered the Cangqiong Dao Palace in a flicker. The Cangqiong Dao Palace immediately sped away in a streak of light, tearing through the void with Huang Xiaolong in it. He was gone from sight.

“Chase!”

Elder Ming’s harsh bellow reverberated in the air as he went chasing after Huang Xiaolong.

Yuan Qianxing and the others hesitated, but followed in the end.

As for Chan Yuli, he was left lying in the crumbled valley, under the rubbles, until he was swallowed by the dire region’s darkness.
