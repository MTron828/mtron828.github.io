Chapter 3513: There Can Only Be One

 

Huang Xiaolong mocked, “I must be pretty lucky to be brought here…”

Even up until now, Huang Xiaolong had no idea how he managed to appear in the core of the Star Dragon Universe.

“I’ve heard that I can obtain a peerless treasure after comprehending the Dragon Eyes Cliff… Is that true?” Huang Xiaolong asked, “Wasn’t there supposed to be Star Dragon Essence here?”

That was the only problem he was concerned about. After all, he would only be able to treat his father’s injuries with the Star Dragon Essence.

“You’re looking for the Star Dragon Essence?” 

“Yes. I heard that the Star Dragon Essence can stabilize my father’s condition,” Huang Xiaolong explained. He spoke about the matter of Huang Sheng stealing his father’s bloodline.

“The Star Dragon Essence might be useful when it comes to treating injuries, but your father is at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. You won’t be able to stop his condition from deteriorating with the Star Dragon Essence alone.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank when he heard the explanation. “Do I really have to hunt down Huang Sheng in order to retrieve his bloodline?”

“That’s right. That is the only method you can use in order to return your father to his peak state. However, there is a way to stabilize his condition so it doesn’t get worse.” 

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened as joy flashed through them.

“You have the four universe origin fires, and they’re a universe-level treasure. However, they don’t belong to me. Every universe will possess its own treasure, and the treasure of my Star Dragon Universe is called the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Your father’s condition would be much better if he refines the Star Dragon Origin in the tree.”

“Star Dragon Divine Tree?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Where is it right now?”

“I can tell you the location of the tree, but you have to promise me something,” The universe muttered.

“What’s that?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned. He didn’t expect the universe to ask for a favor.

“You have to kill Yu Long in the future.” 

Huang Xiaolong stared at the space around him in stunned silence. He didn’t expect the universe to ask him to kill the principal of the Submerged Dragon Institution, Yu Long!

“Yu Long is at the peak of the grand completion stage…” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I am unable to kill him.”

“Of course, you’re not. Not right now. He can suppress you with a single finger, but when you enter the Universe God Realm in the future, killing him would be effortless.” 

“Why do you want to kill him? “Huang Xiaolong asked.

He didn’t understand how Yu Long offended the universe. After all, the universe was formless, and it was impossible to offend a formless object.

“You don’t need to know the reason. All you need to do is promise me that you’ll kill him.” The voice in his mind turned a little cold.

It was evident that Huang Xiaolong’s question had already displeased the Star Dragon Universe. After all, who would be happy to relieve some memories best left forgotten?

“How can you be so sure that I’ll break through to the Universe God Realm?” Huang Xiaolong asked.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Falling into silence for a moment, the universe muttered, “That is because you’re the first person who managed to enter this place.”

Huang Xiaolong was shocked. The Star Dragon Universe dared to bet on the fact that he would break through because he entered the core of the Star Dragon universe.

“Do you think it’s easy to enter this space?” the universe chided. “Not even Xu Long and Yu Long managed to come close! Moreover, you have three great worlds, and you’re the only existence in the thirteen universes to reach this level! If you can’t enter the Universe God Realm, no one can.”

“Alright. I promise you!” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

If he had to make a choice between healing his father and killing Yu Long, he wouldn’t hesitate. 

The voice in Huang Xiaolong’s head became a lot more friendly in an instant. “Good. However, it’s useless to make a verbal promise. You need to swear on my Star Dragon Universe that you will do as you say!”

Without much thought, he swore that he would kill Yu Long when he became strong enough. All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of information branding itself into his soul. He learned a lot more about the Star Dragon Universe in an instant.

“Alright. I will reveal the whereabouts of the tree now. It’s in the Golden Radiant World!”

“Golden Radiant World?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

He might not have been in the Star Dragon Universe for long, but he knew about the worlds scattered around. None of them were called the Golden Radiant World.

“It’s not surprising you haven’t heard of it. After all, I’m the only one who knows of the existence of the Golden Radiant World. It’s hidden in one of the rivers of light, and it’s a world formed naturally during the birth of the universe!”

“Naturally formed world?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in fright.

If it was comparable to the World of Departed Souls back in the Blazing Dragon Universe, that would be great! He would also be able to refine the great world to increase his strength!

That’s right. It’s a naturally formed great world. Moreover, it’s one of the oldest worlds in my universe. It’s even older than the Bearded Dragon World and the Submerged Dragon Institution, and the universe origin energy gathered in it has reached a tremendous amount. There are universe origin spiritual veins too.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a long breath. “Are there other naturally formed great worlds in your universe?!”

“Of course.” The universe hesitated for a moment before replying, “Other than the Golden Radiant World, there is another great world called the Oasis Great World. However, the origin essence contained in it cannot be compared to the Golden Radiant World.”

Huang Xiaolong thanked the Star Dragon Universe earnestly, “Thank you very much!”

With the two great worlds, Huang Xiaolong’s strength would take a great leap forward. When that happened, he would devour Chu Huaixiong and Chu Huaihua. He would experience another considerable increase in power.

As such, Huang Xiaolong was sincerely thankful to the Star Dragon Universe.

“There’s no need to thank me. I’m helping myself by doing this. I only hope that you can break through to the Universe God Realm soon. You might not know this, but only a single Universe God can exist in our thirteen universes!”

Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. “A single Universe God?!”

His newfound knowledge shocked him.

“That’s right. As such, you need to be the only one to break through! There are many experts at the peak of the God of Creation Realm in the thirteen universes, and as long as one of them breaks through, you will never be able to.”

“Why is that?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“You can never imagine how terrifying a Universe God is. As long as one enters the Universe God Realm, they will be able to control all thirteen universes! That person will be able to move the sources of the universes as they see fit, and even I will fall prey to them! When that happens, nothing in the thirteen universes can be hidden from them! Do you think one will allow someone else to challenge their prestige in the Universe God Realm?”

“Every single expert who poses a threat would be controlled or even killed!”
