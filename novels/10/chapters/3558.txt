Chapter 3559 – Shattered Formation

Jiang Shaoyu might not know why those people standing behind Huang Xiaolong submitted to him, but he was the only person she could count on! Without thinking further, she begged Huang Xiaolong as tears streamed down her face.

“The Creation Palace joined hands with the Eternal Heaven Alliance?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. It seemed as though the worst case scenario had happened.

He might be the strongest existence in the First Universe, but he would find it annoying to deal with Kun Feng, Xuan Hong, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong if they joined hands.

“Yes… They plan on swallowing the Solitary Alliance, Hundred Empire Alliance, and all the smaller powers! They would split the First Universe evenly between them!” An expert from the Solitary Alliance explained. “Fellow cultivator Huang Xiaolong, please save us! We will definitely return the favor in the future!”

“Fellow cultivator Huang, please save our alliance!” The experts of the Solitary Alliance pleaded in unison.

“How many experts did they send to attack your alliance?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“More than two hundred from each organization came! There should be four hundred of them in total!” Jiang Shaoyu explained.

“Four hundred…” Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. With his current strength and the subordinates he captured in the Unknown Lands, they would probably win when it came down to an all out brawl.

Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated as he dealt with the experts from the Creation Palace. In an instant, he suppressed them all in the Sun Moon Furnace.

“We’re going to the Solitary Alliance right now!” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Wang Zaixu and the rest.

Activating the flying ship, they changed their course to head towards the headquarters of the Solitary Alliance.

As they weren’t too far away, they could probably reach in two short days! The only question was, could Jiang Hong and the others hold out for that long?

The Solitary Alliance had two hundred experts. They were severely outnumbered by their opponents!

They could only rely on the Solitary Alliance’s grand formation to delay the slaughter!

Huang Xiaolong looked at Jiang Shaoyu’s anxious expression and he sighed, “Relax… They might have brought so many people along, but breaking through the grand formation isn’t an easy matter. They might need a few days to do so.”

Calming down slightly, Jiang Shaoyu finally thought of the capabilities of the grand formation. The only problem was that she left the alliance three days ago! Since they needed two days to return, the formation might not be able to hold out!

The more she thought about it, the more sullen her expression became.

“Xiaolong, can we go faster?” Jiang Shaoyu asked.

“This is the fastest we can go…” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

Jiang Shaoyu’s expression sank slightly.

While Huang Xiaolong told them to hurry up, he got Tao Shi and the rest to uncover what was happening in the Solitary Alliance.

Two days passed in a flash, and Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived above the Solitary City.

With the strength of the Creation Palace, they had long since conquered the city. The great army of the Creation Palace locked the place down, preventing anyone from escaping. There were countless troops standing guard around the city, and they blocked out the skies. At the very least, there were a trillion troops!

As the army was formed by the elites from the various celestial empires under the Creation Palace, the weakest soldier was a Primal Ancestor! Captains of their squad were Dao Venerables, and the generals were those who had comprehended the elements. Their great marshal was someone who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand perfection level!

However, they were completely useless when it came to stopping Huang Xiaolong’s group. Driving the high-grade creation artifact-level flying ship forward, they met with no opposition.

The army might be able to hold out against several Gods of Creation at the small completion stage, but they were like dust in the air when matched up with Huang Xiaolong!

Every single second, countless experts would explode into blood mist as they were unable to avoid the flying ship.

From far, the flying ship looked as though it was traveling through a bloodied river!

When Huang Xiaolong charged towards the headquarters of the Solitary Alliance, Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen who were in charge of the offensive received a report of a mysterious group of experts coming to the Solitary Alliance’s aid.

They looked at each other in shock.

“Do you know who they are?! How many people did they bring?” Xuan Hong asked.

“We do not know how many people they brought. However, they’re using the second palace master’s flying ship!”

Out of all the flying ships Huang Xiaolong had, Kai Dong’s flying ship was of the highest quality!

“Second Brother?!” Xuan Hong frowned.

“Could it be Huang Xiaolong and Tao Shi?” Chen Yizhen growled angrily. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xuan Hong’s expression started to sink. “Huang Xiaolong! We’ve been looking for you for millions of years! Who would have thought that you would send yourself to us?”

“There is something off about Palace Master Kai Dong’s disappearance. Now that Huang Xiaolong is back, we need to be careful. Should we call Palace Master Kun Feng and the others?”

Xuan Hong shook his head. “My big brother is stationed in the Creation Palace. It would take months for him to rush over.” Glancing at Chen Yizhen, Xuan Hong muttered, “Even without him, the two of us should be more than enough to take Huang Xiaolong down. We have so many experts here and there is no need to be afraid of Huang Xiaolong!”

Chen Yizhen swept his gaze across the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance before nodding his head solemnly.

“We have to break the formation as soon as possible!” Xuan Hong yelled. “I’ll give you an hour to destroy the grand formation of the Solitary Alliance!”

After so many days of bombardment, the great formation of the Solitary Alliance was in tatters. They were confident of breaking through in an hour.

Even though Huang Xiaolong was already killing his way over, it would take several hours for him to arrive.

One hour later…

A massive explosion rang through the skies as the barrier of light formed by the formation slowly started to dissipate.

A sinister laughter left Xuan Hong’s lips as he laid down his order. “Kill!”

Chen Yizhen led the experts of both factions into the Solitary Alliance.

However, a massive palm emerged from the void to stop them dead in their tracks. Jiang Hong and the experts of the Solitary Alliance tore through the air and stood before Chen Yizhen.

Xuan Hong roared with laughter when he saw Jiang Hong. “Jiang Hong, all of you should surrender immediately. When we conquer the thirteen universes, you’ll be heavily rewarded! Isn’t that much better than your current situation?!”
