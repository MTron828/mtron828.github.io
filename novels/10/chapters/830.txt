“Three days!” Green Dragon Beast King, Ancestor Bifang, and Ancestor Mountaingoat, who were already fatigued from so many days of exertion, were suddenly brimming with energy and continued to frenziedly attack the light barrier.

One day, two days, three days...

The cracks grew larger day by day, reaching the edges of the light barrier. At last, the colorful light barrier shook violently and shattered.

A clear crisp sound rang in the air.

Hearing this noise, the Piercing Sky Beast King and the others’ faces showed mad joy.

However, an overwhelming energy gushed out from the cracked light barrier, rushing toward them. All four of them were startled, but just as they wanted to retreat, it was already too late.

Under this rush of overwhelming energy, the four people were like broken kites, mercilessly flung into the distance, skidding off from the water surface and onto land.

All four felt warm liquid gurgle up their throats, and in the next second vomited a large mouthful of blood. To their horror, the energy was wreaking havoc inside their bodies, destroying their meridians and even their soul sea!

Before this unknown force, the four of them who had already exhausted their godforce after more than ten days of attacking the light barrier had no way of resisting.

Inch by inch, their meridians shattered. At the same time, their soul sea was shaking uncontrollably.

Watching everything from afar, the elation in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes was unconcealable. This result exceeded the best scenario he had imagined.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had hoped the four old monsters would be too depleted of godforce after half a month of continuously attacking the light barrier. At that time, he would seize the chance to act. But now, right when the colorful light barrier broke, he didn’t expect it to release such a terrifying energy, directly injuring all four of them.

Huang Xiaolong emerged from his concealment, approaching the Piercing Beast Beast King’s group.

Hearing footsteps behind them, Ancestor Mountaingoat and the others were alarmed. They ignored their own injuries and quickly turned their heads to look.

“You, Huang Xiaolong!” Ancestor Mountaingoat blurted out when he saw the face of the approaching person.

The Piercing Sky Beast King, Green Dragon Beast King, and Ancestor Bifang had never seen Huang Xiaolong before. Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s name from Ancestor Mountaingoat’s mouth, the three of them were stunned, this person was actually the famed genius of the four galaxies, Huang Xiaolong?

“So, it was you.” The Piercing Sky Beast King spoke. Earlier, the weak energy fluctuation he felt was not an illusion, he just didn’t know what kind of secret technique Huang Xiaolong used to escaped their detection.

When Huang Xiaolong drew closer, he intentionally walked toward the Piercing Sky Beast King, extending his right hand, “Take out the treasure map.” Although the colorful light barrier was already destroyed, Huang Xiaolong felt that the treasure map had other great uses.

The Piercing Sky Beast King was momentarily stunned, then he broke out on laughter as he slowly got to his feet. His eyes were bloodshot as his glared at Huang Xiaolong with an evil grin on his face, “Runt, I have to admit you’ve got guts. You think the four of us are injured, therefore we’re fish on your chopping block that you can skin or slaughter as you like?”

Ancestor Mountaingoat, Green Dragon Beast King, and Ancestor Bifang also got up on their feet, letting out scratchy laughter.

“Huang Xiaolong, I know your strength is not low, I heard that even the Evil Ghost Ancestor died in your hands, but in our eyes, that Evil Ghost Ancestor was only a slightly bigger ant.” Ancestor Mountaingoat chuckled with a hint of bloodlust, “I’m not afraid to tell you, the four of us are Third Order Highgod Realm masters! Even if all of us are suffering from heavy injuries, killing you would be as easy as turning over our palms.”

Green Dragon Beast King’s tongue slithered out, licking his lips as his feverish gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong, “Little runt, everyone is saying that you obtained a huge divine grade spirit stone treasure. Obediently take it out, or do you perhaps want us to do it?”

Huang Xiaolong sneered. All of a sudden, his figure disappeared and arrived in front of Green Dragon Beast King almost instantaneously. He then struck out with a palm attack.

Green Dragon Beast King was enraged at Huang Xiaolong, who was so presumptuous to attack him. His palm struck out to meet the incoming attack. Demonic qi soared to the sky, forming a giant green flood dragon in the air.

However, what happened next made Ancestor Mountaingoat and the others’ jaws drop to the ground. That giant green flood dragon was disintegrated by Huang Xiaolong’s palm force, but Huang Xiaolong’s attack did not end there. It continued on, landing on Green Dragon Beast King’s chest.

Green Dragon Beast King’s face paled. In the next second, his body made a high arch in the air and a glaring black palm print could be seen on his chest when he crashed to the ground, formed from frigid Asura Qi. Faint howls of Asuras could be heard coming from back palm print. In that brief moment, the torn flesh and blood started flowing out from the black palm print.

The Green Dragon Beast King’s three companions sucked in a breath of cold air.

In terms of physical defense, Green Dragon Beast King was the strongest amongst the four of them, each one of his scales was strengthened by godforce, comparable to an ancient divine armor. Even the three of them would be hard-pressed to break through Green Dragon Beast King’s scales, but now, Huang Xiaolong’s single palm strike had easily defeated his scale armor and sent him flying?

After Huang Xiaolong sent the Green Dragon Beast King flying with a strike, his figure flickered, aiming his next attack at Ancestor Mountaingoat and the rest.

Ancestor Mountaingoat and his companions were jolted to their senses watching this and leaped forward to attack Huang Xiaolong in fury.

The black and blue twin dragon martial spirits flew out and Huang Xiaolong instantly soul transformed. In a split second, a thousand arms fanned out from his back.

Godly Xumi Art!

‘I’ll kick you while you’re down!’

Huang Xiaolong had to seize this chance and kill while the four old monsters were wounded by the backlash in order to avoid unfavorable mishaps.

Before one could blink, a hundred thousand divine dragons flew out, their roars shaking the heavens.

The Fifteenth Move of the Dragon God, Unrivaled Myriad Dragons! This was his most powerful attack.

Ancestor Mountaingoat, Piercing Sky beast King, and Ancestor Bifang froze from fear watching this giant army of one hundred thousand divine dragons engulf them.

Just like the previous Green Dragon Beast King, the three of them were knocked into the air, crashing heavily to the ground. Their armors shattered into pieces and grotesque wounds overflowing with blood could be seen on their bodies. Still, they coughed up even more blood from the strong impact with the ground.

Huang Xiaolong approached the four old monsters in large strides.

“You!” Piercing Sky Beast King and his companions were finally scared. Not one of them ever imagined that Huang Xiaolong, a mere perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm master was strong to this extent!

By now, they realized that Huang Xiaolong’s strength wasn’t much weaker compared to them at their peak, it could even be said to be on par with them.

‘This, how is this possible?!’

Great waves of shock struck their hearts, unable to accept this truth.

A suction force came from Huang Xiaolong’s hand and a spatial ring fell into his palm. It was undoubtedly the Piercing Sky Beast King’s spatial ring.

Seeing his spatial ring being taken away, the Piercing Sky Beast was furious and agitated, “Huang Xiaolong, you dare!”

Dare? Huang Xiaolong sneered audibly as the force from his right hand pulled the Piercing Sky Beast King right up to him. Purple light flashed in his pupils and a purple ‘soul’ (魂) character flew out from his eyes, entering the Piercing Sky Beast King’s mind.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother to ask what other uses the beast skin treasure map had, hence he directly searched through the Piercing Sky Beast King’s memories.

In truth, with the Piercing Sky Beast King’s Third Order Highgod Realm strength, his soul force was extremely powerful. If it was any other God Realm who tried to scour his mind, they would immediately suffer a backlash. However, Huang Xiaolong’s soul force wasn’t any weaker than a Third order Highgod Realm master’s. In fact, his soul force was slightly stronger than the Piercing Sky Beast King’s, he wasn’t afraid of any backlash.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong discovered the purpose of the treasure map from the Piercing Sky Beast King’s memories.

“The central formation.” Huang Xiaolong repeated under his breath.

There was a central formation inside the Heavenly God’s cultivation dwelling. As long as he could control it, Huang Xiaolong would be able to control the whole Heavenly Mountain and the Heavenly God’s cultivation dwelling. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He inhaled deeply, this was truly a surprise!

If he became the owner of the Heavenly Mountain, with this Heavenly God’s divine artifact in his possession, would a mere Xiang Mingzhi’s be a match for him? At that time, killing him would be as easy as killing a dog!
