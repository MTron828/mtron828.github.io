Chapter 3507: You Can Have Them All

 

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang looked at the devil dragons below them and felt their skulls going numb. Even a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage would feel their legs going soft with so many devil dragons glaring at them.

“Big brother, there’s no need to be afraid!” The little dragon giggled when he saw the cautious looks on their faces. “They are really obedient!” 

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang could only reveal bitter smiles when they looked at the little dragon. He was probably the only person in the universe who could say that the devil dragons were obedient. After all, the devil dragons in the Dragon’s Impasse were ranked as one of the most dangerous and ferocious creatures in all the universes!

“They won’t move without my order!” A grin formed on the little dragon’s face as he declared happily.

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang felt their hearts thumping in their chests.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The two of them didn’t say a word as they followed the little baby dragon. Despite their silence, the little dragon was extremely talkative. Even though he didn’t stop talking, the two of them weren’t annoyed at all! In fact, they found the baby dragon’s voice extremely soothing.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover that the little dragon’s voice contained the grand dao of the universe!

As the three of them approached the core region of the mysterious region, Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang realized that it was larger than they could ever imagine! They hadn’t arrived after three hours of flight!

The three of them might not have been moving quickly, but they were much faster than any ordinary Gods of Creation. 

“Where are you bringing us?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

“We’re going to my home!” The little dragon jumped in joy and looked at the two of them in excitement.

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang looked at each other in shock.

“Your home?” Ao Guang felt his heart pounding in his chest.

The little dragon nodded and said seriously, “Of course! Where else are you going to find Star Dragon Scales? Have you seen Star Dragon Scales anywhere else?” 

Beads of cold sweat formed on their foreheads.

The two of them had long since guessed the little dragon’s identity, but they could finally verify their guesses.

“It isn’t nice to visit your home on such short notice, right? Will your parents welcome us?” Ao Guang asked in a weak voice.

When they thought of the dragons who could give birth to such a terrifying existence, even someone like Ao Guang felt terror sprouting in his heart. His knees threatened to give way.

In fact, even if experts at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm were to think about the little dragon’s origins, they wouldn’t feel too good.

The little baby dragon giggled in amusement. “Relax, there’s nothing to be afraid of! They’re not home! Moreover, they won’t eat my friends!”

Ao Guang nearly fell to the ground when he heard what the little dragon said.

A bitter smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

After flying for another hour, they finally arrived.

The scene before them struck the two Gods of Creation speechless. The little dragon brought them to a giant Star Dragon Rock!

It was a piece of Star Dragon Rock the size of a supercontinent!

If they were to count the value of the Star Dragon Rock alone, it would be worth a staggering amount! In fact, it would be a priceless treasure! Existences at the peak of the God of Creation Realm would wage war over an item like that!

Star dragon qi hovered above the surface of the Star Dragon Rock, and they seemed to form tiny little dragons that swam in the skies.

Palaces sat on the giant continent, and all of them were made from the highest-level ore in the Star Dragon Universe! They were crafted with the best alloys and dragon essence found among the lands!

The palaces were fused directly into the Star Dragon Rock, and Huang Xiaolong could identify the restrictions around the palaces with a single glance. He could tell that they were at a terrifying level.

“We’re here!” The little dragon pointed at the giant rock and flew towards it.

“Your Highness?” Ao Guang started to hesitate.

If the little dragon wanted to act against them, they wouldn’t be able to do a thing once they entered the range of the restrictions around the palaces.

Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Let’s enter.” 

After all, fortune favored the bold!

Huang Xiaolong could tell that the little dragon didn’t harbor any bad thoughts, and if he did, he would have ordered the devil dragons to deal with the two before they arrived.

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang realized that the Star Dragon Stone Palace was a world of its own! They couldn’t see its intricacies when they were outside, but everything changed the moment they stepped foot inside.

“This Dragon Palace is perfect!” Ao Guang muttered to himself.

Every single inch of the palace was made to perfection.

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang were experts at the God of Creation Realm, and they were extremely adept when it came to refining artifacts. However, they were mere amateurs compared to the people who made the Star Dragon Palace.

Huang Xiaolong saw the look on Ao Guang’s face, and he shook his head silently. He couldn’t blame the man for being dumbfounded. After all, the palace was indeed perfect.

“My mother personally crafted the palace!” The little dragon grinned. “It’s pretty, right?” 

Ao Guang nodded his head subconsciously. “It’s perfect. I’ve never seen such an amazing structure…”

The little dragon continued, “If you want to learn, I can allow you to stay here for a little while because you’re related to my big brother over here!” 

Ao Guang stared at Huang Xiaolong silently. It was indeed a tempting offer.

“When is your mother coming back?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“I have no idea…” The little dragon’s face fell when he thought of his parents. “They’re out all the time, and they left me here all by myself!” 

A pout formed on his cute little face.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the little dragon silently, but he didn’t know how to comfort him.

After bringing the two of them around, they entered the palaces located in the center of the continent. He pushed the doors open, and a frightening amount of light emerged. Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang felt a stabbing pain in their eyes, and they struggled to open them. When they finally saw the scene in the palace, they were shocked.

They saw a giant space in the middle of the hall, and there were several hundred scales hovering in the hall! The dragon scales were like tiny stars, but there were hidden intricacies inscribed into every single scale. It mesmerized everyone who laid eyes on it.

“Star Dragon Scale!” Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

There were several hundred scales sitting in front of them!

Even though the little dragon said that he had a ton of them, Huang Xiaolong thought that he was exaggerating. He was dazed to see nearly six hundred scales sitting in the space before him.

As for Ao Guang, he was struck silly. He felt his soul leaving his body.

How much money would they get if they sold off every single scale there?!

“Big brother, these are the Star Dragon Scales you’re looking for! You can have all of them if you want.” The little dragon’s words caused Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang’s knees to tremble.
