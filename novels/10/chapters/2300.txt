Chapter 2301: Purple Grandmist Aura

As for the bloodline of the dragon, who was killed, it was hidden somewhere deep in the island.

Since countless years ago, tons of experts had tried to locate the bloodline of the dragon whose heart was refined to form the island. However, none of them had succeeded.

“Dragon bloodline....” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He had a Saint dragon bloodline running through his veins. If he managed to devour the dragon’s bloodline on the island, it would be of immense assistance to his bloodline!

The dragon’s bloodline was the other reason Huang Xiaolong wanted to head over to the island.

The main reason was the purple grandmist aura, followed by the dragon’s bloodline. Yu Dongyuan’s treasures were merely something he would pick up along the way.

Of course, he was rich, but no one hates money. The more, the merrier!

Moreover, there was a little brat who devoured money following him around. If Huang Xiaolong didn’t pick up everything he could along the way, even his deep pockets would just run dry one day!

An origin spiritual pill a day was no small expense!

Huang Xiaolong also knew that the number of treasures left behind by Yu Dongyuan would be of a significant amount. The amount of origin spiritual pills and holy bills he had left behind would definitely be a substantial amount. At the very least, he should be able obtain several hundred million holy bills....

Huang Xiaolong tried his best to locate the dragon’s bloodline on the island by pushing the Myriad Dragon Saint Bloodline in his body.

Too bad for him, he failed to gain the slightest clue even after an entire day of searching.

After searching for an entire day, Huang Xiaolong spotted a valley.

The hidden valley seemed ordinary, but it was where Yu Dongyuan had kept all his treasures.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he scanned his surroundings to ensure that there weren’t any traps around. Making sure that it wasn’t a trap, Huang Xiaolong punched out and tore away all the restrictions set down by Yu Dongyuan. Reaching towards the solid wall in front of him, Huang Xiaolong retrieved a jade bangle. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Despite its tiny appearance, it was a special spatial artifact, and all of Yu Dongyuan’s treasures were hidden in it.

Huang Xiaolong quickly shattered the restriction Yu Dongyuan had placed on it, and he saw mountains upon mountains of spiritual stones. There were origin spiritual herbs scattered inside the artifact’s space, and they were thriving on mountain ranges Yu Dongyuan had torn from the land he had found them in.

There were tons of metal essences, jade stones, and were even several jade bottles lying in the middle of the artifact. As he looked at the bottles, Huang Xiaolong knew that they contained origin spiritual pills.

After looking through them, he realized that they contained rank-three and rank-four origin spiritual pills.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had no use for rank-three origin spiritual pills, he could give them to Feng Tianyu and the subordinates under him. He could even save them to feed the Rainbow Phoenix when it matured.

After tossing the jade bangle into the lightning bead, Huang Xiaolong left the valley and continued to head towards the depths of the island.

Two days later, the purple grandmist aura in his body started to fluctuate violently.

Huh?

A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Purple grandmist aura!

He was right! Purple grandmist aura really existed on the island!

After jumping onto Little Nine, Huang Xiaolong charged towards the location where he felt the qi.

“Father, that’s him! He’s the one who killed Senior Brother Sui Ceng and the others!” A voice rang through the air all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong was no stranger to the voice.

As he turned around, a familiar face greeted him. It was precisely Wu Weiwei of the Revered River Divine Sect.

Huang Xiaolong had allowed her to leave so that she could call her father over. However, he had left Dark Devil Island soon after, and he hadn’t expected for them to look for him in the Dragon Heart Island.

The moment her voice fell, the members of the Revered River Divine Sect tore through the air and arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

Wu Xun, the Hall Master of the Enforcement Hall, was in the lead.

Elder Chen Shaokang and various other experts stood behind him, and even though there were only thirty of them, none of them were weaklings. Even the weakest of them was in the mid-level Venerable Realm.

As a Tenth Order Sovereign, he was nothing but a weak little critter before so many terrifying experts.

“Brat, I bet you didn’t expect to meet us here after killing my beloved disciple!” Chen Shaokang sneered and a vicious smile appeared on his face.

“Hall master, do we capture him?” One of the experts turned to Wu Xun and asked.

Wu Xun stared at Huang Xiaolong and hesitated for a second. “Are you someone from the Holy Gate?”

Initially, he had made guesses on Huang Xiaolong’s identity with his daughter’s description. After all, there weren’t too many people in the world who dared to make a move on the disciples of the Revered River Divine Sect. There was a ninety percent chance the other party was someone from the Holy Gate.

Of course, it was nothing much if the other party was a mere disciple from the Holy Gate. The Jiang Family’s influence in the Holy Gate wasn’t weak at all! With their relationship with the Jiang Family, there wasn’t much he needed to be afraid of.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother wasting time explaining his actions. He retrieved the Holy Prince’s token and tossed it over.

Wu Xun was unwilling to take a second glance at the piece of trash a Tenth Order Sovereign could take out, but he was glad he did. The moment he caught the token, his heart nearly stopped beating. He nearly dropped it, and he thanked his lucky stars that he had caught the token before it fell to the ground.

After seeing the reactions of their hall master, the elders and the other members of the divine sect felt a trace of suspicion flashing through their mind. When they caught sight of the token in his arm, their expression changed.

“Disciple Wu Xun of the Revered River Divine Sect greets Your Highness! Wu Xun didn’t know that Your Highness was in the area, and I hope you would show mercy!” Wu Xun got to his knees in an instant and kowtowed before handing the token back to Huang Xiaolong.

The other elders and experts of the divine sect didn’t dare to remain on their feet as they mirrored Wu Xun’s actions. A flustered expression was plastered on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his token and muttered, “I am Huang Xiaolong of the Holy Gate. I think all of you should have heard of me before.”

Huang Xiaolong!

Wu Xun and the others felt their bodies trembling in fear when they heard his name.

Even though Yu Dongyuan had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was, how could members of the Revered River Divine Sect not know about his identity?!

Huang Xiaolong had killed Huang Zhouping in the past, before killing Holy Prince Yang Rong of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground in the central arena! Next, he had taken over Jiang Tian as the chief disciple of all the Holy Princes. The news had spread like wildfire the moment he had taken over, and almost all the peak-tier families and sects had learned about it.

“Your Highness! We have heard of you! You are the esteemed chief disciple of the Holy Princes and your reputation hangs high in the sky!” Wu Xun nearly stuttered as beads of cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

“You should know how to apologize after offending a Holy Prince, not to mention the chief disciple...?!” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Wu Xun opened his mouth to argue his way out, but he thought against it, and he admitted his mistake. “We sincerely apologize to Your Highness, and we will request for punishment from the Enforcement Hall of the Holy Gate after getting back!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother replying as he left on the back of the Rainbow Phoenix. After he disappeared in the distance, Wu Xun and the others crawled to their feet.

“Father, are we really going to turn ourselves in?” Wu Weiwei couldn’t help but rage.

A chilly light flashed through Chen Shaokang’s eyes. “Hall Master Wu, why don’t we...?” He drew a line across his neck as killing intent burst out from his body.

Wu Xun was no fool. He shook his head resolutely and growled, “Not a chance. If the Holy Gate pursues the matter, we won’t be the only ones going to hell. The entire sect will join us in the netherworld. Your family will also be dragged down in the mess that ensues. Moreover, killing him wouldn’t be easy. Li Wen and the others would have definitely equipped him with tons of escape symbols and protective runes.”
