Chapter 3628 – Treasure in the Limitless Sea!

After suppressing the halberd under the grand formation in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave as he looked at the giant lake.

Even though he had no idea what it was, he knew that it was an extremely precious treasure since the Three Gods Halberd was willing to nourish itself there.

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Sun Moon Furnace. As it trembled violently, the entire lake was sucked into the furnace.

When he was done, Huang Xiaolong continued to stroll about the forest.

If he managed to find something as special as the lake, there might be even more treasures lying about!

A month later, Huang Xiaolong finally emerged from the Bewitchment Forest.

In the month that he was there, Huang Xiaolong managed to find quite a lot of treasures. Places where the Limitless Master and the others didn’t dare to venture into couldn’t stop Huang Xiaolong! With the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong went wherever he liked!

Moreover, he also managed to locate four other half step Universe Gods.

All of them had crossed the 10 billion mark. The strongest of the four reached the 14 billion units mark, and she was called Yu Xiaohong. She was even stronger than Zhou Chi!

Yu Xiaohong was like Zhang Shen. They both hailed from the Zhu Lan Lands.

When Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Bewitchment Forest, he saw the look of panic on the faces of Zheng Shen and the others. They were clearly worried that he would never emerge.

“Lord!” They rushed over to welcome him the moment he appeared.

However, Zheng Shen was shocked when he saw the four people following behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Lord Yu Xiaohong!”

“Lord Qin Wei!”

As the four of them were Gods of Creation who had accumulated more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, none of them were nobodies. The four of them could be said to be extremely famous. Zheng Shen and the others naturally recognized them!

“In the future, all of you will be part of the same group.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

When Zheng Shen and the others heard Huang Xiaolong, they were dumbstruck.

“Alright. Let’s leave the island before talking about this.” Huang Xiaolong said before leading the others towards the exit.

After his adventure around the Bewilderment Island, Huang Xiaolong could be said to be quite familiar with the place. It took him less than three months to emerge.

After a short rest, Huang Xiaolong brough them all towards the depths of the Sleepless Sea.

Along the way, they ran into several strong sea beasts. Their strength were comparable to half step Universe Gods, but they were no match for Yu Xiaohong and the others!

After two short months, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the entrance of the abyss of the Sleepless Sea.

“That’s Saturated Water!”

Zheng Shen pointed towards a ball of liquid and exclaimed.

When everyone looked in the direction he pointed at, they were greeted with the sight of a giant water-like ball.

The liquid looked extremely ordinary, but the faces of everyone changed when they noticed what it actually was. Even Yu Xiaohong couldn’t control her emotions.

As long as one was swallowed by the Saturated Water, even God of Creation Realm experts who had accumulated more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy would be hard pressed to escape. Moreover, the water wasn’t just able to trap somebody. Once they were swallowed, their dao souls would enter an eternal nightmare. They would be like an ordinary drowning mortal, and the feeling was horrifying.

As the ball of Saturated Water had its own consciousness, it was able to detect Huang Xiaolong’s group instantly.

With absurd speed, it shot towards the group.

That was one of the reasons why the ball of water was scary. Not even half step Universe Gods would be able to outrun the ball of liquid.

The presence of weird existences like that was the reason behind the Limitless Master’s reluctance to enter the depths of the Sleepless Sea.

There might be a ton of universe-level spiritual veins in the depths of the Sleepless Sea, but there were also a ton of dangers lying around! Not many people would risk their lives to search for spiritual veins.

“There’s no need to worry.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as the Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand.

With his grand cosmos energy pouring into the weapon, rays of blinding light emerged from the halberd. The ball of liquid was sucked into the halberd without the slightest bit of resistance. In an instant, it disappeared.

“Three… Three Gods Halberd!” Yu Xiaohong and the others exclaimed in shock.

“That’s right. This is the Three Gods Halberd.” With the halberd in hand, Huang Xiaolong could control all forms of water! It didn’t matter if the Saturated Water had spirituality or not!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had only branded the weapon with his soul and hadn’t gained complete control over it, he was more than capable of using its basic functions.

No one expected Huang Xiaolong to solve the problem so quickly.

Gulps could be heard in the surrounding when they noticed the power of the Three Gods Halberd. Was that the true power of a universe treasure?! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After dealing with the Saturated Water, Huang Xiaolong and the rest continued onwards.

They ran into a cluster of green flames before long.

Like the Saturated Water, the cluster of green flames struck fear into the hearts of half step Universe Gods. As long as one was struck by the flames, they wouldn’t be able to get rid of it no matter how hard they tried!

Once again, Huang Xiaolong dealt with the danger. Summoning the four Universe Origin Flames, he devoured the burning cluster.

To others, the cluster of green flames was a terrifying existence. However, it was a great nourishment for the four origin fires.

?!?!?!

“What the f…”

Those standing around him stared in a daze as they didn’t expect him to deal with it so easily.

He brought them along as they continued to adventure around.

They met with weird universe ice storms, thunderstorms, and mudslides. However, all of them were dealt with easily.

As they traveled around the area, Huang Xiaolong collected one spiritual vein after another.

Yu Xiaohong and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong picking universe-level spiritual veins up like cabbages by the side of the street while they fell completely speechless.

Huang Xiaolong flew about the area for an entire month.

“Lord, should we return?” Yu Xiaohong looked at the area around them and suggested.

There might be lots of universe-level spiritual veins in the depths of the Sleepless Sea, but the further they ventured, the more dangerous it became. No one has ever been able to travel all the way into the deepest part of the sea and no one knew what dangers lurked within.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the peaceful region before him and he hesitated for a moment. “Alright. Let’s return for now.”

He decided to return after entering the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

He was still a little hesitant to head deeper with his current strength.

His adventure this time could be said to have yielded an extremely bountiful harvest. He obtained nearly two hundred universe-level spiritual veins and seven of them were top-grade ones.

As such, he brought them back towards the shallower region of the Sleepless Sea.

Along the way, he received a report from Zhou Chi. It was said that a peerless treasure has been born in the depths of the Sleepless Sea. Experts from all over the Limitless Land were charging over without a care in the world.

Even the Limitless Master and Limitless Celestial Emperor had entered!
