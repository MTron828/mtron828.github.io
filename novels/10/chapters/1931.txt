“Kill us, regardless of our identity?” Huang Xiaolong found it funny. “Wait, you’re right! I’ll kill everyone regardless of their identity!” As soon as he spoke, he crushed the disciple in his hand. The head of the lead disciple was pushed all the way into his stomach.

When the other disciples looked at the scene before them, they stared at Huang Xiaolong with their mouths agape. They had never thought that someone would actually kill a disciple of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union!

They eventually reacted, and all of them screamed at Huang Xiaolong in rage. “How dare you! What do you think you’re doing? How dare you kill a disciple of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union?! Are you trying to revolt? This is something that will cause your family’s destruction! Is your Huang Family looking to die?!”

“Revolt? My Huang Family’s destruction?” Huang Xiaolong’s laughter filled the air. “It seems like I’ve been gone for too long.” Even a random disciple of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union had dared to point and scream at the Huang Family. He had even dared to curse their Huang Family!

Huang Xiaolong tossed the disciple’s corpse to the others, and he looked at the thousands of disciples who had surrounded them. “Kill everyone who dares to block my way!”

When his words reached the ears of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s disciples, rage filled their minds.

One of them pointed at Huang Xiaolong and screamed, “Preposterous! Who do you think you are? No one dares to kill the disciples of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union in their plaza! All of you are dead! Dead!!!”

As soon as he spoke, he was sent flying with a single slap.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at him as he made his way to the plaza.

“Take them down!” Another disciple yelled in fury as his killing intent broke through the skies. “Send out the distress signal! Notify all the experts in the union!”

In the next instant, a disciple shot out a message flare.

Huang Xiaolong stared at them, and he didn’t bother to stop them.

Boom!

The flare exploded in the air like beautiful fireworks.

All the experts at the competition venue turned around and stared at the distress signal in shock.

As soon as the flare was ignited, the disciples surrounding Huang Xiaolong charged towards him. It was too bad they were sent flying by a formless wind before they could even touch him.

All of them fell to the ground and vomited copious amounts of blood, dyeing the ground red.

Huang Xiaolong and the rest didn’t care about all the disciples as they continued to make their way towards the union.

Seeing how their fellow disciples were beaten to an inch of death, the others roared before charging towards Huang Xiaolong and the others. No one had ever dared to cause trouble at the Alchemist Grandmaster Union!

“Kill!”

“With Lord Wangu Wudi’s order, we will kill any Huang Family member who steps into the thousand-meter radius of the union!”

More and more disciples charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

A chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and divine lightning descended. All the disciples about to move towards him turned into coal.

It seemed as though Wangu Wudi thoroughly controlled the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. Since that was the case, Huang Xiaolong decided to wash the union in blood! He would cleanse the union with the blood of their disciples!

When people in the plaza saw Huang Xiaolong and the others, they couldn’t help but feel shocked in their hearts.

“It’s the Huang Family! It’s the Huang Family Patriarch, Huang Xiaohai! Why is he here? How dare he bring his men to attack the Alchemist Grandmaster Union?! Is he tired of living?”

“No one has ever attacked the Alchemist Grandmaster Union in the history of the world! Is he trying to become the enemy of everyone under the heavens? Does he really think that the Huang Family has lived long enough? As the patriarch of the Huang Family, Huang Xiaohai is really too stupid...”

Several experts shook their heads as they glared at Huang Xiaohai and his party. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Alchemist Grandmaster Union was the gathering point of all the alchemists under the heavens. If anyone dared to attack the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, they would be the public enemy of all the alchemists! With alchemists present in every single superpower, they would be offending the entire world! Is the Huang Family declaring war against all the world?!

Wangu Wudi, who had completed his refinement of the Nine Tribulations Divine Pill, learned of the matter, and he broke into laughter. He felt that the heavens were helping him when the Huang Family killed their way into the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

“Let’s go. We’ll take a look at Huang Xiaohai’s amazing performance!” Wangu Wudi laughed as he spoke to the patriarchs of the families who had surrendered to him. “Even I, Wangu Wudi, wouldn’t dare to attack the Alchemist Grandmaster Union! The Huang Family is commendable...”

Everyone could hear Wangu Wudi’s sarcastic tone, and they burst into laughter.

The Leng Family Patriarch chuckled, “Those useless dogs of the Huang Family can’t be compared to the Wangu Clan! When it comes to stupidity, I admire Huang Xiaohai...”

Everyone who heard what he said roared with laughter.

“That’s right! The Huang Family has declined! They are nothing compared to the glorious Wangu Clan!”

“When Huang Xiaohai lowers himself to clean Lord Wangu Wudi’s shoes in a minute, Lord Wangu Wudi might allow him to keep his dog life...”

“Nonsense! Even if he licks Lord Wangu Wudi’s shoes, there is no way Lord Wangu Wudi will allow him to live! The Huang Family members will not escape their fate!”

The Leng Family Patriarch gathered the other patriarchs behind Wangu Wudi as they flew towards the plaza. They couldn’t stop laughing at the Huang Family’s miserable fate along the way.

Very quickly, the few of them arrived at the plaza.

They met Huang Xiaolong’s party, who happened to arrive at the same time.

Both groups stopped as they stared at each other.

When Wangu Wudi swept his gaze over Huang Xiaolong and Huang Xiaohai, he couldn’t help but sneer. “It seems like the Ascending Moon Old Man didn’t die.” His lips curled upwards as he continued, “Your life is pretty resilient. Whatever! I’ll play with you again later. Don’t worry. I won’t let you off as I did previously.”

Despite his whole army not being there to back him up, Wangu Wudi felt that it was entirely possible to kill all the present Huang Family members with the help of all the family patriarchs behind him.

The Ascending Moon Old Man sneered, “Wangu Wudi, you’re just a scoundrel b*stard! How can I die when you’re still alive? In a bit, we’ll tear your head off and pee on it! I’ll let you have a taste of my urine...”

Everyone felt a bomb going off in their heads when they heard what he said.

The Leng Family Patriarch yelled in a fit of rage, “Ascending Moon Old Fogey, how dare you scold Lord Wudi?!”

Wangu Wudi raised his arm and stopped the Leng Family Patriarch from going any further. He wasn’t angry in the slightest as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and his group in amusement.

When the two parties confronted each other in the plaza, the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s various elders received their disciples’ reports.

“The Huang Family is looking to die!” Wangu Ruochen, an elder of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, snorted, and he immediately passed down the order, “Gather all the strength we have at our disposal. We’ll take down all the members of the Huang Family right now!”

“Yes, Elder Ruochen!” As soon as his order was passed down, all the experts gathered.

A frown formed on the face of another elder, Sun Man. He felt that things weren’t as simple as they seemed.

“Let’s go! We’re going out to take a look at what is going on!” Sun Man yelled in a low voice.

The rest of the elders nodded as they shot towards the plaza.

Many of the elders who had known Huang Xiaolong were gone by now. But two of the Elders who knew Huang Xiaolong still remained. Sun Man was one of them, and he was the elder with the most authority in the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.
