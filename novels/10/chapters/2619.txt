Chapter 2620: Myriad Origin Race’s Primal Ancestor Grand Dao Art

“Return to Origin, Destruction of the Heaven and Earth!”

Yuan Qianxing clenched his fists and sent two punches towards Huang Xiaolong as his rage peaked.

The Return of the Origin was the Primal Ancestor grand dao art of the Myriad Origin Race, and it was one of the three strongest dao arts!

The world around his fist started to crumble as everything turned to nothingness. Everything returned to the origin, to a time before the formation of the worlds.

The power of the origin was boundless, and the strike contained endless power.

“Hei Luo!” Huang Xiaolong yelled as he threw the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring over. With his years of comprehension, Hei Luo poured the grand dao he had comprehended into the ring and unleashed an ultimate attack.

Devil, corpse, and death qi covered the world as Hei Luo’s strike clashed with Yuan Qianxing’s Return of the Origin.

Boom! Boom! BOOM!

Terrifying explosions rang in the ears of everyone present and the devil qi that was sent out by Hei Luo slowly crumbled. Under the influence of the skill Yuan Qianxing unleashed, everything returned to nothingness.

Yuan Qianxing swept through the sea of corpse and death qi as he arrived before Hei Luo.

With the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring in his hand, Hei Luo met Yuan Qianxing’s attack head-on.

Bang!

It was as though an unstoppable force was met with an immovable object as the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring started to emit cracking sounds.

In the next instant, it shattered into a billion pieces.

Hei Luo’s arm wasn't spared either. Cracks started to form on the surface of his skin as his bone started to shatter. Under Yuan Qianxing’s ultimate move, a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Corpse Puppet was sent flying!

God knew how many mountain peaks Hei Luo blasted apart before crashing into the ground.

Luckily for Hei Luo, Huang Xiaolong had tossed over the dao artifact. Otherwise, his arms would have probably been shattered beyond recognition.

The Return of the Origin successfully proved the horrifying power of those of the Myriad Origin Race. It was no wonder those of the Myriad Origin Race were hailed as those with the highest talent in the Alien Lands. After all, they could draw on the power of the origin! If Yuan Qianxing had been at the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm, his previous strike would have destroyed half of Hei Luo’s body! Too bad he wasn’t a Ninth Heaven True Saint.

After seeing as Hei Luo was defeated even with the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring, Huang Xiaolong finally revealed a trace of seriousness. The speed at which he devoured Yuan Yue increased.

In the blink of an eye, he was done.

His saint godheads started to tremble as rainbow-colored lights started to emerge.

Even so, it wasn’t enough! There was still a little bit before he could successfully evolve them!

Huang Xiaolong turned his gaze to his sixty-second victim, a lady from the Enchantress Race!

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t you dare!” Yao Ji, the young patriarch of the Enchantress Race roared when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s gaze.

The female disciple Huang Xiaolong targeted was precisely the woman he loved the most!

However, he soon caught sight of the sneer on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Why would he show mercy when they had showed up at his doorsteps to enslave him? Was there something wrong with his head? Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he punched a hole through her voluptuous chest.

“NO!” Yao Ji screamed in terror as he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong in a maniacal fashion.

“Huang Xiaolong, you f*cking mongrel! I’m going to kill you!”

“Release Yao Ke’er right now! Release her!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at him as he swung his arm. With a single slap, he sent Yao Ji flying off into the distance.

Blood sprayed from Yao Ji’s lips as Huang Xiaolong returned his enraged stare with a frosty gaze.

From the time the four races had appeared on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak to enslave him, he had already formed a death grudge with all of them. There was no way either party would hold back. They hadn’t planned to leave him a way out in the first place. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong would return the favor to those who showed him no mercy.

Weren’t Yuan Qianxing, Chan Wuwo, and Yao Ji there to kill him? There was no need to show mercy or listen to the pleadings of his enemies. Revealing his bloodthirst once in a while was required anyway!

Other than Yuan Qianxing, Chan Wuwo, and Yao Ji, he would kill everyone present!

After dealing with the flies under the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong set his sights on the actual experts! Zi Yutong, Yuan Wangfeng, and others—all of them were next!

A chilly light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he eyed his new prey.

When they saw how Huang Xiaolong had sent Yao Ji flying with a single wave of his arm, the faces of Yuan Wangfeng, Zi Yutong, and the others changed.

“Sh*t! How can this happen?! How can Huang Xiaolong be so strong?!” Chan Wuwo screamed in fright.

A Second Heaven True Saint could send a Ninth Heaven True Saint like Yao Ji flying with a single wave of the arm!

Moreover, they finally felt that something was wrong. Huang Xiaolong didn’t seem to be devouring them for nothing. It seemed as though he had a special training method!

Finally, Yuan Qianxing’s voice rang in Huang Xiaolong’s ears again, “Return of the Origin, Complete Annihilation!” His fists flew towards Huang XIaolong once again.

With the power granted to him by the origin, Yuan Qianxing’s punch tore through the skies. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s expression fell. It seemed as though he had to reveal the existence of his Inextinguishable Dao Heart. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to withstand the blow!

As soon as he made the decision to reveal his Dao Heart, saint godheads, and twelve high-order Saint Fates, two massive dragons pierced a hole through the Primal Ancestor Grand Formation around the area and shot towards Yuan Qianxing’s fist.

Boom!

After stopping Yuan Qianxing’s Return of the Origin, the two dragons turned to dust.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief when he realized that he didn’t have to reveal one of his trump cards so early on. Long Shengtian made it in time.

Upon stepping into the space above them, a figure slowly materialized.

Yuan Wangfeng, Chan Wuwo, Yao Ji, and the others didn’t know what to do now that the Deputy Mansion Master was there.

Long Shengtian was followed by Feng Jiu, Feitian Longpeng, Yin Zhangguo, and the experts of other races.

Ignoring Long Shengtian, Yuan Qianxing stared at Huang Xiaolong and thought about attacking again. He wanted to cripple Huang Xiaolong with his final attack before he returned, but he finally decided against it.

Long Shengtian’s expression fell when he saw the destruction around him. “Yuan Qianxing, you brought the experts of four races over to kill another disciple of the mansion in broad daylight! Do you think that the rules of the mansion no longer apply to you?! Do you really think that we won’t be able to take away your position as a Mansion Master Candidate?!”

“Fourth Uncle!” Long Zhenyang wanted to explain, but he was sent flying with a single slap from Long Shengtian before he could say anything else. “Shut up! You’re a disgrace!”
