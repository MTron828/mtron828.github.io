Chapter 3148: 6 Elements Perfection

Over three hundred years, the beast’s exhausted cosmos energy had long recovered. In truth, there was a slight improvement in strength as well. Originally, this was something to be happy about, but it couldn’t feel happy at all! Because its little improvement was dog shit compared to Huang Xiaolong’s improvement.

It looked at the unmoving Huang Xiaolong with a sullen face, and it could tell that at this rate, it won’t be long before Huang Xiaolong’s power of radiance entered perfection level!

At that time, Huang Xiaolong would have six absolute powers at perfection level!

Moreover, most of Huang Xiaolong’s absolute powers had already reached a minor completion stage or higher. With his three small worlds’ cosmos energy on top of those, along with the Huang Long Armor, and Huang Long Twin Blades, Huang Xiaolong’s strength was no less than the beast.

Even after leaving the Origin Sea, the beast wouldn’t be strong enough to suppress Huang Xiaolong as it had thought before.

It really couldn’t understand how the h*ll Huang Xiaolong cultivated. From the time Huang Xiaolong had arrived at the supercontinent until now, it had been less than five hundred years. At that time, Huang Xiaolong merely comprehended eleven elements of absolute powers. Now, not only Huang Xiaolong had comprehended the power of time and space, his minor completion power of radiance had already reached the peak of major completion!

Even Huang Xiaolong’s power of darkness, metal, wind, and earth, all four had gone beyond minor completion!

This really is…

The beast had to admit to itself that its progress was not as big as Huang Xiaolong despite the amount of time it had spent cultivating under the Tree of Origin.

Since the beast had been cultivating under the Tree of Origin for a million years, perhaps, its power of wind and earth could have definitely reached minor completion, but there was almost no way for it to cultivate its power of metal, and darkness to minor completion!

It was certainly impossible for it to comprehend the power of space and time in a mere one million years. If the power of time and space were so easy to comprehend, there wouldn’t be so few people in the Huang Long World that could wield the two powers.

Is the Huang Long Bloodline so heaven-defying? Its eyes burned with inexplicable light.

……

Time flowed by.

Huang Xioalong retreated out from his cultivation in a good mood.

When Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, the surging energy all around dissipated abruptly, as if everything in the world stopped for a split second.

“Minor completion power of time!” The beast approached Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression, and in the bottom of its eyes was intense jealousy and hatred.

Only power of time that had reached minor completion possessed this level of power, stopping the time of surging energy in this Origin Sea.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the beast and asked, “How long have I been cultivating?”

He had disappeared into heaven and earth, transforming into the Tree of Origin, and witnessed the origin of Huang Long World. Huang Xiaolong felt like it had happened yesterday, and he had no idea how long he had been cultivating.

“Over a thousand years!” The beast answered, “More precisely, it’s one thousand and two hundred years, plus some.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

One thousand two hundred years plus!

That’s right, Huang Xiaolong had been comprehending for over one thousand two hundred years.

During these one thousand and two hundred years, Huang Xiaolong’s power of radiance had advanced to a perfection level! On top of that, his power of darkness had reached the peak of major completion.

Both the power of time and space had reached the minor completion stage!

“One thousand two hundred years?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “So long already?” As he spoke, he activated all thirteen elements’ energies. After sensing the levels of these energies, he muttered to himself, “Progress is still a bit slow.”

Hearing that, the beast nearly fainted on the spot from vexation.

Could it be considered slow?! Huang Xiaolong had merely been cultivating slightly over a thousand years.

The beast didn’t even have such a result cultivating under the Tree of Origin for a thousand years.

Both of his powers of time and space reached minor completion within a thousand years. How can this be considered as slow?! The beast couldn’t help but curse inwardly.

“It’s a pity that the power of darkness is still a bit short.” The beast heard Huang Xiaolong muttering again.

If Huang Xiaolong’s power of darkness could reach perfection level, then he would have seven elements at perfection level, and at that time, he really wouldn’t need to fear the behemoth beast.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the beast again, saying, “I’ve been cultivating for so long, so, why don’t we spar some?”

The beast’s expression stiffened as it shook its head. “We have a lot of time to spar in the future, and we’ll talk about it then.”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong stood up, agreeing, “Alright, we’ll talk about it later. Let’s leave this place.”

The beast was inwardly delighted when it heard that.

It was really afraid that Huang Xiaolong would want to stay there and cultivate for several hundred thousand years. With Huang Xiaolong’s talent, if that were to happen, it would never have the chance to suppress Huang Xiaolong in the future.

Before that, Huang Xiaolong used his Huang Long blood essence to refine the supercontinent. With his current strength, Huang Xiaolong completely refined the entire supercontinent in half an hour, and then with a single thought, he moved the entire supercontinent with the Tree of Origin into the Sun Moon Furnace.

The beast watched with its mouth agape. It had never occured to the beast that Huang Xiaolong would be taking away the supercontinent and Tree of Origin in this manner. In the countless years it had been there, it had tried many methods to take away the Tree of Origin, but all its methods couldn’t even move the supercontinent and the Tree of Origin by an inch.

Yet Huang Xiaolong had merely used a few drops of blood essence and half an hour’s time!

“Again the Huang Long Bloodline!” Burning greed flickered across its eyes.

“Let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong said as if he did not notice the greed in the beast’s eyes, and sped away, traversing over a hundred million miles in almost instantaneously. He tried using the power of space and as expected, his speed was many times faster.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong could only fly to cross a hundred million miles in this environment, but after comprehending the power of space, within a certain degree, he was the monarch, being able to compact space and shorten distances.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder and the beast was following right behind him with ease. The beast had achieved major completion in the power of space, and in terms of speed, Huang Xiaolong would still lose to it.

‘When can my power of time and space reach the major completion stage…’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

However, Huang Xiaolong was aware that it wasn’t so easy to cultivate the power of time and space to the major completion stage, as it was harder than advancing to the minor completion stage!

He had spent over a thousand years to cultivate his power of time and space to the minor completion stage, but both powers might not even reach major completion in a hundred thousand years.

Perfection level was further than the major completion stage.

Unless he could find more Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle, with the Tree of Origin in his hands, and if he had more of the two items to aid his cultivation, he could definitely reap twice the result with half the effort. Both powers could reach major completion in less than a hundred thousand years, maybe even just twenty or thirty thousand years.

But where was he going to find so many Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistles? Huang Xiaolong shook his head as the question emerged in his head.

Flip the whole Huang Long World upside down, and he might still not find enough Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle he needed.

Slightly over a month later, Huang Xiaolong and the beast finally appeared outside the Origin Sea. When Huang Xiaolong had entered, he had spent more than twenty years flying, and now, the distance was merely a matter of a month or so.

“What? You want to fight?” Upon coming out, Huang Xiaolong asked nonchalantly when he sensed the split second of abrupt energy surging from the beast’s body.
