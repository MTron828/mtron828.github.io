Chapter 2564: Force Huang Xiaolong to Agree

Listening to Fu Yunjie’s words that were overflowing with resentment, Huang Xiaolong’s response was less than tepid, “That might be, but my ending will never be as miserable as yours. Instead, my path will be filled with colors and wonders, glory and joy, something you will never experience!”

Fu Yunjie laughed hysterically, and just as he wanted to say more, Huang Xiaolong flattened him to the ground with a palm strike. In a split second, Fu Yunjie’s body exploded, and blood and flesh splattered over the floor like rain.

Huang Xiaolong left Fan Xia to be resolved by Di Huai.

After Di Huai vented the hatred in his heart through repeatedly torturing Fan Xia, Huang Xiaolong finally devoured Fan Xia’s holy soul.

As for Xie Yao, Lin Yijia, Chen Kai, and other holy princes, who had supported the wrongdoings were dealt by the Holy Heavens’ Grand Hall Master Wu Ge personally, without having Huang Xiaolong to appear. He appointed Xie Yao, Lin Yijia, Chen Kai, and the rest to positions without any real power, yet they had to do the hardest of work.

A month soon went by.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong spent his days with Feng Tianyu, Di Huai, Zhang Wenyue, and the others, walking around the city or other places, while at night, he continued to consume Star Transferring Holy Pills and cultivate.

Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged inside the Blue Dragon Manor’s secret chamber, as his three holy souls breathed in and out, as three enormous rivers of holy spiritual qi roiled down from the Holy World’s void into his three complete dao saint godheads, strengthening his flesh. At the same time, the Holy World’s core’s grand dao energy surged into Huang Xiaolong’s Inextinguishable Dao Heart, flowing to other parts of his body, tempering his physique.

The Holy Mandate Imprint between his eyebrows emitted bright rays of light, greatly increasing the absorption speed of Huang Xiaolong’s holy spiritual qi and grand dao energy.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded by flickering holy spiritual qi, and vigorous roiling grand dao energy.

If a high-level True Saint expert was here witnessing the rich holy spiritual qi around Huang Xiaolong, he would be astounded twice over because even high-level True Saints weren’t as fast as Huang Xiaolong in absorbing holy spiritual qi. Not to mention, the holy spiritual qi Huang Xiaolong absorbed was golden in color, and it was rare and of the highest quality.

Huang Xiaolong was refreshed all over after a month's cultivation, brimming with endless energy. Grand dao energy churned in his Inextinguishable Dao Heart, inexhaustibly.

Huuu!

The Holy Heavens City’s holy spiritual qi rippled in sync to the rhythm of Huang Xiaolong inhaling and exhaling.

However, the changes to the Holy Heavens City’s surrounding holy spiritual qi could only be detected by experts like Wu Ge.

And because of this, Wu Ge’s respect towards Huang Xiaolong deepened every time he saw him.

Every time he stood in front of Huang Xiaolong, Wu Ge had a feeling that he was standing in front of a giant origin beast. This kind of feeling was the same when he faced the four Primal Ancestors.

By Integrating with twelve high-order Saint Fates, and forming the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, Huang Xiaolong who was merely a late-First Heaven True Saint, had already stepped into the circle of Holy World’s top experts!

The moon shone brightly in the starless sky.

Huang Xiaolong stood alone in the courtyard, combing through his thoughts.

After the celebration ceremony was completed, he planned to head to the ancient battlefield to look for the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance.

‘I can probably break through to Second Heaven True Saint…?’ Huang Xiaolong wondered inwardly.

Currently, his cultivation realm was at late-First Heaven True Saint, but if he succeeded in obtaining the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, then he had a high chance of breaking through to Second Heaven True Saint.

Another half a month went by, and it was getting closer to the day of the ceremony.

There was one more month until the ceremony, and on this day, Huang Xiaolong suddenly got a message from the Heavenly Master. When he read the content, his face darkened.

“Something happened to Xiaoying’s group!” According to the Heavenly Master’s message, Lin Xiaoying, Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and others were ambushed by the Devil Palace’s Qiao Jinyang’s group on their way over to participate in the celebration ceremony.

The Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, and Elder Crow were rushing over right now.

“Nearby the Poison Shadow Holy Ground!” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he rushed out.

Although the Poison Shadow Holy Ground was close to the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, it would still take the four Primal Ancestors two to three days to reach there. The Cangqiong Dao Palace would only take more time, by the time Huang Xiaolong reached there, everything would have been too late.

Qiao Jinyang, Cao Nan, and Gu Tian have all come out, and Xue Lingyun wouldn’t be able to fend them off for long.

What to do?

Huang Xiaolong was like an ant on a burning pan.

“Devil Palace!” A fierce light flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Devil Palace was challenging his bottom line. One of these days, he was going to pull the Devil Palace up by the root, and even if he failed to kill Qiao Jinyang, Cao Nan, and Gu Tian, he needed to absolutely suppress and seal them off eternity!

While Huang Xiaolong was feeling anxious, exuding a murderous aura from head to toe, he received another message from the Heavenly Master. Huang Xiaolong heaved in relief after reading it. When Xue Lingyun, Lin Xiaoying, and others were in danger, coincidentally, Mo Cangli was in the vicinity. He and his group rushed over, so now, Xue Lingyun had Mo Cangli’s help to fend off Qiao Jinyang, Cao Nan, and Gu Tian.

Although Xue Lingyun and Mo Cangli’s strength could barely resist the three Devil Palace’s Palace Masters, the situation was better than before. At least, they could hold on until the four Primal Ancestors arrived.

Still, Huang Xiaolong was worried. In the end, he decided to rush over in the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

As Huang Xiaolong was rushing over, he was relieved to learn that the four Primal Ancestors had arrived at the scene, and the Clear Snow Palace’s entourage was safe.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived and saw Lin Xiaoying, as well as the others, Qiao Jinyang, Can Nan, and Gu Tian were glowering at them from high air despite their sorry state.

The moment the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, and Elder Crow joined the battle, the three of them were overwhelmed and could only make a run for it.

“DAMN!” Qiao Jinyang’s eyes exuded terrifying coldness, while his heart raced.

“It’s Mo Cangli time and again!” Cao Nan’s face was distorted due to the plan’s failure. They were that close to succeeding, but who would’ve thought that Mo Cangli would suddenly appear and smash their plans.

“Shouldn’t the Holy Lands Alliance’s group be at the Heavenly Demon Holy Ground?” Qiao Jinyang coldly questioned.

They had investigated these details before making their move. The Holy Lands Alliance was supposed to be passing by the Heavenly Demon Holy Ground at this time as they made their way to participate in the Holy Heaven’s ceremony. It was a long way from the Poison Shadow Holy Ground.

Gu Tian answered sullenly, “The Holy Lands Alliance’s people are indeed at the Heavenly Demon Holy Ground, Mo Cangli probably wasn’t with the big group.”

“That Mo Cangli keeps ruining our plans!” An icy glint gleamed in Cao Nan’s eyes, “We might as well annihilate the Holy Lands Alliance!”

Qiao Jinyang was silent for a moment then spoke, “There are many holy grounds and ancient races that are attending the Holy Heavens’ ceremony, and we’ll pick a hundred of them randomly and destroy these forces!”

Both Cao Nan and Gu Tian blanked for a second.

“You mean?” There was confusion in Gu Tian’s eyes.

Qiao Jinyang went on, “After destroying these one hundred holy grounds, send a message to Huang Xiaolong that if he doesn’t agree to our condition, we’ll continue to destroy the next batch of one hundred holy grounds. If Huang Xiaolong still doesn't agree, we’ll destroy until he agrees!”

“At the appropriate time, we’ll announce the list of one hundred holy grounds!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Cao Nan and Gu Tian’s eyes lit up with excitement.

They understood Qiao Jinyang was planning to manipulate these holy grounds’ fear and panic when they announced the list of holy grounds they were going to get destroyed. They were going to let these holy grounds go beg Huang Xiaolong to agree with the Devil Palace’s condition.

Even other holy grounds and ancient races might request Huang Xiaolong to agree just because they might be the next one on the list. Under such pressure, Huang Xiaolong would have no choice but to relent.
