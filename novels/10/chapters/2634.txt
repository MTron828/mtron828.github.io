Chapter 2635: Suppress Huang Xiaolong?

After Yuan Qianxing received the news, his complexion darkened. “Another Primal Ancestor?! How can there be another Primal Ancestor protecting Huang Xiaolong other than the corpse puppet?!”

“For someone to threaten Chan Yuli… The other party has to be a late-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor!” Yuan Wangfeng turned serious as he estimated.

However, a sneer soon formed on Yuan Qianxing’s face. “Whatever! It doesn’t matter even if he manages to find another Primal Ancestor to protect him! When I become the Mansion Master’s successor in twenty years, he’ll be dead all the same!”

“Your Highness is correct!” Yuan Wangfeng heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Since he saved Feitian Longpeng, they should be on their way to the Flying Heaven Race. They should be holding their sacrificial ritual soon, and Feitian Longpeng is definitely heading back to participate!”

“Flying Heaven City…”

“It’s possible!” Yuan Wangfeng thought about it before drawing a finger across his neck, “We can borrow the power of the Flying Heaven Race to lure Huang Xiaolong over to…”

“We have to be able to bring out enough to move the Flying Heaven Race…” Yuan Qianxing shook his head. “Fei Yanzi will definitely not move easily.”

After all, Huang Xiaolong was a Mansion Master Candidate and had a Primal Ancestor Realm bodyguard. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The Flying Heaven Race wouldn’t dare to move against him easily.

As such, the only things that could push Fei Yanzi to action would be a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact. However, Yuan Qianxing wouldn’t be able to bring that out! Even with his status and identity, he didn’t have a dao artifact of his own!

“We might be able to get rid of Huang Xiaolong even if Fei Yanzi doesn’t move,” Yuan Wangfeng leaned in and whispered something into Yuan Qianxing’s ear.

A satisfied smile appeared on Yuan Qianxing’s face as he nodded his head in approval. “Alright! We shall do as you say! Contact the doyens of the Flying Heaven Race!”

If they could kill Huang Xiaolong right now, it would be for the best. After all, something might go wrong in twenty years.

“Your Highness, leave it to me.”

…

Another three years passed in the blink of an eye, and Huang Xiaolong had been cultivating non-stop in the Flying Heaven Holy Ship.

The number of times he left his cultivation room could be counted on one hand, and after three years of cultivation, he finally solidified the foundations of his saint godheads. With his Xuanhuang Supreme Dragon Saint Godhead, Nefarious Origin Saint Godhead, and his Great Immemorial Saint Godhead, the speed at which he devoured holy spiritual energy increased by more than ten times!

With his speed, he would be able to enter the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm without the assistance of the Flying Heaven’s hidden treasury!

He would smash through his previous estimation and enter the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm before the battle to become the Mansion Master’s successor!

That was the horrifying difference of possessing saint godheads in the top ten ranks!

In the past, Huang Xiaolong knew that there was barely any hope of him entering the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm before fighting for the position of the successor. That was the reason he had planned to obtain the Flying Heaven Hidden Treasury. With the transformation of his godheads, he was more than seventy percent sure he would be able to break through before the battle!

Of course, if he managed to obtain the Flying Heaven Hidden Treasury, he would become a hundred percent sure.

After he returned to his cultivation, the days passed as usual.

One fine day, Feitian Longpeng and three Eminent Elders appeared to inform Huang Xiaolong that they had entered the Flying Heaven Domain. In half a month, they would be able to enter the headquarters of the Flying Heaven Race.

“Your Highness, our patriarch has emerged from seclusion to welcome you,” one of the Eminent Elders laughed.

After three years of interaction with Huang Xiaolong, their impression of him had improved by quite a bit.

Of course, they weren’t being overly courteous with Huang Xiaolong. It was true that Fei Yanzi had emerged from seclusion in order to welcome Huang Xiaolong.

If Huang Xiaolong was a mere candidate for the position of the Mansion Master, there was no way a Primal Ancestor Realm patriarch like Fei Yanzi would appear personally to greet him. However, Huang Xiaolong was no mere candidate.

An indifferent expression remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard of Fei Yanzi’s actions. He wasn’t even slightly surprised that Fei Yanzi would appear to greet him.

“You should tell your atriarch about the matter with the hidden treasury.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Feitian Longpeng.

None of those on the ship had dared to speak about the matter with their patriarch before they returned. However, now that Huang Xiaolong had given them the instruction, they were able to heave a sigh of relief and relay his intentions.

“Yes, Your Highness!”

Half a day later, the doyens of the Flying Heaven Race gathered together in the main hall of their headquarters.

“I wonder why the Patriarch gathered us here…?” one of the Eminent Elders, Feitian Hao, frowned as he asked the others.

“It definitely has something to do with Huang Xiaolong’s arrival.” Feitian Cheng, another Eminent Elder, frowned. “From what I see, His Highness Yuan Qianxing is definitely going to become the successor of the Mansion Master! Huang Xiaolong is going to die either way! If His Highness hears of our intentions to welcome Huang Xiaolong with a banquet, how do you think this will end?”

“That’s right!” Feitian Jin sneered. “We should lay down the Flying Heaven Grand Formation to capture Huang Xiaolong the moment he arrives! After handing him over to His Highness Yuan Qianxing, we will be able to gain a lot of merits!”

“Yeah! Even if he has a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor to protect him, no one can save him if he’s trapped in the Flying Heaven Grand Formation!”

The Eminent Elders of the Flying Heaven Race nodded in approval.

Other than three doyens who refused to carry out the plan, more than thirty of them agreed to lay down the Flying Heaven Grand Formation to capture Huang Xiaolong.

“Are you stupid?” a majestic voice rang through the hall, and an absolute beauty sashayed into the hall.

The Eminent Elders got to their feet instantly to welcome her. “We greet the Matriarch!”

It was clear that the beauty was Fei Yanzi, the matriarch of the Flying Heaven Race. She was wearing court attire, and her beauty eclipsed everything in the hall. She was the daughter of the previous patriarch, and she was one of the two female Primal Ancestors in the Alien Lands.

She only allowed them to rise after she took her seat in the middle of the hall.

“Huang Xiaolong saved dozens of experts of our Flying Heaven Race, including the young patriarch! He’s a benefactor of our race, and I refuse to hear any more ideas of trying to capture him with the Flying Heaven Grand Formation!” Her cold gaze swept through the hall.

The Eminent Elders could only lower their heads in resignation.

“I gathered you here not only to speak of Huang Xiaolong’s arrival, but I have another piece of good news to tell you guys.” Fei Yanzi continued, “Longpeng found traces of the Flying Heaven Blood Stele.”

“What?!”

The hall buzzed with excitement instantly.

“Huang Xiaolong has it.”

The Eminent Elders, who were ready to celebrate, stared at each other as the atmosphere in the hall died in the blink of an eye.

“Matriarch, the Flying Heaven Blood Stele is the inheritance treasure of our race! We can’t allow it to remain in the hands of Huang Xiaolong!” The Eminent Elder, who had suggested suppressing Huang Xiaolong with the Flying Heaven Grand Formation, stood out immediately and yelled.
