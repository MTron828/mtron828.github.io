Chapter 3083: How Dare You Mock Me?!

Feng Yuxuan nearly jumped in fright when she heard what he said. “There’s no need!”

She came to the banquet because of a decision she made when she wasn’t thinking clearly. When she arrived in the city, regret started to set in as she realized that she wouldn’t know what to do if she really met the man.

The Ice Prince and the others felt that her actions were getting weird, but they knew better than to harp on the topic.

Feng Yuxuan quickly made her way through the outer hall and entered the inner hall.

As there were too many people who wanted to attend the banquet, only those who received the invitation from the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce would be able to enter the inner hall. Random Dao Venerables were only allowed to remain in the outer hall and mingle among themselves.

When Feng Yuxuan entered the inner hall, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu barely left their courtyard.

Of course, it took a mere ten minutes for them to arrive.

“Benefactor!” When Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu were making their way over, a passionate cry rang out behind them. When Huang Xiaolong turned around, he noticed a group of experts from the Carefree Creed following behind a middle-aged man.

“Benefactor, what a coincidence!” Xu Shuang rushed up and introduced them. “Benefactor, this is my master, the Carefree Dao Venerable.”

Cupping his fists, Sun Shanglong chuckled, “Many thanks for saving my disciples. Sun Shanglong never forgot the favor, and I didn’t expect to meet you here.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the man, and he chuckled. “There’s no need for formalities. It’s nothing!” After he spoke, he continued on his way with Lei Yu.

Sun Shanglong was stunned when he realized that Huang Xiaolong was ignoring him. “I wonder which hall master or eminent elder young master is familiar with. I met with Patriarch Chen Ming of the Leiyu Creed several times in the past…”

As the third strongest creed in the Luosheng Heavenly Cave, Chen Ming had to show him a lot of respect if they met.

However, he couldn’t understand why Huang Xiaolong was so impassive when they met. After all, even the patriarch of the Leiyu Creed would have to grovel beneath his feet.

“Are you related to that brat, Chen Ming?!” Lei Yu spoke all of a sudden.

Sun Shanglong couldn’t help but stare in shock when he heard how Lei Yu addressed Chen Ming. After all, when he was talking to Huang Xiaolong previously, he didn’t expect his mount to interrupt him. “I wonder what relationship you have with Patriarch Chen Ming?”

“Hehe.” Lei Yu didn’t bother replying as they continued on their way.

Sun Shanglong felt a trace of rage rising in his heart when he saw how the pair was ignoring him.

It didn’t matter if Huang Xiaolong walked away from the conversation, but he didn’t expect a mere mount to slight him.

Whatever the case, his evaluation of Huang Xiaolong changed.

After thinking about it, they decided that it was better to try again. Rushing over, Sun Shanglong and Xu Shuang started to bring up the topic of the Purple Lightning Peak once again. When they saw that Huang Xiaolong was pretty accommodating, they couldn’t help but ask, “Young master, are you willing to part with your purple mountain? I have always been thinking about getting a flying ship, but nothing on the market seems suitable.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled when he realized that Sun Shanglong was finally unable to control himself. “You can’t afford it.”

“Young Master Huang, do you mean that I’ll be able to buy it if I give you enough money?”

“Of course!”

“I wonder how much your purple mountain is worth?” Sun Shanglong smiled casually. “My Carefree Creed might not be a super chamber of commerce, but we should be able to take out quite a substantial amount.”

It was no wonder he was so confident. In the past, he had managed to obtain an ancient inheritance that contained some pretty good stuff. He had sold it to the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce for quite a fortune.

Looking at Sun Shanglong whose ego was puffed up because he thought he was rich, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “In the Sea of Skulls, Su Hong of the Heaven Seizing Chamber of Commerce offered a hundred billion dao coins for it.”

“One… One hundred billion?!”

He had earned quite a bit when he had sold the inheritance away, and he was more than capable of taking out several billions. A hundred billion was something he would never be able to bring out no matter how hard he tried. Even if he sold away everything he had, he wouldn’t come close to the amount.

Seeing as the purple mountain was still in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, it was clear that he hasn’t accepted the price of a hundred billion.

“Su Hong?! The director of the Heaven Seizing Chamber of Commerce?!” Xu Shuang looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “What a retard. He thinks that he can buy my artifact for several hundred billions… Even the genesis level spiritual stones I used to refine the mountain cost several trillion dao coins…”

“Several… Several trillion dao coins?!” Sun Shanglong and the others jumped in shock.

They couldn’t even begin to imagine the concept of several trillion dao coins!

Even super chambers of commerce at the level of the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce couldn’t take out a trillion dao coins.

Ignoring Sun Shanglong and the others, Huang Xiaolong turned around and left.

“Master, it can’t be true…” Xu Shuang looked at Sun Shanglong and felt his mind buzzing.

Sun Shanglong sneered, “Of course it’s fake. Unless he’s the main pavilion master of the Mystical Pavilion or the world master of our Origin Holy World, he wouldn’t be able to take out several trillion dao coins.” It was clear he didn’t believe Huang Xiaolong at all. Naturally, he was unwilling to believe that Su Hong had offered a hundred billion dao coins to purchase the purple mountain.

In his eyes, Huang Xiaolong was messing with him!

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong’s back, he snorted, “How dare he mock me?!” Even though the Carefree Creed was unable to find a proper footing in the Origin Heavenly Cave, Sun Shanglong wasn’t someone anyone could mess with as they pleased! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As a sinister thought flashed through his mind, Sun Shanglong put on the best smile he had as he continued to follow behind Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong quickly arrived at the hall.

However, a weird voice rang out behind him before he could enter the hall. “Hehe, isn’t this the Carefree Dao Venerable, Sun Shanglong?! Who would have thought that you would be shameless enough to come to the Ice Orchid Banquet?!”

A group of people clad in gold and black robes appeared behind them. Huang Xiaolong quickly realized that they were from the Talisman Refining Creed in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

The Talisman Refining Creed was ranked forty-third in the Origin Heavenly Cave, and their strength was nothing to scoff at. They had the ability to crush some weaker regions outside the Origin Heavenly Cave, and one had to know that the Carefree Creed led by Sun Shanglong wouldn’t be able to climb into the top hundred ranks even if he tried.

“Hall Master Zhang Qin…” Sun Shanglong forced a smile.

The Carefree Creed was a new power in the Origin Heavenly Cave, and their foundations weren’t stable. They had offended several factions when they had tried to find a foothold in the Origin Heavenly Cave, and the Talisman Refining Creed was one of them.

Zhang Qin strolled over, and he casually glanced around. When his eyes turned to stop on Huang Xiaolong, he paused for a second. “Is this a new friend of yours? How can I address him?”

Sun Shanglong’s heart shook and another plan formed in his mind. “This is a good friend of mine, Young Master Huang! He’s attending the banquet with me.”

The look in Zhang Qin’s eyes turned unfriendly all of a sudden when he heard that Huang Xiaolong was Sun Shanglong’s friend.
