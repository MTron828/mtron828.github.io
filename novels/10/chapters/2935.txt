Chapter 2936: What Kind of Bloodline is This?!

However, Zeng Lei narrowed his eyes and smiled, “There is no hurry.” He then collected the genesis level pills and placed them into the jade bottle one by one.

This jade bottle had been carefully crafted by him, and he had used genesis level spiritual jade that he had hidden for years to make it. The medicinal essence of genesis level pills would be contained inside of it, and not only that, but it was also able to nourish it and raise the quality of the medicinal property.

As Huang Xiaolong had combined the nirvana flame and absolute blaze to refine, and adding on the fact that he had used the Sun Moon Furnace, he refined twenty-eight pills, which was eight more than what Zeng Lei had expected.

Originally, he would have been very satisfied with twenty pills as he had only expected Huang Xiaolong to refine at most twenty pills. Now that there were twenty-eight, he was even more excited than before.

Seeing Zeng Lei’s excitement and madness, Huang Xiaolong didn’t move and allowed him to keep the twenty-eight pills properly.

After doing so, Zeng Lei then turned around and smiled sheepishly, “Huang Xiaolong, it is all thanks to you that we could refine genesis level pills!”

“This is what I should do,” Huang Xiaolong calmly replied.

Zeng Lei smiled, “Huang Xiaolong, I won’t beat around the bush with you anymore; hand over the twenty strands of beginning qi you have on you now.”

“Hand over the twenty strands of beginning qi?” Huang Xiaolong feigned ignorance, “Branch Master Zeng Lei, what do you mean?”

Zeng Lei broke out in laughter, “What do I mean? Don’t tell me you don’t know what I mean?! How about you stop feigning ignorance, we are all smart people, and I don’t wish to waste any more words. Hand over the twenty strands of beginning qi on you along with the Shaking Dragon Spear!”

“Moreover, hand over all the blue lotus nectar you have on you now!”

“In addition, I want all the Tuoshen dao coins on you now as well!”

“Basically I want all the treasures you possess that are worth anything!”

Anyway, since the bridge had already been burned, he didn’t need to pretend anymore with Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at Zeng Lei’s hideous look as he was laughing wildly, Huang XIaolong deliberately panicked and shouted angrily at the same time, “Branch Master Zeng Lei you actually broke our agreement? But you swore an oath!”

Zeng Lei laughed madly, “So what if I swore an oath? I didn’t say that I would follow it.” Huang Xiaolong’s face sank, “Zeng Lei, I know that you are a late Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable, and even though I am no match for you, don’t forget the Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable vicious beast behind me. I can simply use it to block your path and escape completely.”

Zeng Lei ridiculed, “Huang Xiaolong, you think that I hadn’t considered this? In this space, I have already laid down the Heavenly Gathering Array, and unless you have a higher combat power than me, it’s impossible for you to break this array. Thus, you can dream about escaping from this place!”

“Moreover, I’m not alone!” Speaking to this point, Zeng Lei shouted in the air, “All of you can come out now and greet Young Master Huang.”

Just as he finished speaking, the twenty-six Dao Venerable experts hiding in the voids suddenly appeared.

When these twenty-six people showed up, they looked at Huang Xiaolong and laughed, with clear mockery in their eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, I bet you didn’t imagine that, other than me, I still have twenty-six Dao Venerable experts here!” Zeng Lei triumphantly said, “They were using a special kind of world artifact that was able to hide their aura, and even ordinary high-level Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to discover them.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the twenty-six of them and said calmly instead, “Oh, is that right?”

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s reaction was a bit strange, Zeng Lei smiled and continued, “Huang Xiaolong, do you want to surrender willingly, or do you want it the hard way? If we capture you and throw you into the Sun Moon Furnace and refine you into a supreme pill, I’m sure the effects would be even better than genesis level pills!”

“I have already prepared all one thousand three different materials. Moreover, most of them are grand dao level and some even genesis level.” Zeng Lei laughed, “It can be considered your fortune to be able to mix with all these spiritual herbs and get refined by me into a pill!”

“Oh, refine someone into a pill? I didn’t think you would have such a method.” Huang Xiaolong grew interested as he asked, “I wonder if it’s able to refine a vicious beast into pills?”

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was able to remain calm, Zeng Lei was startled as he frowned. Could it be that this kid has some special methods up his sleeves?

Could he have a Seventh Order Dao Venerable vicious beast? However, he shook his head as he knew how hard it was to subdue a Seventh Order Dao Venerable beast. Even many Ninth Order Dao Venerable experts were unable to do so, not to mention a Primal Ancestor like Huang Xiaolong.

Now that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to the Dao Venerable realm, if he chose to hide his realm, even a peak late Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable would be unable to see his realm. Thus, it was only normal that Zeng Lei had still thought that he was a Primal Ancestor.

“Huang Xiaolong, stop acting mysterious and trying to fool around! I know you are pretending to be calm now while thinking of a way to escape.” Zeng Lei sneered, “Since that’s the case, I shall take care of you immediately!”

“Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance, you can release your mid-Sixth Esteem vicious beast now.” Zeng Lei’s aura rose, and the twenty-six experts also locked onto Huang Xiaolong.

Under the eyes of Zeng Lei and everyone present, Huang Xiaolong released all the six Dao Venerable vicious beasts from his dragon pearl.

“Six… six of them!” The twenty-six people were astonished.

Seeing the six Dao Venerable vicious beasts, the twenty-six of them and Zeng Lei both received a huge shock. He had never heard of someone being able to subdue six Dao Venerable vicious beasts!

Even the patriarch from the Beast Frontier Creed would at most be able to control three Dao Venerable vicious beasts because controlling even one Dao Venerable vicious beast would require a large amount of dao soul power.

“How did you manage to control six Dao Venerable vicious beasts!” After regaining his senses from the shock, Zeng Lei looked at Huang Xiaolong with fiery eyes. If he was able to obtain the method and have several Dao Venerable vicious beasts beside him, wouldn’t his combat power skyrocket?

Even though he was surprised to see that Huang Xiaolong had controlled six Dao Venerable vicious beasts, he didn’t really take it seriously. After all, out of these six vicious beasts, two of them were Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, and four of them were Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, and it was still possible for the twenty-seven of them to suppress them completely.

“You want to learn the beast controlling art?” Seeing the greed in Zeng Lei’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong laughed indifferently, “I can tell you the method, and as long as you have the same bloodline as me, you can definitely control this many or even more Dao Venerable vicious beasts at once.”

“Bloodline?” Zeng Lei was surprised. What kind of bloodline in the world could possess such an ability?

At this moment, a golden dragon appeared behind Huang Xiaolong, and it was like a giant mountain that had covered the sky. Terrifying heavenly might suffocated Zeng Lei, and at the same time, Huang Xiaolong's body radiated the might of a Dao Venerable.
