Chapter 2410: Embarrassing the Holy Heavens!

The Holy Heavens City was as peaceful as it was, and it was bustling with activity.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sigh when he looked at the prosperous streets in the city. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Everything that had happened during the time he had left, felt like a dream.

Tens of years ago, he had barely stepped into the Holy Heavens City. He was a mere ant along the street that no one would take notice of. However, he was currently the personal disciple of all four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens organization, and he had even managed to enter the half-True Saint Realm! Not to mention the fact that he had managed to form three holy souls!

“Too bad I still have to think of a way to find more holy herbs....” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He still had nearly forty holy herbs in his possession, but he felt that the amount was too little. If Li Chen had forty holy herbs, he would probably be able to enter the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm from Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation. However, Huang Xiaolong had three complete dao saint godheads, three saint bloodlines, and three saint physiques! Breaking through would take way more resources and the amount he needed to enter the next cultivation realm was terrifying!

Even after refining all the herbs he had, he wouldn’t be able to enter the Second Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

As such, Huang Xiaolong’s goal of obtaining a Dao Heart before the opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor could be said to be insane! The amount of holy herbs he needed was an astronomical amount!

“It seems like I’ll need to make a trip down to the Purple Clouds Sea....” He muttered to himself.

The Purple Clouds Sea was like the Profound River. It was a forbidden region in the Holy World, and after scouring the Profound River, Huang Xiaolong knew that the amount of treasures he could find in the Purple Clouds Sea wouldn’t lose out to the Profound River.

Moreover, after obtaining the Black Gold Metal with a trace of grandmist holy spiritual aura, Huang Xiaolong knew that there would definitely be a pocket of grandmist holy spiritual aura located in the Purple Clouds Sea.

To him, grandmist holy spiritual aura was much more effective than ordinary holy herbs.

If he managed to locate four strands of grandmist holy spiritual aura like he had done in the Profound River, breaking through to the Second Tribulation half-True Saint Realm would be a breeze!

“Have you heard, Old Man Cangqiong is back!”

“OId Man Cangqiong? Is that even possible?”

“It’s definitely true. Old Man Cangqiong already made the announcement that only the top three hundred disciples from the Trial of Blood would gain the qualifications to step into the Cangqiong Holy Manor.”

“Top three hundred? What’s the Trial of Blood? Can anyone take part in the trial?”

Sounds of discussions entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears, and he couldn’t help but feel a little curious.

The strongest person in the Holy World had returned to the public eye! After several billion years of absence, he was back!

Moreover, he was planning to host some sort of Trial of Blood! Only the top three hundred disciples would be able to enter the Cangqiong Holy Manor. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but frown. However, those who were talking about his return had no idea what the trial was.

“It seems like I have to ask the four masters about this....”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had no idea what the Trial of Blood was, he knew that it wouldn’t be easy to enter the top three hundred rankings. In the past, the Heavenly Master had told him that as long as he entered the First Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, there would be no dangers in the first level of the Cangqiong Holy Manor. However, it seemed as though First Tribulation half-True Saints might not even get the chance to enter the manor now.

Since the Cangqiong Old Man was holding a Trial of Blood, he definitely had raised the bar for those entering the manor. First Tribulation half-True Saints wouldn’t even be able to fight for the top three hundred spots.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was thinking about the matter, a group of disciples from the Holy Heavens started making their way towards him. Wherever they passed, a huge berth would form on the streets. People would even kneel towards the disciples in the group.

Huang Xiaolong quickly noticed Li Chen and the various Holy Princes of the Holy Heavens the moment he looked at them. Behind the group was a large entourage of disciples, and Fu Yunjie was part of them.

It was evident that Fu Yunjie had managed to catch Li Chen’s eye after entering the Holy Heavens. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to follow behind him. Huang Xiaolong knew that with Fu Yunjie’s slick interpersonal skills, he would definitely be able to gain Li Chen’s favor. Even though he wasn’t Li Chen’s personal assistant, he was in charge of a lot of things.

It went without saying that the reason behind Fu Yunjie’s obedience was because he had already offended Huang Xiaolong. In the Holy Heavens, the only person who could protect him was Li Chen. After all, his master had thoroughly offended Di Huai, who was on Huang Xiaolong’s side. Without Li Chen’s protection, a single order from Huang Xiaolong would be more than enough to get rid of him.

“What a pity...? We didn’t manage to gain a whole lot during our trip to the Profound River this time.”

Eleven years ago, the news of the Black Corpse emerging in the Black Corpse Continent had attracted many experts over to the Profound River. Li Chen, along with the Hall Master of the Law Enforcement Hall had brought a whole group of experts over to the Profound River.

No matter how hard they had tried, they had failed to locate the black corpse. That wasn’t the worst part. They had even sacrificed several disciples when trying to explore the Black Corpse Devil Cave.

After staying for a short amount of time, they had decided to shift their focus to the holy herbs located in the Black Corpse Continent.

No matter how hard they had looked, they had failed to locate even a single holy herb. After obtaining several high-grade origin herbs, they had decided to return to the Holy Heavens.

“Let’s not talk about the matters in the Profound River,” Li Chen muttered. Whenever he thought of the events that had happened in the Profound River, he would feel a sense of irritation. “Who would have thought that the Cangqiong Old Man would return to conduct a Trial of Blood...?”

Light flashed through his eyes when he spoke about the matter.

There was definitely a reason for the Cangqiong Old Man to conduct a trial before the opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

Xie Yao sniggered, “The news about the trial have already started to spread. Many disciples are getting ready to take part in it. Whatever the case, Senior Brother Li should take the first spot in the trials....”

Fu Yunjie pushed his way to the front with a wicked smile on his face and he continued, “With Senior Brother Li Chen’s talent and strength, there is no doubt he would take the top spot! However, shouldn’t we be concerned with Huang Xiaolong?”

In a single sentence, Fu Yunjie managed to change the topic to target his most hated enemy.

Since the time he had started to get close to the Holy Princes, he had been sowing discord every now and then.

Xie Yao sneered. “Huang Xiaolong? He’s probably trying to increase his strength right now. No matter how talented he is, he won’t be able to enter the Cangqiong Holy Manor! Right now, he’s probably in the Seventh Order Venerable Realm. With his strength, he won’t be able to fight for a spot in the top thirty thousand, much less three hundred!”

Initially, he had suspected Huang Xiaolong of cheating during the examination phase. He was slapped by his master, and the seed of hatred was formed.

Fu Yunjie sneered, “Huang Xiaolong is such a disgrace. He can’t even enter the top thirty thousand ranks no matter how hard he trains. Wouldn’t he embarrass our organization when the trial takes place?”

“I think you’re the embarrassment of our Holy Heavens organization....” A soft voice entered the ears of everyone present.

As they turned to stare at the source of the voice, Fu Yunjie’s expression changed. “Huang Xiaolong!”
