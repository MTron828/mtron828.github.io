Chapter 2150: The Mighty God Prince’s Threat

"Xumi Old Man?" Huang Xiaolong’s ears perked up at the mention of the name.

Could it be the Buddha World’s Xumi Old Man? Huang Xiaolong leaped off from his divine beast mount and landed in front of the group of disciples, blocking their path.

Seeing that someone had suddenly blocked their path, the disciples were about to curse in anger when their eyes spotted Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong who were right behind Huang Xiaolong. Their hearts jumped to their chests as they quickly saluted, “Paying our respects to Lords from the Heavenly Saint Country!”

Although Zhu Xinyi’s and Zhu Hong’s reputation was not as loud as the Heavenly Saint Ruler or the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s Marshal Lan Shifan, both of them were quite famous. Not to mention that both of them were in charge of the Heavenly Saint Country’s branch at the Heaven Valley. They could be seen occasionally at the marketplace. Hence it wasn’t strange that many disciples of various forces recognized Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong.

Both of them nodded their heads.

Zhu Xinyi took over the scene, “Whatever this Young Master asks, you all just need to answer in detail.” He respectfully pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

The disciples promptly answered ‘yes’ in affirmation.

“Just now, you were talking about the Xumi Old Man and Mighty God Prince? I want to know about it in detail.” Huang Xiaolong stated.

The several disciples quickly recounted in detail about the Xumi Old Man and Mighty God Prince to Huang Xiaolong.

It seemed that there was an old man called Xumi Old Man at store number eighteen who was selling something called Moon Elephant Spirit Fruit. The Moon Elephant Spirit Fruit was a level two origin treasure. It was one of the ingredients needed to refine a type of origin pill. The Mighty God Prince desired to buy the old man’s Moon Elephant Spirit Fruit, and he offered one thousand mid-grade chaos spirit stones. Who would have thought that Xumi Old Man would actually refuse to sell.

Store number eighteen!

“Come on, we’re going to store number eighteen!” Huang Xiaolong said to Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong.

Both Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong complied.

Watching the trio leave, the several disciples were baffled as they looked at each other in shock.

“Who is that lord?” One of them asked out aloud, “Even Lord Zhu Xinyi and Lord Zhu Hong are so respectful towards him? A big shot from the Heavenly Saint Country?”

“Lord Zhu Xinyi and Lord Zhu Hong are both well-known generals of the Heavenly Saint Country. There are only two people who receive such respectful treatment from Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong; one is the Heavenly Saint Ruler and the other is Marshal Lan Shifan. I have seen Marshal Lan Shifan once when I accompanied my father to pay Marshal Lan Shifan a visit. Could that person be the Heavenly Saint Ruler?” Another disciple took a guess.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler!

Everyone was astounded.

When Huang Xiaolong had suddenly appeared out of nowhere blocking their path, they were on the edge of snapping at him.

“I don’t think he’s the Heavenly Saint Ruler.” Another disciple shook his head, “According to rumors, the Heavenly Saint Ruler wears a golden scarlet divine armor, enshrouded by the golden scarlet glow from head to toe, and he exudes a majestic aura of divinity. That young man absolutely cannot be the Heavenly Saint Ruler. Most likely, he’s the Heavenly Saint Prince.”

“Heavenly Saint Prince!” The disciple’s companions exclaimed in astonishment.

The Heavens Path has ten great experts, representing the ten most powerful individuals in the Heavens Path.

Other than the top ten experts, there were also ten princes that represented the Heavens Path’s ten most talented and strongest younger generation.

Amongst the top ten princes, the Heavenly Saint Prince was the most mysterious one. Rumour had it that no one had seen his real face.

“Maybe, he’s really the Heavenly Saint Prince...?!”

......

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t aware that he was already being labeled as the ‘Heavenly Saint Prince’ by the disciples he had met earlier. He was urging his divine beast mount and racing to the store number eighteen.

Although the group of disciples didn’t provide much information, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that Xumi Old Man was the same Xumi Old Man of the Buddha World. The same old man who he had once met in the lower realm.

As the trio rushed to store number eighteen, Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong briefly described the Mighty God Prince to Huang Xiaolong.

The Mighty God Prince ranked sixth amongst the top ten princes in the Heavens Path. His strength had already entered the ranks of an overlord at the mid-Fifth Order Sovereign Realm. Then again, in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, this level of strength was nothing more than a palm swipe, and same as swatting a fly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Rushing as fast as they could, Huang Xiaolong’s group soon reached store number eighteen.

At this time, there was a big crowd of heavenly countries’ disciples in front of the store.

“Old man, are you really not selling these Moon Elephant Spirit Fruit?” A harsh voice came out from the store. “I’m giving you the last chance. Take the one thousand mid-grade chaos spirit stones I am offering, and sell these two Moon Elephant Spirit Fruit to me.”

A cold sneer escaped Huang Xiaolong’s lips upon hearing that thinly veiled threat. From the information Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong had given him on the way over, he had learned that one Moon Elephant Spirit Fruit was already worth over two thousand mid-grade chaos spirit stones. There were two Moon Elephant Spirit Fruits in Xumi Old Man’s hands. The Mighty God Prince actually wanted to purchase two Moon Elephant Spirit Fruits with a mere one thousand mid-grade chaos spirit stones. It wasn’t strange that Xumi Old Man was unwilling to sell.

“Not selling.” Xumi Old Man’s voice sounded from the store, “At least four thousand.”

The Mighty God Prince sneered, “Fine then. I’m waiting to see who will dare to buy something that I, Mighty God Prince, wants.”

Although fighting was prohibited within the Heaven Valley, as soon as he spoke, absolutely no one dared to perform any transactions in this Xumi Old Man’s store.

“Four thousand mid-grade chaos spirit stones, I’ll take the fruits.”

Right when the thought flashed across the Mighty God Prince’s mind, a disconcerted voice shattered the tense atmosphere.

The crowd and everyone in the store blanked for a second; some were shocked, while others were surprised, as they turned to look at the owner of the voice.

There’s someone who has the guts to oppose the Mighty God Prince. That was not different than rushing to seek death, ah.

The Mighty God Prince’s face sank in an instant as he turned around.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the gazes around him and walked straight into the store.

Those who were gloating at Huang Xiaolong’s foolhardiness at opposing the Mighty God Prince were stupefied when they saw Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong behind Huang Xiaolong. The noisy crowd was hushed immediately.

The Mighty God Prince also noticed Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong. He frowned subconsciously, feeling a little baffled. What is this young man’s connection to the Heavenly Saint Country?

Judging from Zhu Xinyi’s and Zhu Hong’s demeanor, they were very respectful towards this young man. He had seen the Heavenly Saint Prince once, and clearly, this young man was not the Heavenly Saint Prince.

“Who are you? What is your relationship with the Heavenly Saint Country?” The Mighty God Prince demanded forcefully.

However, Huang Xiaolong continued onwards as if he neither heard nor saw the Mighty God Prince. He passed by the Mighty God Prince’s side and stopped in front of Xumi Old Man. He smiled and said, “Senior Xumi, we finally meet again!”

The last time they had met was in the lower realm. It felt as if an era had passed since then.

Xumi Old Man’s appearance was the same as it was when Huang Xiaolong had met him in the lower realm. There were barely any changes.

“So, it’s you, young friend.” Seeing Huang Xiaolong, a smile spread over Xumi Old Man’s face, as if he was seeing a dear old friend.

The Mighty God Prince’s eyes turned icy as he saw that Huang Xiaolong was ignoring him and chatting happily with Xumi Old Man. There were not many people in the Heavens Path who had the guts to ignore him.

“Zhu Xinyi, this brat is someone from your heavenly country?” The Mighty God Prince turned around again, questioning Zhu Xinyi in an ill-intentioned tone.

A low cold sneer sounded from Zhu Xinyi upon hearing that. He responded, “Mighty God Prince, please correct how you address someone. Young Master Huang is an honorable guest of our heavenly country.”

Honorable guest?

Those in the crowd widened their eyes in silence.

The Mighty God Prince frowned deeply. He then looked at Huang Xiaolong once again and spoke harshly, “Brat, I don’t care what’s your connection with the Heavenly Saint Country, but if you dare to buy these two Moon Elephant Spirit Fruits today, then you will be acting against my Mighty God Heavenly Country. You should know the consequences of that!”

Huang Xiaolong took out four thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones as if he had not heard the Mighty God Young Master’s words, “Senior Xumi, here are four thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones. These two Moon Elephant Spirit Fruits are mine now!”
