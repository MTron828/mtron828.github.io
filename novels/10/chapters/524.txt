Originally, Huang Xiaolong had thought that this planet was uninhabited, which spurred his decision to make a rest stop here, but the moment his feet touched the land, he immediately sensed a peculiarity.

“There’s something odd about this planet,” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi affirmed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

He did not expect Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi to have the same feeling. Since Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi confirmed his suspicion, then there was definitely something not right with this planet.

“With your current speed, we’ll be able to reach the Central Starfield in four months, there’s ample time.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said, “Let’s explore this planet first.’”

Huang Xiaolong had exactly the same intention. Thus, he moved forward with his feet hovering close to the surface.

As he moved forward, Huang Xiaolong only saw sand and stones on the ground around him. Sand and stones of a dull black color, there wasn’t a hint of green vitality to be found. Even its airspace was a gloomy gray with an endless sandstorm covering a large area.

“Every shred of this planet’s life energy, even the time and space laws in the chaotic layer, feels like it was extracted by something.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke “Because of this, the planet feels dead, without a hint of life. I truly cannot detect any shred of the time and space laws.”

Huang Xiaolong asked, “Could there be some great master cultivating an evil technique here, extracting this planet’s vitality as well as its time and space laws?”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi shook his head, “Not possible. No one can extract the time and space laws, including Highgod realm masters. Not to mention the fact that some planets hold a terrifying amount of life energy, even if a Highgod Realm master tried to extract a planet’s life energy, he would barely be able to extract half of it in ten thousand years.”

Huang Xiaolong did not say anything. Instead, he opened his Eye of Hell, looking deep into the ground, noticing some strands of greenish energy underneath.

Those green energy strands contained abundant life energy.

“Underground?” When Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi heard Huang Xiaolong mention the green energy beneath the earth, he was dazed for a second before a shiver ran down his body: “Could it be...?! Quick, go down below!”

“Go down?” Huang Xiaolong smiled a little helplessly. Despite having refined fifteen primordial divine dragons, which enabled him to control the water, ground, metal, fire, and wood elements in his surroundings, he could, at most, only enter about a hundred zhang underground. If he went any deeper than that, he couldn’t do anything.

The reason was his lack of strength.

“I’ll take you.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said, immediately rushing out from the Dragon Pearl. His five-clawed divine golden dragon body wound the space around Huang Xiaolong. With a twist, he carried Huang Xiaolong into the ground in an instant, moving deeper and deeper inside.

A brief moment later, both of them reached five hundred meters underground, where Huang Xiaolong saw the green threads of energy. When Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi arrived underground, these green energy strands floated close around them.

Huang Xiaolong inhaled, breathing in some of the green energy into his body. His body trembled, feeling unbelievably refreshed. The Asura battle qi inside his body felt much purer in an instant. What Huang Xiaolong found hard to believe was the fact that these green energy strands actually contained the time and space laws!

Close to him, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was ecstatic, “Come, let’s check out in front.” Not waiting for a reply, he wrapped around Huang Xiaolong and flew forward.

The further they went, the denser the green energy grew, exuding a more buoyant life energy.

Looking around, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the dull sand and stones were no longer in sight. Instead, they had entered a pale green space, similar to a space opened by Highgod Realm masters.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi continued to fly forward while carrying Huang Xiaolong for about an hour before they finally stopped.

Huang Xiaolong looked up ahead, immediately spotting a large green, jade-like stone hovering not far from them. It was a jade green rhombus shaped column, reaching two adult men’s height combined. The green jade column was almost a clear translucent green, just like a crystal. Inside the jade stone were bubbles of green liquid that constantly moved, vaguely forming the shape of a human.

“It really is a spiritual embryo bred by nature!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi exclaimed with an excited face.

Huang Xiaolong had never seen this old dragon become so excited since his resurrection. He turned back toward the bubbles of green liquid inside the jade stone, ‘Is this stuff so good?’

Spiritual embryo?

Despite his suspicions, Huang Xiaolong keenly felt that refining the green liquid inside this jade stone would surely help him breakthrough to peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm.

Even reaching half-step God Realm!

By this time, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi and Huang Xiaolong were standing right in front of the green jade stone column, while Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi circled the column again and again, muttering incessantly, “Peerless treasure ah, peerless treasure!”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi probably repeated these few words about a hundred times, making Huang Xiaolong feel as if his ears grew calluses from it.

“I say, Old Dragon, is this stuff so great?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t resist asking out loud.

Although he was quite sure that this thing here could help him advance to half-step God Realm, he couldn’t empathize with the Old Dragon’s exaggerated excitement to the point of being unable to differentiate north from south.

Huang Xiaolong’s voice gradually calmed Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s surging emotions, but it was still evident that his excitement had yet to dissipate, “Little Huang brat, this is because you have no idea how precious this thing is. Let me tell you, just this green jade stone on the outside is more valuable than any divine grade spirit stone.”

“What, more valuable than divine grade spirit stone?!” Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded, finding it hard to believe. To his knowledge, beneath the Divine World, the highest grade of spirit stone was none other than divine grade spirit stone. In the whole Black Tortoise Galaxy, divine grade spirit stones were considered a precious commodity.

One of the reason was their scarcity in the entire Black Tortoise Galaxy. Even the super forces in the Black Tortoise Galaxy would feel reluctant to use the divine grade spirit stones in their possession, for the time it took for a piece of divine grade spirit stone to form required several tens of thousands of years. Once one was used, there would one piece less in the entire Black Tortoise Galaxy.

Yet, the Old Dragon claimed that this green jade stone far exceeded any divine grade spirit stones’ value.

Huang Xiaolong’s breathing quickened visibly.

“Ha, did I frighten you?” Sensing the changes in Huang Xiaolong, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi laughed, “And the green liquid inside this jade stone is not as simple as you think. That green liquid is a ten thousand times more valuable than the jade stone.”

“Ten thousand times!!” Huang Xiaolong felt lightheaded all of a sudden. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi added, “This green liquid is most likely formed from all the life energy on this planet, compressed into this concentrated form. Can you imagine the profuse amount of energy? I need not say more. What’s truly rare is the time and space laws held within this green liquid, giving birth to spiritual intelligence!”

Formed from an entire planet’s life energy!

Furthermore, containing an entire planet’s time and space laws!

A feverish gleam burned in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“This green liquid already possesses a blurry spiritual intelligence, see, its close to forming a human shape. In another decade or so, it would break out from the stone, becoming a real living body!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi exclaimed. “This is the legendary innate spiritual embryo, I’ve only read about it in some ancient records, that every innate spiritual embryo’s birth is world-shaking. Once it breaks out from the jade stone, it is already a God Realm master.”

A God Realm master the moment it is born!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened in shock, wasn’t that a tad too scary?
