‘The Piercing Sky Beast King is here on the Heavenly Mountain?’ This was unexpected news to Huang Xiaolong. The Piercing Sky Beast King, as well as other characters of his caliber; Ancestor Mountaingoat, Green Dragon Beast King, and Ancestor Bifang.

Did news about the White Tiger Divine Fire leak out? Huang Xiaolong shook his head in denial the next second, there couldn’t be such coincidence.

“What do you guys think, is it because of the Heavenly God’s godhead fragment?”

“The godhead fragment, that might be it. Not long ago, the fragment that the White Tiger Institute auctioned off was found here by Wan Zhengxing. There’s bound to be more than one fragment on the whole Heavenly Mountain!”

“That Huang Xiaolong is a true-blue prodigal son, actually spending 5 trillion to buy a Heavenly God’s godhead fragment!”

“That’s called domineering!”

Voices sounded from the same table.

Huang Xiaolong’s movements froze for a second at their words, then he smiled wryly. Prodigal son? Domineering? In all truthfulness, he really did not think of other things when he was bidding for the godhead fragment.

Listening to these people, Huang Xiaolong fell into contemplation... Could it be, the Piercing Sky Beast King, Ancestor Mountaingoat, and the others really came here in search of a piece of the Heavenly God’s godhead?

But Huang Xiaolong soon threw the matter to the back of his mind. Even if there were other godhead fragments on the Heavenly God Mountain, he had no interest in them. His main purpose in coming here was for the White Tiger Divine Fire.

Time flowed by and soon two months had passed. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

During this period, Huang Xiaolong stayed in Lulong City to gather information related to the Heavenly Mountain, especially those related to its peak. Although this kind of information was less than desirable, with the magic of his top divine grade spirit stones, he managed to hear some useful things.

For example, Huang Xiaolong found out that the Heavenly Mountain’s peak was shrouded by dense layers of mist-like white gas throughout the year, and only Highgod Realm masters were capable of passing through it. Therefore, in order to reach the peak, one needed to have strength comparable to a Highgod Realm master, unlike what Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said the past, that only Highgod Realm masters could reach the peak of the mountain.

No doubt, the closer one got to the peak, the heavier the pressure from this white gas became. From the information Huang Xiaolong heard, a late-First Order Highgod Realm master could barely make it further than a thousand zhang through the white gas.

An early Second Order Highgod Realm master was able to go two thousand zhang, mid-Second Order as far as three thousand zhang, a late-Second Order four thousand zhang, and a peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm master could reach five thousand zhang at most. No one knew how far a Third Order Highgod Realm master could go.

In these two months, other than searching for information related to the Heavenly Mountain’s peak, Huang Xiaolong set aside time to refine Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong left Lulong City, heading to the Heavenly Mountain. With his speed, it didn’t take him long to reach halfway up the mountain. Along the way, before any demonic beasts could assault him, they died from Huang Xiaolong’s soul attack.

With the current level of his soul force, he could instantly kill a Second Order Highgod Realm and below with a tangible soul attack, not to mention these God Realm demonic beasts.

Halfway up the mountain, Huang Xiaolong’s vigilance rose as he continued up cautiously. Although he wasn’t afraid of any demonic beast attacks, he’d rather not get trapped by one of the many formations around the Heavenly Mountain.

Slightly over a month later, he finally arrived safely close to the summit after being on his nerves the entire time and saw the said white gas enshrouding the Heavenly Mountain’s peak.

Watching this dense white gas, Huang Xiaolong’s brows were locked together with grimness.

In the four galaxies’ long history, the masters who climbed to the Heavenly Mountain’s peak had all fallen, hence, there was more to this white gas than simple gravitational force.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong was about to break through the white gas and enter, several figures whistled through the air, emitting pressuring auras. Huang Xiaolong nearly jumped out of his skin, but his actions were swift, displaying Space Concealment and hiding into a space pocket.

Huang Xiaolong had just hid away when several figures emerged from the distance. Peering over to see the newcomers’ faces, his eyes narrowed all of a sudden. One of them was none other than Ancestor Mountaingoat.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t recognize the other three people, but he guessed they should be Piercing Sky Beast King, Ancestor Bifang, and Green Dragon Beast King.

Huang Xiaolong did not expect to run into these four people here, did they also plan to go to the Heavenly Mountain’s peak?

“Piercing Sky, you’re sure the Heavenly God’s dwelling is at the peak?” Ancestor Mountaingoat turned to the burly, red-haired middle-aged man beside him.

The red-haired middle-aged man’s deep voice sounded, “Yes, throughout the years of the Heavenly God blood pool’s corrosion, ninety percent of the formations outside the dwelling have greatly weakened. If the four of us join hands, there’s an eighty-percent chance we can break the outer formations!”

“At that time, of the medicinal herbs, divine spirit pellets, and divine grade spirit stones inside, I want thirty percent.” The old man covered in green scales stated.

“Following our previous agreement, half of the godhead fragment goes to Piercing Sky. As for the body, that depends on who gets their hands on it first.” The last person who spoke was a charming young man clad in a seven-colored armor.

Heavenly God’s dwelling? Hearing these four people’s conversation, great waves of shock and excitement crashed at Huang Xiaolong’s heart. He didn’t expect these four people’s purpose coming to the Heavenly Mountain was the actually the Heavenly God’s dwelling! The dwelling was located at the peak of the mountain, and judging from piercing Sky Beast King’s tone, he had determined where its location would be!

No doubt, the red-haired middle-aged man was the Piercing Sky Beast King, the one covered in green scales from head to toe was most likely Green Dragon Beast King, and that charming young man clad in seven-colored armor would be Ancestor Bifang.

Even with Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he was unable to determine these four people’s cultivation.

“But, within this white gas is an ancient Heart Demon Swallowing Formation, after we enter, everyone must be twice as cautious. All of those Highgod Realm masters who came here in the past didn’t really die. After their reason was swallowed, their heart demon would rise, turning them into monsters. These strange monsters are best avoided when we enter.” Piercing Sky Beast King reminded with a gloomy face.

Ancestor Mountaingoat and the other three nodded with the same stern expression.

Following that, the four of them formed a vigorous qi barrier around themselves, made a path through the white gas, and disappeared from view in the next second.

After he was sure the four people had left did Huang Xialong emerged in the air.

“Ancient Heart Demon Swallowing Formation? Huang Xiaolong was taken aback. His Master Feng Yang had once mentioned this ancient Heart Demon Swallowing Formation. It was a powerful formation that took control of one’s heart demon. Once that happened, they would forever lose themselves, reduced to a monster without sanity. This Heavenly Mountain was actually arranged with this kind of formation.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep, deep breath, then called out the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire spirits, forming a protective barrier around himself, and flew into the white gas.

No matter what, he must obtain the White Tiger Divine Fire.

The moment he entered the white gas, Huang Xiaolong felt an invisible power entangling him. The gravitational force was immediately felt, everything was many times heavier. Huang Xiaolong himself plummeted to the ground, unable to fly forward.

He tried a few more times, but the result was the same. This came as a great shock to him. With his current strength, comparable to Crimson Devil Shi Jiu Jiutian, the gravity force was still so overbearing that he couldn’t fly at all?

Left with no other option, Huang Xiaolong could only walk, slowly.

The Piercing Sky Beast King, Ancestor Mountaingoat, and the other two were already long gone. In front of Huang Xiaolong were layers of white gas. Most of all, he noticed that inside this white gas his divine sense could go no further than a hundred zhang.

If he really came across those Highgod Realm masters that had turned into strange insane creatures, what use was a divine sense of a hundred zhang?
