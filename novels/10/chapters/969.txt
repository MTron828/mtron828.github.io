Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group was dumbfounded after running into the battle between Mo Yishi and the Bodhisattva Faction Lord, an unexpected energy fluctuation swept out in their direction.

Li Lu, the Ascending Moon Old Man, and Fan Yuxiao froze in panic. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Huang Xiaolong swiftly struck his palm out and that terrifying energy wave halted in midair, then disintegrated like bubbles.

“Eh!” The Ancient Devil Clan Ancestor Mo Yishi couldn’t help feeling slightly surprised. In the next second, he appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong’s group in quick flicker.

“Early Ninth Order Highgod Realm.” In a single glance, Mo Yishi saw through Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm, adding, “You were actually able to withstand the shockwave from our battle, no wonder you can reach this region.”

Even though the black-haired young man in front of him could disperse the shockwave from his battle with the Bodhisattva Faction Lord, Mo Yishi didn’t really pay any attention to it despite feeling a little surprised.

Mo Yishi’s gaze swept over the other three people in the black-haired young man’s group, an idea flashing in his mind. He then turned to the Bodhisattva Faction Lord, saying, “Ge Zheng, it’s hard to determine an outcome even if the two of us battle for several days straight. How about this, we’ll use these four people as targets at the same time, whoever kills these four people, or who kills the most, wins. That ten-million-years-old Yin Yang Divine Flower will go to him!”

Mo Yishi said, pointing at Huang Xiaolong’s group of four.

He planned to use their group to determine the battle between himself and the Bodhisattva Faction Lord. Clearly, in Mo Yishi’s eyes, these four were merely insignificant ants that he could kill as he liked, powerless to resist.

The Bodhisattva Faction Lord looked at Huang Xiaolong’s group and shook his head, disagreeing, “Amitābha, the Heaven is benevolent to all living beings, we should change to another method.”

Mo Yishi snickered wickedly, “Don’t give me your f*cking ‘Heavens is benevolent to all living beings’ bullshit. Might makes right, that is the eternal rule of this world that will never change! You don’t want to kill them? Fine, then I will! That ten-million-years-old Yin Yang Divine Flower is mine!”

Even before his last syllable sounded, Mo Yishi punched in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

“Devil King’s Fist!’

Devil qi roiled, forming a giant shadow of a devil king that overcast the sky. An atmosphere of uncontrollable killing and slaughter swept over every inch of land.

In the past, the devil clan Patriarch Mo Dingtian also executed this Devil King’s Fist to attack Huang Xiaolong, however, comparing the two, Mo Dingtian was more than a hundred times weaker.

Mo Yishi’s laughter echoed in the air, “Ge Zheng, I’m curious to see how you are going to save these four.”

Although the Bodhisattva Faction Lord’s strength was on par with his, Mo Yishi believed that he wouldn’t make it in time to save these people.

Not to mention the fact that the Bodhisattva Faction Lord did not expect Mo Yishi to suddenly attack, and indeed, it was already too late even if he wanted to block him. Just as Mo Yishi and the Bodhisattva Faction Lord thought that the four people were meat on a chopping board, a cold harrumph sounded in their ears. In the next second, a giant golden palm was seen slamming down.

Boundless Buddhism energy enshrouded heaven and earth, creating a low rumble that shook the surrounding space.

The devil king shadow was ripped into two.

Mo Yishi’s smiling expression changed to alarm and fluster; his body reacted, wanting to dodge, but it was already too late. He took the full force of the golden palm attack and was knocked flying in the opposite direction, plummeting into the Sea of Hell below.

Seawater splashed a thousand zhang high, waves churned and swirled violently.

The Bodhisattva Faction Lord Ge Zheng stood dazed where he was, then foolishly looked at the spot where Mo Yishi dove into the sea. After what seemed like half a day, Ge Zheng suddenly turned back to Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous expression of disbelief on his face.

How was this possible?!

This black-haired young man, how could he possess such pure and boundless Buddhism energy? That young man’s Buddhism energy was twice as pure as his. No, ten times as pure!

Also, this black-haired young man was clearly just an early Ninth Order Highgod Realm cultivator, yet his strength, how could it possibly be...!

Whilst the Bodhisattva Faction Lord was trying to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity, Mo Yishi who had been struck into the sea split the water surface and flew to the air. He too was looking at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief.

“Who are you?!” Mo Yishi roared with anger.

He really couldn’t figure it out. In the Path to Hell, other than the Ghost Refining Sect Master, who else could have such strength?

Huang Xiaolong frankly replied: “Huang Xiaolong.”

Mo Yishi was bemused, “Huang Xiaolong?”

Mo Yishi had stayed within the Sea of Hell for the last hundreds of years, thus he didn’t know what happened outside. Naturally, he hadn’t heard of Huang Xiaolong.

The Bodhisattva Faction Lord, however, exclaimed in shock, “You’re the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s new Union Chief, Huang Xiaolong!”

Mo Yishi was literally a hermit, having stayed in the Sea of Hell for the last few hundred years, it was understandable that he knew nothing of Huang Xiaolong, but for Ge Zheng, this name was no stranger to him.

Although the Bodhisattva Faction was a hidden sect, Huang Xiaolong’s resounding feats, from passing the twelfth floor of the Hellion Tower that no one had ever done to winning the Alchemist Grandmaster Grand Competition’s first place, as well as clearing the fifth section of the Sacred Dan Temple trial had long spread through countless galaxies. The Bodhisattva Faction naturally knew about him.

“What?! The Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s new Union Chief?” Mo Yishi’s face tightened hearing Ge Zheng’s exclamation. The Union Chief position had been empty for more than a million years, yet this black-haired young man was the new Union Chief?!

Could that be a testament to his strength?!

Mo Yishi’s eyes flickered as his mind raced, suppressing the astonishment and anger in his heart. He then flashed an amiable smile at Huang Xiaolong, “Haha, so this young brother is the new Alchemist Grandmaster Union Chief, the incident before was just a misunderstanding! Is young brother also here for that ten-million-year-old Yin Yang Divine Flower? Since it is so, then I will give way!”

With that said, Mo Yishi turned around, preparing to leave.

He had just turned around, but there was someone blocking his path. Who could it be but Huang Xiaolong? He looked coldly at Mo Yishi, speaking in a baffled tone, “Did I say you could leave?”

Mo Yishi’s smile vanished faster than it came, sneering with undisguised disdain looking at Huang Xiaolong, “What is the meaning of this? I can leave if I want and go wherever I want. Even if the Ghost Refining Sect Master himself was here, he still wouldn’t be able to stop me. You think just because you’re the Alchemist Grandmaster Union Union Chief I’ll be afraid of you? Also, I’m the Ancient Devil Clan’s Ancestor, if you know what’s good for you, you’d do better....”

Before he could finish his words, Huang Xiaolong swung a Great Void Divine Fist at him, sending Mo Yishi tumbling disgracefully in the air.

“You!” Mo Yishi bellowed in fury when he regained his balance, blood was flowing out from the corner of his mouth.

“The Ancient Devil Clan’s Ancestor.” Huang Xiaolong looked detached and cold, “You are just the person I wanted to kill!” He then closed the distance between them in a flicker, his fist striking at Mo Yishi a second time.

In the distance, the Bodhisattva Faction Lord inwardly shook his head watching this, his gaze bearing a hint of pity when it fell on Mo Yishi. Looks like Mo Yishi still didn’t know that the Ancient Devil Clan has submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

Another booming blast sounded from the area where Huang Xiaolong and Mo Yishi were fighting as Mo Yishi was once again sent flying by a punch, smashing heavily onto an island several thousand li away, causing the whole island to quake violently in protest.

A short while later, Mo Yishi miserably struggled to his feet.

In another flicker, Huang Xiaolong arrived in front of Mo Yishi with his palm reaching out, pulling him close.

“Huang Xiaolong, you won’t be able to kill me!” Mo Yishi’s face was grimly twisted, “I’ve successfully cultivated the Ancient Devil King Body; in this lower realm, there is no one who can kill me! Including you!”
