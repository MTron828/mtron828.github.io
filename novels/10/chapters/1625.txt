Gu Cheng took a deep breath and suppressed the murderous intent in his heart, “I guess there’s no other choice now but to let that kid live for another month!”

“No, he has twenty eight more days to live!”

Since the test had started two days ago, they only had to wait for another twenty eight days before killing Huang Xiaolong.

“Will there be any problem with Jia Yuan?” Gu Cheng changed the subject and asked Wang Sinan, “It’s a little suspicious that he is willing to defend Duwei to this extent.”

Wang Sinan replied indifferently, “Don’t worry, the junior commander, Lord Sun Chang, is my mentor and regards me highly. Even though I didn’t report the matter to him before revoking Jia Yuan’s status, he will never punish me for this kind of small matter!”

Wang Sinan then continued with a frigid expression, “Later on, I will report to Lord Sun Chang that Jia Yuan had disrespected and disobeyed my orders! Once Lord Sun Chang gives his permission, I will kill Jia Yuan and offer his spirit in honour of Gu Zheng!”

Just when Wang Sinan was about to throw Jia Yuan and the five netherworld guard captains into the lowest level of prison, an enormous flying ship headed straight towards the Brookspring Plane. Even though the words ‘Netherworld King’ was also carved into the hull of the flying ship, comparing Wang Sinan’s ship to this was like comparing a firefly to the moon. This massive ship was hundreds of times more majestic than the one Wang Sinan had come in.

A group of people stood in the ship and a middle-aged man stood before them. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The middle-aged man was like a chaos thunder god as he stood there with an imposing manner. He was like a mountain as he emitted endless might. None of those present dared to look at him.

This middle-aged strong man was the senior commander, Jiao Qingshan, a Ninth Order Emperor Realm expert!

Even though Jiao Qingshan wasn’t the strongest senior commander in the Netherworld King’s Organization, he was the most talented one!

Behind Jiao Qingshan, stood thirty plus subordinates respectfully, and all of them were in the Emperor Realm. Even though all of them were individuals who were able to shake the heavens and earth, they didn’t dare to breathe loudly right now. Even though they were unaware of the reason behind Jiao Qingshan’s hurry to get to the Brookspring Plane, they could faintly guess that something big was about to happen.

Jiao Qingshan held the summoning signal in his hand as the expression on his face turned frosty.

The contents in the summoning signal were short. It only mentioned that Wang Sinan had revoked Jia Yuan’s eldership and thrown him into the lowest level of the Netherworld King’s prison.

“It seems like some people in our Netherworld King’s Organization think that they are important enough to ignore the rules and laws of our organization as they wish. What do you guys think?” Jiao Qingshan spoke as the junior commanders behind him started to feel restless.

Everyone behind him stood there in shock and replied thoughtlessly, “Yes, yes, Lord Jiao Qingshan.”

Jiao Qingshan suddenly turned his head and stared at one of them, “Sun Chang, what do you think?”

The gazes of the other junior commanders fell onto Sun Chang in unison.

Sun Chang’s heart jumped and his expression seemed to turn a little complicated as he forced a smile, “Yes, yes. This type of behavior is definitely intolerable. We should kill anyone like that to send a warning to others!”

As soon as he spoke, he realized what was going on. As if on cue, his summoning symbol flashed.

“Looks like your subordinate has something important to report to you. Open the summoning signal and let everyone see what it is.” Jiao Qingshan said calmly.

“Yes, Lord Jiao Qingshan!” Sun Chang didn’t dare disobey him and braced himself as he revealed the contents of his summoning symbol.

“Lord Sun Chang, elder Jia Yuan has disobeyed my orders and offended me, this subordinate suggests to revoke his status as an elder! I hope Lord Sun Chang permits it!”

That was the content of the summoning symbol.

However, no one found anything strange about the contents until Jiao Qingshan revealed more, “Suggest to remove his status as an elder? However, from what I know, Wang Sinan has already revoked Jia Yuan’s status and is currently sending people to throw him into the lowest level of the Netherworld King’s prison as we speak.”

Sun Chang’s complexion changed and the looks that landed on him turned complicated.

As a grand elder, Wang Sinan did not have the authority to revoke the status of an elder. Not only did he go ahead and do it, he even planned to throw Jia Yuan into the lowest level of the Netherworld King’s prison!

At this time, everyone understood the reason behind Jiao Qingshan’s previous words. He was obviously referring to Wang Sinan!

“Lord Jiao Qingshan, this subordinate has been negligent! This subordinate will make sure to severely punish Wang Sinan!” Sun Chang fell to his knees in a hurry. Beads of cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

“There’s no need for that. Let’s talk about that when we arrive at the Brookspring Plane. However, I just received a report about how Wang Sinan is now drinking wine and celebrating with some Grand Elder, Gu Cheng from the Gu family in the inner hall of the branch!” Jiao Qingshan said with indifference.

Cold sweat drenched Sun Chang’s back.

The inner hall of the branch was a sacred place, and he was actually having a party with an outsider! If the report was really true, the punishments would be extremely severe to say the least.

A few hours later.

The flying ship finally arrived at the Brookspring Plane and it flew directly towards the branch.

When the flying ship appeared on the Brookspring Plane, everyone felt an explosion going off in their mind.

This flying ship was something that only the junior commanders of the Netherworld King’s Organization had. However, one of those flying ships had actually appeared in the Brookspring Plane!

Even God Kings were rare presences in the Brookspring Plane, let alone a Heavenly Monarch. When Wang Sinan and Gu Cheng had appeared, they had caused a huge ruckus. Looking at the ship above them, it seemed as though an Emperor Realm expert had arrived.

Inside the inner hall of the Netherworld King’s Organization branch, Wang Sinan and Gu Cheng received the news and they looked at each other in shock.

“Is it possible that Lord Sun Chang is here?” Wang Sinan asked as he raised an eyebrow.

“Should I withdraw for a moment?” Gu Chang asked.

“There’s no need for us to stop this feast. Now that Lord Sun Change has arrived, let’s go and receive him!” Wang Sinan waved his hands and dismissed him.

He knew that Sun Chang wouldn’t pick on him for these small matters.

“You can follow me to welcome Lord Sun Chang, and I can also take this opportunity to introduce you to him.” Wang Sinan stood up and prepared to leave the hall.

Gu Cheng revealed a face full of smiles, “Many thanks to Brother Sinan.”

“You’re welcome.”

The two of them quickly left to meet Lord Sun Chang.

As soon as they emerged from the hall, the massive flying ship appeared within their sights. In an instant, it arrived in the space above them.

The cabin opened and a group of people stepped out from within.

Before Wang Sinan could kneel down and pay his respect, his whole body froze as he saw the group of people coming out. This... this was?!

When he saw the middle-aged man in front of him, his face changed drastically as if he was struck by a bolt of divine lightning. He fell to his knees as he greeted in a trembling voice, “Wang Sinan pays his respect to Lord Senior Commander!”

Senior Commander?!

Gu Cheng was astonished. His body started to shake violently as his thoughts ran wild. What in the world is going on here?!

While Gu Cheng was still in shock, Jiao Qingshan led everyone towards the kneeling Wang Sinan.
