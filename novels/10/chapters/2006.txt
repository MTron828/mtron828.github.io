As the runes entered the bodies of those controlled by their inner demons, they slowly opened their eyes as they snapped back to reality.

When Dun Ei saw the unclouded look in their eyes, he knew that it was a matter of time before they snapped back to reality.

Dun Ei roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, your Heart of Hell is nothing more than decoration when faced against me! My Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra can stop you from controlling the inner demons of my troops! What other tricks do you have up your sleeves?”

Dun Ei’s laughter got louder and louder as it boomed across the battlefield.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he stared at Dun Ei, who was laughing his face off.

Before Dun Ei could react, the bishops who seemed to have regained their clarity turned berserk once again. They attacked those around them in a maniacal fashion, regardless if they were allies or foes.

Dun Ei choked on his laughter, and he stared at the scene before him in shock.

“Hurry! Continue to chant the Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra!” Dun Ei roared at the pontiffs behind him.

It was too bad no matter how many runes entered the bodies of the bishops Huang Xiaolong controlled, they were completely useless.

“This is not possible! The Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra is the strongest heart cleansing method! It can stop all evil! What’s going on?!” Dun Ei stared at Huang Xiaolong with a crazed expression in his eyes.

If his Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra was really unable to awaken all the bishops controlled by Huang Xiaolong, things would get out of hand. It wouldn’t take a genius to figure out what would happen when so many experts turned against him.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Dun Ei and snickered under his breath. The Heart of Hell’s power wasn’t something the likes of Dun Ei could figure out. If his Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra could stop the attack from the Heart of Hell, it wouldn’t deserve its name as the Heart of Hell.

Everyone had inner demons. There was no need to mention Emperor Realm experts when even Sovereigns could not free themselves from all desires. Without a pure heart, one would never be able to escape from the control of the Heart of Hell.

Of course, there were limits to the strength of the Heart of Hell. With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he could only control those who were Fifth Order Emperors or weaker.

If he were to try to control anyone stronger, the effects wouldn’t be as good.

As he controlled the experts to turn around and kill the Radiance Divine City’s army, he turned to look at an old man located somewhere on the battlefield. The old man had a strange tattoo in the space between his eyebrows, and there was a calm look on his face as he killed his way around.

Every time he waved his arm, a huge group of Radiance Knight would turn into ash. Even if they were archbishops from the Radiance Knight Corp, they couldn’t avoid disaster.

Lu Kun!

The old man was the traitor of the Netherworld King’s Organization, Lu Kun!

He was the reason a ton of Senior Commanders, Junior Commanders, supervisors, and even disciples had betrayed the Netherworld King’s Organization. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Seemingly able to feel the killing intent coming from Huang Xiaolong, Lu Kun sent an archbishop from the Radiance Knight Corp flying with a single palm before turning to face him. His sharp gaze pierced through space and landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

His gaze was an ancient soul attacking art, and even high-level Emperors wouldn’t be able to escape unscathed from Lu Kun’s sudden attack,

It was too bad that the Moon Jade heavenly Spiral Shell in Huang Xiaolong’s godsea emitted a brilliant silver glow to withstand Lu Kun’s sneak attack. Huang Xiaolong’s Emperor will turned into a tiny chaos ax ready to defend him at any time.

When Lu Kun’s soul attack smashed into the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell and the tiny chaos ax, a ringing sound echoed in Huang Xiaolong’s head. However, he felt nothing.

“Huh?” Lu Kun stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. He never expected Huang Xiaolong to stop his attack so easily.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

“Lu Kun!”

Their gazes met, and they saw the burning killing intent in each other’s eyes.

They wanted nothing more than to tear each other into pieces.

“Lu Kun, you betrayed the Netherworld King’s Organization. Based on our rules, you shall receive the death sentence!” Huang Xiaolong glared at Lu Kun coldly.

Lu Kun burst into laughter the moment he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong and started to curse, “Huang Xiaolong, are you going to be meting out the punishment? With your strength? Don’t kid yourself. Do you think that the little id*ots around you will be able to do anything to me?” Without a doubt, Lu Kun felt that the Netherguards and angels around Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to do a thing to him.

“The winner is always the king. Since the beginning of time, the winner has always been right. Stop calling me a traitor. As long as I kill you today, I can say anything I want! I’ll tell everyone that you conspired with the Radiance Knights to drive the Netherworld King’s Organization to ruin. As long as I kill you, I will be the savior of the Netherworld King’s Organization!”

“If not for you, I would have already been in control of the entire organization! I would be the ruler of all three worlds in Hell!”

A surge of killing intent left Lu Kun’s body the moment the words left his mouth. His body transformed into a ray of light as he charged at Huang Xiaolong.

The ray of light that was flying at Huang Xiaolong wasn’t made up of afterimages. It was an actual ray of light that was shooting towards Huang Xiaolong.

In the blink of an eye, Lu Kun’s palms were already flying towards Huang Xiaolong’s face...

“Junior Brother, be careful! That’s the Myriad Appearances Demonic Art!” Jiang Hong yelled at Huang Xiaolong.

The Myriad Appearances Demonic Art was one of the strongest techniques in Hell. As long as one completely comprehended the technique, that person could transform into anything they wanted. That was real transformation, and it wasn’t a mere illusion. The only person who had managed to cultivate the Myriad Appearances Demonic Art was the Myriad Appearances Demon in the past.

After the King of Hell had killed him, no one had successfully cultivated his special technique.

Right now, it seemed as though that wasn’t true. Lu Kun had already achieved some accomplishments in the technique.

When Huang Xiaolong heard Jiang Hong’s warning, his heart constricted. Luckily for him, he had already made his preparations. The instant Lu Kun made his move, the City of Eternity emerged from his body. Blinding light appeared in the space before him as the twelve angels arranged the Radiance Formation to defend Huang Xiaolong.

The one hundred Undead Netherguards didn’t remain idle. They arranged the Undead Formation in an instant to defend against Lu Kun’s attack.

The Four Spirits Divine Armor appeared around Huang Xiaolong’s body in a flash as the four divine spirits appeared to protect him.

Boom!

The City of Eternity and the two formations slammed into the beam of light at the same time.

However, that didn’t seem to be all. A glowing sword appeared behind Huang Xiaolong and pierced towards his heart. The four divine spirits were shattered instantly, and the tip of the sword continued to pierce towards Huang Xiaolong. Right before Huang Xiaolong turned into a human skewer, four figures appeared behind him. They didn’t hesitate as they sent the person who carried out the sneak attack flying.

Bang!

A figure shot out, and the sword in his hand flew away.

When Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the assassin, he realized that it was the Brightness Emperor, Lan Zhi. Lan Zhi vomited mouthful after mouthful of blood, and he stared at the four odd beasts with a face full of shock.

Before he could react, the four odd beasts had already transformed into beasts several tens of thousands of feet tall. They started their attack, and palms rained down on Lan Zhi.

“Lan Zhi, since you’re here, you don’t have to leave!” Huang Xiaolong revealed a frosty look in his eyes and glared at Lan Zhi.

Lan Zhi panicked and wanted to run, but more than seventy ice dragons appeared behind him before he could escape. Waves after waves of frigid qi surged towards Lan Zhi.

The sheer amount of frigid qi froze everything around Lan Zhi, and even the space around him was affected.

Unable to move, Lan Zhi could only watch as the four odd beasts’ attack arrived before him.

“No!” As though he had already seen his gruesome end, Lan Zhi yelled in shock and terror, “Senior Brother, save me!”

Before Dun Ei could do anything, eight palms landed on Lan Zhi’s body. He exploded into a mist of blood before Dun Ei could utter a single word.
