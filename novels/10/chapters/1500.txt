Fang Xuanxuan took a deep breath, making an effort to calm herself from this recent shock. However, upon further consideration, should she report this matter to her father? And also to her Uncle Zhao?

Report?

Don’t report?

Fang Xuanxuan’s mind turned into a paste as she struggled internally to make decisions.

Similar thoughts hung over Peng Xiao’s mind too.

At this time, inside the hall, the little cow said to Bei Lengyang, “You are very curious why I become like this, aren’t you?”

“Lengyang does have this thought. With Senior’s strength, how did...?” Bei Lengyang spoke out his thoughts honestly.

The little cow sighed heavily at this subject. “I was too confident of my strength at that time, and entered the depths of Devil Abyss, and encountered two terrifying monsters!”

Bei Lengyang shuddered. Two terrifying monsters!

Did these two terrifying monsters destroy Senior Azure Cow’s body? If that was the case, then those two monsters’ strength was beyond his imagination.

“Frankly, those two monsters did not destroy my body.” The little cow explained noticing Bei Lengyang’s expression. “Though those two were powerful monsters, the two of them together merely battled to a draw against me. The three of us battled several nights and days, but unexpectedly in the end, the three of us triggered one of the ancient restrictive formations in the depths of Devil Abyss!”

There was fear on the little cow’s face as she spoke of the ancient formation.

Even though the little cow did not elaborate further, Huang Xiaolong and Bei Lengyang could guess that this ancient formation had destroyed her body, back then.

The little cow went on, “After that formation was triggered, we were caught in an endless chaos thunderstorm. Those two monsters were lucky and escaped in the nick of time, whereas I was half a second late, and my body was destroyed in that endless violent chaos thunderstorm. Later on, I resorted to an ancient technique and successfully protected my soul, while escaping. Even so, my soul suffered great damage.”

“It took my soul several hundred years to heal. After that, with great effort, I found this suitable body to reincarnate and cultivate again from scratch.”

The little cow sounded extremely depressed as she continued, “Though this body is quite good, it cannot be compared to my past body ah. Unless I come across a big fortuitous adventure, it would be hard to recover to my peak strength.”

At this moment, Huang Xiaolong finally came to know the reason behind the little cow’s reincarnation.

He was surprised to know that there was such a terrifying ancient formation in the Devil Abyss’ depths.

The Ancient Heavenly Court treasure had fallen in the depths of Devil Abyss. How was he going to search for it?

Bei Lengyang quickly responded, “So, it’s like that, but with Senior’s previous life experiences, even though starting from scratch, returning to the peak will only be a matter of time. Senior need not worry too much.”

The little cow shook her head, dismissing the topic, “I’m most clear about my situation. You don’t need to fawn over me to make me happy.” She then added, “I called you to have you help me find some things.”

Bei Lengyang respectfully said, “Senior, please tell me. As long as it’s something that is within the Silver Fox Commerce’s ability, Bei Lengyang would definitely find it for Senior!”

“I want you to find some Extreme Yin Spirit Stones, Ghost Beast Thistle...” The little cow went on and listed several hundred kinds of rare chaos spiritual herbs and things that could help raise one’s strength.

As he listened to the things the little cow wanted, Bei Lengyang was slightly baffled. Based on the little cow’s current cultivation realm, these things were not suitable for her usage as yet, but he dared not asked any questions. When the little cow had finished, he respectfully answered, “Rest assured, Senior, I’ll send my people to check our Silver Fox Commerce’s inventory, then send over the things Senior has requested.”

The little cow nodded her head in satisfaction, then looked at Huang Xiaolong tauntingly, “Xiaolong, didn’t you want to get materials to repair the Dragon Shark Flying Ship? Since your father-in-law is here, you can just tell your father-in-law. I think he won’t charge you a high price.”

Father-in-law?

Bei Lengyang blanked momentarily. If someone else would have dared to make such a joke, he would have struck that person down on the spot with a whip of chaos lightning. But when Bei Lengyang heard the little cow’s words, he grinned at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Xiaolong ah, I know Xiaomei talks about you everyday.”

Huang Xiaolong had a king of supreme godhead and based on his relationship with the little cow, it could be said that Bei Lengyang was quite satisfied with this ‘future son-in-law.’

Huang Xiaolong was a little awkward as he hesitated, “Er, Uncle Bei, it’s like this, I already have...”

But Bei Lengyang laughed, waving his hand nonchalantly while saying, “Men, right? Which master doesn’t have a few companions?”

Although Huang Xiaolong had not broken through to God King Realm yet, in Bei Lengyang’s eyes, not too far in the future, Huang Xiaolong was bound to become a pinnacle existence in the Divine World. And with the little cow’s support, Huang Xiaolong could even become...?!

Thinking of this, the appreciation in Bei Lengyang’s gaze deepened for Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong had no idea what Bei Lengyang was thinking about, however, he felt a shiver running down his spine as Bei Lengyang did not object to Bei Xiaomei and him becoming a couple...

Huang Xiaolong relaxed around Bei Lengyang and gave Bei Lengyang the list of materials he still lacked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Bei Lengyang noted Huang Xiaolong’s materials list. He right away used his communication talisman to order his subordinate to prepare the things Huang Xiaolong and the little cow wanted and send them to him.

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Bei Lengyang didn’t wait long before Bei Lengyang’s subordinate appeared with the things.

As expected of the Silver Fox Commerce, they had all the materials Huang Xiaolong needed. Despite these materials’ rarity, the Silver Fox Commerce had everything Huang Xiaolong and the little cow needed. Bei Lengyang not only had his subordinate send them the requested materials, but he even had them prepared twice the requested quantities.

From the little cow’s list, Bei Lengyang had everything sent to him from the Silver Fox Commerce’s inventory.

Bei Lengyang personally handed over the spatial ring containing these materials to the little cow respectfully. The little cow’s divine sense swept over the spatial ring’s space, then nodded with satisfaction. She didn’t feign courtesy and accepted the spatial ring. She knew that these things were trivial to the Silver Fox Commerce.

“Uncle Bei, I happened to hear the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord mention the Treasures Assembly when we were outside. May I ask what it is about?” Huang Xiaolong asked Bei Lengyang.

Huang Xiaolong was in a good mood since he had all the materials he needed to repair the Dragon Shark Flying Ship.

“Oh, you’re talking about the Treasures Assembly, is it? The Treasures Assembly is actually an event similar to an auction held by the Heavenly Court. There’s one held from time to time, and the Treasures Assembly this time actually has quite a few good things.” Bei Lengyang went on, “If Xiaolong and Senior Azure Cow want to go, I’ll have someone send over a high-grade card.”

“I’ll be troubling Uncle Bei then.” Huang Xiaolong was interested, hence he accepted Bei Lengyang’s offer.

They were already there at Heavens Avenue after all, and since there was a Treasures Assembly around the corner, Huang Xiaolong was interested in taking a look at it. Maybe, he could really find something good.

Bei Lengyang laughed, “Nothing troublesome, just a small matter.” Subsequently, Bei Lengyang had his subordinate bring two high-grade cards.

“Xiaolong, you go out first, I need to speak with Kiddo Yang alone.” The little cow said to Huang Xiaolong after some thought.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and went out.

Huang Xiaolong was surrounded by four women just as he stepped out of the hall, bombarded by questions from all four directions. Bei Xiaomei’s ecstatic shouts of ‘Uncle’ gave Huang Xiaolong a headache.
