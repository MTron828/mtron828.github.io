Chapter 2213: Black Devil Sect's Incense Master

“Are you Huang Xiaolong?” A hoarse voice emerged from one of the four men, and they gave off a weird feeling. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head indifferently.

“We come with no ill intentions. We’re here to invite you to join our holy sect.” Another person answered, and his voice sounded exactly the same as the previous guy.

“Holy sect?” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Aren’t you guys from the Black Devil Sect? Since when did the black devil sect evolve to become a holy sect?”

The four of them were precisely experts from the Black Devil Sect. Moreover, none of them were low-level disciples. Every single one of them was an incense master.

Inside the Black Devil Sect, there were ordinary disciples, and above them were the head disciples. Then came the incense masters, hall masters, elders, and finally there was the sect master!

The look in their eyes turned cold when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“I’m not interested in the Black Devil Sect. Please leave.” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Despite hearing his answer, they didn’t leave.

One of them laughed mischievously in a high-pitched voice that made him seem more like an owl than a man. “Not interested? Unfortunately, this is not up to you. Our Black Devil Sect holds the final say in the Jinyuan Kingdom, and the moment we lay our eyes on someone, there are only two outcomes! Submit or die!”

There was a reason they wanted to invite him to the sect.

One of the elders in the Black Devil Sect had heard that Zhang Wenyue had saved a man whose meridians, organs, and spirit sea were shattered. However, that man had managed to heavily injure Housekeeper Wang after a few days of recovery! This incident had caught the attention of an elder in the Black Devil Sect. Hence, he had sent the four of them to capture Huang Xiaolong.

As for wanting Huang Xiaolong to join the Black Devil Sect, it was a lie cooked up by the four of them.

After hearing their boastful claim, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help, but burst out in laughter.

“Brat, what are you laughing about?” Their expressions sank when they realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t taking them seriously.

“Have you thought about a third outcome?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The four of them stared at him like they were looking at a retard.

One of them sneered, “Are you talking about escaping? You better get rid of that stupid idea right now. Our Black Devil Sect’s influence isn’t limited to the Jinyuan Kingdom. We control several neighboring kingdoms and there is no way for you to escape.”

“Not to mention the fact that it’s impossible to escape from us!”

Another one of them smirked, “I heard that you managed to defeat Prince Qian with a single move. However, his strength is nothing compared to us.”

“Furthermore, the number of experts in our Black Devil Sect are like the clouds in the sky. Our sect master is a Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert! If you plan to go against us, you’re seeking death!”

In a flash, the four of them sealed off his escape routes.

When Huang Xiaolong heard them bragging about the strength of their sect master, he couldn’t help but scoff.

The four of them felt rage bubbling in their heart when they noticed his nonchalant expression.

“Brat, we’ll see if you can remain this arrogant after we’re done with you!” One of them glared at him and stretched out an arm to grab Huang Xiaolong. An enormous devil claw appeared, but Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother moving. Instead, he blew softly to disperse the devil qi in the air.

“What?!”

The four of them stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Huang Xiaolong raised his head and dragged the unfortunate man, who had attacked him, towards him.

The three others no longer hesitated when they saw that one of them was already down. They attacked Huang Xiaolong with everything they had. Devil artifacts were summoned one after another, but with a flick of his wrist, Huang Xiaolong shattered all of them. They slammed into the entrance and rolled out of the temple.

Huang Xiaolong clucthed one of them by the neck and said with indifference, “I wasn’t planning to run away. I’m afraid you misunderstood me.”

The expert from the Black Devil Sect was both furious and frightened. All of them were Tenth Order Heavenly Monarchs, and they felt that it was a piece of cake for them to capture Huang Xiaolong! Never would they have thought...

“Brat, don’t say I didn’t warn you. You better release us right now! As incense masters of the Black Devil Sect, even an Emperor Realm expert will die if you make a move on us! In the past tens of thousands of years, more than a hundred Emperors have died after offending us!” One of the black-robed men snorted fearlessly.

“Don’t think that I’m just saying this to scare you!”

However, his voice stopped abruptly and his eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. The light in his eyes dimmed, and he dropped to the ground in the next instant. He was as dead as he could be.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned cold as he searched through the man’s spatial divine artifact. Finding nothing of his interest, he tossed the corpse aside.

“Incense Master Tuo!”

Everyone leaped to their feet when they saw what happened to their comrade.

Before they could regain their composure, Huang Xiaolong had dragged all of them over to him. With a single fist, Huang Xiaolong ended the lives of two of them before turning to look at the last man.

“You!” The face of the remaining expert from the Black Devil Sect turned pale.

“You should be glad I didn’t kill you immediately,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly.

“You will regret this! The experts of our Black Devil Sect will chase you to the ends of the earth!” The last expert hissed as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Are you planning to hunt me down?” Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Don’t worry, I will soon remove the head of your sect master and kick it around like a ball. Too bad you won’t live to see that day.”

He placed his finger on the head of the last member of the Black Devil Sect and searched through his memories. Before long, Huang Xiaolong learned what he needed to. Of course, he didn’t plan to let the other party live.

After he was done killing the man, Huang Xiaolong reviewed everything he had learned during the soul search. The person who had ordered for them to capture him was none other than an elder of the Black Devil Sect, Qin Yuan!

He wasn’t too weak, and his strength was at the middle stages of the Emperor Realm.

“Qin Yuan.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. He also learned that Qin Yuan was waiting for the four of them in Gujiao City in order to bring him back to the sect.

That being the case, he didn’t mind making a trip to Gujiao City in the next few days. It was along the way to the Devouring Icy Forest anyway.

In the end, he decided to leave the corpses in the main hall of the temple instead of disposing of them. He retrieved their spatial artifacts and he started to look through them.

“Eight Desolate Supernatural Pill!”

“Fiery Bear Pill!”

“Prison Sea Divine Pill!”

As incense masters of the Black Devil Sect, the four of them naturally had quite a large amount of treasures in their spatial artifacts. Even though the Eight Desolate Supernatural Pill and Fiery Bear Pills were garbage in his eyes, they were still better than those from Zhang Wenyue. Whatever the case, they were better than nothing.

After looking at the divine pills, Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled. This was like asking a person who was used to eating luxury food to start eating steamed buns.

Only able to make do for now, Huang Xiaolong continued to look through their belongings. He found several divine arts, books, spirit stones, and several banknotes made from the materials in the Holy World.

Of everything in the spatial artifacts, Huang Xiaolong was only interested in the bills. These bills were the currency they used in the Holy World.
