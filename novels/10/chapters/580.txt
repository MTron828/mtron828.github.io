Xie Hui’s shriek jolted the others to their senses.

“Little punk, no wonder you’re acting so conceited, so you’re a peak mid-Second Order God Realm.” Zhao Family’s Elder, Zhao Rui, fixed an icy glare on Huang Xiaolong.

“What?! Peak mid-Second Order God Realm!” Zhao Chen, Xie Hui, and even the Sin City Castellan Zhao Yi’s face turned ash-gray, their widened eyes directed at Huang Xiaolong. Others might not be familiar with Huang Xiaolong, but they were!

When Huang Xiaolong annihilated the Cosmos God Cult and unified the Martial Spirit World, he was but a peak mid-Tenth Order Saint realm! But now, his strength actually reached peak mid-Second Order God Realm!

From then until now, a decade had barely passed!

Ten years!

Thinking of this, Zhao Chen, Xie Hui, Zhao Yi, and the rest felt their hearts shudder. The way they looked at Huang Xiaolong drastically changed.

In the beginning, Zhao Chen, and Xie Hui had assumed that even though Huang Xiaolong broke through to God Realm, becoming a Black Warrior Institute inner disciple, he could at most only be an early First Order God Realm.

When Zhao Yi and everyone’s shock subsided, an endless wave of terror crashed against their souls. The rate of Huang Xiaolong’s growth had truly frightened them. If Huang Xiaolong continued to grow at this terrifying rate, in another several hundred years their Zhao Family’s tragic end would surely come!

“Elder Zhao Rui, we cannot let this Huang Xiaolong continue to grow!” Zhao Yi came to Zhao Rui’s side. Feeling a need to emphasize, he added: “If he’s allowed to grow further, our Zhao Family will perish in his hands!”

Zhao Rui cast a sidelong glance at Zhao Yi with obvious displease, “Do I need you to teach this Elder how to handle things?” This Zhao Yi was acting more presumptuous in front of him by relying on the Patriarch’s favor.

Zhao Yi’s face twitched slightly, but he did not say a word more in the end.

Zhao Rui turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. Despite this being his first meeting with Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong was no stranger to him. Perhaps, it was more accurate to say that Huang Xiaolong was no stranger to their Zhao Family.

A few years ago, when Zhao Yi and Zhao Chen, this pair of father and son, fled back in an embarrassed state to the Zhao Family, it shocked many Zhao Family members. It was also from that time onward that Huang Xiaolong’s name was added to the Zhao Family’s kill list.

However, Zhao Rui didn’t expect this Huang Xiaolong to become a Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciple within a short few years. One could hardly avoid the annoying consequences of killing a Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciple. Still, he stepped toward Huang Xiaolong.

“Elder Zhao Rui, you need not trouble yourself with killing a mere Second Order God Realm, I alone am sufficient.” At this point, the white-haired old man who had been standing beside Zhao Rui spoke. This white-haired old man was also a member of the Zhao Family, and his strength was definitely stronger than Zhao Yi, a mid-Third Order God Realm.

Pondering the white-haired old man’s words, Zhao Rui stopped advancing and nodded his head, “Fine, you go, but don’t kill the punk. He’s a Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciple, killing him would be troublesome. Mn, shatter his Qi Sea, then break his whole body’s meridians.” With his Qi Sea shattered and his whole body’s meridians broken, such a Huang Xiaolong was no different than garbage.

As talented as Huang Xiaolong may be, he would no longer pose any threat to the Zhao Family in the future.

“Elder Zhao Rui, I feel that after shattering this Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea and breaking his meridians, it would be safer to damage his soul as well.” Another Zhao Family Elder spoke, “Even if his Qi Sea and meridians are crippled, a Highgod Realm master can still mend these wounds, however, if his soul is damaged, not even a Highgod Realm master can do anything about it.”

The look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes grew increasingly icy as he watched the group from the Zhao Family. Damaging a person’s soul would turn that person into a fool, this was much crueler than directly killing a person.

‘It seems like the Zhao Family’s nature is quite ‘benevolent.’ Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly.

Hearing the Elder’s suggestion, Zhao Rui nodded towards the white-haired old man, agreeing to damage Huang Xiaolong’s soul. This method was indeed more secure.

Seeing Zhao Rui giving his permission, that white-haired old man proceeded toward Huang Xiaolong with an undisguised sinister cackle, “Little punk, take advantage the little time you have before turning into an idiot, do you have any last words? Maybe, I can lend a hand. Like, do you have a sister or mother that I can help look after? I’ll definitely take real good care of them on your behalf!”

The Zhao Family members burst into waves of obnoxious laughter.

Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved slightly in a cold smile, then he suddenly lifted his palm and pressed through space.

The Zhao Family white-haired old man’s cackle stopped all of a sudden, his head lowered in disbelief looking at his own chest where the shape of a huge palm was imprinted onto his chest. In the next second, red blood seeped out from the palm imprint’s borders at a horrifying speed, toward his face, his legs, his hands, spreading out to every inch of his body.

The Zhao Family group’s laughter behind him also abruptly halted. Before their horrified eyes, the white-haired old man suddenly exploded into pieces, akin to a piece of glass subjected to a high impact force, bursting into pieces.

Blood and flesh splattered all over, covering the floor. The whole inn fell into an eerie silence.

A few seconds passed before the Zhao and Xie Families regained their senses. They had ugly expressions on their faces, glowering fiercely at Huang Xiaolong.

Zhao Rui’s face was gloomy to the extreme, “You punk, you dare to kill my Zhao Family’s members?”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhao Rui as if he was looking at an idiot, “Dare to kill? I don’t think killing a Zhao Family member is any great feat, moreover, why wouldn’t I dare? In a little while, all of you will die as well!”

The other Zhao Family Elder was so enraged that his beard trembled, “Reckless arrogance, a measly Second Order God Realm conceited without limit, punk, I’ll kill you!” The Zhao Family Elder’s momentum rose to the peak, and he was actually a peak early-Fourth Order God Realm, just half a step more and he’d be able to step into mid-Fourth Order God Realm.

In the long history of the Black Tortoise Galaxy, he had never heard of a Second Order God Realm warrior’s strength being tyrannical enough to defeat a Fourth Order God Realm master! And he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong could break this myth!

Just as the Elder was about to attack, a sword light flashed in his eyes. Before he could even realize what happened, a piercing pain came from his chest. He looked down by reflex only to see a wooden sword lodged in his heart. The wooden sword entered his chest, piercing through his heart, and came out through his back.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold snort sounded crisp in the air. With a wave of his sleeves, the Mulberry Sword flew back to his side.

Although this Zhao Family’s Elder was a peak early-Fourth Order, compared to the Black Warrior Institute inner disciple leader Jiang Bi, he was ten times worse. On top of that, Huang Xiaolong made a sudden attack, how could the Zhao Family Elder have time to react?!

While the rest of the Zhao, as well as the Xie Families were still in shock, both of Huang Xiaolong’s hands waved. The Mulberry Sword once again turned into a cold sword light, shuttling between the Zhao and Xie Family members. Miserable screams rippled in the air as each scream was accompanied by a bloom of red blood.

In a few breaths’ time, other than the mid-Fourth Order Zhao Rui, there was no one standing around him. Even so, barely a moment had passed when blood began to seep out from the sword slashes and cuts on Zhao Rui’s body.

“Huang Xiaolong, you...!” Zhao Rui’s figure continued to flicker around the inn, either jumping up or dodging to the sides.

“Stop!!” When the word came out of his mouth, even Zhao Rui felt like an idiot. Would Huang Xiaolong stop? Just when he was beating himself inwardly for being an idiot, the Mulberry Sword’s attacks halted. Zhao Rui blanked for a second, but before he could think of anything else, Huang Xiaolong closed in on Zhao Rui using the Phantom Shadow martial spirit innate ability. One punch landed squarely on Zhao Rui’s Qi Sea.

The force nearly popped Zhao Rui’s eyeballs out of their sockets, doubling over in pain with his mouth agape and tears in his eyes, knocking over the Zhao Family members.

Huang Xiaolong walked over the group of Zhao and Xie Families with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.

Zhao Chen, Zhao Yi, Xie Hui, Xie Chao, and the rest looked at Huang Xiaolong with fear-stricken eyes.
