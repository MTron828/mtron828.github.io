Chapter 2520: Do You Know Lord Di Huai?

Zeng Yin couldn’t help but scream when she saw that Huang Xiaolong remained where he stood, “Huang Xiaolong didn’t you hear me?! Hurry up and run!”

She knew that Huang Xiaolong had a deep grudge with Jiang Tian. As long as Huang Xiaolong fell into the hands of the other party, she felt that he would die a gruesome death.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the worried look on her face, he couldn’t help but laugh. It seemed as though none of them knew what had happened in the outside world. When he thought about it, he realized that even the Jiang Family might not know what happened in the Holy World.

Right now, even though Huang Xiaolong’s reputation was burning bright like the sun in the midday sky, not everyone knew about his identity as the direct disciple of the four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens. After all, there were countless people in the Holy World, and not everyone would know of the peak existences.

After all, the Heavenly Master, and the others were existences who had retreated out of the sight of the world a long time ago. It wasn’t surprising that many people had no idea they existed.

By this time, the few ladies had already arrived beside Huang Xiaolong.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t planning to move, Zeng Yin nearly exploded in rage. She appeared before him and grabbed his hand. “Leave!”

Too bad no matter how hard she pulled, Huang Xiaolong’s body didn’t budge.

She realized that Huang Xiaolong was like a desolate mountain range. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t move him.

A stunned expression slowly appeared on her face.

By this time, the members of the Jiang Family had already arrived. They surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s party instantly.

One of the elders sneered when he saw Huang Xiaolong. “Hahaha! Huang Xiaolong, when we capture you, we’ll have earned a big merit! What a lucky day! Hahaha!”

“Congratulations to the elder…!”

Several disciples chimed in from the side when they noticed the elder’s celebratory expression.

Zeng Yin finally snapped, and she yelled at Huang Xiaolong, “Dummy, why didn’t you leave when I asked you to?!”

Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at Di Huai, and a smile appeared on their lips.

“It’s fine. They won’t be able to fight with me…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “In fact, I won’t even break a sweat if I killed them all!”

The elder, Jiang Shilei, was an Eighth Order Venerable. The strength of the Jiang Family was nothing in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

With his strength at the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, he would merely need to breathe if he wanted to get rid of Jiang Shilei, and those before him.

Zeng Yin couldn’t help but feel anger rushing up her head. “Why are you still in the mood to joke around?!”

When Huang Xiaolong had entered the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate, he wasn’t even a Venerable! How could he be a match for them now? From what Zeng Yin felt, he wouldn’t be able to get rid of them even if he used all his strength!

The experts from the Jiang Family roared with laughter.

“There’s no need to speak for Elder Jiang. That dumb b*stard won’t even be able to harm a hair on my body!” Another expert from the Jiang Family mocked.

In the past, he had seen Huang Xiaolong’s strength. From what he knew, Huang Xiaolong was a weakling. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Before the Departing Sword Sage, and the other True Saints could make a move, Huang Xiaolong stopped them.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the man and flicked his finger, turning the man into a mist of blood.

Blood rain filled the skies as the laughter stopped instantly.

Everyone couldn’t believe their eyes when they looked at the rain of blood before them. The ladies were no exception.

The expert might not have been a high-level Venerable, but he was at the peak of the late-Third Order Venerable Realm! Huang Xiaolong had managed to kill someone like that with a flick of his finger!

He hadn’t just hurt a single hair on the other party’s body, but he had ripped them all off!

Jiang Shilei sucked in a cold breath, and he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “It seems like you’ve entered the mid-level Venerable Realm…”

Moreover, from his estimation, Huang Xiaolong had to be a Sixth Order Venerable!

Mid-level? Venerable! Zeng Yin and the others stared at him in shock.

He managed to enter the mid-level Venerable Realm from the Sovereign Realm in a mere hundred years! That…

“No wonder you’re acting so arrogantly…” Jiang Shilei shifted his gaze to those behind Huang Xiaolong. “Are these the experts you called for?!”

He sneered at Di Huai and the others. “All of you better get the f*ck out of here. Don’t throw your lives away for mere Huang Xiaolong’s sake. Let me tell you right now. Our young master is acting on behalf of the Devil Palace, and he’s under Lord Dou Rui! Do you know who Lord Dou Rui is?! He’s one of the six devil princes of the Devil Palace! Even if Holy Emperors were to arrive, they would have to show him some respect!”

Di Huai and the others couldn’t help but chuckle when they heard what he said.

“Oh… We know your ‘Lord Dou Rui’ alright…”

How could they not know after witnessing the Trial of Blood?!

Jiang Shilei chuckled madly when he heard that Di Huai and the others had heard of Dou Rui, oblivious to their mockery. “Since you’ve heard of him, that’s enough. Just submit to my Jiang Family from now on, and our young master will put in some good words for you when Lord Dou Rui comes.”

Di Huai and the others couldn't hold back their laughter, and they burst out laughing in front of Jiang Shilei.

When Jiang Shilei saw their weird reaction, he frowned. But before he could speak, Huang Xiaolong reached out and grabbed the space before him. A terrifying might crushed Jiang Shilei and sounds of shattering bones rang through the air.

As his limbs turned to dust, he lost consciousness, and his skull started to deform.

Crack!

In front of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong crushed Jiang Shilei.

The members of the Jiang Family didn’t dare to move a muscle as they stared at him in horror. The ladies were shocked and their gazes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

“You… How dare you kill Elder Jiang Shilei?!” The Seventh Order Venerable snapped back to his senses and raged, “You’re crazy?! Are you tired of living?”

As soon as he completed his sentence, Huang Xiaolong sent him flying with a fling of his arm. When the expert slammed into the ground, he had already turned into a pile of mush.

“Too noisy…”

The members of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate were enraged when they witnessed the end of another expert.

“Everyone, attack!” Someone screamed.

In an instant, everyone started to charge towards Huang Xiaolong. It was a shame that before they could do anything, the sword qi around the Departing Sword Sage trembled. With a single shake, the sword qi turned all of them into clouds of blood.
