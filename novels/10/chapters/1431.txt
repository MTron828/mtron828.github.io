“Mas-Mas-Master?!” Prince Chen could barely speak properly with his stiffened tongue. His eyeballs popped out as he watched Zhang Ping prostrating in front of Huang Xiaolong. ‘Isn’t this punk just a Barbarian God Sect’s inner sect disciple? Why? Why is it like this? Why?!’

Then, he heard Luo Ding’s stupefied voice, “Master, you, have you mistaken him for someone else?” He looked at Zhang Ping in confusion and doubt. ‘Master, what Master? Is this young man his Master’s Master?’ He had never heard his Master mention this before.

Zhang Ping’s horror intensified at Luo Ding’s words, and he panicked further. His face went deathly pale as he kowtowed repeatedly at Huang Xiaolong, “Master, this slave did not teach his disciple well, thus he has offended Master. Please spare me, Master, please have mercy ah.” That attitude was portraying Huang Xiaolong as some terrifying devil king.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were at a loss, watching at the way Zhang Ping kowtowing and begging for mercy.

Listening to Zhang Ping’s words so far, it was sounding like Huang Xiaolong would kill him, kill a Barbarian God Sect’s Elder.

‘How is that possible?!’

“Death penalty can be exempted, but punishment is inescapable.” Huang Xiaolong stated as his finger flicked at Zhang Ping. Zhang Ping was sent flying far away like a sheet of paper by Huang Xiaolong’s finger force. When Zhang Ping fell to the ground, everyone could see the bloody hole on his chest, and blood was still gushing out.

Prince Chen, Luo Ding, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu were struck with another wave of shock.

However, what they saw next was even more astounding. The pallid-faced Zhang Ping hastened to his knees despite his injuries, and respectfully kowtowed to Huang Xiaolong again, “Thank you Master for sparing my life!”

This—!

The four of them looked alternately between Huang Xiaolong and Zhang Ping—a Barbarian God Sect Elder was injured, but he was still thanking Huang Xiaolong for sparing his life!

Huang Xiaolong turned to Prince Chen and Luo Ding. They came to their senses upon seeing Huang Xiaolong looking at them.

Plomp! Both fell to their knees simultaneously.

“Master, have mercy ah!” Luo Ding cried and kowtowed in fear.

Prince Chen’s face was flooded with tears, knocking his forehead hard on the ground as he pleaded for his life.

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to deal with these two himself, thus Feng Er stretched out her slender hand and slapped forth. Prince Chen and Luo Ding shot out, however, neither of them fell to the ground, exploding to their deaths in midair.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were a little out of focus looking at the blood splattered the ground for a long time. That Prince Chen, their Chen Country’s tenth prince, died just like that? Also, that Luo Ding was a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple!

After that everything was a blur. They didn’t even realize when and how they followed Huang Xiaolong back to the Tie Family Fort’s main hall.

Zhang Ping did not leave. He stood and waited obediently outside the Tie Family Fort’s fort gates, as Huang Xiaolong hadn’t sent him away.

Half an hour later, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu finally came to their senses. Both of them had questions for Huang Xiaolong, but neither of them dared to ask him anything.

“What do you want to ask me? Ask away.” Huang Xiaolong said calmly.

“Big brother Huang, you..., aren’t you a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple?” Tie Xinlan finally mustered up some courage to ask the question, but her voice was a little louder than a mumble. “Did you already get promoted to a position of Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder?”

Otherwise, how could Huang Xiaolong have found the courage to injure Zhang Ping casually? A Barbarian God Sect’s Elder couldn’t have killed a Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple like Luo Ding, without blinking? Not to mention, Huang Xiaolong had already promised to take the siblings and their father to the Barbarian God Sect to worship any Grand Elder as their Master. This made sense if Huang Xiaolong was a Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder.

Though it was hard to believe that Huang Xiaolong could have risen to the position of a Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder in a short few decades, other than this possibility, neither of them could think of anything else. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Right ah, Big brother Huang, you’ve already been promoted to Grand Elder?” Tie Mu asked nervously.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “You would know more about this once we reach the Barbarian God Sect.”

The siblings exchanged a glance and wisely stopped asking further questions.

A few days later, the little cow and Tie Qianyuan stepped out from the room.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu jumped and cheered with joy when they saw that Tie Qianyuan’s injuries had completely healed, and to top it off, his cultivation had also advanced to the Third Order Heavenly God Realm.

Tie Qianyuan dazed for a long time, listening to his two children describe the events about Prince Chen and his sworn brother Luo Ding’s death, along with Luo Ding’s Master being injured by Huang Xiaolong as a punishment. When he heard Tie Xinlan, Tie Mu, and he could enter the Barbarian God Sect and worship any Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder as their Master, his mouth was agape for a half day.

The day after Tie Qianyuan’s injuries were healed, Huang Xiaolong took Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu away from the Tie Family Fort to the Barbarian God Sect.

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s group’s current speed, the travel time from the Tie Family Fort to Barbarian God Sect would only have been a matter of one hour. However, Huang Xiaolong had slowed down his speed as much as possible, in order to avoid frightening Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu with extremely fast speed. Even so, when they arrived at the Barbarian God Sect a day later, the Father and his two children were still frightened by the speedy travel.

A long time later when the three of them recovered from their daze, they noticed the enormous mountain range in front of them and were awed. Tie Xinlan asked, “Big brother Huang, these mountains in front of us, is this the Barbarian God Mountain range?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Yes, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling should be waiting for us, come on.”

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling?

Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu didn’t know the names of the Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor and Sect Chief, so they thought that Huang Xiaolong was referring to his disciples, not paying too much attention to it.

“The Master has returned!” There was a lot of commotion among the disciples who were waiting to welcome Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Huang Xiaolong was riding on the little cow, while Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Tie Qianyuan, and the others were following them. They flew straight towards the Barbarian God Sect’s great hall.

When they were closer to the Barbarian God Sect’s great hall, Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu could see that the airspace in the distance was crowded by tens of thousands of Barbarian God Sect’s disciples!

The three of them were flabbergasted. ‘What’s going on—?!!’

Wait! Are the group of people at the very front wearing the same Elder’s robe like Zhang Ping?Are all these people Barbarian God Sect’s Elders? Also, there’s another group of people standing in front of the Elders’ group... are they?!

While the three were still in a daze, the several tens of thousands of Barbarian God Sect’s disciples, Elders, and Grand Elders knelt on their knees, sonorously lauding, "Greetings Master, we welcome Master’s return!"

Greetings Master! ...Welcome Master’s return!

Their voices shook the heavens, echoing endlessly!

Tie Qianyuan and his two children looked at their surroundings dumbly, and their gazes fell upon Huang Xiaolong.

Master?!

Then, they saw the two men at the head of the Barbarian God Sect’s group, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling taking a few steps forward and bowing in salute with utmost respect. “Greetings Young Lord!”

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling had early on received the news that Huang Xiaolong had subjugated the sea tribe, becoming the whole sea tribe’s Master! Now, Huang Xiaolong was standing at the pinnacle of Vientiane World.

Due to this,Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were actually feeling nervous standing in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled amiably and helped them up. Then he said to the rest of the Barbarian God Sect, “Rise.”

The tens of thousands of Barbarian God Sect’s disciples, Elders, and Grand Elders respectfully complied and stood up.

Huang Xiaolong gestured towards Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling, and said to Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu, “They are the Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor and Sect Chief, if you don’t want to worship any Grand Elder as your Master, you can worship either of them as your Master.”
