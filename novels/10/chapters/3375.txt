Chapter 3376: Have You Heard of the Pangu Sword

 

After leaving the Wind and Lightning Mountain Range, Huang Xiaolong shifted the space directly, and they arrived in the central region of the Northern Dragon Region in half an hour.

“Are… Are we here already?!” Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Previously, they used half a year to arrive at the Misty Immortal Country from the central region!

“This place is really lively!” Yan Bao’er yelled as the look on his face revealed his excitement.

The central region was the heart of the Northern Dragon Region. It wasn’t something other cities could compare to. Not even the Misty Immortal Country was as large as it was!

There were countless mountain ranges in the central region, and there were an endless number of immortal gates and cities located in it.

Every single immortal gate that could stand tall in the central region was tens of thousands of times stronger than the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate!

For example, the Shushan Immortal Gate had dozens of thousands of Golden Immortals!

They had thousands of Supreme Golden Immortals, and several dozen Grand Gathering Immortals.

A Golden Immortal was a powerhouse in the Misty Immortal Country, but in the central region, they were everywhere! Even so, they were the base of a power’s fighting strength, and they were of a certain status. Inner elders like Zhou Wanshan could receive quite a bit of spiritual stones and medicinal pills every year!

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls and covered the entire region. He took note of everything that happened within.

The only thing that shocked him was that he could feel more than a dozen Saint Kings!

“Is the region master the only Immortal King in the Northern Dragon Region?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu all of a sudden.

“Yes.” They had told him that on the way over to the Northern Dragon Region, but they didn’t expect him to ask again.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. He didn’t say anything about the Immortal Kings, and he simply locked on to Mu Shuihan, the old ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate.

He wasn’t an ordinary Ninth Level Grand Gathering Immortal like what Zhou Wanshan said. Instead, he had reached the peak of the late-Ninth Level Grand Gathering Immortal Realm!

He was a mere step away from the Immortal King Realm!

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head silently. Mu Shuihan’s talent was indeed terrifying. He managed to reach his current level in several short tens of thousands of years. His talent was rarely seen even in the Immortal World, and he would be comparable to Yan Bao’er! They might actually reach the Holy Emperor Realm in the future!

As for whether or not they could enter the Combined Dao Ancestor Realm, that would rely on luck.

“Senior Huang, I’ll report to my master right now. He should get the experts of the Shushan Immortal Gate over to welcome you,” Zhou Wanshan said.

As a grand elder of the Shushan Immortal Gate, Zhou Wanshan’s master was pretty influential in the faction.

“It’s alright. We’ll head over to look for Mu Shuihan directly,” Huang Xiaolong stated.

“Meeting… We’re meeting the ancestor directly?!” Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu jumped in fright. Not even their masters had the qualifications to meet Mu Shuihan whenever they liked!

When they were still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong shifted space and brought all of them to a separate space.

The immortal region they arrived at seemed boundless and immortal spiritual qi filled the place. It was exceptionally dense, and everyone felt their bodies getting heavier under the pressure.

“Who?!” A voice rang through the air the moment they arrived.

Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu nearly fell to the ground when they heard the roar. Liu Huang and Yan Bao’er fared even worse. However, a flash of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and it deflected the pressure coming from the other party’s aura.

“Huh?” 

A streak of sword light slashed at Huang Xiaolong without any warning.

The sword light was sent over by Mu Shuihan, and it contained terrifying power.

Zhou Wanshan and the others felt as though their bodies were about to be ripped apart by the wave of energy.

The rumbling of thunder filled the immortal region.

That was the power of the sword qi unleashed by someone at Mu Shuihan’s level.

Seeing as they were about to be swallowed by the strand of sword qi, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and casually pointed towards the heavens.

The sword qi dissipated as though it didn’t exist in the first place as calm descended on the lands.

Zhou Wanshan and the others saw that Huang Xiaolong held the strand of sword qi in between his fingers! Even though it was formless, he managed to grab hold of it! The sword qi that brought about endless pressure was barely a meter long when they examined it properly!

Huang Xiaolong squeezed his fingers together and shattered the sword qi instantly.

“What?!” The other party was equally as shocked. He didn’t expect the sword qi, he was so confident in, would be neutralized so easily!

A flash of light was seen as a figure appeared before Huang Xiaolong and the rest. He looked around thirty years old, and his hair was partly gray.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu fell to their knees in fright when they saw the figure. “Ancestor!” 

The person who appeared was precisely the old ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate, Mu Shuihan!

Mu Shuihan looked at them and noticed the robes on their body. He was slightly surprised to discover that they were elders of the Shushan Immortal Gate, but his gaze quickly turned to Huang Xiaolong.

“May I ask, who are you? Is there a reason behind your intrusion on my Shushan Immortal Gate?” Mu Shuihan asked. 

Even though Huang Xiaolong stopped his sword qi with ease, they were in the heart of the Shushan Immortal Gate. Mu Shuihan felt confident in taking the other party on with the countless formations to assist him.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and pointed at Mu Shuihan.

An explosion covered the area and Mu Shuihan was sent flying god knows how many miles over. When he finally crashed into the ground, another round of explosions could be heard.

Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu stared at Huang Xiaolong with their mouths agape.

Even though they had guessed that Huang Xiaolong was strong, they were still flabbergasted when he sent the old ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate flying with a single gesture.

After a long time, Mu Shuihan’s sorry figure flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s group, and he looked at the man with fear in his eyes.

“I didn’t know that venerable senior would pay a visit to my Shushan Immortal Gate. I shouldn’t have disrespected you. Please forgive me.” Mu Shuihan sucked in a cold breath and cupped his fists towards Huang Xiaolong.

“I heard that you ascended from Earth. Is that true?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Mu Shuihan was shocked as he didn’t understand the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s question. However, he eventually replied, “Yes. Senior, I ascended more than eighty-six thousand years ago.”

“Have you heard about the Pangu Axe?” Huang Xiaolong got straight to the point.

“Pangu Axe?!” Mu Shuihan was visibly taken aback.
