Chapter 3741: The Nine Cauldrons Appears

“Who are you?” Shen An asked Huang Xiaolong in a dignified manner, “What matters have you got for calling me over?”

What matters have you got? Despite sounding polite, it was clear from his tone that he was in fact, questioning Huang Xiaolong.

As Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s grand-disciple, he was called over by Huang Xiaolong for no good reason, and on top of that, he plummeted from high air, denting his image. This made Shen An extremely displeased, and if it wasn’t for the fact that he was wary of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he would have attacked Huang Xiaolong by now.

Detecting Shen An’s questioning tone towards him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother to answer. His hand reached out and grabbed Shen An from across space towards him.

Shen An panicked for a split second and was about to retaliate and break free from Huang Xiaolong’s grasp, but he discovered he couldn’t move at all.

“What are you doing?!” Shen An roared angrily in a reflex reaction.

“Lord Shen An!”

“Everyone attack, rescue Lord Shen An!” Heaven Saint Palace’s several half-step Universe Gods bellowed in anger towards the surrounding Wang Family’s experts while they themselves pounced towards Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing this, the present Wang Family also attacked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed and disinterested, as he remained seated. With a wave of his hand, he sent all the Heaven Saint Palace and Wang Family’s experts flying out, crashing down on the street outside of the Peng Family Manor. For a moment, screams and shrieks reverberated through the street.

Peng Xian and the other Gods of Creation couldn’t hide their shock.

Ignoring the terror-filled expressions on Peng Xian’s and other Gods of Creation’s faces, Huang Xiaolong directly conducted soul searching on Shen An.

Shen An and the Saint Heaven Palace’s experts had come to Nine Cauldron Land when the Nine Cauldrons were about to appear, and they did so probably under the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s order to survey the situation.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong’s soul searching came to an end.

From Shen An’s memories, Huang Xiaolong learned that he had indeed come here under the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s order to inquire about the Nine Cauldrons. Not only Shen An, but also Shen An’s master, and several of the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s personal disciples had also come to the Nine Cauldron Land under his order. However, the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s personal disciples did not travel together with Shen An.

Neither Shen An nor his master knew the whereabouts of the Heaven Saint Human Emperor.

But one thing was certain that when the Guardian Treasure Nine Cauldrons appeared, the Heaven Sage Human Emperor would appear as well.

So, Huang Xiaolong only needed to concentrate on inquiring about the Nine Cauldrons, and it would soon lead him to the Heaven Sage Human Emperor.

Huang Xiaolong then turned his attention to the many Gods of Creation in the hall.

Deterred by the strength Huang Xiaolong had shown thus far, the Gods of Creation who had come to participate in the birthday banquet had withdrawn to the sides of the hall. Their hearts tightened as Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept past them.

An overwhelming aura spread from Huang Xiaolong’s body, covering the entire Peng Family Manor, and every person within the manor crouched to the ground in fear.

With a casual wave of Huang Xiaolong’s hand, all these present Gods of Creation’s dao souls were instantly branded by his dao soul mark.

Although these God of Creation experts weren’t all that powerful, none of them had battle power above ten billion, but fortunately, there was a large number of people, over seven to eight hundred of them. With these people helping him to inquire news, Huang Xiaolong would immediately know once the Nine Cauldrons appeared.

As for Wang Kaifei, Shen An, and experts from the Saint Heaven Palace, and Wang Family, Huang Xiaolong put all of them under his control as one more person added a little bit more strength.

“Go look for clues,” Huang Xiaolong ordered after he had everyone under his control, sending everyone out to search for news and clues related to the Nine Cauldrons.

The Gods of Creation complied and each sped away after respectfully saluting Huang Xiaolong. With their departures, the Peng Family Manor was much quieter.

Peng Xian, Peng Ze, and the others stood nervously, looking ill at ease.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the nervous Peng Xian, chuckling softly, “Peng Xian, I have disturbed your birthday celebration banquet, so take this peak-grade universe origin spiritual vein as compensation.” He took out a peak-grade universe origin spiritual vein as he said so.

Peng Xian panicked hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, shaking his hands in a hurry. “No, no, Lord, you subdued Wang Kaifei and the others, saving our Peng Family from top to bottom. I, Peng Xian, am unable to repay your grace. How could I take any compensation from you? If the Lord does not mind, the Peng Family is willing to serve you with all we can!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had branded Wang Kaifei, Shen An, and the others’ dao souls with his soul mark, he had skipped the Peng Family in the process.

At Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he wasn’t afraid that any of the Peng Family would leak a word out about him.

Looking at the group of Peng Family’s experts kneeling on the floor, Huang Xiaolong told them to stand up, and he nodded his head in agreement to the Peng Family’s submission.

Upon obtaining Huang Xiaolong’s acceptance, Peng Xian was thrilled beyond words, and kowtowed in gratitude to Huang Xiaolong. Wang Kaifei, Shen An, and the others were forcefully controlled by Huang Xiaolong, whereas their Peng Family submitted voluntarily. Hence, the Peng Family’s status in front of Huang Xiaolong was naturally different.

After accepting Peng Xian’s submission, Huang Xiaolong gave him the peak-grade universe-origin spiritual vein he had taken out earlier. Peng Xian hesitated but accepted it in the end, and got down on his knees again, thanking Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong stayed at the Peng Family Manor as he waited for news. In the meantime, he began studying the Nameless Devil Mirror’s thirteen universes’ esoterics and laws.

As news of the Nine Cauldrons’ impending appearance spread, there was an influx of God of Creation experts from other lands into the Nine Cauldron Land. At any other time, experts breaking the ten billion mark rarely appear in public in a million years, but now, with the rumors of the Nine Cauldron appearing, even experts of twenty billion mark had emerged from seclusions.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about these influxes of the Gods of Creation into the Nine Cauldron Land as he was only concerned about the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s whereabouts at the moment.

Two months went by in the blink of an eye.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong suddenly received a message from Shen An.

“The Nine Cauldron has appeared! At the Big River Mountain!” Huang Xiaolong stood up immediately after reading the message.

The Big River Mountain was a famous strange mountain in the Nine Cauldron Land, and it was located a short distance from the Imperial Dragon City. On the Universe Boat at full speed, it would only take three to four days.

Without wasting time, Huang Xiaolong tore up space and left the Peng Family Manor.

After Huang Xiaolong left the Peng Family Manor, he took out the Universe Boat and sailed it to its fastest speed towards the Big River Mountain.

Under Huang Xiaolong’s effort, the Universe Boat turned into a streak of golden light, traversing through space at unbelievable speed that even experts of ten billion mark wouldn’t be able to capture the boat’s movements. Experts across these cities merely detected strong ripples in space, but it recovered almost immediately, causing them to think they probably hallucinated it.

When Huang Xiaolong finally reached the Big River Mountain three days later, the area was already crowded with experts from various forces. On the mountain peaks nearby,experts were gathered from various celestial empires and cities, and there were experts from the Nine Cauldron Land as well as other lands.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

There was a crystal clear river winding around the Big River Mountain with the waters roiling endlessly. At this time, the river surface was boiling and there were rays of auspicious light shining from the bottom of the river. This was a clear sign that a treasure was about to appear.

Huang Xiaolong was calm. He did not check out the river but spread his senses, staying alert as he waited for the Heaven Sage Human Emperor to appear.
