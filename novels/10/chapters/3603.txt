Chapter 3604 – Universe Treasure

Soon after, Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun left the hall as they returned to the Yin Yang City.

Even though they were both half step Universe Gods, the distance between the Limitless City and the Yin Yang City was great! They needed half a year in order to return.

Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to make the trade. After he finished his meal in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, he returned to the Golden Manor.

As for Lin Xian, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother troubling the man. He released Lin Xian after he left.

After entering the Golden Manor, Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion. He walked towards the eye of the grand formation in the Universe Boat before throwing in all the creation pills and herbs he obtained from Jin Hai and Wei Zhi. Universe source qi started to emerge from the formation, and he quickly absorbed them into his body.

When Huang Xiaolong was cultivating in peace, Ying Wan stood before his father in the Ying Zi Celestial Empire and wept, “Father, you have to take revenge for Wuyou!”

Ying Ze allowed Ying Wan to get to his feet before muttering, “He’s definitely backed by some other half step Universe God if he dares to kill Wuyou. Even if I personally appear, I might not be able to do anything.”

“We can’t kill him, but we can kill those related to him!” Ying Wan seemed to have thought of something and he cried out, “He brought two slaves out with him to the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, and they are in the Primal Ancestor Realm and True Saint Realm! They seem pretty important to him and he’ll definitely feel the pain when we kill them!”

Killing a Primal Ancestor and True Saint was nothing to God of Creation Realm experts like themselves.

Ying Ze nodded his head slowly, “Alright, pass down the order. As long as his slaves leave his side, kill them!”

Ying Ze’s transmission symbol trembled all of a sudden.

After scanning through the report, Ying Ze’s face lit up.

“Father, this…” Ying Wan couldn’t help but ask.

“Lin Qiankun sent me a message earlier…”

“Isn’t he part of the problem?! How dare he contact you?” Ying Wan’s expression sank when he heard that it was someone from the Yin Yang Celestial Empire.

As Ying Wuyou was killing in the city, he lumped all of them together with Huang Xiaolong. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ying Ze waved his hand slightly and sighed, “You can’t blame Wuyou’s death on them. Moreover, Lin Qiankun told me that he’s rushing back to the city right now with Lord Chen Huanzhi!”

“Lord Chen Huanzhi?!” Ying Wan jumped in joy when he heard the name. “As long as Lord Chen Huanzhi makes a move, that little b*stard is dead!”

“That’s right, at best, the man who calls himself the Blue Dragon Young Master is an ordinary half step Universe God. If I join hands with Lin Qiankun, he might be able to escape. However, with Lord Chen Huanzhi, he wouldn’t be able to resist! We’ll head over to the Yin Yang City in a few days. The moment Lord Chen Huanzhi arrives, we’ll make our move!”

“Yes, father!” Ying Wan bowed respectfully.

…

Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.

When Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Universe Boat, it was about time for them to arrive. His estimations were pretty accurate.

He summoned Tao Hang and Tao Han’er after appearing.

“Lord!” They bowed respectfully when they saw him.

After the incident in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, the fear and respect they had for him increased several folds.

“Did anything new happen recently?” Huang Xiaoming asked Tao Hang.

“Nothing much happened. The Yin Yang Celestial Empire probably sealed off the news. Nothing special happened in the past half a year, and the only noteworthy thing that happened was due to the Sleepless Sea. The Ocean Beasts have been attacking several regions around the sea, and many people were affected.”

“There were even Dao Venerables who comprehended the elements who were killed in the skirmishes!”

Huang Xiaolong continued, “Do you know the reason behind their rampage?”

The Ocean Race and the humans have always lived in peace. They hadn’t caused trouble in a long time.

Now, even Dao Venerables were falling in the battle between them! There was no way their conflict was small.

“The patriarch of the Hydra Fish Race seemed to have personally passed down the order for the ocean beasts to attack. We have no idea why he gave the order…” Tao Han’er interrupted them all of a sudden. “There seems to be many rumors going around, and there are some who said that a Son of Creation in the Limitless Celestial Empire stole a priceless treasure from the Ocean Race! There are others who said that the grandson of an important figure in the Ocean Race was killed!”

Tao Hang continued, “There are others who say that the treasure stolen was a map that indicated countless universe-level spiritual veins. The treasure map is also said to contain the location of a universe artifact!”

“Oh? Universe artifact?” Huang Xiaolong raised his brows when he heard what they said.

There were thirteen universe artifacts born in the thirteen universes, and he obtained the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires. There were ten of them left!

Before he entered the Unknown Space, he took a trip around the other universes in order to look for resources, but he failed to locate a universe artifact.

“Yes…” Tao Hang nodded. “However, we have no idea if that’s true.”

“Do you know which treasure it is?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“No.”

Falling deep into thought, Huang Xiaolong thought that it was really possible for the map to record the location of a universe artifact. However, he had no idea which it was, and Huang Xiaolong finally made up his mind to capture several God of Creation Realm experts to serve as his subordinates. His information network was really lacking after he came to the Unknown Lands.

The most important thing he had to do was to obtain universe-level spiritual veins. The universe artifact could wait as he already had the Universe Boat and the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

Two figures tore through the skies all of a sudden as they approached the city. They were Lin Qiankun and Chen Huanzhi!

Ying Ze and Ying Wan appeared from the void the moment they appeared.

“Lord Chen Huanzhi!” They cupped their fists in greeting.

Chen Huanzhi wasn’t a mere half step Universe God. He was also a marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire. The Gods of Creation in the Limitless Land wouldn’t dare to slight him no matter where they were.

Of course, his strength played a huge part in that.

Chen Huanzhi nodded slightly at the two of them.

Ying Ze and Ying Wan greeted Lin Qiankun next.

Looking at them, Lin Qiankun sighed, “I’m extremely sorry for what happened…“

Ying Ze shook his head and groweld, “This has nothing to do with the Yin Yang Celestial Empire! Everything happened because of the Blue Dragon Young Master!” Killing intent flashed in his eyes when he mentioned Huang Xiaolong.

“Let’s go meet the Blue Dragon Young Master…” Chen Huanzhi interrupted them all of a sudden.
