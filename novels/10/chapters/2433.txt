Chapter 2434: Duan Xuan’s Threat

Even though Zhang Yihui’s face was smashed into a pulp, he managed to widen his eyes to stare at his master. With his talent, he was considered the number one individual in the younger generation of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate. His talent could even be said to rival the Ancient Holy Emperor, and everyone in the Holy Gate was extremely optimistic about his growth.

Normally, his master would shower him with love. However, he actually had turned him into a pig-head with a single slap!

His master even asked him to kneel in apology!

“Why aren’t you apologizing to His Highness?” Duan Xuan glared at his disciple.

As Zhang Yihui’s heart trembled, he hastily ran over to kneel before Huang Xiaolong. Lowering his head, he cupped his fists together as humiliation, hatred, killing intent, and various other emotions flashed in his eyes.

After seeing as his disciple was kneeling before Huang Xiaolong with an unwilling expression, Duan Xuan apologized to Huang Xiaolong once again, “Your Highness, I’ve been too indulgent with my disciple. Please forgive us.”

Huang Xiaolong could only smile when he heard what Duan Xuan said. “Patriarch Duan is too courteous. However, I don’t think your disciple is sincere in his apology....”

With Huang Xiaolong’s experience, he could see that they were merely acting out a show for him to be more willing to hand over the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura.

Since he had already seen through their intentions, he didn’t mind making Zhang Yihui suffer a little bit more.

Duan Xuan was stunned at Huang Xiaolong’s sudden outburst, but he knew that he couldn’t stop now. Turning to Zhang Yihui, he roared, “D*mn disciple, why aren’t you kowtowing to His Highness?”

Kowtow?!

Zhang Yihui raised his head and stared at his master in shock. He couldn’t believe that his master actually wanted him to kowtow to Huang Xiaolong in order to express his apology!

Even if he was killed, he couldn’t be humiliated!

Zhang Yihui’s eyes turned bloodshot, but he didn’t do as his master said.

When Duan Xuan saw his unwilling expression, a frosty light flashed through his eyes. “Are you going to disobey your master?!”

Zhang Yihui ground his teeth together, and his expression was hideous. However, he eventually slammed his head into the ground. “This little one offended Your Highness, please forgive this lowly one!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t look at Zhang Yihui throughout the entire process, and he spoke to Duan Xuan. “Patriarch Duan, I have other things to attend to. Please excuse me.”

“Hold it!” Duan Xuan could no longer hold it in. Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong was about to leave, his body flashed, and he appeared before him to blocked his path.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Duan Xuan with an unwavering gaze.

“Your Highness, there isn’t a need to beat around the bush. This time, I’m here to purchase the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura you obtained. Will you please give it up? You won’t be making a loss if you agree to sell it to me.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even entertain the thought of selling it. “Sorry, I’m not selling the grandmist holy spiritual aura.”

Duan Xuan was stunned for a solid second, but he chuckled slowly. “Are you sure you won’t listen to my terms”

“Nope.”

Duan Xuan’s expression didn’t change, and he continued, “What if I give you a hundred Ancient Emperor Holy Pills?”

“A hundred Ancient Emperor Holy Pills?!” Chen Zhi and the others yelled in shock.

The Ancient Emperor Holy Pills were no ordinary low-grade holy pills. They were considered quasi mid-grade holy pills. No one knew how many holy herbs and origin herbs one needed to refine a furnace of pills, but they would only be able to obtain ten pills in a single furnace. Duan Xuan planned to take out a hundred pills in order to trade with Huang Xiaolong for the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura!

That was an astronomical price!

One had to know that an individual could increase their chances of seizing the Saint Fate with a single Ancient Emperor Holy Pill.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback for a moment. He had never expected Duan Xuan to be so generous.

When Duan Xuan saw the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he couldn’t help but snicker in his heart.

He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t moved by his price. In fact, his heart was bleeding when he offered to bring out a hundred Ancient Emperor Holy Pills. However, when he thought about the size of the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura, he knew that it was worth it.

“Patriarch Duan Xuan is really generous,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “It’s a good price, but I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again that I’m not selling it.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Everyone widened their eyes as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“Do you think it’s too little?” Duan Xuan growled, “Fine. I’ll bring out a hundred, and ten pills.”

“No.”

Duan Xuan’s expression sank. “A hundred and twenty pills. That’s the most I can offer!”

However, Huang Xiaolong shook his head resolutely.

Turning around, he led Chen Zhi and the others away.

“Stop right there!” Duan Xuan appeared before him and blocked Huang Xiaolong’s path. “Huang Xiaolong, are you really not planning to sell it to me?” In a fit of rage, the way he addressed Huang Xiaolong changed.

“Nope.”

A sneer formed on Duan Xuan’s lips, and he stared at Sun Xiang and Li Huajun. “Aren’t they the elders of the Black Inferno Race? I’ve heard that the Young Master of the Black Inferno Race was killed several days ago. The entire race has been activated to look for the killer.”

Even though their young master was killed, the two elders had decided to follow Huang Xiaolong. Anyone could guess that Huang Xiaolong was behind the killing.

“Are you threatening me?” Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned cold.

“I’m just reminding you that something might slip out of my lips. Zhan Bo was the most talented junior in the Black Inferno Race, and now that he’s dead. The leader of the race swore to hunt down the murderer and tear him to bits.” His gaze landed on Yu Ming and continued, “Isn’t this Elder Yu Ming? I never thought that you would follow Huang Xiaolong. Since Yu Fujiang was killed, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate and our Holy Lands Alliance is hunting the fugitive called Thirteen....”

A meaningful gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong in the next instant. “It seems like you’re Thirteen.... If the members of the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate learn of Thirteen’s true identity, things might get interesting.”

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had slayed a ton of disciples from various holy gates. If his identity as Thirteen really got out, the Holy Lands Alliance would definitely work together with the various holy gates to hunt down Huang Xiaolong.

It seemed as though Duan Xuan had made a ton of preparations before confronting Huang Xiaolong.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll have to trouble Patriarch Duan Xuan to do some advertisement for me.” A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face in the next instant.

He had never thought of hiding his identity as Thirteen. Since someone was threatening him with something he didn’t plan to hide, Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of amusement in his heart.

The reactions of the Holy Lands Alliance and the various holy gates were nothing to Huang Xiaolong. Since the start, he was never afraid of them.

“Are you really not afraid?” Duan Xuan sneered. “Do you think that your four masters will be able to protect you after your identity as Thirteen is revealed to the world?”

Even if they didn’t dare to kill Huang Xiaolong out in the open, they would start their retaliation in the dark. Their assassination attempts wouldl be carried out in a maniacal fashion. It wasn’t possible for Huang Xiaolong to stay cooped up in the Holy Heavens forever, right?”

“Patriarch Duan Xuan can rest at ease. You don’t have to worry about my wellbeing.” Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with Duan Xuan and he turned to leave.

A frosty light flashed in Duan Xuan’s eyes when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s departing figure.

Since he wasn’t afraid, there was no longer a need to hold back!
