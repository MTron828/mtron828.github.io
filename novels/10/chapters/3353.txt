Chapter 3354: Entering the Devil Hell

 

When Alexis was about to rush over, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and pressed down into the air. The monsters that were fighting her brother were pressed straight into the ground.

All of them turned into meat paste in an instant.

Even though they had seen how Huang Xiaolong dealt with the members of the Nande Family a moment ago, they were still shocked by his revelation of power.

In the past two days, everyone had learned how strong the monsters were. They could definitely stop ordinary bullets with their bodies, and not even the Purple Laser Cannons could suppress them! Now, Huang Xiaolong dealt with them with a single gesture!

When Alexis’s brother heard her cry, he raised his head in shock. Despair filled his heart when he thought about the monsters that surrounded him. When he turned his attention back to the monsters, he was flabbergasted to discover that they had already been destroyed!

“Brother!” After snapping back to reality, Alexis rushed over to Loos’s side.

“Alexis!” Loos hugged her tightly as she approached.

“Patriarch!” Ayi and the others gathered around him happily.

“Where are Uncle Mu Cheng and the others?” Alexis asked.

“In order to protect me, they have already…” Loos’s eyes turned red as hatred flashed through his eyes. “Laha! He was behind this! He tricked us!” 

Alexis’s expression became a little complicated, and she explained, “Brother, Laha is already dead…”

“What?! How is that possible?” Loos gasped.

“His Highness… His Highness took revenge on our behalf!” Alexis recalled how Mo Xuan addressed Huang Xiaolong, and she quickly retold the story of their run-in with Laha’s group earlier.

Loos fell to his knees and thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely after hearing her story.

Allowing him to get up, Huang Xiaolong brought them out of the valley they were in.

Emerging from the valley, everyone saw a flood of monsters rushing towards them. Fear filled their hearts for a moment, but they were quickly greeted by a sight they wouldn’t forget as long as they lived. Huang Xiaolong stomped on the ground once, and a layer of ice covered the land.

The icy blue hue was like a flood that turned every creature into an ice statue.

The entire world around them turned blue in color. Not a single monster was left roaming about and the devil qi that filled the lands was converted into cold air.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The plains that were comparable to hell turned into a silent land covered in ice.

Alexis and the others were stunned.

“Alright, you should leave the plains now…” Huang Xiaolong reminded.

Now that she had found her brother, she could return to the territory controlled by humans.

“Your Highness, are you planning to enter the Great Valley?” 

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “I’ll head over to see if I can seal up the secret region.”

After all, that was the only way to prevent anything similar from happening in the future.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong also wished to look at the source of the disturbance.

Before they left, Huang Xiaolong handed a tablet over to Alexis, and he chuckled, “Since we were fated to meet, I’ll tell you who I am. I am a grand elder of the Huang Family of the Huaxia Alliance, and this is my identity tablet. If you go to Huaxia in the future, you can look for me.”

After he spoke, he disappeared into the distance with a single step.

Everyone felt their brains buzzing in confusion when they looked at Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure.

“Grand elder of the Huang Family?!” Ife’s face was filled with doubt.

He wasn’t the only one. The others were equally as confused.

“Anyway, we should leave the plains before deciding on anything,” Loos said.

Nodding their heads in agreement, all of them quickly left the plains.

All of them were afraid that they would run into the monsters on the way back. However, they couldn’t believe their eyes when they realized that the entire region was frozen solid.

When they touched the creatures that had turned into ice sculptures, the creatures just crumbled into dust.

“Isn’t he a little too strong?!” Loos gasped.

Alexis thought about what Huang Xiaolong said earlier about ancient immortals and she thought to herself, “Could it actually be true?!”

…

When that was happening, Huang Xiaolong saw the Great Valley that had appeared in the earth.

The Great Valley was hundreds of miles wide, and devil qi poured out endlessly. Ugly monsters that emitted black smog appeared along with the devil qi.

One of them rushed towards Huang Xiaolong after detecting his presence, and it roared angrily.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t do a thing as purple flames emerged from his body. Before the monster could enter a hundred-meter radius around Huang Xiaolong, it was incinerated to bits.

Huang Xiaolong continued to venture deeper into the crack.

The valley was practically bottomless, and Huang Xiaolong sank thousands of meters into the land. When he finally arrived at the bottom, he saw a giant hole that resembled the mouth of a giant monster as weird creatures poured out from it.

Huang Xiaolong turned into a streak of purple flame that went straight into the hole, burning everything around him into ash.

When he entered, Huang Xiaolong was greeted by a world of red. Other than the monsters and the devil qi, everyone was a dark crimson color.

Monsters charged towards his location in an endless tide.

All of them roared happily as excitement filled their eyes.

“Get out there and eat the humans! They taste great!” 

“The devil lord has spoken! We’ll kill all the humans!” 

Lord? Huang Xiaolong frowned. He looked at the monsters who were charging towards him and he casually sent out a punch. A terrifying wave of energy appeared and crushed every monster in his way.

The energy wave traveled through the world of red and after a long time, it finally arrived at the edge of the world.

A massive explosion ensued, and the entire secret region trembled. Huang Xiaolong’s punch seemed to blow a hole straight through it.

“Who dares to act so arrogantly in my Devil Hell?!” An enraged roar rang through the skies as a frightening aura filled the skies. 

“Huh?” Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised. The creature that revealed its aura was at the Ninth Level Soul Condensation Realm!

One had to know that even Chen Haoguang was only a Sixth Level Soul Condensation Realm expert.

However, Huang Xiaolong raised his arm casually to drag the creature over to himself.

The creature stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief as fear filled its eyes. “Are you an ancient immortal?! Didn’t the devil lords say that the ancient immortals have already gone to the immortal world?! There shouldn’t be any ancient immortals left in the world!” 

Huang Xiaolong didn’t say a word as he casually sent a ray of purple light into the creature’s body.
