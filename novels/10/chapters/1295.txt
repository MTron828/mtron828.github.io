“Is this really the Yellow Springs water?” The little cow asked with a deep frown, as she looked at the running yellow-colored water on both sides of the road. She was doubtful whether this was the genuine Yellow Springs water.

According to what she knew, the Yellow Springs water was one of Hell’s Spirit World’s most horrifying things, and it could be seen rarely in the Spirit World.’ How could the Yellow Springs Water appear here in the Devil Prison Mountain?’

Not to mention, this Yellow Springs water actually gave her a very scary feeling. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“This Yellow Springs water is... very scary?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow nodded heavily and said, “Yes. Forget Ancient God Realm cultivators, even high-level Ancestor God Realm masters would melt into nothing if they were to fall into the Yellow Springs water, and their godheads would be no exception to this.”

Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others’ faces tightened nervously at the little cow’s explanation, as the Yellow Springs water seemed to be terrible.

“Master, this Yellow Springs water is already terrible, even more so, the further one travels on this Yellow Springs Road, the more dangerous it gets, even for high-level Ancestor God Realm masters. Therefore, it’s better that I go alone hereafter, and get the Yellow Springs Devil’s Treasure.” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng said.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated, then agreed, “Alright then. Feng Er, you accompany Xu Baisheng, and we will wait for you around here. If something happens, contact us with the communication talisman.”

“Yes.” Both Xu Baisheng and Feng Er acknowledged respectfully. They sped away after they saluted Huang Xiaolong.

Hence, those who remained behind picked up a mountain nearby and dug a cave all the way until it’s belly. After laying a concealing formation at the entrance, they cultivated as they waited for Xu Baisheng and Feng Er to return.

...

Inside the freshly dug cave, Huang Xiaolong took out one of the Chaos Yin Spirit Fruits.

Usually, it was considered more beneficial to consume the Chaos Yin Spirit Fruit, when refined into a Yin Spirit Divine Pill, but at this moment, Huang Xiaolong didn’t have that kind of luxury. The most important thing for him was to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm as soon as possible.

Since his cultivation had increased in recent years, there was an urgency for Huang Xiaolong to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm.

Moreover, almost two thousand kinds of herbs and materials were needed for refining the Yin Spirit Divine Pill. To top it off, Huang Xiaolong didn’t have much time to collect all of these materials.

Still, even on its own, the Chaos Yin Spirit Fruit’s medicinal energy was potent, and Huang Xiaolong was cautious about not swallowing too many of them at once. The moment he swallowed one Chaos Yin Spirit Fruit, a pure yin energy flooded out from it, and rushed to all corners of his body.

Huang Xiaolong swiftly circulated his godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, making every effort to absorb the Chaos Yin Spirit Fruit’s energy.

He had also given one of the Chaos Yin Spirit Fruits to the little cow, and she was refining the fruit not far from Huang Xiaolong, while Gui Yi and the others were guarding near the entrance.

...

Outside was deathly quiet.

Dense corrosive devil qi floated in the air. From time to time, there were sounds of whistling winds over the mountain. Most likely, these were Ancestor God Realm masters who were headed towards the Yellow Springs Road.

In the blink of an eye, one month went by as they waited.

In this one month, Huang Xiaolong had refined three Chaos Yin Spirit Fruits. Although he was not able to advance to peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, he was quite satisfied with the result of his cultivation, as he sensed the vigority of his godforce.

However, one month went by yet the void devil beast Xu Baisheng and Feng Er had yet to return. Huang Xiaolong did not get any response when he tried to contact them through the communication talisman. This made him increasingly anxious.

Another ten days passed, as Huang Xiaolong refined another Chaos Yin Spirit Fruit, and still there was no news from Xu Baisheng or Feng Er. This made him restless to the point, where he couldn’t calm down to cultivate any longer.

Did something happen to them?

Huang Xiaolong looked at the dense corrosive devil qi as he stood at the cave’s mouth. He finally decided to enter the Yellow Springs Road to find them, but suddenly, a terrifying energy rushed in their direction from the horizon.

At Huang Xiaolong’s current late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm strength, he felt a dangerous and destructive power, despite the distance between them. Only a battle between a Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm and above could produce such a destructive power.

In a split second, Huang Xiaolong could judge that this destructive energy was coming from the Yellow Springs Road.

“It’s Sister Feng Er!” Gui Yi exclaimed with certainty as he sensed a familiar supple ghost godforce.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank, ‘something really happened.’

What to do? What to do? The question repeated in Huang Xiaolong’s mind as he flew into the air.

“Xiaolong, don’t act on impulse.” The little cow chased after Huang Xiaolong and admonished, “Even if it is Feng Er, that doesn’t mean something bad has happened to her. With her strength, there are only a handful of people in Void Sky World who are capable of injuring her. She can extricate herself, even if her opponent is the Short Blade Gate’s Chief or the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Head.

Huang Xiaolong stopped, and calmed down.

“Also, given the strength of her opponent, it would be useless if we go over there.” The little cow added.

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply. There was a deep harrowing feeling of helplessness inside his heart. Strength! His cultivation time was too short when compared to others, and his strength was too lacking.

Perhaps, he had little to no opponents amongst the younger generation in the neighboring world surfaces based on his current strength, but against older generation cultivators like the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Head, his strength was far from being enough.

‘Give him a hundred years! A hundred years—!’ He believed that within a hundred years he could reach the heights of the Xiao Family’s Ancestor, Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Head, and the likes. Maybe, he could even surpass them.

Huang Xiaolong could suddenly feel a sake from his communication talisman. He quickly took it out, and his divine sense swept inside. He then said to the little cow, “We’re leaving the Devil Prison Mountain!” With that, he leaped onto the little cow’s back.

Leave the Devil Prison Mountain?

The little cow was surprised, but did not hesitate. She disappeared in a streak of purple lightning with Huang Xiaolong on her back, and headed straight to the outer edge of Devil Prison Mountain. Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San were right behind them.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong and the others had left the Devil Prison Mountain, but he did not leave the Void Sky World. Instead, he headed to the remote residence that he had purchased prior to leaving for the Clear Spirit World.

Earlier, he had received a message from the void devil beast Xu Baisheng that he and Feng Er would find a chance to escape from the Devil Prison Mountain, and then meet up with Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Huang Xiaolong could only force himself to wait patiently inside the remote residence. Fortunately, this time, Feng Er and Xu Baisheng did not make him wait for long.

After seeing that both of them had returned safely, Huang Xiaolong sighed in relief, inwardly.

“Are you both alright?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng grinned, “Fortunately Feng Er was there with me, or I really would have died on the Yellow Springs Road.”

Then Xu Baisheng and Feng Er recounted that they had ran into the Yama Gates’ Gate Chief, when they were at the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure.

Even though they had managed to escape, void devil beast Xu Baisheng had suffered two sword cuts, but luckily, he was not injured too heavily. Despite this, Xu Baisheng gritted his teeth hatefully, and complained at the mention of the two sword cuts, “His granny, wait a few years after my strength recovers, I’ll come and flip his Yama Gate’s Chief upside down.”

But the little cow’s hoof greeted Xu Baisheng’s head, “You can say this again after a few years, where’s the Yellow Spring Archdevil’s Treasure?”

A light flashed from Feng Er’s hand as she took out a fist-sized black cube, that was exuding shocking death qi and devil qi.

“Manor Lord, this is the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure!” Feng Er respectfully presented the black cube to Huang Xiaolong with both hands.

Huang Xiaolong was beyond delighted. Earlier when Xu Baisheng had said that they had run into the Yama Gates’ Gate Chief, he had naturally assumed that the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure was gone, but Feng Er and Xu Baisheng had succeeded in getting it!
