The instant that hundred zhang demonic beast’s body condensed into a real body, a giant palm was already slamming down on Huang Xiaolong.

Demonic qi surged like there was no end to it.

Before this overwhelming giant palm formed from condensed demonic qi, everything lost its color, nothing but despairing gray remained.

However, Huang Xiaolong was prepared, his figure jumped several times backward.

In less than a breath’s time, the horrifying gray giant palm struck the place where Huang Xiaolong was standing earlier. Space shattered and the ground quaked as if a piece of sky was falling. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As if it didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be able to dodge its attack, its action paused slightly in surprise before its palm swept to the side in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

Everything was sent flying. This mere sweep seemed to push everything out of this gray space, leaving a vacuum behind it.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned grim as he watched the giant beast palm coming at him. But this time, he did not dodge. Black and blue twin dragons flew out from his body and the soul transformation happened in an instant. The force in his dantian churned, true immortal essence fire burst out from his palms as Huang Xiaolong countered the giant beast palm.

Rumble—!

An ear-splitting boom resounded.

Destructive shockwaves swept out in all directions, the whole gray space shook like it was on the verge of collapsing.

The terrifying shockwaves were rushing out in Huang Xiaolong’s direction, so Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi swiftly wound its golden body around Huang Xiaolong in protection. With a turn, true dragon qi erupted from Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s body, dispersing the shockwaves.

Huang Xiaolong quickly retreated even further.

The hundred zhang demonic beast was surprised once again.

Based on the force of its sweeping palm, it was more than sufficient to kill the average perfection stage Tenth Order God Realm masters, yet it failed to kill a little guy that had just recently broken through to Tenth Order God Realm?

“Little guy, I, Hundred Spirits Beast King, have swept over the galaxy unhindered for thousands of years, and have seen countless talents and geniuses, but this is the first time a human managed to surprise me.” That hundred zhang demonic beast no longer attacked, standing loftily with its arms across its chest, laughing at Huang Xiaolong.

Hundred Spirits Beast King!

This hundred zhang demonic beast resembled the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s actual physique before it was dismembered and sealed.

Of course, this ‘body’ was formed by a remnant of its will using the demonic qi coming from its arms.

Even so, its strength was formidable.

Huang Xiaolong maintained an aloof expression facing the other side, waiting to hear what this remnant of the Hundred Spirits Beast King wanted to say.

The Hundred Spirits Beast King went on, “Little guy, since you’re capable of reaching this space, it is fated. Are you interested in being my disciple? I, Hundred Spirits Beast King have never taken in any disciples while I was alive, if you’re willing to be my disciple, I will pass to you everything I know. Including the Hundred Spirits Demonic Art.” Its voice carried a hint of temptation.

Any average person would be jumping in ecstasy right now... Becoming the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s disciple, how many cultivators could only dream of something like this, especially the demonic beast clan masters. Amongst the demonic beast clans, the Hundred Spirits Beast King was hailed as the Holy Ancestor.

Unfortunately, the person it was trying to tempt was Huang Xiaolong.

“This is the demonic beast clan’s Disorienting Mind Art.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi spoke, his voice echoing in the air.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

This Disorienting Mind Art was ineffective on him. His soul’s clarity had reached a shocking state, not easily influenced or affected.

Huang Xiaolong slightly tilted his head, looking directly at the hundred zhang demonic beast. His mouth curved into a cold sneer, “I know very well that your sole purpose is to have me help you undo the seal, releasing your arms, right? You’d better quit this subpar pretense, Hundred Spirits Beast King. If this was your actual body, I’d think twice before doing anything, however, this is merely a body condensed through your will, therefore...!”

A sharp light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, “Today, you’re fated to be subjugated and absorbed by me!”

Huang Xiaolong’s words were not bravado, if he was facing the true Hundred Spirits Beast King, he’d be thinking twice, even thrice, before fighting with it, but the other side was only a temporary body formed through its will. Not to mention the fact that he had the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi helping him, Huang Xiaolong was confident they could defeat this monster and refine it!

The hundred zhang demonic beast was greatly angered by this puny human that dared to ridicule him, its palm came slamming down once again at alarming speed. Gray demonic qi roiled and rumbled in the space.

“You little runt, even if I’m merely a body condensed out of will, killing you is as easy as snapping my fingers. Don’t think I can’t kill you just because you have that little dragon protecting you!”

“Hundred Spirits Demonic Art!”

The hundred zhang tall demonic beast attacked Huang Xiaolong again, and the attack this time was several times more powerful than its earlier attacks. Overwhelming force fell down, cutting off all of Huang Xiaolong’s paths of retreat.

Huang Xiaolong was calm, unperturbed as the Black Tortoise Divine Armor on his body released a blinding snowy-blue light, shrouding his immediate surroundings. At the same time, a bright light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s hands as two snowy-blue longswords appeared, flying straight at the hundred zhang tall demonic beast.

In an instant, the rolling demonic qi that neared Huang Xiaolong was instantly burned by the bright snowy-blue light. Meanwhile, the two longswords shot through the thick layer of demonic qi, piercing through the hundred zhang tall demonic beast’s chest.

A thunderous scream rang in the gray space.

“This, what kind of fire is this?!”

“Impossible, how can there be a fire that could break past my Hundred Spirits demonic qi!”

The hundred zhang tall demonic beast roared endlessly in fury, dissatisfaction, and disbelief.

Although the Black Tortoise Divine Fire was one of the four galaxies’ four great divine fires, only a handful of people had seen it. Therefore, even the Hundred Spirits Beast King who terrorized the galaxies for thousands of centuries in the past was experiencing one of the four great divine fires for the first time. This was also the reason why the it had ignored the bright fluttering fire on Huang Xiaolong’s armor.

Moreover, the Hundred Spirits Beast King had absolute confidence in its qi being the world’s strongest demonic qi, not even a divine artifact could break past it, which was why it did not dodge the two fiery longswords.

Huang Xiaolong’s confidence increased watching the divine fire longswords successfully pierce through the demonic beast’s chest. Without a second delay, Huang Xiaolong manipulated the longswords for a second attack.

“You, this, this is one of the four great divine fires?!” The hundred zhang tall demonic beast dodged in panic, suddenly shouting.

Between heaven and earth, only the mythical four divine fires were able to burn through his Hundred Spirits demonic qi!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother to answer, continuing with his attacks.

As long as this demonic body was destroyed, the subsequent refinement of the arms would be less troublesome.

Although Huang Xiaolong ignored the question, the Hundred Spirits Beast King felt that it had guessed correctly, that snow-white fire, with a hint of the icy-blue, was one of the four divine fires. Its fury rose, interlaced with fear.

It had assumed that no one would be able to hurt this body formed from its Hundred Spirits demonic qi, yet...!

Under Huang Xiaolong’s fiery longswords’ attacks, it could only dodge and retreat in a sorry state.

“Attack its head!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said to Huang Xiaolong using voice transmission. Huang Xiaolong immediately understood his intention.

Since this hundred zhang tall demonic body was formed out of will, then, as long as they destroyed its will, this demonic body would naturally dissipate. Its will was located in the head.

But, even though Huang Xiaolong’s Black Tortoise Divine Fire longswords were able to deal severe damage to the Hundred Spirits demonic body, destroying its will was a little more difficult.

This battle went on for several hours.

Destructive forces colliding inside the gray space. This destructive force was powerful enough to turn an average early Tenth Order God Realm into ash.

Fortunately, those colliding destructive forces did not leak out from the grey space, otherwise, the ruckus in the mountain range above would have attracted the Golden World Mountain Alliance’s masters.
