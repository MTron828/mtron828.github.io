Therefore, Huang Xiaolong briefly recounted the highlights of his journey to the Clear Spirit World from the past few years; for example, finding the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit at the Devil Prison Mountain, and the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks.

He also mentioned the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and also the events at the Clear Spirit World’s Ghost Manor, where he took the crystal ball test. He told them that he had passed the test and has now become the new Ghost Manor Lord.

Huang Xiaolong told Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor about everything, except the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure. It was not because he didn’t trust his Masters, but because he believed that the less people knew about it the better it was.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor sighed in envy more than once, as they heard Huang Xiaolong recount his Journey to the Clear Spirit world. Of course, they were happy for Huang Xiaolong, but his journey sounded very interesting that it made them a bit envious.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong finished his story, and a sigh sounded from Golden Brow Ancestor. “Your luck is really heaven-defying to the extreme, then again, great fortune is also a kind of talent. We’re happy that you can have such adventures.”

Blood Knife Ancestor grinned, “Your good luck has exceeded our imagination, it seems like you’d be able to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm within a thousand years!”

Both old men felt comforted by the progress of their disciple.

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded, ‘A thousand years?’ Inwardly,he shook his head wryly.

On further thought, he could understand that a thousand years was still an astounding cultivation speed for breaking through to Ancestor God Realm from alate-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor couldn’t be blamed for feeling comforted as they thought of this.

Huang Xiaolong knew that his two masters would laugh until their tummies ached, if he told them his actual plan of breaking through to a high-level Ancestor God realm within a hundred years. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong did not say anything.

“Xiaolong, we’ll depart to the sea tribes’ city in two months. In the meantime, stay in your Cosmos Palace and cultivate diligently, and strive to raise your strength further.” Blood Knife Ancestor said. “Although you’ve broken through to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, there is still a gap in strength, when compared to the Guo Family’s Guo Jun. We have obtained certain information that Guo Jun broke through to the Tenth Order Ancient God Realm more than a decade back.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had reached the late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, which had greatly astounded Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, in their eyes, Huang Xiaolong’s current strength was still several miles behind Guo Jun’s.

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s extraordinary battle prowess, both of them believed it was impossible for him to defeat someone that had broken through to Tenth Order Ancient God Realm more than a decade ago.

Not forgetting there was an even more outstanding sea tribes’ genius Feng Yingying.

Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly at Blood Knife Ancestor’s worry, "Alright, I know, two Masters please rest assured. I promise to cultivate diligently for the next two months."

Already a Tenth Order Ancient God Realm master more than a decade ago?

Although this Guo Jun surprised Huang Xiaolong, he did not put Guo Jun in his eyes.

"Still, you do not need to feel depressed about this. Your overall cultivation time is shorter than Guo Jun’s, therefore, it is normal that there is a gap between the two of your levels and strength. Based on your current late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, I guess you can battle the average late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm, or even peak late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm masters." Blood Knife Ancestor went on, "So, you can still battle Guo Jun, and exchanging a hundred moves with him will not be a problem."

Huang Xiaolong smiled and said, “Second Master, don’t you worry, when the time comes, I will last a hundred moves.”

Golden Brow Ancestor said, “You have this confidence, so we’re reassured.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After a while, Huang Xiaolong bid farewell to his two Masters and returned to his Cosmos Palace.

There was a softness in Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s eyes, as they watched Huang Xiaolong’s back when he left because they felt comforted and satisfied with their disciple.

“It has only been ten years, ten years ah, this kid has already broken through to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm.” Blood Knife Ancestor sighed. Even now, he could not believe it.

Huang Xiaolong had only been a Fortune Gate for a decade. A decade ago, he hadn’t even broken through to Ancient God Realm, yet he had already advanced to the late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm in ten years!

This cultivation speed made Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s liver quivered in astonishment.

Golden Brow Ancestor suddenly said, “Maybe, this kid doesn’t need a thousand years to reach the Ancestor God Realm. Maybe, he could do it in four to five hundred years.”

Blood Knife Ancestor was shocked by this comment, however, he nodded in agreement a second later.

Even though it was hard to believe it, it seemed like Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed could actually make this a possibility.

“However, with Xiaolong’s current strength, he won’t be a match against Guo Jun and Feng Yingying during the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.” Blood Knife Ancestor said. There was undisguised worry in his tone.

A sharp light glinted in Golden Brow Ancestor’s eyes, “I hope that the sea tribes are tactful enough as not to cross the line, or I will teach them a lesson that my disciple is not someone they can bully as they like!”

While his two masters were contemplating as to how Huang Xiaolong would fare at the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, Huang Xiaolong headed back to his Cosmos Palace. On the way, he passed by Li Lu’s Brimming Snow Palace, and went over to see her. However, her place was quiet and empty. Li Lu had yet to return.

Huang Xiaolong could only head back to Cosmos Palace and enter seclusion.

Every night, Huang Xiaolong would swallow thirty chaos spiritual pills refined by the Pill Blending Tower, whether it was the Sky King Buddha Dragon Holy Pills, or Dark Devil Sea Divine Pills, or Ninth-Layer Moon Tyrant Divine Pills, or other chaos spiritual pills from the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure.

While he cultivated, the four divine fires’ spirits, azure dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, and black tortoise devoured the chaos spiritual energy falling from the void. Coupled with the medicinal energy from thirty chaos spiritual pills, the speed of his three supreme godheads to absorb energy had increased once again.

On the other hand,the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell rained pure moon essence and nourished his soul.

When dawn would arrive, Huang Xiaolong would switch to tempering his True Dragon Physique with the Eidolon Rocks. At times, he would practice his sword skills in the morning, at other times, he would alternate between practicing with Golden Brow Ancestor’s Metal Domain Canon or Blood Knife Ancestor’s Blood Knife Technique.

During this time, he also reforged the Godly Mt. Xumi and Phaseless Divine Boat with Eidolon Crystalline Rocks and also the Ancestor God’s Buddha bones he had bought from the Stone Buddha City, thus greatly improving their power and durability.

Due to time constraints, Huang Xiaolong didn’t manage to reforge his Mulberry Sword, and other artifacts. Alas, he could only wait until the God of the Sea Ceremony ends.

In the blink of an eye, two months went by.

Under the effects of thirty chaos spiritual pills per night, Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose at a startling rate. Although he hadn’t yet advanced to the peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, nonetheless he was much closer to advancing, and not to forget his physical body’s sturdiness after repeatedly tempering it using the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks.

On this day, as Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his Cosmos Palace, he saw the little cow sun-basking on the roof, while crunching on a Golden Phoenix Pavilion Grand Elder’s godhead. From time to time, she would tilt her head as if enjoying some beautiful scenery.

Sensing Huang Xiaolong’s presence, the little cow got up and stretched lazily, then walked to Huang Xiaolong’s side with her tail swinging, and exclaimed, “The ‘sun’ is finally out!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the sun high in the sun, then at the little cow. He kicked the little cow, and scolded, “The sun has been out for long! C’mon, we are headed to the Assembly Shrine.”

A while later, the two of them reached the Assembly Shrine. Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and Fortune Gate Chief Zhu Yi also arrived subsequently.

Since Black Ice Ancestor had taken Li Lu to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, neither of them were there.

But, other than the Ancestors and Fortune Gate Chief, Wang Wei and Zhu Feng were also present.

A few years had passed since Huang Xiaolong had last seen Wang Wei. It looked like Wang Wei had grown stronger, on the other hand, Zhu Feng didn’t seem to have changed much, was it?
