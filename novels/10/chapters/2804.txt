Chapter 2805: Primal Ancestor!

Wang Jin’s expression was weird as he realized that the Immemorial Immortal Cave wasn’t where it should have been.

“Why can’t I feel any traces of the Immemorial Dao Venerable?! There isn’t the slightest trace of immemorial grand dao energy to be felt!” Wang Jin opened his Blue Heaven Eye instantly to survey the area. However, he failed to find the immortal cave no matter how hard he tried.

“This isn’t possible!” Yi Beihang’s expression fell. “There’s no way for Huang Xiaolong to move the immortal cave! Look around and locate it!”

An hour later, the few of them scoured several trillion miles around the location Yi Xiaotang had pointed out and realized that there were no traces of the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

Yi Beihang’s expression fell.

“Don’t tell me he really managed to take it away…” Wang Jin guessed.

Yi Beihang shook his head. “He’s just a True Saint. There’s no way for him to move it about! The only way is for a Dao Venerable to help him!”

“Dao Venerable?!” Wang Jin muttered, “Didn’t Xiaotang mention something about a formations master backing up Cangqiong Sacred Land?”

Yi Beihang was stunned for a second, but his expression soon returned to normal. He chuckled in amusement. “Eminent Elder Wang Jin, do you really believe the rumors out there? How can a tiny sacred land like them obtain the backing of a formations master? Even our Blue Heaven Creed couldn’t produce one!”

Wang Jin nodded slowly. If he had to be honest with himself, he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong could find the backing of such an impressive figure too.

“How else are we supposed to explain the disappearance of the immortal cave?” Wang Jin asked all of a sudden.

From what Yi Xiaotang had said, the cave should have been located right where they were standing!

Narrowing his eyes, Yi Beihang growled, “Let’s take a trip down to Cangqiong Sacred Land!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had escaped with the Immemorial Immortal Cave, Cangqiong Sacred Land couldn't be moved, right?!

Kind of.

When the group rushed all the way over, they saw that Cangqiong Scared Land was indeed still around, but there wasn’t a single sign of life.

Cangqiong Old Man, Fei Yanzi, and the others had long since disappeared. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Even the Primal Ancestors of the Cangqiong Alliance couldn’t be found anywhere!

Yi Beihang’s expression turned extremely ugly.

He hadn’t experienced anger in a long time, and the continuous stream of irritation caused a seed of rage to sprout in his heart.

Wang Jin’s expression didn’t differ by much.

Originally, he was planning to obtain a disciple whose talent stood firmly in the top tier of the Divine Tuo Holy World with eight high-order Saint Fates along with the treasury of the Immemorial Dao Venerable. However, Huang Xiaolong was nowhere to be found!

“Contact Xu Dong and order him to seal the entire Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. No one is allowed to leave! Report to us immediately if they manage to find traces of Huang Xiaolong, and my Blue Heaven Creedwill reward them heavily!” Yi Beihang growled.

Xu Dong was the patriarch of the Saint Devil Sacred Land, and he was Xu Jian’s father. He was also known as the strongest expert in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

Wang Jin nodded slowly.

That was the only thing they could do.

Very quickly, Yi Beihang’s order arrived at every corner of the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

Countless sacred lands trembled when they heard the news.

Regardless of whether it was the fact that Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain the Immemorial Treasury or the fact that the Blue Heaven Creed was putting out a large reward to search for Huang Xiaolong, every faction that had the ability to search for him sent out countless experts.

It was especially so for the Saint Devil Scared Land as Xu Dong went crazy and used the full strength of the sacred land to search for Huang Xiaolong.

As the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave was locked down, the Immemorial Immortal Cave was hovering in the void in the midst of chaos.

Sitting in the middle of the formation eye in the Immemorial Immortal Cave, Huang Xiaolong devoured the immemorial grand dao energy at a terrifying pace.

A massive dao spiritual] vein could be seen swirling about him, and it was precisely the Scarlet Dragon Grand Dao Spiritual Vein the Saint Devil Prince had set his eyes on the moment he had entered the treasury.

Like a massive scarlet dragon, the spiritual vein swam around Huang Xiaolong and released scarlet dragon grand dao energy from time to time.

The Immemorial Qilins were standing a distance away as they shot beams of absolute frost and absolute blaze into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Of course, the two of them were merely using the energy to temper Huang Xiaolong’s body. With the assistance of the absolute flame and frost, Huang Xiaolong’s Huang Long Bloodline had a possibility of evolving when he entered the Primal Ancestor Realm. He would be able to control both powers as though they were his own!

If anyone else tried to do something like that, there would be absolutely no chance of succeeding. Even if they had the strongest bloodline the Divine Tuo Holy World had to offer, their body would never be strong enough! The only reason Huang Xiaolong could do it was because he had the bloodline of the God of Creation!

Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, and the others were cultivating outside the treasury.

It went without saying that Fu Daosheng and the others failed to break the formation. They were trapped in the Immemorial Immortal Cave, and after Huang Xiaolong eliminated half of those standing against him, he summoned his Huang Long Bloodline in an attempt to convince Zhou Hong and the others to serve him.

The moment the bloodline of the God of Creation appeared, nearly everyone present agreed to submit. Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered convincing those who refused, and he shattered their bodies and kept their dao souls.

With the Immemorial Qilins and the half-step Dao Venerables, Huang Xiaolong had traveled back to Cangqiong Sacred Land and brought everyone away.

Tearing through the void, Huang Xiaolong had brought the Immemorial Immortal Cave to the depths of the chaotic void in order to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm.

In the blink of an eye, ten years passed.

On a fine day, the space the Immemorial Immortal Cave was in started to tremble as though a fearsome beast was about to appear.

The chaotic streams around the cave fluctuated, and they seemed to be escaping from where the Immemorial Immortal Cave was.

As the storms became stronger and stronger, traces of purplish-gold lightning appeared from another space. The purple gold lightning was the Resurrection Lightning every True Saint had to overcome before turning into a Primal Ancestor.

There was a trace of a black flame hidden in the lightning, and it was even more terrifying than the purple gold lightning. The flame was the Black Lotus Flame that would only appear during the creation of a world!

Like flowers blooming in their prime, the flame burned brighter and brighter and the aura it emitted could threaten Dao Venerables!

The purple lightning very quickly surrounded a trillion miles around the Immemorial Immortal Cave, and the black lotus flame flickered unceasingly.

Cangqiong Old Man, Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, Fei Yanzi, and the others stared at the incoming tribulation with their hearts palpitating.

“Xiaolong… Xiaolong is about to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm!” Cangqiong Old Man gasped in surprise.

Fu Daosheng and the others stared at the tribulation clouds in disbelief.

“Resurrection lightning and black lotus flame?! Shouldn’t these only appear when one is entering the Dao Venerable Realm?” Zhou Hong’s jaws dropped.

“No… the black lotus flame will not appear even if one enters the Dao Venerable Realm…” Fu Daosheng shook his head slowly.
