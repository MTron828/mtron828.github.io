Chapter 3201: Mysterious Magician

When Xue Jian saw that the Sixth Princess had arrived in time, his expression sank. He didn’t think that she would be able to arrive so quickly. It seemed as though her power of space had already reached the major completion stage!

Zeng Ying’s strength had already surpassed his expectations.

“Sixth Princess.” Xue Jian greeted her, but he didn’t seem respectful in the least. “According to the rules of the celestial empire, I have every right to search anyone who enters the sacred land. I wonder why Sixth Princess plans to stop me…”

In the Blazing Dragon World, in the three celestial empires, there were only a handful of people capable of speaking so disrespectfully to Zeng Ying. Xue JIan was one of them, and as the strongest marshal in the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire with control over the entire army, he definitely had the qualifications to do so.

“The Purple Lightning Young Master is my guest. I’ll take responsibility if he does anything untowards the celestial empire!” Zeng Ying muttered with a nonchalant expression.

Turning to the generals and troops Xue Jian brought along with him, she sneered, “According to the rules of the celestial empire, none of you are allowed to plunder any resources when you inspect newcomers. Xue Jian, do you really think that you can violate the rules of the celestial empire with your status as the grand marshal?”

Zeng Ying might have said that with a straight face, but the generals serving under Xue Jian were terrified.

Xue Jian was able to stand his ground in front of the Sixth Princess, but they were mere pawns in the game of chess! All of them were not as fearless as Xue Jian!

“Plunder resources?” Xue Jian sighed. “I didn’t see anything like it? Are you referring to the spiritual herbs? Are you able to prove that we obtained it from him?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Xue Jian’s shamelessness was on a whole new level. He knew full well that she saw everything that happened on the Purple Lightning Peak.

He personally supervised them as they grabbed everything they could when searching through the Purple Lightning Peak, but he was lying to Zeng Ying’s face about it.

He was even daring enough to question her about it!

Zeng Ying widened her eyes in shock and it was true that she couldn’t prove that the herbs belonged to Huang Xiaolong.

Before she could speak, Huang Xiaolong shook his head and chuckled in amusement. “There’s no need to worry about it. These low-leveled herbs are of no use to me. These beggars can just have them, anyway, they don’t cost too much.”

Zeng Ying stared at Huang Xiaolong with a look of astonishment.

In stark contrast, Xue Jian’s expression fell.

Beggars?!

Zeng Ying chuckled in response after composing herself. “Young Master is really generous. Why don’t we take our leave?”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and followed her into the Extreme Heaven Sacred Land.

After thinking about it, Xue Jian didn’t stop him from leaving. After all, the Sixth Princess had personally shown up. Even if he tried to stop Huang Xiaolong with brute force, it wasn’t as though he could defeat the princess.

His expression turned serious when he saw their leaving figures. The Sixth Princess’ strength was no longer something he could match up to. The single attack she used to stop him earlier allowed him to feel the difference in their strength.

As the two of them disappeared, Xue Jian waved his hand and snorted in anger, “We’re leaving too!”

In an instant, the entire army soared through the air and left.

The experts standing around ready to watch the fight between Huang Xiaolong and Xue Jian were disappointed. They couldn’t help but sigh as they left the area.

…

After entering the Extreme Heaven Sacred Land, Zeng Ying brought Huang Xiaolong directly over to her palace.

Along the way, she apologized profusely to him. “Young Master, I am extremely sorry that you ran into trouble the moment you entered the celestial empire.”

“I’ll compensate you for all the herbs they stole from your mountain peak...”

Huang Xiaolong laughed in response. “Sixth Princess is too kind. The herbs they stole were useless to me, and they won’t be worth much.”

“Alright. I won’t be polite then.” Zeng Ying revealed a brilliant smile, and it was a smile that could soothe everyone who saw it. At the same time, she exuded a trace of nobility and charm.

The two of them quickly arrived at Zeng Ying’s palace, as the princess who wielded the greatest amount of power in the celestial empire, her palace failed to meet Huang Xiaolong’s expectations. Huang Xiaolong felt that her palace would be the grandest one among everything he had seen, but from the outside, her palace was as simple as could be. It was built so simply it gave off a minimalistic feeling.

Of course, the entire structure might look ordinary, but it was built with the rarest spiritual stone in all the lands.

Zeng Ying invited Huang Xiaolong into the palace, and Huang Xiaolong quickly noticed that everyone in the palace was female. There were tons of beauties, and all of them were experts who had comprehended absolute powers.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sigh in shock. In the Huang Long World, a creed would consider themselves high above the rest if a single expert who comprehended any element of absolute power appeared. In the Sixth Princess’ palace, everyone he saw was an expert at that level. There were even some who had comprehended five to six elements strolling about in the palace.

Zeng Ying couldn’t help but laugh at Huang Xiaolong’s reactions. “I used a ton of effort to gather so many experts. I went around the universe, and accepted them into my faction. Compared to you, all of them might seem talentless…”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Princess is too humble. All of them have extraordinary talent. One day, they will turn into peerless experts.”

Zeng Ying giggled softly, and the two of them entered the main hall.

As soon as they entered, Huang Xiaolong saw three people seated and waiting for them.

One of them was a young man clad in silver robes, another was an old expert who had jade-green eyes. Finally, there was a middle-aged man who looked extremely well-built. All three of them exuded a terrifying aura, and it was clear they were no ordinary experts.

When he looked at them, Huang Xiaolong was visibly stunned.

Along the way, he had only seen female experts in the palace. Now that there were three men sitting in front of him, he couldn’t help but feel surprised. However, the three of them stood up as soon as they saw Zeng Ying and Huang Xiaolong enter the hall.

Zeng Ying explained, “These are the experts I have invited over to help me accomplish the task. What we are going to do will be extremely dangerous, and we will need to work together.”

After speaking, she introduced everyone to Huang Xiaolong.

The silver robed young man was called Hao Yi, and his title was the True Silver Monarch. The jade eyed elder was called Xu Fu, and his title was the Jade Mist Old Man. The middle aged man was the Undying Monster, Bai Xugang.

Out of them all, Huang Xiaolong had only heard of Hao Yi. In the Blazing Dragon World, it was said that his strength was comparable to the Golden Bamboo Old Ancestor and the Mysterious Pool Black Devil.

As for Xu Fu and Bai Xugang, Huang Xiaolong had never heard of them before. They were probably not from the Blazing Dragon World, but they should be people of status if Zeng Ying bothered to ask them for help.

The three of them cupped their fists when they saw Huang Xiaolong. “We have long since heard of the Purple Lightning Young Master’s reputation.”

Huang Xiaolong returned their greeting before chatting with them for a little while.

When they finally took their seats, Zeng Ying ordered everyone else to leave before addressing the four of them.

“Dao Emperor World?!” Hao Yi gasped in shock. “Sixth Princess, are you planning to look for the Dao Emperor’s Sword?”

The Dao Emperor World was no secret to everyone in the hall, and with their status, they had long since heard rumors about it.

Zeng Ying shook her head. “No. I only managed to obtain a piece of map, but the map doesn’t lead to the Dao Emperor’s Sword.” She quickly made the four of them swear an oath to not speak of any matter she was about to tell them before she continued, “The map I obtained contains the location of the Mysterious Magician’s Immortal Cave!”

“What?! Mysterious Magician?!” Other than Huang Xiaolong, the three of them yelled in shock.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked, but he wasn’t too surprised. The Mysterious Magician might not have reached the God of Creation Realm, but he was an expert who stood at the top of the power chain. He was only weaker than God of Creation Realm experts, and it was said that he had reached the perfection level in all thirteen elements a long time ago!

It was said that the Mysterious Magician had one foot in the God of Creation Realm, and he would be able to step through the gates and enter a higher level with a flash of inspiration!
