Before leaving the Vermilion Bird Institute, Huang Xiaolong removed the Spirit Amplifying Array and the defensive formations he arranged around the Lightning Fire Peak, returning it to how it was before.

By the time Huang Xiaolong was done, two days were gone.

Standing in the air above the Lightning Fire Peak, he looked at every building and corner. His life at the Vermilion Bird Institute wouldend from now on.

It was time to go.

‘But I will return.’ Huang Xiaolong spoke to himself, and when he did return, it would be when he unified the four galaxies.

From the beginning of time, never before had anyone managed to unify the four galaxies. Forget unifying the four galaxies, no one had succeeded in unifying even a single galaxy, not in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, or the White Tiger Galaxy.

But Huang Xiaolong wanted to unify all four galaxies! And he was confident that he could do it!

However, unifying the four galaxies wasn’t his ultimate ambition.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and flew away, no longer lingering. The Lightning Fire Peak grew smaller and smaller behind him, disappearing from view.

Arriving at the Vermilion Bird Institute’s only transmission array, he paid the fees and was transported out from the institute grounds.

Inside a palace building somewhere within the Vermilion Bird Institute, Wang Qingjiang was chuckling as he listened to one his subordinates’ report, “Cheng Huai’an, you finally cannot endure staying inside the institute.” Before the last of his words sounded, Wang Qingjiang had already stood up, disappearing in a flicker toward the transmission array.

After leaving the Vermilion Bird Institute, Huang Xiaolong decided to fly straight to the Fire World. There was no transmission array in the Fire World, but it wasn’t too far away from the institute.

In ten days or less, Huang Xiaolong would reach his destination.

He flew at in the vast space, and soon, the Vermilion Bird Institute was no longer in sight. When he was passing by an uninhabited planet, a snicker sounded, “Cheng Huai’an, where are you going ah, flying so fast.”

The space in front of Huang Xiaolong slightly rippled and Wang Qingjiang’s figure emerged.

Other than Wang Qiingjiang, there were six odd-shaped old and middle-aged men. These six old and middle-aged men either had arms that were too long, legs that were too short or had gargantuan-sized heads on a small stature. In short, their features were too comical.

Looking at them, Huang Xiaolong felt like laughing.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Wang Qingjiang shook his head with a faint smile, “Cheng Huai’an, death is upon you, yet you’re still in the mood to laugh.” Showing Huang Xiaolong a pitying expression.

Huang Xiaolong spoke in a taunting drawled, “Wang Qingjiang, aren’t you afraid that the institute will convict you as a traitor?”

These six ‘people’ exuded strong demonic qi, a clear evidence that they were part of the demonic beast clans. Highly likely they were the Piercing Sky Beast King’s subordinates.

Wang Qingjiang laughed as if he had just heard a joke, “Traitor? You better worry about how miserable you’re going to die in a while.” He looked at the demonic beast clan master beside him, “Senior Bixin, this is Cheng Huai’an, Junior Brother Liang Guang died because of him.”

The old man nodded, dismissing Wang Qingjiang in a haughty tone, “You can go now, your business is finished. These are your five billion Zhuque coins.” He said, throwing a spatial ring to Wang Qingjiang.

Inside the spatial ring were five billion Zhuque coins.

Following the Piercing Sky Absolute Kill Order, the person who killed Huang Xiaolong would receive ten billion Zhuqie coins reward, as for the person who provided information that led to a kill would receive half, five billion.

Wang Qingjiang’s divine sense swept over the space inside the spatial ring and a wide smile bloomed on his face. With these five billion, he would be able to purchase the best land on the Dounan Mainland and build the largest residence.

He carefully put away the spatial ring, but he did not immediately leave. Wang Qingjiang wanted to see how Cheng Huai’an died.

Seeing that Wang Qingjiang did not leave as told, the six demonic beast clan masters weren’t bothered.

“Rotten brat, speak, who was it that killed our Young Master?” The demonic beast clan’s Senior Bixin stared coldly at Huang Xiaolong, the greenish hue of his eyes seemed to pierce into one’s soul.

According to Huang Xiaolong’s statement that year, Liang Guang and his subordinates were killed by a master who was passing by. He saved Huang Xiaolong and left.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong was the only person who saw that passing master.

Huang Xiaolong calmly answered, “Actually, that was a fabrication on my part.”

“Fabrication?” All six demonic beast clan masters and Wang Qingjiang were all stunned.

“Liang Guang and the rest were killed by me.” Huang Xiaolong added.

Wang Qingjiang and the six demonic beast clan masters were dumbfounded.

A second later, Wang Qingjiang was the first one to burst out laughing, “I say, Cheng Huai’an, are you a fool or do you think we’re idiots? You’re capable of killing Eighth Order God Realm masters?”

At that time, the several of Liang Guang’s subordinates were all Eighth Order God Realm masters.

The six demonic beast clan masters also shook their heads in ridicule. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders. Fine, nowadays, no one would believe you when you speak the truth. All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong lifted his hand and a force sucked that demonic beast clan master named Bixin right into his palm. Exerting force in his single palm, fear rose in that Bixin old man’s eyes. Just as he was about to say something, he had turned into a rain of blood.

Huang Xiaolong flicked out a spark of true immortal essence fire from his finger, burning Bixin’s soul to nothing.

This Bixin was merely a peak late-Ninth Order God Realm, not even a Tenth Order God Realm. Killing him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need more than a finger.

Wang Qingjiang and the other demonic beast clan masters’ laughter choked in their throats, looking dazedly at old man Bixin that had turned into splatters of blood rain, unable to react for a long time.

Watching them, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to say anything. With a flick of his hand, the remaining five demonic beast clan masters directly exploded.

“You, you, how can this be?! No, you’re not Cheng Huai’an!” At this time, Wang Qingjiang finally realized the most important point, his face distorted with fear as he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, trembling from head to toe.

“I’ve never claimed to be Cheng Huai’an.” Huang Xiaolong emphasized.

“Who exactly are you?!” Wang Qingjiang stammered, his throat feeling parched.

“Cheng Huai’an and Liang Guang, both of them asked the same question before they died.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “This question, you can ask them.” His palm made a grasping gesture in the air.

An invisible giant hand appeared. Wang Qingjiang felt something tighten around his body, and in the next second, the scene before him turned black as his consciousness dissipated.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the spatial ring containing five billion Zhuque coins floating in space. His finger flicked out a spark of true immortal essence fire, incinerating the spatial ring and everything in it. Huang Xiaolong then turned around and left, continuing on toward the Fire World.

Nine days later, Huang Xiaolong stopped some distance away from something that looked like an enormous fireball.

“So, this is the Fire World.” Huang Xiaolong watched, a light flitted across his eyes.

On the surface of the Fire World were swaying flames of various colors. Even before entering it, Huang Xiaolong felt the abundant fire element spiritual energy contained inside.

After a slight thought, Huang Xiaolong’s facial features and stature gradually changed, reverting back to his original physique and face before diving into the Fire World.

Once he entered the Fire World, everything that he saw was fiery red in color.

The mountains were a burning red, the trees were red, even the running rivers below were scarlet in color.

Inside the Fire World, from water to rocks, everything contained the element of fire.

Hot!

This was Huang Xiaolong’s first sensation.

This kind of heat not only affected his physical body, it even exuded pressure on his soul.
