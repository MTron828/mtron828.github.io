Chapter 3681 – Supreme Expert

Huang Xiaolong steered the Universe Boat towards the end of the Netherworld and when he closed in on the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation, he disembarked and hid the Universe Boat.

He traveled on foot towards the formation, and it didn’t take him long to arrive.

The Eighteen Hell Grand Formation was made up of eighteen massive pillars that formed a massive circle. The area they covered was millions of miles large, and there was an altar-like structure in the middle. There were all sorts of runes inscribed onto the altar.

If the Eighteen Hell Dragon Formation were to activate, all eighteen pillars would emit rays of blinding light. They would form a giant light sphere that would fill every part of the Netherworld.

Now, the altar was dim and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see them reacting even a little. Even the Ghost Staff that was personally refined by the Green Ghost was missing!

The Ghost Staff might not be a universe treasure, but it was close to one. It was created near the start of the universe, and it was nearly as powerful as ordinary universe treasures. The staff was the reason behind the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation’s power to suppress the evil ghosts residing in the depths of the Netherworld.

Now, it was gone!

Evidently, someone came to take it away.

However, the staff was personally refined by the Green Ghost. There were countless restrictions on the staff and not even Gui Shi or Jian Wushuang would be able to approach it!

Who in the world had the ability to steal the staff?!

Since the staff was removed, the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation ceased its operation and evil ghosts poured out from the Netherworld.

No one knew how many trillion evil ghosts there were, and they charged towards Huang Xiaolong in an endless tide.

Standing where he was, Huang Xiaolong circulated his grand cosmos energy. When he was ready, he approached the altar. When he passed through the pillars, he felt smaller than an ant! Every single pillar was tens of thousands of miles thick!

He quickly arrived in front of the altar.

The moment he did, a ray of sword light appeared from the void and slashed down towards him with a speed faster than the eye could see.

The ray of sword light had the ability to shatter the earth, and it was much stronger than the One Sword Universe Dao Jian Wushuang comprehended!

When Jian Wushuang displayed his abilities during the ceremony held by the Jian Family, Gui Shi and the White Xuan Old Woman were shocked. Now, the ray of sword light was several times more terrifying than that! One could only imagine how strong it was!

The moment it appeared, Huang Xiaolong reacted. He twisted his body to dodge the strike.

The sword light slammed into the altar, causing a deep cut to form on its side.

In the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation, everything was made with universe black steel essence. The entire area was lined with runes made by the Green Ghost himself, and not even Zhu Chen could cause a scratch to the surroundings. Now, the sword light managed to slice a huge chunk out of the land!

“Huh?”

The person who unleashed the sword light gasped in shock when he saw how easily Huang Xiaolong dodged.

Turning to look into the void, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Are you planning on hiding like a wimp?”

The moment the words left his lips, a figure stepped out from the void. He was a youngster clad in golden robes. Weird light flickered around him and he gave off the aura of a ruler.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils constricted.

Before entering the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation, Huang Xiaolong had already guessed that the person who stole the staff was hiding nearby. However, he didn’t expect to be unable to detect the man!

He felt a faint sense of danger coming from the golden-robed young man and it had been a long time since Huang Xiaolong felt something like that.

The golden-robed young man was the strongest person Huang Xiaolong had met till date!

Even though Huang Xiaolong hadn’t met the Green Ghost, he was absolutely certain that the young man before him was stronger than the Green Ghost!

In fact, the golden-robed young man was stronger than himself!

His combat strength had to cross the 27 billion units mark!

Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong would never feel any sense of danger.

A name crossed his mind, and it was someone he didn’t wish to meet.

Ferocious Devil!

The Ferocious Devil was the strongest person in the Unknown Space, and he was the only one whose combat abilities crossed the 27 billion units mark!

Even so, Huang Xiaolong denied the possibility. From what Jian Wushuang said, the Ferocious Devil was a middle-aged man who was as buff as could be. The devil qi around his body could be hidden at all. The young man before him didn’t emit a single trace of devil qi!

“Who might you be?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Chuckling slightly, the young man replied, “Hey, there’s no need to get nervous. Why don’t you tell me who you are?”

Staring down at Huang Xiaolong, he was like a hunter who was looking down on his prey. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Nervous?

It was true that his combat abilities had crossed the 27 billion mark. However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t nervous at all!

“Huang Xiaolong.”

Huang Xiaolong?! A look of confusion flashed through his eyes. He felt that anyone who could dodge his sword light would be a well known figure in the Unknown Space. However, that was the first time he was hearing that name.

From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t lying!

“I’m not going to waste time messing about with you. You’re pretty strong so I’ll give you two choices. One, you’ll have to submit to me. Two, I’ll refine you into a Yin God! I’ll give you five minutes to think about it. Before you give me an answer, you better think it through. There’s only one correct choice in this…”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the choices.

Didn’t he say something along the same lines when he subdued the Limitless Master and the others?!

“Do you really think that you’ll be able to suppress me?” Huang Xiaolong spoke casually.

A frown formed on the young man’s face when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s attitude to the situation. “Do you think you can escape now that you’re here?! Let me tell you the truth. I am currently in control of the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation. The moment you entered, you sealed your fate. I was planning to lure the Green Ghost over by stealing his staff, but who would have thought that you would take his place?”

The Ghost Staff appeared in his hand all of a sudden and he waved it once. The grand formation activated once again as torrents of light trapped Huang Xiaolong.

It seemed as though the power of the formation became even stronger now that the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation was controlled by him!

Looking around him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t panic in the slightest. The formation might trap the Green Ghost, but Huang Xiaolong was no Green Ghost.

“You have four minutes left.”
