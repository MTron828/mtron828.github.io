Chapter 2373: Various Experts

The four of them retreated from their meditating posture, and they were shocked when they saw the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast at first glance.

Learning that the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast was ‘tricked’ back by Huang Xiaolong, Li Li and the others were dazed for half a day.

“Trick, trick back?!” Li Li was dumbfounded.

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled and avoided explaining. To change the subject, he asked Lin Xiaoying, “Since Senior Sister Li Li and everyone has recovered, shall we leave this place?”

Lin Xiaoying nodded her head in agreement, “Yes!”

It was not a good idea to stay too long at this place.

Moments later, the group set off.

“Junior Sister Li Li, how did you get separated from Senior Sister Tan Juan and Senior Sister Ji Xinyi?” Lin Xiaoying finally found the time to ask.

Li Li recounted, “After Senior Sister Lin Xiaoying got separated from us, Senior Sister Tan Juan, Senior Sister Ji Xinyi, and we fought hard until we ran into a group of Holy Lands Alliance’s experts. With their help, we successfully fought off Xie Bufan and Dou Rui’s group. But a month ago, our group encountered a large profound beast tide, and we got separated from Senior Sister Tan Juan in the chaos.” Li Li went on to describe the situation at that time.

“Where was the place you got separated from Senior Sister Tan Juan?” asked Lin Xiaoying.

“It’s not far from this mainland, we can probably reach there in two weeks or so from here.” Li Li replied.

“Then, let’s go take a look.” Lin Xiaoying said after a moment of thought.

“Senior Sister Lin Xiaoying, you mean Senior Sister Tan Juan and the rest could still be in the vicinity?” Li Li asked in doubt.

Lin Xiaoying shook her head, “I’m not sure, but instead of searching blindly without any clues, we might as well start there.”

Hence, Li Li and the other three female disciples guided the way to where they had got separated from Tan Juan. Huang Xiaolong himself had no specific route in mind, so he followed Lin Xiaoying’s group. In his opinion, he could find holy herbs whether he was alone or with Lin Xiaoying’s group.

Similarly, along the way, Huang Xiaolong snacked on a level-ten origin spiritual pill every few hours. Other than Lin Xiaoying who had grown accustomed to the sight, Li Li and the rest, as well as the Departing Sword Sage Wu Wo, were utterly flabbergasted.

“You, do you eat level-ten origin spiritual pills like this every day?” Li Li blurted out dazedly.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “No, it is only recently that I started eating them like this.” He did not lie on this point. He had only started snacking on level-ten origin spiritual pills in this manner after his cultivation had advanced to Seventh Order Venerable, and it was also mainly because his Grandmist Parasitic Medium had entered the eleventh stage.

Had Huang Xiaolong dared to do this in the past, he would have had only one ending—indigestion!

Li Li had many more questions she wanted to ask when Huang Xiaolong suddenly accelerated forward, faster than an arrow, dumbfounding Li Li. She looked at Lin Xiaoying with a baffled face for an answer.

Lin Xiaoying had a strange expression on her face when it occurred to her as to what had prompted Huang Xiaolong’s sudden action.

As expected!

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to return. However, he carried a drop of crystalline liquid that was brimming with vitality.

“This, this is a holy herb, Lustrous Spirit Dew!” Li Li and the Departing Sword Sage exclaimed at the same tone.

That’s right! Huang Xiaolong was holding the holy herb Lustrous Spirit Dew.

“I’m lucky.” Huang Xiaolong smiled smugly, revealing eight, even and white sparkling teeth.

Lin Xiaoying shot Huang Xiaologn a fierce glare, filled with ‘resentment.’

Huang Xiaolong ignored Lin Xiaoying’s ‘resentment’ as he carefully rolled the drop of dew into a jade bottle, and then put the bottle into his Darkness Holy Ring.

“You left so you could collect this holy herb Lustrous Spirit Dew just now?” Li Li couldn’t resist asking, “How did you discover it?”

The Clear Snow Palace’s three other disciples and Departing Sword Sage stared stupidly at Huang Xiaolong.

“It’s just that I’m a bit luckier than others.” His reply was similar to how he had replied Lin Xiaoying.

But in the next couple of days, Li Li, the Departing Sword Sage, and the rest finally witnessed what Huang Xiaolong meant by a bit luckier. Just like before, Huang Xiaolong would ‘discover’ holy herbs daily, and even on a slow day, he could find two.

By this time, even if the Departing Sword Sage was a fool, he understood where he got those eleven holy herbs Huang Xiaolong had taken out to lure him to make a bet.

This was exactly why he was shocked. Moreover, he had a feeling that Huang Xiaolong was able to find all these holy herbs because of his holy soul.

Having a holy soul that can detect holy herbs!

This ability is simply...! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

No words could accurately describe what the Departing Sword Sage was feeling at this moment.

Having this kind of holy soul was equivalent to owning a treasure trove of endless holy herbs supply!

There was an old legend in the Holy World that ten billion years ago there was a spiritual mouse that could find all holy spiritual treasures, including holy herbs. But this spiritual mouse had long vanished ten billion years ago.

Even someone like the Departing Sword Sage lost his composure, then what’s more to a younger generation disciples like Li Li and her three companions.

The way the four women looked at Huang Xiaolong changed almost every day.

Another ten days came and went by.

Huang Xiaolong, Lin Xiaoying, and the rest finally reached the location where Li Li’s group had got separated from Tan Juan and other Clear Snow Palace’s experts. But after searching the vicinity, they did not find any tracks left behind by Tan Juan or the others.

Lin Xiaoying attempted to contact them again through the communication symbol, but they got no reply. It was obvious that she was crestfallen.

“Senior Sister Lin Xiaoying, what do we do now?” Li Li asked Lin Xiaoying.

Lin Xiaoying spoke solemnly, “Let’s spread out further and search again. We’ll stay here for a month, and if we can’t find anyone, then we’ll return and wait for them at the Profound City.”

“Understood.” The four female disciples complied.

“Thirteen, what about you?” Lin Xiaoying turned around and asked with a hopeful expression.

Huang Xiaolong pondered for a moment then said, “I don’t have anything going on at the moment, so I don’t mind staying a bit longer in the Profound River.”

Lin Xiaoying smiled thinking that this guy Thirteen had a good conscience.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong, Lin Xiaoying, and the rest continued searching for Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and the other experts of Clear Snow Palace. Soon, half a month went by without any results.

Just as disappointment set in, Lin Xiaoying’s communication symbol suddenly shook. Lin Xiaoying was overjoyed when she saw who had contacted her, “It’s Senior Sister Tan Juan!”

“Senior Sister Tan Juan replied!”

“Quick, Senior Sister Tan Juan is right ahead!” Lin Xiaoying pointed towards the mainland in front of them, and then accelerated towards the mainland with Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

They soon arrived at the mainland.

But Huang Xiaolong and the rest had just arrived when they were welcomed by an ear-splitting explosion some distance away. The land below quaked violently as large cracks appeared.

“What’s this...?” Lin Xiaoying’s pretty face ashened.

True Saint Realm experts!

Only True Saint experts possessed this shocking degree of destructive power.

“Maybe it’s Senior Sister Tan Juan or Senior Sister Ji Xinyi!” Lin Xiaoying said as she felt the snow’s iciness from the destructive energy. Immediately, Lin Xiaoying, Li Li, and the others rushed over, throwing all caution to the wind.

“Let’s head over as well,” Huang Xiaolong patted the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast and followed Lin Xiaoying with Departing Sword Sage.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong saw the Clear Snow Palace’s Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and several of Clear Snow Palace’s experts. Apart from them, there were also experts from the Devil Palace, Holy Lands Alliance, Blue Whale Race, Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, and many other forces. At a single glance, there were roughly four to five hundred people.

The person fighting with the Clear Snow Palace’s Tan Juan was an expert from the Devil Palace, a devilish looking young man clad in black brocade robe. Although the young man had charming looks, his complexion was pale, and there was a strange rune on his forehead.

Dou Rui!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. According to that person’s features, Huang Xiaolong immediately guessed that person was the one of the Devil Palace’s six Devil Princes, Dou Rui.
