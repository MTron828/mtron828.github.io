Chapter 3471: Comprehending Universe Energy

Huang Xiaolong quickly regained his calm after noticing where Meng Tian was.

Even if he reached the 999th space, he would never be able to enter the 1000th space where Huang Xiaolong was.

The only way one could enter it was to comprehend all the runes on the Ice Palace.

Since the runes had already been absorbed by Huang Xiaolong, no one would ever be able to comprehend them! Meng Tian lost before the battle even started!

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips when he saw Meng Tian’s desperate bombardment of the 984th space. If Meng Tian knew that he wouldn’t be able to capture Huang Xiaolong despite his best efforts, who would know what he would think?

He no longer bothered with the two of them. Closing his eyes, he calmed his mind and circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and the Pangu World Creation Art. He devoured the Golden Ice Spiritual Liquid in the surroundings.

Every single mouthful he swallowed was more effective than a creation-level pill!

Huang Xiaolong also discovered that he could increase the purity of his grand cosmos energy and strengthen his dao soul if he used the Golden Ice Spiritual Liquid to temper them.

The faster he circulated his creation arts, the faster the Golden Ice Spiritual Liquid surrounded him.

The spiritual liquid clustered around him and he quickly refined it.

A golden light surrounded his dao souls the more he refined them, and his physique became even more perfect.

The grand dao laws in the three worlds he created started to grow even more intricate, and the three worlds themselves started to transform.

If the three worlds he created were compared to immature children in the past, they were rapidly maturing now. By the time they transformed into that of a proper adult, he would enter the God of Creation Realm for real!

Huang Xiaolong seemed to have disappeared from the 1000th space completely.

His dao souls allowed him to feel different types of energy as they drifted into the universe.

The energy was foreign, yet it felt familiar at the same time. They seemed to be the laws that governed the universe.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled. Could that be the elusive Universe Energy my master told me about?

Weren’t God of Creation Realm experts the only ones who could feel that?

He had yet to enter the God of Creation Realm, but he managed to feel it!

A burst of joy filled his heart when he realized what was going on. If he managed to wield universe energy, he wouldn’t be so helpless when they tried to escape from Meng Tian!

Like Xuan Hai and Bei Ting, neither of them would be able to escape!

Slowly, a trace of light that was slightly golden in color started to surround Huang Xiaolong.

As time passed, clusters of Golden Ice Spiritual Liquid poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Gu Yuan and Long Yi might have absorbed a little of the Golden Ice Spiritual Liquid to enter the God of Creation Realm, but there were tons of it left! All of the liquid rushed towards Huang Xiaolong in an endless tide.

In the end, they formed a giant sea around him!

No one knew how long had passed, but when Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes again, Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han were staring at him with weird expressions on their faces.

Looking at himself, Huang Xiaolong didn’t understand why they were giving him the look.

“Your Highness, you… you have not entered the God of Creation Realm, have you?” Gu Yuan asked.

“Nope,” Huang Xiaolong said before standing up.

“But… the universe energy around you…” Long Yi stuttered.

Huang Xiaolong finally realized the concern they had. Of course, he knew why they were confused. After all, he hadn’t entered the God of Creation Realm. Yet, he was able to wield universe energy!

“I have no idea how I managed to control it. It probably has something to do with my three small worlds.” Huang Xiaolong guessed.

“How long was my period of seclusion?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“A little more than a million years have passed since we entered the Ice Palace.” Long Yi replied.

A million years!

Huang Xiaolong nearly jumped in fright.

How has it been that long?!

He only took a little less than two hundred thousand years to refine the universe-level spiritual veins, but he used eight hundred thousand years to comprehend the use of universe energy!

Since so much time had passed, wouldn’t that mean that Meng Tian and Zhao Jinkun were…

Huang Xiaolong quickly checked up on their progress.

Very quickly, he found them both in the 990th space.

Heaving a sigh of relief, Huang Xiaolong felt that his worries were unfounded. Meng Tian and Zhao Jinkun wouldn’t even be able to enter the 991st space.

Looking at the situation outside the Ice Palace, he saw that Huang Muyang and the others were still waiting for him patiently. It seemed as though none of them were willing to give up.

A snort left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. He wondered if Meng Tian and Zhao Jinkun thought that they could trap him in there just because they surrounded the area.

After absorbing the runes around the Ice Palace, he not only gained the ability to enter the Ice Palace as he wished, but he could also leave the Ice River whenever he wanted. That was the reason he chose to enter the Ice Palace even after seeing so many people approach it.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his dao souls. In the past, he could feel the universe around him, but there seemed to be a screen between his souls and the universe. Now, the feeling was gone.

Could it be because he had comprehended the use of universe energy?

Looking at the Pangu Axe, Huang Xiaolong saw that it was several times stronger than before. There was a never before seen glow around the body of the axe, and it seemed as though it had returned to its peak state.

Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab the axe, and he felt the power contained in it. He believed that if Bei Ting was struck by it again, he would definitely be split in half.

When Huang Xiaolong was admiring the axe, the axe spirit sent several snippets of memory to Huang Xiaolong. The mysterious expert battling Pangu before he disappeared finally appeared before Huang Xiaolong.

This…

The person who caused Pangu to disappear was Meng Tian!

He was also the expert who damaged the Pangu Axe!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils constricted when he realized that he failed to properly estimate Meng Tian’s strength. From the looks of it, Meng Tian was even stronger than Huang Sheng!

At the very least, Huang Sheng would never be able to damage the Pangu Axe.

It was no wonder Meng Tian was able to bash his way into the 990th space…

Regardless, it seemed as though Meng Tian would know of Pangu’s whereabouts now that the truth had been revealed.

A weird light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and it caused Gu Yuan and the others to stare at him with solemn expressions on their faces.

“Let’s go. We’ll talk after we leave this place,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. Before they could react, Huang Xiaolong had already pulled them out of the Ice River World.
