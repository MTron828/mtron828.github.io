Chapter 111: Of Course We Won’t Let It End Like This!

After the Kaiser Lion Transformation, from Yang An’s throat came a thunderous roar that sounded very much like a lion’s; one step forward, the ground tremored and the solid material used to build the street actually split and fine fissures lined the street.

The impact of one step reached such an extent!

Yang An put one foot in front of the other, and step by step, he walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

Every step of his made cracks the street.

A strong momentum pressured down and the loose gravel on the street actually bounced and fell according to Yang An’s rhythm.

Like a mighty kaiser lion that came out from an ancient forest, descending from its throne, slowly closing in on its prey.

Huang Xiaolong watched as Yang An came close with a calm expression on his face. Right before the crowd’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong released his battle qi and a dazzling black light spiraled up from below; a terrifying aura of slaughter dispersed from his body, and at the same time, both of Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned scarlet and a pair of black, the blackest demonic wings erupted out from his back.

This abrupt physical transformation shocked everyone around.

“What cultivation technique is this?! The aura of slaughter is so horrible!”

“His strength actually rose so much?! So strong!”

The crowd broke out in a tumult of discussions, and everyone felt the sharp rise in Huang Xiaolong’s strength, and there were even signs of Yang An, who had transformed into the body of the Kaiser Lion, being suppressed!

Standing some distance away behind Huang Xiaolong, Fei Hou’s eyes were trembling with excitement watching Huang Xiaolong’s transformation – the Physique of Asura. This was the legendary technique of Asura’s Gate, the supreme Physique of Asura!

Following Huang Xiaolong for seven years, he finally got the chance to see Huang Xiaolong transformed into the Physique of Asura.

Fei Rong noticed his father shaking with fervorous emotions, and it raised a heartful of doubts.

Huang Xiaolong completed his transformation into the Asura Physique, and the Wings of Demon suddenly stretched out. All the crowd saw was a flash of a black shadow, and Huang Xiaolong already closed in on Yang An when they were still wondering.

Yang An too had yet to react when Huang Xiaolong already punched a Collapse Fist out, hitting Yang An squarely in the chest. Yang An’s face distorted with pain because the powerful fist instantly penetrated his outer defense, directly impacting his internal organs.

Yang An was pushed back more than a dozen steps.

Huang Xiaolong leaped up and in that split second moment, dozens of Ethereal Palms struck out, hitting Yang An consecutively in the chest.

Yang An staggered back endlessly.

Huang Xiaolong did not display any other battle skill, alternating between Collapse Fist and Ethereal Palm to deal with Yang An. More than a dozen Collapse Fists and Ethereal Palms landed on Yang An’s chest, sending Yang An more than a hundred meters out from the original location.

“Boom!”

Yang An was sent flying, crashing into one of the building’s stone walls. The stone wall collapsed and rubble fell on top him, burying Yang An’s huge body beneath.

All four directions were engulfed in silence.

“Big Brother!” Yang Zhanfei was the first to react and rushed out. Zhu Yi and the rest of the guards followed and worked hard to move the rubble away to dig Yang An out.

Yang An’s originally handsome looks and proud temperament were covered with gray dust; the Kaiser Lion Transformation had already disappeared and his body deflated back to his normal size as he stared blankly.

“Hok!” A sweet, hot substance rush up Yang An’s throat, and he spat out fresh blood, coloring a patch of red on the ground in front of him.

“Eldest Young Master!” Zhu Yi and the rest of the Yang Mansion guards were scared.

The quiet surrounding suddenly boiled up.

Yang An used the second ability, Kaiser Lion Transformation, yet he was actually powerless to resist the opponent ㅡ he still lost! Lost so swiftly and thoroughly!

“Big Brother, how are you?” Yang Zhanfei asked.

Yang An could only shake his head weakly as he didn’t even have the energy to talk right now. It felt as if his entire chest was hit until it caved in, and he glimpsed at Huang Xiaolong, unable to conceal the dread he felt in his heart.

If he did not soul transform and change into the Kaiser Lion physique transformation, which greatly enhanced his defenses parallel to an early Tenth Order expert, his chest would have been blasted into pieces from Huang Xiaolong’s attacks.

Yang An swallowed a healing pellet with much difficulty and adjusted his condition. After a short while, his hoarse voice sounded: “We .... go back!”

Propped up by the Yang Mansion guards, Yang An and his people left the place.

“Young Lord!” At this point, Fei Hou came behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Young Lord!” Fei Rong, Fei Ming, and the Fei Mansion guards came up and saluted respectfully. By this point in time, the eyes they looked at Huang Xiaolong with were totally different.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and came out from the Physique of Asura transformation.

“Let’s leave!” When Yang An and his groups receded from sight, Huang Xiaolong said to Fei Hou and the rest.

“Yes, Young Lord!”

As Huang Xiaolong turned around to leave, the crowd parted away from afar, their attitude respectful, fearful and awed.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left Thousand Virtues Street, the message that Huang Xiaolong defeated Yang An exploded in the Royal City, sweeping through the streets like a tsunami.

“Yang An was actually defeated by a young man looking about fifteen to sixteen years old!”

“Sixteen? I heard that person is only thirteen!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Thirteen? I think he’s probably only five or six years old!”

Discussions fueled, becoming more outrageous and heated up, spreading farther and wider.

At the same time, the news about Fei Hou advancing into Xiantian realm was also made known, instantly elevating Fei Mansion’s position in the kingdom. And with Huang Xiaolong’s influence, the Fei Mansion grew mysterious in the eyes of the public.

Once back in the Fei Mansion, Fei Hou gathered Fei Rong and Fei Ming in his room.

“Fei Ming, how are your injuries?” Fei Hou looked at his grandson and asked with a hint of smile.

Fei Ming quickly answered: “Grandfather, grandson’s injuries have mostly recovered.”

Fei Hou nodded, reassured.

“Dad, the news about you breaking through to the Xiantian realm have spread. Just now, we have received the congratulatory gifts sent by the super families!” Fei Rong was smiling from ear to ear as he said this.

Those super families did not express anything when Fei Ming’s wedding was announced, but now that the news about the recently returned Fei Hou actually stepping into the Xiantian realm spread, already seven to eight of the super families sent their congratulatory gifts over.

This caused Fei Rong to be over the moon.

“I was able to breakthrough into the Xiantian realm so fast all thanks Young Lord!” At this time, Fei Hou spoke.

“The Young Lord?!” Both Fei Rong and Fei Ming were dumbfounded.

Fei Hou nodded his head in affirmation: “That’s right. All because of a cultivation technique Young Lord passed to me that enabled me to break through into the Xiantian realm in the shortest time. Both of you must remember that everything that Fei Mansion has was brought by the Young Lord.”

Fei Rong and Fei Ming both nodded in acknowledgment.

“Dad, that Young Lord’s identity is?” Fei Rong could not suppress the doubt and curiosity gnawing at his heart.

Fei Hou’s expression suddenly turned stern: “Young Lord’s identity is not something you can speculate about. If Young Lord permits it, I will tell you in the future, do you understand?”

Fei Rong and Fei Ming shuddered under Fei Hou’s warning, and they immediately nodded with reverence.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was in a solitary courtyard practicing State of Abundant Lightning. After the battle with Yang An, his understanding of the move had deepened significantly.

After practicing his sword skill for some time, Xiaolong entered the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space, swallowed one Fire Dragon Pearl and continued his practice with the Asura Tactics. These months of traveling to the Yuwai Kingdom honed Huang Xiaolong and he was already a mid-Ninth Order.

While Xiaolong was practicing inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, in the Yang Mansion, Yang Zheng’s face was terrifyingly gloomy when he saw his son Yang An being helped back by the family guards.

“Dad, we can’t let this matter go without doing anything!” Yang Zhanfei clamored.

Yang Zhen’s voice was somber: “Of course we won’t let it go just like this, but your Grandfather is still in closed-door practice; let’s wait and two days for when your Grandfather comes out, we will pay the Fei Mansion a visit. At that time, I want the Fei Mansion’s wedding to turn into a funeral!”
