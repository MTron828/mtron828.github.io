Chapter 2329: Meeting Fu Yunjie Again

The following day, the Grand Hall Master of the Holy Heavens, Wu Ge, personally led Huang Xiaolong to the examination hall to retrieve the clothing and jade identity plaques all inner disciples had.

According to the rules, disciples who passed the second round of the examination needed to claim their clothing and plaques at the Examination Hall.

Moreover, they were also required to undergo a simple ceremony before they would be officially recognized as an inner disciple of the Holy Heavens.

For exceptional disciples with good results, the Holy Heavens organization would choose another day for the apprenticeship ceremony. For example, Huang Xiaolong would only attend the ceremony a year later.

When Huang Xiaolong and Wu Ge arrived at the examination hall, Yu Mingjiang and Du Chengrui were already waiting for them.

“Grand Hall Master, Young Master Huang Xiaolong.” Both Yu Mingjiang and Du Chengrui rushed over to greet them.

Wu Ge acknowledged their greeting and grinned, “Mingjiang, Chengrui, all of you will need to soon change your greeting to Lord Huang Xiaolong.”

In the Holy Heavens organization, only core disciples had special authority. Since Huang Xiaolong would soon become a disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, it went without saying that his status would rise.

Both Yu Mingjiang and Du Chengrui promptly agreed, “You’re right, Grand Hall Master, you’re right.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had yet to become an official disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, no one would dare to say otherwise.

Along with Wu Ge, Yu Mingjiang, and Du Chengrui, Huang Xiaolong collected everything he needed to pick up.

A stone tablet stood in the middle of the hall, and it recorded the names of all the inner disciples accepted into the Holy Heavens. Those who passed the second examination had the rights to carve their name into the stone tablet.

Originally, a deacon would be more than enough to complete this task, but this time, Wu Ge personally carved Huang Xiaolong’s name into the tablet.

Thereafter, the three of them led Huang Xiaolong to carry out the simple ceremony.

As soon as the ceremony ended, Wu Ge chuckled, “Congratulations, Lord Huang Xiaolong.”

Both Yu Mingjiang and Du Chengrui congratulated him with a fist salute as they changed the way they addressed him.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Grand Hall Master Wu Ge, all of you can address me however you wish. You can even call me Xiaolong.”

The three of them hastily shook their hands, “We can’t disregard the rules and regulations set by the ancestors!”

Since Huang Xiaolong was not one to put on airs while talking to those close to him, the good impression they had of him increased by quite a bit.

Soon after, Wu Ge passed him a jade slip and explained, “Lord Huang Xiaolong, I have specially refined this jade slip. It contains a detailed introduction to the Holy Heavens organization as well as a detailed description of the Holy World. You can take a look at it when you have the time.”

A detailed description of the Holy World?

A brilliant light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he received the jade slip. “Many thanks to Grand Hall Master Wu Ge.”

Even though Di Huai had shared some information about the Holy World with him, his insights were definitely inferior to the Grand Hall Master of the Holy Heavens.

This jade slip was exactly what he needed.

After all, he was planning on travelling around the Holy World in the near future.

Wu Ge shook his head and laughed, “You’re most welcome, Lord Huang Xiaolong.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The three of them continued to follow Huang Xiaolong as they introduced him to several important places in the Holy Heavens Manor.

The Holy Heavens occupied an extremely big area, and the mountain ranges located in it were endless. Countless spiritual beasts roamed around and primitive forests filled the lands. It was many times larger than the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

Fortunately, there were several ancient spatial arrays that allowed one to travel located around the lands.

After roaming around for an entire day, Huang Xiaolong returned to his palace.

When he returned, Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and a few others were waiting for him. After seeing the inner disciple clothing and jade plaque that Huang Xiaolong was wearing, joy-filled their hearts.

By the time the banquet ended, night had already fallen. Looking up at the night sky in the Holy Heavens, Huang Xiaolong realized that the starry skies were pure and bright.

Huang Xiaolong sat in the courtyard as he carefully read the contents in the jade slip given to him by Wu Ge.

Even though there was a lot of information recorded, Huang Xiaolong’s soul was strong enough to scan through the contents in several hours.

He formed a clearer understanding of the Holy World, and a better picture of the Holy Heavens was painted in his mind. He quickly learned the privileges of being a core disciple of the Holy Heavens and a direct disciple of the four Primal Ancestors.

Even though he wasn’t a core disciple yet, he was the direct disciple of all four Primal Ancestors. Just the fact alone allowed him to enjoy benefits even core disciples couldn’t.

The contents in the amulet also summarised the number of inner and core disciples in the Holy Heavens and a rough gauge of the influence each faction had.

What took Huang Xiaolong by surprise was the number of inner disciples the Holy Heavens accepted. The number was more than he expected. He felt that the Holy Heavens would only possess several tens of thousand inner disciples, but the Holy Heavens organization had more than four hundred thousand inner disciples! The sixth sacred stele was extremely hard to comprehend, and one wouldn’t be able to find someone talented enough to comprehend the sixth stele even in ten thousand years! However, there were so many inner disciples!

It was clear that the Holy Heavens was far more influential and powerful than Huang Xiaolong had imagined.

Moreover, the jade slip also contained a detailed summary about the Clear Snow Palace, the Holy Lands Alliance and Devil Palace, along with the information of exceptionally talented disciples in each of the factions.

“The three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace....” Their name caught Huang Xiaolong’s attention almost immediately.

According to the jade slip, Tan Juan of the Clear Snow Palace also had the ability to evolve her saint attributes.

Wasn’t that similar to his ability?

Huang Xiaolong gasped.

Nonetheless, he had three complete dao saint godheads, three saint bloodlines and three saint physiques. Tan Juan only had a single one.

Of course, he also had the Holy Mandate Imprint that placed him far ahead of her.

As for the Holy Lands Alliance, there were ten chief disciples in the younger generation.

Ten great Holy Grounds headed the alliance, and the ten chief disciples were the strongest ones of their respective Holy Gate!

As for the Devil Place, there were six individuals the Holy Heavens had marked out in the younger generation.

After gaining a better idea of the situation in the Holy World, Huang Xiaolong kept the amulet away.

When morning came, Huang Xiaolong emerged from his courtyard and arranged for Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, and the other members about some pressing matters before leaving for the Devil Cave.

When he thought of the information he had obtained about the Devil Cave previously, the grin on Huang Xiaolong’s face didn’t fade.

There were more than thirty thousand disciples from the devil faction imprisoned there!

Among these thirty thousand disciples, over two thousand of them were between the mid-Third Order Venerable Realm and the late-Sixth Order Venerable Realm!

If he were to devour them all, he would be able to enhance his saint attributes to a shocking level!

Just as he was about to make his way over to the Devil Cave, Fu Yunjie and a large group of people emerged from a large shop along the way.
