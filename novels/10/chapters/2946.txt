Chapter 2947: Aghast

From the creation of Huang Long World until now, no one had ever heard of anyone possessing cosmos energy of two worlds!

Even the pinnacle of peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert could not possibly wield cosmos energy from two worlds!

No one!

But now, Huang Xiaolong had shown exactly that!

“No, no, impossible!” Huang Shuai’s face suddenly became distorted, and his eyes bulged in anger as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “I am the Son of Creation, even I do not have cosmos energy of two worlds. How can you, a Primal Ancestor ant, possess cosmos energy of two small worlds!”

“No way this is real!!”

Huang Xiaolong snickered, but he said nothing. However, his body once again enveloped in a bright light as an army of immemorial gods, and powerful creatures flew out.

The crowd’s eyes were already widened to the limit, and their expressions were no longer the one of shock, but unprecedented fear.

“Three, three worlds’ cosmos energys?!” Xuanyuan Potian stammered. He, as one half of the two tigers, felt like his knees were going to buckle right under him. His entire body’s strength seemed to be sucked away by the revelation of Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds.

Yin Yue’s eyes were filled with disbelief, as she used her two slender hands to cover her agape mouth. Her maid Li Nan had long blocked her mouth with her fist.

Huang Shuai’s hands were shaking, and the twin blades that were pointed at Huang Xiaolong were also shaking.

The Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch, Red Fox Creed Patriarch, Divination Creed Patriarch, and many other creeds’ patriarchs swayed in high air as if a world-destroying tempest had blown over them.

Liu Xinxin’s dao soul had lost her earlier spirit and vigor, and her eyes had lost focus, staring blankly ahead.

Time seemed to have stopped at this moment.

Unknowingly, everyone was holding their breaths. Their eyes never left Huang Xiaolong. No, their gazes never left the three sources of cosmos energy that had taken shapes.

Three small worlds!

One person with cosmos energy from three small worlds!

“This, is he planning to defy the heavens?” an expert mumbled under his breath.

Defy the heavens!

Heavens referred to the God of Creation.

Defying the heavens. Did it mean that Huang Xiaolong was going to exceed the God of Creation?

Many were beginning to suspect that because before the God of Creation had created the world, even he didn’t have three kinds of cosmos energy. They could hardly be blamed for thinking this way because since the time of creation, not one person had ever possessed two or more worlds’ cosmos energy.

Initially, though it was astounding to hear Huang Xiaolong had three dao souls, and it was unprecedented as they could barely accept it. Huang Xiaolong proving he has eleven high-order SaintFates, they could barely accept that as well. But Huang Xiaolong was showing them that he had three worlds’ cosmos energy, and they really couldn’t accept this.

Subsequently, the momentum of a Dao Venerable surged from Huang Xiaolong’s body, spreading outwards, and soaring to the sky.

“Dao, late-First Esteem Dao Venerable!”

Someone gasped loudly, and this person was Li Xue. She couldn’t believe what was before her. Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, and other creeds’ patriarchs’ expressions were similar to hers.

Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong merely a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor during the battle in Monarch Yu Sacred Land? Countless Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave’s experts spectated that battle, then why is Huang Xiaolong a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable now? In less than a hundred years, he advanced to late-First Esteem Dao Venerable Realm from the Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm?

Kill them, and they still wouldn’t believe that this was true. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yin Yue, Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jia, and the others were beyond astonished. That time in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land, they had seen everything clearly, and they were absolutely certain that Huang Xiaolong was only a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

Huang Shuai’s maniacal roar broke the stagnated atmosphere, “So what if you have cosmos energy from three small worlds? So what if you’re already a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable? It’s all just rubbish against my strength and speed!”

“Huang Xiaolong, die for me!”

“I want you dead!”

Huang Shuai had disappeared from the spot before his sentence ended. Two rays of blade light made a slash across space. It was obvious that he wanted to split Huang Xiaolong into two halves.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, and pushed his three worlds’ cosmos energy, roiling around him.

Zi!

The blade rays cut through the first layer of cosmos energy, and then, the layer of second cosmos energy, and lastly, the two blade rays slashed through the third and last layer of cosmos energy.

When the third layer of cosmos energy was slashed open, Huang Xiaolong punched out with his fist, scattering the remaining blade rays’ power.

Huang Shuai appeared in high air with an ugly expression on his face. Despite having the Huang Long Cape and Golden Dragon Twin Blades, Huang Xiaolong’s three worlds’ cosmos energy defensive barriers were extremely strong, and by the time his attack cut the third barrier, most of his attack’s power had been consumed, and it was insufficient to injure Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Shuai was unwilling, and he launched several consecutive attacks, but the results were the same. Even though he had attacked with full force, and how frenzied his attacks were, even after using the ten creeds’ grand dao arts, he couldn’t injure Huang Xiaolong anymore.

Huang Shuai stopped, and his face looked as foul as his mood.

“Huang Shuai, hand over the Huang Long Cape,” Huang Xiaolong said emotionlessly, “I can spare your life!”

Huang Shuai laughed out loud, laughing out of extreme anger, “Huang Xiaolong, are you sure your brain’s alright? You want me to hand over the Huang Long Cape, and you’ll spare my life? Look around you, and figure out where you’re at right now. This is the Dragon Fish headquarters, and there is going to be a Creation Ceremony in two days in my honor as the Son of Creation. You have the cheek to say you’ll spare my life? Not to mention, with the Huang Long Cape, my speed is invincible, you won’t be able to kill me!”

Others also felt Huang Xiaolong had overestimated himself. Even if Huang Xiaolong had twelve high-order Saint Fates, and three worlds’ cosmos energy, so what? The question remained as to whether Huang Xiaolong would survive today and flee to safety. How could he say he would spare the Son of Creation Huang Shuai’s life?”

Huang Xiaolong went on tepidly, “Huang Shuai, do you think you’re the real Son of Creation?”

That was one question no one had expected to hear, and many did not understand the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s question.

Huang Xiaolong’s question made Huang Shuai laugh madly. “Huang Xiaolong, open your dog-eyes and take a good look because behind me is the dragon of creation, Huang Long, and I have the Huang Long Bloodline. You say I am not the Son of Creation, but then, who is it? You?”

“You’re sowing discord? This kind of underhanded scheme is a little naive. Do you think the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch and the others would believe your words? Would the experts here believe your words?

Right when Huang Shuai finished, a giant golden dragon phantom appeared behind Huang Xiaolong, a great golden dragon that lifted the heavens. This golden dragon was many times bigger than Huang Shuai’s golden dragon, and comparing the two was akin to comparing a small hill to a sky-towering great peak! Huang Shuai’s golden dragon was the small hill.

Furthermore, the might coming off the golden dragon behind Huang Xiaolong, the heavenly coercion, was more terrifying. Huang Shuai’s heavenly coercion was gusts of breeze and Huang Xiaolong’s was a billowing tempest!

Under the coercion from Huang Xiaolong’s golden dragon, even peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables like Bi Cheng, and the others felt their dao souls quivering. This was the true heavenly coercion from the Huang Long World!

People like Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jia, Lu Chengfeng, Chen Tianyang were crouched on the ground in fear!

As for Primal Ancestor Realm disciples, to them, it felt like ten thousand kinds of coercion pressing down on them. There was no other choice but to crouch on the ground with their tongue sticking out, only this made them feel a little better.

The Dragon Fish Creed’s Grand Hall Master Li Xue froze when the golden dragon emerged behind Huang Xiaolong, and her tongue went stiff as an icy coldness spread to her limbs. She was aghast.
