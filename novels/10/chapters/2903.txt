Chapter 2904: Mysterious Yin Treasury

Under the horrified gaze of the Second Esteem Dao Venerable, deep green light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s fingertips.

“No!” Before he could say anything, Huang Xiaolong sent the ray of dark green light drilling into his body.

Roaring with rage, his two other companions charged at Huang Xiaolong with the intent to kill. It was too bad they barely moved before they were sent flying by a single slap. They only managed to stop themselves after crashing through several thick pillars.

Spitting out mouthfuls of golden blood, fear appeared in their eyes as they stared at the monster of a Primal Ancestor standing before them. “Cosmos… Cosmos energy!”

The reason they were defeated so quickly was because the other party was using cosmos energy!

Moreover, it was fifth-level cosmos energy!

The small worlds in the bodies of the two Dao Venerables trembled violently along with their dao souls.

As Huang Xiaolong glanced at the two of them, a black flame emerged from his fingertips before drilling into the body of the Second Esteem Dao Venerable in his hands. He didn’t stop there as he sent the power of absolute frost and blaze into his body in succession.

After he was done, he flung the Second Esteem Dao Venerable towards the one he had already dealt with. Their screams filled the immortal cave, and Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at the other two.

With a look of fear on their faces, they retreated hastily. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“We… We… We are willing to give you nine-tenths of the entire treasury!” the Third Esteem Dao Venerable stuttered.

Previously, he had addressed Huang Xiaolong as Young Master Huang, but after witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s true strength, he no longer dared to call his name. He couldn’t hide the fear in his voice.

“Nine-tenths?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “It seems like you haven’t thought it through.”

As soon as he spoke. He started to walk towards the two of them.

Their bodies started to convulse when they realized the monster they dreaded was coming straight for then.

“Sir, are you really planning to make our entire Qiao Family into your enemy?” The Third Esteem Dao Venerable held on to the trace of hope in his heart as he prayed that the reputation of the Qiao Family would be of use.

However, Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled in response, “You’re wrong. You, and the entire Qiao Family have challenged me. That’s your greatest mistake.” Activating the Huang Long Bloodline in his body, a massive golden dragon descended and appeared behind him. Before the Third Esteem Dao Venerable could speak, a terrifying wave of dragon qi filled the area. It was as though the dragon transcended the rivers of time to appear before them, and they felt smaller than an ant before it.

A look of horror appeared on their faces when they realized what was going on. “Creation… God… Huang Long?!”

God of Creation, Huang Long!

Wouldn’t that make Huang Xiaolong…

…

Half an hour later, the four of them kneeled before Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

They paid their respects to the Son of Creation, Huang Xiaolong!

…

Even when he had displayed his terrifying combat prowess with four different peak-level energies, they weren’t as shocked. However, his Huang Long Bloodline had convinced them.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised that they were willing to submit. Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables might be unable to force the four of them to submit, but he was different. As the descendant of the God of Creation, every creature in the Huang Long World was under him! Even a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable would be nothing more than a resident of the world!

It went without saying the four of them submitted to him.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong showed off his strength before revealing his Huang Long Bloodline in order to scare them into obedience. If he wasn’t strong enough, the threat of the Huang Long Bloodline would only cause them to plot against him in the dark.

After making them swear an oath in the name of the God of Creation, he brought out several drops of blue lotus nectar.

“Blue lotus nectar!” The four of them gasped in shock.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong passed it over to them. “Nurse yourself back to health.”

The four of them stared at the priceless treasure hovering before them and stuttered, “Your Highness… This… This…”

“Don’t worry about it. I have a lot more.” Huang Xiaolong stopped them from refusing the blue lotus nectar before they could even voice their concerns.

The four of them stared at each other before thanking Huang Xiaolong with a respectful bow.

Swallowing the drop of blue lotus nectar, they started to recover at speed visible to the naked eye. Since Huang Xiaolong had held back when he had made his move earlier, their injuries weren’t anything that couldn’t be healed in a short period of time.

After they were nearly done, Huang Xiaolong brought the four of them to the entrance of the treasury to shatter the restrictions around it.

As soon as the restrictions shattered, grand dao energy swept towards them like a massive tsunami. Every inch of the immortal cave was filled with grand dao qi and holy spiritual qi.

The gates of the treasury opened to reveal grand dao veins and grand dao herbs that couldn’t be priced in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

In the vast space contained in the treasury, there were more than twenty grand dao spiritual veins!

More than four hundred grand dao herbs grew around them, and it was a sight to behold!

“Purple Gold Spiritual Zoysia!”

“Hundred Grass Dragon Leaf!”

“Nine Phoenix Sparkle!”

…

The sheer number of grand dao herbs dazzled them.

Even someone who was used to seeing a ton of treasures like Huang Xiaolong was taken aback. The treasures in the Immemorial Dao Venerable’s treasury were enough to shock him, but it was a firefly compared to the Mysterious Yin Old Man’s treasury!

There were only six grand dao spiritual veins in the Immemorial Treasury, but there were more than twenty of them in the Mysterious Yin Treasury! In fact, there were a total of twenty-four of them, a whole four times more than in the Immemorial Treasury!

The grand dao herbs were also several times more than what he had found in the Immemorial Treasury.

After getting over their shock, they flew into the treasury.

“Tuoshen dao coins!” The Third Esteem Dao Venerable yelled. As soon as everyone turned to stare at a corner of the treasury, they saw mountains upon mountains of dao coins. The mountain range formed with Tuoshen dao coins was endless as far as their eyes could see!

How many hundreds of millions were there? Huang Xiaolong couldn’t contain the surprise he felt when he saw the endless amount of coins.

Even though he had no idea how many there were, he knew that the coins numbered in the tens of billions.

That was tens of billions of Tuoshen dao coins they were talking about!

Tens of billions!

Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of excitement bubbling in his heart.

He had heard about how a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable had bought a strand of genesis energy with ten billion Tuoshen dao coins, and now, he had several times that amount!

After calming down, Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of suspicion creeping upon him. He wondered how the Mysterious Yin Old Man had obtained so many dao coins. One had to know that even the Blue Lotus Creed and Tempest Wind Creed wouldn’t be able to bring out that much even if they sold the underpants on their disciples.

“It seems like the Mysterious Yin Old Man managed to obtain some super treasury in the past…” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

After suppressing the joy in his heart, he continued to fly deeper into the treasury.

After half an hour of flying, they finally circled the entire treasury once.

Other than what they had seen previously, there were more than a hundred bottles of grand dao pills. None of them recognized the pill, and Huang Xiaolong personally swallowed one to test the effects. After refining it, he realized that it was better than the Immemorial Grand Dao Pills.

A trace of anticipation flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. With the grand dao spiritual veins and pills, he would definitely be able to enter the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!
