To Huang Xiaolong’s surprise, the spiritual energy here was actually much thicker than the Black Warrior Institute, even its quality was a grade higher! Although far from the spiritual energy on his Golden Dragon Peak, it was far from expected.

Not forgetting the faint medicinal fragrance floating in the air, a whiff was enough to make a person feel refreshed and light. Looking around, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the medicinal fragrance actually came out from inside the shops lining the streets.

“Awestruck? The truth is, there’s a spiritual energy gathering formation on every street. As for how many spiritual energy gathering formations there are in the whole Royal Pill City, even this old man doesn’t know. But it’s definitely more than ten thousand of them.” A complacent look appeared on the old man’s face.

“Ten thousand formations!” Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were close to shouting.

Although Huang Xiaolong guessed that there would be quite a lot of spiritual energy gathering formations inside the Royal Pill City, this amount was too choking and exceeded his initial assumption miles away.

Shi Xiaofei too was shocked, her little face expressed clear disbelief.

Ten thousand spiritual energy gathering formations! And it was probably more than that!

One must understand, laying out one spiritual energy gathering formation needed a huge amount of resources. Even the smallest formation, a first rank family was considered as better off just by having a few of them. The higher ranked super forces and families had no more than a hundred of these smallest size spiritual energy gathering formations.

“Let’s go, first to the Royal Pill House to get a good seat, that place has a horrible waiting line.” the Ascending Moon Old Man ’s tone changed, urging the other two to move quickly, evidently craving the Royal Pill Wine.

Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly watching the old man, but his interest toward that Royal Pill Wine was stoked. He knew how picky the old man’s mouth was, a wine that could make him show that expression must be extraordinary.

Both Huang Xioalong and Shi Xiaofei were practically dragged to the Royal Pill House by the Ascending Moon Old Man , reaching their destination rather quickly.

Different from what Huang Xiaolong imagined, although the Royal Pill House was busy, there weren’t too many customers. At least it wasn’t so crowded that one could barely walk.

As if he saw through Huang Xiaolong’s doubt, the Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled, “Say, little disciple, do you think the Royal Pill House’s Royal Pill Wine can be enjoyed by anyone? Although the Royal Pill Wine is first on the must-try list in Royal Pill City, it does not come cheap. Even some Elders of the first rank forces cannot afford to drink it!”

Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were stunned, even some of first rank forces’ Elders couldn’t afford to drink it! This Royal Pill Wine was so expensive?!

While the Ascending Moon Old Man was talking, his feet did not slow down at all, leading them both inside the premise.

Though the Ascending Moon Old Man hadn’t been here in more than ten thousand years, the Royal Pill House barely changed, and it was obvious from the ease and familiarity of the Ascending Moon Old Man as he led them inside. The tables numbered exactly one hundred.

Earlier, from the outside, the place did not seem crowded, but once they were inside, Huang Xiaolong found that almost all of the one hundred tables were filled with customers, merely leaving two empty tables.

However, those two tables were situated right in the center, with people passing through more often than not. It was a bad seating.

Imagine you were enjoying some good wine, but there were always some people moving back and forth behind you, would you still have the mood to drink?

The old man’s brows were slightly scrunched.

Right at this time, two people seated at a table by the window stood up, preparing to leave after they were well fed and watered.

Seeing this, the old man grinned, “Looks like this old man is quite favored by the heavens, my luck’s quite good everywhere I go.” He led Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei toward that table as he praised himself.

The three of them took a seat at the table by the window.

But, even before their seats could warm up, a pair of a young man and woman came to their table. The young man then spoke, “This table was first spotted by us. Old man, bring these two with you, get up this instant for this Young Master and roll over to that table!” He pointed at the remaining two tables at the center.

The young man’s tone was lofty and arrogant. It was evident from his attitude that had formed a habit of berating his servants, the same berating tone he used with the Ascending Moon Old Man.

This table by the window, the young man also saw it, but due to Huang Xiaolong’s group being closer in distance, they got to the table first.

Due to the young man’s loud berating voice, it attracted the surrounding customers’ attention. From their reactions, many of them seemed to recognize this young man.

“It’s one of the Royal Pill City’s Four Young Masters, Lin Yanhan! His father is the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Elder Lin Pinghai!”

“Those three are running into bad luck confronting him! Even the Royal Pill City’s Castellan Ning Re avoids the Four Young Masters!”

A sense of complacency emerged in Lin Yanhan’s heart listening to the exclamations around him, his tone grew even more condescending as he commanded Huang Xiaolong’s group, “Why are the lot of you still not scramming away from the table?! However, this table was first spotted by this Young Master, yet you dared to sit here, this makes this Young Master extremely unhappy.” His eyes lit up as they fell on Shi Xiaofei, “Leave the girl behind to pour wine for both of us. Unless this Young Master is satisfied with your service, don’t think of leaving the Royal Pill House! Is that clear?!”

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow.

Shi Xiaofei’s face was red with anger.

The Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled in response, “Sissy fudge, you kid aren’t happy, but this Ancestor is even more unhappy!” With that said, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s palm directly struck out across the air.

Lin Yanhan had yet to react when he was struck by the Ascending Moon Old Man’s palm, staggering back from the force over a dozen meters.

The surrounding customers immediately saw that Lin Yanhan’s originally handsome face was swollen into a super pig-head, as if it was filled with gas. Several families’ beautiful young women could not rein in their laughter seeing Lin Yanhan’s face.

“Young Master Lin Yanhan, are you alright?!” The young woman with Lin Yanhan asked anxiously.

Lin Yanhan clutched his face. Feeling the fiery pain, he was momentarily dumb with disbelief. There were actually people who dare to attack him in the Royal Pill City. Above all else, it was a beggar-like old man!

“Old man, you’re dead!! All of you are dead for sure! My father is the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Elder, don’t dream of leaving the Royal Pill City!” Moments later, he finally awoke from his shock, shouting a the top of his lungs while pointing at the Ascending Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong, and Shi Xiaofei.

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s wrinkly face was ridiculing, “Your father is the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Elder, then I’m the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Grand Elder!”

The Ascending Moon Old Man was actually telling the truth, not only was he was the sole Special Rank Alchemist of the association, he was also the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Grand Elder!

The Alchemist Grandmaster Association had three Grand Elders, and the Ascending Moon Old Man was one of them. In fact, he carried the most seniority amongst all three, whereas the other two Grand Elders could be considered as his juniors. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Most of the Elders in the Alchemist Grandmaster Association had received guidance from the Ascending Moon Old Man at one point in their lives, including Lin Yanhan’s father, Lin Pinghai!

Of course, no one would believe the Ascending Moon Old Man’s claim that he was the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s Grand Elder based on his beggar appearance. Not only did no one believe him, everyone thought that the Ascending Moon Old Man was mocking Lin Yanhan with his words.

Lin Yanhan thought the same, that the Ascending Moon Old Man was mocking him. HIs face turned deep-red in anger, but he dared not make a move. The old man’s palm strike earlier told Lin Yanhan that the old man was not weak.

At this time, a middle-aged man looking like the restaurant owner approached them.
