Chapter 2579: Hong Zhen Race

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze went over the Mysterious Ice Race’s lineup, finally stopping on Yan Zhouhai.

“You are the Mysterious Ice Race’s Patriarch?” Huang Xiaolong spoke first.

Capturing the condescending tone in Huang Xiaolong’s voice, Yan Zhouhai frowned subconsciously in displeasure. Eminent Elder Yan Wanlong’s sharp, cold gaze was locked on Huang Xiaolong as he sneered, “Punk, I don’t give a hoot which holy ground you come from, or which human race forces you belong to, but you will be dead before the day ends! You and that black guard of yours!”

“Patriarch, there is no need to waste time with a lowly human. Activate the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation!” another Eminent Elder clamored.

Yan Zhouhai nodded his head in agreement. With a wave of his hand, a huge and mysterious rune appeared and rose to midair.

The Eminent Elders flickered into positions immediately above the mysterious rune together with Yan Zhouhai. Each person was in charge of a position.

Subsequently, an energy bubble rose from Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and the other Eminent Elders’ bodies and melted into the rune. In an instant, the huge rune exploded with glaring icy light, and the rays shot to the sky. Violent waves of ice energy swept out in the four directions.

Overwhelming waves of ice-attributed energy submerged Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo in the blink of an eye, and waves upon waves splashed, like a vast cold ocean with neverending angry waves. Wherever the cold waves swept past, a layer of thick ice would appear, freezing even the air, turning its territory into a world of ice.

Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo were completely submerged in the ice-cold waves as if they didn’t even have the time or chance to escape before being turned into part of the ice world. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and the others continued to send their energy into the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation, the ice waves continued to spread outwards even after submerging Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo.

It wasn’t until half of Yang City was sealed in ice did Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and the Eminent Elders stop the grand formation’s powers from spreading further.

“Haha, didn’t I tell you guys that we can kill that punk and his black guard with one hit!” After seeing that the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation had swiftly sealed Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo in a world of ice, Yan Wanlong was feeling triumphant.

“The Mysterious Ice Grand Formation was given to our race by the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor, and the grand formation was personally laid out by him. Even though the grand formation can only display forty to fifty percent of its power with our strength, even a peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint can’t escape once he’s sealed within the ice!” Another Eminent Elder chimed in excitedly.

“Unless that kid is a True Saint!”

Other Eminent Elders also added a sentence or two leisurely.

Yan Zhouhai exhaled in relief.

He had been worrying that Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo might escape because although the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation was powerful, it was strong only in comparison to other formations in Yang City and the nearby cities.

If Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo managed to escape out of bounds, then the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation’s effect on them would diminish greatly.

“Patriarch, how do you want to deal with the human race punk and that black guard?” Eminent Elder Yuan Shan asked.

Yan Wanlong snorted, “I will recommend to seal off their strengths, skin them and cut off their tendons, and then throw them into a pot of hot boiling oil for a good wash. Next, throw them into the Venom Cave, and let them die under the pain of a thousand poisons. In short, let them enjoy the various punishments of our race before they can breathe their last breath!”

“After they die, hang their corpses on a pole in the square. Let’s see if there is another human who dares to offend our Mysterious Ice Race!”

“That’s right!”

Yan Wanlong’s suggestion received a round of support from other Eminent Elders.

Yan Zhouhai also nodded his head.

Right at this time, a low cracking sound rang in the air and disturbed their jolly discussion.

“Crr-ack! Crack! Cr-aaack!”

At first, the noise was negligible, but it soon grew louder, as if the mountains were crumbling. The space and airflow quickly turned chaotic.

“This, this, how can this be?!” Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and others looked down. Their gazes simultaneously fell on Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo who were sealed in ice.

Large and tiny cracks emerged on the thick layer of ice covering the two figures.

“Hurry!” Yan Zhouhai suddenly bellowed.

His voice jolted Yan Wanlong and the rest back to their senses.

Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and the rest quickly sent their energy into the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation again. Frigid ice-attributed energy roared to life, rushing to submerge Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo.

But no matter how many times the icy energy waves rushed past Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo, it was futile. The cracks on Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo’s ice surface increased rapidly like a big spider web extending out.

Thunderous sounds of cracking ice echoed in the ice world.

Boom!

A second later, the power of the Mysterious Ice Grand Formation that the Mysterious Ice Race was so proud of, crumbled before their eyes.

Terrifying ice-attributed energy rebounded towards Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and those within the formation, knocking them flying in various angles. Irresistible ice-attributed energy numbed their limbs and froze their bodies as they plummeted to the ground.

“You, how could you possibly?!” Yan Zhouhai stared angrily at Huang Xiaolong, then his expression changed for the worse. “Are you a True Saint Realm?”

The Mysterious Ice Grand Formation’ sealing powers cannot be broken unless the person was a True Saint Realm expert.

“Correct,” Huang Xiaolong generously admitted.

“WHAT?!” Yan Zhouhai, Yan Wanlong, and the others paled upon hearing that. They could disregard a human race half-True Saint, even if he was a peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint, but a True Saint expert was another matter.

“What does Sir want to do?” Yan Zhouhai’s heart tightened nervously as he asked Huang Xiaolong in a solemn voice, and he even used a polite salutation.

Huang Xiaolong did not answer, but pointed a finger in the air. Over a hundred strands of grandmist spiritual qi flew out, entering the Mysterious Ice Race’s experts’ bodies through their foreheads.

It could have been a little tasking for Huang Xiaolong to control a Ninth Heaven True Saint, but controlling Yan Zhouhai and the rest was as easy as a turn of his wrist as they didn’t get a chance to resist at all.

When Yan Zhouhai’s group was under his control, Huang Xiaolong tapped his finger in the air again, reducing Yan Wanlong, who had been clamoring to punish him with various insidious methods, into a pool of blood.

Then, Huang Xiaolong strode into the Central Headquarters, and dug out the Mysterious Ice Race’s Old Patriarch, who was in seclusion and controlled him in the same way.

With Yan Hengcheng also falling under his control, Huang Xiaolong was considered as having grasped the entire Mysterious Ice Race in his hands. From then on, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo resided at the Mysterious Ice Race’s Central Headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong learned from Yan Hengcheng and Yan Zhouhai that the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds had tens of thousands of races, both large and small. The Mysterious Ice Race ranked third, and the two races ranking above them were the Soaring Snake Race and Hong Zhen Race. The Hong Zhen Race was the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds’ most powerful force.

The Hong Zhen Holy Grounds had three True Saint Realm experts, and two of them were from the Hong Zhen Race!

The third True Saint expert originated from the Soaring Snake Race. Despite being the third biggest force in Hong Zhen Holy Grounds, the disparity in force between the Mysterious Ice Race and the two other races was more than it met the eye.

As for that Hong Zhen Holy Emperor, he was a late-First Heaven True Saint.

However, Huang Xiaolong was not in a hurry to control the Soaring Snake and Hong Zhen Race because Yan Hengcheng mentioned to him that the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor was going to hold an apprenticeship ceremony not too far in the future. At that time, he would be inviting the various alien races within the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds to attend, including some of the nearby forces and holy grounds’ patriarchs that had a good relationship with the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong delayed his trip to the Hong Zhen Race.
