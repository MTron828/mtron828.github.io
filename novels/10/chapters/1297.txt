Huang Xiaolong nodded his head with satisfaction after testing the Yellow Springs Magic Robe’s power.

Even though the Yellow Springs Magic Robe had some severe damages, it was still more useful than the mid-grade chaos spiritual artifact Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell in certain aspects. The Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell protected, enhanced and nourished his soul, but it was unable to attack; whereas, the Yellow Springs Magic Robe could both attack and defend. Not to mention, Huang Xiaolong could even activate the robe’s death qi to attack his enemies.

Devil qi of Yellow Springs was one of the most powerful devil qi in the Devil World. Therefore, one could imagine it’s terror. In addition to this, Huang Xiaolong could also escape with the help of the Yellow Springs Magic Robe.

The Yellow Springs Magic Robe coupled with his Space Concealment ability would make it hard even for a peak early First Order Ancestor God Realm master to kill him. For example, the Short Blade Gate’s Elder Lin Bi.

Huang Xiaolong’s group stayed another day on the small planet, and then continued on their journey to the Vientiane World.

...

The rest of the journey was calm and smooth.

Since Huang Xiaolong continued cultivating as they traveled, their entire journey took them two months to reach the Vientiane World.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s first destination was not the Fortune Gate, instead he detoured to the Barbarian God Sect.

But when he reached the Barbarian God Mountain Range, he saw devastation and ruins. Not only the Barbarian God Sect’s grand defensive formation was shattered, but Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor Lu Zhuo, and Barbarin God Sect’s Chief Gu Ling were laden with heavy injuries.

“Who was it?” Huang Xiaolong asked. His face darkened gloomily.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling stood respectfully in front of Huang Xiaolong, but neither of them knew how to answer his question. In truth, even they couldn’t tell how many enemies had attacked the Barbarian God Sect, nor their strengths, or even how they looked like.

A thousand li radius devil cloud had suddenly appeared above the Barbarian God Mountain Range three months ago. The enemies were hidden in the cloud, and attacked the Barbarian God Sect, shattering the grand defensive formation almost instantly.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling estimated that the enemies were at least Eight Order to Tenth Order Ancient God Realm masters. They even suspected there to be late-Tenth Order, and even peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm masters amongst the enemies.

However, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were both baffled as to why their enemy had spared the two of them. Based on the enemies’ strength, it was simply too easy for their enemies to kill them, if they wanted them dead.

Was their purpose to show might? But to whom?

Huang Xiaolong—!

In the whole Vientiane World, any forces knew that Huang Xiaolong originated from Barbarian God Sect. On top of that,they also knew that the Barbarian God Sect and many neighboring islands’ forces had submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

Furthermore, this catastrophe hadn’t simply ended with the Barbarian God Sect, but the Great Whale Sect, Elephant Genesis Sect, the Dralion Island’s Golden Dragon Gate, Berserk Lion Sect, and other islands’ forces related to Huang Xiaolong were also attacked.

More than half of the Great Whale Sect, Elephant Genesis Sect, Golden Dragon Gate, Berserk Lion Sect’s Grand Elders and Elders had died in the attacks. Unlike Luo Zhuo and Gu Ling that were left alive, the Great Whale Sect’s Chief was blasted to his death on the spot.

Huang Xiaolong’s face darkened with killing intent after listening to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s report.

‘Who is the other side? The Dragon Origin Sect or the Twin Cities Sect? Maybe, it was the Wangu Clan?’ He did not forget to suspect the sea tribes’ Guo Family as well. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze grew increasingly frosty.

“You two, come here.” The little cow ordered Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling.

Both of them stiffened for a moment, but then, they respectfully came to a stop in front of the little cow.

Purple lightning crackled from the little cow’s golden horns. In the next moment, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were enveloped by a layer of purple lightning. Through the purple lightning’s force, the little cow could easily access Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s memories. She could see the attack on the Barbarian God Sect, and see exactly every other detail of what the two of them had seen.

A while later, the little cow retrieved her purple lightning and said solemnly, “Although the other side had concealed themselves well, I was able to recognize the kind of godforce they were using. It was the blood imperial godforce from cultivating a devil cultivation technique named Blood Imperial Devil Art.”

“Blood Imperial Devil Art?” Huang Xiaolong looked at her with confusion in his eyes. He searched through his memories, but came up with nothing. As far as he knew, there weren’t any forces that cultivated this kind of devil art in the Vientiane World.

“Manor Lord, on the Scarlet Whole World, a lot of disciples from the Blood Imperial Sect cultivate this devil art.” Feng Er said.

“Oh,” Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised. ‘The Scarlet One World?’ The Scarlet One World was one of Vientiane World’s neighbors. But he had never been to the Scarlet One World, therefore, it was impossible for any forces from the Scarlet One World to harbor any hatred towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Maybe, someone hired them to do so.” Feng Er added seeing the confusion in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “The Blood Imperial Sect is very mysterious and resembles a killer organization. They accept bounties from other forces to annihilate their enemies.”

Huang Xiaolong fell into contemplation.

“Spread the news that I’ve returned.” Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong said to Lu Zhuo.

Lu Zhuo blanked for a moment, but soon figured out Huang Xiaolong’s intention. He respectfully acknowledged and sped off.

“You’re planning to use yourself as a bait to lure them out?” The little cow asked, however, it sounded more like a statement.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

“What if they don’t make a move?” The little cow asked with a frown.

“We’ll stay here for five days. After that, we’ll return to the Fortune Mainland.” Huang Xiaolong answered after some thought.

There were still four months until the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, therefore staying with the Barbarian God Sect for five days didn’t delay them or affect their schedule.

Soon, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s return to Vientiane World and his visit to the Barbarian God Sect spread like wildfire.

However, the first day passed peacefully.

In the blink of an eye, the second day and the third day went by.

The fourth day finally arrived.

Huang Xiaolong was practicing his sword skill in one of the Barbarian God Sect’s many courtyards, when a clear loud alarm resonated across the Barbarian God Mountain Range. This meant that the enemies were attacking.

A sneer curved up Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, when he heard the alarm. It seemed like the other side couldn’t sit still anymore.

The little cow was lying lazily on the ground. She jumped up spiritedly, and grinned, “You cannot rob my prey.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and agreed, “Sure, all the Ancestor God Realm masters are yours.”

The little cow was stupefied by Huang Xiaolong’s answer.

Huang Xiaolong laughed and flew away without waiting for the little cow.

When Huang Xiaolong and the little cow stopped in high air, they saw an enormous devil cloud moving towards the Barbarian God Sect. In an instant, the devil cloud was already on their opposite side. Huang Xiaolong had not expected his enemies to directly attack the moment the devil cloud was stopped. Several blood palms attacked, with tails of roiling devil qi, headed straight at Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

Clearly, the other side was aiming to kill Huang Xiaolong in one strike.

Huang Xiaolong sneered. Almost simultaneously, he and the little cow retaliated with their own attacks. The Yellow Springs Magic Robe unfolded behind Huang Xiaolong. Thick devil qi spread out, and devoured the other side’s blood palms and devil qi. In a split second, the Yellow Springs Magic Robe’s devil qi and the little cow’s purple lightning blasted up the enormous devil cloud, and revealed two figures hidden behind it

Huang Xiaolong extended two fingers, and with a swish, two rays of sword qi shot out and pierced into the two men’s chest. This time, the little cow’s purple lightning attack arrived half a beat slower.

The two figures plummeted to the ground, and Huang Xiaolong appeared above them in a flicker. He looked at them with a cold, emotionless gaze. His two enemies were clad in blood-colored armors, and both were mid-Tenth Order Ancient God Realms. It was very likely that they were the elites amongst the Blood Imperial Sect’s core disciples.

The two Blood Imperial Sect’s disciples got up from the ground. Fear and disbelief were written all over their faces as they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

From the information they had gotten, Huang Xiaolong was only a Fifth Order Ancient God Realm, at most. He was definitely not above Sixth Order Ancient God Realm! But Huang Xiaolong was actually a late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm! Not to mention, his terrifying battle prowess! With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong injured both of these Tenth Order Ancient God Realm masters!
