Chapter 366: Three Years Later

The Dragon Pearl flew towards Huang Xiaolong, circling around him while releasing rings of golden light that went into Huang Xiaolong’s body like a never-ending tide of golden waves.

Huang Xiaolong bathed in the golden halo, it felt extremely warm and comfortable, akin to an infant inside the mother’s womb.

The battle qi inside Huang Xiaolong’s Qi Sea continued to multiply, the true essence energy within his dantian grew stronger.

Time flowed as the Dragon Pearl rotated around Huang Xiaolong, gradually enhancing the dragon aura inside his body. The Dragon Pearl moved closer and closer to Huang Xiaolong.

A few days later, the light coming from the Dragon Pearl soared sky high and it flew straight into the center of Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows. In that instant, a tsunami of true dragon essence that had been restrained for hundreds of centuries broke out, rushing to every part of Huang Xiaolong’s veins and meridians, spilling into his Qi Sea, even into his dantian.

Huang Xiaolong shook, his whole body ballooned due to the sudden influx of vigorous true dragon essence inside his body. The warm comfortable feeling was replaced by excruciating pain, as if he would blow into pieces at any moment. Frightened, Huang Xiaolong frantically ran the Asura Tactics and the Body Metamorphosis Scripture, crazily absorbing the terrifying amount of true dragon essence.

The Dragon Pearl was hailed as the Dragon Clan’s greatest treasure, a possession of the Dragon Emperor for generations, absorbing true dragon essence belonging to the Dragon Emperor for hundreds of thousands of years, one could imagine the horrifying extent of true dragon essence contained within the fist-sized Dragon Pearl.

Huang Xiaolong crazily absorbed the true dragon essence released into his body, but it was still too much, far exceeding his capacity. Fine threads of blood started seeping out from Huang Xiaolong’s pores, a sign that his body was stretched to the limit, hardly able to hold this large amount of true dragon essence released by the Dragon Pearl.

If this situation continued, there was only one ending for Huang Xiaolong—blasting to pieces! Sensing more and more true dragon essence accumulating in his body, Huang Xiaolong became anxious yet helpless at the same time.

Two days went by and Huang Xiaolong’s body doubled in size, from afar it gave an unsettling eerie feeling. One could only imagine the torturous pain when the body suddenly expanded more than twice its size. If it weren’t for Huang Xiaolong’s physical toughness, he would have exploded long before. Even so, he could barely last much longer.

Seven days later, a thunderous bang rang out, Huang Xiaolong exploded, blood and pieces of meat rained down in the Xumi Temple. Seconds before he exploded, the black and blue dragon flew out from his body, roaring skyward, intertwining with the Dragon Pearl. Rings of golden glow continued rippling out from the Dragon Pearl, filling the Xumi Temple and the entire Godly Mt. Xumi space.

Although Huang Xiaolong’s body exploded, his soul was intact. He felt as if he arrived in a golden ocean, floating aimlessly.

One month, two months, one year passed!

Huang Xiaolong’s pieces of flesh and blood gradually gathered, albeit slowly. While on the outside, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, Yu Ming, and the others were feeling anxious.

“Sovereign has been in closed-door practice for more than a year, why hasn’t he come out yet?” Zhao Shu’s brows were tightly scrunched together.

“There’s barely a month left until the Deities Templar disciple selection day.” Zhang Fu’s brows were also locked together, “Did something happen to Sovereign while in closed-door practice?”

Huang Xiaolong planned to rescue Li Lu during the Deities Templar disciple selection event, all of them were aware of this.

“Sovereign is inside the Godly Mt. Xumi, we have no way of going in.” Yu Ming said.

“We can only wait for Sovereign to come out.” Zhao Shu stated gravely.

All they could do now was wait. But, in this period of waiting, another year passed. A year had gone by from the time of the Deities Templar’s disciple selection.

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest became even more anxious, including Huang Peng and Su Yan. Although Huang Xiaolong went into closed-door practice, he had never once been away for so long. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Inside the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong’s exploded body parts continued to cohere, finally returning to a whole Huang Xiaolong. A faint golden glow glimmered from his body, similar to the golden halo emitted by the Dragon Pearl.

When Huang Xiaolong’s body returned to completion, the Dragon Pearl once again flew into his body between his brows. True dragon essence once again spread to every inch of Huang Xiaolong’s body. However, this time, all the true dragon essence was instantly absorbed by Huang Xiaolong, refined, becoming part of him. The ballooning did not happen this time.

Huang Xiaolong’s body suspended in the air. The black and blue dragon martial spirits hovered above him, absorbing the true dragon essence that lingered in the Xumi Temple, in the last two years, the black and blue dragons had grown to a length of two hundred zhang, their body thickness had more than doubled.

Another half a year passed in the same manner, when it was getting close to the third year of his closed-door practice, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes. An overwhelming momentum gushed out from his entire being at that moment.

With Huang Xiaolong’s body as the center, monstrous energy waves swept out akin to a primordial divine dragon awakening from its long slumber!

Slowly floating to the floor, Huang Xiaolong looked at his hands and his new body that was rebuilt by the Dragon Pearl and true dragon essence, a body that had no flaw. This current body was much more perfect than his previous one, comparable to the ancient Dragon Emperor’s physique!

His current body was rebuilt by the Dragon Pearl and true dragon essence, thus the strength and defense far exceed his old body many times over. Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that even average divine grade weapons couldn’t inflict damage on him.

Even so, that wasn’t the most important. Huang Xiaolong discovered that he actually broke through to peak late- Third Order Saint realm! The true dragon essence inside the Dragon Pearl actually helped him to break through until peak late-Third Order Saint realm!

Huang Xiaolong was dumbstruck, finding it hard to believe. Although he didn’t know how long he had been in closed-door practice, he estimated it wouldn’t be longer than ten years. There were some Saint realm experts that couldn’t advance from First Order Saint realm To Third Order Saint realm even in three hundred years, not to mention peak late-Third Order Saint realm.

Also, it seems like the Dragon Pearl integrated perfectly with his body?!

He noticed a new golden symbol between his brows, this golden symbol probably appeared due to the Dragon Pearl. The Dragon Clan’s ancient language, the single word—Dragon! The symbol was extremely tiny, unless one was searching for it, it wasn’t noticeable at all.

Standing in the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong was like an immovable Mt. Tai.

During the ancient era, some powerful ancient Gods would have a mysterious rune on their forehead when their strength reached a certain strength.

Feeling the potent energy in his body, Huang Xiaolong gradually calmed down. Removing a blue robe from the Asura Ring, got dressed and exited the Xumi Temple.

Being so long in a closed-door practice, his parents, Zhao Shu, and the rest was probably anxious by now.

“It’s Young Lord!” Just as Huang Xiaolong appeared, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were the first ones to detect his presence, exclaiming out in joy.

Within seconds after Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s voices sounded, silhouettes moved, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, Huang Min, and everyone else ran over from wherever they were.

“Long’er, you’re out!” Su Yan walked up, crying out in happiness.

Huang Xiaolong smiled at his mother, nodding. Then he turned to Zhao Shu, “How long was I in closed-door practice?”

“Replying to Young Lord, it’s been close to three years.” Zhao Shu replied respectfully.

Three years? Huang Xiaolong nodded, good, three years wasn’t considered too long.
