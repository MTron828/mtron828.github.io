Chapter 3596 – Meeting Jin Hai

A helpless smile appeared on Tao Hang’s face when he realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t planning on meeting those kneeling outside. He would have to play the role of the bad guy once again…

When he thought about how he would send Celestial Emperor Jin Chengguang away, Tao Hang felt his head going numb. He was a mere Primal Ancestor, but he was tasked with sending the celestial emperor away!

Moreover, there were members of the Tao Family kneeling outside! He was a mere inner disciple of the family, but he was going to send the old ancestor and patriarch of his family packing!

Turning around, Tao Hang saw Tao Han’er staring at Huang Xiaolong’s palace and he couldn’t help but ask, “Han’er, are you alright?”

Tao Han snapped back to attention and sighed, “I’m alright. Let’s go.”

When they emerged from the manor, they saw a sea of people kneeling before the entrance. At a glance, Tao Hang knew that there were thousands, if not more, waiting for Huang Xiaolong.

All of them were experts in the Golden Sea City who had comprehended ten or more elements to the perfection level. Every single existence kneeling there were old ancestors or patriarchs of the great powers.

In fact, they had been kneeling there for quite some time.

When Jin Chengguang saw Tao Hang and Tao Han’ER leaving the manor, excitement flashed in his heart and he went up hastily. “Fellow Cultivator Tao Hang, did the lord return?”

Tao Hang didn’t dare to slight the celestial emperor and he quickly replied with his fists cupped together, “Yes, Your Majesty, he’s back… However…”

Their hearts trembled when the words left Tao Hang’s lips.

“The lord entered seclusion the moment he returned.” Tao Hang could only make the report truthfully.

“That… How long will he be in seclusion?”

Tao Hang shook his head and sighed, “I have no idea. Would all of you like to return to your residences first?”

Jin Chengguang’s sighed in his heart. However, he could only maintain the smile on his face as he addressed Tao Hang and Tao Han’er, “Alright. I would have to trouble you to inform me when the lord leaves seclusion. I wish to pay him a personal visit to thank him for saving the city.”

“Of course.” Tao Hang bowed quickly.

In the end, everyone could only return to their respective manors. Before they left, all of them bowed respectfully in the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s manor.

The only people who acted differently were the members of the Tao Family. Tao De, the old ancestor of the Tao Family, went up to Tao Hang and smiled, “Fellow cultivator, I have already sent for the arrest of Tao Xinren! He will be brought back to the city soon, and you can deal with him as you please as soon as he’s back.”

Tao Hang paused for a second before thanking Tao De, “Many thanks, Old Ancestor…”

Tears of joy appeared in Tao De’s eyes when he heard Tao Hang’s address. He hastily replied, “Fellow Cultivator Tao Hang, there’s no need to call me your ancestor! You can call me by my name!”

When the old ancestors of the various families heard what Tao De said, weird expressions appeared on their faces.

“This…” Tao Hang hesitated. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Fellow cultivator Tao Hang, our Tao Family will always await your return.” Passion ignited in Tao De’s eyes and he continued, “As long as you return, you will be the next Tao Family Patriarch!”

?!?!

He was a mere Primal Ancestor, but the old ancestor was willing to pass him the position of the patriarch!

…

When everything went on outside, Huang Xiaolong had sealed himself in the grand formation of the Universe Boat. He retrieved the treasures from all three treasuries and threw them into the eye of the formation in order to produce universe source qi!

Looking at the millions of strands of universe source qi, Huang Xiaolong sat down happily as he circulated all three creation arts. He started to refine the qi as he comprehended the mysteries of the universe.

The three great worlds in him sucked in the universe source qi around him quickly.

Several years later…

Huang Xiaolong refined the last bit of energy in the formation and he gained quite a bit during his cultivation.

He purified his entire body during this round of cultivation. In the past, Huang Xiaolong experienced a shocking increase in strength as he devoured the power of Huang Sheng, Ao Wanshan, and the others using the power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree and four Universe Origin Fires. When that happened, there were many hidden dangers buried in his body. They reached a terrifying level, and if not for the fact that he discovered them, things might be disastrous!

If he continued to devour Huang Long Bloodlines, the hidden dangers in his body would erupt like a massive volcano! When that happened, his dao souls would shatter and his dao heart would explode!

Nothing would be able to save him then.

Luckily for him, the universe source qi in the Universe Boat and the various powers it contained managed to purify his body. As long as he continued to cultivate in the grand formation of the Universe Boat, he would be able to cleanse his body. When that happened, he would be able to enter the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

He was lucky he managed to obtain the Universe Boat. Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead when realized the consequences.

Huang Xiaolong calmed himself down before leaving his palace.

“Lord!” Tao Hang jumped in joy the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong’s figure. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to emerge from cultivation so soon.

“Lord!” Tao Han’re revealed a cute little smile at the side.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Han’er is growing prettier by the day.”

It was true. Perhaps it was because of her cultivation in the way of the sword, but there was a heroic aura growing around her and it accentuated her beauty.

“This…” Tao Han’er blushed and she didn’t dare to look at Huang Xiaolong in the eye.

“Lord Jin Hai and the old ancestor of the Wei Family, Wei Zhi, have returned to the city. When they learned of your actions, they requested an audience in order to thank you. They asked for me to notify them the moment you left seclusion…”

Huang Xiaolong laughed casually, “Alright, call them over.”

Tao Hang smiled when he realized that he wouldn’t have to offend the other great lords this time. “Yes, Lord!” He left the manor instantly in order to notify the experts of the celestial empire and the Wei Family.

“Lord, do you think I’ll ever be able to enter the God of Creation Realm with my talent?” Tao Han asked when she saw that Tao Hang was gone.

Staring at her in silence, Huang Xiaolong eventually smiled, “Talent is secondary. As long as you cultivate with all your heart, you will definitely enter the God of Creation Realm someday.”

With joy filling her heart, Tao Han’er nodded her head.
