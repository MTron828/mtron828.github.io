Everyone saw Huang Xiaolong block the Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel.

Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s eyes widened to the size of saucers, and his gaze alternated between the Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel and the sixteen wings blocking his attack.

The sixteen wings behind Huang Xiaolong emitted another wave of radiant energy, and countless radiance runes on it moved to form a massive formation.

The Radiance Formation seemed to turn into the source of all radiant energy in the world. It contained all the mysteries of radiant energy within itself.

“NO!” Heavenly Prince Di Jing was unable to accept such an outcome.

“The Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel cleaves apart everything in existence! How can this be?! Why can’t I break through his defense?!” Roars filled the sky as Di Jing howled with indignation.

The Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel was his final trump card. He had initially thought that he could destroy Huang Xiaolong’s defense once he brought it out. Even if he couldn’t kill Huang Xiaolong with a single strike, he felt that it wouldn’t be a problem to injure him critically.

Reality proved to be different from what he expected.

“Do you want me to tell you why you failed to break through my defenses?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “The might of sixteen wings isn’t something you can comprehend.”

It was indeed as Huang Xiaolong had said. Only the person who could form sixteen wings could understand the power contained within them.

Even though he only had four more wings than someone who could form twelve, the boost he received wasn’t a mere four times.

If he managed to utilize the sixteen wings to its extreme, Huang Xiaolong was afraid that the number of people that could break it would be countable on a single hand. He felt that only a supreme expert wielding a treasure at the level of the Ancient Heavenly Court would be able to shatter his defenses.

A peak-grade grandmist artifact was split into different levels. The Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel couldn’t be compared to the Ancient Heavenly Court. In fact, even if he compared the wheel to his City of Eternity, the Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel would be sorely lacking.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled coldly when he stared at Di Jing. A brilliant radiance burst forth from his sixteen wings, and they fully unfurled behind him. The horrifying force contained behind it caused Di Jing to feel a burst of pain in his fist. He loosened his arm, and the Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel flew into the air. Even Di Jing was sent flying away.

Seeing how Di Jing was blown away, the sixteen wings behind Huang Xiaolong shook, and he arrived before Di Jing. As all sixteen wings trembled again, they turned into sixteen sharp swords as they shot downwards.

A blinding light filled the sky as the sixteen swords pierced through the void, towards Di Jing.

They turned into mirages and seemed to break through the constraints of time and space.

Boom!

All sixteen wings landed on Di Jing’s chest, and every attack seemed stronger than the rest. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Heavenly Prince Di Jing turned into a shooting star flying straight for the ground as he slammed ruthlessly into the True Emperor Stage below him. A massive explosion echoed through the air.

The ground around the stage trembled without end, and even some spectators near the arena felt their bodies going numb.

Everyone stared at the scene before them in shock.

Di Jing laid motionless on the arena, and even the Heavenly Dao Runes on his body started to dim. When Huang Xiaolong smashed him into the stage after revealing his Archdevil bloodlines, the runes on Di Jing’s body merely lost their shine for a moment. Right now, they were about to disappear altogether.

Huang Xiaolong’s wings were sharper than the sharpest of blades, and even First or Second Order Emperors wouldn’t be able to take on a single wing with their fleshy body. Even if Di Jing’s Heavenly Dao Divine Physique had abnormal defensive capabilities, he would suffer grave injuries after taking Huang Xiaolong’s all-out attack with all sixteen wings.

No matter how everyone stared at the shocking scene before them, they failed to utter a single sound to express their feelings.

Di Jun, who was seated on his Nine Dragon Throne high above the arena, squeezed his armrest as though he wanted to shatter it to dust. Horrifying energy started to gather around him.

“Uncle is the best!”

A cute yell broke the silence that was stifling the crowd.

Everyone snapped back to attention in an instant.

A smile slowly appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. He didn’t even need to turn around to know who was the one screaming in joy. He felt that only one person would be able to do something like this.

When Huang Xiaolong’s eyes landed on Di Jing, who was sprawled flat on the arena, he didn’t bother continuing his attack. Instead, he walked towards Di Jing with slow, steady steps. Even though his all-out attack with sixteen wings contained terrifying might, he already knew that he wouldn’t be able to kill Di Jing. After all, if Di Jing were to die so quickly, he would be a disgrace to the Heavenly Dao Godhead and Heavenly Dao Divine Physique.

As Huang Xiaolong approached him, Heavenly Prince Di Jing twitched. Everyone felt their eyelids jumping as Di Jing’s body twitched one again. A trace of warmth descended from the nine heavens, and it turned into small little fireflies in the night sky. They swarmed towards Di Jing’s withered body.

The warm glow of the Heavenly Dao Runes revived them, and under everyone’s surprised gaze, Di Jing crawled to his feet.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had concentrated his attack on Di Jing’s chest, everyone was stunned when they saw no wounds on his body.

Even though everyone was in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong felt that it was not surprising at all. He looked at the Heavenly Dao Runes on Di Jing’s body with a trace of admiration in his eyes. The Heavenly Dao Divine Physique deserved its name as the number one divine physique under the heavens. He knew that he had managed to break through the defense of the Heaven’s Dao Physique to strike at Di Jing’s main body, but the wounds had healed in just a few breaths of time.

The regenerative abilities of the Heavenly Dao Divine Physique surpassed his imaginations.

Even after devouring so many precious elixirs and ingredients, even after evolving so many times... Huang Xiaolong felt that the regenerative abilities of his True Dragon Physique was already perverse to the extreme. However, it still failed to compare to the Heavenly Dao Divine Physique.

“Huang Xiaolong, so what if you managed to beat me?” Di Jing stared at Huang Xiaolong, and a sneer appeared on his lips. A bone-chilling smile appeared on his face. “You can’t kill me anyway! I’ve said it before! I have the Heavenly Dao Godhead and the Heavenly Dao Divine Physique! No one can kill me! Right now, as long as I live, there will be a day when I turn around and kill you!”

Despite using the Sun and Moon Yin Yang Wheel, he was unable to kill Huang Xialong. As such, Di Jing no longer had the confidence to take Huang Xiaolong’s life. However, he knew that there was no way for Huang Xiaolong to kill him either.

“Are you so sure?” Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent voice resounded in his ear, and his figure blurred. He appeared before Di Jing, and sixteen wings attacked once again.

His wings turned into a rotating wheel of light, and they spun at an incredible speed. Even time itself seemed to be affected by the spinning light, and one could only imagine how powerful Huang Xiaolong’s attack was.

Di Jing was scared silly, and before he could dodge, the sound of the protective runes ripping could be heard as he slammed into the stage.

This time, Huang Xiaolong didn’t wait for Di Jing to stand up. He leaped out once again and cut down towards his throat with all sixteen of his wings.

No matter how strong one’s defense was, there was bound to be a weak spot. Other than the heart, the other weak spot was the neck!

Sixteen rays of light pierced downwards.

Many people wondered if Di Jing’s throat was actually pierced through as the light was too blinding.
