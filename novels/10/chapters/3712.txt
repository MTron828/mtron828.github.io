Chapter 3713: Concealment

After they left, they headed north.

The Star Refinement King’s flying ship was fast, but it wasn’t as quick as the Universe Boat. Of course, it was fast compared to Bi Qing’s ship.

Huang Xiaolong and the others were kept in one of the spaces on the ship and they weren’t given a giant area either. They had a little more than a thousand square feet, and it felt a little cramped with more than four hundred people.

Huang Xiaolong felt as though they were pigs locked up in a sty.

Releasing his dao souls, he looks at the situation outside the space.

Even though the Star Refinement King personally laid down the formations around the room, they were unable to stop Huang Xiaolong in the slightest.

He didn’t spy on the Star Refinement King in case he was detected.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect that they wouldn’t arrive even after two years of flying!

Initially, he could see several continents that existed in the Universe Vault. The more they flew, the more barren it became.

The flying ship only stopped after three more years.

When the Star Refinement King got his men to bring Huang Xiaolong and the others out, they were brought to a barren field. Huang Xiaoong could see that there wasn’t anything else other than several mountains.

As the Star Refinement King stood on a massive platform in the skies, he stared at the group of ‘slaves’ below him and snorted, “All of you will have to complete your task every day! Anyone who fails to do so will be skinned and your dao soul will be punished! Do you understand?!”

He released his aura to scare the group of slaves when he was done speaking.

Nodding profusely, the group acknowledged what he said.

“I laid down countless formations in a hundred million-mile radius. Not even experts who have crossed the 20 billion units mark will be able to escape. I hope you don’t think of anything stupid,” The Star Refinement King growled. “Anyone who tries will suffer a fate worse than death!”

Soon after, he laid down several other rules.

When he was done, he turned to an expert from the Universe First Race and announced, “Give them their instructions for today.”

After speaking, he disappeared from his spot.

The expert handed all of them a slab that contained their task for the day. There was an extremely detailed instruction manual on what they had to do.

“Remember, you are not allowed to exchange your plaques. Do not let anyone else see your task.” One of the experts harrumphed, “Anyone who breaks the rule will suffer the consequences!”

“These are the resources you will need. Do not waste them. Return everything when you are done with your task.” Someone else handed them a spatial tool each.

All of them were required to inscribe some runes related to the Extermination Formation, but they were all in charge of different aspects. As such, the resources they were given were different.

It seemed as though they would be working on different parts every day.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He could tell that the runes they were inscribing would be used to destroy the Thirteen Universes in the future!

A snort left his lips. Since that was the case, he would have to do a little something to the runes he was about to inscribe.

Even though the Star Refinement King would definitely look through the runes, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could hide his tricks from the man!

After all, Huang Xiaolong’s understanding in the art of arrays had reached a terrifying level. It was especially so after he comprehended the mysteries of the universe from the images in the Nameless Devil Mirror.

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong inscribed the runes while laying down his soul brand on them.

Even though he was only in charge of a tiny portion of the formation, it was more than enough! When the time came, Huang Xiaolong could shatter the formation slowly with the things he did to the runes!

Huang Xiaolong had always been observing his surroundings when he inscribed the runes.

Indeed. There was a formation around the entire area laid down by the Star Refinement King. Not even experts who had broken through the 20 billion units mark could escape, but it was nothing to Huang Xiaolong.

As such, he would leave the area every day to look at the surroundings.

There were countless palaces surrounding the area, and all of them shone with a dark golden light. Huang Xiaolong discovered that every single palace housed an expert from the Universe First Race and they were also there to inscribe the runes. He could tell that they were doing the same job, just that the treatment they received was different.

Huang Xiaolong and the others weren’t even given a place to rest while the members of the Universe First Race were given a palace each!

Even though the palaces were surrounded by powerful formations, they were nothing to Huang Xiaolong. He could enter wherever he wished.

Eventually, Huang Xiaolong arrived outside the largest palace.

“My master said that we have to ensure a smooth activation of the Extermination Formation! We should be able to complete it in the next eight hundred thousand years!” A voice came from inside the palace.

“Go and make a report to Lord Black Nether. Tell him that he can rest assured that I will complete the task.” The Star Refinement King sighed. “Get the rest to look for another batch of slaves from the Thirteen Universes.”

“We also need to inspect the runes inscribed by the slaves. We cannot allow for any mistakes!”

“Yes. I will personally ensure that everything is in place. I will also inspect the runes inscribed by our disciples,” The Star Refinement King muttered.

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes slightly. From the looks of it, the Star Refinement King should be speaking to the Black Nether King’s disciple, Heaven Tyrant!

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to see a black figure disappearing into the void.

Looking at his leaving figure, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment. He wanted to capture Heaven Tyrant, but he decided against it. After all, the Black Nether King wasn’t someone he could mess around with! If he controlled the Black Nether King’s disciple, he would be discovered in a heartbeat!

Huang Xiaolong sneakily returned to his task.

From the looks of it, there were countless people working on the formation elsewhere!

Huang Xiaolong continued whatever he was doing in the following days. He had already discovered that the universe-level spiritual veins were hidden in the treasury of the Star Refinement King’s palace!
