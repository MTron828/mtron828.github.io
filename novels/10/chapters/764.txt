“Amazing, such rich spiritual energy~~~!” Phoenix Clan Patriarch Huang Hongtian exclaimed in awe.

The Phoenix Clan Ancestor, the three Peng brothers, and the Nine-Tailed White Fox were also looking around in awe.

Watching these people’s reaction, Huang Xiaolong felt comforted.

That year, he used the Blood Sacrifice Law by offering all the demonic beast bones he had collected from the Heavenly Mountain. After so many years had passed, Martial Spirit World’s environment and spiritual energy were finally revived, growing even more fertile.

Martial Spirit World’s current level of spiritual energy was slightly richer compared to the Wan Family World. Although it couldn’t rival the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s Cloudsea Mainland, it was getting there.

This time around, Huang Xiaolong had planned to arrange a small scale Spirit Amplifying Array in every kingdom’s royal city, and a bigger array in the imperial cities.

Once completed, Martial Spirit World’s spiritual energy would catch up to the Cloudsea Mainland in a decade!

Laying out a Spirit Amplifying Array required low divine grade and above spirit stones, and what Huang Xiaolong didn’t lack most was divine grade spirit stones.

Determining the direction, Huang Xiaolong led everyone, flying toward Snow Wind Continent. The closer they got to Snow Wind Continent, the denser the abundant spiritual energy became.

As they flew, looking at the mountains, winding rivers of clear water, beasts running on the plains, and the prosperous rebuilt cities, Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction.

It seems like the reward system he implemented had greatly encouraged the kingdoms, empires, and the prominent families to work hard in rebuilding Martial Spirit World.

Martial Spirit World was developing in a good direction.

Huang Xiaolong breathed in relief as he observed these changes. Whether he was a Highgod Realm master or ascended to the Divine World in the future, Martial Spirit World would always be his homeland in this life, his only ‘home.’ He was happy.

As they got closer to the Huang Clan Manor, inexplicably, he was tingling with nervous excitement. Soon, they could see the Luo Tong Royal City over the horizon.

With this group’s speed, from the Luo Tong Royal City to the Huang Clan Manor, it took less than ten minutes. Thus, it wasn’t long before the Huang Clan Manor was in sight.

Compared to the time when Huang Xiaolong left more than a decade ago, the Huang Clan Manor’s land area was twice as big with many new and grand buildings around, from spirit springs, waterfalls, large trees, and spiritual flowers. From afar, the Huang Clan Manor exuded an immortal aura.

The Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, and the others exclaimed in awe once more looking at it.

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s absence, the Huang Clan Manor’s expansion was all executed accordingly to his instructions and designs.

Those building designs left behind by Huang Xiaolong applied the Earth’s modern architecture concept. Drawing praises and gasps of amazement was granted.

In the diagonal direction, at the Huang Clan Manor’s back mountain, a stretch of land was turned into a beachside, leading to a clear blue sea.

This was something that Huang Xiaolong instructed before he left.

Noticing this side, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes brightened, he didn’t expect it to be completed already. The beach was formed by making an opening through the back mountain, allowing water from the sea to flow in, turning the area into a spacious cove.

The water surface glimmered under the sunlight, reflecting soft golden lights.

At this time, there was a person lying lazily on a lounge chair, sunbathing. An old man clad in a short robe, skinny and weak looking, wearing a roughly made straw hat.

When Huang Xiaolong saw this old man’s face, his smile spread wide in a silent laugh.

This sunbathing old man was none other than the Ascending Moon Old Man!

This old man actually changed out of his trademark shabby worn robe, and what was this getup? Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, why did this remind him of the Turtle Hermit in Dragon Ball? The only thing missing was a turtle shell hanging on the old man’s back.

If the Ascending Moon Old Man carried a turtle shell on his back, he’d be a fake copy of Turtle Hermit.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong led everyone toward the beach instead.

Sensing their presence, the Ascending Moon Old Man lazily picked up the drink on the side table and took a leisurely sip before turning his head toward the people flying over.

When he saw it was Huang Xiaolong, he was dazed for a moment, then he flipped up from the lounge chair like a skinny monkey, laughing merrily, “You little brat, you’re finally back! I was thinking that if I don’t see your face in another month, I’d have to make a trip to the Vermilion Bird Institute demanding for my disciple!”

A warm feeling filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart, but it quickly turned into a bitter smile at the ‘little brat.’ F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Huang Xiaolong looked at the old man’s small and skinny stature, he was bigger than this old man in every aspect.

Huang Xiaolong descended on the beach and walked toward the Ascending Moon Old Man with the others following behind him.

Right at this moment, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s happy face was agape with shock. His gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong as if he was looking at a terrible monster.

“Y-your cultivation is already at late-Tenth Order God Realm?!!” While Huang Xiaolong was baffled by the old man’s sudden exaggerated change, the old man already reached Huang Xiaolong in a flicker. Before he could react, two bony hands were roaming up and down his body, like they wanted to turn over every inch. More like the Ascending Moon Old Man suspected this wasn’t the genuine Huang Xiaolong.

Slightly over a decade ago, when Huang Xiaolong departed to the Vermilion Bird Institute, his cultivation was at peak late-Ninth Order God Realm. Returning now, this little brat was already a late-Tenth Order God Realm!

Anyone would be suspicious.

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s behavior rendered Huang Xiaolong speechless. So, this was the reason?

Huang Xiaolong scolded, “I say, old man, isn’t it merely late-Tenth Order God Realm? Is it worth so much exaggeration? Can’t you recognize your own personal disciple?

Only after determining that this was the genuine Huang Xiaolong did the Ascending Moon Old Man stop checking Huang Xiaolong’s body, but the incredulous expression seemed etched on the old man’s face, “I say, Little Huang brat, how did you breakthrough so fast? How is this possible? Impossible, impossible, absolutely impossible!”

The Ascending Moon Old Man uttered several ‘impossible’ to emphasize his disbelief.

Pondering for a while, Huang Xiaolong decided to speak frankly, “The truth is, I went to the Vermilion Bird Institute to look for clues about the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire.”

“Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!” A shiver ran down the old man’s back, staring wide-eyed at Huang Xiaolong, “You’re saying..?”

The Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, the three Peng brothers, and the Nine-Tailed White Fox stared intently at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Correct, I have integrated with the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s eyes were rounder than the moon. A second later, he exploded in elated laughter, whereas the others were struck speechless.

Only now did the Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others find out that Huang Xiaolong had obtained the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire.

Seeing the Ascending Moon Old Man laughing so happily, Huang Xiaolong decided to give the old man another good news. After all, the old man was bound to find out sooner or later. “In fact, other than the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire, I have also integrated with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man that was laughing happily suddenly choked and started coughing non-stop. Behind him, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, the three Peng brothers, and Nine-Tailed White Fox nearly tumbled down. The expressions on their faces looked like they were struck by divine lightning.

Only one person remained composed and unaffected: Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi.
