Chapter 2197: Trashed

“Undefeatable? Have I thought it through?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the threats. He clenched his fist and crushed the prince’s neck.

A wretched cry rang through the hall.

“You!” The expression on the face of Giant Kun Ruler changed.

In the next instant, four divine fires appeared and swallowed Giant Kun Prince.

Before they could blink, he turned into a pile of ashes.

“Huang Xiaolong, I’m going to kill you!” When Giant Kun Ruler saw Huang Xiaolong kill his son before his eyes, rage-filled his heart. The aura around his body expanded as origin energy from the Giant Kun Heavenly Country poured into his body from the void.

His body started to grow larger, and he turned into a massive giant. A phantom of a giant Kun appeared behind him, and it was even more corporeal than the one he had summoned in the space outside the 33 heavens. The air of majesty it emitted was stronger than before!

The origin energy of the Giant Kun Heavenly World was deep blue in color, and a single strand was thicker than someone’s thigh. It was several times thicker than the strands of origin energy from the other heavenly countries! Normally, the origin energy would only be the size of one’s fingers!

Very quickly, the Giant Kun Ruler emitted the aura of a peak late-Tenth Order Sovereign!

That was the peak of the late-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm! He was standing at the limit of the world!

As his aura swept through the lands, it shook the very fabric of space.

“Die!”

Two fish hook-like divine artifacts appeared in the ruler’s hands as he stabbed towards Huang Xiaolong. The fish hook divine artifacts was the Giant Kun Ruler’s natal weapon. He nurtured it, and it grew along with him. As soon as the origin energy from the Giant Kun Heavenly Country poured into it, it emitted a terrifying glow. Even if Huang Xiaolong were to use a high-grade supreme spiritual treasure to defend against it, the hooks would cut through his defenses like it was nothing!

Upon piercing through the void, the hooks emitted rays of resplendent light.

When the rulers of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country saw the fish hooks coming closer and closer, they couldn’t help but panic.

“Die!” Yang Tianchen wasn’t going to leave it up to chance as he launched his attack on Huang Xiaolong. The Dark Lightning Blade chopped towards Huang Xiaolong as blade light filled the space around them. Everyone felt as though there were countless blades slashing at their bodies when the blade light landed on them.

The experts of the 33 Heavens Race and the Giant Kun Heavenly Country weren’t waiting around either. They pounced on Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he raised his fists to send out a punch, seeing as the fish hooks were about to stab into him.

When Giant Kun Ruler saw that Huang Xiaolong had yet to transform to the Primordial Blue Divine Dragon, a sneer formed on his face. According to him, it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to block his attack in the human form. After all, a human’s defense was much weaker than the scales of the Primordial Blue Divine Dragon! He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong could withstand his attack after he absorbed the source energy of the Giant Kun Heavenly World!

“Clang! Clang!”

Two ringing sounds filled the air when the fish hooks contacted Huang Xiaolong. Brilliant rays of light shot out into the surroundings and Giant Kun Ruler felt his hands going numb. It was as though he had struck a wall made of grandmist essence!

This...

How can this happen?!

Huang Xiaolong’s defense was comparable to his dragon form!

As disbelief flashed through the eyes of the Giant Kun Ruler, Huang Xiaolong’s punch arrived! His fists slammed into the chest of the Giant Kun Ruler, and he was sent flying. Slamming into the walls of the hall, leaving a massive hole.

The experts of the 33 Heavens Race and the Giant Kun Heavenly Country froze when they realized what had happened.

The divine armor around their ruler’s chest was smashed into smithereens and blood flowed out from his wound.

In the previous battle, Huang Xiaolong’s claw had pierced a hole through the ruler’s chest and he had managed to recover only after using a ton of precious treasures. After five years, he had managed to recover fully, but Huang Xiaolong’s punch rendered all his recovery moot. Once again, fresh blood poured out from the Giant Kun Ruler’s chest.

One move!

All it took was one move from Huang Xiaolong to defeat, the ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country!

Even with the assistance of the Heavenly Country’s source energy, Giant Kun Ruler who had battle prowess comparable to a peak late-Tenth Order Sovereign was trashed by Huang Xiaolong!

Yang Tianchen nearly dropped the Dark Lightning Blade in his hand when his attack was barely halfway to Huang Xiaolong.

As Huang Xiaolong’s body snapped around to face Yang Tianchen, he felt as though his soul had detached from his body as terror gripped his heart. Huang Xiaolong ignored the Dark Lightning Blade as his palm blasted through the blade qi around him to grab at the actual blade Yang Tianchen wielded!

In a state of panic, Yang Tianchen tried his best to shake Huang Xiaolong off.

It was too bad he was no match for the man himself as Huang Xiaolong forced the blade around to pierce towards Yang Tianchen’s chest.

Rip!

A bloody light shot through the skies.

The divine armor protecting Yang Tianchen was comparable to soft cotton that was torn apart the moment the blade arrived. Drawing a beautiful arc through the skies, a deep wound could be seen across his chest. It was so deep that his bones were visible. If Huang Xiaolong had used a little more strength, Yang Tianchen would have been sliced into two!

In a single breath of time, the two strongest experts, Yang Tianchen and Giant Kun Ruler were seriously injured!

The Giant Kun Ruler crawled to his feet and he stared at Huang Xiaolong with a terrified expression plastered to his face. “You... How did you...?”

The sudden spike in Huang Xiaolong’s strength shocked him.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t allow him to complete his sentence. Another punch flew towards the Giant Kun Ruler.

Boom!

This time, Huang Xiaolong’s fist smashed through the Giant Kun Ruler’s chest and popped his heart. As his fist emerged from the ruler’s back, he punched through the wall of the Giant Kun Divine Palace.

Looking at the holes in the sturdy structure, everyone felt a chill running through their hearts.

A desperate roar left the lips of the Giant Kun Ruler as the fist hooks went straight for Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Before he could land his attack, Huang Xiaolong’s figure turned blurry as he dodged.

The lightning bead emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and met the Giant Kun Ruler’s strike.

With speed barely visible to those present, the lightning bead avoided the hooks as they entered the space between the Giant Kun Ruler’s eyebrows.

The instant it pierced through between the Giant Kun Ruler’s brows, Yang Tianchen who had suffered a miserable defeat pushed himself to the limit as he charged out of the hall. It was clear that he was no longer willing to tangle with Huang Xiaolong.

Despite his desperate attempt, Huang Xiaolong had long since prepared for it as he threw the God Burying Coffin out of the hall. A human-shaped hole formed in the ground outside the hall as it smashed into Yang Tianchen’s back.

When Huang Xiaolong took care of both Yang Tianchen and the Giant Kun Ruler, the battlefield was filled with chaos as the experts of both sides clashed with each other. Seeing the sorry ends of their leaders, the members of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and 33 Heavens Race lost all morale to fight.

They started to fall one after another.
