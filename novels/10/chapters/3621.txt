Chapter 3622 – Sixth Overlord

The patriarch of the Cao Family, Cao Yixuan, frowned, “Blue Dragon Young Master?”

Anyone who could force Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua into submission wasn’t a simple character.

It was especially so when Zhou Chi was placed into the equation. He was an expert with 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

“Can he be from another region?” Cao Ze muttered.

“It’s possible. Get someone to investigate the Blue Dragon Young Master. Look into how he met the three of them.”

Now that three half step Universe Gods submitted to an expert they hadn’t heard of before, Cao Yixuan felt that something was off.

…

In the imperial palace of the Limitless Celestial Empire.

Wu Tianyu’s frowned as a weird light flashed in his eyes. “What a pity. He should have killed Cao Ze. When that happens, the old ancestor of the Cao Family will definitely emerge from seclusion.”

He was more than happy to see the Cao Family clash with an unknown power.

Wu Qifeng reported, “The Blue Dragon Young Master first appeared in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. In the past, Jin Shi, Qin Feng, and Bai Zhou surrounded the city when the Blue Dragon Young Master was within. They were heavily injured by the Blue Dragon Young Master with a single move but he didn’t choose to kill them. Instead, he robbed them clean.

“After he left, he appeared in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. After that, we failed to discover any information.”

“I suspect that the disappearance of Ying Ze and Ying Wan has something to do with him.” Wu Qifeng continued.

“Oh.” Wu Tianyu was slightly taken aback.

“The two of them were last seen in the Yin Yang City. The Blue Dragon Young Master was also said to be there. After a hundred thousand years, he left for the Ice Mountain.” Wu Qifeng’s report finally ended.

A frown appeared on Wu Tianyu’s face. “Do you mean to say that they only submitted to him in the recent years?”

“Yes.” Wu Qifeng nodded. “However, I have no idea what the Blue Dragon Young Master used to tempt the three of them into serving him.”

He seemed to have thought of something and he spoke, “Emperor father, didn’t Marshal Chen Huaizhi return to the Yin Yang City with Lin Qiankun? That was when Ying Ze and Ying Wan vanished. He might know something…”

“Summon Chen Huanzhi immediately!” A solemn expression appeared on Wu Tianyu’s face. “Call him into the palace right now!”

“Yes, Imperial Father!”

…

When Huang Xiaolong returned to the Ice Manor, he sent Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua to defend the perimeter as he entered the Universe Boat immediately.

There were four top-grade universe-level spiritual veins and more than seventy high-grade ones in the batch he obtained!

With all of them, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could break through the 20 billion units mark!

In the Unknown Space, the only people whose combat abilities had surpassed God of Creation Realm experts who accumulated more than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy were the Dragon Overlord, Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Zhu Chen, and the God of Death!

Their combat abilities might have exceeded the 20 billion units mark, but their grand cosmos energy was still stuck below the limit!

Sitting in the first layer of the Universe Boat, he took out four top-grade universe-level spiritual veins and threw them into the eye of the formation. Next, he threw in more than thirty high-grade ones.

Even though he had more than a hundred and twenty universe-level spiritual veins, the first layer of the Universe Boat was unable to convert them all at once. He needed to split them into two batches.

Very quickly, universe source qi poured into the space surrounding him. Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was sitting in an ocean of universe source qi.

Circulating the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art, the universe source qi poured into his body.

Looking at him from a distance, he was like a vacuum that sucked up the boundless universe source qi.

Golden light covered his body and they emitted faint traces of the mysteries of the universe.

Several hundreds of thousands of years passed…

When Huang Xiaolong refined all the universe source qi in the space within, he tossed the remaining spiritual veins into the eye of the formation.

When he was done with the second batch, another two hundred thousand years had passed.

He could feel the abundant grand cosmos energy in him. When he discovered the transformation in his dao soul and dao heart, joy filled his heart.

Before entering seclusion, he accumulated 19.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Now, he finally crossed the 20 billion mark! Even though he had barely broken through, 20 billion was 20 billion!

Now, he was the Sixth Supreme Overlord in the Unknown Space!

With his combat prowess long over the 20 billion units mark, his grand cosmos energy finally caught up!

A small part of the hidden impurities in his body had once again been cleared.

The only thing that disappointed him was the fact that he failed to open the second layer of restrictions.

He was close, but he wasn’t quite there yet!

After emerging from the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Limitless Master has already recovered completely. He had also emerged from seclusion.

“Chen Huanzhi said that the Limitless Celestial Emperor and the others have already started to suspect him. His actions are under close scrutiny.” Lin Qiankun reported.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He wasn’t surprised that that happened. After all, Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun were completely fine while Ying Ze and Ying Wan disappeared. There was no way for them to hide everything.

“Lord, I’ve also heard that an absolute treasure was born in the Sleepless Sea!” Zhou Chi continued.

“What?!” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by the news.

“Yes. It seems to be a universe treasure!” Zhou Chi nodded. “It happened several days ago and the news is still kept under wraps.”

“Universe treasure…” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly.

“Yes… It’s likely that it’s the Three Gods Halberd!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The Three Gods Halberd had the power to gather all the seas in the world. With a single stab, it could tear through the heavens! It possessed unimaginable might!
