Chapter 3015: Three-headed Lightning Beast

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong reached the peak of the mysterious purple peak.

Even though it was the peak of the mountain, it contained enough space to contain a massive city. Lighting qi swirled around in the surroundings, and lightning bolts roared through the air. Even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables would fail to withstand the lightning qi at the peak of the mountain.

Other than the Demon Buddha and his opponent, there were over twenty peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm demons present!

Despite being from the same race, they banded together in groups of twos and threes, and the largest group contained four peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables.

When they noticed Huang Xiaolong’s arrival, they were shocked.

“Late-Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable of the Human Race? Interesting…” Someone stared at Huang Xiaolong before bursting into laughter. Blood-red light flashed through his eyes as killing intent swirled in his heart. Demons from the Other World had always been hostile to those from the Holy Worlds.

After all, the hatred between the two groups hadn’t festered over a period of several years, but it stretched back as long as anyone could remember.

Ignoring the demons, Huang Xiaolong stared at the Demon Buddha and his opponent. Black light enveloped the Demon Buddha as he smashed holes into the dense cloud of lightning qi around him. When Huang Xiaolong discovered the Demon Buddha’s opponent, he was shocked. It was a three-headed lightning beast!

The heads of the lightning beast resembled the head of a qilin, and its body contained the traits of a lion’s torso. It had four dragon claws in place of its legs!

Its head shone with three different colors, and one of them was red, one glowed a brilliant white, while the final head was enveloped in a bright purple hue!

The head glowing red contained the ability to unleash absolute flame, and the head glowing a milky white contained the power of radiance!

As for the head enveloped in purple light, it naturally contained the power of absolute lightning!

The weirdly shaped lightning beast emitted brilliant rays of light as it unleashed the power of absolute lightning at perfection level. Huang Xiaolong frowned slightly as this was his first time meeting a beast with the power of absolute lightning. Moreover, the beast was able to control three types of energies at once with the power of absolute flame and radiance at major completion level!

It was no wonder it was able to fight the Demon Buddha to a stalemate!

Not only did the lightning beast control three types of power, but when it attacked, it used all three types of energies in tandem, causing the earths to crumble and the heavens to shake.

The most surprising thing wasn’t its strength. Instead, Huang Xiaolong was more amazed at the fact that the mountain was standing tall despite their destructive exchange.

Their battle was more than capable of shattering a small creeds, but no matter how they fought, they failed to leave a single mark on the mountain!

No one knew how strong the mysterious purple peak had to be if it could stand tall despite the world-shattering power unleashed by the two monsters above it.

“Brat, how the f*ck did you get in here?!” A red-haired demon with one eye glared at Huang Xiaolong and growled.

As soon as he spoke, demonic qi started to swirl around him. His aura was no weaker than the guards Huang Xiaolong ran into outside the mountain range, and if he was an expert in the Divine Tuo Holy World, he would be ranked in the top thirty!

The other demons turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong in unison. It was clear that they were also curious how he had managed to enter the space around the mysterious purple peak. After all, there were more than three hundred experts guarding the perimeter! Even ordinary peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to sneak in with such a lineup of guards!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong was only at the late-Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm! They didn’t expect him to be able to withstand the lightning qi at the peak of the mountain.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about the red-haired demon. He continued to watch the battle between the Demon Buddha and the Three Headed Lightning Beast.

Seeing how the human ignored him, the red-haired demon’s expression sank.

“Hehe, this brat is going to be in deep trouble. How dare he ignore Elder Savage…” Someone snickered at the side.

“Elder Savage, it seems like your prestige in the Divine Tuo Holy World has reached rock bottom! Even an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable dares to ignore you!” A middle aged demon roared with laughter. “Are you going to take this lying down? Hahaha! If I were you, I would have shattered the little f*cker’s balls!”

Every demon in the surrounding roared with laughter.

Killing intent erupted from the red-haired demon’s eyes as he used a claw to grab Huang Xiaolong. “Brat, if you manage to take this attack from me, I’ll allow you to live!”

A claw formed in the space above them as a it came crashing down.

Ignoring the demon, a ray of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body to shatter the claw.

“Huh?!”

The demons gasped in shock when they realized what had happened. They addn’t expected the human to shatter the red-haired demon’s attack so easily!

“Did he use the power of absolute blaze?!”

“That’s definitely the power of absolute blaze!” a skinny old demon replied. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The looks in their eyes changed instantly.

For existences at their level, it was nothing special to comprehend the power of absolute blaze. However, they couldn’t understand how an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable had managed such a feat!

He would have to be the strongest genius in all the lands if he had managed to do something like that!

The Demon Buddha Black Region had existed for an uncountable number of years! Even though they had produced a lot of geniuses in their time, there hasn’t been a single Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable who managed to comprehend one of the absolute powers!

“No wonder he was able to enter this place…” The middle-aged demon chuckled in amusement. “Elder Savage, aren’t you a formidable existence? Hahaha, you can’t even take down an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable.”

The red-haired demon glared at Huang Xiaolong as anger flashed through his eyes. However, he turned to the middle-aged demon and snorted, “Mang Niu, enough of your bullsh*t! If you’re capable, you can take care of the human. I’ll give you five billion dao coins if you do.”

The middle-aged demon felt a sense of excitement welling up in his heart. “Five billion dao coins?!”

All of a sudden, a heaven-shaking blast rang through the skies. Purple light covered the Three Headed Lightning Beast as its aura expanded to cover the entire mountain peak. The Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables in the surroundings retreated hastily.

Even though Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of the beast, he decided to retreat with the Tortoise Ancestor in order to avoid raising suspicion.

While he was at it, he sneakily laid down the Sun and Moon Grand Formation in the skies as he backed away.

The three-headed lightning beast wielded the power of absolute lightning at perfection level, and it was several thousand times faster than the Tortoise Ancestor! When he first laid eyes on the beast, Huang Xiaolong had already decided to make it his mount. There was no way he would allow it to escape from the mountain peak.

Of course, neither could the demons.

Anyone who came to the mysterious purple peak had their fates sealed the moment Huang Xiaolong had arrived!

As for the red-haired demon and the middle-aged demon...

All Huang Xiaolong could say was that they shouldn’t have spoken out earlier.

Black light started to gather around the Demon Buddha all of a sudden as he disappeared into the void. Black mist gathered around the mountain peak, and no matter how the lightning beast attacked the mist, it refused to dissipate! However, flames started to emerge from the beast’s back as it started to shine like a mini sun in the midday sky. Rays of radiant light that contained the power of both radiance and absolute flame scattered the black mist instantly!
