Chapter 2581: Purple Spider Race

“What?! Princess Qing Xuan is here?! The number one beauty of the Dissociation Domain is here to visit our Yang City?!”

The crowd erupted in an instant as the market roared with activity.

Huang Xiaolong could feel the rising hormone level in every male creature beside him as he shook his head silently.

“It seems like the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor is really here to arrange the marriage between Princess Qing Xuan and the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor! They have to pass through our Yang City in order to get there…”

“I wonder if the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor is here?”

“It doesn’t seem like it. The only person who has arrived is Princess Qing Xuan!”

The various experts started to rush towards the entrance of the market as though meeting Princess Qing Xuan was their greatest life achievement.

Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised as he hadn’t expected Qing Xuan to appear at the entrance of the market.

However, the only emotion he felt was surprise. He wasn’t as emotional as the disciples who rushed to the entrance in order to catch a glimpse of her.

With Hei Luo, Huang Xiaolong continued to look around.

Too bad nothing managed to catch his eye even after shopping around for a long time.

All Huang Xiaolong hoped for was to find something a little more valuable, but all they had were origin spiritual herbs or origin spiritual pills.

Even ingredients to refine holy pills couldn’t be seen, and there was absolutely zero chance of finding a holy pill.

Just as he planned to return to the headquarters of the Mysterious Ice Race, something seemed to catch his eye. Finally slowing down, a gasp left his lips.

The shop he just passed had a run down exterior, and he managed to scan through everything they had with a single glance. His gaze landed on a black lump lying in the middle of the shelves.

Its appearance was extremely ugly, but it somewhat resembled a command plaque. The only thing stopping Huang Xiaolong from looking at the true appearance of the plaque was the unknown object coating it.

Despite using his three holy souls, Huang Xiaolong failed to observe the true appearance of the plaque.

Upon feeling the Holy Mandate Imprint trembling a little when he stared at the black object, he knew that it had to be something good.

When Huang Xiaolong raised his head to look at the shop’s signboard, he realized that it was empty. A complicated look appeared on his face.

He was surprised, but he entered the shop along with Hei Luo.

After looking around the shop, Huang Xiaolong didn’t notice the presence of a shopkeeper or a single attendant. However, a short old man emerged when he tried to pick up the black object.

The old man looked extremely disheveled and his head was bigger than that of ordinary humans. His body was tiny, and his eyes glowed, giving him a creepy look. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Purple Spider Race!”

Huang Xiaolong identified the old man’s face instantly.

The Purple Spider Race was one of the greatest races in the past. They had risen to fame extremely quickly, and they had even managed to squeeze into the ranks of the overlord races in the Alien Lands. However, their existence had started to fade after the previous war between the Holy World and the Alien Lands.

That was because the patriarch of the Purple Spider Race was the only Primal Ancestor Realm expert they had, and he was defeated by the Heavenly Master in the war. After the defeat, the Purple Spider Patriarch had suffered injuries to his Dao Heart.

According to his master, the Heavenly Master, the Purple Spider Patriarch couldn’t recover if he used normal methods. He was basically crippled for the rest of his life, and the only way for him to heal was to obtain the Dao Fruit from the core of the Holy World!

The only problem was that the Dao Fruit had only appeared once in the history of the Holy World, and it was impossible for Zi Dongping to ever obtain something as precious as that.

The Purple Spider Patriarch, Zi Dongping, had seemed to disappear from the face of the earth after the battle and the decline of the Purple Spider Race was only a matter of time.

As such, Huang Xiaolong was a little ‘concerned’ about these fellows from the Purple Spider Race.

As soon as the old man emerged, he was shocked to see a disciple of the Human Race entering the shop along with a guard.

“I wonder what the Young Master wishes to look at…?” The old man was a little more respectful than the others when he addressed Huang Xiaolong, and he had a considerably better attitude than the other shopkeepers Huang Xiaolong ran into.

Huang Xiaolong asked by pointing at the black object, “How much is this?”

“Are you sure you wish to purchase this?!” The old man was a little shocked.

Those who inquired about the item could be counted on one hand, and he didn’t expect a brat from the human race to ask the same question.

Huang Xiaolong nodded silently.

“One holy pill.” The old man spoke after Huang Xiaolong confirmed his intentions.

“One holy pill?!” Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath in shock.

That was the same as handing over ten holy herbs! It wasn’t unexpected for Huang Xiaolong to be shocked at the price. In the entire Hong Zhen Holy Grounds, no one would be able to afford it! Even if the patriarchs of the nearby holy grounds came, they wouldn’t be able to afford it all the same! The only person who would be able to purchase the black object would be the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor!”

“That’s right—one holy pill. The price is non-negotiable,” the old man added.

Even though he was unable to determine the identity of the black object, the old man was extremely certain that it was something good. After all, he was someone who had dabbled in the trade for many years.

“Can I use any holy pill to buy this?”

The old man nodded his head.

After a slight moment of consideration, Huang Xiaolong retrieved a black-colored pill. The number of holy pills he had on him wasn’t low, and the Black Corpse Holy Pill was the lowest-graded one.

“Black Corpse Holy Pill!” The old man yelled in shock.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but turn to stare at the old man. It seemed as though the old man was something else. He managed to identify the pill with a single glance.

“Yeah. This is the Black Corpse Holy Pill.” Huang Xiaolong tossed it over and the old man hastily reached out to grab it. He was extremely afraid of sullying the pill, and he acted as though the pill would shatter as soon as it came into contact with the ground. However, holy pills were holy pills. Even if a half-True Saint assaulted the shop with an ordinary attack right now, the holy pill would be intact.

The old man’s breathing sped up after receiving the pill.

Ignoring the other party, Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab the black object. After keeping it securely, he decided to look into it after returning.

Just as he was about to leave, the old man yelled, “Hold it right there!”

With a flash of his body, he appeared between Huang Xiaolong and the entrance.

With a placid gaze, Huang Xiaolong stared at the old man.

A creepy smile formed on the old man’s face. “Young Master, do you still have more Black Corpse Holy Pills on you? You should have obtained the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury, right?” A greedy glint flashed in his eyes after he spoke.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle softly. He stared at the old man with a mocking gaze as he responded, “That’s right! I have a ton of Black Corpse Holy Pills on me. Do you want them?”

No matter how well hidden the other party’s intention was, they couldn’t escape Huang Xiaolong’s years of experience of ‘getting robbed.’

Huang Xiaolong didn’t blame the old man. After all, even high-level True Saints would fight to the death trying to obtain the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury.

Of course, the old man was no high-level True Saint. Huang Xiaolong could easily see through his cultivation base, and he was at best a Fifth Heaven True Saint.

For an expert at his level to open a tiny shop in a random city in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds, his motives were definitely questionable.
