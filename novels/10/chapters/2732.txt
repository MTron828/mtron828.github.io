Chapter 2733: Do You Really Think You’re Someone Special

Tang Jin and Yuan Yue didn’t recognize Huang Xiaolong, but Chu Zhouyun yelped in shock, “Huang Xiaolong?!”

He clearly didn’t take Qiao Bai’s injury into account, and adding on the fact that he hadn’t seen how Huang Xiaolong had killed Song Hai, he sneered coldly in response. “That’s right, I asked Brother Qiao Bai to arrange for it. What can you do about it? Are you upset? If you’re not sad enough, I’ll ask him to make you serve us tea!”

“Hahaha! You and the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land are only fit to act as servants in this hall!”

He couldn’t help but roar with laughter.

Tang Jin and the others who had just arrived laughed with him, but that was about it.

Qiao Bai and everyone else who was in the hall turned to stare at the newcomers with weird looks on their faces. Qiao Bai’s gaze turned to one of pity when he looked at Chu Zhouyun.

Someone as stupid as Chu Zhouyun naturally didn’t take the strange looks around him into account. A smug look formed on his face as he continued, “Huang Xiaolong, I can’t wait to skin you…”

But before he could finish speaking, a terrifying force wrapped itself around his neck, and he was lifted off his feet.

As he dragged Chu Zhouyun towards himself, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned cold. “Would you like to repeat yourself?”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Originally, Chu Zhouyun wanted to brag to Huang Xiaolong about how he would skin him alive while keeping his flesh intact. He also planned to watch as Huang Xiaolong’s body would start to decay, but the words failed to leave his lips.

A feeling of fear formed in his heart as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s cold, murderous gaze.

The sudden turn of events caused those who came late to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Like the disciples before, the members of the Chufan Sacred Land roared in anger when they saw how Huang Xiaolong treated Chu Zhouyun.

“Release Senior Brother Chu Zhouyun right now!”

The same scene played out as they lunged at Huang Xiaolong.

As a snort left his lips, Huang Xiaolong sent all of them flying out of the hall with a single punch. Many of them rolled down the mountain as miserable screams filled the skies.

“What?!” Tang Jin and Yuan Yue gasped in shock.

When the furious Chu Zhouyun saw the scene in front of him, his fury was extinguished in an instant. He stared at Huang Xiaolong in horror as he knew that even though the disciples who came with him were weaker than him, they were still peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saints.

Huang Xiaolong actually managed to defeat them in a single move!

Even though Qiao Bai and the others had witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying combat prowess previously, they gasped with shock when they saw how he dealt with the disciples of the Chufan Sacred Land.

From what it looked like, he was comparable to a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

Only First Resurrection Primal Ancestor could send more than twenty late-Ninth Heaven True Saints flying with a single strike!

However, the man standing before them was only an early-Ninth Heaven True Saint!

No one could believe what they were seeing. An early Ninth Heaven True Saint actually had strength comparable to an early First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm expert!

Was there another genius in their Saint Devil Heavenly Cave?!

Both Tang Jin and Yuan Yue felt their hearts pounding in fear.

When the two of them joined forces, they were considered invincible under the Primal Ancestor Realm. They could even withstand the attacks of a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor without dying. However, they were sure of one thing. They would never be able to do what Huang Xiaolong had done just now.

Silence descended on the lands.

Huang Xiaolong held Chu Zhouyun’s neck as he turned to the two. “Are you Tang Jin and Yuan Yue?”

They felt a trace of rage rising in their hearts when they heard how Huang Xiaolong spoke to them.

He might have displayed a shocking amount of strength, but he was still a disciple of the Cangqiong Sacred Land. He couldn’t be compared to the two of them no matter how strong he was!

They silently cursed the Cangqiong Sacred Land in their hearts. They wouldn’t believe that a newly emerging power could compare to their Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the Freezing Desert Sacred Land.

“That’s right, what about it?!” Tang Jin continued, “Huang Xiaolong, you better release Brother Chu Zhouyun right now and apologize to him. If you anger the Chufan Sacred Land, your Cangqiong Sacred Land will be razed to the ground!”

Yuan Yue added, “Who do you think you’re talking to? You might be a little stronger than us, but you’re just a disciple of the Cangqiong Sacred Land! You’re not qualified to speak to us with such a condescending tone!” A trace of frost glimmered in his eyes.

Wang Xueru hastily explained his actions, “Senior Brother Tang Jin, Senior Brother Yuan Yue, my Senior Brother was too rash! He has no ill intentions to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the Freezing Desert Sacred Land! Our Cangqiong Sacred Land has no intention to offend either of you!”

Before she had left, the Cangqiong Old Man had instructed her to maintain a good relationship with the others. After all, the Cangqiong Sacred Land was newly established, and they were up against massive powers.

When Tang Jin and Yuan Yue saw the panicked expression on Wang Xueru’s face, a sneer formed on their faces.

“Huang Xiaolong, why are you still holding Brother Chu by the neck?! Are you tired of living?!” Tang Jin roared with rage.

He didn’t believe that a mere disciple of the Cangqiong Sacred Land would dare to defy his orders.

Wang Xueru couldn’t help but turn to look at Huang Xiaolong. She was praying that he would release Chu Zhouyun as she didn’t believe that he had the ability to go against the two sacred lands. He might have been strong, but he was still a True Saint! He couldn’t possibly stand up to their Primal Ancestors!

Qiao Bai, who had been thrown to the side of the hall, sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, I hope that you can think things through! You shouldn’t forget that you’re still in the territory of my Ice Blue Sacred Land! The experts of my sacred land are rushing over as we speak!”

That was his warning to Huang Xiaolong.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong was completely indifferent when he looked at Tang Jin and Yuan Yue. “You’re nothing but trash. Why should I speak to you any differently from the others?”

Their expressions sank instantly.

Huang Xiaolong added, “I heard rumors about how the two of you are planning to kill every disciple of my Cangqiong Sacred Land. Am I wrong?”

Their faces turned ugly when they heard Huang Xiaolong questioning them.

“So what if we do?” Tang Jin sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, do you think you can do anything about it? Who do you think you are?! Do you really think you’re someone special?!”

The corners of Huang Xiaolong’s lips arched upwards as a dazzling smile formed on his face. He hadn’t felt so annoyed in a long time, and anyone who was familiar with him would know how angry he was. There was no escape for Tang Jin and Yuan Yue now.

By raising his arms slightly, he pressed down towards Tang Jin.

A massive palm print appeared above Tang Jin’s head, and his expression changed instantly. He could feel a terrifying strength coming from above, and he screamed, “Brother Yuan Yue, let’s work together! Kill him!”
