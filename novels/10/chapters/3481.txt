Chapter 3482: Wang Meiqi’s Request

Two small worlds!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked as he stared at her.

“Impossible! No one is able to create two small worlds!” The Ice King roared in shock. He refused to believe that it was real.

“Nothing is absolute in the vast universe.” Wang Meiqi shook her head. “It might be unbelievable, but didn’t fellow cultivator here create three small worlds?” She turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

The Ice King wanted to say something, but nothing came to mind after he recalled how Huang Xiaolong created three worlds.

The universe was limitless, and if Huang Xiaolong could form three worlds, why weren’t others able to form two?

There had to be several existences that defied the laws of logic in the universe…

“I wonder what kind of grudge fellow daoist Wang has with Mei Jie?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“We won’t stop until we exterminate each other’s race!” Her voice was frosty, and for the first time since they stepped into her palace, she revealed a trace of killing intent.

Huang Xiaolong could see how much she hated Mei Jie.

He completely understood how she felt. Anyone whose race was exterminated would feel the same way.

“My parents died at his hands…” Wang Meiqi muttered. A piercing cold gaze flashed through her eyes as she stared at the void. “My brother was killed by him, but my sister died the most miserable death. He ravaged her, and she died an unsightly death. Mei Jie is extremely sinister, and he will kill anyone he pleases.”

Her knuckles turned white as she thought of her family’s fate.

“I chose to remain here in order to cultivate in peace. I hope that I will be able to avenge them one day, and I will personally tear his head off his shoulders!” Wang Meiqi growled. “It’s too bad I’m not talented enough. Even though I am about to enter the grand completion stage, my strength pales in comparison to Mei Jie!”

“Even if I break through eventually to the perfection stage, I won’t be able to defeat him!”

That was because she was a cultivator who had only formed a single world! Mei Jie had two worlds, and he had almost 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy before he entered the grand completion stage! Even if Wang Meiqi broke through, she wouldn’t be able to accumulate more than 10 billion units!

Huang Xiaolong understood Wang Meiqi’s intention of bringing him over when he heard the entire story.

Indeed. Her gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong, and she sighed, “I wish to take revenge, and I hope fellow cultivator will be able to assist me. I will agree to any conditions as long as you agree to avenge my family!”

“I’ll agree to anything!”

She emphasized once again.

With her divine looks and cultivation realm at the edge of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, Huang Xiaolong had to admit that he was a little tempted.

However, he still chose to reject her offer. “I understand the pain you’re going through, but I am unable to help you.” He had two insanely powerful enemies on his hands, Huang Sheng and Meng Tian. Both of them were at the peak of the grand completion stage, and his head was about to split apart when he thought about how he had to deal with them. He couldn’t even take revenge for his father, Huang Long! Huang Sheng was an existence he couldn’t stand up against, much less the even more terrifying Mei Jie!

Wang Meiqi wasn’t surprised when she heard his rejection. “I understand that you have your own troubles to deal with. However, I managed to find four universe-level spiritual veins during my time here. If you’re willing to assist me, I will give you all four spiritual veins to aid in your cultivation.”

“What?! Four universe-level spiritual veins?!” The Ice King was shocked.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

Wang Meiqi nodded her head. “That’s right. I’ve been here for countless years, and I obtained every single universe-level spiritual vein born on the Yin Yang Road of Death. Moreover, I have a lot more universe-level treasures.”

She summoned them one by one after she spoke.

“Nine Birth Sun Stone!”

“Nine Death Moon Stone!”

“Third Reincarnation Grass!”

…

“Fruit of Longevity Reversal!”

“Yin Yang Eye!”

The Ice King felt his jaws dropping in fright when he saw the number of treasures she pulled out.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Every single one of them was an absolute treasure that could move God of Creation Realm experts! She actually managed to gather so many of them!

Were there actually so many treasures on the Yin Yang Road of Death?

The Ice King did a brief count, and he counted nearly seventeen thousand of them.

Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t believe his eyes. That was the first time he had seen so many treasures at the universe-level! Not even the treasures he obtained from the Azure Bamboo Third Ancestor and the others got close to them.

The most important factor was the fact that a lot of the treasures she brought out had the ability to increase the power of creation-level weapons! Huang Xiaolong had been looking for treasures to upgrade the Sun and Moon Furnace and Purple Lightning Peak. He could find everything he needed in her stash, and he was confident that they would turn into creation-level artifacts after he refined them!

“I hope fellow cultivator will help me?!” Wang Meiqi asked once again, and she kneeled before Huang Xiaolong. “These treasures will belong to you, along with the four universe-level spiritual veins. I am also willing to be your maidservant to assist you in your journey.”

The Ice King coughed lightly.

It was clear he was tempted by her offer, and he was asking Huang Xiaolong to accept her as part of their crew.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he calculated the pros and cons. With the number of treasures she had, it was indeed a tempting offer. Mei Jie might be a terrifying opponent, but it might not be a bad thing to receive the aid of an expert near the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

Since he had to return to the Blazing Dragon World to save his father, it would help to gather more experts to fight alongside him.

“I can promise you, but I will make the decision as to when I’ll avenge your family,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “I won’t look for him without any guarantees. Without my order, you are not allowed to cause any trouble that will alert him.”

Huang Xiaolong soon listed all his conditions.

She accepted them without hesitation. It was clear she only wanted him dead.

After receiving the treasures from Wang Meiqi, it was time to leave.

Wang Meiqi looked at the palace behind her reluctantly. No matter what, she had lived there for millions of years. She called the undead corpse over and parted with it reluctantly.

One would only be able to leave after entering the God of Creation Realm. As such, the corpse would never be allowed to leave with them.

Half a day later, the three of them started to make their way out of the Yin Yang Road of Death.

A dozen days later, the three of them emerged.
