Chapter 3047: The Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s Sky Is Going to Change

“What? That young man left in the Nine Vision Creed headquarters’ direction? He won’t really be planning to destroy the Nine Vision Creed, right? Who doesn’t know that the Nine Vision Creed Patriarch is serving under the Golden Fox Dao Venerable? His action is a blatant provocation to the Golden Fox Dao Venerable?”

“Say, what do you think the Golden Fox Dao Venerable will do about this?”

“What else can he do? Of course, kill that young man and raze the Leiyu Creed to the ground!”

While Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu were on their way to the Nine Vision Creed headquarters, the entire Golden Fox Heavenly Cave nearly flipped over.

“The Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s sky is going to change, ah?”

“What changing sky are you talking about? That young man dares to provoke the Golden Fox Dao Venerable. It’s a one way to hell. It won’t be long before he’s suppressed by the Golden Fox Dao Venerable! Do you still remember the Undefeated Creed? The Undefeated Creed Patriarch also challenged the Golden Fox Dao Venerable’s authority, and later on, the Undefeated Creed was suppressed, while everyone from top to bottom were killed. To this day, the Undefeated Creed Patriarch’s dao soul is still imprisoned inside the Golden Fox Creed’s special dungeon. How many years have passed? Maybe close to a hundred million years, and he has not seen daylight since!”

“Not to mention, the current Golden Fox Dao Venerable and Cloud Wind Dao Venerable are quite close, and Cloud Wind Dao Venerable has accepted Golden Fox Dao Venerable’s daughter as his goddaughter. Therefore, whoever dares to provoke the Golden Fox Dao Venerable, is also provoking Cloud Wind Dao Venerable, and provoking the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce. Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce is a hegemon, and no one has the guts to provoke them! Even Xiao Yuncheng has to be polite to Wind Cloud Dao Venerable.”

Various forces’ experts were discussing the same matter.

Inside the main hall of Golden Fox Creed headquarters, Golden Fox Dao Venerable Jin Hongyuan’s face was gloomy as he listened to his daughter, Jin Xiaoxiao’s complains.

“Father, you don’t know how brazen that young man was! Before the auction started, he robbed my path for no reason, and his beast mount kicked several senior commanders when they were protecting me. They didn’t put me, and the entire Golden Fox Creed in their eyes at all. After the auction ended, he had his subordinate kill Li Dongjun and Yu Dong for no good reason!”

Jin Xiaoxiao was reaching her breaking point, and probably recalling Huang Xiaolong’s arrogant face, and her expression became twisted.

“Li Dongjun and Yu Dong were standing right beside me, and if the force of his subordinate’s attack would have swayed just a tiny bit, I would have been reduced to a pulp of blood in a second. I wouldn’t have even gotten to see father anymore,” Jin Xiaoxiao added angrily.

The Golden Fox Dao Venerable Jin Hongyuan did not interrupt Jin Xiaoxiao as he listened quietly.

“Father, that young man is more arrogant than the Undefeated Creed Patriarch was in the past. Now, he’s killing Li Dongjun and Yu Dong, but sooner or later, he’s going to kill me too!” Jin Xiaoxiao cried woefully.

Jin Quanqing suddenly turned to the Commander Li Xu standing beside Jin Hongyuan and asked, “What is your view on the young man’s strength? How is the strength of the crimson-haired old man by his side? And also that beast mount of his?”

Li Xu was the late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable senior commander who was sent flying by Lei yu with one kick at Xuan City.

Li Xu’s expression was a little unsightly and fearful recalling the strength in Lei Yu’s kick and the scenes of Old Monster Flame’s battle against Dao Jianchou. “That crimson-haired old man is very, very strong! He pierced through Dao Jianchou’s head with the force of one finger, and his speed was too fast for me to capture. Even if he’s not at the top of the Extermination List, he qualifies to enter the top one hundred and fifty ranks!”

“As for that beast mount, his strength is probably not weaker than the crimson-haired old man!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“That young man is an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. I can’t say for certain how strong he is, but he’s definitely much weaker than the crimson-haired old man!”

Li Xu gave his judgment one by one.

“The Leiyu Creed’s Zhou Hong called that young man, His Highness? And that beast mount as lord?” Jin Hongyuan had more questions.

“Yes, according to the result of our investigation, that is indeed so,” Li Xu answered respectfully.

Jing Hongyuan fell into contemplative silence, his fingers subconsciously knocking on the armrest of his seat. Obviously, he was making a decision.

“Father, that young man is already close to the Nine Vision Creed headquarters!” Seeing this, Jin Xiaoxiao added fuel to the fire, “Are we going to watch them destroy the Nine Vision Creed and do nothing? Even if that young man has a big backing, don’t we have the godfather, why should we be afraid of him? Even if he’s the Prince of Origin, he still needs to be courteous to the godfather, and more importantly, Father, you’re a peerless expert ranked sixtieth on the Extermination List!”

“Father, who are you afraid of after joining hands with the godfather?” Jin Xiaoxiao’s words jolted Jin Hongyuan like an electric current.

Jin Hongyuan let out several chuckles as he exuded a strong aura of confidence.

“You are right, Father is overthinking things, with your godfather on our side, who do we need to fear?” Jin Hongyuan laughed sonorously. The awe-inspiring momentum of the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s hegemon made Li Xu and the others tremble.

“Pass my order, Senio Commander Liu Yu stationed closest to the Nine Vision Creed to immediately depart to the Nine Vision Creed, and if he encounters that young man, escort that young man to the Golden Fox Creed headquarters to confess his sins and accept punishment!” Jin Hongyuan ordered Li Xu.

“Yes, Lord!” Li Xu promptly complied.

“What if that young man defies Lord’s order?” Li Xu was hesitant to ask but still did.

Jin Hongyuan’s eyes narrowed as he spoke, “If he dares to defy my order, tell him that the Leiyu Creed will be destroyed because of him!” A surge of killing intent swept through the hall.

Then Jin Hongyuan added another order, “Have Sui Hengyi, Tan Hua, and Zhou Hong come see me now!”

……

Half a day later.

Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and Old Monster Flame were in the air above the Nine Vision City.

Lei Yu stomped the air with his front paw and the city below shook and rumbled in protest. The Nine Vision Creed headquarters was reduced to ruins in the blink of an eye even though the headquarters’ buildings were protected by powerful array formations that were strengthened by generations of Dao Venerable experts. All of these simply failed to block off the force wave from Lei Yu’s single stomp.

“Who’s out there?!” An infuriated voice thundered, as numerous experts soared to the sky. Other than Dao Venerable experts, there were many high-level Primal Ancestor experts, almost reaching a hundred thousand in numbers.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze stopped on the middle-aged man clad in a green brocade robe. “You’re Li Shen?”

“Insolent!” Other experts of Nine Vision Creed snapped at Huang Xiaolong’s rudeness towards their patriarch.

The Nine Vision Creed Patriarch Li Shen looked apprehensive after he took a good look at Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and Old Monster Flame, and blurting out, “You are the people who killed my son!”

He had heard that Huang Xiaolong was coming to the Nine Vision Creed, but he had not expected Huang Xiaolong’s group to arrive so fast.

“Yes,” Huang Xiaolong nodded. Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to order Old Monster Flame to start, he stopped and turned to look towards the horizon where the Golden Fox Army was arriving full of pomp. There were several million experts, and their presence completely blocked the horizon out of sight, like a golden sea during high tide.

The Nine Vision Creed’s experts were thrilled by the Golden Fox Army’s arrival, and Li Shen quickly led them to welcome the Golden Fox Army, and Huang Xiaolong did not stop them at all.

“Senior Commander Liu Yu!” Li Shen cupped his fists in greeting at the Golden Fox Army’s senior commander, and happiness beamed from his face. The two of them were quite familiar with each other.

“Patriarch Li Sen,” Liu Yu who had just arrived smiled and greeted Li Shen, “I’m here under the Lord’s order, and luckily, I’m not too late.”

Upon hearing Liu Yu say that it was the Golden Fox Dao Venerable who had sent him, Li Shen was even happier.

Moments later, the army of several million arrived, stopping opposite Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and Old Monster Flame.
