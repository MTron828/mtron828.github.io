Chapter 3702 – Fighting For His Life

The moment the hole appeared, a torrent of swords shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

In the blink of an eye, the entire world was filled with black swords.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath.

No one had ever been able to punch a hole through the defenses of the Star Dragon Divine Tree before!

It was evident that the other party’s strength far exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s own!

A snort left the Heaven Devouring King’s lips when he saw the expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you’re unbeatable because of your Star Dragon Divine Tree?! You’re too naive!”

“The Star Dragon Divine Tree might be strong, but you’re too weak!”

“Your cultivation is far from being able to stand against me!”

As the words left his lips, the black swords in the skies flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

Flames covered his body as Huang Xiaolong’s expression sank.

The four Universe Origin Fires emerged as the divine beasts blocked off the black swords soaring towards his head.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. He stepped on the Yin Yang Flame Wheel and he rushed towards the Heaven Devouring King at a shocking speed! Even though he hadn’t reached the peak of the grand completion stage, his speed was terrifying! With the assistance of the Yin Yang Flame Wheel, he arrived in an instant.

The Three Gods Halberd and Reversal Sword struck at the Heaven Devouring King’s chest.

Right before they could touch the man, he waved his hand and the golden swords appeared to stop the weapons.

Clang!

A resounding blast filled the Devil Abyss.

Not only did Huang Xiaolong fail to break through the curtain of black swords, but he was forced to retreat.

The Heaven Devouring King flicked his finger once and the rain of black swords continued.

Huang Xiaolong dodged left and right in order to avoid the deadly attacks.

Even with the Golden Sun Circlets, Star Dragon Divine Tree, Yin Yang Flame Wheels, Three Gods Halberd, Reversal Sword, and the four Universe Origin Fires, he was still struck once by a single strand of sword qi. Blood spurted from his wound.

Of course, it healed in an instant.

The Heaven Devouring King sneered, “The Star Dragon Divine Tree really deserves its name as the second-ranked universe treasure. Its regeneration ability is insanely powerful…”

The sword qi he summoned was no ordinary sword qi. The wound would continue to rot if one was struck by the sword qi. Despite that, the star dragon qi allowed Huang Xiaolong to recover completely. One could easily see how terrifying the star dragon qi was.

“Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would grab all their weapons… with the Blade of Death you’re hiding, you should have seven universe treasures, right?” The Golden Cymbals King roared with laughter.

The Heaven Devouring King continued, “Alright. We won’t have to look for them one by one.”

“Huang Xiaolong, hand them over! No matter how much you struggle, it’s useless!”

“I laid down the Star Gathering Sword Formation around half the Devil Abyss. You won’t be able to escape unless you defeat me! Do you really think that’s going to happen?”

A smug expression could be seen on the Heaven Devouring King’s face.

Huang Xiaolong frowned in response.

During the exchange earlier, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the Heaven Devouring King’s strength had far exceeded his expectations. Even with all the treasures he had, he couldn’t bridge the gap between their strength.

The Heaven Devouring King’s combat strength neared the 29 billion mark. As a half-step Universe God, the Heaven Devouring King’s cultivation was far higher than Huang Xiaolong’s! His grand cosmos energy hadn’t broken through the 27 billion mark and he was only at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm! The difference between them was far too large.

Other than the Heaven Devouring King, the Golden Cymbals King was being an annoying b*stard who was waiting at the side.

Even that annoying golden-robed weirdo posed a threat to him!

Was he really going to have to expose the Universe Boat?!

The moment he used it, the Black Nether King might personally hunt him down!

Even with the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to hold up against the Black Nether King.

He might be able to gain the assistance of the Ferocious Devil, but that wouldn’t be enough!

The Heaven Devouring King sneered when he saw the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Since you’re unwilling to hand them over, I’ll show you what despair feels like!” Black light revolved around his body after he spoke. Every time it grew a little wider, the entire world around them would turn a little darker.

The darkness around his body grew to fill the space within the Devil Abyss.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression changed slightly.

He knew that that was the Heaven Devouring King’s devouring ability.

His true form was a Heaven Devouring Beast that was born with the creation of the Thirteen Universes. He was the only creature of his race!

He had the ability to devour the entire Devil Land by himself!

That was how terrifying his ability was!

Huang Xiaolong’s Yin Yang Flame Wheel moved once again as he charged towards the Heaven Devouring King. The weapons shot out at the man as the Blade of Death appeared to stab at his eye.

It was completely useless.

Before he could arrive a hundred feet away from the Heaven Devouring King, he was sent flying. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The formless black energy around the Heaven Devouring King stopped anyone from coming close.

As the dark light that filled the Devil Abyss gathered together, they quickly tried to swallow Huang Xiaolong.

He could only retreat with haste.

The only way someone could resist the devouring power was if they were stronger than the Heaven Devouring King! Otherwise, not even their bones would remain.

When he retreated, the black light surged after him. It moved as quickly as Huang Xiaolong, and he eventually arrived at the edge of the Star Gathering Sword Formation.

The power of the formation stopped Huang Xiaolong from going any further.

Watching the black light approach, Huang Xiaolong was about to summon the Universe Boat. Luckily for him, a giant arm tore through the formation to smash at the sea of darkness.
