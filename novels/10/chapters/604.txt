The Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger was pummeled to the point where it could hardly summon the will to resist, allowing Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual force to break into its soul sea barrier and leave a soul imprint within. Then, the Zhu Family disciples watched dumbly as the dead dog Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger swallowed some unknown pellets given by Huang Xiaolong, and in the next second, its vitality returned, becoming lively and energetic as if it was never injured in the first place.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong was about to leave with the four demonic beasts, the Zhu Family’s Zhu Feirong couldn’t help blurting out: “Stop!”

Huang Xiaolong halted his step and turned his head over his shoulder.

There was only the barest of hesitation as Zhu Feiroinf pointed at the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger, claiming, “This Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger is ours, you cannot take it away.”

Their main purpose in making this trip to the Great Wasteland was to search for a Fourth or Fifth Order God Realm Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger. They had been looking high and low for over a month’s time, coming across their target with much difficulty. Naturally, they couldn’t allow this young man to take it away just like that.

“I cannot take it away? Then?” Huang Xiaolong’s mocking tone was obvious despite his cold voice.

Noting Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Zhu Feirong frowned slightly with dissatisfaction: “Which family are you from? We’re disciples of the Zhu Family from the Last Gods World. Leave the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger behind, I can give you ten million Xuanwu coins.”

Huang Xiaolong nearly—no, he laughed out loud hearing these words. Ten million Xuanwu coins?

When Huang Xiaolong finally stopped laughing, he scoffed in retort, “If we’re going by market price, ten million Xuanwu coins will only get you a Third Order God Realm demonic beast. A late-Fifth Order God Realm ancient fierce demonic beast like this Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger is worth a few hundred million, are you taking me for a fool?”

Zhu Feirong reddened, however, another Zhu Family disciple stepped forward, interjecting rudely, “We spotted this Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger first, if you want to take it away, I hope you will first consider the consequences. Things that belong to our Zhu Family are not so easy to steal.”

Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted. These Zhu Family disciples truly had skin thicker than average people.

If it weren’t due to his aura, as well as his three demonic beasts that alerted the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger, these bunch of Zhu Family disciples would most likely be dead by its claws by now. He, subjugating this Nine-tail Bright Radiance Tiger, could be considered as half their savior, yet the other side actually claimed that he was stealing their things?

Huang Xiaolong laughed in spite of his rising anger, “Zhu Family? Pardon me, what little thing is this Zhu Family, I have no idea.”

These words instantly enraged the group of ZhuFamily disciples. Coincidentally, at this moment, noises of rustling wind sounded in the air as more than a dozen people flew toward their location at high speed.

When the Zhu Family disciples saw the faces of these newcomers, their faces brightened with delight.

“Big brother Zhu Yu, you’re all here!” Zhu Feiring stepped forward, crying out happily.

A young man with golden-irises and vermillion red hair nodded at Zhu Feirong before asking, “What is it?”

Zhu Feirong pointed at Huang Xiaolong, explaining, “We encountered this Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger, but who knew that this brat would suddenly jump out of nowhere, stealing it from us. Not only did he injure several of our Zhu Family disciples, he even killed a few others.”

Those people were killed by the Nine-tail Bright Radiance Tiger, but now, all the blame fell on Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Even Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect this level of shamelessness from Zhu Feirong, spouting lies with his eyes open. Then, he smiled simply. He didn’t want to kill these Zhu Family disciples, but since this was the way things were, then...!

His gaze swept over the newcomers. Amongst the twelve people, there were two early Sixth Order God Realm, while that vermillion haired young man called Zhu Yu was the strongest, close to peak early Sixth Order God Realm. Of the other remaining ten, three were peak late-Fifth Order God Realm, and the other seven people were a mix of late, mid, and peak mid-Fifth Order God Realm.

It seems like, with this many strong characters, these Zhu Family disciples were probably thinking that he was a fish on a chopping board?

Zhu Yu looked at Huang Xiaolong, then his eyes roamed over the four demonic beasts behind him. A tiny frown wrinkled his forehead as he thought for a moment before saying to Huang Xiaolong, “Snatching our Zhu Family’s things and killing our Zhu Family’s disciples, even so, I will not make things hard for you. As long as you leave the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger, that Blazing Stonedragon Beast, and also one of your arms, we can let you go.”

Not make things difficult for you!

Leave the Nine-tail Bright Radiance Tiger and that Blazing Stonedragon Beast!

And an arm!

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, laughing. His laugh was a bit sinister.

Without any warning, he made his move. The Mulberry Sword in his hand shot out a curtain of sword energy that enveloped an area of hundred li. The bone-deep penetrating killing intent greatly alarmed the Zhu Family disciples.

Sharp sword lights glinted and ten or so Zhu Family disciples were clutching their necks, staring at Huang Xiaolong in fear before tumbling to the ground.

“You, courting death!” Zhu Yu did not expect Huang Xiaolong to suddenly attack, moreover, killing close to a dozen Zhu Family disciples in front of him. Angered, he let out a furious bellow at Huang Xiaolong.

However, just as he was about to retaliate, an overwhelming energy slammed down on him. Startled, Zhu Yu swiftly changed his move to defensive one.

A resounding boom echoed in the air.

Zhu Yu’s body shook, then he staggered a few steps back.

The two Strongarm Water-Fire Apes continued to attack.

Zhu Yu was both anxious and angry: “Beasts!”

The Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger targeted the other early Sixth Order God Realm disciples, while the Blazing Stonedragon and Huang Xiaolong picked off the rest of them. The tiger aimed at disciples of Fourth Order and below, while early, mid, late, and peak late-Fifth Order disciples were all taken care of by Huang Xiaolong.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered to keep his identity a secret, displaying his Asura Physique and summoning the twin dragon martial spirits to soul transform. The sword below his feet and the thousand arms behind him acted at the same time.

The Godly Xumi Art executed the Fifteenth Move of the Dragon God at full force, sending more than ten of Zhu Family’s early Fifth Order God Realm disciples flying into the air. Falling to the ground, the air they exhaled was more than the air going in.

Seeing this, Zhu Yu, Zhu Feirong, and the rest roared ceaselessly with fury.

Despite Zhu Yu’s strength being close to a peak early Sixth Order God Realm, it wasn’t an easy matter for him to defeat the two Strongarm Water-Fire Apes in a short time. In fact, he couldn’t even disentangle himself from them.

On the other side, the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger was doing a great job of delaying the other early Sixth Order God Realm master, rendering him unable to help the rest or battle Huang Xiaolong.

As for disciples below Fourth Order God Realm, the Blazing Stonedragon Beast had them jumping and running all over clutching their backside whilst howling in misery.

Practically at every ten breaths interval, there’d be a disciple sent flying by Huang Xiaolong. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, there were only four peak late-Fifth Order God Realm disciples struggling to maintain the situation. However, under Huang Xiaolong’s fierce attack, these four people’s defeat was a given.

Zhu Yu watched as the Zhu Family’s Fifth Order God Realm disciples were killed by Huang Xiaolong one after another. Whilst greatly angered, fear had started to wind around his heart. A mere Fourth Order God Realm disciple had such a terrifying attack power? Even with his knowledgeable eyes, this was unprecedented.

Also, Huang Xiaolong’s speed was actually not slower than theirs.

‘How can this be!’

He himself was an early Sixth Order God Realm, close to peak early Sixth Order God Realm, whereas Huang Xiaolong was just a Fourth Order God Realm!

Half an hour later.

Huang Xiaolong’s icy stare swept over Zhu Yu and another disciple named Li Mingzhu, a disciple of the Zhu Family. The Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger and the four beasts encircled Zhu Yu and the other. Corpses lay all around them, increasing the thick scent of blood.

“Who are you exactly?” Zhu Yu’s voice was low and grim, suppressing the overflowing anger on his chest. “You won’t be able to run even if you kill us as our family’s Grand Elder is watching over the transmission array. You too will die here in this Great Wasteland World!”
