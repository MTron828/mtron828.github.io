Chapter 3190: Sixth Princess of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire

Feeling the pressure rolling off Di Xiaolong, Gu Chunguang couldn’t help but chuckle helplessly. “This little brat hasn’t been so triggered for quite some time…”

The middle aged man clad in golden robes laughed, “The herbs are extremely important to him right now. It’s no wonder he’s angry.” Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, he continued, “This little brat is really daring… He dared to go against the third prince of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire...”

Gu Chunguang sniggered softly, “Who would have thought that someone like that would appear? How talented do you think this kid really is?”

“Are you planning to take him in as your disciple?” The golden robed man was stunned for a second.

Nodding slowly, Gu Chunguang muttered, “Maybe…” However, he shook his head the next second. “Never mind. It’s been forever since I last accepted a disciple. There’s no need for me to accept one now.”

“You’re just a lazy b*stard. Everyone in the Blazing Dragon World knows that you’re too lazy to take a disciple.”

“Brother Di Yu, it’s no wonder we’re best friends!”

…

In the plaza…

“Thirty-one trillion!” When everyone was shocked by Di Xiaolong’s strength, another bid was called. The person who called it had a lovely voice, and everyone turned to stare at the source of the voice in shock. No one expected anyone to continue bidding, and the price had long since exceeded the worth of the herbs on auction.

Even if one had the money to do so, no one in their right mind would continue to bid!

As the voice came from one of the pavilions above, everyone looked at the people sitting within. Their gazes landed on a noble lady who looked extremely graceful and poised.

The design embroidered in her robes was extremely special, and it gave off an enchanting vibe.

“It’s the Sixth Princess of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire!” Someone screamed in shock.

Sixth Princess of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire!

The entire plaza erupted.

In the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, First, Second, and Third Heaven were the princes who held the most power! However, it was different for the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire. The person who had the highest authority under the Extreme Heaven Celestial Emperor was none other than the Sixth Princess herself!

No one knew when she appeared in the auction, not even experts at the level of the Golden Bamboo Old Ancestor.

Di Xiaolong, who was adamant about obtaining the herbs, cupped his fists the moment he saw her. The anger in his heart disappeared instantly, and he laughed, “ Who would have thought that Princess Zeng Ying would personally appear for the auction?”

Zeng Ying smiled in response, “Prince Di Xiaolong, well met.”

When she smiled, it was as though the heavens lost its color. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Gu Chunguang frowned when he looked at Zeng Ying. “What a pity… What a pity…”

The golden robed young man seemed to know what Gu Chunguang meant, and a weird expression formed on his face. The old man was probably thinking that it was a pity Zeng Ying didn’t belong to the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire.

“Thirty-two trillion.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air when everyone was still staring at the princess.

His bid was like a bomb that exploded in everyone’s head.

Even Di Xiaolong couldn’t understand what was going on.

Instead of reacting like Di Xiaolong, Zeng Ying smiled and continued to raise the bid. “Thirty-three trillion.”

“Thirty-four.”

“Thirty-five.”

…

As the battle between them started to heat up, the price soon reached a whooping forty trillion dao coins.

Everyone present felt their throats going dry.

“Forty… Forty trillion dao coins?! Are they crazy or do they have something against money?!”

At their level, they were no longer bidding for the item in the auction. They were merely messing about with money!

Those present in the plaza finally learned what the words ‘filthy rich’ meant. Dao coins were nothing in the eyes of the two super monsters who had an inexhaustible amount of wealth.

Huang Xiaolong finally turned to look at her when the price reached forty trillion. Raising an eyebrow in response, he muttered the words, “Fifty trillion.”

Fifty trillion!

Many experts felt their hearts trembling when they heard the bid. Their vision threatened to go dark, and the only thing left in their minds was the concept of fifty trillion dao coins.

Even Caretaker Pang behind Di Xiaolong gasped in shock. “This... This brat is insane!”

He couldn’t understand why anyone would use fifty trillion to buy several stalks of herbs!

Even though the Flower of Time and Void Reincarnation Thistle were extremely precious treasures, they weren’t useful for just anyone! Even Di Xiaolong, the third prince of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, wasn’t confident that he could comprehend the power of space and time even if he refined them all!

Things would be different if he actually had fifty trillion dao coins. He could buy many things with the money, and to put it in context, a massive manor in the Exiled Dragon City’s heart only cost three hundred billion. How many manors could one buy with fifty trillions?!

Zeng Yin finally hesitated when she heard Huang Xiaolong’s bid of fifty trillion. A soft chuckle left her lips. “Fellow cultivator is really determined to obtain the herbs. As such, I shall be pulling out of the competition.”

The batch of herbs was finally bought by Huang Xiaolong at an extravagant fifty trillion dao coins.

When Di Xiaolong, You Wuyi, and the others saw how Huang Xiaolong handed over fifty trillion dao coins in exchange for her herbs, their expressions turned extremely complicated.

Huang Xiaolong turned into the center of attention for those present in an instant.

“Maybe he’s just a rich b*stard who’s trying to get our attention… He’s so happy that he managed to spend fifty trillion on several herbs… What a dumb*ss…” You Wuyi snorted.

The Mysterious Pool Black Devil chuckled to himself as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Soon after, several other treasures were auctioned off. Despite the fact that they were absolute treasures, the price of ten to twenty trillion no longer excited the audience.

Eventually, the final two items were put on sale.

“Now, we will be auctioning off the corpse of a creation level Universe Tyrant Dragon!”

Even Huang Xiaolong was stunned by the revelation.

A Tyrant Dragon was an absolute ruler of the Dragon Race. The bloodline of the Tyrant Dragon is no weaker than the Blazing Dragon!

The mysterious person who put it up on sale was crazy enough to sell away a Universe Tyrant Dragon corpse!

Even Di Xiaolong and Princess Zeng Ying failed to sit still in the pavilions.

When everyone was shocked, the auctioneer released the restrictions on a spatial artifact on stage and a massive dragon corpse appeared in front of their eyes. Even though it was just a corpse, the pressure it emitted caused everyone present to feel like a mountain was weighing down on their hearts.

Huang Xiaolong made some measurements, and he realized that the corpse of the Universe Tyrant Dragon was larger than Yuan Tianyi’s true body!

It managed to fill the entire space in the spatial artifact, and even a dragon scale from its body was as large as a city in the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire.

One could only imagine how large the Universe Tyrant Dragon was. In fact, it was one of the largest organisms in the entire universe!

The size alone shocked many experts present.

“This dragon was born with knowledge in twelve elements at perfection level!” The auctioneer continued.

Twelve elements at perfection level!

“By the request of the person who commissioned us to auction off the corpse, there shall be no starting price! Please make your bids now!”

“What?! Without a starting price, any one of us can make a bid!” Someone in the crowd screamed in excitement. It was as though those rich cultivators in the pavilion all rolled over and died or something.

As the plaza burst into fervent discussion, a voice rang through the air, “One hundred trillion dao coins.”

The voice was like a bucket of cold water that doused the enthusiasm of everyone in the plaza.
