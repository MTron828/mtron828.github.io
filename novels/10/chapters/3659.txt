Chapter 3660: Never Heard of You

Huang Xiaolong’s entire party stopped walking all of a sudden and they turned to stare at Chen Bi.

The look in their eyes caused his hair to stand on end.

“Banquet in the Maple Moon Pavilion? Bring the two ladies with me?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually.

“That’s right! It’s an order from Lord Zhu Ding and Lord Zhu Yuan!” Chen Bi muttered.

One of the disciples beside Chen Bi sneered all of a sudden, “You better know what’s good for you! If you offend the two lords, they’ll kick you off the mountain when you try to ascend tomorrow!”

“Oh? Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s tone turned a lot frostier.

Gui Chi cackled eerily and he opened his mouth slightly. The body of the disciple who just spoke dried up as his blood essence, dao soul, and all the energy contained within was sucked out. He turned into a dry corpse that scattered into dust.

Chen Bi and the rest of the disciples were shocked by the sudden change in situation. They stared at Gui Chi in fright! The disciple might not have comprehended thirteen elements to the grand perfection level, but he was still a respectable Dao Venerable who had comprehended twelve elements! Even so, he was killed in the blink of an eye!

None of them had seen anything like that happen before!

“You!” Chen Bi roared.

“Go tell the two clowns to scram. If they annoy me, I wouldn’t mind going to the Zhu Family myself to tear off their heads before using it as a football.” Huang Xiaolong whispered into Chen Bi’s ear.

Staring at him with his jaws agape, Chen Bi didn’t know how to react.

Huang Xiaolong brought everyone towards the foot of the mountain.

“Lord, just kill the two brats from the Zhu Family. After that, we’ll go behead that brat, Zhu Ji! We’ll use all their heads as footballs!” Gui Chi revealed a sinister smile and said.

Zhu Ji was the patriarch of the Zhu Family, and he was the celestial emperor of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire.

“The Heavenly Peak is about to open. We’ll talk about it later.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

When their exchange went down, the disciples of the Chen Family were still stuck in their place. They didn’t dare to move until Huang Xiaolong’s entire group disappeared into the distance.

“Young Master, that brat is too arrogant! We’ll report this to Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan!” Another disciple beside Chen Bi growled. “We’ll see how the two lords take care of them!”

“That’s right! How dare they kill the disciples of our Chen Family?”

The other disciples of the Chen Family yelled in unison.

Chen Bi looked at the disciple beside him and he said, “The two lords are still in the area. Go make the report to them right now. Tell them that the brat refused to listen to them and killed the disciples of our Chen Family!”

The disciple nodded and ran off.

“Oh right, tell Lord Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan everything the kid said! Tell them word for word!” Chen Bi added as the disciple was running away.

Word for word?

The disciple paused for a second and he recalled how Huang Xiaolong said that he would head over to the Zhu Family personally.

“Yes, young master! Please rest assured that I’ll make the report exactly how he said it!”

“Let’s go look for the old ancestor and Lord Du Chengjiang!” Chen Bi said to the rest after the disciple had left.

Very quickly, they managed to contact their old ancestor, Chen Bi*

“Lord Ancestor and Lord Du Chengjiang have already arrived at the foot of the mountain.” Chen Bi smiled. “Ancestor Chen Bi said that they are currently together with Lord Xu Fei.”

“Lord Xu Fei of the Xu Family?” The disciples of the Chen Family revealed excited looks too.

Lord Xu Fei was a God of Creation at the peak of the large completion stage. He was also from the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, and he had close to 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He was pretty famous in the territory.

“It’s great that Lord Xu Fei is there!” The disciples of the Chen Family jumped in joy.

Chen Bi chuckled, “Let’s hurry up then…”

“Yes, young master!”

When they headed to meet their ancestor, the disciple he sent out earlier found Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan. He told them exactly what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Did that kid actually say that?!” Zhu Ding growled.

“You better not be lying to us…” Zhu Yuan glared at the disciple and his expression darkened.

Falling to his knees, the disciple swore to the heavens. “On my life, I swear that I didn’t change a word he said! If I’m lying to Lords Zhu Yuan and Zhu Ding, my dao soul will scatter and I’ll die a horrible death! When you find the kid, you’ll know if that was what he said!”

“Hmm… Yeah, you wouldn’t dare to lie to us.” Zhu Ding looked at Zhu Yuan. “He dares to ignore the two of us! Let’s go to the foot of the mountain now and look for him!”

Zhu Yuan nodded. “Hey, he might have some sort of backing if he dares to speak to us like this. Let’s look for Lord Zhu Chenlong before doing anything else.”

Zhu Chenlong was a doyen of the Zhu Family and he was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. The two of them had been giving him lots of gifts and they could be considered acquainted with him.

“Alright! Let’s look for Lord Zhu Chenlong!”

…

Before long, Chen Bi and the other disciples of the Chen Family arrived at the foot of the mountain.

The clouds around the top were mostly scattered, but it should take a little more time for them to completely disappear.

They located their old ancestor and the ancestors of the Du and Xu family not too far away.

Hurrying over, the disciples greeted the old ancestors respectfully.

Ancestor Chen Bi allowed them to get up and he asked, “Didn’t you say that you had something to report to me? What’s so urgent?”

“Lord Ancestor, Chen Hongxin was killed by someone!” Chen Bi revealed a sorrowful expression and continued, “He was killed just a moment ago!”

“Oh?” Ancestor Chen Bi frowned. He knew who Chen Hongxin was. He was a core disciple of the Chen Family and his talent was extremely good! After all, those who were chosen to climb the Heavenly Peak were true geniuses of their factions.

Du Chengjiang and Xu Fei frowned.

“Do you know who the other party was?” Ancestor Chen Bi asked.

“He said that his father is called Huang Long and his name is Huang Xiaolong!” Chen Bi replied.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Huang Long? Huang Xiaolong?” A confused expression appeared on Ancestor Chen Bi’s face. He turned to look at the other two Gods of Creation and he asked, “Fellow cultivators, have you heard of them?”

Du Chenjiang and Xu Fei didn’t attend the Jian Family’s ceremony and didn’t know anything. They shook their heads slowly.

“I never heard of any Huang Family in our Zhu Lan Lands.” Xu Fei sighed. “All the other regions I’ve been to didn’t contain a Huang Family…”

“I never heard of anyone by the name of Huang Long or Huang Xiaolong either.”

Note: Chen Bi and Lord Ancestor Chen Bi, the two ‘Bi’ have different intonation and meaning.
