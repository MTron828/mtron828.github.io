Chapter 3694 – Dazzling Sun Princess

The captain stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence before bowing respectfully. He held the plaque in his hand as though it was the most important thing he has ever held.

The palace was large, and the guard needed several minutes to make the report. As such, Huang Xiaolong and the others were left standing outside.

Huang Xiaolong was casually chatting with the others when a cry filled the skies. “The Dazzling Sun Princess is returning to the palace, everyone else, please stay away!”

Huang Xiaolong and the others looked over only to see a group of experts riding devil dragons charging towards the palace.

The person leading the group was a pretty, yet aloof woman.

“Dazzling Sun Princess?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The Dragon Overlord and the rest shook their heads slowly. It was clear they hadn’t heard of her.

The only person who stood out to respond to Huang Xiaolong’s question was the Nefarious Golden Master. “Lord, the Dazzling Sun Princess is the daughter of Mo Kun’s youngest son. Several hundred thousand years ago, Mo Kun’s youngest son married a concubine and she gave birth to the Dazzling Sun Princess. On the day she was born, a miraculous sight was seen as a myriad of devils appeared in the skies. She was doted on by Mo Kun after her birth, and her title was granted by Mo Kun himself.

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

It seemed as though she was pretty talented if she could catch Mo Kun’s eye. After all, he had thousands of descendants. Not everyone would be able to gain his approval.

When the Dazzling Sun Princess saw Huang Xiaolong’s group standing at the entrance of the imperial palace, she couldn’t help but frown.

“Are those guests of our empire?” She turned to ask someone beside her.

As the strongest celestial empire in the Unknown Space, there were many guests coming over to pay their respects.

She had seen too many of them, and she felt a sense of ire whenever she ran into them. She felt that all of them wanted nothing more than to latch on to her great celestial empire.

“Probably…” The middle aged man beside her snorted, “These peasants have no idea what they’re doing. How dare they block the entrance of our imperial palace?! I’ll chase them away right now!”

In the eyes of the experts of the Devil Capital Celestial Empire, everyone who came to pay their respects were peasants! After all, the Ferocious Devil was the strongest expert there!

As the ruler of the Unknown Space, even other supreme overlords would have to listen to the Ferocious Devil!

As such, he rode towards Huang Xiaolong’s group hastily and he snorted arrogantly, “Are you here to pay your respects? Can’t you see that Her Highness is currently returning to the palace?! Scram!”

Huang Xiaolong and the others didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when they heard what he said.

The guards tried to explain, but he was brushed aside.

The middle-aged man flew into a fit of rage when he heard their laughter ringing in his ear. “What are you slaves laughing at?! Didn’t you hear what I said?! F*ck off!”

“Kneel and welcome Her Highness into the palace!”

When had the Dragon Overlord and the others been ordered to kneel?! Their expressions sank instantly.

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “You can cripple them.”

The One Essence Master who was standing beside the Nefarious Golden Master in the last row casually pointed at the middle aged man. He was sent flying in an instant.

When he landed, the meridians in his body were shattered beyond belief. His dao heart was in a million pieces and his dao soul was damaged. The dragon beast he rode on wasn’t spared as it was reduced to cosmic dust.

Despite his injuries, the middle-aged man didn’t bleed a single drop of blood.

No one could react in time when he was crippled by the One Essence Master.

The Dazzling Sun Princess gasped in fright as she looked at the middle-aged man who was sent flying towards her.

Someone actually dared to make a move against someone in the imperial family right in front of the palace!

The person they injured was her subordinate!

The experts behind her were equally as shocked. They were used to being the biggest bullies wherever they went! They would be treated with utmost respect!

Even great ancestors of the various super families would treat them respectfully!

Who would dare to move against them?

When the middle-aged man landed on the ground, he felt as though the world was crumbling around him when he felt his shattered meridians.

Screaming with rage, he pointed at Huang Xiaolong while cursing, “You… How dare you cripple me?!”

“You dog slaves, how dare you touch me!”

He was a subordinate of the Dazzling Sun Princess!

Running over to her side, he got to his knees and he cried, “Your Highness, please seek justice on my behalf! You cannot allow these peasants to get away!”

“Kill him.” Huang Xiaolong had enough of his foul mouth.

The One Essence Master pointed at the man with a single finger.

This time, he exploded like an overinflated balloon.

However, there was no blood to be seen.

The Dazzling Sun Princess looked at his corpse in shock.

“He’s dead?!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He might not be the strongest among her subordinates, but he was one of the subordinates she liked the most. After all, he was the best at flattery.

“You!” She glared at Huang Xiaolong and the others. “Preposterous! How dare you do this?!” Turning around, she yelled at the rest of her subordinates, “Are all of you useless?! Hurry up and contact the experts in the palace to kill these criminals!”

Snapping back to reality, they started to send out cries for reinforcement.

The guards standing at the gates didn’t know what to do.

After the experts behind her contacted the forces in the palace, the Dazzling Sun Princess saw the entrance to the palace opening wide as countless godly experts rushed out.

The person in the lead was a middle-aged man clad in golden devil robes.

He wasn’t Mo Kun, but he was the second strongest expert in the celestial empire, Devouring Devil! His status was second only to Kun Mo!

The Dazzling Sun Princess also discovered that there were countless eminent elders and marshals running behind Devouring Devil!
