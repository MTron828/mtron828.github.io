Listening to the familiar voice calling him uncle, Huang Xiaolong smiled even wider.

Following this, an aromatic smell assailed his nose.

Huang Xiaolong’s face froze. This girl is still the same—she doesn’t care that everyone is looking at us.

With the beauty in his arms, Huang Xiaolong glanced at Zhao Lei, Golden Brow, and the others who were coincidentally looking up and counting the stars in the sky. They acted as if they had no idea what was happening before them.

Huang Xiaolong patted the shoulders of the beauty in his arms.

Bei Xiaomei finally released Huang Xiaolong and greeted Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao, “Sister Xuanxuan, sister Peng Xiao, nice to see you.”

Fang Xuanxuan blinked her eyes playfully and teased, “I thought that Little Sister Xiaomei has eyes only for her uncle! Did you finally notice us?”

Peng Xiao smiled and nodded her head.

Bei Xiaomei’s face turned red, and she pouted, “Sister Xuanxuan only knows how to bully others!” She then shook Huang Xiaolong’s hand, “Uncle, you really must discipline sister Xuanxuan!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly.

Elder Fu, who was behind Bei Xiaomei, stepped forward and greeted Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Everyone then made their way to the Silver Fox Commerce headquarters as they made jokes.

“Sister Xuanxuan, we have also heard about what happened to Uncle Fang.” Once everyone arrived at the headquarters and sat down, Bei Xiaomei spoke to Fang Xuanxuan, “Don’t worry, we will use all the resources to track down Uncle Fang. As long as Uncle Fang is still in the Divine World, there should be news soon.”

Fang Xuanxuan said gratefully, “Xiaomei, thank you for your help.”

Bei Xiaomei smiled sweetly, “What’s there to thank?” Speaking up to this point, she then turned to Zhao Lei and said, “Uncle Zhao, our Silver Fox Commerce is planning to leave for the Heavenly Stage in a few days. If you all are not busy, how about going together with us a few days later?”

The Heavenly Stage was an essential place of the Heavenly Court as it was where the Battle of the Heavenly Court was held.

When Zhao Lei heard what she said, he couldn’t help but look at Huang Xiaolong. Even though Li Shan and he were supposed to be leading the team, both of them still needed to consult Huang Xiaolong for his opinion.

Both Bei Xiaomei and Elder Fu were puzzled when they saw Zhao Lei looking at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong simply smiled and said, “That’s good since we are not in a rush; there’s no problem heading there together!”

Bei Xiaomei was startled for a second before the sweet smile returned to her face. “Alright, then I will bring uncle and the rest of you to your palace to rest.” She then eagerly got up and pulled Huang Xiaolong along, as if she was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would take back his words.

Huang Xiaolong revealed a weak smile towards Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao. With Bei Xiaomei’s personality, he knew that she would stick to him and pester him every day without fail. It seemed as though his ears were about to undergo an ordeal.

However, the two of them looked as if they were enjoying his misery.

“Xiaomei, is your Silver Fox Commerce taking part in the Battle of the Heavenly Court this time around?” Huang Xiaolong asked after Bei Xiaomei pulled him out of the inner hall.

Bei Xiaomei nodded her head and giggled, “In the past, my Silver Fox Commerce rarely took part in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, but the battle this time around is a little special. My father brought some of the younger generations of disciples from the branch to participate. Moreover, even though I am not participating in the battle this time around, Elder Fu’s direct disciple is taking part in my place!”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised and looked back at Elder Fu.

Elder Fu laughed modestly, “My disciple is purely going to join in the fun. As for getting into the rankings, I’m not hoping for much.”

Bei Xiaomei laughed, “Elder Fu, don’t be so humble! Uncle! Elder Fu’s direct disciple isn’t weak at all. Even though his talent isn’t as good as you, he’s a lot stronger than Sun Shihai of your Emperor Palace! Moreover, his combat strength is also extremely terrifying. I’m certain that you are no match for him. After all, he is already at the Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second.

Is his talent even better than Sun Shihai? Not only is Sun Shihai a supreme genius, but he also has an Archdevil bloodline! Everyone knows this... So for Elder Fu’s disciple to be more talented than Sun Shihai, he should be pretty exceptional in his own right!

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s stunned expression, Bei Xiaomei chuckled, “How is it, are you surprised? However, you don’t have to worry so much. When the Battle of the Heavenly Court commences, I will instruct him to go easy on you. However, we can’t let you win like that, so when the time comes, I’ll just ask him to fight to a draw with you.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know whether to cry or laugh, “If you ask him to fight to a draw with me deliberately, won’t your father skin you alive when he finds out? Moreover, will Elder Fu even agree?”

Elder Fu chuckled but didn’t say anything.

Bei Xiaomei frowned and said, “My father definitely won’t skin me alive! You might not know, but since father saw senior little cow, he has been asking about her all the time! He reminded me to get close to you at all costs!”

Huang Xiaolong broke out in a cold sweat.

Get as close to him as possible?

Did Bei Lengyang really say that?

Zhao Lei and Li Shan felt as though a bomb had gone off in their minds.

The president of the Silver Fox Commerce wants his daughter to get closer to Huang Xiaolong?!

Who was Bei Lengyang? He was the president of the number one chamber of commerce in the Divine World and was the richest man alive! Moreover, the influence and power of the Silver Fox Commerce was something that was beyond Fortune Emperor Palace.

Even if Huang Xiaolong had a king of supreme godhead, there should still be no reason for Bei Lengyang to act this way.

Everyone chatted and laughed amongst themselves, and after a long walk through a garden, they arrived in front of a palace.

“Uncle, for the next few days, stay here with us.” Bei Xiaomei smiled and then turned to Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao, “Sister Xuanxuan, sister Peng Xiao, do you want to accompany me to go shopping later?”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao laughed, “Alright.”

However, when Huang Xiaolong heard their plan, a bitter smile appeared on his face.

Sure enough, Bei Xiaomei turned around and declared, “Uncle, you have to accompany us later!”

After about an hour, Bei Xiaomei, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao dragged Huang Xiaolong out of the Silver Fox Commerce.

Huang Xiaolong naturally attracted a lot of attention as he walked beside these three beauties. Not long after he left the Silver Fox Commerce, some of the Emperor Palace’s disciples nearby looked at him and started discussing fervently amongst themselves.

“Who’s that brat? To be able to serve as the attendant of young lady Bei Xiaomei, he can consider himself to be quite lucky.”

“He should be the Fortune Emperor Palace’s king of supreme godhead disciple, Huang Xiaolong. Even though he has quite the fame, he offended the Brightness Emperor Palace and the Fiend God Emperor Palace. He won’t be able to survive much longer. Both of them have sent out word that they will take care of him during the Battle of the Heavenly Court and make sure that he won’t participate in the semi-finals.

“Could this brat really be the Grandmist Emperor’s illegitimate child? He even dares to offend the Brightness Emperor Palace and Fiend God Emperor Palace at the same time!”

“Pui, what illegitimate child? He ascended from the lower world and shouldn’t be related to the Grandmist Emperor Palace at all. Why would the Brightness Emperor Palace and Fiend God Emperor Palace dare to take action against him so openly?”

“Nobody knows if that brat has broken through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm. If he has, then I’m afraid that it will not be so easy to take care of him.”

“Isn’t it impossible for him to reach the Heavenly Monarch Realm with less than a thousand years of cultivation? Moreover, rumors are going around that he has only cultivated for four hundred years... I don’t believe he will be able to break through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm within four hundred years!”

The three ladies frowned when they heard everyone gossiping about Huang Xiaolong.

As for the person in question, he didn’t seem concerned at all. He acted as if he couldn’t hear them.

At this time, a commotion broke out as a group of disciples from the Fiend God Emperor Palace flew from afar.

“It’s the Fiend God Emperor Palace! That red-haired young man must be the young master of the Fiend God Emperor Palace!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
