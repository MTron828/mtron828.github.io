Chapter 3377: Location of the Pangu Sword

“Are you looking for the Pangu Axe?” Mu Shuihan asked cautiously.

From the looks of it, Mu Shuihan definitely knew some clues on the whereabouts of the Pangu Axe.

“That’s right. I need it for something important,” Huang Xiaolong admitted it directly.

Mu Shuihan couldn’t help but hesitate.

“If you tell me the location of the Pangu Axe, I’ll help you break through to the Immortal King Realm immediately,” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Even though Huang Xiaolong could search through Mu Shuihan’s soul directly, he still gave him a choice.

“What?! Assist me in breaking through to the Immortal King Realm?!” Mu Shuihan was stunned for a second, but he shook his head and laughed the next moment. “How can it be so easy to break through?”

Even Holy Emperors would find it difficult to help a peak late-Ninth Level Grand Gathering Immortal break through to the Immortal King Realm.

It was clear that he thought Huang Xiaolong was lying.

Taking out a bottle of pills, Huang Xiaolong tossed it over to Mu Shuihan.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong suspiciously, Mu Shuihan opened the bottle carefully. The moment he did, he was shocked. There were more than a dozen dazzling golden pills in the jade bottle, and grand dao laws poured out from them.

“Grand… Grand dao pills!” Mu Shuihan felt his hands trembling.

These are grand dao pills created by a Combined Dao Ancestor!

Only existences at their level could refine pills like that.

“That’s right. These are top-grade grand dao pills,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Mu Shuihan felt his hands going numb all of a sudden.

Top-grade grand dao pills?!

Even though he could tell that those were grand dao pills, he had no idea how good they were! After all, he was a mere Grand Gathering Immortal. He was frightened by Huang Xiaolong’s revelation!

Even Holy Emperors might not be able to get their hands on pills at that level, and there was no need to mention the celestial emperor of the Heavenly Court!

“Sen… Senior… I…” Mu Shuihan felt his throat going dry. The way he looked at Huang Xiaolong changed completely.

“As long as you tell me the whereabouts of the Pangu Axe, the entire bottle is yours.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “Breaking through to the Immortal King Realm will be as easy as breathing with the pills.”

With Mu Shuihan’s talent, it was true that entering the Immortal King Realm with the help of the pills would be a foregone conclusion.

Mu Shuihan fell to his knees instantly. “Please accept my gratitude!”

He might not know who Huang Xiaolong was, but he was not a fool. He realized that since Huang Xiaolong could bring out a bottle of grand dao pills so casually, he was not a weakling.

In fact, he could finally tell that Huang Xiaolong had the choice of searching his soul directly. It was true that Huang Xiaolong was being benevolent.

Mu Shuihan wasn’t wrong. Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of familiarity with Mu Shuihan due to his origin on Earth. That was the reason behind his actions.

“Get up. I’m from Earth too,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Mu Shuihan was startled. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to also come from Earth.

“Senior, I do indeed know the location of the Pangu Axe… However…” Mu Shuihan hesitated slightly.

“Speak.”

“The Pangu Axe is in the hands of the Heaven Piercing Sage. However, he hasn’t appeared in a long time,” Mu Shuihan explained.

“Heaven Piercing?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Isn’t he a disciple of Pangu?”

Mu Shuihan bowed respectfully. “Yes. The Heaven Piercing Sage is God Pangu’s disciple.”

“Is there really nobody who knows where he is?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

If he couldn’t find the Pangu Axe, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to enter the Kun Lun Secret Region. That wasn’t something he wanted to happen.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Perhaps his disciples might know where he went,” Mu Shuihan guessed.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Heaven Piercing Sage had four disciples, and they were the Myriad Treasures Dao Master, Golden Spirit Goddess, Wudang Goddess, and Tortoise Spirit Goddess.

“Do you know where any of them are?”

Mu Shuihan sighed, “Many years ago, the four of them entered the Holy Emperor Realm. With their exalted status, they haven't appeared in the world for a long time. There aren’t many people who know where they are. However, the Holy Pavilion might be able to track some of them down.”

“Holy Pavilion?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

“That’s right!” Mu Shuihan continued, “The Holy Pavilion is created by six sages. Their power encompasses all five continents, and they have a branch set up in the various regions. Not only do they sell precious herbs and pills, but they also sell important information regarding anything you wish to know. As long as you have enough money, they should be able to locate the people you wish.”

“The branch master of the Holy Pavilion in the Northern Dragon Region is familiar with me, and I can bring Senior over to look for him.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

“Should we head over there now?” Mu Shuihan asked cautiously.

Huang Xiaolong raised his head to see that night was falling and muttered, “I’m not in a rush. We can head over there tomorrow.”

Mu Shuihan bowed respectfully in response.

As such, Huang Xiaolong’s party stayed for a day in the immortal region in the Shushan Immortal Gate.

The immortal region was owned by Mu Shuihan, and he was the only person who lived there. Even the patriarch of the Shushan Immortal Gate would have to make a report to him before entering. Zhou Wanshan and Zhang Pu felt as though they were living in a dream when they were allowed to remain behind.

Huang Xiaolong introduced all of them to Mu Shuihan in succession.

When Mu Shuihan heard that Liu Huang was also from Earth, and that he was the Devil Hell Master, a sense of veneration formed in his heart. Before he ascended, he had long since heard the reputation of the Devil Hell.

“Bao’er’s talent is pretty impressive. He’s comparable to you when it comes to cultivation. You should take him into the Shushan Immortal Gate,” Huang Xiaolong pointed at the kid and said. “If you’re free, give him some pointers.”

Yan Bao’er bowed when he heard what Huang Xaiolong said. “Ancestor, please accept me as your disciple.”

Mu Shuihan helped Yan Bao’er up and smiled. “There’s no need for the formalities.” Turning to Huang Xiaolong, he asked, “Why don’t I take him in as my direct disciple and make him the young patriarch of the Shushan Immortal Gate?”

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s strength had something to do with that, he had always been trying to look for a successor. Since Huang Xiaolong said that Yan Bao’er possessed talent comparable to Mu Shuihan’s, it was a no-brainer for him to accept Yan Bao’er as a disciple.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Do whatever you want.”

In his sweet voice, Yan Bao’er addressed Mu Shuihan as his master.

Liu Huang also successfully entered the Shushan Immortal Gate.

Calling for his oldest disciple, the current patriarch of the Shushan Immortal Gate, Mu Shuihan told him about the arrangements. He was to arrange for an apprenticeship ceremony for Yan Bao’er on the day after the next.

Mu Shuihan didn’t say much about Huang Xiaolong. All he told his disciple was to address him as ‘Senior Huang’.

When Wang Lin, the patriarch of the Shushan Immortal Gate, heard that Mu Shuihan had chosen Yan Bao’er as his direct disciple and to hold an apprenticeship ceremony for the kid, he didn’t know how to react.

Hasn’t master been in seclusion all this time?! How in the world did he find his successor?!

As dawn broke the next day, Mu Shuihan brought Huang Xiaolong towards the Holy Pavilion’s branch office.
