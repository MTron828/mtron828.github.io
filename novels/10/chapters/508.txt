Chapter 509: Half-Step God Realm Demonic Beasts

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong and his group arrived at the edge of the Dead Sea Gorge.

A large group of people stood in the air, with Huang Xiaolong at the front and Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the other experts behind Huang Xiaolong. For this trip, Huang Xiaolong only bought one thousand Saint realm experts with him.

One thousand Saint realm experts, moreover, all of them were high-level Saint realm, it was a sufficient force to uproot Deities Templar once and for all.

Everyone observed the surrounding deathly silence, coupled with the strange atmosphere, the lifeless Dead Sea Gorge. They looked solemn, increasing their vigilance. Space fluctuated erratically here, and even a high-level Saint realm expert needed to focus when crossing it. A small, careless mistake would result in one getting caught in an unpredictable space crack or swallowed by a space vortex.

Stopping briefly, Huang Xiaolong decided to transfer all the experts into the Godly Mt. Xumi in order to carry them forward with ease.

After he settled all the experts into the Godly Mt. Xumi, Huang Xiaolong swept away the black-colored energy hovering above the sea surface in front of him. With lightning speed, he dove into the thick layers of black fog.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure flew at breakneck speed inside the thick black fog. With his current strength surpassing a half-step God Realm, he had nothing to fear when facing a space crack or space vortex.

As Huang Xiaolong was shuttling through the black fog, space around him shook and actually collapsed. It crumbled down like a wall of bricks, revealing a space vortex several hundred square meters wide. A terrifying pulling force instantly enveloped Huang Xiaolong.

Just as the force was about to drag Huang Xiaolong into the vortex, a minuscule quiver ran through his body. Fifteen primordial divine dragons flew out, shattering the pulling force from the vortex in less than a second.

Feeling the weakening of the pulling force, Huang Xiaolong swiftly leaped away, leaving the area affected by the vortex’s pulling force.

Even though Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu managed to find out that Deities Templar’s headquarters was located in the Dead Sea Gorge, they did not have the exact position nor information of the situation there. Hence, Huang Xiaolong needed to search for it.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong stopped on an island located on the north side of the Dead Sea Gorge. After half a day of searching, Huang Xiaolong narrowed the location down to an area of several hundred thousand li in the northern part of the Dead Sea Gorge.

A vertical slit opened on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. Using the Eye of Hell, he surveyed the surroundings; he had a feeling that Deities Templar’s headquarters was close by in this sea region.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared in a flicker moments later as he continued flying northbound.

Half an hour later, he suddenly stopped midair. His eyes narrowed dangerously as he looked up ahead, flying at reduced speed. It didn’t take long before he came across an enormous island.

On the island, ancient towering trees touched the sky and long mountain range peaks undulated like a wave. On top of that, a group of odd looking flying demonic beasts was frolicking above the island.

The auras coming from these odd looking demonic beasts were extremely strong, alarming Huang Xiaolong. He could see that each one of these odd looking demonic beasts possessed the strength of half-step God Realm!

Sixteen creatures in total! Sixteen half-step God Realm demonic beasts!

“Sword Tiger Blackdragon, Two-faced Ghostape, Purplewing Fire Phoenix, all these demonic beasts are ancient species!” At this point, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s exclamation sounded from the Dragon Pearl.

A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. No doubt, this was Deities Templar’s headquarters.

However, it never occurred to Huang Xiaolong that Ying Tian would have such a generous hand as to use sixteen half-step God Realm ancient species demonic beasts patrolling the island’s airspace.

With these sixteen half-step God Realm ancient species demonic beasts guarding the island, it was practically an impregnable fort. Not other super force would be able to take half a step onto the island.

However, it was truly unfortunate, because today they were facing Huang Xiaolong.

“Sixteen half-step God Realm beast cores would be enough for you to break into late-Tenth Order Saint realm!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was exhilarated at the unexpected windfall, urging, “Little guy, quickly attack, we mustn’t let any of them escape!”

The amount of demonic essence energy in the ancient demonic beast species’ beast cores was twice as much as the average demonic beasts of the same level. These sixteen ancient species demonic beasts in front of Huang Xiaolong, if he could capture all of them and refine their cores, it would definitely help Huang Xiaolong’s strength rise another level.

Huang Xiaolong initiated Phantom Shadow, his figure reached one of the demonic beasts, the Sword Tiger Blackdragon, in a flicker. Before the Sword Tiger Blackdragon could react, Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed on its body, sending it to the ground below.

A loud rumbling sound came from the ground and even the enormous island quaked from the impact. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

A powerful suction force came from Huang Xiaolong, sucking the Sword Tiger Blackdragon into the Dragon Pearl, leaving it to Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi.

ROAR!

The other ancient species demonic beasts reacted, letting out thunderous roars and attacking Huang Xiaolong.

Monstrous demonic energy enveloped heaven and earth as if it wanted to perforate the space around Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong easily dodged the attack, blurring away in a flash to reappear above the Two-faced Ghostape. His palm slapped on its back and another tragic scream rang out as it too was sent crashing to the ground by Huang Xiaolong.

With a casual turn of a wrist, the Two-faced Ghostape was thrown to Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi inside the Dragon Pearl.

More than sixty thousand years ago, before Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s body was destroyed, his strength far exceeded the God Realm. But despite his current weakened state compared to his peak, handling these half-step God Realm beasts was an easy matter.

After only about a dozen breaths’ time, half of the demonic beast was thrown into the Dragon Pearl by Huang Xiaolong, suppressed by Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi. Huang Xiaolong practically dealt with one of them with each passing breath’s time.

After advancing into peak mid-Tenth Order Saint realm, his strength, battle qi, and True Dragon Physique were enhanced at least ten-fold. The current him could easily defeat a half-step God Realm without resorting to the Godly Xumi Art.

All of a sudden, an angry bellow rang in the high air. In the blink of an eye, several human figures flew to the air from different locations on the island, surrounding Huang Xiaolong.

The unusual quakes finally alerted the Deities Templar’s experts.

Watching these people’s arrival, Huang Xiaolong snorted coldly. In the blink of an eye, he brought Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the experts out from the Godly Mt. Xumi, having them deal with the Deities Templar’s experts while he continued dealing with the remaining demonic beasts.

The Deities Templar’s experts rushed toward Huang Xiaolong, preparing to attack the intruder, but the sudden appearance Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the many experts caused panic and confusion. The situation quickly flipped on the Deities Templar experts, causing them to run for their lives like headless chickens.

Before Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and one thousand Saint realm experts, the Deities Templar’s side retreated time and again, receiving a one-sided beating.

Before long, blood dyed the island’s soil red. The bloody odor overlapped with the salty scent of the sea.

Huang Xiaolong acted swiftly and fast, it didn’t take him long to capture the remaining ancient species demonic beasts and throw them to Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, bound and suppressed within the Dragon Pearl. Whereas the Deities Templar’s experts became ashen as they watched Huang Xiaolong easily capture the ancient species demonic beasts one by one.

Those were all half-step God Realm ancient species demonic beasts ah! If Huang Xiaolong was capable of dealing with those ancient species demonic beasts so easily, then his current level of strength...?!

When all was done, Huang Xiaolong’s figure flew down to the island, heading towards the biggest building. But just as he arrived above the main hall building, a dozen human silhouettes shot out from the building below at rapid speed, blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path.

These people were all Deities Templar’s Grand Elders. All of them were peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm experts, on par with Li Molin.

“Huang Xiaolong, it’s you!” The dozen people immediately recognized Huang Xiaolong.

“You really have guts, actually daring to come to our Deities Templar’s headquarters!” One of the Grand Elders snarled.

Just as that Grand Elder’s voice fell, he was greeted by a Great Void Divine Fist from Huang Xiaolong. His body exploded right then and there. Before the rest of the dozen Grand Elders could let out a word, forget reacting, the dozen of them died with a single punch from Huang Xiaolong’s fist.

Huang Xiaolong took out the Devils and Ghost Flag and the Poison Corpses Scarabs, allowing them to feast on the flesh and souls of the dead Deities Templar Grand Elders. All of these were top grade nourishment; waste not, want not.

Huang Xiaolong floated down lightly, landing in front of the main hall entrance.
