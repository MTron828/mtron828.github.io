Chapter 2744: How Strong Do You Think the Young Lord Is?

Cheng Yueyang grinned in agreement. “That sentence is right. Tang Jin, and Yuan Yue are the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s darlings. Soon, the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land would take action against Cangqiong Old Man !”

“In that case, Brother Chen will soon become the new master of Cangqiong Sacred Land after Cangqiong Old Man dies!” Gao Chen let out several loud chuckles. “This is very good news.”

Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, and others join in the laughter.

“Then, we’ll let Huang Xiaolong live a few more days.” Chen Birui sneered. “I’ll make a trip to see the Master of Tang Dragon Sacred Land to discuss cooperation. When Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s armies are here, we will activate the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s grand formation, and swoop down on Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man internally and externally, catching them by surprise.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this time, Cangqiong Old Man, Huang Xiaolong, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others were inside Cangqiong Main Manor’s hall. Sounds of laughter could be heard from time to time.

“Mansion Master Mo Zhi and Old Ancestor Long Jianfei, it has really been a long time, ah. I didn’t expect there would be a day where we’d meet again, moreover, in the Divine Tuo Holy World!” Cangqiong Old Man laughed heartily.

When Cangqiong Old Man was still in the Cangqiong Holy World, he was bound to have some association with experts like Mo Zhi and Long Jianfei. Hence, he was truly happy seeing familiar old faces again in a new place.

In the vast Divine Tuo Holy World, the joy of seeing these several old friends was hard to describe.

Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, Long Shengtian, Fen Yanzi, Zi Dongping, and the others too sighed inwardly at fate upon seeing Cangqiong Old Man again.

“Xiaolong, this is?” Cangqiong Old Man pointed at Duan Feng.

Duan Feng had never ventured out of the Yin Borer Race, much less appeared in public. Thus, it was no surprise that Cangqiong Old Man did not recognize Duan Feng.

Huang Xiaolong introduced Duan Feng to Cangqiong Old Man.

Cangqiong Old Man was inwardly astonished when he heard Huang Xiaolong mention that Duan Feng was a mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

“Brother Duan Feng!” Cangqiong Old Man rose and greeted Duan Feng with cupped fists.

Duan Feng quickly cupped his fists in return and insisted, “Lord Cangqiong need not be so courteous.”

Lord Cangqiong? Cangqiong Old Man was baffled by this salutation.

“I am currently working under the Young Lord,” Duan Feng explained in one concise sentence.

Cangqiong Old Man was slightly taken aback hearing that. “Young Lord? Xiaolong?” He looked at Huang Xiaolong. He still wasn’t aware that Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others held Huang Xiaolong in a high position.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded, “That’s right, Master. Duan Feng is now serving under me, and so are Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, Long Shengtian, and the others.”

“What?!” Cangqiong Old Man blurted out in shock. He looked at Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, Long Shengtian, Zi Dongping, and Fei Yanzi one by one.

Mo Zhi, this Otherworldly Mansion Master, is serving under my disciple?

Long Jianfei, the World River’s Dragon Fish Race’s old ancestor is also serving under my disciple?!

There’s also Fei Yanzi, the Flying Heaven Race’s old ancestor, the Alien Lands’ number one beauty. She is also my disciple’s subordinate…

His mind was in a scramble registering this information.

“Brother Cangqiong, all of us are indeed serving under the Young Lord,” Mo Zhi confirmed and stressed further, “So, we can be considered as one family now.”

One family?

Sometime later, Cangqiong Old Man finally recovered a little bit, and more or less accepted the truth before him. A part of him was happy for his disciple after learning that the people, who used to fight by his side were now his disciple’s subordinates.

Inwardly, he was still very much confused, and couldn’t figure out how his disciple had roped in Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, and others as his subordinates.

After all, Mo Zhi was no ordinary Primal Ancestor expert, and he was the Otherworldly Mansion’s master!

Moreover, Long Shengtian, Long Jianfei, and the rest, which one of them wasn’t an expert with a resounding reputation in the Alien Lands and World River, capable of gathering millions of experts with one call? They were the experts standing at the top of the pyramid. No wonder Cangqion Old Man couldn’t help but continue pondering about what could have prompted them to choose to follow his disciple?

He could see that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was at early Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the confusion on his master’s face, but he didn’t know how to explain.

“Master, there is one thing we should tell you first…” Huang Xiaolong began to recount the incident on the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak where he had destroyed Tang Jin’s, Yuan Yue’s, and Chu Zhouyun’s physical bodies.

He needed to give Cangqiong Old Man some mental preparation on this matter. After all, Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land’s armies would be knocking on their door soon.

“What?!” Cangqiong Old Man nearly jumped out of his skin when he heard that Huang Xiaolong had destroyed Tang Jin’s, Yuan Yue’s, and Chu Zhouyun’s bodies. He had received the most shocking news ever since arriving in the Divine Tuo Holy World several hundred years ago.

As his shock receded, a bitter smile tugged at the corners of Cangqiong Old Man’s face. This disciple of mine, really! It looks like his manner of doing things from the Cangqiong Holy World have not changed at all.

Cangqiong Old Man stood up with deep furrows between his brows. He could imagine how furious the three sacred lands would be after receiving news of Tang Jin, Yuan Yue, and Chu Zhouyun’s accident.

He had been in the Divine Tuo Holy World for several hundred years now, and he understood how preciouslyTang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land treated Tang Jin and Yuan Yue, respectively.

“You ah, you…” Cangqiong Old Man shook his head at Huang Xiaolong and continued, “...are too impulsive.”

Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, and the others exchanged knowing smiles.

“Brother Cangqiong, you don’t need to worry about the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land with our Young Lord around,” Mo Zhi reassured.

Cangqiong Old Man was stunned, but he still shook his head, “Mansion Master Mo Zhi, you guys have just arrived here, and you don’t understand the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s situation. Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land are not the Otherworldly Mansion. Tang Dragon Sacred Land has twenty-eight Primal Ancestor experts, and their Master is a peak late-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor existence.”

“Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s strength is at par with Tang Dragon Sacred Land.”

Long Jianfei laughed, “Brother Cangqiong, we already know these things.”

“You already knew?” Cangqiong Old Man raised an eyebrow. “You guys still…?”

“Brother Cangqiong, what is the Young Lord’s combat power in your opinion?” Mo Zhi asked in return.

Although Cangqiong Old Man wondered why Mo Zhi would ask such a question, he still made an estimation of Huang Xiaolong’s current combat power, and answered seriously, “Although Xiaolong has three evolvable saint godheads and the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, his combat power might rival an early Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm at the most.”

He had made the highest estimation of Huang Xiaolong’s combat power. An early Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm with combat power rivaling an early Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert was shocking enough in Cangqiong Old Man’s opinion. Even the so-called Saint Devil Prince did not have this degree of strength, but then again, he had a certain understanding of how much of a freak his disciple was.

Others smiled when they heard Cangqiong Old Man’s estimation of Huang Xiaolong’s combat power..

Cangqiong Old Man showed surprise. Could it be?

“Brother Cangqiong, I’ll tell you frankly that my combat power is weaker than the Young Lord’s,” Mo Zhi said to Cangqiong Old Man.

“What?!” Cangqiong Old Man was flabbergasted. Obviously, he didn’t believe Mo Zhi’s words.

In truth, Mo Zhi had omitted telling Cangqiong Old Man that he wasn’t a match against Huang Xiaolong even before Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm. Not just that, but Huang Xiaolong was even capable of pulverizing Elder Ming’s body back then.

“Lord Cangqiong can believe us that the Young Lord’s combat power definitely exceeds your imagination. Even I am not the Young Lord’s opponent,” Duan Feng chimed in at this time.

Cangqiong Old Man’s eyes widened. Doesn’t that mean that I am also no match against my disciple even though I am his master?

He found it hard to believe that the mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm Duan Feng could not defeat Huang Xiaolong, but then again, he was familiar with Mo Zhi, and Mo Zhi wasn’t someone who would joke about this.

For a moment, there was a strange expression on Cangqiong Old Man’s face.

Right at this time, the news of Tang Jin, Yuan Yue, and Chu Zhouyun’s incident spread across the surrounding sacred lands, stirring a wave of shock. The Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s, Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s, and Chufan Sacred Land’s experts gathered.
