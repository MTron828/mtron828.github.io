Chapter 2979: The Misty Rain Creed Keeps Itself Safe Above All Else

Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and the others had not expected to run into Huang Xiaolong here, and every one of them was delighted. The reason all of them had gathered at the Blue Lotus Pond for so many years was just to kill Huang Xiaolong and snatch the Tree of Beginning and Huang Long Armor.

Poison Bodach was the only one staring fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, and he asked, “Have you been here this whole time? Where’s Ming Fu?”

His question sobered the others.

The Nine-headed Tree Demon laughed, “Brother Poison Bodach, how, how could that be?! How could it be him?!”

He subconsciously felt that it was impossible because the absolute frost power earlier had completely suppressed Ming Fu. How could that person possibly be Huang Xiaolong who had overpowered Ming Fu?!

Huang Xiaolong looked at Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and more than two hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm experts with them and admitted, “Yes.”

The Nine-headed Tree Demon choked.

…Yes? Meaning?!

“Where’s Ming Fu?” Poison Bodach’s expression darkened, and his narrowed eyes concealed the waves of shock he felt. At the same time, the experts behind him spread out and encircled Huang Xiaolong.

“You will know very soon.” Huang Xiaolong took out the Shaking Dragon Spear. He still hadn’t used this spear since he had gotten it from the Mystical Pavilion’s Dragon Fish Branch. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Dragon qi surged around Huang Xiaolong, and roars of dragons could be heard in the sky as Huang Long Armor emerged to the surface.

……

Outside the Blue Lotus Pond.

“Wasn’t someone battling with Ming Fu just now?” The Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingye doubted, “Why there’s no movement anymore?” The soaring luminance Buddhist energy and absolute frost power that had collided was imprinted into their minds.

But the two world-shaking powers had disappeared as fast as they had appeared.

Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, and the others too showed astonishment.

“It wouldn’t be His Highness, right?” The Black Desert Creed Patriarch hesitated.

The rest were stunned.

“No, it can’t be,” Wu Kun refuted it in one word. He shook his head and added, “That person’s strength is above Ming Fu. We all know His Highness’ strength, and even if he has been cultivating in seclusion inside the Blue Lotus Pond, he can’t possibly have that level of combat power.”

Just as Wu Kun finished speaking, heaven and earth swayed, accompanied by consecutive thunderous explosions coming from the depths of Blue Lotus Pond. World destroying aftershock waves swept out to the four corners,

Faces changed greatly at this sight.

“This is?!” The Silver Shadow Creed Patriarch Zeng Lin exclaimed.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong battling Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and other experts. Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon have found Huang Xiaolong, and they are besieging him right now!” Someone suddenly shrieked, “There are over two hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables. Even if Huang Xiaolong has the Huang Long Armor, he won’t be able to escape from this!”

“What?!” The numerous experts outside the Blue Lotus Pond erupted in a furor.

The Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng, Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun, Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingyu, and the others tensed up immediately.

“His Highness is in danger. Let’s hurry into the Blue Lotus Pond!” Bi Cheng roared, and he was the first to rush into the Blue Lotus Pond.

“Hurry, enter the Blue Lotus Pond and rescue His Highness!” Wu Kun also shouted and then rushed through the barrier right after Bi Cheng.

Hu Qingyu and other creeds’ experts also swarmed in without hesitation.

“All experts of Silver Shadow Creed listen up, enter the Blue Lotus Pond and rescue His Highness Huang Xiaolong!” The Silver Shadow Creed Patriarch Zeng Lin bellowed an order, and led the Silver Shadow Creed’s experts into the Blue Lotus Pond.

The Traversing Wind Creed Patriarch issued the same order and led the Traversing Wind Creed’s experts, rushing into the Blue Lotus Pond to aid Huang Xiaolong.

Some of the remaining creeds exchanged a glance, and then decisively led their experts into the Blue Lotus Pond.

In a few short moments, several thousand Dao Venerables had swarmed into the Blue Lotus Pond.

Yu Yue hesitated and then cautiously looked at her master, the Misty Rain Creed Patriarch, and asked, “Master, aren’t we going inside to help His Highness Huang Xiaolong?”

The Misty Rain Creed Patriarch’s eyes flickered, but he finally shook his head, “The Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and World Tree have gathered more than two hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts to besiege Huang Xiaolong. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong’s death is written in stone! Even if he survives this, he would definitely be imprisoned by those three top forces, and even if Dragon Fish Creed, Divination Creed, and the rest arrive, it’s destined they won’t be able to rescue Huang Xiaolong. The Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and World Tree have more than two hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables ah, and that is power to overwhelm everything. How can the ten creeds go against that?”

“To three forces’ alliance, the Silver Shadow Creed, Traversing Wind Creed, and similar forces could be totally annihilated with one palm. Hence, our Misty Rain Creed should not get involved in this matter!”

“It is a wise move for our Misty Rain Creed to prioritize our safety!” Yu Yue gritted her teeth and went on, “But Huang Xiaolong is the Son of Creation, and I don’t think he’s going to fall!”

The Misty Rain Creed Patriarch laughed softly, “Who says the Son of Creation can’t fall? The universe has its own rules. Even if the world was created by the God of Creation, certain matters are not within the God of Creation’s control. In the vast universe, even the God of Creation is not completely indestructible, then what’s more to Huang Xiaolong, who is only a Dao Venerable?!”

Yu Yue was astounded, “Master, you mean to say?”

“There are things you don’t need to know yet, as you will naturally know these things when you enter late-Ninth Esteem or peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm,” the Misty Rain Creed Patriarch replied.

In the meantime, inside the Blue Lotus Pond, Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, the Nine-headed Tree Demon, Stonemen Race Patriarch Shi Dan, Inferno Race Patriarch Yan Tianyang, and many more experts looked at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous expressions on their faces.

The Poison Valley, Supreme Sword Palace, and World Tree alliance had more than two hundred and sixty plus Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts. Just moments ago, Huang Xiaolong had sealed almost two hundred of them in ice in a few breaths!

“Perfection absolute frost power!”

Poison Bodach fixed a deathly stare on Huang Xiaolong, his face was extremely gloomy. Huang Xiaolong’s absolute frost power has actually reached perfection level!

On top of that, Huang Xiaolong has also broken through to an early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

Perfection absolute frost power, early Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, three small worlds’ cosmos energy, three dao souls, twelve high-order Saint Fates, the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, and on top of everything, Huang Xiaolong also had the Huang Long Armor!

Didn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong currently had…?!

Even though enjoyable, Huang Xiaolong ignored Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the others’ ugly faces, and he strode towards them with the Shaking Dragon Spear in his hand.. With each step he took, the pond’s surface under his foot turned an icy blue, and it only recovered after Huang Xiaolong had walked away. Perfection absolute frost power enabled Huang Xiaolong delicate control over any water element in the world as he liked.

“Black Shadow Devil, Old Monster Flame, Wind Wolf, if you don’t come out now, we will retreat. If we can’t get the Tree of Beginning, you all won’t get it too!” Poison Bodach suddenly shouted to the sky.

He knew the Black Shadow Devil, Old Monster Flame, and other old monsters had long arrived, and they were merely hidden nearby, planning to become the fisherman that reaps the final reward.

But he wouldn’t fulfill these people’s wishes!

As expected, the moment Poison Bodach threatened to leave, the sky darkened for a split second as the Black Shadow Devil and Old Monster Flame appeared. The Black Shadow Devil was merely a shadow, whereas Old Monster Flame was standing on a fiery red cloud, and there were rings of flames on his hands.

After the Black Shadow Devil and Old Monster Flame appeared, another dozen people also appeared. Each of them was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert, and although some of their might wasn’t as strong as Poison Bodach, the difference was almost negligible.
