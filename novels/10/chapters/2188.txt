Chapter 2189: The Giant Kun Heavenly Country Is Finished!

Since they weren’t too far apart, Huang Xiaolong’s claw arrived in the Giant Kun Ruler’s face before he could react. Circulating all the energy in his body to the limit, the Giant Kun Ruler formed another layer of scales around his body!

Despite the increased defense it provided, Huang Xiaolong shattered it in an instant. His claw pierced into the ruler’s chest.

With nothing to stop him, Huang Xiaolong’s claw emerged from the back of the ruler’s body.

As a spurt of blood emerged from his wound, it dyed the mountain range red.

Time seemed to come to a standstill as everyone stared at the scene before them with their jaws agape. Huang Xiaolong’s claw went straight through the Giant Kun Ruler’s body!

Roar!

Like an injured beast, the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s ruler raised his head and roared at the heavens. Killing intent surged out of his eyes as he sent another punch towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re going to turn into a blind dragon!”

He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were strong enough to defend against his desperate counterattack!

Regardless of how strong one was, the eyes were one of the weakest points of the body!

Watching the desperate struggle of the ruler in front of his eyes, Huang Xiaolong raised his head and opened his mouth before the punch could land on his eyes. A heaven-shaking roar left his lips, and it turned into a shockingly powerful soundwave that crashed into the ruler’s attack.

Boom!

The dragon roar not only managed to stop the ruler’s attack, it even managed to send him flying! As he drew a beautiful arc through the sky, he vomited mouthfuls of fresh blood.

There was a gaping hole in his chest as blood streamed out from within. Everyone experienced no small amount of shock when they stared at the bloody wound.

With no exceptions, everyone present sucked in a cold breath.

Was this the undefeated legend they knew?! How could the publicly acknowledged number one expert of the Heavens Path be dripping in blood?

“Your Majesty!” The experts of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country couldn’t help but scream when they saw the serious injury Huang Xiaolong inflicted on their ruler.

The Giant Kun Ruler was the pillar of their faction! If anything happened to him, the entire Heavenly Country would crumble!

“I’m fine!” The Giant Kun Ruler growled, “Kill Huang Xiaolong right now! Use the forbidden art to slay this monster!”

The forbidden art!

Even if he had to destroy the foundations of the experts of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, the ruler no longer cared. The only thing that mattered was to kill Huang Xiaolong!

If Huang Xiaolong left this place alive, there would be nowhere left in the Heavens Path for his Giant Kun Heavenly Country!

“Yes!” All of the experts from the Giant Kun Heavenly Country acknowledged as traces of blood-red light emerged from their bodies. Their strength started to rise as the blood-red glow intensified.

Of course, the experts of the Heavenly Terror Country wouldn’t remain idle now that Huang Xiaolong had killed their ruler. They charged towards him as they unleashed their valiant counterattack.

A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he waved his claws at the annoying pests from the Heavenly Terror Country. In an instant, two of their generals exploded into a mist of blood. He didn’t stop there. With a shake of his body, Huang Xiaolong appeared beside Hao Wei, the grand elder of the 33 Heavens Race as he swiped his claw downwards.

Hao Wei could only stare at Huang Xiaolong in terror as he felt himself creeping closer and closer to the gates of hell. This was the first time he had felt such fear and despair.

Seeing as the grand elder of the race was about to meet his end, Yang Tianchen couldn’t care about his injuries any longer. The Dark Lightning Blade in his hand pierced towards Huang Xiaolong as he screamed at the top of his lungs, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you!”

“Kill him!”

Yang Tianchen’s cries caused the experts of the 33 Heavens Race to snap back to reality as they started their desperate counterattack.

Ignoring everyone, Huang Xiaolong’s claw continued to descend.

“Rip!”

Like the sound of a watermelon popping, Huang Xiaolong’s claw went straight through Hao Wei’s skull. Without the slightest resistance, Huang Xiaolong sliced him into two.

The only thing Hao Wei could do was to release a blood-curdling screech.

At the same time, the various attacks from the experts of the 33 Heavens Race landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

A brilliant glow surrounded Huang Xiaolong as tiny white scratches appeared on his scales when their attacks landed on him. In the blink of an eye, whatever damage they had done disappeared and Huang Xiaolong’s scales regained their previous grandeur.

When they saw how they failed to break through Huang Xiaolong’s defense, a look of defeat appeared on their faces.

Yang Tianchen and the other experts of the 33 Heavens Race felt their world spinning.

No one could believe that the Giant Kun Ruler failed to penetrate Huang Xiaolong’s defense. However, they finally had a taste of Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying defense.

How could someone possess such a horrifyingly strong defense?!

Wasn’t he stronger than a high-grade supreme spiritual treasure?!

The Primordial Divine Dragon Race was scary, but were they actually strong enough to withstand the attacks of so many experts with their fleshy body?!

“Die!”

Everyone desperately rushed at Huang Xiaolong once again.

The battle between Huang Xiaolong and the others reached the peak in an instant. The heavens shook and the earth crumbled as mountain peaks after mountain peaks turned to dust. Ancient forests were razed to the ground and even the space around them shattered like glass. Massive holes were punched in the void by formidable secret techniques.

As the battle raged on, the experts of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country fell one by one. Corpses of the experts of the 33 Heavens Race filled the land. As for the members of the Heavenly Terror Country, they were turned into mist of blood after Huang Xiaolong crushed them with his claws. The four divine flames danced around the battlefield and incinerated countless experts.

More than an hour passed and the strong force of slightly over one hundred and ten men belonging to the three superpowers was left with thirty men only!

The Heavenly Terror Country was doing the worst as they only had four experts left standing!

When they realized that their strength was reduced by more than half, they finally understood how terrifying Huang Xiaolong was. Fear and desperation filled their hearts.

The experts, who were surrounding Huang Xiaolong, felt cold sweat drenching their backs.

“This... Is he still a human?!” One of the elders from the Sword Race stared at the Primordial Blue Divine Dragon floating in the air as a look of terror flashed in his eyes.

Regardless of whether it was the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, 33 Heavens Race, or the Heavenly Terror Country, they were all superpowers no one there could hope to match! They were hegemons of the Heavens Path but right now, even with more than a hundred and ten experts from three factions working together, they failed to suppress Huang Xiaolong! The Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen were both forced back and Dong Cheng was dead! Looking at the dire situation before them, they were afraid that Huang Xiaolong would really be able to kill everyone!

“... We’re finished...” The Massacring God Ruler stared at Huang Xiaolong as his eyes lost focus. He started muttering ominously to himself.

What did he mean? Everyone immediately realized the meaning behind his words. The Giant Kun Heavenly Country and the Heavenly Terror Country were doomed!

Even if they could still hold on for a period of time, they would be close to extinction the moment Huang Xiaolong returned to the Heavens Path!

Nearly all the experts of both heavenly countries were sent out to provide assistance to their rulers, and nearly all of them were wiped out by Huang Xiaolong!

Ignoring the look of fear on their faces, Huang Xiaolong swiped his claw across the face of one of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s generals. His head and godhead turned into a bloody mess when Huang Xiaolong was done.

When Jian Xiaofu who was standing beside Jian Qintian heard the miserable shriek that came from the general, she felt the blood draining from her face. She thanked her lucky stars that Huang Xiaolong had only sent her flying the last time he had made a move. She didn’t dare to imagine what would happen to her if she angered Huang Xiaolong!

“Your Majesty, the Giant Kun Heavenly Country is doomed! Should we leave?” The marshal of the Sword Race approached Jian Qintian and suggested.
