Chapter 3390: Your End Will Be Worse Than Sun Wukong

The Golden Brow Arhat jumped in fright when he saw Huang Xiaolong.

“Who are you?!” Retreating slightly, the Golden Brow Arhat moved towards the center of the platform. When he had constructed it in the past, he had laid down countless restrictions. The center of the platform was filled with the strongest ones. If he were to face an opponent slightly stronger than him, he was confident of winning!

Huang Xiaolong saw through his intentions the moment he retreated. He casually spoke, “I’m Huang Xiaolong.”

The Golden Brow Arhat’s body trembled in response. “What?! You… You’re Huang Xiaolong?!” With anger rising in his heart, he roared, “You’re the one who killed Junior Brother Yang Kai!”

The crowd went into an uproar in an instant.

“He’s the one who killed Immortal Emperor Yang Kai!”

“How dare he come to our Western Niuhe Continent?!”

As they screamed in anger, many of them spat out abuses at Huang Xiaolong. Without a doubt, all of them felt as though Huang Xiaolong was too arrogant! He dared to show himself in the Myriad Buddha World even after killing the Maitreya Buddha’s favorite disciple. He was clearly picking a fight with them!

As for Huang Xiaochun, he nearly fainted when he heard what they said.

He wasn’t kidding when he said that he killed Yang Kai!

“Lord Golden Brow, kill him! Kill Huang Xiaolong!”

“We cannot allow him to escape!”

Many experts standing under the platform roared with rage.

When everyone was yelling, the Golden Brow Arhat made his move. Clapping his hands together, he circulated all his energy. With the power boost he was receiving from the platform, the golden light that emerged from his body managed to surround several other immortal kingdoms.

Powerful Buddhist light poured out from the entrance of the Myriad Buddha World as they lit up the platform.

Since the platform was right outside the entrance of the Myriad Buddha World, it was able to call upon the strength of the formations surrounding the Myriad Buddha World!

That was also the reason why the Golden Brow Arhat was confident of winning against experts at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Immortal Emperor Realm even though he was only at the early-Ninth Level Immortal Emperor Realm.

The brilliant rays of golden light shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

It seemed to contain the power of a peak late-Ninth Level Immortal Emperor Realm expert, and Huang Xiaolong looked like he would be crushed by the strike.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t move a muscle as he took the attack head-on.

Bang!

As it slammed into Huang Xiaolong, everyone cheered.

The Golden Brow Arhat frowned when he realized that Huang Xiaolong didn’t use anything to defend himself from the deadly attack. However, he soon sneered in his heart. No matter how strong the other party was, they would be seriously injured after that!

When the golden light finally faded, the Golden Brow Arhat widened his eyes in shock.

Huang Xiaolong stood in his usual spot, completely unaffected by the blast!

The cheers coming from the various experts under the platform stopped in an instant.

Taking several steps forward, Huang Xiaolong walked towards the Golden Brow Arhat.

“No… This… This is impossible!”

Even an expert at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Immortal Emperor Realm couldn’t escape unscathed from the strike!

Just recently, he fought with a devil at the peak late-Ninth Level Immortal Emperor Realm and forced the other party back with the help of the restrictions around the platform!

“You…” A terrifying thought flashed through his mind and his expression changed. “You’re a holy being!”

Holy being!

The faces of everyone changed.

Those who ascended past the Immortal Emperor Realm would be known as Sages! They were holy beings who attained enlightenment!

According to the legends, Sages could transcend the reincarnation cycle! No one could kill them!

If an Immortal Emperor was akin to a god in the Immortal World, a holy being would be a peerless monster who could cause the Immortal World to tremble with a stomp of their feet!

From the start of time, there had been a single phrase that was passed down. Anyone under the Sage Realm was an ant!

Attaining enlightenment was something that countless warriors dreamed of. However, the number of people who managed to do so was too few! Even in the ancient war, there were too few Sages!

After the ancient war, Sages no longer appeared in the world. As such, the Golden Brow Arhat didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong was an expert in the Sage Realm!

“Sage?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the Golden Brow Arhat’s surprised expression and chuckled. He raised his hand to send the man flying towards the entrance of the Myriad Buddha World.

With another step, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the entrance.

“Lord Arhat!”

The disciples who were guarding the entrance yelled in shock as they looked at the Golden Brow Arhat.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand to freeze the space around the countless number of disciples rushing towards him.

“Body Freezing Art!” The Golden Brow Arhat screamed in surprise.

It wasn’t anything special if Huang Xiaolong had locked one or two people in place, but he managed to seal off tens of thousands of disciples!

Huang Xiaolong walked towards the Golden Brow Arhat once again and asked, “I heard that the Myriad Treasures Dao Master is currently in your Myriad Buddha World.”

“Myriad Treasures Dao Master?!”

Is Huang Xiaolong here to look for the Myriad Treasures Dao Master?

He couldn’t comprehend what was happening.

After Huang Xiaolong killed Yang Kai, did he trespass into the Western Niuhe Continent to look for the Myriad Treasures Dao Master?

“That’s right,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Huang Xiaolong, even if you reached the Sage Realm, you will definitely die a miserable death now that you have offended our Western Buddhist factions!” The Golden Brow Arhat’s expression sank, and he threatened.

“No, no, no. You’re getting something wrong here. The Western Buddhist factions better not piss me off. Otherwise, I’ll crush all of you with a wave of my arm,” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

Bursting out into angry laughter, the Golden Brow Arhat snorted, “Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are? You’re just a Sage! My master won’t even have to appear to deal with you! Any random Buddhist Ancestor will be able to send you to the depths of hell. Do you know the Monkey King? Even he couldn’t stand up to one of us!”

“He has been sealed under the Five Finger Mountain all these years, and no one knows if he’s still alive!”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Your end will be worse than Sun Wukong!”

“Not even his master dares to plead with our Buddha Ancestor… Do you really think you can win?!”

Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Do I look like Sun Wukong to you?” He dragged the Golden Brow Arhat over before searching his soul.

It didn’t take long for him to learn everything.

From what he learned, the Myriad Treasures Dao Master left the Myriad Buddha World several years ago. Even the Maitreya Buddha wasn’t present. The two of them left with each other, and not even the Golden Brow Arhat knew where they went.

“What did you do to me?!” Snapping back to reality, the Golden Brow Arhat roared with rage.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with him as he sealed the Buddhist energy in his body before throwing him into the Sun Moon Furnace. He suppressed the Golden Brow Arhat with all the Dao Ancestors there.
