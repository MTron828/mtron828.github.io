Chapter 2046: Rushing Back to the Radiance World

No matter who it was, they would fail to find a response if such a huge bomb dropped on their head.

The person who had killed the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and the person who had orchestrated everything was none other than Lord Wan Shi of the City of All-Heavens!

Even if the rumors were false and the Ancient Heavenly Emperor hadn’t save Lord Wan Shi’s life, the little cow and the King of Darkness knew for a fact that the relationship between the two was pretty good!

Now that Huang Xiaolong revealed the truth, they felt as though the world was flipping upside down. Lord Wan Shi made a move and nearly killed the Ancient Heavenly Emperor in a single strike!

“This!!!” The little cow exhaled a long breath and failed to think of anything to say. After a short while, she finally spoke up, “Honestly, this is a little hard to believe. Who would have thought that Lord Wan Shi would make a move to kill the Ancient Heavenly Emperor?”

The King of Darkness sighed, “If Lord Wan Shi really made a move, what’s the reason behind it? Why did he want to kill the Ancient Heavenly Emperor? Could it be that he had his eyes on the Ancient Heavenly Court and the treasures the old man stashed?”

The little cow shook her head. “Things might not be as simple as that. Even though the treasury in the Ancient Heavenly Court is shocking, there is no way Lord Wan Shi would have betrayed the friendship he had with the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and personally made a move to kill him.”

“If the Ancient Heavenly Court and the treasury hidden inside it was not enough, what if you throw in Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus?” Huang Xiaolong dropped another bomb capable of exterminating the little cow’s world view.

“WHAT?! Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus?” The little cow and the King of Darkness yelled in unison.

The Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus was a level four origin treasure! It was a mid-rank origin treasure!

“Are you saying that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had managed to get his hands on a Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus? Is that why Lord Wan Shi wanted to move against him? Was Lord Wan Shi there to obtain his Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus?” The little cow felt a little dizzy as her chest heaved up and down.

The secret they just learned could shake the worlds.

No one had expected that the truth behind the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s disappearance was related to Lord Wan Shi and the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “That’s right. In the past, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor obtained a Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus while exploring a secret region. Di Jun found out, and he went on to ally with Shi Ming and the City of All-Heavens in order to kill the Ancient Heavenly Emperor!”

The little cow and the King of Darkness felt their hearts speeding up.

They had long since lost their calm.

“It’s actually the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus!” The King of Darkness sighed, “What happened next? Did Lord Wan Shi manage to obtain the lotus after killing the Ancient Heavenly Emperor?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I have no idea. The memories about that are extremely fragmented. In my opinion, he didn’t manage to obtain the lotus. In the past, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor hid the Thirty-Six Petaled Lotus in a concealed location. From what I know, that old b*stard Wan Shi wanted to conduct a soul search on the Ancient Heavenly Emperor before killing him. The Ancient Heavenly Emperor only managed to escape from their pursuit after hiding deep in the Devil Abyss.”

The little cow stared at the King of Darkness in shock.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the expression on their faces, he continued, “There is no need to think too much about it. Even had not yet opened the treasury, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor hadn’t hidden the lotus in there.”

The two Sovereigns stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

The little cow spoke up all of a sudden, “Xiaolong, do you know where the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus is hidden? If you manage to find it, you might break through to the Sovereign Realm immediately!”

“The Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus is leagues above the Lotus of Darkness you refined in the past.” The King of Darkness agreed. “Even though it’s only a rank higher than the Lotus of Darkness, the difference in their effects is extremely apparent. It’s like comparing a firefly to the moon. It was the mid-ranked origin treasure, the Myriad Worlds Bamboo, that allowed Lord Wan Shi to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm.”

Myriad Worlds Bamboo!

Huang Xiaolong finally knew about the origin treasure that had allowed Wan Shi to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm!

“The Myriad Worlds Bamboo is also a level four origin treasure. Even though the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus is also a level four origin treasure, it’s a mid-level four origin treasure. The Myriad Worlds Bamboo is a high-grade level four origin treasure, and the effects of it cannot be compared to the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly. “It’s too bad I can’t determine where the Ancient Heavenly Emperor hid the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus...”

“There is no need to worry. Now that you have the Ancient Heavenly Court, we can take time to dig it out. There are still hopes of obtaining the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus!” The King of Darkness reassured Huang Xiaolong.

As the three of them spoke about everything that had happened to the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, they quickly arrived at the world surface where Wu Shaowu, and the others were waiting at. Huang Xiaolong sucked them all into the Complete Heaven Palace without the slightest hesitation.

When Wu Shaowu and the others saw such a terrifying treasure, they couldn’t believe their eyes. Even as the second strongest expert in the Kingdom of Devil Beasts, Wu Shaowu felt his jaws dropping to the ground.

After keeping his forces’ entirety, Huang Xiaolong flew towards the hiding spot of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race.

In several hours, they arrived at the space above the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong and the rest had taken several days to arrive at the Devil Pool’s core region after leaving the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race. That was even when they flew at the fastest speed the little cow could.

Right now, they took mere hours to return.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong had to admit that it was only possible with the two Sovereigns pouring their energy into the formation. Still, whatever the case, the speed was too shocking.

One had to know that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had managed to escape to the Devil Abyss’ core region even after being heavily injured. The only reason he could do that was because of the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“Ancient... Ancient Heavenly Court!” When Du Hai saw that Huang Xiaolong and the others had returned with the Ancient Heavenly Court, he jumped in fright. His reaction wasn’t worse than Wu Shaowu and the others.

The experts from the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race weren’t doing much better as they stared at the Ancient Heavenly Court with their jaws agape.

“You went to the core regions of the Devil Abyss for this?!” Du Hai glanced at the three of them, and he instantly connected the dots.

The Ancient Heavenly Court has always been hidden in the core region of the Devil Abyss!?

That was the Ancient Heavenly Court they were talking about!

Du Hai suddenly felt a wave of regret washing over him. He had holed himself up in the middle regions of the Devil Abyss without so much as stepping outside. He felt that if he had gone around to adventure, he might have obtained the Ancient Heavenly Court long before Huang Xiaolong came looking for it.

“Old man, there is no need for you to regret not searching for the Ancient Heavenly Court. Even if you would have known it’s rough location, you couldn’t have found it.” The little cow saw through his thoughts in an instant. “Di Jun, Shi Ming, and the people from the City of All-Heavens had long known that the Ancient Heavenly Court was located in the core region of the Devil Abyss. After so many years, they had still drawn blanks.”

It was true.

Only those who were fated could obtain a treasure like the Ancient Heavenly Court. It was like the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus. Even when Di Jun had joined hands with Shi Ming and Wan Shi, they had failed to obtain it.

“Enough. We need to head back to the Radiance World right now.” Huang Xiaolong interrupted their conversation. “We can talk on our way.”

Right now, Huang Xiaolong wanted nothing more than to return to the Radiance World. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He quickly received the members of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race and steered the Ancient Heavenly Court towards the Radiance World.
