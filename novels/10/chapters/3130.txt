Chapter 3131: Whereabouts of the Son of Mystic

“Regardless, if he dares to offend me, I’ll cripple him!” Hao Zhen snorted.

Lei Qianqian glanced at Hao Zhen and she sighed, “If he really is the Son of Destiny, it won’t be easy for you to cripple him.” After she spoke, she turned to one of the members of the Lightning Phoenix Race and she ordered, “Look into his background. Now!”

A sinister light flashed through Hao Zhen’s eyes. “Even if the Son of Destiny managed to comprehend the power of space and time, I’m more than capable of sending him to hell!”

Lei Qianqian frowned. A trace of disgust flashed through her eyes, but it returned to normal a second later. Hao Zhen might be strong, but he was too arrogant. Moreover, he was extremely impulsive when he did things. That was also the reason she rejected his advances over and over.

Whatever the case, she remained silent. With the members of the Lightning Phoenix Race around her, she made her way towards the Mystical Pavilion’s branch. They were planning to look for the Flower of Time and the Void Reincarnation Thistle in the Origin Sea, and they needed several treasures to aid them in their search. They would require formation runes, Heavenly Silk, and the Mysterious Eye of Ice.

With the treasures, their search would be much easier than before.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive. As soon as the branch master, Yan Fei, learned that Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen had arrived, he appeared personally to greet them.

Yan Fei’s authority in the Mystical Pavilion was extremely high, and his strength allowed him to rank in the top fifteen ranks of the Extermination List. Even if the patriarchs of several great races arrived, Yan Fei wouldn’t appear to greet them. Things were different when Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen were the ones and one could easily see how important they were in the Origin Lands.

Lei Qianqian’s reputation that was only beneath the ten overlords could be seen clearly from this.

When Yan Fei learned that they wanted to purchase formation runes, Heavenly Silk, and the Mysterious Eye of Ice, he got the various eminent elders to prepare those of the highest grade.

One hour later, Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen left after getting all their items. As soon as they left, an eminent elder entered the inner hall to report to Yan Fei, “Branch Pavilion Master, there’s a young man outside with the surname, ‘Huang’, here to see you.”

“?!” Yan Fei was stunned as he thought about all the powerful clans and races in the Origin Lands. No one had the same surname as the man trying to meet him.

“I’m not meeting him.” Yan Fei snapped. Soon after, he added another sentence. “There’s no need to report anyone requesting an audience with me. Reject them all.”

The eminent elder paused for a second and continued, “That’s the young man who killed the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race…”

Yan Fei stared at the doyen in shock. “Is he the master of the black robed subordinate?!”

“Yes.” The eminent elder nodded slowly.

“Alright. Bring him to the inner hall. I’ll meet him in an hour.” Yan Fei paused for a second and ordered.

Acknowledging the order, the eminent elder quickly took his leave. However, he hadn’t left the inner hall when a voice rang through the air.

“There’s no need to wait for an hour.”

“Who?!” Yan Fei exclaimed in shock.

When they turned to look at the entrance, the space started to twist and several figures emerged from the void.

With his expression turning serious, Yan Fei knew that things were going south. The Mystical Pavilion’s branch was filled with restrictions, but it seemed as though the group who appeared could pass through them easily.

“Pavilion Branch Master, he’s the one who wants to meet you!” The eminent elder retreated behind Yan Fei and exclaimed.

A cold glare landed on Huang Xiaolong as Yan Fei felt his heart skipping a beat. “So you’re the ones who kill the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race… You’re pretty courageous, but who gave you the confidence to barge into my branch?!”

Huang Xiaolong walked towards Yan Fei and he laughed. “I know that the Son of Mystic came to the Origin Lands. Did he contact you after getting here?”

Yan Fei and the eminent elder stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. They didn’t expect him to open the conversation with the topic of their young patriarch!

“Who the hell are you?!” Yan Fei’s expression sank as he started to circulate his energy.

Stretching out his palm, Huang Xiaolong grabbed at Yan Fei.

Watching the youngster before him making a move, a snort left Yan Fei’s lips. “Humph, you’re overestimating yourself! Go to hell!” The cosmos energy in his body gushed out and he returned Huang Xiaolong’s attack with a palm of his own. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the next instant, Yan Fei crashed through countless buildings located inside the branch of the Mystical Pavilion.

The eminent elder wanted to assist Yan Fei, but he stood there in stunned silence like a block of wood when he saw what happened to Yan Fei.

Spitting out mouthfuls of blood, Yan Fei snapped at Huang Xiaolong, “Who the f*ck are you?!” He didn’t know when such a powerful individual appeared in the Origin Lands.

Moreover, he could feel that the youngster before him possessed the power of three elements at perfection level!

“You might have heard of me. I’m Huang Xiaolong.” Taking a step forward, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Yan Fei.

“It’s you!”

The Son of Creation, Huang Xiaolong!

As a branch master of the Mystical Pavilion, he was more than familiar with the name! After all, Huang Xiaolong invaded the Mystical Pavilion’s branch in the Origin Heavenly Cave, and he plundered their treasury after forcing San Song and Wangu Xu to serve under him!

He even knew that the nine beast kings of the Death Beasts Peril Lands had submitted to the kid! As if that wasn’t enough, the hidden beast king, the Black and White Dao Venerable, was also the man’s underling!

He looked at the nine beast kings before turning to look at the Myriad Formation Devil and Lei Yu. The blood drained from his face.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you want?!”

“Our Main Pavilion Master will be returning to the Origin Holy World soon, and when he does, you won’t be able to escape!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong remained impassive. “There’s no need for you to worry about me.” After he spoke, he reached out to lock Yan Fei in place.

It didn’t take long for him to brand the souls of Yan Fei and the eminent elder who saw him.

“The Son of Mystic contacted Yan Fei!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in pleasant surprise when he read Yan Fei’s memories. From what he learned, the Son of Mystic entered the Origin Lands half a month before he did. He contacted Yan Fei and asked about details regarding the Origin Sea.

Origin Sea!

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. He didn’t expect that the Son of Mystic would also set his sights on the Origin Sea.

Could it be because of the Tree of Origin?! Perhaps, there was another type of treasure waiting to be found!

It was too bad Yan Fei didn’t meet with the Son of Mystic and he had no idea what the other party looked like.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong took a trip down to the treasury and he swept everything clean. As long as he could use it to increase his strength, he took all of it away. For example, treasures like the Profound Concentrated Earth, Liquid of Life, and Phoenix Fire Crystals were wiped out from the Mystical Pavilion Branch’s inventory.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect that he would be able to obtain quite a lot of Black Stone in the treasury.

That was a treasure that could assist him in understanding the power of darkness!

After he was done, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother shopping around in the city. He returned to the Heaven Piercer and continued to cultivate.

Three days later, the Heaven Piercer turned into a streak of light and soared through the skies.

Their next stop was the Black Frost Abyss, and they would need two months to arrive. After staying in the Black Frost Abyss for three more days, the Heaven Piercer would rush towards the Boundless City.

In the blink of an eye, two months passed.

During the journey, Huang Xiaolong’s strength improved at a terrifying pace. By the time they arrived at the Black Frost Abyss, Huang Xiaolong’s body was covered in a faint golden light. He comprehended the power of metal, and with that, the only elements he hadn’t comprehended was the power of space and time!
