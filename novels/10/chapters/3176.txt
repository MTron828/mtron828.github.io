Chapter 3177: Three Great Celestial Empires

Huang Xiaolong continued to have Li Shuo and Black Shadow Devil gather information from outside.

The holy world they were currently in was called the Heavenly Sword Holy World.

There were numerous creeds within the Heavenly Sword Holy World, and the Guangzong Heavenly Cave was one of the famous heavenly caves. Huang Xiaolong was currently located in this Heavenly Cave. The Guangzong Heavenly Cave’s overall strength ranked high amongst other heavenly caves within the Heavenly Sword Holy World. Moreover, the Guangzong Region Lord was a famous general under the Heavenly Sword World Master.

Through the Son of Mystic Huang Feng, and Huang Shuai’s memories, Huang Xiaolong knew a little about the Heavenly Sword Holy World.

The Heavenly Sword World Master was quite famous for his strength.

The Origin Holy World was the strongest holy world within Huang Long World, and the Origin Holy World’s World Master, Xiao Tianyi, was ranked third on the Extermination List, and he had comprehended the power of absolute earth, wind, water, and blaze to perfection level. However, the Heavenly Sword World Master had comprehended five absolute powers to perfection level!

Five elements at perfection level!

This was rare even in the entire Blazing Dragon World.

Thus, the Heavenly Sword World Master was a top expert even in the entire Blazing Dragon World.

Then again, compared to the leader of the ten beast kings, Di Shuang, who also had comprehended five elements to perfection level, the Heavenly Sword World Master was slightly weaker.

Di Shuang’s five elements at perfection level included the power of darkness, poison, metal, frost, and wind. Whereas the power of his absolute blaze had reached a major completion stage. On the other hand, the Heavenly Sword World Master’s five elements at perfection level included the power of darkness, lightning, frost, wood, and earth.

The Heavenly Sword World Master would be much lower on the rung when compared to the ten overlords’ leader, Cang Xun. After all, Cang Xun was slightly stronger than Di Shuang.

No doubt, in the Blazing Dragon World where experts were as many as the leaves in a forest, the Heavenly Sword World Master was merely an expert who barely entered the rankings.

The Blazing Dragon World was the oldest world in the universe, and even if a genius in the Blazing Dragon World had the same level of talent as a genius in the Huang Long World, the number of experts who wielded absolute powers in the Blazing Dragon World would be higher than the Huang Long World. It was because they had cultivated for a longer time than experts in the Huang Long World!

In the same sense, the number of experts with perfection level absolute power in Blazing Dragon World exceeded the Huang Long World.

Experts who wielded two, three, four, or even five elements were also more than Huang Long World.

The Blazing Dragon World had three God of Creation Realm experts!

Three Gods of Creation in one world!

This was more than enough to deter the entire universe.

Only when one reached Huang Xiaolong’s realm, who had already touched the boundary of the God of Creation Realm, they understood better how terrifying the strength of a God of Creation was.

However, the Blazing Dragon World’s three Gods of Creation weren't united!

Moreover, as the strength of the Huang Family’s old ancestor, which Huang Rong belonged to, had become stronger, the Blazing Dragon World’s three Gods of Creation had become even warier of each other. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

On the surface, they were the Blazing Dragon World’s three pillars, but underneath, they were surging currents, and it wouldn’t take long before war raged in the Blazing Dragon World.

Although the Blazing Dragon World had three Gods of Creation, the God of Creation who had created the Blazing Dragon World was not the Huang Family’s old ancestor, where Huang Rong was.

Therefore, even though the Huang Family was powerful, it wasn’t to the point that it could cover the sky with one hand.

The Blazing Dragon World’s three Gods of Creation had built the three celestial empires!

These three celestial empires resemble the Pangu World’s Heavenly Court, and the entire Blazing Dragon World was under these three celestial empires’ governance.

The three celestial empires were Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, and True Dragon Celestial Empire!

The Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire was the strongest celestial empire in the Blazing Dragon World, and the Blazing Dragon World was created by the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire’s old ancestor. The Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire was the second celestial empire, and the third celestial empire was the True Dragon Celestial Empire, created by Huang Rong’s old ancestor.

Although the Huang Family’s old ancestor was the last person amongst the three to break through to the God of Creation Realm, his cultivation speed was the fastest amongst the three. Hence, the Huang Family’s old ancestor was recognized as the number one expert of Blazing Dragon World. On top of that, generations of Huang Family’s juniors were outstanding, pushing the Huang Family to the top of the Blazing Dragon World.

Huang Family’s old ancestor was the number one expert of Blazing Dragon World, still, the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire’s old ancestor was the first person, who had stepped into the God of Creation Realm. His strength was unfathomable. Thus the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire was not weaker than the True Dragon Celestial Empire.

Instead, it was the Heaven Extreme Celestial Empire that was the weakest one amongst the three.

The Heavenly Sword Holy World, where Huang Xiaolong was currently residing in, was located within the Blazing Dragon World.

The Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire had numerous holy worlds under it. However, the Heavenly Sword Holy World was not far away from the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire’s celestial capital, and it was merely a distance of thirty to forty holy worlds away.

Thirty to forty holy worlds’ distance seemed a long way, but how vast was the Blazing Dragon World? Therefore, thirty to forty holy worlds’ distance was considered close.

Huang Xiaolong could settle down in peace and cultivate in Lingchen Sacred Land after learning they were in the Blazing Dragon World. Had they been on the Huang Family’s True Dragon Celestial Empire, Huang Xiaolong would have fled with his family early on.

While Huang Xiaolong was comprehending the power of time and space, outside the residence, Huang Xiaohai brushed his hands as he appreciated his handiwork on the several spies. He smiled sheepishly and said, “Scram and go back to tell your masters that if you send any more people here, I won’t be so nice anymore! At that time, I’ll even take care of your masters once and for all!”

These spies from various forces did not dare to talk back, and some had already fled in a sorry state.

In the Gathering Stars City Chu Family’s main hall, the Chu Family Patriarch Chu Xingfeng’s face was extremely sullen looking at the sorry state of the spy he had sent out.

“First Order True Saint?” Chu Xingfeng asked.

“It is so, Patriarch. The Huang Family’s third young master is likely to be a First Order True Saint. Currently, we have yet to find out the Huang Family Patriarch Huang Peng’s strength,” one of the spies hurriedly answered.

“Tell me what happened in detail,” Chu Xingfen ordered.

The several spies complied.

When the several spies finished, Chu Xingfeng’s expression was a little ugly. “He really said he’ll take care of your masters as well?”

“Yes, Patriarch, we do not dare to exaggerate. Everything we’ve reported is the truth,” one of them answered.

Chu Xingfeng harrumphed coldly, and the several spies below seemed to be struck by a blow, and blood sprayed from their mouths, frightening them to their knees.

“Just a First Order True Saint!” Chu Xingfeng’s gaze was frosty. “Does he think that’s capital to swagger in this Lingchen Sacred Land!”

“Patriarch, why don’t we request Eminent Elder Chu Bi to deal with them?” one of them cautiously raised his head and said.

Chu Bi was the Chu Family’s third strongest expert after Chu Xingfeng, a Fifth Order True Saint.

Chu Xingfeng’s eyes glimmered but he waved his hand, “It’s not necessary for now. Continue to investigate this Huang Family, and find out the strength of their patriarch. If his strength is merely at low-level True Saint, it won’t be too late to make a move then.”

“But, Patriarch, that Huang Family Patriarch rarely comes out, and the residence has a very sophisticated formation surrounding it, so we’re unable to find out his strength,” the same spy said.

Chu Xingfeng was nonchalant. “Don’t worry, that Huang Family Patriarch cannot possibly stay inside forever. He would have to come out one day, so make your move then and check out his strength. Report back to me.”

“Yes, Patriarch.”
