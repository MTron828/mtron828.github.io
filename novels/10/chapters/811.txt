The inn owner dared not accept Huang Xiaolong’s top divine grade spirit stone no matter what. Don’t joke, after witnessing his horrifying strength, injuring two mid-First Order Highgod Realm masters in one move, the inn owner was too afraid to accept Huang Xiaolong’s payment.

Watching the inn owner refuse to accept the spirit stone no matter what he said, Huang Xiaolong desisted from trying to convince him any longer.

The inn owner personally arranged the courtyard for Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei, personally led them there, and personally sent their wine and food.

He was more respectful than any slaves or servants.

After ensuring that Huang Xiaolong had no other instructions, the inn owner respectfully withdrew.

When he was out of sight, Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly at Shi Xiaofei, “We can finally have a meal in peace.”

Shi Xiaofei rolled her eyes at Huang Xiaolong, “Is that not your fault?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly, “My Lady, the blame lies not with me.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong call her ‘My Lady,’ Shi Xiaofei’s heart raced with happiness.

The two of them sat down at the stone table in the courtyard. Wisps of steam curled up from the plates, stimulating their appetite.

“It smells nice.” Looking at the delicious and fragrant dishes on the table, Shi Xiaofei used the chopsticks and picked up a piece of unknown meat, putting it into her dainty mouth. On the first chew, the flavor of the meat filled her taste buds.

Huang Xiaolong slightly dazed watching Shi Xiaofei’s loveable eating expression, forgetting to eat.

Shi Xiaofei was even more loveable when she was eating, her small cherry lips moved as she chewed her food, issuing low sucking noises.

She suddenly noticed Huang Xiaolong looking at her dazedly and became flustered, assuming that her eating appearance was unseemly because she was impatient. Her face turned red, feeling embarrassed, sulking away as she scolded, “What’s so nice to look at when I’m eating?”

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “You.” He paused slightly before adding, “I suddenly feel that these dishes aren’t so appetizing anymore, I want to eat you.”

Shi Xiaofei turned even redder, chiding him, “Old lecher!” But there was a glimmer of delight in her eyes. She then changed the subject, “This inn’s roast meat tastes better than the one you used to make.”

Huang Xiaolong picked a piece of meat with his chopsticks, interested, “Really?” and transferred the meat into his mouth. Flavor filled his mouth immediately.

“It’s been a long time since I last ate meat roasted by you.” Shi Xiaofei added.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Tomorrow. I’ll go buy some condiments and we’ll have roast meat tomorrow night.”

Shi Xiaofei nodded enthusiastically, her face radiating joy.

“But, that Yelu Tianhao most likely won’t let leave things as they are, you must be careful.” Recalling the incident earlier, Shi Xiaofei couldn’t help worrying.

Huang Xiaolong was unconcerned, “Don’t worry, if that Yelu Tianhao dares to come back, I’ll make sure his lower part is permanently destroyed!”

Shi Xiaofei reddened at his words, chiding Huang Xiaolong again, “You’d better not use that move in the future, so lewd!”

Huang Xiaolong feigned confusion, “Which move?”

Shi Xiaofei’s petite fist landed on the side of Huang Xiaolong’s arm, “Naughty, always bullying me.”

“Then I’ll behave and let you bully me tonight.” Huang Xiaolong said as he pulled Shi Xiaofei into his embrace.

While Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were basking in their romance, outside, a shocking piece of news spread through the White Tiger City.

“What? A black-haired young man wounded two mid-First Order Highgod Realm masters in one strike?!”

“Any idea who that black-haired young man is?”

“No, but I heard others say that those two Highgod Realm masters belong to the Saint Lord Galaxy’s Yelu Family!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yelu Family? The same Yelu Family known as the Immortal Royal Family?!

Before the night ended, various forces were astonished.

Inside a restaurant in another part of White Tiger City, Liu Yun and Qi Wen also heard the news.

“I wonder who that black-haired young man is. Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother, do you think it might be Junior Apprentice-brother?” When Qi Wen heard the news, she asked Liu Yun with an interested expression.

Liu Yun was stumped by her question, answering while shaking his head, “Probably not, the talks going around said that the two Yelu Family masters are both mid-First Order Highgod Realm. A single one of them already rivals the Zhu Family’s Patriarch. Although Junior Apprentice-brother’s strength is amazing, injuring both of them at the same time isn’t very likely.”

Liu Yun remembered clearly that Huang Xiaolong had used his full strength in that single palm strike, and it was barely sufficient to send Zhu Chu flying.

Qi Wen nodded, agreeing. Then she added, “That’s true, even though Junior Apprentice-brother’s is amazing, he doesn’t possess such strength at this point...” Qi Wen’s voice trailed off here, her delicate face stiffened.

Liu Yun felt her behavior was strange, hence he turned around to look; a few people were standing at the entrance. This group was none other than the Zhu Family Patriarch and several Zhu Family masters.

However, Zhu Chu wasn’t at the front of the group. Instead, the one leading them was a tall and burly old man with an overwhelming aura, his eyes and hair were crimson red.

Liu Yun’s face tightened, this crimson-haired old man was the Zhu Family’s Ancestor, Zhu Heng.

The moment the Zhu Family’s group entered the restaurant, Zhu Chu almost immediately noticed Liu Yun and Qi Wen. Zhu Chu was surprised for a moment, but a cold snort came from Zhu Family Ancestor Zhu Heng. He then led the group to Liu Yun and Qi Wen’s table.

When Zhu Heng reached them, his cold voice bore into Liu Yun’s heart, “Little brat, take out the blood contract and I won’t kill you! I’ll give Feng Yang this much face.”

Liu Yun was apprehensive and angry, this Zhu Family Ancestor was just downright shameless. The blood contract was lost by the Zhu Family Patriarch, Zhu Chu, and now they wanted the it back.

“It can’t be done.” Despite being pressured by Zhu Heng’s divine might, suppressing Liu Yun’s thoughts of refusal, he gritted his teeth and still refused.

After all, the blood contract was a hindrance to him and Qi Wen’s happiness.

Hearing Liu Yun’s answer, Zhu Heng’s expression became even colder. His hand suddenly gripped the air and Liu Yun was lifted by his neck. Liu Yun’s face turned purple, out of breath.

Qi Wen couldn’t bear watching Liu Yun being treated so and turned to attack Zhu Heng in fury. But, before she could make a move, she was knocked into the air by an invisible force, crashing to the floor.

Zhu Heng snorted, coldly looking at Liu Yun, “Little brat, you were so courageous to speak to me this way that I assumed you’ve already broken through to Highgod Realm.” Zhu Heng took off Liu Yun’s spatial ring and pulled it into his hand, breaking the restrictions on it. He directly took out the blood contract.

Watching the blood contract being snatched away, Liu Yun was anxious and enraged, growling like a wounded beast.

Zhu Heng casually waved his hand and Liu Yun was thrown out from the restaurant, his mocking voice sounded “If you want to take back the blood contract, tell your Master to come. Of course, you can also send Huang Xiaolong over, I really want to see if that Huang Xiaolong is as strong as the rumors say, able to defeat a Second Order Highgod Realm master!” Zhu Heng released his Second Order Highgod Realm pressure at the end to emphasize his power.

Liu Yun’s face tightened. Zhu Heng had indeed broken through to Second Order Highgod Realm!

Finished what he wanted to say, Zhu Heng turned around and left with all the other Zhu Family masters.

Zhu Chenyi had a complicated expression on his face when he walked past Qi Wen.
