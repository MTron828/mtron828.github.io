Huang Xiaolong went through the available options in his head repeatedly and concluded—to enter the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury, his best bet was to capture Shi Yinyu and scour his memories to get the method of entering the treasury.

Although the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders would enter the Corpse Soul Land to cultivate and train, the quota was limited. Most of the quotas were allocated to those Emperor Realm Ancestors’ personal disciples.

A Grand Elder like Luo Haoming had no chance of getting a quota since he didn’t have any backing.

Huang Xiaolong’s brows were scrunched together.

Would he need to change another identity?

But finding a suitable identity among the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elders at this point was too much of a rush. Not to mention the quota name list had not been announced yet, so he didn’t know which late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Grand Elders could enter the Gate of Nine Yin.

While Huang Xiaolong was in a dilemma, Yang Jing and her group reached the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s forbidden land’s corpse pools.

Shi Yinyu was cultivating within the corpse pool. When he saw Yang Jing, he leaped out of the pool and arrived in front of her in a flicker.

“Yang Jing, did something happen?” Shi Yinyu inquired out of curiosity as he noticed Yang Jing’s sulky face.

Yang Jing sourly pouted as she complained, “Someone bullied me.”

Her expression and her demeanor drew a chuckle out of Shi Yinyu. "In this Spirits World, who dares to bully my darling, Yang Jing? Tell me, who bullied you, and I’ll teach him a lesson for you," he said without any pressure.

He could tell that Yang Jing hadn’t suffered much, or it wouldn’t have been as simple as sulking in front of him.

Yang Jing harrumphed coquettishly, then complained, "It’s that Grand Elder Luo Haoming of our tribe."

"Luo Haoming?" Shi Yinyu was surprised, then softly laughed as he asked, “How did he bully you?”

He knew of Luo Haoming.

Yang Jing was still pouting her cherry lips as she complained about Huang Xiaolong rescuing Fang Mingyu. Then recounted what had happened when she went to the Wolfless Palace, demanding Luo Haoming to hand over Fang Mingyu to her.

But Yang Jing did not cook up any stories on her own, and merely recounted what had happened to Shi Yinyu.

“That Luo Haoming is truly horrid. He threw my precious whip and kept staring at my chest.” Yang Jing said hatefully through gritted teeth.

Hearing her words, Shi Yinyu’s gaze shifted to Yang Jing’s generous bosom.

“You’re just as horrid.” Noticing Shi Yinyu’s action, Yang Jing’s fingers reached for the softest part of Shi Yinyu’s waist, and she gave him a ruthless twist.

Shi Yinyu laughed bitterly and quickly begged for mercy, “My lady, release your hand first. You’ve twisted my flesh a million times that it’s changed shape now.”

Yang Jing did not release her grip. Instead, she harrumphed at him and said, “Tell me then, are you going to help me vent this anger?”

Shi Yinyu said after some pondering, “Luo Haoming is a Grand Elder. He has a status; moreover, he didn’t do anything wrong. Even if I’m the tribe’s Young Lord, I cannot punish him without a plausible reason. However, it is strange that you lost to Luo Haoming. Is Luo Haoming that strong?”

This was the doubtful point for him.

“How about this? Isn’t the opening of the Gate of Nine Yin a month later? At that time, give him a quota, and let him pass through the Gate of Nine Yin with us.” Yang Jing’s eyes sparkled with cunningness.

“Let him pass the Gate of Nine Yin?” Shi Yinyu raised a curious eyebrow, then smiled in agreement, “Alright then, as you wish.”

He understood Yang Jing’s plan. Since they couldn’t ‘rightly’ teach Luo Haoming a lesson, they would wait until he entered the Gate of Nine Yin.

“But I’ll make it clear right now, I don’t care about how you teach him a lesson after entering the Gate of Nine Yin, but you cannot kill him.” Shi Yinyu reminded Yang Jing.

His father would definitely investigate to the end if a Grand Elder were to die. And if his father were to find out that the two of them had killed their tribe’s Grand Elder for some miscellaneous matters, then he would be furious.

“I know, I’ll just make him kneel, make him cry, and make him crazy, but I won’t kill him. That’s fine, right?” Yang Jing giggled, then added, “You should be able to break through to the Emperor Realm in the Corpse Soul Land this time, right?”

Shi Yinyu chuckled dotingly. “Of course, my cultivation has been stuck at the peak of late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm for over ten thousand years. My accumulation of chaos law is sufficient. Entering the Gate of Nine Yin this time, I absolutely can break through to Emperor Realm borrowing the Corpse Soul Land’s power.” He looked fixedly at Yang Jing as he continued, “Don’t worry, after I breakthrough to Emperor Realm, I will marry you at the grandest wedding.”

Yang Jing’s smiling face turned bleak all of a sudden, and she whispered sadly, “Unfortunately, Master couldn’t see that day’s arrival.” Her eyes were red-rimmed with tears.

Shi Yinyu’s eyes glimmered with hatred as he was reminded of Gao Ning. “Rest assured. The Old Ancestor has given his word that after killing Duwei, his corpse will be hung above our Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe headquarters’ main gates. He is also going to invite various forces’ experts to witness it.”

Yang Jing nodded, and her voice hardened with a vengeance, “It’s unfortunate that I won’t be able to kill that bast*rd with my own hands.”

......

Two days later.

Huang Xiaolong was cultivating inside the Wolfless Palace when he received a message in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s talisman.

The message was related to the upcoming opening of the Gate of Nine Yin’s quota.

When he saw his name on the name list, Huang Xiaolong was genuinely astonished.

“Why is this name on the list?” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Logically speaking, he shouldn’t have received the chance to enter the Gate of Nine Yin.

As an afterthought, Huang Xiaolong sent a message to Tai Yue to find out the reason. It didn’t take long for Tai Yue to reply to Huang Xiaolong. Tai Yue replied that this matter was explicitly brought up by the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Young Lord Shi Yinyu to the Ancestor in charge of quota allocation to add Luo Haoming’s name.

“Shi Yinyu?” Huang Xiaolong immediately understood the cause and effect of the matter.

Most likely, that woman Yang Jing had recommended it to Shi Yinyu. Clearly, that woman planned to teach him a lesson in retaliation.

After knowing the reason, Huang Xiaolong laughed softly. In truth, he should be thanking Yang Jing instead; here, he was racking his brains, thinking about how to enter the Gate of Nine Yin, and now she had presented him this golden opportunity.

Huang Xiaolong focused and entered into cultivation once more, waiting for the day of the Gate of Nine Yin’s opening. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Twenty plus days passed in the blink of an eye, and the day of the Gate of Nine Yin’s opening arrived.

Huang Xiaolong arrived and waited at the determined square early on.

However, when Huang Xiaolong arrived, many of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders had already arrived. As the original Luo Haoming rarely associated with others, very few Hall Masters, Grand Elders, or Elders exchanged greetings with him other than a lukewarm nod of the head when he arrived.

Huang Xiaolong waited at a corner of the square.

As time passed, the rest of the Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders arrived consecutively.

There was a small quota of one thousand for entering the Gate of Nine Yin.

Suddenly, the crowd stirred.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze followed the crowd, and he saw Shi Yinyu flying towards the square with a group of experts. Yang Jing was one of them.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, looking at Shi Yinyu’s spirited, beaming face. It looked like Shi Yinyu was in a good mood.

“Young Lord!”

“Greetings, Young Lord!”

Upon discovering Shi Yinyu’s arrival, the Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders waiting on the square greeted him respectfully.

Shi Yinyu smiled and nodded at everyone.
