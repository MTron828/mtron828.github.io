“That’s right.” Feng Yingying answered with certainty.

“That’s too dangerous.” Feng Family’s Ancestor Feng Jingxi gave his opinion.

Other families’ Ancestors and Patriarchs bitterly persuaded Feng Yingying against going to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Feng Yingying was the sea tribe’s new generation Sea God, therefore the entire sea tribe’s hope was rested on her. If any mishap were to befall Feng Yingying while at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, it would prove to be a devastating blow to the whole sea tribe.

Feng Yingying slightly raised her palm to shush everyone, then spoke in a flat tone, “I know that going to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield at this time is more dangerous than usual... But, from the news that I have received, many of the devils that have run into the Divine World carry the Infernal Devil’s bloodline!”

“Infernal Devil’s bloodline!” The experts in the hall were astonished, and excitement seeped into the air. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Feng Yingying spoke again, “Yes, the Infernal Devil’s bloodline. I am sure that all of you know how crucial the Infernal Devil’s bloodline is. Although I have merged with the Sea God’s bloodline, I still haven’t fully exhibit the bloodline’s power. Moreover, the Sea God’s bloodline power and strength has not awakened completely. But if I get to swallow enough of the Infernal Devil’s bloodline, then, I will be able to fully control the Sea God’s bloodline power!”

"I will be able to use the Sea God’s bloodline to improve your bloodline talent, as soon as I can manage to fully control my Sea God’s bloodline power.”

The people in the hall trembled at Feng Yingying’s words.

“What? Improve our bloodline’s talent! Lord Sea God, you-you’re, saying this... for real?!” Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi almost blurted out, but then quickly explained, “I’m not doubting Lord Sea God, it’s just that our bloodline talent is innate. Generations of sea tribe’s ancestors have tried to use various secret methods to raise our bloodline talent, but were unsuccessful.”

Everyone looked at Feng Yingying.

Feng Yingying went on calmly, “Just because the past generations of sea tribe failed, doesn’t mean that it can’t be done. The power of the Sea God’s bloodline is not something you can imagine.”

Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi and other experts were filled with awe, as they respectfully said “Yes.”

At the same time, everyone was filled with excitement.

Feng Yingying had directly told them that the Sea God’s bloodline could improve their bloodline’s talent!

As the sea tribe’s higher echelons, each of them knew very well the benefits of improved bloodline talent.

A person’s talent was not only attributed by his godheads, but also by his physical body, and the bloodline.

For the sea tribe, bloodline was only second to godhead. If they could improve their bloodline’s talent, it would be extremely beneficial to their future achievements in cultivation.

“As long as I can fully awaken and exert the power of my Sea God’s Bloodline, I can improve all of your bloodline. The present peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm Ancestors have sixty percent chances to breakthrough to that legendary realm!” Feng Yingying’s words continued to draw them in.

The legendary realm! Their hearts trembled with excitement.

Sixty percent!

Doesn’t that mean, among the top twelve families’ Ancestors, seven to eight of them had high chances of breakthrough to that realm!

Feng Yingying took note of everyone’s excited expression and went on calmly, “I believe that everyone already could guess that Golden Brow has already broken through to that realm. But wait until I fully control my Sea God’s bloodline, that Golden Brow wouldn’t stand a chance in front of me and the sea tribe. When that time comes, our sea tribe will conquer the whole Vientiane World!”

“Not only the Vientiane World, all the neighboring word surfaces must tremble and submit under our immense power!”

Feng Yingying’s arms spread out, and vast bloodline power rushed out from her body. Her breasts quivered from excitement.

“Lord Sea God!”

“Lord Sea God unifies Vientiane World, undefeated!”

The sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs lauded with sonorous voices.

“Go back and prepare, tomorrow, all twelve families’ Ancestors will go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield with me, also Guo Shi, and Teng Fei.” Feng Yingying named a few other families’ Patriarchs, and said, “You will also go with me, others stay to guard the Sea God City, and listen to Feng Kaiyuan’s orders until we return.”

Her aim was to hunt for Ancestor God Realm devils at the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield, thus, she had decided to have all the twelve families’ Ancestors to accompany her.

The twelve families’ Ancestors were all peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters. With them forming the Sea Tribe’s Grand Formation, they could retreat without losses from devils with strength levels above the Ancestor God Realm.

“Yes, Lord Sea God!”

All the sea tribe’s experts acknowledged respectfully, and their voice shook the heavens.

That night, Huang Xiaolong stood silently on the roof of Cosmos Palace, pondering about his trip to the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield.

After exploring some information during the day, Huang Xiaolong could determine that the Wind Domain World was nearby the Lightning Pool Mainland.

It could be said that he was quite familiar with the Lightning Pool Mainland. The last time he had gone to the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield, he had stayed there for quite some time.

At that time, the little cow had mentioned about the chaos lightning pool from Lightning Pool Mainland, which had existed from the times even before the Divine World had come into existence. He had searched for that chaos lightning pool during his last visit to Lightning Pool Mainland, but had not been able to find it.

Since Li Lu had disappeared at the Wind Domain World, he also could try his luck to search for the chaos lightning pool while searching for Li Lu.

“Silver moon hung high in the night sky, and warm breeze blew in the dark,”

“Yearning for beauty on Cosmos roof.”

Suddenly, the little cow recited a poem that Huang Xiaolong had no idea where she could possibly learn it from beside him. Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment, and then laughed. This old cow! At times, it was truly hard to believe she was the reincarnation of a peerless old monster.

The next day, Huang Xiaolong set off from the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

Before leaving, Huang Xiaolong went to the Assembly Shrine to bid farewell to his Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor. He subsequently went to see Yao Chi and gave her numerous chaos spiritual pills as he told her to cultivate diligently, and then, he embraced her tightly.

The trip to the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield was much more dangerous than usual. On top of that, he didn’t know when he would return.

“You must bring Young sister Li Lu back safely.” Yao Chi said softly as she pressed her cheek against Huang Xiaolong’s warm chest.

Huang Xiaolong nodded heavily, and promised determinedly, “I will.”

Half an hour later, Yao Chi stood on the mountain peak, looking at Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappearing in the distance.

When he reached the Myriad Gods Manor, Feng Er, Gui Yi, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the rest were waiting for him respectfully. Huang Xiaolong led them out from the Fortune Gate, and they all began their journey to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Huang Xiaolong’s group moved furtively, hence, not many people knew that Huang Xiaolong had left the Fortune Gate.

However, a few days after Huang Xiaolong left, his absence was discovered by Wang Wei and Zhu Feng. They sent their subordinates to investigate and found out that Huang Xiaolong had left the Fortune Gate.

“Huang Xiaolong must have gone to the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield!” Zhu Feng gritted their teeth.

“Young Lord, do you want... to send a few people to kill Huang Xiaolong?” Elder Lu Tai made a cutting gesture across his throat.

Zhu Feng’s eyes turned frosty and sneered, "Huang Xiaolong, you want to play a hero who rescues the damsel? But I’ll turn you into a ghost of a hero while you are on your way! Go, leak the news to the sea tribe; oh right, also the Blood Imperial Sect, Golden Phoenix Pavilion, and the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate!"

Lu Tai complied respectfully.

When Wang Wei learned Huang Xiaolong had gone to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, he too left the Fortune Divine Kingdom, and headed to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield on the same day.

But Wang Wei headed to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield not because of Huang Xiaolong. It was because of his Master’s order.
