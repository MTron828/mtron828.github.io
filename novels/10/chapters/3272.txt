Chapter 3273: You've Broken Through to Enlightenment Realm?

Huang Xin, Huang Wendan, and all the Huang Family experts that came with Huang Houde were frozen in shock. That blade was forged from ten-thousand-year-old cold iron!

Even an Enlightenment Realm expert’s true fire couldn’t easily melt this stuff!

Moreover, their old ancestor had spent several years of effort to forge and strengthen that Dragon Blade to the point of certainty that even if an early Transcendent experts’ true fire burned for several days and nights, it still wouldn’t be able to melt it!

Now, the Dragon Blade was crumpled into a confetti of metal in Huang Xiaolong’s hands!

In Huang Xiaolong’s hands, the Dragon Blade was like the soft bread that people have for breakfast!

Huang Houde struggled to his feet from the ground just in time to see his Dragon Blade crushed into confetti in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Whilst enraged, fear reared its head in his heart. “You, your cultivation is not at high-level Nascent Soul Realm?!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Who told you that?!”

Huang Houde’s, Huang Xin’s, and Huang Wendan’s minds were shaken, and their eyes were as wide as could be as a thought came their minds. Could it be…?!

“You have broken through to Enlightenment Realm?!” Huang Xin asked with a pale, bloodless face, and his body couldn’t stop trembling.

Huang Xiaolong had actually broken through to Enlightenment Realm!

This had gone beyond all the circumstances they could have thought of.

Although Huang Xin himself was a Ninth Level Nascent Soul expert, ten of him were not matched against one First Level Enlightenment Realm expert. How could they not know how terrifying the power of a Transcendent expert was?

It was because their old ancestor Huang Ming was a late-First Level Enlightenment Realm expert!”

Once, the old ancestor had all the Huang Family’s grand elders join hands to attack him, yet he had easily defeated all of them alone.

Looking at the scattering metal pieces, fear filled Huang Wendan’s eyes, as no average Enlightenment Realm expert would be able to crumple the Dragon Blade into pieces.

In that case, Huang Xiaolong’s strength…?!

Mid-level Enlightenment Realm!

Maybe even a high-level Enlightenment Realm expert!

Listening to Huang Xin claiming he had broken through to Enlightenment Realm, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother to explain. His gaze scanned over the people who arrived with Huang Houde, and he ordered, “Kneel on the ground!”

His voice thundered in their minds.

In the same instant, Huang Xin, Huang Wendan, and all the Huang Family’s elders fell to the ground like a swarm of locusts, blood flowing from their mouths from the forced impact.

The might of a yell injured several hundred of Huang Family’s experts!

Huang Houde was completely stunned.

Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou couldn’t believe their eyes. In truth, from the time Huang Xiaolong had sent Huang Houde flying, the four of them were already stupefied.

Among the several hundred experts present, only Huang Sheng’an, Huang Qi, and Huang Feiwu knew how powerful Huang Xiaolong was. Hence, theirs were the only calm faces around.

Huang Xiaolong approached Huang Houde in the air step by step.

Seeing this, Huang Houde backed away in a fluster. “Huang Xiaolong, I, I was wrong. Please, looking at the sake that I’m the Huang Family’s patriarch, spare me. Let me go. I-I can give you the patriarch position! Don’t kill me, don’t kill me!”

Huang Houde felt his legs go soft from fear, and now, he couldn’t even open any distance between him and Huang Xiaolong, and his voice gradually turned to sobbing.

This was an innate fear toward Transcendent experts.

Huang Xiaolong ordered without any expression, “Get over here to kneel before my parents and confess what you’ve done for all these years to suppress them, every single thing you did!”

Huang Houde quickly discovered that his hands and feet were out of his control. His feet were moving on their own toward Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan. When Huang Houde knelt down two meters from Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan, the several hundred Huang Family’s disciples seemed to have lost their voices.

Never in these Huang Family’s grand elders’, and elders’ wildest imagination had they thought that one day, they would see their domineering patriarch kneeling to someone else, and list out his own mistakes and crimes one by one!

On top of that, he was kneeling to an ordinary Huang Family’s disciple.

Kneeling in front of Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan, Huang Houde was, in fact, struggling desperately to get up, but no matter how he tried, he couldn’t get up. He even thought that his brain wasn’t his anymore… But he was clearly aware that he was kneeling in front of Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan.

Sensing the prickling gazes from the several hundred Huang Family’s disciples staring at him, never in his life had Huang Houde felt such humiliation that he wanted to drill into the ground!

Then, right in front of these several hundred Huang Family’s disciples, Huang Houde narrated how he had excluded and suppressed Huang Jiyuan’s family, and how he had deliberately made Huang Baogui deduct Huang Chenfei’s and the others’ cultivation resources.

Huang Houde’s voice reverberated across the Blue Dragon Orchard. The several hundred Huang Family’s disciples held their breaths as they listened, as it had never occurred to them that Huang Jiyuan’s family had suffered so much injustice and unfairness in these decades!

At this moment, it dawned on them that the patriarch they had venerated was a narrow-minded and gloomy villain.

Just because he and Huang Xiaolong were rivals in their younger days, and there were some conflicts between them, he had retaliated on Huang Xiaolong’s parents, and family, suppressing them for several decades.

Huang Houde’s face ashen, as he wanted to stop talking but he basically had no control over what he was doing, and the words still came pouring out of his mouth, detailing how he had tripped Huang Jiyuan’s family repeatedly over the years.

There were some incidents even Huang Houde had forgotten, yet the details flowed out so seamlessly and clearly.

Huang Houde went on for a full half an hour before stopping. After stopping, Huang Houde slumped to the ground with despair in his eyes.

But at this point, when he wanted to beg Huang Xiaolong for mercy, his mouth couldn’t open at all. He remained slumped on the ground.

Huang Xiaolong raised a finger and sent a sliver of flame onto Huang Houde’s body. Huang Houde’s heart-wrenching screams cut across the air as he rolled and tossed on the ground, as his face twisted into a clump from excruciating pain.

Huang Xin, Huang Wendan, and the other grand elders were horrified, and there is no need to even mention Huang Family’s Golden Core Realm elders’ reactions. A few of them had pissed themself.

“Kneel,” Huang Xiaolong commanded placidly.

Huang Xiaolong’s voice contained an inviolable will that Huang Xin, and the rest of several hundred Huang Family’s disciples were already executing Huang Xiaolong’s order without realizing it.

……

Yan City, the Sun Family’s main residence…

The Sun Family’s Old Ancestor Sun Yao asked the patriarch, Sun Cheng, “Still no news from Huang Houde’s side?”

Since Huang Houde had led a crowd of people to the Blue Dragon Orchard, the Sun Family naturally had sent people to follow up on the situation.

Sun Cheng shook his head, “The Blue Dragon Orchard is surrounded by layers of formations, so our family’s experts were unable to get too close to it, much less see the situation inside. They only saw Huang Houde and a group of people entered the Blue Dragon Orchard, and heard several startling sounds of thunder.”

“Startling sounds of thunder?” Sun Yao repeated with a baffled expression.

“Yes,” Sun Cheng was just as baffled. “Did Huang Sheng’an cultivate lightning element related technique?”

“Did you find out about the Blue Dragon Orchard?” Sun Yao asked another question.

Sun Cheng shook his head. “I don’t know, I’ve never heard of this Blue Dragon Orchard in the past. The disciples below reported that the Blue Dragon Orchard belongs to a Huang Family disciple called Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong was missing for many years, but he suddenly returned a few days ago. He bought a large piece of land outside Huazhou City and transformed it into the Blue Dragon Orchard. It is said that it is he who lured Huang Sheng’an, Huang Qi, and Huang Feiwu to revolt. Some Huang Family’s disciples even claimed that Huang Xiaolong is a high-level Nascent Soul expert.”
