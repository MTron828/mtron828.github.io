Chapter 3546: You Shouldn’t Be Here

 

Feng Tianquan and the others were notified the instant Huang Xiaolong left the Eternal Heaven Alliance.

“He really accepted the order to offer our congratulations to the Solitary Alliance!” Qian Shaolin was shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s actions.

“He’s crazy enough to head over there alone!” Tai Shi frowned. “Ao Shenghai and the rest didn’t follow him there… Did he hurt his brain after entering seclusion? Doesn’t he know how dangerous this trip is?” 

The Gods of Creation from the Eternal Heaven Alliance were bewildered by his actions.

Feng Tianquan sneered in response, “Humph. Who cares what he’s thinking? Since he’s so eager to die, we’ll let him do what he wants. We can even leak his whereabouts to the Creation Palace. They’ll take care of him for us.”

Tao Shi and the rest nodded in unison.

Even though they were suspicious about Huang Xiaolong’s actions, they were more than satisfied to know that they could get rid of him with the help of the Creation Palace.

“According to Duan Jun, Huang Xiaolong had already reached the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. He has close to 3.3 billion units of grand cosmos energy!” Qian Shaolin frowned. “When he entered our alliance, he only had 2.3 billion units of grand cosmos energy! What’s going on?!”

“He probably used some sort of evil art to hide his strength,” Tao Shi growled. “There is no way he can improve so much in several million years. Even if he had an infinite amount of universe-level spiritual veins, he wouldn’t be able to refine all of them in time!” Pausing for a second, a glint flashed through his eyes as he continued, “It’s too bad the secrets on him will belong to the Creation Palace after this…”

…

Very quickly, the experts of the Creation Palace received news of Huang Xiaolong’s journey to the Solitary Alliance.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When Ao Ying heard the news, a flash of cold light crossed his eyes. He requested to be sent to the Solitary Alliance to represent the Creation Palace.

Leaping out suddenly, Duan Jun begged his master, Kai Dong, to allow him to follow Ao Ying. All these years, his hatred for Huang Xiaolong had reached the breaking point. He wouldn’t miss out on any chance to mess with Huang Xiaolong. It would be best if they could kill that b*stard!

Kun Feng, Kai Dong, and Hong Xuan looked at each other in silence.

“What is he up to this time?” Hong Xuan broke the silence. “Are they plotting something against us?” 

Kai Dong shook his head. “I’ve investigated the matter. He definitely left alone. Most of the Gods of Creation in the Eternal Heaven Alliance are still there. Those that aren’t are adventuring elsewhere. None of them followed Huang Xiaolong. As for the Star Dragon Couple and the rest, they’re back in the Star Dragon Universe.”

A light flashed through Kun Feng’s eyes. “Regardless of what he’s planning, we won’t allow him to escape.”

There was no need to mention the matter of Ao Yan and the rest. Huang Xiaolong’s possession of the Star Dragon Scale and universe-level spiritual veins alone were enough for them to make a move on him.

“Even though he’s alone, we can’t be careless.” Kun Feng continued, “Ao Ying and Zhu Yaowen will bring twenty other experts along with them!”

The three palace masters appointed the twenty experts instantly.

All of them were at the grand completion stage, and Duan Jun instantly became the odd one out. As the 21st member of the group, he was the weakest one present.

In order to capture Huang Xiaolong, the Creation Palace sent out Ao Ying and Zhu Yaowen. They were Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, and they were leading twenty experts at the grand completion stage! They were basically making a huge move to capture the brat!

The very next day, the assault party left the Creation Palace.

More than five months passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t run into any trouble when he went to the Solitary Alliance, and he arrived safe and sound.

Jiang Shaoyu personally greeted Huang Xiaolong the moment he arrived.

“You shouldn’t have come!” Jiang Shaoyu warned the moment they met. “The Creation Palace sent out more than twenty Gods of Creation who are all in the grand completion stage or higher! They might not dare to make a move in our alliance, but nothing will be holding them back when you leave!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Since I’m already here, I won’t be rude enough to leave before the ceremony begins. Moreover, it’s not like I can escape if I run away now.”

Jiang Shaoyu shot him a weird look when she noticed his nonchalance. “I’m not kidding! They are already here and they are led by two super experts! Ao Ying and Zhu Yaowen led the group. Duan Jun came along with them!” 

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “Previously, they used ten high-grade universe-level spiritual veins to bring him back to the Creation Palace. Now that he’s here, I’m definitely going to capture him again. I’ll raise the price to twenty spiritual veins!”

Jiang Shaoyu seethed with anger at the side when she realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t taking things seriously.

“Why don’t you stay here after the ceremony ends?” Jiang Shaoyu suggested. “You saved my life in the past. As long as I beg my father, he will definitely allow you to stay here for some time.”

“There’s no need,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong, a wave of emotions swept through Jiang Shaoyu’s heart. In the years that passed, she couldn’t forget the time they spent together. She always thought that Huang Xiaolong was hiding some sort of secret on him. After all, Huang Xiaolong managed to conceal them perfectly from the encirclement of the Creation Palace when they were leaving the Black Sea. Not even the Gods of Creation at the grand completion stage could avoid being detected by Huang Xiaolong!

How in the world could a God of Creation at the large completion stage detect the presence of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage?!

All these years, she had always been thinking about the problem.

She could tell that Huang Xiaolong didn’t use any sort of treasure to detect and evade them.

A cold sneer rang through the air when Jiang Shaoyu was still thinking about the problem. “Huang Xiaolong, I’ve been waiting for this day to come for far too long!” 

Turning around, they saw Duan Jun surrounded by the experts of the Creation Palace.

With her expression sinking, Jiang Shaoyu growled, “Duan Jun, what do you think you’re doing? Do you really think that my father will let you off easily because you’re Kai Dong’s disciple?”

“Little Sister Shaoyu, I was merely sending Huang Xiaolong my greetings. There’s nothing for you to worry about,” Duan Jun sneered.

No matter what, they were in the headquarters of the Solitary Alliance. Duan Jun was rational enough to know that he wouldn’t be able to make a move on Huang Xiaolong then. If he wanted to do anything, he had to wait till the ceremony ended and Huang Xiaolong left.

Standing before Huang Xiaolong, Duan Jun snorted, “Huang Xiaolong, rest assured that I’ll return the favor a hundred times over!”

“I changed my mind. I’ll ask your master for THIRTY universe-level spiritual veins after I capture you again,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Duan Jun and the others were slightly taken aback, but they roared with laughter in the next second.

“Huang Xiaolong, shouldn’t you have quite a lot of universe-level spiritual veins on you right now?” A God of Creation at the grand completion stage from the Creation Palace sneered. “Hand them over right now along with the Star Dragon Scales. We’ll let you die a little more comfortably.”
