Chapter 2152: Came To Make Trouble?

The person sitting inside store number ten, selling Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills, was a middle-aged man with bushy eyebrows, sharp and spirited eyes, and a thick beard that covered a good half of his face. His robust built exuded powerful vigor.

“Young Master, he is Senior Battle Emperor.” Zhu Xinyi introduced the robust middle-aged man to Huang Xiaolong via voice transmission. His tone was extremely respectful when speaking of the middle-aged man.

It looked like this middle-aged man had a high status in the Heavens Path. Otherwise, with Zhu Xinyi’s identity as the Heavenly Saint Country’s general, he probably wouldn’t show this degree of deep respect.

Zhu Xinyi went on to tell Huang Xiaolong about the middle-aged man titled as the Battle Emperor.

The middle-aged man was an expert from the Black Dragon Heavenly Country. On top of that, he was the martial uncle to the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s marshal. His status and identity were high up there.

The Black Dragon Heavenly Country was one of the top five heavenly countries in the Heavens Path, and it ranked above the Heavenly Saint Country. The Heavenly Saint Country ranked fifth, whereas the Black Dragon Heavenly Country ranked fourth place.

Although the Battle Emperor did not hold any authority, his identity was honorable enough for the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler to call him ‘Senior Battle Emperor.’

“Senior Battle Emperor, I will pay four hundred high-grade chaos spirit stones for each of these Chaos Heavenly Dragon Pills.” An expert from the Nine Supremes Heavenly Country respectfully made an offer.

The Nine Supremes Heavenly Country was also a recognized force in the Heavens Path, and they were ranked amongst the top one hundred.

There were at least eighty million heavenly countries around the Heavens Path, if not a hundred million. Hence the heavenly countries that could rank in the top one hundred were no doubt hegemons in their own rights.

From the attire of the Nine Supreme Heavenly Country’s expert, it was very likely that he was the marshal of the Nine Supreme Heavenly Country. Only marshals, rulers, and also princes of the top one hundred heavenly countries in the Heavens Path could afford to take out a sum of two thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones in one go.

Four hundred high-grade chaos spirit stones for buying one Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill was a reasonable price. It was neither high nor low.

However, the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor didn’t even bat an eyelid.

The Nine Supremes Heavenly Country’s marshal was left looking out of place and embarrassed.

“Senior Battle Emperor, I can pay four hundred and twenty high-grade chaos spirit stones for each Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill!” At this time, a general from the Cosmic Star Heavenly Country spoke up, making a higher offer.

The Cosmic Star Heavenly Country was also one of the top one hundred heavenly countries in the Heavens Path. Its ranking was higher than the Nine Supremes Heavenly Country, in the eighties range. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor remained stoic, rendering everyone speechless.

“I have a Firmament Divine Fruit in my hands. I would like to use this to exchange for Senior Battle Emperor’s five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills.” Suddenly, someone said loudly.

“Firmament Divine Fruit!” The surrounding experts exclaimed in astonishment upon hearing that.

The Firmament Divine Fruit was a level four origin treasure, ah. Although it was merely a low-grade, level four origin treasure, it was nonetheless a precious resource.

Once an origin treasure reached level-four grade, its efficacy was not something a level-three origin treasure could compare to. Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel surprised that someone was willing to use a Firmament Divine Fruit to exchange for five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills.

Although the Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill was a low-grade, rank-four origin pill, it was still slightly lower in value compared to the Firmament Divine Fruit.

Battle Emperor, who had barely batted an eyelid the whole time, finally raised his eyes. This clearly indicated that he was interested in the Firmament Divine Fruit.

Before the crowd’s excited gazes, that person took out a plant that was as long as an adult’s arm. On top of that plant grew a dark red fruit.

The dark red fruit was only as big as a fist, yet it emitted a gorgeous glow. The fruit seemed to be brewing all the brilliance of the world. Tens and thousands of living beings were growing inside the fruit, embracing the firmament in its bosom!

Firmament Divine Fruit!

However, while everyone looked at the Firmament Divine Fruit with burning gazes, they were also frowning. They could see that this Firmament Divine Fruit had not ripened. There was at least a hundred thousand years wait before it fully ripened.

A hundred thousand years was not a long time, but it was not short either.

Disappointment flickered across the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor’s eyes. He spoke in a low, solemn voice, “My counter-offer is three Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills for your Firmament Divine Fruit.”

After hearing that, the old man with the Firmament Divine Fruit shook his head, “Senior Battle Emperor should know very well that once the Firmament Divine Fruit is nurtured to maturity, it’s worth is much more than five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills. If I hadn’t been in a hurry to increase my strength, I would not have taken this fruit out to exchange for five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills.”

The Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor shook his head and stated, “It takes at least a hundred thousand years to nurture this fruit till maturity. Not only time, but it also takes a lot of effort. Not to mention, no one can guarantee the end result.”

Nurturing an origin treasure until maturity could end up in failure. During the growth period, it could wilt and die despite having a low probability of something like this happening. The risk of failure remained.

The two went back and forth bargaining, and in the end, the deal fell apart as they could not come to an agreement.

“Senior Battle Emperor, five hundred high-grade chaos spirit stones for each Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill.” An expert from the Heavenly Terror Country spoke after seeing that the deal had fallen apart.

Battle Emperor’s interest was piqued by that offer.

After all, five hundred high-grade chaos spirit stones were already a good price.

He had originally intended to exchange the five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills for a high-grade, level three origin treasure, but he also understood that this was a difficult matter. A high-grade, level three origin treasure was rare.

“For each Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill, I’ll give one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones!”

A split second before Battle Emperor agreed to the deal, a voice rang in the store.

One thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones!

The words reverberated in everyone’s eardrums, including the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor.

Though the Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill was precious, it had not reached the exorbitant price of one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones for one pellet.

And the person who made that offer was naturally Huang Xiaolong.

Originally, Huang Xiaolong had wanted to trade top-grade chaos spirit stones, but he changed his mind. The furor from top-grade chaos spirit stones would be too big.

The Heavenly Terror Country’s expert spotted Zhu Xinyi, and a cold sneer escaped his lips, “So, it’s you. You brought this kid here to make trouble, didn’t you? Five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones, can you really take it out? How dare you tease Senior Battle Emperor!”

This Heavenly Terror Country’s expert was called Sun Po. He was one of the Heavenly Terror Country’s famous generals. He had always been against Zhu Xinyi.

Because of Sun Po’s words, other heavenly countries’ experts were looking at Huang Xiaolong with suspicion and doubt. Five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones was a big sum for any generals of the top ten heavenly countries in the Heavens Path, and it was definitely not an easy sum to gather.

Can the young man beside Zhu Xinyi take it out?

Battle Emperor’s brows creased slightly. He, too, was doubting if Huang Xiaolong had come to make trouble...?

While everyone showed doubtful expressions, Huang Xiaolong casually flicked his fingers in the air. Numerous high-grade chaos spirit stones rained from the void, piling high to the ceiling in the store, instantly filling the store with rich spiritual energy.

Exactly five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones, not one more, not one less!

Everyone was dumbfounded, staring at the hill of spirit stones in front of them.

Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze swept over the Heavenly Terror Country’s expert named Sun Po as he spoke, “Just because you’re incapable of taking out five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones doesn’t mean others can’t.”

Sun Po’s expression turned extremely ugly.

Other experts from the Heavenly Terror Country were glaring maliciously at Huang Xiaolong.

Still, Huang Xiaolong successfully bought the five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills at the price of five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones.

After putting away the five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones, the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor was in a good mood. He was smiling amiably as he spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “I’ve been rude. I haven’t asked how should I address this young brother?”

“I’m just an ordinary person, unworthy of Senior Battle Emperor’s attention.” Huang Xiaolong responded and added, “If Senior Battle Emperor still has other origin pills, please contact me. I’ll take as many as you have.”
