Give him a good beating?

A smile spread over Yao Chi’s face hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, but she hesitated then denied, “It’s nothing.”

Huang Xiaolong took half a step closer to Yao Chi, and held both of her hands in his. He stared straight at her and demanded, “Tell me, or I really will get angry.” He deliberately spoke in a heavy tone, “The consequences are very bad if I get angry.” As he said this, he glanced at her voluptuous bosom and rounded ass.

Yao Chi’s face turned red instantly; every time Huang Xiaolong had been angry, he’d spank her. Saying that he liked spanking her was an understatement, as her solemn objections were also of no use.

After a second thought, Yao Chi said, “I went to the Fortune Hall to choose a task, but the Elder in charge over there wants ten Great Returning Divine Pills from me.”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows wrinkled slightly, he clearly heard the underlying meaning of Yao Chi’s words. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He knew that all Fortune Gate disciples did not need to pay any Great Returning Divine Pills when accepting a task, yet this Elder had demanded these from Yao Chi, which could only be described as a bribe.

Not to mention, it was not easy for an outer sect disciple like Yao Chi to take out ten Great Returning Divine Pills.

The Fortune Gate gave allowances to all its disciples, and ten Great Returning Divine Pills was half of an outer disciple’s monthly allowances.

“Also,” Yao Chi went on, “He said that if I want to continue accepting tasks there, I can go to his cultivation palace to communicate with him, and he’s only free at night, so it’s best I look for him at night.”

Go communicate with him at night!

It was obvious what this Fortune Hall Elder’s thoughts were, without any further explanations!

Cold gleam flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes hearing her words. This Elder actually dared to act so insolently in public? Even tried to take advantage of Yao Chi.

“Doesn’t he know who you are?” Huang Xiaolong asked. Even if that Elder wasn’t aware that Yao Chi was his woman, her identity as Li Chaosheng’s disciple should have been enough to deter such incidents.

Yao Chi shook her head, “He most likely knows.”

“Come, I’ll go over there with you right now.” Huang Xiaolong pulled Yao Chi’s hand, preparing to make a trip to Fortune Hall where disciples chose tasks, to see who that Elder was.

Right at this time, Li Chaosheng walked in from outside.

“Brother Huang, this... are you going somewhere?” Upon returning, Li Chaosheng’s subordinate had notified him that Huang Xiaolong was there, therefore he came over to Yao Chi’s courtyard to meet him. But just as he arrived, he noticed the murderous aura on Huang Xiaolong’s face and was unsure about what had triggered it.

At Li Chaosheng’s inquiry, Huang Xiaolong said to Yao Chi, “It’s better if you say it.”

Yao Chi firstly greeted Li Chaosheng, and then recounted what had happened when she was at the Fortune Hall choosing a task to him. When she finished, Li Chaosheng’s face sank. It had never crossed his mind something like this could happen. Now, he could understand the murderous aura coming from Huang Xiaolong. Anyone would feel the same.

“How does that Elder look like?” Li Chaosheng asked Yao Chi. There were three Elders in charge of the tasks.

Yao Chi described the Elder, “A little fat, not very tall, he has a big nose and always seems to be smiling...”

Li Chaosheng immediately knew who this Elder was, after listening to Yao Chi’s descriptions; a faint frown appeared between his eyebrows.

“What is it?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he noticed Li Chaosheng’s expression.

Li Chaosheng explained, “That person is called Sun Yao, and he is in Young Lord Zhu Feng’s faction. At the same time, his talent is quite good. At present, his cultivation has reached peak late-Third Order Ancient God Realm, it is estimated that in three to four hundred years, he’s very likely to breakthrough to Fourth Order Ancient God Realm. His strength ranks third amongst our Fortune Gate Elders!”

Sun Yao, a person in Zhu Feng’s faction!

Huang Xiaolong sneered, ‘no wonder Sun Yao’s actions are so insolent.’

“But, Brother Huang, don’t worry about this, I will definitely bring this matter to the Gate Chief, and request for an explanation.” Li Chaosheng reassured Huang Xiaolong.

So what if it’s Sun Yao? So what if he has Zhu Feng backing him? He, Li Chaosheng, was not a soft persimmon that anyone could mold as they liked. Moreover, this matter was indirectly related to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, and agreed to let Li Chaosheng handle this matter. Even though Li Chaosheng was a Fortune Gate Grand Elder, he couldn’t arbitrarily penalize an Elder. Therefore, he could only bring this matter up to Gate Chief Zhu Yi.

However, since Sun Yao belonged to Zhu Feng’s faction, even if this matter was brought up to Gate Chief Zhu Yi, Huang Xiaolong believed that it would gather dust before there was any real result.

‘Sun Yao.’ Huang Xiaolong repeated the name in his mind, committing this name to his memory.

Huang Xiaolong accompanied Yao Chi for a few days, then returned to the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

In these few days, Huang Xiaolong mainly gave Yao Chi some guidance in her cultivation. When he was free, he’d visit Li Chaosheng and inquire about some matters related to the Fortune Gate. Some things were difficult for him to ask Golden Brow Ancestor or Blood Knife Ancestor.

When Huang Xiaolong and the little cow returned to the Fortune Divine Kingdom a few days later, he went to see his two Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

The moment Blood Knife Ancestor saw Huang Xiaolong, he laughingly reprimanded, “Brat, you slipped into seclusion for so long, as soon as you returned from the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle. After you come out from your seclusion, you went looking for your woman first. It’s so hard for us two old men to see your face.”

Golden Brow Ancestor smiled as he said, “Should we punish him to cultivate in your spiritual blood pool for a few years?”

Huang Xiaolong was laughing as he agreed, “That’s good, this disciple is willing to do that.”

Blood Knife Ancestor laughed albeit feeling a little awkward. “If you cultivate for a few years in my spiritual blood pool, it will turn into a waste pool.”

Golden Brow Ancestor broke into laughter.

“In the coming days, you don’t need to go anywhere, follow these two old men and stay by our side.” Blood Knife Ancestor added, “Spend some days to learn my Blood Knife Technique!” Golden Brow Ancestor agreed, “At the same time, I will teach you about my Metal Domain Canon.”

Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic hearing both of the Masters’ words. He quickly thanked them, “Many thanks, Masters.”

It seems like the trip to the Clear Spirit World needs to be delayed.

Blood Knife Ancestor’s Blood Knife Technique and Golden Brow Ancestor’s Metal Domain Canon were considered as two of the top divine arts in Vientiane World. Now that both Masters were willing to pass on their knowledge to Huang Xiaolong, there was no reason for him to refute. Not to mention, he too was eager to follow his two Masters and expand his knowledge of the Divine World.

Although the little cow had lived longer than his two Masters, she was not very familiar with the current situation of the Divine World.

With that decided, Huang Xiaolong remained on the Thousand Spirit Mountain and followed Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor to cultivate the Metal Domain Canon as well as the Blood Knife Technique.

In the blink of an eye, two years passed.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation broke through again and again, from the peak of early Fifth Order Ancient God Realm to mid-Fifth Order, then late-Fifth Order, and just a few days ago, he had advanced to peak late-Fifth Order Ancient God Realm.

His Grandmist Parasitic Medium cultivation had also improved significantly in these last two years, reaching the middle of the first stage. The purple grandmist aura dragon had reduced by half again. Considering this speed, Huang Xiaolong estimated that it won’t be long until he refine the purple grandmist aura dragon completely.

Huang Xiaolong’s soul had also grown stronger with the help of the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell.

From time to time, he’d visit Yao Chi at the Myriad Gods Manor. However, Li Lu had still not returned from the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, even after these two years.

Occasionally, Luo Yunjie would come over to visit Huang Xiaolong and bring wine. Both would drink to their hearts’ content in each other’s company.

Luo Yunjie’s injuries caused by Wangu Ziyi’s white qilin flames had more or less healed.

"Right, I have heard that the Wangu Clan Patriarch and Wangu Clan Ancestors combined their powers to perform a profound ancient technique and have completely healed Wangu Ziyi’s injuries. Not only his injuries are healed completely, but his strength has also improved greatly." He advised, "You need to be careful around Wangu Ziyi."

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected Wangu Ziyi to heal completely...
