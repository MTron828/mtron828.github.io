Chapter 2317: Feng Yuanyuan

After Huang Xiaolong left, the news of Fu Yunjie’s Complete Buddha Saint Godhead, Brilliant Buddha Saint Bloodline, and Revered Moon Saint Physique started to spread through the city. Not a single expert managed to remain indifferent when they heard the news.

Even though there were tons of disciples trying to enter the Holy Heavens, it was rare for anyone to successfully pass the test in a hundred thousand years. Someone with Fu Yunjie’s talent would be rarely seen, even with the many talented disciples showing up every day!

Every time someone like him appeared, waves would be raised through the city.

It went without saying that the news of Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes also swept through the city. After all, the world didn’t lack people who tried to kiss up to Fu Yunjie’s *ss.

Huang Xiaolong’s talent also caused an uproar no smaller than the one caused by Fu Yunjie’s talent.

Luckily or unluckily for them, Huang Xiaolong had no idea what was going on.

In one of the tea houses near the registration venue, Huang Xiaolong stopped and turned to Di Huai. “Senior Di Huai, I’ve heard that the Heavenly Fragrance Tea here is amazing. Should we go in to have a taste?”

Di Huai was still reeling from the shock Huang Xiaolong had given him when he had taken the test previously. He still thought about the moment when Huang Xiaolong’s godhead was tested to be the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Godhead. When the question entered his ears, he snapped back to reality but had no idea how to react.

If he were to be honest, towering waves were battering his frail little heart right now.

His mind was filled with Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying achievement. He had used twenty short years to evolve his Mysterious Dragon Godhead to a Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Godhead, shooting up the ranks by more than three thousand places!

Looking at Di Huai’s stunned expression, Huang Xiaolong repeated himself.

“Yes, yes, sure! Let’s go!” Di Huai chuckled and entered the tea house.

Looking around, Huang Xiaolong realized that the tea house was basically filled!

As they searched for a place to sit, a voice rang through the air. “Brother Di Huai!”

With his eyes widening in surprise, Di Huai turned to look at the source of the voice. A smile soon appeared on his face. “Brother Feng Cheng, it’s you!” He brought Huang Xiaolong over as he spoke.

The person who greeted Di Huai was a middle-aged man with a bearded face. His eyes were large. There was also a girl accompanying him, who looked to be in the prime of her life at twenties. Her beauty was enough to topple cities, and there was a trace of holy aura surrounding her body.

As soon as Di Huai sat down, he started to reminisce about the past with the middle-aged man. Of course, he didn’t forget to introduce the man to Huang Xiaolong. “Xiaolong, this is the Holy Emperor of the Qianyuan Holy Gate. The two of us used to be bosom buddies in the past! It’s been too long since we last met!”

Di Huai continued to introduce Huang Xiaolong to Feng Cheng.

“You’re Huang Xiaolong of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate?!” Feng Cheng jumped in shock when he realized Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

The pretty little girl opened her mouth and exclaimed in surprise. “You’re the useless tr*sh who tried to enter the Holy Heavens with a rank-nine hundred godhead?”

Trash?!

Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai frowned.

Feng Cheng hastily mediated the situation when he saw that she had probably offended his old friend. “Yuan’er, how can you say that?! Hurry up and apologize!” He turned to Di Huai and chuckled, “Brother Di Huai, I have spoiled my daughter.... She’s a little rude, and I hope Brother Di Huai and Xiaolong won’t feel offended.”

Hearing how her father was apologizing to the other party, Feng Yuanyuan pouted. “I only spoke the truth! How can anyone with the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead, Azure Dragon Saint Bloodline, and Coiling Dragon Saint Physique not be considered trash?! What a joke.”

“You!” Feng Cheng nearly flew into a rage right there and then.

“It’s alright. Brother Feng, there is no need for you to get angry.” Turning to stare at Huang Xiaolong, Di Huai apologized, “I was planning to drink a few cups with you now that we met. However, I feel that we should leave. Let’s meet another time!”

After setting a time and date with Feng Cheng, Di Huai exchanged transmission symbols so they could communicate with each other.

With an embarrassed expression, Feng Cheng wanted to apologize to Di Huai, but he had no idea how to do so.

With a wave of his hand, Di Huai dismissed his concerns. “It’s fine!”

After he spoke, he turned to bring Huang Xiaolong away. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“It’s great that they’re gone!” Feng Yuanyuan sneered. “Who cares if wastrels like them leave?”

Huang Xiaolong, who was planning to leave quietly, was no longer able to endure the mockery thrown his way. He planned to let bygones be bygones after considering Di Huai’s relationship with Feng Cheng. After all, they were buddies in the past!

However, Feng Yuanyuan had gone too far!

Di Huai’s expression fell instantly. Is Feng Yuanyuan qualified to comment on a True Saint expert as she wished?!

Before Feng Cheng could open his mouth to mediate the situation, a huge commotion broke out at the entrance of the tea house. Fu Yunjie and Fan Xia entered with a massive group in tow.

The faces of Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai fell once again.

As if on cue, Fu Yunjie and Fan Xia noticed Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

“Oh? Isn’t this the shameless b*stard, Huang Xiaolong?” Fu Yunjie laughed. “Let me make a formal introduction. This is Huang Xiaolong of the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground, and he’s the one who tried to enter the Holy Heavens with his saint attributes ranking in the nine hundreds! What a legend!”

With emphasis placed on his final sentence, everyone in the tea house roared with laughter.

Everyone in the tea house stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Yuanyuan hastily grabbed her father and pulled him away from Di Huai and Huang Xiaolong, fearing that they would drag down her reputation.

Fu Yunjie naturally noticed her actions, and when he looked at her, a light lit up in his eyes. Quickly approaching her, he introduced himself. “Young lady, I’m Fu Yunjie of the True Reason Holy Gate. May I know your name?”

A brilliant smile lit up on her face when she heard his introduction. “As it turns out, young master is the famous Fu Yunjie! I’m Feng Yuanyuan of the Qianyuan Holy Gate, and I’m here to register to enter the Holy Heavens.... Please don’t misunderstand. I have nothing to do with that wastrel over there.” She pointed to Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to draw a clear line between them.

Huang Xiaolong turned to Di Huai when he saw the ‘amazing’ chemistry Feng Yuanyuan had with Fu Yunjie.

Nodding his head, Di Huai agreed.

Feng Cheng wanted to say something, but the words were stuck in his throat.

Fu Yunjie obviously didn’t try to stop Huang Xiaolong.

As soon as they left, the two of them returned to their courtyard.

“Xiaolong...” Di Huai wanted to explain the relationship he had with Feng Cheng in case Huang Xiaolong misunderstood and unleashed his rage on the Qianyuan Holy Grounds in the future. However, Huang Xiuaolong merely laughed, “Senior Di Huai, there’s no need to worry. We’ll go for a drink after I pass the second test!”

Di Huai was stunned for a second, and he roared with laughter. “Alright! When you pass the second level, we’ll head to the tea house to drink to our heart’s content!”

There wasn’t a shred of doubt in his mind that Huang Xiaolong would fail in the second round of the selections.

Moreover, Di Huai was sure that Huang Xiaolong’s name would shake the world as soon as he took the test!
