Chapter 2942: Huang Shuai Doesn’t Even Qualify to be A Dog by My Side

“Young Master Huang has come to Dragon Fish Creed headquarters?” Yin Yue asked her maid Li Nan.

Li Nan answered, “Yes, Young Lady, he is probably outside the Dragon Fish City by now!”

Yin Yue was agitated and blurted out, “Xiaolong is acting too reckless!”

In a hurry, she called Huang Xiaolong as Xiaolong, and she immediately sensed her behavior wasn’t right. After all, calling Huang Xiaolong by merely his name seemed a bit intimate, but at this point, she couldn’t think too much about it.

Li Nan sounded hesitant as she spoke, “In truth, Young Lady, for Young Master Huang, submitting to His Highness Huang Shuai could be a good thing.”

In her opinion, Huang Shuai was the Son of Creation, and therefore, Huang Xiaolong becoming enemies with Huang Shuai was extremely unwise. If Huang Xiaolong had the chance of submitting to Huang Shuai and working under him, he would stand above millions of others and under only one person, given his talent.”

Yin Yue shook her head, “You don’t understand, even if Young Master Huang chose to submit to Huang Shuai, it is impossible for Huang Shuai to spare Young Master Huang just like that.”

Li Nan was taken aback. “Young Lady, you mean?”

“I’ve heard whispers that if Young Master Huang were to really come to submit to Huang Shuai, he would definitely have Huang Xiaolong kneel for ten days and ten nights. Not just that, but during these ten days and ten nights, various forces’ experts would mock and ridicule Young Master Huang. Just think, would Young Master Huang have the dignity to see these people in the future?” asked Yin Yue.

Li Nan’s face turned a little unsightly.

“Moreover, even if Huang Shuai accepted Young Master Huang as his subordinate, he won’t give Huang Xiaolong any chance to grow and develop.” Yin Yue went on, “To Huang Shuai, Young Master Huang, who has eleven high-order Saint Fates is a great threat to him, how could Huang Shuai give Young Master Huang the chance and time to grow up?”

Li Nan’s expression turned worse still.

“At that time, Huang Shuai would use various excuses to suppress Young Master Huang in every possible way. Once Young Master Huang shows any signs that could threaten him, he would absolutely strike at lightning speed to abolish Young Master Huang!” Yin Yue explained with a face full of worry.

When that happens, Huang Xiaolong’s life would be worse than a stray dog and more miserable than anyone else!

If he was abolished by Huang Shuai, living would be worse than death!

After hearing of the predictions of these worst outcomes, Li Nan too started feeling anxious, “Then, Young Lady, we must hurry and inform Young Master Huang, tell him to leave the Dragon Fish Creed as fast as he can!”

Yin Yue shook her head and sighed heavily, “It’s already too late!”

Now that Huang Xiaolong had come, how could Huang Shuai and Dragon Fish Creed’s experts let Huang Xiaolong escape right under their noses?

“Then, what about we beg the Lord Creed Patriarch?” Li Nan came up with another method and asked urgently, “If the Lord Patriarch speaks out for Huang Xiaolong, maybe they will give the Lord Patriarch some face and let Young Master Huang go?”

After all, their Silver Shadow Creed Patriarch, Lord Zeng Lin, was also a powerful Dao Venerable expert comparable to the Dragon Fish Creed’s Lord Bi Cheng.

Yin Yue’s eyes glimmered, but she shook her head in the end, “If this was another time and matter, they might have agreed if my master spoke for someone, but this matter has escalated too far!”

The Dragon Fish Creed and several other creeds had allied, and with the Creation Ceremony around the corner, it seemed that this trend was already unstoppable. Even her master’s reputation was useless at this point.

Anyone asking for leniency on Huang Xiaolong’s behalf was useless!

They had truly reached a point where no one in the world could protect Huang Xiaolong.

Despite knowing Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to escape his fate, Yin Yue and her maid Li Nan still rushed out of the residence towards the city gates.

Yin Yue’s Eldest Senior brother Chen Tianyang, and Silver Shadow Creed’s Ancestor Hou Tingwei were delighted when they got news of Huang Xiaolong’s arrival.

“That Huang Xiaolong really came to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai?” Hou Tingwei smiled slyly and went on, “Is he really ignorant and naive? Does he think His Highness Huang Shuai will show mercy just because he submitted within the given deadline?”

A blood feud had already formed when Huang Xiaolong had gone to the Silver Shadow Creed and abolished his personal disciple. On the other hand, Chen Tianyang was sent flying out of the Silver Shadow City by a flick of Huang Xiaolong’s sleeve. Thus, his hatred towards Huang Xiaolong was no less than Hou Tingwei.

The two stepped out of the residence after Yin Yue, however, their destination was the same as Yin Yue—the Dragon Fish City’s gates.

At the same time, experts from various forces were crowded outside the city gates, pointing at and talking about Huang Xiaolong.

If one had to name the most famous genius in the Divine Tuo Holy World right now, apart from Huang Shuai, it would be none other than Huang Xiaolong.

He had eleven high-order Saint Fates, and three dao souls ranked in the top five! Most important of all, Huang Xiaolong had cosmos energy when he was only a Primal Ancestor! In the battle at the Monarch Yu Sacred Land, he had defeated the Xuanyuan Creed’s Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable, Bi Ye! In the same battle, the Xuanyuan Creed’s Young Patriarch Xuanyuan Potian had to flee for his life!

There was a rumor circulating in the Silver Shadow Creed that even the peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm ancestor, Hou Tingwei, had failed to do anything about Huang Xiaolong.

Liu Xinxin looked at Huang Xiaolong with a beaming smug face. She wasted no time as mocking words flew out of her mouth, “Huang Xiaolong, where have you been hiding for all these days? You finally regret opposing our Dragon Fish Creed this whole time and have come to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai?”

Yang Jia, Lu Chengfeng, and the others laughed as if on cue.

Xuanyuan Potian took over the helm, “It’s not impossible if you want to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai. Just now, His Highness Huang Shuai sent a message, he says to let you kneel outside the Dragon Fish City for two days. After two days, you can enter the city for the Creation Ceremony, and seek an audience with His Highness!”

Then, Liu Xinxin pointed at the three people behind her as if she couldn’t wait to announce her merit, laughing brightly as she said to Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, do you want to know how I entertain these slaves of yours these days?”

But just as she finished, Huang Xiaolong merely extended his arm, and Liu Xinxin fell into his hands.

A piercing cold gleam flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, raising Liu Xinxin off the ground by the neck like he was raising a dead duck. Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded like the frigid qi coming from a purgatory of ice, “Who told you that I’m here to submit to Huang Shuai that brat?”

Everyone blanked for a second. No one had expected Huang Xiaolong to attack Liu Xinxin.

When Lin Zhuoyi reacted a second later, he pointed at Huang Xiaolong and shouted angrily, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you dare you attack others right in the midst of the Dragon Fish Creed’s headquarters? You really want to die so badly?! Release Junior Sister Liu Xinxin this instant!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Noisy!”

With a flick of his sleeve, Lin Zhuoyi, the Dragon Fish Creed’s young patriarch, was knocked backward into the air, and he slammed into the Dragon Fish City’s city walls with half of his body buried in the wall.

Others sucked in a breath of cold air after seeing this.

Lin Zhuoyi, a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable Realm expert with combat power comparable to a Third Esteem Dao Venerable, was swept away by Huang Xiaolong as if he was throwing garbage!

Many had not seen Huang Xiaolong battle before this, thus many of them only had thought that half of them were rumors, but now, everyone was shocked speechless.

Not to mention, the Dragon Fish City’s city walls were built with the hardest dao stone found in the Divine Tuo Holy World, which was further strengthened by the many runes inscribed by Dragon Fish Creed’s Dao Venerable experts. The city walls were almost unbreakable. The average mid-level Dao Venerables’ attack wouldn’t even leave a mark on it, yet Lin Zhuoyi was practically embedded into the wall…

Even Xuanyuan Potian, who had been clamoring, was frightened back.

Liu Xinxin’s face was drained of blood, yet she still glared at Huang Xiaolong angrily.

“Huang Xiaolong, didn’t you come to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai?! What are you doing now?! This is the Dragon Fish City, the Dragon Fish Creed’s headquarters. All of our patriarchs are here, you won’t be able to escape!” There was a slight tremor in Liu Xinxin’s voice. It had really never occurred to her that Huang Xiaolong would have the guts to attack her inside Dragon Fish City.

“Submit to Huang Shuai? Is he qualified?” Huang Xiaolong derided, “Huang Shuai doesn't even qualify to be a dog by my side!”

Huang Xiaolong’s words caused an uproar in the crowd.

“As for what I want to do?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “You will know soon.”

Then, before Liu Xinxin’s terrified eyes, Huang Xiaolong slowly, but surely, tightened his fingers around her neck and increased his force. In the next second, the crisp noises of breaking bones rang as her neck was crushed!
