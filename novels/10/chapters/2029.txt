Chapter 2030: Sixth Order Emperor

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was laughing his face off, Wu Shaowu couldn’t help but frown. Will Huang Xiaolong really give me two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones?

When he was about to ask again, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, and countless spirit stones fell from the sky. It was as though it was raining spirit stones as it landed all around them.

Looking at the storm of spirit stones, everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Several ancestors jumped to the side in order to avoid taking a chaos spirit stone to the head.

The rain of spirit stones only stopped after several minutes.

Staring at the mountain of spirit stones before him, even someone like Wu Shaowu couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath in disbelief. “This... this...”

The stones in front of him weren’t low-grade chaos spirit stones. They were mid-grade chaos spirit stones!

Two hundred million of them!

There were two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones sitting in front of him!

Even someone like the King of Darkness, who had experienced endless shock ever since he had met Huang Xiaolong, couldn’t help but widen his eyes in shock. Even for an overlord like him, two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones was an astronomical amount!

As for the ancestors of the Heaven Devouring Empire, they couldn’t help but swallow mouthfuls of saliva in shock.

When had they ever seen so many mid-grade chaos spirit stones in one place?! There was no need to mention two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones. They hadn’t even seen two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones!

The only person other than Huang Xiaolong who could keep their calm was the little cow. After all, she had long since learned of his ability.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the expression of shock on Wu Shaowu’s face and chuckled, “Here’s two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones. How’s that?”

Wu Shaowu felt his heart quaking. “Are these two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones for me?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

After sucking in a long breath, Wu Shaowu turned to Huang Xiaolong and bowed, “Many thanks to Your Majesty, the King of Hell, for your generosity! Wu Shaowu is willing to submit to Your Majesty!”

A brilliant smile broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Soon, the ancestors from the Heaven Devouring Empire swore their alliance to Huang Xiaolong.

“Xiaolong... that... are there more mid-grade chaos spirit stones?” The King of Darkness hesitated for a second before asking.

Huang Xiaolong stared at him in stunned silence.

The little cow was different, she opened her mouth, and a hearty guffaw left her lips. “Hahahahahahaha!”

The King of Darkness turned to glare at her, and he snapped, “What are you laughing at, you old cow...”

The little cow tilted her head to the side and continued laughing, “What has my laughter got to do with you?”

“Alright, enough... Stop bickering...” Huang Xiaolong interrupted the two of them. He didn’t wish for what happened in the palace to replay itself, and he tossed a spatial ring over to the King of Darkness. There were five hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones contained in it.

When the King of Darkness saw the mountains of mid-grade chaos spirit stones in the ring, he nearly jumped with fright. The ring suddenly felt much heavier, and he was afraid he would drop it.

“If you need more, just let me know.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The King of Darkness stared at Huang Xiaolong with his jaws agape.

Turning his attention back to the Imperial Beast Devil Stele, Huang Xiaolong decided to refine it on the spot. After all, Wu Shaowu had already surrendered, and there was no point in dragging it out.

With the King of Darkness and the little cow, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of any attacks from the groups of devil beasts on the divine plane.

When Wu Shaowu heard that Huang Xiaolong planned to refine the Imperial Beast Devil Stele on the spot, he brought his men to set up the Heaven Devouring Grand Formation.

When they were done, Huang Xiaolong rose into the air as his hands landed on the Imperial Beast Devil Stele. He started to circulate the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as he started the refinement process.

In an instant, the stele emitted blinding rays of light, and a stream of darkness energy poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

His body shook when the energy entered his body.

The amount of energy was several times stronger than when he absorbed the other devil steles. The energy poured into his body without signs of stopping, and it tried to freeze his body over and over again.

As Huang Xiaolong’s godheads revolved around him, they swallowed the darkness energy coming from the devil stele. It was especially so for the Archdevil Supreme Godhead as it sucked up a huge majority of the energy.

The Heart of Hell pounded as it emitted rays of light.

Several days passed...

As the darkness energy contained in the devil stele poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body, the aura of the Beast King slowly emerged from within him.

When Huang Xiaolong released the aura, the devil beasts in the Devil Abyss’ middle regions turned and fled.

Two months passed just like that, and Huang Xiaolong’s body shook. He smashed through the Fifth Order’s bottleneck, and he entered the early Sixth Order Emperor Realm. With the Imperial Beast Devil Stele’s help, he quickly solidified his foundations as his cultivation continued to rise.

Behind Huang Xiaolong, three Archdevil phantoms appeared, and they devoured a huge amount of the darkness energy coming from the devil stele before sending it back into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Blood Eye Devil Stele, Myriad Curses Devil Stele, and the Glaze Devil Stele spun around Huang Xiaolong as they turned into guides for directing the darkness energy into his body.

Originally, Wu Shaowu had ordered everyone to set up the Heaven Devouring Formation as they didn’t want Huang Xiaolong’s refinement process to be disturbed by the devil beasts. When they saw the devil beasts retreating far away, they finally relaxed.

The little cow and the King of Darkness stood quite a distance away from Huang Xiaolong as they remained vigilant.

“Old Black, what do you need so many mid-grade chaos spirit stones for? Don’t tell me you’re still thinking about your Heavenly Phoenix Hairpin...” The little cow asked all of a sudden.

Killing intent flashed through the King of Darkness’s eyes, and he glared at her.

“Fine, fine! I won’t talk about your Heavenly Phoenix Hairpin...” Despite what she said, the little cow muttered under her breath, “I’ve heard that Wan Xiaorong is still single after so many years...”

When the words entered the King of Darkness’s ears, his hands trembled.

Wan Xiaorong—the name that had been on his heart the whole time, the name that had been sealed into the deepest parts of his mind! Someone finally brought it up!

A hazy look slowly formed in the King of Darkness’s eyes, and he was lost in his thoughts.

The little cow stared at him and tactfully remained silent.

...

Four years passed.

One fine day, a massive explosion occurred, and pillars of dark light shot into the heavens. The cries of divine beasts filled the air as Huang Xiaolong’s laughter soon followed. The Beast King’s aura that he had been cultivating since he had started refining the Imperial Beast Devil Stele burst out and enveloped the lands.

Even existences at Wu Shaowu’s level widened their eyes in shock. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Little brat... Has he already refined the devil stele?!” The little cow felt a little surprised at his speed. “Old Black, if you were the one refining the devil stele, how long would it take? Several hundred years?”

The King of Darkness couldn’t contain his shock. Even though he ignored her question, the look on his face was a clear indication that he wouldn’t be able to refine the devil stele as quickly as Huang Xiaolong did. He had never expected Huang Xiaolong to fully refine the Imperial Beast Devil Stele in four short years!

“Congratulations to Your Majesty for successfully refining the Imperial Beast Devil Stele!” Wu Shaowu led the members of the Heaven Devouring Emperor Country to congratulate Huang Xiaolong.

He nodded and allowed them to stand.

The little cow flew over and sized Huang Xiaolong up. After stealing a few more glances at him, she nodded and laughed, “Late-Sixth Order... Not bad!”

After refining the Imperial Beast Devil Stele, Huang Xiaolong had managed to reach the late-Sixth Order Emperor Realm. Of course, it was because the Imperial Beast Devil Stele was the first ranked devil stele. If he had refined any other stele, there was no way he could increase his strength by such a large amount.
