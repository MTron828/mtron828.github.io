Chapter 2563: The Devil Palace’s Scheming

Huang Xiaolong could feel the roaring holy energy within his body like a vast sea. In a moment of impulse, he raised a finger and pointed to the space ahead and a giant hole ripped open in the space Huang Xiaolong pointed at.

His finger force continued to expand as it rushed forward within the black hole, crossing thousands and thousands of miles until it exploded in the air above another holy ground.

All the experts of that holy ground raised their heads towards the sky in alarm.

"Patriarch, what is that?!" A holy prince of this holy ground stared at the streak of light that was Huang Xiaolong's finger force flying across the sky. It was seemingly weak, but everyone clearly sensed the terrifying destructive power within.

The holy ground’s patriarch's voice sounded hoarse in reply, "May-maybe, it's a certain peerless expert's most powerful attack?"

In truth, even a Fourth Heaven True Saint like him didn’t dare to claim what that light in the sky was.

But he was aware and absolutely certain that he would be helpless in front of this force and would get reduced to dust.

"Peerless expert? Could it be a Ninth Heaven True Saint?!"

Other experts of the holy ground exclaimed in awe.

The Holy World had a scarce number of Ninth Heaven True Saints, and they were the strongest cultivators below the Primal Ancestor Realm. In the absence of a Primal Ancestor, any Ninth Heaven True Saint expert could be hailed as a peerless expert.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was still on the deserted holy ground's snowy peak, looking down at the beautiful scenery around him as snowflakes continued to drift slowly from the sky.

A hundred years had passed, and the snow plains had completely transformed compared to the past. Looking at the luscious green grass spread like a carpet over the land, Huang Xiaolong gradually immersed in a wonderful state of mind.

The Inextinguishable Dao Heart glimmered softly inside Huang Xiaolong's chest.

Huang Xiaolong stood on the snow-capped peak just like that, letting the snow fall on him, and soon he was covered by a thick layer of snow like a snowman.

A few months later, Huang Xiaolong's body trembled, shaking off the thick snow off his body. Then he leaped into the air and whistled away, leaving the snow plains.

It was time for him to go back.

Huang Xiaolong chose to fly across space himself instead of using the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and he looked like a shooting star zooming across the vast, dark space, as he headed straight towards the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds.

Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to reach the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds. Therefore, on the way, he took out the Ghost Talisman Holy Ground and Devil Palace’s experts’ holy souls that he had suppressed inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and he refined and devoured them.

His three holy souls were stronger.

Huang Xiaolong entered the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds’ territory several months later.

Back at the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, Huang Xiaolong’s state of mind and vision were completely different from the time he had first arrived at the holy ground. As he looked at the ever prosperous and bustling streets and the numerous people entering and leaving cities along the way, it seemed so far away and so worldly in his eyes now.

Without becoming a True Saint, all were ordinary mortals, caught in worldly affairs. Now that Huang Xiaolong had stepped into True Saint Realm, he had broken from the shackles of mortality, transcending the cycle of life, death, and reincarnation.

Back at the Holy Heavens City, Huang Xiaolong went directly to the Primal Ancestor’s space to meet with his four masters, the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, and Elder Crow.

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong had returned after successfully finishing his integrating with the twelve high-order Saint Fates, the four Primal Ancestors laughed ecstatically, and they were so excited that saliva flew everywhere.

Tyrant Chu’s teasing mood rose after seeing Huang Xiaolong and he said, “Now, us few old men will dip in your light, and it won’t be long until we’ll need you to cover us.”

Lord Long chuckled, “He can already protect you now.”

The rest also laughed.

Huang Xiaolong inquired about happenings from the last one hundred years when he was integrating with Saint Fates, and he learned that the Devil Palace had not given up looking for him this whole time. In order to find him, the Devil Palace’s offered reward had reached a shocking sum.

At the end of the Cambrian Pool Star battle, the Ghost Talisman Founder and Gui Buwang had escaped with heavy injuries. Neither of them had surfaced to this extent until now, and one could only wonder which corner of the world they were hiding to heal. As for the Clear Snow Palace’s Lin Xiaoying, she had successfully entered True Saint Realm. Since all high-order Saint Fates were taken by Huang Xiaolong, Lin Xiaoying had integrated with a peak mid-order Saint Fate.

On the other hand, the Holy Race, Vajra Race, Ancient Dyhana Race, Reservoir Sword Holy Ground, and other forces had come to the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds. Bai Moyang, Jin Nu, and the others had clearly expressed their stance, and they intended to form an alliance with the Holy Heavens.

Though it was said to be an alliance, it was inwardly understood by everyone that these forces were more or less half a vassal to the Holy Heavens.

Even the Holy Lands Alliance’s Mo Cangli had come with the Holy Lands Alliance’s ten great holy grounds’ patriarchs, expressing similar intentions as Bai Moyang.

The Devil Palace that had acted in a high-profile manner had converged considerably these years. Many of their branches had been closed and people had withdrawn to the Black Devil Star Prison and the surrounding planets.

In short, the last hundred years had been quite peaceful, more peaceful than before.

“Oh right, there’s another matter, that Fu Yunjie and True Reason Holy Emperor Fan Xia were detained and sent over by the Holy Lands Alliance. They are held at the Blue Dragon Manor,” Lord Long remembered this matter and mentioned it to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, since the Holy Lands Alliance had shown goodwill, he had expected they would send over Fu Yunjie and Fan Xia.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong left the Primal Ancestor’s space.

Before he left, his four masters stated they wanted to invite the various holy grounds and ancient races for a celebration ceremony, celebrating Huang Xiaolong’s success in integrating with twelve high-order Saint Fates. The Heavenly Master asked Huang Xiaolong’s opinion and Huang Xiaolong did not object.

By the time Huang Xiaolong reached the Blue Dragon Manor, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s return after successfully integrating with twelve high-order Saint Fate spread like wildfire, creating a furor through the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds. The news reached other holy grounds and ancient races in the shortest time.

In the Black Devil Star Prison’s Devil Palace’s main hall, Qiao Jinyang, Cao Nan, and Gu Tian’s faces had never looked so bad as they did upon hearing the news.

“Palace Master, should we also send Huang Xiaolong a big gift for his celebration ceremony?” Gu Tian spoke as the gloomy air around him almost solidified. “We should kill Lin Xiaoying, then send her head to Huang Xiaolong as a celebratory gift!”

Cao Nan nodded his head in agreement, “Lin Xiaoying and Huang Xiaolong’s relationship is obvious to all, therefore, killing Lin Xiaoying would definitely give Huang Xiaolong unbearable pain.”

Qiao Jinyang shook his head, “That’s not the way, now that Huang Xiaolong has fully integrated twelve high-order Saint Fates, it is not necessary to butt heads with Huang Xiaolong.” his voice lowered as he went on, “But we can capture Lin Xiaoying, then negotiate with the Holy Heavens and Huang Xiaolong, and force Huang Xiaolong to vow with grand dao that he will never attack our Devil Palace!”

Cao Nan and Gu Tian exchanged a look.

“In that case, we might as well capture the other two girls, Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi, too!” Gu Tian’s eerie voice sounded, “In the celebration ceremony, Xue Lingyun will surely be bringing Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and Lin Xiaoying with her to Holy Heavens. We’ll intercept them halfway, and if possible, we’ll take Xue Lingyun as well!”

An excited light glimmered in Qiao Jinyang’s eyes, “It’s decided then!”

“However, this time, we must plan carefully, there must not be any mistake. We must ensure to succeed without any accidents!”

…

When Huang Xiaolong was back at the Blue Dragon Manor, the first thing he did was have Fu Yunjie and Fan Xia, this father and son, brought out of the dungeon.

After seeing Huang Xiaolong, Fan Xia begged and pleaded for his life, whereas Fu Yunjie seemed to be prepared for death long ago. He looked coldly at Huang Xiaolong and spoke loudly, “Huang Xiaolong, don’t get complacent because there will be a day when you’ll end up more miserable than me!”
