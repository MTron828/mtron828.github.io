Chapter 2913: Crush You Right Here and Now!

When Fatty Zhu saw how Huang Xiaolong started walking over to Chen Tianyang, his heart dropped in fear. He grabbed Huang Xiaolong, and persuaded, “Little brother, don’t tell me you’re planning to stop Chen Tianyang to ask him to bring you to Young Lady Yin Yue?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in affirmation.

Even though he wasn’t going to beg Chen Tianyang, it was true that he intended for the man to bring him in.

There was no way he could wait for several days to get to the entrance!

Fatty Zhu hastily tried to convince Huang Xiaolong otherwise. “You’re asking for death if you beg Chen Tianyang. He might be her senior brother, but he has been in love with her for a long time. He feels extremely repulsed by anyone who tries to chase her!”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback.

“In the past, there was a disciple of a small creed who planned to do the same thing as you. He brought some treasures over to beg Chen Tianyang, but you should be able to guess what happened.” Fatty Zhu continued, “Chen Tianyang personally shattered all his limbs and threw him out!”

“The disciple was the personal disciple of a grand hall master of a creed, but instead of taking revenge, his master didn’t even dare to fart in front of Chen Tianyang!”

“If you try, Chen Tianyang will probably kill you! After all, there’s no one stopping him from doing so!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “Don’t worry about it. He won’t be able to do a thing to me.”

Chen Tianyang was a mere First Esteem Dao Venerable. If he really planned to move against Huang Xiaolong, he might be blown to kingdom come if Huang Xiaolong decided to breathe heavily in his direction.

However, Huang Xiaolong could feel that Fatty Zhu was sincerely dissuading him from throwing his life away. He couldn’t slap a smiling face, especially one that was concerned for his well-being. “If I manage to meet Young Lady Yin Yue, I’ll remember to introduce you.”

A strange look appeared on the fatty’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

He couldn’t understand where Huang Xiaolong found his confidence.

For a member of a small sacred land, Chen Tianyang could kill as many as he wanted without batting an eyelid.

While the fatty thought of Huang Xiaolong’s sorry end, he was already making his way towards the man.

A sigh escaped Fatty Zhu’s lips, and he mourned for Huang Xiaolong silently.

“Are you Chen Tianyang? Are you Yin Yue’s senior brother?” Huang Xiaolong arrived before Chen Tianyang in an instant.

The disciples of the Silver Shadow Creed were shocked when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said. They didn’t expect for a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor to block their way. Of course, the same could be said for the others present.

“That’s right. Yin Yue is indeed my junior sister.” Chen Tianyang frowned.

When a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor stood in his way and called him by his full name, he was already enraged. However, he had to suppress the anger in his heart as he didn’t know the other party’s identity.

“Young Lady Yin Yue invited me over to cure her mother. Please bring me to meet her.”

With their eyes widening in shock, everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong. Those who hadn’t heard Huang Xiaolong’s conversation with Fatty Zhu felt a bomb going off in their minds.

After he returned to his senses, a brilliant smile appeared on Chen Tianyang’s face. “You’re telling me that my junior sister invited you over to cure the absolute poison plaguing her mother?”

Those familiar with Chen Tianyang would know that his killing intent was stoked when they saw the smile on his face.

It was no wonder he was angered. If an ant blocked one’s path and started to bullsh*t, anyone would be mad.

“That’s right,” Huang Xiaolong replied, seemingly unable to feel his killing intent. When he wanted to retrieve the Silver Moon Pendant, Chen Tianyang turned around and snapped at a disciple behind him, “Cripple this dumb*ss and throw him out of the city!”

He wanted to make a move personally, but he considered the fact that the other party was a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor. If word got out that he crippled a Primal Ancestor, he would be a laughing stock of the world! As such, he could only order someone else to do it.

“Yes, Senior Brother Chen!” Someone ran up in haste. “I will definitely cripple him before throwing him out of the city!”

Chen Tianyang nodded his head and ignored Huang Xiaolong as he continued on his way to the Silver Moon Immortal Cave.

Without a word, the disciple sent a slap flying towards Huang Xiaolong. As a half-step Dao Venerable, the strength he possessed was terrifying. The disciples around them didn’t dare to linger as they started to run in case they were caught by the shockwaves of the battle.

Fatty Zhu was no different. He shook his head silently. With his cultivation base, he couldn’t save Huang Xiaolong even if he wanted to.

When everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong was dead, the disciple from the Silver Shadow Creed was sent flying. With a thud, he slammed into the ground outside the plaza

Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws opened wide.

Chen Tianyang and the others who were on their way stopped dead in their tracks as they turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

It was the same for Fatty Zhu.

“Who are you?!” Chen Tianyang’s expression sank as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

There weren't too many experts who could defeat a half-step Dao Venerable as a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor in the Divine Tuo Holy World. There was no way the kid before them was a nameless nobody.

All of a sudden, a disciple of the Silver Shadow Creed yelled, “Senior Brother, Li Haitao has been crippled by the kid!”

Li Haitao was following Chen Tianyang’s orders, but he was crippled by the other party without any warning!

Those in the plaza felt their legs going soft.

They didn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong could act so unbridled in front of Chen Tianyang! How could he cripple a core disciple of the Silver Shadow Creed in their own territory?

That was a core disciple of the faction they were talking about! None of them were nameless trash in the creed, and even though his reputation wasn’t as great as Chen Tianyang, he wasn’t too far behind!

“I know Li Haitao! He’s the personal disciple of Ancestor Hou Tingwei!”

“Ancestor Hou Tingwei of the Silver Shadow Creed?! That’s a late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable we’re talking about! Moreover, there’s hope for Ancestor Hou Tingwei to enter the high-level Dao Venerable Realm!”

The disciples of the Silver Shadow Creed were shocked.

Chen Tianyang’s expression turned ugly as killing intent burst from his eyes. “How dare you cripple Junior Brother Li?!”

“Since he planned to cripple me, he should be ready to suffer from the same fate. I only allowed him to live after taking Yin Yue’s reputation into account. Shouldn't you be thanking me for leaving him alive?” Huang Xiaolong replied placidly.

Roaring in anger, Chen Tianyang’s aura covered the entire city. “Brat, I don’t care who you are! Regardless of whichever faction you hail from, I’ll crush you right here and now!”

“If I fail to kill you, I won’t be called Chen Tianyang!”

With silver light covering his body, he slapped Huang Xiaolong.

“Stop!” a delicate voice rang through the skies all of a sudden.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
