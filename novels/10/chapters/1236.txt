Just as Huang Xiaolong was getting curious about Guo Gang’s identity, Luo Yunjie informed him, “His father is Guo Jun, the sea tribe’s City Castellan.”

Huang Xiaolong immediately understood the situation with Luo Yunjie’s simple sentence. The Golden Wheel City had five City Castellans and Guo Gang’s father Guo Jun was one of them. However, the sea tribe’s power was stronger than Fortune Gate, Wangu Clan, Dark Elf Tribe, and even Primal Chaos Mainland, therefore, Guo Jun had indirectly became the head of the five Golden Wheel City Castellans.

In other words, Guo Gang could walk sideways in Golden Wheel City without any repercussions. No wonder he was arrogant enough to collect one golden bead from people who found two or more golden beads at the volcano.

This was obviously robbery!

But Huang Xiaolong decided to remain unaffected. If Guo Gang does not provoke him, then he was not so idle as to butt heads with Guo Gang. Then again, if Guo Gang did manage to find trouble with him, then Hung Xiaolong didn’t mind leaving Guo Gang’s corpse lying on the ground.

Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie then walked over to Li Lu and Wu Qian’er in the crowd.

Li Lu was an enchanting beauty of cold temperament, and Wu Qian’er was also a rare beauty. The two of them standing together naturally attracted a lot of eyes from the crowd, quite a few were actually salivating inwardly.

However, as both of them were clad in Fortune Gate’s inner disciple’s attire, most of the people did not bother them, except the three annoying flies buzzing around them.

“Two Misses, we would be very happy to get to know you. We are disciples of Long Rule Island, my name is Changzhi Qingshan.” Quite a good-looking and carefree young man courteously said to Li Lu and Wu Qian’er. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“This one is Changzhi Hongfei.” The other young man with emerald-colored pupils introduced himself.

“And this one is Changzhi Lingxiao.” A tall and burly young man said following the first two.

Huang Xiaolong had almost reached where Li Lu was standing and overheard the three introductions and nearly laughed out loud. ‘Changzhi Qingshan? Changzhi Hongfei? Why do their names sound like Japanese manga characters such as Ichikawa, Umemoto on Earth?

Long Rule Island?

Huang Xiaolong had heard of the Long Rule Island, which was one of the top ten islands under the Dark Elf Mainland. On the Dark Elf Mainland, the Long Rule Island’s status was more or less equivalent to Dragon Origin Island and Twin Cities Sect’s statutes on Fortune Mainland. It wasn’t strange that these three young men dared to strike a conversation with Li Lu and Wu Qian’er despite knowing they were Fortune Gate inner disciples.

“We are not interested in getting to know you.” Wu Qian’er directly rejected them, adding, “Please leave.”

Li Lu did not say anything at all, agreeing in silence.

Changzhi Qingshan, Changzhi Hongfei, and Changzhi Lingxiao were stunned, as they had approached Li Lu and Wu Qian’er with confidence. It had never crossed their minds that Wu Qian’er would directly reject them.

Changzhi Island was one of the top ten islands of Dark Elf Mainland, moreover, the three of them were Changzhi Island core disciples. It could be said on Changzhi Island that they were the people who could summon the winds and rain. Usually, girls were the ones who threw themselves at them, yet now, Li Lu and Wu Qian’er didn’t even look at them!

However, the three of them weren’t angered at all, instead, Li Lu and Wu Qian’er’s coldness ignited their excitement and interest. This felt very refreshing to them compared to the girls who threw themselves at them all the time.

“Leave? Two Misses must be joking, are the Two Misses’ names written here?” Changzhi Qingshan said, a shameless smile hanging on his face.

“That’s right, if you can stand here, why can’t we?”

“Two Misses, did you also came here for the golden beads? We know some tricks in finding golden beads. How about we discuss some of these tricks with you?”

The three Changzhi Island core disciples stood their ground, clearly having no intention of leaving.

Wu Qian’er frowned, as she could see these three Changzhi Island’s core disciples were no weaklings. They were at least at the Fourth Order Ancient God Realm strength, hence using force to make them leave would be futile. But then she suddenly spotted Huang Xiaolong and her beautiful eyes brightened immediately. A smile spread over her face as she called out, “Senior Brother Huang, Senior Brother Luo!”

A smile melted away the coldness from Li Lu’s face.

Huang Xiaolong and Luo Yunjie smiled and nodded at the girls, greeting them politely.

However, Changzhi Qingshan’s group frowned in displeasure at both of their presence.

“The three of you, leave now or I can’t guarantee what will happen to all of you.” Huang Xiaolong stood beside Li Lu as he said this indifferently to the three Changzhi Island disciples.

Changzhi Qingshan smiled coldly, “Then I’m curious to see what will happen to all of us.”

He had barely finished his words, and a scream escaped his mouth as his body shot out like a meteor and crashed onto the boulder in the distance. His face was red and swollen. Changzhi Hongfei and Changzhi Lingxiao’s face tightened. Neither of them saw when and how Huang Xiaolong attacked Changzhi Qingshan.

“Who are you?!” Changzhi Hongfei asked boldly, as he did not want to sound terrified, “Even if you are a Fortune Gate disciple, we’ll have the City Castellan Wang Shi hold you responsible for this and make him give us an account for injuring our Changzhi Island’s disciple!”

“Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong answered indifferently.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Changzhi Hongfei and Changzhi Lingxiao’s faces paled as they heard Huang Xiaolong’s name; they were so scared that they did not dare to utter another sound. The two immediately scrambled to pick up Changzhi Qingshan and ran off.

Li Lu’s eyes bent slightly in laughter, and she said to Huang Xiaolong, “Looks like you’ve got a big reputation, they ran away the moment they heard your name.”

Huang Xiaolong was the Fortune Gate All-Islands Great War first place disciple as well as a high emperor rank genius disciple. This information had spread through the four mainlands long ago, and any first-rank forces worth their salt would have heard about Huang Xiaolong.

Therefore, it was not an empty flattery when Li Lu said that Huang Xiaolong has gotten a big reputation.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled and insistingly said, “If you two say out your names they would be just as terrified.”

Wu Qian’er smiled, “Still, our reputation is not as loud as Senior Brother Huang’s.”

Due to the big crowd, many people did not notice what just took place, however, Zhou Xu, Tan Lin, Chen Jai, and Sun Qiang who were not too far away had been paying attention to Li Lu and Wu Qian’er; they witnessed this incident closely.

“That Changzhi Family’s disciple is an early Fourth Order Ancient God Realm, right? I am surprised, he couldn’t even take one hit from Huang Xiaolong.” Chen Kai said in shock.

“Getting rid of an early Fourth Order Ancient God Realm disciple is no big deal.” Tan Lin didn’t take the matter seriously, “My sword intent can do the same, just as easily.”

“Naturally, with Senior Brother Zhou Xu and Senior Brother Tan Lin’s strength, Huang Xiaolong is no match for you.” Sun Qiang flattered.

“However, Guo Gang is a trouble.” Zhou Xu glanced at Guo Gang in the far distance.

The area around Guo Gang was deserted, except for his guards. Other cultivators did not dared to be in their proximity, making Guo Gang’s group to stand out even more.

“Since we are Fortune Gate disciples, Guo Gang won’t have the guts to collect golden beads from us, right?” Tan Lin said, but his voice slightly faltered and didn’t sound convincing. It had only been a few days since their arrival at the Golden Wheel City, but they had already heard about Guo Gang’s overbearing and arrogant conduct. Therefore, there was a good chance that Guo Gang really didn’t give a damn about whether they were Fortune Gate disciples or not.

Right at that moment, Changzhi Hongfei’s group that was just beaten up by Huang Xiaolong, came in front of Guo Gang. Changzhi Hongfei smiled and bowed, and then said something to Guo Gang.

Guo Gang glanced at Li Lu’s group where Huang Xiaolong was still standing with her group. When his gaze fell upon Li Lu and Wu Qian’er, his frosty blue pupils shone with delight.

As Guo Gang was about to walk towards Li Lu, the ground quaked and swayed all of a sudden.

“The volcano is about to spit out the golden beads!” Someone exclaimed excitedly.

These had been the typical signs before the volcano had spat out the golden beads in the past.

In the distance, smoke and fire soared to the sky from the volcano’s crater. In the next second, small golden-reddish beads shot out from its mouth along with the blazing fire.
