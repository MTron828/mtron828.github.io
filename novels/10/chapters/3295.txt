Chapter 3296: I’ll Be Responsible

“Manager Liu, how are you doing!” The two officers changed their tune immediately. They quickly pacified the three of them, “You can rest assured. We will definitely look into this matter. As they have been driving recklessly, we cannot let them off with a light punishment! The police force will definitely give you a satisfactory answer!”

After speaking to the three, the officers turned towards Huang Xiaolong and Lin Kai. Without investigating the matter, they pinned the blame on the two poor souls.

Liu Decong crossed his arms before him, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong and Liu Kai with a shit-eating smile on his face.

Staring at the scene that played out before him, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less.

The two officers didn’t bother asking Huang Xiaolong and Lin Kai what happened, and they immediately snapped, “Do you even know how to drive?! How dare you ignore the rules when you’re flying?! Hand over your identification plaque right now!”

However, Zou Ru interrupted them, “There’s no need to speak so nicely to criminals. You should just lock them up and hand their flying ship over to us as compensation.”

Lock them up? The two officers stared at each other silently.

When they thought of the Liu Family’s reputation, they decided to listen to whatever the woman said.

As the general manager of Heng Rong Real Estates, Liu Pincheng was a big shot in the capital city! The two of them knew that the commissioner was someone of the Liu Family, and the two are definitely related!

As such, their bosses’ boss was someone from the Liu Family!

Finally making their decision, they retrieved two handcuffs and brought it before Huang Xiaolong and Liu Kai. As Earth had many types of handcuffs, the ones the two officers used were pretty ordinary considering their ranks. Of course, it would be hard for anyone to escape anyway.

Right before they could cuff Huang Xiaolong and Liu Kai, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “If you get out of my sight right this instant, I’ll allow you to live.”

?!

Everyone stared at them in shock. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were even many people who burst into laughter.

“Who the hell does he think he is? Is he threatening the officers with death?!”

“Even the members of the Ying Family wouldn’t dare to kill a policeman in broad daylight!”

“I wonder where this bumpkin came from… What an arrogant prick!”

The two officers flew into a rage and they wanted to cuff Huang Xiaolong immediately. “How dare you!” However, the policeman didn’t even get close when he realized that he was frozen on the spot. In the next instant, his body started to swell and he eventually exploded into a bloody mess.

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in terror.

That included Liu Pinchen and his family.

No one expected Huang Xiaolong to actually make a move against the law enforcement officers!

Anyone who dared to attack officers were basically seeking death! There was no doubt they would be given the death sentence once they were caught.

Huang Xiaolong glared at the other officer and continued, “Parasites like you who don't work for the people as a law-enforcer deserve to die.”

Even a hundred years ago, Huang Xiaolong hated all these corrupt policemen. After all, the lawful society rested on their shoulders!

To Huang Xiaolong, killing them was letting them off lightly!

“Don’t… Don’t come near me!”

It was too bad he exploded into a mist of blood with a single point from Huang Xiaolong.

He killed another one!

Everyone who witnessed the killing stared at him in silence.

He did it!

He actually killed two police officers!

Turning to Zou Ru, Huang Xiaolong decided to deal with them too.

“What… What do you want?!” Zou Ru screamed in fright, “I am a disciple of the Zou Family, and my uncle is Zou Yu, an elder of the family! He’s also a major in the special forces or our Huaxia Police Force!”

Circulating her energy, a passable aura filled the area. She was a Second Level Foundation Building Realm cultivator, but Huang Xiaolong suddenly thought of the person she was talking about.

“Zou Yu?” He was the young man he met in the auction previously.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong sent her flying with a flick of his fingers. When she slammed into the structures behind her, she emerged from the other side. A bloodied hole could be seen on her forehead when she landed, and all signs of life left her body.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care who they were. After all, all of them were the same type of people in his eyes! Corrupt officials deserved to die!

At least he allowed her corpse to remain whole this time.

Bang!

Everyone erupted into discussion when they saw that Huang Xiaolong even dared to kill a disciple of the Zou Family.

Lin Kai was stunned too.

He didn’t think that his uncle would kill three people in broad daylight, and they weren’t ordinary hoodlums! They were police officers and disciples of a prominent family! That was something he never expected to witness in his life!

“Zou Ru!” Liu Pinchen snapped back to reality and he screamed in anger. Charging at Huang Xiaolong, he roared, “How dare you!”

“So what if I did? Do you think you can take revenge for her?” Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive.

Gripping his fists tightly, Liu Pinchen knew that he wasn’t the other party’s opponent. As a Fourth Level Foundation Building Realm cultivator, he wouldn’t be able to stand against a monster of Huagn Xiaolong’s level.

Sirens blared through the air as several dozen police ships arrived on the scene. It was clear someone made a police report the moment things went south.

Ordinarily, the police wouldn’t show up so quickly even if a report was made. However, Huang Xiaolong killed a police officer, and that changed everything.

As soon as they arrived, several cannons locked on to Huang Xiaolong and a ton of enforcers left their ships to aim their guns at Huang Xiaolong.

“Raise your hands and get on the ground! Surrender immediately!” Someone yelled.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with them as he crossed his hands behind his back.

Liu Pinchen yelled all of a sudden. “I’m a disciple of the Liu Family! He killed my wife, and Liu Chang, your commissioner, is my brother! Kill him right now! I’ll be responsible for anything that happens!”

The enforcers who arrived felt their expressions changing in terror. They only received a report of two policemen getting killed on the streets. They didn’t expect a daughter-in-law of the Liu Family to die!

Moreover, that was the sister-in-law of their commissioner, Liu Chang!

Liu Chang wasn’t an ordinary disciple of the Liu Family, and he was said to be promoted the very next day!

“Shoot him right now!” Liu Pinchen roared in anger. “If you allow him to escape, I’ll sack all of you immediately! I’ll court martial you according to the rules of the nation!”

The enforcers who were hesitating opened fire immediately.

As the bullets have been reinforced to a whole new level, they could even harm high-level Foundation Building Realm cultivators. The cannons in the ships could damage Golden Core Realm cultivators with ease and that gave Liu Pinchen enough confidence.

Light filled the air as everyone shot at Huang Xiaolong.

A look of glee could be seen on Liu Pinchang’s face as he envisioned Huang Xiaolong’s death.

Looking at the toys they were playing with, Huang Xiaolong didn’t move a muscle. Instead, a ray of light flashed around him and everything stopped ten meters before him.
