Chapter 2022: Xumi Old Man

“What? Are you thinking about her?” The little cow saw the complex expression on the King of Darkness’s face, and she knew what he was thinking about. “You should leave everything in the past. You know that there is no way for you to be together.”

A look of rage appeared on his face as he snapped at the little cow, “What do you know?! You know fart about our relationship!”

The little cow snickered in response, “Yeah, I know absolutely nothing. In my eyes, your relationship is nothing more than a fart. When you went down the demonic path and were chased down by the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and more than a hundred world lords, where was she?! If not for your older brother, who knows how many times you would have died?”

The King of Darkness was about to rage, but when he heard her talk about his brother, he fell into silence.

Of course, the brother she was referring to was the King of Hell.

In the past, he had cultivated his demonic art and was hunted down by the various worlds. The only person who had protected him was his older brother, the King of Hell. He had blocked off waves after waves of attack for the King of Darkness.

Because of him, his brother had declared war on the world.

“Big brother!” A trace of bitterness appeared on his cold face, and his eyes turned bloodshot.

Since Huang Xiaolong had managed to accept his older brother’s inheritance and obtained the Heart of Hell, he knew that it was more than likely his brother was no longer alive.

The little cow naturally detected the change in his mood. “There’s a chance he’s still alive.”

The King of Darkness turned to stare at the little cow in shock.

“Your older brother had the indestructible Netherworld Physique. Even though he no longer has the Heart of Hell, there should only be two people in the world capable of killing him.”

The King of Darkness’s cold voice echoed through the air, “What about there were two of them?”

The little cow fell into silence after hearing what he said.

She never thought about the possibility.

However, was it actually possible?

“One of them is Lord Wan Shi from the City of All-Heavens... Who’s the other?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold back his curiosity, and asked.

The little cow looked at the King of Darkness, and they fell into silence.

After several breaths of time, the little cow broke the silence. “He’s called the Xumi Old Man.”

“Xumi Old Man?” Huang Xiaolong asked with question marks popping into his head.

The King of Darkness revealed a solemn expression as he continued, “The Xumi Old Man is the master of the current Buddhist Ancestor in the Buddha World. He was the strongest expert in the Buddha World, but he disappeared several billion years ago. Some people are convinced that he is no longer alive, but some say that he experienced reincarnation.”

“Xumi Old Man?! The Buddhist Ancestor’s Master!” Huang Xiaolong yelled in shock. He couldn’t wrap his head around the idea of reincarnation.

The little cow interrupted his thoughts, “The Xumi Old Man was the creator of the Godly Mt. Xumi.”

Huang Xiaolong received yet another shocking news. The Xumi Old Man had created the top-grade grandmist treasure like the Godly Mt. Xumi?! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Xumi Old Man...

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think about the replica of the Godly Mt. Xumi he had obtained in the lower worlds. In the past, he had met an old man on his journey to locate the Godly Mt. Xumi. Could it be that he had already met the old man?

“What was that about the Xumi Old Man undergoing reincarnation?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

The little cow continued her explanation, “There were rumors that the Xumi Old Man managed to obtain a heaven-defying technique called the Reincarnation Art. After cultivating it, he will be able to experience a rebirth. In the past, the Xumi Old Man had failed to break into the high-level Sovereign Realm. He threw himself into the reincarnation cycle to experience another life because of that. If he succeeded and lived for another lifetime, it was extremely likely for him to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm!”

It was like the fog of confusion Huang Xiaolong experienced dissipated.

The King of Darkness continued, “Even though the Xumi Old Man was at the peak of the late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm, he cultivated a type of secret art that allowed him to obtain the strength of a high-level Sovereign for a short amount of time. He once exchanged blows with Lord Wan Shi, and he was the first person to escape completely unhurt.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He couldn’t help but think about the old man whom he had met in the lower worlds.

“Actually, the main reason behind the Xumi Old Man retreating unhurt was because he possessed the Godly Mt. Xumi. The little cow said. “Even so, there is no need to doubt the Xumi Old Man’s strength.”

After some questioning about the Xumi Old Man, the three of them arrived in the space above the forest close to the Immortal Phoenix Palace.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the scene below him in shock. There was a massive path leading to the Immortal Phoenix Palace, and it seemed to be carved out by a supreme expert!

Huang Xiaolong stared at the little cow in silence.

“Go!” Huang Xiaolong yelled as they charged towards the Immortal Phoenix Palace. As they flew above the forest, they saw the shockingly deep gorge in the ground.

“It has to be a Sovereign Realm expert.” The little cow deduced. “They managed to destroy the Pill Furnace Grand Formation with a single strike!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t speak as a weird light flashed through his eyes. Could it be that other Sovereign Realm experts had their eye on the Immortal Phoenix Palace?

After several dozen breaths of time, they arrived in the space above the Immortal Phoenix Palace.

The sight of ruins and broken structures greeted them.

The Immortal Phoenix Palace that stood tall had long since been reduced to rubble. Half of it was burned beyond recognition, and the other half had turned into a pile of scrap. Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he charged towards the main hall where the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix was sleeping. He could see that the entire hall was destroyed, and the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix was nowhere to be seen.

“There were definitely Sovereign Realm experts who had exchanged blows here. However, they didn’t remain here for long.” the King of Darkness said.

A frown appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

He had never thought that something like that would happen! The more pressing question was where the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix was! Could it be that he was attacked by his enemies and taken away?

Was there a possibility of him escaping?

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow flew around the rubble and couldn’t find anything useful. They could only drop all thoughts of looking for clues as they regrouped with the King of Darkness before leaving.

“The Nine Colored Divine Phoenix should be an expert from the Divine Phoenix World.” The little cow said as they left.

The Divine Phoenix World was a world comparable in strength to the Dragon World.

The King of Darkness continued, “The Divine Phoenix World has always been at odds with the Demon World.”

The little cow shook her head in response. “The people who made a move shouldn’t be from the Demon World. If they came, there would be demonic qi in the air. I would recognize it in an instant.”

“Xiaolong, what are we going to do now?” The King of Darkness asked.

“Let’s go to the Devil Abyss.” Since the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix was nowhere to be found, Huang Xiaolong decided to look for the Ancient Heavenly Court before doing anything else.

“The Devil Abyss?!” The King of Darkness exclaimed in surprise.

Whoever it was, they would definitely feel a sense of fear when anyone mentioned the Devil Abyss.

“Why are we going there?” He couldn’t help but ask Huang Xiaolong.

The little cow glanced at him from the corner of her eye, and said, “We’re going there to look for treasures.”

“Old Ancestor Azure Cow, there are tons of treasures in the Devil Abyss. However, we have to be alive to use them!” The King of Darkness grumbled.

“It’s my idea to head over there.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “In the past, I received the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell. After refining it, I received a trace of memory from the Ancient Heavenly Emperor. From what I know, the Ancient Heavenly Court is somewhere in the Devil Abyss!”
