“Great!” Huang Xiaohai revealed an excited expression as he laughed, “When you arrive, you should tear his head off his neck! We’ll all take turns to pee on it! I’ve long wanted to do something like that...”

Zhang Fu, Zhao Shu, and the others agreed with Huang Xiaohai’s suggestion.

“Haha, that’s right! It’s our turn to f*ck him up!”

“Do we need to set the queue now?”

“I’ll be the first one! Zhao Shu, you’re second. Zhang Fu, you’ll be the third!”

Everyone bantered as they mused about Wangu Wudi’s miserable fate.

For the past one hundred years, all of them had endured all sorts of humiliation. Right now, it was time for them to release all their anger and hatred!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the bunch of grown-ups acting like kids in front of him, and he couldn’t help but turn speechless.

“Big brother, is Senior Ascending Moon alright?” Huang Xiaohai asked out of the blue.

“He’s fine. His condition is stable right now. However, if he wants to return to his peak, it might take some time.” Huang Xiaolong shifted the topic away from the old man, and he continued, “Let’s go. We’ll head over to the Alchemist Grandmaster Union right now.”

“Wait for me...” When they were about to leave, a feeble voice sounded behind them. They turned around only to be greeted with the sight of the Ascending Moon Old Man hobbling out of the secret room.

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock, and he rushed over to support the old man. “Old man, you’re not even recovered!”

A smile appeared on the Ascending Moon Old Man’s face. “With you around, there is no way I’ll die. How can I miss such an exciting show? I really want to see you tear that scoundrel b*stard’s head off. I’m going to be the first to pee on his skull! No one can fight with me for the chance!”

Huang Xiaohai, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu nodded their heads obediently.

Since the Ascending Moon Old Man’s injuries were all healed, he wouldn’t be in danger as long as he didn’t make a move.

In half a minute, Huang Xiaolong brought along everyone as they left the Abundant Deities Manor. They strolled down the street as they made their way to the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

Since the union wasn’t located too far away, they managed to arrive in less than half an hour.

“Big brother, we managed to receive news that Wangu Wudi has gathered the experts of nearly a hundred superpowers. Right now, several hundred thousand experts are rushing over from the nearby galaxies.” Huang Xiaohai reminded Huang Xiaolong in a solemn voice. “I’m afraid there are already several hundred experts who received the summons in Divine Dan City.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the others’ faces sank in an instant.

Over a hundred superpowers!

Even though they knew that Huang Xiaolong was strong, they couldn’t help but feel a little worried. That was over a hundred strongest families and sects they were talking about!

Could Huang Xiaolong really take them all on by himself?

“Little brat Huang, do you think you can deal with them?” The Ascending Moon Old Man asked.

Huang Xiaolong laughed. “God d*mn! So what if there are a hundred superpowers? I’ll f*ck them up all the same!”

Huang Xiaohai and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

The Ascending Moon Old Man burst into laughter. “That’s right! F*ck them up! God d*mn, f*ck them all up!”

When they were about to arrive at the venue, nearly all of the participants had arrived at the critical juncture of their refinement process.

Wangu Wudi controlled countless medicinal herbs as they flew around in the air. They turned into divine beasts in the air, and a total of ten thousand divine beasts were formed in the air when he was done.

“This... this is the Ten Thousand Beasts Refining Diagram!”

“I’ve only heard about it in legends! I never thought that I would be able to witness such a legendary art in my life! In the past, Director Huang had managed to refine a Nine Tribulations Divine Pill with a similar method!”

“The Ten Thousand Beasts Refining Diagram is split into different levels. Lord Wangu Wudi’s technique looks so much more perfect!” Many of the experts who had already thrown their lot in with Wangu Wudi praised him to the high heavens. A sneer appeared on their lips. “How can Huang Xiaolong be compared to Lord Wudi?!”

“That’s right! Lord Wudi is the most talented alchemist in the world!”

Everyone broke out into discussion, and the atmosphere turned lively in an instant.

As everyone watching the competition started to clamor, Wangu Wudi ignored everyone as he continued to refine his pill.

Very quickly, spirit essence started to gather as his pill started to form.

The medicinal fragrance diffused around the plaza, and a heaven shaking rumble came from the sky. In an instant, the sky lost its color.

“It’s the tribulation lightning! Tribulation lightning is here!”

Everyone swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

It is too fast! How could tribulation lightning be drawn out when he had only started to refine his pill?

Before they could react, the tribulation lightning gathered to form a lightning dragon before falling towards Wangu Wudi.

Despite the incoming lightning, Wangu Wudi remained remarkably composed. He opened his mouth, and a wave of sword qi appeared to scatter the tribulation lightning.

However, it didn’t stop there. Tribulation lightning fell until the eighth bolt of lightning was destroyed.

Wangu Wudi used the sword qi to destroy the tribulation lightning with ease. Everyone felt as though they were looking at an undefeatable god as they watchd him.

“Lord Wangu Wudi is unrivaled! He has to be stronger than a First Order Heavenly God!” The Family Head of the Leng Family yelled in shock.

Finally, the ninth bolt of tribulation lightning fell.

Instead of sending out his sword qi, he simply raised his hand to swipe at the lightning dragon. It exploded in mid-air, like beautiful fireworks.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath in shock.

“Great!”

The Leng Family Head jumped and started clapping.

When he started, everyone snapped back to attention and mirrored his actions.

Just as they were waiting for Wangu Wudi to deal with the tenth bolt of lightning, he stopped. Mesmerizing medicinal fragrance assaulted the noses of everyone present, and a pillar of light shot to the skies. Several divine pills appeared in mid-air.

Nine Tribulation Divine Pills!”

When they saw the pills that had appeared, they knew that the first place would belong to Wangu Wudi without a doubt.

The moment Wangu Wudi completed his pills, Huang Xiaolong, and the others saw the sea of people standing in the plaza.

Cheers rang out from the crowd again and again.

Before Huang Xiaolong could lead everyone into the plaza, a disciple of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union flew over and stopped them.

“Lord Wangu Wudi has ordered that no members of the Huang Family are allowed to enter a thousand meters of the union!” One of the lead disciples sneered at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Family Head, you better head back.”

Since the Huang Family was about to be finished, he felt that there was no need for him to be polite to Huang Xiaohai.

A trace of rage flashed through the eyes of Huang Xiaohai and the others.

Huang Xiaolong reached out with his arm, and a terrifying wave of suction force smashed into the lead disciple. He appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

“Are you sure we can’t go in?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were cold as he asked.

Huang Xiaolong was still the director of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. He hadn’t passed down the position to anyone just yet.

How dare Wangu Wudi pass down an order to block the current director from entering a thousand-meter radius of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union?!

When the lead disciple looked into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, a trace of fear flashed through his eyes. However, it disappeared when he thought about Wangu Wudi. He laughed sinisterly, “No one dares to go against Lord Wudi. If you enter, we’ll kill you regardless of your identity.”
