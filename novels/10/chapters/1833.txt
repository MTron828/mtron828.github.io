When Huang Xiaolong and Gao Changran left the Six Nether Gate headquarters, none of the grand elders or elders knew of their departure.

The medicine market was located in the Six Nether City’s central zone, and it wasn’t too far away from the Six Nether Gate Headquarters.

With their speed, the two of them quickly arrived at the medicine market.

When they arrived, Wu Jingnan, the young master of the Devil Ape Cult, was still strolling around with the Devil Ape Cult’s experts. He wanted to see if there were any rare medicinal herbs worth buying, but it seemed like he had found the market disappointing.

“All the spiritual pills and herbs sold in the Six Nether City’s medicine market are nothing more than trash. No, correct that, they are worse than trash.” Wu Jingnan shook his head and continued, “If I had known that before coming, I wouldn’t have even bothered.”

Li Tong chuckled as he followed behind him, “Even though Six Nether City belongs to the Six Nether Gate, how can the main city of a small faction be compared to the main city of our Devil Ape Cult? The medicinal ingredients and spiritual pills sold in our cities are of a much higher grade compared to this trash.”

Tian Changyue laughed as well. “Oh right, speaking of spiritual pills, Young Lady Xing Yinuo is said to be the most talented alchemist in the younger generation. I heard that she has come to Frigid North City as well.”

Xing Yinuo was the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil’s daughter, and he was the top-ranked Archdevil Ancestor in the Devil World! She was considered as one of the three most talented geniuses of her generation.

Rumors had it that the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor had already surpassed the Emperor Realm. He was in charge of the number one superpower in the Devil World, the Heavenly Punishment Sect.

As for the Heavenly Punishment Pavilion, it was set up by the Heavenly Punishment Sect. They had opened up stores in various prominent cities, and it was comparable to the Yin Yang Restaurant in Hell.

“Oh? Young Lady Xing Yinuo came as well?!” Wu Jingnan’s eyes widened, and he exclaimed in pleasant surprise.

She was one of the three supreme geniuses in the Devil World, and she was also one of the four beauties. She had tons of suitors, and Wu Jingnan was one of them.

It could even be said that with a single sentence from Xing Yinuo, countless young masters of various superpowers would willingly give up their lives to please her.

“That’s right. Young Lady Xing is here. She is currently on the Frigid North Continent.” Tian Changyue chuckled. “I heard that the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor would be arriving soon. I also heard that he was shocked when he heard about the news of the two Devil Steles when he left seclusion.”

Li Tong continued, “In the past, the twelve Archdevil Ancestors were unstoppable when they joined hands to sweep across the lands. Their might shook the myriad of worlds! Yellow Springs Archdevil Ancestor, Black Killer Archdevil Ancestor, and Scarlet Jewel Archdevil Ancestor disappeared soon after the disappearance of the Archdevil Lord. Right now, the nine Archdevil Ancestors are no longer of one mind. If they were, how would outsiders from the other worlds dare to infringe on our Devil World to steal the two Devil Steles?!”

It was true. If the nine Archdevil Ancestors banded together, even Shi Ming of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe and Chu Han of the Massacring Gods Gate wouldn’t dare to move rashly.

“Wait for another two days. The moment the Chief and Archdevil Ancestor arrive, we’ll take care of the Six Nether Gate and head for the Eternal Devil Lands.” Wu Jingnan sneered.

He didn’t care if the nine Archdevil Ancestors were of one mind or not. The only thing he cared about was Xing Yinuo.

Ever since he had seen her during his last visit to the Heavenly Punishment Sect, he had fallen in love with her.

“Take care of my Six Nether Gate? You sure know how to talk big!” A cold harrumph broke his train of thoughts.

Everyone was stunned as they stared at the source of the voice. The void started to shake, and Gao Changran of the Six Nether Gate appeared in mid-air. The members of the Devil Ape Cult were surprised when they saw a black-haired young man standing in front of Gao Changran.

Li Tong and Tian Changyue stared at each other and saw the sense of suspicion lurking in each other’s eyes.

It was evident that they were extremely curious about the young man’s identity.

Huang Xiaolong revealed a devil’s mark at the space between his eyebrows, and he emitted shocking amounts of devil qi as he stood in the space before them.

Wu Jingnan stared at Gao Changran, and he laughed coldly. “Oh, look who it is! It’s Chief Gao! What? Are you here to take revenge for your disciples? Do you think an Eighth Order Emperor Realm cultivator like you will be able to do as you wish?”

Even though Gao Changran was at the early-Eighth Order Emperor Realm, Li Tong and Tian Changyue were both Ninth Order Emperors. In fact, Li Tong was at the mid-Ninth Order Emperor Realm, and Tian Changyue was at the late-Ninth Order Emperor Realm! As for the several other ancestors standing around him, they were all experts in the Seventh Order Emperor Realm.

As for Huang Xiaolong, Wu Jingnan could see that he was a mere Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch.

Gao Changran growled in a low voice, “Wu Jingnan, do you really think that my Six Nether Gate is a pushover?”

Wu Jingnan burst into laughter when he heard what Gao Changran said. “I’m sorry. I really do think so!” He turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong and continued, “Brat, are you here to seek justice for the Six Nether Gate? I’ll give you some precious advice now. Do not interfere with the matters of my Devil Ape Cult. If you drag yourself into this, you might even implicate the power behind you!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It was clear that Huang Xiaolong was the person Gao Changran had found to stick up for him. According to Wu Jingnan, Huang Xiaolong was a young master of some superpower somewhere in the Devil World.

Of course, he didn’t care about Huang Xiaolong’s so-called status in the Devil World. In the eyes of the Devil Ape Cult, there was no need to show respect to any other powers.

He could identify the young masters of the top ten superpowers in the Devil World, and he was sure that Huang Xiaolong was not one of them.

Huang Xiaolong ignored him and said with indifference, “You’re looking too highly upon yourself. A mere Devil Ape Cult isn’t enough for me to lower my head. I don’t need to explain myself to you.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, Wu Jingnan stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. However, rage overcame him in the next moment. “Brat, you’re looking to die!”

Li Tong frowned, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong. “Who are you? You better stop behaving so arrogantly before us...”

He had never seen anyone who dared to show such disrespect to the Devil Ape Cult before.

As the fifth-ranked superpower in the Devil World, the Devil Ape Cult wasn’t one to be trifled with. Even though their backer, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, ranked sixth among the twelve Archdevil Ancestors, he was still a peak-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert.

Right now, the black-haired young man before them was blatantly looking down on them.

Not to mention that the black-haired young man before them was a mere Heavenly Monarch!

If not for suspecting Huang Xiaolong’s identity, Li Tong would have already killed him for disrespecting the Devil Ape Cult.

“You don’t need to know who I am.” Huang Xiaolong said. “I’m here today to seek justice for the disciples of the Six Nether Gate. Hand over all the disciples who made a move against our disciples right now. The Six Nether Gate will take care of them for you. All of you should just apologize on the city gate of Six Nether City after you do that, and we’ll call it a day.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t wish to clash with any superpowers if there was no need for it.

Wu Jingnan, Li Tong, Tian Changyue, and the others felt their vision spinning. They didn’t dare to believe their ears. What did he just say? Hand over our disciples to the Six Nether Gate and apologize in public?!

Wu Jingnan started to chuckle, and it escalated to roaring laughter that resounded through the air.

Li Tong, Tian Changyue, and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong with a frigid expression on their faces, and a chilly light flashed through their eyes.
