“Sect Chief, you mean Huang Xiaolong’s strength is comparable to the Heavenly Prince Di Jing?!” The True Divinity Sect’s Ancestor’s voice was stuttering badly, and he was unable to make himself sound calm no matter what.

“... Not possible, right? Impossible! Even if Huang Xiaolong really has two king of supreme godheads, he can’t achieve the same level of cultivation as the Heavenly Prince Di Jing in less than a thousand years!” Another True Divinity Sect’s Ancestor blurted in denial.

But he had barely finished speaking when the remaining words stuck in his throat.

If that is impossible for Huang Xiaolong to achieve with his two king of supreme godheads, then what if he has...?!

The Ancestor did not dare to venture down this line of thought.

The same idea occurred to the rest of the True Divinity Sect’s group, and their faces actually paled a little.

“In truth, even if Huang Xiaolong snatches first place in the preliminary round, it doesn’t mean he has the same level of strength as the Heavenly Prince Di Jing.” A moment later, the True Divinity Sect Chief Wang Haojun suppressed the shock in his heart and said, “Then again, even if he doesn’t have the same level of strength as the Heavenly Prince Di Jing, it is certain his strength is not weaker than the Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan and Brightness Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong’s strength.”

The rest of the True Divinity Sect nodded their heads in agreement with Wang Haojun’s opinion.

Indeed, the preliminary trial was to kill Heavenly Demons, devils, and others to accumulate points. Rankings were determined based on the number of points. Even though higher points reflected one’s strength, the person with the highest points was not necessarily the strongest.

Perhaps, the Heavenly Prince Di Jing was still concealing his real strength inside the Heavenly Court Secret Region. Or maybe, Huang Xiaolong had resorted to some kind of secret ancient technique that enabled him to find his prey in the shortest time, which increased his hunting efficiency.

“No wonder Huang Xiaolong has the confidence to bet forty million on himself for winning first place. Everyone mocked him as retarded, but now, no one would dare to think so.” One of the True Divinity Sect’s Ancestors sighed. “Then again, in the last round of stage battles, Huang Xiaolong will be no match against the Heavenly Prince Di Jing.”

While the crowd at the plaza was fervently discussing Huang Xiaolong, the Radiance Divine Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand emitted a burst of glaring white light that condensed into a beam that shot forward like lightning. In a split second, the white light beam pierced through the eyebrows of a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Heavenly Demon up ahead.

A ray of light flew out from the Heavenly Demon’s body, and the points on Huang Xiaolong’s jade plate continued to rise. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

His points broke into the one million range!

Right at this time, Heavenly Prince Di Jing, who was pushed down to a second place by Huang Xiaolong, regained the first place as 6,000 points were added to this name.

Di Jing’s 6,000 points more than covered the 2,000 points gap between him and Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong sneered in a carefree manner. It seemed like he had given Di Jing some pressure, and he was about to exert some efforts.

Had he killed six Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Heavenly Demons simultaneously?

Huang Xiaolong waved out the Radiance Divine Scepter in his hand. Alarming radiance light godforce shot out from its moon-shaped blade and separated into a swarm of radiance lightning dragons.

Heavenly Demons, metal beasts, and even devils were pierced by these radiance lightning dragons one after another in the distance.

Heavenly Demons, metal beasts, and devils fell like dominos, purified by the radiance light energy from the divine scepter, and disappeared from the world.

Huang Xiaolong’s points soared once again, regaining the top spot.

The pattern continued, Huang Xiaolong and the Heavenly Prince Di Jing consistently switched ranks back and forth as the trial progressed.

More often than not, Di Jing was suppressed in second place by Huang Xiaolong even though he managed to recapture the position from time to time.

.....

As time passed, nightfall arrived.

After a day of hunting, the Heavenly Court Secret Region’s air smelled of the rusty scent of blood. There was despair, sorrow, and death in the atmosphere.

The jade mirror, high in the air, above the plaza showed the various changes continuously—some participants’ rankings fell, while others’ rankings rose. Some participants’ names disappeared completely from the rankings boards.

When a name disappeared from the rankings board, it represented death. The person had fallen.

Even though it was only the first day of trial, numerous names had disappeared from the rankings board.

Disciples in the top one hundred thousand were all geniuses cultivated by various forces using many resources, so every disciple’s loss pained these forces. Hence, woeful cries and laments could be heard across the plaza quite frequently.

......

Under the silver moonlit sky, Huang Xiaolong sped across several mountain peaks.

However, one could not see the moon inside the Heavenly Court Secret Region, only the ethereal slivers of cold moonlight, pulling one into a dreamy state.

Heavenly Demons tumbled to the ground as the Radiance Divine Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand slaughtered in the night. The silver moonlight added a strange charm to the scarlet blood on the ground.

Huang Xiaolong opened the Eye of Hell.

In the darkness, his Eye of Hell could see even further.

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. Through a stretch of mountains, he spotted flickering flames inside a cave.

Fire? Other participating disciples!

Although a day had passed, this was the first time Huang Xiaolong encountered another disciple.

Immediately, Huang Xiaolong accelerated towards the valley where the fire was burning, while killing the Heavenly Demons and metal beasts on his way.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to reach the valley.

In the valley, several disciples were sitting around a bonfire. There were disciples from the Brightness Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, and also the Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace.

The Solitude Emperor Palace’s Gudu Canyang was among them.

Gudu Canyang was laughing as he said, “Today, I had good luck. I killed six Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples.”

One of the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples, a middle-aged man with outstanding air, laughed as well. “According to the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s bounty, one thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones will be rewarded for killing one Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple. Six means six thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. When we go out, Solitude Emperor’s Disciple should treat us to a meal.”

This middle-aged man was called Sun Fei, and his strength was in the top five among the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples participating in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. He was a late-Third Order Heavenly Monarch. Sun Fei was currently ranked sixteenth on the rankings board.

Gudu Canyang laughed happily as he said, “No problem, we’ll work harder again tomorrow, and kill a few more Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples. The Fortune Emperor Palace has sent a thousand disciples, so if we kill a few hundred of them, we will get several hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. Pity that we didn’t encounter Peng Xiao or that Huang Xiaolong. Killing Peng Xiao is worth one million low-grade chaos spirit stones! Moreover, I’ve heard that Peng Xiao has the Purple Phoenix Physique, so it would be a great supplement if we can get her yin essence!”

“Moreover, killing Huang Xiaolong is worth five million low-grade chaos spirit stones!”

The White Dragon Emperor’s Disciple, Chen Zhuang, from the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace hesitated, “Brother Canyang, Huang Xiaolong is currently battling for the first place with the Heavenly Prince Di Jing. I’m afraid his strength greatly exceeds our assumption.”

Gudu Canyang sneered disdainfully. “Do you guys think that the dog-fart of Huang Xiaolong could really compete with the Heavenly Prince Di Jing? I don’t believe it, and I won’t believe it. How could a brat that has less than a thousand cultivation years have that strength? I really wish I encounter that brat right now!” Greed burned in his eyes as he spoke.

It was an open secret that Huang Xiaolong carried a peerless treasure.

“Is that so?” Just as Gudu Canyang finished speaking, an indifferent voice sounded in everyone’s ears.

“Who?!” Everyone was alarmed and quickly got to their feet.

Then they saw a figure walking towards them from a short distance.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong!” Gudu Canyang, Sun Fei, Chen Zhuang, and the others paled, seeing who it was.

In the next moment, Gudu Canyang let out delighted laughter as he said, “Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would deliver yourself to our doorsteps. This is great! Truly great! You have saved me the trouble of searching for you high and low.”
