Though it was now certain that he could control the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation, Huang Xiaolong did not jump into refining the Netherworld King’s Jade recklessly. Instead, he familiarized himself with the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s power.

As Huang Xiaolong continued to familiarize himself with controlling the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation, streaks of golden dragon lightning buzzed as they rotated around over his two arms.

Though these streaks of lightning were only slightly thicker than a thread, Huang Xiaolong could sense the terrifying destructive power within them.

Huang Xiaolong casually pointed his finger, and a streak of lightning shot out, passing through the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s wall to outer space. And in the far distance, a small hole appeared in space.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely astonished by this result.

‘The Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s attack is so damn powerful!’

Even a mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm master’s attack would fail to execute this much degree of attack power.

With a wave, Huang Xiaolong merged the lightning streaks winding around his arms into a lightning beam, and shot it into the distant space.

Rumble—!

Far away, a hole appeared in space with violent hurricanes sweeping out in all directions.

Huang Xiaolong has once again astounded.

...

An hour later...

As Huang Xiaolong became more apt in controlling the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s power, his attacks with the golden dragon lightning qi power grew more powerful and lethal.

Huang Xiaolong felt at ease and confident in controlling the golden dragon lightning qi’s power half a day later. With that he turned his attention to the Netherworld King’s Jade.

Finally, it was time to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade!

Huang Xiaolong made an effort to calm his excited emotions and gradually entered an ethereal state. Subsequently, his three supreme godheads’ godforce flowed into the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation. Streaks of golden dragon lightning qi appeared on the surface of his skin and landed onto the netherworld King’s Jade.

The instant the golden dragon lightning qi came in contact with the Netherworld King’s Jade, a burst of black light surged out from the jade token. This black light condensed into a darkness archdevil sitting in cross-legged posture, hovering above the Netherworld King’s Jade. Darkness element energy roiled around the surreal archdevil, seemingly blocking the golden dragon lightning qi’s entry.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised watching this. This darkness archdevil was probably the first restrictive formation of the Netherworld King’s Jade!

Huang Xiaolong continued to channel his three supreme godheads’ godforce into the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation, enhancing the flow of golden dragon lightning qi into the Netherworld King’s Jade.

Moments later, the golden dragon lightning qi formed a sea of golden dragon lightning qi around the darkness archdevil, which was roiling angrily.

One hour passed, two hours passed.... Half a day passed...

With its constant attacks, the Golden dragon lightning Qi finally began to chip away the darkness element energy around the archdevil, and disappeared entirely within three days. The archdevil submerged within the sea of golden dragon lightning qi, disintegrating inside it.

However, it consumed too much godforce to activate the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation, and it was exhausting even though Huang Xiaolong had broken through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, and had three supreme godheads.

Everytime Huang Xiaolong felt his godforce was not going to hold on any longer, he dropped a thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills into the Golden Dragon Lighting Pool’s core formation, turning them into robust medicinal energies in an instant to replenish his three supreme godheads.

A month later, after exhausting over twenty thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills, the darkness archdevil was finally vanquished. There was nothing blocking the golden dragon lightning qi from entering the Netherworld King’s Jade anymore.

But a radiant black light was flickering unsteadily from the Netherworld King’s Jade.

Suddenly, a violent and overwhelming darkness element energy swept out from the Netherworld King’s Jade, like a volcanic eruption that was aiming to drown Huang Xiaolong.

Although Huang Xiaolong was prepared, this darkness element energy was too overbearing as it rushed in and took over every corner of his body. Due to the darkness element energy, the four divine fires’ spirits within Huang Xiaolong’s internal organs seemingly fell into a slumber, and the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell’s silvery radiance dimmed.

Rumble!

The moment the darkness element energy drowned his three supreme godheads, Huang Xiaolong started feeling like he was suffocating in hell.

His surroundings were filled with blinding darkness and an intense scent of blood.

There was no sky above, and no earth under his feet. There was nothing in front of him or behind him.

Moreover, there was an erosive power hidden within the permeating blood scent and the darkness that had begun devouring Huang Xiaolong’s soul.

Solid as Huang Xiaolong’s soul was, it was weakening under this erosion. In less than a day’s time, his soul’s fire was akin to a candle burning at its end.

If his soul’s fire would get extinguished, then Huang Xiaolong would fall into a slumber for eternity, and waste away to his death.

When Huang Xiaolong’s soul’s fire was about to go out, there was a flickering light from Archdevil Supreme Godhead. The light grew brighter and stronger, and as the light intensified, Huang Xiaolong’s feeble soul’s fire became stable, brighter and stronger.

Huang Xiaolong’s soul’s fire lit up the surrounding darkness—it started with ten meters, a hundred meters, a thousand meters, ten thousand meters, and lastly, every corner of this piece of hell was lit up!

Suddenly, the space where Huang Xiaolong was trapped was filled with rumbling noises, as his soul started integrating with this piece of hell.

At the same time, the surrounding darkness element energy also started merging with his three supreme godheads.

The days flowed by.

A long time later, Huang Xiaolong awakened and opened his eyes and discovered that he was still inside the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s cultivation room number one. The Netherworld King’s Jade hovered in front of him, emitting a soft halo.

But, he...!

When Huang Xiaolong checked his internal situation, he was frightened—the late Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm!

This! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

His cultivation had actually advanced several orders consecutively until the late-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm!

Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic, as he hadn’t expected to break through to the late-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm by merely refining the Netherworld King’s Jade first level restrictions and obtaining the darkness element energy!

But cold sweat dampened Huang Xiaolong’s back as he remembered the feeling of drowning in endless darkness. If it wasn’t for his supreme darkness element godhead, his soul would have died, and there would have been nothing left, but an empty shell!

‘I wonder how long has passed?’ Huang Xiaolong wondered as he put away the Netherworld King’s Jade into his body. He exited the cultivation room and asked Xiang Xun. Five years had passed since he had entered the cultivation room!

Five years! Huang Xiaolong sighed in relief.

Fortunately.

Huang Xiaolong immediately ordered the Dragon Shark Flying Ship back to the Fortune Gate. He was planning to resolve the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body, before attempting to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade’s second restriction.

He was confident that his current late-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm’s strength was enough to do so.

There were twelve years left until the Fortune Gate headquarters’ recruitment deadline, therefore, there was enough time for him to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade’s second restriction.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong was back at the Fortune Gate and met up with Li Lu. Her eyes shone with anticipation when Huang Xiaolong told her that he was going to resolve the evil spirit inside her body. “Xiaolong, have you already broken through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm?”
