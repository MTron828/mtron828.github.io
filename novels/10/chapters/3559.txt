Chapter 3560 – Exterminated?

Jiang Hong snorted in contempt, “Xuan Hong, who do you think you are to ask me to surrender to the Creation Palace? You’re overestimating yourself!” He turned to looked at Chen Yizhen and he sneered, “Chen Yizhen, you despicable b*stard! You went against our agreement!”

In the past, the Eternal Heaven Alliance and the Solitary Alliance made a pact to defend each other in case anyone came under attack. Now, Chen Yizhen was leading the Eternal Heaven Alliance to attack alongside the Creation Palace! It wasn’t a stretch for Jiang Hong to yell at him.

When Chen Yizhen heard what Jiang Hong said, a trace of rage filled his heart. His expression sank and he growled, “Jiang Hong, the winners will always be king! Today, we’re the winners, and you're the losers! In the future, we’ll make the rules!”

“I’ll give you one last chance to surrender.”

Chen Yizhen locked on to Jiang Hong.

Turning around, Jiang Hong rallied the experts of the Solitary Alliance. “Brothers, today, we’ll fight till the last man standing!”

“To the death!”

The experts of the Solitary Alliance roared in unison..

“Alright, go to hell then.” Xuan Hong snorted and he lunged towards Jiang Hong. Chen Yizhen did the same, and they summoned their creation artifacts. They discussed the battle plan before. As soon as they destroyed the grand formation around the Solitary Alliance, they would take Jiang Hong down immediately. They wouldn’t give him a chance to escape!

The battle erupted instantly. Yells filled the skies as space itself was torn apart.

There were close to six hundred Gods of Creation involved in the battle, and the shockwaves of the battle were enough to cause the universe to shake!

Countless creeds contained in the Solitary Alliance were turned to dust immediately, and the number of deaths was uncountable! The grand armies formed in the various celestial empires were vaporized before they could react.

Even though the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance outnumbered the Solitary Alliance by more than two times, they were unable to end the battle immediately. After all, Huang Xiaolong took away a huge part of their strength!

Three hours later… Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xuan Hong glared at Jiang Hong whose body was stained with blood. After three hours of grueling battle, Jiang Hong was in a sorry shape. His chest had a gaping hole, and there were wounds all around his body.

“Jiang Hong, do you regret it now?” Xuan Hong gloated, “From today onwards, the Solitary Alliance will no longer exist!” Pointing to his surroundings, he continued, “Look at what you’ve done. Because of your decision, all of them were forced to die!”

Jiang Hong looked around and he saw the sorry state of everyone on his side. There were some who lost their eye, and others lost their limbs. There were even some of them who only had half their bodies left!

A sigh escaped Jiang Hong’s lips.

“Why are we wasting our breath on him?” Chen Yizhen sneered as his creation artifact slashed towards Jiang Hong. It was the weapon that caused the wound on Jiang Hong’s chest.

Right before Jiang Hong could avoid the attack, Xuan Hong waved his arm and rays of light descended from the void to trap him in place.

As Chen Yizhen’s weapon was about to stab straight through Jiang Hong’s body again, the universe trembled as an uncountable number of silvery dragons swatted the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance away.

The largest of the two dragons shot towards Xuan Hong and Chen Yizhen. In a state of panic, the two of them directed their attacks away from Jiang Hong.

Bang!

As their arms went numb, they were sent tumbling through the air. Looking at the source of the attack, they discovered that the silver dragons that struck them were actually branches that glowed softly with starlight.

The top-grade creation artifacts in their hands were unable to leave a single scratch on it!

This…

Jiang Hong and the experts of the Solitary Alliance were shocked.

The silver dragons that appeared earlier disappeared all of a sudden, and a figure took their place.

Everyone who saw the newcomer gasped in fright.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Jiang Hong, Chen Yizhen, and the others were flabbergasted.

In the blink of an eye, he arrived before them.

“Huang Xiaolong, you finally decided to show yourself! Where’s my second brother?!” Xuan Hong roared. “Was that the Star Dragon Divine Tree?!”

Even though he only revealed the branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Xuan Hong was a half step Universe God. He recognized it instantly.

The experts of the Creation Palace widened their eyes in shock.

“You’re right. That was the Star Dragon Divine Tree. As for your second brother…” Huang Xiaolong released the restriction on the Sun Moon Furnace for them to peer inside, and they saw Kai Dong suppressed within.

“Second Brother!” Xuan Hong roared and he charged at Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to retrieve the furnace. However, he was sent flying from a single punch by Huang Xiaolong.

As he spun through the air, he vomited mouthfuls of blood.

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, including Jiang Hong and Chen Yizhen.

Even though he used the Star Dragon Divine Tree earlier, no one saw him controlling it. They thought that it was controlled by a hidden expert on Huang Xiaolong’s side. When they saw how easily Huang Xiaolong dealt with Xuan Hong, they felt as though an explosion went off in their heads.

A half step Universe God was defeated by a God of Creation at the large completion stage!

None of them could believe their eyes!

Xuan Hong was similarly stunned. He wiped the blood off his lips and he turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong in confusion.

“Are you surprised?” Huang Xiaolong muttered before walking towards the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance.

Xuan Hong retreated subconsciously.

“Go!” Xuan Hong barked out an order, and everyone snapped back to reality. They charged at Huang Xiaolong at once.

The moment they did, a terrifying wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Starlight fell from the void to surround them.

A punch landed on the chest of the expert nearest to him and emerged from the man’s back, destroying his physical body instantly.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. With another punch, he shattered the skull of another expert.
