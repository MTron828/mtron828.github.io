Chapter 2589: Calvary!

“As you wish.” Huang Xiaolong’s figure started to blur as he appeared before Li Yapeng. A punch shot at Li Yapeng’s chest with incredible speed.

Unable to release any special moves, Li Yapeng raised his fist hastily to meet Huang Xiaolong’s attack. As a late-Sixth Heaven True Saint, he was no weakling. Even a punch from him could cause the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds to shake. The power contained in his fist was God knew how many times stronger than the azure dragon released by the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor a moment ago.

However, it was useless as his opponent was Huang Xiaolong! With the sound of bones shattering, Li Yapeng’s flesh exploded, and bone shards filled the air.

Following that, Huang Xiaolong’s fist punched through Li Yapeng’s chest as it emerged from his back.

A miserable shriek filled the air.

Xiao Shan, and Lin Cong were shocked when they noticed what had happened to their comrade. The thousands of guards, who had come along, didn’t believe their eyes either and neither did the disciples in the crowd. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Lord… Lord Li Yapeng!” Liu Jun screamed.

Li Yapeng was the strongest of the enforcers in the Dissociation Domain, and there were only two people stronger than him! One of them was the domain lord, and the other was the vice domain lord!

Li Yapeng was like a God to everyone present. Even people like the holy emperors felt that Li Yapeng was an unbeatable existence! However, someone from the human race punched a hole through his chest with a single move!

The world seemed to crumble around them as they questioned the meaning of life.

After pulling back his arm, Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab Li Yapeng’s head once again.

Xiao Shan and the others raged when they saw what happened.

“Release Brother Li right now! If you refuse, you won’t be able to leave the Dissociation Domain alive!” Xiao Shan screamed, “We have trillions of troops ready to wage war on you as soon as you make the wrong move! The Domain Lord is a late-Seventh Heaven True Saint! If you dare to go against us…”

Before Xiao Shan could finish his sentence, he was sent flying with a punch from Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Xiao Shan was also an enforcer, he was only at the same level as the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor.

Like the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, Xiao Shan was sent crashi+ng into one of the distant mountain ranges.

“An army? Late-Seventh Heaven True Saint?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled under his breath. In his eyes, they were nothing more than ants.

As for Lin Cong, he gave up threatening Huang Xiaolong when he saw what had happened to Xiao Shan.

Like what he had done with those he had killed, Huang Xiaolong devoured Li Yapeng.

Right now, his goal was to push his saint attributes into the top ten ranks. Devouring the holy souls of those he killed would be extremely effective.

By the time Huang Xiaolong was done dealing with the enforcers, the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor was dragged out from the debris by Princess Qing Ying and Chen Shen.

After seeing how Huang Xiaolong devoured Li Yapeng and hearing the miserable cries of the strongest enforcer ringing in his ears, the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor’s expression changed.

It was worse for Princess Qing Ying as a trace of terror appeared on her face.

“He… He…” Her voice trembled, and she wanted to speak out about how Huang XIaolong had killed Lord Li Yapeng of the Dissociation Domain. She knew that any infraction against the Dissociation Domain meant that one’s entire race would be exterminated, but no matter how hard she tried, the words couldn’t leave her lips.

Even though the other person was from the human race, she didn’t dare to speak out against his ‘evil deeds!’

After turning to stare at Lin Cong, Huang Xiaolong realized that he had already called for backup. However, a smile formed on his face. There was no need for Huang Xiaolong to stop him. Even without using his brain, Huang Xiaolong knew that Lin Cong was trying to tell the Domain Lord about everything that had happened. It was too bad for the other party that Huang Xiaolong had already blocked off the outside world with his Darkness Holy Ring.

After seeing how Huang Xiaolong was approaching him, Lin Cong quickly kept away his transmission symbol.

“You should leave a way out for yourself. Even if you kill me now, it’s of no use. I have to admit that you’re strong, but do you really think that you can go against the entire alien race?” Lin Cong suppressed the fear in his heart as he tried to reason with Huang Xiaolong.

“There’s no need for you to worry about this.” Huang Xiaolong’s expression was placid as he continued, “I’ll give you the chance to make a choice now. Do you surrender, or do you wish to suffer the same fate as Li Yapeng?”

Lin Cong’s expression faltered for a second, but an outline of a plan formed in his mind. “Fine! I agree to submit!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart. How could he not know what Lin Cong was planning?

“Alright. Remove the defenses around your holy soul this instant,” Huang Xiaolong commanded.

“Now?!” Lin Cong’s expression changed once again.

…

Half a day passed in the blink of an eye and other than Lin Yapeng who had died, everyone submitted to Huang Xiaolong. As for the guards, who refused to submit, they were killed by Huang Xiaolong.

As for Princess Qing Ying, she couldn’t put up any resistance after seeing that her father had surrendered.

Liu Jun and the other holy princes were no exception.

…

Night fell and Xiao Shan made a report to Huang Xiaolong in the main hall of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

“Master, Li Yapeng’s death might have already alerted the Domain Lord. He might bring over the army soon.”

“It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand nonchalantly. The Domain Lord was only a late-Seventh Heaven True Saint, and no matter how many cultivators he led over, it was useless. Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to hide the matter anyway.

Of course, now that the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds had been locked down by Huang Xiaolong, the Domain Lord would only know that Li Yapeng was dead. He wouldn’t be able to learn of anything that happened in the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

If he really led his troops over, he would save a lot of time for Huang Xiaolong!

The biggest problem wasn’t the Domain Lord! Instead, it was the Zi Dongping!

No matter how seriously injured he was, he was still a Primal Ancestor! Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to underestimate him, and he planned to take all sorts of precautions before engaging Zi Dongping in battle!

From what he had learned from the deputy patriarch and the grand hall master of the Purple Spider Race, Zi Dongping was currently in his hibernation state. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that the commotion he caused in the past two days would alert the Primal Ancestor.

Slowly sending the members of the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds away, Huang Xiaolong prepared for the battle with Zi Dongping. Whatever the case, the other party was a Primal Ancestor. If the battle broke out, the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds would be reduced to nothingness!

Of course, evacuating the entire holy ground was out of the question. Huang Xiaolong tried his best to preserve everything of value, and he gave up on the useless aspects.

When everything was ready, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and he activated the formations on it with his Dao Heart. In an instant, the Hong Zhen Holy Gate was trapped in the Cangqiong World created by the grand formation. Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo continued to strengthen the restrictions in the Cangqiong World as he prepared for an intense battle.

As Huang Xiaolong got ready for the battle between Zi Dongping, a giant army had gathered and they charged towards the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds with Domain Lord with You shi+heng as their commander.
