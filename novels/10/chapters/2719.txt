Chapter 2720: Yin Ming’s Whereabouts

Qiao Jinyang, who was about to accept his fate, caught sight of the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace standing beside Xue Lingyun, and an idea formed in his head. Without a second thought, he pounced at them.

Everything happened too quickly, and no one thought that Qiao Jinyang would move against the three True Saints all of a sudden.

A sinister thought flashed through Qiao Jinyang’s mind. Since he had to die, he would bring several others down with him! He knew how important Lin Xiaoying was to Huang Xiaolong, and he decided to end her life in order to make him live in misery!

It was too bad as a spear pierced through his head the moment he moved. As the spear entered from the back of his head and emerged from the space between his eyebrows, Qiao Jinyang’s body froze.

Turning around with all his might, he saw that the Flying Heaven Spear in Huang Xiaolong’s hands was no longer in his hand.

“You… You… You made an oath!” He thought about what Huang Xiaolong had promised before leaving the Holy World.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips all of a sudden. “You seem to have forgotten that you made an oath too.”

Since Qiao Jinyang broke his promise, the oath no longer had any effect.

Reaching over to pull the Flying Heaven Spear out of Qiao Jinyang’s head, Huang Xiaolong waved the Cangqiong Blade and added another skull onto the Flying Heaven Spear.

Along with Chi Dao, He Yi, Liu Wuji, and Cao Nan, Qiao Jinyang’s skull was added to Huang Xiaolong’s achievements!

Seeing as how their palace master was slain by Huang Xiaolong, the experts of the Devil Palace could no longer control their emotions. The weaker-willed ones started to wet their pants while Gu Tian screamed his lungs out.

The temperature around them dropped as fear gripped their hearts.

Qiao Jinyang’s sudden movement had caused the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace endless amounts of shock, and after they saw that Qiao Jinyang was slain by Huang Xiaolong with a single strike, Lin Xiaoying could no longer contain her emotions. She rushed towards Huang Xiaolong and bawled her eyes out while embracing him in a bear hug.

The Heavenly Master and the others stared at the heartwarming scene as the corners of their lips slowly curled upwards.

Holding the Flying Heaven Spear in one hand that had five heads hanging from it, Huang Xiaolong felt weird as he held Lin Xiaoying in his other hand as she cried her hearts out.

Several moments later, Lin Xiaoying finally calmed down and realized that everyone was staring at her. She retreated hastily and a bashful expression appeared on her face.

Soon after, Huang Xioalong’s gaze landed on Gu Tian and the experts who used to be from the Holy World.

Getting to their knees instantly, everyone started to beg for mercy.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong didn’t spare Gu Tian of the Devil Palace and his head hung low on the Flying Heaven Spear.

As for the other experts who betrayed their organizations, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to deal with them and he handed them over to the Heavenly Master and the others for punishment.

Eventually, all of them would be punished according to the rules of their factions.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As blood sprayed across the skies, Tyrant Chu, Xue Lingyun, Mo Cangli, and the others didn’t show any mercy as they executed the traitors.

Even though they only killed those who had submitted to the three high-level Primal Ancestors willingly, it took them quite some time to slay them all.

As for those who had no choice, they would be punished according to the sins they had committed.

Huang Xiaolong headed back to the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds with the Heavenly Master and the others.

Even though Chi Dao and the other two had caused no small amount of destruction to the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, they had done some renovation works when they were in power. As such, the overall look of the area was maintained. The only place that was left in ruins was the Blue Dragon Manor, and when Huang Xiaolong saw the rubble, he thought of Di Huai and the others as the killing intent in his heart raged.

He might have decapitated all of them, but they were not dead. After all, Huang Xiaolong was unable to truly kill a Primal Ancestor. Of course, that also meant that he had tons of time on his hands to torture Chi Dao, Liu Wuji, and He Yi for the mess they had made!

The three of them were destined to live a life worse than death at Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

After they returned, the first thing the Heavenly Master and Tyrant Chu ordered for was the reconstruction of the Blue Dragon Manor. Only when the rebuilding began did they continue to deal with the traitors and the members of the Devil Palace.

This time, they were hell-bent on getting rid of the Devil Palace. In the future, the Devil Palace would no longer be ranked in the superpowers of the Holy World! In fact, they would be wiped off the face of existence and their name would only appear in the history books!

The Holy Heavens, Clear Snow Palace, and Holy Lands Alliance immediately declared that they would join hands to root out every single individual related to the Devil Palace and the great cleansing began.

After several years had passed, the Holy World finally regained its calm.

During the time of the great cleansing, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother going on another adventure, and he entered secluded cultivation in the Divine Tuo Mountain. He started to comprehend the grand dao laws surrounding the mountain. Since he had dealt with everything he needed to in the Cangqiong Holy World, he felt that it was time for him to head over to the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Of course, he didn’t ease up on the search for Yin Ming. With the power of the Blue Dragon Manor in the Holy World, he ordered the Holy Heavens, the Clear Snow Palace, the Holy Lands Alliance, and the various super powers to operate at full power to locate Yin Ming, Elder Ming, and Yuan Baifei. Yin Ming was on top of the list as Huang Xiaolong needed him to deal with the poison in Fei Yanzi’s body.

If the poison in her body wasn’t neutralized, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to head over to the Divine Tuo Holy World in peace.

Throughout the years of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong’s understanding of the grand dao became a little deeper.

One fine day when Huang Xiaolong was cultivating on the Divine Tuo Mountain, the Heavenly Master rushed over in excitement to make a report. “Xiaolong, we have great news! We received reports of Yuan Wanfei’s location!”

They had finally received news on Yuan Wanfei’s hiding spot!

As soon as Huang Xiaolong heard the news, his eyes snapped open, and he inquired about the intelligence they had received. He didn’t hesitate to move out towards Yuan Wanfei’s location.

At that very instant, Yuan Wanifei was located at the northernmost part of the Holy World. He was holed up in a tiny city, and he had disguised himself as an ordinary citizen. It was extremely difficult for anyone to connect him to the mid-level Primal Ancestor he was.

When he discovered that Huang Xiaolong had arrived, fear flashed in his eyes, but he quickly regained his calm. It seemed as though he had expected for the day to arrive.

“Huang Xiaolong, I am extremely regretful,” Yuan Wanfei sighed when looking at Huang Xiaolong.

With a frosty expression, Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel like wasting his breath on Yuan Baifei. “Where’s Yin Ming and Elder Ming?”

Whatever Yuan Wanfei regretted had nothing to do with him. After all, he didn’t plan on solving the other party’s problems.

An anguished expression soon appeared on Yuan Wanfei’s face, and he chuckled in resentment, “They’re gone! They left!”

Left?

Huang Xiaolong stared at Yuan Wanfei in puzzlement.

“They returned to the Divination Creed!” Yuan Wanfei snarled in anger when he thought about how they had left him to die.

“Divination Creed? They returned to the Divine Tuo Holy World?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

Yuan Wanfei was equally as shocked, as he wasn’t expecting Huang Xiaolong to know of the existence of the Divine Tuo Holy World.

“That’s right…” Yuan Wanfei could only chuckle with indignation.

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. If Yin Ming really returned to the Divination Creed, things would get troublesome.

Whatever the case, he had to deal with Yuan Wanfei.

With a wave of his arm, Yuan Wanfei was dragged before him, and he searched through the other party’s memories.

Several moments later, his final ray of hope was shattered.
