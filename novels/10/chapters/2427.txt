Chapter 2428: Ao Zhao Surrenders

Ater hearing that the Yang Dragon Race had sent over a high-level True Saint to the Mirage Pavilion, Chen Zhi and the others sucked in a cold breath. Those who were from the Black Inferno Race were shocked.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong was still calm as he stared indifferently at Ao Zhao, “Kneel before you? Why don’t you crawl over here and slither about like a snake? I might consider letting you live if you do.”

Slither around like a snake?!

Chen Zhi and the others couldn’t help but burst into laughter when they thought about how Ao Zhao would wriggle about the ground.

“You!” Ao Zhao was enraged as he pointed at Huang Xiaolong, “You’re dead! When the high-level True Saint from my Yang Dragon Race arrives, you will be begging for me to end your life!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed as a trace of frost flashed through them, “Since this is the case, then die!”

“Go!”

“Yes, Young Master!”

Chen Zhi and others replied respectfully as they started the activation of the five holy formations. An endless stream of attacks rained down on Ao Zhao and the survivors.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was daring enough to continue his assault, fury filled his heart. “There’s really a high-level True Saint from our Yang Dragon Race waiting for us back at the Mirage Pavilion!”

However, his words were drowned out by the incessant attacks raining down from the skies.

In the face of the second barrage of attacks, Ao Sheng withstood his injuries and attacked Chen Zhi and the others with all his might. Turning to Ao Zhao, he yelled, “Young Master, use the Dragon Saint Rune to escape! Leave now! Return to the Mirage Pavilion!”

As long as Ao Zhao could return to the Mirage Pavilion, no one could harm him.

The Dragon Saint Rune was one of the ancient escape runes, and it was refined through the effort of one of the first generation ancestors of the Yang Dragon Race. One could tear through all formations and restrictions to make their escape.

The rune was also the reason why the high-level True Saint had remained in the Mirage Pavilion. With the rune in Ao Zhao’s hands, there was practically no way harm would befall him.

With an ache in his heart, Ao Zhao circulated his energy and poured it into the Dragon Saint Rune. Rising into the air, he disappeared from where he once stood.

“Brat, you’re dead for sure!”

“Wait for our Yang Dragon Race’s endless revenge!”

Ao Zhao’s voice sounded out from the void.

“I’ll leave it to you guys!” Huang Xiaolong turned to address Chen Zhi and the others before chasing after Ao Zhao.

“Young Master, leave it to us!” The True Saints nodded.

Soaring into the skies, Huang Xiaolong chased after Ao Zhao. Even though Ao Sheng and the others weren’t weaklings, they had already been seriously injured by their previous sneak attack. It was entirely possible for Chen Zhi and the others to hold them down with the help of the profound beasts.

One hour later...

As Ao Zhao fell from the skies and vomited mouthfuls of fresh blood, he quickly retrieved a medicinal pill and threw it into his mouth.

“Brat, you better pray that I wouldn’t find out which faction you come from!” Ao Zhao roared furiously.

“So what if you do?” A voice suddenly rang out behind him.

Ao Zhao’s face turned pale as he snapped and turned his head around to stare at Huang Xiaolong, who was standing directly behind him. “You! How... How are you here?!” They were currently quite a distance away from the Devil Fetus Mountain Range, and not even a True Saint Realm expert would be able to catch up to him after he used his Dragon Saint Rune.

Never in his wildest imagination would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong had the abilities to catch up to him.

“If you have a Dragon Saint Rune, why can’t I have one too?” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

The blood drained from Ao Zhao’s face, but he soon burst out laughing. Staring all around Huang Xiaolong, he sneered, “Brat, the rune can only transport a single person. Are you stupid? How dare you chase after me alone...? Did you forget that you’re just a Second Tribulation half-True Saint? No matter how heavily injured I am right now, you’re just a bug I can kill whenever I want!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly, and he shook his head while looking at Ao Zhao.

“Die!” Ao Zhao stabbed the spear in his hands towards Huang Xiaolong when he saw the look of mockery in his eyes.

Too lazy to mess with Ao Zhao any longer, Huang Xiaolong summoned his dragon-attributed holy soul. As the phantom appeared in the skies, it slapped Ao Zhao and smashed the spear in his hands into pieces.

He then dragged the half-dead Ao Zhao in front of him.

“How... How is this possible?!” Ao Zhao’s aura was extremely weak as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul with terror in his eyes. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I have already killed Zhan Bo and the others,” Huang Xiaolong confessed.

Ao Zhao’s body started to tremble after he heard what Huang Xiaolong said, “What? You?! Then... Sun Jiang and Li Huajun, they...?!”

“They have already surrendered, and they have pledged their loyalty to me.” Huang Xiaolong added, “As for Song Chen, I have already exterminated his physical body and trapped his holy soul inside the space of my holy artifact. Lightning flames are torturing his soul as we speak.” Speaking up to this point, he allowed Song Chen’s screams to escape into the air.

Ao Zhao’s face turned ashen in color as he stammered, “You... You...”

“Originally, I was planning to kill you. However, I changed my mind. If you choose to pledge your loyalty to me, I can allow you to live,” Huang Xiaolong explained.

He had his reasons for keeping Ao Zhao alive.

There was a forbidden region in the Yang Dragon Race that was extremely useful when it came to tempering his holy souls, bloodlines, and physiques. If there was a chance in the future, he wanted to use Ao Zhao to enter the forbidden region.

A trace of hope appeared on Ao Zhao’s face when he heard that Huang Xiaolong was willing to spare him. However, hesitation soon appeared in his heart. “You killed all the half-True Saints of my Yang Dragon Race... How am I supposed to report the matter to my father when the time comes?!”

“That’s your problem, not mine,” Huang Xiaolong said.

“What about Ao Sheng and the other elders?!” Ao Zhao still had concerns in his heart.

“If they refuse to serve under me, they will end up like Song Chen. There is no need for you to worry too much about them,” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

Eventually, Ao Zhao chose to surrender. Swearing an oath to the grand dao, Huang Xiaolong planted a strand of purple grandmist qi in his body. It didn’t take long for the Devil Fetus to end up in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

Tossing it into his Darkness Holy Ring, he brought Ao Zhao back towards the Devil Fetus Mountain Range.

By the time they returned, Chen Zhi, and the others were fighting a hard battle with Ao Sheng and the others. Even though those on Huang Xiaolong’s side had the help of the formation to suppress those from the Yang Dragon Race, they were unable to defeat the other party.

Ordering everyone to stop, he allowed Ao Zhao to persuade those from the Yang Dragon Race to surrender.

When Ao Sheng and the others saw Huang Xiaolong heading back with Ao Zhao beside him, panic started to set in in their hearts. When Ao Zhao explained that he wanted them to surrender to Huang Xiaolong, anger instantly overwhelmed them.

“Ao Zhao, you traitor! How dare you betray our Yang Dragon Race and pledge your loyalty to others?!” Ao Sheng shouted furiously, “After we return to the Yang Dragon Race, I’ll tear you limb from limb!”

With two holy souls boosting the formations, millions of sword qi descended on Ao Sheng to shatter his body completely. Reaching out, Huang Xiaolong threw his holy soul into the lightning bead.
