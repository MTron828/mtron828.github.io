Compared to those who fell to their butts in shock, Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, and the others weren’t looking too good themselves.

“Three king of supreme godheads, two Archdevil bloodlines... Two superior Archdevil bloodlines!” Bei Xiaomei saw stars as she muttered to herself. “Uncle is too good... he’s really too good! I guess he’s just good in everything he does!”

WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

Elder Fu felt his vision going dark as beads of cold sweat filled his forehead.

As for Di Jun, who was seated high on his Nine Dragon Throne, he looked at Huang Xiaolong incredulously.

How... How in the world?!

Just as everyone was feeling numb from the shock, rays of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body once again.

“AGAIN?!”

Everyone felt their mind going blank as their jaws dropped to the ground.

The disciples who had conspired to kill Huang Xiaolong off in the preliminary rounds felt their legs trembling and their bodies going soft.

When everyone was feeling lost, nine colored light shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s body. It was so blinding that its appearance caused the spectators’ hearts to tremble.

In that instant, everyone felt that they had learned of a new color, a color mesmerizing beyond comparison.

“Three... Three Archdevil bloodlines!” Bei Xiaomei’s voice resounded through the air.

“He doesn’t just have two!”

As the three figures hovered in the space behind Huang Xiaolong, the entire world seemed to reach a standstill. Grandmist energy, coupled with demonic qi filled the air. Everyone on the Terrace of Heaven stared at Huang Xiaolong, not daring to blink.

No one dared to open their mouth nor breathe loudly.

Even Di Jing was shocked to the point of speechlessness. He stared at the three figures behind Huang Xiaolong and felt as though a bomb had gone off in his mind.

Raising his head to the sky, Di Jing roared with indignation, with a little bit of fury and confusion mixed in.

“Why!”

“How can this happen?! This is not possible!”

He was venting his heart out to the heavens.

In the myriad of worlds, he was the chosen one! He was born with the Heavenly Dao Godhead. Since he was the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, he should be the one and only ruler of the world! How can a freak like Huang Xiaolong appear?!

He wanted to ask the heavens what they meant by allowing someone with higher talent than him to appear in this world!

No matter how he screamed and shouted, no one replied to him. Silence filled the air.

Some Emperor Realm experts revealed a look of pity when they saw how Di Jing was acting.

With the Heavenly Dao Godhead, Heaven’s Dao Physique, and a superior Archdevil bloodline, Di Jing should have been the undisputed number one talent since the start of time! However, there had to be someone called Huang Xiaolong to one-up him!

“AHHHH!”

After crying and yelling his heart out, Di Jing turned to glare at Huang Xiaolong with his bloodshot eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Huang Xiaolong, I’m going to kill you!”

“I’m the number one genius! I’m the supreme genius since the start of time!”

He turned into a massive fireball, and he smashed straight towards Huang Xiaolong.

Di Jing, who had the Heaven’s Dao Physique, was fast to begin with. After adding everything, his speed reached an unbelievable level.

A flame that gave off the feeling that it could exterminate the world went straight towards Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong stopped it right before it could smash into its target. It stopped in mid-air, unable to budge an inch.

Huang Xiaolong used his arms to grab Di Jing’s fists firmly.

The three king of supreme godheads and Archdevil bloodlines in him started to move.

Indescribable light flashed and shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s palms, and a terrifying surge of energy slammed into Di Jing.

As Di Jing stared at Huang Xiaolong with equal parts of shock and horror, he couldn’t react until he was sent flying through the air.

In mid-air, the jade dragons around Di Jing’s body shattered to nothingness, and even the runes on his body started to dim. He vomited mouthful after mouthful of fresh blood, staining the True Emperor Stage red.

The 162 phantoms around him dissipated like the flame of a candle in the wind.

“The Heavenly Prince lost?!”

One of the ancestors from the Brightness Emperor Palace screamed in shock.

Lost!

One move!

He was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong in a single move!

Under the might and suppression of Huang Xiaolong’s three king of supreme godheads and Archdevil bloodlines, Heavenly Prince Di Jing couldn’t withstand a single blow!

All of them stared at the scene with their jaws sticking to the ground. That was the Heavenly Prince they were looking at! The Heavenly Prince with the Heavenly Dao Godhead and the Heaven’s Dao Physique!

When Di Jing was soaring through the air, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as his figure blurred. He appeared right above Di Jing, and he stomped downwards at his chest with all his might.

Di Jing turned into a shooting star as he slammed into the stage. An earth-shattering blast could be heard as his body rammed into the True Emperor Stage.

Even the stage itself trembled when Di Jing came crashing into it.

The Terrace of Heaven fell into absolute silence.

Heavenly Emperor Di Jun grabbed the armrests of his throne as the murderous intent in him rose. Veins bulged on his arm, and he wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong in that very instant.

Seemingly unable to feel the killing intent coming off Di Jun, Huang Xiaolong appeared right above Di Jing who was lying on the ground. He chuckled, “If you want to kill me, make sure you become the embodiment of Heavenly Dao. Or you can wait till you surpass the Emperor Realm...”

He had the Heart of Hell, and even if Di Jing broke into the Emperor Realm in the future, there would be no chance of Di Jing staging a comeback. The only way was for him to break through and become an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm.

Of course, by the time Di Jing became an existence surpassing the Emperor Realm, Huang Xiaolong would have left him in the dust. There was no way Di Jing would ever get the chance to kill him ever again.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong was just talking nonsense when he spoke to Di Jing. He wasn’t going to let him off anyway.

The mere existence of Di Jing was a threat to Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t know what would happen after Di Jing broke into the Emperor Realm. There might be some heaven shaking changes he wasn’t aware of.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you have won?” Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s voice sounded out once again. Brilliant light emerged from the nine heavens as though some sort of force was calling it from below. The dim runes on Di Jing’s body suddenly shone with a brilliant light, even brighter than before.

At the same time, his Heavenly Dao Godhead in the sky seemed to burn with the radiance of a thousand suns. Light covered the land, and everything became suppressed by it. It was as though Di Jing had regained control of the world.

Even Emperor Realm ancestors realized that they were suppressed by the light as well. The speed at which they could circulate their godforce decreased by a whole lot.

Di Jing crawled up from the ground, and his body seemed to return to its peak state. He sneered, “Huang Xaiolong, it seems like you haven’t grasped the concept of Heavenly Dao itself. I have the Heavenly Dao Godhead and the Heaven’s Dao Physique. I am the Heaven’s Dao, and you can’t kill me. That’s unless you surpass Heavenly Dao itself; otherwise, you can only dream of killing me!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Under the Heavenly Dao suppression, he felt that even his king of supreme godheads were being suppressed.

“Right now, I shall show you the true power of the Heavenly Dao Godhead and Heaven’s Dao Physique!”
