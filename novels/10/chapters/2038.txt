Chapter 2039: Core Region of the Devil Abyss

Hearing that Du Hai was willing to lend a hand, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

With Du Hai’s assistance in addition to the King of Darkness, Huang Xiaolong’s side would experience a huge boost. Moreover, he had entered the high-level Emperor Realm, and he was an invincible existence under the Sovereign Realm. With his Heart of Hell, he would be able to control the Tenth Order Emperors on Dun Ei’s side.

If that were to happen, his chances of victory would go through the roof!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he gave Du Hai the other one hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones he had promised him before entering. He added three hundred million after that.

After receiving the spirit stones, Du Hai swore an oath to the heavens.

“Are we killing our way back to the Radiance World now?” Du Hai rubbed his fists in anticipation. After laying low for so many years, he was itching for a fight, a proper fight.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “Not yet. I have some things I need to get done here. When I’m ready to head back, I’ll call for you.”

Even though he had gained two extremely strong helpers, Huang Xiaolong felt that it wasn’t enough to guarantee victory. No one could break the Godly Mt. Xumi, and if he managed to get his hands on the Ancient Heavenly Court, there would no longer be a need to escape whenever the Buddhist Ancestor tried to smash him into pieces with the Godly Mt. Xumi! With the number one grandmist artifact in hand, he would tear through the defenses of the Godly Mt. Xumi!

After making sure that Du Hai and the others were on the same page, Huang Xiaolong told them to make their battle preparations.

Of course, there was no way Huang Xiaolong would tell Du Hai that he was going to look for the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Afterwhich, Huang Xiaolong and his original group left under the escort of the members of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race.

When they sent Huang Xiaolong off, their faces were filled with complicated emotions.

“Lord Father, are we really going to help the King of Hell?” Du Chen asked.

Du Hai glanced at his son, and he sighed, “I’ve already made the oath. Anyway, the current King of Hell has a one of a kind talent. Breaking into the high-level Sovereign Realm is a matter of time. He might even surpass that! It’s nothing for us to help him now. In fact, we might need his help in the future!”

“I know that the Azure Cow broke both your legs in the past, and you’re still holding a grudge against her. However, that’s just a small matter. From now on, stop thinking about it.”

Du Chen remained silent, and he failed to give a reply.

“We need to look at the big picture.” Du Hai’s voice sank as he warned, “I don’t wish to repeat myself.”

“Fine, I understand!” Du Chen lowered his head eventually and surrendered.

“Three supreme godheads and three Archdevil bloodlines!” Du Hai tilted his head to the sky and praised, “Incredible... Simply incredible!”

...

After Huang Xiaolong and the others left, they flew towards the Devil Abyss’ core at top speed.

With the twelve radiance angels opening a path for them, Huang Xiaolong flew in with the rest of his forces behind.

Radiance energy surged out from the radiance angels, and the devil qi in the air was swept away.

Huang Xiaolong pushed the Imperial Beast Devil Stele in his body to the limit as he forced all the devil beasts to retreat.

With the combination of his forces, Huang Xiaolong met with no trouble.

When the sky became dark, Huang Xiaolong finally decided to take a break.

Several days passed as they approached the core of the Devil Abyss.

They eventually arrived at the core region.

After their arrival, Huang Xiaolong pondered about it for a second before deciding to take only the little cow and the King of Darkness with him on the search for the Ancient Heavenly Court.

After all, they were currently in the core region of the Devil Abyss. Dangers surrounded them, and more people meant more trouble.

Huang Xiaolong laid down his order before ordering Wu Shaowu to keep a lookout. He rode on the little cow as the King of Darkness followed behind them to charge into the depths of the Devil Abyss.

The devil qi in the air was extremely terrifying. It was comparable to the time Huang Xiaolong was seven thousand feet deep in the ravine.

Even Sovereign Realm experts were unable to endure that kind of devil qi for a long time. The devil qi had shockingly strong corrosive powers.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless. He circulated the energy in his body before summoning the Lotus of Darkness. His Heart of Hell emitted brilliant rays of light as a world of darkness formed around him.

Since summoning the three supreme radiance treasures would only make him stand out more, Huang Xiaolong didn’t summon them.

Purple lighting swirled around the little cow’s body, and frightening amounts of darkness energy surrounded the King of Hell. There was nothing special about the lightning around the little cow’s body, but the darkness energy surrounding the King of Darkness turned into a massive vacuum cleaner that sucked in devil qi without end.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Moon Jade Spiral Shell and started his search.

Even though he had the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell, he would only be able to sense the presence of the Ancient Heavenly Court if it was nearby. Looking at the Devil Abyss before them, Huang Xiaolong sighed in resignation.

They could only advance slowly in order to look for the Ancient Heavenly Court!

As they had to avoid triggering the restrictions, their speed slowed by a whole lot.

According to what the little cow said, they would use two more months in order to sweep through the entire Devil Abyss. Huang Xiaolong was in no rush as he pushed the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell to the limit.

He had learned about the location of the Ancient Heavenly Court several hundred years ago. Several more months of searching meant nothing to him.

Due to the constant fear of sneak attacks from the devil beasts in the Devil Abyss’ core region, Huang Xiaolong also emitted the aura from the Imperial Beast Devil Stele to the limit.

When Sovereign Realm devil beasts felt the aura coming from the devil stele, they backed far away, and it saved Huang Xiaolong from a huge headache.

Very quickly, one month passed.

The three of them cautiously skirted over the restrictions as they looked for the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Since the little cow had visited there in the past, she was familiar with the restrictions’ layout and managed to avoid most of them.

One fine day, when Huang Xiaolong and the two Sovereigns were flying across a piece of land, the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell vibrated and emitted faint pulses of light. Even though it was only for a moment, Huang Xiaolong noticed its anomaly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“This...” A look of joy appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Ancient Heavenly Court!”

The only reason the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell would react was that they had finally located the Ancient Heavenly Court!

The little cow stared at the King of Darkness, and a flash of joy crossed her eyes.

“Xiaolong, did you feel it?” The little cow asked.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong explained, “The Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell seemed to have found it. However, it’s gone now.”

The two Sovereigns stared at each other and came to a conclusion.

“It seems as though the Ancient Heavenly Court is trapped in some sort of restriction.” The King of Darkness frowned, “Things might get troublesome.”
