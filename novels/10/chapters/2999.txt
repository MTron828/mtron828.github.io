Chapter 3000: Huang Xiaolong Will Lose!

ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The Blood Dragon Stele was obtained by the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor countless years ago, and he was never able to open the space within. He was extremely frustrated by the fact that he was sitting on a pile of untouchable treasures, and his frustration had soon turned into an obsession.

Everything inside was left behind by the God of Creation, and one could only imagine how powerful the treasures within were! If he managed to get his hands on it, he would be able to bring his power up to the next level!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t agree immediately, and he simply stared at the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor. The man himself might have been old, but he looked insanely young. They looked to be of the same age, and if anyone else saw them on the streets, they wouldn’t be able to connect their face to the strongest expert in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

“The Blood Dragon Stele is something that belongs to me anyway. If you lose, you’ll return to me something that already belongs to me... How do you think that works? If I lose, I will have to give you everything inside the stele… How do you even come up with such ideas?” Huang Xiaolong replied placidly.

Ao Xin and the others wanted to lash out when they heard the mockery in Huang Xiaolong’s voice. In their eyes, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was akin to a god. Even if Huang Xiaolong was the Son of Creation, they couldn’t tolerate him mocking their ancestor!

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you?! You’re going too far!” Ao Xin pointed at Huang Xiaolong and he raged. “Lord Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor is only speaking to you because of your identity as the Son of Creation! Do you really think you’re a match for Lord Dark Lightning?! If the ancestor makes a move, he’ll suppress you instantly! When that happens, you’ll have to open the Blood Dragon Stele either way!”

No one realized what had happened in the Blue Lotus Pond, and they didn’t know that he had single-handedly fought against the Old Monster Flame and the others. As such, everyone felt that he was no match for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.

In contrast, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor wasn’t angered. He waved his hand and stopped Ao Xin and the others from speaking. “Oh, I wonder what the Son of Creation would like to propose?”

“If you lose, you’ll hand over the Blood Dragon Stele and the Holy Dragon Treasury.”

“What?!” Ao Xin and the others were enraged before Huang Xiaolong could finish speaking.

The Holy Dragon Race was the strongest race in the Holy Dragon World, and they were also the strongest race in the Divine Tuo Holy World! They had existed for countless years, and the treasures they had obtained could be said to be uncountable! Huang Xiaolong dared to ask for the entire treasury the moment he spoke!

When Ao He and the others were blazing with fury, Huang Xiaolong continued, “Also, you will allow me to deal with them.” He pointed towards Ao He and the other upper echelons of the Holy Dragon Race.

Ao He and the others started to panic when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s conditions.

“You will also have to hand over the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Ancestor and Huang Shuai over to me.”

When the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor heard his terms, a frown formed on his face. However, he eventually chuckled in amusement. “Compared to the Blood Dragon Stele, the Holy Dragon Treasury is nothing! I accept your terms!”

“If I lose, I will hand over both the Blood Dragon Stele and the Holy Dragon Treasury. You can deal with them as you please.” The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor paused for a second. “As for Devil Essence and Huang Shuai, they are not located in the Holy Dragon World. I can’t hand them over to you, but I can tell you where they went.”

Ao He and the others felt their hearts dropping when they heard the promise.

“Ancestor, please!” Ao He fell to his knees, and he was about to beg for mercy when the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor interrupted him.

“Enough. I know what you’re thinking of.”

If he were to really lose, he wouldn’t be able to stop Huang Xiaolong if he wanted to move against Ao He and the others.

As such, Huang Xiaolong might as well not have said it.

Of course, he didn’t think that he would lose to a Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable.

Huang Xiaolong’s talent was shocking, and his combat prowess was terrifying, but the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor estimated his strength to be comparable to the Radiant Winged Dragon Race’s patriarch. In fact, he thought that he could be even weaker than the Radiant Winged Patriarch! He was confident he could deal with Huang Xiaolong and obtain the treasures in the Blood Dragon Stele.

Their battle was set to be in ten days, and they would battle in the Dragon Cloud Sea.

The Dragon Cloud Sea was one of the forbidden regions in the Holy Dragon World, and it was the best place for them to fight. It was boundless, and it spanned the area of half the Dragon Fish Paradise. They could fight to their heart’s content.

As soon as the challenge was accepted by Huang Xiaolong, the Holy Dragon World erupted.

“The man from the Soaring Dragon Terrace was Huang Xiaolong, the Son of Creation!”

“I’ve heard that he killed Feng Nana with a single flick, and he sent everyone from the Heavenly Phoenix Race, who went with her, flying with a single punch! Those weaker than a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable died instantly, and the three Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables were defeated! His strength defies all logic!”

Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess might be shocking, but the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was the strongest person in the Divine Tuo World! Unfortunately, everyone felt as though he was overestimating his abilities by accepting the challenge.

“The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor is an unparalleled existence in the Divine Tuo Holy World, and the Heavenly Phoenix Patriarch said that even if he had two other clones with his strength, he wouldn’t be able to defeat the old ancestor!”

“Huang Xiaolong is definitely going to lose!”

The Holy Dragon World started to rage with excitement, and the news soon entered the ears of the top powers of the Divine Tuo Holy World.

When Bi Cheng and the others received the news, they started to panic.

“His Highness is too rash! Why did he accept the challenge?!” Bi Cheng paced around the hall, and he muttered under his breath.

“The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor had reached grand completion in both his control over lightning and darkness! If His Highness cultivates for several dozen thousand years and reaches the grand completion in controlling the power of absolute flame, absolute frost, absolute poison, and the power of nirvana, he will crush the old dragon without lifting a finger! But now…” Wu Kun of the Divination Creed frowned.

“His Highness accepted the battle, and there’s no going back now.” The Red Fox Dao Venerable frowned. “We can’t even make it for the battle since it takes half a month to travel over to the Holy Dragon World!”

“We can only hope for a miracle to happen…” Bi Cheng shook his head and sighed.

…

In the Holy Dragon World…

Feng Ming, the Heavenly Phoenix Patriarch, held Feng Nana’s remains in his arms. The expression on his face was ugly, and if not for the fact that she could summon the Nine-Tailed Phoenix, she would have died a long time ago.

“Patriarch, Huang Xiaolong destroyed the bodies of our grand ancestors! We can’t allow this to pass!” another grand ancestor from the Heavenly Phoenix Race growled.

“You’re right. After the battle, Huang Xiaolong will be gravely injured. We cannot allow him to leave the Holy Dragon World when that happens.” Feng Nana’s eyes were clouded with hatred, and her heart trembled with fear and anger when she thought of him.
