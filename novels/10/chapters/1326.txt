“That punk’s got some luck, since he was actually able to bump into a wandering space!” Guo Shi harrumphed irritably.

Only one reason could explain Huang Xiaolong and his group’s mysterious and sudden disappearance—they had fallen into a wandering space. A wandering space was a mysterious space bubble that drifted and wandered from one space to another. Therefore, the space had already drifted away by the time Guo Shi and his group tried to chase Huang Xiaolong’s group.

"Let’s return. I want to see if this punk will still be so lucky next time!" Guo Da said full of unwillingness through gritted teeth.

The four of them did not linger, and sped away in the whistling wind.

...

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the others merely felt the scenery in front of them changing as they fell out from the void.

After they regained their senses and surveyed their surroundings, Huang Xiaolong was astonished, "This is...?!"

They were surrounded by the golden streaks of lightning! Furthermore, some of these streaks of golden lightning had morphed into golden lightning flood-dragons.

It was even more shocking that these golden lightning divine dragons had real physical bodies, and each of them had formed awareness!

Below them was a sea of lightning!

A lightning sea was born out of golden lightning. Huang Xiaolong looked towards the other end and couldn’t even see its edge.

Even though they couldn’t see what was at the bottom of the lightning sea, everyone felt trapped by a terrifying power coming from below the sea surface.

"This is... A chaos lightning pool!" The little cow exclaimed, and went on, "The Lightning Pool Mainland’s chaos lightning pool! It really exists!"

Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, and the rest were shaking with excitement. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hahaha, good fortune smiles after surviving a disaster ah! Xiaolong, we’re struck by a big fortune!” The little cow laughed exorbitantly, “If I am right, this must be the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool!”

“The Golden Dragon Lightning Pool?!” Huang Xiaolong looked at her. So did Feng Er, Gui Yi, and others.

The little cow’s face split into a wide grin, “It’s nothing strange that none of you know about the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool. Before the Divine World came into existence, there were nine great chaos lightning pools, each had its own profound esoteric. If one manages to comprehend their secrets, then that person would be able to control the universe’s lightning element force!”

Nine Great Chaos Lightning Pools!

Everyone was astounded.

The little cow went on to explain, “If someone could gather all nine great chaos lightning pools, and comprehend the esoteric within them, then he would become the universe’s lightning overlord, and the most powerful person of lightning dao!”

The most powerful person of lightning dao!

Gradually desire shone in Huang Xiaolong and the others’ eyes as they listened to the little cow’s explanation.

“However, the universe’s chaos lightning pool has existed for countless billions of years, but I have never heard of anyone succeeding in comprehending the esoteric within them.” The little cow added.

Everyone was stunned.

“Of course, even if we can’t comprehend the chaos lightning pool’s mystery, we can still cultivate inside the lightning pool, tempering one’s physical body and godhead with the chaos lightning pool’s lightning force. One’s cultivation would progress rapidly, and would even absorb a tiny strand of the lightning origin force; the benefits are boundless!” The little cow said with bright sparkling eyes.

“Hold on!” Huang Xiaolong suddenly thought of a very important question, “How are we going to take away this chaos lightning pool?” He had mainly come to the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield to search for Li Lu and to determine that she was safe. How was he going to search for Li Lu, after being trapped in this space?

“This...” The little cow was a little embarrassed as she answered, “I don’t know.”

“What? You don’t know?!” Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes and glared at her.

The embarrassment on the little cow’s face deepened, but she tried to salvage the remaining dignity, “I think, if we can comprehend the chaos lightning pool’s esoteric, we probably can get out...”

Huang Xiaolong’s nerves relaxed. If it was according to what the little cow had said, at the very least, there was a way to leave this place. However, the little cow’s following words were like a bucket of ice cold water over his head, “With my understanding of lightning element’s esoteric, to comprehend this Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s esoteric would require ten million years.”

Ten million years!!

Huang Xiaolong had an impulse to strangle the little cow to death.

‘Who knows how the world would have changed by the time he manages to get out in ten million years? In ten million years, who knows how many elections of the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s Chief position would have passed? After ten million years, where would Li Lu be? What would have happened to Yao Chi? Also, his family in the lower realm?!’

“Is there another way?” Huang Xiaolong looked hopefully at the little cow.

But the little cow shook her head and said, “No. Maybe, if you had the ultimate supreme godforce to shatter this Golden Dragon Lightning Pool space? But I wouldn’t be able to do it even at my peak.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help feeling disappointed.

The little cow’s words were not at all helpful.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s obvious disappointment, the little cow quickly said, “Perhaps there are other ways, but I don’t know. Also, you have refined the purple grandmist aura. Based on your comprehension of the purple grandmist aura, maybe, you can comprehend this Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s esoteric in a few hundred years.”

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded, ‘His comprehension of the purple grandmist aura could help him in comprehending the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s esoteric?’

The little cow explained, “The purple grandmist aura is the highest quality of spiritual energy. You’ve refined the purple grandmist aura, in the future, refining any kind of spiritual energy between heaven and earth would take you little effort. For instance, this Golden Dragon Lightning Pool.”

Huang Xiaolong seemingly saw the light at the end of a dark tunnel.

A few hundred years? Though it was still too long for Huang Xiaolong, maybe, he could do it in a few decades, or maybe even comprehend this Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s esoteric in a decade?

Now that he was certain that there was no shortcut to leave Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space, he could only calm down and cultivate here with the others.

Huang Xiaolong ran the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as he sat cross-legged in the air above the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool. Immediately, fine silk-like threads floated upwards into his body from the lightning sea below.

Huang Xiaolong shuddered violently the moment the lightning silky threads of energy entered into his body, as if he was struck by several streaks of lightning. It took him a while to adapt to the lightning energy, and gradually, his body stopped shuddering.

Even a fine strand of this chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s energy contained a large startling amount of energy. Therefore, he did not dare to absorb too much at one time.

Even so, the fine-silky thread amounts of lightning energy turned into a boundless sea once it was inside Huang Xiaolong’s body, and it rushed to every inch of his body.

Three supreme godheads spun to their limits, devouring the energy from the sea of lightning within his body.

The four divine fires’ spirits were emitting fiery glow as chaos spiritual energy fell from the void.

The Yellow Springs Magic Robe unfolded behind him, absorbing the chaos spiritual energy roiling from the void as well as the golden lightning energy from lightning sea below. The magic symbols on the magic robe started glimmering brightly.

One day, two days, three days... In the blink of an eye, one month went by.

Huang Xiaolong was completely cocooned by flashing golden lightning. From afar, he resembled a golden lightning god.

As time went by, the amount of lightning energy Huang Xiaolong had absorbed thickened from fine silk-like threads to wide strings.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength rose steadily, and continued to rise even after he had advanced to peak early Eighth Order Ancient God Realm.

Under the chaos golden lightning’s tempering, Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique, and three supreme godheads slowly grew stronger. Soon, Huang Xiaolong entered into an ethereal state, forgetting everything that existed outside.

In the distance, the little cow, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er also began to cultivate. The little cow was also enshrouded in bright golden lightning, interweaved with purple lightning. Though her momentum couldn’t be compared to Huang Xiaolong’s, it was not far from him. Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others’ momentums were a little weaker though.
