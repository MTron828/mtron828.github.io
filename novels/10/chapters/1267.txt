A day passed.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were passing over a black hill, when they saw a group of blue-robed disciples carrying short blades, fleeing fearfully towards them and shouting for help on the top of their lungs.

Chasing them from behind was a group of Hell’s creatures consisting of the ghost-faced vipers, eight-clawed lizards, sharp-beaked magic centipede, and others; there were more than a dozen kinds of Hell’s creatures.

Judging from this group’s attire, they were likely to be the Void Sky World’s Short Blade Gate’s disciples.

The Short Blade Gate was one of the super forces of Void Sky World, however, they were slightly weaker compared to the Golden Phoenix Pavilion.

In the blink of an eye, these Short Blade Gate’s disciples had run up to Huang Xiaolong, with the wave of Hell creatures following behind them. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was too late for Huang Xiaolong to dodge even if he wanted to; a light flashed and the Mulberry Sword appeared in his hand. A curtain of wooden sword images swished towards the wave of Hell creatures and disappeared into their bodies. In the next second, the group of Short Blade Gate disciples saw the ghost-faced vipers, eight-clawed lizards, sharp-beaked magic centipede, and other creatures getting slashed into pieces from within—they were deader than death itself.

The group of Short Blade Gate disciples was flabbergasted.

They knew how scary these Hell creatures’ strengths were, as each of these creature’s strength was comparable to a late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm master, not to mention, two of them had a peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm master’s strength. Yet all of them were killed by a single sword slash!

“I am Chen Jianfeng of Short Blade Gate, many thanks for Senior’s help just now.” A lean disciple from Short Blade Gate’s group reacted, while he cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong in thanks.

Huang Xiaolong nodded indifferently and left on the little cow without a word. Saving them was nothing more than a helping hand in Huang Xiaolong’s perspective.

Another Short Blade Gate disciple was angered at Huang Xiaolong’s indifference toward them. He harrumphed loudly, “An idiot that doesn’t know what’s good for him!”

Huang Xiaolong’s reaction was unusual because, whenever disciples from another Sects would come across the disciples from Short Blade Gate, they would go to lengths in flattering these Short balde Gate disciples.

"That’s right, does he really think he saved us?!" Another disciple snorted with disdain. "Even without his help, this swarm of Hell creatures couldn’t have hurt us!"

Chen Jianfeng did not say anything. He just watched with a deep frown as Huang ; in truth, Huang Xiaolong’s attitude had greatly displeased him as well.

Chen Jianfeng’s gaze fell onto the dismembered corpses of Hell creatures, ‘able to kill a group of Hell creatures with a single slash? This fat kid, at the very least, has the strength of an Eighth Order Ancient God Realm...’

‘But, on the surface, this fat kid just looked like a mid-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm disciple.’

Huang Xiaolong had turned himself into a small chubby young man. Therefore, in Chen Jianfeng’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong was none other than just a fat kid.

"Let’s go and look for Senior Brother Shi Long and others." Chen Jianfeng said after a while.

All of the displeased disciples became excited at the mention of Senior Brother Shi Long.

Senior Brother Shi Long was the Short Blade Gate’s number one genius. Even though he had only been in the Short Blade Gate for a short time, his prestige among the Short Blade Gate’s disciples was incontestable.

“I have heard that the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Li Zhi, Virtual Returning Cult’s Shi Ping, and Yama Gate’s He Feiyan have also entered the Devil Prison Mountain!” One of the disciples said to his companions.

The Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Virtual Returning Cult, and the Yama Gate, these were the top three forces in Void Sky World!

Li Zhi, Shi Ping, and He Feiyan were respectively the Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Virtual Returning Sect, and Yama Gates’ number one genius disciples.

"But I have also heard that Li Zhu was beaten quite miserably by a Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch disciple a few days back. He couldn’t even take one palm strike from that disciple and ended up in the streets with half of life stripped away from him. That Vientiane World disciple’s cultivation was just at peak early Sixth Order Ancient God Realm!" Short Blade Gate disciple Zhao Yu mocked.

“The Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate? It’s not true, right? Li Zhi has the Hundred Bones Godhead, on top of that, he’s already broken through to early Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, then how is it possible that he was defeated by a peak early Sixth Order Ancient God Realm disciple? Impossible!”

“That’s right, it’s nothing but a rumor!”

“I am not certain if it’s a rumor or not, but it seems that a lot of disciples witnessed it.”

“If that’s really true, then that Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate disciple’s talent is terrifying. The question is, since when did such a disciple in the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate exist? Isn’t Wang Wei the chief disciple form the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate? But Wang Wei is an Ancestor God Realm master.”

The Short Blade Gate’s disciples talked as they went in search of Shi Long.

By this time, Huang Xiaolong was already several thousand li away, therefore, he did not hear the conversation between the Short Blade Gate’s disciples.

Huang Xiaolong surveyed the thick roiling corrosive devil qi that was surrounding him and the little cow. Deep creases formed between his brow as he said, “The Devil Prison Mountain’s corrosive devil qi is getting denser?”

The corrosive devil qi in this area was twice as dense, when compared to the time he had just entered the Devil Prison Mountain.

The little cow nodded, "This corrosive devil qi is coming from a space within the depths of Devil Prison Mountain, therefore it flow is faster over here. If this continues, we could only stay here for three to four more days at the most."

Based on the current situation, in three to four days’ time, even Huang Xiaolong and the little cow wouldn’t be able to withstand the corrosive devil qi.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. After all, he had already decided to leave the Devil Prison Mountain in two days time. Whether the corrosive devil qi became denser or weaker, it didn’t matter to him.

As time passed, more and more Ancestor God Realm masters rushed into the Devil Prison Mountain, thus, the situation had become increasingly dangerous.

Suddenly, the little cow exclaimed and stopped walking.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to ask, the little cow sped towards a black mountain peak that resembled a black jade. They looked around and finally descended on a slightly open space.

The ground was covered with black crystalline rocks that didn’t reflect any light. But as Huang Xiaolong got closer, he could see black energy roiling inside these crystalline rocks resembling a phantom.

This black energy within these black crystalline rocks continuously changed into different shapes.

These black crystalline rocks varied in shapes and sizes; a few were as big as a ball, on the other hand, some were as small as a thumb.

“As expected, it’s the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks!” The little cow exclaimed in delight.

“Eidolon Crystalline Rocks?” Huang Xiaolong turned to the little cow in confusion. In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, there was nothing special about these rocks.

The little cow laughed heartily, “It’s not strange that you don’t know about these Eidolon Crystalline Rocks. These are very rare, even in Hell, formed only in the most yin of lands, every hundred million years.”

“This thing has many uses. It’s extremely hard, hence if you add a little bit of it when forging a chaos spiritual weapon, it could increase the weapon’s power to a great degree. It could also raise the defenses of your armor be a startling amount. Not only Ancestor God Realm, but masters above Ancestor God Realm would be in a frenzy trying to snatch these Eidolon Crystalline Rocks!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t think these black rocks were so great, until he heard the last part; h was simply astounded.

Even masters above Ancestor God Realm would go frenzy to snatch it?! Are these Eidolon Crystalline Rocks really this precious?

“Why are you standing here so dazed? Quick, quick, collect these Eidolon Crystalline Rocks, collect as many as you can!” The little cow urged Huang Xiaolong, “If other cultivators find this place, there would be trouble!”

Huang Xiaolong returned to his senses. In a flicker, he was standing in front of a fist-sized Eidolon Crystalline Rock. A suction force from his hand pulled at the Eidolon Crystalline Rock, but to his astonishment, this fist-sized rock merely rolled slightly on the ground!

It was heavier than an ancient divine mountain!

“Haha, are you frightened? This thing is not light, put some strength into it!” The little cow laughed at Huang Xiaolong.

At the little cow’s words, Huang Xiaolong wrapped his three supreme godheads’ godforce around the fist-sized Eidolon Crystalline Rock and threw it into his Ghost-Buddha Ring.

While Huang Xiaolong was busy collecting the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks, in the far distance, a group of disciples was flying towards them. These disciples were none other than the Short Blade Gate’s disciples, whom Huang Xiaolong had saved earlier. In addition to them, there were twenty plus disciples flying with their group. The young man leading in front had a lightning glimmering in his pupils, he was the Short Blade Gate’s number one genius disciple, Shi Long.
