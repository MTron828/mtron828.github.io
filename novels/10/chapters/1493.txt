Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong’s awkward expression and hearing his stammering, Yao Chi giggled. “What that one, this one? What did you see just now? Did you see Elder Sister Peng Xiao and Elder Sister Fang Xuanxuan’s ... You saw them didn’t you?”

Huang Xiaolong dazed for a moment looking at Yao Chi’s beautiful and charming face, then his gaze moved lower and he gulped subconsciously. He grinned as he said, “It wasn’t very clear, why don’t you let me have a good look tonight?”

Yao Chi’s face was red as an apple hearing his reply, she lowered her head shyly. Huang Xiaolong could hear her complain, “You only know how to bully me, but I don’t see you bullying Younger Sister Li Lu.”

A roguish chuckle sounded from Huang Xiaolong’s throat as he stepped forward and carried Yao Chi up.

Yao Chi shrieked sharply and immediately cried out for help.

Soon, the sound of spring came from the room.

At this time, Peng Xiao, Fang Xuanxuan, and Li Lu had fled into hiding in each of their own rooms with the doors shut and locked. Each could feel that their faces were hot enough to boil water, especially Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan, as both of them were struggling internally about how they should face Huang Xiaolong in the future.

“Arggh, so embarrassing. Why did that guy come out of his seclusion so suddenly? So embarrassing ah, did he see anything? What did he see?” Fang Xuanxuan clutched her flushed face.

“It’s all Yao Chi’s fault. If it wasn’t for her, how could that guy have seen that scene!”

“Also, out of all the time that guy could have chosen to exit, why did he choose that specific time? ...And appear so quietly, it must be deliberate!”

“Mine here is a little bit smaller than Younger Sister Yao Chi, he won’t laugh at me, right? Ptooi! Pttooii! What am I thinking about?”

Hiding in her room, all kinds of thoughts raced through Fang Xuanxuan’s head.

Peng Xiao and Li Lu were having similar thoughts. Even though Li Lu and Huang Xiaolong go way back, their relationship had not developed further than holding hands. To have Huang Xiaolong stumble into that scene, she couldn’t help feeling shy and embarrassed.

It was a full day later before Huang Xiaolong emerged from Yao Chi’s room. From there, he headed out to look for the little cow Xiaoniu, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, the others, and his Masters Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

The little cow rolled her eyes upon seeing Huang Xiaolong and harrumphed, “You kid are willing to come out now? Also, Yao Chi’s voice is so loud, can’t you use less strength? It’s so noisy that this old cow can’t even meditate. Couldn’t you put up a barrier?”

Others were dumbfounded for a second, and the expressions on their faces were a sight to behold.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor laughed loudly without restraint.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and others did not dare to laugh, while Feng Er lowered her head to hide her blushing face.

The little cow was probably the only one who dared to speak to Huang Xiaolong in this manner.

Huang Xiaolong could hardly hide the embarrassment on his face. He gave the little cow a fierce glare that meant - ‘I’ll pack you up later.’ To this, the little cow tilted her head as if she didn’t care at all.

Huang Xiaolong cleared his throat and quickly changed the subject, “Everyone get ready, we’ll set off to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield in a couple of months.”

Everyone froze.

The little cow was the first to shriek in joy, “Good ah, good ah, I support this.”

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes, inwardly thinking, do I need your support?

He subsequently checked others’ cultivation realms and progress.

Over a decade, everyone’s strength had risen significantly while they were in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s environment, as well as from the benefits of the Fortune Divine Fruits, and chaos spiritual pills Huang Xiaolong had given them. Gui Yi and Gui Er’s improvement was the most obvious, as both of them had advanced to the late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

Although Feng Er had yet to cross the line and break through to God King Realm, her cultivation had reached the limit of the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. Advancing to the God King Realm was just around the corner for her.

Xu Baisheng’s cultivation had recovered to the Seventh Order God King Realm.

Though Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi had yet to break through to the Third Order God King Realm, all three of them had reached the late-Second Order God King Realm.

Huang Xiaolong distributed Fortune Divine Fruits and chaos spirit stones to everyone, before leaving to see his Master Zhao Lei and Sect Chief Fang Gan next.

Since he was planning to set off to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, he needed to inform Zhao Lei and Fang Gan.

But Huang Xiaolong could already feel a headache, imagining their reactions. He knew that both of them were definitely going to use his low cultivation realm as an excuse to keep him at the Fortune Emperor Palace, arguing that the outside world was too dangerous.

Thus, he had foreseen it would need a great deal of effort to convince the both of them.

This was one of Huang Xiaolong’s troubles after exposing his supreme godhead.

If he was still a high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead, it would have been so much more convenient to go wherever and whenever he wanted to go.

As expected, upon seeing his Master Zhao Lei and stating his intentions, Zhao Lei’s first reaction was to shake his head and say, “No!”

Zhao Lei was looking at Huang Xiaolong for quite a while, and to his pleasant surprise... “You’ve already advanced to the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly upon seeing that Zhao Lei was trying to change the subject. “Master, it would be difficult for me to break through to the God King Realm even if I continued cultivating in seclusion for another twenty years.”

Zhao Lei widened his eyes and glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong as he scolded, “What did you say? Difficult to break through in twenty years, you can do it in thirty years, is that right? Are you complaining that thirty years is too long? Do you know how many years I took to advance from the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm to the God King Realm? Exactly 1,321 years, nine months, and ten days!”

A drop of sweat rolled down the side of Huang Xiaolong’s forehead watching his Master’s agitated reaction.

However, half a day later, Huang Xiaolong heaved in relief as he walked out of Zhao Lei’s place; he had successfully convinced Zhao Lei to let him travel to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

With that taken care off, only Sect Chief Fang Gan remained.

When Huang Xiaolong reached Fang Gan’s cultivation palace and met him, he was surprised as Fang Xuanxuan was there as well. Upon seeing her, the nosebleed triggering scene from the day before emerged in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Fang Xuanxuan stiffened brieftly when she saw Huang Xiaolong, and a blush crept up her face as she said in a fluster, “Father, I still have something to do, I’m leaving first.”

But Fang Gan stopped her, “I still have something to speak to you about. You don’t need to rush off in a hurry because Xiaolong is here. He is your savior, and also your Uncle Zhao’s disciple, so you two should hang out more.”

Fang Gan’s words were unintentional, but in Huang Xiaolong and Fang Xuanxuan’s ears, it sounded like he was trying to match them together.

Fang Xuanxuan turned even redder after hearing Fang Gan’s words.

There were different kinds of ‘hang out.’

Fang Gan then turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, smiling like an amiable elder, “Xiaolong ah, is there something the matter, since you came looking for me?”

Huang Xiaolong came to his senses and clearly stated his intention.

Fang Gan’s reaction was just like Zhao Lei. He shook his head and said ‘no’ with a determined tone.

It took another half a day’s effort for Huang Xiaolong to walk out from Fang Gan’s place, after having persuaded Fang Gan successfully.

Fang Xuanxuan walked out from Fang Gan’s place with Huang Xiaolong. Both looked a little embarrassed as they walked together. In the end, it was Fang Xuanxuan who spoke first, “You really want to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield? With your current strength, it’s too risky. Moreover, the Fiend God Emperor Palace might probably take action against you.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, and reassured her, “I had gone to train at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield when I was still an Ancient God Realm. Even though the Fiend God Emperor Palace might do something, I cannot stay within the Fortune Emperor Palace forever because of that.”

Fang Xuanxuan had no retort, thus she kept silent. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Then, be careful.” After both had walked a short distance, Fang Xuanxuan said to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “You too.”

Then again, Huang Xiaolong needed to make quite a lot of preparations before setting off for the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. First of all, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship needed to be repaired. Another thing was resolving Xiang Xun’s petrification seals if he could, to raise Xiang Xun’s strength.
