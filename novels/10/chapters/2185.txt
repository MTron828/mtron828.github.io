Chapter 2186: Devouring Dong Cheng!

Following behind Dong Cheng, the Giant Kun Ruler harrumphed as he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong. His fist pierced through the void, and space around it started to crumble as the lightning qi in the surroundings transformed into nothingness.

A single fist caused the heavens to shake and the earth to tremble.

In that instant, everyone felt the space outside the 33 heavens shaking violently.

Jian Qintian’s pupils shrank. If the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s ruler were to send that punch flying towards me, would I be able to receive it?!

He didn’t have the luxury of time to think about the answer as Yang Tianchen had already made his move. The All Extinguishing Lightning Whip in his hands danced as he sent a terrifying strike at Huang Xiaolong.

Lightning qi seemed to form a massive river as it charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

When they felt the energy pulsating in the river of lightning, everyone felt their hearts palpitating.

The river of lightning was unstoppable as it swallowed everything in its path. It could destroy everyone, and it contained the ability to exterminate the world.

Huang Xiaolong watched as the three of them attacked at the same time. A look of indifference remained on his face as he raised a single fist. With one punch, he shattered Dong Cheng’s icy attack. The shockingly powerful wave of energy coming from Dong Cheng scattered like it wasn’t there, to begin with.

After taking care of that, Huang Xiaolong’s fist didn’t stop. It slammed into Dong Cheng’s defenses and shattered them all.

As a miserable shriek left Dong Cheng’s lips, he was sent flying away.

At the same time, a light blue shield emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. It was the Unbreakable Divine Shield that welcomed the Giant Kun Ruler’s attack. That wasn’t the end as Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth to swallow the lightning energy in the lightning river formed by Yang Tianchen’s All Extinguishing Lightning Whip.

Boom!

When the punch landed on Huang Xiaolong’s Unbreakable Divine Shield, it didn’t manage to shatter the barrier of light in front of it. It was blocked in an instant.

Stopping all the attacks flying towards him, Huang Xiaolong raised his other hand and pulled Dong Cheng over.

By the time everyone noticed what had happened, Huang Xiaolong was already grabbing Dong Cheng by the neck.

Flabbergasted looks formed on the faces of everyone who were present to witness the scene.

Even Jian Qintian couldn’t believe his eyes.

Jian Xiaofu’s little lips parted as she stared at the scene before her in disbelief. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country, who was about to lead the experts under him to cause some trouble for Huang Xiaolong, stopped dead in his tracks. An incredulous look appeared on his face.

As for the experts of the various factions who were about to help their leaders, they felt their bodies turning stiff.

The combined might of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, Yang Tianchen, and Dong Cheng was blocked by Huang Xiaolong with such ease! He didn’t even break a sweat! With a single punch, he stopped Dong Cheng, and he didn’t even need to do anything to stop the Giant Kun Ruler. He even managed to capture Dong Cheng before they could react!

This!

The ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and Yang Tianchen didn’t believe their eyes.

Dong Cheng, who was held by the neck, stared at Huang Xiaolong with a look of fear in his eyes. Despite his best efforts, Dong Cheng felt as though his body was filled with some sort of restriction, stopping him from circulating his energy.

“Huang Xiaolong, you...” The blood drained from Dong Cheng’s face.

“Huang Xiaolong, release him immediately!” The Giant Kun Ruler felt his expression turning sullen as he growled at Huang Xiaolong. The giant Kun behind him started to unfurl its wings.

As its wings slowly opened up, a storm was swept up in the surroundings. Dark blue qi poured out from the void above the Kun as it formed a massive sea under the feet of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s ruler.

With the storm behind him and the sea of blue qi under him, the ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country seemed like a supreme existence who lorded over the seas. With endless might, the aura he emitted strengthened by manyfolds. His current strength was many times stronger than earlier.

As for Yang Tianchen, he wasn’t planning to hold back either. Lightning started to swirl around his body as destructive might emerged from his palms to form a terrifying coat of energy that surrounded him. A type of inexhaustible power started to emerge from the Lightning Whip in his hand.

The two of them locked onto Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

If Huang Xiaolong refused to hand Dong Cheng over, the two of them would attack him without hesitation.

They were merely caught by surprise previously. This time, they wouldn’t make the same mistake.

Upon seeing that his comrades were about to save him, Dong Cheng yelled, “Huang Xiaolong, why are you still not letting go?!”

“What are you talking about...?” Huang Xiaolong completely ignored the ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and Yang Tianchen. A sinister smile broke out on his face as he chuckled, “Didn’t you encounter some fortuitous encounter in the past? Didn’t that allow you to obtain a complete dao saint godhead, a saint physique, and a saint bloodline?”

When Dong Cheng looked at the nefarious smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, his heart went cold. How could he not understand what Huang Xiaolong was after? “What... what do you want from me?”

“You’ll learn about it soon.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother explaining as the smile on his face became a million watts brighter. Devouring force started to emerge from his palms as it surged into Dong Cheng’s body.

A terrified look appeared on Dong Cheng’s face as his body started to shake in fear. “NO! You can’t do this!”

“Save me!”

“Brother Giant Kun, Brother Yang, please save me!”

It was too late as everything in Dong Cheng’s body was devoured by Huang Xiaolong. His blood essence, saint bloodline, complete dao saint godhead, and even his Sovereign’s will was sucked dry by Huang Xiaolong.

It only took a second before Dong Cheng’s body started to shrink.

“Kill him!”

The ruler of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country yelled as murderous intent filled his eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, eat my fist!”

He punched both fists out towards Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Boom!

The moment his punch was sent out, two massive Kun heads appeared and the space around them started to buzz.

As though they had rehearsed this, Yang Tianchen struck out at the exact same time. He waved the All Extinguishing Lightning Whip in his hand as bolts of lightning started to fall from the sky. They were several times stronger than the attack he had unleashed previously!

A cold harrumph left Huang Xiaolong’s lips as he punched out with his right fist. In an instant, the two Kun heads were smashed into smithereens. He didn’t move a single muscle as he stood with his back ramrod straight. The space between his eyebrows started to light up as Yang Tianchen’s attack fell on him and everyone was treated to a scene they would never forget as long as they lived. The lightning summoned by Yang Tianchen poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body without the slightest trace of hurting him.

With his left hand, he continued to refine the gains he obtained from Dong Cheng.

After refining Dong Cheng’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, Huang Xiaolong would be able to upgrade his own!

Once again, Dong Cheng’s body started to shrivel up.

“Brother Giant Kun, please hurry up and save me!” Dong Cheng’s cries of help became more and more urgent as fear overwhelmed him.

The Giant Kun Ruler raised his head and roared to the heavens. His yell filled the skies for a trillion miles as his body started to swell. The gale behind him raged on as the sea of dark blue energy below his feet started to expand.

“Huang Xiaolong, take my Oscillating Heavens Fist!”

“When the giant Kun descends, every creature under the heavens will submit!”

As soon as the words left his lips, two massive fists came crashing down towards Huang Xiaolong.

Terrifying winds coupled with mighty blue qi revolved around his fists as they shot through the void to arrive before Huang Xiaolong. Two massive Kuns materialized and charged towards their target.

Those two Kuns were no projections. They were the real things.

Yang Tianchen didn’t remain idle as he started to rise above before throwing the All Extinguishing Lightning Whip into the air. As the tip of the whip latched onto the tail of the whip, a giant circle was formed in the air.
