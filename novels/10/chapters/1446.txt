Elder Bai had to elaborate after seeing Zhang Dong’s confused expression, “A disciple named Huang Xiaolong registered just before Peng Xiao. He has the high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead with the current cultivation of peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

Zhang Dong was even more confused now. A high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead, and the peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm cultivation... Was this level of a disciple worthy of being brought to his attention?

Elder Bai’s tone turned serious as he went on, “But his bone-age is below one thousand years!”

“Below a thousand years...” Zhang Dong nodded his head, then, in a split second, his eyes widened with shock as he exclaimed, “What? What did you say just now? Below one thousand years? That’s, that’s impossible!”

But Elder Bai reiterated with confidence, “It is indeed below one thousand years. I personally touched his bone frame and he is definitely less than one thousand years old. This cannot be wrong, but this also makes me feel strange and doubtful about it.” He remembered something as he spoke thus added, “Oh right, Huang Xiaolong has the True Dragon Physique, on top of that, his True Dragon Physique is super freaky. According to him, his True Dragon Physique can continuously evolve!”

“A True Dragon Physique that could continuously evolve!” Zhang Dong was even more astonished.

The True Dragon Physique ranked fourth amongst the three thousand unique physiques, so one could imagine how strong the True Dragon Physique was. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even the female disciple Peng Xiao was shocked by this information.

“Even though this kid’s strength is peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm at the moment, his physique is strong, and it is comparable to some peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciples.” Elder Bai praised.

Both Zhang Dong and Peng Xiao were further astounded by Elder Bai’s praise of Huang Xiaolong.

“Are you sure that his True Dragon Physique is that powerful?” Zhang Dong asked.

Zhang Dong’s doubt was understandable. Even though the True Dragon Physique was ranked fourth and powerful in terms of defenses and attack, it wasn’t as exaggerated as Elder Bai had said.

In Zhang Dong’s mind, even if Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique was mutated allowing it to continuously evolve, it was already considered terrifying to be comparable to late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple’s body, what’s more a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple’s body.

Elder Bai answered confidently, “I’ve checked his physique repeatedly with my godforce, so there is no mistake.” He sighed and went on, “This kid’s physique could enter the top ten among the Divine World’s top forces’ genius disciples.”

Ranking within the top ten among the vast Divine World was already the highest praise.

Then again, if Elder Bai knew that Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique was so strong that he could actually defeat a late-First Order God King Realm disciple merely with his physical strength, he wouldn’t have said that Huang Xiaolong could merely enter the top ten in the whole Divine World.

Even so, it was enough to send tumultuous waves across Zhang Dong and Peng Xiao’s hearts.

Huang Xiaolong’s physique could rank within the top ten among the Divine World’s various forces’ genius disciples?

Though Zhang Dong inwardly thinks Elder Bai had exaggerated Huang Xiaolong’s physique to a certain extent, he was still shocked, nonetheless.

“Which branch is this Huang Xiaolong from?” Zhang Dong asked seriously.

“It’s the Vientiane branch.” Elder Bai answered. “It’s a branch under Elder Wu Zongpeng from the Punishment Hall’s jurisdiction. But if I remembered correctly, Wu Zongpeng doesn’t like the Vientiane branch very much.” He paused slightly before continuing, “But pity ah, Huang Xiaolong’s merely a high emperor rank godhead.”

Zhang Dong nodded in agreement then ordered Elder Bai, “Send people to investigate Huang Xiaolong, I want a detailed report on him. Oh yes, and don’t report Huang Xiaolong’s testing stone’s results to upper management for now. And one more thing, order Luo Yun and the rest to seal their mouths.”

Elder Bai smiled as he complied, “Rest assured, Hall Master.”

Elder Bai understood that Huang Xiaolong had roused their Hall Master Zhang Dong’s interest, and if Huang Xiaolong performed well in the rankings competition by getting a place within the top one hundred, it was likely that Zhang Dong would accept Huang Xiaolong as his disciple.

Their Hall Master Zhang Dong himself had a unique physique. Moreover, he had been researching body tempering cultivation, thus he had been looking for a disciple with a strong physical body.

Even though there were numerous disciples at the Fortune Emperor Palace, none of them fulfilled Hall Master Zhang Dong’s requirements.

‘Kiddo, whether you can catch our Hall Master’s eye depends on your luck six months from now.’ Elder Bai thought to himself. He saluted Zhang Dong and took his leave respectfully.

It took half a month for Huang Xiaolong to get back to the small courtyard from the Supreme Harmony Hall.

Stepping into the courtyard, Huang Xiaolong saw the little cow sunbathing with her ass in the air. Huang Xiaolong smiled at the familiar sight as he saw the little cow’s leisurely manner.

“You’re back.” The little cow said without bothering to raise her head.

At the same time, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Jiang, Xu Yong, Xu Shi, Feng Er, and the rest also appeared at the yard consecutively from various directions, and saluted Huang Xiaolong in greeting.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily as he said, “Everyone must be bored being cooped up here in recent days. Let’s go out for a walk, and do some shopping.”

He had successfully passed the enrollment and was already an outer sect disciple of the Fortune Emperor Palace, therefore, it wasn’t a problem to take everyone outside.

At Huang Xiaolong’s words, the little cow literally jumped up from the floor. She looked at Huang Xiaolong with sparkling eyes, and said cheerfully, “I have heard this Ice Lotus World has an ice lotus delicacy.”

Huang Xiaolong was caught off guard by her enthusiasm. He gave her a helpless smile. Needless to guess, this old cow had already sneaked out, otherwise, how could she know about this ice lotus delicacy.

“Come on.” Huang Xiaolong urged with a chuckle.

Everyone stepped out from the courtyard to the streets, strolling leisurely.

Even though it was a small city, it was still bustling. The city layout was systematic, with scattered old buildings adding charm to the brimming vitality.

With the little cow leading in front, the group arrived at the restaurant that she claimed to serve the delicious ice lotus. Huang Xiaolong was surprised to see that the restaurant’s space was small, and it looked more like a shop than a usual restaurant.

However, like the little cow had mentioned, the ice lotus was indeed delicious and very expensive. One small bottle actually cost ten thousand low grade-seven spirit stones...

Though ten thousand low grade-seven spirit stones were nothing to Huang Xiaolong, it would look like an exorbitant price to any other average outer sect disciple.

After leaving the restaurant, Huang Xiaolong’s group did not return to the small courtyard immediately, but flew towards the closest big city. Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Crimson Crescent City and purchased a residence, considering that they would stay for a prolonged period at the Fortune Emperor Palace in the future. With that in mind, Huang Xiaolong also chose a better residence.

The residence was named the Edge of the World Manor and it was several times pricier than the Great Firmament Residence at Brimming Snow City. Everything inside the manor was made with excellent materials, so Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to make any further changes.

Huang Xiaolong stayed and cultivated within the Edge of the World Manor with ease, while waiting for the ranking competition.

Sitting cross-legged inside his room, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars refined and absorbed batches of one hundred low-grade grandmist spiritual pills as time passed.

Sixteen days until the day of the rankings competition, Huang Xiaolong stopped cultivating.

“Finally, it’s time for the rankings competition.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself and stood up. Inwardly, robust supreme godforce had filled his body.

Although Huang Xiaolong had not broken through in this half a year’s cultivation, he could feel that his strength had improved significantly.
