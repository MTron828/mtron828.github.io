Within seconds, the giant sea behemoth’s two front legs arrived ten meters away from Huang Xiaolong’s head. The Barbarian God Sect disciples’ hearts missed a beat watching this dangerous situation. Yao Chi was already deathly pale, crying loudly, “Xiaolong!”

Just when everyone thought Huang Xiaolong was dead for sure, he raised his head, glancing at the giant legs trying to step on him, his expression cold. When the sea behemoth’s legs were one meter from the crown of Huang Xiaolong’s head, the giant legs actually halted in midair.

Before those watching from the city walls, a layer of green ice appeared on the giant sea behemoth’s legs and spread upward at a rapid rate. First, it covered the two front legs, then its torso, before the rest of its body was imprisoned under a thick layer of green ice, turning into a green ice statute.

“W-what is that?!” On the city walls, the Elephant Genesis Sect’s Hu Qing screeched with disbelief.

His voice had just sounded when a giant green ice-man appeared, the Green Ice Hail Devil Bing Jiuyi.

Bing Jiuyi stood tall in the air behind Huang Xiaolong, exuding a tyrannical divine might.

Terrifying frigid qi blasted out like an angry tsunami, flooding out in all directions. With Huang Xiaolong as the center, all the sea beasts within ten thousand li radius were frozen into ice statues.

The experts on the South Huai City walls were agape watching the sudden turn of events, dazed where they stood. Their gazes were fixed on the giant green figure silently floating in the air behind Huang Xiaolong.

“An-Ancient God Realm master!” Hu Qing’s tongue quivered as he exclaimed in shock, gulping a few times, feeling an icy coldness crawling up his hands and feet.

An Ancient God Realm master!

From the ancient Green Ice Hail Devil Tribe!

Sounds of people sucking in cold air could be heard all around, awe mingled with disbelief in their hearts looking at the two figures standing together.

This Huang Xiaolong actually had an Ancient God Realm master protecting him?!

As this thought crossed the Elephant Genesis Sect Elder Yang Yu’s mind, his buttocks tightened in fear. Terror seized his heart as if judgment day was breathing down his neck.

Elder Guo Xuan and the surrounding Barbarian God Sect disciples were just as astounded as the rest.

Only Yao Chi had an ecstatic expression on her face.

Earlier, Huang Xiaolong reassured her through voice transmission that he still had the protection of an Ancient God Realm Green Ice Hail Devil, and he did not lie to her.

Outside the city walls, Huang Xiaolong flew up high into the air until he was standing face to face with the sea behemoth. His Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power rolled out toward the giant sea beast at a frenzied speed, as if it couldn’t wait a moment longer. In a matter of moments, the sea behemoth’s essence was sucked dry.

Huang Xiaolong had never planned to expose Bing Jiuyi’s existence so fast, but there was no other way about it. Then again, revealing Bing Jiuyi’s existence may not necessarily be a bad thing; at the very least, it could deter those annoying small shrimps that couldn’t wait to stir the pot into chaos.

After absorbing the sea behemoth’s essence energy, the vortex formed around him expanded once more. Combined with his darkness power, Huang Xiaolong was like a moving giant black hole, causing all the frozen sea beasts to be sucked into the vortex.

As more and more sea beasts were sucked into the black hole, Huang Xiaolong’s momentum rose.

Kill, kill, kill!

Flickers of black blade qi shot out from the Zhenyu Silver Moon Blade.

...

Several hours later.

Behind Huang Xiaolong, in fact, all around him were dried corpses of sea beasts.

Standing in the air above the sea beast tide, the devouring black hole swirling around Huang Xiaolong continued to grow bigger still, reaching an astounding few hundred li in diameter.

Huang Xiaolong was the epitome of a death god that climbed out from the abyss of hell, a death god bent on the path of slaughter.

On the city walls, both the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect Elders and disciples had woken from their shock only to fall into a deep pit of fear.

However, despite Bing Jiuyi, Huang Xiaolong, and Xiaoniū’s continued slaughter of sea beasts, the three of them still failed to hinder the sea beasts from targeting and attacking South Huai City.

Groups after groups of sea beasts still advanced dauntlessly forward, ferociously attacking the South Huai City’s protective barrier. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The experts on the city walls were barely holding on fending off wave after wave of sea beasts.

The city’s protective barrier allowed the attacks of human experts within the city to pass through, landing on the sea beasts outside. Whereas the sea beasts’ attacks would be blocked by the protective barrier, shielding everyone from harm.

However, once the protective barrier was broken through, all the human race experts would have to fight head-on with these sea beasts. When that happened, it would be hard for them to defend the city.

Looking at the endless tide of sea beasts persistently attacking the protective barrier, Huang Xiaolong who was stuck killing sea beasts at another end felt quite helpless as well. All he could do at the moment was kill more as fast as he could.

Three days passed, yet the tide did not seem to reduce at all.

Even Huang Xiaolong who had been killing sea beasts in the midst of the tide felt horrified.

After enduring three days of multiple attacks, South Huai City’s protective barrier had weakened drastically. Huang Xiaolong grew more anxious with each passing moment looking at the weakening barrier.

“Master, we can’t go on like this, we must find the leader of this sea beast tide.” The little cow solemnly said, by this point, even the little cow’s eyes had turned red from all the killing.

Huang Xiaolong frowned, “The leader is hidden amongst all these sea beasts, and even the beasts themselves don’t know where it is, how are were supposed to find the leader amongst them?”

A light flickered in the little cow’s eyes, “This sea beasts tide has been attacking consistently wave after wave in an orderly manner. The sea beast tide leader must be passing orders through some secret method we don’t know. Let me try using an old secret method to locate that leader.”

With that said, the little cow closed its eyes, the lightning symbol on its forehead softly shining.

A stream of energy others couldn’t see shot into the void.

Roughly fifteen minutes later, the little cow’s eyes snapped open, looking at front left of the sea beast tide.

Xiaoniū leaped into the air with Huang Xiaolong on its back, flying towards the left, while Bing Jiuyi followed closely behind them.

Arriving at the front of the sea beast tide, the little cow’s gaze fell onto two ordinary looking Metal Carapace Searhinos.

“These two Metal Carapace Searhinos?” Huang Xiaolong could hardly believe it.

The little cow grinned wickedly saying, “Don’t look down on these two, they aren’t ordinary at all.” Ribbons of lightning crackled around the little cow’s body and streaked out toward the Metal Carapace Searhinos like a torrential thunderstorm.

Yet, a metallic light rose from the two beasts and actually deflected the lightning attack. The aura they released was shocking.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, these two Metal Carapace Searhinos had the strength of peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm at the very least...

The instant the two Metal Carapace Searhinos blocked the little cow’s attack, their bodies blurred, foggy mist spread while the two of them escaped into the void.

Huang Xiaolong was astonished.

However, Bing Jingyi raised his palms toward the seaside in the distance and struck down, causing the two Metal Carapace Searhinos to fall out from the void.

Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a flicker, arriving in front of the two sea beasts together with the little cow.
