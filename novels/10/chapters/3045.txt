Chapter 3046: Stop!

Jin Xiaoxiao, Li Dongjun, Yu Dong, and others, who had been coveting Huang Xiaolong’s Lightning Flame Pill and origin qi, paled slightly after seeing Huang Xiaolong coming towards them.

But Jin Xiaoxiao soon regained her composure. As the Golden Fox Princess, she didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to harm a hair on her.

As Jin Xiaoxiao calmed down, Li Dongjun, and Yu Dong reacted, remembering their identities. Dao Jianchou was someone without any backing, Huang Xiaolong could kill him without scruples, but behind them were the Nine Vision Creed and Devil Curse Creed. They were respectively the Nine Vision Creed and Devil Curse Creed’s young patriarchs. They bet Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t dare to attack them.

The Golden Fox Army’s experts were apprehensive when they noticed Huang Xiaolong was headed towards them. Even so, they surrounded Jin Xiaoxiao in several protective layers, blocking Huang Xiaolong.

“Please stay!” A Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Golden Fox Army’s senior commander barked at Huang Xiaolong, “Take one more step, and we’ll…”

Before he could finish his words, he was sent flying with a kick from Lei Yu.

The Golden Fox Army’s experts closed in around Jin Xiaoxiao nervously.

“How dare you attack a Golden Fox Army’s senior commander?!” a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Golden Fox Army’s senior commander snapped at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu.

He was the strongest person amongst those protecting the Golden Fox Princess during this trip.

It was understandable that he was infuriated as the Golden Fox Army was the law enforcer in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave. Which creeds’ or forces’ disciples did not show respect to them?

As a senior commander of Golden Fox Army, creeds’ patriarchs would roll out the red carpet to welcome them. Since when had they been disregarded so?!

Lei Yu didn’t even bother to raise his eyes, and with one kick, he sent the late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable senior commander flying as well. On top of that, he used more force this time, directly kicking the senior commander out of Xuan City.

Jin Xiaoxiao fumed, “What are you playing at?!”

Huang Xiaolong moved closer to her on Lei Yu, and any Golden Fox Army who blocked their path was kicked away by Lei Yu.

Several meters from Jin Xiaoxiao, Huang Xiaolong stopped and looked indifferently at Li Dongjun, Yu Dong, and the group of experts from Nine Vision Creed and Devil Curse Creed. “Kneel down!”

Kneel down! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s voice contained an inviolable might. Li Dongjun, and Yu Dong felt their hearts palpitate as they fell to their knees unknowingly.

But after their knees hit the ground, burning anger of humiliation gave Li Dongjun the courage to rise from the ground and glare at Huang Xiaolong with ferocious eyes. “Who do you think you are to make us kneel?!”

Old Monster Flame directly slapped Li Dongjun into the ground, and no further noise came from Li Dongjun. Jin Xiaoxiao, Yu Dong, and the others saw Li Dongjun had turned into a pool of blood.

Blood drained from Yu Dong and the others’ faces. Honestly, Yu Dong who had wanted to get up to his feet didn’t dare to move an inch. Even Jin Xiaoxiao, the Golden Fox Princes, who usually treated other experts of Golden Fox Heavenly Cave as lowly ants was white as a sheet.

While everyone was stiff with fear, Old Monster Flame struck out again with his palm, slapping Yu Dong into the ground, reducing him into a pool of blood next to what used to be Li Dongjun.

The experts closest to Li Dongjun and Yu Dong plopped lifelessly on the ground, scared out of their wits.

Li Dongjun and Yu Dong were young patriarchs of the Nine Vision Creed and Devil Curse Creed, and just moments ago, many of them were still flattering these two young patriarchs, yet Li Dongjun and Yu Dong were reduced to two pools of blood in the blink of an eye.

“All Nine Vision Creed’s and Devil Curse Creed’s disciples willing to submit to Leiyu Creed will be spared, and those unwilling will die!” Huang Xiaolong stated indifferently as his cold gaze swept over the two creeds’ disciples.

According to his initial intention, he was going to slaughter all these Nine Vision Creed’s and Devil Curse Creed’s disciples, but after looking at these quivering disciples, Huang Xiaolong’s interest waned, and he changed his mind.

Jin Xiaoxiao’s face was ugly to the extreme, and everyone knew that Li Dongjun and Yu Dong were her ‘cronies’. Huang Xiaolong had not only killed these two people in front of her, but he also had the guts to ‘recruit’ the remaining Nine Vision Creed’s and Devil Curse Creed’s disciples in public.

Huang Xiaolong did not only disregarded her, the Golden Fox Princess, but also blatantly disregarded her father, the Golden Fox Dao Venerable, for the Nine Vision Creed and Devil Curse Creed were currently the two most loyal hounds by his father’s side. One looks at the master before hitting the dogs.

Still, Jin Xiaoxiao wisely suppressed the fury boiling in her heart.

By now, she was clear that her Golden Fox Princess identity was useless in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu left leisurely.

Many Nine Vision Creed’s and Devil Curse Creed’s disciples followed behind them. These were all disciples who had submitted to Leiyu Creed, as for those that did not submit, all of them ended up like Li Dongjun and Yu Dong on the spot.

But before leaving, Lei Yu looked towards a certain location in the void and chuckled, “Silver Bug, we haven’t seen each other for so many years. I will make a trip to the Cliff Stone in the near future, and we’ll play hide and seek again!”

Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu drifted away, but Lei Yu’s words echoed above Xuan City. Others might not have understood what Lei Yu meant, but Stone Ancestor who had been hiding in the void looked like he had been struck by divine lightning of punishment, and his composure collapsed.

“Silver, silver bug!”

For how long he hadn’t heard this nickname? This nickname had been his nightmare for countless years. He thought he had forgotten that time, but those traumatizing memories returned with a sentence from Lei Yu.

“No, no!” Stone Ancestor, who was hiding in the void, suddenly shouted frantically, fleeing as he glanced in the direction Lei Yu had left with a horrified expression on his face.

The rest watched in silent confusion.

Fan Luo, who was watching from another hidden corner was inwardly bewildered by Stone Ancestor’s reaction.

He fell into contemplation as he looked in the direction Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu had left.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu left the Qiongqi Sacred Land, the news of Dao Jianchou, Nine Vision Creed’s young patriarch Li Dongjun, and Devil Curse Creed’s young patriarch Yu Dong’s extermination spread like wildfire through the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave.

The Golden Fox Heavenly Cave was boiling. Many were shocked and curious about Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu’s identities and origins.

“It is said Li Dongjun and Yu Dong directly turned to mush on the ground, exterminated right in front of the Golden Fox Princess. At that time, the Golden Fox Princess’ face was extremely ugly!”

“Anyone know who that young man is?! A powerful peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable like Dao Jianchou was killed by his subordinate with one finger! Isn’t that a bit too scary?! Even if that subordinate of his isn’t an Extermination List expert, he won’t be far away! No wonder when they were at the Heaven Seizing Inn, Panhu Creed’s Chen Huo and Devil Blade Creed’s Yang Dingtian’s head were burst open without any power to resist!”

“The Panhu Creed and Devil Blade Creed seem to have issued a bounty for that young man. I heard the Panhu Creed Patriarch and Devil Blade Creed Patriarch nearly pissed in their pants when they got the news!”

“The Panhu Creed and Devil Blade Creed are not the only ones, the Nine Vision Creed and Devil Curse Creed who also have grudges with the Lei Yu Creed are ants on a hot pan right now. The Nine Vision Creed and Devil Blade Creed have been planning to swallow up the Lei Yu Creed in recent days!”

Soon, another news spread.

“That young man is really going to the Nine Vision Creed’s headquarters on his three-headed beast mount!”
