Chapter 3020: Ice Soul Fruit?

Feeling the laws of the world contained in the Origin Holy World, Huang Xiaolong discovered that they were much stronger than the laws contained in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

“I came here once in the past, but a long time had passed since then…” Lei Yu sighed. The sights before him felt extremely familiar, yet distant at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised by Lei Yu’s sudden revelation. After all, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor remained in the Origin Holy World for a long time in the past before returning to the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Experts at the level of Lei Yu and Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor definitely left behind their inheritances in the form of a dao convergence before leaving.

“I wonder how those brats are…” Lei Yu muttered to himself.

He was referring to the disciples he accepted in the past. When he left the Origin Holy World, his disciples had barely broken through to the Dao Venerable Realm. After so many years, he had no idea how strong they were.

Huang Xiaolong soon asked about several matters regarding the Origin Holy World.

When he learned that the Leiyu Creed was the inheritance left behind by Lei Yu, he decided to head over for a look. “Let’s head over there before deciding on anything else.”

Even though his main objective was to locate Huang Shuai and retrieve the Huang Long Cape, he knew that he had to take things slow now that the Mystical Pavilion was embroiled in the matter.

“?!” Lei Yu was stunned for a second.

Nodding slowly, Huang Xiaolong confirmed his decision. After all, he wasn’t familiar with the Origin Holy World. He needed to settle down somewhere before starting an arduous battle with the Mystical Pavilion.

Understanding Huang Xiaolong’s intentions, Lei Yu headed straight for the Leiyu Creed.

Since the Origin Holy World was even larger than the Divine Tuo Holy World, the time it would take to travel between different regions would be longer than before! As the Leiyu Creed was located in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, they would need half a year before they could arrive!

During the journey there, Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle. He continued to study the arts of pill refinement and formations.

His understanding of the two arts was no longer at the same level it was before, but he was still extremely far away from being able to craft pills and lay down formations with a single thought!

Studying the two major arts were extremely useful to Huang Xiaolong, and it was extremely beneficial when he tried to comprehend the laws behind using the different elements.

Along the way, nothing happened to the two of them.

Finally stepping into the region where the Leiyu Creed was located, Huang Xiaolong pointed at a random sacred land and he muttered, “We’ll take a break there.”

Nodding respectfully, Lei Yu brought Huang Xiaolong over to the sacred land.

When they finally landed, Huang Xiaolong looked around him. He noticed that there was a village standing before them, and a warm glow enveloped the village as smoke curled up in the skies above the chimneys of the various houses laid around the area. It gave off an extremely homely feeling, and it was something Huang Xiaolong hadn’t experienced in a long time. His thoughts drifted and he felt as though he was back in his previous life…

Something seemed to sprout in his heart in that instant, and a sense of enlightenment washed over Huang Xiaolong. He felt as though a veil was parted before his eyes.

Riding on Lei Yu, Huang Xiaolong went straight towards the village.

Hiding their auras the best they could, the lightning qi around Lei Yu was nowhere to be seen. He looked like an ordinary three headed beast, and nothing like his former formidable self.

When they finally entered the village, Huang Xiaolong saw groups of people wearing simple clothing gathered together. Some were tending to crops, and others were dealing with the corpses of some beasts. It was clear the meat of the beasts slain was the main source of food for the villagers.

Even though many villagers felt that it was strange for Huang Xiaolong to appear riding a beast, no one stopped him.

When they passed a field, Huang Xiaolong saw stalks of unknown crops rising several tens of meters high. The crops were as large as his thumb, and every individual stalk shone like jade. There seemed to be some sort of fire burning in them, and Huang Xiaolong could feel the rich energy contained in them.

“This is called the Fiery Light Maize..” Lei Yu explained. “It’s a pretty good crop found in the Origin Holy World. It’s the main source of food for core disciples in sacred lands. Even inner disciples of various dao convergences would eat the Fiery Light Maize for every meal.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

Even though refining spiritual pills was a faster way to cultivate, refining pills were extremely troublesome. They even had to sacrifice a ton of spiritual stones in order to cultivate a furnace full of pills, and crops with spiritual energy were a great alternative.

Even though the Fiery Light Maize couldn’t be compared to holy pills, its effects wouldn’t be much weaker than one if a cultivator ate the Fiery Light Maize for a long time. Naturally, spiritual liquid was needed to grow crops at that level.

“I’ve heard that the Fiery Light Maize tastes pretty good…” Lei Yu chuckled. “Who would have thought that this village would be able to produce them!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “We should really try some if it’s as good as you say!”

The two of them continued onwards, and a mesmerizing fragrance drifted up their nostrils all of a sudden.

“Amazing!” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but cry out in shock.

“That’s the smell of cooked Fiery Light Maize.” Lei Yu took a deep breath before laughing casually.

Following the scent, the two of them arrived before a massive courtyard.

Peering into the courtyard, Huang Xiaolong saw two people cooking the Fiery Light Maize over a fire. One of them was old, and the other was young! They cooked the Fiery Light Maize in a special pot, and the mouth watering fragrance filled the entire area. The youngster added firewood to the roaring flames beneath the pot, and Huang Xiaolong noticed that the firewood was no ordinary one. It came from a spiritual tree, and it was clear that cooking the Fiery Light Maize wasn’t as easy as it seemed.

When the two of them noticed Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu, they were shocked.

“Old man, we’re passing by and we noticed the smell. We hope we can have a taste of whatever you’re cooking!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Of course, we can give you holy coins for your trouble.” As soon as he spoke, he took out a single holy coin.

The holy coin was something Huang Xiaolong prepared ever since he learned about the Origin Holy World from Lei Yu.

In the Origin Holy World, currencies were split up into gold, spiritual, holy, and dao coins.

“Holy coins?!” The youngster who was adding firewood to the flames jumped in joy. He ran over to Huang Xiaolong and grabbed the coin. The flames used to cook the Fiery Light Maize was the least of his concerns as he started looking at the holy coin in his hand. Pouring the energy in his body into the holy coin, the kid eventually opened his mouth to bite on it.

“It’s real!” The youngster laughed in amazement.

Lines started appearing on Huang Xiaolong's forehead. It was a mere holy coin. If they were able to feast on the Fiery Light Maize, why would they be so worked up over one holy coin?!

The white haired old man laughed softly in response. “If you don’t mind the rough taste of the Fiery Light Maize, you’re welcome to join us. It should be done soon.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and he sat down in the courtyard. Lei Yu sat beside him.

“This lord… Your beast should be one from the ancient times, yes?” The old haired elder chuckled.

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. The old man might be a True Saint Realm expert, but there was no way he could recognize Lei Yu.

The Fiery Light Maize became ready, and the youngster got a bowl ready for Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu.

Swallowing a mouthful, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the Fiery Light Maize dissolved in his mouth. It was fragrant, and there was a tart sweetness to it. Overall, Huang Xiaolong found it pleasant.

As he ate, he started chatting with the white haired elder. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Lord, are you here for the Ice Soul Fruit?” The white haired elder asked all of a sudden.

Ice Soul Fruit? Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

“Your Highness, the Ice Soul Fruit is a type of holy herb in the Origin Holy World.” Lei Yu’s voice rang out in Huang Xiaolong’s mind when he saw the look of confusion on his face.
