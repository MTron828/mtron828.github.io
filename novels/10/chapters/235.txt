Chapter 236: Chen Tianqi’s Suspicion

Go for a few drinks?! Gao Yong looked at Huang Xiaolong in a daze. In the next moment, his young blood boiled, coursing through his veins with excitement, and his heartbeat turned cartwheels in his chest. However, on the surface he only managed to nod his agreement in stiff movements.

Before long, Gao Yong followed Huang Xiaolong, leaving the Dawn River Street. The entire way, Gao Yong felt as if he was floating on a cloud, nothing could hook him back to earth.

When Huang Xiaolong reached the outside of the Southern Hill Estate, Huang Peng and Su Yan craned their necks as they waited for him at the front entrance. The moment Su Yan spotted Huang Xiaolong’s figure appearing on the horizon, she hurried out in a few steps, pulling Huang Xiaolong into a hug, “Long’er, you’re finally home!”

Being embraced in public by his mother at his age made Huang Xiaolong slightly embarrassed, but he clearly felt Su Yan’s motherly love and longing for her son. Recalling the fact these years he had mostly been apart from his family, either away or cultivating, spending very little time with them, a trace of guilt rose in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

“Yes Mother, I’m back!” Huang Xiaolong affirmed. Inwardly, his heart soured.

“Good, good, as long as our son comes back safely. There are so many people here, Yan’er, don’t embarrass our son, let us go in first.” Huang Peng came to his son’s rescue at this moment, comforting his wife at the same time.

Only then did Su Yan release her son. She knew her son’s identity and status were no longer the same, hugging in public like this was indeed embarrassing.

“Big brother!” Huang Min stood in front of her big brother while smiling sheepishly in happiness.

Huang Xiaolong laughed watching his younger sister, “Your wedding’s in two days’ time, your Big brother made an effort to rush back. Thankfully, I made it in time!”

“Big bro!” Huang Min’s eyes turned red-rimmed instantly. She too rushed up and hugged Huang Xiaolong for some time before letting go. Huang Xiaolong studied his sister’s loveable, delicate face as he lifted his right hand to wipe away the tears flowing from the corner of Huang Min’s eyes, he was pleased and content: the little girl finally grew up.

He could clearly recall as if it was yesterday when he used to sneak out to the back mountain to practice the Body Metamorphose Scripture, a little girl used to go all the way up the hill to look for him.

More than ten years had passed... in the blink of an eye.

After the New Year, the little girl would be nineteen, and he, twenty.

“You’re old enough to get married yet you still cry like a little kid. Come, let’s go in.” Huang Xiaolong smiled, teasing Huang Min.

Huang Min nodded in agreement, tears turning into a spurt of laughter. Hence, Huang Xiaolong, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others standing at the door went into Southern Estate Manor’s great hall, where lively words and sounds of laughter continued.

Two days later was Huang Min’s big wedding day, and Huang Xiaolong’s return heightened the festive atmosphere building up in the Southern Hill Estate. Huang Xiaolong was the backbone of the Huang Family, if Huang Xiaolong was unable to make it back in time for Huang Min’s wedding, the celebration and atmosphere would have felt lacking in some way.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong left the great hall and went back to his courtyard. Summoning Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Fei Hou over, inquiring over the matters over the past two years in the Southern Hill Estate. The three of them respectively reported the matters under their charge one by one.

According to their reports, the Nine Tripod Commerce was established successfully in Duanren Imperial City, and had opened many branches in Duanren Empire’s main cities. Due to Emperor Duanren’s strong support, progress and business was good, laying a good foundation. In less than two years’ time, the daily revenues had exceeded three to four thousand gold coins.

With Nine Tripod Commerce’s development, Huang Xiaolong believed that within thirty to forty years, it would become one of the top four companies in Duanren Empire.

“Any movements from Yao Fei or the Deities Templar?” Huang Xiaolong asked. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhao Shu shook his head, “Ever since the battle in Duanren Institute where Yao Fei was rescued by that person from Deities Templar, he did not show himself again. There were no movements from Deities Templar.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Tighten the estate’s patrol for the next two days.”

“Sovereign, you mean to say Yao Fei and Deities Templar might use Miss Huang Min’s wedding day to make trouble?” Zhang Fu asked his doubt.

“The possibility exists, there’s nothing wrong with being extra careful.” Huang Xiaolong said.

The Yao Family’s Manor, its foundation, its headquarters was burned to the ground by him, Yao Fei and the Yao Ancestor fled like dogs with their tails between their legs. No doubt they would retaliate sooner or later.

Huang Xiaolong had a feeling, on the day of his sister Huang Min’s wedding, something would happen.

“Sovereign, there’s something this Subordinate wishes to report.” At this point, Zhao Shu interjected.

“Oh, speak.” Huang Xiaolong permitted.

“Both of us, me and Zhang Fu, left Asura’s Gate headquarters and Main Domain Chief Chen Tianqi might have become suspicious of something going on. He...has sent people over to Snow Wind Continent.” Zhao Shu hesitated before revealing the latter information.

Huang Xiaolong looked over, a light flickering in his eyes. Has Chen Tianqi finally become aware of his existence?!

However, it had been quite some time since Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu left Asura’s Gate, thus it was normal for Chen Tianqi to be suspicious. Since Chen Tianqi took the first step by sending someone over, it was safe to assume he might soon come over the the Snow Wind Continent himself as well. He knew this was inevitable, sooner or later it would arrive.

Perhaps the day when he and Chen Tianqi finally meet would be the day when they compete for the Asura’s Gate Sovereign throne.

“Asura’s Gate Sovereign!” The Asura Ring on Huang Xiaolong’s finger gleamed.

Huang Xiaolong planned to go against Deities Templar, and it would be an almost impossible feat relying only on himself, therefore Huang Xiaolong must capture Asura’s gate Sovereign position. Control Asura’s Gate and its million disciples.

“In fact, Sovereign need not worry too much for now. Sovereign possesses the Asura Ring, the rightful successor appointed by the Old Sovereign. Even if Main Domain Chief Chen Tianqi arrives here, he can’t do anything to Sovereign!” Zhang Fu spoke.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in silence.

Though Zhang Fu said so, if he wanted full control of Asura’s Gate he must first subjugate Chen Tianqi!

“Sovereign, did you manage to enter the Buddha Cavern in your trip to the Blessed Buddha Empire?” Zhao Shu glanced at Huang Xiaolong, and cautiously asked the question he had been burning to know the answer to.

Zhang Fu and Fei Hou quickly turned their attention onto Huang Xiaolong. Detecting the subtle expressions on the trio, Huang Xiaolong could guess what was going inside their minds. Smiling slightly, he nodded, “Yes, Godly Mt. Xumi has been reined in by me.” It wasn’t necessary to keep the matter a secret from them, they would learn about it one way or another.

Time seemed to paused for a moment for Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Fei Hou. Then all three dropped to their knee in salute, excitedly lauding: “Sovereign invincible throughout!”

“Sovereign invincible throughout!”

The Godly Mt. Xumi!

The number one treasure listed on the Heavenly Treasure, it was beyond their imagination that one day their Asura’s Gate Sovereign would successfully rein it!

That was the legendary Godly Mt. Xumi, ah, a treasure rumored to possess the most unbelievable power in this world for severals thousands of years.

Thinking of this, all three of them couldn’t help but shiver excitedly.

The truth was, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu weren’t fully confident in Huang Xiaolong wrestling the Asura’s Gate Sovereign position from Chen Tianqi. Now, however, they had no qualms fully standing behind Huang Xiaolong. If he could even rein in heavenly treasures such the Godly Mt. Xumi, would there be things he cannot do?!

“Stand up.” Huang Xiaolong looked at the three people kneeling, said.

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and Fei Hou acknowledged respectfully before rising to a stand.

“Pay attention to the supply of grade one spirit stones, I want to procure a batch of grade one spirit stones.” Huang Xiaolong then added.

A batch?! All three were stupefied.
