After a month had passed, the Hundred Spirits Beast King gradually fell under the wind against Huang Xiaolong. In fact, it was having a hard time trying to dodge his attacks.

Falling into this unbearable situation made the Hundred Spirits Beast King palpitate with dread, as well as anger. Its roars thundered inside the gray space, but it was powerless to change the situation. It never expected the young human to have so many Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets!

In this one month, Huang Xiaolong’s Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets seemed endless, every time he was injured he would pop one into his mouth. Moreover, it was infuriated that Huang Xiaolong’s physical toughness was above what it had first assumed, it was even stronger than an average Second Order Highgod Realm masters’ physical body.

Although this finding was quite absurd, the Hundred Spirits Beast King couldn’t deny this fact. It also wondered who this human was to possess the Glory of the Water God Divine Armor. This divine armor was known to have the most powerful defensive abilities in the four galaxies!

It also noticed that Huang Xiaolong possessed a kind of ability that, when activated, enabled him to recover from injuries at a rapid speed, even replenishing his exhausted god battle qi.

‘What kind of freakish existence is this ah?!’

The Hundred Spirits Beast King even suspected that Huang Xiaolong was the reincarnation of a powerful Heavenly God from the Divine World. No, even a Heavenly God’s reincarnation couldn’t be this monstrous!

Two months later, after being bombarded by Huang Xiaolong and the attacks from his Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire spirits, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head was littered with injuries. It finally felt the danger of death.

But, no matter how it begged and tempted him, Huang Xiaolong’s attacks continued to rain down.

Huang Xiaolong held steadfast to his intention; destroying the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s will inside this head and refine it!

Finally, after a little over three months, the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire spirits turned into an icy blue and crimson red light that pierced through the giant head’s forehead. The Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head forever fell into silence.

Watching the silent Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head, Huang Xiaolong let out a great sigh of relief, heavily panting as he fell butt down on the floor. He wiped off the sweat on his forehead only to find his sleeve damp.

‘I finally defeated this Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head!’

Thinking back to those three months of bitter battle with the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head, Huang Xiaolong inwardly shuddered. If he didn’t have close to ten thousand Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets inside his Asura Ring, if he didn’t possess the Instant Recovery ability, even with the aid of both divine fires he would have died right here!

Although the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires were powerful, Huang Xiaolong himself had yet to become a Highgod Realm master. Without the force of a godhead, he could hardly display even a tenth of both divine fires’ true power.

“I need to refine another batch of pills when I get back.” Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly.

Three months of continuous battle had almost depleted his entire supply of Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets. He had accumulated so many divine pills only after a decade of refining.

Some time later, Huang Xiaolong finally dragged himself up to his feet. Looking at the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head, his face showed undisguisable jubilation.

The time had come to collect his harvest!

He no longer hesitated. In a leap, Huang Xiaolong hovered in the air above the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head, he then sat down in a cross-legged position and circulated the Asura Tactics as he began the refinement of the giant head.

After completely expelling the gray demonic qi from the giant monkey head below, strands of Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence began to float into Huang Xiaolong’s body. The Treasure Dragon diagram within him appeared, glimmering as it greedily devoured the blood essence.

Multiple strands of pure energy spread to every corner of Huang Xiaolong’s body, both his dantian and Qi Sea were roaring with joy.

The two spirits of the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires were hovering around Huang Xiaolong. Opening their mouths wide, they also absorbed the energy from the Hundred Spirits Beast King blood essence.

Asura qi formed a domain around him, growing darker and denser. Ghosts and demons howled within, and the voice of the Asura grew clearer.

At the same time, the black and blue dragons flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, their roars echoing throughout the gray space.

Time passed by.

As he continued to refine the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence, Huang Xiaolong could feel the time and space threads within his soul sea strengthening, moreover, the clarity and brightness of his soul was blinding. His soul sea quivered, showing signs of being on the verge of condensing a godhead.

Huang Xiaolong tensed up.

To many God Realm cultivators condensing their godhead was a lifelong dream, but Huang Xiaolong felt differently. More accurately, he didn’t want to condense his godhead at this moment.

He was aware that, based on his current soul clarity, it absolutely hadn’t reached the requirements to form the king of all godheads.

Huang Xiaolong quickly focused his attention, repressing the energy fluctuations within his soul sea again and again. At the same time, he also repressed the true immortal essence force in his dantian and his god battle qi, hoping they could absorb more of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence.

As expected, after being repressed again and again, the turbulent energy fluctuations in his soul sea gradually calmed down.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh in relief.

Even then, he dared not relax his vigilance as he continued to repress his true immortal essence force and god battle qi.

One year passed, two years, three years, four years...

Huang Xiaolong already lost count how many times he had repressed his true immortal essence and god battle qi, he only knew that after being repressed multiple times the true immortal essence force in his dantian and the god battle qi in his Qi Sea became sparkling bright, as if they had changed somehow.

After four years passed, blood essence stopped floating out from the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head, completely absorbed. Just as Huang Xiaolong thought he was done, colorful spheres of light floated up from the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head. They seemed to be made of liquid, yet also mist at the same time.

These colorful spheres of light were the soul energy contained inside the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head, many times more precious than its blood essence.

The soul sea was the place where the godhead was formed, and where a person’s soul force resided.

The Hundred Spirits Beast King was the most powerful master of the demonic beast clan, to the point where several Highgod Realm masters’ besiegement still couldn’t kill it. One could only imagine how powerful its soul force was. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despite its soul force being suppressed for many years by the altar’s sealing formation, resulting in close to half of it having dwindled, the remaining force was still horrifying.

As the colorful, misty spheres of light containing soul force entered Huang Xiaolong’s body, his soul sea once again burst out with blinding light.

His soul force rose at an alarming speed.

Looking from afar, spheres of colorful, misty light merged together above Huang Xiaolong.

Another thirteen years passed.

The colorful spheres of light finally stopped floating out from the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s head. With a clear crisp sound, the giant head disappeared from the world.

The demonic qi inside the gray space lessened and dispersed.

However, Huang Xiaolong remained as he was in the air above the altar, continuously circulating the Asura Tactics.

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong finally stopped, opening his eyes.

The gray space shook, as if Huang Xiaolong’s gaze contained indescribable power.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked ahead. He hardly moved, but the fabric of space was ripped apart, leaving a gaping black hole several kilometers in diameter.
