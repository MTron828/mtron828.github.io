Chapter 3620 – I’m Doing Great

When they finally opened their eyes, they were dumbfounded.

So were Yang Rong and Chen Hui.

“Creation… Creation artifacts!”

They had seen creation artifacts in their lives, but that was the first time they were seeing so many of them in one place!

Huang Xiaolong practically had an entire armory in his spatial ring. There were all types of creation artifacts in there and after counting, there were more than five hundred of them!

More than five hundred creation artifacts!

From low-grade creation artifacts all the way to the top-grade ones Huang Xiaolong had all of them!

There were axes, blades, swords, spears, halberds, whips, knives, spikes, hammers, and a ton more! There was even a top-grade creation-level flying ship!

In fact, Huang Xiaolong only brought out a part of the treasures he had. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After so many years, Huang Xiaolong dealt with too many Gods of Creation and he plundered their treasuries. He no longer bothered counting and he kept all the good stuff for himself. If he only counted the creation artifacts he had, he had more than a thousand! Those he brought out were those he didn’t like!

However, they were more than enough to dazzle Kong Lei, Cao Ze, and the others.

A gulp could be heard in the distance as someone from the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce broke the silence.

“I’m sure these are more than enough to trade for all the universe-level spiritual veins you have.”

Kong Lei snapped back to reality.

“Of… Of course they are!” Kong Lei forced a smile.

“I’ll take everything you have, including that.” Huang Xiaolong was naturally referring to the spiritual vein Cao Ze had his eyes on.

Cao Ze’s expression sank.

“Brat, don’t even think of scaring us off with your creation artifacts.” One of the guards behind Cao Ze sneered, “Even Wu Qifeng wouldn’t dare to act so arrogantly in front of our young master.”

The two guards around Cao Ze weren’t weak and they were at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm just like Cao Ze. Both of them had more than 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand to send the guard who spoke flying into a giant pillar in the main hall.

The pillar turned to dust under the impact.

The Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce trembled.

Everyone who came felt the ground beneath their feet trembling.

“What’s going on?!”

“Did someone go crazy? Who in the world has the guts to make a move in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?”

Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

When they saw Cao Ze’s guard lying motionlessly in the rubble, no one dared to make a sound.

Everyone who entered the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce were important figures in the Limitless Land. They knew who Cao Ze was and they didn’t expect someone to make a move on his subordinates!

They turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

When Cao Ze finally processed what had happened, his expression sank. As rage filled his heart, he realized that his strength was probably comparable to his guards at best and attacking Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the greatest idea. Turning to look at Kong Lei, Cao Ze hoped that he could obtain a reasonable explanation from the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce now that his subordinate was injured in their territory.

Kong Lei was well aware of the look in Cao Ze’s eyes. Moreover, he was angry that Huang Xiaolong would make a move in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. Even though Huang Xiaolong had brought out a ton of creation artifacts, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce wasn’t a place he could do as he liked!

“You’re going too far!” Kong Lei glared at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “My Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce isn’t a place you can run rampant!”

“So what if I do? What are you going to do about it?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Preposterous!” One of the experts standing behind Kong Lei roared and charged at Huang Xiaolong.

Qian Jun was the vice director of the branch and he wasn’t weaker when compared to Kong Lei. He was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. As his hands turned into a giant claw that reached towards Huang Xiaolong, the void around them trembled.

It was too bad his claw was held in place by an arm that appeared from nowhere before it could arrive.

The arm that extended out from the void didn’t belong to Huang Xiaolong. Instead, it belonged to a slightly chubby middle aged man.

No one knew when, but three figures appeared beside Huang Xiaolong.

When Yang Rong and Chen Hui were trying to guess their identities, Kong Lei, Qian Jun, Cao Ze, and several other supreme experts in the crowd yelled, “Lord… Lord Zhou Chi, Lord Lin Qiankun, Lord Rong Hua!”

“What?!” Yang Rong and Chen Hui felt their bodies trembling as they stared at the three newcomers in disbelief.

They couldn’t help but think back to what Huang Xiaolong said.

Could they actually be…

The person who stopped Qian Jun’s claw was Rong Hua, the weakest of the three!

Rong Hua stared at Qian Jun with a cold gaze as he casually flicked his wrist. A terrifying wave of power emerged from his body and sent the man flying. He flew straight towards Kong Lei.

“Be careful!” Kong Lei’s expression changed drastically. He reached out to help Qian Jun and so did the dozens of experts around him.

It was too bad they were no match for someone at Rong Hua’s level. Despite their numbers, they were sent stumbling backwards.

They only managed to find their footing after reaching the edge of the hall.

Cracks started to form in the wall behind them as the shockwave crashed into it.

Rong Hua barely used half his strength to send all of them flying earlier. If he were to go all out, everyone in the hall would be crushed!

After all, Kong Lei and the others were merely God of Creation Realm experts at the grand completion stage. They weren’t half step Universe Gods like Rong Hua and Lin Qiankun!

Everyone in the hall who were waiting for a good show to play out stared at the sudden change in situation, flabbergasted.

Lord Zhou Chi of the Ice Mountain!

Lin Qiankun, the old ancestor of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire!

Rong Hua, the old ancestor of the Glorious Celestial Empire!

What the f*ck?! Three half step Universe Gods appeared at once!

One of the three was also one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land!

When everyone was shocked by their presence, the three of them turned towards Huang Xiaolong in unison and bowed, “Lord, are you alright?”

Lord?! Kong Lei and the experts who barely managed to crawl to their feet fell back down when they heard how they addressed Huang Xiaolong.

Cao Ze’s expression was the ugliest.

Yang Rong and Chen Hui’s eyes widened in shock and they found it hard to breathe.

It was true!

“I’m doing great! What trouble can I be in?” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Zhou Chi and the others heaved a sigh of relief. “Of course… We were worried for nothing.”

Everyone who was present felt their throats going dry when they saw the respectful expressions on the faces of Zhou Chi and the other two. They had no idea what to do now that such a terrifying figure was standing before them.
