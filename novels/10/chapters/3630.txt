Chapter 3631 – Take Him Down!

“Three Gods Halberd!”

Ye Ye and Wu Xin yelled the instant they saw the weapon.

They charged at Huang Xiaolong in unison.

Their reactions were quick and their actions were ruthless.

Instead of hiding, Huang Xiaolong waved the Three Gods Halberd to welcome their assault.

The instant it shot out, rays of light filled the skies. Everyone felt as though the Sleepless Sea was drained of energy as all of it gathered on the tip of the halberd.

Wu Xin and Ye Ye gasped in fright. They summoned their pseudo universe treasures instantly in a desperate attempt to block Huang Xiaolong’s strike.

Wu Xin used a giant blade while Ye Ye used a halberd. From what it seemed, Ye Ye’s halberd was based on the design of the Three Gods Halberd!

Whatever the case, the two of them were far too weak compared to Huang Xiaolong. No matter in terms of treasures or cultivation, they were far too lacking. When the Three Gods Halberd came into contact with the two weapons, they shattered instantly!

The shards of their weapons flew back towards them without any mercy.

Pushing themselves to the limit, Ye Ye and Wu Xin could only use their fists to defend themselves against the shards and the incoming Three Gods Halberd.

Bang!

Trembling slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t let up as the Three Gods Halberd swept towards the two of them.

It sliced through the divine armor on their bodies effortlessly. In the face of such a terrifying weapon, their clothes and armor were comparable to soft tofu! The impact of the strike wasn’t soft either and the two of them were sent flying.

A loud blast rang through the skies as the two of them smashed into the walls surrounding the city.

Wu Tianyu and the others could see the bones that were revealed by the wounds Huang Xiaolong inflicted.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath.

Ye Ye and Wu Xin could be considered monsters in their own right! It was especially so for Wu Xin who was an ancient existence! He managed to survive the ancient universe tribulation with his fleshy body alone, and his physical body should possess a terrifying level of defense! Even so, he was nearly sliced in two by Huang Xiaolong!

Despite their severe wounds, the two of them got to their feet. Even though they were shocked by the power of the Three Gods Halberd, they were even more surprised by the strength Huang Xiaolong possessed!

Experts weaker than Wu Xin and Ye Ye might have noticed the overwhelming power of the halberd, but the two of them realized how strong Huang Xiaolong was!

If they were strictly talking about strength, the youngster before them would definitely rank among the top ten in the Unknown Space!

No… He might be even stronger than that!

Cupping their fists in fright, Ye Ye bowed respectfully, “We offended Lord Blue Dragon earlier… Please forgive us.”

“That’s right. We unknowingly offended Lord Blue Dragon… Please forgive us.” Wu Xin did the same.

Wu Tianyu and the others felt their jaws dropping in fright when they heard what their leaders said. That was the first time they saw the two leaders acting so humbly!

“Offended me unknowingly?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “Don’t you wish to grab my Three Gods Halberd?”

A flame ignited in their hearts once again when they thought about the universe treasure in his hand. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Lord, you must be joking!” Wu Xin suppressed the greed in his heart and laughed.

“Actually, I’m here to achieve a single goal.” Huang Xiaolong turned serious all of a sudden.

The hearts of those present tightened.

“Alright, it doesn’t matter if I tell you… I’m from the Thirteen Universes!” Huang Xiaolong declared.

“Thirteen Universes!” The members of the Limitless Land gasped in shock. The Blue Dragon Young Master actually came from the thirteen universes!

“I came to the Unknown Space to look for a group of subordinates.” He paused for a second when he spoke up to this point.

Even though he didn’t finish his sentence, the members standing around him knew what he meant. Their expression sank instantly.

Wu Xin sneered with rage, “Blue Dragon Young Master, you have to be kidding me. Do you think we will submit to you?!”

Ye Ye continued, “Are you stuck in a day dream?”

“Well, you’ll know if I’m day dreaming in a bit.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

“You might be strong, but do you really think that you can suppress my Ocean Race by yourself?!” With rays of light emerging from his body, the wound in his chest closed and he yelled, “Attack! All of you, activate the Sleepless Formation! Kill!”

“Members of my Limitless Celestial Empire, listen to me! Lay down the Limitless Formation and take him down right now!” Wu Xin roared.

The moment their orders left their lips, the experts of the two factions sprung into action.

Streams of blue light emerged from the heads of the experts from the Ocean Race. An ancient power hidden deep in their bloodlines started to activate.

The entire Sleepless Sea started to tremble.

The originally calm surface of the sea was broken by waves millions of miles high.

A terrifying power covered the entire sea.

In that instant, everyone felt as though a mountain was pressing down on their bodies.

As for the members of the Limitless Celestial Empire, they did pretty much the same thing as the members of the Ocean Race. A boundless strength seemed to emerge from the depths of the space.

Huang Xiaolong was completely impassive when he looked at them. No longer holding back, Huang Xiaolong activated all three great worlds as grand cosmos energy poured out of his body. More than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy filled the skies around.

Boom!

As soon as he revealed his strength, the entire city sank by several inches. It was clear that the meticulously refined city was unable to withstand the power coming from Huang Xiaolong!

Soon after, the ground started to crack as the structures around them started to crumble.

Ye Ye and Wu Xin felt despair forming in their hearts.

“Are you already…”

“That’s right. I have already crossed the 20 billion mark.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Moreover, I have three great worlds!”

“Three?!” Everyone gasped in fright.

As Huang Xiaolong’s aura continued to rise, the Sleepless City that had existed for god knew how many years, started to crumble.

Like dominoes, the building in the city fell one by one!
