Chapter 2432: Who’s The Despicable One?

Guo Chang looked at Huang Xiaolong coldly as he said, “Brat, you must have eaten a leopard’s gut. How dare you steal something from my Ancient Emperor Holy Gate? Die!” Without any warning, he sent a palm strike towards Huang Xiaolong.

Not only was Guo Chang a high-level True Saint, but he was a strong one too. He could shatter an entire continent with a single palm strike! Chen Zhi and the others, who were standing beside Huang Xiaolong felt as though their bodies were blown to bits.

They had no thoughts of resistance at all as their movements were sealed off. All they could do was blink as they watched how Guo Chang’s palm flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

Just as his palm was about to smash Huang Xiaolong to smithereens, Huang Xiaolong’s body emitted rays of golden light as a terrifying strength emerged out of nowhere.

The power that appeared was stronger than anything they had ever witnessed before. It was above the heavens, and it was stronger than any being they had ever seen. It even surpassed the holy laws of the world, and it gave off a feeling of invincibility.

When Guo Chang felt the sudden burst of strength, he retreated hastily as the expression on his face changed.

However, he was still a step too slow.

Boom!

The force instantly shattered Guo Chang’s palm, and his body was sent flying through the air as though a supreme hammer had slammed into him. He blasted through god knew how many mountain peaks before falling like a dead dog on the ground billions of miles away.

Bang!

The Devil Fetus Mountain Range shook as dust filled the air.

Everyone turned to stare at him in shock.

“This?!” Shi Feng cried out involuntarily, “The strength of a Primal Ancestor!”

Strength of a Primal Ancestor!

“What?! Primal Ancestor?!” Zhang Yihui, who was yelling at Guo Chang to kill Huang Xiaolong, nearly fell to the ground in terror.

Indeed, Huang Xiaolong had unleashed the power of a Primal Ancestor. It was left behind by the Heavenly Master, and he had three other strands of energy to protect himself. His masters had left behind a trace of their power in case he ran into mortal danger. He could defend himself against the attacks of those beneath the Primal Ancestor Realm four times!

In other words, Huang Xiaolong could protect himself against four strikes that would spell certain death for him!

As Guo Chang crawled out from the pit, blood flowed down his body, and his armor was shattered beyond repair.

“You... Who in the world are you?!” Guo Chang looked at Huang Xiaolong in horror.

Ignoring the man, Huang Xiaolong tossed a token towards Shi Feng.

With question marks popping up in his mind, Shi Feng received the token thrown at him. When he noticed the insignia on it, he jumped in fright, and he ran towards Huang Xiaolong respectfully. With both hands, he handed the token over. “Shi Feng greets Young Master Huang Xiaolong!”

“What?! Huang... Huang Xiaolong?!” Guo Chang, and Zhang Yihui yelled in shock.

This youngster in front of them was actually Huang Xiaolong!

They had attended the apprenticeship ceremony previously, and met the man himself. However, Huang Xiaolong had changed his appearance and they couldn’t recognize him.

Retrieving his jade token, Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

Guo Chang sneered all of a sudden, “Even if you’re Huang Xiaolong of the Holy Heavens, you can’t steal something that belongs to my Ancient Emperor Holy Gate! You might be the direct disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, but your behavior is nothing more than of a petty thief’s! Don’t you think you owe us an explanation?!”

“That’s right, even if you are the direct disciple of the four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens, you don’t get the right to steal out grandmist holy spiritual aura!” Another vice hall master from the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate walked forward and said angrily, “Senior Shi Feng, how do you think we should handle this?”

Of course, they believed Zhang Yihui and thought that Huang Xiaolong was the one who had made a move to steal something their young master had obtained.

Shi Feng couldn’t help but feel embarrassed.

While it was true that Huang Xiaoong was the direct disciple of the four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens, they would still have to cough up an explanation if he stole something from the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Moreover, his friendship with Guo Chang couldn’t be ignored. As such, he couldn’t make a decision regarding the matter. When all was said and done, Huang Xiaolong was the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens. How could a mere hall master like him capture the most important disciple the Holy Heavens had accepted?! Was he stronger than four Primal Ancestors?!

“This... Young Master Huang...?” Shi Feng hesitated as he asked Huang Xiaolong.

After glancing at Shi Feng, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on Guo Chang, “Guo Chang, your Ancient Emperor Holy Gate is really daring. You’re crazy if you try to slander me into giving up my treasures... Do you really think that I, Huang Xiaolong, am a pushover?”

Guo Chang’s face flushed red with anger when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You... Huang Xiaolong, you are shameless and despicable!”

The two other deputy hall masters from the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate glared at Huang Xiaolong as they didn’t expect the direct disciple of the four Primal Ancestors to act so shamelessly.

Shi Feng and the others from the Holy Heavens frowned. They hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to act like a despicable thief.

Just as Chen Zhi, Yu Ming, and the others were about to speak up, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and stared at Zhang Yihui coldly. “Zhang Yihui, who’s the despicable one here? Who’s the shameless one? You should be clearer than all of us here.”

Zhang Yihui looked at Huang Xiaolong with a face full of anger, “You... You’re slandering me!”

An Li and the others started screaming about how Huang Xiaolong was in the wrong.

“Slandering you?” Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Do you dare to receive my soul search for you to speak about everything that happened previously?”

Zhang Yihui panicked instalnly, but the calm expression on his face didn’t fade. “What a joke! Do you really think that’s possible? Who knows if you’ll do something behind my back? You might even force me to say that you were the one who found the grandmist holy spiritual aura!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted in response, “Alright, since you are afraid that I might do something behind your back, then why not let Guo Chang do it instead? Are you afraid he’ll do something to you?”

Zhang Yihui entered full-blown panic mode, and he started to defend himself maniacally. “The grandmist holy spiritual aura was discovered by our Ancient Emperor Holy Gate! Why should I listen to you?!”

“Are you scared?”

Zhang Yihui laughed out loud, “Huang Xiaolong, don’t try to twist your words! I’m not scared of you at all! There’s no need for a search!” Everyone could see that he was merely putting on a tough front.

The look of anger on Guo Chang and the other deputy hall masters of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate disappeared instantly. A look of trepidation could be seen when they turned to stare at Zhang Yihui. The other party was the disciple of four Primal Ancestors for f*ck’s sake!

“Hall Master Shi Feng, report this matter to my four masters, and they shall deal with it.”

Guo Chang and everyone else from the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate felt their hearts skip a beat. Their expressions changed, and they knew that if the four Primal Ancestors demanded an explanation, then they would be in serious trouble.

“Yes, Young Master!” Shi Feng said respectfully before giving Zhang Yihui a cold look.

The gaze in his eyes when he looked at Guo Chang and the others became a lot more distant.

“Let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong said as he soared through the skies.

Shi Feng and the others didn’t dare to dally as they flew behind him.

“Brother Shi Feng!” Guo Chang hurriedly called out. However, Shi Feng acted as if he hadn’t heard anything and followed behind Huang Xiaolong. It didn’t take long for the figures of Huang Xiaolong and those around him to disappear into the mist covering the Purple Clouds Sea.
