Chapter 3706: Fighting the Ghost Devil King

“Brother Devil, can we stop the creation of the formation if we kill the king behind the Extermination Formation?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The Ferocious Devil nodded his head and said in a serious voice, “That’s right. Not everyone can lay down the Extermination Formation. In the past, the Black Nether King probably taught one of the kings how to do it.”

“Wouldn’t that mean that someone other than the Black Nether King is responsible for the formation? Even if we kill him, the Black Nether King will be able to take over!”

The Ferocious Devil sighed. “Of course, I know that. However, we can only choose to delay them by killing the other person setting up the formation. If we fail to do anything, the Thirteen Universes will undergo the destruction tribulation. Once it starts, we won’t be able to stop it.”

Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a moment and muttered, “I shall travel over to the Universe First Race to look for the king responsible for the formation…”

A trace of joy filled the Ferocious Devil’s heart. “That would be for the best. It’s too bad all of us are cursed by the previous destruction tribulation and won’t be able to follow you there…”

He could only travel over alone.

“It’s alright. When I arrive in the Universe First Race, I’ll definitely discover the person who laid down the formation. I’ll capture him and bring him back here.”

A serious expression appeared on the Ferocious Devil’s face. “When you arrive, you have to be careful not to expose your whereabouts…”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had already reached the peak of the grand completion stage, his fate would be sealed if his tracks were exposed.

“Of course.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

He knew how important it was to remain untraceable in the territory of the Universe First Race.

Even at his current level, there were at least three experts in the Universe First Race no weaker than him!

The Black Nether King, White Feather King, and the Star Refining King were experts whose strength he couldn’t underestimate.

The other two might not be comparable to the Black Nether King, but their combat strength had long since surpassed the 29 billion mark.

The White Feather King was comparable to the Ferocious Devil and his combat strength had reached the 29.9 billion mark.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about several matters regarding the Universe First Race. The Ferocious Devil didn’t leave anything out as he told Huang Xiaolong everything he knew.

Half a day passed…

Huang Xiaolong finally made his decision. “I’ll head to the eighteenth level of hell before going to the Universe First Race. I’ll bring the six monster kings from the Netherworld along with me.”

“Alright. The Ghost Devil King is pretty strong. He should be a good assistant to bring along.”

Huang Xiaolong was shocked. The Ferocious Devil’s evaluation of the Ghost Devil King’s strength should mean something. Whatever the case, he should be stronger than the Huang Xiaolong of the past.

“When you go over to the Universe First Race, I won’t be able to help you. Here. This is all the help I can give.” The Ferocious Devil handed over a weapon. “Take my Devil Spear.”

A jet-black spear appeared in the Ferocious Devil’s hand and a terrifying pressure filled the hall.

That was the Crow Devil Spear that was part of the thirteen universe treasures!

The Green Ghost paused for a second when he saw what was going on, and he slowly said, “You should bring along my ghost staff too.”

The moment the staff appeared, ghosts and demons seemed to fill the sky.

Huang Xiaolong wanted to reject their offers, but the Ferocious Devil interrupted him before he could say anything else. “The spear isn’t of too much use to me. When you reach my level, it doesn’t matter whether or not you use a universe treasure.”

“I hope that Lord Huang Xiaolong will be able to use my Ghost Staff when traveling over to their territory…”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony as he took both weapons.

Now, he had the Universe Boat, the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, Three Gods Halbers, Reversal Sword, Golden Sun Circlets, Yin Yang Flame Wheel, Blade of Death, Crow Devil Spear, and Ghost Staff. He gathered a total of ten universe treasures!

When he obtained the Blood Axe in the Netherworld, he would have eleven of them!

The remaining two were in the hands of the White Feather King and Star Refining King. Huang Xiaolong was really curious as to the strength he would gain after gathering all thirteen treasures!

The night passed uneventfully.

The very next day, Huang Xiaolong left the city.

As soon as he did, he summoned the Universe Boat and traveled straight towards the Netherworld.

After opening the third layer of restrictions, the speed of the Universe Boat was much faster than before.

One month later, he finally arrived in the city. He didn’t bother Yin Qi as he entered the eighteenth level of the Netherworld.

He went straight towards the Naihe Bridge.

As the five monster kings followed closely behind him, no creatures dared to pounce.

Several months later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the end of the bridge.

Just as he was about to step onto the end of the bridge, a voice boomed in his mind, “Stop right there!”

The void was cold, and it contained a shocking amount of killing intent.

Even someone at Huang Xiaolong’s level felt his dao souls trembling slightly.

Ghost Devil King!

Huang Xiaolong’s face turned serious. From what it seemed, the Ghost Devil King should be as strong as the Heaven Devouring King from the Universe First Race.

Looks of terror formed on the faces of the five monster kings.

“Wait here,” Huang Xiaolong said as he ignored the warning to step onto the end of the bridge.

The instant he did, a wave of energy came crashing down on him.

The wave was made with ghost qi and it contained the resentment of countless spirits.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see the end of the wave and he didn’t dare to be careless. He sent a palm strike towards the wave and it pierced a massive hole all the way through.

“Huh?!” The Ghost Devil King was clearly shocked.

“Ghost Devil King, come out here, and let’s fight!” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

As soon as the words left his lips, a giant figure appeared.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The ghost figure was tens of millions of feet tall, but it didn’t have a corporeal body! It was a mere shadow! Despite that, the ground shook with every step it took.

Huang Xiaolong circulated the power of all three great worlds as he looked at the Ghost Devil King.

“Who are you?!” The Ghost Devil King growled as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong.”

A giant bloody axe appeared in the hands of the Ghost Devil King but he didn’t utter a word. The axe came slashing down on Huang Xiaolong.

With the Three Gods Halberd in hand, Huang Xiaolong welcomed the attack.

Clang!

Blood rain splattered all over the ground as the Ghost Devil King took several steps back in retreat.
