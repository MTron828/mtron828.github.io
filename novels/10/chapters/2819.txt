Chapter 2820: He’s Huang Xiaolong?!

When the two beams of light emerged from his back, the Saint Devil Prince seemed to have turned into a statue as his body froze in mid-air. His arm that was swinging the Saint Devil Sword hung limp beside him, and he struggled to look at the wound on his chest.

When he finally managed to lower his head, he stared at the gaping hole through his chest that was still glowing a weird blue and red.

“Absolute frost!”

“Absolute flame!”

The Saint Devil Prince, Yi Xiaotang, and Aunt Qing spoke in unison. However, the only difference was the way they said it! Xu Jian’s voice was weak, while the ladies screamed in shock.

The three of them couldn’t be more familiar with the power of absolute flame and frost. The Immemorial Qilins had used the power of both on the experts in the Immemorial Immortal Cave, killing a ton of experts from the other sacred lands!

However, they weren’t shocked by the power of the absolute frost and flame. Instead, they were shocked by the fact that Huang Xiaolong was able to utilize them! After all, the power belonged to the Beasts of Creation, the Immemorial Qilins!

How was a human like Huang Xiaolong able to use their strength?!

He was a mere human! He wasn’t born with a terrifying bloodline like those possessed by the Beasts of Creation, right?!

Of course, peak-level powers like the absolute flame and frost didn’t only belong to special beasts. Cultivators like the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable had the ability to control absolute frost, just like the Immemorial Ice Qilin!

However, that was the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable they were talking about! He was a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable! Huang Xiaolong was a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor, an existence smaller than a speck of dust compared to the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable!

Not only did Huang Xiaolong control the absolute frost, but he also had control over the absolute flame!

No one had ever heard of an existence in the Divine Tuo Holy World who could govern over both absolute flame and frost. Even the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable wouldn’t dare to attempt controlling an element that opposed his own!

While thoughts flashed through the minds of everyone present, the river of sword light slammed down on Huang Xiaolong’s body. Xu Jian’s strongest strike managed to cause sparks to fly across Huang Xiaolong’s body, but that was it. His skin remained undamaged, and even the robes on his body remained unruffled.

The Saint Devil Prince stared at the scene before him with a desperate look in his eyes.

He refused to believe that his master’s treasured sword art was unable to harm Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong’s words echoed through his mind, ‘I have no idea what you are if you’re not trash!’

He wanted to move his head, but he finally realized that he no longer had control over his body. An icy blue hue started spreading up his leg, and he slowly turned into an ice statue.

Even after circulating his Saint Devil Bloodline, he wasn’t able to do a thing to slow the spread. Pushing the Limitless Sun Dao Soul past his limit, he realized the terrifying power Huang Xiaolong wielded. Even with the Limitless Sun Dao Soul, he couldn’t melt the absolute frost.

When he was struck by the Immemorial Qilins in the Immemorial Immortal Cave, he was at the very least able to force out the energies from his body. There was no chance of that happening now.

A feeling of death finally overwhelmed him.

That was right. The feeling of death arrived! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As his vision started to turn dark, he realized that Huang Xiaolong was much more terrifying than both the Immemorial Qilins. His grand dao physique was being eroded slowly, and he knew that there was no chance of surviving.

His grand dao physique eventually shattered, and he turned into dust.

“Your Highness!”

The members of the Saint Devil Sacred Land screamed in fright.

“Don’t touch him!” Yi Xiaotang screamed when she saw that someone was planning to grab the Saint Devil Prince’s body. She recalled the exact same scene that had played out in the Immemorial Immortal Cave. The only difference this time was that the Saint Devil Prince had his body destroyed!

Just as Huang Xiaolong reached out to retrieve Xu Jian’s dao soul and Saint Fates, a terrifying pressure descended on the lands.

It was the power of Dao Venerables!

No, to be exact, it was the power of four Dao Venerables!

The Blue Heaven Dao Venerable, Ancestor He Yugui, Ancestor Wang Jin, and Grand Hall Master Yan San arrived!

The four of them charged towards the Saint Devil Prince the moment they arrived, and a frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

He could only ignore Xu Jian’s dao souls as he tore through the space to leave.

Even though he wasn’t afraid of any of them, Huang Xiaolong knew that taking on all four would pose a challenge. He had to refine the dragon scale before he tried to do anything funny.

The instant Huang Xiaolong disappeared, the four men tore through the void to appear before them.

“Father!”

“Brother!”

Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing yelled in surprise.

The four of them ignored the ladies as they stared at Xu Jian’s location.

By the time they arrived, his body had already turned into dust. The only thing that was left was his head, and the four Dao Venerables revealed a shocked expression when they noticed what had happened.

“Who! Who did this?!” Yan San roared in rage as his voice traveled across half the Silver Dragon River. The Saint Devil Prince might have only entered the Blue Heaven Creed for several dozen years, but he had already developed feelings for the kid. Xu Jian was like a second son to him.

He stared at Xu Jian’s disappearing body, and he knew that even if he made a move, he wouldn’t be able to save the kid’s grand dao physique.

Even if the four Dao Venerables worked together to create a new body for him, he would no longer possess the Saint Devil Bloodline and his grand dao physique!

One could say that the Saint Devil Prince was a cripple!

“Huang Xiaolong did it!” Yi Xiaotang yelled.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Yi Beihang and the others whose anger had reached their limits blanked out for a moment.

“Xiaotang, are you talking about the Huang Xiaolong of Cangqiong Sacred Land?” The reason all four of them were there was because of Huang Xiaolong. They were there for the Immemorial Treasury, and his talent.

Even so, isn’t Huang Xiaolong just a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor?!

How could he destroy Xu Jian’s grand dao physique?

They were wondering if there was someone else called Huang Xiaolong but Yi Xiaotang’s reply shattered their train of thoughts.

“That’s him!” Her expression was complicated and the scene where Huang Xiaolong had shattered the Saint Devil Prince’s grand dao physique played out in her mind time and time again.

The four Dao Venerables stared at each other, at a loss of what to do.

How could a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor shatter the grand dao physique of someone comparable to a half-step Dao Venerable?!

They quickly turned to Aunt Qing for an explanation.

Sucking in a cold breath, Aunt Qing nodded her head solemnly. “There’s no mistake. It’s Huang Xiaolong of Cangqiong Sacred Land!”
