Chapter 2193: Forming a Connection with the Giant Kun Ruler

“I wonder what’s going on out there?” Huang Xiaolong got to his feet. As he thought about it, it was time for him to leave.

It wouldn’t be too late for him to return for the purple grandmist aura in the future!

Other people might not be able to enter the space outside the 33 heavens due to the presence of the lightning barrage, but he had the nine great lightning pools, and he could enter whenever he wished!

“Lord!” The Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Saint Ruler saw that Huang Xiaolong had awakened, and they hastily ran up to him.

“We shall return to the Heavenly Saint Country!”

When he was cultivating in seclusion, Huang Xiaolong had a nagging worry that his master, the King of Grandmist, and the others, would be affected by the grudges held by Giant Kun Ruler and the rest.

Hearing that Huang Xiaolong wanted to return to the Heavenly Saint Country, joy filled the heart of the Heavenly Saint Ruler as he agreed respectfully.

Staring at the Lightning Origin Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to punch at the ground below it. Upon shattering the earth, Huang Xiaolong uprooted the entire tree and stored it into the lightning bead.

After keeping the Lightning Origin Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong brought everyone towards the Heavens Path.

Even though the Lightning Origin Divine Tree needed several tens of billions of years to bear a single fruit, Huang Xiaolong had the nine great chaos lightning pools! As soon as it completed its transformation, he would be able to transplant the Lightning Origin Divine Tree into it! It wouldn’t take long for it to bear more Lightning Origin Divine Fruits!

Several days later...

Huang Xiaolong and the rest finally emerged from the space outside the 33 heavens.

It was as though they had entered a completely different world as there were no longer traces of lightning around them. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Let’s go!”

Unable to contain the anxiety in his heart, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother staying around as they charged towards the Heavenly Saint Country.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle. He summoned the Golden Pig Treasure to retrieve the All Extinguishing Lightning Whip. He wiped out the soul mark on it in an instant.

If Huang Xiaolong wanted to erase the soul mark of the 33 Heavens Race’s leader when he was at the early-Seventh Order Sovereign Realm, he would need to waste a lot of resources and use a whole lot of effort. However, he was at the peak of the late-Seventh Order Sovereign Realm now, and wiping away the soul mark was much easier.

In just a day’s time, the soul mark on the All Extinguishing Lighting Whip no longer existed.

As for Dong Cheng’s weapons, Huang Xiaolong gathered all six Ice Earth Divine Artifacts. Along with Dong Cheng’s death, the soul marks on them had disappeared. Hence, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to waste his time on them.

The All Extinguishing Lighting Whip and the Ice Earth Six Divine Artifacts, along with all the supreme spiritual treasures he had obtained after killing the Heavenly Master, Wan Shi, Tian Chen, and the rest, would be given to the Huang Family and his master.

He felt that the lightning bead, Golden Pig Treasure, and the four divine fires were enough for himself.

After all, he no longer had any need for treasures.

The only exception would be if he managed to obtain a saint artifact.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong wiped away the 33 Heavens Race Patriarch’s soul mark from the whip, the Golden Pig Treasure opened its mouth. Huang Xiaolong chuckled and tossed a top-grade chaos spirit stone into its mouth. “D*mn piggy, you ate so many top-grade chaos spirit stones along the way!”

The Golden Pig Treasure swallowed the spirit stone in a single gulp as it emitted rays of golden light. It opened its mouth again and it was clear that a single top-grade chaos spirit stone wouldn’t be enough. With a helpless expression, Huang Xiaolong tossed several pieces of top-grade chaos spirit stones into its mouth.

“The members of my Massacring God Heavenly Country located the remnants of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country! They are located in one of the abandoned countries and we should hurry there now! Those b*stards hid themselves really well! We couldn’t locate them for so long!” A voice rang through the air in front of Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

“The Giant Kun Ruler passed down the order! Anyone who locates the King of Grandmist and the others will be able to obtain ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones as long as a report is made! Informants can also get ten Giant Kun Divine Pills! If anyone manages to capture the King of Grandmist and bring him to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, they will be rewarded rewarded thirty thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones and thirty Giant Kun Divine Pills!”

“Thirty thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones and thirty Giant Kun Divine Pills?! That’s insane! In fact, the connection with the Giant Kun Ruler is more important than the rewards!”

Everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s party stared at the group of soldiers wearing the robes of the Massacring God Heavenly Country in shock.

A frosty glint flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Massacring God Heavenly Country?! It seemed as though it was a mistake for him to allow them to escape. Right now, they were planning to capture his master, the King of Grandmist, for the Giant Kun Heavenly Country!

Thirty thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones, and thirty Giant Kun Divine Pills?! It seemed as though the Giant Kun Heavenly Country was going all out for this!

The troops from the Massacring God Heavenly Country saw a golden glow of light. Before they could react, a giant pig appeared before them.

Jaws dropped in shock but before they could rage, they saw the rulers of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country. The color drained from their faces as they screamed, “Heavenly Saint Ruler! Mighty God Ruler!”

One of the soldiers couldn’t control his shock and spoke his doubt out loud, “Weren’t you killed in the lightning barrage?!”

Killed?

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Glancing at the two rulers, Huang Xiaolong’s meaning was clear. One of them reached out to grab the captain of the troops before them and conducted a soul search.

“Your Majesty, we found it! They’re right in front of us. If we rush over, it will take us less than half an hour!” Heavenly Saint Ruler turned to make his report.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and he swept his gaze across the rest of the soldiers. “Kill them all.”

The generals of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country made their move instantly, reducing the small army of soldiers to dust.

Huang Xiaolong rode on the Golden Pig Treasure and charged towards his master’s hiding spot.

At that moment, Massacring God Ruler and several other experts had already surrounded the mountain peak the King of Grandmist and the others were hiding in.

Even with the restrictions set down by the Xumi Old Man, King of Grandmist, and the experts of the Heavenly Saint Country, the attacks from the Massacring God Heavenly Country caused the ground to shake.

“Your Majesty, we should be able to destroy the protection barrier in another ten moves!” One of the generals chuckled.

Massacring God Ruler nodded his head in satisfaction. He was clearly in a good mood as he laughed, “After we break the formation, they will probably fight with everything they got. Tell everyone to be careful.”

In the past, Huang Xiaolong had only brought twenty-plus men from both heavenly countries to the space outside the 33 heavens. Many generals had remained in both heavenly countries.

The general from the Massacring God Heavenly Country continued to joke, “With Your Majesty and Lord Marshal, none of them will be able to escape!”

Even though it sounded like it, the general wasn’t kissing up to the ruler. It was true. With the ruler’s strength at the late-Eighth Order Sovereign Realm, it was impossible for anyone to escape!

“Tell the others to be careful when they make their move. The Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler wants living captives! We can’t kill them yet!”

“Yes, Your Majesty!”

The experts of the Massacring God Heavenly Country continued to attack and the barrier around the mountain peak shattered into a million pieces!
