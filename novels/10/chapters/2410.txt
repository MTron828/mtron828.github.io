Chapter 2411: Trial of Blood

The moment they turned to look at the person who spoke, they saw Huang Xiaolong approaching slowly on Little Nine’s back.

The expression on Li Chen and Xie Yao’s faces turned complicated when they noticed his presence.

“We greet Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong,” the disciples who followed behind Li Chen greeted the moment they saw Huang Xiaolong.

As though he hadn’t noticed Li Chen and the others, Huang Xiaolong headed straight for Fu Yunjie.

“Fu Yunjie, as a disciple in the Holy Heavens, you dare to sow discord between the Holy Princes?! Also, how dare you call my name? Do you know your sins?” Huang Xiaolong sneered as he stared at Fu Yunjie, below.

A regular disciple in the Holy Heavens didn’t have the authority to comment on Huang Xiaolong. Based on the rules in the Holy Heavens, it was a sin for Fu Yunjie to speak ill of Huang Xiaolong!

As soon as the words left his lips, Fu Yunjie’s expression changed.

Xie Yao couldn’t help but rage when he saw how Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them and scolded their followers. After all, one had to look at the masters when they beat the dog. “Junior Brother Huang, Fu Yunjie isn’t lying. Everything he said is true.”

From what Xie Yao said, it was clear that he agreed with what Fu Yunjie said.

Huang Xiaolong completely ignored Xie Yao, and he continued to berate Fu Yunjie, “What are you waiting for? Why aren’t you slapping yourself?”

A look of panic appeared on Fu Yunjie’s face.

When Li Chen heard what Huang Xiaolong said, he couldn’t help but frown. “Junior Brother Huang, my follower made a mistake. After we get back, I will discipline him appropriately. You can forget about this matter now.”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Li Chen and continued, “As it turns out, Fu Yunjie is your dog. No wonder he dares to bark without thinking of the consequences. Senior Brother Li, it seems like you really have no idea how to train your dog.”

Li Chen knew that Fu Yunjie was Huang Xiaolong’s enemy, but he had still accepted him as a follower. Since that was the case, Huang Xiaolong felt that there wasn’t a need to respect the man.

Li Chen’s expression sank the moment he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

How dare Huang Xiaolong speak to me like this?

Xie Yao couldn’t hold himself back, “Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are? How dare you speak to Senior Brother Li Chen this way? Even if you’re a personal disciple of the Primal Ancestors, Senior Brother Li Chen is still the leader of the Holy Princes! Whatever the case, you’re just a new disciple of the organization!”

Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes when he heard what Xie Yao said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Initially, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t planned to offend Xie Yao because of Grand Hall Master Wu Ge. However, Xie Yao had already challenged his bottom line.

“Who do you think you are?” Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at Xie Yao with a cold gaze. “If not for your Master, I would’ve killed you right here and now!”

Xie Yao roared with laughter instantly. “Are you delusional? With your strength, do you think that you can challenge me? What a joke.”

Before Huang Xiaolong had arrived, Xie Yao was ranked together with Li Chen and Lin Yijia as the three top geniuses of the Holy Heavens.

He wasn’t just talented, but he had the abilities to back himself up. Right now, he had already entered the First Heaven True Saint Realm.

How dare a newbie threaten to kill me?

In his years of existence that was the most hilarious joke he had heard.

Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes yet again when he heard Xie Yao’s uncontrollable laughter.

Before anyone could do anything, Li Chen raised his arm to stop Xie Yao. Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, he spoke. “Junior Brother Huang, why don’t we make a bet?”

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Li Chen and he didn’t respond immediately. He wanted to hear the terms of the bet.

Li Chen continued slowly, “Junior Brother Huang, I believe that you have heard about the Trial of Blood. If you manage to enter the top three hundred ranks, I won’t interfere with anything you wish to do to Fu Yunjie.

“If you fail, you won’t be allowed to mess with Fu Yunjie in the future. Moreover, you need to apologize to Junior Brother Xie about the matter today.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard the terms. “Senior Brother Li, this is the first time I’ve seen your shameless side. Even though I don’t understand too much about the Trial of Blood, I’ve heard stories about it. Even ordinary half-True Saints wouldn’t be able to enter the top three hundred ranks. You’re willing to use this as a bet when you know that I might not be able to enter the top three hundred ranks...?!”

“Are you stupid, or do you take me to be a fool?”

“Why aren’t you challenging me in the comprehension of the sacred steles?”

Li Chen’s expression sank once again when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Xie Yao, who hated Huang Xiaolong to the bone, was just about to lash out again when Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth to agree with the bet. “Whatever. I’ll take on the bet.”

Xie Yao, Li Chen, and everyone else on the other side were stunned. No one had expected Huang Xiaolong to agree to the terms so easily.

“However, I would like to change the terms of the bet. If I enter the top three hundred ranks, you will no longer bother with the enmity I have with Fu Yunjie. Moreover, I want you to kneel at the gates of my Blue Dragon Manor for an entire day.”

The Blue Dragon Manor was precisely the name of the residence Huang Xiaolong had purchased in the heart of the city.

Li Chen, Xie Yao, Lin Yijia, and the others couldn’t help but rage when they heard his conditions.

“If I fail to enter the top three hundred ranks and pass the Trial of Blood, I’ll kneel at the gates of the Holy Heavens City for an entire day.”

The rage in their hearts instantly turned into shock when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s conditions.

Li Chen stared at Huang Xiaolong with a deep gaze, as though he was trying to peer into all his secrets. After a short moment, he slowly nodded his head. “Alright. But I would like to add something else to the bet. If you lose, you shall hand over a low-grade saint artifact to each of us. If you succeed, all of us will give you a single low-grade saint artifact artifact.”

A brilliant smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face instantly, and he nearly jumped in joy. “Alright!” Since the other party was willing to give him free saint artifacts, he would be stupid if he didn’t accept the bet.

Fearing that Huang Xiaolong would renege on the bet, Xie Yao pressured everyone present into swearing an oath in the name of the grand dao.

As soon as they were done, Huang Xiaolong left on the back of his Rainbow Phoenix.

Li Chen frowned when he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s departing figure.

“This brat just returned from his adventures and has no idea how the Trial of Blood will be carried out. Senior Brother Li, you can rest assured. It is absolutely impossible for him to pass the trial. All disciples under a hundred thousand years old will be able to take part in the trial, and even Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints will find it hard to place in the top three hundred ranks. He has only started his cultivation journey, and he was a mere Sixth Order Venerable when he entered the Holy Heavens.”

Li Chen nodded when he heard Xie Yao’s analysis. It had only been several tens of years since Huang Xiaolong entered the organization. It was impossible for him to enter the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm no matter how quickly he trained. As such, Huang Xiaolong was destined to lose the bet.

“I can’t wait for the day he has to kneel at the gates of the city! Hahaha! Won’t that be a sight to behold?” Xie Yao roared with laughter as a sinister smile appeared on his face.
