The other five Ying Family guards also got to their feet with furious faces, but when they saw the flattened meat paste sticking to the ground inches from their feet, their bodies stiffened, they were too frightened to move...

There is no one unafraid of death, except for fools and idiots.

Then again, fools and idiots were never short in supply.

One amongst the five Ying Family guards soon recovered from his shock and pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong, reprimanding him in a lofty tone, “Huang Xiaolong, do you know the consequences of your action?! You will only make them suffer worse before dying! I’m not afraid to tell you, this time our Ying Family sent sixteen Grand Elders here, you won’t be able to escape!”

“If you want to live, obediently follow us to see our Grand Elder Ying Changtian. Kneel and kowtow, admitting your sins in front of Grand Elder Ying Changtian, surrender yourself to our Ying Family!”

Hearing the nonsense coming out from this guard’s mouth, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest of Huang Xiaolong’s group couldn’t help laughing. The loudest of all were Guo Xiaofan and Lil’ Tian.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head lamenting, why was this Ying Family guard so slow in realizing the situation?

This time, however, he was too lazy to bother with this guard. He lightly tapped the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger beneath him.

In response, the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger lifted its front paw and slammed down, causing the ground to violently quake. On the ground, there was a new giant tiger paw-shaped pit.

The second Ying Family guard ended up just like the one before him, slammed into the ground. But, instead of a flat meat paste, the second guard was a pile of mess, one couldn’t even differentiate his head or feet.

The four remaining Ying Family guards’ faces turned bloodless by now. Worse still, the surrounding Ying Family soldiers nearly pissed themselves.

Watching this scene, the Martial Spirit World’s former family disciples and elders, now turned convicts, cheered even louder.

“These Ying Family soldiers and disciples, leave none alive.” Huang Xiaolong said looking over his shoulder to the group behind him. His voice was filled with cold indifference, as if he was talking about a trivial matter.

Toward these Ying Family disciples and soldiers, Huang Xiaolong had not the slightest bit of mercy to spare.

The Ying Family had gone far past his bottom-line.

When he was rushing here earlier, all the villages and towns he passed by were deserted. Every place he saw exuded an aura of death and thick resentment filled the air. It was obvious that this Ying Family slaughtered numerous commoners, including women and children, all killed!

Unless so, the death aura and resentment he had felt along the way wouldn’t be so whelming.

“Yes, Sovereign!” Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu respectfully acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s command.

So many years had passed, but both men had maintained their salutation toward Huang Xiaolong as the Sovereign of Asura’s Gate, and Huang Xiaolong did not feel the need for them to change anything.

After acknowledging Huang Xiaolong’s command, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu flew to the ground, carrying out their task. One hand extended in the direction of the four remaining Ying Family guards. In an instant, a golden palm imprint shadowed the sky.

With their Second Order God Realm strength, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were more than enough to care of four First Order God Realm Ying Family guards.

The battle skill that both of them were using was called Golden Flame Palm.

This Golden Flame Palm was the ancient Golden Flame Sect’s heritage battle skill that the Ascending Moon Old Man obtained later on and passed to Huang Xiaolong. After Huang Xiaolong tried out the battle skill, he felt that it suited Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, thus he taught it to them.

The four Ying Family guards were petrified as they watched the enormous golden palm casting out the sky above them, those guards’ faces went deathly pale. Fear and fury could be seen in their eyes, but just as they barely mustered up the will to fight, Guo Xiaofan’s voice rang loud: “These four are mine!”

Guo Xiaofan struck out, not holding back. A meteor of fist images whistled through the air, competing with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s attack to exterminate the four Ying Family guards.

But, there was someone else that moved faster than the three of them.

Heaven Devouring Beast Lil’ Tian opened his mouth wide and desperately inhaled. The Ying Family guards were screaming like pigs as the powerful suction force pulled the four of them toward Lil’ Tian, swallowed down in one go into his stomach. The four Ying Family guards became Lil’ Tian’s food.

Lil’ Tian’s cultivation talent was extremely terrifying, even Shi Xiaofei with her Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique awakened was barely able to keep ahead. Lil’ Tian was already a peak late-Third Order God Realm.

Seeing that Lil’ Tian joined in, Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey Huang Xiaoyong also couldn’t stay still any longer.

He opened his mouth and let out an earth-shattering roar. The roar turned into a soundwave hurricane that lashed destruction all around. Every Ying Family soldier in its path was grinded into blooming rain of red. They were ground into a hundred pieces before they could even issue a scream.

Huang Xiaoyong’s cultivation progress was comparable to Lil’ Tian’s, he too had already reached peak late-Third Order God Realm.

With Guo Xiaofan, Lil’ Tian, and Huang Xiaoyong jumping into the fray, Blessed Buddha Emperor, Xie Puti, and the others also made their move, including Huang Xiaohai, Huang Min. Even Huang Peng and Su Yan did not hold back as they made swift kills of Ying Family soldiers trying to flee.

However, with more than a dozen God Realm masters rounding them up, would these Ying Family soldiers have any chance of escaping?

In ten breaths’ time, probably less, the several tens of thousands of Ying Family soldiers stationed by the southern city gates were all slaughtered.

Everything happened so fast that the Martial Spirit World’s people were flabbergasted when they saw all the dead Ying Family soldiers. Even the weakest of these Ying Family soldiers was half-step Saint realm.

A half-step Saint realm expert was a crucial pillar for the Martial Spirit World’s prominent families.

At this point, Guo Shiwen wandered out from the group of convicts to Guo Tai and Guo Xiaofan’s side, his tears wouldn’t stop as he pleaded, “Guo Tai, Xiaofan, you’re finally back, our Guo Family is no more! You must avenge our all our dead family disciples, they killed Guo Zhi and Guo Fei!”

Both Guo Tai and Guo Xiaofan’s expression tightened.

Huang Xiaolong was dazed for a moment at the last sentence. The two brothers, Guo Zhi and Guo Fei, he still remembered them, they were Guo Shiwen’s two sons. When Huang Xiaolong was in the Duanren Institute, he had some conflict with these two. Huang Xiaolong did not expect them to be dead. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

A cold gleam flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Spreading out his divine sense, he covered the entire Duanren Imperial City.

“One mid-Eighth Order God Realm, one late-Sixth Order God Realm, three Fourth Order God Realms, eight Third Order God Realms.” Huang Xiaolong immediately located every Ying Family’s God Realm master present inside the city.

Analyzing this information, Huang Xiaolong guessed that the mid-Eighth Order God Realm was the Ying Family’s Grand Elder Ying Changtian that the guard mentioned earlier. No wonder these several guards were so arrogant, their backing was a mid-Eighth Order God Realm master.

Though the other fifteen Ying Family Grand Elders were not in the city, Huang Xiaolong deduced that they were probably Eighth Order God Realms as well.

This Ying Family really placed a lot of importance on him, willing to send sixteen Eighth Order God Realm Grand Elders here just to capture him.

Huang Xiaolong had Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the Huang Family stay behind to deal with the aftermath. Lil’ Tian and Huang Xiaoyong were tasked with killing the eight Third Order God Realm masters.

Whereas Huang Xiaolong himself, riding on the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger, flew in the direction of that Ying Family Grand Elder, Ying Changtian.

Standing on top of the northside city walls, Ying Changtian was frowning. There was a strong feeling of unease in his heart.

“Grand Elder, there’s big trouble at the southern city gates!” A Ying Family guard ran up to Ying Changtian in panic, the words blurted out of his mouth before he even saluted.

Big trouble! Ying Changtian’s heart sank.
