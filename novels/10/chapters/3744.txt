Chapter 3745: Dragon Soul Mountain

Although the process required a little bit more time and effort than usual, it didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to successfully break through Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s dao soul’s defenses and brand it with his mark.

Huang Xiaolong then ‘viewed’ the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s memories.

From Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s memories, Huang Xiaolong soon found the memories relevant to the Devil Mirror Palace.

The nameless devil mirror inside the Devil Mirror Palace had five pointed corners like a pentagon, and it looked a little like the bagua that Huang Xiaolong was familiar with. The edges of the mirror were dense and there were intricate runes that seemed to originate from the same source as his nameless devil mirror. Runes, esoterics, and laws of the universe were all rolled into one.

However, the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror was almost twice the size of his own nameless devil mirror, and other than that, there was no difference between the two.

Upon confirming this, Huang Xiaolong’s heart raced.

As he had guessed before, that devil mirror and his nameless mirror were like mother and son. If all details on both devil mirrors were exactly the same, and once he truly comprehended the Origin Universe, and the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws, he would be able to step into Universe God Realm.

“Fragments of the devil mirror,” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath.

From Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s memories, Huang Xiaolong also learned that there were three people who had obtained similar devil mirror fragments inside the Devil Mirror Palace’s inner hall.

There was a rumor claiming that if one could completely comprehend the mysteries inside a devil mirror fragment, it would greatly raise one’s chances of comprehending the devil mirror itself.

One of the three people who obtained a piece of devil mirror fragment was none other than the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

Another person was the Lord of Ghost Desert, the third-ranked expert of the Origin Universe. His strength was only second to the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, but his whereabouts had always been mysterious. From the beginning of Origin Universe to date, he hadn’t appeared more than ten times in public.

The third and final person was the Origin Universe’s strongest cultivator, Yuan Fang!

Yuan Fang was the monarch of all Orign Universe’s origin beasts!

Yet, no one ever knew who origin beast Yuan Fang really was.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils glimmered as he fell into contemplation. The Lord of Ghost Desert’s whereabouts were unknown, hence it was impossible for him to find him in a short time. Yuan Fang’s strength was no weaker than the Black Nether King, so it wouldn’t be easy for him to snatch the devil mirror fragment off Yuan Fang’s hand.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong set his sights on the target with the highest chance of succeeding, and he was none other than the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

As long as he obtained the devil mirror fragment, when coupled with his nameless devil mirror, comprehending the Origin Universe’s devil mirror would be easier.

Prior to entering half-step Universe God, his strength was comparable to Old Man Fortune, and now that he had advanced to half-step Universe God, Huang Xiaolong was confident he was strong enough to suppress Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

However, Huang Xiaolong decided against looking for the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. Even though he could suppress the Dragon Sage Human Emperor with strength, he wasn’t absolutely certain that he could detain him.

Currently, his comprehension of the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws within the nameless devil mirror had reached perfection, but his comprehension was not thorough enough. Huang Xiaolong believed he could do so within one hundred thousand years.

His strength would rise to another degree at the time, and capturing and detaining the Dragon Sage Human Emperor would be a certainty.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong decided to push back looking for the Dragon Sage Human Emperor until he had thoroughly comprehended the devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes esoterics and laws.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong quickly laid out a supreme formation around the island and entered seclusion on the third level of the Universe Boat. He continued to comprehend the nameless devil mirror within.

As for the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, Huang Xiaolong threw him into one of the spaces inside the Universe Boat and left him at that.

Whilst Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion to further comprehend the devil mirror, the news that the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was injured by a youngster called Hunag Xiaolong shook the many lands in Origin Universe.

If it was a common twenty billion mark cultivator who was injured and whisked away, it naturally wouldn’t garner this degree of attention, but the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was one of the human race’s pillars of belief! On top of that, he was a supreme expert at the twenty-eight billion mark.

Yet, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was injured by an unknown youngster called Huang Xiaolong!

The news shook the whole Origin Universe, and it had reached that magnitude.

When news of it spread, all the top forces of Origin Universe went searching for Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s whereabouts.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor even appeared personally, and gathered the other eight of the human race’s Human Emperors to discuss the matter. Later on, with the Dragon Sage Human Emperor taking the lead, orders were issued from the nine Human Emperors to find Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

Somewhere in a deserted mountainous terrain in the Origin Universe sat a person who seemed to be completely condensed from the darkness. Yes, he was pitch-black from head to toe, and his facial features were nonexistent nor did he seem to have any eyes. He was the epitome of darkness from head to toe. Despite the darkness of his body, it did not taint the environment, and yet it felt as if the whole mountainous terrain were enshrouded by indescribable darkness.

“Heihei!”

“Huang Xiaolong!”

“You’ve arrived at the Origin Universe at last!”

“Looks like you’re also inquiring about the devil mirror, hopefully you won’t disappoint me when we meet again.”

……

A hundred thousand years went by like a short dream.

During this whole time, the Origin Universe’s human race cultivators had not given up on searching for Huang Xiaolong and the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, but their efforts bore no results.

Even though they failed to locate Huang Xiaolong and the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, none of the human race’s forces gave up. All of them were still exerting efforts and were hellbent on finding Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

On this calm day out at the sea, glimmers of light lit up the surroundings of a certain deserted island, and moments later, a figure appeared.

This person was Huang Xiaolong who had just come out of seclusion.

In truth, he had thoroughly comprehended the nameless devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws several thousand years ago, and he had been solidifying his new state.

Huang Xiaolong looked around to get a bearing, then left the desert island in a streak of light, disappearing in the horizon in the blink of an eye.

“Dragon Emperor Land!” He was Huang Xiaolong’s target this time.

The Dragon Emperor Land was the sacred pilgrimage destination for the human race. It was the place with the biggest land surface in the Origin Universe, and also the land with the most experts. The Dragon Emperor Land was the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s territory.

Similar to Huang Xiaolong, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was human but possessed the dragon race’s bloodline.

Huang Xiaolong rushed to the Dragon Emperor Land on the Universe Boat without stopping.

It was an understatement to say the Origin Universe was vast, and it took Huang Xiaolong more than a decade’s journey to reach the Dragon Emperor Land.

Entering the Dragon Emperor Land, Huang Xiaolong could clearly feel the prosperity and vitality of the land. The architecture of the cities was decorated with one kind of dragon or another.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It is said that the Dragon Sage Human Emperor would be present at the Dragon Soul Mountain’s awakening this time!”

“The Golden Gorge’s Devil Mirror Palace is about to appear. Could the Dragon Sage Human Emperor intend to obtain the Dragon Soul Mountain's dragon soul source before the Devil Mirror Palace appears?”

“Probably, if the Dragon Sage Human Emperor could obtain the dragon soul source and refine it, his chances of comprehending the devil mirror would increase.”
