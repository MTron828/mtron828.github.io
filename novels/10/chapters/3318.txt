Chapter 3319: Strength!

When they heard that the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect was coming to Tokyo, the old ancestor of the Iga Clan, Iga Honda, jumped in joy. They roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong poked the hornet’s nest this time! Hahaha! It’s too late for him to regret his actions now!”

The patriarch of the Iga Clan, Iga Fujio, roared with laughter, “If he knew that his actions would draw the ire of the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect, he might even get to his knees and bark when Yagyu Motoichi appeared that day! Hahaha! When the old ancestor arrives, Huang Xiaolong is going to die! I can imagine his corpse hanging on the plaza opposite the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce!”

Laughter filled the hall. 

“Old ancestor, should we send some men over to ensure that Huang Xiaolong doesn’t leave the country?” Iga Fujio asked. 

“There’s no need for that. Even if he runs, his Huang Family will still be there!” 

“Huang Xiaolong is currently a celebrity in the Huaxia Alliance. He’s comparable to Ying Tian, and he’s insulting the Japanese Alliance by hanging Yagyu Motoichi’s corpse for all to see!” Iga Fujio sneered, “When the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect kills him in the Japanese Alliance, the warriors of the Huaxia Alliance will have to lower their heads whenever they meet us!”

When the Iga Clan was celebrating, the atmosphere was the same in the various super factions of the Japanese Alliance.

It was especially so for the Yagyu Clan. They were hanging lanterns all about to celebrate the arrival of their old ancestor. Of course, the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect was also the reason they were celebrating.

The high officials of the Japanese Alliance were no different as they were preparing the best dishes to welcome the arrival of the Purple Flame Sect’s old ancestor.

As one of the six strongest experts in the world, they would hardly be able to see someone like him! It was their honor that they would be able to host him in their nation!

Eminent Elder Wang Zheng of the Six Swords Gate also received the news of the Yagyu Clan as he sneered in annoyance, “What a shame… I won’t be the one to kill that brat.”

Fu Wu, the old ancestor of the Six Swords Gate chuckled, “When Huang Xiaolong dies, I’ll allow you to head over to the Blue Dragon Orchard in the Huaxia Alliance.

Blue Dragon Orchard!

The only reason he would go there was to deal with Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and the others.

A sinister smile formed on Wang Zheng’s face. “Great! When I go there, I’ll torture his parents before killing them! As for that slut, I’ll capture her back and humiliate her for ten years! She’ll be my personal slut for ten whole years as punishment!”

Fu Wu nodded and no longer bothered with him.

…

When Lu Dingming heard the news of the Purple Flame Sect’s old ancestor, his expression changed. He started to panic. “Xiaolong, you… You have to leave right now! We’ll arrange the flying ship for you to leave the Japanese Alliance.”

“Leave?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the anxious look on their faces. “Uncle Dingming, are you asking me to hide from a mere old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect?”

Lu Dingming stared at him in shock.

‘A mere old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect’?!

He stared at Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant face and he forced a smile. “Damn it you little ancestor, didn’t you just return to Earth?! Do you not know how strong the six strongest cultivators are?!”

Lu Qingwen, Lu Dingming’s son, continued, “The six strongest cultivators on earth are terrifying experts! They can blow a city to nothingness with a single punch! Let’s take Tokyo as an example. It will shatter if they punch it several times! One of their fists can be compared to the atomic bomb that was dropped on Japan in the past!”

One punch!

An atomic bomb that had twenty tons of power!

During the second world war, America unleashed two atomic bombs on Japan, and the stronger one possessed as much power as that!

That was the strength of one of the six strongest experts on Earth!

“Oh? Twenty tons?” Huang Xiaolong snickered. “One of my punches will probably possess twenty million tons of energy. There’s no need to worry. If he really comes over, I’ll deal with him with a single punch.”

Lu Dingming, Lu Qingwen, Lu Anan, and the others felt like beating Huang Xiaolong up when they saw the sh*t eating grin on his face along with the garbage that he just sprouted. It was clear no one believed what he was saying.

“Xiaolong, we are not joking!” Lu Dingming growled, “The old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect is probably stronger than what Qingwen described!”

“I’m serious too.” Huang Xiaolong replied.

Everyone around him could only reveal a helpless expression.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

They knew that there was no way they could convince him to escape now that he was so adamant about staying.

That very night, Huang Xiaolong made a trip down to the Fierce Tiger Gang.

As soon as he arrived, Zhang Tian and the other experts of the gang were waiting for him at the entrance.

Other than Zhang Tian, there were eleven Nascent Soul Realm cultivators in the Fierce Tiger Gang, and there were more than thirty at the Golden Core Realm.

The power they possessed might be a little lacking when compared to the strongest families on Earth, but they weren’t weak. They were at least comparable to the Tan Family of the Donglin Province.

As they invited him in, Huang Xiaolong entered the headquarters of the gang.

Even though the gang had only been established for several dozen years, their expansion was rapid. They accumulated quite a bit of wealth and their headquarters was also located on one of the busiest streets. They might not possess a skyscraper like the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, but their building was pretty big. The interior of the building was decorated well and there was an air of luxury.

“Chen Kerui and his son really know how to enjoy themselves.” Huang Xiaolong looked around and commented.

An awkward smile appeared on Zhang Tian’s face. “One of the most famous designers on Earth designed the interior..”

“Not bad.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

As he strolled about, he asked about the gang in detail. When he was done walking around the building, he pretty much understood the entire structure of the gang.

He left the Fierce Tiger Gang after a short while.

However, he told Zhang Tian to look for traces of the Pangu Axe before he left.

The very next day, Huang Xiaolong left the city for a little bit. Since he knew that there was some time before the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect would arrive, he planned to look for traces of the Pangu Axe along the shoreline.

Two days were more than enough for Huang Xiaolong to scour the entire East Sea.

It was too bad nothing would go according to his plan. After all, the Pangu Axe was a creation artifact, and it was one at the highest level! It wouldn’t be easy even if Huang Xiaolong was the one trying to look for it.

When Huang Xiaolong was making his way back to the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, two figures appeared in the skies above the city! Their aura came crashing down as they didn’t plan to hide their appearance.

Without a doubt, they were the old ancestors of the Yagyu Clan and the Purple Flame Sect!
