Chapter 2986: Apsara Dragon Country

“Ohhh! Uncle, you’re pretty good!” Chen Qiaoer laughed. “Hmm, the Soaring Dragon Terrace is pretty famous in the Six Vision Sacred Land… Are you planning to head over to take a look?”

A frown quickly formed on her face and she shook her head violently. “Uncle, you better not go!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask, “Why not?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Nothing much comes out of the Soaring Dragon Terrace! Not many people can understand anything on the Soaring Dragon Terrace! Moreover, one needs to pay ten thousand holy bills to the Coiled Dragon Race if they want to remain on the stage for a single day! It will cost you several million holy bills to remain there for a year! It’s too expensive! My entire kingdom will go bankrupt if my Emperor Father plans to send someone there for a year!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled to himself when he saw her adorable expression when she complained about the Soaring Dragon Terrace.

In the past, the Holy Dragon World had no such thing. When his father, Huang Long, had visited the Six Vision Sacred Land in the past, he sat on a rock in meditation for several days. When he had left, the Coiled Dragon Race had claimed the rock as their own and named it the Soaring Dragon Terrace! They had started collecting holy bills if anyone else wanted to meditate there.

From what Chen Qiaoer said, the price was indeed expensive. There was no need to mention the emperor of a mere country under a sacred land. Even the upper echelons of the sacred land would feel their hearts aching if they had to pay up several million holy bills!

That was a pretty sizable amount to some weaker sacred lands…

“There’s no way Lord Creation sat on the platform to meditate for a few days! The Coiled Dragon Race definitely made it up in an attempt to steal out hard-earned money!” Chen Qiaoer pouted when she thought about it. She seemed enraged by the Coiled Dragon Race’s actions, but Huang Xiaolong broke her train of thought with a soft chuckle. “The Coiled Dragon Race went a little too far by claiming it as their own…”

The Coiled Dragon Race was part of the few acquired dragon races in the Holy Dragon World. The factions were split up to innate races and acquired races, with the latter being the weaker of the two. Despite that, the Coiled Dragon Race was one of the strongest factions in the acquired dragon races, and it was only weaker when compared to the five great innate dragon races. It controlled several hundred thousand sacred lands, and the Six Vision Sacred Land was one of them.

Nevertheless, they could only monopolize the Soaring Dragon Terrace with the help of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race. Their clans went pretty far back, and they had a great relationship with each other.

The Radiant Winged Dragon Race was one of the five great innate dragon races in the Holy Dragon World. It was ranked second, and their strength was only second to the Holy Dragon Race.

“Yeah!” Chen Qiaoer yelled. “Too bad I'm not strong enough to punish them! If I’m the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, I’ll beat up the Coiled Dragon Patriarch!”

Huang Xiaolong chortled in amusement and he felt that Chen Qiaoer was really pretty interesting.

“Your Apsara Dragon Country is just a small country under the Coiled Dragon Race. As the princess of the country, you dare to speak ill of the Coiled Dragon Race and curse their patriarch! Are you not afraid that your words will offend the Coiled Dragon Race? Don’t you know that that’s an offence that will get your whole family killed?” Huang Xiaolong teased.

A pout quickly formed on her face and she snorted, “I’m not afraid of them! I’m just telling you my thoughts!” Pausing for a second, Chen Qiaoer scrunched her face up at Huang Xiaolong, “Uncle, don’t tell me you’re from the Coiled Dragon Race…”

“Nope.”

Heaving a sigh of relief, Chen Qiaoer continued, “Yeah! Why would a disciple of the Coiled Dragon Race behave like you and ride a black tortoise? Hahaha! A disciple of the Coiled Dragon Race from their outermost division came to my Apsara Dragon Country once! My father personally appeared to greet him, and the disciple was riding on a super divine beast!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh.

Talking to Chen Qiaoer was really something else.

“Don’t forget… My black tortoise can transform! It’s several trillion times better than his divine beast!” Huang Xiaolong responded.

Chen Qiaoer giggled and her sweet voice rang through the air.

When those following behind heard her laughter, their eyes turned green from the jealousy they felt. Chen Qiaoer was the goddess in the eyes of everyone from the Apsara Dragon Country! Her talent was top-tier, and she had taken less than ten thousand years to enter the True Saint Realm! She was also the jewel of her father’s eye, and it was highly likely she would enter the Six Vision Sacred Land in the near future to become the personal disciple of their Primal Ancestor Realm ancestor!

This was the first time they heard her laughter, and it was to what some random guy riding on a tortoise said!

The anger in the eyes of Chen Chaoyi and the others could no longer be hidden.

Of course, none of their thoughts could be hidden from Huang Xiaolong. However, there was no need to care about them. Even if their ancestors rose from their graves and their backup arrived enmasse, they were nothing more than a bunch of flies who would disappear with a single breath.

Chen Qiaoer soon invited Huang Xiaolong over to the Apsara Dragon Country as a guest, and Huang Xiaolong agreed without much thought. There was no need to bother about a few days of delay anyway since he was planning to head over to the Soaring Dragon Terrace soon after.

Chen Qiaoer looked extremely happy when he agreed, and the dimples on her face showed once again.

Along the way, she asked Huang Xiaolong about everything under the sun.

“Uncle, why is there no energy in your body! Don’t tell me you failed a tribulation and lost all your powers…” Chen Qiaoer tilted her head and looked at Huang Xiaolong with a curious expression.

Coughing dryly, Huang Xiaolong explained, “You might not be able to feel the energy in my body, but you should know that my fleshy body is extremely strong.”

Staring at him from head to toe, Chen Qiaoer pouted, “Can your body be stronger than the Coiled Dragon Patriarch?”

“?! He’s nothing compared to me.”

Holding her mouth, Chen Qiaoer burst into laughter. “Hahaha! Uncle, you’re really funny!”

When her laughter finally stopped, she turned to Huang Xiaolong and said seriously, “When we return to the palace, I’ll ask my father to give you the Nine Resurrection Purple Grass. With it, you will be able to recover very quickly!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at her in shock. This was their first meeting, but she was willing to give him a holy herb for him to recover from his injuries!

Staring straight into her eyes, Huang Xiaolong asked, “The Nine Resurrection Purple Grass is worth at least a hundred thousand holy bills… Are you sure you want to give it to me?”

A hundred thousand holy bills was nothing to him, but it was the thought that counted. There wasn’t a need to mention a hundred thousand holy bills. Huang Xiaolong could bring out a hundred billion Tuoshen dao coins if he so wished to. After subduing nearly six hundred Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables, including existences at the level of the Nine-Headed Tree Demon, his wealth reached an incredible level. Without caring about the amount of dao coins, he could drown a super sacred land in dao coins with a single thought!

Of course, the hundred thousand holy bills might mean nothing to him, but it was an incredible amount to a small country like the Apsara Dragon Country!

Chen Qiaoer revealed a brilliant smile and she explained, “I just feel like it! It’s just a hundred thousand holy bills! My Apsara Dragon Country is more than capable of taking out an amount like this! Moreover, the amount we can sell it for will only allow someone to meditate for ten days on the Soaring Dragon Terrace.”

The corners of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curled upwards, and he no longer continued his line of questioning.

It didn’t take long for them to finally arrive at the capital of the Apsara Dragon Country. Initially, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t planned on staying in the palace. However, Chen Qiaoer was adamant about bringing him in, and she personally arranged a residence for him.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t refuse, and he allowed her to do whatever she wished.

At night, Chen Qiaoer really appeared with the Nine Resurrection Purple Grass, and Huang Xiaolong could only laugh wryly when he looked at it. It seemed like the little girl really thought that he was injured after failing his tribulation!
