Not long after Huang Xiaolong left the half-shattered mountain peak, other forces’ experts arrived consecutively.

Tan Zhihui and the Three Skull Ancestors’ battle had alerted them.

“Qian Qinyue!”

“Qian Haoran!”

As more experts arrived, their attention fell onto the corpses of the nine people that had wanted to search Huang Xiaolong’s soul but were smashed deep into the ground by one of the four odd beasts.

“Qian Qinyue, Qian Haoran, and the others were the Thousand Constellation Country’s Old Ancestors who have been in seclusion for a very long time. How did they end up being killed at this place?”

“What a powerful strike!”

“This is certainly made by a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert!”

Looking at the giant claw print on the ground, everyone was more than a little apprehensive.

“But these poisonous palm imprints around this corpse are not made by the same person. Moreover, these poisonous palm imprints are slightly weaker than the claw imprint that killed Qian Qinyue and Qian Haoren.”

“Then, there are three different groups?”

Various guesses ran through these people’s heads.

On another side, Huang Xiaolong had the four odd beasts, Radiance Angels, one hundred Undead Netherguards, and a group of Ice Dragons drive the Tushita Flying Ship to chase after the Glaze Devil Stele at the fastest speed possible.

The distance between Huang Xiaolong and the Three Skull Ancestors narrowed little by little.

But the Three Skull Ancestors’ speed was shockingly fast. Although the distance between them was diminishing, it would take the Tushita Flying Ship several hours to catch up.

Within an hour, Huang Xiaolong gained a million miles and got closer to the Three Skull Ancestors.

Two hours later, he gained two million miles on them.

Three hours later, Huang Xiaolong had gained another million miles.

A spark of excitement flitted across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

He planned to make his move in the next hour.

The four odd beasts could block the other side in the remaining two million miles distance in another hour.

Seeing the distance between them had shortened by the second, he suddenly lost his induction on the Glaze Devil Stele. Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded for a second. He increased the Blood Eye Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s resonance, but he still could not sense the Glaze Devil Stele’s existence.

What’s going on? Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Feeling baffled, Huang Xiaolong once again spurred the Blood Eye Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele, but he still failed to sense the Glaze Devil Stele’s existence. It was as if the Glaze Devil Stele had disappeared from the world.

A light flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He could not sense the Glaze Devil Stele, but that didn’t mean that the other side had successfully refined the devil stele. The most logical explanation could be that the other side had taken the Glaze Devil Stele into another space!

The Blood Eye Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s resonance with the Glaze Devil Stele was interrupted in another space.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong’s Tushita Flying Ship stopped where he had last sensed the Glaze Devil Stele’s location.

In front of Huang Xiaolong was an enormous entrance of a space tunnel.

Lu Xiaoqing’s face paled as she exclaimed, seeing this space tunnel, “Famish Devil Tunnel!”

“Famish Devil Tunnel?” Huang Xiaolong looked at her with a baffled expression.

Lu Xiaoqing explained, “This Famish Devil Tunnel leads to the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, one of two biggest and most dangerous ancient battlefields of our Kingdom of Devil Beasts. Although the commonly known pathway into the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield is located in the Heaven Devouring Empire, the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield itself is not located within the Heaven Devouring Empire. More accurately, the ancient battlefield is not anywhere in the Kingdom of Devil Beasts.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded as he listened. He did not ask Lu Xiaoqing any more questions, but he indicated others to fly the Tushita Flying Ship into the space tunnel.

The moment the Tushita Flying Ship entered the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, sharp howls sounded from the other end of the tunnel.

These howls penetrated the soul, inflaming one’s anger and other negative emotions.

“These are the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield’s ancient netherspirits’ howlings. These ancient netherspirits are what remain of the Devil Race and devil beasts’ experts who died here, even after so many years. It’s impossible to kill these netherspirits in this Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield.” Lu Xiaoqing continued to explain to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. It seems like the other side had run in there with the intention of hiding and refining the Glaze Devil Stele.

A cold sneer curved up the corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips. He couldn’t wish for a better location. It was much more convenient for him that the other side had chosen to hide in there. He could refine the Glaze Devil Stele there before going out.

A dozen breaths later, the dark space tunnel brightened as Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at a bleak, grim, and chilly space.

The Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield!

The moment Huang Xiaolong was within the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, his induction towards the Glaze Devil Stele returned.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly ordered the Tushita Flying Ship to chase after the other party quickly.

Since the other side had entered into this Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried they would run out again. Hence, Huang Xiaolong followed at a certain pace, and it was not as hurried as before.

They were still in the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield’s periphery, and Huang Xiaolong intended to take action when they entered the middle or center region.

It was as Huang Xiaolong had guessed—after entering the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, the Three Skull Ancestors did not stop at all. They sprinted towards the deeper region.

The Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield encompassed a great land surface, enshrouded in rich devil qi and death qi. Wind howling in the ears like a noisy passing train.

Then again, as loud and turbulent as these howling winds were, they failed to blow away the dense devil qi and death qi. The devil qi and death qi in this ancient battlefield space had been accumulating for billions of years.

Suddenly, there was a wave of booming roars. A herd of strange-looking beasts was attacking the Tushita Flying Ship. These beasts were over ten meters tall, and they had lifeless gray fur, long arms, and sharp claws.

The strength of these monsters was not very high. Most of them had the strength of a First-Order and a Second-Order Emperor Realm. However, when they attacked, they exuded an overwhelming death qi that amplified their attack to the level of a Third-Order Emperor Realm.

These monsters were actually the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield’s netherspirits. Although they had fur, flesh, and blood, they did not have a piece of bone, nor veins or meridians. Their entire body was a unique condensation of devil qi and death qi.

Huang Xiaolong had the four odd beasts directly sweep away the attacking netherspirits.

The Tushita Flying Ship’s speed was not affected in the slightest. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Roughly two weeks later, Huang Xiaolong had reached the deeper region of the Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield.

Huang Xiaolong stopped as he sensed that the Glaze Devil Stele’s movement had stopped.

Two minutes later, the Tushita Flying Ship came to a stop before an empty, open space.

According to his induction, the Glaze Devil Stele was on the barren land ahead. It seems like the other side has planned to refine the Glaze Devil Stele in the depths of this barren land.

Huang Xiaolong put away the Tushita Flying Ship and then ordered the four odd beasts, Radiance Angels, and the Undead Netherguards to converge their auras, leaving the seventy-plus Ice Dragons on the surface.

These seventy-plus Ice Dragons were enough to deal with the other side.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong had already learned that the other side consisted of three peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts. In short, there was no Sovereign Realm amongst them, which was a relief for him.

With seventy-plus Ice Dragons around him, Huang Xiaolong ordered them to attack at full force. In an instant, frigid ice qi flooded out like an iceberg-tsunami rolling onward, submerging the entire barren land—the dense devil qi and death qi above the barren land frozen into ice.

The barren land turned into a solid land of ice. There were layers upon layers of hard ice.

Following this, three figures broke out from under the ground.
