Chapter 2729: Chufan Sacred Land

“Cangqiong Dao Palace!”

The instant they saw the Cangqiong Dao Palace, the disciples from Cangqiong Sacred Land exclaimed in unison. Even the members of the Chufan Sacred Land were taken aback. Chu Zhouyun was no different.

“You are?” Wang Xueru asked suspiciously as she looked at Huang Xiaolong.

She remembered her master saying that he used to possess the dao artifact. It was the core treasure of the Cangqiong Sacred Land, but he had given it to his direct disciple, Huang Xiaolong. Didn't master say that he wasn’t in the Divine Tuo Holy World?

“Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong knew that the old man had told her about his existence when he saw her expression.

Indeed, “You… You are master’s direct disciple, Huang Xiaolong!”

With her talent, she would be accepted as the direct disciple of any sacred lands. However, she could only be the Cangqiong Old Man’s named disciple due to Huang Xiaolong’s existence.

For the past few years, she had been curious about Huang Xiaolong. She wanted to know how he looked, and how talented he was. She was also dying to know how he became the Cangqiong Old Man’s direct disciple.

After getting past the initial surprise, she started to inspect Huang Xiaolong more closely.

She discovered that there was nothing special about him other than his slightly outstanding appearance. His cultivation was even lower than hers! She was a mid-Ninth Heaven True Saint, but he was only an early-Ninth HeavenTrue Saint!

She couldn’t help but feel a sense of disappointment spreading through her heart.

When Wang Xueru was feeling disappointed, Chu Zhouyun, who was sent flying earlier, screamed with rage, “Brat, you’re from the Cangqiong Sacred Land too! Are you the old foggy’s disciple? I don’t care where the hell you came from, but you better kneel and start begging for my forgiveness! If you refuse, I’ll kill you and exterminate the Cangqiong Sacred Land!”

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.

The Cangqiong Sacred Land was a power that had emerged not too long ago! Including the Cangqiong Old Man, there were barely any Primal Ancestors holding down the fort! It wouldn’t be difficult for a power like the Chufan Sacred Land to exterminate them.

Now, a random person claiming to be Cangqiong Old Man's direct disciple had the guts to injure him!

He pointed at Huang Xiaolong angrily, “Get your *ss here right now!”

As soon as the words left his lips, he was sent flying. This time, he smashed through countless mountains before falling into a stinky swamp.

The person who had attacked this time was Zi Dongping.

Other than Fei Yanzi, Zi Dongping was the weakest of the bunch. He had no choice but to deal with the trouble before his seniors could step in. After all, Chu Zhouyun was nothing more than a fly in front of all of them.

“Senior Brother Zhouyun!” The disciples from Chufan Sacred Land screamed as they ran towards the swamp.

Even Wang Xueru and the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land were shocked.

Looking at Dong Ziping, the surprise in Wang Xueru’s eyes was apparent. Another Primal Ancestor?

Evidently, she didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would have two Primal Ancestor experts by his side. From what she could see, Zi Dongping and Fei Yanzi were both First Resurrection Primal Ancestors.

She couldn’t understand why they would be serving a mere True Saint like Huang Xiaolong.

One had to know that it wouldn’t be cheap to hire a Primal Ancestor Realm bodyguard.

It was said that some of the super chambers of commerce rented out experts in the Primal Ancestor Realm. The cost was calculated in blocks of time, and a bunch of holy spiritual jade stones would be required to rent out a Primal Ancestor for a single day!

Wang Xueru hesitated before saying to Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, Chu Zhouyun is a direct disciple of one of the grand elders in the Chufan Sacred Land, and his position is pretty high.”

Even though she didn’t say it explicitly, she was undoubtedly trying to remind Huang Xiaolong not to offend Chu Zhouyun.

How could Huang Xiaolong not understand the meaning behind her words? However, a smile formed on his face and he chuckled, “Don’t worry, they’re just a small sacred land.”

The patriarch of the Chufan Sacred Land was a peak mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor. With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, a single slap was all it would take to blow him up into pieces.

Wang Xueru frowned when she heard what he said. Even though he’s still a True Saint, he’s an arrogant kid. How can he speak about the Chufan Sacred Land so casually?

She really didn’t know what her master saw in him to accept him as his direct disciple. Not to mention the fact that even the Cangqiong Old Man wouldn’t dare to slight the Chufan Sacred Land.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In her eyes, Huang Xiaolong was arrogant, ignorant, and unaware of his surroundings.

“The patriarch of the Chufan Sacred Land is a peak mid-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor!” Wang Xueru reminded. From her point of view, she felt that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t know how strong they were since he was new to the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Upon hearing her reminder, Huang Xiaolong smiled and said, “I know.”

Wang Xueru was stunned, as she looked at Huang Xiaolong with a strange expression on her face.

The disciples from the Chufan Sacred Land finally helped Chu Zhouyun up, and his face was pale as he screamed, “You… You guys!”

Killing intent surged through his heart.

“I’ll cripple you if you continue talking,” Huang Xiaolong said with indifference.

Chu Zhouyun was startled for a second, but he sneered, “Good, good, I’ll remember this.”

“Let’s leave!”

Suppressing the killing intent in his heart, he brought the disciples of the Chufan Sacred Land away.

Wang Xueru sighed when she saw the enraged Chu Zhouyun. “I’m afraid you have greatly offended them!”

“If they dare to act out of line, I’ll kill them all,” Huang Xiaolong muttered casually.

After hearing his arrogant tone, Wang Xueru couldn’t help but feel a little angry. “Exterminate the Chufan Sacred Land? Do you think a Ninth Heaven True Saint like yourself will be able to do something like that?!” Wang Xueru questioned.

“Yeah.” He nodded his head in response.

Wang Xueru was stunned, speechless. The other disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land were staring at him weirdly. If not for the fact that he had the Cangqiong Dao Palace, they might have already laughed in his face.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong’s impression of them was extremely bad after their first meeting. From what he saw, they were all spineless kids.

“We are heading to the Convent of the Wind and Clouds. What about you? Are you going to meet the Master?” Wang Xueru asked as she suppressed the rage in her heart.

“I’m here to help you guys.” He continued, “When I was in the Singularity Sacred Land, I met a few of their disciples and overheard them saying that Tang Jin and Yuan Yue were plotting against you guys.”

Wang Xueru widened her eyes in shock. She finally realized that it wasn’t a coincidence for him to appear. After hearing that they were in danger, he had come all the way out to help them out.

Her impression of him started to change.
