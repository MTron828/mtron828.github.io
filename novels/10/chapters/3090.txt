Chapter 3091: You Missed Your Chance

When the Myriad Formation Devil touched Huang Xiaolong, a burning flame scalded him. It was the same flame emitted by the Old Monster Flame. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As the fire danced about the old devil’s fingers, it climbed up his arm like a flesh-eating monster.

In a fit of shock, the Myriad Formation Devil retreated several million miles. After using the power of darkness to counter the flame on his arm, he saw that it finally started to subside.

“Power of absolute blaze at perfection level!” the Myriad Formation Devil yelped in shock when he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Yuxuan couldn’t help but turn to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. It was obvious she didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to possess so much power.

With his ability to use the power of absolute blaze at perfection level, he was more than capable of entering the Extermination List.

Even Xiao Yuncheng, the Prince of Origin, wasn’t as strong as him!

Xiao Yuncheng might have comprehended three types of absolute energies, such as the power of wind, earth, and blaze, but his ability to wield the power of absolute wind was at the minor completion stage, and it was his strongest move! As for the power of absolute blaze, he barely managed to comprehend it in the Heavens Burial Lands!

“Hehe, young man, you managed to surprise me. Even so, your fate remains sealed.” The Myriad Formation Devil sneered. “If Lei Yu can’t change your fate, neither can you.”

Huang Xiaolong got to his feet slowly, and the light around his body disappeared. He looked at the old devil and sighed. “If you had chosen to run away previously, you might have lived. However, you missed your chance.”

The Myriad Formation Devil stared at him with a frown on his face.

Feng Yuxuan and her maidservants looked at Huang Xiaolong with a weird look on their faces.

Upon bursting into laughter, the Myriad Formation Devil’s body started to flicker as his voice boomed through the air.

“Hahaha! Who the f*ck do you think you are?” The old devil laughed for ten whole breaths of time before turning his attention back to Huang Xiaolong. “Kid, do you really think you’re stronger than the world master of the Origin Holy World?”

“Or are you trying to tell me that the Destiny Patriarch isn’t a match for you?”

“Hahaha! Have you reached the level of the ancient gods?!”

The Myriad Formation Devil couldn’t control his laughter.

Ignoring the ramblings of the old devil, Huang Xiaolong merely flung out fourteen drops of the Liquid of Life. As it landed on the bodies of Lei Yu and the others, their injuries started to recover.

When Huang Xiaolong was busy looking at Lei Yu and the others, the old devil made his move. In the blink of an eye, he appeared before Huang Xiaolong, and he sent a palm shooting towards his chest.

Tearing through the lightning qi produced by the Purple Lightning Peak, his palm slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Sighing slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother defending himself.

The Myriad Formation Devil was shocked. He didn’t expect his attack to land so easily, but he didn’t have time to celebrate when a terrifying wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

When the energy emerged, the old devil gasped in shock. He had only felt such horrifying power twice in his life, and he retreated instinctively.

It was too bad he moved too slowly. A pillar of inky green light fell from the heavens and slammed right into the old devil’s body. He was flung several thousand miles away, and when he finally found his footing, he felt the blood in his chest rolling backwards.

He glared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. When he looked at the kid again, inky green flames had already formed a sea of fire around him. A mysterious aura filled the lands.

This…

“Nirvana flame!” The Myriad Formation Devil choked.

Feng Yuxuan was equally as shocked. If that was the nirvana flame, wouldn’t that mean…

Brushing off the palm print on his chest, the dent created by the old devil quickly restored itself, and Huang Xiaolong returned to his peak state instantly.

The reason Huang Xiaolong didn’t dodge the strike was because he wanted to test out the power of nirvana. He also wanted to see the difference between the power of nirvana at the major completion stage and perfection level.

As such, the Myriad Formation Devil became a good tool for him to play around with.

“Power of nirvana at perfection level!” the old devil screamed. His voice started to tremble as fear finally settled in his heart.

He was staring at someone who reached perfection level in the power of nirvana!

As long as the world wasn’t destroyed, no one would be able to kill him!

The old devil felt his brain hurting as there was no way to kill a freak at that level anymore.

Thoughts of retreating finally formed in the old devil’s mind. After all, he wouldn’t be able to kill the other party to snatch the treasures anyway.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to let the old devil leave. With a single step, he arrived in the space above the Purple Lightning Peak. With a punch, the power of poison and absolute frost shot towards the old devil. The heavens shattered as the earth cracked. Half the space around them started to corrode as the other half froze completely. Stars around them exploded, and horrifying cracks appeared in the space around them.

One punch was enough for Huang Xiaolong to eliminate the myriad of worlds!

Moreover, the speed of his punch wasn’t something the likes of the old devil could dodge.

With the blood draining from his face, the old devil’s eyes widened. The two powers Huang Xiaolong used against him made him feel a sense of threat like never before. Since he couldn’t dodge, he could only try his best to defend! Laying down grand formations one after another, he wanted to stop Huang Xiaolong at all costs! It was too bad his formations were shattered instantly by the two beams of light.

They either corroded or froze over completely, and Huang Xiaolong’s punch eventually landed on his body.

As he was flung backwards, Feng Yuxuan saw the armor around his body dissolving completely. He turned into an ice statue before she could blink!

Dark qi emerged from his body, and after several breaths of time, he finally managed to shatter the ice around him.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised that he managed to stop himself from freezing over. After all, the other party was ranked fourth on the Extermination List, and his power of darkness was also at perfection level. It wasn’t possible to defeat him with a single move. That said, Huang Xiaolong also knew that the old devil wouldn’t be a match for him.

The old devil was deathly pale when he finally got rid of the ice surrounding his body. It was clear that Huang Xiaolong’s strike caused him to suffer from serious injuries. Of course, the main reason he was struck was because he was careless. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have waited for Huang Xiaolong to unleash his punch before counter-attacking.

Taking deep breaths, the old devil stared at Huang Xiaolong with a terrified gaze. “You… You… You reached perfection level in both the power of poison and absolute frost!”

If Huang Xiaolong’s power of absolute flame at the large completion stage surprised him, his power of nirvana at the perfection level shocked him to the core. Now that Huang Xiaolong had revealed another two types of energies at perfection level, he was terrified.

The fourth-ranked expert on the Extermination List was starting to feel scared!

Moreover, he could tell that Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth was also at perfection level!

Feng Yuxuan stared at Huang Xiaolong with her eyes wide open. Her brain was buzzing non-stop, and she blanked out completely. There was no need to mention the two maidservants around her.

“Not bad.” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly as he looked at the old devil who was out of breath. “You’re not my opponent. Kneel and submit.”

The Myriad Formation Devil was shocked. However, he roared with laughter the next instant. “I might not be your match, but you’re dreaming if you think that you can make me your servant!” He stared at Huang Xiaolong and growled, “I’ll be back!” His body started to flicker as he tore through the skies in an attempt to leave.

If he really wished to leave, no one would be able to stop him.

However, his expression changed all of a sudden.

He looked at Huang Xiaolong with an enraged expression, and he roared, “You… How dare you!”

“That’s right. I’ve laid down the Sun Moon Grand Formation in the space around us. I already told you that it’s too late for you to leave.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

The reason he had allowed Lei Yu and the rest to resist the attacks alone was because he was busy setting up the formation!
