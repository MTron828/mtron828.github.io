Chapter 368: Peace Emperor World

The Asura Order appeared, raising a storm!

Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu felt excitement coursing through their veins, they had long been waiting for this day!

Huang Xiaolong turned around. Seeing the confounded expressions on his parents and siblings’ faces, he told them a short version of the story relating him and Asura’s Gate. Many years had passed since Huang Xiaolong found the Asura Ring, but he had never mentioned it to his family. All these years, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Min, and Huang Xiaohai never knew Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, Yu Ming, Haotian, and Fei Hou’s real identities.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s explanation, everyone felt like all the puzzle pieces fell into place.

“Then, Long’er, you want to go to Starcloud Continent?”After hearing her son’s explanation, Su Yan asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded: “Yes, Mother.”

Asura’s Gate headquarters was located on Starcloud Continent, to reclaim the Sovereign position, Huang Xiaolong had to go to the Starcloud Continent!

Huang Xiaolong already had sufficient strength to fight for it, and win!

“When are you leaving?” Su Yan asked again.

“Ten days later.” Huang Xiaolong answered with solemnity in his tone. He knew that his mother was disheartened, which was why he stayed a few more days before departing.

For the next ten days in the Eminent Holiness’ cultivation space, Huang Xiaolong practiced at night to stabilize his recent breakthrough and enhance his battle qi cultivation, while during the day, he would spend time with his family, talking or guiding their cultivation, including Fei Hou, Haotian, and others.

In the days after Huang Xiaolong entered closed-door practiced, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and Huang Min refined the true dragon essence and Divine Dragon Pills, all three of their battle qi cultivation finally accumulated to Houtian Tenth Order, due to their innate talent limitations unable to breakthrough to Xiantian realm.

Haotian, who was Luo Tong Kingdom’s sole Marshal, reached late-Xiantian Third Order. Whereas Yu Ming was now a half-Saint realm expert, his breakthrough to Saint realm would depend on his fortune.

Ten days passed by quickly.

Huang Xiaolong departed from the Eminent Holiness’ space. On this journey to the Starcloud Continent, only Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu accompanied him. Although the Eminent Holiness’ cave was at the bottom of the cold lake beneath the Broken Tiger Rift, Huang Xiaolong still left Yu Ming, giant ghost Feng Yang, and the others as a precaution, just in case...

Before leaving, Huang Xiaolong gave Yu Ming one hundred Ghost King Dans. He himself refined these Ghost King Dans, spurring his comprehension of space law to break into the Saint realm. Huang Xiaolong only used a small number of them, leaving quite a lot in the ring. Yu Ming followed him for many years, so Huang Xiaolong hoped that he could advance into the Saint realm too.

Receiving Huang Xiaolong’s Ghost King Dan, Yu Ming knelt down in gratitude, thanking Huang Xiaolong with tears streaming down his face, refusing to get up for a long time.

After being sent off by everyone’s reluctant gazes, the three of them, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu left the Eminent Holiness’ cultivation space, flying all the way up to the high peak of the Broken Tiger Rift.

Winter was coming and gusts of cold winds blew strongly. Standing at the peak of the Broken Tiger Rift, their robes fluttered in the cold wind.

“Sovereign, are we heading to Starcloud Continent right away?” Zhang Fu asked. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong wore a somber expression, “To the Luo Tong Kingdom first!”

Lu Kai was his good brother. Although Huang Xiaolong still couldn’t annihilate Deities Templar at this moment, he could, however, collect some interest.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s intention to go to the Luo Tong Kingdom, both instantly understood his meaning.

A sharp light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s pupils and he flew off the peak with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu following from behind in the Luo Tong Kingdom’s direction.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group of three was heading toward the Luo Tong Kingdom, a huge storm descended on the Starcloud Continent and Wind Snow Continent. Ten days ago, after receiving Huang Xiaolong’s order, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu had issued the Asura Order to all of Asura’s Gate Elders, Domain Leaders, and disciples.

Once the Asura Order was out, it sent shock waves through the forces in all directions.

“Huang Xiaolong is actually the previous Asura’s Gate Sovereign’s closed-door disciple! He even possesses the Asura Ring!”

“Asura’s Gate previous Sovereign, Ren Wokuang has been missing for more than eighty years, who knows if this is true or false. But since the Asura Order was announced by the Left and Right Custodians, it is most likely true!”

“One year ago, Asura’s Gate Sovereign Chen Tianqi announced to the world that he is Asura’s Gate Sovereign, succeeding the position, now there’s a good show waiting for us!”

“I heard that Chen Tianqi has formed an alliance with Bedlam Lands’ Sin City, even if Huang Xiaolong has the Left and Right Custodians’ support, I fear that wanting to snatch back the Asura’s Gate position won’t be so easy!”

Similar discussions were happening everywhere.

Although Huang Xiaolong disappeared from the public for three years in closed-door practice, his name rang louder than it ever had before. Following the ending of the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins expedition in the Origin Forest, after returning to their respective forces, Huang Xiaolong’s name even spread to the Ten Directions Continent.

This time, with the Asura Order out on Huang Xiaolong’s orders, it shook the various forces. The attention placed on Huang Xiaolong exceeded any one person. Making their way to the Luo Tong Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu also heard this news.

“Sin City’s Castellan?” Huang Xiaolong heard that Chen Tianqi allied with the Sin City’s Castellan, a light flickered in his eyes. If Sin City’s Castellan really interfered in this matter, then it would pose some difficulties in taking back the Asura’s Gate.

Then, Huang Xiaolong recalled that when he was in the City of Myriad Gods, Zhao Chen was against him from the beginning. At that time, Huang Xiaolong did not understand why, because there was no feud between them. But now he knew, Chen Tianqi was behind it.

“How much do you both know about Sin City?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu.

Zhao Shu hesitated for a moment before saying, “Sovereign, Sin City’s Castellan, Zhao Yi, is not someone of our Martial Spirit World!”

Both Huang Xiaolong and Zhang Fu were stunned.

“Not someone of our Martial Spirit World?!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in surprise.

Zhao Shu nodded, “Zhao Yi comes from the Peace Emperor World’s Zhao Clan.”

“Peace Emperor World, Zhao Clan!” Zhang Fu sounded shocked, evidently, he had heard of this Peace Emperor World’s Zhao Clan.

Huang Xiaolong turned to Zhang Fu.

“Comparing this Zhao Clan and Deities Templar, who is stronger?” A moment later, Huang Xiaolong asked gravely.

Zhao Shu shook his head, “I don’t know. No one knows Deities Templar’s real strength, and no one knows Zhao Clan’s real strength either. In fact, Sovereign, I am also a member of Peace Emperor World’s Zhao Clan.”

“You’re also a member of the Zhao Clan?!” This piece of information genuinely shocked Huang Xiaolong. Zhang Fu looked flabbergasted at Zhao Shu. Judging from his reaction, this was his first time hearing that Zhao Shu was a member of Peace Emperor World’s Zhao Clan.

Zhao Shu nodded, “That year, I was being chased by enemies, it was Sovereign who saved me. After that, I stayed at Asura’s Gate. Even though I am a Zhao clan member, the Zhao Clan has over a hundred branches, me and Zhao Yi belong to different branches of the clan.”

Peace Emperor World’s Zhao Clan had existed for ten thousand years, it’s branches expanded all over, it wasn’t strange for the clan to have over a hundred branches.
