Huang Hongtian looked on foolishly as the force of his Nine Phoenix Scorching Sky Palm was devoured until there was nothing left, dully mumbling, “Gone?”

Huang Xiaolong responded with a faint smile, shrugging his shoulders at Huang Hongtian: “Gone.”

Huang Hongtian’s gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong’s faint smile. His face became sickly green, worse than a man finding out his that wife had cheated on him.

“I’ll carve into your soul the tragedy of provoking a Highgod Realm master!!” Huang Hongtian spat out every word through gritted teeth, his cold voice penetrating to the bones.

The Phoenix Clan Grand Elders felt the chills down to their butt cheeks.

Then, in a flicker, Huang Hongtian was outside the Phoenix Clan headquarters’ main hall. Huang Xiaolong followed, disappearing from the hall just as quick and appearing in the high air.

Whichever place they fought in was the same to Huang Xiaolong. However, it seems like this Huang Hongtian was about to revert to his phoenix form.

As expected, bright flames spread, enveloping Huang Hongtian entirely. His body quivered lightly and in the next moment, his body transformed into a thousand zhang tall phoenix covered in glorious seven-colored flames, like a coat.

The seven-colored flames caused space to ripple in all directions!

An overwhelming divine phoenix might rush out from Huang Hongtian’s body.

Watching Huang Hongtian revert to his phoenix form, Huang Xiaolong summoned his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits and soul transformed. At the same time, frigid cold Asura qi swirled around him.

Just like before, the Asura frigid qi was the darkest of black interwoven with strands of eerie red energy.

Black and red, hot and cold.

Huang Hongtian’s Flame Barrier and Huang Xiaolong’s Hell Asura Barrier formed a vivid contrast. However, the friction between the two opposing forces was more violent than the last.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi stood in the distance as if he had no intention of intervening. He believed in Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, defeating the Phoenix Clan’s Patriarch was no problem.

“Phoenix Takes Flight!” Huang Hongtian’s piercing voice reverberated for miles in the sky.

Huang Hongtian’s phoenix form spread its magnificent wings, coming together again to the front. His wings shot out giant wind blades that bore seven-colored flames, piercing towards Huang Xiaolong.

Each giant wind blade reached a thousand zhang in length, one longer than the other, bearing even more terrifying phoenix flames.

Phoenix Takes Flight was a unique innate skill of the phoenixes, just like the dragons’ Dragon’s Roar soundwave attack, and it was one of the most powerful attacks of Phoenix Clan.

There was a time when Huang Hongtian used this skill to cut an indomitable looking mountain in the deepest parts of the Fire World into more than a hundred pieces.

Watching the giant wind blades flying toward himself, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, but he did not dodge nor retreat. Instead, he flew forward head-on. A golden light flashed as his fists punched at the giant phoenix blades.

In the far distance, the Phoenix Clan Grand Elders were dumbfounded when they saw this. There was actually someone who was wanted to use fists of flesh to counter their Patriarch’s Phoenix Takes Flight?!

In that instant, everything seemed ridiculous all of a sudden.

Right at the same time, a layer of true immortal essence fire appeared over Huang Xiaolong’s fists as they collided with the first giant wind blade.

A deafening boom reverberated as Huang Hongtian’s giant wind blade shattered before Huang Xiaolong’s fists.

The word ‘aghast’ doesn’t even begin to describe the expressions of the Phoenix Clan Grand Elders as they watched this result.

In that split second, the second giant wind blade approached Huang Xiaolong with alarming speed. Huang Xiaolong raised one of his fists and struck another punch out.

Then the third, the fourth...

As the booming blasts rang in the air above, giant wind blades were destroyed by Huang Xiaolong one after another.

At the end, more than a hundred of Phoenix Takes Flight’s giant wind blades dissipated.

Huang Hongtian’s eyes widened with shock staring at Huang Xiaolong. This human’s body was powerful to this extent?! He was rivaling an ancient fierce beast’s body!

No, it was even more frightening than an ancient fierce beast!

Not even an ancient of First Order Highgod Realm with strength similar to his could counter his Phoenix Takes Flight with only their physical force!

Huang Hongtian quickly got over his shock and the killing intent in his eyes rapidly rose.

“Phoenix Flame Tempest!”

His spread out wings folded behind him, then his entire phoenix body rotated at high speed, spattering flames all around as the tempest expanded, blowing in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

The force from the tempest blew away the nine layers of cloud in the sky.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong also leaped forward in a spin. Strong winds gathered around him, turning into numerous wind dragons.

This was the same skill Huang Xiaolong used in Peace Emperor World when he destroyed the Zhao Family’s headquarters and killed its disciples, Dragon Twirling Clouds. At that time, Huang Xiaolong was still an Eighth Order God Realm, but now, he was a late-Tenth Order God Realm.

The same skill was a hundred times more powerful displayed at his current strength.

A flight of dragons soared to the heavens as if they wanted to pierce a hole through it.

Dragons’ roars and cries of phoenixes.

The flames spattered and the wind blades whistled.

The sky darkened as if the end of the world was coming, the horrifying shockwaves reaching ten thousand li away.

The Phoenix Clan’s masters retreated even further in fear, those who were too slow were sliced into uncountable pieces of flesh by the horrifying shockwaves.

As Dragon Twirling Clouds and Phoenix Flame Tempest collided, after some time, the Phoenix Flame Tempest exploded all of a sudden. Huang Hongtian was knocked back by the flight of wind dragons, crashing into a mountain peak below. The mountain split open, rocks and boulders rolled down, and sand was flying in the sky.

The glorious flames on the surface of Huang Hongtian’s phoenix form dimmed as he was once again back in human form.

In the last collision, Huang Xiaolong’s true immortal essence fire caused great damage to Huang Hongtian’s phoenix qi, causing him to fail to maintain his pheonix form.

“You...!” Fear sprouted in Huang Hongtian’s heart looking at Huang Xiaolong this time.

Just now, when he executed Phoenix Flame Tempest, he used his full force, even deploying the godforce within his godhead, yet he still lost! He had thoroughly lost!

“I did not lose, it’s impossible! I’m a Highgod master, a divine beast phoenix, how can I lose to a late-Tenth Order God Realm human?!!” Huang Hongtian screamed, unable to accept this truth.

Not only him, but any Highgod Realm master defeated by a puny God Realm cultivator would also feel the same.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care. In a flicker, he was already in front of Huang Hongtian. Not wasting a word, Huang Xiaolong’s fist swung across Huang Hongtian’s left face.

A miserable scream shook the air as Huang Hongtian was thrown into the air and fell back down to the ground. When he landed, one could see that the left side of his face was swollen like a pig’s, no longer a phoenix.

“You dare hit my face!!” Huang Hongtian clutched his burning hot cheek. His eyes spewed anger, disbelief, and hatred glaring at Huang Xiaolong. But his words were slurred, intelligible due to his swollen left face.

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong reached him in a flicker, a fist swinging at the right side of Huang Hongtian’s face.

Once again, the Phoenix Clan Patriarch was sent flying.

The Phoenix Clan members were enraged seeing their Patriarch treated this way and wanted to rush up.

The Mulberry Sword appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand with a turn of his wrist, slashing out. Numerous sword qi rays flew out, injuring the Phoenix Clan’s Grand Elders and Elders.

“Which family’s junior dares to run amok in my Phoenix Clan?!” A dignified angry voice rang, echoing like an endless tide as flames engulfed Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was startled for a second, but he quickly activated Space Concealment and Phantom Shadow at the same time, dodging the lethal attack.

Joy rose to Huang Hongtian and the Phoenix Clan members’ faces hearing this angry voice. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent, ‘Looks like the Phoenix Clan’s Ancestor has arrived.’
