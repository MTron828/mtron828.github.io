Chapter 2402: Open the Four Seas Grand Formation!

When Huang Xiaolong heard that Lu Ding and company would return in half an hour, he immediately activated his three holy souls to search for them.

Very quickly, he discovered Lu Ding, Yu Fujiang, and the others.

“Mid-First Heaven True Saint, mid-First Heaven True Saint, and a peak of the early-First Heaven True Saint....” Huang Xiaolong quickly noted down their strength.

As for the others in the ship, they were merely half-True Saint Realm experts.

No longer afraid that anything would go wrong, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

Initially, he was afraid that the Beast Tamer Holy Gate would send out Second or Third Heaven True Saints. If that was truly the case, he could only blame his luck and leave. Now that Huang Xiaolong was sure the strongest person there was a First Heaven True Saint, he nothing else to worry about.

“Young Master, do we open the Four Seas Grand Formation?” The Departing Sword Sage asked.

“There’s no need to hurry. We can activate the grand formation after they enter.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and dismissed his concerns.

Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage were stunned. Was their Young Master going to trap them all in?

This...?

The opponents they would be facing were three First Heaven True Saints! Even though their Young Master had two great holy souls, they were still on the weaker side!

“Young Master, wouldn’t there be problems for us to let them in?” Chen Zhi hesitated for a moment and asked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and chuckled. “Just heed my orders and everything will be fine.” He was extremely clear about Chen Zhi’s concern.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong passed down the order to hold the opening of the grand formation. Entering the main hall of the Four Seas Holy Gate, Huang Xiaolong enjoyed several cups of tea while waiting.

Half an hour passed just like that.

As a massive flying ship appeared in the air, Lu Ding and the others finally arrived in the Four Seas Holy Gate.

“Brother Lu Ding, didn’t you notify the Eminent Elders to prepare for our arrival half an hour ago?” Yu Fujiang asked.

According to the speed of the Eminent Elders, they should have already arranged for a welcoming party in the main hall. The hall masters and grand elders should have lined up at the borders of the headquarters to welcome them.

However, not a single soul was in sight!

“I did inform Yu Jingjian half an hour ago.” Lu Ding frowned. “I even told him an hour ago that Brother Fujiang would be arriving with me!”

The more he spoke, the more confused he became. Even after observing his surroundings, he failed to notice a trace of fanfare.

Yu Fujiang couldn’t help but sneer. “What do you mean? Is this how you plan to welcome me? Even a Eminent Elder in your Holy Gate seems to be able to go against your orders. It seems like your orders are nothing but a fart in their eyes.”

It was clear that Yu Fujiang was thoroughly offended now that there was no grand welcome.

One had to know that he was the leader of the Holy Princes of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate. Regardless of where he went, he always received a warm welcome. However, the Four Seas Holy Gate didn’t even send a single disciple out to receive them!

Lu Ding noticed the anger in Yu Fujiang’s voice and a bitter smile formed on his face. “Brother Yu Fujiang, I definitely informed them to prepare a grand welcome! Please wait for a moment while I call Yu Jingjian over to kneel before you to scrub your shoes clean as an apology.”

Naturally, rage burned bright in Lu Ding’s heart. How dare the Eminent Elders defy his orders?

Of course, a trace of doubt appeared in his heart. He didn’t believe that Yu Jingjian would dare to ignore his orders. Was he tired of living?

Under the lead of Lu Ding, everyone slowly flew towards the main hall of the Four Seas Holy Gate.

Along the way, Yu Fujiang couldn’t help but grumble, “Lu Ding, just hand them over to me when you return. According to the rules of my Beast Tamer Holy Gate, everyone who refuses to listen to my orders will be stripped of their cultivation.”

Even though Lu Ding tried his best to placate this spoilt brat, the anger in his heart didn’t decrease in the slightest. He even called Lu Ding by his name.

Lu Ding’s expression sank the moment he heard Yu Fujiang’s idea. “This...” If it was any other Eminent Elders he was talking about, Lu Ding wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice them to appease Yu Fujiang’s anger. However, Yu Jingjian was a peak-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint!

“What? Are you unwilling to hand over a mere half-True Saint?” Yu Fujiang snapped.

“Brother Fujiang must be killing. As soon as I return, I shall hand him over to Brother Fujiang. You can do as you see fit.”

Only when he obtained Lu Ding’s assurance did the anger in his heart quell.

Very quickly, they arrived in the main hall of the Four Seas Holy Gate.

They quickly noticed that the entrance of the main hall was open, and everyone stared in shock when they noticed the happenings in the hall.

In Lu Ding’s designated seat was seated a young man none of them recognized!

Moreover, the Eminent Elders of the Four Seas Holy Gate were standing around him as they respectfully made their reports.

It was impossible for Lu Ding to control the anger in his heart when he noticed such a scene. In an instant, killing intent burst out from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. He released his aura in an instant and locked on to Huang Xiaolong.

“Brat, f*ck off!” Lu Ding screamed.

However, he was stunned silly in the next instant. His True Saint’s might was blocked before it could touch Huang Xiaolong.

Sitting there as though nothing had happened, Huang Xiaolong stared at Lu Ding.

He could see that Huang Xiaolong was a mere First Tribulation half-True Saint, and he had no idea how he managed to block the fury of a True Saint.

“You... You’re Thirteen from the Profound River!” Yu Fujiang seemed to have thought of something, and he asked.

Lu Ding was stunned for a second as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t expect Yu Fujiang to recognize the brat.

Since Yu Fujiang was able to recognize Huang Xiaolong, it was clear that he hadn’t removed his disguise.

“That’s right.”

A chuckle left Yu Fujiang’s lips. “Nice! I wasted so much time in the Profound River searching for you.... Now that you’re here, where’s the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast? Hand it over right now!”

Initially, they had searched for Huang Xiaolong’s whereabouts for a long time in order to capture the beast. However, they had failed to find all traces of him. Now that Huang Xiaolong had appeared before him, a sense of satisfaction formed in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong nearly burst out laughing when he heard Yu Fujiang’s request. He turned to Yu Jingjian and ordered, “Pass down my order. Open the grand formation!”
