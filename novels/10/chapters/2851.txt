Chapter 2852: Blue Lotus Pond

“What, Yu Chengming was…?!” Yu Xin was clearly shaken by the news.

Tai Zhaoyang looked at his son Tai Cheng and asked, “Long Jianfei said he would come to see your mother…”

Tai Cheng glanced at his mother Yu Xin and hesitated slightly before answering, “Yes, he…”

“He called your mother a sl*t in front of the Dragon Fish Creed’s Blue Rainbow branch, right?” Tai Zhaoyang straightforwardly said what his son hesitated to say.

Yu Xin’s face looked uglier.

Tai Cheng did not say a word, acquiescing in silence.

A cold light gleamed in Tai Zhaoyang’s eyes as he sneered coldly, “Long Jianfei has been acting brazenly ever since his return. Does he think his master is still around? Does he think he would be able to restore his Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple identity?! Without the identity of Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple, he’s merely a Long Family’s young master. That’s dog-shit!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Tai Cheng was surprised, “Father, you mean…?”

Tai Zhaoyang did not reply directly to Tai Cheng’s question, but he looked at the several Tai Family’s guards behind him and ordered, “If Long Jianfei dares to come to seek the mistress, there is no need to be polite and kill him on the spot.”

The several Tai Family's guards exchanged looks, and then respectfully complied, “Rest assured, Patriarch!”

“Send people to check Long Jianfei’s current location after leaving the Blue Rainbow City!” Tai Zhaoyang ordered the Tai Family experts.

……

After leaving the Blue Rainbow City, on the way back, Long Jianfei looked solemn as he said to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, even though I’ve registered my identity at the Blue Rainbow branch, and Li Yuan might report the matter upward, the Yu Family might do something in between to hinder the process. It might not be so easy for me to restore my identity.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement. He naturally thought of what Long Jianfei was talking about.

If Long Jianfei’s master was still around, the Yu Family naturally wouldn’t have dared to ploy anything against Long Jianfei. However, the fact remained that Long Jianfei’s master, Chen Xi, was missing for many years.

The Yu Family could be unscrupulous in their actions without Chen Xi around.

“However, my master’s relationship with the Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch is quite good. My master had helped him many times in the past, and the Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch knows the Dragon Fish Creed’s Foreign Affairs Hall Master. If the Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch is willing to help us a little, the issue of restoring my inner disciple identity will be resolved,” Long Jianfei told Huang Xiaolong his thoughts.

The meaning of Long Jianfei’s words did not escape Huang Xiaolong.

“Alright, let’s head to the Blue Lotus Creed now!” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and made a quick decision.

They were idle at the moment anyways, and restoring Long Jianfei’s identity was crucial. After all, it was related to whether he could enter the Dragon Fish Creed to find the Huang Long Armor or not.

Moreover, he knew that there was an enormous pill and herbs trading market close to the Blue Lotus Creed headquarters. Huang Xiaolong had long planned to take a look there.

He wanted to see if there were any grand dao pills or grand dao herbs as his supply had already dwindled down due to his recent snacking rate.

His cultivation had reached the pinnacle of peak late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and if he could get his hands on a batch of grand dao pills or grand dao spiritual veins, he would be able to breakthrough to Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor in a short time.

Thus, the three changed their direction in the middle of returning to the Monarch Yu Sacred Land and headed to the Blue Lotus Creed!

The Blue Lotus Creed was one of twelve creeds in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and although it was incomparable to the Dragon Fish Creed in terms of strength, the Blue Lotus Creed ranked in the middle, at sixth place, amongst the twelve creeds.

However, the Blue Lotus Creed was so far away from their current location, that it would take at least twenty days for them to reach there.

As for Long Jianfei’s father and those cursed previously had already been sent into a safe and secret space before the three of them had come out. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had laid out restrictions around the place, thus there was no need to worry about their safety.

This secret space was created with the power of Huang Xiaolong’s small world, and the restrictions around were also laid out using his small world’s power. Even if the Yu Family’s people found this space, they won’t be able to break through the restrictions around it, neither could First Esteem and Second Esteem Dao Venerables.

Unless the Yu Family could invite mid-level Dao Venerable experts to help them, it was impenetrable.

Clearly, this possibility was unlikely.

As they journeyed to the Blue Lotus Creed, Huang Xiaolong activated the concealment array on the Qilin Chariot so he could cultivate in peace. They only appear in public twenty days later.

“Are we there yet?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he stepped out from the void.

“Yes, Your Highness, we’ve already entered the Blue Lotus Creed,” Long Jianfei and Duan Feng respectfully replied.

“Your Highness, should we head over to the Blue Lotus Creed headquarters first or the trading market?” Long Jianfei asked for Huang Xiaolong’s opinion.

“To the Blue Lotus Creed headquarters first,” Huang Xiaolong answered seriously.

Since he was already here, there was no hurry to purchase grand dao pills.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng complied, and led the way to the Blue Lotus Creed for Huang Xiaolong.

“Your Highness, perhaps you can take a look at the Blue Lotus Pond,” as they headed to the Blue Lotus Creed headquarters, the Immemorial Ice Qilin suggested.

“Oh, the Blue Lotus Pond?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the Immemorial Ice Qilin.

The Immemorial Ice Qilin elaborated, “The Blue Lotus Pond is the Blue Lotus Creed’s most famous site. It is said that the Blue Lotus Creed has existed since the beginning of creation. The pond water contains the creation aura, and precious blue lotuses grow in the pond. There are different grades of blue lotus, but then again, even the lowest grade of blue lotus is as effective as a low-grade grand dao pill! The Immemorial Dao Venerable once obtained seven blue lotuses from the Blue Lotus Pond!”

Huang Xiaolong was delighted upon hearing that. “Really?”

“Yes.” The Immemorial Fire Qilin nodded in affirmation.

“However, why didn’t the Blue Lotus Creed try to make a place with this kind of precious treasure theirs?” Huang Xiaolong was curious.

Long Jianfei joined in the conversation, “The Blue Lotus Creed naturally had that thought, but the Dragon Fish Creed would be the first to object. Moreover, although the Blue Lotus Pond nurtures treasure like the blue lotus, it isn’t easy to find a blue lotus in the Blue Lotus Pond. Most of the time, even high-level Dao Venerable might come out empty-handed. Hence the Dragon Fish Creed decided to open the Blue Lotus Pond to the public, and any sacred land’s disciple can enter it to pick the blue lotus. As long as that disciple has enough talent and luck, the blue lotus belongs to whoever finds them.”

So it’s like that! It dawned on Huang Xiaolong.

“Even a high-level Dao Venerable is not guaranteed to find a blue lotus?” Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised.

Long Jianfei nodded, “That’s right, the blue lotus is spiritual, and has a certain level of awareness. These blue lotuses are protected by a kind of water-attributed restrictions. Hence, first of all, one must have a very high comprehension in water-attributed grand dao law to pick a blue lotus. Secondly, to be acknowledged by a blue lotus, one must have talent and luck, and neither one can be lacking.”

“Water-attributed grand dao restrictions.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered.

He had cultivated absolute frost energy, which was also a branch of the water-attribute, whereas in terms of talent and luck, he had always scored high in both. Not to mention, since the Blue Lotus Pond was born in the same era as the time of creation, perhaps his Huang Long Bloodline might have some effect?

Huang Xiaolong decided to visit the Blue Lotus Pond after the trip to the Blue Lotus Pond.

A few days later…

Huang Xiaolong’s group of three arrived at the Blue Lotus Creed headquarters.

However, not anyone could enter the Blue Lotus Creed headquarters. Therefore, the three of them were blocked by Blue Lotus Creed’s disciples when they reached a certain distance.

Huang Xiaolong’s group stated their purpose, which caused the Blue Lotus Creed’s disciples to look at them strangely. “You want to see our Creed Patriarch?”
