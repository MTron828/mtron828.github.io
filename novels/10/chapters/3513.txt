Chapter 3514: Yu Long’s Tracking

The Star Dragon Universe caused Huang Xiaolong to snap back to reality instantly. The happiness in his heart dipped to a freezing point.

Huang Xiaolong had never panicked so hard in his life. After all, he felt that it was a matter of time before he became a Universe God. However, things were different now. From what the Star Dragon Universe said, there would only be a single Universe God!

There were many Gods of Creation at the peak of their cultivation realm in the thirteen universes, and all of them had hopes of breaking through!

He hadn’t even reached the large completion stage!

“In fact, there’s no need for you to panic.” The universe continued, “It’s not that easy to surpass the God of Creation Realm. Look at Xu Long and Yu Long. They have been trapped in their current realm for an eternity, unable to break through!”

Even so, Huang Xiaolong didn’t manage to calm himself.

After asking the Star Dragon Universe a ton of questions, Huang Xiaolong finally put his chance to enter the universe origin to good use. The Star Dragon Universe was definitely a lot more experienced than his masters, the Blazing Dragon and Pangu!

Half a day later…

Huang Xiaolong emerged from the universe origin.

“Father, let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Huang Long after he got to his feet.

“We’re leaving?”

They had only been there for half a day, but they were leaving immediately!

“I’ve learned the way to stabilize your condition,” Huang Xiaolong replied.

Huang Long and the others were shocked.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You… You managed to find the Star Dragon Essence?!” Huang Long jumped in joy. However, he found it weird that none of the dragon eyes opened up. How in the world did Huang Xiaolong locate the Star Dragon Essence?

“Nope. I didn’t locate the Star Dragon Essence,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

?!

They stared at him as question marks formed in their minds.

“Let’s speak after we return,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. Since he made a promise to the Star Dragon Universe, he wouldn’t be able to leak any information on the Star Dragon Divine Tree. As such, he couldn’t explain himself to others.

“What about the cliff?” Huang Long pointed at the cliff and sighed. Huang Xiaolong traveled to the Dragon’s Impasse for several years in order to get the chance to comprehend the mysteries behind the Dragon Eyes Cliff, but he chose to return after half a day!

He risked his life in order to obtain the Star Dragon Scale in the Dragon’s Impasse for such an opportunity!

“Even if you comprehend the mysteries behind the cliff, we won’t be able to obtain the Star Dragon Essence,” Huang Xiaolong explained. “There’s no need for us to waste our time.”

Huang Long and the others stared at him in shock.

“Alright!” Huang Long eventually nodded when he saw how sure his son was.

Soon after, they left the area.

When Yu Long noticed how Huang Xiaolong and the entire group left after half a day, he was shocked.

“What in the world are Pangu and that brat scheming?” Chen Suan frowned. “How can he be sure that there’s no Star Dragon Essence in the Dragon Eyes Cliff?”

A light flashed in Yu Long’s eyes. “He definitely learned something when comprehending the mysteries behind the cliff. Otherwise, he won’t be so sure.”

Yu Long looked at the other eminent elders quietly.

“Principal, should we…”

“Get someone to track him down. See what he does,” Yu Long growled.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others returned to Lu Qianqian’s palace, he brought up the idea of leaving the Submerged Dragon Institution.

“Why are we leaving now?” Pangu raised an eyebrow in surprise, “What about the Star Dragon Essence?”

They went all the way over to the Submerged Dragon Institution in order to look for the Star Dragon Essence. But now, they were leaving before they got their hands on it!

Even though the Star Dragon Essence might not be in the Dragon Eyes Cliff, it might be somewhere else!

Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong as they were curious about the reason he wanted to leave.

“Even if we manage to find the Star Dragon Essence, it won’t be able to help.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “That is because the Star Dragon Essence is not strong enough.”

Pangu and the rest were taken aback by his revelation.

“How did you learn about this?” Pangu was doubtful of Huang Xiaolong’s newfound knowledge.

“I learned about it after discovering the secret behind the Dragon Eyes Cliff.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “A supreme existence in the cliff revealed the fact, and he also told me how to stabilize my father’s condition.”

Pangu looked at Huang Long and raised an eyebrow in suspicion.

“A supreme existence?” Pangu couldn’t help but ask, “Who did you see?”

“I am not able to reveal that.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “All I can say is that he’s an ancient existence, even older than Xu Long and Yu Long.”

It went without saying that the Star Dragon Universe was older than the two dragons. After all, they wouldn’t be born without the creation of the universe!

They stared at Huang Xiaolong in doubt when they heard what he said.

They didn’t expect an expert of that level to reside in the Dragon Eyes Cliff! One had to know that Xu Long and Yu Long were the publicly acknowledged oldest Gods of Creation in the Star Dragon Universe, and they were at the peak of the God of Creation Realm!

“Since that’s the case, we shall listen to Xiaolong,” Huang Long concluded.

Pangu nodded his head slowly.

Since there was nothing else to take care of, the entire group left after half an hour. With the little dragon following closely behind, they left for the Golden Radiant World.

As soon as Yu Long heard of Huang Xiaolong’s departure, a flash of confusion crossed his eyes. His instincts told him that their sudden departure had something to do with the Dragon Eyes Cliff.

“Principal, do we continue to track Huang Xiaolong?” Chen Suan asked.

“No. I’ll do it myself. All of you can fall back. With Pangu’s strength, he will be able to detect all of you.” Yu Long sighed.

…

Four months passed in an instant, and Huang Xiaolong brought everyone towards the south.

“Xiaolong, are we close?” Huang Long asked.

“We’ll arrive soon,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. He could tell that the river of light was close based on the universe’s directions. “We should be there in six days.”

“The old man is still following us…” The little dragon piped up all of a sudden.

Yu Long underestimated the little dragon. He felt that he could avoid detection with his abilities, but he was wrong.

“It’s fine. Let him do what he wants.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

After all, one could only enter the river of light with a special method. As such, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that Yu Long would find out about the secret of the Golden Radiant World.

Six days later, they arrived at the river of light.

The river of light was formed by several special beams that were created by the universe, and it was massive. Huang Xiaolong and the others couldn’t see the end of the river despite their cultivation.

“Follow me closely.” Huang Xiaolong said as he charged into the river of light. Everyone trailed closely behind.

Not too long after they entered, Yu Long appeared from the void. He stared at the river of light with his eyes flashing. He knew that there was a secret hidden in it as Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t have left the institution otherwise.
