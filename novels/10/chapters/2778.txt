Chapter 2779: Irrepressible?

The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land had more than five hundred Primal Ancestors, but only six of them were Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestors!

This early Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor intending to deal with Huang Xiaolong was called Xu Zheng.

In Xu Zheng’s opinion, no matter how powerful the illusion array around Huang Xiaolong was, it wouldn’t withstand the full force attack of a peak early Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

“Go ahead!” Chen Sen agreed to Xu Zheng’s request without hesitation. He nodded as his gaze on Huang Xiaolong turned sharper. He added, “There is no need to show mercy!”

“Yes, Patriarch!” Xu Zheng complied loudly and took several steps forward.

Other sacred lands’ experts stirred, seeing that Xu Zheng was about to make a move.

“With Eminent Elder Xu Zheng taking action, Huang Xiaolong certainly won’t be able to take the attack. Even if he has a powerful illusion array to help him, it’s still useless!” A sacred land’s patriarch commented confidently.

“Brother Qisheng, can you tell what kind of illusion array is around Huang Xiaolong?” someone asked Bao Qisheng. Bao Qisheng was the first person who had ‘discovered’ that Huang Xiaolong had arranged an illusion array in the area.

Bao Qisheng widened his eyes and looked around Huang Xiaolong with amazement in his eyes, “This illusion array has completely integrated with the Divine Tuo Holy World’s void, and there is no flaw or weakness at all. The strange thing is that an array formation of this size is not generating any energy fluctuation when it is running… What a sophisticated illusion array? The person who arranged this illusion array is simply brilliant.”

The crowd began guessing the strength of the person who had laid out such an incredible illusion array, and how high his accomplishment in array formations had reached.

In the Divine Tuo Holy World, there was an Array Formation Association which was a super powerhouse that was comparable with the top creed forces. These formation experts were ranked from low to high as formation apprentices, formation master, formation great master, formation grandmaster, formation great grandmaster, and formation prime master!

And above the formation ancestor master rank were god of formation with exclusive titles!

Yi Xiaotang watched as Xu Zheng strode towards Huang Xiaolong, and her beautiful eyes glimmered as she asked, “Aunt Qing, what do you think?”

Aunt Qing froze for a split second, and then smiled, “Does this situation still need an explanation? No matter how clever the formation master by Huang Xiaolong’s side is, it’s impossible to withstand the attack of an Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor’s attack.”

“I think that something isn’t right,” Yi Xiaotang stated as she looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong looks too calm.”

“Calm?” Aunt Qing took another look at Huang Xiaolong. Laughing softly, she said, “I’ve seen too many people that like to play tricks and act mysterious. Despite knowing fully well that they’re weak, they stubbornly put on a calm facade, not realizing that keeping one’s life is more important than one’s face. When Huang Xiaolong’s illusion array shatters under that Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor’s attack, he will be no different than an ant without the illusion array’s protection!”

While Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing conversed briefly, Xu Zheng stood right across Huang Xiaolong, fixing his cold stare on him. “Punk, let’s see if your illusion array is better or my attack is stronger!”

Without another word, grand dao energy swirled vigorously around him. An endless momentum of a Primal Ancestor swept out from his body, combined with the awe-inspiring rays of light that condensed into several grand dao spirits.

“Grand dao spirit! Xu Zheng could use his own grand dao energy to condense grand dao spirits!”

The various forces’ experts erupted in a furor.

Condensing grand dao spirit was not something all Primal Ancestors could do. This was mainly because the main condition was comprehension of a certain grand dao law at a certain threshold before one could successfully condense grand dao spirit based on one’s own grand dao energy.

Once one successfully condensed a grand dao spirit, that Primal Ancestor’s attack power would be greater than any same realm expert.

No one had any inclination that Xu Zheng could condense grand dao spirits!

Even experts of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land were astonished by this sight.

Only Chen Sen and Mo Fei didn’t look surprised by this. Xu Zheng could condense grand dao spirits for several decamilleniums. However, he had always been low-profile, and he had never used this method in front of others until today. Only the two of them knew about it in the entire Nine Revolutions Sacred Land.

Chen Sen had agreed without hesitation when Xu Zheng had requested to be the one to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson because he had confidence in Xu Zheng’s ability.

Yet, Huang Xiaolong was just as calm even after seeing the grand dao spirits around Xu Zheng. These were merely grand dao spirits. He could do it too. Moreover, the number of grand dao spirits he could condense were more than Xu Zheng’s, and they were more solid and ten times more powerful!

However, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to attack.

At this time, Xu Zheng moved his hands after condensing several hundred grand dao spirits, and the immediate heaven and earth seemed to tremble. Space energy was actually stripped off and flowed towards his hands, roiling and compacting between them, and finally turning into a ball of light!

It was a light ball that contained space energy, Xu Zheng’s grand dao energy.

Even though Xu Zheng hadn't attacked yet, everyone present could feel the terrifying destructive power inside the ball of light.

Even some Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor experts’ expressions turned serious.

“Go!”

Xu Zheng bellowed curtly as his hands pushed the ball of light forward, looking like he was pushing a great ancient mountain.

The ball of light rolled towards Huang Xiaolong, seemingly slow, but in reality, it was faster than a lightning bolt, and it reached Huang Xiaolong in a split second.

Space cracked wherever the ball of light passed by.

Nothing in its path could stop the advance of this terrifying ball of light.

Just as the ball of light was right in front of Huang Xiaolong, he raised his hand and pinned it in midair.

“What?!” Everyone was flabbergasted at this sight.

“This, this, what kind of illusion array is this?!”

“Could it be an illusion array laid out by a formation prime master?!” someone in the crowd mused out loud.

A formation prime master was the ancestor of formation masters. Their knowledge and understanding of array formations was beyond perfection, and it was as unfathomable as heaven and earth itself. But, there wasn’t a formation prime master in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave and the nearby heavenly caves.

Only a force like the Blue Heaven Creed had a formation expert at the level of formation prime master.

Both Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing looked just as flabbergasted. It’s unbelievable. Huang Xiaolong actually blocked that attack? On top of that, he blocked it so easily… They could see that Huang Xiaolong had not even broken a sweat, and it was as if he was holding an ordinary ball.

While everyone was in a dazed shock, Huang Xiaolong repeated his previous gesture. He slightly pushed his palm forward and sent the ball of light flying back towards Xu Zheng and the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts behind him at a faster speed. It shone brighter, and it was more lethal. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xu Zheng’s confident face changed completely.

All the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts paled.

Chen Sen and Mo Fei reacted almost immediately, bellowing loudly as their palms struck forward. Winds rushed and clouds roiled as the sky darkened…

Rumble!

Under Chen Sen and Mo Fei’s combined efforts, the terrifying ball of light exploded, releasing countless rays that shot out in various directions as a thunderous blast echoed in everyone’s ears.

Some didn’t dodge fast enough and were pierced by the rays of light, and blood-curdling cries filled the sky for a moment.

Even the experts spectating from afar, dodged to safety in a panic.

A transparent blue light barrier emerged from Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing’s body, protecting them. Even so, they swayed violently inside the protective barrier from the shockwaves.

Tumultuous tempest seemed to rage endlessly.
