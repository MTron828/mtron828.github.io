Many people in the square had the same query as Wang Biaoyuan in their hearts.

The gazes watching Huang Xiaolong fluctuated slightly. That’s right ah, this Huang Xiaolong was just a half-step God Realm. How did a half-step God Realm achieve 3.5 billion points?! Strong as a half-step God Realm was, there was no way their strength could reach such a terrifying point!

Jiang Shaoze, Xu Shaoqing, Jiang Wei, Li Mingxuan, He Xiu, Yang Shiqi, Su Meiyi, Zhu Haixiang, and all other geniuses that participated in the assessment had the same doubt and disbelief.

In truth, even Gudu Leng found it hard to accept the result just like that.

He himself was a God Realm ah, acknowledged as Gufu Family’s strongest genius! His talent was highly praised by their Gudu Family Ancestor.

Yet, he was actually defeated by a half-step God Realm warrior!

Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained aloof as he spoke, “How I achieved 3.5 billion points is not something I need to explain to you.” With that said, he turned around and walked toward the new disciple gathering area.

“Courting death!” When Wang Biaoyuan saw Huang Xiaolong turn around, ignoring him, fury exploded in his eyes and he bellowed, “Immovable Wisdom King’s Godking Fist![1]” Hurling a fist at Huang Xiaolong.

The air exploded from the sudden pressure.

Wang Biaoyuan’s punch gave the surrounding genius disciples an illusion that the surrounding air was like a large bubble about to pop.

Amidst shocked exclamations and gasps, everyone backpedaled or fled sideways to safety.

“This is the Wang Family’s divine rank battle kill that is not passed to outsiders, Immovable Wisdom King’s Godking Fist!”

“It is said that when one cultivates this skill to a certain stage, it can kill the enemy with just one punch. Moreover, even in death, that person will not move, standing immovable for ten thousand years!”

Shock filled the square.

Everyone’s attention was focused on Huang Xiaolong as they watched Wang Biaoyuan’s Immovable Wisdom King’s Godking Fist about to strike the young man’s back. Each of them wanted to know how Huang Xiaolong would respond to Wang Biaoyuan’s fist.

The Black Warrior Institute Elder Zhang Tianchuan was about to step forward to break the fight when a voice sounded in his ears, halting his action.

Before the fist was about to land, Huang Xiaolong suddenly turned around, his right palm extended out, wrapping over Wang Biaoyuan’s fist. The air blast sounds immediately died down, the chaotic airflow returned to normal.

And the surroundings were dead quiet.

The spectating crowd was dumbfounded. ‘This... actually works?!’

Not far away, Gudu Leng’s pupils needled watching this, an unnoticeable black light flitted passed, but inwardly, he was shocked. In that split second, a myriad of possibilities ran through his mind except for the result he was seeing.

Jiang Shaoze, Xu Shaoqing, and the rest were equally astounded.

With a slight push from Huang Xiaolong’s right hand, Wang Biaoyuan felt his body involuntarily stagger backward, being pushed dozens of meters back before he managed to regain his balance. Wang Biaoyuan’s face flushed beet red with fury as he stared at Huang Xiaolong: “You!”Without another word, a golden light burst out from his body, preparing to attack again.

“Others cannot interfere?” Huang Xiaolong remained stoic, cold gaze fell on the nearby Wang Family disciples.

Wang Biaoyuan looked at the Wang Family disciples around, barking, “This is a fight between me and him, no one is allowed to interfere!” His body once again burst out in a golden light as if a layer of golden qi enshrouded over his skin. A palpitating energy surged violently from Wang Biaoyuan’s body.

“Indestructible Vajra Physique!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Wang Biaoyuan has awakened his Indestructible Vajra Physique potential when he advanced to God Realm. The Indestructible Vajra Physique is very powerful, its defense is even scarier. At Wang Biaoyuan’s current strength, even a late-First Order God Realm cannot break past his defense!”

Seeing Wang Biaoyuan display his Indestructible Vajra Physique, the square was astir with excitement.

When Wang Biaoyuan displayed his Indestructible Vajra Physique, Gudu Leng’s cold expression was slightly tinged with a hint of sullenness. Admittedly, a Wang Biaoyuan applying the power of his Indestructible Vajra Physique was a strong enemy.

Huang Xiaolong observed Wang Biaoyuan for a moment with a calm demeanor. Since someone came knocking on his doorstep, he might as well ‘reveal’ a small portion of his strength, let the Black Warrior Institute have a good look.

Wang Biaoyuan attempted to attack him in public, yet no one from the Black Warrior Institute tried to stop him. Huang Xiaolong knew this was because the Black Warrior Institute also wanted to know the level of his strength, or more accurately said, they were suspicious of his 3.5 billion points?

By this point, Wang Biaoyuan had raised his momentum to the peak.

“You’re not using the sword?” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on the ancient sword hanging around Wang Biaoyuan’s waist. He could tell that this Wang Biaoyuan was a sword cultivator, one with proficient skills.

Wang Biaoyuan’s eyes were frosty, “Against you, I don’t need to use a sword.”

Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders at Wang Biaoyuan’s retort, since it is so, then he wouldn’t be polite.

“Nine-Nine Chained Punches! [2]” Wang Biaoyuan made a sudden lunge forward, both fists struck out with a killing intent. When his fists struck out, consecutive images of golden fists flew out, moving up and down, left and right, making it hard for anyone to predict their trajectory.

Huang Xiaolong harrumphed, dashing forward instead of maneuvering to dodge the attack, extending both his fists.

“Doesn’t this Huang Xiaolong know that Wang Biaoyuan’s Indestructible Vajra Physique fists are as hard as a demi divine artifact?! He still dares to fight head-on with Wang Biaoyuan with his fists!”

“It seems like this Huang Xiaolong’s fists are about to be wasted!”

Heads shook in pity as they watched.

A cold smirk crept up Wang Biaoyuan’s face watching Huang Xiaolong trying to counter his attack in the same manner, but a cruel light flickered in the depth of his eyes.

In a split second, four fists collided, and a thunderous explosion trailed behind.

The smirk on Wang Biaoyuan’s face stiffened as his muscles tensed, the cruel light in his eyes was replaced with an unknown trepidation.

He looked at Huang Xiaolong, but just as he was about to speak, a flood of horrifying power crashed against his whole person.

A sharp pain traveled from his fists, so strong that he couldn’t resist letting out an anguished scream. Wang Biaoyuan was sent flying back, repelled by the powerful force.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed with aggression. In a flicker, he appeared in the path of Wang Biaoyuan’s flying figure.

“Stop!” Wang Biaoyuan’s scream brought the Wang Family disciples and guards back to their senses. Four silhouettes rushed out, attacking Huang Xiaolong.

“Scram!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice reverberated like thunder, slapping a single palm at the four attackers. The four people’s actions froze in midair for less than a second before falling to the ground like meteors, crashing into the square at an even faster speed.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained unchanged as he added another palm strike on Wang Biaoyuan’s back.

Poof!

Blood flew out like arrows. Wang Biaoyuan was sent flying higher into the sky, his screams sounded weaker and further away, disappearing into the layers of cloud.

Gently, Huang Xiaolong feet touched the square ground once again, standing amidst a thick silence from all four directions.

The crowd sucked in a cold breath looking at the four Wang Family guards that were slapped to the ground by Huang Xiaolong, lying on the ground with half a breath left.

These four Wang Family guards were all late-First Order God Realm!

Late-First Order God Realm!

Done in with a single palm!

Seconds later, Wang Biaoyuan’s scream was heard again from the sky above, falling back down at high speed.

A booming crash resounded when his body hit the ground. Spider line cracks zig-zagged on the square surface.

When everyone finally laid their eyes on Wang Biaoyuan, to their horror, they discovered that little flesh remained on Wang Biaoyuan’s Indestructible Vajra Physique arms, and there was a glaring handprint that seemed to protrude slightly on his chest all the way from his back.

The crowd was dumbfounded, was this the Indestructible Vajra Physique that rivaled a demi divine artifact? If they did not witness the fight from the beginning, they’d have thought it was a paper tiger!

Gudu Leng looked at Wang Biaoyuan, lying there as if he was going to faint into oblivion anytime, his face muscle slightly twitched. Brutal, too damn brutal!

‘Is he still human?!’ His larynx shifted as he observed Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes swept over Gudu Leng, Jiang Shaoze, Xu Shaoqing, and the others. The message in his eyes to them was clear—Is there anyone else that would like to come up and question my strength?
