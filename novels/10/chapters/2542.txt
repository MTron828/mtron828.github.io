Chapter 2543: Son of Origin

A period of five years was not a long time, but these five years spent at the Cangqiong Dao Palace had benefitted Huang Xiaolong the most so far. In these five years, Old Man Cangqiong literally imparted to Huang Xiaolong everything he knew, from his grand dao, holy martial arts, array formations, and other various skills and profound knowledge.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t take a step out of the Cangqiong Dao Palace during these five years. In truth, he didn’t even leave the palace building Old Man Cangqiong resided in.

With his inextinguishable dao heart, Huang Xiaolong could understand Old Man Cangqiong’s preachings of his dao and holy martial arts before entering the Primal Ancestor Realm without trouble. As for array formations, pill refining, and other knowledge was also absorbed by Huang Xiaolong like a sponge.

Old Man Cangqiong was a hundred percent satisfied with Huang Xiaolong as his successor, and he was seen smiling from ear to ear everyday. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

There was a test on every floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor. Huang Xiaolong proved his excellence by being capable of passing the tests on these floors and becoming the person who finally obtained the inheritance. But Old Man Cangqiong had not expected this successor to be better than he had imagined. Infact, he was a hundred times better, no, a thousand times better! Maybe even ten thousand times better!

He wondered if Huang Xiaolong was the Holy World’s Son of Origin?

The Holy World’s Son of Origin was born from the core of the Holy World, enabling him to grasp every grand dao of the Holy World with little guidance, and he could comprehend deeper. Anything he cultivated required very little effort.

Then again, Old Man Cangqiong was aware that Huang Xiaolong was not the Son of Origin because the Son of Origin was born with the Origin Complete Dao Saint Godhead.

The Origin Complete Dao Saint Godhead ranked number-one!

Looking at his personal disciple, Huang Xiaolong, standing in front of him, Old Man Cangqiong couldn’t help telling Huang Xiaolong about the Son of Origin.

“The Holy World’s Son of Origin?” This information came as a surprise to Huang Xiaolong.

Old Man Cangqiong nodded. “Yes, the Holy World’s Son of Origin is a secret few people know about. Although your four masters are aware of this, none of them have ever mentioned it to you, right?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No.”

Old Man Cangqiong went on, “The Holy World’s Son of Origin is hailed as the cultivator with the strongest talent, and the future’s most powerful cultivator in the Holy World. From the moment he comes into the world, he has the Holy World’s first-ranked Origin Complete Dao Saint Godhead. Some time back, I had a small breakthrough in my grand dao and visited the Holy World’s core again. I calculated that the Holy World’s Son of Origin is likely to have been born!”

“However, I am unable to calculate his location, nor can I sense it,” Old Man Cangqiong added, “If you come across the Son of Origin in the future, remember to proceed with caution.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, and complied, “I understand Master. If that happens, I will have people pay attention.”

Contrary to Huang Xiaolong’s expectation, Old Man Cangqiong shook his head, then explained, “The Son of Origin is not necessarily a native of the Holy World, he can also be born in an alien land outside of our Holy World.”

“Alien land outside!” Huang Xiaolong was genuinely shocked.

Old Man Cangqiong confirmed, “Yes, although the majority of the super holy grounds categorize the alien land as the Holy World’s outer periphery, the alien land is in the same space as our Holy World.”

In the same space as our Holy World? A thought occurred to Huang Xiaolong, and he asked, “Master, you mean to say that outside our Holy World, there is another Holy World’s space?”

Old Man Cangqiong hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to ask such a question, and he considered his words before answering solemnly, “It seems that you have comprehended certain things as well. Yes, you are right. After my grand dao’s comprehension advanced, I could be certain that there is another Holy World’s space in existence outside our Holy World. It’s like two halves of the same whole apple, where both halves think that they are a whole apple which is not the case.”

“The reason I decided to choose my successor this time was because I plan to head to the Divine Tuo Holy World a few years later,” Old Man Cangqiong explained.

“Divine Tuo Holy World? The Divine Tuo Mountain?” Huang Xiaolong blurted in shock.

At the same time, Old Man Cangqiong’s eyes widened in surprise as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, then a wave of hearty laughter bubbled from his chest, “It seems like your comprehension towards the grand dao is stronger than I estimated, since you actually managed to touched the edge of the Divine Tuo Mountain’s secret.”

Huang Xiaolong became slightly embarrassed at having that pointed out, “Disciple barely felt it by chance.”

Old Man Cangqiong smiled as he went on, “No need to be humble. With your talent and current level of comprehension towards the grand dao, when you enter Primal Ancestor Realm, you will probably fully comprehend the Divine Tuo Mountain’s grand dao and powers, and then connect to the Divine Tuo Holy World. However, I’m afraid it would be difficult to return after going to the Divine Tuo Holy World.” He shook his head. “What I mean is, once you go to the Divine Tuo Holy World, there is no way to come back.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened and reluctance filled his chest.

Although the amount of time he had spent with Old Man Cangqiong was significantly short, their master-disciple relationship was not thinner than his feelings towards his four Holy Heavens’ masters. In these few years, Old Man Cangqiong had not held back in teaching him, and this had increased Huang Xiaolong’s gratitude towards him.

Old Man Cangqiong smiled to ease Huang Xiaolong’s heavy mood, “Don’t feel reluctant. Wait until you break through to Primal Ancestor Realm. After that, come find me in the Divine Tuo Holy World when you want to see me. That way, we, master-disciple, can still see each other again.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded sadly.

Primal Ancestor Realm? That was going to be tens of thousands of years later.

Even after having an inextinguishable dao heart, three holy souls, and three evolvable complete dao saint godheads, it would still take him more than ten thousand years to step into Primal Ancestor Realm.

After learning that Old Man Cangqiong planned to leave the Holy World to the Divine Tuo Holy World, Huang Xiaolong doubled his efforts to comprehend the lessons taught by Old Man Cangqiong.

As time flowed by, ten years passed.

By now, there were less than two decades until Saint Fate appeared. Originally, Huang Xiaolong had planned to head to the ancient battlefields to search for the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury after obtaining Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance, but now, he decided to delay the matter.

Even without the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury, after listening to Old Man Cangqiong’s teachings through these years and comprehending Old Man Cangqiong’s grand dao, Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls and inextinguishable dao heart had gone through subliminal improvements.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength had also risen during this period, entering the peak of mid-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint. By the time the Saint Fate were to appear, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to reach the peak late-Ninth Tribulation.

Another ten years went by.

On this day, Old Man Cangqiong said, “Xiaolong ah, I have passed all I know to you. The rest depends on your effort in cultivation and further comprehension. I hope you can create a dao art that is unique to you, and let it become the Holy World’s strongest dao art!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head with determination. “Rest assured, Master. Your disciple will bear in mind all of your teachings.”

Old Man Cangqiong stood up and said slowly, “In these twenty-five years, you listened to me speak about the grand dao everyday, and haven't taken one step out from this Cangqiong Dao Palace. Go on now as it’s time for you to take a walk outside.”

Huang Xiaolong walked after Old Man Cangqiong, stepping out from the Cangqiong Dao Palace. The bright sunlight fell on him, warming his body.

With a wave of his hand, Old Man Cangqiong raised the Cangqiong Dao Palace into the air as he smiled at Huang Xiaolong and said, “This Cangqiong Dao Palace will be my gift to you. After all, it’s not of much use being left here.”

The Cangqiong Dao Palace was forged with numerous rare materials and repeatedly tempered with Old Man Cangqiong’s inextinguishable dao heart. Therefore, it had long risen into the ranks of dao artifacts. Although it was not as powerful as the Cangqiong Blade, it was an excellent transportation medium!
