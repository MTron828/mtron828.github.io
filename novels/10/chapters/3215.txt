Chapter 3216: Huang Xiaolong Has Appeared!

The five of them didn’t dare to move a muscle as they stood there. They were guessing the identity of the old ancestor’s disciple silently, and before they knew it, a ray of light flashed before them and three figures appeared.

Di Yu and the others got to their knees respectfully, “We greet the Old Ancestor!”

Nodding slowly, the old dragon chuckled, “Alright, you can dispense with the formalities now.”

Getting to their feet, the five of them looked at the old dragon.

“Alright. This brat here is going to be my disciple in the future. He will also be the Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World.” He pointed at Huang Xiaolong who was standing behind him.

Di Yu and the others acknowledged respectfully before turning to stare at Huang Xiaolong. When Di Yu saw his appearance, he nearly jumped in fright. “It’s you!”

Even though the auction happened several hundred thousand years ago, he was naturally able to recognize the Purple Lightning Young Master.

He didn’t expect the old ancestor to really accept the kid as his disciple!

Also, there were many things that happened several thousand years ago that confirmed the Purple Lightning Young Master’s identity!

When Celestial Emperor Di Cangtian noticed Di Yu’s reaction, he quickly asked, “Second brother, this…”

“He’s the Purple Lightning Young Master we were talking about!” Di Yu gasped in shock.

“What?!”

“It’s actually him!”

The other four felt their heads spinning.

As the upper echelon of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, they knew everything that transpired.

When Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao announced the bounty on Huang Xiaolong three thousand years ago in the Dao Emperor World, Huang Xiaolong’s fame had already shocked the universe. It was no wonder the four of them learned about him.

Di Cangtian looked at the old dragon and stuttered, “Old ancestor… This… He…”

“Alright. Come here and greet Xiaolong.” The old dragon raised his hand to stop any questions. It was clear he didn’t plan on explaining himself to them.

The five of them felt their hearts trembling in shock as they quickly cupped their fists towards Huang Xiaolong, “We greet Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong!’

When Huang Xiaolong received the Blazing Dragon inheritance in the future, he would not only become the Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire. He would control the entire Blazing Dragon World! As such, even Di Cangtian had to address Huang Xiaolong appropriately.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and chatted with them for a bit.

Soon, the old dragon made his youngest son, Di Yubai, arrange a suitable residence for Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Tianyi.

After the three of them left the hall, Di Cangtian turned to the old dragon and asked, “Old Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong is the Son of Creation of the Huang Long world, and he’s Huang Long’s son! Accepting him as your disciple might not be the right thing to do!”

The old dragon looked the others in the eye and asked, “Do all of you think the same way?”

Looking at each other, they eventually nodded in agreement.

“Why don’t you guys tell me where’s the problem with my arrangement?”

?!

The four of them stared at each other in shock.

They could hear the slight irritation in the old dragon’s voice when he addressed them, but Di Cangtian had to continue, “He’s already the Son of Creation of another world! Moreover, he’s someone on the True Dragon Celestial Empire’s to kill list! If old ancestor takes him in as a disciple, wouldn’t Huang Sheng…”

The old dragon snorted in irritation.

The hall turned silent in an instant as the four of them got to their knees.

“You’re all too shortsighted.” The old dragon lectured them. “Who says that he can only be the Son of Creation of a single world? Moreover, he doesn’t know how to control the origin of the Huang Long World! He can’t be considered the Son of Creation if that’s the case!”

“All of you are worried Huang Sheng would cause trouble for the celestial empire after I take him in as my disciple, right?” The old dragon sneered. “Are you really afraid of offending the True Dragon Celestial Empire?! Are you afraid Huang Sheng would personally appear to destroy us?!”

“Do you really think that he won’t make a move after he devours Huang Long’s bloodline and origin energy?!”

“Or do you think that I will have to care about what Huang Sheng thinks before I make a decision?!”

Di Cangtian and the others felt cold sweat dripping down their foreheads when faced with the old ancestor’s anger.

“Do you really think that I have no idea what all of you are planning?” The old dragon harrumphed. “You’re uncomfortable because I chose someone outside the royal family to be the Son of Creation. All of you think that I should choose one of your descendants to inherit my mantle. Is that it?!”

The old dragon’s questioning caused all of them to tremble in their shoes. None of them dared to raise their heads in response.

“Old Ancestor, we were wrong!” Di Cangtian was the first to respond.

The old dragon’s face was cold as he snorted in anger, “All of you are disappointments. After Huang Sheng devours Huang Long, he will definitely turn against the entire universe. When that happens, our Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire will be the first on his list!”

“Huang Xiaolong is our only hope!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The old dragon left the hall as soon as he spoke, and no one dared to raise their heads for a long time.

Di Cangtian and the other three thought about it for a long time before getting to their feet.

“The Old Ancestor is right. We were too short-sighted.” Di Cangtian sighed.

In the two days that followed, Huang Xiaolong remained in the palace of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire and continued to cultivate peacefully with Yuan Tianyi.

On the second day, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think about the manor he bought in the past.

“Let’s go take a look at the Purple Lightning Manor…”

When they decorated the Purple Lightning Manor in the past, they used a ton of precious treasures.

Compared to the imperial palace, the Purple Lightning Manor was Huang Xiaolong’s true home!

As such, the two of them traveled back to the Purple Lightning Manor in the Hidden Dragon Sacred Land, and it only took an hour for them to arrive.

In the manor, Di Xiaolong wore a long face as he thought about the appointment ceremony that was about to take place the next day. When he thought about how he had to accept someone else as the Son of Creation, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of hatred in his heart.

“Your Highness, I received news that the person chosen by the Old Ancestor is currently living in the imperial palace.” Caretaker Pang reported.

Di Xiaolong nodded slowly. “He might be there, but none of us are allowed to take a step into the imperial palace in the first place. I’ve tried asking second uncle, but he refused to say a word.”

Other than Di Cangtian and the other four who had seen Huang Xiaolong for the first time, no one knew that he was the chosen one.

Just as Di Xiaolong was racking his brains to think of someone, one of his subordinates rushed into the hall hastily and yelled, “Your Highness, the Purple Lightning Young Master! Huang Xiaolong… Huang Xiaolong appeared!”

Staring at his subordinate for a solid second, Di Xiaolong wouldn't believe his ears. He jumped in joy the next second and yelled, “Where is he?!” One had to know that Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao placed a bounty of one hundred trillion dao coins on Huang Xiaolong’s head.

“He’s in the capital right now! Moreover, he’s heading straight for the Hidden Dragon Sacred Land!”
