Chapter 3204: The Encounter with the Palace Master of the Nether Spirit Palace

After the Nine Phoenix Flying Ship entered the Dao Emperor World, they didn’t stop as they headed straight for the Black Gold Holy World.

Indeed, the Mysterious Magician’s Treasury was located in the Black Gold Holy World.

As one of the most famous holy worlds in the Dao Emperor World, it was located on the south frontier. With their speed, they would be able to arrive in five to six months.

Just as they were about to make their way over, Zeng Ying received a piece of news that caused her expression to sink.

Huang Xiaolong and the others found her sudden change in mood a little weird, but she quickly explained himself. “I just received news that the Saint Xuankong who reported the appearance of the Dao Emperor’s sword discovered it in the Black Gold Holy World!”

As such, it was more than likely everyone was headed to the same place as they were!

Huang Xiaolong and the others couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

A frown formed on Zeng Ying’s face. Ordinarily, that would be something to celebrate. However, there was no point in doing so any longer! Many people who have learned of the news, and they should be rushing over as they spoke!

When they looked for the Mysterious Magician’s Treasury in the Black Gold World, it was more than likely they would run into the experts of the other factions! The chances of running into Huang Shengdao, Di Xiaolong, and even Fu Luosen increased by a huge amount!

No… In fact, they were practically bound to run into someone they knew!

Huang Xiaolong sighed, “The Black Gold Holy World is large, and even if all of them came together, they wouldn’t obstruct us from obtaining the treasury.”

“Let’s hope so.” Zeng Ying sighed. Her mood was dampened so much that she could no longer laugh about it.

Give months later…

The Black Gold World was in sight, and along the way, they ran into a ton of experts. However, nothing much happened as no one wanted to antagonize a competitor for nothing.

“That’s Black Gold Holy World.” Zeng Ying pointed at the giant world before them and he introduced.

Everyone turned to look at the Black Gold Holy World, and their vision was filled with a warm dark light that contained flashes of gold. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“The Black Gold Holy World is basically made out of Black Gold.” Xu Fu said. “There are Black Gold mines everywhere throughout the mountain ranges, and there are even genesis level Black Gold Ores present. However, obtaining one is harder than you might think as the Black Gold Mountain Veins are able to change their positions.”

It seemed as though Xu Fu was extremely familiar with the Black Gold World.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but gasp in shock, “Moving mountain veins?!”

That was the first time Huang Xiaolong had ever heard of something like that happening.

Zeng Ying nodded in agreement. “The Black Gold Mountain Vein is an extremely special mountain range in the universe. When it reaches a certain level, it would transform into a liquid type form. It will be able to travel through the ground without exposing its traces. Its speed is frighteningly fast, and even experts who had reached the major completion stage in the power of space wouldn’t be able to capture it easily!”

The Undying Monster, Bai Xugang, chuckled, “The universe contains too many mysterious existences... “

It was also his first time hearing of the Black Gold Mountain Vein.

As they were chatting, a massive flying ship that was jet black in color came charging towards them. When Zeng Ying saw the insignia on the ship, her expression fluctuated a little. It was the flying ship of the Nether Spirit Palace, and she didn’t expect to run into them so early on.

She turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, as she knew that he had sown some seed of hatred with the Nether Spirit Palace in the past.

However, Huang Xiaolong looked completely unperturbed.

When the Nether Spirit Flying Ship arrived beside the Nine Phoenix Flying Ship, it stopped suddenly.

A giant group of experts disembarked in an instant, and everyone could see that there were several dozen thousands of them! One could only imagine how serious the Palace Master was about obtaining the Dao Emperor’s Sword.

Huang Xiaolong quickly noticed You Wuyi who was standing in the crowd.

The only difference between this time and the last was that You Wuyi wasn’t standing in front of everyone else!

There was a black robed, red-eyed, and well-built old expert standing at the very front, and he was without a doubt, You Ming, the Nether Spirit Palace Master!

His eyes were cold, and he swept his gaze across those in the Nine Phoenix Flying Ship. When his eyes landed on Huang Xiaolong, he paused for a second. Huang Xiaolong could feel the killing intent hidden in his eyes.

“Princess…” The corners of You Ming’s lips arched upwards. “Nice to see you here.”

His attitude spoke otherwise.

Zeng Ying nodded slightly and muttered indifferently, “Palace Master You Ming is too kind.”

You Ming didn’t care about her greeting, and his gaze turned to Huang Xiaolong. “Are you the Purple Lightning Young Master? Were you the one who killed several hundred disciples of my Nether Spirit Palace?!”

In the auction previously, the disciples of the Lightning Yang Race and the Nether Spirit Palace launched an attack on Huang Xiaolong and were devoured by his fierce souls. The only people who managed to escape were You Wuyi and Lei Qinghai.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding anything anyway.

With his pupils constricting, a ray of black light and a ray of red light shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Why aren’t you kneeling before me to atone for your sins?!” A roar left You Ming’s lips, and his voice caused the surroundings to tremble heavily. Spatial cracks started to form all around, and the two rays of light appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Without Yuan Tianyi stepping in, Huang Xiaolong causally shattered both rays with a swing of his arm.

When Zeng Ying finally reacted, she glared at You Ming and growled, “What’s the meaning of this?”

A roaring laughter left You Ming’s lips. “Hahaha! This is a personal grudge I have with the brat. I don’t intend on offending you, and I hope Princess Zeng Ying will refrain from interfering with our grudge!” A terrifying aura of twelve elements at perfection level started to emerge from You Ming’s body.

Even Princess Zeng Ying was unable to contain her shock when she realized You Ming’s newfound strength. It was the same for everyone else on the ship.

“Twelve elements at perfection level!”

That was right! He comprehended his twelfth element in seclusion!

Five hundred thousand years ago, You Ming entered seclusion after receiving the news of the events that happened during the auction. He said that he would need a million years in order to comprehend the twelfth element to perfection level, but he lucked out and gained inspiration at the last second, allowing him to break through before obtaining the news of the Dao Emperor’s Sword!

It was also the reason behind his casual attitude towards Princess Zeng Ying.

A light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he realized that You Ming had already comprehended twelve elements to perfection level. It was the gaze a hunter would use when looking at his prey. Since You Ming reached his current level of strength, he should be no weaker than the Extreme East Old Man!

Seeing Zeng Ying’s reaction, You Ming was slightly delighted in his heart. He continued, “Princess, I do not plan to make things difficult for you. I only wish to kill this brat, and as long as you chase him out of your ship, there shall be no hatred between us. When I kill the brat, I will thank Princess Zeng Ying.”

Hao Yi and the others quickly turned to Zeng Ying. They were obviously unwilling to clash with someone of You Ming’s level.

Zeng Ying stared at You Ming, and she muttered slowly, “The Purple Lightning Young Master is my friend.”

Her meaning couldn’t be more clear.

Everyone stared at her in shock, and You Ming’s expression sank.
