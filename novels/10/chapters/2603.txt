Chapter 2604: Silver Purity Race

“Oh? Is that the human they call Huang Xiaolong?” Longpeng sat upright in his chair. “He’s here too?”

Previously, he had heard that Zi Dongping had accepted a human called Huang Xiaolong as his foster son as soon as he had returned to the public’s eye. He was shocked to say the least, as the person he respected most among all the cultivators in the Alien Lands was Zi Dongping! He had listened to the legends of Zi Dongping as he had stepped on the road of cultivation!

“Yes! He passed the test just a moment ago!” The elder’s expression turned a little unnatural when he spoke up to that point.

Longpeng nodded absentmindedly, “His talent should be no weaker than the core disciples of the various royal races. It’s impossible for him to fail the selections.”

“However…”

He looked at the expression on the elder’s face, and he felt that that wasn’t all.

A bitter smile slowly formed on the elder’s face as he continued, “Young Master, his talent is not only comparable to the core disciples of the various royal families! In fact, there’s almost no one who is more talented than him!”

There was something else he didn’t say. After all, one couldn’t belittle their young master in the face.

“Is he like me?! Does his saint godhead rank in the top ten?!” Longpeng was shocked and the expression on his face turned serious.

If that was the case, it would be a piece of news that shook the world!

“No… not the top ten ranks…”

Long Peng heaved a sigh of relief as a smile slowly formed on his face. “How can you praise his talent if his saint godhead isn’t ranked in the top ten? Yu Chen, are you getting muddle-headed?”

“He has a Primal Dragon Complete Dao Saint Godhead.”

“Rank-thirty?” Long Peng was stunned for a second. “If this is really the case, he’s pretty talented. There aren’t many people in the mansion who can surpass him. However, he’s nothing but an ant in my eyes!”

As long as the other party didn’t have a saint godhead ranking in the top ten ranks, it was nearly impossible for them to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm in the future.

“That’s not all! He has the Solitary Darkness Complete Dao Saint Godhead! As if that’s not enough, he also has the Chaos Void Complete Dao Saint Godhead!” Yu Chen paused for a second and heaved a sigh of relief. It was as though he had released a huge weight off his chest.

“What?!” Longpeng leaped into the air after hearing the news. His expression changed instantly. “You… You… He… He… He has three complete dao saint godheads?!”

Long Peng was stunned speechless.

As for Yu Chen, complicated emotions flashed across his face, and he nodded slowly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Longpeng found he had to take a seat when he heard the confirmation. All of a sudden, he seemed to have gone crazy as he rushed out of the hall.

Longpeng wasn’t the only one who nearly went mad when he received the news. In the Otherworldly Mansion, many vice hall masters, hall masters, and even the deputy mansion master received a huge shock.

If Huang Xiaolong had two saint godheads, there was no way they would be alerted. In fact, it might have even been acceptable to some! However, he was the first person in history to have three saint godheads!

…

The news traveled far and wide, and the Mission Hall Master, Yin Zhangguo, personally appeared to greet Huang Xiaolong.

As soon as he met Huang Xiaolong, a trace of admiration filled his heart. However, there were other emotions confusing him as the person with unparalleled talent was a human! Whatever the case, he swallowed all the shock and doubt he felt when he spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Is your foster father, Zi Dongping, doing well?”

Yin Zhangguo was a disciple of the Silver Purity Race, and they were also one of the royal families. In the past, their relationship with the Purple Spider Race was pretty solid despite the fact that the Purple Spider Race had offended many royal families during their ascension.

In the past, Zi Dongping had many graces to Yin Zhangguo and thus, it explained the current scene.

As soon as Yin Zhangguo heard that Zi Dongping’s foster son had three complete dao saint godheads, he was extremely excited. The only part that caused him to waver was the fact that Huang Xiaolong was a human!

“He’s doing pretty good!” Huang Xiaolong smiled at Yin Zhangguo and he cupped his fists to greet the man. “Foster father really misses Hall Master Yin!”

Zi Dongping had indeed spoken to Huang Xiaolong about the matters about the Silver Purity Race.

When he heard that Zi Dongping still remembered him, Yin Zhangguo felt a sense of gratification wash over him. He chatted with Huang Xiaolong for a moment before bringing him over to receive the robes and identity plaque of a disciple of the Otherworldly Mansion.

The complicated procedures were completed in an instant.

As for Jiang Shaohuang, he could only leave for a while.

Since there were many places within the Otherworldly Mansion where one needed to show their identity plaque to enter, Yin Zhangguo warned Huang Xiaolong to keep it well.

Of course, there was no way someone could fake a plaque in order to enter the restricted regions, and only when Huang Xiaolong used his holy energy, would he be able to use his plaque. Even if anyone else managed to obtain it, they wouldn’t be able to use it.

Soon, they went to pick out a good cultivation cave.

Since the mission hall wasn’t in charge of allocating a cultivation cave, Yin Zhangguo wanted to personally bring Huang Xiaolong over to the logistics hall. However, his goodwill was quickly rejected by Huang Xiaolong. Shaking his head, Yin Zhangguo could only leave Huang Xiaolong alone. “Alright, you can look for me when you have settled in.” After speaking, he passed Huang Xiaolong a pass that would allow him to enter his cultivation cave.

As the hall master of the mission hall, he would be able to reject all sorts of visitors. In fact, most visitors wouldn’t be able to look for him! Only with the pass would Huang Xiaolong be able to travel freely over to his cultivation cave.

It was clear that Yin Zhangguo was showing his care for Huang Xiaolong.

Without rejecting Yin Zhangguo’s goodwill, Huang Xiaolong accepted the pass.

After parting with Yin Zhangguo, Huang Xiaolong brought Hei Luo over to the logistics hall.

As soon as he arrived, the hall bustled with activity.

This time, the hall master didn’t appear personally. Instead, the vice hall master, Jin Kang, appeared to guide him around.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong, Jin Kang revealed a mocking sneer, “Huang Xiaolong from the Purple Spider Race? Humph. There are too many disciples who managed to enter the mansion this time. All the good cultivation caves are occupied and you can have the one in the Falling Sun Peak.”

Falling Sun Peak? Huang Xiaolong frowned. The Falling Sun Peak was where the disciples under the True Saint Realm resided. The conditions were much worse compared to the location allocated to the True Saint Realm disciples.

Whatever it was, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to argue. He nodded and left instantly. It didn’t matter where he went. He had three saint godheads and twelve high-order Saint Fates. With the Inextinguishable Dao Heart and the Holy Mandate Imprint, there was no need to care about the concentration of holy spiritual energy in the surroundings.

Jin Kang was a little shocked when he noticed Huang Xiaolong leaving without arguing. In fact, he had planned to pin the crime of offending a vice hall master on Huang Xiaolong’s head after enraging him.

“Jin Yue is my younger brother!” He snorted when Huang Xiaolong was about to leave the hall.

Pausing for a moment, Huang Xiaolong scoffed, “So the person whose head exploded in a single punch was your brother!”

Jin Kang’s expression fell, and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong, you had better remain in your place. If you ever fall into the hands of my Golden Buddha Race, the Purple Spider Race and the Silver Purity Race wouldn’t be able to save you even if they worked together!”

“You should take care of yourself. If you end up in my hands, no one in the Alien Lands would be able to save you,” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly before leaving.
