Chapter 3569 – Meeting the Star Dragon Universe Again

Yu Long crashed into the ground before Ao Wen and the Dragon Staff clattered onto the ground close to them.

With a simple gesture, Huang Xiaolong pulled the Dragon Staff over.

“This isn’t too bad. I’ll accept it for now.” Huang Xiaolong muttered before wiping out the soul imprint on the Dragon Staff. When Yu Long saw what happened, he vomited a mouthful of fresh blood. No one knew if it was because of the damage to his soul or if it was because of the humiliation.

“Huang Xiaolong, you went too far!” Yu Long roared as he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong in desperation.

Returning to his true form, a massive dragon blocked out the skies. His claws reached towards Huang Xiaolong, but they were swatted away by Huang Xiaolong’s palm. When a punch from Huang Xiaolong landed on Yu Long’s body, he was sent crashing through countless structures. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Going too far?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “I don’t think so.”

Yu Long vomited mouthfuls of blood and he cursed, “Huang Xiaolong, you…”

He wasn’t someone Huang Xiaolong could bully as he pleased… He was a god! He was a god standing at the peak of the thirteen universes!

Huang Xiaolong took a single step and appeared in front of Yu Long. “I was planning to teach you a lesson. However, I was asked to kill you.”

Asked?!

Yu Long and those around stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

“Someone asked you to kill me?! How many treasures were you given?! I’ll double it!” Yu Long panicked. “I have a top-grade universe-level spiritual vein! There are other valuable treasures in the Submerged Dragon Institute!”

Huang Xiaolong snickered, “I was indeed given a treasure. However, it’s worth more than a million top-grade universe spiritual veins!”

What?!

Worth more than a million top-grade universe-level spiritual veins?!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with Yu Long any longer as he sealed the man’s grand cosmos energy. He tossed him into the Sun Moon Furnace without another word.

Turning to look at Xu Long, Xu Long’s expression changed drastically. He turned away, pretending to not know Huang Xiaolong.

“Xu Long, you must hate me for what I did, no?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

When Huang Xiaolong just arrived, Xu Long was indeed enraged. Now, he quickly shook his head and stuttered, “Lord… Lord Huang Xiaolong must be kidding! Chu Huaihao went against Lord Huang on his own accord! He deserved to die! I forgot about everything that happened back then, how can I possibly blame you?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly before looking at the other experts present.

Heaving a sigh of relief, Xu Long thought that Huang Xiaolong was going to let the matter rest. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s gaze soon returned to him.

“Don’t you have several universe-level spiritual veins left?”

Xu Long’s body froze as a bitter smile appeared on his face.

“As the strongest celestial empire in the Star Dragon Universe, how can you not possess some?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“No… No… Lord Huang Xiaolong, please don’t be mistaken. I used up a few of them along the way…” Xu Long explained. Retrieving whatever he had left, Xu Long handed them over to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord Huang, these are all that I have left.”

Huang Xiaolong stared at two high-grade universe spiritual veins, four mid-grade ones, and nodded. He turned to look at the other experts present. “What about you guys?”

The Gods of Creation present felt their eyelids twitching slightly.

“Relax. I’ll give you Star Dragon Scales in exchange.” Huang Xiaolong explained. He took out several dozen Star Dragon Scales after he spoke, illuminating the space with silvery starlight.

The Gods of Creation who felt like they were about to get ripped off nearly danced in excitement.

“Lord… Lord Huang, are you serious?!” One of the experts at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm asked in disbelief. Just a second ago, they thought that Huang Xiaolong was about to rob them clean!

“Of course!”

The moment they received Huang Xiaolong’s promise, none of them hesitated to take out all the universe-level spiritual veins they had.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to rip them off either. He gave them the Star Dragon Scales according to the exchange rate in the First Universe. He was slightly taken aback by the amount of universe-level spiritual veins the Star Dragon Universe possessed. In the end, he managed to gather sixty of them from the Gods of Creation present.

Since most of the experts in the God of Creation Realm came to the Submerged Dragon Institute's tournament, they saved Huang Xiaolong a great deal of trouble.

Xu Long felt anger surging through his heart when he saw how everyone got their fair share of Star Dragon Scales in exchange for their spiritual veins. He was the only one who didn’t receive anything in return! Even so, he wouldn’t dare to bring up his dissatisfaction to Huang Xiaolong.

After obtaining the spiritual veins, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with them. He turned around to leave.

It remained eerily silent as Huang Xiaolong left the plaza.

Entering the treasury of the Submerged Dragon Institute, Huang Xiaolong swept everything into the Sun Moon Furnace. The guarding elder of the treasury could only weep sadly at the side while watching Huang Xiaolong’s merciless pillaging.

After he was done, Huang Xiaolong approached the Dragon Eye Cliff. Like how he entered before, he went to the mysterious space to look for the consciousness of the Star Dragon Universe.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong again, the Star Dragon Universe was beyond shocked.

“You… You… You have already accumulated 14.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy!” It quickly discovered Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Senior Star Dragon, I promised to kill Yu Long for you previously. I have already captured him.” After he said his piece, he released Yu Long from the Sun Moon Furnace.

Yu Long started to panic when he saw the space he was in.

“Huang Xiaolong, where the hell is this?! What do you want?!” Yu Long roared.

“Don’t you know where this is?!” The Star Dragon Universe’s voice boomed in Yu Long’s ears.

“You… Star Dragon Universe?!” Yu Long yelped.

“It’s good that you still remember my voice.”

“Huang Xiaolong, release me, please release me!” Yu Long turned around to grab Huang Xiaolong’s legs and he pleaded.

Ignoring Yu Long, Huang Xiaolong turned to the Star Dragon Universe. “Senior Star Dragon, I wish to inquire about some other matters now that I am here.”

He asked several questions about the Unknown Lands and the thirteen universes.

The Star Dragon Universe was shocked to hear Huang Xiaolong’s question on the Unknown Lands. A sigh entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears. “I don’t know much about the Unknown Lands as I am unable to leave the Star Dragon Universe, but I can be sure of one thing…”
