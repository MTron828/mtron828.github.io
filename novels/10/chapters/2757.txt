Chapter 2758: Causing Suspicions

Two Sons of Creation? Huang Xiaolong’s head was spinning.

Yang Shangchen’s words meant that the Divine Tuo Holy World had another Son of Creation, and his name is Huang Shuai.

But Long Jianfei had clearly said that there was only one Son of Creation, and there could only be one Son of Creation. It was absolutely impossible for a second or a third Son of Creation to exist.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. This can only mean that this so-called Son of Creation Huang Shuai is fake.

“What’s the deal with that Son of Creation Huang Shuai?” Huang Xiaolong asked Yang Shangchen, “Where is he now?”

Yang Shangchen also recovered from his shock after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s question. He didn’t dare to hesitate and immediately spilled out everything he knew.

He told him that several hundred years ago, this so-called Son of Creation Huang Shuai had suddenly appeared in the Divine Tuo Holy World, and he was recognized by the Dragon Fish Creed, Divination Creed, Red Fox Creed, Moon Wolf Creed, and a few other creeds. Currently, the Son of Creation Huang Shuai was residing in the Dragon Fish Creed.

Yang Shangchen didn’t know much apart from this information. Even this information was something he had heard from the Saint Devil Prince when he had participated in a certain gathering.

“Son of Creation, Huang Shuai?” An obscured light glimmered in the depths of Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

If this Son of Creation Huang Shuai was fake, how did he get past the Dragon Fish Creed’s experts and obtain their recognition?

Could Huang Shuai also have the Huang Long Bloodline? Or…? Is my bloodline fake? These thoughts flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Maybe, he isn’t the genuine Son of Creation?

But Long Jainfei had seemed to be very certain that he was the Son of Creation, and he was confident that his bloodline was the Huang Long Bloodline. Moreover, there was a reaction from the Creation Record when he had opened it, and that was not fake. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The more Huang Xiaolong thought about it, the furrows on his forehead deepened.

For a second, his thoughts were a little messy.

Yang Shangchen’s mind too had turned into paste, and he stared dazedly at the giant golden dragon phantom behind Huang Xiaolong. Who would’ve thought that he could encounter something like this.

Logically, encountering the Son of Creation should have been his lifetime’s honor, however, the Son of Creation in front of him…

Isn’t Huang Shuai the Son of Creation, the one residing in the Dragon Fish Creed, the Saint Devil Prince spoke of?

Is this one fake? But it doesn’t seem so!

The heaven’s coercion he felt was definitely not fake.

What’s going on here? Could there really be two Sons of Creation?

Yang Shangchen’s head spun. Huang Xiaolong had injured his fist, but now he found that his head ached more than his hand.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong cut off those annoying thoughts, and focused on Yang Shangchen again.

At this time, Yang Shangchen too was looking at Huang Xiaolong.

……

Ten minutes later, Yang Shangchen followed Huang Xiaolong out of the hall, wearing a revered expression.

In the end, Yang Shangchen decided to yield after considering the pros and cons, and he became Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate.

Although he didn’t know what was going on exactly, he felt that Huang Xiaolong’s identity as the Son of Creation wasn’t false and the Huang Long Bloodline was genuine.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong could injure him while still a Ninth Heaven True Saint. He knew that with such a talent, even if Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the Son of Creation, he would definitely grow to become a supreme existence in the Divine Tuo World.

Once Huang Xiaolong stepped into Primal Ancestor Realm, his strength would certainly be terrifying. At that time, the whole Divine Tuo Holy World would tremble at the stomp of his foot.

None of the people waiting outside were surprised to see Yang Shangchen come out behind Huang Xiaolong respectfully. After what had happened at the Cangqiong Sacred Land, everyone’s shock threshold had improved significantly.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong had Chen Qi lead him directly to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasury instead of gathering all the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s experts in one place.

When the three sacred lands had sent armies to attack the Cangqiong Sacred Land, each of the sacred land had left two Primal Ancestors to guard the sacred land, and the two Primal Ancestors of Tang Dragon Sacred Land were guarding the treasury.

Then again, these two Primal Ancestors were merely Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestors. Huang Xiaolong didn’t even need to make a move himself as Chen Qi and the others rushed up and captured them, bringing them to Huang Xiaolong.

The two of them also chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong after learning the ins and outs.

Huang Xiaolong ordered them to hand out the keys, and then following the special method he had obtained from Tang Long’s dao soul, he sent the keys into the treasury door’s space and successfully opened it.

When the treasury’s door opened, a burst of resplendent light shone out from within. Mouths were agape when everyone saw the treasures piled on top of the numerous continents within.

Inside the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasury were countless floating continents that carried hills of spiritual herbs, spirit stones, divine artifacts, saint artifacts, and various precious ores. There was so much good stuff that they felt there weren’t enough eyes to look with.

“Isn’t this too extravagant?” Fei Yanzi sighed in admiration as she spotted cities on some of the floating continents. These cities were built with materials like holy spiritual jade stones, rare ores, and holy wood.

Cangqiong Old Man too had slightly starry eyes as he drank in the sight of these treasures.

Huang Xiaolong was very calm, smiling as he invited his master, “Master, shall we get to work?”

Naturally, these treasures needed to be collected away.

Cangqiong Old Man reacted and nodded excitedly.

Huang Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man, and Fei Yanzi quickly got busy taking away the treasury’s herbs, spirit stones, pills, and ores. Chen Qi and the others also helped.

Huang Xiaolong told Fei Yanzi to take any treasure she liked, and a smile bloomed over the latter’s face as she nodded her head happily.

Everytime Huang Xiaolong reached out, a large hand would enveloped an entire continent, moving away all the spirit stones on it.

Even with Chen Qi and the others’ help, it took Huang Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man, and Fei Yanzi two full days before emptying it out.

Huang Xiaolong merely took a small part of the things inside the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasury, while the rest was left to Cangqiong Old Man to replenish the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s treasury and also the Cangqiong Alliance’s development.

Huang Xiaolong naturally wasn’t stingy towards Chen Qi and the others who had submitted to him, and he gave each of them a significant amount of spirit stones, holy pills, and holy herbs.

Yang Shangchen, Chen Qi, and the rest happily thanked Huang Xiaolong.

After finishing moving the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasury, Huang Xiaolong had Chen Qi assemble the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s hall masters and vice hall masters, and then, he subjugated them. After that, he rushed straight to Freezing Desert Sacred Land.

With the same method, Huang Xiaolong swiftly cleared out the Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s treasury and subjugated the Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s experts, and continued onwards to Chufan Sacred Land.

Although Huang Xiaolong had ordered for the news to be sealed, when Huang Xiaolong reached Chufan Sacred Land, news still leaked out while he was emptying the treasury, raising the nearby sacred lands’ suspicions.

“It is said that things didn’t go as planned when Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land were attacking Cangqiong Sacred Land. Cangqiong Sacred Land had a great expert, and he reversed the situation where Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan were captured instead. The remaining three sacred lands’ experts all submitted to Cangqiong Sacred Land!!”

“What?! Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan were captured? You must be mistaken. If it is true that Cangqiong Sacred Land has a great expert, then how were they suppressed by Tang Dragon Sacred Land in the last several hundred years without objecting?”

“I am not clear about that, but it is said the three sacred lands’ treasuries have already been emptied out by someone.”
