Sweat, Strength, Success

“This, this, what kind of light energy is this? It actually scattered away Shi Wushuang’s corpse qi!” An Ancestor exclaimed in shock.

At Shi Wushuang’s level of strength, there was almost nothing powerful enough between heaven and earth to scatter away Shi Wushuang’s corpse qi.

“This light energy feels like the holy light from the Heavenly Hall and Holy Mountain...?” Another Ancestor exclaimed in surprise at his discovery.

Right at this time, the holy light from Huang Xiaolong’s body erupted like a volcano, reaching the firmament, its radiance shining on every inch over the Nethersea, similar to the daylight in the Divine World.

“This!”

Gasps of shock rang above the Nethersea.

Huang Xiaolong’s downward spiraling vitality took a turn, growing stronger in the blink of an eye. A few moments later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes. A glaring light shone from his eyes, hurting others’ eyes.

Huang Xiaolong slowly got up and moved his limbs to loosen his stiff muscles while checking his internal condition. After confirming that there was nothing out of sorts with his body, Huang Xiaolong was at ease, even so, he felt cold sweat dampen his back. Luckily for him, Shi Wushuang’s palm strike had targeted his heart. Had it been another part, Huang Xiaolong was sure that his True Dragon Physique wouldn’t have been able to withstand the power of Shi Wushuang’s attack.

Another fortunate thing was that it was Shi Wushuang instead of the Nine Yin Giant Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming. If it would have been Shi Ming, he would be lining up for reincarnation even if he had the heart of hell.

Thankfully, he had also gotten the Heavenly Hall’s inheritance. Only the Heavenly Hall’s holy light energy could scatter off Shi Wushuang’s dense corpse qi in such a short time, or he would have gotten bedridden for several months. That was a more optimistic estimation.

Huang Xiaolong ignored Shi Wushuang and the surrounding Misty Palace, Fengdu City, and other forces experts’ gazes. He looked at the five new faces that stood by Tai Yue, Fan Hui, Jin Yuan, and Wan Yutian’s sides.

“You are the other five Great Commanders?” This was the first question Huang Xiaolong asked.

“This subordinate is Jiang Fenghuang!”

“This subordinate is He Lianfeng!”

“Subordinate, Cang Mingtian!”

“Subordinate, Yi Fei!”

“Subordinate, Pang De!”

“Greetings Master!!”

The five took a step forward and knelt on a single knee as they saluted Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

They were the remaining five of the Ten Great Commanders. Apart from Lu Kun, all the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Great Ten Commanders had gathered.

The two hundred plus Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Senior Commanders and Junior Commanders around the nine Great Commanders also knelt in the air and saluted Huang Xiaolong. Their rumbling voices reached the ninth heaven.

Huang Xiaolong had Jiang Fenghuang, He Lianfeng, and the rest stand up. Only then did his gaze fell onto the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang. Shi Wushuang concealed his feelings very well, but Huang Xiaolong still detected the fleeting trepidation in Shi Wushuang’s eyes.

It looked like Shi Wushuang was ‘frightened’ by his heart of hell, and he still had not recovered.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze moved from Shi Yinyu to Song Litao, Peng Zhengfei, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, Howling Moon Wolf Race, Gu Family, Black Ant Clan, and lastly to Demonic Bone Clan’s experts.

Shi Yinyu, Song Litao, Peng Zhengfei, and the others guiltily avoided Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Shi Wushuang’s reaction was hardly strange. After ‘discovering’ that Huang Xiaolong was the new Lord of Hell, no matter how much he wanted Huang Xiaolong to die, he no longer had the same confidence.

The Lord of Hell was Hell’s most honorable lord. On the other hand, regardless of their identities, or strength, they were nothing but his subjects in front of Huang Xiaolong.

While everyone was enveloped in the heavy atmosphere, the Ghost World’s Heaven Sacrificial City’s Young Lord Ji Chen suddenly led the Heaven Sacrificial City’s experts. He flew out from the large crowd of people from a distance until he came in front of Huang Xiaolong. Ji Chen first saluted, “Ji Chen greets Your Majesty, the Nether King!”

“Greetings Your Majesty, the Nether King!” The Heaven Sacrificial City’s experts all saluted with sonorous voices.

The Lord of Hell had another title of ‘Your Majesty, the Nether King.’

Subsequently, the Spirits World’s Golden Corpse Temple’s Temple Master Ma Chen led the Golden Corpse Temple’s experts and knelt before Huang Xiaolong, “Greetings Your Majesty, the Nether King!”

The Spirits World’s Clear Heart Sect and Fumu Faction’s experts, as well as the Blood Sea Cult, Copper Ghost Cult, and others from the Ghost World all approached Huang Xiaolong and saluted on one knee, lauding ‘Your Majesty, the Nether King.’

The Ghost World’s Heaven Sacrificial City, Blood Sea Cult, Copper Ghost Cult, and Spirits World’s Clear Heart Sect and Fumu Faction were originally forces under the Netherworld King’s Organisation, but no one knew about it. However, seeing the Heaven Sacrificial City, Blood Sea Cult, Copper Ghost Cult, and others ‘submit’ to Huang Xiaolong, other forces’ chiefs, patriarchs, and experts followed, flying out to salute Huang Xiaolong as a sign of their loyalty.

“Jia Demonic Cult Leader Mao Shu salutes Your Majesty, the Nether King!”

The Jia Demonic Cult was one of Asura World’s top thirty super forces.

“Six Eyes Sect’s Sect Chief Liu Yue greets Your Majesty, the Nether King!”

The Six Eyes Sect was among the top forty super forces of the Spirit World

One after another Hell’s super forces submitted to Huang Xiaolong, and soon, there were forty to fifty super forces who proclaimed their loyalty to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was the Lord of Hell, hence he was naturally their most supreme leader. In these sect chiefs, leaders, and patriarchs’ eyes, they were subjects, and it was granted that they serve the Lord of Hell with loyalty.

Even though many super forces had proclaimed their loyalty to Huang Xiaolong, there were even more forces who were hesitant, as they watched this situation from afar.

Shi Wushuang had been paying attention to the number of super forces standing on Huang Xiaolong’s side, and his expression grew uglier by the second. The flow of events had greatly strayed from his plans and imagination.

Even though none of these super forces that went to Huang Xiaolong’s side were amongst the top ten in Hell’s three worlds, their combined strengths posed a threat to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

“Go!”

Shi Wushuang bellowed suddenly, issuing a retreat order to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts.

As soon as Shi Wushuang gave his order, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts promptly turned and fled.

While the others were dumbfounded by the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s action, Shi Wushuang suddenly disappeared in a flicker. When he appeared again, he was once again right in front of Huang Xiaolong. No one knew when a bone sword appeared in his hands, with a sharp blade made of pure white bones.

“Die!”

The tip of Shi Wushuang’s bone sword was aimed between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows.

He had ordered the Nine Yin Giant Tribe to retreat in order to distract Huang Xiaolong, Tai Yue, and the others. On the other hand, instead of fleeing, he pulled a second attempt to kill Huang Xiaolong.

This time, he was not aiming for Huang Xiaolong’s heart, but in between his eyebrows. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The bone sword was forged from an archdevil’s arm bone, and it was deathly sharp. Driven by Shi Wushuang, not even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert could escape the fate of being stabbed through the head. His bone sword would pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s head in less than a split second and come out from the back of the head.

At the same time when his bone sword would pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s head, Shi Wushuang intended to shatter Huang Xiaolong’s soul, killing him in an instant!

After that he intended to grab Huang Xiaolong’s heart of hell!

The heart of hell! As long as he got the heart of hell! Then, within his years of accumulation, Shi Wushuang was confident that he could surpass the Emperor Realm on the spot!

Shi Wushuang’s second assassination attempt came as a shock to everyone, even Desolate Giant Tai Yue, and the others did not think Shi Wushuang would pull such a stunt.

But this time, Huang Xiaolong had been vigilant. Almost at the same time Shi Wushuang made his move, Huang Xiaolong threw out the City of Eternity faster than his brain could react. One hundred high-level Emperor Realm Undead puppet Netherguards flew out.

Simultaneously, the Chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool and Black Tortoise Lightning Pool between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows roared to life.
