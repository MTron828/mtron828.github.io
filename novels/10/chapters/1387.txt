As the little cow, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor approached Huang Xiaolong, they heard him lamenting, “Unfortunately, only late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm!” He had a regretful expression on his face.

The Blood Eye Devil Stele was split into two when it was damaged, and most of its darkness element energy had scattered because of this severe damage. Huang Xiaolong had learned this information through the blood-eye spirit’s memories when he refined it.

Huang Xiaolong could have broken through to high-level Ancestor God Realm or maybe even the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, if the darkness element energy inside the Blood Eye Devil Stele was intact, thus, enabling Huang Xiaolong to absorb all of it!

The little cow, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor nearly took a stumble when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s lament.

In less than two years, this fella has broken through consecutively from late-First Order to late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm, but he’s still lamenting?!

The little cow had a strong impulse to pierce Huang Xiaolong’s ass with her horns.

“Kiddo, you better be content.” The little cow snorted at him.

Huang Xiaolong flashed her a brilliant smile as he said, “Xiaoniu, let’s spar for a bit?”

The little cow blanked for a second. She’s clutching her shoulders with her front legs and shook her head vehemently. “I don’t want to do that!”

“Just for an hour!” Huang Xiaolong was a little speechless at the little cow’s reaction. I’m not interested in a cow, okay? Why is she protecting her chest?

The little cow stubbornly shook her head, “Not happening!”

“Half an hour?”

“No—!”

“Ten minutes!”

"No!" 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"One minute!"

"Don’t say one minute if you’re a man!"

......

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor watched this exchange helplessly.

The little cow wouldn’t agree to spar with Huang Xiaolong no matter what, so Huang Xiaolong had no other option but give up his idea of testing his strength for the time being. He looked over his shoulder and asked the Fortune Gate Chief Zhu Yi, “Gate Chief Zhu, I remember the Fortune Gate’s rule, which mentions that whoever manages to refine the stele would get the treasures left behind by Ancestor Blue Lion, am I right?"

Zhu Yi forced a smile as he said, “Y-yes.” Inwardly, his feelings were tumultuous. He had arrived soon after Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, when Huang had begun refining the Blood Eye Devil Stele.. Therefore, he had clearly witnessed the whole refining process with his own eyes.

The energy within the Blood Eye Devil Stele had actually helped Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation to rise from late-First Order Ancestor to late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm!

He wasn’t blind to notice that the Blood Eye Devil Stele contained an extremely rare high-quality spiritual energy, which was absolutely precious, and Huang Xiaolong had reaped all the benefits from it.

The Blue Lion Ancestor’s treasures that generations of Gate Chiefs and Ancestors had fancied were going to be harvested by Huang Xiaolong!

Though Zhu Yi was extremely unwilling, he had no choice but to lead Huang Xiaolong to the Fortune Gate’s treasury. He reluctantly handed the Blue Lion Ancestor’s Blue Lion Divine Ring to Huang Xiaolong. The spatial ring contained all of the Blue Lion Ancestor’s treasures.

Back at his Cosmos Palace, Huang Xiaolong opened the Blue Lion Divine Ring, and shocking spiritual energy rushed out from the ring’s space. Huang Xiaolong used his divine sense to see the contents inside the ring; there were chaos spiritual herbs everywhere he looked, as well as spirit stones. The lowest grade spirit stones inside the ring were still grade seven spirit stones, then grade eight, and even grade nine spirit stones!

He also found a dozen divine armors and other divine artifacts in a corner.

These divine armors and divine artifacts were Blue Lion Ancestor’s collection from over two million years ago. They were already priceless treasures back then, even more so now.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head wryly as he completed checking through most of the things inside the Blue Lion Divine Ring.

Most of the contents inside the divine ring were chaos spiritual herbs.

Then again, chaos spiritual herbs were good stuff, and no one would think they were too much. He decisively transferred all the chaos spiritual herbs, spirit stones, as well as divine armors and divine artifacts into the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space.

Huang Xiaolong stayed at the Fortune Gate for another month.

During this month, he accompanied Li Lu and Yao Chi. Occasionally, Luo Yunjie would visit him with wine in his hands.

Although Luo Yunjie was also an emperor rank godhead genius, his cultivation was merely at late-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm, therefore he was a million miles behind Huang Xiaolong.

Luo Yunjie grinned widely as he jokingly stated the Origin Dragon Sect’s Sect Chief and Twin Cities Sect’s Sect Chief were probably so scared that they went hiding in god knows where.

The news about the sea tribe being under Huang Xiaolong’s wings, as well as the news about Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi’s death had spread throughout Vientiane World. The Origin Dragon Sect and Twin Cities Sect who had targeted Huang Xiaolong during the All-Islands Great War were probably scared pissed at this point.

In the meantime, Yao Chi had successfully broken through to First Order Ancient God Realm with Huang Xiaolong’s help.

Although it was only the First Order Ancient God Realm, Yao Chi wore a smile the entire day.

After learning that Huang Xiaolong was going to set off to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, Yao Chi was extremely ‘benevolent’ towards Huang Xiaolong, agreeing with his every request.

A month later Huang Xiaolong departed from the Vientiane World.

Although the evil spirit inside Li Lu’s body was not going to wreck havoc for the next thirty to forty years, it was better to obtain a God King’s Buddha Pellet well in advance. The sooner Li Lu consumed it, the less worried Huang Xiaolong would be.

Refining the Blood Eye Devil Stele had taken him close to two years, hence, Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to delay further.

After bidding farewell to Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and Luo Yunjie, Huang Xiaolong departed in the Giant Shark Flying Ship. The little cow, Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest were also on this ship. The ship tore through space and vanished in the blink of an eye.

However, on the way to the High Martial World, Huang Xiaolong made a pit stop at the Clear Spirit World to visit his Master Gui Yue.

Gui Yue was astounded when he saw Huang Xiaolong in the Giant Shark Flying Ship above the Ghost Sea. He was more astounded when he discovered that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm. Gui Yue rubbed his eyes a few times until he was certain that he wasn’t bedazzled.

“Master, you’re not having an illusion, it’s me, Xiaolong!” Huang Xiaolong sounded a little helpless as he pointed behind him and added, “Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San, you still recognize them right?”

Gui Yue threw his head back and let out a hearty laughter. He walked towards Huang Xiaolong and gave him a big hug, while his eyes glistened with happy tears!

He had been cultivating for more than a hundred thousand years, and had experienced countless adversities, so he had long forgotten what tears were, but now, he was crying in happiness.

Huang Xiaolong stayed several days at the Ghost Sea.

In these few days, the little cow also treated the Poison of Thousand Corpses in Gui Yue’s body. Even though she was not able to completely detoxify the poison, she had made sure to contain it.

Huang Xiaolong also visited the Xiao Family, and dealt with Xiao Family’s number one genius Xiang Zhangyu before leaving the Clear Spirit World. In the past, Huang Xiaolong had left Xiao Zhangyu alive because he was wary of the Xiao Family’s Ancestor. But it was no longer necessary.

Huang Xiaolong killed Xiao Zhangyu with his own hands by breaking his neck. He then threw his body in front of the Xiao Family’s headquarters. Subsequently, he also dealt with Xiao Family’s Ancestor and Patriarch.

After he settled his grudge with Xiao Family, Huang Xiaolong had initially planned to check out Immortal Phoenix Faith Palace’s Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix and the ancient devil master’s cultivation dwelling under the Great Abyss of Ghosts, Gods, and Devils Formation at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, but he squashed the idea in the end.

With his current strength, it is impossible for him to tame that Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix, much less for him to tame the Four Odd Beasts. Thus, there was no point in going there.

He decided to go there after he had advanced to high-level Ancestor God Realm.

At that time, he could go and get that Tianwu Treasure as well.
