“Smart! That’s right, as long as you can get a Buddha Pellet from a God King Realm master and feed it to Li Lu, everything else will be much easier!” The little cow continued while swinging her tail, “By the time you breakthrough to high-level Ancestor God Realm you would be able to expel the evil spirit from her body, using your strength and the support of the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool. Or if you could borrow the Fortune Gate headquarters’ Fortune Divine Artifact before that, you could also use it to eliminate the evil spirit!”

Huang Xiaolong was a little relieved hearing the little cow’s words, but he frowned once again.

Buddhist cultivators were scarce in the Divine World, not to mention, God King Realm Buddhist cultivators were very rare. Where was he supposed to go and find a God King Realm Buddhist cultivator? Moreover, the Buddha Pellet was the source of a Buddhist cultivator. Even if he could find a God King Realm Buddhist cultivator, how could he ask for their Buddha Pellet casually?

Would he need to make a trip to the Buddha World?

But... with his current strength, it would take several hundreds of millenniums to traverse space and reach the Buddha World...!

The Divine World was bigger than he could imagine; forget about Ancestor God Realm Masters, even God King Realm masters would rarely visit other world surfaces in their lifetimes.

“Although it’s hard to find a God King Realm Buddhist cultivator’s Buddha Pellet, I do know of a place that surely has it.” The little cow assured Huang Xiaolong as she saw his troubled expression.

“What place?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up instantly.

“The Royal Buddha Great Worlds!” She answered. “The Royal Buddha Great Worlds?” Huang Xiaolong had not heard of this place until now.

“Master, I know about this Royal Buddha Great Worlds, and it’s a very famous big world surface in the southern region of the Divine World. This Royal Buddha Great Worlds is somewhat similar to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield—there are more than ten thousand world surfaces that have formed the Royal Buddha Great Worlds. Although it’s interesting that there are numerous Buddhist Sects and countless temples in every corner of the Royal Buddha Great Worlds. Nine out of ten people living there are Buddhist cultivators!” Divine elephant Xiang Xun explained.

The southern region of the Divine World! Huang Xiaolong was struck by this information.

The Vientiane World surface was located at the edge of the eastern region of the Divine World, and each of the regions in the four directions were boundless. No wonder he had not heard of the Royal Buddha Great Worlds until now.

“Some big auction houses backed by the Royal Buddha Great Worlds’ super forces sometimes auction God King Realms’ Buddha Pellet.” The little cow went on, “Although the God King Realm’s Buddha Pellet sells for an exorbitant price, you can totally afford it with your current wealth.”

The little cow knew very well how deep Huang Xiaolong’s pocket was. Not to mention, she was also aware of Huang Xiaolong’s ability to condense spirit stones from spiritual energy!

Now that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Ancestor God Realm, he could condense grade seven spirit stones!

Grade seven spirit stones with high purity spiritual energy was a treasure used for cultivating and refining pills. High grade spirit stones were popular everywhere in the Divine World.

“But, how long would it take for us to reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds?” Huang Xiaolong asked the most crucial question.

At the end of the day, Li Lu could only hold on for six years.

If they couldn’t get their hands on the Buddha Pellet within six years’ time and give it to Li Lu, their efforts would be in vain even if they managed to find a God King Realm’s Buddha Pellet in the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

“The Royal Buddha Great Worlds is located on the east side of the southern region, thus it’s comparatively closer to us. However, even at our current fastest speed, it would take us three hundred years to reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds!” The little cow answered honestly.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened, “What? Three hundred years! Then, a roundtrip is six hundred years!” Huang Xiaolong had an impulse to strangle the little cow.

If it takes six hundred years, what’s the fart purpose they plan to go to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds? Li Lu would have turned into a monster long before they would have even reached the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

The little cow chuckled, “I haven’t finished, why are you in such a hurry?”

Haven’t finished?

The little cow’s slow-as-a-tortoise-speed made Huang Xiaolong glare at her murderously.

The little cow cleared her throat a few times before saying, “Before we leave, we could go buy a top grade flying boat. If we have a top grade flying boat, Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng could pull it, we could reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds in seven to eight years. A roundtrip is only fifteen years or so.”

Fifteen years! Huang Xiaolong’s heart accepted this information reluctantly.

But, even though their expedition time was cut down to fifteen years, Li Lu still won’t have enough time to hold on.

Huang Xiaolong was about to ask when the little cow said, “Let me rest for a second, I haven’t finished.”

Still haven’t finished talking!

Huang Xiaolong lifted his foot and kicked the little cow’s butt with blazing eyes.

The little cow quickly said, “In truth, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s elephant elixir also can suppress evil spirits!”

Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, and the others were surprised. ‘The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s elephant elixir!’

Huang Xiaolong looked at Xiang Xun. Xiang Xun respectfully said to Huang Xiaolong, “It is so, Master. Though our Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s elephant elixir could suppress evil spirits, its effect is small, and it requires the combination of an ancient secret technique. This technique is only known to our Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Old Ancestor and several Eminent Elders!”

This was the reason why Xiang Xun had not mentioned this method to Huang Xiaolong earlier.

The little cow nodded, confirming Xiang Xun’s words and added, “Originally, this secret technique was indeed known only by Xiang Meng and those few kids, but in the past, Xiang Meng and I have had lots of discussions about the great dao. I know this secret technique, since he had once mentioned it to me. With the technique and the God King Realm’s elephant elixir, I can temporarily suppress the evil spirit in Li Lu’s body, so that it can’t wreck anymore havoc inside her body for the next thirty to forty years!”

Thirty to forty years! Huang Xiaolong’s heart started beating faster.

As long as Li Lu could hold on for thirty to forty years, then that would give him enough time to save her.

“Senior Xiaoniu, you know our Old Ancestor?!” Xiang Xun looked at her, astounded. He knew that his Old Ancestor’s true name was Xiang Meng!

The little cow’s tail pointed to the sky, “This cow even knows the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and Devil Tribe’s Wu Tian.”

“Move quickly then!” Huang Xiaolong scolded as he took out the bottle of God King Realm’s elephant elixir; he couldn’t stand the little cow standing there idly and blowing her own trumpets about her past glory.

The little cow smiled wryly at Huang Xiaolong’s reaction and said, “I don’t need the whole bottle, a dozen drops are enough, or Li Lu’s godhead won’t be able to stand it. However, I need Xiang Xun by my side to help me during the process.”

Huang Xiaolong immediately told Xiang Xun to help the little cow.

The little cow opened her mouth and sucked in a dozen drops of glistening elephant elixir from the blood-red bottle. The drops of elephant elixir separately fell on Li Lu’s forehead, chest, both palms, and legs, and were simultaneously absorbed into her body gradually.

Purple lightning sizzled from the little cow’s golden horns as bubbles of purple lightning liquid floated out, enveloping Li Lu’s body.

Xiang Xun began circulating his godforce to assist the little cow.

Huang Xiaolong watched everything without blinking, as if he was afraid something would go wrong.

The room was deathly quiet.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er guarded at the door to prevent Black Ice Ancestor or any other miscellaneous person from trying to interrupt the little cow and Xiang Xun.

In the blink of an eye, two days went by. The green light inside Li Lu’s body glimmered unsteadily, and the nefarious nightmare soul’s screeching gradually weakened.

Just as joy rose to Huang Xiaolong’s face, several bright lights appeared high in the air of the Vientiane World. Space was torn and out came Feng Yingying and the rest of the sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs.

They were finally back in the Vientiane World!
