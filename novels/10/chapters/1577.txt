Unlike Fang Gan, everyone felt that it was a waste for him to leave the competition. Of course, Zhou Chen was one of them. After all, there was another disciple at the Tenth Order God King Realm taking part in the selections. If he were to meet Huang Xiaolong during one of the rounds, Huang Xiaolong would suffer for sure.

No one thought that Huang Xiaolong would voluntarily withdraw from the competition. This caused his plan to fall through.

“Huang Xiaolong, I let you off for now!” Zhou Chen muttered under his breath as a chilly light flashed through his eyes.

Before long, the third, fourth, and fifth round of selections passed and the entire event came to a close.

Of course, Liu Yong placed first.

As for the second place, it went to a female disciple called Chen Rongxin. She was the personal disciple of the Hall Master of the medicinal hall. The third place belonged to a disciple called Zhao Yutai. He was the personal disciple of the Hall Master of the disciplinary hall.

Even though they placed below Liu Yong, they were still experts at the peak of the late-Tenth Order God King Realm. All of them were the hopes of the Fortune Emperor Palace as they would be able to fight for a good position in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

After collecting his rewards, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Dragon Tiger Palace Gardens with the four ladies in tow.

As soon as he stepped into the palace, he saw the little cow with her buttocks raised enjoying a suntan in the yard. Seeing the look of enjoyment on her face, Huang Xiaolong was stunned speechless.

“Lu’er, all of you can go inside first. I have something to ask her.” Huang Xiaolong turned and addressed the four ladies behind him.

Yao Chi and Li Lu nodded their heads obediently and brought Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao into the inner palace.

When the four of them could no longer be seen, Huang Xiaolong walked to the little cow and asked her about the Archdevils.

“Why are you asking about the Archdevils from the grandmist era?!” The little cow flipped around in shock.

Huang Xiaolong started to recount the events from the Hall of Supreme Harmony and told her about Sun Shihai’s Archdevil’s bloodline.

When she heard the story, the little cow widened her eyes in shock. “Sun Shihai actually as an Archdevil’s bloodline?!”

This was an extremely shocking piece of news!

That was because an Archdevil bloodline was equivalent to a king of supreme godhead. No one knew how long it was since the last person who possessed an Archdevil bloodline appeared. No one ever thought that after Huang Xiaolong’s king of supreme godhead, there would be Sun Shihai’s Archdevil bloodline!

“Is someone with an Archdevil bloodline strong?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow nodded resolutely and said solemnly, “Of course.” She paused for a moment before continuing, “Normally, a descendant who possesses an Archdevil bloodline will be able to receive the Archdevil’s inheritance when they mature!”

Huang Xiaolong swallowed his shock. “The inheritance of the Archdevil?!”

Initially, he had thought that Sun Shihai merely had a portion of the Archdevil’s power. From the looks of things, that wasn’t the case.

“Do you mean that Sun Shihai can one day become as strong as that Archdevil born in the grandmist era?!” Huang Xiaolong asked again as the fact was simply too shocking.

The little cow nodded her head. “You can say that. As long as Sun Shihai doesn’t fall along the way, he most probably can.”

The frown on Huang Xiaolong’s face became deeper. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the past, he had never thought too highly of Sun Shihai. From the looks of it, he was going to be trouble in the future.

“Actually, you don’t need to worry too much about it. The Archdevils in the grandmist era are ranked differently. As for your master, the king of grandmist, he is much stronger than the rest. Oh right, he’s just like me!” The little cow raised her head proudly and continued, “Don’t look down on me! In fact, I am much stronger than most of the Archdevils from the grandmist era.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the little cow who was blowing her own trumpet and laughed, “Fine fine. You’re the strongest cow in the world.”

“Of course!” The little cow chuckled and she stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated gaze. “Actually, you might also be a descendant of an Archdevil!”

“Me?!” Huang Xiaolong pointed at himself with a bewildered expression on his face.

The little cow nodded her head. “Your comprehension ability is out of this world. There is indeed a possibility of you being a descendant of a certain Archdevil... It’s just that your bloodline hasn’t been awakened yet. The stronger the bloodline, the harder it is to awaken. However, the moment it does, even the heavens will shake.” The look in her eyes became even more profound and she continued, “Right now, you already have a king of supreme godhead. If you really awaken an Archdevil’s bloodline... won’t you be flipping the heavens at that point?!”

The more she thought about it, the more horrified she felt.

“It’s just a guess. I might not be a descendant of an Archdevil, right?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and changed the topic, “By the way, are all the Archdevil powerhouses born in the grandmist era called the Grandmist Archdevils?”

“That’s right. All of the experts born in the grandmist era are called Grandmist Archdevils. All of them were at the God King realm when they were born.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly. God King Realm the moment they were born? I went through so much and experienced so much danger, just to become a late-Sixth Order God King Realm cultivator...

“Wouldn’t there be a large number of Grandmist Archdevils?” Huang Xiaolong continued to ask.

Rolling her eyes at him, the little cow chided, “Who told you that? Do you think it’s easy for an Archdevil to be born?! Even getting pregnant was difficult in the grandmist era... The chance of an Archdevil being born every tens of billions of years is already slim to none. There are probably only around ten Grandmist Archdevils in all of existence.”

“Only around ten of them?!” Huang Xiaolong’s jaws dropped in shock.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had thought that there would at least be several tens of thousands of them if not hundreds of thousands of them. Never in his wildest imaginations did he expect there to be only ten of them.

The little cow explained, “All the Archdevils were born through luck. Not only would they possess a celestial demonic physique, their godheads would at least be at the supreme level. None of them would perish easily. Even if they do, their successor would appear shortly.”

“Celestial demonic physique?” Huang Xiaolong seemed a little curious all of a sudden. “Are these considered unique physiques?” He paused to think for a second before continuing, “Isn’t the Anciently Heavenly Emperor a Grandmist Archdevil? He perished a long time ago, but none of his successors have popped up yet.”

“A celestial demonic physique is a type of unique physique. At the same time, it is not a kind of unique physique. Instead, a celestial demonic physique surpasses the might of a unique physique. Of course, you had to see what kind of unique physique you were comparing it to. Your True Dragon Physique is disgustingly strong, and it won’t lose out in the slightest if you compare it to the celestial demonic physiques. As for the successor of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, hehehe, he should appear very soon. Once you obtain the Ancient Heavenly Court, won’t you be his successor?! Not to mention the fact that you are also the successor of the king of hell!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t continue the conversation and he retrieved the chaos lightning bead he had obtained in the barbaric space. “Is this chaos lightning bead an object from the grandmist era?” After returning from the Floating Twilight Land, Huang Xiaolong had never got the time to ask the little cow about the chaos lightning bead.

The little cow stared at the pearl in Huang Xiaolong’s hand and an unconcealable look of joy flashed across her face. “This isn’t a treasure born from the grandmist era!”

It isn’t?!

Then...
