Chapter 3701: Huang Xiaolong in Danger

The five monster kings gathered together and stood behind the Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen.

The Blood Tentacles King sneered, “Even without the Ghost Devil King, we’re strong enough to fight against you.” The blood qi around his body soared into the skies and turned into an ocean.

It was stopped by a formless pressure before it could swallow the Golden Qilin King.

With a smile on his face, the Golden Qilin King waved his hand. He shattered the sea of blood, causing the Blood Tentacles King to retreat slightly.

The faces of the four other monster kings changed slightly.

The Golden Qilin King mocked, “You wish to fight against me?! With you losers?”

If the Ghost Devil King came, his life might be threatened. However, there was nothing he was afraid of now. Naturally, he didn’t care about the Dragon Overlord and the others.

Zhu Chen shattered his transmission symbol sneakily, but it was still noticed by the Golden Qilin King.

With a sneer on his lips, he continued, “Humph, don’t even think of calling Huang Xiaolong back here to help you. He’s in a much more dangerous situation than you guys. He won’t make it back.”

Their faces changed instantly.

“Did you draw Lord Huang Xiaolong over to the Devil Abyss on purpose?!” The Dragon Overlord’s face sank.

“Looks like you’re not stupid. That’s right. We captured Mo Kun in order to draw him over! We’ll deal with him with the power of the Devil Abyss!”

The hearts of everyone in the city sank.

The Ferocious Devil and Green Ghost were missing, and Huang Xiaolong was the only hope left for the Unknown Space. If anything were to happen to him, the Unknown Space would be thrown into chaos!

“There’s no need to worry. Huang Xiaolong will follow you in the afterlife.” The Golden Qilin King roared with laughter.

The Universe First Race didn’t plan to deal with the Unknown Space so quickly. However, Huang Xiaolong’s appearance shattered their plans. They felt a sense of danger coming from the kid, and they decided to get rid of him before anything bad happened.

After all, their plan to destroy the Thirteen Universes a second time was threatened by Huang Xiaolong!

When the eight of them were still stuck in a daze, the Golden Qilin King moved. He appeared before them in an instant as his fists shot out.

Golden fists appeared in the skies as they slammed downwards. It was much stronger than his strike before!

Previously, he was hiding some of his strength. Now that there was nothing else for him to worry about, he could go all out!

The Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the five monster kings didn’t dare to hold back. They pushed themselves to their limit as they tried to defend themselves.

As none of them had their universe treasures, their combat abilities were slightly affected.

Once again, they were sent flying.

The experts in the city couldn’t help but panic when they saw their strongest experts being beaten back. Even so, they couldn’t do anything to assist them! After all, the shockwaves of the battle would be more than enough to seriously injure someone like Mo Ren!

“Your Majesty, should we try to contact the old ancestor?” one of the marshals in the celestial empire whispered.

Mo Ren shook his head and sighed. “I tried that a moment ago. I can’t reach him.”

“Do you think that Lord Huang Xiaolong has already been…”

Mo Ren remained quiet. Since the Golden Qilin King had spoken, none of them were confident that Huang Xiaolong would be able to retreat unscathed.

…

When that went down, Huang Xiaolong casually flew through the Devil Abyss. With his heart trembling slightly, his body flashed, and he dodged a strike that came from nowhere. A sword light that struck the place he was once standing in turned the entire area into chaos space.

The sword light was formless and Huang Xiaolong knew that the only thing he could do was to dodge.

A sneer came from the void.

“Who would have thought that you would be so hard to deal with?”

The void seemed to come from the Golden Cymbals King.

As soon as his voice fell, his figure appeared from within the void. He wasn’t the only one. There was another youngster beside him holding a jet-black sword. There was a sinister smile on his face.

Looking at the youngster beside the Golden Cymbals King, Huang Xiaolong felt his heart sinking. “Heaven Devouring King!”

Out of the thirteen kings, the Golden Cymbals King ranked sixth, the Golden Qilin King ranked fifth, and the Heaven Devouring King ranked even higher than them!

He was the fourth-strongest king!

He was a monster whose combat abilities closed in on the 29 billion mark!

Moreover, his sword dao was much stronger than Jian Wushuang!

The Heaven Devouring King looked at Huang Xiaolong and chuckled, “Young man, there’s no need to be afraid. I’ve always been a very nice man. As long as you hand over your universe treasures, I’ll allow you to bring up a request. I’ll fulfill anything you desire as long as it’s within my power!”

“Alright. I’ll hand them over. My request for you is to kill yourself!” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

The faces of the two kings sank. “Brat, who do you think you’re talking to?!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted in response.

However, the Heaven Devouring King soon revealed another smile. “Well, you’ll know what happens when you try to mess with me.” The black sword in his hand disappeared the moment he spoke. Two black swords appeared behind him, and they soon split into four. In an instant, several billion swords hovered behind him.

Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree and miniature star dragons appeared in the skies above. They formed a star dragon world with him as its core.

The black swords behind the Heaven Devouring King shot towards Huang Xiaolong in an instant as they slammed against the Star Dragon World.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Boom!

The Star Dragon World that stood strong against the assault started to tremble, but a hole was soon punched through its surface!
