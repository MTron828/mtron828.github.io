Chapter 2439: Hypocrisy

It was clear that Wu Ge wasn’t helping either side, but Li Chen quickly borrowed Wu Ge’s words to push Huang Xiaolong into the corner. “Huang Xiaolong, even Grand Hall Master Wu Ge thinks that you won’t be able to win. Instead of giving them the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura, you might as well hand it over to the Holy Heavens.”

Huang Xiaolong could’t help but sneer. “What if I refuse to hand it over? Are you going to snatch it from me?”

Li Chen stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“Huang Xiaolong, Senior Brother Li Chen is doing this for the sake of the Holy Heavens!” Xie Yao interrupted them all of a sudden.

However, Huang Xiaolong snapped at him instantly, “Who the f*ck do you think you are? Are you qualified to speak about our matters?”

Xie Yao’s expression sank instantly.

No matter what, he was the personal disciple of Grand Hall Master Wu Ge, but Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to yell at him in front of his master. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Wu Ge looked especially calm as he ignored everything around him.

Before Li Chen could say anything else, Huang Xiaolong interrupted him, “Li Chen, I had enough of your hypocrisy. If you really care about the disciples of the Holy Heavens, why don’t you bring out your treasures and share them with us? Why don’t you hand over the maidservants in your palace over for everyone to enjoy? Do you really think I have no idea what you’re scheming to do?”

Li Chen’s expression sank even further when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Enough. I’ll give you a chance to obtain the grandmist holy spiritual aura. As long as the arena is open, you can send your subordinates over to challenge me. As long as they win, I’ll hand the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura over to you.”

“What?!” Wu Ge and the other hall masters were shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s decision.

A trace of excitement formed in Li Chen’s heart, and he jumped from his seat “Are you serious?”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle softly in his heart when he saw Li Chen’s reaction. “Anyone under the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint can take part in the battle. However, you will have to follow the rules of the battle. If you win, I’ll give you the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura. But if your subordinates lose... I want you to lick my boots in the arena. It shall be carried out immediately in front of the present superpowers!”

Lick Huang Xiaolong’s boots in front of everyone present?!

Li Chen couldn’t help but rage, “Huang Xiaolong, you!!!”

A nonchalant look appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he continued, “If you really think that it’s too humiliating, you can choose not to fight for the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura. Did I force you to take part in the challenge? Whatever. The opportunity is up for grabs.”

A sinister look slowly formed on Li Chen’s face.

Just a moment ago, Xie Yao had secretly spoke to Li Chen. A look of realization appeared on his face, and he nodded. “Alright! I’ll send someone to challenge you. If you lose, the grandmist holy spiritual aura is mine. However, you will have to finish the entire duration of the battle before claiming your victory against me.”

Li Chen quickly changed the terms of the bet. Previously, Huang Xiaolong had wanted him to lick his boots the moment Li Chen’s subordinates lost. However, Li Chen planned to force Huang Xiaolong into a corner by honoring the bet only if he won against the various superpowers.

According to what Li Chen knew, it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to win against Sui Yunfeng. There was no way for him to last the entire six months!

As such, there would be absolutely no risk of him losing!

Since that was the case, the odds were basically stacked against Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Huang Xiaolong knew what Li Chen was thinking, he agreed without hesitation. “Alright!”

Li Chen, you agreed to this. You can’t blame me now.

The moment you agreed to protect Fu Yunjie, the two of us were destined to clash.

Hearing that the agreement was made, Wu Ge couldn’t help but step in. “Your Highness, this....”

Li Chen stopped him immediately. “Grand Hall Master Wu, you heard it yourself. Junior Brother Huang agreed to the terms. I had nothing to do with this. If my master or the other Primal Ancestors ask, please be my witness and state everything that happened truthfully.”

As long as the people he sent defeated Huang Xiaolong, the grandmist holy spiritual aura would belong to him. That was something Huang Xiaolong had agreed to and even if the Primal Ancestors knew about it, they wouldn’t be shameless enough to ask him to return it to Huang Xiaolong.

Hall Master Yuan Shuai, who was in charge of the various branches, stood up and laughed. “Of course, Your Highness, please rest assured that even if the four Primal Ancestors ask about this, I will definitely speak the truth!”

The two other hall masters who stood on Li Chen’s side stepped up to agree instantly.

A smile appeared on Li Chen’s face, and he stood up to address everyone present. “Junior Brother Huang probably has to prepare for the challenge. Let’s call it a day and hope that he lasts for more than a day in the arena!”

Huang Xiaolong got up from his seat with an expressionless face. “That’s not something you need to worry about. Just prepare to face the consequence.”

“Sure!” Li Chen was full of smiles as he led the others away.

Wu Ge slowly got to his feet as well, but he merely shook his head slowly before leaving the main hall. The various hall masters and everyone under him followed behind him.

After watching Li Chen’s delighted expression when he left, Chen Zhi turned to speak to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, if Li Chen and the others learn about your holy soul, they will probably bawl their eyes out and cry for their mothers....”

Yu Ming couldn’t help but smirk. “Wait till they lick His Highness’ boots after the challenge ends. You’ll know what a crying beast looks like.”

The several True Saints roared with laughter instantly.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold back his laughter when he thought about it. “We shall enter the market to purchase origin herbs to refine level ten origin spiritual pills soon.” Previously, Chen Zhi and the others had refined several batches of level ten origin spiritual pills. However, he was about to run out.

“Yes, Your Highness.”

Soon, Huang Xiaolong led the others towards the market of the Mirage Pavilion.

As he left the Holy Heavens branch to shop for origin herbs, the main hall of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate was bustling with activity. A row of disciples stood at attention in the main hall.

The entire group consisted of geniuses in the Third Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

There was a purple haired youngster standing at the very front, right below Shen Jiewen.

“Yunfeng, you shall be the first disciple we send up to challenge that brat!” Shen Jiewen’s eyes landed on the purple haired youngster, and he continued, “When you defeat Huang Xiaolong, I will promote you to be my direct disciple!”

Sui Yunfeng fell to his knees as he thanked Shen Jiewen. “Patriarch, please rest assured. I will not disappoint you!”

Shen Jiewen nodded his head and pardoned Sui Yunfeng. He had absolute confidence in the youngster’s strength.

“Patriarch, when Sui Yunfeng enters the arena, do we...?” One of the hall masters slid a finger across his throat.

A light flashed through Shen Jiewen’s eyes, but he decided against it. “Even though the challenge is one of life and death, the four Primal Ancestors will definitely rage if we kill Huang Xiaolong.” Turning to Sui Yunfeng, he continued, “Do whatever you want as long as he lives.”

‘Yes, Patriarch!”
