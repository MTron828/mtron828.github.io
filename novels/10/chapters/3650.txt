Chapter 3651: Arrival

Huang Xiaolong slowly made his way over, and smiled when he saw Tao Han’er jumping up and down at the entrance of the Jian Family. “You don’t need to come all the way out here… We won’t get lost in such a small place!”

Tao Han’er ran over to Huang Xiaolong and grinned, “I was afraid that you guys would be stopped at the entrance! After all, you might not have gotten an invitation!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Tao Hang and laughed, “If they do, we’ll use your great name to enter the palace!”

Tao Hang grinned, “Lord Huang is right!”

Pouting slightly, Tao Han’er complained, “All of you are bullying me! Hmph!” She then turned to Huang Xiaolong and muttered, “Lord Huang, let’s go! The ceremony should be starting soon!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and entered the Jian Family Palace with Zhu Fei, Cao Dehong, and the rest.

With Tao Han’er present, none of the disciples dared to stop Huang Xiaolong’s group. Of course, not stopping them was one thing. Making a report to the higher ups was another. They quickly sent out reports to Jian Bifei the moment Huang Xiaolong entered.

Kong Fanxing asked his grandfather after looking at Tao Han’er’s reaction. “Ancestor, how did they get to know each other?”

“I heard that Princess Tao Han’er and her foster father were saved by the Blue Dragon Young Master back in the Limitless Land. From then on, they started to follow him. That is why she calls the Blue Dragon Young Master her lord…” Kong Shao explained.

“So that’s the case…” Kong Fanxing muttered, “The Blue Dragon Young Master is pretty lucky…”

Chuckling slightly, Kong Shao brought the members of the Kong Family into the palace.

“Ancestor, you stopped at the part where Jian Shengdong brough the members of the Jian Family into the tea house. What happened after that?” Kong Fanxing pestered. “Did the Blue Dragon Young Master bring out their connection to Princess Tao Han’er for Jian Shengdong to let them off?”

“No.” Kong Shao muttered softly.

No?!

Kong Fanxing was taken aback slightly.

“When Lord Jian Shengdong, Jian Chao, and the others arrived at the tea house, the Blue Dragon Young Master enraged them and they moved against him. Lord Jian Chao summoned his sword qi and managed to stab the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Kong Shao explained.

“No way… The Blue Dragon Young Master doesn’t look injured at all!” Kong Fanxing gasped.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“That’s because he isn’t. It’s said that after taking the strike, he didn’t suffer the slightest injury. He even said that Jiao Chao’s sword qi is as weak as a breeze… He summoned his own sword qi and sent Lord Jiao Chao flying. It’s said that he only allowed them to live because of Tao Han’er.”

Kong Fanxing’s jaws dropped.

Eminent Elder Jian Chao of the Jian Family, a half-step Universe God, was defeated in one move! How strong did his opponent have to be?!

“What happened next?” Kong Fanxing pressed.

“Lord Jian Shengdong obediently paid up after collecting all the money they had. They brought Lord Jian Chao back to the Jian Family.” Kong Shao said in a strange tone.

By this time, massive waves were battering against Kong Fanxing’s tiny little heart.

Lord Jian Shengdong, an expert who broke through the 10 billion units mark, was an existence akin to a god in their eyes! Even so, he couldn’t compare to the Blue Dragon Young Master!

“But… I also heard that he has some sort of dubious relationship with Yu Xiaohong.” Kong Shao whispered.

“What?! Are you talking about Lord Yu Xiaohong of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire?!”

“Yep…” Kong Shao nodded. “Everyone in the Zhu Lan Land knows that Lord Jian Weifeng has something for her! Now that rumors are spreading about the Blue Dragon Young Master’s relationship with Yu Xiaohong, he won’t be able to leave the palace in one piece!”

All of a sudden, another voice rang through the air. “The Limitless Master has arrived!”

“The King of the Ocean Race in the Nightless Sea has arrived!”

Kong Shao was shocked and he muttered to himself, “Their relationship with the Jian Family isn’t anything special… Why are they here?!”

Kong Fanxing analyzed the situation and replied, “They’re probably here to kiss up to Lord Jian Wushuang after hearing that he broke through.”

Kong Shao nodded. It was definitely possible.

A huge group of experts came in the distance, and the two of them who led the way were Wu Xin and Ye Ye.

Behind them, more than ten thousand experts of the Limitless Lands and the Ocean Race could be seen. All of them were God of Creation Realm experts!

Shock filled everyone who arrived. What type of formation was this?! If Jian Wushuang hadn’t broken through and was recognized as the sixth strongest individual of the Unknown Lands, they would have thought that Wu Xin and Ye Ye were there to declare war on the Jian Family!

Who the hell brought over ten thousand experts over to offer some congratulations?!

Kong Fanxing felt his scalp going numb when he saw the newcomers. The expression of those who had already entered changed as well.

“Looks like something big is about to go down…” Kong Shao frowned.

“Ancestor, do you think that they’re here to mess with the Jian Family? That is not possible, right? Lord Jian Wushuang broke through the 20 billion mark! Who will dare to mess with them?” Kong Fanxing gasped.

Indeed… No matter how strong the Limitless Lands and the Ocean Race were, they would be kicking a steel board if they came to look for trouble!

After all, most of the people who attended the ceremony were friends with the Jian Family! The experts present were comparable to the amount brought by Wu Xin and Ye Ye!

Kong Shao shook his head and tried to clear his mind. “No… There’s something off here.”

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t put his finger on the weird feeling in his chest.

Very quickly, Wu Xin and Ye Ye arrived.

“Lord Limitless, Your Majesty, according to our rules, everyone can only bring ten people with them.” The disciple guarding the entrance gathered his courage before speaking to the two of them. Of course, he didn’t forget his manners.

Wu Xin and Ye Ye nodded casually before randomly picking ten people to follow them in. The rest remained outside.

Just as they had entered the palace, another announcement rang through the air. “Her Majesty, Yu Xiaohong of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire has arrived!”
