Chapter 3379: Bathe the Shushan Immortal Gate in Blood

“Another one?!” Du Yan felt his heart pounding in his chest.

He stared at Huang Xiaolong in utter amazement.

“Senior Huang, please wait a moment. I’ll report this to the headquarters immediately!” After snapping back to reality, Du Yan bowed respectfully.

Like Mu Shuihan, he was also shocked by the appearance of the grand dao pill.

Unless one was a Combined Dao Ancestor, no one would be able to remain calm in the face of a grand dao pill!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong’s identity far exceeded his expectation the moment he saw the pill.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in acknowledgment.

Bowing one more time, Du Yan left the hall.

Huang Xiaolong and Mu Shuihan were left in the hall alone. He wasn’t afraid that they would reject his request. As long as their minds weren’t damaged, they wouldn’t dare to reject his request.

Indeed. Du Yan returned before long. He bowed respectfully and spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Senior Huang, the director accepted the request. Moreover, he wishes to meet with Senior Huang personally.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and handed the pill over. “I won’t stay in the Immortal World for long. You need to give me the information in ten days, and if you fail to do so, I’ll head over to the Heavenly Court.”

If that were to happen, Huang Xiaolong would use the power of the Heavenly Court to search for the four of them.

With his heart pounding in his chest, Du Yan made a resolute promise, “Senior Huang, you can rest assured that we will mobilize all our forces to obtain the information you need.”

“Relax. Whether you manage to find them, this pill is yours.”

“Many thanks to Senior Huang!” Du Yan felt waves battering against his heart when he saw how casually Huang Xiaolong gave them the pill.

Soon after, he escorted them out personally. He stood frozen to his spot even after Huang Xiaolong and Mu Shuihan had left, and his actions shocked the experts who were shopping in the main hall.

They had never seen the branch director sending anyone off before!

Not even the region master received this type of treatment!

Not too long after the two of them left, the news of Mu Shuihan’s appearance in the Holy Pavilion with a mysterious man spread through the lands.

The region master also received the news.

“Oh? Du Yan sent them off personally, and he didn’t move until they completely disappeared?” Song Zhipeng, the region master of the Northern Dragon Region gasped.

“Yes. From what we managed to uncover, the man with Mu Shuihan was called ‘Senior Huang’!” Li Shuang, Song Zhipeng’s attendant, replied.

“Senior Huang… So he should be an expert in the Immortal King Realm like my father!” a lady at the side said all of a sudden.

The lady was called Song Qianqian, and she was Song Zhipeng’s only daughter. She was an absolute genius whose talent was comparable to Mu Shuihan!

“Region Master, we received a piece of news from the Shushan Immortal Gate! Mu Shuihan is going to accept his successor, and the ceremony will be held tomorrow!” Li Shuang continued.

“After accepting Wang Lin as his disciple, Mu Shuihan never accepted another disciple… He actually chose to accept a new successor after so many years…” Song Qianqian frowned. “Do you know who it is?”

Li Shuang shook his head. “I do not know who he is. From what the experts of the Shushan Immortal Gate said, he’s called Yan Bao’er! He was brought there by Senior Huang.”

Song Zhipeng fell deep into thought.

“Prepare a big gift for them tomorrow. I’ll personally head over to the Shushan Immortal Gate for the ceremony,” Song Zhipeng ordered.

Song Qianqian and Li Shuang were shocked by his sudden proclamation.

“Father, there’s no need for you to attend personally. I can bring the gifts over in your stead,” Song Qianqian muttered.

Even though Mu Shuihan’s apprenticeship ceremony was a huge matter, Song Zhipeng was the region master! There was no need for him to attend the event at all!

“No. I’ll go personally.” Song Zhipeng shook his head and sighed.

He wanted to see the man they called ‘Senior Huang’, and what qualifications he had for Du Yan to behave so respectfully to him.

Huang Xiaolong had no idea what was going on in the outside world as he was too lazy to care, and he imparted a set of secret art to both Yan Bao’er and Mu Shuihan after he returned. He also cleared off some doubts Mu Shuihan had in his cultivation.

Wang Lin ran into the immortal region all of a sudden to make an urgent report. “Master, Eminent Elder Wu Wei made a report to say that many disciples were injured by the disciples of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate! They killed two of our core disciples!”

A frown formed on Mu Shuihan’s face.

The Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate was also another top-tier power in the Northern Dragon Region. They were one of the most ancient existences, and they were stronger than the Shushan Immortal Gate.

In the past, he battled with the old ancestor of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate over a medicinal herb, and their grudge was hence laid down. That wasn’t the first skirmish they had.

However, it was the first time a core disciple of one of the factions was killed!

The moment something like that happened, there was no going back. Things were bound to grow into a full-blown conflict.

“Are you guys mortal enemies?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Mu Shuihan quickly introduced the problem they had with each other.

“Senior Huang, how do you think we should deal with this?” It was clear that Mu Shuihan wasn’t planning to clash with the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate at the moment. After all, they were an ancient power. Their relationship with the other factions in the Northern Dragon Region was solid, and the Shushan Immortal Gate would only suffer if they went head to head.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Mu Shuihan and snorted, “If they kill two core disciples of my factions, I’ll kill four of theirs!”

Huang Xiaolong was never a kind person.

“Yes, Senior Huang!” Turning to Wang Lin he said, “You heard Senior Huang.”

Wang Lin hesitated for a moment, but he eventually bowed in acknowledgment.

The corpses of four core disciples of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate were quickly sent to the old ancestor of their faction, Lu Ming. The patriarch of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate, Liu Zhao, also received the news.

Lu Ming’s expression was dark when he looked at the corpses of the core disciples before him. One of them was a disciple with extreme talent! He had high hopes for the kid!

“The Shushan Immortal Gate went too far! Ancestor, please allow us to exterminate those arrogant dogs!” one of the grand elders of the faction roared.

“That’s right! We’ll wipe them off the face of our Northern Dragon Region!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Tomorrow, Mu Shuihan is holding an apprenticeship ceremony! We’ll wash the Shushan Immortal Gate in blood!”

The doyens and grand elders of the faction growled in unison.

A frosty light flashed through Lu Ming’s eyes. “I’ll contact my sworn brother right now.”

His sworn brother was Immortal King Chen Keyu! He was the youngest Immortal King in the Eastern Dongsheng Continent, and his reputation was like a sun in the sky! Others had no idea how Lu Ming was related to Chen Keyu, and he felt as though it was time to reveal their friendship to the world.

The night passed quietly.

As the next day arrived, the Shushan Immortal Gate was filled with a festive atmosphere.
