Chapter 2154: Punk, You Finally Came Out!

When Xumi Old Man heard the King of Grandmist, the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the others were at the Heavenly Saint Country, he departed the Heaven Valley together with Huang Xiaolong for the Heavenly Saint Country.

Xumi Old Man had a friendly relationship with the King of Grandmist, little cow, and the others. Coming back in this cycle of reincarnation, he, too, wanted to meet up with some old friends.

At the Heaven Valley City, the Mighty God Prince soon received a report from his subordinate that Huang Xiaolong was about to leave the Heaven Valley City.

“Did you say that kid is leaving Heaven Valley City? Right now?” The Mighty God Prince found it hard to believe. That kid isn’t afraid of death, is he?

“Yes, Young Lord.” The Mighty God Heavenly Country’s general Liu Qun reported. “That kid is currently heading towards Heaven Valley City’s city gates, and they are almost there!”

The Mighty God Prince jumped to his feet. A mocking cold sneer spread over his face. “Very good! It really looks like that punk thinks that I wouldn’t dare to kill him with the Heavenly Saint Country behind him. He’s literally courting death right now!”

On the previous day, the Mighty God Prince had publicly announced by specifically directing his words at Huang Xiaolong’s group that he would make a move on them the moment they stepped out of the Heaven Valley City.

And today, Huang Xiaolong had openly shown that he was leaving the Heaven Valley City. What was that considered as? Was he taking the Mighty God Prince’s words as a joke?

“Assemble everyone and make preparations. We’re going out of the city to kill that punk!” The Mighty God Prince ordered General Liu Qun.

“Yes, Young Lord!”

An hour later...

Huang Xiaolong, Xumi Old Man, Zhu Xinyi, and Zhu Hong walked out of the Heaven Valley City’s city gates. They had not gone far from the city gates when the four of them spotted a group of people led by the Mighty God Prince, blocking their path up ahead.

There weren’t a lot of people, but each one of them was a renowned expert of the Mighty God Heavenly Country. All of them were Sovereign Realm experts, and the lowest cultivation realms were still Second Order and Third Order Sovereigns.

Although low-level Sovereigns’ battle prowess couldn’t be compared to overlords, they still held a high status in the Mighty God Heavenly Country.

The Mighty God Prince stood there, with a bright red cloak fluttering from his shoulders. There was neither joy nor worry on his face as he spoke, “Punk, you finally came out!”

The Mighty God Prince’s flat voice sounded, but it was filled with surging killing intent.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother to respond to the Mighty God Prince’s words and continued walking onwards with the rest.

Several people were hiding in the vicinity to watch the excitement, including the Heavenly Terror Country’s General Sun Po and his subordinates.

Sun Po watched Huang Xiaolong intently, and the sneer on his face deepened, “That punk really has the guts to leave the city. It’s a pity that the five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills will fall into other’s hands!”

After killing Huang Xiaolong, those five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills would end up in the Mighty God Prince’s hands.

Xumi Old Man was worried when he saw the Mighty God Prince’s group waiting for them, and his tone was heavy with concern as he said to Huang Xiaolong, “Young friend Huang, should we retreat to Heaven Valley City?”

Even though he had advanced to a high-level Sovereign Realm in this lifetime, there were so many experts on the Mighty God Prince’s side. Xumi Old Man wasn’t confident that he could protect Huang Xiaolong and get out of this situation unscathed.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled nonchalantly and shook his head, indicating that it was not necessary.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of four stood still as they stopped a hundred meters from the Mighty God Prince’s group.

Zhu Xinyi sternly reprimanded the Mighty God Prince, “Mighty God Prince, do you know what you are doing? You’d better apologize to Young Master Huang and withdraw, or you’ll regret your actions later.”

“Apologize to him?” The Mighty God Prince pointed rudely at Huang Xiaolong and let out a wanton laughter, “Zhu Xinyi, did a donkey kick your head and turn you silly? This punk better be wise to come over here on his knees and lick my toes.”

A wave of laughter erupted from the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts.

Both Zhu Xinyi’s and Zhu Hong’s faces sank with dissatisfaction.

“Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong, both of you better scram far away.” The Mighty God Prince snickered with contempt and added, “Don’t assume that I wouldn’t dare to deal with you two because you’re from the Heavenly Saint Country. Stay out of this or I’ll break your legs and deal with the two of you!”

Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong were enraged by his words.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he spoke, “Are all of you attacking together, or one by one?”

The Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts blanked for a second. One of the generals by the Mighty God Prince’s side grinned widely, “Punk, aren’t you overestimating yourself far too much? You want us to attack together? You’re far from qualified. I alone am more than enough to kill you.”

After saying this, he turned to the Mighty God Prince and respectfully requested, “Young Lord, I’m willing to kill this punk on your behalf.”

The Mighty God Prince nodded his head, giving his approval, “Alright, I’ll trouble General Chen Tianhao then.”

Chen Tianhao was an early Fifth Order Sovereign and was a trusted subordinate of his. Based purely on battle strength, many peak mid-Fifth Order Sovereigns were no match against Chen Tianhao.

“It’s nothing at all.” Chen Tianhao responded respectfully, then turned and strode towards Huang Xiaolong. “Punk, are you ready? I’m going to attack!”

Chen Tianhao smiled brightly at Huang Xiaolong, showing exactly eight white teeth.

With his strength, he had the confidence to win against the several top ten young masters in the bottom rung. Then what was so special about an unknown young man like Huang Xiaolong? Although he could see that Huang Xiaolong’s connection to the Heavenly Saint Country was not as simple as it seemed on the surface, but so what? With the Mighty God Prince, and the Mighty God Heavenly Country backing him, the Heavenly Saint Country would not have the guts to do anything to him even if he killed Huang Xiaolong.

“Young friend, it’s better I handle this.” Xumi Old Man said to Huang Xiaolong. He had learned from Huang Xiaolong earlier that Huang Xiaolong was the King of Grandmist’s personal disciple.

Xumi Old Man knew the level of the King of Grandmist’s strength, and even if the King of Grandmist himself was here today, he was not an opponent against Chen Tianhao.

But just as Xumi Old Man was about to step forward to take on Chen Tianhao, Huang Xiaolong reached out and lightly tapped his finger in the air. A powerful and unbelievably faster force that left streaks of golden flames in the air hit Chen Tianhao.

Chen Tianhao stopped as if he was frozen on the spot. Then, he was incinerated with a loud popping sound, leaving a pile of gray ashes on the ground, while some of the gray ashes scattered in the wind.

The experts hidden in the vicinity stiffened. They looked a little silly as they stared at the pile of gray ashes scattering. That was the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s General Chen Tianhao?

Even Mighty God Prince and the rest of the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts were dumbfounded on the spot for a very long time.

Xumi Old Man was no exception.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Mighty God Prince. He said in a thick, indifferent voice, “I’m ready and prepared, but it seems your subordinate is not ready yet?”

The Mighty God Prince’s senses returned hearing Huang Xiaolong’s voice. His face was ugly to the extreme. He glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, “You’re actually so shameless as to make a sneak attack?”

Although Huang Xiaolong’s strength had greatly exceeded Mighty God Prince’s estimation, he believed that Huang Xiaolong defeated Chen Tianhao largely because he made an unexpected attack. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Huang Xiaolong snickered hearing the Mighty God Prince’s slander. He wasn’t concerned about it at all. His gaze swept over the remaining Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts, and he asked, “Who is next?”

“Young Lord, let me go kill this punk!” A Mighty God Heavenly Country’s general stepped out and requested permission from the Mighty God Prince.

This general was a peak late-Sixth Order Sovereign. He was absolutely stronger compared to Chen Tianhao.

The Mighty God Prince’s expression eased slightly, and he nodded, “Use your full strength. No need to show mercy. Kill this punk. If the Heavenly Saint Country wants an explanation, I’ll take full responsibility!”

The general complied respectfully, then strode towards Huang Xiaolong.

Upon watching the turn of events, Heavenly Terror Country’s General Sun Po came out from his shock and sneered maliciously, “The Mighty God Heavenly Country’s General Hu Jin is hailed as the strongest person below high-level Sovereigns. With Hu Jin making a move, that punk’s dead for sure!”

However, just as his voice fell, Huang Xiaolong once again tapped his finger in the air. Mighty God Heavenly Country’s General Hu Jin, hailed as the strongest person under high-level Sovereigns, was reduced into a pile of gray ashes in the same way as Chen Tianhao.
