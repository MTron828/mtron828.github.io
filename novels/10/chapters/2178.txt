Chapter 2179: Arriving At The Heaven Beyond Heavens

“Let’s hope so.” The Giant Kun Ruler nodded his head and went on, “Though we have made ample preparations for the Lightning Origin Divine Tree, the 33 Heavens Race would also be prepared. There’s no harm in being a little more vigilant.”

This time, their main aim was to get the Lightning Origin Divine Tree. Other things were of secondary importance.

“By the way, I heard that the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s Battle Emperor seems to value Huang Xiaolong quite highly.” The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng thought of something and mentioned it to the Giant Kun Ruler.

The Giant Kun Ruler chuckled, unperturbed by the information, “It’s merely a Black Dragon Heavenly Country. If Battle Emperor does not know what’s good for him, I don’t mind letting him be buried in the heaven beyond heavens space.”

......

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong’s group converged with the Mighty God Ruler’s group. From there, everyone rushed towards the 33 Heavenly Gates without stopping.

Counting the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts, there were twenty-plus people in Huang Xiaolong’s group. All of them fit nicely on the back of the golden pig, and it was not at all crowded.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong was not idle at all. He closed his eyes to comprehend his dao and the universe’s profound esoterics.

With the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler helping to control the Golden Pig Treasure, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about any issue.

Their journey progressed smoothly.

Several days later, as they got closer to the 33 Heavenly Gates, other Heavens Path’s experts became a common sight.

Clearly, these Heavens Path’s experts had also received news that the 33 Heavenly Gates’ restrictions were weakening, and they too were rushing over.

These experts showed surprise when they saw the Golden Pig Treasure. They really had not seen anyone using a pig as a flying artifact until today.

However, when these experts saw the faces of Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler, they avoided the golden pig in a panic, hiding as far away as they could.

Then again, only some people recognized the two rulers.

“Look at that golden pig! So funny! I’ve seen all kinds of flying mounts and flying ships, but I have never seen anyone using a pig as a flying artifact!”

A young woman about seventeen to eighteen years old said as she pointed at the golden pig Huang Xiaolong’s group was sitting on. She giggled loudly and said again, “It’s so funny!”

There were more than ten female disciples accompanying the young woman. All of them were uniformly clad in pure white brocade robes and each held identical black longswords in their hands.

“Miss, the other side seems to be the Heavenly Saint Ruler, Mighty God Ruler, and their people.” A female attendant behind the young woman spoke.

“Oh, the Heavenly Saint Country? Mighty God Heavenly Country?” The young woman was only a little surprised, then resumed giggling, “The Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country’s people are actually riding on a pig? So comedic!”

Despite knowing that the two of the people on the golden pig were the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler, the young woman continued taking jabs at them. Obviously, she did not put the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country in her eyes.

There was a flicker of surprise in the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s and Mighty God Ruler’s eyes as their gazes swept over the group of women.

“Lord, it looks like these people are from the Sword Race.” The Heavenly Saint Ruler reported to Huang Xiaolong through voice transmission.

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and looked at the young woman.

In the Heavens Path, other than the many heavenly countries, there were also many ancient races. The 33 Heavens Race was one of the ancient races, and the 33 Heavens Race was the leader among the ancient races. Whereas the Sword Race, was the second most powerful ancient race after the 33 Heavens Race.

The Sword Race’s strength couldn’t be compared to the 33 Heavens Race, but they were not that far below either.

It was said that the disciples born to the Sword Race possessed innate sword-bone and the heart of sword! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Every disciple of the Sword Race was a sword expert.

While Huang Xiaolong was scrutinizing the young woman, the young woman was also scrutinizing him. However, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze displeased the young woman. Huang Xiaolong’s gaze seemed to see through everything about her.

She pointed at Huang Xiaolong and fumed, “Hey, you, you, you, who are you? If you dare to stare at me like that, I will dig out your eyeballs.”

Truly tyrannical.

Huang Xiaolong laughed hearing her words, “What? Because you’re born ugly, you don’t allow others to look at you?”

The young woman trembled in anger at Huang Xiaolong’s retort. She was the Sword Race’s most beautiful young woman, an absolute great beauty wooed by the majority male disciples of the Sword Race. No one had the guts to call her ugly.

“You—take one sword from me!” The young woman slashed out with her longsword. Sword qi roiled forward like tidal waves, sweeping away the surrounding turbulent chaos qi, straight at Huang Xiaolong.

The startling sword qi would make the average high-level Sovereign Realm expert think twice before facing the attack head-on. Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong lightly flicked his fingers and easily scattered the frightening sword qi.

“You probably haven’t eaten, right? Your power too weak that even your sword qi is squishy soft.” Huang Xiaolong commented.

The young woman was so infuriated that her face turned green.

“Form the Aye Sword Array!” She barked an order and got into position in a flicker. The female attendants with her also moved into positions. With the young woman as the core, the sword array was completed in less than a second.

All the young women swung the longswords in their hands in sync. Sword qi soared high, emitting glaring rays of light.

Next, the young woman once again slashed her sword at Huang Xiaolong.

The young woman turned into a longsword. Between heaven and earth, there was only the light from the sword.

The Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts were unnerved seeing this shocking sword qi.

The Aye Sword Array was one of the Sword Race’s most powerful sword arrays. There were rumors that even the 33 Heavens Race’s Patriarch was apprehensive of this sword array.

However, right when the streak of sword qi was about to fall on Huang Xiaolong, he raised two fingers and turned them. The glaring sword qi vanished in an instant, revealing the young woman’s figure.

At this moment, the young woman looked flustered. She had killed many sky beasts and experts with the Aye Sword Array. Even amongst the older generation experts, not many of them could have withstood it. Who would have known that this young man could do it!?

Huang Xiaolong turned his fingers again, and the young woman’s longsword broke into several pieces. At the same time, the young woman was struck with heavy impact, and she was sent flying back.

“MISS!” The female attendants cried out anxiously and rushed to her side.

“Aye Sword Array, your reputation precedes you.” Huang Xiaolong stated in an indifferent voice.

The young woman opened her mouth to retort, but ‘pufft’ she vomited a mouthful of blood instead. Only she knew if she vomited from her injuries or because she was enraged by Huang Xiaolong.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler, then closed his eyes and entered cultivation state.

Both of them complied respectfully, and controlled the Golden Pig Treasure, speeding away happily.

“Chase them!” The young woman screamed as she watched Huang Xiaolong’s leave. However, the female attendants behind her hesitated.

“Miss, it’s not good to provoke that person. Let’s just forget it.” A female attendant advised. “Recently, a dazzling genius called Huang Xiaolong appeared in the Heavens Path. Even the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng is not this person’s opponent. On top of that, the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler recognized him as Lord. That Huang Xiaolong is likely to be that young man!”

“What?!” The young woman was shocked. She had been in seclusion to cultivate her sword techniques until recently. Furthermore, she had never been concerned with things going on outside. Therefore, she really does not know the storms Huang Xiaolong had stirred in the Heavens Path.

Although she wasn’t concerned with the outside matters, she still knew who the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng was.

“Even the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng was defeated by that Huang Xiaolong?” The young woman exclaimed, “It’s not a false rumour?!”

“It’s probably not a false rumor, and this matter has already spread all over Heavens Path. All the super heavenly countries have learned about this.” The female attendant added.

The young woman glared in the direction Huang Xiaolong had left. Even though she was unwilling to give up, she hesitated to chase after them.

Another ten days went by.

After rushing for almost half a month, Huang Xiaolong finally saw the legendary heaven beyond heavens.

Amidst the turbulent chaos qi up ahead, was a boundless independent space, completely enshrouded by lightning. Streaks of lightning were sizzling across space like ancient fierce beasts. The terrifying destructive power was enough to make anyone turn around and leave.

There was already a crowd of experts waiting to enter one thousand miles from the heaven beyond heavens space. At a quick glance, Huang Xiaolong spotted the heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng.
