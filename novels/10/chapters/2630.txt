Chapter 2631: Finally Transforming

As Chan Wuwo spread his Golden Buddha Body to its limit, he exclaimed haughtily, ”Huang Xiaolong, no one under the Primal Ancestor Realm has been able to break my Golden Buddha Body! Once my ancestor arrives, you’ll be dead!”

The memory of his beloved woman withering before his eyes made his blood boil. Hatred welled up in his heart, and his desire to kill Huang Xiaolong only grew stronger.

Completely unfazed by the threat, Huang Xiaolong sent a punch flying towards Chan Wuwo’s chest, and popping sounds could be heard as Chan Wuwo’s body started to give way.

In an instant, Huang Xiaolong destroyed the Golden Buddha Body Chan Wuwo was so proud of. Even though Chan Wuwo’s body was by no means weak, Huang Xiaolong’s fist emerged from his back as a gory hole was blown right through him.

Chan Wuwo stared at the wound in silence, and he slowly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

At the same time, the experts of the Golden Buddha Race felt a bomb going off in their heads.

Casually glancing at them all, Huang Xiaolong muttered in Chan Wuwo’s ear, “Even if your ancestor arrives, there is no way in hell he’ll be able to save you.”

“You are not a Primal Ancestor! There is no way you can break through my Golden Buddha Body!” Chan Wuwo wailed. He was still stuck in a state of shock, and he couldn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong had shattered the defense he was so proud of. Moreover, the other party had done it with a single punch!

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “You overestimate yourself. Nothing is absolute in the world. Even though you have never heard of them, some things exist.” After the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong started to devour the man.

Chan Wuwo shrivelled up instantly like a deflated balloon.

“Young Patriarch!”

“Young Master Chan Wuwo!”

The experts of the Golden Buddha Race shrieked in terror, and they rushed at Huang Xiaolong without much thought for their lives. They unleashed everything they had on him.

“Huang Xiaolong, release Young Master Chan Wuwo right now! He is a Mansion Master Candidate, and if you kill him, even Long Shengtian wouldn’t be able to protect you!” Several disciples of the Golden Buddha Race yelled.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t daunted at all, and he stared at them impassively. He allowed them to attack him however they wished as he focused on devouring Chan Wuwo.

No matter how hard they tried, Huang Xiaolong didn’t budge.

Feitian Longpeng and the experts of the Flying Heaven Race were shocked when they saw what was going on. They couldn’t believe the scene before them, where a Third Heaven True Saint was taking on the attacks of several hundred experts without so much as flinching!

Those attacking him were high-level True Saints, and there were some at the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm! Yet, with so many experts attacking him in unison, he was able to remain unfazed!

A miraculous scene played out as they looked like tiny little ants trying to shake a tree.

No… They weren’t trying to shake any ordinary tree, but they were trying to shake the gigantic tree that was Huang Xiaolong!

Feitian Longpeng and the experts of the Flying Heaven Race were so shocked that they forgot to assist him!

In fact, there was no need for them to help as they would be troubling Huang Xiaolong to take care of them.

When Huang Xiaolong had devoured the last of Chan Wuwo’s complete dao saint godhead, he threw the man’s holy soul into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

As expected, Chan Wuwo didn’t disappoint him. Huang Xiaolong felt the change in his godheads as soon as he was done with the devouring process. Brilliant rays of light started to emerge from all three godheads and Huang Xiaolong felt that they were growing stronger by the second!

This feeling was stronger and more invigorating than the previous time, and he realized that there was one last thing he needed.

Nourishment!

His godheads needed more energy in order to complete their transformation!

Turning to look at the ‘ants’, who were attacking him relentlessly, a frightening gaze formed in his eyes. The experts of the Golden Buddha Race stopped dead in their tracks when they noticed the weird look in his eyes.

“There’s no need to be afraid! Our ancestor will be here soon! As long as we stall him out, we’ll be able to save the young master!” someone in the crowd screamed.

“Attack with full force!”

“Attack Huang Xiaolong!”

The experts of the Golden Buddha Race charged at Huang Xiaolong with no regards for their lives.

Feitian Longpeng and the others were about to join in the fray, but Huang Xiaolong was even faster. Every time his figure flickered, an expert from the Golden Buddha Race would turn into a dried-up corpse.

One, two, three…

They were like heaps of straw going through the harvesting machine that was Huang Xiaolong.

In an instant, only half of the experts from the Golden Buddha Race remained.

Initially, they had thought that their ancestor, Chan Yuli, would be arriving soon to assist them. That was the reason they were fearless when confronting Huang Xiaolong! They had felt that they could stall Huang Xiaolong for half an hour, but more than half of them were slain in a minute! Fear gripped the hearts of those present and panic finally started to set in.

Eventually, one of them failed to suppress their inner demons and started to make their escape.

There was no way Huang Xiaolong would allow them to escape, now that he was about to break through. Finally, his complete dao saint godheads would enter the top ten ranks!

There was no way for him to hold himself back.

Those who were trying to escape desperately were devoured one after another as he increased his speed once more.

When there were only ten of them left, rays of resplendent light emerged from all three godheads and Huang Xiaolong knew that the time for evolution was upon him!

In the blink of an eye, he devoured the last of them. As soon as he was done, three pillars of light shot up into the skies and erupted like a volcano that had been dormant for billions of years! An astonishing power coursed through his godheads as they started to transform. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The light they emitted started to change, and the transformation process started.

As an indescribable comfort coursed through Huang Xiaolong’s veins, he felt an amazing feeling spreading through his body. He kept a straight face as he didn’t wish to embarrass himself in front of the experts of the Flying Heaven Race.

Nevertheless, Feitian Longpeng and the others stared at him in utter amazement.

“What is that?!” An expert from the Flying Heaven Race stammered as he stared at rays of light enveloping Huang Xiaolong’s body.
