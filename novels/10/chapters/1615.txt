The giant resembling golden lion was also a descendent of Hell from the desolate era from the Golden Lionman race.

“We have been waiting for the new master to appear for over ten billion years.” A gruff voice sounded from the third giant figure. “But where exactly is the new master? If the new master doesn’t show up anytime soon, and if that Lu Kun happens to break through in the meantime, surpassing the Emperor Realm, he would be able to break out of Master’s soul prohibitions. I’m afraid at that time...!”

The third giant figure’s physical appearance slightly resembled an Asura, yet there were distinctive differences when compared to Hell’s Asura race. The scales covering his body were dark golden in color. Furthermore, there were three horns on his head instead of two! There was a thick golden horn growing out from the center of his forehead and the golden branded symbols on it exuded a suffocating aura.

Before the Lord of Hell had left, he had exhorted the ten of them to oversee the Netherworld King’s Organisation. Although they were loyal, due to various reasons, the Lord of Hell had left a soul prohibition in their souls. Restrained by this soul prohibition, it was impossible for them to betray the Lord of Hell.

However, if anyone from among the ten of them surpassed the Emperor Realm, then he would be able to get rid of the soul prohibitions.

And Lu Kun was the strongest among the ten of them. According to the news they had received, in the last one million years, Lu Kun had been crazily collecting numerous grandmist spiritual herbs to break through to that realm.

There was a possibility that Lu Kun was going to break through, surpassing the Emperor Realm!

Judging from Lu Kun’s increasingly close cooperations with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe in recent years, once Lu Kun surpassed the Emperor Realm, then, it was almost certain that Lu Kun would betray the Lord of Hell!

“The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Ancestor was heavily injured by the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s Ancient Heavenly Court treasure. Not only he didn’t die but his injuries have actually healed and his strength has improved over time. If Lu Kun surpasses the Emperor Realm and joins hands with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe he will betray the Lord of Hell. That would be the worst of the worst situations ah.” The last of the four giant figures sighed heavily.

His appearance resembled that of a devil but he had twelve wings behind him, wings the color of reddish-golden blood.

“I hope the new master appears faster to obtain Master’s heritage.” The Desolate Giant Tai Yue sighed.

“It’s likely Lu Kun would break through in ten thousand years, ten thousand years is too short a time. If the new master still hasn’t appeared by that time, what do we do then?” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian asked.

“We will use the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s power and begin a wide search?” The devil-like Fan Hui suggested.

“Where and how are we going to find the new master in this boundless universe?” Jin Yuan, the figure that looked like an Asura refuted. “Moreover, The Master had said before leaving that once the new master gets his hands on the Netherworld King’s Jade, he would definitely head to the Asura World in search of the heritage left behind by our Master over here.”

“En...?” Suddenly, Desolate Giant Tai Yue took out his communication talisman. Several emotions flashed visibly across his face from shocked, to amazed, to excited.

Seeing this, the other three exchanged a glance of confusion.

“Tai Yue, what is it? Could it be that Lu Kun broke through in advance of our prediction?” Wan Yutian voiced his doubt.

The remaining two people also stared fixedly at Tai Yue.

But Tai Yue laughed happily hearing that question, then handed his communication talisman to Wan Yutian and said, “Take a look and you’ll know. The message is sent by one of the senior commanders under me. He states that he received a report from one of his junior commanders who manages a small area called the Brookspring World. The Brookspring World’s branch supervisor reported to him that an Asura noble has just signed up for the Netherworld King’s Organisation assessment!”

The ten of them were the Nether King Organisation’s Ten Great Commanders, and under them were the Ten Senior Commanders. All Ten Senior Commanders were high-level Emperor Realm experts. Further down the hierarchy, below the senior commanders were Ten Junior Commanders consisting of low-level and mid-level Emperor Realm experts.

And under the Ten Junior Commanders were various branches’ supervisors.

“An Asura nobility signed up for the assessment?” Wan Yutian took the communication talisman while asking doubtfully. What was so exciting about an Asura nobility signing up for the assessment?

Subsequently, Wan Yutian’s divine sense swept over the message. His baffled expression turned to shock, amazement, and finally excitement like Tai Yue.

Seeing this, Fan Hui and Jin Yuan both were even more baffled, and almost snatched the communication talisman from Wan Yutian’s hand.

After reading the content, a shiver of excitement ran down their bodies and their eyes widened to the size of a ball.

“One thousand years bone-age!”

“Nin-Ninth Order God King Realm!”

“Above, above supreme godhead!”

“This... this... this...!”

As they had been living for several hundred million years, they had experienced ups and downs and had naturally seen their share of geniuses. Even so, they couldn’t help feeling shocked and surprised.

Naturally, they were excited because of this Asura nobility’s amazing talent.

“Scary, too scary! In this boundless universe, there is someone who was born with this level of monstrous talent?! Even our Master’s talent was not this frightening ah!” A long time later, Desolate Giant Tai Yue huffed out slowly. Astonishment, excitement, intermingled with complex emotions flickered across his face.

“This level of talent is definitely the first in the universe in the last several hundred millions years! He absolutely is!” The Demon King Fan Hui gulped loudly.

“Say, do, do you think, could he be...?!” The Asura King Jin Yuan’s voice faltered.

But Tai Yue and the other two could guess what Jin Yuan was trying to say.

The new master!

Although they were unable to determine who their future new master was going to be, all four of them were absolutely certain of one point—their new master definitely had the supreme darkness element godhead!

Only those with supreme darkness element godhead could refine their master’s Netherworld King’s Jade and inherit their master’s heritage!

Thus, for so many years, they had issued a long standing order for the subordinates below to take note of anyone with supreme godhead that appeared in the Asura World.

This was also the reason why they were so excited.

Then again, at the moment, they were only certain that this Asura noble had above supreme rank godhead, whether it was a darkness element godhead or not...

Even so, they couldn’t help being thrilled. Supreme godhead geniuses were simply too scarce. In the Asura World’s last ten billion years until now, they could count the number of supreme godhead geniuses that had appeared with the ten fingers on both hands. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Unfortunately, after so many years of waiting and observing, they had determined that the supreme godhead geniuses who had appeared so far were not the new master they had been hoping for.

“I hope this time around we won’t be disappointed!” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian said in a hopeful tone.

They had been waiting for too long for such a day.

“Wait! This genius Asura noble named Duwei reminds me of someone!” Suddenly, the Demon King Fan Hui exclaimed.

“Who?” The other three demanded.

“He’s a new rising star in the Divine World!” Fan Hui’s words stopped there.

“Huang Xiaolong!” The other three shouted in unison as they thought of the same person simultaneously!

Although Huang Xiaolong’s reputation in the Divine World had just picked up, as a genius with king of supreme godhead, he had become various super forces’ focus.

Huang Xiaolong’s performance was simply too dazzling!

“That’s right, Huang Xiaolong. His bone-age is also below one thousand years. Moreover, during the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition several years back, Huang Xiaolong’s strength was already close to high-level God King Realm. Not to mention, this Huang Xiaolong also has the Asura bloodline, and can transform into an Asura!” Fan Hui said all of this in one breath.

“He can also transform into a primordial divine dragon!” Desolate Giant Tai Yue added.

“On top of everything, I’ve heard that he went to the Grandmist Emperor Palace and the Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong sent his personal disciple Liu Rui out to meet him personally. Now, everyone is suspecting that Huang Xiaolong is the Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son!” Asura King Jin Yuan supplemented.
