Chapter 3615 – Twin Dragons of the Limitless Land

As the Glorious Celestial Empire wasn’t located too far away from the Ice Mountain, they managed to arrive in less than ten days.

Zhou Chi’s arrival naturally alerted Rong Hua.

When he came out of his palace to personally greet Zhou Chi, he was shocked to discover the presence of a black-haired youngster. Zhou Chi was acting so respectfully that Rong Hua had no idea how to react.

“Lord Zhou Chi, he…” Rong Hua couldn’t help but ask.

“This is my lord.” Zhou Chi introduced.

“Lord, this…” Rong Hua was shocked and he looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

The meaning behind Zhou Chi’s words weren’t as simple as they seemed.

When he went to the Ice Mountain in the past, he noticed that the subordinates who had submitted under Zhou Chi’s banner addressed him the same way. Now, Zhou Chi, one of the ten strongest experts of the Limitless Land with more than 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy was addressing the young man the same way!

“I am the Blue Dragon Young Master.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he noticed Rong Hua’s shock. “You didn’t hear wrong, Zhou Chi is now my subordinate.”

Huang Xiaolong no longer planned to hide the fact.

When Rong Hua heard Huang Xiaolong making the admission, his jaws dropped.

“In fact, your son has also submitted to me.” Huang Xiaolong added.

“What?!” Rong Hua exclaimed in shock.

“Zhou Chi isn’t the only one who serves me. Lin Qiankun, Chen Huanzhi, Lin Xian…” Huang Xiaolong listed out more than a dozen God of Creation Realm experts in one go.

Well, Rong Hua didn’t care much about most of them, but Rong Hua felt his heart pounding when he heard that Lin Qiankun was one of Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates.

Even though Chen Huanzhi wasn’t as strong as Zhou Chi, he was a grand marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire! If he submitted to Huang Xiaolong, that would mean that he had betrayed the Limitless Master!

Half a day later…

Rong Hua was no exception as he eventually kneeled to pledge his allegiance to Huang Xiaolong. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He didn’t have a choice in the matter. After all, Huang Xiaolong was too damn strong. He was more than capable of forcing Rong Hua into submission with the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

After Rong Hua submitted, he handed over every single universe-level spiritual vein in the Glorious Treasury. Even though it wasn’t comparable to the treasury of the Ice Mountain, there were more than twenty spiritual veins.

Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion after receiving the goods.

Now, the most important thing he had to do was to break through the 20 billion units mark!

As such, he needed as much universe spiritual qi as he could obtain! He also needed to purify the hidden dangers in his body as quickly as possible.

After cultivating for such a long time in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong discovered the importance of clearing the hidden danger in his body. The longer they remained, the worse it would be for him.

Several tens of thousands of years later…

Huang Xiaolong emerged from seclusion.

He finally broke through the 19 billion units mark and was closing in on the 19.1 billion mark.

Now, he had nearly a billion more grand cosmos energy that the Limitless Master. In the Limitless Land, Huang Xiaolong was unbeatable!

He stood above the grand palace of the Glorious Celestial Empire and he stared into the skies above.

The sun was setting and a beautiful picture was painted.

“Lord…” Zhou Chi and Rong Hua stood behind Huang Xiaolong respectfully.

“Make your arrangements.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “We’re going to the Limitless City in a few days.”

Limitless City!

Zhou Chi and Rong Hua were stunned to learn of his intentions.

To an expert in the Limitless Land, the Limitless City was the true holy land of cultivation. Even Zhou Chi and Rong Hua respected the Limitless City deep down in their hearts.

“Inform Lin Qiankun to head over with us.” Huang Xiaolong said after thinking about it for a moment.

Zhou Chi and Rong Hua bowed respectfully.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong, Zhou Chi. and Rong Hua left the Glorious Celestial Empire for the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. Lin Qiankun had been waiting for some time when they arrived, and they left for the Limitless City the moment Huang Xiaolong’s party arrived. They got on the Blue Dragon Flying Ship and the group made their way over.

“It seems like it’s time to refine the Blue Dragon Flying Ship again…” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Even though the Blue Dragon Flying Ship has already surpassed many top-grade creation artifacts, it was still far from a pseudo universe treasure.

Nothing happened along the way.

The four of them finally arrived after one whole year.

The Limitless Land was extremely large. Even an ordinary God of Creation Realm expert at the large completion stage would need several dozen years to arrive in the Limitless Celestial Empire. They were only able to arrive so quickly due to the speed of the Blue Dragon Flying Ship.

“The Limitless City is really a good place to cultivate…” Huang Xiaolong looked at the massive city before him and sighed. Zhou Chi, Rong Hua, and Lin Qiankun stood silently behind him.

Zhou Chi replied, “Lord is right. In the past, the Limitless Master chose to build the city here because of the origin qi...”

The origin qi he referred to was the source qi produced by the universe.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

There were tons of people who were entering the Limitless City and Huang Xiaolong’s group didn’t stand out. Their gazes might linger on the four for a second longer, but no one gave them a second thought. Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua were half step Universe Gods and they rarely appeared in public. There weren’t many people who could recognize them.

When they were admiring the sights, a commotion broke out in the distance. A weirdly armored troop riding on sea dragons headed straight for the city. There were several tens of thousands of them!

“It’s the Ocean Race from the Sleepless Sea!” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

There were several experts who started discussing with each other in the distance. “I heard that the Sleepless Sea is trying to patch up the relations with our Limitless Celestial Empire. The crown prince of the Sleepless Sea came on the orders of the king in order to negotiate with our Human Race.

“The crown prince of the Sleepless Sea actually came! I heard that he’s the most talented expert in the third generation of the Sleepless Sea. He entered the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm a long time ago and I wonder if he broke through to the grand completion stage…”

“Alongside His Highness, Wu Qifeng, they’re known as the twin dragons of our Limitless Land!”

Their discussions entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

As they continued to talk among themselves, the giant army arrived before the city gates. Another impressive army rode out of the city to welcome them and they were personally led by the Limitless Crown Prince, Wu Qifeng!

“Brother Ye Jing, it’s been a long time! Have you been well?” Wu Qifeng cupped his fists and a brilliant smile hung on his lips.

Ye Jing chuckled and started to exchange pleasantries with Wu Qifeng.

“My father has already prepared a banquet for all of you! Brother Ye Jing, please!” Wu Qifeng invited Ye Jing into the city after a short chat.

“Please.” Ye Jing didn’t reject the gesture of goodwill and they prepared to enter the city.

However, they stopped dead in their tracks when Wu Qifeng noticed Huang Xiaolong’s group from the corner of his eye. His gaze landed on Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua.
