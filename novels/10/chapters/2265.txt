Chapter 2266: Thought of One Possibility

A black-hearted smile flashed over Huang Xiaolong’s face upon hearing that, “I hope you would have this chance.”

Seconds later, Jiang Tian, Huang Zhouping, and the rest of the Holy Alliance disciples sped away.

Looking at the ruins on the Myriad Dragon Peak, Huang Xiaolong’s face was even gloomier.

Tomorrow!

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze was fixed on Huang Zhouping’s figure, with undisguised bloodthirst, until Jiang Tian, Huang Zhouping, and the rest were completely out of his sight. Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in the air right above the Myriad Dragon Peak and then closed his eyes to adjust his breathing as he waited for the next day to come.

Huang Xiaolong did not make any move to clear or restore the ruins and destruction on the Myriad Dragon Peak. Everything will have to wait until tomorrow’s arena battle ends.

Someone else would help him rebuild the entire Myriad Dragon Peak when it was the right time!

The sky gradually darkened. The darkness held a mysterious charm as the moon hanging in the sky softly lit it up.

Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in the air like a statute.

Under the Holy Alliance’s deliberate propagation, the news that Huang Xiaolong and Huang Zhouping’s battle would take place the following day spread through the entire Holy Gate headquarters in less than a day. The millions of Holy Gate headquarters were in an uproar.

Some disciples were worried that they would reach the arena too late and miss the battle. Hence they set off to the arena despite it being the middle of the night, hurrying there to get a good spot.

Some even used the Swift Talisman they had that they wouldn’t bear to use at other times to increase their speed.

This was the first time ever something like a battle between two Holy Princes was going to take place. Therefore, the Holy Gate disciples who were at the headquarters at this point didn’t want to miss the chance of spectating a battle of this magnitude.

The darkness of the night slowly gave way to the approaching dawn.

When the first ray of sunlight hit the land, Huang Xiaolong, who had been keeping his meditative posture, opened his eyes and stood up.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to fly towards the arena for the battle, a big flying ship appeared on the horizon in the distance. The Chief Hall Master Yang Jiangzhi stepped onto the starboard, and respectfully said, “Your Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong, allow me to take you there!”

Huang Xiaolong did not refuse as he nodded his head at Yang Jingzhi and boarded the ship.

After the flying ship picked up Huang Xiaolong, it turned into a streak of light as it flew away.

“Your Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong, you really want to battle in the arena?” Yang Jingzhi hesitated for quite a while before deciding to ask.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, and replied half-jokingly, “Can it be false then?”

Yang Jingzhi’s lips moved, wanting to persuade Huang Xiaolong further, but Huang Xiaolong spoke before him, “Chief Hall Master Yang Jingzhi, I know you are persuading me out of kindness, but I have already made my decision. So, you need not say anymore. I know that you and the rest are not optimistic about me, and you picking me up today is probably your last favor!” Then Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Still, rest assured that this won’t be the last time you see me. Let’s have a drink after I kill Huang Zhouping.”

As he saw Huang Xiaolong’s relax demeanor and his mood to still joke around with him, Yang Jingzhi inwardly shook his head.

“Sure, as long as you don’t disdain that my wine is not good.” Yang Jingzhi didn’t know how to persuade Huang Xiaolong, and said what he could.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and said, “As the Holy Gate’s Chief Hall Master, your wine can’t be worse than a new Holy Prince like me who just entered the Holy Gate, right?”

Both laughed in response.

“If Your Highness Holy Prince really returns victorious, I will take out the Fire Wind Origin Elements Wine that I have been saving for a billion years, and the two of us will drink to our hearts’ content!”

Affected by Huang Xiaolong’s positivity, Yang Jingzhi promised in a sonorous voice.

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “Then, I have to win no matter what!”

The two continued to talk and laugh as the flying ship sped onwards. One wouldn’t even know that Huang Xiaolong would be battling for his life in the arena at all.

Two hours later, the flying ship stopped in midair.

Situated on the large mountain peak before them was a glistening bronze stage in an arena. The four sides of the massive bronze stage were covered with holy runes, exuding a sacred aura, outwards, in the four directions.

This was the arena’s holy stage!

The one and only holy stage in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

Rays of brilliant holy light seemed to float out from the holy stage. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

At the very center of the holy stage was an enormous ancient word ‘battle.’ The word ‘battle’ easily roused the disciples’ blood to surge with a desire to battle.

Huang Xiaolong and Yang Jingzhi’s appearance as they flew out from the flying ship drew a strong reaction from the crowd of disciples in the arena.

“He is our Holy Gate’s new Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong?! It’s a surprise that Chief Hall Master Yang Jingzhi actually sent him over personally!”

“What new Holy Gate’s Holy Prince? After today, he’s nothing but a corpse! I think the Chief Hall Master Yang Jingzhi pities him. That’s why he gave him one last ride!”

Clear mocking words came from the crowd in the distance.

Most of these disciples who were mocking Huang Xiaolong were members of the Holy Alliance.

Huang Xiaolong was unaffected by these noises in the slightest as he whistled across the air and descended on the bronze holy stage, directly standing on the word ‘battle’ as he waited for Huang Zhouping to arrive.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong descended on the battle stage, he saw a group of people flying over at high speed from the distance consisting of Jiang Tian, Huang Zhouping, Wu Shi, Zheng Yongjia, and others.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze was fixed on Zhang Wenyue who was behind Huang Zhouping. As he saw that Zhang Wenyue was unharmed, his heart eased slightly.

Zhang Wenyue spotted Huang Xiaolong from afar, and her eyes immediately turned red with tears as she cried out, “Young Master!”

Tears rolled down her face remembering her father and brother’s tragic deaths.

As others looked at Zhang Wenyue’s distressed expression they sympathized with her, but Huang Zhouping chuckled softly, “Just watch how I am going to skin your Young Master on the stage!”

Moments later, the Holy Alliance’s group arrived at the arena. Huang Zhouping directly landed on the stage, standing opposite Huang Xiaolong.

Before long, Li Wen, Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, and the rest of the thirteen Eminent Elders arrived consecutively.

Holy Princes rarely battled on the holy stage. Thus, they, as Eminent Elders, naturally had to be present to ‘referee’ the battle.

With Li Wen and other Eminent Elders’ ‘refereeing’ the battle according to the agreed upon battle rules, Yang Jingzhi stepped forward and sealed off most of Huang Zhouping’s strength, restricting Huang Zhouping’s cultivation at the mid-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm.

Watching Huang Zhouping’s cultivation being suppressed down to mid-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm, a sly and wicked grin flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s face.

After sealing most of Huang Zhouping’s strength, Yang Jingzhi stepped off the holy stage, and after obtaining a nod of approval from Eminent Elder Li Wen, he activated the defensive formations around the holy stage.

As long as the defensive formations around the holy stage were activated, even if the half-step True Saint experts were to fight inside, the destructive energy fluctuations would not spread outwards. Moreover, once the defensive formations were activated, the people outside could no longer interfere in the battle happening inside.

“Huang Xiaolong, tell me, how do you want to die?” After the defensive formations of the stage were smoothly activated,, Huang Zhouping taunted Huang Xiaolong with a distorted expression, “I shall cripple you first, skin you, and then slowly debone your flesh, or do you want it the other way around? Should I skin and debone you before crippling and killing you?”

Huang Xiaolong made a sudden move at this moment, arriving two feet from Huang Zhouping in a flicker with his fist swinging out.

As he saw Huang Xiaolong taking the initiative to attack, a mocking smile bloomed over Huang Zhouping’s face, “Really? Don’t know how to write the word dead?!” And his fist swung out as he yelled, “Great Sun Divine Fist!”

Although the Great Sun Divine Fist was not a holy martial art, it was a divine art created by a half-True Saint expert, Eminent Elder Xu Jun.

Watching Huang Zhouping using the Great Sun Divine Fist that he had created, Xu Jun could not help nodding his head with satisfaction.

As Huang Zhouping swung his fist, a blinding light burst out from his fist like a great sun with rays that pierced through heaven and earth.

Sitting beside Jiang Tian was Holy Prince Zheng Yongjia. Seeing the situation on the stage, he leaned closer to Jiang Tian and snickered, “Junior Brother Huang Zhouping won’t end Huang Xiaolong with one punch, right?”

Other members of the Holy Alliance erupted into laughter hearing his question.

During this split second, Huang Xiaolong’s fist smashed through the bright sun and struck Huang Zhouping’s fist.

Boom!

A resounding boom came from the stage, followed by Huang Zhouping’s loud scream. His whole fist was shattered by Huang Xiaolong, and his body was knocked backward by the impact. He smashed against the defensive light barrier formed by the defensive formations of the stage.

“What?!” Everyone was dumbfounded.

Even Yang Jingzhi was stupefied at this sight.

“This is not right!”

Suddenly, Eminent Elder Xu Jun shouted in surprise, “This Huang Xiaolong has broken through to late-Ninth Order Sovereign!”

Jiang Tian and the others were taken aback by Xu Jun’s shout. In less than a year, Huang Xiaolong had actually advanced to late-Ninth Order Sovereign!

“This kid must have run into a great fortuitous adventure outside. There was no other explanation for his rigorous advancement to late-Ninth Order Sovereign in such a short time!” Holy Prince Wu Shi was beyond shock.

“It doesn’t matter even if he has advanced to late-Ninth Order Sovereign,” Jiang Tian sneered, “Just now, Junior Brother Huang Zhouping was merely careless. With Junior Brother Huang Zhouping’s talent, he can easily turn the tables and deal with that punk without any problem!”

The present Holy Alliance’s Holy Princes quickly nodded their heads in agreement. Whether it was Huang Zhouping’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, or saint physique, they were much higher ranking than Huang Xiaolong’s. Thus, even if Huang Xiaolong had advanced to late-Ninth Order Sovereign, in the Holy Alliance members’ opinions, Huang Xiaolong was absolutely not Huang Zhouping’s opponent.

At this time, under everyone’s intent focus, Huang Zhouping got up from the floor. A light rippled around his right hand, and his injuries from that collision healed immediately. He wiped the blood off his mouth, and his eyes burned with raging murder. “A rubbish like you has the guts to injure me, in-jure me?!”

Huang Zhouping pushed the power from his Mammoth Force Saint Godhead with a frenzy. At the same time, a layer of glowing and flowing substance appeared on the surface of his body, moving like live magma. This was the defense method of Huang Zhouping’s saint bloodline.

Being injured by a rubbish like Huang Xiaolong was the ultimate insult in Huang Zhouping’s eyes. Thus, he decided to go all out.

“Die—!”

“Saint Dao, Divine Mammoth Force!” Huang Zhouping bellowed as his fists punched out. Overwhelming fist force roiled forward, turning into a stampeding herd of ancient mammoths, each with heaven-destroying power.

Upon seeing that Huang Zhouping’s fists were close to hitting Huang Xiaolong, a domineering dragon might suddenly surged out from Huang Xiaolong’s body as he spurred the complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline that were tested out previously.

The air around Huang Xiaolong became turbulent, forming a sea of divine dragons. Simultaneously, a layer of golden dragon scales covered the surface of his body.

Eminent Elder Li Wen, Sun Shangyi, Bai Xuyang, and the others who had been watching quietly now looked shocked and astounded.

“This, this definitely is not the Mysterious Dragon Saint Godhead! Absolutely not the Mad Dragon Saint Bloodline, or the True Dragon Saint Physique!” Sun Shangyi stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong as the words rushed out from his lips.

Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, Li Yuhui, and Gong Chen were also taken aback by the changes on Huang Xiaolong’s body. Didn’t they say that during Huang Xiaolong’s second test result, his complete dao saint godhead ranked at 4,382nd place, and it was the Mysterious Dragon Saint Godhead?

But it was impossible for the Mysterious Dragon Saint Godhead to exude this powerful dragon might!

The Mad Dragon Saint Bloodline and True Dragon Saint Physique could not possess such auras!

The majesty shown by Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique had completely suppressed Huang Zhouping!

Was there a mistake in the second test results?

Despite their shock, Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, and the others did not dwell too much into the root of Huang Xiaolong’s overwhelming momentum, but Li Wen, as the head of the thirteen Eminent Elders, thought of one extremely rare possibility!

... Could it be?!

When this possibility crossed his mind, his body shuddered with excitement, and he couldn’t get a full sentence out.
