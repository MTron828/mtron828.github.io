On the next day, Gao Changran, Wang Fanning, and the others sent Huang Xiaolong off respectfully. Huang Xiaolong brought Lu Xiaoqing with him as he made his way to the registration grounds.

The location for them to register wasn’t too far from his manor, and within an hour, Huang Xiaolong appeared at the plaza where the registration was taking place.

The number of people there was insane, and it was so crowded that even a drop of water would fail to trickle through.

The number of people signing up exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s expectations.

From what Lu Xiaoqing had said the day before, Huang Xiaolong felt that there would probably only be several hundred thousand people signing up.

From the looks of things, there were way more than several hundred thousand people signing up.

Lu Xiaoqing was shocked as well. It was clear that the number of people had already exceeded her expectations.

Huang Xiaolong said, “It looks like there are more people than we expected due to the attraction of the Glaze Devil Stele.”

Because of the Glaze Devil Stele, all the experts from the thirty-six cities and nine empires had gathered in the Heaven Devouring Empire. It wasn’t a stretch to think that the number of people interested in the opening of the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range would increase.

Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing walked into the square.

When they finally squeezed their way through the crowd, they appeared at the reception hall’s entrance.

Several guards were standing before the reception hall’s entrance, and it was clear from one glance that they weren’t from the Thousand Constellation Country.

Many participants were stopped outside the entrance by these guards.

Even though rage was burning in their hearts, none of them dared to show it on their faces.

“They’re from the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire.” Lu Xiaoqing whispered to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and continued walking towards the hall with Lu Xiaoqing.

Before they could enter, the guards from the Fire Lightning Violet Python Empire stopped them.

“Stop right there! Prince Huo Liucheng and Princess Zhao Rou are registering right now. You can only enter after they complete their registration.” One of the guards explained with an expressionless face.

Huo Liucheng?

A sneer appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. It seemed like he was Huo Liuyun’s brother.

“Princess Zhao Rou?!” Lu Xiaoqing exclaimed in shock.

Huang Xiaolong snapped back to attention and turned to look at her.

Could it be that the person she had called out came from an influential background?

Lu Xiaoqing turned and explained to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, Princess Zhao Rou is the daughter of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor! She’s one of the beauties of the Kingdom of Devil Beast. Her beauty is only said to be second to Hu Qianmei. Her talent shakes the world, and the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor dotes on her. There are even rumors going around that he plans on taking her in as his successor.

Huang Xiaolong was a little shocked.

He had never thought that Zhao Rou would be the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor’s successor.

The Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor was regarded as the number one expert in the Kingdom of Devil Beast.

In the past few days, Shi Ming, Chu Han, Feng Chu, and the others had run into with the members of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire. There were even some people spreading rumors about Shi Ming battling the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor!

Even though no one knew about the results of their battle, Shi Ming, Chu Han, and the others had taken a step back. From this, one could only imagine the strength the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor, Zhao Yuan, possessed.

Since he planned on taking Zhao Rou in as his successor, it was clear that she possessed an extraordinary talent.

Without heaven shaking talent, it would be impossible for her to succeed in his position!

“Brat, now that you know that our prince and princess are in the hall, why are you still standing here? If you block their way, even the heavens won’t be able to save you.” The guard snapped at Huang Xiaolong when he saw that Huang Xiaolong was standing at the entrance like a wooden block.

“You!” Lu Xiaoqing felt anger boiling in her heart when she saw how the guard spoke to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to stop her.

However, an expert at the Emperor Realm seemed to have heard the commotion in the hall, and he appeared behind the guards.

When the guards saw him, they bowed and greeted, “General Qin Shiyu.”

“What’s going on?” Qin Shiyu’s face was as expressionless as a block when he replied.

“These two people are trying to enter the hall. We are currently trying to get rid of them.” One of the guards hastily explained himself.

Qin Shiyu raised his head and stared at Huang Xiaolong. He became a little impatient as he snapped, “Why are you wasting your breath on him? The prince and princess will be leaving soon. Get rid of all the trash in their way. If they refuse to move, just cripple them and kick them away. Do I have to personally appear to teach you how to do things?”

“If you can’t even settle such small matters, you no longer need to be the captain of the guards.”

When the guard captain heard what he said, the blood drained from his face. He panicked. “General Qin is right! This subordinate is at fault! I will get rid of them right now!”

As soon as he spoke, he reached out his hand to smash Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the guard captain’s move, he didn’t react. Instead, a frosty expression appeared on his face.

Before the guard captain’s arm could touch Huang Xiaolong’s robes, a horrifying black light emerged.

Bang!

The black light sent the guard captain flying, and the entrance of the hall was smashed to bits. He didn’t stop there, and he continued to smash into the interior of the hall. He spat mouthfuls of blood without stop, and he dyed the ground around him red.

“What?!”

Everyone felt their jaws dropping to the ground in shock. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Everyone was surprised that the guard captain could not take a single hit from a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch! However, they were even more shocked that Huang Xiaolong had dared to make a move on the guard captain.

Even Qin Shiyu widened his eyes in shock.

However, his expression froze, and his face turned dark. Dense killing intent burst out from his eyes. Before he could make a move, a group of people emerged from the hall. The whole group was led by the ‘prince’ and ‘princess.’

The prince was handsome, and the aura around him was dignified. As for the princess, she possessed soul shaking beauty.

Of course, they were Huo Liucheng and Zhao Rou.

When Huang Xiaolong laid eyes on Zhao Rou, he had to admit that she was extremely pretty. Compared to the charming and seductive Hu Qianmei, Zhao Rou exuded an aura of heroism. There was a tender side of her that caused people’s hearts to melt when they looked at her. Her crystal clear, blue eyes were exceptionally unforgettable.

Huo Liucheng stood half a step behind her, and he seemed to be trying to get close to her.

As soon as they emerged, Huo Liucheng’s gaze landed on the guard captain’s body. A frown formed on his face as he slowly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“Did you injure my guard captain?”

Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless as he admitted. “That’s right.”

“Why?”

What did he mean by why?

“Looking at how you put on airs, no one would have thought that you had sh*t for brains.”

Pig for brains?!

Everyone felt a bomb going off in their mind.

“Puchi.” Zhao Rou couldn’t help but giggle. Her eyes turned into crescents, and when the disciples from the other empires looked at her, they swallowed mouthfuls of saliva.

Huo Liucheng was shocked as well, but his expression was a stark contrast to those of the disciples around him. His expression twisted, and he sucked in a long breath before speaking to Qin Shiyu beside him. “I’ll hand him over to you. Bring him back to the manor later. Do not kill him.” After giving his order, he turned to Zhao Rou and said, “Princess Zhao Rou, allow me to send you back to your place.”
