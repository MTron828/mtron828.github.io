Chapter 3647 – You Can’t Owe Me A Single Cent

At his current cultivation level, Huang Xiaolong gained complete control over the Star Dragon Divine Tree. It became nothing more than an extension of his limbs. Moreover, there was no one in the city who detected its presence. At Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation level, not even Jian Wushuang would be able to notice something Huang Xiaolong didn’t allow him to!

“Your Highness, I have some foundations in the Unparalleled City. Would you like to rest there for the night?” Zhu Fei asked.

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The group quickly followed Zhu Fei and they approached the Zhu Family’s property in the Unparalleled City. It was called the Zhu Family Tea House, and they specialized in selling all sorts of tea. Their business was booming and they had so much money they managed to extend their hands to many industries in the Zhu Lan Lands. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When Huang Xiaolong and the rest entered, the entire hall was filled to the brim.

“Looks like your business isn’t bad!” Huang Xiaolong joked.

Zhu Fei scratched his head and smiled, “I’m just messing around to keep my family alive… Please don’t mind us, Your Highness…”

Laughter filled the air as Zhu Fei invited them into the inner courtyard.

Leaving the main hall, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the courtyard and rooms within were extremely elegant and quiet. It formed a stark contrast with the scene outside.

“It’s a nice place.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Alright. Go ahead and take a break. The ceremony will be held tomorrow. We’ll head there then.”

Zhu Fei and the others acknowledged his order. However, a disturbance occurred before they could leave. A loud cry came from the main hall.

From the looks of it, someone was attacked in the Zhu Family Tea House!

“Let’s go take a look.” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Your Highness, it’s alright. There’s no need to trouble you for this. I shall head out alone.”

“It’s fine. We have nothing to do anyway.” Huang Xiaolong spoke as he headed towards the main hall.

As soon as they arrived, they saw a few disciples of the Jian Family surrounding a fallen disciple of the Zhu Family. There was a giant dent in the Zhu Family disciple’s chest, and everyone could see that the man was crippled.

“What’s going on?” Zhu Fei summoned the manager of the shop and his expression sank.

The manager was a grand elder of the Zhu Family, and he was an expert at the Dao Venerable Realm who had comprehened twelve elements to the grand completion stage. He knew who Zhu Fei was, and he replied respectfully, “Old Ancestor, the grand elders of the Jian Clan have always bought stuff from us. They never paid, and they said to keep it on their tab. As of now, they owe us more than ten billion dao coins! They’re here to buy more tea leaves and the sum of their purchase this time is close to that amount! Even so, they don’t plan on paying.”

“The disciple requested for them to settle their bill and the disciples of the Jian Family crippled him!”

One of the Jian Family’s grand elders sneered as he stared down at the fallen disciple. “Our old ancestor broke through the 20 billion units barrier and we’re holding a celebration ceremony tomorrow. It’s your Zhu Family's honor to be supplying the tea leaves we require. How dare you ask us to pay? Do you believe that I’ll demolish your Zhu Family Tea House right here and now?!”

“What about the amount you already owe us?” The disciple gasped in pain.

“Owe you? Since when do we owe you money?” The grand elder sneered.

It was clear that he didn’t plan to pay.

Another one of the grand elders stared at the disciple and snorted in contempt. “How dare you attempt to scam our Jian Family?! You must be tired of living!” A sword appeared in his hand as he hacked downwards. A flash of light filled the hall as he planned to cut the disciple in two. With the injuries the disciple already suffered, he wouldn’t be able to avoid the strike!

Just as the sword light was about to cleave the disciple in two, another flash of light appeared and the grand elder’s body froze up.

A tiny hole could be seen in the middle of his forehead, and all signs of life drained from his body!

Without a doubt, he was dead!

Not even his dao soul managed to escape.

The members of the Jian Family looked at their dead grand elder in shock.

When everyone turned to the source of the interference, they saw Huang Xiaolong’s group. Of course, Huang Xiaolong was just standing there. The person who moved was Zhu Fei.

The other grand elders of the Jian Family had no idea Zhu Fei was and they raged, “How dare you kill a grand elder of our Jian Family?! You’re dead! Your entire Zhu Family is dead!”

Zhu Fei didn’t speak. Instead, Huang Xiaolong muttered softly as he looked at the body collapsing to the ground. “Tell the members of your Jian Family to come over to pay your debts. You can leave after you pay, otherwise, no one is leaving today.”

Those in the main hall stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“Who is he?! Is he really planning to kill everyone from the Jian Family if they don’t pay up?”

“He’s crazy! The Jian Family’s ceremony will be held tomorrow, and he killed a grand elder of the Jian Family in the Unparalleled City right under their noses!”

One of the grand elders of the Jian Family couldn’t contain his anger anymore and he snorted at Huang Xiaolong, “Heh, do you really plan on killing all of us if we refuse to bring the money over?”

Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Didn’t you hear what I said? I won’t dirty my hands with you ants. Someone else will kill you.”

“Hmph! My ancestor is Eminent Elder Jian Dalong of the Jian Family! Let’s see if you dare to stop me from leaving?” The grand elder who spoke earlier snapped.

The spectators in the main hall gasped in fright.

“Jian Dalong! He’s a God of Creation at the grand completion stage!”

When they were still discussing the grand elder’s ancestor, he had already taken a step towards the entrance.

Right before he could leave, a ray of light shot past his figure and his head was flung through the air. His body crumpled slowly towards the entrance.

The rest of the grand elders of the Jian Family froze in place when they saw what happened.

The experts in the hall stared at Zhu Fei in shock.

Was he crazy?!

He actually dared to make a move on them!

The person he killed was the grandson of an eminent elder from the Jian Family! Moreover, the eminent elder was an existence at the peak of the grand completion stage!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the stares of surprise and his voice rang through the hall again. “You can notify them to bring the money now. Bring a coffin for him too. Anyway, remember to bring enough money. You can’t owe me a single cent!”
