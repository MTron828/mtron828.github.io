Chapter 3554 – Kai Dong’s Strength

“What?!” The experts of the Creation Palace were shocked.

“Do you think that Huang Xiaolong…” Someone asked.

A light flashed in Kai Dong’s eyes. He muttered softly, “We cannot be sure if Huang Xiaolong had anything to do with this. The only thing we know is that Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu ran into trouble.”

The experts from the Creation Palace looked at each other doubtfully.

“Is that really possible? Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu are Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage! Those they brought along are in the grand completion stage at the very least, and there are more than twenty of them! Even if the Star Dragon Couple launched a surprise attack, some of them would be able to get away!”

Kai Dong was similarly confused, but he tried to suppress his shock the best he could.

Even if he were to catch Ao Wanshan and the others by surprise, he wouldn’t be able to wipe them out with a trace!

“Did Chen Yizhen, Lin Tong, and the entire Eternal Heaven Alliance lay down a trap for them?” Someone guessed.

“There are no other explanations!”

“Experts from the Eternal Heaven Alliance? Did Tao Shi lie to us?!”

The experts from the Creation Palace started to throw random guesses around.

A frosty light flashed through Kai Dong’s eyes and he growled, “Tao Shi!”

Evidently, he was slowly leaning towards Tao Shi’s betrayal. After all, the Eternal Heaven Alliance and the Creation Palace had never been on good terms. It was very likely for them to set a trap on such a large scale in order to eradicate a huge part of the other side’s strength.

Even though that was the case, a trace of doubt remained in Kai Dong’s mind. He didn’t think that the Eternal Heaven Alliance was crazy enough to wage war on the Creation Palace!

“Palace Master, should we leave?”

Kai Dong hesitated for a second before muttering uncertainty, “Alright.”

He felt that something was extremely off with the space they were in and decided to pull back to Kun Feng’s side before deciding on their next course of action.

A cold sneer rang through the skies before they could escape. “Since you’re already here, don’t bother leaving!”

Kai Dong and the experts of the Creation Palace turned to stare at the source of the voice, and a figure descended from the void.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Kai Dong swept his gaze across the surrounding space like Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu when they first met him.

“You were right. Tao Shi baited all of you over. The experts of my Eternal Heaven Alliance are hiding in ambush all around you!” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

“Indeed!” One of the experts from the Creation Palace raged. All of them crushed their transmission symbol to alert Kun Feng about Tao Shi’s act of betrayal.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with them and he activated the grand formation he laid down earlier. A screen of light appeared to trap Kai Dong and the rest.

He was obviously messing with Kai Dong. He wanted them to alert Kun Feng in hopes of misleading the members of the Creation Palace. When that happened, Kai Dong’s disappearance would be linked to the Eternal Heaven Alliance!

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong might look like they were siding with Huang Xiaolong, but he was sure that they were working against him in the dark. After all, they sent him to the Solitary Alliance alone to attend the ceremony. They were clearly giving the Creation Palace a chance to deal with him!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be more certain of Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong’s intentions. When the Creation Palace killed him, the Star Dragon Couple, Pangu, and the others would definitely go crazy to take revenge. When they killed their way into the Creation Palace and suffered serious losses, Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong would take the chance to kill everyone, turning into the biggest fishermen in the First Universe!

Since they placed him in the same group as Tao Shi, it showed how deep their plot went. As leaders of the Eternal Heaven Alliance, they would be utter failures if they couldn’t tell the grudge between the two! They were planning to use Tao Shi to get rid of Huang Xiaolong once and for all!

They started it, and Huang Xiaolong simply returned the favor.

Slowly approaching the experts of the Creation Palace, a grin formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Kai Dong’s cautious expression turned into one of confusion. Huang Xiaolong was clearly the only person in the grand formation! There was no ambush to speak of!

“You did that on purpose!” Kai Dong growled all of a sudden.

The experts of the Creation Palace stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“Yup.” Huang Xiaolong nodded nonchalantly.

“What’s the point of doing that?” Kai Dong frowned. He had no idea what Huang Xiaolong was planning.

Even if they were set up, all they had to do was to shatter the formation and escape. The false information Huang Xiaolong wanted Kun Feng to learn would turn useless the moment they escaped.

“Do you really think that I only possess 3.7 billion units of grand cosmos energy?” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“You… Are you not at the large completion stage?! Are you a half step Universe God like me?!” Kai Dong gasped.

“No. I’m most definitely at the large completion stage.”

“Huang Xiaolong, stop with your bullsh*t!” Someone from the Creation Palace snapped. “I’ll cripple you right now!”

As soon as he spoke, a punch flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Even with the grand formation operating at full power, purple lightning bolts exploded under the power of the strike.

Huang Xiaolong released his grand cosmos energy completely and returned the attack with a punch of his own.

Boom!

When their blows landed, the expert from the Creation Palace felt his hand shattering into pieces. The might of an existence who surpassed the half step Universe God level crashed directly into him.

He crashed into the barrier of light and he felt every single organ in his body shattering into countless pieces.

Kai Dong and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong with their eyes wide. They couldn’t conceal the shock in their hearts. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You!” Kai Dong roared. He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds!

Strolling casually towards Kai Dong and the rest, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I’ll give you a chance. If you choose to submit to me, I’ll let this go.”

A snort left Kai Dong’s lips. “Huang Xiaolong, so what if you have three great worlds? Even with more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, I’m a half step Universe God. Do you really think that you can trap me here?! Haha, my strength isn’t something you can imagine!”

Instead of retreating, he took the initiative to approach Huang Xiaolong. “Now, I’ll show you the difference between a God of Creation at the large completion stage and a half step Universe God!” Releasing his arua, the grand formation trembled incessantly. It seemed to be ready to break apart at any moment.

Kai Dong grabbed at the void before him, and Huang Xiaolong felt as though the universe was bending to Kai Dong’s will.
