Chapter 3547: You Don’t Have To Return

 

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard what they said. It seemed as though they thought that he had all the universe-level spiritual veins on him. No one would believe him if he said that he had refined them all in the time he spent in seclusion.

If he took several hundreds of millions of years, it might be a little more believable.

“What are you smiling at?” the God of Creation at the grand completion stage growled in response.

“I no longer have any universe-level spiritual veins on me. However, I do have hundreds of Star Dragon Scales left.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “If you’re strong enough to take it away when the time comes, feel free to do so.”

“Hundreds… Hundreds of them!” Duan Jun and the others yelled in fright. Even Jiang Shaoyu was taken aback when she heard his claim.

It was simply unbelievable! A single Star Dragon Scale was worth quite a number of universe-level spiritual veins. If he had hundreds of them, wouldn’t he be able to trade them for thousands of universe-level spiritual veins?

This…

Huang Xiaolong released the restrictions on his Sun Moon Furnace as he dazzled them with the Star Dragon Scales.

They might have been shocked previously, but the visual impact struck them like a truck!

Jiang Shaoyu counted a total of five hundred and forty-eight pieces of scales in the Sun Moon Furnace and an audible gasp left her lips.

The experts of the Creation Palace were at a loss for words.

Keeping the Sun Moon Furnace away, Huang Xiaolong pulled them back to reality.

“Let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Jiang Shaoyu who had barely regained her senses.

Duan Jun wanted to stop Huang Xiaolong from leaving, but one of the experts beside him shook his head silently. He didn’t wish for Duan Jun to make a rash move.

They could only watch as Huang Xiaolong left with Jiang Shaoyu.

“Lord Yang Gang, are we really allowing him to leave?!” Duan Jun complained after Huang Xiaolong was nowhere to be seen. “He has more than five hundred Star Dragon Scales on him!” 

Even if they had to offend the Solitary Alliance, it was a worthy price to pay! 

Yang Gang shook his head slowly and muttered, “We might not be able to snatch it if we make a move. The experts of the Solitary Alliance are all around!” 

Staring in the direction where Huang Xiaolong left, a sneer left Yang Gang’s lips. “Humph. He won’t be able to get away regardless. We can afford to wait. The Star Dragon Scales on him belong to our Creation Palace! No one will be able to steal from us! No one is to leak the news. We cannot allow any other party to learn about the Star Dragon Scales!”

“Why did he show us the Star Dragon Scales?” someone else asked. “What is he plotting this time?!”

“There’s something fishy about this brat…” Yang Gang nodded. Doubts filled his mind as he continued, “He definitely came alone…” 

He had no idea why Huang Xiaolong was cocky enough to show off his treasures to the members of the Creation Palace.

…

Jiang Shaoyu personally arranged for Huang Xiaolong’s residence.

“You shouldn’t have shown them your treasures!” Jiang Shaoyu snapped at Huang Xiaolong. “Now, they will never let you off!” 

With a nonchalant smile on his face, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “They wouldn’t let me off regardless.”

Jiang Shaoyu stared at him without uttering a word.

“Are you really so worried about me?” Huang Xiaolong joked.

Snorting softly, Jiang Shaoyu’s face flushed red as she looked into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Why would I be worried about you? If you didn’t save me in the past, I wouldn’t bother taking another look at you! Humph! I was only giving you a suggestion!” 

Before waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s response, she ran out of his palace while biting her lips.

Since the ceremony would be taking place several days later, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother going out as he comprehended the mysteries of the universe in the mysterious scale.

The alliance master of the Solitary Alliance visited him once in order to thank him for saving Jiang Shaoyu, and he even brought several gifts.

He brought a pair of high-grade universe-level spiritual veins, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t reject them no matter how hard he tried. He could only accept them reluctantly.

There were also experts of other factions paying Huang Xiaolong a visit now and then.

Most of them were from the Hundred Empire Alliance, and they were the fourth strongest power in the First Universe. They had more than a hundred Gods of Creation under their banner, and that was how they got their name.

Of course, none of them visited him out of goodwill. The experts of the Hundred Empire Alliance proposed to bring Huang Xiaolong out of the Solitary Alliance in exchange for thirty universe-level spiritual veins and 30 Star Dragon Scales.

Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter when he heard the conditions and sent them away.

When the ceremony finally started several days later, Huang Xiaolong represented the Eternal Heaven Alliance in giving his congratulations.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As soon as the ceremony ended, Huang Xiaolong bade Jiang Hong farewell before leaving the Solitary Alliance.

“Haha, he really ran away quickly.” Ao Ying gave his farewell before following closely behind.

The experts present did the same.

“Father, you… Why don’t you save him?” Jiang Shaoyu hesitated for a second before asking her father.

Jiang Hong shook his head slowly and sighed, “I would have definitely saved him if he was from our alliance. However, he didn’t join us!” 

Staring at Jiang Shaoyu with a deep look in his eyes, Jiang Hong muttered, “It’s time for you to forget about him.”

How could a father be oblivious to his daughter’s feelings for another man?

With her face turning red, she wanted to plead on Huang Xiaolong’s behalf once again. She was interrupted by Jiang Hong before she could say anything. “If Huang Xiaolong manages to escape from the encirclement by relying on his own strength, I’ll allow you to go out with him.”

Jiang Shaoyu gnashed her teeth together as she tugged on the corner of her robes. She stared in the direction where Huang Xiaolong had gone as tears started to well up in her eyes. Would he be able to escape their encirclement?

…

Leaving the Solitary Alliance’s territory, Huang Xiaolong brought out the Purple Lightning Peak and ‘escaped’ in a hurry.

Ao Ying snorted in contempt when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s cowardly actions. “Does he really think that he would be able to escape with a mid-grade creation artifact?!” Getting the other experts to insert more power in the Creation Palace’s flying ship, they sped up instantly. The flying ship they brought this time was a high-grade creation artifact. They caught up pretty quickly.

As Huang Xiaolong approached a deserted star, he started to slow down.

Ao Ying ordered the others to surround the region instantly. “Do not allow the members of the Hundred Empire Alliance to enter!” 

Nodding profusely, they left to protect the region.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you have any last words?” Ao Ying roared with laughter.

Folding his hands behind his back, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Are you actually stupid? Don’t you find it weird that I stopped here?” 

Ao Ying and the others were slightly taken aback.

“Alright, I’ll tell you now. Before entering the Solitary Alliance, I laid down countless formations here.” Huang Xiaolong explained, “None of you will return to the Creation Palace today.”
