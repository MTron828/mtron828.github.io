Chapter 2105: In Trouble

A light flashed through Wan Shi’s eyes, and a plan quickly formed in his heart.

“Alright. I know what I have to do. Let’s return to the All-Heavens Divine Palace first.” Wan Shi muttered.

“Yes, Lord Father!” Wan Yue didn’t dare to pester Wan Shi further. Now that Wan Shi had left seclusion, it was a matter of time before he dealt with Huang Xiaolong. They had already waited for several dozen years. A day or two didn’t matter.

When they finally returned to the All-Heavens Divine Palace, Wan Shi spoke to Lun Zhuan and the others. He could be considered old acquaintances with Shi Zhen and Lun Zhuan He had nearly killed Lun Zhuan in the past due to some minor disagreements! However, he had eventually let Lun Zhuan off.

He discussed the state of the myriad worlds with Lun Zhuan and Shi Zhen before finally changing the topic to talk about Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh? Shi Ming is dead?” Wan Shi was shocked when he heard about what had happened to Shi Ming. Even though Wan Yue had added a lot of spicy details when he had spoken about Huang Xiaolong, Wan Shi had never expected him to be able to kill Shi Ming.

“Yes... In the battle in the World of Darkness, Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, Wang Hong, and several others were killed by Huang Xiaolong!” Wan Yue replied.

He quickly reported everything that had happened in the World of Darkness, and he also spoke about how Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“Ancient Heavenly Court!” A frown finally formed on Wan Shi’s face.

Ancient Heavenly Emperor!

A figure quickly appeared in his mind.

“That’s right...” Wan Yue hesitated for a moment before transmitting a secret message to Wan Shi, “We also received news fifty years ago that Huang Xiaolong might have gotten his hands on the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus!”

Wan Shi’s pupils shrunk.

Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus!

In the past, he had made a move because the Heavenly King had ordered him to make a move. Of course, he had considered making a move because he received news that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had managed to obtain a mid-level origin treasure, the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus!

He had never thought that Huang Xiaolong would be the one to obtain the treasure finally!

Fifty years ago... That could only mean that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t fully refined the treasure!

A fire started burning in Wan Shi’s heart when he thought about it.

“Where is he?” Wan Shi muttered.

“He’s in the Devil World right now!” Wan Yue replied hastily, and he reported about Huang Xiaolong’s movements. He also told Wan Shi about how Huang Xiaolong might have obtained the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele. “Right now, Huang Xiaolong should be hiding somewhere to refine the devil stele! He might also be refining the lotus as we speak!”

When Wan Shi heard that there was a possibility of Huang Xiaolong was refining the lotus, a chilly light flashed in his eyes. He decided to kill Huang Xiaolong no matter the cost!

With Huang Xiaolong’s talent and luck, it was a matter of time before there was no one in the myriad of worlds who could suppress him! Given another thousand years, Huang Xiaolong would reign supreme!

Wan Shi thought about it for a second before deciding to change his plan. “Now that I have emerged, pass down my All-Heavens Decree! Gather all the world leaders in my city! We shall hold a world leaders’ conference!”

Wan Yue and the others stared at him in shock.

“Lord Father, are you planning to capture Huang Xiaolong during the conference and kill him in front of the others to warn them all?” Wan Yue quickly guessed his father’s intentions, and he was stunned. “I’m afraid that both the Azure Cow and Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t turn up...”

Wan Shi sneered, “Relax. Huang Xiaolong will definitely come.”

...?!

When they saw how confident Wan Shi was, everyone stared at him in disbelief.

“Is Grandmist in the Divine World?”

“Lord Father, the King of Grandmist is currently in the Grandmist Emperor Palace in the Divine World.” Wan Yue replied. “Not only is the King of Grandmist there, the Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Darkness, and Du Hai are all gathered in the Divine World.”

“Only Old Ancestor Azure Cow and Cang Mutian returned to the Devil World with Huang Xiaolong.”

Wan Shi nodded his head. “All four of them... not too bad.” He turned and laughed after he spoke, “Do you think that Huang Xiaolong will look for me to take revenge if I head over to the Divine World to kill two of them before taking the other two hostages?”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they heard his suggestion.

Killing two of them and taking the other two hostages...

No matter which one of the four they were talking about, they were overlords! Every one of them had the ability to shake the worlds! Even if Lun Zhuan and the others made a move, they wouldn’t be a match for the Reverence Moon Old Man! Right now, Wan Shi was casually talking about killing and capturing them!

From Wan Shi’s attitude, it was nothing more than a wave of his arm.

After all, everyone was clear about his strength.

Wan Yue roared with laughter, and he quickly agreed. “If Lord Father really does that, Huang Xiaolong will definitely go crazy. He might charge straight to the All-Heavens City to duke it out with us!”

...

Ten days later...

The news of Wan Shi leaving seclusion was a secret, but the King of Grandmist and the others had long since learned of it.

In the Grandmist Emperor Palace, the Reverence Moon Old Man, the King of Granmist, King of Darkness, and Du Hai revealed a face full of worry.

“Who would have thought that Wan Shi would emerge so quickly?!” The Reverence Moon Old Man muttered, “I’ve also heard that he completely comprehended his secret art! According to him, his strength had also increased by a large amount!”

“If he can say something like that, he might no longer be in the Seventh Order Sovereign Realm!” The King of Grandmist’s heart sank.

No longer in the Seventh Order Sovereign Realm!

The thing they were worried about had finally happened!

“What do we do now? Are we going to tell Xiaolong? Is he even done with the refinement of the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele?!” The King of Darkness frowned.

The Reverence Moon Old Man shook his head. “Even if he has refined it, there is no use.” Out of all of them, the Reverence Moon Old Man was the clearest about the power Wan Shi possessed.

In the past, Wan Shi’s talent wasn’t weaker than all of them. After refining the Wan Shi Bamboo, his Sovereign Body had already reached a terrifying level. He was terrifying in both offense and defense. According to the Reverence Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be his match even if he entered the mid-level Sovereign Realm.

After all, they were separated by a chasm that was impossible to cross!

Three whole realms weren’t something Huang Xiaolong could make up for with combat strength alone.

“Hehe!” all of a sudden, a sneer entered the ears of everyone present. “Old man, you’re right! Even if Huang Xiaolong refines it, there is no use!”

All of them sucked in a cold breath when they heard the sneer. Wan Yue?!

Indeed. They saw Wan Yue sauntering into the hall with Jiang Hong in his hands.

Jiang Hong was already on his last breath, and he wasn’t conscious. It was clear he was about to die!

“Wan Yue, release my disciple!” The King of Grandmist raged.

“Release him?” Wan Yue snorted as he stared at everyone in the hall with a mocking expression.
