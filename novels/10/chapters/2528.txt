Chapter 2529: Sixth Floor!

After avoiding several waves and the attack on his holy soul, Huang Xiaolong broke through the various restrictions and entered the fourth floor!

Of course, he didn’t manage to do it instantly. By the time he arrived, four months had already passed.

When he saw the lush lands of the fourth level filled with spiritual herbs, Huang Xiaolong felt as though he had finally returned to paradise from the depths of hell. Flying beasts soared through the skies, and he looked at the welcoming sight of the spirit springs as a sense of comfort washed over his heart.

After passing the three floors before this floor, Huang Xiaolong felt slightly moved when he left the inhumane torture behind.

Living in a beautiful world felt so good!

Flying across a mountain range, a smile formed on his face when he saw the spiritual beasts frolicking about the lands. He didn’t plan to stay in the fourth level for long. Nothing in the fourth level could catch his eye. Even though origin spiritual herbs and high-grade holy spiritual jade stones were precious in the outside world, they were honestly nothing to Huang Xiaolong.

After summoning the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong tore through the skies.

Since there wasn't anything stopping him in the fourth floor, Huang Xiaolong travelled for two peaceful days before finding the entrance to the fifth floor. Even though he met with several restrictions along the way, he shattered them with a wave of his hand.

When he entered the fifth floor, holy martial arts and holy arts were strewn all around. The origin spiritual herbs were rarer than the ones on the fourth level, and they were basically level-ten origin spiritual herbs. There were some that neared the level of a holy herb.

The medicinal qi had already turned into a sea, and it seemed to have gather as clouds in the air.

Ordinary Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints would be able to save a year of cultivation if they took a whiff.

In fact, even First Heaven True Saints could benefit from the medicinal qi in the air.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s goal was the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance on the seventh floor, and he didn’t bother looking around. He controlled the Winged Dragon Flying Ship towards the depths of the fifth level instantly.

As long as he managed to find the key to the seventh floor, no treasured herb or secret art would be able to compare to his gains.

Several days later, he arrived at the sixth floor.

That was the sixth floor they were talking about!

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, everyone outside the structure was shocked.

“Who the h*ll managed to arrive at the sixth floor so quickly?! It has only been four months! Could it be Tan Juan of the Clear Snow Palace? I’ve heard that she managed to obtain the Frozen Snow Imprint when cultivating in the past. She has the ability to freeze anything in her way, and she might be able to overcome the restrictions by freezing them solid!”

“Frozen Snow Imprint?! Isn’t that something that is connected to the Holy World’s heart?! With the Frozen Snow Imprint, she can control any type of ice-attributed energy in the Holy World! If she really managed to obtain the Frozen Snow Imprint, she has to be the one to enter the sixth floor!”

“Xie Bufan of the Devil Palace might be the one who entered the sixth floor… Rumors have it that he managed to obtain the Undead Heart when he cultivated in the Devil Cave in the past. Xie Bufan would definitely be able to kill his way to the sixth floor quickly with his Undead Heart…”

Everyone speculated about the disciple, who had arrived at the sixth floor in four short months.

There were some who said that it was Tan Juan, and there were some who felt that it was Xie Bufan. Of course, there was also a small bunch who felt that it was Li Chen of the Holy Heavens. There were certainly several of them who thought that Huang Xiaolong had arrived on the sixth floorl, but they were the minority.

“Master, if Xie Bufan of the Devil Palace really manages to locate the key, he will be able to obtain your inheritance! Wouldn’t that mean…” Xue Lingyun started to panic.

She was confident that Tan Juan would be the first to enter the sixth floor, but her confidence swayed when she heard that Xie Bufan had managed to obtain the Undead Heart.

The Undead Heart was also something that could connect to the source of the Holy World!

In fact, it was a little more terrifying than the Frozen Snow Imprint.

The Frozen Snow Imprint was able to control everything related to ice in the Holy World, but someone with the Undead Heart would basically be unkillable!

The only thing that could suppress the Undead Heart was an Inextinguishable Dao Heart possessed by Primal Ancestors!

The Cangqiong Old Man couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw the look on Xue Lingyun’s face. “Some things are just meant to be.”

A stunned expression appeared on Xue Lingyun’s face. However, a smile soon took its place. “Do you mean to say that Xie Bufan wouldn’t be able to accept your inheritance?”

“Do you believe in fate?”

Xue Lingyun lowered her voice and muttered, “Fate is unpredictable…”

“Even though it has been said that we’re able to control our own fate, the fate of everyone rests in the hands of the grand dao.” The Cangqiong Old Man laughed. “Even Primal Ancestors like us wouldn’t be able to escape the clutches of the grand dao…”

“Are we still under the grand dao’s control?!” Xue Lingyun was stunned for a second.

The Cangqiong Old Man nodded and explained, “Even Primal Ancestors like us are not able to transcend the grand dao. Even with the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, we can only be considered part of the Holy World. As long as we fail to transcend the grand dao, we will never be able to escape from its control.”

Xue Lingyun fell deep into her thoughts.

“Will Juan’er be able to accept your inheritance this time?” After some time, Xue Lingyun finally regained her wits, and she asked.

A smile appeared on the old man’s face, but he didn’t reply.

A hint of suspicion appeared on Xue Lingyun’s face.

At that very instant, Huang Xiaolong was already looking around for the key to the seventh floor. His holy souls were pushed to their limits as he scoured the lands for the key.

Since the seventh floor contained everything the Cangqiong Old Man had comprehended in his life, the key used for unlocking the seventh floor had to be crafted from materials different from those that formed the sixth floorl. With his holy souls, Huang Xiaolong was confident of obtaining the key after scanning through the entire floor.

However, it was easier said than done. The sixth floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor was several times larger than the previous floors. Huang Xiaolong estimated that he would need ten days to complete his search.

With the assistance of his three holy souls, Huang Xiaolong managed to locate several holy herbs. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Even though they weren’t growing around like cabbages, they were much more concentrated on the sixth floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor when compared to the Profound River. On average, Huang Xiaolong had only managed to grab two a day in the Profound River. However, he managed to discover six stalks on the sixth floor in half a day!

Of course, there were True Saint Realm beasts guarding the holy herbs. The more precious a holy herb was, the stronger the True Saint Realm beast on guard was.
