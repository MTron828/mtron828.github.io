Chapter 3109: Do You Think It’s Weird?

The experts of the Nine Dragon Creed and the other creeds found it hard to believe, but Huang Xiaolong eventually made his way into the center of the hall and took his seat.

Shen Chen and the others found it hard to understand what was going on.

One had to know that the throne in the middle of the hall was something fit for the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch Master. Only Wangu Xu had the authority to sit there, and San Song should be the only other person qualified to take the seat.

Now, Huang Xiaolong was sitting comfortably on the throne made for Wangu Xu!

Moreover, San Song and Wangu Xu were acting like obedient children before him!

Everyone in the hall couldn’t wrap their heads around what was happening.

After sitting down, Huang Xiaolong allowed the members of the Mystical Pavilion to rise.

The reason behind his absence was because he had taken a trip down to the treasury. In the two odd hours that had passed, Huang Xiaolong thrown all the treasures he had found into the Sun Moon Furnace.

The person, who had allowed the members of the various creeds to enter, was also him.

How could he be unaware of what Shen Chen and the others were thinking? He had tons of treasures on him, and there was no way the Nine Dragon Creed and the others would return empty handed. That was also the reason they had brought such a huge army into the Mystical Pavilion.

“Is there a reason you’re here?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Shen Chen and asked.

They looked at each other hesitantly, and none of them dared to speak a word.

They entered the branch in order to fight for some benefits. However, they couldn’t understand what was going on.

Conflicted emotions filled their hearts, and seeing as none of them were saying anything, Huang Xiaolong broke the silence. “I’ll help you out here. All of you probably came to the Mystical Pavilion to fight for some of my treasures. You guys were probably thinking of splitting up their loot after they captured me, right? You guys should be here for the Pure Soil and the dao coins in my possession…”

Awkward expressions could be seen on Shen Chen’s face and many others. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Don’t you think it’s weird? Why wasn’t I captured by San Song and the others… Are you curious as to why they’re addressing me as such?”

Shen Chen and the others felt an uneasy feeling creeping across their hearts as they looked at him in confusion.

“That’s because they betrayed the Mystical Pavilion two hours ago and submitted to me! I am their master!” Huang Xiaolong declared. “Right now, all of them are my slaves!”

What?!

Shen Chen and the others stared at him in disbelief.

They slowly turned to San Song, Wangu Xu, Mu Guang, and the others.

How could the members of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch in the Origin Heavenly Cave submit to Huang Xiaolong?!

Moreover, how could they all have betrayed the Mystical Pavilion in two short hours?!

Looking at San Song, they felt that things were getting out of hand. Even if Wangu Xu changed sides, San Song wouldn’t be dragged into the mess!

What in the world is going on?!

None of them believed anything Huang Xiaolong said. After all, the concept he was proposing was too far-fetched for any of them to understand!

Huang Xiaolong sighed softly. “Do you know why I allowed you guys to enter?”

With their hearts trembling slightly, Shen Chen and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong. They couldn’t believe that the voice they had heard previously belonged to Huang Xiaolong!

Wouldn’t that mean…

“Since you’re here, there’s no need to leave,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Shen Chen felt his heart sinking, but he glared at Huang Xiaolong as frigid light flashed from his eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you mean by this?! Do you really think you can make all of us stay?”

“That’s right.”

Since he had already subdued San Song, Wangu Xu, Mu Guang, and the others, Huang Xiaolong decided to take them all down while he was at it.

Anyway, they would prove to be good fighters when he went up against the Mystical Pavilion in the future.

After all, there was no going back now that he had forced San Song and the others to submit to him. Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be surprised if the Main Pavilion Master personally looked for him to settle their debts.

Shen Chen’s expression changed and rage filled his heart when he heard what Huang Xiaolong planned to do.

“Huang Xiaolong, you must be delusional! Do you really think you can stop all of us with whatever power you have?” Shen Chen snorted. “There are more than thirty creeds here, and there are more than two thousand high-level Dao Venerables. Are you sure you can stop every single one of us from leaving? You should know that you’ll be making half the Origin Heavenly Cave your enemy if you choose to do so!”

One had to know that the thirty-odd creeds were well connected. If Huang Xiaolong offended thirty of them, he would definitely offend more than half the superpowers in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

“It’s just half the Origin Heavenly Cave.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Even the Mystical Pavilion doesn’t scare me. Do you think I’ll hesitate to offend half the Origin Heavenly Cave?” After he spoke, Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and an icy blue light shot towards Shen Chen and the others.

“Power of absolute frost at perfection level!” Shen Chen’s expression changed.

When Huang Xiaolong moved, the Myriad Formation Devil activated his formation. The skies turned dark as pillars of black light shot into the skies. Formations started appearing in the air above them.

When the Dao Venerables of the thirty-odd creeds saw the formations and power of darkness appearing around them, their blood ran cold. The title of a terrifying expert appeared in Zhang Yuanxun’s mind.

“Myriad… Myriad Formation Devil!”

When Zhang Yuanxun screamed, Shen Chen and the others stared at He Zhen in shock.

As they fell into a state of shock, San Song, Wangu Xu, Mu Guang, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, Lei Yu, and the others moved.

“Kill our way out of here!” Shen Chen roared in anger as he used everything he had to stop the incoming assault. He soared into the skies as he tried to tear the veil of black apart.

However, that was a formation laid down by the Myriad Formation Devil they were talking about. They couldn’t shatter it no matter how hard they tried.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle either. He summoned his full strength and displayed the power of all eight elements of absolute powers. He was like a lawnmower running through a field of grass when he jumped into the fray.

Those who were in his way either turned into ice statues or were paralyzed by the power of poison.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t kill anyone. He only made them lose their ability to resist.

The battle ended in less than an hour, and it took even less time than when Huang Xiaolong had dealt with San Song and the others.

Another hour passed, and Huang Xiaolong ordered them to clean up the battlefield.

“We’re going back to the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce!” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the skies.

After plundering the treasury of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch, Huang Xiaolong obtained some genesis lightning water. Since his power of absolute lightning was at the peak of major completion stage, he planned to break through to perfection level in one go!
