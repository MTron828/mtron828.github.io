Chapter 3064: Your Name is Xuankong, Right?

After realizing that Lei Yu, who was a similar existence to the supreme beings on the Extermination List’s top twenty, was taken as a mount by Huang Xiaolong, a tsunami of shock hit the hearts of World Manor and Mystical Pavilion’s experts. They could not accept such a blow of reality.

At this time, others noticed that the World Manor’s Xuankong, an expert in the top forty on the Extermination List was shaking as he stepped forward and cupped his fists at Lei Yu in respectful demeanor as he asked, “You are, Lord Lei Yu?”

Lord? Xuankong’s inexplicable respectful attitude towards Lei Yu, as he called the other party ‘lord’, dumbfounded Xiao Yuncheng, the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, and other experts. A bad feeling hit their guts. A chill ran down Three Blades Yang, Purple Giant, and Special Envoy Hailan’s backs when they heard Xuankong utter his name, and the existence that had long been forgotten surfaced from the depths of their memories.

Lei Yu looked at Xuankong, and his face split into a grin, “I didn’t expect for someone still t ostill remember me after so long. You seem to be called… Xuankong?”

Upon hearing that Lei Yu rememberd who he was, Xuankong felt extremely flattered and excited at the same time, “Yes, Lord Lei Yu. I am called Xuankong.”

Three Blades Yang got up from the ground, staring at Lei Yu with vigilance and apprehension. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lei Yu?

It’s him!

At this time, the Mystical Pavilion’s Special Envoy Hailan stepped up and said to Lei Yu, “We didn’t know that Lord Lei Yu was here personally. Please pardon our offense.”

Even Special Envoy Hailan as the Mystical Pavilion’s special envoy with great authority and power didn’t dare to appear discourteous towards an existence like Lei Yu.

“Since it is Lord Lei Yu, we can agree to divide the treasures inside Immortal Nine Flames cultivation cave into three equal parts,” she then turned to face the Prince of Origin Xiao Yuncheng, “Your Highness Yuncheng, what do you think?”

Xiao Yuncheng chuckled softly, “I have no objection to Special Envoy Hailan’s opinion.”

Although he still had no idea who this Lei Yu might be, he could deduce to a certain extent from Xuankong and Special Envoy Hailan’s attitude.

Lei Yu scoffed at his words, “You didn’t hear what my Highness said earlier? My Highness said he wants the whole Immortal Nine Flames’ treasury, the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor stay behind, and the rest of you can leave!”

Everyone froze on the spot, and the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor’s face sank.

The Main Mystical Pavilion Special Envoy Hailan’s brows furrowed slightly as she shifted his gaze onto Huang Xiaolong, “You have a grudge with our Main Mystical Pavilion’s Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor? He’s currently our Main Mystical Pavilion’s Eminent Elder, how about giving our Main Mystical Pavilion some face and let bygones be bygones?”

As the Main Mystical Pavilion’s special envoy, since when did she ever need to use an amiable negotiating tone to speak with anyone? Of course, the reason she was acting this way was not merely because of Lei Yu, but also because she could not see through Huang Xiaolong. An existence like Lei Yu was willing to become this young man’s mount, this sight was simply too mystifying.

Special Envoy Hailan tried again, “I admit Lord Lei Yu is very strong, and that subordinate of yours is not weak either, I am afraid it’s not enough to monopolize this Immortal Nine Flames’ treasury. In terms of individual strength, any one of us might not be Lord Lei Yu’s opponent, but if our Mystical Pavilion joins hands with the World Manor, you might not be able to reap any benefits at the end of this!”

A sharp light flickered across Special Envoy Hailan’s eyes, her eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

She believed Huang Xiaolong would make a wise decision.

All eyes were on Huang Xiaolong, including Prince of Origin Xiao Yuncheng.

Yet Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly, “I’m letting you leave looking at the sake of the Main Mystical Pavilion, I’ve already said, I want the Immortal Nine Flames’ treasury!”

Special Envoy Hailan could not maintain the smile on her face anymore.

Huang Xiaolong’s answer was unexpected to all of them, no one thought Huang Xiaolong would actually refuse. Xiao Yuncheng couldn’t help wondering inwardly, this young man really dares to butt head with the World Manor and main Mystical Pavilion?

Is he a disciple from the Destiny Race?

He wondered if this young man was a disciple of Destiny Race, but denied it the next moment, this young man couldn’t be a disciple of Destiny Race.

Special Envoy Hailan inhaled deeply and hardened her voice, “Fine, in that case, we’ll have to ask Lord Lei Yu to enlighten us!”

The Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, Purple Giant, and Three Blades Yang approached, standing side by side with Special Envoy Hailan. Three Blades Yang swallowed a pill and the crackling streaks of lightning around his body disappeared, replaced by a golden light, as if there weren't any injuries.

The four locked their gazes on Lei Yu.

But Xiao Yuncheng, Xuankong, and the rest of World Manor’s experts hesitated, still indecisive if they wanted to join hands with the Main Mystical Pavilion.

“Old Yu, you stay back this time,” Huang Xiaolong suddenly said, “I’ll deal with them.”

He leaped off Lei Yu’s back and landed quietly across the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, Special Envoy Hailan, Purple Giant, and Three Blades Yang.

Those opposite were perplexed by Huang Xiaolong’s action.

No one had foreseen the young man would be the one facing them.

Special Envoy Hailan observed Huang Xiaolong with obvious doubt as she asked, “You are going to fight us?”

It didn’t escape her eyes that Huang Xiaolong was merely an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable.

To many cultivators, an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable was already an unrivaled expert, but to people like them, there was no difference than an ant.

Three Blades Yang ranked forty-six on the Extermination List, and she, Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, and Purple Giant’s strength were not weaker than Three Blades Yang. In fact, she was more than slightly stronger than Three Blades Yang.

“Yes,” Huang Xiaolong responded tepidly, “The four of you can attack together,” he then glanced at Xuankong, Xiao Yuncheng, and others standing further back and added, “Of course, if you guys want to join hands, go ahead.”

Xiao Yuncheng and Xuankong still couldn’t decide.

Xuankong stared at Huang Xiaolong as if he was trying to see through him, but no matter how he looked, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation remains to be at early Ninth steem Dao Venerable Realm.

Special Envoy Hailan was doing the same thing, she truly couldn’t figure out what gave Huang Xiaolong the confidence to face them together? It was impossible that Huang Xiaolong did not understand their strengths from Three Blades Yang’s attacks earlier, yet he was adamant to challenge the four of them?

An early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable junior jhas openly challenged four Extermination List’s experts? The world seemed to have sunk into an eerie silence at this strange sight.

“Lord Lei Yu won’t interfere?” Three Blades Yang asked Huang Xiaolong, it was obvious that he was afraid Lei Yu would suddenly sneak attack them.

“All of you retreat further away.” Huang Xiaolong ordered with a wave of his hand.

Lei Yu, Old Monster Flame, and the others complied respectfully and retreated to the edge.

Special Envoy Hailan suddenly moved. A purple light enshrouded her as numerous thick streaks of lightning condensed as her palm struck out at Huang Xiaolong. The lightning on her palm howled as it zapped towards Huang Xiaolong.

The Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, Three Blades Yang, and Purple Giant also attacked simultaneously.

The overwhelming force of four people attacking together caused the entire underground space to shake, as if it was going to crumble in the next moment.

Yet Huang Xiaolong seemed unusually calm facing their attacks. His right palm pushed forward, ink-black light turned into a river, sending out a chilling corrosive energy. Special Envoy Hailan, Devil Essence Holy Dragon Old Ancestor, Three Blades Yang, and Purple Giant gave birth to unprecedented fear seeing this black light.

“Absolute poison power! Perfection level!”

“Retreat!” Special Envoy Hailan’s face paled as she shouted, her feet had already retreated by reflex.
