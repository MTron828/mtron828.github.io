Chapter 2334: Upcoming Ceremony

Your Highness?

Xing Yidan was shocked when she heard how they addressed Huang Xiaolong. However, the sinister smile on her face grew even wider, and she chuckled haughtily, “Brat, who would have thought that you were someone important in the Holy Heavens? As long as I manage to kill you, my death will not be in vain!”

The blade in her hand started to buzz as the tip trembled violently.

Hiss!

Finally, the blade tore through the space and arrived behind Huang Xiaolong’s neck.

Everyone’s expressions under the arena changed drastically, especially Elder Zhang Sijin, who felt beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead.

However, what followed next was a strange scene. The fountain of blood that everyone was anticipating didn’t appear as the blade seemed to have stopped before it could draw blood. Huang Xiaolong’s neck was like a super sponge that absorbed the impact.

Xing Yidan’s face stiffened.

How could this be?

A tyrannical force emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body all of a sudden, and it tore every muscle in Xing Yidan’s arm. The blade she held flew through the air, and she drew a beautiful arc through the air as she was thrown backwards from the impact.

The only change that happened in Huang Xiaolong was that the skin around his neck had a shallow white mark.

“You!” Xing Yidan couldn’t believe her eyes.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong was fine even after suffering a sneak attack from the opponent, the spectators cheered wildly.

Even Zhang Sijin heaved a sigh of relief as he wiped the beads of sweat from his forehead. Luckily, nothing bad had happened to Huang Xiaolong!

Huan Xiaolong turned around and looked at her indifferently, “You’re not too weak yourself. It’s a pity you failed to pierce through my defense.”

In the past year, Huang Xiaolong had devoured hundreds of disciples from the Devil Palace. He had assimilated their saint attributes and the strength of his body had reached a terrifying degree. After some self-discovery, he noticed that his saint physique could be both soft and hard at the same time. Since Xing Yidan was only at the Fourth Order Venerable Realm, she couldn’t do a thing to him even if he stood still. Even higher-level venerables were unable to break through his defense, much less someone like her.

However, he was shocked at her Hidden Void Saint Godhead.

When she had disappeared into the void earlier, even someone at his level had failed to notice her presence!

Of course, there was a limit to how long she could hide herself in the void. She could probably only hide for a few minutes before her abilities became useless.

Xing Yidan stood up and wiped the blood seeping from her mouth as she glared at Huang Xiaolong, “Even if your physical defense is strong, I refuse to believe that your mental defense is strengthened to the point of being invulnerable!” As soon as she spoke, she disappeared once again.

No longer acting carelessly, Huang Xiaolong circulated his three Saint godheads, bloodline, and physiques.

When she reappeared, she appeared on his left side. However, she was no longer in human form, and she had became a devilish monster, who was surrounded in flames. Her body had experienced some sort of subtle change as she had turned into something incorporeal.

“Die!”

Her eyes flickered as she abruptly charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

She arrived in an instant, and frightening flames emerged from her body endlessly. The special attribute of her flames made it such that it could erode her opponent’s soul!

Huang Xiaolong felt like he had fallen into a pool of magma after he was swallowed by the sea of fire.

The disciples around the arena couldn’t help but worry.

However, an unbelievable scene played out once again and the devilish flame was devoured by Huang Xiaolong.

As if she had seen something terrifying, Xing Yidan retreated in shock.

It was too bad that her neck felt cold the moment she retreated. Touching the affected area, she noticed that blood was spurting out from her neck. A look of disbelief flashed past her face and she saw how Huang Xiaolong’s arm returned to its original form from a dragon’s claw.

She couldn’t understand how her opponent managed to move so quickly!

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to give her time to think or retreat. Following up, another claw appeared as it pierced through her chest.

By reaching out with his free hand, Huang Xiaolong separated her head from the rest of her body.

When he was finally done devouring her saint attributes, Huang Xiaolong left the arena under the applause and cheers from the disciples of the Holy Heavens.

Returning to the secret room, Huang Xiaolong started refining her saint attributes.

As the Holy Mandate Imprint started to shine brightly, strands of holy spiritual qi poured out from the void.

He discovered that after increasing his strength and evolving his saint attributes, the amount of holy spiritual qi he could draw from the source of the Holy World increased.

The speed at which he refined other people’s saint attributes started to increase too.

Just like that, the night passed.

By the time he opened his eyes again, Huang Xiaolong had already completed the refinement process.

“At this rate, I’ll be able to enter the Fourth Order Venerable Realm before the apprenticeship ceremony...” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

A moment ago, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t sure if he could progress before the start of the ceremony. However, his expectations changed when he noticed the amount of holy spiritual qi pouring out from the void.

The only thing that he found a pity was that he wasn’t able to assimilate the powers of other people’s godheads. Even after refining Xing Yidan’s Hidden Void Saint Godhead, he wasn’t able to hide in the void like she had done.

“It’s time to challenge someone again.” Huang Xiaolong walked out of the room.

Zhang Sijin, who was standing outside, couldn’t help but feel a sense of shock when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s appearance. After all, he only used to appear every two days.

“Your Highness, this...?” Zhang Sijin hesitated for a second.

“Elder Zhang Sijin, arrange another match for me. I wish to challenge Cao Jincheng.” Huang Xiaolong smiled calmly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Cao Jincheng was an early-Fourth Order Venerable, and his saint godhead was the Fantasy Region Saint Godhead, ranked at one hundred and ninety seven. As for his saint physique, it ranked one hundred and fifteenth.

Zhang Sijin was startled, but he nodded like a chicken pecking on rice the next moment. “Great! I shall go ahead and arrange the battle right now!”

He was obviously excited at the fact that Huang Xiaolong’s speed of challenging opponents was increasing.

For the next two months, Huang Xiaolong continued to battle, and he refined the saint attributes of his opponents everyday.

As for the strength of the disciples he challenged, they ranged from the early-Fourth Order Venerable Realm to the peak early-Fourth Order Venerable Realm! He even challenged mid-Fourth Order Venerables occasionally!

After two months, Huang Xiaolong changed his target to those who had saint godheads ranking near the one hundreds.

As time continued to pass, four months passed in the blink of an eye. By this time, Huang Xiaolong’s godheads ranked around one hundred and twelve.

When there were three days left till the apprenticeship ceremony, Huang Xiaolong was summoned by the four Primal Ancestors. It was only then that he stopped challenging disciples of the Devil Palace.

The instant he left the Devil Cave, Huang Xiaolong raised his head to look at the sky above. Everything felt so surreal and the time that passed seemed to have disappeared in the blink of an eye.
