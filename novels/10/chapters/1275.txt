However, the little cow slapped her tail on the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s head, "Why didn’t you tell Master earlier that the Yellow Springs Magic Robe is in the depths of the Devil Prison Mountain."

Void devil beast rubbed his throbbing head and whined bitterly, "The Yellow Springs Magic Robe is extremely nefarious, and based in Master’s current strength, he won’t be able to conquer it right now. Moreover, the Yellow Springs Magic Robe is at the deepest area of the Devil Prison Mountain and the road is extremely dangerous, as it is laden with heavy restrictions. You need to be at least a high-level Ancestor God Realm master to get to the Yellow Springs Robe and conquer it."

“Are you saying that you were being considerate towards our Master?” The little cow snorted and harrumphed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xu Baisheng weakly nodded his head.

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he listened to the two of them bicker with one another. “It’s alright, don’t blame Baisheng. The Devil Prison Mountain’s depths are filled with bans and restrictive formations. It is indeed dangerous going inside there right now, given our current strengths.”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng looked gratefully at Huang Xiaolong, then confidently said to him, “Master, rest assured, give me two years! My strength will definitely recover considerably in these two years’ time. After that, I will enter the depths of Devil Prison Mountain and help Master to bring out the Yellow Springs Magic Robe.”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s strength had suffered a great damage after he was being imprisoned by the ancient Burning Purgatory Magical Formation for several hundred million years. Although more than a year had passed since the little cow had rescued him, he had only regained a small part of his strength, which didn’t even reach one-tenth of his original peak-strength.

As long as he could recover even half of his strength, the Devil Prison Mountain would be akin to his backyard, where he could come and go as he liked.

Half of his strength!

Huang Xiaolong was astonished after hearing the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s words. In other words, was half of Xu Baisheng’s strength comparable to a high-level Ancestor God Realm master?

Huang Xiaolong had never asked Xu Baisheng anything about his strength during this whole time, therefore, he was not aware in the slightest about Xu Baisheng’s strength.

Huang Xiaolong had initially thought Xu Baisheng was, at most, a Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, but now, it seemed like he was mistaken.

“Baisheng, what is your strength right now?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he looked at Xu Baisheng with a feverish gaze.

“Master, right now I’m just a Second Order Ancestor God Realm, but I have the battle power of a Third Order Ancestor God Realm.” Xu Baisheng answered, looking a little embarrassed.

In Xu Baisheng’s eyes, his current strength was so low that he was quite embarrassed to face his new Master Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong laughed exuberantly as he heavily patted Xu Baisheng’s shoulders and praised, “Excellent, excellent!”

The void devil beast Xu Baisheng actually has the battle power of a Third Order Ancestor God Realm!

All along, Huang Xiaolong had been slightly worried about the trip to the Clear Spirit World, but now that he had learned about the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s actual strength, it eased his worries slightly.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng who was feeling embarrassed became flustered, as he felt flattered by Huang Xiaolong when he patted his shoulders.

The little cow let out a few dissatisfied harrumphs on the side. That expression on her face was seemingly saying ‘Merely a Second Order Ancestor God Realm, what are you so proud of?!’

Now that Huang Xiaolong was feeling more confident about the trip to the Clear Spirit World, he began humming a few of Andy Lau’s songs as they continued travelling.

The little cow’s eyes brightened as she listened to Huang Xiaolong’s humming, and hummed along with him. She grew fonder as she hummed and asked, “Xiaolong, you thought of these songs by yourself?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and replied to her question with a question, “What do you think?”

The little cow laughed, “Between heaven and earth, Master only you can compose such wonderful songs.” She rarely flattered Huang Xiaolong, but this was one of those moments when she did.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled evilly, “You’re wrong then, these songs are not originally composed by me.”

The little cow stiffened for a second.

...

The three traveled towards the Void Sky City transmission array while talking and laughing. Half a day later, they reached the transmission array.

However, the transmission array was strictly guarded by disciples of Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Short Blade Gate, as well as other top forces of Void Sky World.

Anyone who desired to leave through the transmission array were subjected to several layers of inspections.

Huang Xiaolong saw Short Blade Gate’s Elder Lin Bi!

Killing intent flickered across the little cow’s eyes the instant she saw Lin Bi.

Sensing the little cow’s emotions, Huang Xiaolong lightly patted her head, indicating her to be cautious. There would be opportunities in the future, and right now there was no urgency.

As Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s thoughts connected with one another, she converged her killing intent in the blink of an eye.

After going through the layers of inspections, Huang Xiaolong paid several hundred billion shenbi for his group and the three of them walked towards the transmission array.

However, just as the three of them were about to step onto the transmission array, the Short Blade Gate’s Elder Lin Bi shouted, “Hold on!”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened nervously. ‘Had Lin Bi seen through their disguises?’ But given his disguise technique, Huang Xiaolong was still confident that Lin Bi shouldn’t have been able to recognize him.

By this time, Lin Bi was already standing in front of them. While pointing at Huang Xiaolong, he ordered, “You, release your aura.”

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly relieved at Lin Bi’s words. He no longer concealed his aura and released it as per the order.

“A peak late-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm.” Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was a peak late-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator, Lin Bi lost his interest in him. He waved his hand at them, indicating them that they could leave.

In truth, Lin Bi had almost recognised Huang Xiaolong for a second just now. But his suspicions had disappeared when Huang Xiaolong revealed his peak late-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm cultivation.

It had only been less than two years after all, when he had chased that kid who was merely a mid-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm at that time. No matter how hard that kid would have cultivated, or even if he would have had a heaven-defying fortuitous adventure; in Lin Bi’s mind, it would have been impossible for that kid to breakthrough to mid-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm in such a short amount of time.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of three stepped onto the long-distance transmission array. A burst of light from the transmission array transferred the three of them away from the Void Sky World.

As it would take them more than three months to arrive at Clear Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong decided to spend this time within the transmission array light pillar in refining the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruits.

He gave the little cow and void devil beast Xu Baisheng five Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruits each, in order for them to recover their strengths as soon as possible. Huang Xiaolong still had a lot of Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruits to spare for himself. Other than the ten fruits he had refined before, and the ten fruits he had given away, there were still more than thirty fruits left.

Moreover, when he would get his hands on the chaos five-colored heaven refining stone, he’d have an endless supply of chaos spiritual pills.

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow Xiaoniū, and void devil beast Xu Baisheng cultivated diligently.

...

In the blink of an eye, three months went by.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong had refined another two Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruits. When only one day was remaining before their arrival to the Clear Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong was bathed in a dazzling light, while dragon roars reverberated in space as the black and blue dragon flew out from his body. At the same time, powerful godforce seeped out from the transmission array’s light pillar. Even the transmission array’s light pillar couldn’t contain his godforce.

Huang Xiaolong’s sudden burst of godforce jolted the little cow and Xu Baisheng.

“Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!” The little cow mumbled dazedly.

On the other hand, Xu Baisheng was awestruck due to the roiling godforce coming out from Huang Xiaolong’s body as he broke through to Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. This godforce was many times stronger than an average cultivator’s godforce.

The dazzling light around Huang Xiaolong grew brighter. This light lasted for half a day before it disappeared, and everything returned to its original calm.

‘Finally broke through to Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!’ The hardest barrier to breakthrough in Ancient God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong was so happy that he let out a roaring laughter.

“Xiaolong, if you shout a few more times, this cow will turn deaf.” The little cow cried out as she dramatically pressed her front hooves over her ears.

Huang Xiaolong grinned at her and said, “Then we will change your name to Golden-horned Deaf Cow.”

A day later, the transmission array light pillar quivered and in the next second, it disappeared as Huang Xiaolong’s group of three appeared on a grand scale transmission array.

They had arrived in the Clear Spirit World.
