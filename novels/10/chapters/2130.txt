Chapter 2131: Tian Chen’s Blade

Their eyes were treated to a magnificent sight when they entered the treasury. Origin treasures after origin treasures lined the walls and took their breath away.

The All-Heavens Treasury had more than fifty origin treasures that had yet to mature. Tian Chen alone had close to fifty of them! He was as rich as the City of All-Heavens!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong and the others also managed to locate several high-grade, level-two origin treasures that were already ready to be refined!

It seemed as though Tian Chen had barely got his hands on them and was about to refine them. However, Huang Xiaolong and the others found his stash.

“We’re rich! There are so many origin treasures here!” The little cow swallowed mouthful after mouthful of saliva. “What the f*ck! Tian Chen is really rich! I’m really interested in the Heavenly Master’s Treasury now. Wouldn’t it be several times better than this?!”

Huang Xiaolong was at a loss for words. The little cow was thinking about dinner when eating her lunch! They had barely obtained Tian Chen’s treasury, and she was already thinking of raiding the Heavenly Master.

Whatever the case, it wasn’t time for them to mess about.

“Hurry up and grab the treasures. You guys should grab all the origin treasures while I look for the chaos lightning pool.”

Snapping back to reality, the little cow and the others nodded their heads.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on a lightning pool floating in the space deep within the treasury. Blacklight swirled around over it, and he immediately identified it as the rank-nine Chaos Black Sea Lightning Pool!

Blinding radiance guarded the pool, and it was clear that they were the restrictions set up by Tian Chen.

Raising his arm, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he sent a giant palm flying over to the Black Sea Lightning Pool. When it slammed into the barrier of light surrounding the lightning pool, rays of resplendent light emerged as they tried to stop his attack.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s strength had long since surpassed Tian Chen’s. The light barrier formed by Tian Chen’s restrictions dimmed, and Huang Xiaolong’s palm wrapped itself around the lightning pool.

Just as he was about to retrieve the chaos Black Sea Lightning Pool, a raging voice resounded through the palace. “Huang Xiaolong, get out here!” An uncountable number of blade lights appeared in the space above them and slashed towards Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

With enough power to shatter the heavens, the blade light seemed to be able to exterminate anything in its path. The blade lights slashed towards Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Before the blade lights could cut into them, the King of Grandmist, the little cow, and the few of them felt as though their souls were about to shatter from the pressure given off by it.

Their expressions sank. It was especially so for the Flying Devil Python, who was the weakest out of all of them. Its scales started to shatter, and blood dyed its body red.

It was clear that Tian Chen was no weakling!

Huang Xiaolong stared at the scene before him in shock. He knew that Tian Chen had just entered the high-level Sovereign Realm, and he had never expected for Tian Chen to possess such terrifying strength. A single strike from him wasn’t weaker than Wan Shi’s normal attack to the fullest, excluding the use of the Great Purity Secret Art!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong was merely surprised by the fact that Tian Chen was stronger than he expected. He didn’t bother with Tian Chen in the slightest as he continued to grab the Black Sea Lightning Pool. Raising his other arm, he flicked a finger towards Tian Chen.

The unstoppable blade light that threatened to kill the overlords dissipated in the instant Huang Xiaolong flicked his finger. It was as though the blade lights had never existed in the first place.

“Up!” Huang Xiaolong clenched his fist, and he tore the chaos lightning pool out from the ground. With a flick of his wrist, he threw it into the Ancient Heavenly Court.

The little cow who managed to escape death grabbed all the origin treasures she could in the treasury.

Several blasts resounded through the air as streaks of light broke through the space and reached the space above the mountain peak. Wan Shi and the others arrived.

Tian Chen’s expression was extremely ugly. Even though he was extremely far away and a little bit of the power contained within his strike had managed to dissipate, he had never expected Huang Xiaolong to block it so easily.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Killing intent spewed out from Tian Chen’s eyes. He had learned of everything the moment Huang Xiaolong had smashed through all the restrictions in his palace. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When he thought about how Huang Xiaolong and the others plundered his treasury which stored countless years of hard work, his eyes turned bloodshot. He screamed, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far! Go to h*ll!” A massive blade appeared in his hand as soon as he spoke.

The blade in his hand measured three to four meters, and blacklight swirled around its surface. There were countless diagrams of angels and demons carved onto it.

With the appearance of Tian Chen’s blade, the space around it seemed to be sliced open. Blade light flew about, and a massive crack appeared on the mountain peak in the distance.

After seeing the shocking power contained within Tian Chen’s blade without him utilizing his Sovereign’s will, the experts standing about sucked in a cold breath. Even Wan Shi stared at the blade with a burning gaze.

“Bleak Radiance of a Thousand Worlds!”

Tian Chen roared as he slashed his blade towards Huang Xiaolong.

Boundless blade qi surged towards Huang Xiaolong, and the tyrannical might blasted against the mountain range. Under Tian Chen’s attack’s horrifying strength, the peaks of the mountains located along the range were sliced open and turned into flat ground.

Even if he had to destroy his personal cultivation palace, he wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong. Regardless of the price he had to pay, Huang Xiaolong had to die!

Rumbling sounds came from all the restrictions Tian Chen shattered when his blade light passed through them. A wave of blade qi strong enough to turn over the heavens came smashing down on Huang Xiaolong.

Before the blade qi landed on them, Huang Xiaolong and the others could already feel the frigid qi contained in his attack. It was the scariest frigid qi the little cow, the King of Grandmist, and the other overlords had ever experienced. If it landed on them, they wouldn’t even need to bother with the blade qi as their souls would freeze over instantly.

Hm?!

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a short breath in surprise as he had never expected Tian Chen’s blade qi to be so terrifying. Tian Chen’s current attack wasn’t weaker than Wan Shi’s first strike with the Myriad Worlds Bamboo!

A somber expression appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Even though it was strong, it wasn’t enough to cause him to panic. A soft grunt left his lips as the light enveloped his body. Endless amounts of light poured out from his body, and sixteen wings appeared behind him. Without taking out the Radiance Divine Scepter, he gathered sword qi in his hand as he slapped outwards.

The sword qi he gathered slammed into Tian Chen’s blade qi.

Continuous explosions rang out through the mountain range, and despite the sturdiness of the treasury, it was torn apart like paper. Every single treasure that was out in the open was reduced to fine dust.

When the impact of the shockwaves produced by the collision slammed into Wan Shi and the others, their expressions changed.

It was especially so for the Dark Curses Old Ancestor. His soul seemed to escape from his body as he retreated as quickly as he could.

Wan Shi couldn’t remain idle, and he summoned his Myriad Worlds Bamboo in order to help Tian Chen. With the Myriad Worlds Bamboo and Tian Chen’s giant blade sweeping across space simultaneously, they finally managed to stop Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi from doing further damage.

Even so, the two of them were thrown backwards as they retreated for several dozen thousand miles before regaining their footing.

A look of shock appeared on Wan Shi’s face.

How?! How can this happen?!

He had worked together with Tian Chen, but they were still forced to retreat by Huang Xiaolong! One had to know that Huang Xiaolong’s lightning bead hadn’t even made an appearance!
