Chapter 3506: Young Dragon

 

Even though Huang Xiaolong had no idea how many devil dragons lived in the Dragon’s Impasse, he was sure that more than half of them were gathered on the plains before him.

He might not know what drew them over, but he could feel a mysterious power contained under the plains.

It was a type of dragon energy, and it was different from the one used by the Dragon Race in the Star Dragon Universe. Huang Xiaolong had experienced the Blazing Dragon’s dragon energy in the past, but he could feel that the energy contained in the plains was of much better purity!

Was that the power of the Star Dragon?

Huang Xiaolong finally understood why there would be Star Dragon Scales there.

However, he had to think of how to draw the devil dragons away.

His eyebrows were locked tightly together.

The only way he could get them to leave was if he found out the source of the dragon qi. However, he couldn’t even see the end of the mysterious plains! How was he supposed to discover the reason?

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered slightly.

“Your Highness, we shouldn’t mess with the devil dragons randomly. We need to think of a foolproof method before trying anything.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. 

He knew that if things were to go wrong, he might not be able to leave the Dragon’s Impasse no matter how strong he was.

After thinking for a few days, he couldn’t think of anything! He might be able to hide himself with the Huang Long Cape, but there were devil dragons as strong as Ao Guang in the horde! He couldn’t possibly hide from them.

What could he do…

Huang Xiaolong had never been so anxious to think of a solution.

Even though the power of the four universe origin fires was strong, they weren’t invincible!

Half a month passed with no conclusion.

Just as he thought about braving a journey to the center of the plains, the devil dragons started to get restless. The entire region started to tremble.

It seemed as though something under the plains was trying to claw its way out of the ground!

Huang Xiaolong could see the look of panic on the devil dragons.

The sudden change caught Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang by surprise.

Looking at Ao Guang for an explanation, Huang Xiaolong saw the man shaking his head. It was clear he had no idea what was happening.

The trembling became even more intense, and the cracks in the ground started to grow wider and wider. It didn’t take long for the crack to cover the lands.

As the cracks grew larger and larger, starlight started to emerge from them.

As the starlight rose into the skies, they formed countless stars that hung above the plains. They remained silently above the plains and one would see a sea of vibrant light from the distance. It was a sight whose beauty eclipsed everything Huang Xiaolong had seen in the past, and it seemed to contain the most perfect grand dao in the universe.

Even Ao Guang could only stare at the scene before him in awe.

When both of them were still stuck in a state of shock, a giant egg flew out from the ground.

The shell of the egg was inscribed with countless runes, and they resembled the sea of stars above them.

Streaks of light burst out from the egg as cracks started to appear on it, and when Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang looked at the hatching egg, they felt as though the heavens and earth were splitting apart.

A miniature dragon beast emerged from the egg, and it was a cute little creature. Its body was full of star-like runes, and they resembled the markings on the shell.

Huang Xiaolong’s jaw dropped in fright. The egg was nearly half the size of the mysterious plains, but the creature that popped out from the egg was too damn small compared to it!

It was the size of an ordinary human baby!

When the little critter emerged, the devil dragons who were kneeling on the ground raised their heads and roared towards the skies. It was as though they had finally met their emperor.

Even the strongest devil dragon in the mysterious plains behaved the same way.

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

Could the little baby dragon actually be…

Puffing up its chest, the little baby dragon released a little yawn. A sleepy expression appeared on its face as it leaped towards the eggshell before it. In a matter of seconds, it devoured the massive shell it once came from.

After it was done, the runes around its body started to light up a little more.

However, a shocking scene soon played out. The little baby dragon looked at Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang as it tilted its head in confusion. The two of them felt their bodies tensing up when they noticed the little beast’s stare.

They were hiding in the cracks of space, and they didn’t release the slightest trace of energy!

When the two of them didn’t know what to do, the little baby dragon appeared before them with a wave of its tail. Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang realized that their bodies had been dragged out from the void a long time ago.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils shrunk instantly. How in the world did the little dragon force them out of hiding?! They didn’t detect anything at all, and they didn’t see it make a move!

Ao Guang was even more surprised. He was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, but he failed to notice how the little guy forced them out of hiding.

Neither of them dared to move, as every single dragon on the mysterious plains locked on to them the instant they realized that they were exposed. They knew that the slightest movement would cause the devil dragons to pounce.

The little dragon looked at Huang Xiaolong and pouted slightly, “Big brother, why did you come here?” 

Huang Xiaolong felt his head going blank when he heard the little dragon. He was a God of Creation, but a little newborn dragon addressed him however he liked!

“Oh, I know! You’re here to seal my Star Fruits!” The little dragon’s eyes spun, and he cried out in indignation.

Question marks popped up in Huang Xiaolong’s and Ao Guang’s minds. They had no idea what the little dragon was talking about.

“Are you not here to seal my fruits?!” The little dragon tilted his head to the side when he saw the look of confusion on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong had no idea how to reply to the little kid, and he eventually exposed his goal for the trip. “We are here to look for something, but we’re not here for the Star Fruits…”

“What are you looking for? I’ll help you find it!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ao Guang and thought about it for a second.

“We’re here for the Star Dragon Scales.” He eventually chose to reveal his objective.

“Oh! That’s what you’re looking for!” The little dragon giggled, “Let’s go! I’ll bring you to a place with a ton of them!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After he spoke, he started to fly towards the other end of the mysterious plains.

A ton of them?!

Huang Xiaolong and Ao Guang stared at the little dragon in fright and followed behind him cautiously.
