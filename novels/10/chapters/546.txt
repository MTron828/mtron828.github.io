The garnet haired young man’s eyes were icy-cold glaring at Huang Xiaolong, “Little punk, do you really think passing the new disciple assessment means that no one dares to take your life? Let me wake you up, every year, the number of Black Warrior Institute outer disciples who lose their lives outside performing various tasks isn’t small.”

This was a naked threat.

There were fatal risks everytime the Black Warrior Institute’s outer disciples went out to perform tasks, and in general, the institute wouldn’t employ resources to investigate the cause of death of an outer disciple.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong retorted with a cold sneer, “Then, could it be that you don’t know that quite a number of Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciples also lose their lives while performing tasks outside.”

“You!” A sharp glint exploded in the garnet haired young man’s eyes, murderous intent roared in his heart. But he didn’t make any move, for inner disciples were forbidden from attacking outer disciples. This was one of the Black Warrior Institute’s strict rules which he dared not violate, thus he forcefully suppressed the urge to kill the punk in front of him.

“Little punk, in two months’ time, all new disciples are required to perform a task outside, I’ll see how long you can keep your arrogance.” The look in his eyes grew increasingly frosty.

The underlying meaning of his words was that two months later when Huang Xiaolong went out to perform his task, he would deal with Huang Xiaolong. However, the support behind him had to be substantially powerful seeing that he dared to say that in public.

Throwing that sentence to Huang Xiaolong, the garnet haired young man snorted and walked away.

Huang Xiaolong did not stop him

“I can feel a flaming ice energy coming from this young man, he’s probably a Lin Family’s core disciple.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi added, “Only the core members of the Lin Family who practiced their Lin Family’s secret technique, the Flameice Cardinal Technique, can emit this kind of energy.”

The Lin Family was one of Black Tortoise Galaxy’s super forces. In the past, perhaps Huang Xiaolong would have spared some thoughts on the matter, but things were different now.

‘Still, I must break through to God Realm at the earliest possible.’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. At his current strength, he was considered unrivaled against Second Order God Realm and below, however, if he ran into an enemy above Second Order God Realm, he would be caught in a sticky situation. Regardless of time and place, one’s own strength was the most crucial.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t so naive as to assume that the sole identity of a personal disciple of the Black Warrior Institute’s Principal would enable him to walk sideways in the galaxy.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong received both his disciple identity token and robe from the Supreme Harmony Hall. Leaving the Supreme Harmony Hall, Huang Xiaolong went straight back to Feng Yang’s manor instead of loitering in the streets.

In the Black Warrior Institute, outer disciples were not allocated their personal yard. Usually, four disciples shared a room, which was an inconvenience for Huang Xiaolong to cultivate. Therefore, for the time being, Huang Xiaolong stuck to living in Feng Yang’s manor so he could cultivate without disturbance. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He planned to move out once he was promoted to an inner disciple, where each inner disciple was given their personal courtyard. Even though his Master Feng Yang did not mind it, Huang Xiaolong preferred being less dependent on his Master.

After Huang Xiaolong walked into Feng Yang’s palace-like manor, in the distance, an inner disciple came out from the shadows with a shocked expression staring in the direction where Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette disappeared. It was a long time later before he recovered, quickly turning away.

Some time later, the same inner disciple arrived at a courtyard, reporting to the garnet haired young man who wanted to deal with Huang Xiaolong what he saw.

The garnet haired young man, Lin Jun, was stunned at what he heard, “Are you sure that punk entered the Institute Principal’s manor?!”

“Yes, Senior brother Lin Jun.” That inner disciple inquired, “Do you think that could be...?!”

“Huang Xiaolong!” Lin Jun’s expression darkened; a new disciple able to enter and leave the Institute Principal’s manor as he pleased, even a blind person could discern this new disciple’s identity.

No wonder a new disciple dared to show such arrogance! Not even putting an inner disciple like him in his eyes!

“Senior brother Lin Jun, I think we should just forget about this matter.” That inner disciple carefully persuaded.

A light flickered in Lin Jun’s eyes, he waved a hand at the disciple saying, “You’re excused for now.”

That disciple acknowledged softly and backed out from the courtyard.

Lin Jun remained where he was with his hands behind his back. Forget about it? Unfortunately, his heart was unwilling to let things slide!

As for Huang Xiaolong, after returning to Feng Yang’s manor, he continued to cultivate by taking the Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellets He planned to refine all twenty thousand pellets that Feng Yang had given him earlier within half a month, refining everything before the apprenticeship ceremony.

To refine all twenty thousand pellets in half a month’s time, on an average count, he’d need to refine over one thousand three hundred pellets daily.

Sitting in a meditative pose inside the Xumi Temple, his mouth opened and inhaled more than two hundred Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellets into his body. Circulating the Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art, the formation diagram inside his body appeared, releasing abundant amount of true dragon essence energy.

Two hundred pellets’ medicinal energy rushed into the diagram formation like a raging river and was instantly disintegrated, becoming part of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Huang Xiaolong had noticed this when he was refining the first one thousand Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellet that he received as reward. This Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art’s diagram formation was able to increase Huang Xiaolong’s energy refining speed. This was the reason Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could refine all twenty thousand pellets in half a month’s time.

Still, Huang Xiaolong dared not refine too many at one time.

His True Dragon Physique had reached minor completion, refining two hundred pellets at one time was already the limit of what Huang Xiaolong could endure.

Time flowed.

Each time, Huang Xiaolong would refine the pellets in batches of two hundred.

Half a month later, inside the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, breathing out turbid qi from his mouth, coming to a stand on his feet.

After half a month of tedious refining, he finally finished the twenty thousand Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellets. Twenty thousand pellets later, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi, true essence energy, and True Dragon Physique saw a great leap in strength, even his soul gained a significant level of clarity. If the news of Huang Xiaolong refining twenty thousand Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellets was made known, a large number of people would be frightened to death.

Feng Yang was struck dizzy when he found out that Huang Xiaolong had refined all one thousand Black Warrior Greater Strength Pellets in fifteen days, but now the number had increased by twenty times...

Huang Xiaolong exited from the Xumi Temple. At this time, the sun was rising on the horizon, but the whole Black Tortoise World was already bustling, for today was the Black Warrior Institute Principal’s apprenticeship grand ceremony.

The Black Tortoise Galaxy’s numerous masters arrived in the Black Tortoise World through transmission arrays from different parts of the galaxy.

The whole Black Tortoise World was in a convivial atmosphere, every city was decked out in colorful lanterns and streamers. Above the airspace of each city, flowers of every color glowed brightly as they spun.

Group after group of Black Warrior Institute disciples lead guests from every family toward the institute’s central grand hall, where the apprenticeship ceremony would be conducted.

By the time Huang Xiaolong came out from the Xumi Temple, Institute Principal Feng Yang was already in the grand hall, greeting the guests that arrived from all over the galaxy. Before that, he had instructed Elder Zhang Tianchuan to wait for Huang Xiaolong to come out from closed-door practice and lead him over to the grand hall.

On the way, Zhang Tianchuan explained in detail to Huang Xiaolong the steps involved in the apprenticeship ceremony and what he needed to pay attention to. The apprenticeship ceremony involved many complicated steps, and Huang Xiaolong committed each of them to memory.

When Zhang Tianchuan led Huang Xiaolong into the grand hall, the many high expert guests present almost immediately turned their attention toward him.

On this day, in the entire Black Tortoise Galaxy, Huang Xiaolong was the center of attention, not only because he was about to become the Black Warrior Institute Principal’s personal disciple, but also due to the talent and strength he displayed during the new disciple selection assessment that had shocked everyone, including some super forces’ Ancestors that had gone into seclusion for many years.

That was why many Highgod Realm Ancestors were also present at this grand apprenticeship ceremony, something that had never happened in the past apprenticeship ceremonies of the Institute Principal.
