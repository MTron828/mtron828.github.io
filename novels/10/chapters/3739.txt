Chapter 3740: Control Yourself

Terror appeared in the eyes of the disciples of the Peng Family.

One of the God of Creation Realm experts who came to the banquet asked in haste, “Brother Wang, we might have come to celebrate his birthday, but we’re not related to the Peng Family!”

Many other experts started to explain themselves in succession. All of them drew a clear line with the Peng Family.

Peng Xian roared with anger, “You…”

All of them were friends he made in the past. Who would have thought that they would leave the Peng Family to die in the slightest bit of trouble?

Someone in the crowd sneered, “Peng Xian, you can’t blame us for this! You offended the Heaven Sage Palace on your own! You can only blame yourself!”

Wang Kaifei clapped and laughed, “Did you hear that? You can only blame yourself for your bad luck!”

Peng Xian’s expression sank as he glared at Wang Kaifei.

All of a sudden, the experts of the Heaven Sage Palace released their aura and locked on to the members of the Peng Family. As long as anyone tried anything funny, they would be killed.

Wang Kaifei swept his gaze across the hall and saw a young man casually sipping on his tea and his expression turned dark. “Who would have thought that there would be a dumb*ss who doesn’t know how to read the room?”

Wang Kaifei was extremely unhappy to see that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t flustered at all.

Even though he had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was, he could tell that he was a guest invited by Peng Xian. According to him, Peng Xian wouldn’t be able to invite anyone important. As such, he felt that everyone in the hall was merely peasants. After all, he was someone from the Heaven Sage Palace now.

Those standing around burst out laughing when they heard what Wang Kaifei said.

Huang Xiaolong raised his head and snorted coldly, “Slap him.”

Slap him?!

Before Wang Kaifei could retort, a fine hand appeared in the skies and slapped him across the face. He was sent flying out of the hall and he landed heavily on the platform outside. Cracks formed in the ground.

Everyone stared at Wang Kaifei in shock.

?!

The gaze in their eyes changed when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

The ancestors who were in the hall quickly drew their distance from Huang Xiaolong.

Despite his obvious attack, no one saw how Huang Xiaolong did it.

Peng Xian was unable to see what he did, and neither could the experts of the Heaven Sage Palace.

The four half-step Universe Gods felt their pupils shrinking when they looked at Huang Xiaolong once again.

The experts of the Wang Family felt their hearts pounding in their chests as they stood rooted in place.

Crawling to his feet, Wang Kaifei felt that his entire body was in shambles. The slap earlier caused all the teeth in his mouth to fall out.

“You!” Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, Wang Kaifei roared with rage. He was someone who served Lord Shen An of the Heaven Sage Palace. After he returned from the Eastern Plains, he had never suffered from such disrespect!

“Kneel,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Next, Wang Kaifei felt a formless pressure that contained the weight of the world crashing down on his shoulders. Falling to his knees, he realized that he couldn’t move a single muscle!

His knees shattered the rocks beneath his feet.

The faces of those standing around changed once again.

Silence fell on the Peng Family Manor.

One of the four experts from the Heaven Sage Palace spoke up all of a sudden. “No matter who you are, you better control yourself! Right now, Wang Kaifei is someone who works for Lord Shen An! He’s someone from our Heaven Sage Palace! You…”

Before he could finish his sentence, Huang Xiaolong sighted, “If you wish to speak to me, get down here!”

Another formless arm appeared in the skies to send the four of them slamming into the ground.

Gasps filled the air.

Peng Xian was shocked.

He thought that Huang Xiaolong might be someone who crossed the 10 billion mark, but from what it seemed, Huang Xiaolong was much stronger than he thought!

No ordinary expert who barely broke through the 10 billion mark could drive four half-step Universe Gods into the ground.

Is he someone who reached the 11 billion unit mark?

Or perhaps, 12 billion units…

Expressions of rage could be seen on their faces when they crawled to their feet.

“Who do you think you are?! Do you know what will happen if you choose to go against our Heaven Sage Palace?!” the person who spoke earlier snapped at Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh, why don’t you tell me what will happen?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled before placing his cup down on the table.

When the experts of the Heaven Sage Palace saw that, they felt as though something bad was about to happen. Hesitating slightly, he eventually snorted in irritation, “Don’t get cocky, Lord Shen An is currently in the city!”

It was true. Shen An was in the Wang Family Manor and he sent four experts to follow Wang Kaifei. From his estimates, they were more than enough to destroy the Peng Family Manor many times over.

As such, he didn’t bother showing up personally.

Shen An was the direct disciple of the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, and he was extremely famous in the region. He had 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy!Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong released his dao soul and covered the entire city. Flicking his finger slightly, a hole appeared in the void and several figures came crashing down.

When the experts in the hall saw the arrival of the newcomers, they were shocked.

“Lord… Lord Shen An?!”

The people Huang Xiaolong dragged over were Shen An and his subordinates! There were five people in total, and all of them were brought over in an instant.

Just a moment ago, Shen An and the others were discussing matters about the Nine Cauldrons when they felt the space around their body tightening up. They couldn’t move as the world started to spin around them. The next thing they knew, they were in the main hall of the Peng Family.

Looking around, Shen An was shocked to discover the four experts he sent over with Wang Kaifei.

“What’s going…” Before Shen An could ask his question, Huang Xiaolong interrupted him. “Are you Shen An?”

Shen An spun around only to be confronted by Huang Xiaolong.

One of the experts who came with Wang Kaifei ran over hastily to tell Shen An everything that went down.

When he was done, a look of suspicion appeared in Shen An’s eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong cautiously.
