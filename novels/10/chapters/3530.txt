Chapter 3531: Pursuing Wang Meiqi

“Brother Shenglin, do you know the ancestor of the Fantasy Butterfly Race?” Chi Qin couldn’t help but ask.

A brilliant smile formed on his face. “If I’m not wrong, it’s her! She’s the most talented disciple of the Fantasy Butterfly Race with the ten-colored wings!” A nostalgic look appeared on his face as he continued, “Wang Meiqi!”

“Wang Meiqi!” Chi Qin gaped in shock. He might be a God of Creation when she left, but she knew about her. Firstly, her talent was terrifying. Next, she was a complete beauty! It was said that she ranked in the top three in terms of look in the First Universe.

As for the other two, they were already Gods of Creation by the time Wang Meiqi disappeared. She was the only Dao Venerable among them, and yet, she was equally as famous! One could only imagine how well-received she was!

Chi Qin looked at Jin Shenglin and chuckled, “In the past, there were many people trying to chase her. Brother Shenglin is one of them… You even came to blows with Huang Zongquan because of it!”

“That’s right…” An awkward smile appeared on Jin Shenglin’s face. She was the reason for his enmity with Huang Zongquan.

What made it more awkward was that Huang Zongquan was also in the Eternal Heaven Alliance.

“Alright, let’s go back to the Trickling Scarlet World.” Chi Qin got to his feet and sighed, “I can’t wait to meet the Ten Winged Butterfly…”

She gained the nickname due to her beauty and her talent.

“Let’s hurry then.” Getting to his feet, Jin Shenglin tore through the air.

Following closely behind, Chi Qin chuckled, “Damn brat, you’re even more anxious than me. You’re going to meet the goddess of your dreams, but it won’t kill you to go there a little slower! Whatever the case, she’s back.” Pausing for a second, he continued, “From Chi Tianyang’s report, she addressed someone as ‘His Highness’ and from what it looks like, they’re pretty close.”

Jin Shenglin revealed a resolute look, and he growled, “No matter who he is, he won’t be able to stop me. I won’t lose her again.”

Chi Qin gave him a thumbs up silently.

Turning into streaks of light, the two of them returned to the Trickling Scarlet World.

Three months later, the two of them met Huang Xiaolong’s group of four.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When Jin Shenglin saw Wang Meiqi again, his mind went completely blank. He could only chuckle happily, “Meiqi, you’re back!”

She was equally as surprised to see someone she was acquainted with. “Jin Shenglin?”

“This is great! You’re still alive!” Jin Shenglin couldn’t contain the happiness in his heart, and he quickly went over to her.

However, his actions went a little overboard.

Wang Meiqi’s expression turned unnatural, especially since Huang Xiaolong was also there.

As for Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang, they locked onto Jin Shenglin the moment he moved. The moment he tried anything out of line, they would take him down instantly.

Huang Xiaolong’s relationship with Wang Meiqi might not have reached the standard of husband and wife, but they were a couple as far as the two dragons were concerned.

Huang Xiaolong could feel the animosity in the air, and he quickly coughed once to break the awkward atmosphere.

“You can call me Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong cupped his fist towards Chi Qin and Jin Shenglin.

Wang Meiqi continued, “All three of us serve His Highness.”

Chi Qin and Jin Shenglin stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. They could tell that Wang Meiqi, Ao Shenghai, and Ao Guang were God of Creation realm experts at the grand completion stage, but Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even reached the large completion stage!

No. He doesn’t even possess 2.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

How in the world did he turn into their lord?!

They couldn’t understand what was going on.

“Fellow cultivator Huang Xiaolong…” Despite their confusion, they returned his greeting.

Huang Xiaolong knew what he was thinking, and he chuckled to himself. He naturally hid his second and third world when he displayed his strength.

After chatting casually with Huang Xiaolong, a serious expression formed on Jin Shenglin’s face. “I won’t hide anything from fellow cultivators. In the past, I tried chasing Wang Meiqi before she disappeared. I am unable to forget about her after so many years, and I will definitely put in more effort now that she’s back. I won’t allow her to leave me again.”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

Not even Huang Xiaolong could have expected that he would be so direct.

“Jin Shenglin, stop talking nonsense!” Wang Meiqi yelled in fright. She was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would misunderstand.

However, he shook his head slowly. “I’m not. Meiqi, I regret not being by your side in the past, and I won’t miss this chance.”

She was struck speechless by his shameless declaration of love.

Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang looked at each other silently.

“Hehe, let’s not talk about this.” Chi Qin interrupted all of them, and he continued, “Why don’t we talk about your admission to the Eternal Heaven Alliance?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. “Alright.”

They entered the main hall of the Trickling Scarlet Palace, and Jin Shenglin wanted to use the chance to get close to Wang Meiqi. However, Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang forced him to the side with their power. He could only seethe in anger silently as he was unable to defeat either of them.

Jin Shenglin might be at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, but he was like Wang Meiqi. He had barely broken through.

After discussing some terms with Chi Qin, Huang Xiaolong formed a clear picture of the Eternal Heaven Alliance. He decided to head over to meet the two heads of the alliance with Chi Qin in a few days.

There were four palace masters in the Creation Palace, but there were only two heads in the Eternal Heaven Alliance. Both of them were half-step Universe Gods, and they possessed limitless authority in the alliance. As long as one entered the half-step Universe God Realm, they would be able to ascend to the position of a palace master in the Creation Palace or become a head in the Eternal Heaven Alliance. The moment Huang Xiaolong entered the half step Universe God Realm in the future, he would become the third head of the alliance!

Naturally, Mei Jie was an exception.

In the following days, they settled down in the Trickling Scarlet Palace.

Jin Shenglin came over every day in order to talk about the past with Wang Meiqi, and he thoroughly enraged her. She laid down a restriction around her residence, stopping him from entering.

After a few days, the entire group set off for the headquarters of the Eternal Heaven Alliance.

As Chi Qin had a mid-grade creation-artifact-level flying ship, it was much faster than the Purple Lightning Peak. Even so, it would take them half a year to arrive.
