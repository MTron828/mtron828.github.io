Chapter 2759: Spirit Devil Alliance

“What? Tang Dragon, Freezing Desert, and Chufan Sacred Land’s treasuries were emptied out? Was it taken away by Cangqiong Sacred Land? In other words, after Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan were captured, the three sacred lands’ experts all submitted to Cangqiong Sacred Land?!”

“That’s right, the Tang Dragon, Freezing Desert, and Chufan Sacred Land now only exist in name only!”

Initially, no one in the nearby sacred lands believed this piece of news, and they thought that someone was playing a prank, but as the news spread wider, it began to raise doubts and suspicions, and the results of investigations shocked many.

……

Spirit Devil Sacred Land…

In the main great hall, several hundred Primal Ancestor experts were gathered.

These several hundred Primal Ancestors came from the nearby thirty-plus sacred lands, and amongst them were over twenty sacred land’s patriarchs.

The happenings of the three sacred lands had made these people feel uneasy. Hence, they had gathered here at the Spirit Devil Sacred Land to discuss countermeasures.

On the surface, Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land seemed to be the strongest amongst these sacred lands, but Spirit Devil Sacred Land was the most mysterious one. Spirit Devil Sacred Land Patriarch’s strength was said to be unfathomable, and there were rumors that claimed that even if Tang Long and Han Mo were to join hands, they were no match against the Spirit Devil Sacred Land’s patriarch.

“Spirit Devil Patriarch, the three sacred lands have submitted to the Cangqiong Sacred Land. Has this news been verified?” The Glory Armor Sacred Land’s patriarch asked as he looked at the Spirit Devil Sacred Land’s patriarch, who sat on the main seat.

The Spirit Devil Patriarch’s body was enshrouded by a faint veil of devil qi that hindered others from getting a clear look at him, and it added another layer of mystery to him. There also came a vague but seemingly strong aura from his body that made others wary.

Spirit Devil Patriarch was the one who had told them that after the three sacred lands’ armies were defeated, Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan were captured, and the three sacred lands’ experts were swallowed by Cangqiong Sacred Land..

The Spirit Devil Patriarch’s eyes swept over everyone present, and he spoke unhurriedly, “Would I joke around with this matter?” He stared at the Glory Armor Sacred Land’s patriarch as he went on, “Glory Armor Patriarch, are you implying that I am playing a prank on everyone here?”

Glory Armor Sacred Land Patriarch’s face was slightly pale upon detecting the displeasure in the Spirit Devil Patriarch’s voice. In a fluster, he waved his hands and explained in a hurry, “No, no, I don’t mean that at all. It’s just that the news came too suddenly and I asked without thinking. There is no other meaning to it.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Floating Petals Sacred Land Patriarch spoke to break the tense atmosphere, “Honestly, Glory Armor Patriarch is not the only one who felt that this news is too sudden. Cangqiong Sacred Land is merely a small sacred land that was established several hundred years ago. Who would’ve thought that the three sacred lands’ armies would actually be defeated? On top of that, Tang Long and the others were detained?! Isn’t Cangqiong Old Man the strongest person there? What other experts do they have?”

“That’s right, this news came too suddenly,” Ghost Knife Sacred Land Patriarch chimed in.

Other sacred lands’ patriarchs agreed and stated their doubts aloud.

But everyone quieted down in an instant the moment the Spirit Devil Patriarch pressed his palm in the air.

“Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan are captured, and their three sacred lands have submitted to Cangqiong Sacred Land. This news is a hundred percent true.” The Spirit Devil Patriarch reiterated, “As for Tang Long and the other two sacred lands’ patriarchs, I am still investigating this matter, and there should be a result soon.”

Several people exchanged glances.

“If that is really the case, then the Cangqiong Sacred Land probably has a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert. And there seems to be more than one.” Floating Petals Patriarch surmised his opinion solemnly, “More importantly, Cangqiong Sacred Land has actually endured more than a hundred years. Their ambitions are likely bigger than we think.”

“What the Floating Petals Patriarch said is exactly what I mean.” Spirit Devil Patriarch went on seriously, “Since Cangqiong Sacred Land was capable of defeating the three sacred lands’ armies, it proves that they definitely not some small and insignificant sacred land we thought it was. It has a startling foundation and power, and now, with the three sacred lands’ experts added to their side, Cangqiong Sacred Land is stronger than before. I’m afraid to say that it won’t be long before Cangqiong Sacred Land comes barging at our doors!”

……

The Chufan Sacred Land’s headquarters…

Huang Xiaolong stood in the air above the headquarters’ small courtyard, looking at the tranquil Chufan City.

After arriving at Chufan Sacred Land, he had successfully collected the Chufan Sacred Land’s treasury, and subjugated the Chufan Sacred Land’s remaining experts. It could be said the three sacred lands were truly under his control now.

Stepping out in the night’s darkness, Fei Yanzi came to Huang Xiaolong’s side.

“What are you thinking about?” Fei Yanzi asked softly in her pleasing voice.

Huang Xiaolong tilted his head and sighed, “I am thinking about my parents and the others.”

He was thinking about his family in the lower worlds and also his family on Earth.

Fei Yanzi thought that Huang Xiaolong was talking about the God of Creation, and thus replied, “Don’t worry, you’re already in the Divine Tuo Holy World. You’ll soon be able to see the God of Creation Lord.”

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a second, and then smiled silently without explaining anything. Instead, he asked, “Any news from the Spirit Devil Sacred Land’s side?”

“According to Patriarch Zhu Xu’s report, they have already formed a temporary alliance with Spirit Devil Sacred Land Patriarch as alliance chief, and Floating Petals Sacred Land Patriarch as vice alliance chief,” Fei Yanzi summarized as she handed the communication symbol to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong took the communication symbol and read the content inside it, and he was a little surprised. Then again, Spirit Devil Sacred Land, Floating Petals Sacred Land, Glory Armor Sacred Land, Ghost Knife Sacred Land, and the others forming an alliance after learning the news was a logical choice of action.

This newly formed alliance already had twenty-three sacred land members.

“The Spirit Devil Alliance’s main goal is to exterminate our Cangqiong Sacred Land.” Fei Yanzi stated simply, “Xiaolong, do you think we should make our move before them? Should we seize the chance when they still haven't completely unified? That way we’ll take them by surprise.”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and smilingly replied, “There is no rush. Let them form an alliance if they want to, and if they want to exterminate Cangqiong Sacred Land, just let them come.” It would save him the time running from one sacred land to another.

Huang Xiaolong truly wished they would come to attack Cangqiong Sacred Land with a great army from all twenty-two sacred lands like what Tang Long had done.

Fei Yanzi hadn’t expected that response, and she froze for a second. “You mean we’ll just wait for the twenty-two sacred lands to come with their armies?! But the Spirit Devil Alliance’s great army is definitely not what the three sacred lands’ armies can compare to!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly, “Our Cangqiong Sacred Land too is not what it used to be, don’t worry, I have a grasp of the situation.” His words were accompanied by strong confidence.

Fei Yanzi persuaded again, “Spirit Devil Patriarch is shrouded in mystery, and I suspect he is stronger than Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. He is very likely a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement as he had thought of this point as well.

Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor? All the better, he would be able to battle to his heart’s content.

Huang Xiaolong did not continue discussing the matter with Fei Yanzi, and started asking about the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s current situation. He had requested Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others to speed up the progress of expanding Cangqiong Sacred Land.

With the steady stream of resources taken from the three sacred lands’ treasuries, Cangqiong Sacred Land had been restored and was expanding rapidly.

The Cangqiong Sacred Land’s outline was changing everyday. It was progressing in every aspect from the spiritual energy’s richness to the buildings.

Since Spirit Devil Sacred Land had learned that Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land had joined his camp, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to act under the radar anymore. Thus, he sent the three sacred lands’ experts to Cangqiong Sacred Land to help with building more cities.

Huang Xiaolong even issued an order to Ice Blue Sacred Land Patriarch Hou Ting to send experts and disciples to help with Cangqiong Sacred Land’s constructions.
