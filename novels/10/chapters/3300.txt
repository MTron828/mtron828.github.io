Chapter 3301: Which Class Are You From?

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “If you say that I’m here to cause trouble, can you please tell me how I’m doing it? I didn’t scream and shout, and neither did I run about.”

The librarian was stunned for a second, but anger rose in her heart as she felt that he was looking down on her. She wanted to laugh, but she couldn’t as she was trying to scold him. Whatever the case, the man standing before her was in his mid-twenties, and there was a chance he was younger than her.

“Since I’m not causing trouble, you can leave now. Bye.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong with a face full of shock, she didn’t understand what he was trying to do.

“Which class are you from?!” The little lady widened her eyes and she stared at Huang Xiaolong in anger. “Hand over your identity plaque right now! Even though you’re not causing trouble, you’re affecting other people in the library!”

Snickering in his heart, Huang Xiaolong knew that she was definitely trying to mess with him. After glancing at the book in his hand, he placed it back onto the shelf. Turning back to her, he said, “Is there a rule stating that students have to hand over their identity plaques to the librarian in the library?”

“Oh right, there are so many people watching me as I read, and I feel a little distracted right now. Why don’t you chase them away instead?”

The librarian who was confronting Huang Xiaolong seethed in anger when she saw the smug look on his face.

“Hand your identity plaque over right now! Otherwise, I’ll kick you out of the library!” The librarian seemed to have made up her mind about it and she growled.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled to himself as he picked up another book. After glancing at it for a few seconds, he placed it back on the shelf. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The librarian reached out to grab Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders and she snapped, “Get out of the library right now!”

As a Third Level Foundation Building Realm expert, she was much stronger than Lu Fang.

Ordinarily, the librarians of the Eastern University weren’t weaklings! They were in the Foundation Building Realm in order to get rid of unruly students.

When she jerked her hand on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder, she realized that he was as steady as a mountain.

She gasped in shock.

“Little lady, members of the opposite sex shouldn’t touch each other without permission. It’s not good for you to be doing this in front of so many people, right?” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

With anger filling her heart, she circulated her true qi as she tried to throw Huang Xiaolong out of the library. However, she failed to budge him no matter how hard she tried. She couldn’t even make him take a single step back in retreat!

With rage rushing into her head, both her hands grabbed at Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s intention was to tease her, a frown formed on his face when he realized that she wasn’t going to give up. He casually pushed her away with a single strand of true qi. She slammed into one of the shelves behind them before falling on her butt.

It wasn’t a light fall and she quickly got to her feet. She felt the weird stares of the students around her, and she snapped at Huang Xiaolong, “You… You… You’re in trouble!”

Turning around, she rushed out of the library.

As soon as she left, the entire place erupted.

“Wow! Goddess Zhang Jiaying was actually struck away by someone! Am I seeing things?”

“What do you mean?! Yingying obviously fell on accident…”

Huang Xiaolong realized that she was someone pretty famous in the university when he heard the discussions flying about.

Ignoring the commotion around him, Huang Xiaolong returned to the books.

A moment later, a group of more than thirty administrators appeared behind Zhang Jiaying as she stormed towards Huang Xiaolong. The person in the lead was a silver-haired old man who was built like an ox.

The thirty of them surrounded Huang Xiaolong in a flash, and the old man growled, “I am the head librarian of the library. We do not welcome troublemakers, and I will have to ask you to leave right now.”

Troublemaker?

Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhang Jiaying and he sighed. It was obvious she tattled on him.

One of the male students sitting in the library sneered, “Hahaha! This should be the first time the head librarian personally appeared to kick a student out of the library!”

“Holy sh*t! Even students studying for their doctorate wouldn’t be enough to stand against the head librarian!”

Turning around to face the old man, Huang Xiaolong spoke in an emotionless voice, “I’ll give all of you three seconds to leave my sight. If you remain here to interrupt my reading session, I’ll kick all of you out of the library.”

?! Everyone stared at him in shock.

Hu Yunqiang, the head librarian, snorted in rage, “Do you really think you’re capable of doing that?! Humph! Even if you have the guts to pull a stunt like that, you have to be strong enough to back it up!”

As the head librarian, his status in the school wasn’t too low. Even the directors of the various schools would have to respect him. There weren’t too many people capable of taking him on in the school. After all, he had already reached the Ninth Level Golden Core Realm.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the old man as he continued to read his books.

With his expression sinking, Hu Yunqiang spoke to one of the administrators around him, “All of you, kick him out.”

All thirty of them made their move.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even move as he sent all of them flying. Hu Yunqiang and Zhang Jiaying suffered the same fate.

Every single one of them flew through the window as they slammed into the grass patch outside the library.

The students who witnessed the scene felt the world spinning around them.

The head librarian of the university was actually thrown out of the building!

Not a single student dared to approach Huang Xiaolong any longer as the sixth floor cleared out almost instantly.

A trace of tranquility settled in Huang Xiaolong’s heart now that no one else was there.

“Head Librarian, do we… Do we call the security team over?!” One of the librarians asked.

With his face as black as the bottom of a pot, Hu Yunqiang eventually shook his head. “We’ll look for the principal right now!”

Zhang Jiaying’s expression was extremely complicated. No matter how ignorant she was, she realized that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be a student with his cultivation base!

Only Nascent Soul Realm experts had the ability to do what he did! Of course, every single Nascent Soul Realm expert was part of the upper management of the school.

When she thought about how she wanted to kick Huang Xiaolong out of the library previously, a weird feeling would fill her heart.

Hu Yunqiang returned almost instantly.

Murong Qing was standing beside him, but a terrified expression could be seen on his face.
