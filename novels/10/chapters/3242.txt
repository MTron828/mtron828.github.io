Chapter 3243: Reborn From Ashes

Reborn from ashes!

It was exactly that, reborn from ashes!

Other than this sentence, Huang Datou could not think of a better description.

As Huang Datou watched the miracle taking place before him, a bright light appeared from inside of Huang Jiyuan’s body, spreading as it grew brighter, just like a diamond reflecting the radiant sunlight, emitting its own brilliance.

“This, this is? Seventh Level Foundation Building Realm!” Huang Datou’s eyes were bulging in shock. His grandfather’s cultivation, which had stuck for a long time, had actually advanced to the Seventh Level Foundation Building!

His grandfather had long entered Sixth Level Foundation Building thirty years ago, but his cultivation had been stuck at peak late-Sixth Level Foundation Building, and he was unable to break through to Seventh Level Foundation Building Realm. But now, in a short few breaths, his grandfather had advanced!

Huang Jiyuan’s heart jumped in fright that his cultivation suddenly advanced to Seventh Level Foundation Building Realm. Then, he stuttered excitedly, “I, I, I’ve finally advanced!”

Not a day had passed in the last thirty years that he had not wished that he could break through to the Seventh Level Foundation Building Realm, but he was disappointed every time. Seeing that he had finally broken through to the Seventh Level Foundation Building today, how could he not feel excited? How could he not be thrilled?

Huang Xiaolong grinned watching his father’s reaction and teased a little, “It’s just the Seventh Level Foundation Building Realm.”

Huang Jiyuan was stunned, failing to register the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words.

But very soon, he understood what Huang Xiaolong meant because, ten breaths later, his body emitted another burst of radiant light as his cultivation entered the Eighth Level Foundation Building!

He had broken through to the Eighth Level Foundation Building!

His originally shriveled-up meridians and veins widened once again and filled with vitality. No, not only were they filled with vitality, but they were literally surging great rivers!

Merely in a few breaths ah, the meridians’ and veins’ true essence had more than doubled!

Huang Datou’s eyes were as wide as they could be while he continued watching.

“This, can’t, can’t be true, r-right?” He had a hard time believing what was happening in front of him, and it was just too unbelievable.

His eldest uncle actually helped his grandfather to break through to Eighth Level Foundation Building from Sixth Level Foundation Building in a mere twenty breaths!

Looking at his father’s dazed expression, Huang Xiaolong smiled happily as he continued to channel energy into his father through his palm, and soon, Huang Jiyuan advanced again.

Ninth Level Foundation Building!

In the end, Huang Xiaolong stopped when Huang Jiyuan’s cultivation stopped at peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building.

At Huang Xiaolong’s strength and cultivation realm, he could raise Huang Jiyuan’s cultivation realm straight to Golden Core Realm without any problem, and the peak late- Ninth Level Foundation Building was nothing. However, condensing one’s golden core was an important step, Huang Xiaolong decided to let Huang Jiyuan adapt to his consecutive breakthroughs before helping him to advance to Golden Core Realm ten days later.

There were also distinctions between strong and weak Golden Core Realm cultivators on Earth. The higher the rank of one’s golden core, the higher one’s battle strength would be. Golden cores were divided into nine ranks, and the lowest rank was rank-one. However, above rank-nine golden cores, there were king-rank, monarch-rank, and the legendary immortal-rank golden core!

Huang Xiaolong planned to help Huang Jiyuan to condense an immortal-rank golden core a few days later!

This way, Huang Jiyuan would have hope of breaking through Immortal Realm!

The chances of advancing to Immortal Realm with an immoral-rank golden core was more than twice of a monarch-rank golden core.

Of course, Huang Jiyuan had no knowledge of Huang Xiaolong’s intention at all. He was still immersed in the ecstasy of breaking through to peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building. He looked at his body that had returned to the time when he was forty years old in disbelief. In truth, he was blown away, especially when he felt the roaring true essence in his veins as he exerted force.

“Xiaolong, I, I, I’ve advanced to the Ninth Level of Foundation Building?” Huang Jiyuan asked excitedly.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded. “Yes, it’s peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building!”

“I, I, really?! It’s real!” Huang Jiyuan didn’t know what to say.

Peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building Realm! He Hadn’t even dared to dream about this in the past, yet this was happening to him.

“Then, won’t I have hope of breaking through to Golden Core Realm in the future?” Huang Jiyuan asked Huang Xiaolong in the midst of his excitement.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. It’s more than having hope… It’s a hundred percent certainty.

He had strengthened and improved his father’s body just now, and even without his help in the future, his father would break through to Golden Core Realm within a year, and at the lowest achievement would be king-rank golden core. There would be no issue for his father in each Immortal Realm at all.

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t say these things to his father.

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Yes, father, you will have a chance of breaking through to Golden Core Realm after ten days. I will help you advance to the Golden Core Realm, and condense your golden core!”

“Ten, ten, ten days?! Condense golden core!” The excited Huang Jiyuan was taken aback.

Huang Datou was thrilled to see that Huang Jiyuan had advanced to peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building, but when he heard Huang Xiaolong say that he would help grandfather break through to Golden Core Realm after ten days, he too was taken aback.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded, “That’s right. Condense golden core after ten days, and your grandfather will be a Golden Core expert!”

Huang Jiyuan was dumbfounded.

“Xiao, Xiaolong, all these are really true!?” Huang Jiyuan still couldn’t believe what he had heard, feeling as if he was in a dream.

Everything that had happened that day was beyond Huang Jiyuan’s wildest imagination. He had dreamed of his son coming back many times in the past, but when he woke up, he felt sadder than ever.

Huang Xiaolong grinned and reassured his father, “Of course, it’s all real,” then he joked, “Tonight, you’re absolutely capable of ‘fighting’ three hundred rounds with mother!”

“You kid, you dare to make fun of your father now!” Huang Jiyuan scolded with mirth in his eyes. Then again, it was true that it had been a long time since he, ahem, had that.

Then, Huang Xiaolong finally saw his mother, Wang Meilan. Wang Meilan was even weaker than his father, she was already at the end of her lifespan and wouldn’t last another half a year. She didn’t even have the energy to speak, but when she saw Huang Xiaolong, it was obvious that she was extremely agitated, and her clouded eyes teared up immediately. Her lips parted but could only manage low, hoarse grunts. She was calling her son, but the words could not come out.

Huang Xiaolong caressed his mother’s hand, enduring his heartache, and began improving his mother’s body like what he had done with his father by widening her meridians and veins, and extending her lifespan. Before Huang Jiyuan and Huang Datou’s expectant gazes, Wang Meilan’s shrunken body began to fill up, her flesh and muscles returned, her skin was smooth and glowing. Her gray hair turned a shiny ebony, and her eyes became bright and clear.

Before long, Wang Meilan’s appearance was restored to her forties. She was a great beauty in her heyday, and now that her condition was restored, Huang Jiyuan was completely charmed.

The shadow of a dying old woman was nowhere to be seen, and in front of him was a beautiful, elegant, and mature woman!

Huang Xiaolong also helped his mother to advance until the peak of late-Ninth Level Foundation Building Realm before stopping.

Although Huang Jiyuan had experienced it himself, he was still startled watching Huang Xiaolong help Wang Meilan breakthrough to peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building.

Wang Meilan’s cultivation was only at the peak late-Third Level Foundation Building, but now she had already reached the peak late-Ninth Level Foundation Building.
