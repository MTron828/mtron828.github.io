Chapter 27: This is Truly Fair

A part of his strength? While everyone had yet to realize what Huang Xiaolong meant, suddenly a battle qi several times stronger than Huang Wei’s, gushed out of Huang Xiaolong’s body shooting straight up into the air. It was so strong that it was at least ten times stronger, or perhaps even more.

Everyone was dumbstruck and shivered as if they’d seen a ghost. The elders and housekeepers jumped up from their seats as if their butts were on fire.

“Fourth Order! He’s actually a Fourth Order warrior! God, a Fourth Order warrior ah!”

“Is this an illusion? No, it’s not! This isn’t an illusion!”

“Your mother*, why are you pinching me?” A disciple screamed shrilly having been pinched by the person next to him.

The entire hall became speechless with shock, and some even trembled with excitement as if they had suppressed it for too long.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, and even Huang Ming’s reaction was no different from the rest, they were stupefied!

Huang Qide’s eyes widened in shock, so great was the shock that his mind went blank as he stared at the stage, struggling to process what just happened.

“No, it’s impossible! You couldn’t have broken through to the Fourth Order stage. It’s impossible that you ran into some dog shit luck again!” Huang Wei cried out as if he’d lost his mind having succumbed to fear.

He couldn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would be lucky enough to come across good fortune a second time and breakthrough to Fourth Order!

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the frightened Huang Wei who was shouting like a mad man, and battle qi surged on his hands and with a loud ‘hong’, Huang Wei tumbled off the stage, wailing.

With just one step, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Huang Wei and mercilessly stomped on Huang Wei.

Huang Wei’s eyes brimmed with fear and fury as he growled, “I won’t accept this! I am the clan’s real genius! Why? Why is it that you dog of-a-thing keep running into dog-shit luck surpassing me?”

“Genius? Dog of-a-thing?” Huang Xiaolong stared coldly at Huang Wei. Then, he suddenly sent a brutal kick at Huang Wei’s stomach, and the impact and pain sent Huang Wei rolling to the edge of the stage in pain.

Huang Wei moaned pitifully as he lay on the ground.

At this point, the people in the audience recovered from their shock and started to react.

Huang Ming’s fists clenched tight as he looked at his son on the stage; his eyes gleamed with a scary coldness, but somehow, he managed to endure it.

Huang Qide’s eyes flickered as he looked at his grandson Huang Xiaolong– could it be like Huang Wei said, that Huang Xiaolong stumbled upon some dog-shit luck again and swallowed some elixir to advance to Fourth Order?

As these thoughts crossed Huang Qide’s mind, Huang Wei slowly stood up, his body quivering with the effort. His eyes burned with hatred, glaring at Huang Xiaolong he said, “You will die!” as he lunged at Huang Xiaolong like an injured beast.

Watching Huang Wei lunge at him, a cold light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and when Huang Wei was within arm’s reach, he used both hands and struck Huang Wei’s arms.

“Ka-cha!” The sound of broken bones rippled through the hall.

Just as Huang Wei started to scream in pain, Huang Xiaolong kicked at Huang Wei’s legs and the sound of broken bones echoed through the hall again.

But he didn’t stop there; his palms covered battle qi hit Huang Wei squarely on the chest and ‘bang’ every scrap of clothing on Huang Wei body burst into pieces.

Huang Wei’s body flew out of the stage and landed heavily on the ground, naked as a newborn without even a strip of clothing on him.

“Wei’er!” Huang Ming’s voice bellowed with anger, he leapt up and rushed towards Huang Wei. When he got to Huang Wei, he saw his son coughing up blood nonstop and the bones of his arms and legs broken.

His heart ached and became filled with fury when he saw his son’s condition, he gave Huang Wei to Elder Zhou who was beside him and ordered, “Look after the Young Lord!” After he said that, Huang Ming turned around and leapt onto the stage, and killing intent spilled out from his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong and walked towards him, “You are very cruel!”

Huang Xiaolong had an indifferent expression as Huang Ming walked toward him. Earlier on, when Huang Wei threatened to break both his arms, how come Huang Ming didn’t say his son was very cruel? And during last year’s Clan Assembly Huang Xiaolong already spared Huang Wei once by not breaking his arms then. But, he didn’t expect Huang Wei to retaliate on his sister Huang Min and little brother Huang Xiaohai!

This time Huang Xiaolong would not be so lenient!

Huang Xiaolong shifted his gaze towards his Grandfather on the main podium and said in an icy voice. “During the Clan Assembly’s disciple sparring, no one can interfere. Otherwise, they will be dealt with according to the clan’s rules! Grandfather, this is what you said earlier, right?”

Huang Qide was embarrassed, but he did not answer.

Seeing his reaction, Huang Xiaolong sneered and said sarcastically, “Why is it that when my dad made a move, you insisted on enforcing the clan’s rules, but now Huang Ming interfered and, Grandfather, you are turning a blind eye? This is really fair!”

All the elders and housekeepers remained silent.

“Impudent!” Huang Qide embarrassment turned into anger and his palm slammed onto a chair beside him.

Huang Ming seeing his father’s attitude stopped worrying; his icy eyes fell on Huang Xiaolong, he said: “You broke my Wei’er’s arms and legs, and now I will break both of your arm and legs!” The battle qi of a late-Seventh Order warrior released at full scale, and he sent palm strikes at Huang Xiaolong’s arms.

“Xiaolong!” Just as Huang Peng wanted to leap up the stage, another silhouette acted faster than him. In the blink of an eye, the silhouette stood before Huang Xiaolong and used both arms to counter Huang Ming’s palms.

“Pooh!” In front of everyone, Huang Ming spat out mouthfuls of blood. His body flew out from the stage and crashed onto the ground, breaking a countless number of chairs as he slid to a stop.

“What?!” Eyes widened in shocked at they looked at Huang Ming, who lay on the ground, blood spurting out from his mouth, unable to lift a pinky.

All eyes darted towards the silhouette that stood before Huang Xiaolong.

“It’s, it’s him?!”

“Him? How could it be?”

When the residents of Huang Clan Manor saw the person who blocked Huang Ming’s attack, they couldn’t believe it’s actually the servant Huang Xiaolong bought?!

Huang Qide, Huang Peng, Su Yan and all present almost dropped their eyes.

Since he was able to counter Huang Ming’s attack with just one move, this man definitely had the strength of an Eighth Order warrior! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Eighth Order!

Fei Hou turned towards Huang Xiaolong and respectfully asked, ‘Young Master, are you alright?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. “I’m alright.” When he said that, he looked at Huang Ming who was struggling to get up using a chair as a crutch. His eyes burned with hatred but there’s also fear.

“Father!” Huang Ming called out, his voice sounded hoarse, and without warning, he coughed up another mouthful of blood.

Huang Qide jolted out of his shock and flew onto the stage, his voice was calm, as his eyes bored into Fei Hou. “I didn’t expect that you were a hidden master, but your actions are an insult, not putting our Huang Clan Manor in your eyes, you injured my child right in front of me!”

Huang Qide conveniently overlooked the truth! If wasn’t for Huang Ming breaking clan’s rules, and then insisted to cripple Huang Xiaolong’s arms and legs, why would Fei Hou have acted? And yet he stood there and made it seem that it was all Fei Hou’s fault.

Fei Hou ignored Huang Qide, indifferent and silent he stood guard behind Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Qide, seeing that Fei Hou ignored him, became angry and he shouted, “Speak? What is your purpose lurking for within my Huang Clan Manor? If you speak up now, I will have mercy, and spare your life. Otherwise, it will be hard even to wish for death to come!”

Even though Fei Hou had injured Huang Ming with a single palm strike, Huang Qide wasn’t perturbed; he felt that although Fei Hou was not weak, at most, he’d only be a late-Eighth Order warrior.
