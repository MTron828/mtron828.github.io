Chapter 2446: Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms

Zhang Yihui and the rest of Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s experts were thrilled to watch Fang Xing’s attack land on Huang Xiaolong without suspense. However, Zhang Yihui turned to Duan Xuan, and asked with concern, “Master, Junior Brother Fang Xing wouldn’t have killed Huang Xiaolong with one punch, right?”

Duan Xuan shook his head, smiling as he answered, “Don’t you worry. Your Junior Brother Fang Xing is well measured in his action. Huang Xiaolong has two complete dao saint godheads, two saint physiques, and two saint bloodlines, that attack would only give him heavy injuries, and render him incapacitated, but it won’t take his life!”

Zhang Yihui’s nerves relaxed upon hearing that.

If Huang Xiaolong were to really die there, the four Primal Ancestors’ wrath was not something their Ancient Emperor Holy Ground could afford despite having Mo Cangli and that mysterious expert backing them.

“Aren’t you guys celebrating too early?” A nonchalant lazy voice suddenly came from the stage.

This voice sounded so familiar that everyone was dazed for a second.

Fang Xing, who was laughing at Huang Xiaolong, the future’s strongest person of the Holy World, choked on his own laughter. He spun around and saw Huang Xiaolong slightly shaking his shoulder. The remaining power of the Ancient Emperor’s Great Dao Fist shattered into smithereens, revealing an uninjured Huang Xiaolong.

Upon seeing Huang Xiaolong standing tall like an immovable mountain on the same spot as if he had barely budge an inch, Fang Xing was bewildered, “You... are fine?!”

The spectating experts were just as bewildered, and a tide of commotion swept over the crowd.

In the dark, the worried expression on Lin Xiaoying’s face became one of baffled confusion.

Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi exchanged a baffled look as well, seemingly asking each other what was going on in silence.

Duan Xuan frowned, whereas Xie Bufan, Li Chen, Shen Jiewen, and the others were pleasantly surprised. Just a moment ago, they had thought that Huang Xiaolong was done for under Fang Xing’s initial attack, and they had lost their chance to get the grandmist holy spiritual aura. They could only look on enviously as it fell into the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s hands. But it seemed like they still had a chance, a very good chance!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s Fang Xing and snickered. His hand lightly patted his chest where Fang Xing’s fists had struck earlier as he asked, “You think I should be injured? Your punch is too weak. You’re helping me scratch an itch?”

Scratch an itch?

Faces in the crowd turned strange.

It was clear to everyone present that Fang Xing’s attack was definitely not weak. If it was another Second Tribulation half-True Saint, who was hit with that punch, he would probably be reduced to meat paste. Even someone with a complete dao saint godhead in the top one hundred, wouldn’t be able to take on that attack unharmed.

Since it was not Fang Xing’s attack that was weak, it meant...?!

Hearing that, Fang Xing’s face burned with shame, but he soon regained composure and sneered at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, don’t act so smug. That punch was merely a warm-up for me. Next, I’ll show you how powerful my fists are!”

His body once again burst out in bright rays of light, and they were even more blinding than before. The Ancient Holy Emperor True Body Manifestation above his head was rotating at high speed on the spot, sending out ever increasingly intense light as Fang Xing’s momentum exploded.

Fang Xing’s palms were emitting blinding rays of light, and they seemed translucent, resembling golden crystallized jade.

“Can this be the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s most powerful technique, the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms?!”

Some experts in the crowd exclaimed, while others sucked in a breath of cold air after hearing that.

The Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms was known as the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s most powerful offensive technique. There were rumors that said that this technique was created by the first generation Ancient Holy Emperor Nie Ri, while some said Nie Ri had obtained this technique in the early stages of the Holy World’s formation inside a secret realm. Although there were different versions of how the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms had appeared, everyone acknowledged one point unanimously that the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palm’s power was terrifying.

There were numerous holy grounds in the vast Holy World, and even more top-tier as well as first-tier forces, yet the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms was listed into the Holy World’s top ten strongest holy martial arts.

One of the Holy World’s strongest holy martial arts!

This was a testament of its power!

According to the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground, only the generations of Patriarchs were allowed to cultivate this holy martial art, and clearly, Duan Xuan had passed the know-how to Fang Xing!

No one had expected that in order to win the grandmist holy spiritual aura by winning the stage battle, Duan Xuan was willing to teach Fang Xing the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms.

Zhang Yihui too was shocked by this fact, and at the same time, jealousy brewed in the depth of his eyes. Though he was the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s chief Holy Prince, his Master Duan Xuan and ancestor had yet to pass this technique to him.

A technique that he, the chief of Holy Princes, had not yet learned, but Fang Xing had already mastered!

Xie Bufan’s expression darkened in an instant, “Duan Xuan that old fox. He even passed the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms to Fang Xing in order to win the challenge on stage this time!”

Dou Rui’s jubilant mood fell as well, “The Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms is said to be capable of incinerating sun and moon, reducing everything into nothingness. As amazing as Huang Xiaolong’s defenses might be, he won’t be able to remain unscathe after this attack!”

Shen Jiewen, Li Chen, Zhan Zhiyuan, and the rest were celebrating that Huang Xiaolong had survived Fang Xing’s attack, but now, their faces were deathly sullen as they saw that Fang Xing was using his trump card, the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms.

The jubilant smiles on their faces had long vanished without a trace.

“Lord Grand Hall Master, His Highness Huang Xiaolong is in grave danger. Do we take action?” The Holy Heavens Law Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master Shi Feng had to ask Wu Ge, “If something happens to His Highness Huang Xiaolong...?!”

Originally, after seeing that Huang Xiaolong had easily withstood Fang Xing’s initial attack unscathed, pride had filled them. But now, all of them were anxious like ants on a hot pan, it’s the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms they were talking about now! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

One of the Holy World’s top ten most powerful holy martial arts!

Probably not even a Seventh Tribulation half-True Saint Realm could withstand the impact of this strike, then Huang Xiaolong was a mere Second Tribulation half-True Saint.

Wu Ge’s eyes glimmered like he was really pondering whether they should take action to stop the rest of the stage battles, but he shook his head in the end. If he interfered, how could the Holy Heavens uphold their prestige in the future? What prestige can Huang Xiaolong uphold?

Today was the first day of the stage battle, and this was only the first match. If he abruptly stopped the battle, Huang Xiaolong would definitely be reduced to a laughing stock, becoming someone who did not keep his word, and he would be mocked as a coward.

In the dark, Lin Xiaoying nervously clenched her small hands and her entire body’s nerves were strung tightly as she watched Huang Xiaolong with worried eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, you still have time to admit defeat now.” Fang Xing rose to midair, peering down at Huang Xiaolong in a condescending manner, “Once I strike out with my Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms, I can’t control the extent of its destructive power.”

Huang Xiaolong responded with a nonchalant smile, “Well, I am very interested to experience the power of one of the Holy World’s top ten holy martial arts. I hope you don’t disappoint me by giving me another back scratch.”

Some of the disciples below the stage erupted in laughter.

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong was looking down on him to such an extent, and looking down on the Boundless Sun, Golden Disk Palms, Fang Xing raged, “You’re so dead! Fine, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

The golden light gathered around his palms and roiled like tidal waves.

In the next moment, Fang Xing bellowed at the top of his lungs as his palms pushed forward, straight at Huang Xiaolong. The golden lights resembled a great sea and it flooded forth, the pressure shook the space, causing it to distort.

At this moment it was as if every corner of the Mirage Pavilion was quaking.

The world-shaking golden sea with blinding rays of golden light, shot out, burning holes through the surrounding space like a sheet of white paper mottled with burns.

There seemed to be hundreds and thousands of suns gestating in the overwhelming golden sea of light, spinning at high speed, captivating all eyes.
