Chapter 3050: Changes in the Heavens Burial Lands

Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised, hearing Lei Yu's request to battle.

Lei Yu explained, “In the past, I gave that brat some guidance in his cultivation, but in these past years, because of his rise in strength, his wings have grown hard. Since he can’t see properly with his eyes, then, I, who was half a master to him, will teach him a lesson on Your Highness’ behalf.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he looked at Lei Yu meaningfully. “Alright then, you will accept the battle challenge.”

Lei Yu then ordered the Nine Vision Creed’s experts to spread the news.

“What? That young man’s beast mount? The Golden Fox Dao Venerable is not qualified to challenge His Highness, so he would accept the Golden Fox Dao Venerable’s challenge!”

“That’s too much, there’s no end to that young man’s arrogance! A beast mount actually dares to think of battling the Golden Fox Dao Venerable?! Who does that three-headed beast think he is? Is he qualified to battle the Golden Fox Dao Venerable?”

Some people cried foul.

“I feel it’s ludicrous and unbelievable. In the whole Origin Holy World, only our Origin Holy World’s Lord World Master is qualified, right? Hope that young man is not thinking that he’s our Origin Holy World’s World Master, is he?” some people mocked.

When the news that Lei Yu would accept Golden Fox Dao Venerable Jin Hongyuan’s challenge spread, the entire Golden Fox Heavenly Cave was mocking Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu’s naive arrogance.

Almost everyone was clamoring for the Golden Fox Dao Venerable to destroy Lei Yu, and destroy the Leiyu Creed.

When Jin Hongyuan heard the reply, he blanked for a good while.

“That beast mount of his is going to accept the challenge?” Jin Hongyuan asked Li Xu for confirmation, “Are you sure the news is accurate?”

Li Xu nodded and replied respectfully, “It is accurate, Lord. The news was released by the Nine Vision Creed’s Eminent Elders.”

Another senior commander present was enraged. “That punk’s really brazen. A nameless junior like him being challenged by our Lord, he should be honored and thanking his lucky stars that the Lord is raising his reputation, but he’s actually going to let his beast mount face the challenge?!”

Li Xu voiced his opinion, “I think that brat knows he’s no match against the Lord, so he sends out his beast mount to accept the challenge. After all, he’s only an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and killing him is a matter of a fraction of a second for our Lord. He’s scared, it’s normal.”

Other experts of Golden Fox Creed chimed in in agreement.

Jin Hongyuan snorted, “There is no difference since we’re going to deal with all of them anyways. So it doesn’t matter who accepted the challenge.”

“But this only pushes the brat’s reputation higher!” another senior commander complained, feeling wronged.

“It’s fine,” Jin Hongyuan waved his hand. “They are all dead people.”

There was no need to calculate profit or loss with dead people.

The Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s experts had another hot topic when they learned Jin Hongyuan had actually agreed to Huang Xiaolong’s beast mount answering his challenge.

Although the date of the battle between Jin Hongyuan and Lei Yu was three months later, the moment the news spread, many experts had already started to rush towards the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s highest peak.

A great expert on the Extermination List like Jin Hongyuan rarely battled, especially in public. Therefore, being able to spectate the battle challenge was rare in tens of thousands of years.

Hence, merely a few days after news of the challenge spread, wave after wave of battle ships arrived, crowding the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s highest peak.

…..

The Nine Vision Creed Headquarters.

Inside the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged under the Tree of Beginning and Parasol Tree, and then took out the strand of origin qi and the Phoenix Fire Crystal he had bought from the auction.

There were three months until the day of the battle challenge, and this time was sufficient for Huang Xiaolong to refine the strand of origin qi and Phoenix Fire Crystal.

It would take others several thousand years, even tens of thousands of years to refine one strand of origin qi, but for him, to refine both items was only a matter of two to three months.

The strand of origin qi wrapped around Huang Xiaolong, and the Phoenix Fire Crystal’s energy swirled above his head.

Huang Xiaolong began circulating the Soaring Dragon Art, and immediately, waves of origin energy and origin laws flowed out from the strand of origin qi, while the Phoenix Fire Crystal’s nirvana power rained down, entering Huang Xiaolong’s body harmoniously.

At the same time, the beginning qi and power of nirvana poured out from the Tree of Beginning and Parasol Tree.

A hazy veil of energy enshrouded Huang Xiaolong as he continued to absorb the beginning qi and power of nirvana, and the surface of his skin glistened with a crimson glow.

In the blink of an eye, two months went by.

There were ten days until the day of the battle between Lei Yu and Jin Hongyuan, and at this point, Huang Xiaolong had finished refining the strand of origin qi and Phoenix Fire Crystal. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

……

Although there were ten days until the day of the battle, the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s highest peak was already crowded with experts from various forces. The Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s thirty-eight top-tier creeds’ patriarchs were fully present. Of course, the Leiyu Creed’s Zhou Hong, Tan Hua, Sui Hengyi, and Nine Vision Creed Patriarch Li Shen were the only exceptions.

Among the many flying ships, there was one particularly eye-catching black flying ship that exuded a chilling aura. This was the Concealing Heaven Creed’s flying ship.

Heaven generally refers to the heaven’s will, and one could imagine how domineering the founder was to name the creed 'concealing heaven’.

Fan Luo was standing on the bow of this flying ship, with his back straight as he looked at the highest peak in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave. Light flickered in the depths of his eyes as his thoughts wandered.

“Luo’er, what are you thinking about?” A stalwart-built middle-aged man asked as he approached in energetic strides. This middle-aged man was almost four meters tall, with thick arms and huge palms.

“Father,” Seeing the middle-aged man, Luo Fan greeted respectfully.

The middle-aged man was the Concealing Heaven Creed’s patriarch, Fan Yihui, also the second strongest person in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave.

Fan Yihui nodded smilingly. “Thinking about the upcoming battle?”

Fan Luo suddenly said, “Father, do you really think the final winner is going to be the Golden Fox Dao Venerable?”

Fan Yihui was more than a little surprised by his son’s question. He looked at his son for a moment then chuckled softly, “Don’t tell me you think that young man’s beast mount could win? That young man’s beast mount might really be strong, but compared with the Golden Fox Dao Venerable, there is no comparison between the two at all. How should I put it? Even if there’s ten of me, I still am no match against the Golden Fox Dao Venerable.”

Fan Luo’s eyes widened in shock. “The Golden Fox Dao Venerable is so strong?!”

Fan Yihui’s pensive gaze looked into the horizon as he explained, “You have never seen experts on the Extermination List battle, so you have no idea of their might, not to mention, the Golden Fox Dao Venerable ranked sixtieth on the Extermination List! This level of existence is far beyond your scope of current understanding.”

Though his son, Fan Luo, was hailed as the most talented genius amongst the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s younger generation, some even said that his son’s strength had caught up to him, but Fan Yihui knew that there was still some gap before that. As for comparing his son to existences on the Extermination List, that was even further away.

Fan Yihui shook his head. “That young man and his beast mount must not have seen the might of an expert on the Extermination List. That’s why they dare to provoke the Golden Fox Dao Venerable. Otherwise, give him ten thousand times the courage, he won’t have the guts to accept the challenge.”

Fan Luo’s brows creased into furrows, recalling the time he had seen Huang Xiaolong at the auction. Is it really like what father says?

Out of nowhere, a thunderous boom traveled across space, like a lightning bolt of wrathful divine punishment from heavens. The entire Golden Fox Heavenly Cave shook from it.

Fan Yihui, Fan Luo, and all the experts aboard felt their heads buzzing, and all of them looked towards the source of the noise in alarm.

“The loud noise came from the Heavens Burial Lands?!” Fan Yihui’s gaze passed through space and time, and looked into the Heaven Burial Lands that were outside of the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave.

“Heavens Burial Lands!” Fan Luo exclaimed, and his face paled slightly

“There must be a great change taking place in the Heavens Burial Lands!” There was curiosity and bewilderment on Fan Yihui’s face. “Nothing else can explain such a loud noise, the shockwaves even reach the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, and probably other neighboring heavenly caves too!”
