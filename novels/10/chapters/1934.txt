“That’s right! Huang Xiaolong, the Wangu Clan, the You Family, Yan Family, Beitang Family, and more than a hundred superpowers have all joined forces. Several hundred thousand experts are rushing here as we speak.” Elder Chen Xinghui yelled at Huang Xiaolong. “No matter how strong you are, you won’t be able to fight against the combined strength of over a hundred superpowers!”

“As long as you release President Wangu, we’ll try our best to plead for mercy on the Huang Family’s behalf. After all, you were once the president of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. We will try to keep you alive as well!”

Elder Chen Xinghui’s voice was cold, and it didn’t seem like he was begging for mercy. It looked like he was threatening Huang Xiaolong instead.

When the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter.

“Plead for mercy for the Huang Family?”

“Keep me alive?”

It was as though he had heard the funniest thing in all his years of existence. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t stop laughing as his laughter traveled through the entire plaza.

It seemed as though his reputation had degraded after he had left the lower worlds. He no longer had the prestige he once had!

Even though Chen Xinghui knew about his identity, he dared to address Wangu Wudi as the president of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union! He didn’t even kneel when seeing Huang Xiaolong!

Not only that... He even dared to address Huang Xiaolong by name. Even worse, he even bragged with Huang Xiaolong’s life on the line!

When Sun Man, who was kneeling before Huang Xiaolong, heard what the others said, his expressions changed. A terrified look appeared on his face.

Even though Chen Xinghui, Yan Jinwen, and You Wuguang didn’t know how terrifying Huang Xiaolong was, Sun Man was different.

He knew that Huang Xiaolong was a terrifying character. Huang Xiaolong was a monster in his eyes.

When Wangu Wudi, whose heart had been beaten out by Huang Xiaolong, heard what the elders said, he started to chuckle sinisterly. “Huang Xiaolong, did you hear that? Right now, you should release me. Get down on your knees and beg me to spare your life. Based on your previous identity as the president of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, I might just spare your life.”

He paused for a moment before continuing, “I know that you want nothing more than to kill me. However, have you thought of the consequences? As soon as I die, all the experts I have gathered will spare no expense to exterminate the Huang Family. Do you really think that all your troubles will end with my death? You’re too naive!”

“Hahaha, Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck cares if you’re the strongest individual? Do you really think that you will be able to stand against the combined power of all the families under me?”

Wangu Wudi laughed till his voice went hoarse.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong said. “Several hundred thousand experts? I thought that you would be able to gather several hundred million of them. Whatever! As long as I’m here, so what if I have to go against the entire world?”

A horrifying aura burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and it enveloped Divine Dan City.

Under Huang Xiaolong’s boundless aura, the city started to shake.

As long as I’m here, so what if I have to go against the entire world? Everyone present stared at Huang Xiaolong’s lone figure standing in the middle of the air.

Wangu Wudi was stunned for a minute, but louder laughter ensued. He laughed at Huang Xiaolong’s overconfidence, naivety, and his ridiculous line of thought!

However, he wasn’t done laughing when Huang Xiaolong’s flicked his wrist. He tore Wangu Wudi’s head from his neck, and the laughter stopped.

Wangu Wudi’s smile turned stiff on his face.

Everyone stared at the head in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and a look of shock appeared on their faces. That’s Wangu Wudi’s head!

When the elders from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union who were threatening Huang Xiaolong just a moment ago saw what he did, a look of astonishment and rage flashed in their eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, you...! How dare you kill President Wangu?!” You Wuguang raged. “Just wait for your Huang Family to be exterminated!”

Huang Xiaolong ignored him and threw Wangu Wudi’s head to the members of the Huang Family behind him. “Master, Xiaohai, you can deal with the head as you see fit.”

How would the Ascending Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaohai, and the others fail to notice the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words?

“Little brat, don’t worry about us. We’ll take care of his head really well!” The Ascending Moon Old Man’s booming laughter shook the hearts of everyone present.

“Shhhhhhhhhhhh!”

All of a sudden, the sound of flowing water entered the ears of everyone present.

Under the dumbfounded gaze of countless spectators, the Ascending Moon Old Man urinated on Wangu Wudi’s head. Urine splattered everywhere, and he made a huge mess.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had ripped off Wangu Wudi’s head, his life force was immense. Hence, Wangu Wudi hadn’t died immediately. Howls of rage filled the air.

Of course, that was the stupidest thing he could have done when the Ascending Moon Old Man was urinating on him. As soon as he opened his mouth, stinky liquid entered his mouth and nearly choked him to death.

“This is the best! This is the best I’m telling you!” The Ascending Moon Old Man’s booming laughter shook the world.

Elder You Wuguang stared at the scene in shock, and he continued to yell. “This is preposterous! Ascending Moon Old Man, you and all the Huang Family disciples will die a horrible death! You’ll pay the price several folds over!”

“Hurry up! Save President Wangu Wudi!” You Wuguang’s yell broke everyone out of their stupor. He took the lead and rushed towards the Ascending Moon Old Man while the rest of the elders followed him.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong sent him flying before he could approach the old man. With a single slap from Huang Xiaolong, You Wuguang tumbled through the air as he spat mouthful after mouthful of fresh blood.

Huang Xiaolong’s body blurred, and every time he reappeared, an elder was sent flying.

Yan Jinwen was the next, followed by Chen Xinghui. The other elders were sent flying soon after.

When they landed on the ground, their bodies had already split apart, and their organs had turned into mush.

When the other elders of superfamilies saw what had happened to the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s elders, they threw caution to the wind and rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and a thousand arms appeared behind him.

“Godly Xumi Art!”

Sun Man, who was still kneeling on the ground, screamed in shock.

As soon as the words left his lips, the arms behind Huang Xiaolong started to move.

“Divine Dragon’s Fifteenth Move!”

“Asura Blade Art!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Asura Demon Claws!”

“Soul Breaking Finger!”

“Divine Void Fist!”

Boom!

Radiance erupted from his body as the entire city was lit up. Under Huang Xiaolong’s bombardment, the city shook once again.

The Leng Family Patriarch and the others saw a scene that would stick with them for the rest of their life. Divine dragons soared through the skies, and blades formed like the wind. A terrifying devil that seemed to have crawled out from hell appeared before them, and countless golden palms covered the sky.

Everyone who surrounded Huang Xiaolong revealed unrestrained fear in their eyes as a sense of hopelessness washed over them. They were swallowed by the magnificent attacks Huang Xiaolong unleashed.

In an instant, bodies shattered and exploded in midair. They disappeared in the next instant as though they had never existed.

Even though there were no longer any opponents, the light that Huang Xiaolong emitted burned bright. It only disappeared after a minute.

As soon as the light dissipated, the Leng Family Patriarch and the rest felt their hearts stop. They stared at the scene before them and realized that Huang Xiaolong had practically leveled the plaza before them. Even the structures surrounding the plaza had turned into a fine dust. As for thousands of experts who had dared to launch their attack on him, they were nowhere to be seen.
