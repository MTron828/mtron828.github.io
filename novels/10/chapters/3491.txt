Chapter 3492: Submerged Dragon Institution

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised to hear that no one could locate the Star Dragon Essence. In the past, the Yin Yang Universe Spiritual Vein in the Ice Palace was equally as elusive.

“It doesn’t matter. It’s on us if we fail to find the Star Dragon Essence,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Nodding slightly, Ao Wen brought out a transmission symbol and branded the location of the Star Dragon Essence before handing it over to Huang Xiaolong.

When he looked at the location, Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise. Submerged Dragon Institution!

“Submerged Dragon Institution?” Huang Xiaolong handed the symbol over to Huang Long and the old man was equally as shocked.

They might not have been in the Star Dragon Universe for long, but they knew about the Submerged Dragon Institution.

The Submerged Dragon Institution was created by a God of Creation in the Star Dragon Universe called Yu Long, and experts of the Star Dragon Universe could only enter the institution after passing a series of tests.

Only the top geniuses of the younger generation could enter the Submerged Dragon Institution. Even several Gods of Creation born in the Star Dragon Universe were once students of the Submerged Dragon Institution.

The Star Dragon Universe had a common saying that even if one could offend the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire, they couldn’t afford to offend the Submerged Dragon Institution.

If one offended the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire, then they would have to face the wrath of the empire. However, offending the Submerged Dragon Institution meant that they would offend half the Star Dragon Universe! Even the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire had to hold the Submerged Dragon Institution in high regard.

A frown started to form on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he learned the location of the Star Dragon Essence.

Moreover, Ao Wen didn’t mention where the Star Dragon Essence might be in the Submerged Dragon Institution. The Submerged Dragon Institution spanned the size of half the Bearded Dragon World, and he would need several years if he wanted to comb the place from top to bottom!

Huang XIaolong looked at Ao Wen, and she got the message instantly. However, she could only shake her head helplessly. “I only know where the Star Dragon Essence might be.”

Huang Xiaolong sighed. It made sense. After all, if she knew where the Star Dragon Essence was, she wouldn’t have told him. She would comb the area herself.

Soon, he handed the dragon marrow over.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong and the others left. When they left the entrance, they saw a group of experts charging towards Ao Wen’s palace. There were several thousand of them, and Ao Wen’s face changed when she saw the person leading them. He was her second brother, Ao Guang. He had always been extremely domineering, and he wouldn’t accept other people’s opinions. Ao Wen was only wary of two people in the entire family, and he was one of them! The other was her oldest brother!

It was clear that he came to cause trouble now that he brought so many people along with him.

Huang Xiaolong was completely impassive. They were definitely there for the dragon marrow he possessed.

Very quickly, the men brought by the second prince, Ao Guang, arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

“Second Brother, is there a reason you brought so many experts to my palace?” Ao Wen’s expression wasn’t friendly.

A chuckle left his lips, “Third Sister, I heard that you managed to invite an esteemed guest over to your palace. I came here to take a look at the person. Why don’t you do the introductions?”

He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong and the others after speaking to Ao Wen.

Everyone could understand the meaning behind his words.

However, his eyes lit up when he saw Wang Meiqi.

If Huang Xiaolong wasn’t able to resist taking a second look at the beauty when he saw her back in the Yin Yang Road of Death, there wasn’t much to say about Ao Guang.

“And this beauty is…” Ao Guang grinned.

Wang Meiqi snorted coldly when she noticed Ao Guang’s lecherous gaze on her. Her snort was like a clap of heavenly thunder in his ears. He was forced to retreat, and he slammed into countless experts before finally crashing into the wall behind him. Everyone saw blood dripping down his face.

The experts in Ao Wen’s palace and those brought by Ao Guang were shocked. Ao Guang was an expert who had reached perfection in all thirteen elements! Even though he only had several million units of grand cosmos energy, he wasn’t a pushover! Now, a snort from Wang Meiqi sent him flying!

Ao Wen and the maidservants felt their brains buzzing in shock. They didn’t expect her to be so strong. When Ao Wen thought about how she was pulling Wang Meiqi around and addressing her as her ‘big sister’, her throat went dry.

“You!” Ao Guang forced himself to his feet, and he stared at her with fear in his eyes. He was lusting over her previously, but now, nothing was left in his heart but endless terror.

As they witnessed her strength, no one on Ao Guang’s side dared to make a move. They looked at the second prince to await his orders.

“Who are you?!” Ao Guang roared at Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long.

Wang Meiqi seemed to be their follower, and he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “You shouldn’t even be thinking of obtaining the dragon marrow in my hands. If you take your slaves and get out of my sight right now, you might be able to keep your life.”

The experts Ao Guang brought along with him flew into a fit of rage when they heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed them.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There were countless experts who had reached perfection level in all thirteen elements among them, and they had never suffered such grievances!

“Second Prince, give the order and we’ll kill them like the dogs they are!”

“Second Prince, please give the order!”

The strongest experts among them pleaded with the prince, and they wanted nothing more than to kill Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Wang Meiqi’s power frightened them, they had several thousand experts on their side! They refused to believe that they couldn’t suppress three random people Ao Wen found.

A sinister look appeared on Ao Guang’s face.

“Second Brother…”

Before Ao Wen could complete her sentence, Ao Guang roared, “Kill them all!”

The experts he brought with him moved in unison, and they charged at Huang Xiaolong’s party of three.

Looks of disdain could be seen on their faces as they saw Huang Xiaolong as a dead man.

With his tyrannical attitude, Ao Guang and his men had never felt so disrespected in their life!

Moreover, they were in the Bearded Dragon Palace! Even if Huang Xiaolong was the Son of Creation of other celestial empires, he wouldn’t dare to do a thing to them in the Bearded Dragon Palace!

Or so he thought.

As the experts lunged at Huang Xiaolong’s group of three, Ao Wen and the others noticed that the time around them seemed to slow down by thousands of times. It was as though they were trying to move about in quicksand.

The power contained in their strikes was frozen in time.

Huang Xiaolong, Huang Long, and Wang Meiqi looked at the group of experts stuck in time and they didn’t move a muscle. Even so, the thousands of experts brought by Ao Guang started to explode. One by one, they turned into a mist of blood.

Even those who had comprehended thirteen elements to the perfection level were no exception. All of them died!

Ao Wen, Ao Guang, and those who weren’t involved stared in shock.

In ten breaths of time, all the experts Ao Guang brought along with him disappeared. A faint red mist lingered in the air around them.

Ao Guang felt a chill running down his spine, and he felt the blood in his veins turning cold.
