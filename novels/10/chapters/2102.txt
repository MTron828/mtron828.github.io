Chapter 2103: Look For Me. I’m Called Huang Xiaolong

When Sui Wenhui and Steward Peng saw the stone tablet’s transformation on the ground, they couldn’t help but stare at it with their jaws agape.

The stone tablet was something one of the Su Family’s old ancestors had obtained by chance. After obtaining it, he had felt that there was something strange about the tablet. Hence, he had started to research it. No matter how hard he had tried, he had failed to detect anything strange from the tablet.

In the end, he had decided to bury the stone tablet in front of the pavilion. He had allowed his disciples to meditate before the tablet and even laid down the order to heavily reward any disciple who managed to comprehend anything about the tablet!

Not only Sui Wenhui, even Steward Peng had tried to obtain enlightenment from the tablet, but they had failed!

Right now, they witnessed the shocking transformation of the tablet right before their very eyes!

Even though they had no idea what the tablet had turned into, they could confirm that it was an absolute treasure!

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the stone tablet’s transformation before him, a look of joy appeared in his eyes. He had finally located the last devil stele! He had finally gathered all six great devil steles!

The Concealed Scripture Devil Stele had indeed hidden itself extremely well. Ordinary treasures would never be able to completely hide their aura. Looking at the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele, it was able to remain hidden under the eyes of so many experts. Moreover, it could transform into another form! Without the other devil steles, it would have been impossible to locate it! Even Sovereigns wouldn’t be able to locate it!

It was no wonder the three Skull Ancestors and Zhao Yuan had failed to find any leads after sending out so many people.

Huang Xiaolong quickly kept the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele into the Complete Heaven Palace in the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“I won’t take this for nothing...” Huang Xiaolong turned around and spoke to the two of them. “Tell me your request. As long as I can give it to you, I will.”

Sui Wenhui and the old man stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

This...

The two of them started to hesitate.

“Alright...” Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a second and continued, “How about this? I still have several spiritual pills and spirit stones here.” He tossed over a spatial ring to each of them.

Even though the two of them wanted to reject Huang Xiaolong’s gift, they became flabbergasted when they realized the contents in the spatial ring. There were mountains of low-grade chaos spirit stones and high-grade grandmist spiritual pills!

They didn’t dare to believe their eyes as they failed to return to reality even after a long time.

Did Huang Xiaolong really intend to give them all the low-grade chaos spirit stones and high-grade grandmist spiritual pills?!

Several million years ago, the Su Family was one of the ten superfamilies in Borderless City. Even at their peak, their treasury didn’t contain as much wealth as they were holding in their hands! In fact, all their wealth combined at their peak wasn’t even one ten thousandths of what they were holding!

“Lord... This... This...” Sui Wenhui stammered as he stared at Huang Xiaolong with a terrified stare. He couldn’t help but panic when he held so many treasures in his hand.

“There is no need to worry...” The little cow piped up all of a sudden, “This brat has a ton of them! He doesn’t even care for them... Since it’s a gift, just keep it.”

Sui Wenhui and the old steward stared at each other in disbelief.

“You should hold on to this command token.” Huang Xiaolong pulled out a token and handed it over to them. “With this, you will be able to enter the headquarters of the Skull Devil Sect. There will be some ancestor-level figure there to guide you with your cultivation.”

Skull Devil Sect!

The two of them trembled like a leaf in the wind.

The Skull Devil Sect was one of the five strongest superpowers in the Devil World. Right now, their reputation was as high as the sun in the midday sky. No native of the Devil World could not have heard of them. Even when the Sui Family was at its peak, it was like a speck of dust when compared to the Skull Devil Sect.

Sui Wenhui accepted the token with trembling hands, and he saw the inscription of a skull on it.

“We thank the Lord!” Sui Wenhui fell to his knees all of a sudden as he kowtowed to Huang Xiaolong. If he could enter the Skull Devil Sect, why would he be afraid of the Cloud Sea City Lord Manor?! He might even be able to restore the past glory of his Sui Family!

In the past, the Sui Family could be considered a local power. As time whittled their strength away, they were down to their last two members.

Steward Peng got to his knees as he expressed his thanks to Huang Xiaolong.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong quickly pardoned them.

As if on cue, the little cow turned to the entrance as a chilly gaze flashed past her eyes. “Seems like there are a lot of people who aren’t afraid of death...”

A ton of experts poured through the gates in an instant. The Young City Lord of the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion rushed into the residence after returning with reinforcements. There were three additional experts following behind him.

When they saw the appearance of the three experts, Sui Wenhui and the old steward revealed a face full of terror.

The three of them were precisely the First, Second, and Third Steward of the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion.

“Lord, you need to be careful... They are the three great stewards of the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion! They are part of the ten strongest experts in our Borderless City. I’ve heard rumors that one of them has already entered the late-Ninth Order Emperor Realm!”

Late-Ninth Order Emperor Realm?

Huang Xiaolong nearly burst out laughing.

As the young city lord stomped towards Huang Xiaolong and the others, he raised his nose to the skies as he sneered, “Uncle Chen, these are the men who killed Uncle Zhang!” He quickly pointed at Huang Xiaolong and the others.

The Cloud Sea City Lord mansion’s experts swept their gaze over Huang Xiaolong and the others as a trace of suspicion formed in their minds. A low growl echoed through the room, “Who are you? How dare you kill someone from my Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion? Aren’t you showing us a little too much disrespect?!”

Huang Xiaolong replied indifferently, “So what? I’ll kill whoever I feel like. Even the Heaven Punishment Archdevil Ancestor is nothing in my eyes, much less your city lord mansion...” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Before I change my mind, all of you better scram. If you leave now, you might make it in time to keep your life!”

Rage bubbled in the hearts of the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion’s experts when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Chen Yizheng, the late-Ninth Order Emperor, released his aura as he snapped, “Fine! I would like to see what happens if I don’t leave!” He sent a palm strike flying towards Huang Xiaolong as soon as he spoke.

“Brat, if you manage to block my attack, I’ll leave!”

It was too bad the words hadn’t fully left his lips when the Flying Devil Python’s tail swept outwards. In the next instant, Chen Yizheng was sent blasting through every structure in sight before he slammed into the city walls of the Borderless City. The impact caused the city to shake.

Everyone from the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion stared at the scene before them in shock. When they saw his corpse, he had already turned into a pile of meat and blood.

Shock and fear flashed through the eyes of Sui Wenhui and the old steward.

Wasn’t Chen Yizheng a late-Ninth Order Emperor?!

Very quickly, the members of the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion snapped back to attention. However, the blood had long since drained from their faces as they stared at Huang Xiaolong and the others in shock.

“Sen... Senior...” The young city lord felt his body going stiff as he quickly apologized to Huang Xiaolong. However, Huang Xiaolong passed down his order before anyone could say anything. “Kill everyone but one.”

He had already given them a chance to leave. It was too bad no one took it.

The faces of everyone from the Cloud Sea City Lord Mansion fell, and before they could protect their young city lord, the Flying Devil Python swept its tail outwards. In the blink of an eye, all but one was left.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the last man as he instructed, “Go back and report to your city lord. If you wish to seek revenge, look for me, Huang Xiaolong, at the Skull Devil Sect.”
