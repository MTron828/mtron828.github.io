Chapter 3199: Investigate Thoroughly!

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong replied with a single word as a weird feeling formed in his heart.

Why would the Sixth Princess of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire invite him over for a discussion?

There was no way it was a small matter if she personally sent someone over to invite him over.

As his figure flickered, he emerged from the Sun Moon Furnace. When he reappeared, he arrived at the entrance of the manor and he saw two silver haired old men sent by Zeng Ying. From the aura the old men gave off, they wasn’t any weaker than You Wuyi of the Nether Spirit Palace.

Caught by surprise, the two of them jumped in fright. One of them quickly cupped his fists in response, “May I ask if you’re the Purple Lightning Young Master we have been tasked to find?”

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

The two of them bowed respectfully when they received his confirmation. “Young Master, we are here on the Sixth Princess’ orders, and we sincerely invite you over to the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire. The princess has something important she wishes to discuss with you.” After they spoke, they handed over a letter.

Breaking the restrictions on the letter, Huang Xiaolong noticed that it was really a letter from the princess herself. It was an invitation to the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, but the reason for the invitation wasn’t stated.

After thinking about it for a second, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Alright, I’ll follow you back to the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire.”

“Many thanks!” Looks of joy could be seen on their faces as they bowed in haste.

“You’re welcome.”

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong and the others cleaned up the manor before leaving the Exiled Dragon City.

The news of his departure reached the ears of many in an instant. Di Xiaolong, the Nether Spirit Palace, and the Lightning Yang Race were notified by their spies almost instantly.

Huang Xiaolong had been in seclusion for so many years, but not a single power removed their spies from around his manor.

As such, the news of his departure quickly swept through the powers.

“Oh? Princess Zeng Ying has something she wishes to discuss with him?” A weird light flashed in Di Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Your Highness, do you think it has something to do with the Dao Emperor World?” Caretaker Pang felt his brain tingling and he quickly spoke up.

“It’s possible. I’ve heard that the Dao Emperor’s Sword has reappeared in the Dao Emperor World. I wonder if it’s true…” He continued with a sneer on his face, “Even if it has, all of them are stupid if they think they can obtain it. My oldest brother has been there for several hundred thousand years, and he has yet to locate the sword!”

The Dao Emperor’s Sword was the treasured weapon of the Dao Emperor himself, and it was a weapon at the creation level! It was said to contain the inheritance of the Dao Emperor, and anyone would be tempted to obtain a treasure at that level!

“That might not be the only reason the Sixth Princess is looking for the Purple Lightning Young Master.” Elder Fang spoke all of a sudden.

As everyone turned to look at him with a stunned expression on their face, Di Xiaolong asked, “Elder Fang, what do you mean by that?”

“I’m not completely sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion in my mind. I have to look into it a little bit more in order to be sure.”

Lights flashed in Di Xiaolong’s eyes as he thought about the implications of Elder Fang’s words.

…

Along the way to the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, the two silver-haired elders gasped in shock as they noticed the speed of the Purple Lightning Peak. “Young Master, is your flying ship a pseudo creation artifact?”

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong smirked. “That’s right.”

In the past, he had to conceal the fact that the Purple Lightning Peak was a pseudo-creation artifact. However, he was no longer afraid of anyone after he reached perfection level in twelve elements.

One of the elders exclaimed, “There are only so many pseudo-creation level flying ships in the Blazing Dragon World! Even the princes of our celestial empire don't have flying ships of this level… Who would have thought that the Purple Lightning Young Master would own one!” A trace of envy could be seen on his face as he sighed in resignation.

It was the dream of many peak-level experts to own a pseudo-creation level flying ship.

After all, it was an extremely valuable treasure one could use to travel and defend themselves.

The other elder was equally as envious of Huang Xiaolong.

A chuckle left his lips. “I only managed to obtain this treasure through sheer luck. I used a lot of effort to refine the flying ship to its current level.”

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong spoke to the two of them about matters regarding the Blazing Dragon World and other worlds.

Huang Xiaolong managed to learn a lot from the two of them, and with the speed of the Purple Lightning Peak, they reached the capital region of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire in several short months.

Even though it wasn’t as crowded as the Blazing Dragon Region, there were tons of flying ships and divine beasts flying through the air. Experts of the ancient races, world masters, and those from various superpowers could be seen everywhere!

The Purple Lightning Peak caused a massive commotion when it appeared.

“Is that a pseudo-creation level flying ship?!”

“Who in the world is that guy?!”

“I have no idea, but the two silver-haired elders seem to be the experts protecting the Sixth Princess!”

“What?! The Silver-Haired Old Men!”

The faces of everyone changed when they heard the reputation of the two old men.

“Legends has it that the two of them are experts who reached perfection level in seven elements!”

“It’s been so long since they last fought… They have to be stronger than that!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly when he heard the praises everyone had for the two elders. “You seem to be very famous here…”

“The Purple Lightning Young Master must be killing! We’re nothing but weaklings compared to you…”

Laughing in response, the Purple Lightning Peak soared through the skies and headed straight for the Extreme Heaven Sacred Land.

“Purple Lightning Young Master?!” Someone in the crowd heard how the two elders addressed Huang Xiaolong and they gasped in shock. “Is he the expert who defeated Di Xiaolong, the Mysterious Pool Black Devil, and the Golden Bamboo Old Ancestor?!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“It’s probably him… It’s no wonder the Silver-Haired Old Men are so respectful!”

Several experts started to discuss among themselves.

Huang Xiaolong’s arrival quickly traveled through the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire. The battle that took place in the Radiance of Spring Chamber of Commerce had spread through the entire Blazing Dragon World, and many experts knew of his name. Even after several hundred thousand years, no one would forget about him!

Experts who reached the grand completion level in ten elements were considered great experts in the Blazing Dragon World, and Huang Xiaolong showed off the power of someone who had comprehended eleven elements to the grand completion level!

As they traveled towards the Extreme Heaven Sacred Land, a group of soldiers stopped them dead in their tracks.

The faces of the two elders changed slightly when they saw their commander, and they whispered softly in Huang Xiaolong’s ears, “It’s the eldest prince’s men! He’s Marshal Xue Jian from our Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire!”

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes slightly.

The Blazing Dragon World was dominated by the three celestial empires, and the marshals of their respective empires were existences who had absolute authority. Even the princes of the celestial empires had to show respect to the marshals.

Xue Jian was coincidentally the strongest marshal in the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, and his strength was something no one could deny.

As he worked for the oldest prince in the celestial empire, he was naturally standing against the Sixth Princess.

Cupping their fists, the two elders greeted the marshal. “Greetings to Marshal Xue Jian! The Purple Lightning Young Master has been invited over by Her Highness! Please do not make things difficult for us!”

As core disciples and the upper echelons of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire were able to enter the Blazing Dragon Sacred Land, the Extreme Heaven Sacred Land was no different.

Any outsider would have to be thoroughly searched before they could enter the sacred land.

A mocking smile formed on Xue Jian’s lips. “I’m doing my job. Even if he’s someone invited by the Sixth Princess, we have to check him thoroughly!” After he spoke, he glared at Huang Xiaolong and snapped, “Is there anyone who will take responsibility if he’s up to no good?”
