Chapter 3654: Greetings, Master!

Those in the hall stared in stunned silence when they saw Wu Xin and Ye Ye approaching Huang Xiaolong.

“Patriarch, looks like the kid is too arrogant! Even the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Races can’t take it anymore! They’re going to get rid of him!” Jian Shengdong laughed.

Jian Weifeng joined him. “Lord Wu Xin and Ye Ye look like they plan to please our old ancestor. They will definitely be ruthless in their actions!”

Tao Han’er yelled anxiously when she saw the two of them approach. “Lord Huang, run away! Don’t worry about me!”

When everyone was ready to watch them beat the sh*t out of Huang Xiaolong, the two of them bowed respectfully. “Subordinate greets Lord Huang!”

Loud blasts rang in the heads of those sitting around.

Subordinates?!

Lord?!!

Even with their status, Wu Xin and Ye Ye were mere subordinates?!

There were countless experts in the inner hall who fell to their buttocks.

Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, and Mei Jie got to their feets.

Jian Weifeng who was ready to watch Huang Xiaolong get beaten up by the two of them felt his body freezing up.

Tao Han’er was equally as shocked.

What in the world was going on?!

How did the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Race turn into his subordinates?!

When everyone was stuck in a state of shock, Yu Xiaohong appeared from the outer hall and bowed towards Huang Xiaolong, “This subordinates greet Lord Huang!”

Another one!

This time, it was the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the three of them and frowned. “Who told you to come?!”

The three of them jumped in fright when they noticed the displeasure in his voice.

“We… We were worried about you!” Wu Xin whispered softly as though he was a kid who had done something wrong.

“So… The three of you thought that you could come over and protect me?” Huang Xiaolong grunted, “Do you think I need you to protect me?!”

The three of them fell to their knees in fright.

“We didn’t think so far! Your Highness, please forgive us!” They knelt quickly.

The old ancestors in the hall gasped in fright at the scene.

The Limitless Master, the King of the Ocean Race, and the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire were acting so subserviently to him!

All of them were supreme experts who controlled a massive power!

The hall fell into silence instantly.

All they could hear were the breaths and heartbeat coming from those around them. Jian Weifeng had it the worst as he felt his legs cramping up.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression softened eventually and he sighed, “Get up.”

The three of them thanked him before getting to their feet.

After they did, they stood behind him quietly.

No one in the inner hall dared to speak a word. No one knew if they were dumbfounded by the scene where the three experts kneeled before Huang Xiaolong.

A soft cough broke the silence in the hall. Gui Chi cupped his fist towards Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, we meet again.” The smile on his face was as bright as the sun. The members in the hall swore that they had never seen such an expression on Gui Chi’s face for as long as they had known him. Even when he met Jian Wushuang, he didn’t smile so brightly.

Those who didn’t know would think that Gui Chi and Huang Xiaolong were close friends.

Meeting again? When Huang Xiaolong chased him away back then, it couldn’t be considered a meeting, right? But whatever the case was, Huang Xiaolong replied casually, “I guess we meet again. You should have left the Zhu Lan Lands after you ran away from my sword qi. You shouldn’t have come to the Jian Family’s ceremony.”

Storms raged in the hearts of those who heard it.

What in the world did he just say?! Lord Gui Chi was chased away by the Blue Dragon Young Master’s sword qi!

Jian Weifeng felt his legs giving way.

As for Jian Xiyuan who was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong earlier, he retreated to a corner of the hall. That was the only way he would feel safer.

The expressions of Jian Wushuang, Elder Baixuan Tian, and Mei Jie changed.

Gui Chi’s strength placed him firmly into the ten strongest individuals of the Unknown Lands! He was close to the 20 billion units mark, but he was chased away by the other party’s sword qi! Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong was comparable to Jian Wushuang?!

Zhu Jian tugged slightly on his father’s sleeves and he muttered, “Father…”

“There’s no need to be afraid. I’m here.” An awkward expression formed on his face after the words left his lips. If the Blue Dragon Young Master could chase Gui Chi away, his strength would seem a little lacking to say the least.

“Nevermind, grandpa’s reputation should be enough…”

When Zhu Chen was brought up, Zhu Jian finally calmed himself down.

Gui Chi grinned, “Lord, you’re right! I shouldn’t have come to the Jian Family. I’ll leave right now!”

The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, he felt that something was wrong.

His figure started to fade when Huang Xiaolong flipped his wrist. Gui Chi was forced back into his original position.

“Lord… What… What is the meaning of this?” Gui Chi’s expression changed.

“Nothing much. Today, no one is allowed to leave without my explicit permission!” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Looks of disgust formed on the faces of those in the hall.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hmph! What arrogance!” Elder Baixuan Tian’s expression sank. “Do you really think that you can keep all of us here?! Do you dare to declare war on the entire Unknown Lands?!”

Even though not ever power in the Unknown Lands had shown up, most would have sent their respective envoys. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Huang Xiaolong’s actions would offend the entire Unknown Lands.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at her from the corner of his eye and spoke casually, “You’ll know if I have the ability to do it soon. So what if I declare war on the Unknown Lands? What do you think you can do to me?”

Inhaling deeply, Jian Wushuang stepped forward and spoke, “I am Jian Wushuang and I hope to exchange pointers with fellow cultivator.”
