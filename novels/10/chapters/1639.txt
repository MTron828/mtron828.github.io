“That Ancestor’s disciple is called Wei Hong.” Asura King Jin Yuan answered.

“Wei Hong.” The cold gleam in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes intensified. “Speak to me in detail, what happened exactly.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yes, Master.” The four bowed slightly in respectful compliance.

Originally, the four of them had assumed Huang Xiaolong’s relationship with that Asura Gate’s disciple Ren Wokuang did not run deep, but now it was apparent that the things weren’t so.

The four took turns reporting the details of the investigation and Ren Wokuang’s current situation to Huang Xiaolong.

In truth, Ren Wokuang and the female disciple Wang Mengqin had met when performing the sect’s task outside and had fallen in love later on. However, around the same time, Wei Hong had taken a fancy to Wang Mengqin and was enamored with her. Out of resentment and jealousy, he had plotted and arranged for an Asura Gate disciple to provoke and deliberately challenge Wokuang to a battle.

Then, during the challenge battle with Ren Wokuang, that male disciple suddenly died. Wei Hong jumped out and accused Ren Wokuang of killing the same sect brethren, and ordered people to imprison Ren Wokuang in the dungeon.

That was the gist of the story.

It was no doubt that the sudden death of that male disciple was Wei Hong’s underhanded credit.

After he finished listening to their reports, Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to calm his anger before speaking, “How long has Ren Wokuang been imprisoned in the Asura Gate headquarters’ dungeon?”

“About fifty to sixty years already.” Tai Yue replied honestly.

The coldness in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes intensified further. In other words, his Master Ren Wokuang had already been imprisoned in the dark dungeon even before he came to Hell!

“How is Wei Hong torture Ren Wokuang?” Huang Xiaolong asked coldly.

“In these fifty to sixty years, Wei Hong ordered those guarding the dungeon to torture Ren Wokuang with various forms of punishment every day. Ren Wokuang’s cultivation was sealed before that. Wei Hong didn’t want Ren Wokuang’s life, but to have him suffer excruciating pain day in day out.” Jin Yuan finished.

The temperature around Huang Xiaolong fell sharply.

Tortured with various punishments every day!

Damn that Wei Hong!

“Ren Wokuang’s Master did not do anything to save him?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Ren Wokuang’s Master is of course aware that his disciple was framed, but Wei Hong’s Master, the Asura Gate headquarters’ Ancestor, Jia Ding, had warned Ren Wokuang’s Master, so Ren Wokuang’s Master did not dare to stand on Ren Wokuang’s side. Furthermore, Ren Wokuang’s Master even went as far as severing his master-disciple relationship with Ren Wokuang and announced to the public that Ren Wokuang is no longer his disciple.” Tai Yue explained.

“What Ren Wokuang’s Master’s name?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice was dangerously low.

“His name is Deng Zhilong, a Grand Elder of the Asura Gate headquarters’ Enforcement Hall.” Tai Yue answered.

“If we make a quick stop at the Asura Gate headquarters when we’re heading to the Holy Mountain, would we still make it in time?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked.

Jin Yuan, Tai Yue, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian were stunned. Huang Xiaolong’s question was truly unexpected for them.

“Master, you want to go rescue Ren Wokuang?” Wan Yutian asked seriously but he went on without waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s reply, “The Asura Gate headquarters is in the same direction as the Holy Mountain. We might be delayed slightly if we want to rescue Ren Wokuang first, but we should still make it in time for the Holy Mountain’s appearance, however, Master need not be troubled by this matter. Tai Yue and I are more than enough to deal with it.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, sounding determined as he said, “No, I want to go over there personally.”

“Master plans to break into the Asura Gate headquarters by force?” Fan Hui went on solemnly, “I shall gather the Netherguards army.”

Although the four of them were peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts, the Asura Gate used to be one of twelve super forces of Asura World in the past, and the Asura Gate headquarters was still a force to be reckoned with. Therefore, some preparations were needed if they were going to confront the Asura Gate headquarters.

“No need, it’s sufficient I bring the one hundred of the puppet Netherguards.” Huang Xiaolong pondered for a moment, then said.

Huang Xiaolong had not planned to use the one hundred high-level Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards so soon, but now that was the fastest solution on hand.

Asura King Jin Yuan and the other three dazed for a moment, then smiled wryly in their hearts as they said a prayer for the Asura Gate.

Hope the Asura Gate knows what’s best for them, otherwise, the Asura Gate would probably...!

Jin Yuan and the others had a certain degree of understanding about those puppet Netherguards. Their old master had spent a lot of effort collecting various precious grandmist spiritual herbs and other materials to forge those one hundred high-level Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards.

It could be said that one hundred puppet Netherguards’ bodies were extremely tenacious. In the entire universe, there were only a handful of things that could injure them.

With a hundred puppet Netherguards, it was no exaggeration to say that they could kill any gods or demons that dared to block their paths!

Even the Ten Great Commanders had to join hands to fend off these one hundred puppet Netherguards.

If Asura Gate’s Wei Hong were to realize that because of Ren Wokuang, one hundred high-level Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards would descend onto the Asura Gate headquarters, bringing the possibility of Asura Gate headquarters’ total annihilation, what would Wei Hong think at that time?

Huang Xiaolong took out Netherworld King’s Jade and channeled the heart of hell’s power into the jade token. Immediately, one after another blurry shadows flew out from the City of Eternity, forming a line right in front of Huang Xiaolong. These were none other than those high-level Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards, not one more or one less, exactly one hundred of them.

After Huang Xiaolong had refined the black light and merged with the heart of hell, he could summon these one hundred puppet Netherguards by infusing the heart of hell’s power into the Netherworld King’s Jade.

When all one hundred puppet Netherguards stood in front of Huang Xiaolong, a light glimmered from the Netherworld King’s Jade, collecting the one hundred puppet Netherguards into the Netherworld King’s Jade’s space.

After that, the five people flew away.

“Master, while you were breaking through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm, the amazing inextinguishable aura that we felt, did the inextinguishable runes cover... thrice?” Recalling the shocking manifestation when Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm broke through, Jin Yuan couldn’t hold back his curiosity.

Demon King Fan Hui, and the other two also fixed their eyes on Huang Xiaolong.

“Three times?” Huang Xiaolong blanked for a second then smiled as he said, “Can be considered so.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s answer, the four sucked in a breath of cold air in amazement.

As expected, three times!

“Then, Master, all three times are also at a hundred percent, right?” Tai Yue couldn’t help asking for more details, feeling a parchness in his throat.

“En, a hundred percent.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in affirmation.

There was nothing to hide about this.

Waves of shock struck Tai Yue, and the others’ heart.

“Three times... is a lot?” Looking at the four people’s shocked expression, Huang Xiaolong asked in return.

Huang Xiaolong’s words completely rendered all four of them speechless.

Three times... is not a lot?

“Master, perhaps you don’t know, but in the whole universe, we have never heard of anyone that has extinguishable runes covering his godhead three times when breaking through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm!” Wan Yutian explained to Huang Xiaolong on behalf of everyone.

It finally dawned on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong asked Jin Yuan, Tai Yue, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian other matters related to Asura Gate.

The four answered everything that they knew.

Two hours later, the five flew out from the forbidden land area. Waiting outside the forbidden land was the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Yihai.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s group come out, Shi Yihai became spirited and hurried towards them, performing a respectful salute.

After finishing his salute, Shi Yihai hesitated as if he had something to say.

“Yihai, what’s the matter?” Demon King Fan Hui noticed there was something wrong with Shi Yihai’s expression, hence he asked.

Shi Yihai respectfully replied, “Master, four Lords, just a while ago, the Massacring Gods Gate led their army to surround my Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe. They are demanding for my Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe to submit to them within three days, or they would slaughter my entire tribe!”
