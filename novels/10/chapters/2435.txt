Chapter 2436: Explain Yourself!

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong locked himself up in cultivation. He waited patiently for the arrival of the various experts.

During the time he spent in the Purple Clouds Sea, Huang Xiaolong didn’t neglect his cultivation.

With his cultivation speed, he should be able to enter the peak of the mid-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm in a year.

Right now, his three saint godheads were constantly evolving as the Holy Mandate Imprint sucked in the source energy of the Holy World at a terrifying speed. Of course, everything played a part in his rapid increase in strength.

As he sat in the middle of the courtyard, the Holy Mandate Imprint on his forehead flashed continuously. The source energy of the Holy World poured into him like a never-ending flood, and holy light surrounded his body.

Several days later...

Chen Zhi, and an enforcer of the Holy Heavens in charge of the branch he was in, entered the courtyard. They reported to Huang Xiaolong that the Beast Tamer Holy Emperor, the leader of the Black Inferno Race, the Scarlet Flame Holy Emperor, and the Blue Whale Race Patriarch were at the door.

“Your Highness, what should we do now?” Grand Elder Lu Ruian asked cautiously.

“Let them in. Bring them to the outer hall and inform them that I’ll be there soon.”

After bowing in acknowledgment, Lu Ruian left the courtyard.

Huang Xiaolong stretched his stiff muscles, and he turned towards the outer hall. It seemed as though it was time for him to flex his muscles.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong turned and spoke to the seven True Saints behind him.

As he led the seven True Saints behind him, they made their way towards the outer hall. When they finally arrived, the outer hall was filled with a ton of people.

It seemed as though the various leaders had brought a considerable number of subordinates with them....

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across everyone present, and he saw that nearly all the powers he had offended were there. The Ancient Emperor Holy Gate, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, the Black Inferno Race, the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, and the Blue Whale Race were waiting for his appearance.

The only part that surprised Huang Xiaolong was the presence of the members of the Devil Palace.

Xie Bufan and Dou Rui sat along with the members of the righteous factions as they waited for Huang Xiaolong to appear.

As he entered the hall, everyone stared at him in unison. No one in the hall was a weakling, and the leaders of their respective factions were all terrifyingly strong True Saint Realm experts. Moreover, Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm experts like Shen Jiewen and Duan Xuan were also present. If all of them were to release their aura without holding anything back, even ordinary First or Second Tribulation half-True Saints would faint in fright.

However, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary half-True Saint. The expression on his face didn’t change as he strode into the main seat in the hall.

Chen Zhi and the others followed behind him.

As soon as he took his seat, Shen Jiewen, the Beast Tamer Holy Emperor snorted, “Huang Xiaolong, did you kill my disciple? Don’t even think of lying. I did my investigation and Yu Fujiang died at the hands of Thirteen.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the anxious expression on Shen Jiewen’s face, and he replied expressionlessly, “I wasn’t going to push the blame away from me. That’s right. I was the one who killed Yu Fujiang.”

A cold light flashed in Shen Jiewen’s eyes the moment Huang Xiaolong admitted to killing his disciple. “My Beast Tamer Holy Gate didn’t offend the Holy Heavens. Why did you kill my disciple?”

“He conspired against me to obtain my Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast. Too bad he was a weakling, and I managed to kill him in retaliation.”

Rage boiled in Shen Jiewen’s heart, and he snapped, “B*llshit! You obviously moved against him because you were blinded by greed! You killed him to steal his treasures!” He didn’t allow Huang Xiaolong to defend himself, and he continued, “You killed my disciple and stole the treasures of my Beast Tamer Holy Gate. How do you plan to settle this? Do you really think that you can kill the Holy Princes of other factions as long as you have the protection of the four Primal Ancestors?”

“Also, you made Yu Ming betray my Holy Gate! Without a proper explanation, I won’t allow this matter to pass!” Shen Jiewen pointed at Yu Ming, and his expression fell even further.

The leader of the Black Inferno Race, Zhan Zhiyuan, interrupted Shen Jiewen’s rage, “Huang Xiaolong, you killed my son, Zhan Bo! What’s your explanation this time? As for the two traitors of our race, you better hand them over!” He pointed at Sun Xiang and Li Huajun behind Huang Xiaolong and hollered.

“Where’s Elder Song Cheng? You owe us an explanation for that matter too!”

The various leaders pointed at Huang Xiaolong and started demanding explanations for killing the members of their factions in succession. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

As they continued to list out Huang Xiaolong’s ‘sins,’ it seemed as though they would pounce at him at any moment.

The members of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate and the Devil Palace merely sat in the hall as they watched the amazing show playing out before them.

Huang Xiaolong seemed to be completely unaffected by their abuse as he ordered for someone to bring him a cup of spirit tea. When they were finally done, he opened his mouth and replied to them all at once. “It’s true that I killed them. Are you guys thinking of asking me to kill myself in apology?”

Everyone stared at him and fell silent in an instant.

It was true that Huang Xiaolong had killed their disciples. However, even if he stood still to allow them to kill him in revenge, no one had the guts to do it. Even Shen Jiewen didn’t dare to move against him. The instant anyone tried anything funny, they would have to be prepared for the four Primal Ancestors’ crazed retaliation.

Even monstrous presences like the Beast Tamer Holy Gate wouldn’t be able to take on the rage of the four Primal Ancestors. No, even if the Holy Lands Alliance were to step in, the entire alliance was bound to be crushed.

Shen Jiewen finally broke the silence, “For the sake of the Primal Ancestors, I’ll forgive you if you hand the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura over.”

A look of generosity appeared on Shen Jiewen’s face.

“Also, you have to hand the traitor over to us!”

Huang Xiaolong lost it when he heard the conditions Shen Jiewen proposed due to his respect for the four Primal Ancestors.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and looked at Shen Jiewen with a mocking gaze. “Shen Jiewen, do you really think that your disciple is as valuable as the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura?”

Sweeping his gaze across everyone present, he continued, “Is everyone here to ask me to hand over the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura as compensation? There’s only one strand of it. How are you going to split it up?”

Shen Jiewen sneered, “That’s not a problem for you to worry about.”

The smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face disappeared as he stared at Shen Jiewen. “Let me make myself clear. I won’t be handing over the grandmist holy spiritual aura, and neither will I hand over Chen Zhi and the rest.”

Shen Jiewen exploded in rage the moment he heard what he said. “Huang Xiaolong, you killed my personal disciple! Do you think that my Beast Tamer Holy Gate is there for decoration? What do you take the Holy Lands Alliance as?! Do you really think that no one dares to make a move on you?”

Huang Xiaolong ignored whatever he said and addressed everyone present, “Since everyone wants the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura, I’ll challenge anyone under the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm on the arena in the Mirage Pavilion. You can choose to send anyone with the appropriate cultivation level to challenge me, and if you manage to kill or defeat me, I’ll give it to you!”
