After Gudu Yue finished, the malevolent air from Song Rui’s body intensified. “This punk has these many grade seven spirit stones to buy top-grade chaos sea spirit stone, Giant Shark’s blood essence, and sword wings only because he must have collected the grade seven spirit stones from our Blood Wolf Gang’s destroyed flying ships!”

“Hateful! My hard work of collecting grade seven spirit stones for the last couple of thousand years, along with those divine armors, and divine artifacts are actually benefiting him!”

The more Song Rui talked about it, the more agitated he became. His face warped with hatred and fury, and his eyes glowed with a hint of scarlet.

Gudu Yue appeased him, “At that time, I was wondering why that kid has so many grade seven spirit stones to buy such large quantities of top-grade chaos refining materials. Now I know that he actually robbed them from the Blood Wolf Gang’s wealth!” He harrumphed coldly and went on, “But, don’t you worry. I have already found out that the kid did not leave the Martial Dragon City. Three months ago, he bought a luxurious residence in the city!”

Song Rui couldn’t understand Huang Xiaolong’s action. “Is he planning to stay long term in Martial Dragon City?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Not likely.” Gudu Yue spoke in a solemn voice, “According to the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall Supervisor Chen Yuan, that kid is looking to buy space velocity stones. That kid also went to the Flying Paradise Commerce looking for the same thing. He remained in the city most likely to buy the space velocity stones at the upcoming auction!”

Song Rui’s brows furrowed as he doubted, “He’s also interested in those space velocity stones?”

Gudu Yue nonchalantly waved his hand and reassured Song Rui, “It depends on whether he has enough money even if he wants to buy the space velocity stones. There are numerous families preparing to bid for the space velocity stones. But, you don’t need to worry, I promised that you will get the space velocity stones, that means I will surely get it for you!"

Song Rui laughed. "In that case, I’ll thank Brother Gudu in advance."

Gudu Yue laughed. "There is an equivalent price for me to bid this batch of space velocity for you, I want an additional ten percent increase from your Blood Wolf Gang’s harvest!"

Additional ten percent!

Song Rui hesitated, then agreed solemnly, "Fine!"

Gudu Yue smiled brightly, then raised his wine cup for a toast. Two cups clinked in midair. Gudu Yue also promised Song Rui that he would deal with Huang Xiaolong once he left the High Martial World after the auction.

"Still, that elephant by that kid’s side is probably a Sixth Order God King Realm master." Song Rui cautioned Gudu Yue.

Gudu Yue’s tone was boastful as he said, "Merely a Sixth Order God King Realm. When the time comes, I will ask two of my Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders to do it. Don’t tell me that’s not enough to deal with a Sixth Order God King Realm?"

“If Brother Song is still worried, I would ask four Grand Elders to act together!”

Song Rui laughed when he heard that. "With Gudu Clan’s four Grand Elders together, that punk’s dead for sure!"

The Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders were all Seventh Order God King Realm masters. In Song Rui’s opinion, four Seventh Order God King Realm masters were sufficient to handle Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun.

Meanwhile,Huang Xiaolong’s group randomly entered a restaurant after they were done strolling around the city. They ordered a table full of dishes and wine to fill their bellies. When dusk fell, the group made their way back to the residence.

Back at the residence, Huang Xiaolong summoned his three avatars and entered cultivation.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was refining a mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit.

Inside the Sea God Tower, there were over twenty God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits. Eight First Order God King Realm, six Second Order God King Realm, four Third Order God King Realm, and three Fourth Order God King Realm’s Sea Gods’ spirits! There were also two Fifth Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits!

Huang Xiaolong had planned to refine the First Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits in the beginning, then gradually refine stronger Sea Gods’ spirits in the order of Second Order, Third Order, Fourth Order, and lastly, Fifth Order God King Realm!

As Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars cultivated according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, vigorous energy instantly rushed out from the mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit inside the Sea God Tower.

Huang Xiaolong’s body trembled slightly as this vigorous energy flowed continuously into his body as well as his three avatars’ bodies.

The energy quality of a mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit was many times stronger than the six Ancestor God Realm Sea Gods’ spirits that he had refined earlier.

As Xiang Xun suppressed the godforce of the mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit, the spirit’s energy was continuously refined and absorbed by Huang Xiaolong.

...

The days passed and Huang Xiaolong’s strength improved day by day.

Soon, two months passed by...

There was a month left until the Martial Dragon City’s big auction. On this day, Huang Xiaolong stopped cultivating. Whether he could repair the Giant Shark Flying Ship or not depended on whether he could get his hands on the space velocity stones. Furthermore, the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s speed was going to determine his speed to reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, and buy a God King Realm’s Buddha Pellet for Li Lu. Hence, he needed to get his hands on sufficient spirit stones.

Although the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure, Sand Waves Sect’s treasures, and the sea tribe’s twelve families’ treasuries had a lot of grade seven spirit stones, Huang Xiaolong had decided to condense spirit stones during the day and cultivate at night as a precaution.

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he could condense about a hundred thousand high grade seven spirit stones per hour. This gave him a million pieces of high grade seven spirit stones per day with ten hours of condensation.

A month’s worth of accumulation was a shocking amount.

Even though it slowed Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation progress as his day time was allocated for condensing spirit stones, he still successfully broke through to the peak early-Third Order Ancestor God Realm a day before the auction. He was much closer to breaking through to the late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm.

The night before the auction, Huang Xiaolong did not cultivate as usual, but sat in the yard, munching on various kinds of chaos spiritual fruits and drinking elixirs with the little cow, Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others, chatting about the Divine World, Hell, and even some strange stories from the lower realm.

The little cow as Senior Xiaoniu had the most experience and knowledge, therefore, she naturally had the most to say, and her spit flying everywhere.

Unknowingly, the night retreated and the day of the auction arrived.

Huang Xiaolong meditated for a moment and stood up slowly as he looked at the rising sun.

“Come on, let’s depart!”

He leaped onto the little cow’s back and stepped out from the residence with everyone else. The group headed to the location of the auction.

The big auction was jointly held by the Finest Grade House, Myriad Flames Commerce Hall, Flying Paradise Commerce, and the other top trading houses in the center area of the Martial Dragon City. In truth, it was not far away from the residence Huang Xiaolong had bought.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the auction location. At the entrance, Huang Xiaolong ran into the Finest Grade House’s Supervisor Duan Zhen. Duan Zhen’s face lit up when he saw Huang Xiaolong, and he greeted Huang Xiaolong, “I see Brother has not left the High Martial World, haha, looks like Brother is going to show some power in the auction later.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “Supervisor Duan Zhen is joking, there are numerous Patriarchs and experts present today, my turn is still far away.”

Right at this time, a voice sounded, “At least you know your own weight!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned at the sudden disturbance. He looked towards the source of the voice, so did Xiang Xun, and the others. The voice’s owner was the Gudu Clan’s Gudu Yue. However, there was no Longwu Ling Er or Gudu Man. Instead, standing beside Gudu Yue was the Blood Wolf Gang’s Head, Song Rui.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed as he saw Song Rui.

Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the rest were also locked onto Song Rui.

Song Rui’s attention was fixed on Huang Xiaolong, as he ignored Xiang Xun and the void devil beast Xu Baisheng. He sneered coldly, “Punk, you didn’t expect this right? We meet again!”
