Chapter 3433: General Slain

Several dozen days passed.

A month ago, an order came from the True Dragon Celestial Empire to force the experts of the Immortal World into submission.

Now, there was only a single day left before the deadline.

General Chen of the army listened to the reports of his subordinates.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“General Chen, eighty percent of the powers in the Saint World chose to submit! Ninety percent of the experts in the Golden Immortal Realm and above pledged allegiance to us, but there are a little more out there!” One of the officers under General Chen reported.

“Oh? Who are those who haven’t submitted?”

“In the Dongsheng God Continent, there’s Sun Wukong, Ying Gou, and the Holy Phoenix!” He added several other names…

Next, he reported the experts from other continents.

“General Chen, what do you think we should do to them?”

A frosty light flashed in General Chen’s eyes, and he sneered, “After today, we’ll do what we said. Kill their entire race and exterminate their faction. For people like Mu Shuihan, kill everyone in his faction, down to the last dog!”

“Start from the Dongsheng God Continent. In fact, start with the Shushan Immortal Gate. Next, you can go to the Fruits and Flower Mountain before killing your way to the other continents.” General Chen snorted, “We’ll kill to our heart’s content! The Pangu World will tremble in fear when they hear our name! No one will ever dare to go against us ever again!”

“Yes, General!”

“However, I’ve heard that Sun Wukong of the Fruits and Flower Mountain is a troublesome existence. When the Jade Emperor sent out various warriors to take him down, they returned defeated!”

“The Pangu World is full of garbage! We’re from the True Dragon Celestial Empire, and they cannot be compared to us! The Jade Emperor is like a fart compared to His Highness back in the True Dragon Palace!”

The deadline finally passed…

As the first rays of dawn illuminated the land, the True Dragon Army charged out from the Heavenly Court. They advanced towards the Dongsheng God Continent, and a terrifying aura surrounded the Immortal World.

“Father, it’s good that we chose to submit!” Song Qianqian chuckled happily when she saw the army heading towards the Shushan Immortal Gate.

Song Zhipeng revealed a haughty expression. “I’ve heard that the Shushan Immortal Gate is the first on their list! They plan on killing everybody there!”

“Anyone related to Mu Shuihan will face a miserable end!”

Song Qianqian jumped in joy. “Are you for real?”

Song Zhipeng nodded slowly. “Yes. I heard it from an expert of the True Dragon Celestial Empire.” His lips arched upwards, and he snickered, “It’s too bad that little b*stard Huang isn’t here. I wonder how he will feel when he learns that the Shushan Immortal Gate is exterminated!”

“Father, do you think that little b*stard is as strong as His Highness from the True Dragon Celestial Empire?” Song Qianqian asked.

This time, a prince from the empire came. According to the news they heard, he could kill Dao Ancestors like they were weaklings. His strength struck fear in the hearts of those from the Immortal World.

“That little b*stard doesn’t even come close!” Song Zhipeng shook his head. “You might not know this, but His Highness killed Dao Ancestor Jin Peng with a single move! We were there when it happened, and it was terrifying!”

“Dao Ancestor Jin Peng?!”

He was an existence comparable to Sun Wukong, and his name resounded far and wide in the past.

He had countless disciples, and even the Jade Emperor had to be respectful before him. He was killed by the True Dragon Prince with a single move!

When the True Dragon Army was swarming towards the Shushan Immortal Gate, Huang Xiaolong and the others were waiting in the skies.

They planned to head towards the Heavenly Court after making a statement.

It didn’t take long before they saw the giant army charging towards them.

“General, that’s Mu Shuihan of the Shushan Immortal Gate!” one of the experts who submitted to the True Dragon Celestial Empire pointed out.

“Oh, that’s Sun Wukong!”

“Corpse King Ying Gou!”

“Holy Phoenix!”

He pointed at everyone around Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh?” The general who was leading the army was stunned to discover so many of his targets.

“Who’s that guy?” He pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

“He’s the one who suppressed Rulai under the Five Finger Mountain!” the expert of the Immortal World explained.

Rulai was one of the six sages, but he was defeated by that man.

However, the members of the True Dragon Celestial Empire didn’t recognize him.

Huang Xiaolong muttered when he noticed the general. “Are you here to exterminate the Shushan Immortal Gate?”

A snort left the general’s lips. “The universe might be large, but no one dares to defy an order from our True Dragon Celestial Empire! No matter who it is, we’ll exterminate their faction!”

“The Shushan Immortal Gate will not be an exception!”

“Of course, you’ll die too!”

“However…”

Before the general could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong pointed at him casually. He was sent crashing through his army, and a giant gap formed in their massive army.

The general cried in pain before exploding into a million pieces.

Song Zhipeng and the others who wanted to gloat in the Shushan Immortal Gate’s misfortune stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Ever since they invaded the Heavenly Court, that was the first time anyone dared to kill someone from the True Dragon Army.
