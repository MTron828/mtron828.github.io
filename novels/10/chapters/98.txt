Chapter 99: This Freak of a Man!

The next day’s weather was bright and sunny.

Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou left Tianxuan Mansion and headed in the direction of the Cosmic Star Academy.

In the past four years, Fei Hou had worked hard practicing the ‘Liquid Thunder Arts’ that Huang Xiaolong taught him and not too long ago, it finally paid off when he stepped into the Xiantian realm.

Xiantian realm!

In the entire the Luo Tong Kingdom, the number of Xiantian experts probably could be counted on one hand.

Needless to say, this had something to do with Fei Hou swallowing the Fire Dragon Pearls that Huang Xiaolong gave him throughout these past four years, helping Fei Hou to temper and strengthen his physique as well as enhancing the quality of his battle qi. Thus, in comparison, Fei Hou was much stronger than the average same level Xiantian experts.

By the time Fei Hou and Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Academy’s Holy Hall, there were already many people crowding the area.

Huang Xiaolong’s arrival turned him into one of the centers of attention.

These past few years, although Huang Xiaolong practically never attended any of the classes and rarely appeared in the Academy, thereby keeping a low-profile, he still couldn’t escape being a popular topic of discussion in the Academy.

Also, ever since he was promoted to the Second Year, he held the winner title for the Second Year Class Six for four consecutive years by using only one move to defeat his opponent in every match.

Quite a huge commotion swept through the crowd when they spotted Huang Xiaolong. Some die-hard fangirls shrieked excitedly, unable to control their emotions.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re so handsome!”

“Huang Xiaolong, I love you!”

Huang Xiaolong was known for his talent and strength, but his looks weren’t bad either, so it wasn’t strange that many female students considered him as their knight in shining armor. In fact, this was not limited to the boundaries of the Academy– Huang Xiaolong’s fame had reached the daughters of nobles in the Royal City and other counties too, as well as the commoners.

Hearing the high-pitched shrieks of confessions Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly in his heart while he walked towards the Second Years’ seating area.

Lu Kai had arrived earlier could not resist teasing,“Xiaolong, now your influence in the Academy has surpassed even Principal Sun Zhang!”

Although Lu Kai lost to Huang Xiaolong every time he challenged him, it helped build their sense of camaraderie and they had become good friends.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed, “Don’t laugh at me, I think your influence is even bigger than mine!”

Lu Kai being the Luo Tong Kingdom’s Prince and the successor to the throne meant that his influence truly was not weak. After all, he was an actual Prince in many young girls’ hearts.

Hearing this, Lu Kai smiled and said, “Are you aiming for the Second Year’s champion? I heard that Chen Caixiu has broken through to the Ninth Order– she is not an easy opponent!

Chen Caixiu was the Second Year champion for two consecutive years back to back.

“Ninth Order already?” Although a little surprised, Huang Xiaolong was not perturbed by the news.

Noticing Huang Xiaolong’s calm expression, Lu Kai continued to add, “I advise you not to provoke that chick; her moves have always been ruthless, especially towards men. I’m not sure how, but I heard how several foolish guys provoked her and in the end, their lower parts were nearly crippled!” When Lu Kai said this, his legs involuntarily tightened in the middle.

Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, “Don’t worry.”

A short while later, Sun Zhang and Xiong Chu arrived at the Holy Hall, said some encouraging words, and proceeded to announce the starting of the competition.

Like every year, the competition was divided into three large areas.

Every class had a student nominated by the class teacher and those who disagreed could issue a challenge on the stage.

In the Second Year Class Six, Huang Xiaolong was the strongest and this was something recognized by the whole class, while the second was Lu Kai instead of Ye Yong. In the past four years, Lu Kai also trained hard and his strength has surpassed the original number one, Ye Yong.

Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai stood on the stage.

“I don’t believe that this time I still can’t take one move from you!” Lu Kai looked at Huang Xiaolong and said.

Ever since the two of them were promoted into the Second Year, he was defeated with just one move every year.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, keeping silent.

At this time, a dazzling light shrouded Lu Kai’s body and his Sky Peng martial spirit was called out. Strong, violent battle qi towered to the sky as Lu Kai instantly soul transformed, not wasting a second; a layer of feather-like armor covered Lu Kai and four powerful wings could be seen emerging from his back, spreading out, causing the surrounding air flow to become turbulent.

“Colossal Decimation Fist!”

The moment after Lu Kai soul transformed, he already moved and appeared inches away from Huang Xiaolong with his fist punched out, whistling across the air. The huge fist print swooped down on Huang Xiaolong, drowning the stage area in an eerie silence of decimation.

This Colossal Decimation Fist was a battle skill Lu Kai had spent these past few years practicing, and he had finally succeeded two months ago. Although he knew that even with the Colossal Decimation Fist he would not be able to defeat Xiaolong, Lu Kai believed he could block one attack of Huang Xiaolong’s.

Watching an enormous fist print blanketing him, Xiaolong remained standing on the same spot looking like he had no intention to dodge. Instead, he attacked. His fist struck out, meeting Lu Kai’s head on.

The two fists collided, and a thunderous ‘boom’ resounded.

The Colossal Decimation Fist shattered in the blink of an eye, and Lu Kai was seen wobbling back, falling out of the stage before steadying himself.

When Lu Kai steadied himself, he was dazed for a moment, and then he shook his head and smiled wryly as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “It seems I would need a miracle to win against you in my lifetime!”

He still remembered the first time the two of them fought in the First Year competition. At that time, Huang Xiaolong needed to exert his full effort to defeat him, but when they advanced to the Second Year Class, he lost to Huang Xiaolong in just one move. Now, he barely had the courage to challenge Huang Xiaolong anymore.

After Lu Kai was defeated, no one from the same class dared to challenge Huang Xiaolong. Thus, without any suspense, Xiaolong was the Second Year Class Six winner once again.

Next was the year competition.

The Second Year had a total of six classes– to determine the final winner, there were three stages of competition.

Among the six students, three came from the following classes − Class One, Five and Six and they were chosen to draw sticks. However, when everyone saw Huang Xiaolong draw the number one stick, a soft commotion rippled through the crowd.

Number one!

It was actually the number one stick!

Looking at the number stated on the stick, Huang Xiaolong could not resist shaking his head with a wry smile.

Number one stick represented Chen Caixiu, the same person Lu Kai had mentioned earlier. The woman that was merciless towards men.

Gazes followed Huang Xiaolong and Chen Caixiu as the both of them went up to the stage.

Chen Caixiu wore a soft lavender dress, pretty yet she had the bearings of a noble. Not only was Chen Caixiu recognized as the Second Year’s number one person, like Li Lu, she was one of the three famous beauties of the Cosmic Star Academy. But one should be warned, she was a rose full of deadly thorns; her decisiveness was just as well-known as her beauty.

“Huang Xiaolong, for Li Lu’s sake, I will be gentler later.” Chen Caixiu’s eyes scrutinized Huang Xiaolong from top to bottom and said.

Gentler?

A woman saying such words to a man would definitely cause a misunderstanding. Subsequently, weird looks were directed towards the stage with the two of them from the crowd.

Huang Xiaolong cast a glance at Li Lu; he knew Li Lu and Chen Caixiu were good friends. When Li Lu noticed Huang Xiaolong’s sight on her, she grinned playfully at Huang Xiaolong, revealing two cute dimples.

Huang Xiaolong relaxed his shoulders and returned his attention on Chen Caixiu, saying “If you want it this way, then start!” Battle qi rushed out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and the strong momentum vibrated in the air.

“Peak late-Eighth Order!”

All around, shock eyes fixed their stares at Huang Xiaolong.

After experiencing a moment of blankness due to shock from Huang Xiaolong’s revelation, Lu Kai smiled wryly inside – at the moment, he was only at peak late-Seventh Order whereas Huang Xiaolong had reached the peak of late-Eighth Order! At this moment, he truly understood the gap between them.

Chen Caixiu was also staring at Huang Xiaolong with a surprised expression – peak late-Eighth Order! Huang Xiaolong will be fifteen after the coming New Year, right....?

A fifteen-year-old peak late-Eighth Order?!

Although she herself was an early Ninth Order, she was already twenty!

According to Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, what level would he reach by the time he’s twenty years old? Peak late-Tenth Order? It was truly possible!

“This freak of a man!” Chen Caixiu could not help muttering to herself.
