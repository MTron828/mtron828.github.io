Chapter 3725: Black Nether King’s Talent!

A mocking smile appeared on the White Feather King’s face when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you’re comparable to Lord Black Nether? What a joke! Lord Black Nether is the first sentient spirit born during the start of time! Even Old Man Fortune was born later than Lord Black Nether!”

“Lord Black Nether has thirteen supreme bloodlines, and every one of them is unparalleled in the Thirteen Universes!”

“The first and only person who will enter the Universe God Realm is Lord Black Nether!”

“How dare you sprout nonsense and challenge Lord Black Nether?!”

The White Feather King continued, “Take a piss and look at your own reflection. Do you really think that you have fourteen supreme bloodlines or something?”

Huang Xiaolong felt his heart palpitating when he heard what the White Feather King said. If that was true, the Black Nether King’s bloodline was definitely unparalleled.

Huang Xiaolong had never heard of anyone who could possess thirteen supreme bloodlines before!

Not even the Ferocious Devil and the others knew about that!

The White Deer’s eyes turned wide, and it was evident that it was the first time it was hearing anything of the like. There wasn’t a need to mention Yang Dingsheng. He felt the world spinning around him.

“Even if he has thirteen supreme bloodlines, it doesn’t mean a thing. He might have thirteen bloodlines, but that doesn’t mean he’s the most talented person in the Thirteen Universes.” Huang Xiaolong quickly regained his calm.

Laughter boomed through the air when the White Feather King heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Hahaha! Do you really think that you’re more talented than Lord Black Nether?!”

“How long has he been cultivating for? Since the start of time, your Black Nether King has been striving to break through. However, I haven’t even lived past the one hundred million years mark.”

“What?!” The White Feather King, White Deer, and Yang Dingsheng yelled in fright.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Not even a hundred million years?!” The White Feather King couldn’t believe his ears.

“That’s right.”

In fact, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even cultivated for more than twenty million years!

From the time he spent in the mortal world up to his current realm, Huang Xiaolong spent slightly more than ten million years!

“That’s not possible!” The White Feather King sneered. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that we’ll believe your lies? It’s not possible for someone to reach your level in less than a hundred million years!”

“Hand over the Universe Source Stone to us! In the future, Lord Black Nether will allow you to become the fourteenth king of our Universe First Race!” The White Feather King sneered.

Before anyone could react, a branch of the Star Dragon Divine Tree sent him flying.

There was nowhere for him to run as the branches covered countless miles above him. After flying for countless miles, a light surrounded his body as he disappeared into thin air.

“Huang Xiaolong, in the future, Lord Black Nether will personally appear to take care of you! You’re dead!” The White Feather King’s voice descended from the void.

“I’ll be waiting,” Huang Xiaolong replied impassively.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother chasing the man. After all, he wouldn’t be able to suppress the White Feather King anyway.

Like the Golden Cymbals King and Heaven Devouring King, the Star Dragon Divine Tree couldn’t stop them when they escaped.

The White Deer looked at Huang Xiaolong and sighed, “Who would have thought that the Black Nether King would possess thirteen supreme bloodlines?! He should be the first existence who would ever break into the Universe God Realm!”

When that happened, no one would be able to avoid destruction.

The White Deer’s fate would be the same.

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Relax. Since they don’t have the Universe Source Stone, I’ll be able to break through before the Black Nether King.”

The White Deer shook its head silently when it looked at Huang Xiaolong. It was evident that it didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would break through before the Black Nether King.

“It’s not as easy as you think.” The White Deer sighed. “The Black Nether King has unparalleled talent and unlimited support from the Universe First Race. Even so, he failed to break through last time.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the White Deer any longer. After all, he wasn’t planning to explain himself.

“Brother Yang, let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yang Dingsheng who had been stuck in a daze since the White Feather King left.

Snapping back to reality, he stuttered, “Senior… Senior Huang, I…”

“Nonsense, there’s no need to address me as your senior.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Our relationship will remain the same until the end of time!”

Yang Dingsheng’s expression changed slightly, but he eventually nodded his head.

Finally, the two of them charged towards the entrance with the White Deer following closely behind. Yang Dingsheng was initially wary of Huang Xiaolong, but as the days passed, he started to open up. Like before, laughter filled the air.

“Brother Huang, I never would have thought that the White Feather King would be no match for you!” Yang Dingsheng exclaimed.

Huang Xiaolong laughed in response, “I only managed to get lucky by bringing more universe treasures with me…”

“Even if you didn't, the White Feather King wouldn’t be a match for you…” The White Deer sneered at the side.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, but he didn’t dismiss the fact.

“However, the distance between the Black Nether King and yourself is still infinitely large. In fact, Old Man Fortune might even be stronger than you,” The White Deer explained.

“Oh? Is Old Man Fortune really so strong?”

“Yeah. He’s extremely strong. The Black Nether King might be strong, but he’s still wary of Old Man Fortune. Old Man Fortune is the only reason the Universe First Race didn’t dare to touch the Fortune Space when they destroyed the universes the first time!”

Yang Dingsheng explained further, “The Fortune Space is the place created by Old Man Fortune. The oldest races in the Thirteen Universes reside there.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Now that you say that, I’m really looking forward to meeting Old Man Fortune.”

Yang Dingsheng gasped.

The White Deer laughed. “You better get rid of that stupid idea…”

Huang Xiaolong snorted and ignored them both.

Right as they were about to leave the White Deer Cave for the Yang Lightning Race, a shocking power emerged from the depths of the White Deer Cave.

“This?!” Yang Dingsheng yelled.

The three of them noticed that a ton of experts were rushing towards the source of the fluctuations.

“Did the fourteenth universe treasure appear?” Yang Dingsheng asked.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the White Deer for an answer. After all, the White Deer was the owner of the space.

“I have no idea…”
