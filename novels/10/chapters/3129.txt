Chapter 3130: All Your Slaves Need To Die

“The Ancient Era City is even more prosperous than the Red Rock City!” Lei Yu looked at the bustling street and exclaimed.

Even in the Origin Holy World, there wouldn’t be many cities more happening than the Ancient Era City.

In the past, Lei Yu entered the Origin Holy World to establish his Lei Yu Creed. However, this was the first time he entered the Origin Lands to visit the Ancient Era City.

The Myriad Formation Devil muttered, “With the Mystical Pavilion setting up a branch in the Ancient Era City, many chambers of commerce followed suit. It’s no wonder the city is bustling with so many activities.”

As Huang Xiaolong and the others strolled through the streets, they were stopped by a group of people.

They were from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, and there were nearly a hundred of them!

The person in the lead was a young man, and the eminent elder who was sent flying by Lei Yu previously reported to him respectfully, “Young Master, that’s them!” He pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

“You have to be careful of his mount!” A look of fear flashed through his eyes when he looked at Lei Yu.

The young man had red eyes, and he was the young patriarch of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, Man Long.

Man Long glared at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “How dare you lowly human harm an Eminent Elder of my Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race?”

As the Origin Lands was populated by the Origin Races, they outnumbered the humans by a huge amount! Moreover, the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race was one of the strongest races and they looked down on the humans. With a human injuring their eminent Elder, anger filled their hearts.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across those present and a trace of amusement formed in his heart. “What do you want?”

A sinister smile formed on Man Long’s face. “What do I want? I wish to kill your mount, and you shall kneel before me to like my toes a hundred times. Apologize and hand over your spot in the second-class cabin. When that’s done, I’ll let you off.”

“What if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“If you refuse, you and all your slaves will die along with your mount. You’ll die a horrible death!” Man Long sneered. “When you die, you will regret ever crossing me, Man Long!”

Huang Xiaolong was unable to control his laughter any longer, and neither could the rest.

The nine beast kings glared at Man Long and the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race with a cold gaze.

“I was planning to ignore the fact that you tried to force me to hand over my cabin.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “Too bad you don’t know when to quit.” A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “You’re tired of living!”

The experts from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race were stunned for a second, but Man Long burst into laughter all of a sudden. “Are you crazy? Hahaha! Do you really wish to harp on the matter that happened in the Red Rock City?”

“Young Master, there’s no need to waste your breath with them. Just exterminate them once and for all.” An Eminent Elder of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race approached Man Long and sighed.

The eminent elder was the strongest expert they brought with them, and he was at the peak of the late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. He reached the minor completion stage in the power of absolute blaze and he was extremely confident in his abilities.

Nodding, Man Long growled, “Attack!”

“There’s no need. I shall take care of all of them myself!” The eminent elder sneered. After he spoke, his figure flashed and he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong and the others. As his fist shook, thirteen phantom punches appeared in the air and the experts standing around hastily retreated in case they got caught up in the crossfire.

The thirteen fists were formed from the eminent elder’s understanding of the power of absolute blaze, and the fire reached a terrifying degree. The fists might look small, but they were more than capable of punching a hole through a cosmos artifact!

Before Lei Yu could make his move, the Black Shadow Devil pointed at the eminent elder.

The thirteen fists started to compress, and they flew back at the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race.

Miserable cries rang through the air instantly.

Almost all the experts from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race were sent flying, and several weaker ones were incinerated and they turned into ash instantly.

As for the eminent elder who sent out the attack, a hole appeared in his chest. The power of absolute blaze started to consume his body, and his cries filled the air. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Man Long stared at Huang Xiaolong’s group before him and he was at a loss of what to do.

When the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race were still stuck in a daze, the Black Shadow Devil slapped at the space before him. A giant palm covered the experts of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, and they started to shink.

When they shrunk to an unimaginably small size, their bodies popped and they turned into dust. Even Man Long wasn’t exempt from the Black Shadow Devil’s attack.

Everyone who watched the scene felt their limbs going cold. They ran away as quickly as they could.

A single palm eliminated nearly a hundred experts of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race! There were several dozen eminent elders among them, but they were killed just the same!

The eminent elders of various Origin Races stared at the scene as their jaws dropped in shock.

Ignoring those around him, he left with Lei Yu and the others. They made their way towards the Mystical Pavilion’s branch.

“Who is that human? He dared to kill the experts of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, and he even killed the young patriarch of the race!”

“His subordinate is too damn strong! He even managed to cause them to shrink!”

“That’s the power of space!” Someone cried out.

When they heard that it was the power of space, the experts in the surroundings erupted.

“Is he from the Destiny Race?! Don’t tell me that’s the Son of Destiny?!”

“He might actually be the Son of Destiny… Otherwise, why would he dare to kill the experts of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race? Since he killed Man Long, the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race will definitely not allow the matter to rest.”

The news reached the ears of Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen. They were shocked when they heard the news.

As Man Long was the young patriarch of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, he was someone important in the younger generation of the Origin Lands. Even though he wasn’t comparable to the two of them, he wasn’t that weak compared to the young patriarchs in the Origin Lands.

“The brat from the Heaven Piercer killed Man Long?!” Hao Zhen looked at the person who made the report and growled. His expression was extremely ugly.

He sent the members of the Treasure Lake Chamber of Commerce to knock Huang Xiaolong down a peg previously. Who would have thought that the man would go ahead and exterminate the entire group from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race as soon as they disembarked?

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t make his move on the Heaven Piercer, he was still insulting Hao Zhen’s authority.

“Yes, Your Highness, the black robed man beside the kid made the move. From what we heard, the black robed man controls the power of space. His palm caused the space around the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race to shrink and they eventually exploded!” The expert continued his report. “Someone said that the young man might be the Son of Destiny!”

“Son of Destiny?!” Hao Zhen and Lei Qianqian were shocked.

When they finally reacted, Hao Zhen’s expression turned serious. “Could he really be the Son of Destiny? I’ve heard that many experts from the Destiny Race entered our Origin Lands recently.”

Lei Qianqian shook her head. “He shouldn’t be the Son of Destiny. The experts of the Destiny Race entered the Green Snow Mountain after they arrived.”

The Green Snow Mountain was one of the forbidden lands in the Origin Lands.
