Chapter 3416: Meeting the Huang Family Again

When the four of them saw Huang Xiaolong again, they heaved a sigh of relief.

However, that didn’t last for long as they jumped in fright when they saw the Heavenless Devil Ancestor following closely behind.

“Heavenless!”

Ying Gou and the others drew their weapons and stood on guard immediately.

“I’m already serving the same master as you guys! There’s nothing to be afraid of!” The old devil yelled.

Sun Wukong and the others looked at each other in shock.

“Alright. Let’s return.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Now that he located the Pangu Sword, he couldn’t wait to return to Earth! He would discover the secret behind the Kunlun Secret Region!

It didn’t take long for them to return to the Devil World.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stay for long as he rushed back to the Immortal World. He allowed the two devil ancestors to remain in the Devil World along with the beasts he captured from the Devil Forest. He brought Sun Wukong, Ying Gou, and the Holy Phoenix when he arrived in the Devil World, and they were the only ones who left with him.

When they returned, Huang Xiaolong stayed in the Fruits and Flower Mountain for a single day.

Sun Wukong was extremely unwilling to part with Huang Xiaolong when he learned that Huang Xiaolong was leaving.

“Relax. There are many chances in the future. I will definitely return to the Immortal World. If you wish, I’ll bring you along when I leave the Pangu World in the future.”

Sun Wukong’s body jolted and he jumped in joy, “Many thanks, Your Highness!”

Ying Gou and the Holy Phoenix had already submitted to Huang Xiaolong, and they begged to follow him back to Earth.

However, Huang Xiaolong left both of them behind and offered them the same conditions as Sun Wukong.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After thanking Huang Xiaolong, they sent him off respectfully.

As soon as he left, Huang Xiaolong headed straight for Shushan Immortal Gate in the Dongsheng God Continent.

When he returned to the Shushan Immortal Gate, Mu Shuihan gathered all the disciples for a grand welcome. The experts in the surrounding region gathered at the Shushan Immortal Gate to greet Huang Xiaolong the moment he returned.

After allowing them to get up, Huang Xiaolong entered the main hall.

“Looks like you’ve been doing well.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Mu Shuihan.

Lowering his head, Mu Shuihan chuckled in embarrassment, “It’s all because of Your Highness’ grace…”

Since Huang Xiaolong suppressed Rulai under the Five Finger Mountain, everyone felt their hearts trembling at the mere mention of his name.

The experts of the Immortal World were racking their brains for a way to kiss up to Mu Shuihan, and they sent tons of gifts over. Even Song Zhipeng had to act respectfully around him.

Yan Baoer grinned when he addressed Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, you have no idea! Everyone in the region is trying to get close to us! It’s really unbearable to deal with their enthusiasm!”

Huang Xiaolong rubbed his head affectionately, “Is that so?”

“Yeah! When experts from the other regions run into us, they don’t even dare to raise their voices! In the past, we were the ones trying to suck up to them. Now, they’re finally experiencing what it feels like to be on the other end…”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement as laughter filled the hall.

After staying for a day and giving Mu Shuihan and Yan Baoer some pointers, he left the Shushan Immortal Gate. His next destination was Earth!

It didn’t take long for him to return.

Once again, he met Ye Zhaolong of the Panwu Immortal Gate.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was back, Ye Zhaolong fell to his knees. He didn’t dare to get up without permission.

The fact that Huang Xiaolong killed Liu Bing with a single punch, and his feat of returning from the Immortal World caused Ye Zhaolong’s legs to buckle in fear.

“Get up.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “I’m not here to mess with you. I need to return to Earth.”

As if he received an imperial pardon, Ye Zhaolong crawled to his feet.

Reporting everything to Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t dare to leave out the slightest detail.

Ever since Huang Xiaolong destroyed the seal leading to the Immortal World, the patriarchs of the various factions retreated and sealed off their sects. They forbade their disciples from messing about in the outside world.

The entire galaxy welcomed an era of peace.

After understanding what happened around the region, Huang Xiaolong left the Panwu Immortal Gate. He gave Ye Zhaolong a stalk of holy herb, and it was something he brought with him from the Immortal World. Even though it was one of the herbs of the lowest grades, it was a divine herb in Ye Zhaolong’s eyes. He kowtowed profusely after receiving the treasure.

Huang Xiaolong remained in the Immortal Worshiping Kingdom for half an hour before returning. He met Chen Tianzeng in the process.

When he returned to Earth, he couldn’t contain the joy in his heart. He was like a kid who came home after a long period of adventuring the outside world. It didn’t take long for him to charge towards the Huang Family Manor.

As Pangu’s restrictions were still active around Earth, he suppressed his cultivation base once again.

Huang Xiaolong arrived in the Blue Dragon Orchard, and after being away for more than a month, he was shocked at the changes.

There was a massive heavenly palace in the middle of the courtyard, and everyone close to him was practicing the Asura Sword Art he passed down to them. Even Lin Kai was present.

“That’s wrong!” Wang Meilan pointed out when she saw Lin Kai’s mistake. “You should swing your sword this way.”

There was a serious look on her face.

“That’s not right too! You should be doing this!” Huang Jiyuan interrupted.

Wang Meilan glared at him and snapped, “Do you think you’re stronger than me?! Why don’t we exchange pointers?!”

Huang Jiyuan turned mum the moment he heard her.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement at the side, and everyone stopped whatever they were doing. Turning to look at him, joy filled their hearts.

“Xiaolong!”

“Uncle!”

They ran towards him as quickly as they could.
