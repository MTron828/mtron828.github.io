Chapter 929: Are You Afraid?

Huang Xiaolong appeared unperturbed despite suddenly being the center of attention, “Whether I can get the first place or not… it doesn’t seem to be related to you. Who are you?”

Who are you? 

Mo Su’s condescending expression froze, then his face turned extremely ugly.

Jiang Lei had just referred to him as Devil Son Mo Su, he didn't believe Huang Xiaolong hadn't heard Jiang Lei’s words and was unable to guess his identity. Yet he actually dared to ignore him in public!

A nefarious glint flitted across Mo Su’s eyes, killing intent exploding from his body. The air current in his proximity stagnated.

After he had passed through the Hellion Tower’s tenth floor, his cultivation had risen to peak late-Eighth Order, just one step more and he would be able to break through to Ninth Order Highgod Realm.

Therefore, the moment Mo Su’s killing intent erupted, the average low and mid-level Highgod Realm cultivators in the vicinity felt an overwhelming pressure. The patrons in the restaurant quivered fearfully.

Huang Xiaolong continued as if he didn't feel anything, “If there’s nothing else, please roll away. Don’t stand there and block my view, you're affecting my drinking mood.”

‘What?!’

Both Mo Su and Jiang Lei were enraged. Just as Mo Su was about to attack, a figure wearing a wide brocade robe appeared. From this middle-aged man’s appearance, he was most likely the restaurant owner.

The owner arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong and the others, wearing a benign smile on his face, “Several guests, our restaurant is only a small business and the building is made of common wood and other such materials,thus it cannot withstand any fights. Please give me some face, how about these guests set another day to exchange pointers?”

A sharp glint shone in the depths of Mo Su’s eyes. He decided to kill the restaurant owner as well, but before he could make a move, Jiang Lei anxiously rushed to send him a sound transmission, beseeching him not to do anything.

Mo Su frowned at Jiang Lei’s plea, but was inwardly shocked as he took another glance at the restaurant owner. Obvious hesitation flashed across his face several times until his killing intent gradually converged.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong glanced meaningfully at the restaurant owner.

What exactly was this restaurant owner’s identity? Huang Xiaolong was sure that Jiang Lei must have said something to Mo Su in secret, causing him to be cautious.

After converging his killing intent, Mo Su fixed a piercing cold stare on Huang Xiaolong, saying “Huang Xiaolong, I hope you can still be this arrogant the next time we meet. Don’t think you’re going to win the first place just because you can use the Hundred Beast Diagram. In my eyes, you don’t even have the qualifications to be my disciple!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained deadpan, “Then, just because you’re skilled in the Thousand Beasts Diagram, it means you are certainly going to win the grand competition?”

Mo Su was stunned for a second, then erupted into laughter, “If I, who have achieved perfection stage in the Thousand Divine Beasts Diagram cannot win first place in the grand competition, are you saying that you, who merely grasped the Hundred Divine Beast Diagram can?”

Jiang Lei also erupted in loud laughter, “Didn’t I already say this brat is an idiot? But this level of idiocy exceeds my estimation!”

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze was cold as frost as it fell on Jiang Lei.

Mo Su spoke again, “if I hadn't been in seclusion some years ago in order to comprehend the Supreme Devil Art, missing the time to participate in the Highgod Advancement Tournament, you would never have had the chance to touch the first place. Let me tell you frankly that I have passed the Hellion Tower’s tenth floor, reaching that point in less than ten years’ time. If you could achieve the same, passing through the first to the tenth floor of the Hellion Tower in less than ten years, I shall acknowledge your talent as being equal to mine.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in response: “I’ve no such need.”

He had already went all the way up to the twelfth floor, clearing every floor’s trial, and obtained the Heaven Splitting Tenet.

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong didn't need to compare himself with Mo Su.

Mo Su’s thoughts, on the other hand, were different: “Are you afraid?”

Huang Xiaolong did not answer, returning to his wine. He was too lazy to bother further with these two clowns.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s attitude, Mo Su and Jiang Lei did not linger around, leaving to find a table. Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong got and left the restaurant.

Before leaving, Huang Xiaolong called for the same waiter, buying the remaining Celestial Blossom Wine using more than two billion.

A sharp glint flickered in Mo Su’s eyes as he watched Huang Xiaolong’s departing figure, his voice extremely cold, “I’m going to let this brat understand the consequences of offending me, Mo Su!”

Jiang Lei flashed a smile, “Actually, Brother Mo need not do anything. The Fortune Gate would never let this Huang Xiaolong leave the Divine Dan City alive.”

Mo Su nodded and stopped mentioning Huang Xiaolong.

Back in Sun Moon Residence, Huang Xiaolong continued his semi-seclusion, spending his days in cultivation.

In the blink of an eye, another month passed.

There were now two days left until the start of the Alchemist Grandmaster Grand Competition. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation finally reached the peak of early Seventh Order Highgod Realm.

But during this period, due to the lack of divine weapons and armors, his Heaven Splitting Tenet saw little progress.

As his cultivation reached peak early Seventh Order Highgod Realm, Huang Xiaolong ended his days of dull cultivation. Taking out over a hundred jugs of Celestial Blossom Wine, he drank alone.

‘That old man still hasn’t arrived at the Divine Dan City?’ Huang Xiaolong wondered where the Ascending Moon Old Man could be as he raised a wine bowl to his lips.

He had been in Divine Dan City for several months now, but there was still no news of the old man.

Logically, if the old man arrived in the Divine Dan City, he would have heard about his alchemist assessment that had been the talk of the city, and if the old man knew he was here, he would have surely come to find him.

Thinking of this, Huang Xiaolong’s brows scrunched together, ‘Did something happen?’ Right at this time, someone triggered the Sun Moon Residence’s outer formation.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised. When he came out, he saw Wangu Yanhui and Wangu Ye at his doors.

Wangu Yanhui smiled when he saw Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, us brothers came over, I hope we didn't disturb your cultivation.”

Huang Xiaolong returned a smile, “Of course not, I was just thinking how boring it is to drink alone, you guys arrived at the right time.” He invited both to enter.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Arriving at the yard, Wangu Yanhui saw the jugs of Celestian Blossom Wine and his eyes lit up as he exclaimed: “Celestial Blossom Wine!”

Even Wangu Ye’s gaze turned a little hot.

Wangu Yanhui laughed happily, “This Celestial Blossom Wine is the Divine Dan City’s most famous wine, ranked amongst the top three in the hundred thousand galaxies. Looks like us brothers are really lucky today.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “If you two have the time, we can finish these hundred jugs of wine.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s invitation, Wangu Yanhui and Wangu Ye said they have all the time in the world.

When the brothers stepped out from the Sun Moon Residence, it was already the next day.

The three of them talked about a lot of things, most of them related to the grand competition.

Of course, when the two left, all hundred over jugs of Celestial Blossom Wine were emptied, not a drop left.

…

Deep into the quiet night.

As the first ray of sunlight shone on the roof of the Sun Moon Residence, Huang Xiaolong who was adjusting his breathing in the yard slowly opened his eyes.

Today, the Alchemist Grandmaster Union Competition would begin!

Stepping out from his residence, Huang Xiaolong headed off in the direction of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union headquarters.

By the time he arrived, there was already a large crowd gathered.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

The instant he appeared, someone in the crowd shouted upon recognizing him, raising a wave of exclamation.

Holding the token in his hand, Huang Xiaolong walked into the fenced off section of the square where only registered disciples could enter. 

However, even this section of the square was densely crowded. Even though the number of disciples participating in the competition was much less compared to the Highgod Advancement Tournament, it still reached 1.2 million people!

After the preliminary round elimination, there would only be ten thousand participants remaining.
