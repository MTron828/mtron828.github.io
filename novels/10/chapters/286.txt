Chapter 287: Godly Xumi Art Resurfaced!

Soul Glacier Green Demon!

Looking at the Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong’s martial spirit, Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised. Jin Zhong’s Soul Glacier Green Demon was the most tyrannical among the ice element martial spiritㅡa top grade eleven superb martial spirits, and most of all, it was rare for top grade eleven martial spirit to appear!

Huang Xiaolong did not expect this Poison Saint Sect Elder’s talent to be so high. A person’s martial spirit grade indicated their future achievements in battle qi cultivation, if there were no mishaps, this Poison Saint Sect Elder could breakthrough until the peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order. That is to say, an existence infinitely close to a Saint realm expert.

Unfortunately, this person came across him!

Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong summoned his Soul Glacier Green Demon and instantly soul transformed. An armor made of crystallized ice covered Jin Zhong’s body, reflecting an eerie green glow underneath the sunlight, while in his immediate proximity floated wisps of frigid white air.

About a hundred meters away, Qin Yang, Li Fei, and the others felt the chilling cold despite the distance between them.

“Ten Thousand Li Glacial Storm!” At this time, Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong’s icy voice cut through the air. The green glow on his body shone like the sun, covering the four directions. Where the light spread, from the ground up, everything was frozen into ice; pieces of rock, dust and sand were all covered with a layer of glacial ice.

Under this cold assault, Huang Xiaolong’s worldly Buddha luminescence and and Earthen Buddha Palm were affected, its attack power reduced significantly by the time it reached the Poison Saint Sect Elder.

“Truly unexpected that you martial spirit is actually a Primordial Divine Black Dragon!” After breaking Huang Xiaolong’s Earthen Buddha Palm, Jin Zhong hovered in mid-air, glowering at Huang Xiaolong with surging killing intent. In his several hundred years of cultivation, this was his first time he came across someone who possessed a higher grade martial spirit than his own.

“Dai~!” Jin Zhong suddenly shouted; invisible soundwave rushed toward Huang Xiaolong, and he followed up with a punch.

Perceiving the violent energy fluctuations, Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent. He then wrapped the Buddhism energy around his body and projected it out, disrupting the opponent’s Great Demonic Yin Soundwave attack easily. Simultaneously, Huang Xiaolong raised both arms, countering with the second wave of attack.

Bang! A thunderous explosion resounded. The explosion shook the eardrums of Qin Yang’s group with pain, causing them to look over at Huang Xiaolong’s side with concern. What they saw was Huang Xiaolong and the Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong both staggered backward at the same time.

Jin Zhong looked at his arms to find the glacial armor covering his body was actually shattered by Huang Xiaolong’s fist in the arm area. Multiple crack lines traveled up to his upper arms from his fists. This result both shocked and angered him, he hurried to look over at Huang Xiaolong’s side. Seeing that Huang Xiaolong’s black dragon scale armor was tainted with a green glacial ice, Jin Zhong became ecstatic. He sneered, “Punk, you’ve been poisoned with my extreme cold poison, very soon, you’ll be turned into an ice sculpture, hehe.”

Extreme Cold Poison, this was Jin Zhong’s Soul Glacial Green Demon martial spirit’s innate ability. His Soul Glacial Green Demon was the strongest amongst ice element martial spirits and its extreme cold poison was no doubt one of the most tyrannical cold poisons in existence, even deadlier than an ice element martial spirit one grade above. Not even a Xiantian Ninth Order expert could easily resolve being poisoned with his extreme cold poison.

“Ice sculpture.” Huang Xiaolong glanced nonchalantly at the green glacial ice dotted his fists keep spreading. One breath, two breaths, the green glacial ice had covered Huang Xiaolong’s arms entirely and was spreading to other parts of Huang Xiaolong’s body at rapid speed.

Qin Yang and the others were anxious and fretful.

“Young Lord, quick, cut your arm off!” Qin Yang even cried out in agitation.

Qin Yang was aware how horrible the extreme cold poison’s effect was, only by chopping off his arm could Huang Xiaolong be saved. Otherwise it would be too late once the poison spread to his body.

Yet, Huang Xiaolong doesn’t seem affected as he studied the green glacial ice calmly, and in the blink of an eye, the green glacial ice already spread to Huang Xiaolong’s chest, head, both legs, until his whole body was covered.

In less than a dozen breaths’ time, Huang Xiaolong was turned into an ice sculpture.

Seeing this, Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong heavily breathed out in relieved. In the next second, he laughed heartily as he approached the green ice sculpture that was Huang Xiaolong.

“Hehe, top grade twelve martial spirit, Divine Black Dragon is only this much!” Jin Zhong was vainglorious, “The way I see it, this Black Dragon’s grading should be switched with my Soul Glacier Green Demon!”

Watching this result, the other Poison Saint Sect Elder, Qiao Liang, sighed in relieved.

However, before Qiao Liang’s breath of relief ended, the two giant puppets that he was fighting abruptly attacked, scaring Qiao Liang in a flustered retreat. His face was ashen realizing something; logically, with Huang Xiaolong’s death, these giant puppets controlled by him should not be moving, but why were they...?!

His head snapped around toward where Huang Xiaolong was, frozen in green colored glacial ice, and cried out: “Jin Zhong, careful!” Just as his voice fell, the green ice sculpture exploded. Pieces of green glacial ice ricocheted all around, Huang Xiaolong’s figure was seen shooting straight up to the air, and with a sway, he vanished from sight.

Jin Zhong retreated in alarm. Watching Huang Xiaolong vanished right before his eyes, Jin Zhong was stunned again. His face tightened the next moment, but it was too late when he wanted to dodge.

Huang Xiaolong reappeared, printing a palm directly on Jin Zhong’s chest.

Jin Zhong grunted from the force, half flying half stumbling backward, as far as several meters. When he finally managed to steady himself, Qiao Liang saw that Jin Zhong’s chest was imprinted with a black palm print. Black demonic qi spread rapidly, covering Jin Zhong’s entire body, melting the layer of green glacial ice armor while Jin Zhong wailed miserably.

“Elder Jin!” Qiao Liang and the Poison Saint Sect disciples cried out.

Huang Xiaolong moved again, this time, his body shrouded brightly in holy Buddha luminescence; in front of an astounded Qiao Liang and Poison Saint Sect disciples, more than a dozen arms ‘grew’ from Huang Xiaolong’s back! A dozen arms formed a fist simultaneously, punching onto Elder Jin Zhong’s chest in a torrent of fist, all at the same time.

Bang! A loud rumbling sound rang out as the layer of green glacial ice shattered and Elder Jin Zhong was seen sprawled on the ground.

All of a sudden, the noisy fighting scene quieted.

A brief moment later, Poison Saint Sect Elder Jin Zhong tottered as he tried to get up from the ground, spewing out blood.

“You, what battle skill was that just now?!” Jin Zhong’s voice sounded hoarse, unable to conceal the fear in his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Jin Zhong, ever indifferent: “Godly Xumi Art.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Jin Zhong and Qiao Liang blanked, before the shock set in as if they saw a ghost in broad daylight; their entire bodies trembled even as they pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong.

“Xu, Xu, Godㅡ, Godly Xumi Art?!!”

“No, no, not possible, Godly Xumi Art! How could it be the Godly Xumi Art!!” Jin Zhong and Qiao Liang were stammered like people with a severe stutter.

Godly Xumi Art!

The number one battle skill in this heaven and earth! After more than several tens of thousands of years, it finally resurfaced again! Furthermore, it happened right in front of them!

When the words left Jin Zhong’s mouth, muffled blasts came from his body. Qiao Liang looked over and saw one after another golden fist imprint hovered close to Jin Zhong as he screamed. Moments later, Jin Zhong disappeared from the world.
