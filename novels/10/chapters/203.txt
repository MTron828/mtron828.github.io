Chapter 204: Then My Surname’s Not Guo

“There might be a way.” Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment and then thrill took over, “What way?!”

“Godly Mt. Xumi!” Zhao Shu sounded dignified at the suggestion.

“Godly Mt. Xumi!” Huang Xiaolong repeated in a daze. The next moment, a sharp light flashed in his eyes, “You’re implying the same Godly Mt. Xumi on the Heavenly Treasure List?”

Zhao Shu nodded, “Correct, the number one wonder that sits at the top of the Heavenly Treasure List. Godly Mt. Xumi possesses a very unique mystical power and yields a liquid called Geocentric Buddha Elixir. If one could swallow the Geocentric Buddha Elixir, their cultivation would progress as rapidly as a stallion flying a thousand li in a day. If I were to take a guess at what wondrous treasure between heaven and earth could help Sovereign break through to Xiantian Tenth Order in the shortest amount of time possible, then it could only be the Godly Mt. Xumi!”

“Godly Mt. Xumi!” Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply.

Zhao Shu continued, “To subdue the Godly Mt. Xumi, that person must possess two of the the same kind of superb talent martial spirit, and one of them must be at least grade thirteen or above. Coincidentally Sovereign, you’re someone with two of the same kind of superb talent martial spirit, with one being a Blue Dragon above grade thirteen.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. A certain light shone in his eyes as his voice gravely sounded, “However, I heard the Godly Mt. Xumi only appeared one time several million years ago and has never appeared again since.”

This was the most crucial point.

Even if Huang Xiaolong had two of the same kind of superb talent martial spirit and fulfilled the requirement to subdue the Godly Mt. Xumi with one of his martial spirits being above grade thirteen, he didn’t even know where the Godly Mt. Xumi was. How was he going to get a hold of it?

“The truth is, this Subordinate has a rough idea as to where the Godly Mt. Xumi could be.” Zhao Shu suddenly released some unexpected and earth shattering news.

“What?!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes rounded wide with the shocking revelation.

Zhao Shu nodded his head, “A few years ago, Subordinate stumbled upon the Godly Mt. Xumi’s possible location from an ancient buddhist scripture. If I’m not mistaken, the Godly Mt. Xumi should be in the Blessed Buddha Empire’s Buddha Cavern.”

“Blessed Buddha Empire’s Buddha Cavern!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up.

On Snow Wind Continent, there were seventeen empires.

Blessed Buddha Empire was definitely one of the three most powerful empires amongst all seventeen. However, Blessed Buddha Empire was located on the most southern point of Snow Wind Continent, the distance from Duanren Empire was no joke. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yes, Blessed Buddha Empire’s Buddha Cavern!” Zhao Shu confirmed. Despite that, a small doubt surfaced, “Sovereign, this Buddha Cavern is Blessed Buddha Empire’s sacred cavern, to enter is easier said than done!”

Although Zhao Shu had surmised the whereabouts of the Godly Mt. Xumi from an ancient buddhist scripture, the Buddha Cavern was heavily guarded by many experts due to its exalted existence as the sacred cavern in Blessed Buddha Empire. This was also one of the reasons that deterred Zhao Shu from going to the Buddha Cavern.

Of course, the actual reason Zhao Shu did not adamantly pursue the Godly Mt. Xumi was because he did not possess two of the same kind of superb talent martial spirit, so that decimated his chances of trying to subdue the Heavenly Treasure List’s number one treasure. Since there was no chance, there was no use in him going to Blessed Buddha Empire.

"Blessed Buddha Empire, Buddha Cavern!" Huang Xiaolong’s brows scrunched together tightly.

Now that the whereabouts of the Godly Mt. Xumi was known, Huang Xiaolong was relieved. But for it to be at Blessed Buddha Empire’s Buddha Cavern...

"Sovereign." A short while later, Zhao Shu called out and pulled Huang Xiaolong back to the present after seeing how immersed he was within his own chaotic thoughts.

Huang Xiaolong awoke from the trailing thoughts running through his head.

"Has Sovereign decided to make a trip to the Blessed Buddha Empire’s Buddha Cavern now, or...?" Zhao Shu asked.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, "We’ll talk again later."

Even if it didn’t exceed one year, journeying from Duanren Empire to Blessed Buddha Empire would take at least eight to nine months if relying on Huang Xiaolong’s current speed. Moreover, reaching Blessed Buddha Empire didn’t mean he could just waltz into their sacred cavern. Thus it would be best if he first found the Absolute Soul Pearl in Duanren Institute before thinking about obtaining the Godly Mt. Xumi.

The Absolute Soul Pearl might carry less novelty compared to the Godly Mt. Xumi, but regardless of that, it was still a Heavenly Treasure ranked at fourth place. Subduing the Absolute Soul Pearl could enhance Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed just the same.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong asked Zhao Shu questions pertaining to the Godly Mt. Xumi and Blessed Buddha Empire which Zhao Shu answered as honestly he could with what little knowledge he had.

In fact, Zhao Shu only guessed that the Godly Mt. Xumi was in the Buddha Cavern due to the buddhist scriptures he previously saw. As to it its exact location, Zhao Shu had no real inclination.

The word ‘enormous’ was not enough to properly describe Blessed Buddha Empire’s Buddha Cavern, for it was several times bigger than Duanren Square.

Even if Huang Xiaolong succeeded in entering the Buddha Cavern, locating the Godly Mt. Xumi itself was going to prove to be an arduous task.

Not long after, Zhao Shu left.

After Zhao Shu left, Huang Xiaolong once again pondered. His plan now was to subdue the Absolute Soul Pearl at the earliest possible time and then rush to Blessed Buddha Empire.

Nonetheless, whether it was the Absolute Soul Pearl or Godly Mt. Xumi, Huang Xiaolong was determined to obtain them!

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong triggered the God Binding Ring and entered the ancient battlefield to begin his practice.

The night passed.

Exiting the ancient battlefield, Huang Xiaolong left Southern Hill Estate, heading directly to the inner division grounds while carrying the Golden Token with him. His plan was to continue the same hunt he had for the past weeks, trying to sense the Absolute Soul Pearl’s presence through the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and God Binding Ring.

But when the passing Duanren Institute students saw Huang Xiaolong, the emotions they secretly held towards him were drastically different from before.

There was reverence, schadenfreude, jealousy, and even admiration.

The news about Huang Xiaolong turning the Guo Brothers into pig-faced fools had already spread to every corner of the Institute.

Although Guo Zhi and Gui Fei’s status was less illustrious when compared to Duan Wuhen, Yao Fei, and the several superfamilies, their existence held similar regard. Yet, both of them had been smacked around so hard that they became unrecognizable!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the strange looks being thrown his way and ’wandered idly’ within the inner division for the whole day.

Night once again descended.

Looking at the time, Huang Xiaolong decided to leave for the day, planning to return to Southern Hill Estate and then continue searching tomorrow.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the inner division grounds, a group of people far off in the distance rushed up to him. They were led by none other than the Guo Zhi and Guo Fei duo who had been beaten to a pulp by Huang Xiaolong the day before.

As Guo Zhi, Guo Fei, and their gang whirled through like a blizzard, all the other students steered clear away from them.

Watching Guo Zhi and Guo Fei coming for him, Huang Xiaolong sneered and did not move. He stood still at the same spot, welcoming their arrival with a calm expression on his face.

Guo Zhi’s group of people reached Huang Xiaolong very quickly, spreading out in an encirclement.

Just a day had passed and the brothers’ swollen pig-faced heads had mostly recovered, likely due to the miraculous effects of some expensive medicine.

“Lil’ doggy Huang, with that old dog Zhao Shu is not at your side, I want to see who else can save you this time!" Guo Zhi chuckled sinisterly, laughter twisting with hate. His eyes filled with venom as he glowered at Huang Xiaolong.

"Oh really?" the temperature in Huang Xiaolong’s voice dropped.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant reaction, the rage in his heart erupted. A finger pointed at Huang Xiaolong, he was close to hollering, "Huang Xiaolong, you mongrel dog bastard! If I don’t cripple you today and beat you up until your Mom can’t recognize you, then my surname’s not Guo!"

"Go, attack, I want this mongrel dog taught a lesson. Just make sure he doesn’t die on the spot!" Guo Zhi roared, signaling his lackey with a wave of his hand.

Just when Guo Zhi and Guo Fei’s lackeys were about to move out, a lazy and slow yet dignified voice cried: "Wait!"

The Guo Brothers could not help but stop.

"Who the fuck dares to interfere in my affairs!" Hearing someone speak up and disturb him, he barked and spun around.
