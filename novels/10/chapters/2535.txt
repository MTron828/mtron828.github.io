Chapter 2536: Entering the Seventh Floor

The fear in Li Chen’s heart grew to a whole new level when he saw that Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother speaking to Xie Bufan before throwing him into the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

“Huang Xiaolong! We’re both disciples of the Holy Heavens! If you really kill me, the Primal Ancestors won’t let you off! I believe you know the punishment for a disciple who kills a fellow disciple of the organization!”

“If you kill me, you’ll suffer when you return to the organization!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sneer when he heard Li Chen’s threats. “Li Chen, since you know about the rules of our organization, you should know the consequences of working with Xie Bufan to kill me. What do you think the Primal Ancestors would think when they learn of this? They will probably celebrate your death along with me.”

“Even if I kill you, I will be doing a favor for the Holy Heavens! I’ll be rewarded for killing a traitor!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“You should just give up on the little ideas you have in your head right now.”

Huang Xiaolong sealed up Li Chen’s energy without saying anything more.

“Huang Xiaolong, you can’t kill me! If you spare my life, I’ll agree to be your follower!” Li Chen begged, “I’ll hand over the position of the leader of the Holy Princes, and I’ll listen to whatever you say! I will never go against you again, and I won’t listen to Fu Yunjie’s stupid suggestions! That’s right! Fu Yunjie was the cause of this, and we never held a grudge for each other to begin with! I would never think of killing you!”

Li Chen wore a face of regret when he blabbered on.

Seeing as Li Chen was trying to push everything on Fu Yunjie, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but shake his head silently. “Li Chen, you won’t even be able to lie to a three year old with your methods. Do you really think that someone like Fu Yunjie can control your actions? You might have listened to him at the start to develop some sort of discontent for me. After the repeated defeats, your hatred for me went through the roof. Did you think I was blind?”

“When the Cangqiong Holy Manor opened, you conspired with Xie Bufan to kill me at all costs…”

Li Chen wanted to refute, but Huang Xiaolong resolutely threw him into the Black Corpse Holy Ring before retrieving both the Fiend Moon Blade and the Eight Sided Desolate Beast Ring.

Unwilling to remain in the battlefield, he swept his arm once to erase all traces of the outcome of the battle before leaving.

Not too long after he left, a figure tore through the skies to arrive at the place they had fought.

Tan Juan’s expression changed when she noticed the destroyed surroundings.

“Primal Ancestor qi! Someone used a dao artifact here!”

“What shocking dragon, evil, and devil qi?! There’s Buddhist qi in the air as well! Who in the world engaged in battle here?!”

Sweeping her gaze across the surroundings, Tan Juan tried her best to dig for the outcome of the battle. She even used a secret art of the Clear Snow Palace, but she could only ascertain that Li Chen and Xie Bufan were part of the battle.

She also managed to sense a mysterious presence, but she failed to determine his identity.

“Could the last person be Huang Xiaolong?” A thought flashed through her mind. But she quickly shook her head to dispel the thought. After all, Huang Xiaolong shouldn’t be capable of causing so much damage. No matter how strong he was, he wouldn’t be able to challenge Xie Bufan and Li Chen at the same time.

“It seems like the key was obtained by one of them. I’ll be able to know what happened as soon as I locate Li Chen or Xie Bufan.” Tan Juan thought to herself as she soared through the skies.

The most important thing she had to do was to locate either of them.

From Xue Lingyun, she had learned that one needed to comprehend the grand dao law in the key before they could open the gates to the seventh floor.

From her master’s estimates, even someone like her would need an entire day to comprehend the grand dao law contained in the key. No one could compare to her comprehension speed, and as long as she found Li Chen or Xie Bufan, she would stand a chance to enter the seventh floor!

When the battle on the sixth floor stopped, the light rays emitted by the manor started to fade. Everyone outside couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

“It stopped! Who won?! How could the battle end so quickly?”

After all, they only battled for less than half an hour!

“Who obtained the key to the seventh floor?”

“Tan Juan? Xie Bufan? Could it be Li Chen? In fact, Li Xinyi is also a contender!” Someone guessed.

“Tan Juan probably obtained the key!”

“No! Xie Bufan won the battle!”

Everyone started guessing blindly as soon as the battle concluded.

Cao Nan couldn’t help but sneer when he heard the discussions in the surroundings.

It seemed as though Xie Bufan was the final victor of the battle. He had to reward this disciple heavily when he returned… T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Tyrant Chu didn’t speak as thoughts ran through his mind.

Xue Lingyun was extremely anxious as she transmitted her questions to the Cangqiong Old Man in secret.

“Lord Mo Cangli, who do you think managed to obtain the key?” Duan Xuan asked Mo Cangli carefully.

After thinking about it, he shook his head slowly. “It’s either Tan Juan, Li Chen, or Xie Bufan. I have no idea.”

It was indeed impossible to make a guess.

After all, all of them were equally as strong and they had hidden trump cards up their sleeves.

However, he could be sure of one thing. It was impossible for the fourth person to obtain the key.

…

After Huang Xiaolong left the scene of battle, he looked for a quiet spot to retrieve the key. Activating his Dao Heart, he started to comprehend the grand dao left behind in the key.

He took less than half an hour to fully comprehend the grand dao law, and the instant he did, the key released blinding rays of light that pierced into the void. In response, rainbow-colored light emerged from the void and enveloped Huang Xiaolong.

The disturbance shook the entire sixth floor and Tan Juan was naturally able to notice the change. A look of shock formed on her face. According to her master, the sixth floor would only be filled with rainbow-colored light when someone successfully comprehended the grand dao law left in the key!

How is it possible?!

It hasn’t even been half an hour!

Even with my talent, it would take an entire day!

Her shock did nothing to stop Huang Xiaolong from entering a tunnel that formed in the void. As the surroundings changed around him, he realized that he had left the sixth floor.

“Is this the seventh floor?” Huang Xiaolong stared at the endless plains before him.

Other than the holy spiritual qi in the air being a little denser than the sixth floor, there wasn’t much difference.

After a slight pause, Huang Xiaolong started to fly towards the edge of the plains. He knew that it wouldn’t be too late for him to refine both of them after accepting the inheritance.
