Chapter 2730: Dealing with Huang Xiaolong

After finding out that Huang Xiaolong had come to the Ice Blue Sacred Land because of her, Wang Xueru’s face softened as she spoke, “Only True Saints will be able to enter the competition. The two First Resurrecion Primal Ancestors you hired cannot represent our Cangqiong Sacred Land..

Her meaning couldn’t be more clear. As a Ninth Heaven True Saint, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to change the outcome of the battle.

Hiring two First Resurrection Primal Ancestor experts? Fei Yanzi, Zi Dongping had strange expressions when they heard what she said.

Even Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, Duan Feng, and Long Shengtian were bewildered.

Fei Yanzi laughed, “I can definitely say that he hasn’t paid me a single cent.”

Wang Xueru and the others turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. Not paid?

Huang Xiaolong smiled but he didn’t plan on explaining himself. Instead, he said, “It’s okay. Even if they can’t participate, I can, right?”

“You?” Wang Xueru retracted her gaze from Fei Yanzi and looked at Huang Xiaolong. She shook her head slowly, “You’re master’s direct disciple, and you’re definitely talented. However, your cultivation base is too low. You will not be able to defeat Tang Jin or Yuan Yue! When that happens, I won’t be able to answer to master.”

The looks on the faces of Long Jianfei and the others turned strange in an instant.

The smile on Fei Yanzi grew even wider.

Wang Xueru was puzzled as she didn’t understand the weird looks she was getting.

Huang XIaolong smiled. “Don’t worry. I have faced several peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saints in my life. None of them were able to match up to me. I should be able to deal with Yuan Yue and Tang Jin.”

Wang Xueru was stunned, but she continued, “Those peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saints you met before probably had ordinary combat power, but Tang Jin and Yuan Yue are different. They are extremely strong for experts in the True Saint Realm, and the two of them will be able to defeat even First Resurrection Primal Ancestors if they join hands!”

One could only imagine how strong they were!

Wang Xueru couldn’t help but feel respect for the two when she mentioned their strength.

With her abilities, it would be difficult for her to take a few hits from a Primal Ancestor even if she reached the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

It seemed as though Tang Jin and Yuan Yue weren’t weak. They were comparable to Li Chen and Xie Bufan of the Cangqiong Holy World.

However, they would be far too lacking when compared to Tan Juan. As for Yuan Qianxing, they would have been merely ants in front of him. One had to know that Yuan Qianxing had the ability to fight a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor when he was only at the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm. Even a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor like Long Shengtian wouldn’t be able to suppress Yuan Qianxing!

After seeing the weird look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, Wang Xueru giggled, “What’s wrong? Are you frightened by their combat prowess?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Indeed. They seem to be pretty strong.”

“Puff!” Long Shengtian, Long Jianfei, and Zi Dongping failed to control their laughter. As for Fei Yanzi, she didn’t bother smiling. She just rolled her eyes at him.

Even though Mo Zhi and Duan Feng didn’t laugh, a smile started to form on their faces. They wondered if Tang Jin and Yuan Yue could be considered lucky as Huang Xiaolong had praised their strength…𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“However, I still wish to participate in the Convent of the Wind and Clouds,” Huang Xiaolong said.

Wang Xueru was startled and she tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong several times. In the end, she gave up.

“Alright, you can participate, but when we enter the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, you have to listen to me! You can’t act recklessly!” Wang Xueru instructed.

“Alright, I won’t be reckless,” Huang Xiaolong assured her. As for listening to her, that was another story altogether.

Eventually, the entire group made their way towards the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak.

Since they had to travel with the members of the Cangqiong Sacred Land, they only managed to arrive three days later.

Since Primal Ancestors were not allowed at the venue, Long Jianfei and the others could only wait outside.

Wang Xueru stared at all of them in shock, “Are all of you Primal Ancestors?!”

The remaining disciples looked at Huang Xiaolong doubtfully.

Huang Xiaolong smiled indifferently, “Yes, they are.”

Wang Xueru was stunned, speechless. “How did you get so many Primal Ancestors on your side?!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “You can guess.”

After thinking a while, Wang Xueru said, “Do they owe you a debt of gratitude?” She couldn’t think of any other reason to explain why the six Primal Ancestors were willingly following Huang Xiaolong.

“Sure. You can think of it however you like.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head casually. After all, they did receive his help in the past.

A look of envy formed on Wang Xueru’s face.

Isn’t he too damn lucky to gain six friends in the Primal Ancestor Realm?!

Just as they were about to enter the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, Chu Zhouyun and the disciples from the Chufan Sacred Land arrived.

Two well-built youngsters sat before Chu Zhouyuan, and they were Tang Jin and Yuan Yue. When the two of them heard about his injury, they were shocked. Since they had some friendship with Chu Zhouyun, they decided to help him out a little.

When they asked about his injury, Chu Zhouyun couldn't help but grit his teeth. “It’s all because of that b*tch, Wang Xueru! There’s that little f*cker Huang Xiaolong too! If I don’t skin him alive, I won’t be called Chu Zhouyun!”

Tang Jin and Yuan Yue looked at each other suspiciously.

Huang Xiaolong?

Chu Zhouyun told them everything that had happened.

When they heard that Huang Xiaolong was the Cangqiong Old Man’s direct disciple, they were shocked. That was the first time they were hearing that the old man had accepted a direct disciple.

“He’s definitely someone the old foggy accepted in the past.” Tang Jin muttered, “Are the two Primal Ancestors around him hired?!”

Yuan Yue sneered, “Who cares about that?! Everyone who laid a hand on Brother Chu will die! Not to worry. If he dares to take part in the Convent of the Wind and Clouds, we will deal with him!”

Chu Zhouyun said, “Many thanks Brother Yuan Yue. He’s only a mid-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm expert. As long as the Primal Ancestors he hired don’t appear, I can deal with him alone!”

All of a sudden, a disciple of the Chufan Sacred Land reported that Wang Xueru had arrived.

“What about Huang Xiaolong?” Chu Zhouyun asked.

“Huang Xiaolong is with her. The six people who were following him are waiting outside the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak,” The disciple from the Chufan Sacred Land reported.
