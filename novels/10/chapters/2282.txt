Chapter 2283: Trample on Huang Xiaolong!

The moment his fist shot out, dragon qi swept through the area and turned into majestic dragons that soared through the skies. Sealing the space Huang Xiaolong was in, there was no chance for him to escape!

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong was blown away by the dragon qi, and he was thrown to a corner of the stage.

Feng Tianyu felt his heart skipping a beat when he saw what happened

Jiang Tian, Jiang Wuji, Tan Hongyi, and the others were the exact opposite as they revealed brilliant smiles.

“Nice!” Qu Jiangmeng clapped and roared with laughter, “Junior Brother Yang Rong’s Dragon Fist was well executed! Amazing!”

When he was pushed away and slammed into the gates of the Jiang Family by Huang Xiaolong’s guardian previously, he had felt extremely humiliated. Right now, he felt as though Yang Rong had helped to regain his honor when he blew Huang Xiaolong away.

The guardians felt tier hearts leaping to their throats when they saw what happened. They were like Feng Tianyu, and they didn’t expect for Huang Xiaolong to be on the losing end the moment the battle started. Moreover, they had tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong the night before. When they had seen his adamant attitude to participate in the battle, they could only back down.

However... Huang Xiaolong was sent flying with a single move from Yang Rong! Even an id*ot couldn’t see the difference in strength!

As the four guardians stared at each other and saw the unwavering determination in each other’s eyes, they knew that they were thinking of the same thing. As soon as Huang Xiaolong lost the battle, they would interfere and save him at all costs!

Li Wen had already given them the order to protect Huang Xiaolong regardless of the cost when they had left the headquarters. Even if they had to give up their lives, they had to protect Huang Xiaolong! Even if the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate were to be destroyed, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t die!

Yang Rong approached Huang Xiaolong slowly and sneered when he saw that it took a single attack to push Huang Xiaolong to the edge of the arena. “Huang Xiaolong, weren’t you thinking of killing me previously? What’s wrong? Can’t you stand up like a man to speak to me? Are your legs going soft? Hahaha! We said it a long time ago. Trash like you should just hide in your Holy Gate! How dare you strut about in front of me?!”

Huang Xiaolong slowly got to his feet, and the wounds on his body started to heal at a rate visible to the naked eye.

Yang Rong wasn’t surprised at all. After all, he had never felt that it was possible to kill Huang Xiaolong with a single move.

A cold light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and the Infinite Brilliance Divine Dragon Saint Godhead started to rotate. In an instant, seven-colored dragon qi pierced into the skies and fused to form a seven-colored divine dragon.

“Infinite Brilliance Divine Dragon Saint Godhead...” Tan Hongyi sneered, “It’s just a godhead ranked at three thousand two hundred and eighty....”

Jiang Tian, Jiang Wuji, and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong’s godhead and heaved a sigh of relief. Even though his godhead had already surpassed their expectations, it wasn’t by much. It was still a fair distance away from Yang Rong’s Dragon Swallowing Saint Godhead ranked in the two thousand and seven hundreds.

Now that they had confirmed the rank of Huang Xiaolong’s godhead, there wasn’t much left to take note of.

Yang Rong sneered, “Huang Xiaolong is this your complete dao saint godhead? I bet you have no idea what mine is!” The Dragon Swallowing Saint Godhead started to rotate, and massive Devouring Dragons appeared in the space above them.

“Dragon Swallowing Saint Godhead!”

The experts at the side yelled in excitement.

Yang Rong was especially proud of himself and he started to gloat. “That’s right. This is my Dragon Swallowing Saint Godhead. It’s ranked in the two thousand and seven hundreds! Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that my talent is lower than yours just because I’m ranked in the bottom in the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground? Hehe!”

“Are you starting to regret your actions? Hahaha! Are you feeling despair?! Are you feeling helpless?!”

“Why don’t you beg me to spare your life now?”

Yang Rong roared with laughter as he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Too bad it’s too late for that! No amount of begging will help you!” Yang Rong paused for a second to catch his breath before he continued, “From the moment you stepped onto the arena, you sealed your fate!”

“I’m going to trample on you!”

Awakening the saint bloodline and Saint physique in him, azure scales formed around his body.

“Azure Dragon Saint bloodline!”

“It’s ranked in the two thousand eight hundreds among the saint bloodlines!”

Yang Rong didn’t forget to flaunt his saint physique.

“It’s the Demonic Dragon Saint physique!”

“It’s stronger than the Azure Dragon bloodline by quite a bit!”

Yang Rong slowly approached Huang Xiaolong as he suppressed the other party with his aura.

Qu Jiangmeng, who was standing under the arena, chuckled happily, “Junior Brother Yang, don’t kill him immediately! You have to trample on him for us to enjoy his pitiful screams!”

“Senior Brother Qu, you don’t have to worry.” Yang Rong sneered, “I’ll make this brat beg for death!”

As soon as the words left his lips, his figure blurred as he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Huang Xiaolong, I’ll disfigure you right now! I hate seeing that stupid face of yours!”

He was indeed a little irritated that Huang Xiaolong was more handsome than him.

The image of Huang Xiaolong being beaten into a pig head by him surfaced in his mind and a burst of joy filled his heart. However, terrifying dragon might surged out of Huang Xiaolong’s body in the next instant,shocking everyone present. Under the shocked gaze of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong transformed into a primordial blue divine dragon.

Reaching out with a claw, Huang Xiaolong welcomed Yang Rong’s punch.

Boom!

Pain shot up his arm and Yang Rong felt his body trembling in pain. He was sent flying and when he finally smashed into the ground, he saw that the skin on his fist was torn to shreds. Blood spewed from his lips.

“What?!” Jiang Tian, Jiang Wuji, and the others yelled in surprise.

Feng Tianyu looked at the primordial blue divine dragon in the arena as a smile formed on his face.

“Dragon Race?!” Several family leaders couldn’t help but exclaim in shock.

Jiang Wuji quickly recovered from his shock, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong. “No! He’s not from the Dragon Race!”

“Not from the Dragon Race?!” Jiang Tian and the others felt a little surprised. Like the family leaders in the crowd, they assumed that Huang Xiaolong was from the Primordial Divine Dragon Race when he transformed.

How could he possibly transform into a primordial divine dragon if he wasn’t from the Dragon Race?! It was very clear that this wasn’t a secret technique he performed.

A weird light flashed in Jiang Wuji’s eyes as he explained, “Some special transformation happened to his body for him to be able to transform into a primordial divine dragon....”

Tan Hongyi laughed coldly and continued, “Even if he turns into a primordial divine dragon, he won’t be able to change the outcome. Junior Brother Yang Rong is strong enough to suppress him regardless. He only managed to injure Junior Brother Yang because of a moment of carelessness.”

Qu Jiangmeng and the others quickly agreed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

On the stage, Yang Rong leaped to his feet as he got rid of the bloodstains around his lips. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and revealed a sinister laugh. “Good. I never thought that trash like you would be able to transform into a primordial divine dragon. This makes it all the more interesting!”

As dragon might gathered around him, Yang Rong’s aura increased yet again. A dragon’s horn slowly emerged from Yang Rong’s forehead and long spikes grew out from his body.

From afar, it seemed like he had transformed into a draconian.

“This is a holy martial art of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground, called the Dragon Beast!” Fàn Fān yelled in shock.

“That’s right! Junior Brother Yang Rong cultivated the holy martial art, Dragon Beast, by soaking himself in dragon’s blood! After a hundred thousand years, he managed to reach small completion and his strength doubled after his transformation! Killing Huang Xiaolong is nothing more than a flick of the wrist!” Qu Jiangmeng laughed.
