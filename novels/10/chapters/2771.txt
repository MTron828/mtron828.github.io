Chapter 2772: Everyone Attack!

After leaving the auction house, Huang Xiaolong’s group did not return to the rented courtyard and instead, they headed straight to the Saint Devil City’s city gates.

They had already checked out from the courtyard before attending the auction.

Chen Hong spotted Huang Xiaolong heading towards the city gates looking anxious, and his sarcasm intensified, “As I expected, this hillbilly is in a hurry to leave the city!” He turned to the side and asked the expert beside him, “Has Eminent Elder Cheng Feng’s group arrived?”

“They’ll be here soon, half an hour at most. Rest assured, Young Lord. Before they step out of the Saint Devil City, Eminent Elder Cheng Feng and the others will definitely be here!” The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s expert replied.

Chen Hong chuckled, “That’s good. There must be a lot of treasures on that hillbilly, and after we’ve dealt with him, everyone will be rewarded!” The thirty-plus experts behind him were delighted and quickly thanked Chen Hong.

As they hurried to the city gates, Duan Feng said to Huang Xiaolong, “Young Lord, that Chen Hong really followed us out of the auction hall. It seems like he’s going to act on us the moment we leave Saint Devil City.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Wait till we exit the city. I will deal with all the Primal Ancestors that are following us, and the True Saints will be left to you all. Spare the life of the ones who surrender and kill the ones who don’t.”

Sensing the faint murderous aura seeping out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, Duan Feng and the rest couldn’t help pitying Chen Hong.

As the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s young lord, Chen Hong had mocked Huang Xiaolong as hillbilly every time he had opened his mouth, then how would willingly submit to Huang Xiaolong even if he got defeated. Therefore, there was only one end to Chen Hong.

Several hours later, the city gates were within their sight.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of four stopped in front of the Saint Devil City’s city gates.

Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly after detecting that the number of people following behind them had increased to several thousand. Other than those from Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, there were also experts from more than a dozen other sacred lands.

It looked like his slight show of hand in the auction hall had really attracted a lot of people.

“We’re going out of the city.”

A brief pause later, Huang Xiaolong gave the word. Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, and Chen Qi all walked through the city gates with him.

As expected, just as Huang Xiaolong’s group stepped out of the city’s boundary, blurry figures flickered and Huang Xiaolong’s group was completely encircled. This group belonged to Nine Revolutions Sacred Land.

Other sacred lands’ experts were hidden nearby, not planning to take any action for now.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s people, stopping at Chen Hong. The corners of his mouth were raised in a faint smile.

“Hillbilly, what are you smiling for?” Chen Hong’s face sank, seeing Huang Xiaolong smile instead of panicking as he should have been. “I initially wanted to let you live a while longer, but it’s a pity…”

“Now, get on your knees and beg, then pledge to submit to me. I can consider sparing your life…” Huang Xiaolong suddenly cut off Chen Hong’s words.

Chen Hong and all Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts were stupefied.

Then, Chen Hong erupted in laughter. “Hillbilly, you want me to kneel and beg you, so you’ll spare my life?”

“Correct,” Huang Xiaolong responded curtly.

Chen Hong glared icily at Huang Xiaolong, and a bright light suddenly expanded outwards from his body, as strands of grand dao laws soared to the sky as he raised his fists and punched at Huang Xiaolong, “Go to hell, hillbilly!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Thunder rumbled as Chen Hong punched out with full force. The sky darkened, with bolts of lightning crackling as if the end of the world had come.

This attack was Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s grand dao art, the Nine Revolutions Lightning!

Lightning energy emerged out of nowhere, forming a lightning vortex that was spinning at high speed. One turn, two turns, three turns, and with every turn, lightning’s terrifying destructive force doubled, and when it completed the ninth turn, the sky was overcast with endless lightning bolts.

As the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s young lord, his talent was naturally excellent. Even though Chen Hong was a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, he could fight many Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestors to a draw merely based on the Nine Revolutions Lightning grand dao art.

Chen Hong’s face became distorted.

Originally, he had wanted to force Huang Xiaolong to beg for his life, and he could have really spared him, using him as a hostage. Unfortunately, this hillbilly doesn’t know what’s good for him, how dare this hillbilly mock me... want me to kneel and beg?

Dong!

Lightning force swooped down and drowned Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t ruffled in the slightest. He didn’t even look at Chen Hong's attack, but instead, he waved his hand casually and the sky casted with lightning bolts and terrifying lightning force dissipated in the blink of an eye. Clear blue sky returned, and Chen Hong was sent tumbling back miserably, spitting a mouthful of blood.

“What?!” Not only the Ninth Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts were shocked, but those watching from their hiding places also couldn’t believe what they had just seen.

Chen Hong was jarred senseless.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the rest of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts and said, “Attack together, save me the time from having to deal with you all one by one.”

The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts blanked for a second. Attack together?

In order to deal with Huang Xiaolong’s group with no chance of failure, there were more than ten high-level Primal Ancestor experts amongst the people Chen Hong had summoned.

Now, this hillbilly is telling us to attack together?

Stunned by what Huang Xiaolong had said, none of the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts made any moves for a moment.

This punk is clearly a Ninth Heaven True Saint, yet he repelled our young lord with a wave of his hand.

What happened just now is too strange.

“Why are you lot standing there in a daze?” Chen Hong barked angrily as he looked at the hesitating group, “Attack him together. Kill that hillbilly, and then capture Cangqiong Old Man and those two, hurry up!”

Upon hearing that, the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts no longer hesitate, and launched a ferocious attack. In an instant, bolts of lightning once again blotted out the sky. Thick bolts of lightning roared like ferocious lightning dragons, exuding heart-palpitating destructive force that ripped the surrounding space. Even the Saint Devil City’s city walls were shaking under pressure.

The forty-plus experts of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, with more than ten high-level Primal Ancestors, twenty-plus mid-level Primal Ancestors, and the remaining all low-level Primal Ancestors, all attacked together. Their attacks multiplied into a world-shaking force, and it was no exaggeration to say that if their attacks landed, a sacred land with weaker defensive grand formation would collapse on the spot, killing all experts within, and that sacred land would cease to exist.

This attack was a thousand times stronger than Chen Hong’s attack!

Chen Hong did not participate in this attack, but he stood in the far distance, watching everything with a distorted face. He didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong’s group could take on the combined attack of so many Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts.

Duan Feng, Cangqiong Old Man, and Chen Qi stood behind Huang Xiaolong and didn't look like they were going to move at all. Huang Xiaolong had already said earlier that he would deal with all the Primal Ancestors.

Seeing the three older men standing behind Huang Xiaolong without any intention to move, Chen Hong felt something wasn’t right. Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong raised one hand and slapped forward. Space shattered under his palm, and those watching from the dark swore they could hear a low crisp noise of space breaking.

Countless lightning bolts, and the sky dominated by lightning dragons all dissipated with the shattered space, and the group of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts were swept into the air by the rebounding force. A few of them smashed into Chen Hong, knocking him into the air with the others.

Bang!

The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts crashed to the ground in various locations, and their blood scattered on the broken ground.

The experts hidden nearby had yet to recover from the fact that Huang Xiaolong had repelled Chen Hong, and all of them paled with shock watching the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts' failed attack.
