Chapter 3164: Returning to Cangqiong Holy World

With his Huang Long Bloodline, and because the Huang Long Heart was refined by his father, it wasn’t difficult for Huang Xiaolong to refine the Huang Long Heart.

It didn’t take Huang Xiaolong long to refine the Huang Long Heart. The Huang Long Heart gradually shrunk in size until it was the size of a human heart then shot into Huang Xiaolong’s chest towards his heart position. It slowly integrated into Huang Xiaolong’s heart flawlessly, becoming a natural part of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong successfully refine the Huang Long Heart, a complicated emotion flashed across Yuan Tianyi’s eyes. He had naturally hoped Huang Xiaolong would fail, but he also knew that it was not something he could stop.

Sensing the pulsing Huang Long Heart in his chest, sending vigorous energy through his body, joy swam through Huang Xiaolong’s veins.

As the Huang Long Heart’s energy would continuously temper his body, his grand dao physique would become increasingly stronger.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong, Cang Xun, Di Shuang, Lei Yu, and the rest returned to the surface from the Nether Grotto. The intense battle between Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong had not only turned the Nether Grotto’s ninth level into ruins, but the entire Nether Grotto and City of Nether had suffered damage to a certain extent. The streets were broken in various sections, and many of the buildings and shops had crumbled.

Many had already fled the city, and there was barely anyone left.

When they had come, the City of Nether was a prosperous, bustling city, and it was a stark contrast to the current atmosphere. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It seemed like all the cultivators in the City of Nether were frightened by the shockwaves from Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong’s battle, and they had fled the city. Then again, this was nothing strange as everyone was afraid of death.

“It is said that the City of Nether’s Nether Restaurant is the best restaurant in the Nine Spider Black Region. I originally wanted to have a taste, but it looks like that won’t happen today.” Huang Xiaolong jested with the others.

Although Main Mystical Pavilion Master Huang Rong fled, it was a fact that he had defeated Huang Rong, and also the Creation Set was complete, these two matters put Huang Xiaolong in a good mood.

Jin Xin grinned, “If Your Highness wants to taste the Nether Restaurant’s wine, I will send someone to contact the owner, and tell them to come back!”

The Nether Restaurant was the best restaurant in the Nine Spider Black Region, so one could imagine the force behind it. However, Jin Xin being the absolute sovereign of Golden Spider Black Region, the Nether Restaurant’s owner would have no choice but to comply to his order.

“If it’s too troublesome, then forget it,” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand.

Jin Xin smiled amiably, “Nothing troublesome about it.”

He then issued an order, and a reply soon came. Jin Xin read the message and reported to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, let’s go to the Nether Restaurant now, the owner will arrive within the hour, the timing is just right!”

“Alright,” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The group headed to the Nether Restaurant without another word.

Many things crossed Huang Xiaolong’s mind as he reflected on recent events. Although he had defeated Huang Rong this time, he also noted that he still wasn’t strong enough.

Among the talented juniors of Huang Rong’s Huang Family, Huang Rong was merely in the top ten. If Huang Rong was strong enough to enter the top five, top three, or even the first place, to what extent Huang Rong’s strength could have been? Not to mention, the strength of the Huang Family Patriarch Huang Rong belongs to.

Therefore, he needed to cultivate the thirteen elements to perfection level as soon as possible.

When he goes back this time, he planned to enter a long seclusion!

“Your Highness, we’re here,” an hour later, Jin Xin said as he pointed at a building not far ahead to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong put his thoughts away and looked where Jin Xin pointed to. It was a typical ancient architectural building, yet it was grand and luxurious. Right outside the restaurant’s main entrance stood a middle-aged man with bushy brows and a prominent face, and this person was none other than the restaurant’s owner.

Spotting Jin Xin arriving with Huang Xiaolong’s group, the owner hurried forward and knelt before them, “Liu Yue greets His Highness, Son of Creation, and Lord Jin Xin!”

Clearly, he had gotten prior instructions to serve Huang Xiaolong and Jin Xin.

Huang Xiaolong had the Nether Restaurant’s owner stand up, and under the owner’s respectful invitation, Huang Xiaolong, Jin Xin, Yuan Tianyi, and the rest walked into the restaurant.

The facade outside was ancient and solemn but when Huang Xiaolong’s group stepped inside, the interior was tastefully decorated, revealing the owner’s carefree personality, which enhanced the mood of enjoying wine in this atmosphere.

Although many of the buildings in the city were damaged due to the battle between Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong, not a brick of the Nether Restaurant was cracked, and one could imagine how strong the building’s defenses were.

There were no other customers in the restaurant, Huang Xiaolong’s group were the first customers for the day.

Huang Xiaolong chose a table near the window where he could see the view outside.

When everyone was seated down, Liu Yue personally brought the wine and several small dishes to them.

The scent of wine permeated the air when the cork was pulled off.

Since most of the people in the city were frightened away by the battle, Huang Xiaolong’s group had the entire place to themselves. Everyone let go and enjoyed to their hearts’ content, there was no danger of getting drunk no matter how much they drank. Even Yuan Tianyi couldn’t resist the lure of wine and joined the crowd.

Three days and three nights later, the small party ended. Huang Xiaolong’s group left the restaurant and left the City of Nether.

Huang Xiaolong stayed a few days at the Golden Spider Race Headquarters, then left the Golden Spider Black Region completely. The Destiny Race’s Li Tianyi chose to stay with the Golden Spider Race.

Back in the Origin Holy World Huang Xiaolong stayed for six months before he set off to return to the Divine Tuo Holy World. Naturally, the ten overlords, ten beast kings, Lei Yu, Black Shadow Devil, Myriad Formation Devil, and the others were with him.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong return, Cangqiong Old Man, Fen Yanzi, Feng Yue, and Yin Yue were overjoyed, and it was especially so for the three ladies, Fei Yanzi, Feng Yue, and Yin Yue.

“What, Xiaolong, you say you want to go back to Cangqiong Holy World?” When Cangqiong Old Man heard Huang Xiaolong say he was planning to go back to Cangqiong Holy World several days later, he was surprised and shocked.

Fei Yanzi too looked at Huang Xiaolong with wide eyes. When she had first followed Huang Xiaolong to Divine Tuo Holy World, she had never thought there would be an opportunity to return to Cangqiong Holy World, simply because it was too difficult.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded, “Yes, I plan to make a trip back, Master. Yanzi, what do you two think?”

Cangqiong Old Man hesitated only briefly, then nodded his head, “I’ve come to the Divine Tuo Holy World for many years, it would be nice to go back and see some old friends.”

Fei Yanzi nodded her head dazedly.

As for Feng Yue and Yin Yue, they expressed they wanted to follow Huang Xiaolong to Cangqiong Holy World.

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly. “Alright then, we’ll set off a few days later!”

He naturally had his own plans in returning to Cangqiong Holy World. Cangqiong Holy World was the place he had ascended to from the lower world, thus when the Huang Family, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others were to ascend, they would definitely arrive at Cangqiong Holy World. Therefore, he was going back to enter a long seclusion while waiting for his family to ascend.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong set off with his master, Cangqiong Old Man, the three ladies, ten overlords, ten beast kings Li Shuo, Black Shadow Devil, Lei Yu, and the others to Cangqiong Holy World.

To reach Cangqiong Holy World from the Divine Tuo Holy World, they needed to pass through several Denmon World’s regions. To others, it would be an arduous journey, but to Huang Xiaolong, it was no different than crossing flat plains.
