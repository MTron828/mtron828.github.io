Chapter 2871: Chen Dingtian’s Here!

Upon noticing Duan Zheng’s worried expression, Duan Feng chuckled and reassured, “Second Brother, not to mention Chen Dingtian, but even if all of the Ten Swords Creed’s Ten Swords are here, none of them can take a second punch from His Highness!”

“Therefore, you don’t need to worry at all.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Duan Zheng couldn’t hide his shock, hearing Duan Feng’s words.

Even if all of the Ten Swords Creed’s Ten Swords come, none of them can take a second punch from His Highness?!

Although Chen Dingtian was the Blood Sword’s chosen one at half-step Dao Venerable Realm, his strength wasn't the strongest among the ten swords’ chosen disciples. The leader of the ten swords, wielder of the Dragon Sword, Yong Luosheng, had already broken through to Dao Venerable Realm!

It was said that Yong Luosheng was a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable!

Furthermore, Yong Luosheng also had amazing combat prowess, and there were many rumors claiming he had defeated many early Second Esteem Dao Venerable experts.

According to his younger third brother, even if Yong Luosheng and Chen Dingtian combined their strengths, they wouldn't be able to survive one move from Huang Xiaolong?

“Third Brother, you’ve been away from the Divine Tuo Holy World for too long, so you aren’t clear about the Ten Swords Creed’s situation. The Ten Swords’ leader Yong Luosheng, has already entered the Dao Venerable Realm. Moreover, he’s a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable expert!” Duan Zheng couldn’t help explaining.

In Duan Zheng’s opinion, Duan Feng didn’t have a grasp of Ten Swords Creed disciples’ latest information that he dared to say so.

Duan Feng merely smiled silently at his brother’s words, and he said nothing to retort.

It was inconvenient for him to say too clearly on certain things.

No matter how he explained it to his second brother now, he wouldn’t believe him. After all, no one in their right mind would believe that an early Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor could defeat a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

He would leave his second brother to witness that scene with his own eyes.

The four of them headed straight to the Blue Lotus Pond, showing no reaction to the crowd.

The Blue Lotus Pond was only a stone’s throw distance from White Feather City. Hence Huang Xiaolong sent the Qilin Chariot back into the Immemorial Immortal Cave, and flew across the sky, speedily.

“Young Lady Yu Yue has entered the Blue Lotus Pond! She’s already looking to collect the blue lotus!”

“With Young Lady Yu Yue’s talent, she can definitely find a stalk of blue lotus, maybe even two!”

“Some are saying that the Dragon Fish Creed’s Yu Zhou has also entered the Blue Lotus Pond. With his talent, even though he might not find a blue lotus, he can be lucky enough to come across some blue lotus’ nectar!”

“The Blue Lotus Creed’s Yang Jia also entered the Blue Lotus Pond!”

“Don’t forget, there’s also the Tempest Lightning Creed’s Xu Xiaofeng!”

Along the way, conversations of various sacred lands’ disciples could be heard.

“Your Highness, I didn’t expect Yu Zhou to be here as well,” Long Jianfei couldn’t help speaking when he heard that the Yu Family’s Yu Zhou had come to the Blue Lotus Pond.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

He had not expected Yu Zhou to come here as well.

Surprisingly, there seemed to be quite a few creeds’ core disciples coming to the Blue Lotus Pond during this time frame, which said a lot about Yu Yue’s charm.

Yu Zhou was the Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall Master Zhu Hui’s personal disciple, whereas Yang Jia was the Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch Lin Rui’s personal disciple and the eldest disciple.

As for Xu Xiaofeng, Huang Xiaolong had heard of him. Xu Xiaofeng was the Tempest Lightning Creed’s sole Dao Venerable ancestor’s personal disciple, and he was the ancestor’s only personal disciple.

Then again, the list of various creeds and sacred lands’ genius disciples that came to the Blue Lotus Pond because of Yu Yue was more than these few names. Along the way, Huang Xiaolong’s group heard numerous conversations mentioning the names of sacred lands’, creeds’, or ancient families’ young patriarchs, entering the Blue Lotus Pond.

“The Ten Swords Creed’s Chen Dingtian will reach the Blue Lotus Pond tomorrow! I heard that his main purpose is to avenge his Junior Brother Zhou Hong. He wants to kill that young man personally!”

“Does that mean that young man is heading to the Blue Lotus Pond?”

“That seems to be the case. There are people who have seen him heading in the Blue Lotus Pond’s direction since leaving the White Feather City!”

……

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group finally arrived at the Blue Lotus Pond.

Standing on the edge of the Blue Lotus Pond, Huang Xiaolong looked into the horizon, yet he couldn’t see the other end of the pond.

Although there was a pond in the Blue Lotus Pond’s name, it was much bigger in reality. Its surface was bigger than any of the neighboring sacred lands.

Emerald ripples ran across the Blue Lotus Pond’s surface, and occasionally, wisps of silvery-golden vapors floated up.

This silvery golden vapor was spiritual energy unique to the Blue Lotus Pond, and people called it the blue lotus golden silver qi. A mortal taking a whiff of this qi could expel the impurities and strengthen his body, and even delay aging. Living past a hundred, or even two hundred years of age would be easily achievable.

By the time Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived, the Blue Lotus Pond’s area was crowded with disciples.

These disciples did not enter the Blue Lotus Pond because there was a water-attributed grand dao restriction around the pond, and not everyone could enter it.

Without a certain degree of comprehension in water-attributed energy, one couldn’t even take a step onto the Blue Lotus Pond’s outer region.

Therefore, the majority of disciples here were waiting to see Young Lady Yu Yue’s splendor.

These disciples were waiting eagerly to catch a glimpse of Yu Yue’s slender figure to appear before their eyes.

“The young man who defeated Zhou Hong is here!”

Suddenly a shout ruffled the crowd.

Just as Huang Xiaolong wanted to enter the Blue Lotus Pond, the shout rang, and it immediately drew everyone’s attention to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s reputation had grown loud ever since he had defeated Zhou Hong with one punch. He was, at least, famous in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and nearby heavenly caves.

“He has the guts to appear here? Doesn’t he know that the Ten Swords Creed’s Chen Dingtian is coming for him?!”

“Not only Chen Dingtian, the Dragon Fish Creed’s Yu Zhou also released a word that he’s going to make that kid die miserably! It really makes me wonder how did that kid offended Yu Zhou!”

“They say that a few years ago, he stripped Yu Zhou’s Junior Brother Wang Xin naked at the Blue Lotus Creed’s trading market, and forced Wang Xin to say he’s an idiot a hundred times!”

“What?! There’s someone who dares to offend the Dragon Fish Creed? That’s literally seeking death, ah!”

Not many people had heard about what had happened at the Blue Lotus Creed’s trading market. At least, it had made a much smaller splash than Zhou Hong’s defeat. Now, many people were shocked after learning what had happened..

Then again, everyone agreed that Huang Xiaolong was tired of living since he had dared to humiliate a Dragon Fish Creed’s disciple like that!

Even though Wang Xin was not one of the disciples the Dragon Fish Creed had focused on cultivating, he was still an inner disciple. Moreover, he was the Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall Master Zhu Hui’s named disciple, and Huang Xiaolong’s action was akin to slapping Zhu Hui’s face, along with taunting the Dragon Fish Creed!

Between heaven and earth, who dared to provoke the Dragon Fish Creed?

Even if someone dared to do it, that wouldn’t be a Primal Ancestor youngster like Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze swept over the people around him, and then, he passed through the Blue Lotus Pond’s barrier with Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng.

The moment Huang Xiaolong passed through, he immediately felt the dense water-attributed energy around him.

Before entering the Blue Lotus Pond, one had no idea how rich the water-attributed energy was, and the pressure it had on the body.

Then again, this degree of pressure was negligible for Huang xiaolong. Without using the power of his dao souls, he dissipated the water-attributed pressure around him, and strung the three behind him as he headed further in by merely relying on his physical body.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the Blue Lotus Pond, a startling streak of blood-colored light rushed over from the horizon. Blood-red light seemed to roll like clouds, alerting many experts.

“It’s the Ten Swords Creed’s Blood Sword Chen Dingtian, he’s here!”
