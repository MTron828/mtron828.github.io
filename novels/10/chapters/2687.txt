Chapter 2688: What a Lucky Fellow

“Mansion Master Yuan Qianxing?!” Huang Xiaolong was taken aback when he heard the news. His heart sank. Could it be?!

It seemed as though the worst-case scenario had happened.

Even though he had increased his speed while returning, he was still too slow.

“Didn’t you hear what I said?! The Mansion Master has ordered that all trespassers will be killed! We’ll exterminate your family and kill everyone related to you!” The expert snapped at Huang Xiaolong when he saw that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t turned back.

A snort left the lips of the Myriad Origin Race’s disciple. He was sure that he would be able to scare Huang Xiaolong away with what he said. However, he was met with a cold light that emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

As he saw the human reach out into the void, he felt a hand grabbing his neck. Unable to resist in the slightest, he was dragged before the human.

Huang Xiaolong stared the disciple in the eye and growled, “Exterminate my family and everyone related to me? Yuan Qianxing overestimates himself!”

The expert from the Myriad Origin Race started to panic when he realized that he was unable to move in the slightest. Before he could scream, Huang Xiaolong clenched his fist and turned the man into a mist of blood.

The disciples of the Myriad Origin Race were appalled when they realized what had happened to their fellow member.

This…

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother explaining himself as he made his way towards the heart of the Otherworldly Mansion with Long Jianfei.

“How dare you kill the members of my Myriad Origin Race? Die!”

“Trespasser, go to hell!”

“Those who dare to infringe on the Otherworldly Mansion shall die! Exterminate his family!”

“Everyone, attack and take him down!”

Another attendant from the Myriad Origin Race finally snapped back to reality as he screamed at those around him.

In an instant, the disciples standing around swarmed Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei.

A cold light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He was too lazy to move against them, but they were obviously seeking death!

“Kill them all!” Huang Xiaolong snapped.

Receiving the order, Long Jianfei moved. Space started to distort as a horrifying wave of energy swallowed the members of the Myriad Origin Race.

Unable to understand the reason they had stopped moving, their bodies soon disintegrated and scattered with the wind.

Now that there were no more annoying flies blocking their path, Huang Xiaolong proceeded towards their destination.

As Huang Xiaolong made his way towards them, a celebration was playing out in the main hall of the Otherworldly Mansion. Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, Chan Yuli, Yao Chengxin, Elder Ming, and several others were present.

Raising his cup to toast Elder Ming, Yuan Qianxing said, “Many thanks to Elder Ming! Congratulations on obtaining the Tree of Grand Dao and dao fruits! With the assistance of the tree, Elder Ming will definitely be able to enter the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm!”

The mysterious Elder Ming finally revealed a smile when he heard what Yuan Qianxing said. “I should congratulate you for obtaining the position as the Mansion Master!”

Even though Mo Zhi and Long Shengtian had utilized the Otherworldly Mansion’s grand formation in an attempt to hold the others back, they were outnumbered. Mo Zhi had fled with his tail tucked between his legs, and Long Shengtian was imprisoned with the other Primal Ancestor in charge of guarding the mansion!

Of course, Yuan Qianxing’s side had paid a huge price in order to complete their takeover. Other than Elder Ming, everyone had suffered some sort of injury during the grand battle.

Yuan Qianxing roared with laughter when he heard what Elder Ming said. “Hahaha! I was only able to ascend to my current position with Elder Ming’s help! Just let me know if you need anything from me in the future!”

He knew that without Elder Ming’s assistance, there was no way he could have become the Mansion Master.

Of course, that was before he entered the Primal Ancestor Realm. As soon as he were to break through, there would be no need for him to lower his head to anyone!

Elder Ming nodded his head in satisfaction. “Alright. This old man won’t hold back!” One of the reasons he had appeared to move against Mo Zhi was because of the Tree of Grand Dao, but the other reason was to use the resources of the Otherworldly Mansion to increase his strength.

The Primal Ancestors in the hall congratulated Yuan Qianxing and Elder Ming and the atmosphere became a little more lighthearted.

Soon after, Yuan Qianxing asked the most important question. “Elder Ming, how do you plan to deal with Long Shengtian?”

With a wave of his hand, a black pagoda appeared. A platform could be seen on the lowest level and that was where Long Shengtian was trapped along with the other Primal Ancestor of the Otherworldly Mansion.

His robes were torn and tattered, and there were traces of blood all over his body.

“Long Shengtian, who would have thought that someone like you would fall to such a level!” Yuan Qianxing roared with laughter.

However, a sunny smile could be seen on Long Shengtian’s face. “Yuan Qianxing, do you really think that you can remain as the Mansion Master, Lord Mo Zhi will return one day to slay you, you piece of sh*t!”

Yuan Qianxing’s expression fell once again. Indeed, he was afraid that Mo Zhi would return one day.

“Relax. Mo Zhi was struck by my curse, and he won’t be able to recover without several hundred years of rest,” Elder Ming explained.

Only then did Yuan Qianxing heave a sigh of relief.

With enough time, he wouldn’t be afraid of Mo Zhi!

Elder Ming turned to Long Shengtian and sneered, “I have a way to deal with them. I’ll refine their grand dao and turn them both into grand dao pills!”

Yuan Qianxing and the others were shocked beyond belief.

There is no one who has managed to refine a grand dao pill in all the lands. Not even experts in the World River have managed to do it! Is Elder Ming actually trying to…?

A trace of fear finally spouted in Yuan Qianxing’s heart. It seemed as though Elder Ming’s origins weren’t as simple as he had thought.

“After I suck out all the grand dao they have comprehended, I’ll be able to do something else with their dao hearts and dao souls!” Elder Ming revealed a sinister smile. “Even if Long Shengtian wishes to die, he won’t be able to! Hahaha! There’s no need to worry about him anymore!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Yuan Qianxing and those in the hall felt a cold breeze caressing their hearts when they heard what he said.

No matter how loudly Long Shengtian roared in rage, he failed to escape. The restrictions around the pagoda smashed him back into the ground.

“Even if Mo Zhi returns, he won’t be able to save you!” Elder Ming sneered, “Long Shengtian, I gave you a chance several days ago. Right now, you can slowly sink into despair. You will never be able to see the light of day!”

“Is that so?” A cold voice rang through the skies all of a sudden.

As soon as they heard this voice, the entire hall fell into silence.

Turning over to stare at the source of the voice, everyone wanted to see which reckless id*ot dared to challenge Elder Ming.

However, Yuan Qianxing, Chan Yuli, Yuan Wanfei, Yao Chengxin, and several others were different. They knew the owner of the voice, and their bodies started to tremble as they looked over.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

Chan Yuli practically jumped out of his seat when he saw Huang Xiaolong.

Those who hadn’t seen Huang Xiaolong felt their minds going blank. Didn’t Yuan Qianxing and the others force him into the Death Cave in the past?! Isn’t he supposed to be dead?!

When Long Shengtian saw the appearance of Huang Xiaolong, a radiant smile appeared on his face once again. “Hahaha! Huang Xiaolong, you little brat! I knew you didn’t die!”

Like he was seeing a ray of light at the end of the tunnel, Long Shengtian couldn’t hold back his laughter.

A trace of red flashed in Elder Ming’s eyes when he saw the kid. “Brat, you’re pretty lucky to still be alive.”

“Perfect. Your twelve high-grade Saint Fates can be the main ingredient of my grand dao pill. You won’t be able to leave today.”
