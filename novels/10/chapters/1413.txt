‘This person has got a big tone,’ Huang Xiaolong thought as he smiled and asked curiously, “And you are?”

That person chuckled meaningfully. “Telling you my identity might scare you to death... I am the Thousand Autumns Buddha Sect’s Sect Chief’s second disciple is my Elder Cousin Brother’s Third Uncle’s Grandfather!”

Elder Cousin Brother’s Third Uncle’s Grandfather!

Everyone was flabbergasted for a second, then erupted into a fit of laughter.

Even Huang Xiaolong laughed loudly, which was a very rare thing to see.

The little cow said while laughing, “Oooh, this cow is so~oo scared, your identity is really big.”

That person raised his chin smugly and said, “Of course, if anyone bullies you in the future, you can come to me.”

“Good, we’ll come to you for sure.” Huang Xiaolong said seriously.

Ten seconds later, Huang Xiaolong’s group laughed again as they watched that person hurry away.

“Do you want to go take a look?” The little cow asked, referring to the Fortune Gate’s Royal Buddha Branch’s core disciples recruitment process.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, as he didn’t have the slightest interest in seeing the recruitment process.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group was about to leave, a group of Fortune Gate’s disciples appeared in their line of sight. Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed slightly when he recognized one of the people from this group.

There was a tall young man chatting amiably with other disciples with a spring in his step. It had been a long time since Huang Xiaolong had seen him, and he was none other than Wang Wei!

As if sensing Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, Wang Wei raised his head and looked in Huang Xiaolong’s direction. In that instant, their gaze met with one another’s.

Wang Wei was clearly surprised when he recognized Huang Xiaolong, as he had not not expected to see Huang Xiaolong there.

A smile bloomed over Wang Wei’s face and he walked towards Huang Xiaolong, like he was pleasantly surprised running into a good old friend.

Other Fortune Gate’s disciples stopped and looked curiously, as they followed Wang Wei.

Wang Wei stopped in front of Huang Xiaolong with a big sunny smile, and said, “Junior Brother Huang, long time no see ah. I really didn’t expect to run into you here. Didn’t you go off to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield? Were you able to find Junior Sister Li Lu?”

Found Junior Sister Li Lu?

Wang Wei still doesn’t know the latest news about Li Lu?

It was likely so. In these years, Wang Wei had not been back to the Vientiane World, thus, it wasn’t strange that he didn’t know about what had happened at the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, much less heard that Huang Xiaolong had subjugated the sea tribe and Ten Thousand Elephant Clan.

“I also hadn’t expected to encounter Senior Brother Wang here, and we’ve already found Li Lu.” Huang Xiaolong answered with a smile. “I’ve heard that Senior Brother Wang left the Vientiane World not long after I went to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield; it seems like Senior Brother Wang came to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.”

“Junior Brother Wang Wei, this is?” A Fortune Gate’s disciple with a big round face came swaggering over condescendingly, and asked Wang Wei with a finger pointing at Huang Xiaolong.

Wang Wei answered, “Senior Brother Liang Ming, this is our Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate Branch’s younger generation’s most talented genius disciple, Junior Brother Huang Xiaolong. You may not know that when Junior Brother Huang entered our Vientiane’s Fortune Gate Branch less than forty years ago, he was merely a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm. But if I have to make a guess, currently, he is already a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm?”

According to Wang Wei’s estimation of Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, he had guessed Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation to have probably reached the peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

Liang Ming and the rest of the Fortune Gate’s disciples looked at Huang Xiaolong, and were a little bit surprised.

“What? Less than forty years?! You’re saying that this kid broke through to peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm from peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm in less than forty years?!” Liang Ming exclaimed in disbelief as he scrutinized Huang Xiaolong from head to toe.

This degree of talent was monstrous. There were numerous genius disciples in their Royal Buddha’s Fortune Gate Branch, and many of them were emperor rank godhead geniuses, but if what Wang Wei had said was true, even their Royal Buddha Fortune Gate’s branch did not have such a genius, not even their chief disciple Senior Brother was at this level.

“It’s probably peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.” Wang Wei went on, “At the time when I left Vientiane World, he had already broken through to peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. More than twenty years have passed since then, therefore it’s likely that he has broken through to the peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.”

In truth, Wang Wei wasn’t very sure if Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had indeed reached the peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm like he had guessed, then again, estimating based on Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, at the very least, he would have broken through to the late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.

However, one of the Fortune Gate’s late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm disciples refused to believe Wang Wei’s words that Huang Xiaolong was already a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. Therefore, he swung his fist at Huang Xiaolong while shouting, “Brat, take my Invincible Fist!”

Wang Wei and Liang Ming did not try to stop him. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Especially, Wang Wei had no such intention; he focused fully on Huang Xiaolong as he really wanted to know the level of Huang Xiaolong’s current strength.

Just as that Fortune Gate’s disciple’s Invincible Fist was a split second from hitting Huang Xiaolong’s face, Huang Xiaolong’s raised his hand and slightly enclosed his palm over the disciple’s fist, and completely halted the disciple’s action.

The Fortune Gate’s group was dumbstruck.

That Fortune Gate’s disciple’s face turned beet red. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t free his fist from Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

“You, smelly brat, let go!” Failing to free his fist after several attempts, the disciple roared furiously at Huang Xiaolong. At the same time, he struck out with his other palm at Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Obviously, he was trying to cover his embarrassment with anger, and was intending to kill Huang Xiaolong.

But before he could do anything, Huang Xiaolong pinned his left palm in the air. Huang Xiaolong exerted a little bit of force from his left hand’s fingers, and in the next second, the disciple screeched in pain.

His companions were extremely enraged by this.

“You motherf*cker, release Junior Brother Chen immediately!”

An enraged disciple swung his fist at Huang Xiaolong; he was a First Order Ancestor God Realm. Robust fist force shook the space with a resounding boom.

Seeing that his fist was about to land on Huang Xiaolong’s chest, Gui Yi slapped his palm across that disciple’s face, sending him tumbling in the air. The disciple’s wail was cut short as he crashed to the street and stopped moving altogether.

Wang Wei and Liang Ming were astounded at this result and their gazes were locked onto Gui Yi.

Soon, the rest of the Fortune Gate’s disciples reacted, and swiftly spread out to encircle Huang Xiaolong’s group. The biggest threat was Gui Yi.

Liang Ming said to Wang Wei, “Junior Brother Wang Wei, how do you want to deal with this matter? Since this punk is a brethren of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, I’ll give you some face and let you deal with this matter.” His tone was filled with hostility.

Wang Wei had a troubled expression on his face as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Junior Brother Huang, you’re too impulsive. Junior Brother Chen was merely testing your strength right now, and it was nothing more than a friendly sparring. How could you injure him? Also, this subordinate of yours is too brazen, how could he injure Junior Brother Lin so heavily? How about this? You apologize to Junior Brother Chen, Senior Brother Liang Ming, and Senior Brother Lin; beg Senior Brother Liang Ming and the others to forgive you; as for your subordinate, just leave him to be dealt with by Senior Brother Liang Ming.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly as he watched Wang Wei’s performance.

“What? Just beg for forgiveness? That’s not enough—I want this punk on his knees and kowtow a thousand times, then kneel here for one day and one night!”

“That’s right, and kill his subordinate. What’s there to talk about? Just a slave, how dare he injure our Junior Brother Lin!”

The Fortune Gate’s disciples clamored loudly.
