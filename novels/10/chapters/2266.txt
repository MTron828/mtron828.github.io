Chapter 2267: The Reason Li Wen Protects Huang Xiaolong

A baffling question emerged in Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, and the others’ minds when they noticed Eminent Elder Li Wen’s excited expression.

Even if Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique ranked higher than Huang Zhouping’s, Li Wen didn’t need to look so overly excited...?

Li Wen managed to suppress his bubbling excitement moments later, and he summoned Yang Jingzhi. Li Wen asked in a slightly urgent voice, “During the second test, are you certain that Huang Xiaolong’s results showed the Mysterious Dragon Saint Godhead, Mad Dragon Saint Bloodline, and the True Dragon Physique?!”

Although Yang Jingzhi was doubtful why Li Wen seemed to be trembling with excitement, he still answered honestly, “Replying to Eminent Elder Li Wen. Subordinate swears that during the second test, His Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong’s results were indeed the Mysterious Dragon Saint Godhead, Mad Dragon Saint Bloodline, and the True Dragon Physique!”

Upon hearing that, Guo Qirong frowned and hinted, “Could there be an error with the testing array?”

It did not occur to them that there would be other possibilities at all. Their minds were simply dead-set that there might be a problem with the testing array. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Xu Jun, Gong Chen, Bai Xuyang, Chen Shiming, and the rest had the same thought as Guo Qirong. They were keener to think something had gone wrong with the testing array or other things rather than thinking that Huang Xiaolong was different.

But after verifying the details with Yang Jingzhi, the excitement that Li Wen had suppressed moments ago rose again like tidal waves, soaring upwards from the bottom of his heart. The trembling of his body was even more pronounced, and his hands were gesticulating madly in the air.

“It’s, it’s...!” Li Wen repeated in an intelligible manner.

Other Eminent Elders continued to watch Li Wen’s overly excited condition with baffled expressions, then exchanged glances among themselves for clues.

Suddenly, a loud scream from the stage pulled their attention back to the present. When they looked over, Huang Zhouping, who had resorted to attacking with his holy martial art, once again smashed into the light barrier from Huang Xiaolong’s punch before falling limply to the stage floor with a plop on the stage like a dead dog.

The spectators watched stiffly with their eyes wide in disbelief.

No one had expected Huang Xiaolong to send Huang Zhouping flying with an ordinary punch after Huang Zhouping had used his holy martial art to attack him. On top of that, Huang Zhouping’s injuries seemed more severe this time.

Right before the dumbfounded gazes from the crowd, Huang Xiaolong approached Huang Zhouping, who was lying on the stage floor and then heavily stomped on Huang Zhouping’s face with his foot.

Thud!

The disciples in the crowd felt the nerves on their faces jump with the impact.

Everyone saw Huang Xiaolong’s foot squash Huang Zhouping’s face to the floor. His nose and mouth were kissing the stage floor intimately. His eyes were squished into lines, and blood flowed out his mouth. Huang Xiaolong’s face was too distorted to the point of being unrecognizable.

Watching Huang Xiaolong abuse and humiliate Huang Zhouping to this extent, the Holy Alliance’s members boiled with rage, and their eyes were spitting fire.

The Holy Prince Zheng Yongjia, who had once mocked Huang Xiaolong, claiming that he was only qualified to carry Jiang Tian’s shoes, jumped up and cursed in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, you filthy rubbish. How dare you injure Junior Brother Huang Zhouping! Wait till you get off the stage. I won’t spare you!”

Bai Xuyang, Chen Shiming, and other Eminent Elders frowned while listening to Zheng Yongjia threaten Huang Xiaolong in public. Still, none of them said anything. However, when Li Wen heard that, he jumped to his feet in anger and pointed at Zheng Yongjia as he rebuked sharply, “Insolent! Zheng Yongjia, you b*stard, who the f*ck do you think you are!”

Li Wen’s words rendered all the disciples agape in shock. More than a few turned to look at Li Wen with a stupefied expression.

Even Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, and the rest of the Eminent Elders were dumbfounded by Li Wen’s reaction.

Did Li Wen call Zheng Yongjia by his full name?

And scold Zheng Yongjia by calling him a b*stard!

... This!

Zheng Yongjia, Jiang Tian, and members of the Holy Alliance couldn’t believe what they heard.

Amongst the Holy Alliance’s Holy Princes, Jiang Tian was the most talented, and Zheng Yongjia came in second. Zheng Yongjia’s complete dao saint godhead ranked in the top three hundred. Li Wen had always been amiable and gentle towards Zheng Yongjia, full of doting and concern, but today, Li Wen actually scolded Zheng Yongjia by calling him a b*stard in public!

That too because Zheng Yongjia threatened Huang Xiaolong just now?!

Or was it because Zheng Yongjia scolded Huang Xiaolong as filthy rubbish?

“Eminent Elder Li Wen, you, this...?” Zheng Yongjia didn’t know how to react. He doubted even whether Li Wen had accidentally said the wrong thing, or scolded the wrong person?

“Zheng Yongjia, you insulted His Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong in public. After the stage battle ends, you have to apologize to His Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong!” Li Wen stated with a cold face, and the usual amiable smile when facing Zheng Yongjia was nowhere to be seen.

Zheng Yongjia bellowed in anger after hearing that Li Wen wanted him to apologize to Huang Xiaolong, “What? You want me to apologize to that rubbish?! Impossible!”

Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, and those supporting the Holy Alliance frowned, feeling that Li Wen had exaggerated the matter. Zheng Yongjia had merely scolded Huang Xiaolong with a few words. That was all, but Li Wen actually wanted Zheng Yongjia to apologize to Huang Xiaolong!

Another miserable scream came from the stage and broke the atmosphere outside. At this time, on the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong had added another hard stomp on Huang Zhouping’s face, flattening Huang Zhouping’s face to the stage floor in the literal sense.

Huang Xiaolong glanced coldly at Zheng Yongjia from the corner of his eye, while repeating in a mocking tone, “ I shouldn’t dare to harm Huang Zhouping?! So what if I do? This is just the beginning!” As he spoke, a suction force from his palm pulled Huang Zhouping up by the head, while his other hand clenched into a fist and hit Huang Zhouping in the chest, directly penetrating Huang Zhouping’s heart.

Huang Zhouping’s screams reverberated in the air, reaching the mountain peaks surrounding the holy arena.

Zheng Yongjia’s killing intent soared seeing Huang Xiaolong disregarding his words, and mocked him in return. On top of that, Eminent Elder Li Wen’s rebuke from earlier, demanding him to apologize to a waste like Huang Xiaolong was infuriating.

Not only Zheng Yongjia, but even Jiang Tian and other Holy Alliance’s Holy Princes had murder written all over their faces.

Huang Xiaolong’s second punch landed, shattering Huang Zhouping’s internal organs to pieces.

Another miserable scream escaped Huang Zhouping’s lips.

Xu Jun frowned with displeasure at Huang Xiaolong’s actions and spoke sternly, “This Huang Xiaolong, is he trying to kill a Holy Prince so blatantly?! If we do not punish him accordingly, won’t the Holy Gate’s rules be reduced to mere decorations?”

Guo Qirong promptly supported, “That’s right! Even if this is a holy arena battle, Huang Xiaolong cannot be allowed to do as he pleases!”

Yang Jingzhi was boiling with rage when he heard that. It was so obvious this Xu Jun and Guo Qirong were biased towards the Holy Alliance and Huang Zhouping. This life and death battle in the arena was initiated by Huang Zhouping himself, and the conditions were agreed by both sides.

Not to mention, according to the holy arena’s rules, Huang Xiaolong could kill Huang Zhouping on the stage without any repercussions.

Yet Xu Jun and Guo Qirong actually said it out loud that Huang Xiaolong should be sanctioned?

While Yang Jingzhi was suppressing his anger, Li Wen snapped at Xu Jun and Guo Qirong, “Are the two of you qualified to speak about the Holy Gate’s rules? According to the Holy Gate’s rules, since Huang Zhouping willingly signed a life and death agreement with Huang Xiaolong prior to the battle, he deserves it even if Huang Xiaolong kills him on the stage! This is the rule our Holy Gate’s Patriarch has set. Xu Jun, Guo Qirong, do the two of you want to revise the Holy Gate’s rules? Who gave you two the right to do so?”

Being doubted by Li Wen whether they were qualified to talk about Holy Gate’s rules, not only Xu Jun and Guo Qirong were stunned, but others were also stupefied by Li Wen’s strong reaction.

Although Li Wen was the head of the thirteen Eminent Elders, he had never spoken to anyone in such a stern tone. Yet he chided Xu Jun and Guo Qirong in public because of Huang Xiaolong!

At this point, anyone could see there was something going on.

Li Wen scolded Zheng Yongjia and called him a b*stard to defend Huang Xiaolong!

He also scolded Eminent Elder Xu Jun and Guo Qirong in public for Huang Xiaolong’s sake!

In all honesty, even though everyone had realized that Huang Xiaolong possessed better talents than Huang Zhouping at this point, it wasn’t a reason enough for Li Wen to be so protective of him, right?

Suddenly, Yang Jingzhi recalled Li Wen’s question regarding Huang Xiaolong’s second test as to whether the results really were Mysterious Dragon Saint Godhead, Mad Dragon Saint Bloodline, and True Dragon Saint Physique?!

Li Wen’s excited expression flashed before Yang Jingzhi’s eyes, and his mind went boom as a thought struck him!

A violent shudder ran down his spine. That’s it, that must be it. There was no other possibility!

Yang Jingzhi was trembling all over with excitement. Only that reason would make Li Wen be this protective of Huang Xiaolong!
