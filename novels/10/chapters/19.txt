Chapter 20: Li Mu’s Celebration

“As long as I break through to Third Order by the end of the year?” A weird appeared expression on Huang Xiaolong face as he listened to his father.

When Huang Peng noticed Huang Xiaolong’s expression, he thought it was due to his unreasonable requirement – Third Order being too high, continued gently: “Honestly, Dad and Mom understand that it’s difficult to reach the Third Order by the end of the year, so Xiaolong, don’t put too much pressure on yourself.” Huang Peng hesitated for a moment, then said: “As long as you can advance to peak late-Second Order by the end of the year, then it’s okay!”

“Peak late-Second Order?” Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned even weirder.

“That’s right, Xiaolong. Even if you can’t breakthrough to peak late-Second Order, but reach late-Second Order, we will still be very happy.” This time, it was his Mom Su Yan who spoke.

Words failed Huang Xiaolong as he smiled helplessly inside his heart.

Third Order? Peak late-Second Order? Late-Second Order?

“Dad, Mom, I’m going back to the small yard.” Huang Xiaolong said as he stood up, gently hitting the arm of the chair; wondering whether his parents would further lower their requirement to peak mid-Second Order.

If it came to that, he might not be able to resist and expose his current strength of peak early-Fourth Order!

“Ah, Xiaolong.” When Huang Xiaolong was about the leave the hall, Huang Peng thought of something, said: “A few days from now is Old Patriarch Li’s eightieth birthday celebration; and he invited our Huang Clan Manor to the celebration party. That little girl kept badgering him to invite you, insisting that you must be there.”

“She insists that I go?” Huang Xiaolong felt amazement. That little girl didn’t really fancy him, right? Just because he looked really cool when he beat up Huang Wei miserably during the annual Clan’s Assembly?

“Dad, Mom, can I not go?” Huang Xiaolong asked weakly.

“What did you say?” Su Yan’s eyes glared at him.

Huang Xiaolong was depressed; looks like he can’t avoid going to the banquet.

Su Yan laughed seeing her son’s sulky face, teasing him: “You brat, don’t grumble. Li Lu is the apple of Old Patriarch Li’s eyes, possessing a grade nine martial spirit and she’ll surely grow up to be a beautiful young lady.”

Huang Xiaolong was even more speechless, what’s with this and that; if his Mom knew her son had superb talent and a twin martial superb talent at that, she probably wouldn’t think this way.

At this moment, Huang Peng also joined in: “Your Mom’s right. In the future, if you marry Old Patriarch Li granddaughter, Li Lu, then your Mom and I...”

While his father was still talking, Huang Xiaolong quickly cut in: “Okay, Dad, I understand; it’s fine as long as I go right? When do we leave? Are you going?”

Su Yan couldn’t help but laugh when she heard Huang Xiaolong’s response: “It seems like our son’s feeling shy.” She stopped teasing Huang Xiaolong and said: “We leave the day after tomorrow, but other than you and your Dad, your Grandfather, Eldest Uncle and that Huang Wei are also going.”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows wrinkled, and nodded: “Okay, I know; if there’s nothing else then I’ll go back.”

Both Huang Peng and Su Yan nodded.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and left.

Watching his son’s back, Su Yan sighed and said: “How wonderful it would be if our Xiaolong marries Li Lu!”

Huang Peng shook his head: “With Li Lu’s background and talent, she won’t like our Xiaolong. Also, right now Li Lu is only an eight-year-old child; so while she may not consider it, she will when she grows up.”

By this time Huang Xiaolong had returned to his small courtyard and started practicing the Tempest of Hell so he didn’t hear what his parents said after he left

Two days came and went quickly, and the day of departure arrived. The moment Huang Xiaolong arrived at Eastern Courtyard, he was dragged by Huang Peng to the Main Hall; and by the time they got to the Main Hall, his Grandfather Huang Qide, Eldest Uncle Huang Ming, and Huang Wei were already waiting.

When Huang Wei saw Huang Xiaolong stepping into the Main Hall, his eyes were full of hatred; if not for Huang Qide’s presence, he probably would have pounced on Huang Xiaolong.

“Grandfather.”

Huang Xiaolong and Huang Peng walked up to Huang Qide and said their greeting, ignoring Huang Wei’s imitation of a ferocious beast.

Huang Qide nodded and laughed: “Since everyone’s here, let’s go.” Huang Qide stepped out, and the four people followed after him.

Even though the Huang Clan Manor and the Li Family were known as two of the major powers in Canglan County, there was quite a distance between them.

The Li Family Residence is in Canglan’s County City whereby the Huang Clan Manor was situated a hundred miles outside of theCounty City.

Therefore, it was evening when Huang Xiaolong’s group of five arrived in County City, nearing dusk.

“Brother Qide! You traveled quite a distance to come for my celebration, yet I’m slow in my welcome, please forgive me!” said Old Patriarch Li while laughing merrily when the five of them arrived at County City.

“Brother Li Mu is too polite!” Huang Qide laughed robustly.

Huang Xiaolong looked around and noticed that the little girl Li Lu was standing behind a roundish faced middle-aged man who was a little chubby with slightly small eyes – which gave the impression that he was always beaming.

Is this Old Patriarch Li’s only son, Li Chen, Li Lu’s father? Huang Xiaolong wondered.

At this moment, the little girl who was hiding behind Li Cheng looked mischievously at Huang Xiaolong, stuck her tongue out at Xiaolong and giggled; looking very cute.

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes, totally ignoring her.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant reaction, Li Lu pouted her lips in pique.

This scene was seen by Huang Wei who was standing at the side; hatred surged violently in his heart. Although his engagement with Li Lu during the Clan Assembly was ruined by Huang Xiaolong, in his heart Li Lu was already his wife, and now his ‘wife’ was blatantly flirting with Huang Xiaolong right in front of him!

After the customary greetings, everyone entered the city, heading towards Li Residence.

Contrary to expectations, the Li Residence was not located in the center of the city but in the south section. When they arrived before the Li Residence’s main entrance, the twenty meters wide street in front was filled with an endless stream of horses and carriages, the street was lively and decorated with bright and colorful lanterns. For Li Mu’s eightieth birthday celebration, other than Huang Clan Manor, most of the forces in Canglan County had already arrived.

However, the real celebration would happen tomorrow, thus there were those who were yet to arrive and who were on their way.

When they arrived at the Li Residence, Li Mu personally lead them to the prearranged courtyard to rest.

“Brother Qide, if there’s anything you need, just inform the Residence’s guards. Please forgive the poor hospitality.” Li Mu said to Huang Qide with a smile.

Huang Qide waved his hand and said: “You’re too polite. En, please go and attend to your matters; tomorrow, we brothers will drink together later.”

Li Mu laughed ‘hehe’: “Definitely.” Then turned around and left.

But what happened next stunned Huang Xiaolong. Not long after Li Mu left, Li Lu came to their courtyard! After greeting Huang Qide, Huang Ming, and Huang Peng, she went straight to Huang Xiaolong and said in a petulant voice: “Xiaolong, This is your first time in County City right? Come, I’ll give you a tour!” Her hand was already pulling Huang Xiaolong away from the courtyard even before he had the chance to reply.

Huang Wei stared pointedly at Li Lu holding Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and watched both of them leave the courtyard; his expression was ugly to the extreme. And of course, Huang Ming’s face wasn’t looking any better either.

Huang Qide opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say; Huang Peng stood there quietly, but his heart was flipping in delight.
