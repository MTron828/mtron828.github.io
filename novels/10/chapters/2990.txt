Chapter 2991: I’m Going to Kill You!

“You’re just disciples of the Heavenly Phoenix Race. So what if I kill you?” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Even if the patriarch of your Heavenly Phoenix Race comes today, I’ll kill him all the same!”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, including the disciples of the Coiled Dragon Race.

Ao Dong stared at Huang Xiaolong with a weird expression on his face. It seemed as though the brat had some screw loose in his head.

Who in the world had the guts to say that they had the ability to slay the patriarch of the Heavenly Phoenix Race?! Was there even someone at that level of strength?

Even the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor wouldn’t dare to say so. After all, the Heavenly Phoenix Patriarch was the third-ranked expert in the Divine Tuo Holy World!

The experts of the Heavenly Phoenix Race were even more enraged when they heard how Huang Xiaolong insulted their leader. Feng Xue’s expression turned a notch colder, and the fire in her eyes burned like never before. She roared with laughter in a fit of rage, “The audacity! I’ll exterminate your soul right here and now!” Scarlet flames appeared around her body as rays of crimson light illuminated the kingdoms around the Soaring Dragon Mountain Range.

When the experts living in the kingdoms around the mountain range felt the sudden surge of energy, they turned to look at the Soaring Dragon Mountain Range with an expression of fear.

“This… This is the power of a half-step Dao Venerable!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“No! That’s definitely a Dao Venerable! No one other than Dao Venerables will be able to possess such strength! A Dao Venerable actually paid a visit to the Six Vision Sacred Land! I wonder which expert came here…”

As the faces of the emperors of the kingdoms changed, they started throwing out guesses one after another.

However, the cry of a phoenix tore through the sacred land, and even Chen Qiaoer, who was situated in the Apsara Dragon Country, managed to hear the heaven-shaking cry.

“That’s a phoenix! It’s a Dao Venerable from the Heavenly Phoenix Race! Only members with their bloodline can draw out the power of a true phoenix! Hearing the phoenix cry, it has to be a Second or Third Esteem Dao Venerable!”

As the experts around the Soaring Dragon Mountain Range stared at Feng Xue whose body was emitting terrifying flames, the experts in the formations on the Soaring Dragon Terrace had already started to make their escape. Even the late-Second Esteem Dao Venerable Realm Ao Dong, had run quite a distance away.

He looked at Feng Xue in shock. He knew that she was strong, and she was one of the most talented disciples in the younger generation of the Heavenly Phoenix Race, but he didn’t know how deep her foundations went! Feng Xue rarely made a move against others, and it had been a long time since she had last exposed her strength.

It seemed as though she had already reached the Third Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, and she might even have reached the peak of the late-Third Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

She shouldn’t be too far away from reaching the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm…

Staring at Huang Xiaolong coldly, Ao Dong was more than happy to watch such an arrogant brat get destroyed! When that happened, the hundred billion holy bills he had handed over would fall into the hands of the Coiled Dragon Race!

As for the power behind the brat sitting in the first formation, he didn’t give half a sh*t. After all, the Heavenly Phoenix Race was the one who made the move!

Feng Xue’s power finally reached her peak, and a massive phoenix appeared behind her. There were seven tails swaying in the wind, and it looked extremely imposing!

The Heavenly Phoenix Patriarch could summon a nine-tailed phoenix, and among the disciples, those who managed to summon one with seven tails could probably be counted on one hand! Everyone who could was a disciple the race placed heavy emphasis on as they possessed frightening talent!

From far, Feng Xue seemed to turn into a phoenix whose flames could incinerate the world around her!

“Heavenly Phoenix Flame!”

A cold sneer left her lips, and flames flickering purple swarmed towards Huang Xiaolong. Under the might of the Heavenly Phoenix Flame, everyone felt as though they were about to be burned into a crisp from the residual heat!

In fact, the Heavenly Phoenix Flame was one of the strongest fires under heaven! There were only several types of flames that could suppress the Heavenly Phoenix Flame!

Seeing as the flames were about to swallow Huang Xiaolong, a ray of light emerged from his body. A trace of mysterious qi appeared, and it dispersed the roaring flames filling the skies. As the flames turned into fiery balls of death and shot outwards, several unlucky sacred lands and disciples turned to ash. Those remaining felt the blood draining from their face before running even further away.

By the time the flames dissipated, Feng Xue was sent flying as she slammed through mountain peaks after mountain peaks. She was thrown out of the entire Soaring Dragon Mountain Range, and when she landed in one of the kingdoms, it shattered into a million pieces. A deep abyss formed in its place.

“What?!”

Ao Dong and the others couldn’t hide their shock, and the disciples of the Heavenly Phoenix Race couldn’t believe their eyes.

This…

Ao Dong turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong, and his expression changed drastically. How could one of the most talented disciples of the Heavenly Phoenix Race be sent flying with a single attack?!

More importantly, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even made his move. He had released a tiny stream of energy from his body, and destroyed Feng Xue! Moreover, it seemed like…

The disciples of the two countries that mocked Huang Xiaolong earlier felt their intestines churning, and their faces alternated between green and white. Their legs turned soft, and they nearly fell to the ground in fear.

The Golden Light Dragon Country and Black Mountain Dragon Country were the strongest kingdoms under the Six Vision Sacred Land, but their emperors were only high-level Primal Ancestors at best!

When all of them stared on in fear, Feng Xue broke through the rubble. Flames surrounded her body once again, and a pillar of fire pierced through the heavens. Heavenly Phoenix Flame filled the skies and swept through the regions surrounding it.

Another armor formed around her body, and she raised her spear to point at Huang Xiaolong. She glared at him and killing intent shot out from her eyes.

“I’m going to kill you!” A chilly voice pierced through the air and she turned into a scarlet phoenix that charged at Huang Xiaolong. The spear in her hand shot towards his chest, and in the instant she pressed forward, a hole was torn through space. The scarlet spear appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye.

The spear light and fearsome Heavenly Phoenix Flame surrounded Huang Xiaolong instantly.

His figure disappeared under the flames, and the expression of those from the Heavenly Phoenix Race finally relaxed.

As a look of joy slowly started to spread across their faces, a hand tore through the flames. The moment it appeared, the world seemed to come to a standstill. Everything fell under Huang Xiaolong’s control, and he turned into the ruler of the world.

Boom!

Pressing downwards, Huang Xiaolong’s palm crushed Feng Xue, and she was sent to the depths of the Soaring Dragon Mountain Range. As the peaks shattered one after another, the entire region crumbled. The only thing left standing was the Soaring Dragon Terrace.

By the time Ao Dong and the others reacted, Feng Xue was turned into a steaming meat patty crushed god knew how deep into the ground.
