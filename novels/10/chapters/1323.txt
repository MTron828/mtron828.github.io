One of the disciples of the Sand Waves Sect was furious and afraid.

“You, bastard, who are you?!” The other Sand Waves Sect’s disciple demanded.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the two disciples, and his soul force penetrated into one of the disciple’s soul in an instant, scouring through his memories.

"Stop!" The other Sand Waves Sect’s disciple drew out his sword and thrusted it at Huang Xiaolong. This disciple was a little stronger, as he was a late-Ninth Ancient God Realm. But before he could even come close, Huang Xiaolong flicked his fingers, and a powerful finger force sent the disciple’s sword tumbling out of sight, while the disciple crashed to the ground like a meteor.

Huang Xiaolong continued to scour the memories of Sand Waves Sect’s disciple without any further interruptions.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong was done.

The result surprised him. From the memories of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciple, he learned the woman captured by the Sand Waves Sect’s Young Lord was called Wang Luo!

Whether it was the woman’s face or name, it definitely differed from Li Lu’s.

It wasn’t Li Lu who was captured!

Huang Xiaolong was relieved, but at the same time, his worry deepened.

If it wasn’t Li Lu, then where was Li Lu? If it was Li Lu, at least he would have had clues about her whereabouts. Now, he didn’t even know if Li Lu was alive or...

By this time, the little cow, Feng Er, and the others had caught up with Huang Xiaolong.

“Master, heavens would surely bless Miss Li Lu, she would be safe. You shouldn’t worry too much, and we will continue to search for her. I am sure we will find her.” The little cow anxiously comforted Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, as they could only continue searching.

Huang Xiaolong was about to let go of the two Sand Waves Sect’s disciples in order to leave, when sounds of whistling winds came from afar. Seconds later, a group of people appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s line of sight. There were about thirty people in the group. These people were wearing the same patterned robe as the two Sand Waves Sect’s disciples. Without asking, this group of people were also disciples of Sand Waves Sect. The person at the front was a young man with below average looks.

With an overall evaluation, the young man could be described as ugly, as his mouth and nose were a little crooked.

“Young Lord!” The two Sand Waves Sect’s disciples cried out seeing their comrades, grasping at a ray of hope.

The group of Sand Waves Sect’s disciples accelerated towards the Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“What’s going on here?!” The Sand Waves Sect’s Young Lord questioned heavily. His face sank as he looked at the two disciples’ injuries. His gaze then swept over Huang Xiaolong and the rest of his group.

The disciples from his group had already spread out to encircle Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“Young Lord, this punk knows about Wang Luo! He attacked us the moment he appeared, and forcefully asked about Wang Luo’s whereabouts.” one of the two Sand Waves Sect’s disciples hastened to explain.

Clearly, he had mistakenly thought that Huang Xiaolong had come to rescue the woman called Wang Luo.

Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed slightly with displeasure, but he didn’t bother to explain. A female disciple was standing behind the Sand Waves Sect’s Young Lord. Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on her pale red dress. He knew from the Sand Waves Sect disciple’s memories that this woman was Wang Luo.

The Sand Waves Sect’s Young Lord Liang Mingzhi looked coldly at Huang Xiaolong after hearing the disciple’s words, "Punk, since you want to be a hero who rescues the damsel, I shall fulfill your wish!" With that said, he strode towards Huang Xiaolong.

Wang Luo looked at Huang Xiaolong in confusion. She searched through her memories but couldn’t put a name to this black-haired young man.

‘Did her father send this black-haired young man to look for her...?’

Liang Mingzhi stopped three meters away from Huang Xiaolong, and said in a frosty voice, “If you can take one strike from me, I will let you leave.” A feverish light flickered across his eyes as his gaze fell on Feng Er who was standing behind Huang Xiaolong, and he added, “But your maid guard stays!”

However, his words ended right there as a shadow blurred, and before he could react, Huang Xiaolong’s fist greeted his face, sending him crashing into the cliff wall in far the distance.

A resounding boom shook the air, and dust and gravel fell to the ground.

The Sand Waves Sect’s disciples were stupefied. Now, not only Liang Mingzhi’s nose and mouth were crooked, his whole face was lopsided at sixty degree angle. His neck looked like it was twisted at a three hundred sixty degrees angle, and was completely distorted.

“Young Lord!” The other Sand Waves Sect’s disciples shouted anxiously as they rushed to Liang Mingzhi’s side.

“You—!” Liang Mingzhi glared at Huang Xiaolong with his crooked eyes, even so, everyone could still distinguish the shock and anger on his face. ‘He was a peak mid-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, yet he was sent flying by an Eighth Order Ancient God Realm punk with just one punch? Moreover, by a punch to his face!’

“My face!!” Liang Mingzhi suddenly shrieked.

He detested people talking about his face, and now, this punk had actually punched his face!

However, his mouth looked even more crooked when he shrieked, and his shriek even sounded strange. With that voice and face, Wang Luo, and even Feng Er laughed at him.

Hearing Wang Luo and Feng Er’s laughter, Liang Mingzhi’s face turned uglier as he bellowed, “Kill him, kill him for me—!” He pointed angrily at Huang Xiaolong.

Immediately, several Sand Waves Sect’s disciples rushed to attack Huang Xiaolong. All of them were peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm cultivators.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and others were about to deal with these Sand Waves Sect’s disciples, but Huang Xiaolong said, “You don’t need to do anything. Xiaoniū and I will handle them.” Several peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm masters were perfect for him to test his Eighth Order Ancient God Realm strength.

Thus, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and the rest moved to the side.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow darted forward to attack the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples. They looked akin to two wolves among a flock of sheep.

Watching this scene, Sand Waves Sect’s Young Lord Liang Mingzhi, and the remaining disciples as well as Wang Luo blanked for a second.

Then, ruthlessness crept into Liang Mingzhi’s eyes. He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong, who was an Eighth Order Ancient God Realm, could defeat the several peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm Sand Waves Sect’s disciples.

But this thought had barely come to his mind, when one of the peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm Sand Waves Sect’s disciples tumbled back in the air, after he was punched by Huang Xiaolong.

The little cow was even more ruthless. Her tail struck out like a whip, hitting one of the peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm disciples. Then she turned her butt and smashed the expert into the distance so hard that he was seeing stars. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

And so, the battle in the midair continued.

A chain of blasts shook the air, turning the air current volatile.

Sometime later, the battle came to an end, as Huang Xiaolong and the little cow stopped attacking.All of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples were either half buried in a mountain or the ground.

Huang Xiaolong’s frosty gaze swept over Liang Mingzhi and the remaining Sand Waves Sect’s disciples. These disciples’ battle power was low, despite being peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm cultivators. They were almost at the same level as the sea tribe’s Guo Jun, maybe even weaker by a tad.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Liang Mingzhi.

Liang Mingzhi and other Sand Waves Sect’s disciples finally realized something. As they looked at Huang Xiaolong, fear and shock intermingled in their eyes.

They had never heard of a person with such talent and battle power, except for one person; not to mention, witness it with their own eyes.

“Y-you, you’re that Huang Xiaolong?!” Suddenly, one of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples shouted.

Huang Xiaolong!

Hearing that name, stunned the rest of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples.

“It’s him! He’s Vientiane World’s Huang Xiaolong!”

“It must be him! That’s right, it’s said that even the eight-tailed Silver Whale Guo Jun was not his match during the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony!”

"He can transform into a primordial divine dragon!"

The Sand Waves Sect’s disciples shouted sentences one after another, sounding extremely lively.
