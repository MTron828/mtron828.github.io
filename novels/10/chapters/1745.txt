Chen Zhao laughed, “That’s right.”

In fact, he wasn’t the only one looking for Huang Xiaolong in the Divine World. When Zhou Chen had released the news of the bounty, many people in the Divine World had started looking for Huang Xiaolong.

Two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones! Even someone like the young master of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace was moved.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Zhou Chen really looks too highly upon me. Does he wish to capture me with just two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones?! Am I only worth two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones?!”

As the King of Hell, he was only worth two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

One had to know that he had spent forty million low-grade chaos spirit stones to purchase the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin in the past!

With Huang Xiaolong’s current identity, it wasn’t an exaggeration for him to say that even a single hair on his body was worth more than two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Chen Zhao looked at Huang Xiaolong as though he was looking at a clown as he snickered, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you are worth that much? You’re just someone who has a king of supreme godhead. If not for that, you won’t even be worth two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. Do you really think that a personal disciple of Zhao Lei will be someone for whom Ancestor Zhou Chen would take out two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones? What a joke.”

Of course, if Huang Xiaolong was merely a disciple of Zhao Lei, there was no way he would be worth two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.

In Chen Zhao and Zhou Chen’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong was a mere disciple of the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong no longer held back his laughter. “If you want to claim the reward with Zhou Chen, aren’t you afraid that I am the illegitimate son of Jiang Hong? Aren’t there rumors going around about me right now?”

Chen Zhao laughed as well. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you can be the illegitimate son of someone like the Grandmist Emperor? Stop trying to make yourself look better. How can someone like the Grandmist Emperor be related to you? I have already checked up on your background. You are merely someone who came from the lower worlds. There is no way you can be the Grandmist Emperor’s son.”

Chen Zhao continued, “As for all the rumors out there, they are fake as can be.”

“That’s right. I came from the lower worlds. It seems like your background check was pretty thorough.”

Zhao Chen chuckled, “Huang Xiaolong, are you going to give yourself up now, or should I make a move personally? Don’t worry. I won’t kill you. You won’t be worth that much money if you are dead. I can claim the two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones only by handing you over alive. If you die, I will only get one hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in amusement. “I had planned to exterminate your Nine Dragons Emperor Palace in the future. Since you have already presented yourself to me, I’ll just kill you now. I’ll kill Chen Jiangwei in the future.”

Everyone present felt as though a bomb went off in their head.

As for the members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, they roared with laughter.

“Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are? You want to exterminate my Nine Dragons Emperor Palace?!” Chen Zhao slapped his chest animatedly. “I’m so scared! I’m so scared of your declaration!”

The laughter became louder, and none of them felt the need to hold themselves back.

Even the disciple in Huang Xiaolong’s grasp laughed out loud.

Huang Xiaolong tightened his grip suddenly, and the laughter from the disciple stopped. With a flick of his wrist, he threw the body to the side.

In an instant, silence filled the air.

“Huang Xiaolong, are you blind to your current situation?! How dare you kill someone from my Nine Dragons Emperor Palace in front of my face?!” A cold light flashed through Chen Zhao’s eyes. “Right now, you no longer have the protection from the Fortune Emperor Palace. There is no more Fang Gan to protect you. You are nothing but an abandoned dog on the streets! Since that is the case, I’ll cripple all of your limbs. No, all five of them! I’ll cripple you before sending you over to Zhou Chen!”

Since all Zhou Chen wanted was a living Huang Xiaolong, Chen Zhao decided to beat Huang Xiaolong to his last breath before handing him over.

Five limbs... Of course, that included the region between Huang Xiaolong’s legs.

Before Chen Zhao could end his sentence and make a move, a figure flashed, and the sound of eggs breaking resounded through the air. Chen Zhao felt intense pain shooting up his body.

With a miserable shriek, Chen Zhao was sent flying through the air.

All the members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace watched the scene in stunned silence.

Huang Xiaolong retracted his right leg and muttered, “I haven’t trained the skill in a long time. It seems like I didn’t regress that much. I’m still pretty good at it.”

“Young Master!!”

The members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace snapped back to reality, and they panicked. All of them rushed forward to assist Chen Zhao.

When everyone else in the surrounding looked at him, they saw the mangled piece of meat in Chen Zhao’s pants and his pale face. Looking at how his lips were twitching, all of them seemed to feel a cold breeze blowing against their nether regions.

“Cripple that dog!” Chen Zhao glared at Huang Xiaolong and mustered all his strength to yell.

All the disciples from the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace turned around in unison and pounced on Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at them charging towards him, Huang Xiaolong snickered coldly.

Most of the disciples from the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace were of God King Realm strength. As for the number of Heavenly Monarchs, there were several elders and grand elders in the mix, but their strongest was at the middle stages of the Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and slapped downwards.

A massive palm formed with chaos lightning materialized in mid-air, and it brought about a devastating might. As though a mountain of chaos lightning had descended on the world, the palm landed directly on their heads.

The members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace noticed the sky turning dark in an instant, and all of them raised their heads only to see a massive palm crashing down towards them.

In the next instant, a massive explosion resounded through the air, and Brimming Snow City trembled violently.

When the experts housed in the city felt the tremors, all of them were overwhelmed with shock.

In the distance, Chen Zhao looked at the massive palm print in the ground, and his body froze, and his mind blanked out.

Several hundred members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace were mushed into a paste in the ground, and even the elders and grand elders were unable to escape from their gruesome fate.

“You... You, are you really Huang Xiaolong?!” Chen Zhao raised his head and stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Those elders and grand elders in the Heavenly Monarch Realm were smashed into the nothingness from his single palm!

How could Huang Xiaolong possess such terrifying might?!

In the past, Huang Xiaolong was merely at the mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. How in the world did he advance so quickly?!

When Huang Xiaolong heard Chen Zhao questioning his identity, he chuckled in amusement. “What do you think?”

As he spoke, Huang Xiaolong took several steps and closed the gap between them.

Chen Zhao revealed an expression of terror, and he pushed himself backward, away from the approaching terror. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you think you’re doing?! If you dare to cripple me, my father won’t let you off! The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace will hunt you down no matter the cost!!”

Chen Zhao thought that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t dare to touch him due to his identity as the young master of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace.

“Cripple you?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. He raised his hand and pointed at the space between Chen Zhao’s eyebrows, killing him with a single strike. Chen Zhao wasn’t even able to close his eyes before he died.

Looking at the corpse before him, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to destroy the corpse. He rose into the air and left Brimming Snow City with the four odd beasts.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered about the treasures any longer! The only thing he wanted to do was to return to the Fortune Emperor Palace!
