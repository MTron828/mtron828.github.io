Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Lan Tailong disappeared in a blur from the spot and appeared blocking the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples’ path.

The Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples’ faces paled when they saw Lan Tailong blocking their path.

“Brightness Emperor’s Disciple!”

Their first thought was to turn around and run.

But when they had just turned around, energy sword qi pierced through their backs and came out from their chests.

The Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples screamed in pain. Their bodies plummeted to the ground, falling into a pool of blood.

Looking at the dying Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples below, Lan Tailong sneered coldly, “If you want someone to blame for this misfortune, then blame Huang Xiaolong. But don’t worry, I won’t kill you guys.”

From the beginning, Lan Tailong did not intend to kill these Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples. However, his radiance sword qi had completely destroyed their divine veins. Now, they were no different than ordinary people who could not exert any godforce.

One could imagine what would happen to those without a shred of godforce in this Secret Region where Heavenly Demons, devils, ghosts, and countless metal beasts roamed.

With those words, Lan Tailong disappeared from the spot.

A moment after Lan Tailong left, numerous Heavenly Demons flew out from the surrounding mountain range towards the group of Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples, attracted by the luscious scent of blood.

The Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples were absolutely terrified as they realized their immediate predicament. All of them scrambled up from the ground and started running as fast as they could. Unable to employ any godforce, their speed purely relied on their physical strength.

But it didn’t take long for the Heavenly Demons to catch up to them.

Undulating blood-curdling screams sounded in the air, but they were short-lived.

Heavenly Demons tore the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples into bloody pieces with their jaws and swallowed them into their bellies.

This group of Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples, with abolished godforce, was powerless to fight back the Heavenly Demons. Moreover, as their godheads remained intact, their consciousness was preserved. Hence, they watched themselves being torn apart and eaten by Heavenly Demons until the moment their godheads shattered into pieces.

......

Half a day passed.

A shadow blurred in the air, and in the next second, Huang Xiaolong had descended onto the branch of a towering tree.

In this half a day, he had left the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Lan Tailong in the dust, and a while ago, he had pulled the Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan down from the second place.

Currently, he was in second place, one spot below the Heavenly Prince Di Jing.

But his current points were 261,300 while the Heavenly Prince Di Jing had already amassed 423,000 points!

It was a big gap of 160,000 points and some more.

Do not underestimate the difference of hundred and sixty thousand points. A Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm prey was equivalent to 1,000 points. Huang Xiaolong needed to kill more than a hundred and sixty Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm beasts to close this gap. More importantly, it had only been half a day into the trial. If the difference continued to widen at this rate, there would be a gap of million points between them by the end of the month. That was a minimum estimation.

Huang Xiaolong frowned gradually, looking at the Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s points. Judging from the pattern of the Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s rising points, it was very likely that his cultivation had broken through to the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Di Jing’s points increased by 1,000 every time, sometimes 2,000, 3,000, and even 4,000 points.

There could only be one explanation for these circumstances—the Heavenly Prince Di Jing had killed one or two, maybe even three or four Heavenly Demons of Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. The ability to kill four Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Heavenly Demons easily spoke volumes of Di Jing’s cultivation realm and strength.

A light flitted across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he fell into deep thought.

From the start of the trial until now, most of his kills were Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm and below. At this rate, he definitely wouldn’t catch up to Di Jing’s points anytime soon. Not to mention that the gap between them was widening every second.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone with determination.

Everyone, including Heavenly Prince Di Jing, was confident that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t win first place. Since everyone believed he was the king of retard for betting forty million on himself for his reputation’s sake, he would show everyone who’s the real retard!

Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense spread out, covering over a hundred million li radius and locking onto all the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Heavenly Demons within the area. In a flicker, he disappeared from the tree branch. When Huang Xiaolong reappeared, he was tens and thousands of li away, in front of an early Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm metal beast.

His speed increased more than ten times as he executed space concealment and teleportation simultaneously!

Roar—!

The metal beast had metal armor protecting its body from head to toe. This metal beast looked like a giant wolf that would roar at a human who appeared suddenly in front of it. Powerful soundwaves caused the surrounding mountains to shake, while the metal beast’s sharp claws slashed at Huang Xiaolong.

The Radiance Divine Scepter appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand in a glimmer. His Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s radiance godforce surged into the scepter, and it released a blinding light.

Huang Xiaolong’s body shifted forward, and the Radiance Divine Scepter was embedded into the giant wolf metal beast’s head. In the next moment, the scepter split open the giant wolf metal beast’s head like it was cutting through soft, snow-white tofu. The giant wolf metal beast howled in pain, and blood shot out like a rain of arrows as it tumbled to the ground.

A Heavenly Demon’s defenses were strong, but as a metal armor protected a metal beast from head to toe, its fortifications were even higher. A cultivator at the same realm as the metal beast would have difficulty breaking its metal armor, yet the Radiance Divine Scepter pierced through the metal armor like it was tofu.

A ray of light shot out from the giant wolf metal beast’s corpse, falling onto Huang Xiaolong’s jade plate. His points rose immediately.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong was already moving on to the next Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Heavenly Demon and metal beast.

A second later, the crowd on the plaza saw that Huang Xiaolong’s points had soared, closing in on the Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s points, and their eyes widened in astonishment, while their throats felt dry.

“This Huang Xiaolong, does he, does he really, want, want to chase up to His Highness Heavenly Prince?” One of the Heavenly Court’s Marshals muttered with disbelief. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Impossible! How could it be possible for Huang Xiaolong to catch up to His Highness’ points? Our Heavenly Prince has the Heavenly Dao Godhead, the Heaven’s Dao Physique, a top-notch talent like none other. Even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor is inferior compared to him, then how can Huang Xiaolong compete with His Highness? It’s a blasphemy to compare him with His Highness!” Yu Shi’s spit flew everywhere.

The entire plaza was enshrouded in a heavy silence.

All eyes were staring at the first and second place on the rankings board.

They could hear their heartbeats racing in their ears as they watched the first and second place points increase rapidly.

......

Half a day later...

Finally, Huang Xiaolong’s name on the rankings board shone bright, and it shook. So did the Heavenly Court Secret Region. Huang Xiaolong, who ranked second, jumped to the first place!

And the Heavenly Prince fell to second place!

Huang Xiaolong’s name shone brightly as the sun, emitting ten thousand zhang long resplendent rays.

The Heavenly Court’s marshals were agape as they stared at the rankings board. The Solitude Emperor Palace’s Gudu Wuyi was wide agape in shock, and so were the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Chen Jianwei, the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Chen Wenqian, and the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Liu Yuan. Even Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Li Shan, Mo Xiao, Peng Yi, and many others also had the same expressions.

“H-he, he actually surpassed His Highness?!” The Heavenly Court’s marshal’s stammering voice sounded through the plaza.

“This... is impossible! How is it possible that Huang Xiaolong surpassed our Heavenly Prince?!” Yu Shi muttered intelligibly, but refuted stubbornly, “Even if he has surpassed the Heavenly Prince at the moment, that doesn’t mean he can maintain the first place. That’s right, that’s right, His Highness is this era’s undisputed genius, and the first place can only belong to His Highness!”

The True Divinity Sect Chief Wang Haojun looked at the name on the highest spot of the rankings board, whilst shocked, there was also wryness in his shock, “Looks like our previous assumptions are really wrong!”

When Huang Xiaolong had surpassed the True Divinity Sect’s Long Shaozhen earlier, they had guessed that Huang Xiaolong might have broken through to the Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm like Long Shaozhen...

But now, they doubted if was it merely the Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?
