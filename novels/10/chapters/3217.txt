Chapter 3218: Take Revenge for Me!

Di Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless when facing an expert such as Huang Xiaolong. He used everything he had, and he summoned a creation artifact level armor to protect himself.

“Save His Highness!”

“Kill the Purple Lightning Young Master!”

The experts who stood around Di Xiaolong screamed as they made their moves hastily.

In an instant, a multitude of lights covered the entire city.

The experts around Di Xiaolong were experts chosen by himself personally. They were also the strongest of his subordinates, and the weakest person present had comprehended five elements to the grand completion stage! There were even some who had ten elements at the grand completion stage!

All of them charged towards Huang Xiaolong in a desperate attempt to save Di Xiaolong.

Rushing beneath Huang Xiaolong’s belly, they knew that it was the weakness of the Dragon Race.

However, one had to be strong enough if they wanted to exploit a weakness. All of them were too weak, and by the time Huang Xiaolong’s tail swept over, they were sent flying away from the energy waves created. Even Di Xiaolong’s desperate attempt to protect himself failed to slow Huang Xiaolong’s tail down the slightest bit. When it struck, the armor on Di Xiaolong’s body shattered and he shot out like a shooting star. He smashed through countless structures before arriving at the edge of the Hidden Dragon Sacred Land.

When he landed, the entire sacred land trembled.

“What?!” Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao gasped in shock when they saw what happened from a distance away.

The two of them could naturally see that Huang Xiaolong was much stronger than he was during their battle three thousand years ago!

They couldn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong improved so much in such a short amount of time!

In the Dao Emperor World, they obtained a ton of resources in the Mysterious Magician’s treasury. Even though they managed to improve a little, it was nothing compared to Huang Xiaolong’s rate of improvement!

Their expressions sank as killing intent built up in their hearts. Huang Xiaolong was too damn terrifying and their desire to kill him grew ever so strong.

After sending Di Xiaolong’s group flying, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother chasing them. Instead, he turned to look at Huang Shengdao and Fu Luosen coldly.

He was extremely satisfied with the power he could wield.

Very quickly, the two of them arrived.

“Huang Xiaolong, I have to say, I’m extremely impressed by your guts. Who would have thought that you would appear in the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire after the battle three thousand years ago?! Hahaha! You even dared to move against Di Xiaolong in his celestial empire!” Fu Luosen sneered, “Even if the two of us allow you to live, the experts of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire will hunt you down!”

“You’re definitely going to die today!”

“Let’s see who manages to save you this time!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Fu Luosen roared in rage.

Even though Huang Shengdao didn’t say a word, he was planning to work with Fu Luosen like before. The two of them would attack Huang Xiaolong from both the front and the back.

A chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips, and he disappeared from where he stood. Appearing before one of the experts working under Fu Luosen, Huang Xiaolong’s claw swiped across the air, turning countless experts around the man into meat paste.

Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao were shocked by his sudden movement. No one expected him to move against the other party’s subordinates.

When the two of them were shocked, Huang Xiaolong’s tail swept through the ranks of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire, killing even more people.

All of them were Fu Luosen’s trusted subordinates, and everyone that died caused his heart to ache a little.

“Huang Xiaolong, you shameless bastard! Stop right there!” Fu Luosen screamed with rage.

“Shameless? Me?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “When you killed my subordinates, did you think of yourself as a glorious b*stard? The two of you worked together to fight me, and that’s really honorable of you guys!”

The two of them stared at each other in stunned silence.

With his figure flashing once again, even more people died.

Fu Luosen could no longer contain his rage as he transformed before charging at Huang Xiaolong. Huang Shengdao didn’t hold back as he transformed into a golden dragon and lunged at Huang Xiaolong.

Instead of returning their attacks, he continued to kill the subordinates working for the two of them!

In the past, Fu Luosen killed Li Shuo and He Zhen! Now, he would kill two thousand of them in return!

After receiving the old dragon’s grand cosmos energy, Huang Xiaolong’s speed far surpassed the old him. He was even faster than the two of them, and no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t catch Huang Xiaolong.

When they saw their subordinates dying one by one, anger rose in their hearts.

As the battle raged on, Celestial Emperor, Di Cangtian, received the news. Jumping out of his throne in fright, he brought the other four with him as they charged towards the Hidden Dragon Sacred Land.

They weren’t the only ones. Even the Celestial Emperor of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, Huang Dinghai, rushed over.

As for Zeng Le, the Celestial Emperor of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, he stood by the side ready to watch the show play out.

“This time, we have to kill Huang Xiaolong!” Huang Dinghai roared at the experts of the True Dragon Celestial Empire.

“I’ve heard that he seriously injured Di Xiaolong just now.” One of the marshals of the True Dragon Celestial Empire mocked, “Seems like we won’t have to make our move. Di Cangtian will definitely use everything in his disposal to kill Huang Xiaolong. Everyone knows Di Cangtian loves Di Xiaolong the most out of all his sons…”

Huang Dinghai nodded and chuckled, “Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong was stupid enough to do that? He dug his own grave… Whatever the case, let’s play it by ear. It would be for the best if we kill Huang Xiaolong ourselves.”

The members of the True Dragon Celestial Empire nodded in acknowledgement.

When the experts of the various factions were rushing over, the battle raged on. With their combined might, the entire region shook.

Countless experts watched the battle using various tools, and they had nothing but praises for the three of them.

“Huang Xiaolong is much stronger than he was in the Dao Emperor World! How in the world did he improve so quickly in three thousand years?! Wasn’t he seriously injured in the past? He should take several dozen years to recover, no?” Someone who watched the battle in the past gasped in shock.

“I’ve heard that he has three different types of cosmos energy. I doubted the claim, but it seems like he is really someone special! He should be the first person in the history of the universe to possess three small worlds!”

“So what?! He’s still going to die! If I’m Huang Xiaolong, I would have hidden myself in some nameless sacred land and cultivated in seclusion for countless years before emerging! Now, he won’t be able to escape!”

Discussions flew about and there were many who were gloating in his misfortune.

By the time the battle reached the climax, Di Cangtian and the others arrived.

When Di Cangtian saw Di Xiaolong who was beaten half to death by Huang Xiaolong, rage rose in his heart. However, a feeling of helplessness soon followed.

As soon as Di Xiaolong witnessed the arrival of Di Cangtian and the others, he jumped to his feet and cried in anger, “Father, that dog b*stard beat me up! You have to take revenge for me!”
