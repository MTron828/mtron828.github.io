Chapter 3072: Blind As a Bat

Early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, three worlds’ cosmos energy, twelve high-order Saint Fates, peak major completion power of nirvana, and perfection level absolute poison power!

“He wants to defy the heavens with this!” a patriarch from the Absolute Dao Heavenly Creed mumbled under his breath.

With this degree of talent, even the Son of Mystic dimmed in comparison.

The Son of Mystic comprehended five elements of absolute powers. However, when the Son of Mystic’s cultivation was at the early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, he had only comprehended one kind of absolute power.

Until now, none of the Son of Mystic’s five elements of absolute powers had reached major completion, much less peak major completion, and they were even further away from perfection level.

These two people were on different levels.

“This, this… Is he someone on the Extermination List’s top twenty?” someone estimated upon seeing Huang Xiaolong’s battle prowess.

“Probably higher!” A Wild Maples Heavenly Cave’s experts refuted, “Although he’s only an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, don’t forget that he has three worlds’ cosmos energy, and twelve high-order Saint Fates, and these two points completely make up for his lower cultivation realm. Even if he’s not in the top ten on the list, he definitely has to be in the top fifteen!”

Everyone clearly heard what this Wild Maples Heavenly Cave’s expert said, including Jin Xiaoxiao, Hong Yi, Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s disciple, Chen Yi, and others.

Jin Xiaoxiao, Chen Yi, and the others ashened with despair, especially Jin Xiaoxiao when she remembered what had happened in Xuan City. She had actually wanted to snatch the treasures from Huang Xiaolong’s hands. She trembled and fear appeared in her dilated pupils.

An existence in the top fifteen!

This kind of existence, not to mention her, her father, and even her godfather had to avoid.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable looked at Huang Xiaolong, who was enshrouded by power of nirvana and absolute power of poison, the desire for the battle raged in his eyes. “I really did not expect that you would’ve already reached peak major completion in power of nirvana, and perfection level in absolute power of poison. However, I am still very interested in experiencing your strength!”

Although Huang Xiaolong had peak major completion power of nirvana, and perfection level absolute poison power, Wind Cloud Dao Venerable still had some confidence to battle Hunag Xiaolong.

In terms of absolute powers, Huang Xiaolong could indeed suppress him, but then again, at times, what determined the outcome of a battle was not any absolute power but also other factors. Cosmos artifact for one, grand dao art, as well as the mastery of one’s absolute power were few examples of these.

At the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm was only at the early of Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, and in Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s opinion, Huang Xiaolong’s mastery of absolute powers could not be compared to him. Moreover, he had obtained the Tree of Nightmare from the Dream Cave not long ago!

“Oh.” Upon sensing Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s brimming motivation, Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly.

An azure light glimmered in Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s hand as two huge hammers appeared!

He had personally forged this pair of cosmos artifacts, called Wind Cloud Hammers!

Hammer on the left was forged with genesis-level wind element ores, whereas the hammer in his right hand mainly used genesis-level earth element ores, the left and right hammer increased the lethality of his absolute wind power, and absolute earth power significantly.

“The Wind Cloud Hammers! Peak-level cosmos artifact! One of the top ten cosmos artifacts of the Origin Holy World!”

Many experts’ eyes shone when the hammers appeared.

Although peak-level cosmos artifacts were rare, there were a few of them in the Origin Holy World, and those that were ranked into the top ten cosmos artifacts of the Origin Holy World definitely possessed a startling amount of destructive power.

Then, a tree emerged from the void above Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s head!

The tree was thirty thousand meters tall with a prism of dreamy and surreal halos around it. Seconds into looking at the hazy, dreamy halos, everyone began to feel sleepy, and this alarmed many experts. They were Dao Venerable Realm experts, and it had been millions of years since they needed to sleep, yet they were actually feeling sleepy now. This was totally abnormal.

“The Tree of Nightmare!”

“Genesis treasure!” an expert blurted out.

The others were jolted to their senses.

Although the Tree of Nightmare couldn’t be compared to the Tree of Origin, the Tree of Nightmares brought a similar benefit to the Tree of Beginning.

“Correct, the Tree of Nightmare,” Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s eyes gleamed as his gaze fixed on Huang Xiaolong. “Please show your weapon.”

Although he had not refined the Tree of Nightmare, he could exert a certain part of the tree’s powers, and when the Tree of Nightmare’s nightmare qi spread, Huang Xiaolong’s dao soul would definitely be affected, slowing down his movements and attacks.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Wind Cloud Hammers in his hands, as well as the Tree of Nightmare suspended above his head, and a soft chuckle escaped his lips. Streaks of purple lightning appeared on the surface of his skin, and gradually grew into a school of purple lightning dragons.

“No, this can’t be true, right?!” Looking at the purple lightning around Huang Xiaolong, an expert from the Absolute Dao Heavenly Cave nearly took a tumble.

“Abs-absolute lightning power!”

Moreover, it was absolute lightning power that was close to the peak major completion stage. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s heart throbbed violently as if it was going into cardiac arrest.

Whilst everyone was trying to process that Huang Xiaolong wielded a third element, the power of absolute lightning, and speckles of icy blue frost floated around him.

These icy blue frost appearing on a burning sandy land made a dazzling contrast.

“Absolute frost power! Perfection level!” someone yelled loudly.

Everyone turned to look and saw that the person was actually Jin Hongyuan, the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave’s lord.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable stared fixedly at the power of nirvana, absolute poison power, absolute lightning power, and absolute frost power around Huang Xiaolong, and if he was brimming with confidence in the beginning, then right now, he was overflowing with despair. His surging desire for battle vanished without a trace, replaced by fear, unsease, and panic.

“Top, top ten?!” someone muttered weakly, and he was immediately served with a bombardment of slaps and knuckles to the head by his master and a curt, “Shut up!”

A long time later, another person answered in a quivering voice, “It’s top three!”

Top three!

Comparable to the Origin Holy World’s terrifying hegemons!

Huang Xiaolong was merely an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable.

On the Golden Fox Flying Ship, the blood drained from Jin Xiaoxiao’s face, and the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s second disciple Chen Yi who had challenged Huang Xiaolong earlier, crumbled to the ship deck in fear.

“I, I’ve lost,” Wind Cloud Dao Venerable spoke those words with difficulty. Those very words seemed to have exhausted his strength, and the strong hands gripping the Wind Cloud Hammers hung limply on the sides.

A while later, he put away the Wind Cloud Hammers, and closed his eyes as he respectfully saluted Huang Xiaolong, “Wind Cloud was blind as a bat thus offended Lord, please pardon me!”

Blind as a bat!

After watching Wind Cloud Dao Venerable respectfully bow to Huang Xiaolong, claiming that he was blind as a bat rendered all present experts agape. The Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s prestige as an expert on the Extermination List’s top twenty, as well as the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce’s President.

However, they quickly accepted the fact that recalling Huang Xiaolong’s strength was comparable to the Origin Holy World’s three hegemons.

……

Half a day later.

Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and the rest of the group left the Golden Flame Sandy Land.

After leaving the Golden Flame Sandy Land, Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and the rest did not enter deeper into the Heavens Burial Lands. They boarded the Purple lightning Peak and returned to the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, straight to Leiyu Creed.

Back at Leiyu Creed, Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion inside the Sun Moon Furnace.

Sitting cross-legged under the Parasol Tree inside the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong took out the Rebirth Purple Crystals, and circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, as he began to comprehend and absorb the power of nirvana within.
