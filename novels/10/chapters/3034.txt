Chapter 3035: Old Friend’s Junior

“Motherf*ckers… I’ll personally drag them down here right now!” One of the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerables from the Zhendan Creed, who was sitting in the ordinary seats, raged.

The Zhendan Creed was ranked number six among all the creeds.

As for the person who spoke, he was one of the hall masters of the creed and his name was Chen Luqi.

Before he could get to his feet, his friend grabbed him from behind. “Are you tired of living?! Are you planning to turn into the next Yang Dingtian?!”

Chen Luqi stared at his friend in stunned silence as his expression started to contort. “They were the ones who killed Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian?!”

“That’s right! The skinny old man behind him was the one who killed the two!” The friend pointed at the Old Monster Flame.

Changing his mind, Chen Liqi quickly returned to his seat.

“Humph, he’s just someone with a slightly stronger subordinate.” Chen Luqi grumbled. “That doesn’t give him the right to sit in the pavilion…”

As there were only a hundred seats in the pavilion, only peak existences in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave would be arranged a seat in it.

“That’s hard for us to say.” A profound light flashed in his friend’s eyes. “The branch master of the Mystical Pavilion definitely has his reasons for doing so. The kid might be rich. From what I’ve heard, he didn’t care about losing a hundred million dao coins to the Devil Curse Creed. Moreover, the three-headed beast he’s riding managed to throw out several tens of millions whenever he wanted to.”

Chen Luqi sneered, “Humph, I’ll be able to take out several hundred million too.”

As the sixth-ranked creed in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, they were pretty damn rich. It wasn’t surprising for Chen Luqi to take out several hundred million dao coins.

Shaking his head, his friend chose to remain silent.

“Her Highness, Jin Xiaoxiao, has arrived!” An announcement rang through the skies and everyone in the venue got to their feet. Even Chen Luqi stood up, and he didn’t dare to show the slightest disrespect.

In the Origin Holy World, the power of region lords couldn’t be underestimated. They wielded a lot of power, and if the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave was compared to a dynasty of the past, the Golden Fox Creed would be the supreme emperor and Jin Xiaoxiao would be a treasured princess in the imperial family. Members of the Golden Fox Creed would be considered nobles, and everyone else were peasants.

As such, Chen Luqi and the others were paying respect as their vassals. No one dared to slight Jin Xiaoxiao, and it was also the reason why Li Dongjun would say that Huang Xiaolong deserved to die after the incident on the streets.

A lady clad in golden robes slowly entered the venue as a group of experts followed behind her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Nodding her head slightly when she saw how respectful everyone was being, a look of satisfaction appeared in her eyes.

However, she soon caught sight of Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu in the pavilion, and her expression turned cold. They didn’t even bother looking at her, the princess of the Golden Fox Creed!

“Preposterous! How dare you not bow when you see Her Highness?!” A Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable behind Jin Xiaoxiao turned to glare at Huang Xiaolong’s group and he roared in anger.

Treating it as though they were clowns performing in a circus, Huang Xiaolong ignored them. He remained seated and turned to chat with Lei Yu. The Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable couldn’t help but roar in anger once again.

“Get down here!” Reaching out with one arm, he charged through the skies to grab Huang Xiaolong.

In the instant he moved, everyone felt as though the space around them started to constrict. The world seemed to conform to the man’s will, and he appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

“That’s the Cosmos City Master’s grand dao art, the Cosmos Palm!”

The Cosmos City Master was a legend in the Origin Holy World. He was someone who ranked eighty-second on the Extermination List, and his name struck fear into the hearts of many.

Right before he could touch Huang Xiaolong and the others, the Old Monster Flame moved. Like he was getting rid of a speck of dust on the ground, the Old Monster Flame swatted the man away. Slamming head first into the ground, his legs were the only visible part of his body left. It was a perfect coincidence that his legs were pointed at Jin Xiaoxiao.

The venue fell silent as Chen Luqi, who was claiming that he would drag Huang Xiaolong down from the pavilion, swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

The experts behind Jin Xiaoxiao jumped in fright as their expressions changed. The commander of the Golden Fox Army felt his eyelids jumping in distress.

When the incident in the Heaven Seizing Inn started to spread, everyone heard about how terrifying the Old Monster Flame was. He killed Chen Huo and Yang Dingtian like they were flies, but not many people thought that he was actually as strong as described. They felt as though his strength had been exaggerated multiple times, but now that they were seeing it for themselves, they felt uncontrollable fear gripping their hearts.

Jin Xiaoxiao was equally as shocked. Burning rage clouded her mind when she saw the man’s legs facing her.

“Princess, please head over to the second chamber in the pavilion.” One of the attendants from the Mystical Pavilion gestured to Jin Xiaoxiao before anything else could happen.

After all, he had to leave her a way out.

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong from the side of her eye, Jin Xiaoxiao soared towards the second chamber.

After she entered, the members of the Mystical Pavilion started to clean up the area. They brought the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable out of the hall as they tried their best to save him.

“The Dragon Venerable Jian Huang has arrived!”

Not too long after Jin Xiaoxiao entered her chamber, another announcement rang through the skies.

A scholarly-looking, middle-aged man entered the venue. Sword qi filled the air as soon as he appeared and everyone felt like a sword was held to the edge of their necks.

“It’s been so many years since we last met. This little brat’s strength has increased by quite a bit,” Lei Yu couldn’t help but praise.

“Is he your old friend?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. He could see that the Dragon Venerable Jian Huang was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and his sword dao had already reached the small completion stage.

“Not really. He’s a junior of one of my friends.”

The Dragon Venerable Jian Huang was still pretty weak when they last met. Lei Yu’s old friend had paid him a visit in the past, and the Dragon Venerable Jian Huang tagged along. He wasn’t even a high-level Dao Venerable then, but after so many years, the little kid of the past had turned into a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm expert! Warmth filled Lei Yu’s heart when he saw the Dragon Venerable Jian Huang.

Entering one of the chambers in the pavilion, he nodded towards Jin Xiaoxiao. When he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu, a trace of suspicion formed in his eyes.
