Ouyang Yunfei smiled confidently, “After my breakthrough to the Ancient God Realm, no disciples in the surrounding islands will be my rival, only those elite geniuses from the Dragon Origin Island, Twin City Island, Luoshan Island, and other dozens of big islands could slightly threaten me.”

There were no less than a hundred human-inhabited islands under the Fortune Gate’s territory, and the strength of some of them wasn’t any lower than the top forces on the Fortune Mainland. A few of those islands were precisely the Dragon Origin Island, Twin City Island, Luoshan Island, Anyang Island, New Boulder Island, Spirit Lake Island, Hengwu Island, Peak Lake Island, and Heavenly Dan Island Ouyang Yunfei had mentioned!

They were known as the top ten islands.

Each of these islands’ overall force could easily destroy ten thousand Green Cloud Islands.

Not to mention that the genius disciples nurtured by the forces on those islands had outstanding talent. In fact, in every term of the All-Islands Great War, the spots in the top one hundred were monopolized by these islands’ disciples.

Other islands like Green Cloud Island, Dralion Island, or Perennial Temple Island only had a quota of five participants every term. Even the Ouyang Clan was the same, however, the top ten islands were different. Every term, those ten islands had a quota of fifteen spots each!

“Right, Young Lord, there’s a matter to report.” Ouyang Jiang said, then briefly described the situation with Yao Chi.

Ouyang Yunfei was extremely interested when he heard about Ouyang Jiang’s encounter. “A mere core disciple of the Barbarian God Sect actually has a First Order Ancient God Realm Green Ice Hail Devil for protection? And a beauty at that? I’m very interested in this female disciple, unfortunately, the All-Islands Great War is more urgent and I need to prepare for it. It looks like I’m making a trip to the Barbarian God Sect after the All-Islands Great War ends.”

As Ouyang Yunfei said that, he approached the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast, fire dancing in his pupils. In the next second, a ball of bright red fire fell and wrapped around the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast from above.

Ouyang Yunfei was examining the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast’s body, but he did not detect the soul mark Huang Xiaolong left, for that soul mark had completely merged with the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast’s godhead.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was hurrying back from the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield while killing Ancient God Realm magic beasts, absorbing their energy. Although he was hurrying, there was still some time before the All-Islands Great War began and he planned to raise his strength as much as possible.

Hence, when he and the little cow reached the Green Cloud Island, a little over three months had passed.

After they arrived on the island, Huang Xiaolong returned the Black Baboon and the Golden Gorb Insects into the Xumi Temple.

The Barbarian God Sect was calm and peaceful when he arrived, everything looked normal. However, when Huang Xiaolong saw Yao Chi, his face darkened. He then turned to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling at his side, demanding, “Who was it?”

Although Yao Chi’s injuries had healed more than half in three months, without any traces left on the surface, Huang Xiaolong could tell at a glance that Yao Chi had recently suffered heavy injuries.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling understood that Huang Xiaolong had realized that Yao Chi was previously injured. Neither of them dared to conceal the truth, immediately recounting in detail the matter about the Ouyang Clan Grand Elders taking away the Black Flame Sea Emperor and injuring Yao Chi as well as Bing Xingying.

“Ouyang Clan?” A cold light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Yao Chi persuaded him, “Xiaolong, forget it, I’m fine now. It’s just a Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast, we already have its blood after all, it’s enough for us to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill. The Ouyang Clan isn’t the Giant Tribe, don’t go to the Wide Emperor Island!"

In the past, Huang Xiaolong took two full bottles of blood from the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast as a precaution. This amount was sufficient to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill.

Huang Xiaolong gently caressed Yao Chi’s long hair for a moment, reassuring her, “Don’t you worry, I know what to do. I’ve already said, no one can hit you!”

For a split second, Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent soared to the peak.

Everyone had their reversed scale, and Huang Xiaolong’s reversed scales were Yao Chi, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and his family.

Tears wet Yao Chi’s eyes—’no one can hit you’!

She naturally remembered this sentence that Huang Xiaolong had said to her when rescuing her from the Cao Family! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Because of her, Huang Xiaolong killed Cao Yang and the others in anger, the scene was deeply imprinted in her mind.

“Xiaolong, I understand that you don’t want me to feel wronged, but I don’t want anything to happen to you because of me. The Ouyang Clan’s Patriarch and Ancestor are both Seventh Order Ancient God Realm masters. Moreover, the Ouyang Clan has more than ten Ancient God Realm cultivators.” Yao Chi shook her head, looking somewhat powerless, “Although you have two Fifth Order Ancient God Realm Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, you are still far from being their opponent.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Silly, didn’t I just tell you that I’m confident?” With that, he turned to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling, asking them for information related to the Ouyang Clan.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling attentively replied to all of Huang Xiaolong’s questions.

“Oh, Ouyang Yunfei is already heading to the Fortune Mainland?” Hearing Lu Zhuo say that the Ouyang Clan’s Young Lord, Ouyang Yunfei, had departed to the Fortune Mainland half a month ago, Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“That is so.” Lu Zhuo nodded his head, adding, “From my information, that Ouyang Yunfei has broken through to the Ancient God Realm half a month ago.”

After Ouyang Jiang took away the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast, Lu Zhuo made every effort to find out the latest news about the Ouyang Clan’s movements.

The fact that Ouyang Yunfei had stepped into Ancient God Realm wasn’t easy to come by.

“Although there are a few months left before the All-Islands Great War begins, many participating disciples from other islands have already started to head over to the Fortune Mainland. After arriving at the Fortune Mainland by transmission array, the participants need time to make their way to the location determined by the Fortune Gate.” Gu Ling went on, “Ouyang Yunfei possesses the Malapert Beast Physique and was born with strong godforce, power, and defense. If you run into him during the All-Islands Great War, you must be careful!”

Lu Zhuo agreed and said, “That’s right, this Ouyang Yunfei also has a high rank godhead; we do not know in detail, but I assumed it is likely to be the same rank as your godhead, a low grade king rank godhead. His current strength is enough to enter the top one hundred, so when you come across him, you must remember to be patient and accommodating, do not get into a conflict with him. Based on your current strength, you will definitely be accepted into the Fortune Gate, other things can be decided after that.”

Because Huang Xiaolong habitually concealed his cultivation, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling weren’t able to tell that he was already a late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Listening to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s heartfelt advice, Huang Xiaolong merely nodded.

’Ancient God Realm?’

Huang Xiaolong inwardly snickered with disdain, he was truly looking forward to meeting this Ouyang Yunfei in the All-Islands Great War.

Since Ouyang Yunfei possessed the Malapert Beast Physique, he should be able to withstand one-tenth of his strength, right?

“Inform the Great Whale Sect and Elephant Genesis Sect. Ten days later we’ll set off to the Fortune Mainland.” Huang Xiaolong said to Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling.

Both men nodded in compliance.

Before that, Huang Xiaolong was planning to go to the Blood Phoenix Forest’s Hundred Beasts Summit and collect that Ancestral Dragon Fruit.

Three days later, above the Hundred Beasts Summit, bright light rippled; the Black Baboon, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow appeared.

In a flicker, the three appeared above an open space on the mountain.
