Chapter 3444: Two Universes

As a God of Creation, Xuan Hai could use universe origin energy to supplement himself. His speed was extremely quick. He disappeared from the Xuan Hai World in the blink of an eye.

However, Huang Xiaolong was just as quick with his 3.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy and the Huang Long Cape.

Huang Xiaolong followed closely behind Xuan Hai.

Noticing that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t falling behind, Xuan Hai took a closer look at Huang Xiaolong. When he noticed the Huang Long Cape billowing behind Huang Xiaolong, he gasped, “That… That’s the Huang Long Armor Set! Are you Huang Xiaolong?!”

He recognized Huang Xiaolong the instant he saw the cape.

All these years, Huang Xiaolong had been hailed as the strongest genius in the universe! Many experts were paying attention to him. Xuan Hai definitely knew who he was too.

So that was the case…

After learning Huang Xiaolong's identity, fear filled his heart.

He finally knew why Huang Xiaolong could possess 3.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy before entering the God of Creation Realm.

However, he still found it unbelievable. After all, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even reached the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm 20 million years ago! Now, he managed to accumulate 3.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

Suppressing the fright in his heart, he continued to flee.

I need to escape as soon as possible!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t let up as he followed closely behind.

Very quickly, half a year passed.

The two of them played a game of cat and mouse for half a year straight, and god knows how many worlds they crossed while they were at it.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong wasn’t letting up, humiliation and rage-filled Xuan Hai’s heart. He was embarrassed by the fact that he was being hunted down by an existence he could kill with a slight stomp several million years ago!

If anyone else were to see him in his sorry state, what would they think?!

“Huang Xiaolong, are you really planning on chasing me down?!” Xuan Hai roared with rage.

“Where did Pangu go?” Huang Xiaolong asked once again.

“What has he got to do with you?! What the f*ck is your problem?” Xuan Hai raged.

“What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

With the Pangu Axe and his cultivation of the Pangu World Creation Art, Huang Xiaolong could be said to be Pangu’s inheritor.

Also, Huang Xiaolong would only be able to enter the God of Creation Realm thanks to the Pangu World Creation Art. As such, he was pretty thankful to the man.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t deny that having Pangu’s assistance when dealing with Huang Sheng would make things much easier.

Huang Sheng wouldn’t be afraid of the old dragon, but what would happen when they added Pangu to the mix? Even someone like Huang Sheng would have to think twice. At the very least, he wouldn’t dare to do anything if he failed to ascend past the God of Creation Realm.

Killing intent shot out of Xuan Hai’s eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, you better not piss me off. I might not be able to kill you, but I’ll hunt down everyone you care about! I’ll make them live a life worse than death!”

“My master is the Blazing Dragon. You can go and look for me all you want.”

Blazing Dragon?! Xuan Hai felt the world turning dark around him.

Torturing the Blazing Dragon?! Is that even possible for someone at his level?! It was clear that Huang Xiaolong was messing with him.

Just like that, the two of them soared through the air. After countless years of chasing, they lost track of how far they had gotten.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xuan Hai might not be Huang Xiaolong’s opponent, but he was still a God of Creation. He was slightly faster than Huang Xiaolong, and the only reason Huang Xiaolong was able to keep up was because of the Huang Long Cape.

Huang Xiaolong frowned when he looked at the fleeing Xuan Hai. Keeping up the chase wasn’t an option. He had to think of something else.

When Huang Xiaolong was thinking of a way to force Xuan Hai to stop, Xuan Hai charged straight into one of the giant star fields in the sky. No one knew why, but Huang Xiaolong felt his heart thumping when he stared at the star field in his sights.

After a short moment of hesitation, Huang Xiaolong charged in behind Xuan Hai.

The moment he did, he realized that everything around him was gray and lifeless. The entire region seemed to be the birthplace of chaos and nothingness.

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls, but he realized that something was obstructing him from feeling anything around him.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. However, he chose to continue the hunt. As he continued onwards, he felt the space around him turning more and more solid. The mysterious qi in the air caused him quite a lot of discomfort, despite his strength.

Xuan Hai’s aura started to fluctuate in the distance.

Gritting his teeth, Huang Xiaolong continued the chase.

After one entire month…

He was surprised to discover that the area they were in didn’t seem to have an end.

His speed was nothing short of terrifying. It would take less than a day for him to cross a holy world. Now, he traveled for one entire month without seeing the end of the space before him!

Was he trapped in an illusory space?

No… He was sure that everything he was looking at was real.

After several days, Huang Xiaolong felt a terrifying wave of devouring energy surrounding him and he failed to react before he was thrown into a dark abyss. His body fell from the skies without control, and panic started to fill his heart.

What in the world was going on?

Trying to soar back up into the skies, Huang Xiaolong discovered that he couldn’t move a single muscle in the dark abyss!

After an entire day of falling, Huang Xiaolong felt his body grow lighter. He dropped out of the abyss as a blinding light filled his vision. He couldn’t help but close one eye before trying to stabilize himself.

Looking around, Huang Xiaolong could see that he was still in space! However, he discovered some slight differences. He was no longer in the universe he knew!

He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but he was sure that he was no longer in the universe he knew!

An absurd thought formed in his mind. Could there actually be a second universe?!

If there really was a second universe, why didn’t his master, the Blazing Dragon, know anything about it?

Also, Huang Xiaolong wondered if Xuan Hai led him over there on purpose.

Could Xuan Hai have long since learned about the existence of a second universe?!

Huang Xiaolong thought about Pangu’s disappearance and his mind soon drifted to other Gods of Creation.

His heart sank when he realized the endless possibilities.

He only heaved a sigh of relief when he felt the three worlds in his body operating normally.

Looking all around him, Huang Xiaolong took a single step and traveled in a random direction. He didn’t see anything after several days, and it seemed as though he was stuck in a desolate region in space! After tens of days, Huang Xiaolong finally discovered the presence of a massive flying ship.
