In his rare moment of vague consciousness, Huang Xiaolong felt a glaring light shining at him, making him open his eyes and standing up as he surveyed his surroundings. He found himself standing at the same large ice island, but the iceberg that was in front of him before had disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong raised his arms up; both of his arms were still intact!

His head lowered, checking his legs; his legs were still there!

No parts of his body were missing! He actually didn’t die?!

‘What exactly happened?’ Huang Xiaolong clearly remembered that he was swallowed by the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, how was he still alive?!

“Old Dragon, what happened? We actually didn’t die?” Huang Xiaolong’s face split into a foolish grin. He thought he was dead for sure, but now that he woke up to discover that he was still alive, this was indeed a matter to be happy about.

“I also am not very clear why the two of us did not die, however, check your current strength.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi also spoke with obvious gratification.

Strength? Huang Xiaolong was baffled, but he still did as Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said.

“This... peak mid-Eighth Order God Realm?!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in surprise after checking his condition.

He actually advanced to peak mid-Eighth Order God Realm? When and how did this happen? Then, Huang Xiaolong noticed a round icy-snow fire inside him.

This icy-snow fire was...

“The Black Tortoise Divine Fire!” Huang Xiaolong almost shouted. Why was the Black Tortoise Fire inside his body?! Moreover, the Black Tortoise Fire and him were one, integrated.

“It really is the Black Tortoise Divine Fire! Kid, looks like not only we didn’t die, it was a blessing in disguise!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi laughed, saying, “Not only you, even my strength has increased by a lot, on top of that, my true form, the Golden Dragon physique’s defense and power have greatly strengthened!”

After undergoing the Black Tortoise Divine Fire’s tempering, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi had already discovered that his true form’s physique was more sturdy and tougher, totally transformed!

Hearing Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi say this, Huang Xiaolong quickly checked his physical condition. To his delight, his True Dragon Physique had also grown much stronger, and there were some distinctive changes.

Huang Xiaolong quickly ran the Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art as a thought crossed his mind, causing the Treasure Dragon diagram to emerge. To Huang Xiaolong’s amazement, from the deep void, an exceedingly pure spiritual energy drilled into his body.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong noticed that this spiritual energy was shimmering like it was weaved out from starlight.

When this shimmering starry spiritual energy entered his body, it was instantly absorbed, integrating with every part of his True Dragon Physique.

A refreshing cool feeling spread all over Huang Xiaolong’s body, every pore on his skin opening.

“This is Black Tortoise Galaxy’s star force!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi screamed excitedly.

“Black Tortoise Galaxy’s star force!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned at first, but it quickly turned into delight, “You’re saying that this is the star force of the Black Tortoise Galaxy?!”

The Black Tortoise Galaxy’s star force was the highest grade of spiritual energy in the galaxy!

“Yes, it definitely is the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s star force, only that spiritual energy could be so incredibly pure.” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was certain.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to calm his racing heart.

It seems like he had successfully integrated with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to absorb the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s star force.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t suppress the waves of excitement in his heart, letting a loud shout skyward. Vigorous echoes of his voice shook the surrounding ice mountains, causing ice and snow to roll down.

Some of the ice and snow landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, feeling cool and refreshing. This time, this ice and snow brought him a comfortable feeling.

They were at the deep region of the Black North Sea where everything was frozen solid at the slightest contact with the ice and snow here. Before this, even Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi dared not allow these little things fall on his Golden Dragon true form.

Watching the Black North Sea snow drifting from the sky above, Huang Xiaolong tried to summon the Black Tortoise Divine Fire inside him. An icy blue light flashed over Huang Xiaolong’s hands as two wisps of icy-snow fire appeared in his palms.

With a gentle wave, the two wisps landed on two different ice mountains in the distance. Huang Xiaolong watched as the two mountain evaporated like water in a split second! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Erased from this land!

The power of the Black Tortoise Divine Fire made him gasp in amazement. Even Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi felt a shiver watching this.

This surpassed terrifying!

Every single iceberg inside the deep regions of the Black North Sea was formed after hundreds of thousands of years, even millions or longer. They were extremely tough, to the point that Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi couldn’t say for sure that he would be able to shatter an ice mountain despite using his full strength.

Yet, the Black Tortoise Divine Fire had a large ice mountain evaporated in an instant! Not even a little layer of the ice mountain remained!

Looking at the spots where the two ice mountains used to be, Huang Xiaolong himself was feeling scared.

That time in Royal Pill City, if he and Xiang Mingzhi competed on a martial stage instead of alchemy refinement, he definitely wouldn’t be Xiang Mingzhi’s opponent.

Who’s to say that he wouldn’t have been been turned into a pool of mist by Xiang Mingzhi’s Azure Dragon Divine Fire?

But now, he had the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, this greatly assured Huang Xiaolong.

Although it was said that the Azure Dragon Divine Fire was the ‘head’ of the four divine fires, his Master Ascending Moon Old Man had said that neither one of the four divine fires was stronger than the other, what really mattered was the strength of the person who obtained them.

Now that he had the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, he had the confidence to defeat Xiang Mingzhi again if put up against him.

A long time later, Huang Xiaolong regained his calm. Sitting down cross-legged on the ice island, he circulated the Asura Tactics. The Treasure Dragon diagram emerged as he began cultivating by absorbing the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s star force.

The Black Tortoise star force entered Huang Xiaolong’s body from the deep void.

Energy flowed endlessly, shimmering like stardust.

Huang Xiaolong was wholly shrouded inside a cocoon of star force. From the distance, he was like a small floating star, shining brightly.

By the time Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes again, several days had passed.

After just a few days of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong was astounded to discover that his strength had increased once more, albeit very little. Yet, it was comparable to him cultivating for one year while consuming Exalted Divinity Pellets daily! Close to the speed of his cultivation when he absorbed the rank six godhead.

He believed that it wouldn’t take long for him to breakthrough to late-Eighth Order God Realm.

‘I wonder if Father and Mother are doing well.’ After his elation passed, Huang Xiaolong thought of his family. During the time he was integrating with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, his consciousness has been vague, therefore he didn’t know how long the integration process took.

Thinking of his family, Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air, flying out to the outer periphery of the Black North Sea.

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of the cold after integrating with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, hence the Flame Dragon Vessel was unnecessary. His flying speed was also much faster than the naval vessel.

He would most likely be out of the Black North Sea in half a day.

While Huang Xiaolong was flying out of the Black North Sea at high speed, on the outer periphery of the sea, there were Nether Ice Palace masters in fire element armor everywhere.

“It has already been five years, how could the murderer who killed Young Palace Lord still be here?” A Nether Ice Palace Elder grumbled.

“This is Palace Lord’s order, we have no other choice. Until the day we find the murderer, we’ll be staying in the Black North Sea.” Another Nether Ice Palace Elder shook his head, sighing.

A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong appeared in the sky above the Black North Sea’s outer periphery, sneering as he watched a group of Nether Ice Palace masters and listened in to their conversation. Unexpectedly, these Nether Ice Palace people were so persistent, even more so when he heard that five years had passed!

At this point, a few Nether Ice Palace masters noticed Huang Xiaolong’s presence and flew toward him.

Huang Xiaolong pondered for a moment, deciding not to use the Black Tortoise Divine Fire. Instead, he took out the Mulberry Sword.

After all, the Black Tortoise Divine Fire’s power was too terrifying, there was still some use for these people’s corpses.
