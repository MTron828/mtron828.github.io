Chapter 2784: You’re Muddle-Headed!

When Huang Xiaolong finally entered the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm and left seclusion, he was shocked by the prosperity of Cangqiong Sacred Land. He didn’t believe it was the same place he had started developing forty years ago!

After forty years of progress, Cangqiong Sacred Land was four times larger than it once was!

The density of spiritual energy in the air had surpassed Tang Dragon Sacred Land of the past.

Countless cities stood tall around the various continents, and spiritual herbs could be seen growing on the endless mountain ranges that spread across the land. Barren wastelands couldn’t be seen anywhere, and neither could swamplands or marshes. It seemed like every continent was blooming with life.

As the disciples of the various powers traveled about on top of divine beasts, the prosperity of the region could be imagined.

Cangqiong Old Man felt smug in his heart when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s surprised expression. “How about it! Cangqiong Sacred Land isn’t too bad, right?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily, “Indeed… Indeed…”

Even though a large part of the reason Cangqiong Sacred Land could flourish was because he had integrated over a dozen sacred lands, his master’s hard work couldn’t be ignored.

Long Jianfei snickered at the side, “Young Lord, we arranged several tens of thousands of ancient formations around Cangqiong Sacred Land. Even if ten Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors work together to bombard us, they won’t be able to shake Cangqiong Sacred Land in the slightest!”

Before entering seclusion, Huang Xiaolong had ordered for them to reinforce the formations around Cangqiong Sacred Land. In the past forty years, Long Jianfei and the others had done exactly that. The defenses of Cangqiong Sacred Land were at least a thousand times stronger than before!

Of course, that was also because they had the resources ‘provided’ by the ‘kind’ Nine Revolutions Sacred Land and the other treasures Huang Xiaolong had obtained. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to lay down even ten ancient formations around Cangqiong Sacred Land, much less tens of thousands of them.

Since it was a formation that could stop Primal Ancestors, they needed to use special spiritual veins, spiritual stones, and tons of other precious treasures.

Long Jianfei and the others soon brought Huang Xiaolong around Cangqiong Sacred Land.

They couldn’t help but introduce Huang Xiaolong to the great changes that had happened in the past forty years. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly and realized that they had stopped after a short while.

“What’s wrong?”

“We have news related to Saint Devil Sacred Land.” The Cangqiong Old Man frowned when he spoke of their name. “Since past forty years, many sacred lands have submitted to Saint Devil Sacred Land after the apprenticeship ceremony. Now, nearly half of the sacred lands in Saint Devil Heavenly Cave have submitted to them. Right now, they are planning on clearing out some of the sacred lands that refused to give in!”

“Also, they said that they would choose our Cangqiong Sacred Land as their number one target!” Mo Zhi continued, “They felt that our Cangqiong Alliance would threaten them more than the sacred lands ranked among the top ten superpowers here…”

Cangqiong Old Man sighed, “There’s a reason they chose us as their number one target. When the Saint Devil Prince went over to take Yan San as his master, every single sacred land sent over envoys to congratulate him. We were the only ones who didn’t.”

“Moreover, our foundations seem weak compared to the other alliances.”

Cangqiong Old Man sighed in resignation and continued, “I’ve heard that the Saint Devil Sacred Land managed to pick out more than ten thousand Primal Ancestors from those who submitted. They are currently cultivating the Saint Devil Grand Formation in order to exterminate us with one hundred percent certainty!”

Ten thousand Primal Ancestors!

Moreover, they are trying to set up a formation with their combined strength!

Fei Yanzi and the others fell into silence instantly.

Even though they knew that Huang Xiaolong possessed extraordinary combat prowess, even though there were over a thousand Primal Ancestors in the Cangqiong Alliance, and even though they strengthened the formation around Cangqiong Sacred Land by over a thousand times, there was no way they could hold off ten thousand Primal Ancestors!

Compared to Fei Yanzi, Mo Zhi, and Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng and Long Jianfei seemed much more composed. After all, they were members of a creed. They had seen many large-scale battles in the past.

“There’s not much for us to worry about. Duan Feng and I are prepared to reveal our identities as members of the Dragon Fish Creed and the Divination Creed.” Long Jianfei sighed. “Even if the Saint Devil Sacred Land gained the backing of the Blue Heaven Creed, they wouldn’t dare to touch us!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “You have left your respective factions for far too long. They should have already canceled your name from the disciple records. Saint Devil Sacred Land will definitely be able to find that out.”

It was a common occurrence for disciples of a creed to disappear. If a disciple didn’t return after many years, they would naturally lose their status and identity in their faction.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng had been missing for god knew how long. There was no way their factions still kept their discipleship records.

Long Jianfei sighed, “Even if that was the case, we still have our identity plaques. We can use it to scare the disciples of Saint Devil Sacred Land. They would need some time to check their records.”

“Even so, it will only take several years for them to bring the truth to light.” Huang Xiaolong shook his arms to dismiss the idea. “We won’t be able to change anything in the short amount of time. There’s no need for you to expose your identities for this.”

“But…” Just as Long Jianfei was about to persuade Huang Xiaolong to follow through with the idea, he was interrupted by the man himself, “There’s no need to bother about these things. All I want to know right now is if you managed to gather the intelligence I asked you to.”

Before entering seclusion, he had asked everyone to be on a lookout for news on dao pills’ auction. Other than that, he wanted them to looked for news on purple grandmist aura or great origin qi.

Right now, he needed higher grade dao pills in order to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm. Purple grandmist aura and great origin qi would also help.

Too bad for him, everyone shook their heads in unison. They had tried their best to search for the things Huang Xiaolong had requested, but to no avail. The only reason Huang Xiaolong had managed to run into a dao pills auction was due to his luck. Those auctions didn’t usually appear, and one would only be able to discover one after several tens of thousands of years.

At that moment, the Saint Devil Prince was looking at the ten thousand Primal Ancestors who were cultivating the Saint Devil Grand Formation in the Hongxuan Sacred Land. When he saw the way they cooperated and unleashed most of the power the formation held, he nodded his head in satisfaction.

“Your Highness, are we really clearing out the Cangqiong Alliance first?” The old housekeeper, Zhu Yu, asked.

Chuckling in amusement, the Saint Devil Prince responded, “Of course we are. Is there a problem?”

“I’ve heard that there’s a formation god backing Cangqiong Sacred Land. Moreover, it’s said that Huang Xiaolong possesses peerless talent. He took over Nine Revolutions Sacred Land with brute force.”

As though he had heard the funniest joke in his life, the Saint Devil Prince roared with laughter, “Why would you listen to those rumors?! The number of formation gods in the world can probably be counted on one hand, and various creeds don’t even have one! How will a mere sacred land be able to gain the backing of one? If the rumors were true, the Cangqiong Alliance would have already swept through the entire Saint Devil Heavenly Cave!”

“As for Huang Xiaolong’s strength… Hmph. Do you really think a True Saint like him can take down Nine Revolutions Sacred Land on his own? Are you getting muddle-headed?! How dare you bring up such bullsh*t in my presence?!”
