Previously, Shi Ming hadn’t planned to make a move when he knew that the King of Shadows and Lun Zhuan were helping Dun Ei. However, he couldn’t shake the sense of unease in his heart, and he had decided to head over to the Radiance Divine World to take a look.

Of course, he hadn’t come alone.

As soon as the words left his lips, another figure appeared behind him.

As soon as he appeared, the dark mist seemed to fill the area. Boundless ghost qi swirled around, and it was as though there were billions of ghosts forming a sea of souls behind him. With the shake of his arm, he would be able to command his army of ghosts to join the battle.

Even though the newcomer’s fame couldn’t compare to Shi Ming, the aura around him was enough to show that he wasn’t a weakling.

“Who is he?!” Some of the experts failed to recognize him, and they couldn’t help but ask.

Since he could appear in the Radiance World with Shi Ming, he surely wasn’t a nobody.

Moreover, the aura he emitted was stronger than the likes of Chu Han or Chiyou.

“It’s Qin Fan!” Someone exclaimed in shock. When the bishops and archbishops from the Radiance Knight Corp heard his name, their expressions changed.

“It’s Qin Fan indeed... It’s the city lord of Fengdu City! The strongest expert in the Ghost World!” someone continued, and everyone swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

No one would have thought that the city master of Fengdu City, Qin Fan, would be willing to join hands with Shi Ming to stop Huang Xiaolong from unifying the Radiance World.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils shrank when he saw Qin Fan.

Dun Ei roared with laughter as a feeling of joy appeared in his heart. “Huang Xiaolong, with Senior Shi Ming and City Lord Qin Fan making a move, you’re definitely going to die!”

His maniacal laughter boomed through the air.

The appearance of Shi Ming and Qin Fan was out of everyone’s expectations.

Shi Ming chuckled under his breath. “Huang Xiaolong, I bet that you had never thought that the city master of Fengdu City would work with me. Your speed of improvement is too terrifying. If we allow you to unify the Radiance World, you will probably sweep through the three worlds in Hell next. All the powers in Hell would suffer, and as an overlord of his world, Qin Fan doesn’t want anything like that to happen.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly, “Even with the addition of Qin Fan, do you think that you can stop me from unifying the Radiance World?”

It was Qin Fan’s turn to speak. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that you will be able to achieve your goal?”

While Qin Fan spoke to Huang Xiaolong, Shi Ming didn’t remain idle. He took a step and crossed the large distance between them and Huang Xiaolong. Soon, Shi Ming appeared in front of him.

He reached out and sent a palm strike towards Huang Xiaolong. His palm strike continued a terrifying amount of corpse and frigid qi. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s expression changed. He whistled, and the sixteen wings behind him shook once again. Boundless radiance energy surged into his body as the Radiance Divine Seal, and Heavenly Hall emitted resplendent rays of light in the space above his head. The Radiance Divine Scepter in his hand produced a pillar of light that welcomed Shi Ming’s attack.

Huang Xiaolong summoned his supreme godheads, and they appeared around him in an instant.

Simultaneously, the twelve twelve-winged angels turned into rays of light that swirled around Huang Xiaolong. They turned into a tiny world around him.

As the Radiance Ancestor’s soul strand appeared once again, a palm formed from light slammed towards Shi Ming’s attack.

Boom!

Shi Ming’s palm clashed with the Radiance Ancestor’s palm strike.

Boom!

The giant palm formed from radiance energy was destroyed by Shi Ming in an instant. The strand of Radiance Ancestor’s soul imprint shattered.

Whatever Huang Xiaolong tried, he was facing Shi Ming now. Even though the combined might of Huang Xiaolong’s ultimate attacks were strong, Shi Ming wasn’t as weak as Lu Kun.

With unstoppable might, Shi Ming’s palm continued to fly towards Huang Xiaolong.

The four odd beasts released a loud cry, and they combined their strength to resist Shi Ming’s sudden attack.

“Four Beasts Dark Devil Palm!”

Tyrannical darkness energy covered the skies.

A cold sneer escaped Shi Ming’s lips when he saw the four beasts’ attempt to stop him. “You’re merely ants to me! Even if the King of Darkness came himself, he wouldn’t be able to stop me!” In the next second, the four odd beasts were sent flying.

Seeing the four odd beasts failed to stop Shi Ming, the ice dragons stepped up and sprayed frigid qi towards him.

The frigid qi that surged towards Shi Ming had the power to freeze an entire divine plane. However, they did nothing to stop Shi Ming’s palm.

The frigid qi scattered in the face of his terrifying strength and all the ice dragons were sent flying.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was about to be blasted to nothingness by Shi Ming’s attack, a massive city appeared in the space above Huang Xiaolong and slammed towards Shi Ming. The City of Eternity finally made its appearance! With the collective strength of all one hundred Undead Netherguards, the City of Eternity emitted boundless might.

It was too bad Shi Ming didn’t seem to care about the City of Eternity. He continued to charge towards Huang Xiaolong as an object flew out from the crown of his head to stop the City of Eternity.

When the City of Eternity slammed into the mysterious object that Shi Ming sent out, the massive city was sent flying.

In the instant the City of Eternity was sent flying, Shi Ming’s palm passed through the combined power of the Radiance Divine Seal and the Heavenly Hall. It landed on the tiny world formed by the twelve twelve-winged angels around Huang Xiaolong and Shi Ming’s energy slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s divine armor.

As Elan, Jiang Hong, and the others were held back by the Sovereign Realm experts from the other side, they could only watch as Shi Ming’s attack landed on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was sent flying and the glow around his Four Spirits Divine Armor dimmed. The sixteen wings behind him no longer emitted resplendent light as he slammed into one of the stars located in space. Even the massive star failed to stop Huang Xiaolong as it exploded with a loud bang. When Huang Xiaolong finally stopped, he vomited a mouthful of fresh blood.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had the protection of his True Dragon Divine Physique, the Ascending Devil Physique, and the Radiance Divine Physique, he failed to take Shi Ming’s palm strike.

The strength of a mid-stage Sovereign Realm expert was enough to flip the heavens over.

“Your Majesty!”

Elan and the members of the Radiance Knight Corp yelled in unison.

Huang Xiaolong turned and shook his head at Elan and the others. “I’m fine.” He wiped away the trace of blood on his cheeks and the radiance divine runes on his wings started to swirl about again. As radiance energy poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body, he quickly recovered to his peak state.

“Shi Ming is that all you got?!” Huang Xiaolong glared at Shi Ming and continued, “I have already received the inheritance of the King of Hell and the Radiance Ancestor. Regardless of whether I’m in Hell or the Radiance World, no one will be able to kill me. Even if a high-level Sovereign comes, he won’t be able to take my life, let alone you!”

The experts who were hiding around to watch the battle stared at each other and saw the look of dismay in the other party’s eyes.

Of course, Shi Ming wouldn’t back down because of what Huang Xiaolong said. “Even if I can’t kill you here, I’ll just seal you up and bring you out of the Radiance World! Once we’re out, I’ll kill you anyway!”

He had long since thought about what he had to do if he failed to take Huang Xiaolong’s life in the Radiance World.

That was also why he was extremely jealous of Huang Xiaolong. If only I was the one who received the inheritance! With my strength, no one will be able to stop me! Even if Lord Wan Shi of the City of All-Heavens came, he wouldn’t be able to kill me!

Shi Ming no longer hesitated as he made his move against Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, you are nothing more than a slightly larger ant in my eyes! Let’s see how long you will be able to last!”

A palm that contained the strength to shatter the world flew towards Huang Xiaolong. It brought with it a boundless corpse sea and endless frigid qi. However, a massive purple dragon appeared on the horizon before his attack could land on Huang Xiaolong.
