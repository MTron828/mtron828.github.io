Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm?

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a split second but swiftly nodded his head. “That wasn’t inaccurate either.”

Li Lu and Yao Chi were very happy to hear that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong was a little speechless seeing the level of their happiness. Do they need to be so happy hearing that he had broken through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm?

A while later, Huang Xiaolong began helping Li Lu to resolve the ancient nefarious nightmare soul inside her body using the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool. If Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation would have been merely at the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, it would have taken him quite an effort to resolve the ancient nefarious night soul, but with Huang Xiaolong’s current late-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm, he was completely eradicated the ancient nefarious nightmare soul in less than half an hour.

Huang Xiaolong inwardly sighed in relief as he looked at Li Lu enshrouded in a halo of light as she sat meditating. He left the room without disturbing her.

After the nefarious nightmare soul was killed, it had turned into a vast source of pure energy, so it was going to take Li Lu some time to refine and absorb this amount of pure energy.

When refining the nefarious nightmare soul’s pure energy, Li Lu was also going to be able to absorb the two God King’s Buddha Pellets over time, and her cultivation would reach a new height after absorbing all these energies.

Currently, Li Lu’s cultivation was at the Eighth Order Ancient God Realm, but by the time she would have absorbed the God King’s Buddha Pellets and the nefarious nightmare soul’s energies, she would’ve most likely advanced to the First Order Ancestor God Realm.

Before leaving the room, Huang Xiaolong laid out a spiritual energy gathering formation around Li Lu to increase her speed and smoothen her process in refining the God King’s Buddha Pellets and nefarious nightmare soul’s energy.

“Xiaolong, how’s Younger Sister Li Lu?” Yao Chi was waiting outside the room. When she saw Huang Xiaolong she immediately approached him and inquired about Li Lu.

Huang Xiaolong gave her a reassuring smile. “With your hubby here, of course, there was no problem.”

Yao Chi was relieved at his words, but then spat disdainfully, “Hmm, who’s your wife?”

Huang Xiaolong stared at her as the corners of his mouth curved into a wicked smile.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s wicked smile, her heart started racing inexplicably, and her cheeks turned red. Next, Huang Xiaolong heard her stammering voice, “Y-you, what are you doing looking at me like that...”

“Yao Chi wifey, it’s been a long time since we did that...” Huang Xiaolong laughed softly.

Yao Chi turned red down to her neck. She abruptly turned to leave, stating in a fluster, “I’m going to cultivate.”

Huang Xiaolong was quick to follow her and said, “I’ll go cultivate with you!”

“Who wants to cultivate together with you!”

“But I want to cultivate together with you!”

“Ah, no—!!”

......

This time around, the ‘cultivation duration’ was longer than usual.

It was so long, that it broke previous records.

Huang Xiaolong was making up for lost time, which he had spent cultivating.

Several months later, there was trepidation in Yao Chi’s eyes when she looked at Huang Xiaolong, as if she was looking at a hungry ferocious beast.

Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion once more, and this time, it was to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade’s second restriction.

A few months ago, when Huang Xiaolong had first refined the Netherworld King’s Jade, some information related to the Netherworld King’s Jade had appeared in his mind. The Netherworld King’s Jade indeed contained the Lord of Hell’s heritage, but the way to obtain the Lord of Hell’s heritage could only be known after he passed through the third restriction.

Due to Huang Xiaolong’s previous experience refining the Netherworld King’s Jade, this time, he was more familiar with the refining process.

He activated the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation and streaks of golden dragon lightning qi flew out from his arms and fell onto the Netherworld King’s Jade, and headed straight towards the second restriction.

When the golden dragon lightning qi reached the second restriction. Similar to the first time, the Netherworld King’s Jade emitted a radiant black light that condensed into a darkness archdevil.

As expected, this darkness archdevil was stronger than the first restriction’s darkness archdevil, from its momentum to its darkness element energy.

When the golden dragon lightning qi approached the darkness archdevil, it was immediately repelled back by the darkness archdevil.

However, the chaos golden dragon lightning qi was the bane of all darkness element creatures, evil creatures, and also archdevils, hence the darkness archdevil could only repel the chaos golden dragon lightning qi and not dispersed it.

As the streaks of golden dragon lightning qi accumulated, it formed a golden lightning ring around the darkness archdevil.

The chaos golden dragon lightning qi began to corrode away the darkness archdevil’s darkness element energy. Even though Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had advanced to the late-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm, the difficulty of burning away the second restriction’s archdevil was more than twice as hard as the first restriction.

Not to mention, the godforce consumption was higher as well.

It took four months for the darkness archdevil to disintegrate.

The boundless hell, blinding darkness, and waves of blood scent appeared once again.

......

Inside the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s Assembly Shrine, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were frowning.

“Why is that kid still in seclusion at this point?” Blood Knife Ancestor grumbled. “There’s only five years left until the headquarters’ registration deadline, even though he has the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, he will need that much time to rush to the headquarters. If he doesn’t come out soon, he will miss the deadline!”

Golden Brow Ancestor suggested solemnly, “Let’s wait for another month. If that kid still doesn’t come out, we can only have Senior Xiang Xun force him out regardless.” But his eyes bent into crescents as he smiled and said, “I wonder what realm is that kid now. I’ve heard that when he came out of seclusion a few years back, he had successfully broken through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, and helped Li Lu to resolve the evil spirit in her body.”

Blood Knife Ancestor chuckled happily, “According to that kid’s scary cultivation progress, maybe he’s already a mid-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm!”

Golden Brow Ancestor snickered, “Based on Xiaolong’s scary battle prowess, even at the mid-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm, who’s to say he can’t battle you!”

Blood Knife Ancestor chuckled, “Though that kid’s battle prowess is shocking, he needs to reach Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm first to fight me.”

In the blink of an eye, another month passed by.

Just as the two of them were going to request Xiang Xun to contact Huang Xiaolong, they received news that Huang Xiaolong had just exited his seclusion.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor exchanged a glance.

“Let’s go take a look at that kid.”

They turned into two streaks of light across the sky and disappeared.

Shortly, the two of them met up with Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun in Vientiane World’s outer space.

“Kid, you’re finally out.” Blood Knife Ancestor laughed happily seeing Huang Xiaolong. “If you wouldn’t have come out right now, we would have smoked you out from your seclusion.”

Huang Xiaolong grinned. “I’ve made Masters worried.”

Golden Brow Ancestor laughed, “One month ago, Blood Knife Ancestor and I were guessing your cultivation realm, once you would come out. You’ve already broken through to the mid-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm, right?”

Huang Xiaolong’s grinned widened as he responded, “This time, I would like to take this opportunity to spar with Masters.”

Masters...?!

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were both stunned, and looked at Huang Xiaolong to confirm that he wasn’t joking. After all, Golden Brow Ancestor was a peak early First Order God King Realm master.

Blood Knife Ancestor snickered at Golden Brow Ancestor, “Look, look, this kid’s arrogance has no bounds. He thinks after breaking through to the Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm, he could battle a God King Realm master!” Then he turned to Huang Xiaolong and laughed. “Alright then, it’s been a long time since I’ve loosened my muscles. Today, I’ll play with you, but I warn you in advance that my Great Blood Knife Technique has improved recently, so watch out ah.”
