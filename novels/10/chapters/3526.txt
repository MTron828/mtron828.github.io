Chapter 3527: Why Aren’t You Slapping Yourself?

 

The envoy of the Dark Shadow Race was tossed over to the members of the Fantasy Butterfly Race.

“You can deal with him. You can choose either to execute him now, or throw him into prison,” Huang Xiaolong added.

Naturally, the four Gods of Creation were too lazy to deal with someone like an envoy from the Dark Shadow Race.

Wang Yi and the others were shocked, but they bowed respectfully.

Eventually, they chose to imprison the envoy.

“Send someone to tell the old ancestor and patriarch of the Dark Shadow Race that if they don't personally show up to surrender to the Fantasy Butterfly Race, they can wash their necks and get ready to die,” Wang Meiqi spoke to Wang Yi.

Staring at her in shock, Wang Yi muttered, “There is no way they will surrender…”

“Just send them the message. It doesn’t matter whether they surrender or not,” Wang Meiqi sighed.

Wang Yi had no idea what she wanted to do, but he accepted the order respectfully.

“Wang Xinming, are there large chambers of commerce in the Six Dao Holy World? Those with branches all over the Trickling Scarlet World…?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Every universe used its own currency, and Huang Xiaolong wanted to exchange some treasures for cash. At the same time, he wanted to look for information on the First Universe.

Wang Xinming replied quickly. “Yes. Your Highness, the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce is one of the largest Chamber of Commerce in the Trickling Scarlet World, and there’s a branch nearby.”

“Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce?” Huang Xiaolong nodded eventually and got Wang Xinming to lead the way over.

However, he didn’t bring anyone from the race. Wang Xinming, Wang Meiqi, Ao Shenghai, and Ao Guang were the only ones going with him.

Along the way, he asked about matters regarding the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce.

When they learned that there was a God of Creation backing the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce, the four Gods of Creation were slightly taken aback.

“What? Huang Zongquan is the backer behind the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce?” Wang Meiqi’s reaction was the largest.

Huang Xiaolong and the others looked at her curiously.

“Is Huang Zongquan from the Ice Phoenix Race?”

“Yes, Lord Ancestor. I’ve heard that Huang Zongquan is the second son of the old ancestor of the Ice Phoenix Race. He’s the only disciple in the race who possesses the bloodline of both the Fire Phoenix and the Ice Phoenix.”

Wang Meiqi nodded slightly. Turning to Huang Xiaolong and the others, she explained, “In the past, the Ice Phoenix Race was one of our closest allies…”

Of course, she didn’t tell them that Huang Zongquan tried to chase her in the past. He didn’t just try to pursue her like a normal person, but he did it like a madman.

When Wang Meiqi heard that Huang Zongquan had entered the God of Creation Realm, complex emotions welled up in her heart.

There were many people who chased her in the past, but there weren’t too many of them who entered the God of Creation Realm.

Several days later…

Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the branch of the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce.

It was massive, and it spanned countless miles. There were countless palaces laid around the land. Blue-colored flames filled the skies, and it was a breathtaking sight.

“The Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce looks the same wherever you go. I heard that they placed a grand dao spiritual vein of the ice and fire attributes under every branch, and it would form a grand formation as time passes,” Wang Xinming explained.

Even though he was the old patriarch of the Fantasy Butterfly Race, he hadn’t entered the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce more than ten times in his life. After all, one would spend millions of dao coins every time they entered the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce.

He would be awed by the prestige and might of the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce every time he came.

Huang Xiaolong and the others quickly approached the main entrance of the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce.

The entrance of the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce was comparable to the entrance to the palace of a celestial empire. There were several dozen experts lining the doors, and they were no weaklings. They were in the Dao Venerable Realm, and even though they wouldn’t interrogate anyone who tried to enter, the patriarchs and old ancestors of the various factions who planned to enter the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce would retract their auras and act obediently before they did.

Wang Xinming was no different.

Just as Huang Xiaolong and the rest were about to enter, a voice rang from behind them, “Wang Xinming? Aren’t you the old patriarch of the Fantasy Butterfly Race? Hahaha, it’s rare to see you here! Are you here to buy something?”

A group of experts flew towards the entrance, and it was clear that they were there to buy some treasures. They were clad in purple robes, and there were more than twenty of them. Every single one was a Dao Venerable, and the person in the lead was a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable.

When Wang Xinming saw them, his expression changed. 

“Lord Wang Dongcheng…” Forcing a smile on his face, he explained, “I’m a mere follower.”

One could see the fear in his eyes, and Wang Dongcheng had to be someone important.

“Oh? If you’re a follower, they have to be pretty important.” He looked at Huang Xiaolong and the others, and his gaze stopped on Wang Meiqi.

A brilliant smile formed on his face, and he asked, “I wonder who this is…”

“This is the Lord Ancestor of my race,” Wang Xinming explained.

Wang Dongcheng and the others were shocked.

Lord Ancestor of the Fantasy Butterfly Race?!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the bunch of clowns as he entered the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce immediately. Wang Xinming could only follow closely behind.

One of the experts behind Wang Dongcheng could see his interest in Wang Meiqi, and he yelled, “Hold it right there! Did Lord Wang Dongcheng allow you to leave?!”

Huang Xiaolong paused, and he looked at them in amusement. “Do you have a problem?” 

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, the expert standing behind Wang Dongcheng roared, “How dare you speak to us?! Who allowed you to talk?! Hurry up and slap yourself!”

Slap yourself?!

Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi’s expressions turned frosty in an instant. A cold light flashed in Ao Guang’s eyes, and the man who spoke was sliced into a million pieces by a ray of light. He landed on the ground in a puddle of flesh.

When Wang Dongcheng and the others noticed what happened, they stared at the mess in fright.

The guards, who were watching the show play out, gasped.

The person who died was the son of a grand elder of the Wang Family, and he was called Wang Quian. He was a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable!

Wang Xinming felt the blood draining from his face when he saw the corpse.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Wang Family wasn’t a power the Dark Shadow Race could match up to! Before the Wang Family, the Dark Shadow Race was a mere ant! The Wang Family was the top family in the Six Dao Holy World, and they were one of the strongest families in the Trickling Scarlet World! Not even the world master would dare to slight the old ancestor of the Wang Family.

It was even said that the old ancestor of the Wang Family was close to the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor.
