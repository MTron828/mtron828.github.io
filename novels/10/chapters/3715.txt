Chapter 3716: Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King

Qing Luan’s eyes lit up when she saw the divine tree in his hands.

“If Little Sister Qing Luan likes this divine tree, I’ll give it to you!” Ninth Void chuckled.

A pretty smile appeared on Qing Luan’s face. “Didn’t Big Brother Ninth Void obtain the Golden Crow Tree after sacrificing a lot?”

One of the young men clad in golden armor sitting in the hall mocked, “Ninth Void, in order to obtain the Golden Crow Divine Tree, you massacred the entire Golden Crow Divine Race. You didn’t even allow the babies to escape! The blood of billions stains the Golden Crow Divine Tree and you’re planning to dirty Little Sister Qing Luan’s hand with them?”

The youngster was the Star Refinement King’s son, Cong Dan. He was also interested in Qing Luan, and he had always been going against Ninth Void.

A snort left Ninth Void’s lips. “Aren’t your hands also stained with the blood of our slaves? Practically every other year, you’ll kill a batch of slaves. Most of them are females… From what I’ve heard, none of them died with a complete corpse. Moreover, most of them were brought out from your room!”

“You!” Cong Dan raged as Ninth Void remained completely impassive.

Before Qing Luan could speak, a figure appeared in the middle of the hall, shocking everyone present.

When they saw that the newcomer was a ‘slave’ from the Human Race, their eyes widened in shock.

All of them turned to look at Qing Luan as they thought that the slave belonged to her.

However, Qing Luan’s expression sank as she addressed Huang Xiaolong. “Who the h*ll are you?! Are you tired of living?! You’re a mere slave and you dare to intrude into my palace…”

“Slave?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow. “Relax. Very soon, your Universe First Race will turn into the slaves of my Human Race!”

Huang Xiaolong had long since made up his mind. After entering the Universe God Realm, the first thing he would do was to enslave the members of the Universe First Race.

With nearly 30 billion units of grand cosmos energy, he was no longer far from the Universe God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong believed that as long as he concentrated on the Nameless Devil Mirror, he would be able to break through in the next ten million years!

When they heard what Huang Xiaolong said, the members of the Universe First Race flew into a rage.

“Preposterous!”

“How dare you?!”

“On your knees, you slave!”

Someone leaped at Huang Xiaolong from within the crowd in an attempt to take him down.

He might not be an expert who crossed the 20 billion mark, but he was close! He was a pretty famous figure in the Universe First Race, and his attack contained the power to shatter worlds!

One could say that he was stronger than Gui Chi from the Unknown Space! The Universe First Race was said to be born with the strongest constitution in the universes, and his talent was even stronger than the likes of Gui Chi and the rest!

Despite that, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at him. When the expert’s palm landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, a terrifying backlash sent him flying.

When they saw the expert flying into the distance with blood spewing from his lips, Ninth Void, and the others were dumbfounded.

“What?!”

Their expressions changed.

Everyone sat up in unison as they looked at Huang Xiaolong with fear in their eyes.

“Who… Who might you be?!” Cong Dan looked at Huang Xiaolong and asked.

“Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang Xiaolong?!”

The only person who could sneer was Ninth Void. “Humph. Huang Xiaolong, you’re pretty daring to barge into my Universe Vault. Since you came, there’s no need for you to return.”

Qing Luan secretly contacted her parents when the exchange was going on.

There was no doubt her little actions were caught by Huang Xiaolong, but he chose to let it go. After all, he wanted to deal with the two kings too.

“Do you really think so?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Do you really think that the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King are enough to take me down?”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Who do you think you are?!” Two figures appeared in the hall the moment Huang Xiaolong was done speaking.

The Blood Phoenix Queen was clad in a long crimson robe and the Titan King was tens of feet tall. His muscles were like dragons that coiled around his body and he emitted a terrifying aura.

“Huang Xiaolong, the Golden Cymbals King might have lost to you, but we’re no Golden Cymbals King. We might not be a match for you individually, but we’ll crush the Golden Cymbals King if we work together!” The Blood Phoenix Queen sneered. A ray of red light flickered in the space between her eyebrows.

She wasn’t wrong. The two of them might not be as strong as the Golden Cymbals King on their own, but they were frighteningly powerful when they worked together.

The Titan King appeared behind Huang Xiaolong before anyone could react and the Blood Phoenix Queen commenced her attack from the front.

Ninth Void and the others retreated instantly as they were afraid that they would be caught in the crossfire. The battle that was about to take place wasn’t something they could take part in.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive and sighed, “Alright, show me what you got.”

The two of them moved in unison as flames covered the Blood Phoenix Queen’s body. The Titan King locked on to Huang Xiaolong as he charged towards the puny human.

The flames around the Blood Phoenix Queen were different from the divine flames that filled the universe. The flames were red like blood but it didn’t emit any sort of heat.

That was how scary it was. It might not feel hot at all, but the moment her flames came into contact with her target, they would be incinerated to nothingness!

The waves of energy around the Titan King were similar to that. They might seem harmless, but that was because the power was fully contained!

Right before their attacks could arrive, Huang Xiaolong casually swung his hand. A pressure that held the weight of the universe came crashing down on the two of them.
