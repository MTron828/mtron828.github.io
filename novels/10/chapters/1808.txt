As the devil army continuously poured into the world surfaces one after another, astonishing strands of heavenly demonic qi shook the nine heavens as they formed thick clouds that surrounded the Divine World.

Wherever the devil army passed, demonic and ghostly objects in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield would be completely wiped away and devoured.

“That’s...?!”

“What frightening devil qi!”

The faces of the experts cultivating inside the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield changed dramatically as they were shocked by the horrifying devil qi released by the devil army.

Before long, the sea of devil troops entered their sights.

The devil army was endless, and they were like a flock of black locust that caused the world to tremble in its wake.

“It’s... it’s the devils! It’s the devil army!”

“The devils have invaded us!”

Some of the experts who were cultivating yelled in fear as they fled in a panic.

However, the devil troops soon caught up with these experts and swallowed them up without leaving so much as bones.

Miserable screams resounded out in the air.

Two hours passed, and the devil army’s unending stream poured out of the black hole continuously. In less than half a day, they had already occupied dozens of world surfaces near the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!

The dozens of world surfaces outside the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield soon overflowed with the devil army.

The changes in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield’s depths soon alarmed the surrounding world surfaces located around it.

Sects, races, and Emperor Palaces sounded their bells one after another.

The bell resounded out from these sects, as traces of anxiousness, fear, and panic filled the air in the Divine World.

The ancestors who had gone into seclusion were alarmed, and all of them left their secluded cultivation in a hurry.

These bells were only rung when certain sects or races were facing extermination.

“The devil army has invaded the Divine World!”

The news spread across the world surfaces at an astonishing speed.

Everyone felt terror gripping their heart.

One after another, sects started to activate their sect protecting array.

....

In the Fortune Emperor Palace...

At this moment, Zhao Lei, Li Shan, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others had already left the Heavenly Court.

“Earlier, Zhu Yi from the Vientiane Branch received news that the rune sealing the entrance to the Devil World had been broken. The devil army is now flooding into the Divine World as we speak.” Zhao Lei’s expression was grave when he spoke to the others.

The invasion of the devil army was no small matter. Moreover, the Battle of the Heavenly Court had ended recently.

Li Shan, Chen Yirong, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, Fang Mingyu, and everyone else felt their hearts trembling when they heard the news.

“How many devil troops are there?” Li Shan couldn’t help but ask.

Zhao Lei shook his head with uncertainty. “According to the reports, the devil troops have already occupied hundreds of world surfaces outside the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. At this rate, they will be able to occupy all the world surfaces in less than two months!”

Everyone’s faces drastically changed when they heard this.

“They sent so many devil troops this time around!” Fang Xuanxuan’s voice trembled as she said. When the devil army had invaded in the past, they had stopped at several world surfaces.

Chen Yirong shook his head, “When the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe invaded the Divine World that year, the devil troops took the chance to mess about in the chaos!”

“So... are you implying that the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe has a hand in this?!” Li Shan gasped in shock.

Everyone fell into silence, and the atmosphere inside the palace turned heavy.

This sudden change caught everyone off guard. If the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe attacked the Divine World again, it would be no laughing matter. Sects and Families, even Emperor Palaces, would be wiped out of existence.

“Since our Emperor isn’t here, what should we do?!” Chen Yirong asked.

Even though the Battle of the Heavenly Court was over, no one had any idea about Fang Gan’s whereabouts.

“I wonder how Huang Xiaolong is doing now.” Peng Xiao said suddenly.

Without Fang Gan, Huang Xiaolong was now the backbone of the Fortune Emperor Palace.

“Let me try to contact that kid.” Zhao Lei took out his summoning signal and tried contacting Huang Xiaolong. No matter how hard he tried, Huang Xiaolong failed to reply.

“Xiaolong should still be cultivating inside the Heavenly Court’s lightning pools.” Fang Xuanxuan shook her head.

The situation was just like what she described. Huang Xiaolong was absorbing the power contained within the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool. Since he had shut off all his senses, Huang Xiaolong failed to receive the summoning symbol from Zhao Lei. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Another year passed.

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes as he finally finished devouring the power contained within the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool. As he circulated the four chaos lightning pools in the space between his eyebrows, the Golden Dragon, Black Tortoise, Blue Wood, and Black Light Chaos Lightning Pools turned into chaos lightning beasts.

Each of these chaos lightning beasts was in the Eighth Heavenly Monarch Realm, and all of them were more than capable of tearing apart an ordinary Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch expert.

Huang Xiaolong then activated the Four Chaos Lightning Pool Array and turned them into a formidable fighting force.

These were his fruits of labor after studying the art of formations.

His arrays’ proficiency had improved by a lot, and these chaos lightning formations formed from the chaos lightning beasts were more than enough to kill a peak Tenth Order Heavenly Realm expert. Some early-First Order Emperors might even find themselves helpless if Huang Xiaolong set them as his target.

After a while, Huang Xiaolong gradually stopped circulating the formation as he retrieved the power of lightning.

I wonder what Di Jing is doing now.

Ten days ago, after he had finished devouring the Blue Wood Chaos Lightning Pool, he had managed to reach the mid-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. His current strength was no longer comparable to what he had displayed back at the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

He was confident that he could defeat Di Jing by using his Four Chaos Lightning Pool Formation.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but be surprised at the large number of messages he had received. When he scanned through his transmission symbol, he rushed out of the Heavenly Court’s core region as though he had lost his soul.

He had received tons of messages ranging from his master, Zhao Lei, to his senior brother, Jiang Hong. Almost everyone had mentioned something about the invasion of the devil army.

“The devil troops have invaded the area outside of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered.

The invasion of the devil troops must have something to do with the Nine Yine Giant Corpse Tribe. Could they have already refined the Blade of Death? Are they moving forward with their plans to attack the Divine World?

However, Bei Xiaomei’s summoning signal gave him news about Fang Gan’s whereabouts. He was imprisoned in a secret room somewhere in the Fiend God Emperor Palace, as it turned out.

Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated as he charged out with the two odd beasts in tow.
