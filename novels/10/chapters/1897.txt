Everyone was shocked when Huang Xiaolong killed Huo Liucheng.

Some of them even rubbed their eyes as they weren’t able to believe what they saw. The grand prince of the Fire Lightning Violet Python Country was dead! Did he really die in front of them? Did a youngster at the peak of the early-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm kill him?!

Everyone was speechless at the turn of events.

Even Zhao Rou and the experts from the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire turned speechless.

Zhao Rou felt a weird sensation in her heart as she looked at Huo Liucheng’s corpse. Not only was she shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s strength, but she was also angry at the fact that Huang Xiaolong had ignored her request. He had killed Huo Liucheng despite her pleas for mercy.

When they were done, Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing walked back to their spot. Everyone who previously surrounded them had long since run far away.

On the other hand, the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire’s experts rushed over to thaw the ice on Chen Qin’s limbs.

When they finally shattered the ice crystals, they finally realized how terrifying the frigid qi was. It stuck to everyone who tried to help Chen Qin, and it was nearly impossible to get rid of it.

“Chen Qin, are you alright?” Zhao Rou asked Chen Qin with a face full of concern.

Chen Qin nodded his head, “Princess, I am alright.”

He then turned to look at the peak-late Tenth Order Emperor ice dragon that was beside Huang Xiaolong. Fear lingered in his heart when he thought about its strength.

If that had been a life and death battle, he didn’t know if he would have been able to reply to Zhao Rou.

The horror and strength of a single peak-late Tenth Order Emperor ice dragon had far exceeded his imagination.

Suddenly, a huge bell rang, and the ringing resounded throughout the entire Thousand Constellation Mountain Range.

It was the signal that the entrance of the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range was going to open!

The moment the bell rang, everyone who had signed up charged towards the Heavenly Bridge as though they were possessed.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Lu Xiaoqing.

“Yes, young master.”

The two of them left for the Heavenly Bridge.

The three ice dragons suddenly turned into three balls of ice and disappeared.

When people saw Huang Xiaolong walking towards the Heavenly Bridge, everyone who was rushing towards it stopped dead in their tracks. A huge path opened up for Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s face was tranquil as he reached the Heavenly Bridge. With Lu Xiaoqing behind him, he stepped onto the Heavenly Bridge.

Only after a long while did the other disciples rush onto the bridge.

Everyone from the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire protected Zhao Rou as they escorted her onto the Heavenly Bridge.

Even though the Heavenly Bridge had tons of restrictions that stopped one from flying, Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing were extremely quick.

In less than a minute, they reached the end of the Heavenly Bridge. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At the end of the bridge, there was a massive gate. It was precisely the gate to enter the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range.

Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing walked in without hesitation.

The instant they stepped into the mountain range, a breeze blew against them, and the refreshing scent of spiritual herbs washed over them.

The effects of the spiritual herbs in the mountain range were different from normal ones. They brought with them extreme vitality and earth essence.

Looking at the scene before him, Huang Xiaolong saw an endless number of mountain peaks. Trees filled his vision, and they were lush and tall.

Other than the trees, one could also see fields of ginseng.

However, these ginseng outside the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range were pretty ordinary. One could find them in any marketplace in the streets. They were completely useless to Huang Xiaolong, and he continued to head deeper into the mountain range.

Even though the Heavenly Bridge restricted them from flying, the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range did not have such a restriction.

If they weren’t able to fly in the mountain range, no one would bother participating as it was impossible to explore the area by walking.

Some of the ginseng that had developed their spiritual intelligence were great at hiding and escaping from cultivators. Without flying, no one would be able to capture them.

As the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range was going to be open for only ten short days, Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing charged deeper into the mountain range without rest. They needed at least two days to arrive at the deepest part of the mountain range, and there was no time to waste.

Even with their speed, Huang Xiaolong would take two days to arrive at the depths of the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range. There was no need to mention how long other Heavenly Monarchs would take.

Ten days would pass for those ordinary disciples before they could even reach the deepest part of the mountain range.

That was also why in the past millions of years, only two people were able to find the Blood Jasper Ginseng and Dragon King Ginseng.

When Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing were rushing towards the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range’s depths, the death of Huo Liucheng and the fifteen Emperors from the Violet Python Empire spread throughout the entire Kingdom of Devil Beasts and shocked everyone.

When the Violet Python Emperor, Huo Ye, heard the news, he was stupefied.

Two years ago, when Huo Liuyun was injured and captured, several tens of ancestor level figures from the Violet Python Empire were killed. His heart had ached, and the image of tearing Huang Xiaolong into pieces had surfaced in his mind every day. Right now, someone actually had dared to kill fifteen Emperors from the Fire Lightning Violet Empire along with Huo Liucheng.

“Ah!”

Suddenly, the Violet Python Great Emperor, Huo Xuan, roared out madly.

What dog sh*t luck did he step in for his Empire to lose nearly thirty ancestors in the Emperor Realm in two years?!

Even though experts from all thirty-six regions had entered the Kingdom of Devil Beasts in the past two years, they had suffered almost no casualties among their Emperor Realm cultivators. Even though chaos was strife and there were lots of fights, ancestors of other empires hadn’t died! Why did it have to be ancestors of the Violet Python Empire?! Why?!

Huo Xuan repeatedly bellowed as he vented out the berserk, killing intent inside of him.

Inside the main hall, all the ancestors from the Violet Python Country were staring at him in silence.

“Did that brat just enter the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range?” Huo Xuan calmed himself down before asking the ancestors.

“Yes, Your Majesty.” One of the ancestors, Huo Xianghui, answered hurriedly.

“Gather all the ancestors and set off for the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range now!” Huo Xuan’s eyes turned cold as he ordered them.

“Your Majesty, I’m afraid that by the time we reach the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range, that brat would have already escaped.” Huo Xianghui said.

Huo Xuan glowered, “Then contact Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and ask him to activate the array formation around the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range. Trap that brat there! Tell him I will owe him a favor if he does me this favor!”

He knew that the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range was surrounded by a massive formation set up personally by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Once activated, even a peak-late Tenth Order Emperor would be trapped inside.

He was sure that the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor would be more than happy to activate it in exchange for a favor from him.

“Yes, Your Majesty!” Huo Xianghui bowed respectfully.

Very soon, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor received the request from the Violet Python Empire.

“Activate the formation around the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range?” The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor frowned, and a light flickered in his eyes.

“Your Majesty, this...?” One of the ancestors, Jiang Chuchen, from the Heaving Devouring Country couldn’t help but ask.

Jiang Chuchen was one of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s trusted confidants.

Before he could react, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor threw the transmissions symbol over to him.

After looking through it, Jiang Chuchen hesitated for a moment, “What does Your Majesty think?”
