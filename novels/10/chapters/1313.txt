Guo Jun wouldn’t be a man if he didn’t stand up at Huang Xiaolong’s blatant provocation. Not to mention, he would not be worthy to be Feng Yingying’s man!

In Guo Jun’s mind, he had always been Feng Yingying’s man. This thought was also shared by most of the sea tribe’s disciples.

Although it was not a written rule, no sea tribe’s female disciples would ever marry outside the tribe. Not to mention, Guo Jun was the most outstanding man among the younger generation.

Only Guo Jun was worthy of Feng Yingying.

Guo Jun slowly walked towards the battle stage levitating in the air. With every step he took, the pressure he exuded grew stronger, and overwhelming.

Everyone could feel the surrounding air current turning chaotic. Guo Jun was akin to a ferocious beast that was displaying its might.

Guo Jun’s momentum was a thousand times, ten thousand times stronger than the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate Jiang Feng!

As Guo Jun got closer to the stage, a part of his overwhelming pressure specifically targeted Huang Xiaolong, like thousand layers of tsunami.

A faint golden light rippled around Huang Xiaolong, as he stood there unaffected by Guo Jun.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t move even an inch, no matter how strong the pressure from Guo Jun rushed towards him.

All the sea tribe’s disciples watched Guo Jun and Huang Xiaolong with bated breaths, and unblinking stares.

The various sects’ disciples and Sect Chiefs, Patriarchs, and Ancestors subconsciously straightened their backs.

Both Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor seemed calm on the surface, but inwardly, it felt like their hearts were being squeezed by a hand. Both of them could see that Guo Jun’s cultivation was not a mid-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, but a late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm!

Late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm!

On top of that, after taking into account Guo Jun’s talent and bloodline inheritance, one could imagine the high level of his battle power. In short, only a scarce few were Guo Jun’s match below the Ancestor God Realm.

At this moment, Guo Jun finally reached the stage.

The two of them stood face to face on the stage.

A silver sphere of light suddenly appeared above the crown of Guo Jun’s head. It expanded in a split second, and enveloped the entire stage.

Huang Xiaolong felt strong pressure squeezing him within the scope of this silver light.

"Silver Whale’s Space!"

"A rare genius in a hundred million years ah, Guo Jun actually has comprehended the Silver Whale’s space even before breaking through to Ancestor God Realm!”

Praises from sea tribe’s experts could be heard from all directions.

Even the sea tribe’s twelve families’ Grand Elders, and Elders were astonished by Guo Jun.

The Guo Family had inherited the ancient divine beast Silver Whale’s bloodline, a hegemon of the sea. The Silver Whale’s Space was a divine art unique to the Silver Whale that consisted of an astounding power, however, it was very difficult to successfully condense the Silver Whale’s Space.

One of the strict requirements to do so was a high purity of Silver Whale’s bloodline, at least seventy percent bloodline purity, and another requirement was reaching the tenth stage of the Silver Whale Scripture, the Guo Family’s heritage cultivation technique.

Although there were more than a few of the Guo Family members who could form the Silver Whale’s Space. For the past ten million years, there hadn’t been a Guo Family’s disciple who had successfully condensed the Silver Whale’s Space before entering the Ancestor God Realm.

Hence, this was the reason behind the sea tribe’s experts’ astonishment.

But once a Guo Family’s disciple could comprehend and start condensing the Silver Whale’s Space, it would become proportionally stronger, as their cultivation would rise. Furthermore, the earlier one could start condensing the Silver Whale’s Space, the higher would be their growth potential.

On the Sea God’s throne, Feng Yingying’s gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong the whole time, as she thought inwardly, ‘How many moves can this little guy take from Guo Jun? Ten, perhaps?’

As the number one genius of the Feng Family, she had a good understanding of the power of the Guo Family’s Silver Whale’s Space.

The Guo Family’s Ancestor was acknowledged as the second strongest person in the sea tribe, due to his Silver Whale’s Space.

Guo Jun listened to the praises and exclamations from the crowd as he looked callously at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Perhaps you have not heard about my Guo Family’s Silver Whale’s Space, therefore, you seem to be ignorant of the Silver Whale’s Space’s power, but it doesn’t matter. Soon, you will experience it for yourself.”

Huang Xiaolong retorted with a deadpan face, “Is that so?”

Guo Jun was not angered by Huang Xiaolong’s expression. Instead, he chuckled softly, “Within my Silver Whale’s Space, even a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator would be suppressed by me, the lower their strengths as compared to mine, the more severe the suppression felt by them. A Ninth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator probably would be able to use only half of his strength, when under the influence of my Silver Whale’s Space.”

A Ninth Order Ancient God Realm could probably exert only half of their strength! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Those in the crowd who were unaware of the Silver Whale’s Space whispered to their companions in shock.

“If that’s true, doesn’t that mean Huang Xiaolong will be able to use less than half of his true strength?”

“Fifty percent strength? Did you hear that clearly? A Ninth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator might be able to use only half of his strength? But then Huang Xiaolong is only a peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. In that case, I would say he might be able to exert only twenty percent of his strength!”

“Two-tenths?! How is he going to battle Guo Jun then? Even if Huang Xiaolong would have been able exert his full strength, he still wouldn’t have been Guo Jun’s match. Considering this he probably might just last through only half a strike!”

“Guo Jun can squash him to death with a press of his palm in the air.”

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s faces turned increasingly ugly listening to the discussions around them.

Wangu Clan’s Patriarch Wangu Rui shook his head in lament, “What a pity!” Even though he hated Huang Xiaolong because Huang Xiaolong had heavily injured Wangu Ziyi in the past as well as made the Wangu Clan’s reputation to drop from the top to bottom, Huang Xiaolong was a human race’s disciple at the end of the day. Now that he was on the verge of being crippled by Guo Jun, Wangu Rui was pitying Huang Xiaolong.

Wangu Ziyi sneered coldly, he was looking forward to this very scene where Guo Jun would destroy Huang Xiaolong.

Wangu Ziyi’s anticipation and gloating were shared by Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Li Zhu, Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s Zhu Feng and Wang Wei.

As the whispers continued, Guo Jun’s right fist punched out at Huang Xiaolong.

Strong silver light enshrouded his right fist, eclipsing other colors on the stage.

This was the unique Silver Whale godforce, that was successfully condense by Guo Jun inside the Silver Whale’s Space. The Silver Whale’s Space didn’t only compound the force of Guo Jun’s attack, but it could also generate heavy gravity to weaken the opponent’s attack power.

It seemed like Huang Xiaolong didn’t have any intention to dodge Guo Jun’s attack, as he stood calmly watching Guo Jun’s fist coming at him. Inwardly, he circulated his three supreme godheads’ godforce to his whole body.

He was curious to know how strong his current True Dragon Physique was.

Bang!

A loud bang rang in the air. Through the crowd’s eyes, it looked like Huang Xiaolong had ‘failed’ to dodge Guo Jun’s in time, as he had just stood there and was accurately punched by Guo Jun.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s hands clenched nervously.

Looking at this outcome, all of Huang Xiaolong’s ill-wishers smiled with great satisfaction. There were none other than Wangu Ziyi, Li Zhi, Zhu Feng, Wang Wei, Guo Family, and the rest of the sea tribe, as well as the Golden Phoenix Pavilion and the Blood Imperial Sect.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure staggered back until the edge of the stage. Seeing that he was about to fall off of the stage, he stopped himself with ease and stood there firmly. Naturally, this was completely unexpected for all of the viewers.

The crowd blanked for a second at this sight.

Huang Xiaolong patted off the dust from his body, where Guo Jun’s punch had landed. He stretched his neck to loosen his muscles, and said, “Thank you for helping me loosen some muscles. Your punch is quite relaxing.”

What?!

Quite relaxing!

Punched by Guo Jun was... quite relaxing?!

Everyone reacted, beyond shock. Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi, Guo Family’s Ancestor, and other families’ Patriarchs and Ancestors, Grand Elders, and Elders exchanged a doubtful look.

At this time, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were frozen in shock.

Feng Yingying’s small cherry lips were slightly agape in disbelief.
