Inside the Zhang Family Manor’s great hall, the Zhang Family Patriarch Zhang Dongbi’s face was horrifyingly somber, a monstrous killing intent gathered around him in chilling silence.

Staring at the pile of gray ash before him, Zhang Dongbi’s body trembled visibly. This pile of gray ash was his son? The son he doted on the most, Zhang Han?!

Not only was his son murdered, there wasn’t even a corpse remaining, only a pile of ash! Sorrowful pain and vengeance swirled in his eyes.

His gaze suddenly raised from the pile of gray ash to Zhang Hao. Zhang Dongbi’s voice was extremely cold: “Didn’t I instruct you to look after Zhang Han?! When did he leave the back mountain? Why would he go to the land of new moon? How did he die?!!!” By the end, Zhang Dongbi was roaring at Zhang Hao, his face twisted with pain and fury.

Just as Zhang Hao was about to explain, Zhang Dongbi’s palm struck him, knocking him into the air. Zhang Hao’s body crashed into the great hall’s doors.

The other Zhang Family experts present in the great hall shuddered, no one dared to speak.

“If it weren’t for your loyalty and contribution to the Zhang Family all these years, I would have killed you with that palm!” Zhang Dongbi’s voice was chilling, devoid of any emotion. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Zhang Hao hastily kowtowed in gratitude.

Zhang Dongbi spoke softly to the pile of gray ash, “Han’er, don’t worry, no matter who it was, Father will kill him to avenge you! I will send all of them down to accompany you, so that you won’t feel lonely on the journey to the underworld!”

“Patriarch, we, should we report this matter to the Ancestor?” Zhang Hao asked, he couldn’t stop himself from doing so, after all, this matter involved the land of new moon.

Who was the owner of the land of new moon, all the higher echelon of the Zhang Family knew very well.

Crazy Lady Yang Yi!

A Highgod Realm master!

Regardless which super forces, once something involved Highgod Realm masters, the matter had to be treated with caution.

“No need!” Zhang Dongbi answered coldly, “The Ancestor is in death seclusion, in preparation for the next term’s God Ranking List Battle. Such a small thing, you need not disturb the Ancestor!”

Hearing this, Zhang Hao dared not speak further.

It didn’t take long for the news to spread that the Zhang Family’s Young Lord had been murdered in the Wintry North World, shaking the entire world surface.

There was actually someone that dared to kill the Zhang Family’s Young Lord Zhang Han in the Wintry North World. Immediately, various versions of the incident circulated.

As for the Zhang Family, all of its top experts were sent out to lock down all cities, even other planets in proximity to the Wintry North World as they went through these places with a fine tooth comb to locate Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei.

Even with the Zhang Family experts going all out searching for both of them, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei avoided being found out, leaving the Wintry North World without anyone realizing and heading to the Tanggu World’s transmission array.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong finally understood the whole story after listening to Shi Xiaofei.

Several days ago, the Vermillion Bird’s He Feifan once again came to visit Shi Xiaofei’s Master, Yang Yi. Although Shi Xiaofei didn’t know the reason, her Master followed He Feifan and both of them left the land of new moon. Before departing, Yang Yi told Shi Xiaofei that she would be away for two months, instructing Shi Xiaofei to focus on her cultivation in the land of new moon and await her return.

This was half a month ago. Who knows where that Zhang Han found out that Yang Yi left, thus he led a group of Zhang Family experts over to the land of new moon.

Shi Xiaofei’s several guards and maids were all killed by the Zhang Family’s experts. If it weren’t for Huang Xiaolong arriving in time, Shi Xiaofei would have probably ended up dead just like them, perhaps even worse!

When recounting about those guards and maids being killed, Shi Xiaofei’s small face showed great pain. All these years she was in the land of new moon, her relationship with them was extremely good, her maids were like sisters to her.

Huang Xiaolong held her close, neither one spoke.

“Xiaolong, with Zhang Han dead, the Zhang Family won’t let this matter go.” A short while later, Shi Xiaofei said, lines of worry on her forehead.

Although she was more than happy that Huang Xiaolong killed Zhang Han, she was worried about the Zhang Family’s retaliation.

“Don’t worry, it’ll be alright.” Huang Xiaolong reassured her. Though killing Zhang Han would bring some trouble, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t too bothered by this. He didn’t even put the Jiang Family in his eyes, what more the Zhang Family. In terms of power, the Zhang Family was way worse compared to the Jiang Family.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong believed that after finding out his identity, the Zhang Family would choose to keep silent about it.

“When did you breakthrough to God Realm?” Huang Xiaolong changed the topic, asking Shi Xiaofei.

He had noticed before this that Shi Xiaofei had broken through to God Realm. Moreover, it was not early First God Realm, but mid-First Order God Realm!

At Huang Xiaolong’s question, Shi Xiaofei revealed a complacent smirk, “I already broke through to God Realm two years ago. How about it? Amazing right? My Moon Summoning Rhyme already reached the mid-third stage, hum!”

Two years ago!

Hearing that Shi Xiaofei broke through to God Realm two years ago, even reaching the mid-third stage of the Moon Summoning Rhyme, Huang Xiaolong was slightly surprised. According to normal cultivation progress rate, it was impossible for Shi Xiaofei to break through to God Realm so early, not to mention reaching the mid-third stage of Moon Summoning Rhyme.

Did Shi Xiaofei run into some fortuitous encounter?

As expected, Shi Xiaofei went to tell Huang Xiaolong about the time several years ago. One time, when she went out, she found a congenital ice element spiritual treasure in a cold pond. Borrowing that congenital ice element spiritual treasure, her cultivation rose rapidly, breaking through to mid-First Order God Realm and reached the mid-third stage of the Moon Summoning Rhyme, which had awakened her Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique.

Huang Xiaolong was more than happy at this news. With Shi Xiaofei’s Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique awakened, and with the support of the Golden Dragon Peak’s rich spiritual energy, her cultivation would progress by leaps and bounds. There was hope for her to break through to Highgod Realm!

At that time, Huang Xiaolong would be able to ascend to the Divine World together with Shi Xiaofei.

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei both safely reached the Golden Dragon Peak, and as Huang Xiaolong had predicted earlier, the Zhang Family suppressed the news, ceasing all movement.

No doubt, the Huang Family and everyone on the Golden Dragon Peak was happy to see Shi Xiaofei again. The Golden Dragon Peak was brimming with cheers and laughter with her return.

Huang Min and a few others even clamored, insisting that Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei have their wedding day, causing Shi Xiaofei to blush nonstop the whole day.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had his own plans in regards to their wedding. He decided to hold the wedding after the Highgod Advancement Tournament. The day he would break through to Highgod Realm would be his and Shi Xiaofei’s wedding day.

At that time, Huang Xiaolong would hold the grandest wedding in the entire galaxy!

Back on the Golden Dragon Peak, Huang Xiaolong spent his day with his family and Shi Xiaofei, occasionally practicing his alchemy or battle skills, whereas at night, he would swallow the Three Revolutions Golden Pills and cultivate.

There were five years left until the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition. In these five years, Huang Xiaolong was confident that his refining skills would improve considerably.

He and Shi Xiaofei weren’t worried about Yang Yi. When she returned to the land of new moon and found out what happened, she would definitely come to the Black Warrior Institute.

Time flowed by, and very quickly two months passed.

What roused Huang Xiaolong’s doubt was that even after two months, Shi Xiaofei’s Master Yang Yi had yet to appear.

Another month passed. Yet, Yang Yi had yet to appear.

“Could something have happened to Master?” Shi Xiaofei asked, worried.

Logically, once her Master was back in the land of new moon, she would immediately rush over to the Black Warrior Institute after finding out what happened. But, until now, her Master still hadn’t appeared, could it be that her Master hadn’t returned to the land of new moon even now?!
