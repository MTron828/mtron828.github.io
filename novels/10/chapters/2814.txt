Chapter 2815: Looking for the Dragon Scale!

The moment he noticed the traces of the Huang Long Bloodline, he no longer bothered with the Saint Devil Prince. Following the trail, Huang Xiaolong left the Brilliant Light Island, and soon arrived at one of the smaller islands around it.

Releasing his dao souls, he covered the entire island in an instant.

He could feel his bloodline resonating strongly with one of the mountain ranges in the southern part of the island.

It could only mean one thing.

Huang Xiaolong was more than ninety percent sure that the dragon scale was located on the island!

With a look of joy flashing through his eyes, he sped towards the mountain ranges on the southern part of the island.

The closer he got, the more intense was the reaction between his bloodline and the dragon scale.

Huang Xiaolong had a faint feeling that the dragon scale was located in one of the highest peaks along the mountain range, but when he approached his target, a group of people could be seen charging towards the same mountain range.

“Lay down the Fantasy Sea Formation! Do not allow the Jade Infant Ginseng to escape!” A young man turned to speak to the crowd behind him.

The Jade Infant Ginseng was a treasure that was rarely seen in the world! Even though it wasn’t a priceless treasure, it was worth much more money than a Silver Dragon Fish. A fully matured Jade Infant Ginseng was pretty much something all sacred lands would fight over.

From the looks of it, the group was there to capture a piece of Jade Infant Ginseng they had found in the mountain range.

When the group discovered Huang Xiaolong, they were taken aback for a moment.

However, Huang Xiaolong ignored the bunch of cultivators who just arrived as he was looking for the dragon scale. The value of the two items couldn’t even be compared to each other. As for the Jade Infant Ginseng, it was just a herb he could purchase by throwing copious amounts of cash.

However, the young man appeared before him before Huang Xiaolong could continue his search.

“Did you hear what I just said?” He glared at Huang Xiaolong.

“No shit…”

“Since you heard what I said, you can’t leave anymore.” The young man sneered.

As the group of people rushed over, they sealed off all of Huang Xiaolong’s ‘escape routes’. Their auras locked on to Huang Xiaolong and they were prepared to silence the man!

Sweeping his gaze across everyone present, Huang Xiaolong spoke casually, “What if I insist on leaving?”

Huang Xiaolong gained a pretty good understanding of the powers in the regions controlled by the Blue Heaven Dao Creed.

Looking at the group of cultivators who were standing before him, Huang Xiaolong felt like they hailed from the second-ranked power in the Devil Wolf Heavenly Cave. Their patriarch was a half-step Dao Venerable, weaker than Fu Daosheng. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The young man snorted in contempt when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Don’t even think about doing anything funny. Otherwise, you’ll have to suffer a whole bunch at our hands. Cultivating to the Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm is a feat in itself. You wouldn’t want to die for nothing, would you?”

“Stay here quietly, and we might just let you leave after we obtain the ginseng.”

The connection between the dragon scale started to grow weaker all of a sudden, and Huang Xiaolong could clearly feel the change.

The dragon scale was trying to run away!

Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of anxiousness rising in his heart, and a cold gaze flashed through his eyes. “I’m only going to say this once. I have no interest in whatever ginseng you’re hunting for. If you refuse to get out of my way, I’ll kill everyone here!”

The members of the Devil Transformation Sacred Land were stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden outburst.

However, the young man in the lead soon burst out laughing. “Brat, are you asking us to scram?!” A wave of killing intent emerged from his body, and he growled, “Since you don’t know what’s good for you, you won’t have to leave today!”

He shot the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor around him a glance, and he instantly understood his meaning.

Walking towards Huang Xiaolong, the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor knew what he had to do, but before he could come close, Huang Xiaolong’s body flashed, and he smashed the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor into a rain of blood.

The young man taking the lead might have been an early-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and he looked like an important core disciple in the Devil Transformation Sacred Land. However, that didn’t allow him to escape Huang Xiaolong’s wrath.

After dealing with the two of them, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about the rest as he tore through the space to chase after the escaping dragon scale.

The remaining Primal Ancestors from the Devil Transformation Sacred Land stared at the corpses of the two before turning to the golden mist that formed around them. None of them could react quickly enough.

A Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor had turned a Fourth Resurrection and Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor into mush before their eyes with a single punch!

Is that something someone at that level can do?!

Not to mention the fact that he had turned around and left the moment he was done.

“Junior Brother Xie Chang!”

“Senior Brother Xie Chang!”

By the time they snapped back to reality, Huang Xiaolong was long gone. Their expressions changed as they screamed for their two deceased disciples.

The young man who was leading them was the direct disciple of the grand palace master of the Devil Transformation Sacred Land, and he was also one of the grand elders of the enforcement hall!

“Chase him down!”

“Kill that b*stard!”

An Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm expert screamed as he tore through the space to follow behind Huang Xiaolong.

Staring at each other, no one was in the mood to capture the ginseng any longer as they followed behind him.

…

When Huang Xiaolong just started the chase, he could feel the aura of the dragon scale growing weaker and weaker. No one knew why, but the dragon scale seemed to be accelerating and Huang Xiaolong soon lost track of it.

When he felt the auras of those chasing him, a frown formed on his face. It seemed as though they wouldn’t stop unless he dealt with all of them once and for all.

After a short moment of consideration, he stopped to wait for them. Killing all of them wouldn’t take long, and since he had the Huang Long Bloodline, the dragon scale wouldn’t be able to hide from him forever.

Very quickly, those in pursuit caught up to him.

“Brat, are you tired of living?! Which sacred land do you come from? How dare you kill the personal disciple of my Devil Transformation Sacred Land’s grand hall master?” the Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor raged when he finally caught up.

Refusing to waste a single second speaking to them, he welcomed them with a punch.

When the Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor realized what Huang Xiaolong was doing, he was stunned for a second. However, a sinister smile soon formed on his face. “Brat, go to hell!”

He sent out a punch of his own.

Boundless devilish energy emerged from his body and there was a trace of radiance energy contained within.

The Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor unleashed the Devil Transformation Grand Art, and one could only cultivate the technique when they devoured the purest radiance energy after reaching a grand completion in the devil arts. When the two powers were used in unison, the power behind the strike was shocking!

When Huang Xiaolong and the members of the Devil Transformation Sacred Land were exchanging blows, another group led by the Saint Devil Prince made its way towards them!
