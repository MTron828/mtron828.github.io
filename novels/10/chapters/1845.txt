Whoever spoke about Chen Weijian couldn’t help but feel a little more solemn.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the serious look on Gao Changran’s face, he couldn’t help but laugh. He replied casually. “I already know.”

Seeing the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, Gao Changran snapped back to reality. He knew that he was too quick to judge Chen Weijian, and he had forgotten Huang Xiaolong’s true identity.

Who cared if Chen Weijian was the number one genius in the Devil World? He was nothing but dust when compared to Huang Xiaolong.

The two of them weren’t even standing at the same height, to begin with.

“Lord, I failed to compose myself...” Gao Changran lowered his head and apologized to Huang Xiaolong.

“It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and dismissed Gao Changran’s concerns.

When Huang Xiaolong was chatting with Gao Changran, Chen Weijian looked at all the ancestors in the same room as him. They all had their mouths open in shock. He nodded his head contentedly.

“It seems like I was right. That brat has brought only two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones with him.” Elder Long was the first to recover, and he chuckled in amusement.

When Chen Weijian yelled out his bid, Huang Xiaolong followed everyone else as he remained silent.

In the eyes of the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong’s pockets had run dry.

“Even the members of the Heavenly Punishment Sect can’t take out more than two hundred million... I don’t even think this brat has more than a hundred million on him right now. His last bid was probably his bottom line!” Another one of the ancestors sneered as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “This time, our Hundred Transformation Sect will definitely obtain the Devil Holy Water!”

“With these hundred drops of Devil Holy Water, our old ancestor will definitely be able to enter the Sovereign Realm in the next hundred years!”

The sixteenth suite’s ancestors laughed and joked as though they had already obtained the Devil Holy Water.

This time, even though they knew that the Heavenly Punishment Sect had managed to move two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones, they weren’t idling around. They had sold a ton of treasures beforehand, and they had absolute confidence to suppress the Heavenly Punishment Sect in terms of wealth.

As such, they were more than sure that the bottle of Devil Holy Water had already fallen into their hands.

“One hundred and forty million.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice broke their fantasy.

One hundred and forty million!

“WHAT?!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The ancestors who were laughing and mocking Huang Xiaolong felt their faces freezing in place. Even Chen Weijian’s body stiffened.

In suite One, a look of terror flashed through Xing Yinuo’s eyes.

Even the Archdevil Ancestors present couldn’t help but display a shocked expression when they heard his bid.

How in the world does that brat have so many low-grade chaos spirit stones?!

“This... How is this possible?!” Elder Long of the Hundred Transformation Sect regained his senses and yelled in shock.

Doesn’t this mean that the black-haired man has more spirit stones than the Heavenly Punishment Sect?!

Chen Weijian also managed to regain his senses, and he felt as though someone had slapped him viciously in front of the crowd.

“One hundred and fifty million!” Chen Weijian wasn’t willing to back down.

That was one hundred and fifty million low-grade chaos spirit stones they were talking about!

Everyone felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

When Huang Xiaolong heard Chen Weijian’s cold voice that was full of provocation, he chuckled. “One hundred and sixty million.”

Huang Xiaolong would be able to refine low-grade chaos spirit stones after breaking through Emperor Realm. When that happened, the thing Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t lack would be low-grade chaos spirit stones.

“One hundred and seventy million!” Another voice broke the battle between the two.

The sweet voice that entered their ears could only belong to one person, Xing Yinuo.

“One hundred and seventy-one million!” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s voice boomed through the hall, and no one could miss the rage, and tyrannical might hidden behind his bid.

It was clear that the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor had reached his limit.

“One hundred and eighty million.” Chen Weijian raised the bid again.

The moment the words left his lips, a cold harrumph erupted from the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s suite, and it was like a bomb that went off in the hall.

Everyone jumped in shock.

“Two hundred and ten million.” Huang Xiaolong calmly raised the price again.

According to what Gao Changran gathered, the Heavenly Punishment Sect had brought about two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones. The Hundred Transformation Sect had brought a little more, but it was negligible. Huang Xiaolong didn’t have the patience to play with them anymore, and he instantly increased the bid to a level none of them could reach.

The sound of someone falling reverberated through the hall.

“WHAT?!” Chen Weijian shot to his feet, and his expression turned extremely ugly.

All the ancestors of the Hundred Transformation Sect leaped up in fright.

The reaction of Xing Yinuo and the other ancestors from the Heavenly Punishment Sect wasn’t too different.

The two Archdevil Ancestors present revealed a terrifying light in their eyes.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong instantly became the center of attention, and the experts seated next to him retreated in fear.

Xing Yinuo lost her voice, and so did all the ancestors around her.

The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate was dumbfounded, and the sect master of the Black Killer Sect nearly lost his mind.

“Why is someone not verifying whether or not he has the funds to pay?!” One of the ancestors from the Heavenly Punishment Sect screamed.

However, no one seemed to have heard him, and none of them reacted.

Time seemed to slow to a crawl.

Chen Weijian exhaled a long breath, and he gritted his teeth to yell out his final bid. “Two hundred and twelve million!”

That was the absolute limit of what he could afford.

Of course, that was all the movable funds the Hundred Transformation Sect could take out.

“Two hundred and thirteen million.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate at all as he called out the winning bid.

Chen Weijian clenched his fist in rage, and a monstrous killing intent welled up in his eyes. However, his body seemed to have lost all strength as he fell back into his chair in the next moment.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong purchased the Devil Holy Water with two hundred and thirteen million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong handing over the payment, mountains and mountains of chaos spirit stones piled on each other, and the sound of saliva being swallowed could be heard throughout the hall.

After receiving the spirit stones, the auction manager handed the bottle of Devil Holy Water over to Huang Xiaolong personally.

After ensuring that there were no problems, Huang Xiaolong kept the bottle.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong causally got up from his seat and brought his group out of the hall. No one other than him moved, and all of them watched as he disappeared into the distance.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappearing, the same thought flashed through everyone’s mind.

“Young master, do we...” Elder Long of the Hundred Transformation Sect asked, and he drew a line across his neck.

Even though they were here for the two Devil Steles and didn’t wish to clash with other superpowers before achieving their goal, the bottle of Devil Holy Water held the same level of importance as the two Devil Steles. If they could kill Huang Xiaolong and snatch the Devil Holy Water, it would be a worthy sacrifice no matter how many men died in the process.

“Let’s return before making a decision.” Chen Weijian got to his feet, and he thought about his next course of action. “The Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor should be arriving in Eternal Devil City tomorrow. I will personally greet him.”

“Yes, young master!”

Elder Long immediately saw through the meaning behind his words.

Even before Huang Xiaolong arrived back at his courtyard, the news of him spending two hundred and thirteen million on the bottle of Devil Holy Water spread across the Eternal Devil City like wildfire.
