Chapter 3027: Just Rob Him

When Zhou Hong looked at their leaving figure, his face was scrunched up into a ball from the pain Lei Yu had inflicted onto him.

As for Chen Shuanghe, his clothes were drenched in a cold sweat. If Zhou Hong, their patriarch, was treated like a misbehaving kid before Lei Yu, what was he considered?! Even if he used his toes to think, he would realize that the identities of the two people he was trying to arrest were things he couldn’t hope to uncover!

Impersonating disciples of the Leiyu Creed?! Was there a need for them to do that when Zhou Hong ran all the way out there to receive a beating?!

The more he thought about it, the colder his heart became. He glared at the members of the Scarlet Blood Clan, and he wanted nothing more than to tear them limb from limb.

When Chen Yang and the others noticed his gaze, they were terrified.

The Dao Venerables who had appeared at the end of the exchange approached Zhou Hong cautiously and asked, “Patriarch, they…”

“There’s no use asking.” Zhou Hong sighed. “You will know when the time comes.”

One of the mid-Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable stared at Lei Yu’s leaving figure, and he frowned. He could be considered a senior in the Leiyu Creed. When Lei Yu had left the Creed in the past, he was like Zhou Hong, and he had barely entered the First Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

He felt as though a lightning bolt ran through his entire body when he discovered the truth.

“No one is allowed to speak about the matter that happened today.” A solemn expression appeared on Zhou Hong’s face and he growled, “Anyone who leaks the news will be executed as a traitor to the creed!”

Everyone felt their hearts skipping a beat when Zhou Hong looked into their eyes.

When Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu finally returned to their courtyard, their daily routine remained the same. Huang Xiaolong sparred with Lei Yu during the day. In the past, he would use six different types of energies, but everything changed after he comprehended the power of radiance. The number of powers he used against Lei Yu increased by one, and his combat abilities became even stronger than before. In the night, he would refine the Phoenix Fire Crystals under the Parasol Tree to comprehend the power of nirvana. Absolute beginning qi would nourish his body in the process.

At the same time, more than a thousand high-level Dao Venerables were tempering the Sun Moon Furnace with their cosmos energy. The cosmos energy they produced would seep into Huang Xiaolong’s body occasionally, and they would strengthen all three worlds in him.

Even though his Body of Heaven and Earth was already at the grand completion stage and his three small words were at the perfection level, he still benefited from the process.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

Lei Yu’s second and third disciple returned to the Leiyu Creed, and they were speaking to Zhou Hong.

“Fourth Junior Brother, did something happen? Why are you so anxious for us to return?” Tan Hua, Lei Yu’s second disciple, stared at Zhou Hong doubtfully.

Since Lei Yu had specifically commanded him to keep the news of his return a secret, Zhou Hong didn’t dare to breathe a word about it. Not even his senior brothers knew about the matter. He only requested for them to return as quickly as they could after the ceremony.

“Did you receive news about Eldest Senior Brother?!” Sui Hengyi, Lei Yu’s third disciple, asked.

The two of them made guesses along their way back, and they felt that Zhou Hong’s impatience definitely had something to do with their senior brother.

A crafty smile formed on Zhou Hong’s face all of a sudden and he chuckled softly, “Let’s go! Someone’s waiting to see you two!”

Under their suspicious gaze, Zhou Hong brought the two towards Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard.

Even though Lei Yu had hidden his aura, and he had transformed his body to look like an ordinary three-headed beast, Tan Hua and Sun Hengyi recognized him immediately. Their eyes nearly popped out from their sockets as they failed to hide their excitement. They acted like Zhou Hong when he had seen Lei Yu again, and they got to their knees with tears dripping down their faces. “Master!”

Tan Hua, his second disciple, cried the loudest.

Seeing his disciples embarrassing themselves before Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu couldn’t contain the shame in his heart as he smacked Tan Hua on the head. “Enough! Are you a sissy? I’m not dead yet! There’s no need to cry as though you’re attending my funeral!” Pointing towards Huang Xiaolong, he snapped, “Get over here and pay your respects to His Highness.”

“His Highness?” Tan Hua and Sui Hengyi raised their heads slowly to stare at Huang Xiaolong. However, none of them said anything.

With his claws descended on their heads once again, Lei Yu snapped, “Are you deaf?!”

Zhou Hong stook at the side while he doubled over with laughter.

When his senior brothers weren’t here, he had to endure Lei Yu’s beating all by himself. Now that they were back, they could join in the fun.

With bitter looks on their faces, Tan Hua and Sui Hengyi bowed respectfully.

Allowing them to stand, Huang Xiaolong started to ask about the matter of the peak-grade Phoenix Fire Crystal.

The two of them weren’t stupid. They knew that Huang Xiaolong was extremely interested in the item as it was the first thing he spoke about as soon as he met them. They told him everything they knew without leaving out the slightest detail.

“Fist-sized?!” Huang Xiaolong was slightly disappointed when he heard that the crystal was only the size of a fist.

Phoenix Fire Crystals were split into different grades. Naturally, the bigger ones were more valuable.

Now that he was only a tiny step away from reaching the grand completion stage in the power of nirvana, a fist-sized Phoenix Fire Crystal wasn’t going to cut it!

A crafty smile formed on Lei Yu’s face all of a sudden. “Your Highness, why don’t we buy the crystal in the auction before paying the Cloud Wind Dao Venerable a visit? He definitely has more in his possession, and we’ll just rob him clean!”

Tan Hua, Sui Hengyi, and Zhou Hong felt beads of cold sweat dripping down their foreheads when they heard the conversation between the two. The number of people who dared to rob the Cloud Wind Dao Venerable could probably be counted on both hands!

“Master, Cloud Wind Dao Venerable reached perfection level in both the powers of wind and earth…” Afraid Lei Yu would be mistaken about the old man’s strength, Tan Hua quickly tried to persuade him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He received a smack across the face in response. “No sh*t! Do you think I’m weaker than that old fart?”

Holding his face in pain, Tan Hua could only force a smile. “No, no, no! Master is the strongest! I wouldn’t dare think that the Cloud Wind Dao Venerable would be able to defeat you in battle!”

Sweeping his gaze across the three, Lei Yu muttered, “There’s nothing to worry about. Even if the old man reached the grand completion stage in both the powers of wind and earth, I’m capable of taking him down.”

His disciples revealed a joyous look, and Sui Hengyi asked, “Master, did you…”

“That’s right. I reached tperfection level in the power of lightning.” Lei Yu laughed with a smug expression on his face. The Cloud Wind Dao Venerable might have reached the grand completion stage in the powers of wind and earth, but they were ranked at the bottom in terms of strength among all thirteen types of energies.

The power of lightning was ranked seventh.

The divide between the powers was like the gap between the heavens and earth!

Of course, Lei Yu also wielded the power of absolute blaze and radiance at the major completion level.

Hearing that their master had managed to comprehend the power of lightning to perfection level, they felt excitement bubbling in their hearts.

“Congratulations!”

Nodding slightly, Lei Yu knew that his disciples would be motivated to try their best after learning about his achievements.

“We no longer need to be afraid of the Nine Vision Creed and the Devil Curse Creed! Hahaha!” Sui Hengyi roared with laughter.

The Leiyu Creed might have been developing smoothly in the past years, but pressure from other Creed was building. The Nine Vision and Devil Curse Creeds were their main competitors in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave!
