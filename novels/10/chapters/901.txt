A powerful suction force pulled Qin Yi, who had reached Beitang Yiyang’s side, in front of Huang Xiaolong.

In the four galaxies, Qin Yi was considered one of the more powerful people with his cultivation realm of peak mid-Third Order Highgod Realm, but in front of Huang Xiaolong, his struggle was powerless.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t kill me...” Qin Yi’s bloodless face was distorted due to fear, pleading for his life.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were void of any emotion, “Don’t worry. I’ve already said that, for the sake of those one hundred giant redwood coffins, I will leave you with an intact corpse.” With that said, Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Supreme Godhead rotated, releasing streams of devouring power.

The Beitang Family’s masters watched from the side as Qin Yi’s body shrunk and dried up at a rapid pace. Within two breaths’ time, he had completely turned into a dried corpse.

Huang Xiaolong’s fingers loosened his grip and Qin Yi’s corpse fell to the ground.

Watching this, the Beitang Family masters were astounded and a little frightened.

Dried corpse!

Qin Yi was sucked into a dried corpse by Huang Xiaolong! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Then what Qin Yi claimed earlier...?!

A strong ominous feeling rose in the hearts of Beitang Yiyang and the Beitang Family masters. However, right at this time, a brilliant light shone from Huang Xiaolong’s body, who transformed into a primordial divine dragon with his claws stretched out, slamming down on Beitang Yiyang.

Huang Xiaolong’s speed was too fast. It happened so quickly that Beitang Yiyang barely had time to react, even less the time to dodge, and was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw.

“Patriarch!” The surrounding Beitang Family masters cried out.

With a slight sway of his draconic body, Huang Xiaolong once again arrived above Beitang Yiyang, his dragon claw striking out again.

A great rumble sounded from the earth as Beitang Yiyang’s body was embedded into the ground as a result of Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

Only then did the Beitang Family masters react, throwing words of anger and hollering as they swarmed toward Huang Xiaolong in retaliation.

Watching these people attacking him together, Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly and rushed into their midst instead of dodging.

In an instant, blood-curdling wails filled the air.

Huang Xiaolong resembled a hungry tiger that ran into a herd of sheep.

Every swipe of his claws drew blood from tens of Beitang Family’s masters and sent twice as many of them flying.

In a short few breaths’ time, only half of Beitang Family cultivators remained standing.

The Azure Dragon Institute’s Grand Elders, including Ceng Chu, lost half of their soul watching this and no longer wanted to stay even a second longer. They flew off in different directions for a chance at life.

But after running for barely a moment, they noticed an overwhelming suction force pulling at them them. In the next second, their bodies flew backwards.

Following that, their blood essence and godforce started rushing out from their bodies, out of their control.

No matter how fiercely they struggled, how they screamed and wailed, or how they begged for mercy, it was useless.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong turned Ceng Chu and all the other Azure Dragon Institute masters into nothing more than dried corpses.

...

A quarter of an hour later.

All Beitang Family masters were now injured, knocked away by Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at the surrounding pits in the ground with half protruding body parts, Huang Xiaolong first arrived above Beitang Yiyang in a flicker.

With a slight clawing motion, Beitang Yiyang was pulled into Huang Xiaolong’s hand from a deep pit. But Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to kill him.

Yelu Chufei had to die. Beitang Yiyang, on the other hand, could die, but he could also be spared.

Huang Xiaolong decided to give this Beitang Yiyang a chance. If the man was willing to submit to him, then he wouldn’t mind receiving him as a follower. After all, controlling the Beitang Family was a means of expanding his forces, which was a more favorable result compared to exterminating them.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong woke the unconscious Beitang Yiyang. However, when he heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted him to submit, Beitang Yiyang sneered disdainfully, “What a joke, you want my Beitang Family to submit to you? Huang Xiaolong, don’t dream about it!”

Hearing this reply, Huang Xiaolong shook his head in pity. Without another word, his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power ran at full force, causing Beitang Yiyang’s blood essence and godforce to rush out uncontrollably from his body and godhead.

His eyes widened in fear and tried to say something, but to his dismay, he couldn’t utter a word.

In less than a second, Beitang Yiyang turned into a dried corpse.

Huang Xiaolong’s godforce quivered, shattering Beitang Yiyang corpse into dust, disappearing from the world.

The wounded Beitang Family Grand Elders and Elders watched this scene with petrified faces.

Huang Xiaolong inhaled, pulling all of them from the pits in the ground and mountain cliffs.

“You have already seen Beitang Yiyang’s ending.” Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over these Beitang Family masters, “I will also give all of you one chance to choose whether you’re willing to submit, or would rather die.”

Those Grand Elders and Elders were deathly pale.

Death? There was no one who wasn’t afraid of dying.

But to betray their own family and submit to Huang Xiaolong? They were a hundred times unwilling, and even more unable to accept it.

While these Beitang Family masters were still hesitating, Huang Xiaolong grabbed a Fifth Order Highgod Realm Grand Elder to his front, and his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power rushed out.

In the blink of an eye, that Fifth Order Highgod Realm Grand Elder turned into a dried corpse.

Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand and the dried corpse turned into dust, floating away in the air.

The hesitating Beitang Family masters immediately tensed up.

“I don’t have much patience right now, you have ten breaths to consider the matter. After ten breaths, those unwilling to submit to me shall die!” Huang Xiaolong’s glimmered with bloodthirst.

The Beitang Family masters felt a cold shiver down to their hearts.

Ten breaths!

Two breaths later, a Grand Elder finally stepped out, willing to submit to Huang Xiaolong. Seeing this, several others began to speak up, willing to submit.

Soon, half of the Beitang Family Grand Elders and Elders were willing to submit to Huang Xiaolong. Several breaths later, more than half had already submitted.

Beitang Yiyang had selected more than six hundred Beitang Family masters to follow him to the Martial Spirit World. Now, more than five hundred of them were willing to submit to Huang Xiaolong, leaving a little more than a hundred that had yet to decide.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes swept over those hundred over people, his voice extremely cold, “Ten breaths have passed. Since you all can’t decide, then be buried here!”

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s voice fell, violent waves of godforce gushed out from these hundred over people. Those Beitang Family Grand Elders and Elders who had silently refused to submit seemed to have reached a tacit agreement to self detonate, wanting to bring Huang Xiaolong with them to hell.

Still, Huang Xiaolong was already prepared for this. With a light sway, he reverted back to his human form, after which one thousand arms fanned out from his back.

Godly Xumi Art!

In the next instant, one thousand arms executed the God Binding Palm at the same time, raining down on those Beitang Family masters and binding their godforce.

...

Inside the Vermilion Bird Institute’s great hall, Institute Principal Qiu Baifei was staring at the sun setting on the horizon, speaking to the Grand Elders behind him without turning around, “The sun has set, Huang Xiaolong has probably died in the hands of Yelu Chufei and Beitang Yiyang by now.”

It was the day of Huang Xiaolong’s wedding. All forces in the four galaxies, be they big or small, were aware that the Yelu and Beitang Families wanted to slaughter the entire Martial Spirit World.

There were more than a few people in the four galaxies who wanted to see Huang Xiaolong dead, and one of them was the Vermilion Bird Institute Principal Qiu Baifei, who was now waiting for news.

“It’s certain that Huang Xiaolong is dead by now, he has no way of fighting back against both Yelu and Beitang Families at the same time.” He Feifan laughed, “There should be an Elder bringing good news soon.”

Right at this time, a Vermilion Bird Institute Elder ran in with a flustered expression.

“How is it?” Qiu Baifei asked anxiously, “Is Huang Xiaolong already dead?”
