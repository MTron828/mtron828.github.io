Chapter 3117: Maybe Not

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong was sent flying with a palm strike from Xiao Tianqi, and he shot across the skies like a shooting star. He slammed heavily into one of the distant sacred lands.

There were countless sacred lands located in the Origin Holy World, and losing several wasn’t an issue. Huang Xiaolong smashed through the first sacred land he landed on, and he crashed into another.

After breaking several dozen sacred lands apart, Huang Xiaolong finally stopped. The final one he landed on cracked into pieces, and the world fell silent.

Those of the World Master’s Manor couldn’t help but break into cheer. The senior commanders, commanders, and generals started to roar with joy, “Nice!”

Smiles appeared on the faces of many patriarchs.

Even the Black and White Dao Venerable revealed a smile on his face.

As for Jiang Meng, he guffawed, “Lord World Master is unbeatable! Huang Xiaolong couldn’t even take a single strike from him!”

He felt extremely refreshed when he saw how Huang Xiaolong was sent flying.

In the past, he had offended Huang Xiaolong, and he was even forced to apologize to the man! He felt extremely stifled, and he finally managed to release all the pent-up anger in him.

Xiao Yuncheng heaved a sigh of relief.

He hoped that his father would win the battle, and force Huang Xiaolong to become part of the World Master’s Manor. When that happened, his father would be able to gain the servitude of the Myriad Formation Devil. He could hand the old devil over and resolve the crisis faced by the Origin Heavenly Cave! If Xiao Tianqi managed to take down Huang Xiaolong, who in the world would dare to question his authority?!

As the cheers resounded through the air, Huang Xiaolong’s figure rose into the skies. The palm print on his body was merely a red mark on his skin, and even though the ordinary armor he was wearing was shattered, not a drop of blood could be seen!

Everyone turned to look at him in shock.

In the next instant, the crowd went wild.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even suffer any internal injuries after the strike from the World Master! It only managed to slightly redden his skin!

Huang Xiaolong took on the strike from Xiao Tianqi without defending himself, but he only suffered some superficial injuries! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Xiao Tianqi’s eyes widened in shock as his pupils shrank to the size of a needle’s point. “You… Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!” That wasn’t all. He didn’t mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong’s physique had also reached the perfection level. No… In fact, it might be even stronger than perfection-level!

“Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!” The name sounded like a clap of thunder in the ears of those watching the battle.

Wasn’t that the strongest dao physique in the world?!

The only two people who weren’t shocked were Xiao Yuncheng and Xuan Kong. They had already learned about Huang Xiaolong’s dao physique in the past. The only thing that surprised them was the fact that Huang Xiaolong had managed to increase his strength by such a huge amount in such a short amount of time! One had to know that a full-powered strike from the World Master was enough to shatter several dozen sacred lands! Yet, he couldn’t even destroy the defenses of Huang Xiaolong’s skin!

How hard was the man’s chest?!

No… a better question would be to ask how strong Huang Xiaolong’s dao physique was!

As the power of nirvana poured out from his body, the red mark disappeared. Other than the shattered armor, he looked completely fine.

“The combined power of the four basic elements is really shocking.” Huang Xiaolong patted the dust off himself and he muttered, “Fellow Cultivator Xiao should still be holding back, right?”

If Xiao Tianqi used his full strength, he would definitely be able to shatter Huang Xiaolong’s ribs.

After all, he didn’t use any energy to defend himself.

Xiao Tianqi could only praise Huang Xiaolong in response. “Fellow Cultivator Huang Xiaolong is really unparalleled when it comes to his dao physique. I’ve seen someone who possessed the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth in the past, but he’s a far cry from you.”

In the past, Xiao Tianqi had come to blows with someone who had the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth. However, the other party had only reached the major completion stage, and he wasn’t anywhere close to Huang Xiaolong’s level!

“I will no longer hold back. Please be careful not to die.” The light around Xiao Tianqi’s body reached a whole new level as his aura started to expand.

Punching out before anyone could react, massive fists formed in the skies.

The fist was indescribably big, and it could probably cover a sacred land! The stars in the skies dimmed when he made his move.

As the fist was formed by all four basic elements, it contained all of Xiao Tianqi’s power. The fist was made up of layers that consisted of the four elements and they reinforced each other endlessly. There wasn’t any weakness at all, and the fist could be said to form a world of its own.

The power of wind tore through the space it passed through, and the fist soon arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong.

He was like a speck of dust before the giant fist, and the fist seemed to contain the power to rip the tiny Huang Xiaolong into shreds. Returning a punch of his own, a massive blast rang through the skies.

Boom!

When Huang Xiaolong’s right fist came into contact with the fist formed by Xiao Tianqi, everyone saw a scary amount of light emerging from Huang Xiaolong’s arm.

First came the purple light that signified the power of lightning, then came the dark green light that represented the power of nirvana. Traces of blue light started to emerge, and the giant fist was stopped dead in its tracks.

“He blocked it!” someone muttered under his breath.

Everyone could see that Xiao Tianqi’s current attack was several times stronger than his palm strike previously. However, it failed to do anything to Huang Xiaolong.

“Three… Three types of power at perfection level!” Xiao Tianqi looked at the three different lights emerging from his body.

Other than the power of nirvana and lightning, he controlled the power of absolute frost!

With the strength he revealed, Huang Xiaolong managed to stop his full-powered strike!

The Black and White Dao Venerable, Yang Yuyuan, and the others were shocked. The only ones who had expected something like that to happen were Xiao Yuncheng and Xuan Kong, and they could only smile bitterly. They were the only ones from the World Master’s Manor who knew that Huang Xiaolong had also reached perfection-level in the power of poison.

“I’ve said this before. You’re not my opponent.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“Maybe not!” Xiao Tianqi roared as he rose into the skies again. A mysterious energy descended from the air as it charged into his body.

After receiving the boost from the mysterious energy, Xiao Tianqi’s body started to expand, and he turned into a massive giant that stood tall among the stars.

His body turned so large that everyone could no longer see his head. They only managed to look at the lower half of his body as he turned into a being whose size had gone past their ability to comprehend.

A frightening pressure surrounded the Origin Heavenly Cave, and the energy started to sweep across other regions.

Everyone was stunned by the sudden revelation. Was that what would happen when Xiao Tianqi used the power of grand dao and origin energy contained in the Origin Holy World?! He was a monster whose strength no one could estimate!
