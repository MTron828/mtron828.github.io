Huang Xiaolong frowned after he heard it. The grand elder’s words seemed a little too overbearing... Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The grand elder turned to Huang Xiaolong’s group and sneered arrogantly, “After you guys make an oath and swear not to divulge what happened here, you can leave.”

One of the white-haired elders suddenly suggested, “Grand Elder Wu Tianhe, the matter regarding the Earth Bear is too important. I think it will be more appropriate for us to bring them all back to the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

“That’s right. We can either bring them back to the palace, or else...” Another elder drew a line across his neck and his meaning was obvious.

The Earth Bear wasn’t an ordinary demonic spiritual beast, and if news about it were to leak out, all the Emperor Palaces would start to cause some trouble. Even their Grandmist Emperor Palace wouldn’t get off easily. As the saying goes, ‘only dead men tell no secrets’.

Grand Elder Wu Tianhe hesitated for a moment.

Huang Xiaolong laughed in his heart as he was rather curious as to what the grand elder would choose to do.

After struggling with himself and thinking about it, a ruthless look flashed through Wu Tianhe’s eyes and he nodded towards the other two elders.

Their meaning was obvious and a cold light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

This grand elder called Wu Tianhe from the Grandmist Emperor Palace had chosen to kill them to hide their secret!

When the two elders saw the nod of approval from Wu Tianhe, a smile appeared on their faces.

The little cow yawned and said, “Who would have thought that even the disciples from the Grandmist Emperor Palace would act so sneakily... They would kill for a little profit...”

The faces of everyone from the Grandmist Emperor Palace changed when they heard her insult.

In response, the white-haired elder grinned and retorted, “Even though I am embarrassed by our actions, we are forced to do this for the sake of Grandmist Emperor Palace. If you want to blame, then blame it on that Earth Bear. Don’t worry too much, we will make sure to leave a thread of your soul so that you can reincarnate.”

As soon as he spoke of his ‘magnanimity’, the sword in his hand shot towards Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Numerous sword qi came together and fused together, sweeping away everything in its way.

Everywhere the sword qi swept across, dust and destruction was left in its wake.

The other elder drew his sword and made a move on the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the others. The tip of the sword shimmered and it was as if the sword was slithering towards them like a snake.

The rest of the disciples from Grandmist Emperor Palace went into action and they formed a sword formation in an instant.

The sword formation exuded a terrifying amount of sword qi. Initially, the sword qi it emitted was comparable to a gentle drizzle. However, it turned into violent and horrifying tsunamis in the next instant. All the power from the formation rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

It was a feat for someone to be able to arrive at the central region of the Perfect Galaxy. As such, the elders and the disciples didn’t hold back and they immediately unleashed all their power with their opening attacks.

Seeing that the white-haired elder’s sword qi was about to connect with Huang Xiaolong, Lei Budong raised his hand and gently flicked his wrist.

In an instant, the sword qi dissipated as though it was never there to begin with.

A loud blast erupted from the white-haired elder’s chest and he was sent flying.

Almost at the same time, the other elder was sent tumbling away with a single slap from Xiang Xun.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he charged into the battle while riding on the little cow and they were like tigers who were released into a flock of sheep. What did the core disciples amount to in front of him? With every move of Huang Xiaolong’s fist, lightning flashed and several of the core disciples were sent flying away.

The little cow wasn’t slow either. Every time her tail made a sweep, several core disciples from the Grandmist Emperor Palace would fall to the ground.

In the blink of an eye, more than ten of the core disciples were lying on the ground and moaning helplessly like the two elders.

Wu Tianhe was surprised to see the sudden change in situation and before he could react, a terrifying burst of strength blew him away.

When he fell to the ground, he heard a buzz in his head and vomited a mouthful of fresh blood.

He turned around with trepidation in his heart and realized that the Chaos Black Camel was looking at him.

“Who are you? Who are you people exactly?!” Wu Tianhe quickly suppressed the shock in his heart and stared at Huang Xiaolong’s group in terror.

The two elders and the group of core disciples stared at Huang Xiaolong’s group with their mouths agape.

“I am Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong calmly revealed.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Wu Tianhe and the people from Grandmist Emperor Palace were stunned as they stared at him.

“You are Huang Xiaolong from Fortune Emperor Palace?” The white-haired elder asked again.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong confirmed.

Wu Tianhe crawled to his feet and he glared at Huang Xiaolong with an unsightly expression. “As it turns out, you are the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Huang Xiaolong! Not only did you meddle in the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s affairs, you even made a move to kill us! Have you thought about the consequences of your actions?”

Yao Chi who was standing at the side could no longer hold herself back and she screamed, “Since when did we meddle in your affairs? You were the one who wanted to kill us first! Don’t think that just because you are from Grandmist Emperor Palace, you can do whatever you want!”

The expression on their faces changed quickly.

“Huang Xiaolong, we will remember what you did today!” Wu Tianhe’s expression turned frosty as he waved his hand. “Let’s go.”

Lei Budong and Feng Chen’s figure started to blur as they wanted to detain Wu Tianhe and the others. However, Huang Xiaolong merely waved his hand and shook his head before saying, “Let them leave.”

There was no need for them to take action as Wu Tianhe and the rest would be taken care of by Grandmist Emperor Palace.

After Wu Tianhe and the others left, Li Lu asked with faceful of worry, “Xiaolong, are we still going to Grandmist Emperor Palace?”

“Of course, why not?” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Li Lu and Yao Chi were startled.

“Big brother, are you planning to go to the Grandmist Emperor Palace?!” The Earth Bear was surprised and it stared at Huang Xiaolong with its huge, cute eyes.

“Yeah.” Huang Xiaolong nodded and continued, “The people from Grandmist Emperor Palace have already left, you can leave now.” He then took out a jade bottle and handed it over to the Earth Bear, “Here are some grandmist spiritual pills for you.”

Huang Xiaolong could see that the injuries on Earth Bear weren’t serious. With the assistance of these grandmist spiritual pills, it would be able to recover very quickly.

The Earth Bear was startled as it received the jade bottle, however, it didn’t have any thoughts about leaving and stood there like a wooden statue. Before Huang Xiaolong had the chance to speak, it declared, “Big brother, I won’t leave, I want to follow you!”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned and a smile slowly appeared on his face, “Aren’t you afraid of following me to the Grandmist Emperor Palace?”

The Earth Bear revealed an adorable smile, “Why should I be afraid if big brother is not? There are so many experts around you... There are even two pretty sisters beside you!”

Everyone broke out into laughter as they were amused by the Earth Bear’s antics.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong decided to bring the Earth Bear along with him.

In half an hour, everyone boarded the Dragon Shark Flying Ship again and they left for the Grandmist Emperor Palace.
