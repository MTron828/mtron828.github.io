Chapter 2115: Do You Really Think They Can Get Away?

When Huang Xiaolong heard that the Reverence Moon Old Man had contacted them, he couldn’t help but feel his heart shake. He quickly asked the little cow to inquire about the matter with his senior brother.

Very quickly, they received a reply. When the little cow read the Reverence Moon Old Man’s reply, her expression turned ugly. Cang Mutian scanned through it, and his eyes widened in shock.

Huang Xiaolong felt a premonition in his heart when he saw the expression on their faces.

“What’s wrong?”

Cang Mutian passed the transmission symbol over to Huang Xiaolong, and after he read it, his expression sank. Killing intent burst out from his eyes.

Wan Yue had completely destroyed Jiang Hong’s body in the Divine World! Even the bones weren’t spared! Since there was no corpse, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t think of a way to revive his senior brother! Even if he gathered all nine great lightning pools, they would be of no d*mn use!

Huang Xiaolong’s vision turned red in an instant as he shattered Wan Zhuoyuan’s other arm. Frigid yin energy poured into the wound without stopping.

Miserable shrieks escaped Wan Zhuoyuan’s lips, and Huang Xiaolong soon shattered all the remaining bones in his body.

Other than screams and cries of pain, nothing else could be heard.

Huang Xiaolong only stopped after venting all his anger on Wan Zhuoyuan.

Killing intent boiled in Wan Zhuoyuan’s heart when he experienced the pain of having all his bones shattered. No matter what, he was a reincarnated Venerable, and he was an existence who could shake the world outside of the 33 heavens! He used to command countless supreme beings, and he had never suffered from such humiliation before!

How dare an ant from a lower world touch me...?

Wan Zhuoyuan’s thought about all the ways he would make Huang Xiaolong suffer after escaping. Given enough time, he would definitely crush Huang Xiaolong under his feet!

Seemingly able to feel the murderous intent in Wan Zhuoyuan’s heart, Huang Xiaolong snorted before sending a punch towards his face. With a single fist, Huang Xiaolong crushed half of Wan Zhuoyuan’s head. ‘Luckily’ for Wan Zhuoyuan, he possessed a saint physique. His head soon grew back, and Huang Xiaolong immediately smashed the other half in as soon as that happened.

“Huang Xiaolong, I am a reincarnated Venerable! How dare you do this to me?!” Wan Zhuoyuan screamed, “You’ll regret this!”

“Regret?” Huang Xiaolong muttered in a low voice, “You’ll be the one regretting standing against me.” The Radiance Divine Scepter appeared in his hand after he spoke, and he stabbed at Wan Zhuoyuan’s crotch.

Clamping his legs together, Wan Zhuoyuan’s anger was replaced by fear. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you think you’re doing? Stop right now!”

Ignoring his cries, Huang Xiaolong stabbed downwards, and the sound of something shattering filled the air. Even overlords like the little cow and Cang Mutian, who had lived for countless years, felt a chill running down their spine.

Huang Xiaolong was a little too ruthless. After all, the other party was a reincarnated Venerable. Even if they ignored his status as an ex-Venerable Realm expert, his identity of being Wan Shi’s grandson was enough to scare most people away. Humiliating Wan Zhuoyuan like that was worse than killing him.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong didn’t give a sh*t. When Wan Shi had destroyed the Grandmist Emperor palace and Wan Yue had killed his senior brother, Jiang Hong, none of them had shown any mercy. As such, there was no reason for Huang Xiaolong to hold back when dealing with their descendent.

“There might be a chance for Jiang Hong to be revived!” Cang Mutian muttered to himself. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong froze, and he slowly turned around. He asked incredulously, “Is there really a way?!”

Nodding his head, Cang Mutian explained, “Even though Wan Yue destroyed Jiang Hong’s body, his godhead might still be intact! A Sovereign’s godhead can’t be destroyed so easily. There is a chance Wan Yue is holding on to your senior brother’s godhead. As long as you manage to retrieve it, there is a chance of reviving him! The only problem is that you might have to create a new body for Jiang Hong...”

A wave of joy washed over Huang Xiaolong’s heart when he heard what Cang Mutian said.

No longer bothering with Wan Zhuoyuan, Huang Xiaolong continued to ask the Reverence Moon Old Man about the matters that happened during the battle.

Indeed. Wan Yue had kept Jiang Hong’s godhead after killing him.

Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes as a plan started to form in his head.

...

In the space within the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens, Wan Yue stared at the scene before him with an ugly expression. The two hundred and sixty-eight divine trees that used to be there were gone. Not even a single leaf remained. That wasn’t all. Wan Zhuoyuan, who had been cultivating in the heart of the space, was nowhere to be seen either.

Other than Wan Shi and himself, there were only two other people who knew how to enter the forbidden area. One of them was Yang Gang, and the other was an overlord who served the City of All-Heavens.

“Did anyone approach the Encompassing Heaven Space?” Wan Yue turned to question a guard he had found.

“Reporting to Lord Wan Yue, Lord Yang Gang was here!” The guard replied in haste.

Yang Gang!

Wan Yue frowned as a multitude of thoughts ran through his mind. Was it possible that Yang Gang had betrayed them? However, he quickly dismissed the thought. He and Yang Gang had grown up together. They were buddies who had cultivated together, and they traveled between the line of life and death alongside each other countless times. Yang Gang couldn’t betray the City of All-Heavens.

“Where is Yang Gang right now?” Wan Yue continued to question.

“After Lord Yang Gang left, no one has seen him.” The guard bowed in response.

Wan Yue’s heart sank as the uneasy feeling in his heart became stronger.

Very quickly, he left the forbidden area as he went straight to see his father, Wan Shi.

Half a day later, an earth-shattering piece of news started to spread through the city. According to the report from Lord Wan Shi, his grandson, Wan Zhuoyuan, was captured by Huang Xiaolong! During the World Leaders Conference, Huang Xiaolong was to exchange Wan Zhuoyuan for his master and the King of Darkness!

The news of Huang Xiaolong capturing Wan Zhuoyuan caused the city to tremble.

“Huang Xiaolong has done it this time! Lord Wan Shi went ballistic when he heard that Huang Xiaolong kidnapped his grandson! I’ve heard that he turned the hundred million miles mountain range around the city into dust, trying to look for Huang Xiaolong. He even declared that he wouldn’t stop until he crushes Huang Xiaolong’s bones into fine dust!”

“When Lord Wan Shi entered the high-level Sovereign Realm, he called for the first World Leaders Conference. This is the second time, and it will definitely be more exciting than the first!”

...

In the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens, killing intent filled Wan Shi’s eyes. How dare someone kidnap my grandson to threaten me?!

“HUANG XIAOLONG!!!”

With the anger rolling off Wan Shi’s body, the space around him started to fluctuate.

“Lord Father, if Huang Xiaolong shows up at the conference to trade Zhuoyuan for the two...?” Wan Yue asked.

“Agree to it.”

“Are we really releasing the King of Grandmist and King of Darkness?” Wan Yue was extremely unwilling to let them go.

“So what if we do?” Wan Shi sneered, “Even if I release them, do you think that Huang Xiaolong will be able to escape from my City of All-Heavens?”

Wan Yue’s eyes lit up when he heard what his father said. “Oh right! My judgement was clouded... With Lord Father, there is no way for any of them to escape!”

Wan Shi responded with a burst of hearty laughter, “That’s right! There isn’t anyone under the heavens who dares to challenge my authority. Huang Xiaolong, the day you show up is the day you die!” He waved his hand after he spoke, and the King of Grandmist and the King of Darkness fell through the void to arrive before him. Their bodies were riddled with injuries, and they didn’t look too good.

There was a trace of destructive power hidden in their wounds, and even overlords like them weren’t able to recover fully.

“Old things, let me tell you some good news.” Wan Shi chuckled, “Your amazing disciple will probably come over to save you during the World Leaders Conference. Oh right. I missed a detail there. On that day, I’ll send all of you to the gates of hell!”

“Anyway, I’ll let you have a taste of a living hell before that!” Pointing towards the two of them, a flash of green light entered their bodies, and painful shrieks filled the space.
