Chapter 3355: Void Immortal Realm

 

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong scanned through the other party’s memories.

He learned something pretty shocking.

“Oh? Offspring of the Ancient Devil Race?”

The monsters in the Devil Hell were all offsprings of the Ancient Devil Race. They were closely related to the Ancient Immortals of Earth, and they had even fought several great wars against each other. After the Ancient Devils were defeated, they were sealed in the Devil Hell Secret Region.

After countless years of hard work, they had finally managed to use the assistance of the origin devil qi they found in the secret region to break through the seal created by the Ancient Immortals!

“Devil Lord?!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned to stare at the deepest parts of the secret region.

The devil lord had the purest bloodline out of them all, and he was also a descendant of the Ancient Devils. His strength had reached the peak of the late Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm!

Due to the suppression of the lower worlds, he hadn't been able to break through.

“Peak late-Ninth Level Void Immortal…,” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He didn’t expect there to be such an existence on Earth! 

Huang Xiaolong shattered the creature he was holding with a slight squeeze. Casually waving his hand, a giant rune appeared in the skies and sealed off the entrance of the secret region.

Even though the seal was created by Huang Xiaolong casually, it wouldn’t be easy for the creatures to destroy it. At the very least, it would hold for the next few days.

After sealing the entrance, Huang Xiaolong made his way towards the depths of the secret region.

The space contained within the secret region was greater than the surface of the Earth! The devil lord himself had no idea how many monsters there were in the secret region even though he was the master of the region, but he knew that there were no less than a quadrillion!

There were only ten billion humans alive at the moment, but the monsters outnumbered them by at least a thousand times!

If the creatures went up to the surface, there wouldn’t be any space left!

When he looked at the creatures that were rushing towards the already closed entrance, an icy blue light surrounded him. 

Every single creature in a ten-mile radius around Huang Xiaolong was turned into an ice sculpture.

Several creatures who were out of their mind charged at Huang Xiaolong, but they couldn’t even react before they turned into crumbled ice.

Eventually, they started to avoid him like the plague.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Like the humans, the monsters were equally afraid of death.

When Huang Xiaolong was traveling towards the depths of the secret region, the great general of the devil race reported the situation to the upper echelons of the devil race.

“What?! A human intruded on our lands?!” The great marshal of the devil race, You Dehai, was shocked. Weren’t we the ones doing the invading?! 

“How many of them are there?!” You Dehai asked.

The general hesitated for a second before stuttering, “There… There’s only one person!” 

“What?!” You Hehai roared in disbelief, “All of you can’t stop a single person?!” 

The generals revealed awkward looks.

“He… He’s really strong!” One of the generals stammered, “The icy qi around his body stops anyone from entering ten miles of him! Chen Yuan and the other generals have already been turned into ice sculptures! They crumbled the moment we touched them, and we can’t even try to save them!” 

You Dehai stared at them in shock. He knew how strong his subordinates were.

“Marshal, do you think we should report this to the devil lord?” 

You Dehai nodded solemnly, “Go and report this to Lord Devil right now. He’s in the Blood Sea Divine Palace. The rest of you, follow me to meet the human!” 

All of them shot out from the palace instantly.

The Devil Lord was the master of the secret region, and everyone listened to his commands. You Dehai was the third-strongest expert among the devil race, and he was at the mid-level Void Immortal Realm!

According to human standards, he would be considered an Ancient Immortal!

An existence at his level was more than enough to destroy the world! He would be a terrifying existence no matter where he went!

Under his leadership, they soon discovered Huang Xiaolong.

You Dehai felt his scalp going numb when he felt the icy qi coming off Huang Xiaolong.

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong arrived a hundred meters away, and he stared directly at You Dehai. “Devil Marshal?” 

He could tell that the other party was in the mid-level Void Immortal Realm.

With his cultivation suppressed to the peak of the Void Immortal Realm, someone at the level of You Dehai would be able to loosen his muscles a little.

“I am Devil Marshal You Dehai! Who are you? Who would have thought that there would be such a strong Human expert left on Earth…”

“I am Huang Xiaolong. There’s no need to speak any further. Make your move.” 

“Alright!” You Dehai didn’t waste any more time as a pair of giant axes appeared in his hands. There were weird devil ghost-like beings that appeared behind him as devil qi filled the air. He appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye as he slashed downwards.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to hold the tip of the axe with his thumb and forefinger. A bright flash covered the axe before it turned to ash as Huang Xiaolong landed a solid kick on You Dehai’s belly.

A giant blast was heard as You Dehai was sent flying into the ground. The earth trembled as a giant crater was created.

Dust filled the air as countless creatures were killed by the impact.

The devils present stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“You… What… What was that flame?! How can your physical body be so damn strong?!” struggling to get to his feet, You Dehai stammered. A look of terror flashed across his face as he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

The pair of axes were top-grade immortal artifacts! It could kill the Ancient Immortals and it had no weakness! Now, it turned into a pile of ash!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong didn’t use a single trace of true essence when he kicked earlier. He only used the power of his fleshy body.

Not even the Ancient Immortals would possess such power! Even the Pangu in the legends wasn’t as terrifying as the weird human standing before him!

Naturally, the legends of Pangu were written before he ascended. No one knew how strong he really was.

Huang Xiaolong descended before You Dehai and casually sent a grandmist worm tunneling through his body. 

“Bring me to the Blood Sea Divine Palace,” Huang Xiaolong ordered.

“Yes, Your Highness!”
