Chapter 97: Four Years Passed

Two days passed.

Like the previous time, Huang Xiaolong had all the necessities prepared and departed Tianxuan Mansion for the Silvermoon Forest; similarly, he brought the little violet monkey with him as well.

...

Three months later, at a lake somewhere in the Silvermoon Forest, a Stage Seven Raging Flames Rhinoceros was heading to the lake. Suddenly, two sharp rays of blade light flashed and that Stage Seven Raging Flames Rhinoceros let out a dismal howl as its blood spurted out and it fell to the ground.

When the huge rhinoceros fell, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette emerged and he came beside the beast corpse. With a wave of the Blades of Asura, the beast core was dug out.

Holding the beast core in his hands, Huang Xiaolong subsequently sent it into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda’s space so it could absorb the demonic energy inside.

After absorbing that beast core, there were signs that a new Fire Dragon Pearl would be condensed soon.

This method is still too slow. Huang Xiaolong thought in his mind.

During these past three months, Huang Xiaolong averaged five Stage Seven demonic beasts every day, and up to now, he has killed more than four hundred demonic beasts. Still, this number only birthed twenty-something Fire Dragon Pearls. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Over ninety days of work, and it only resulted in twenty-something Fire Dragon Pearls!

This result made Huang Xiaolong shake his head.

Progressing at this speed, the Fire Dragon Pearls could not keep up with his need. Furthermore, before he came to the Silvermoon Forest, he gave out a total of eighty Fire Dragon Pearls to his parents, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou. The number of Fire Dragon Pearls in the Linglong Pagoda space was scarce to begin with, and now, three months later, all of it were already used up for his cultivation.

But, this was something out of his power.

One more year and I can break through the Eighth Order! Huang Xiaolong estimated.

Advancing to the Eighth Order meant he could hunt Stage Eight demonic beasts, and the demonic energy inside a Stage Eight beast core was several times more concentrated than a Stage Seven beast core. At that time, perhaps the Linglong Treasure Pagoda could condense out one Fire Dragon Pearl on a daily basis.

“Hoo Hoo Hoo!” At this point of time, the little violet monkey came running from some distance away. Seeing the Raging Flame Rhinoceros beast corpse at the side, it started squeaking with dissatisfaction at Huang Xiaolong.

Due to the Linglong Treasure Pagoda’s need for beast cores, thus the need for this trip into the Silvermoon Forest, Huang Xiaolong turned into the little monkey’s ‘competitor’ for beast cores. Thus it was decided between them the one who first killed the demonic beast would own the beast core.

And every time, Xiaolong’s actions were always faster than the little monkey’s.

So, it was no wonder that the little guy was dissatisfied.

.........

The passage of time flowed by.

Months passed one after another and soon, nine months had passed, almost reaching the end of the year.

At the end of the year, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey journeyed back to Tianxuan Mansion. On the first day of the New Year, Xiaolong had a warm, loving reunion with his family; and of course, he participated in the Cosmic Star Academy’s annual competition.

Needless to say, the Second Year Class champion title was brought home by Xiaolong, as both Lu Kai and Ye Yong were defeated one after the other.

Although Huang Xiaolong was the class champion, the Second Year overall champion was not him. With his current strength, he was not able to win over the strongest person in the Second Year, a peak late-Eighth Order.

Not long after spending the New Year with his family, he packed up and took the little violet monkey back to the Silvermoon Forest for another bout of training.

Spring ended and autumn was on its way.

One year passed after another like the seasons.

At the end of every year, Xiaolong would return to Tianxuan Mansion and take part in the Academy competition.

Four years had passed.

Scorching sunlight shone down on the great earth, and a young man looking around fifteen to sixteen years old with a little monkey on his shoulder was seen dashing through the forest speedily, akin to a fleeting phantom shadow.

While running, the young man suddenly stopped and leaped upward. Just as the young man leaped away, a huge demonic bear’s attack landed on the spot where the young man stood previously.

Successfully dodging the demonic bear’s attack, the young man turned back and a Collapse Fist punched onto the huge demonic bear’s body. The power of that fist was heavy and strong, directly sinking into the demonic bear’s chest and it came out from its back, penetrating through its entire body.

The huge demonic bear tumbled to the forest floor.

This young man was none other than Huang Xiaolong. Four years had passed, and he had grown into a handsome looking youth; five feet six inches tall, close to five foot seven, with a lean muscular body, star-like eyes, a tall nose, and red lips.

Four years had passed and Xiaolong not only advanced to the Eighth Order, but his current strength was at the peak of late-Eighth Order, and anytime soon, he could break through to the next order.

However, the demonic bear on the floor that was just killed by Huang Xiaolong was not a Stage Eight beast, but a Stage Nine demonic beast.

Although only a peak late-Eighth Order, his strength could easily kill a demonic beast of the early Stage Nine.

Huang Xiaolong came to the huge bear corpse and he dug out the beast core and threw it into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space. Instantly, all the demonic energy inside the beast core was absorbed, turning it into a new Fire Dragon Pearl.

The energy inside a Stage Nine beast core was higher than a Stage Seven beast, about ten times or more, and one Stage Nine beast core was enough for the Linglong Treasure Pagoda to condense out one Fire Dragon Pearl in exchange.

This is the twentieth! Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

This month he had killed a total of twenty Stage Nine demonic beasts; unfortunately, compared to Stage Seven and Eight demonic beasts, Stage Nine demonic beasts were hard to find. On average, Xiaolong could probably hunt one in a day.

“Hoo Hoo Hoo!” At this time, the little monkey jumped down, and approached the corpse; its sharp claws slashed across and it took out a bear gallbladder.

Even after four years, the little violet monkey’s appearance had no changes to it– it was still the same half-a-meter tall little monkey. The only difference was that its fur became shinier and softer and its pupils were a sharp piercing blue.

Its strength growth was no slower than Huang Xiaolong who possessed the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and their strength could be said to be equal.

After killing the huge demonic bear, Xiaolong and the little violet monkey left in search of the next target.

Two more months passed.

The time of the end of the year once again neared; thus, Huang Xiaolong and the little violet monkey left the Silvermoon Forest, heading back to the Royal City.

Half a month later, Xiaolong and the little monkey were back at the Luo Tong Royal City.

“Big Brother!” Just as he stepped into the Tianxuan Mansion, a young girl about fourteen to fifteen years old hurried out from inside and cried out happily.

This pretty young girl happened to be Huang Min, Huang Xiaolong’s little sister; four years had turned a little girl into a young woman.

Coming out, Huang Min dragged her big brother into the yards of Tianxuan Mansion.

Huang Xiaolong laughed at her actions, “Little girl, why are you so happy?”

Huang Min pursed her lips and protested, “Big Brother you are so mean. I have grown up. Don’t call me little girl anymore.” Them, her eyeballs rolled naughtily, asking “Wanna guess who came?”

“Li Lu.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

These past few years, Huang Xiaolong spent most of the time training in the Silvermoon Forest and would only return to Tianxuan Mansion at the end of each year; knowing this, Li Lu would come to visit Tianxuan Mansion every year around this time, waiting for Huang Xiaolong.

“Boring.” Huang Min’s little mouth curled, but her expression changed quickly, “Elder Sister Li Lu has been here for five days already. If she knows you’re back, she will be very happy!”

Huang Xiaolong just smiled, allowing his sister Huang Min to pull him to Tianxuan Mansion’s main hall.
