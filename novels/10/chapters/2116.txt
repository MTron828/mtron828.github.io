Chapter 2117: Wan Shi, You’re Going to Die Today!

Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Complete Heaven Palace, and the little cow ran up to welcome him from his seclusion.

“Xiaolong, how was it?” She asked in a tense voice.

“Enough to kill Wan Shi.” Even though Huang Xiaolong seemed indifferent, his voice was firm.

The little cow and Cang Mutian stared at each other in stunned silence. Till date, no one had ever had the confidence of killing Wan Shi. Huang Xiaolong’s statement caused their vision to spin for quite some time.

They only reacted after Huang Xiaolong had flown quite a distance away. Leaping into the air, they followed behind him.

...

In the City of All-Heavens...

Wan Shi frowned, looking at the gradually darkening sky. It was one more hour untill the night fell, but Huang Xiaolong hadn’t shown up.

The Half Prison Ghost King mocked, “Don’t tell me that brat, Huang Xiaolong, is too afraid to appear. I guess he was just all talk...”

Lun Zhuan continued, “With Lord Wan Shi here, Huang Xiaolong doesn’t dare to approach the city! He should be hiding in some corner like the cowardly turtle he is!”

When the various world leaders heard what Lun Zhuan said, they roared with laughter.

“Lord Father, what will happen if Huang Xiaolong refuses to show up?” Wan Yue couldn’t help but ask. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Green flame raged in Wan Shi’s eyes, and he waved his hand, “Bring the old men over!”

A single order from Wan Yue sent guards running about, and the King of Grandmist and the King of Darkness soon appeared in the hall. The guards tossed them into the hall like they were getting rid of trash, and the two of them flopped to the ground. Looking at their appearances, their faces were swollen as blood leaked out from the side of their lips.

After eleven months of hellish torture, the two of them were no longer recognizable. Their skin was cracked as blood flowed across their bodies. Their eyes were sunken, and their scalps were torn apart. Even though they hadn’t gone crazy, they were close.

Looking at the state the two of them were in, the various world leaders felt their scalps tingling. Even overlords like the King of Grandmist and the King of Darkness could be tortured to the brink of insanity! If they went against Wan Shi...?!

Wan Shi swept his gaze across everyone present, and he slammed a thick blade into the floor. The blade was dark green and faint devilish cries rang in the air from time to time.

“This is the Soul Severing Blade. I have used a type of Soul Essence Metal found deep in the Heavens Path to refine this weapon. As soon as I cut someone with it, soul severing energy will flow into their body to slice your soul. No Sovereign can withstand the pain...” Wan Shi continued, “Who is willing to cut off their flesh with my blade?”

Everyone looked at each other hesitantly before staring at the Soul Severing Blade with fear in their eyes.

“I am willing!” The person who stood up was the Ghost World Leader. Even though the Ghost World wasn’t part of the five greater worlds, it wasn’t any weaker than the Dragon World or Fire World.

Wan Shi nodded his head.

Very quickly, the Ghost World Leader waved the blade and sliced off a piece of flesh from the King of Grandmist and King of Darknesse’s bodies.

A grunt escaped their lips as they turned deathly pale. It was as though a wave of frigid yin energy pierced straight into their soul sea. They felt the pain several times worse than when they were fed the Heart Poisoning Bug and Soul Devouring Worm.

The King of Darkness stared at the Ghost World Leader, and the killing intent in his eyes forced the Ghost World Leader back.

“I’ll kill you!” The King of Darkness roared as he got to his feet. However, the pain forced him to crumble to the ground before he could do anything.

“Kill me?” The Ghost World Leader sneered. “King of Darkness, right now, you don’t even have the energy to kill a pig. Since you plan on killing me, you can try!” The Soul Severing Blade in his hand fell again as he chopped off a huge chunk of flesh from the King of Darkness’ arm.

“Nice!”

Several world leaders clapped when they noticed the Ghost World Leader’s actions.

It was too bad a white streak of light broke through space before the Ghost World Leader could slash at the King of Grandmist or King of Darkness again. The light moved so quickly that even experts like Lun Zhuan couldn’t react in time.

The streak of light pierced through the space between the Ghost World Leader’s eyebrows and left through the other side of his head.

A massive hole started to form as the flesh around the wound started to dissolve. Eventually, his body became specks of light that dissipated through the lands.

Everyone stared at the scene before them in shock.

Did someone kill the Ghost World Leader in front of Lord Wan Shi?!

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Someone in the hall yelled.

A massive comet broke through the air as it shot straight towards the main hall of the All-Heavens Divine Palace.

“It’s the Ancient Heavenly Court!”

The number one treasure in the myriad of worlds has appeared!

Huang Xiaolong really came!

Everyone felt a trace of shock running through their hearts.

The King of Grandmist and the King of Darkness raised their heads to stare at the comet as their minds shook in pain and excitement.

The only person who wasn’t affected was Wan Shi as he sat on the throne without the slightest fluctuation in his expression. It was as though Huang Xiaolong’s arrival had nothing to do with him.

Very quickly, the Ancient Heavenly Court appeared in the space above the main hall. Without any intentions of stopping, it slammed towards the structure below! A massive explosion rang through the air as everyone felt their minds trembling from the impact. The protective barrier around the palace shattered into a million pieces under the assault of the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“Preposterous!” Wan Yue raged as he flung out two giant axes.

Rays of brilliant light shot out from the two axes as they spun through the air. With the power to destroy the heavens, the two giant axes appeared before the Ancient Heavenly Court. An arm, whiter than the purest jade, suddenly stretched out of the Complete Heaven Palace, and Huang Xiaolong flicked his finger.

The sound of something shattering resounded through the air as the axes crumbled into countless pieces. The sharp shards flew towards Wan Yue and the rest.

Wan Yue’s expression changed when he realized that his precious weapons were destroyed by Huang Xiaolong.

The axes were top-grade grandmist artifacts he had obtained in the depths of the Heavens Path. They weren’t ordinary top-grade grandmist artifacts either. Their offensive capabilities were comparable to the Ancient Heavenly Court, but Huang Xiaolong had managed to destroy them with a single finger!

When Wan Shi saw the top-grade grandmist axes crumbling, his pupils constricted. He reached out to probe Huang Xiaolong’s strength by sending a palm strike towards the Ancient Heavenly Court. A massive green palm appeared in mid-air, but the shards deflected by Huang Xiaolong pierced through it before flying towards Wan Yue and the rest.

Wan Shi felt like a bomb going off in his head.

In the next instant, miserable shrieks filled the hall. A shard pierced through Wan Yue’s body, and he was sent flying into the hall’s walls. He resembled a dead dog when he slammed into the walls, but he wasn’t the only one. The King of Shadows, Heavenly Snow Old Monster, the Half Prison Ghost King weren’t spared either, as they crashed into the wall alongside Wan Yue.

As for those who were in the low-level Sovereign Realm, they exploded into a mist of blood that diffused around the main hall of the All-Heavvens Divine Palace.

Only Lun Zhuan, the Heavenly Spirit Beast Master, the Old Crow Ancestor, Shi Zhen, and the two enforcers of the Heavenly World managed to escape from the shards Huang Xiaolong had sent towards them.

Even so, they felt that their backs were drenched in a cold sweat as their minds shook.

Under the shocked gaze of Lun Zhuan and the others, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python left the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“Huang Xiaolong, you are finally here!” Wan Shi got to his feet suddenly as he released his aura. A suffocating might enveloped the heavens.

Huang Xiaolong completely ignored Wan Shi as he walked towards the King of Grandmist and the King of Darkness. When he saw the sorry state they were in, killing intent shot out from his eyes. He finally turned to glare at Wan Shi as he spat, “Wan Shi, You’re going to die today!”
