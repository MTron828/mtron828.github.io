Chapter 3426: Opening the Kunlun Secret Region

Every single major family in Hong Kong canceled their projects with the Wang Family, and the Wang Family’s enterprises was cripplied in an instant. When the investors learned of what happened, it wouldn't be long before their funds would be cut off too!

“What’s going on?!” Wang Shiming muttered to himself. He couldn’t believe the news.

If the Mo Family and Ma Families cut their connections, the Wang Family couldn’t care less. However, the families that had great ties with the Wang Family for the past hundreds of years, like the Zhang, Du, and Shao Families did the same! Moreover, the old ancestors of the various families came out to state their stands personally! The latest call came from the old ancestor of the Shao Family, and he was told that they would never cooperate again in the future!

He could recall the scorn and indifferent expressions on their faces when they broke the news to him!

After spacing out for a second, the phone rang again.

However, no one dared to pick it up. The shock that filled their hearts after all the calls they had a moment ago caused them to freeze in their seats.

Eventually, Wang Quyang chose to pick it up. As soon as the video call connected, Wang Chongan’s panicking face could be seen on the screen. “Lord patriarch, Citibank sent their men over to the company!”

“Citibank?!” Wang Quyang froze for a moment.

“They came over to say that we have to return the loans we took!”

The faces of Wang Quyang, Wang Shiming, and Guo Xue changed instantly.

“Our loan period shouldn’t be up… Right?” Wang Quyang’s shaky voice sounded on the phone.

“They said that they no longer care about the interest. According to them, we will have to return all the money we borrowed!”

Wang Quyang felt the world turning dark around him.

The loans from the Wang Family came primarily from Citibank. In total, they would have to repay more than ten billion low-grade spirit stones! No matter how rich the Wang Family was, they wouldn’t be able to take out ten billion low-grade spirit stones at once!

“It’s him… He definitely had something to do with this.” Wang Quyang screamed in rage.

Wang Shiming and Guo Xue looked at their son in shock.

“Father, it’s third sister’s son! It has to be him!” Wang Quyang yelled in anger.

“That little b*stard? Did he instruct the bank to retrieve their loans?!” Guo Xue gasped in shock.

“That’s not all… He probably instructed the various families to stop their cooperation with us! He has to be the one behind all this!” Wang Quyang yelled like a cornered beast.

Wang Shiming looked at his son in shock. “This… This isn’t possible, right?”

He was extremely clear how strong Huang Jiyuan was. After all, he did a detailed investigation in the past.

No matter how talented Huang Jiyuan’s son was, he was a nobody in the eyes of the Wang Family. No one thought that he had the ability to shake up the city.

As for the bank… That should be even less of a possibility!

Citibank was one of the largest banks in the world. It had great connections in both Western Europe and the East. The families that controlled Citibank stood at the peak of the world!

“You might not know what happened, but when I visited them in the hotel…” Wang Quyang explained everything from the time he stepped into the Xilai Hotel with Wang Sisi.

When they heard that Elder Ye, Elder Mu, and the old ancestors of the various families were behaving subserviently in front of Huang Xiaolong, the couple looked at Wang Quyang in shock.

“Why don’t you go to the hotel personally…” Wang Quyang hesitated for a moment before asking.

Wang Shiming’s expression turned ugly. “Are you asking me to go beg that kid?”

“Definitely not!” Guo Xue’s face was cold and she snapped.

…

As night fell, Huang Xiaolong returned to the hotel with Zhang Yuhan. When they returned to their rooms, he retrieved the Pangu Sword.

The refinement process continued, and the night soon passed.

As soon as dawn broke the next day, Zhao Hanwen entered Huang Xiaolong’s room to report the arrival of the Wharton Family’s old ancestor.

“Let him come in. I will be leaving in a bit, and he has ten minutes if he wishes to meet me.” Huang Xiaolong said.

After all, he promised the members of the Huang Family to bring them out in a little while.

A look of joy formed on Zhao Hanwen’s face and he quickly left to bring Old Ancestor Wharton into the room.

Several moments later, the old ancestor of the Wharton Family left happily. The members of the Huang Family slowly entered the room.

“Are you ready?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Lin Kai and the others who were carrying tons of stuff and he chuckled. “We’re not going out for long. Why do you need so many things?”

“Grandma told me to bring them!” Huang Datou revealed a bitter smile.

Wang Meilan glared at him and chided, “Why are you complaining? It’s just several items! Do you have a problem with it?”

“Of course not!” Huang Datou shook his hands in a hurry. “Why would I have a problem with it…”

Laughter filled the room.

Several moments after Huang Xiaolong and the others left the hotel, Zhao Hanwen contacted him. He reported the arrival of Wang Quyang, Wang Shiming, and Guo Xue.

“Send them away.” Huang Xiaolong growled.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When the three of them were chased out of the hotel by Zhao Hanwen, rage nearly consumed them. Fire spewed from Wang Shiming’s eyes.

“We’ll return! I refuse to believe that we won’t be able to tide through this without the little mongrel b*stard’s help!” Guo Xue screamed.

…

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong and the rest left Hong Kong and they returned to the Blue Dragon Orchard.

As for the things the top families in Hong Kong did, Huang Xiaolong turned a blind eye to it. There was no need for him to interfere with the small stuff.

In fact, he didn’t instruct them to make things difficult for the Wang Family. If he wanted to exterminate them, he could flick his fingers to make the entire Wang Family disappear off the face of the earth.

The old ancestors of the various families made the decision to cut off the Wang Family by themselves, and the old ancestor of the Wharton Family was the person who instructed the bank to retrieve their loans.

As the largest shareholder in Citibank, the old ancestor of the Wharton Family could do as he wished.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t specifically tell them to stop. After all, the Wang Family started the enmity first.

He didn’t care if the Wang Family lived or died.

On the second day after they returned to the Blue Dragon Orchard…

“You’re leaving again?!” Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan scowled when they heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to head out. After all, he only returned for several days a while ago.

“I’m only going to be gone for a few days.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “I have to head over to the East Sea for a little bit.”

Of course, his goal was to enter the Kunlun Secret Region.

After so many days, he had long since refined the Pangu Sword.

When the members of the Huang Family heard that he was going to the East Sea, they heaved a sigh of relief.

He left the Blue Dragon Orchard after bidding farewell to the others.

Standing on the Pangu Sword, he turned into a streak of light that disappeared into the horizon.

The number of people who could use the Pangu Sword as a flying sword could probably be counted on two hands.

Naturally, the speed of an artifact like the Pangu Sword was something modern planes couldn’t catch up with. It took half a day for him to arrive.
