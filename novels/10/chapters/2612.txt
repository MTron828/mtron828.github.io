Chapter 2613: I’ll Kill You Like Killing a Cockroach

“What?! Senior Brother Yuan Changyao vs. Huang Xiaolong?!”

After the incident on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak, Huang Xiaolong had nearly crippled Yuan Yue, Long Zhenyang, and Jin Buji. As such, none of them could show up for the battle. Other than Feng Jiu and Feitian Longpeng, who caught the eye of the various disciples, Yuan Changyao, Long Cheng, and Jin Xing were the stars of the show.

The crowd erupted with excitement when they heard that Huang Xiaolong was about to challenge Yuan Changyao!

A frown formed on Feng Jiu’s face instantly. It was obvious that they were trying to cripple Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation base in the first battle!

“Too sinister!” Feitian Longpeng shook his head silently. “Who would have thought that they would send Yuan Changyao for the first battle? The victor has already been decided… Even I won’t be able to win against Yuan Changyao! Huang Xiaolong is going to die if he goes up there.”

“The Purple Spider Race has pretty good relations with the Silver Purity Race. Yuan Wangfeng, Yuan Zongyuan, and the others are really daring,” Feng Tianwei muttered.

“It’s just the Silver Purity Race. They aren’t the Transcendent Devil Race! The alliance of the three races is enough to force the Silver Purity Race to hide their heads in the sand!” Feitian Longpeng explained.

When everyone was still fired up, Yuan Zongyuan spoke once again, “Disciples, please enter the arena.” After he spoke, his aura locked on to Huang Xiaolong in case he tried to back out of the battle. At the same time, several strands of dao qi broke through the void and locked on to Hei Luo.

As an Eighth Heaven True Saint, it was clear that Yuan Zongyuan was unwilling to move against Huang Xiaolong in person.

Seemingly unable to feel the aura that had locked onto him, Huang Xiaolong walked towards the arena.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong was doing as he was told, Yuan Zongyuan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Soon after, he waved his hand to cover the arena with a formidable restriction.

The restriction was made by a Primal Ancestor, and as soon as it was activated, no one would think of interfering with the battle unless they were Primal Ancestors.

The Twin Dragon Race, Myriad Origin Race, and the Golden Buddha Race had really thought their actions through. They had even planned out the worst-case scenario where Hei Luo was a true Primal Ancestor Realm expert.

Yuan Changyao had long since entered the arena, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong with a trace of mockery in his eyes. As he saw that Huang Xiaolong had entered the arena, he spoke casually, “It looks like you’re no coward. For a man like you to ask a woman to beg for mercy on your behalf, you’re nothing more than a joke.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Woman? Beg for mercy? Was he delusional?

“Enough. Stop acting in front of me. No matter how many women you ask to plead on your behalf, it’s useless! You’re destined to be crippled by me today!” Yuan Changyao’s voice resounded in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Narrowing his eyes, Huang Xiaolong sneered, “You’re dreaming if you think that you can cripple me with that little strength you possess. You’re just a mere Sixth Heaven True Saint. I’ll kill you like killing a cockroach!”

Since Huang Xiaolong spoke out loudly, everyone stared at him in shock the moment the words left his lips. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Even people like Feng Jiu, Feitian Longpeng, Yuan Wangfeng, Yuan Zongyuan, Yin Zhangguo, and the others were stunned.

“This brat seems to have suffered some mental damage before entering the arena…” Long Chen couldn’t hold back, and he roared with laughter.

“Hahaha! His brain injury doesn’t seem to be light either!” Jin Xing couldn’t hold back his laughter either.

Soon after, everyone started laughing.

“Senior Brother Changyao, cripple that human b*stard!” Yuan Yue screamed in the distance. When Huang Xiaolong had sent him flying with a single punch, he had turned into a laughing stock in the eyes of all the disciples. The hatred he had for Huang Xiaolong in his heart had already surpassed any other hatred he felt.

“That’s right! Cripple that human race slave!” Long Zhenyang and the other disciples, who had suffered a miserable defeat at Huang Xiaolong’s hand, roared in anger.

Feitian Longpeng stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated gaze, and he muttered to himself, “What’s going on in his brain? I’m arrogant, but he’s worse than me! Is he crazy?”

Feng Jiu shook her head silently.

According to her, even though Huang Xiaolong was extremely talented, his cultivation base was limiting him! If Huang Xiaolong was an early-Sixth Heaven True Saint, he might have been able to defeat Yuan Changyao if he tried! However, Huang Xiaolong was a Second Heaven True Saint! Yuan Changyao was four levels above him!

The difference between a Second Heaven True Saint and a Sixth Heaven True Saint couldn’t even be comprehended by an average human!

When Huang Xiaolong said that killing Yuan Changyao was akin to killing a cockroach, he had to be joking!

With a sharp glare, Yuan Changyao snorted coldly, “Did you hear what they said? They asked me to cripple you! Make your choice. Do you wish to be crippled and tortured, or tortured before I cripple you?”

“Are you done?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to answer Yuan Changyao.

Upon seeing that the other party wasn’t playing by the rules, Yuan Changyao was dumbfounded.

Before he could move, Huang Xiaolong’s figure shook as a punch flew towards Yuan Changyao’s chest. In front of everyone, who had come to watch the battle, a bloodied hole could be seen from Yuan Changyao’s back as he was slammed into the restriction that guarded the arena.

Bang!

The light barrier formed by the restriction trembled as Yuan Changyao slid back down into the arena.

The Yuan Yue, Long Zhenyang, and Jin Buduan’s trio fell silent in an instant. The smiles on the faces of everyone present froze, and they stared at Yuan Changyao, who was slowly sliding down the light barrier.

Feng Jiu and Feitian Longpeng couldn’t believe their eyes.

“What?!” Yuan Wangfeng and the others stood up as their expressions changed drastically.

“How can this happen?!” Jin Kang screamed in fright.

Several moments later, Feitian Longpeng squeezed several words out of his mouth, “How can Huang Xiaolong be so strong?!”

“There is only a single possibility!” Feng Jiu gasped in shock. “His talent is comparable to Yuan Qianxing!” When she thought about the possibility, her voice trembled.

Yuan Qianxing!

He was the number one genius in the Otherworldly Mansion and the strongest genius in the Alien Lands.

However, someone whose talent was comparable to Yuan Qianhang had actually shown up!

Ignoring the commotion, Huang Xiaolong sauntered towards Yuan Changyao, who was crawling on the ground. By the time he got to his feet, the look in his eyes was the same as the look Long Zhenyang and Yuan Yue had when they had experienced Huang Xiaolong’s strength for the first time on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak. The look of superiority in his eyes had already disappeared.

“I told you,” Huang Xiaolong raised his eyebrows casually and continued, “Why would I need a woman to beg you for mercy?”

Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the plaza and Feng Jiu’s face flushed red.

Yuan Changyao’s expression fell, and he growled, “I was careless. You only managed to injure me with a sneak attack. Otherwise, a sh*tty Second Heaven True Saint like you will never be able to damage me! What’s more, you’re just a lowly human!” Brilliant rays of light covered his body as holy energy surged through his veins. It was as though a mysterious force was awakened in his body.

That was the strength hidden in the bodies of those of the Myriad Origin Race!

A complete dao saint godhead emerged from Yuan Changyao’s body and the radiance it emitted was blinding. Pillars of light shot through the skies and even those outside the heart of the Otherworldly Mansion managed to see it.

The Boundless Light Complete Dao Saint Godhead was unleashed!

A holy soul soon followed as a ball of golden light revolved around Yuan Changyao’s body.

“High-order Saint Fate!”

The Saint Fate Yuan Changyao had integrated was a high-order one, and once cultivators with saint godheads ranking in the top ten managed to obtain one, they were basically guaranteed an entry into the Primal Ancestor Realm.

If nothing went wrong, Yuan Changyao was destined to become a Primal Ancestor in the future!
