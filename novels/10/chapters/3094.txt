Chapter 3095: Men From the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch!

Indeed, the news of the battle shook the Origin Holy World before they could even arrive back at the World Master’s Manor.

“I’ve heard that Marshal Jiang Meng swaggered about the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce, and he was sent flying by Huang Xiaolong’s three-headed mount! Hahaha! He was so scared he pissed his pants!”

“That’s not all! Senior Commander Qu Jian’s arm was severed by the expert wielding the power of absolute blaze! He’s a one-armed freak now!”

“Seems like Huang Xiaolong treats the members of the World Master’s Manor like a pile of sh*t! This time, Jiang Meng was at the receiving end. He might even flip over the entire manor in the future!”

“Do you think the World Master’s Manor will make a move? Legends have it that Huang Xiaolong is the Mystical Pavilion's Son of Mystic, but there’s no way the World Master’s Manor will back down, right? If they do, wouldn’t they be allowing Huang Xiaolong to take a dump on their heads after climbing right over them?”

The news quickly swept through the world, and the stories became even more obscene.

In the main hall of the World Master’s Manor…

A suppressive aura could be felt through the hall as Marshal Murong Xiang growled, “Huang Xiaolong is going too far! He doesn’t respect our World Master’s Manor at all! How dare he injure a marshal?!”

“We cannot allow things to blow over like this.” Marshal Duanmu Guang raged, “Even if he is the Mystical Pavilion's Son of Mystic, he has to be punished!”

Huang Xiaolong dared to injure Jiang Meng, and if things were like what they seemed, he would be able to trample over all of them if he felt like it!

Yang Yuyuan muttered, “Even the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable addresses Huang Xiaolong as His Highness… It seems like the old man has already submitted to him. Huang Xiaolong isn’t as simple to deal with as it seems.” He paused for a moment. “Moreover, it seems like there are people fanning the flames in the Origin Heavenly Cave. They are clearly creating a rift between our World Master’s Manor and Huang Xiaolong!”

Jiang Meng and the other two marshals sank into silence.

“Even so, we can’t do nothing!” Murong Xiang snapped. “Even when an eminent elder from the Destiny Race injured a marshal of the World Master’s Manor in the past, the Destiny Patriarch personally came over to apologize! What’s more, Huang Xiaolong is just a nameless brat!”

Yang Yuyuan sank into silence. “That three-headed beast reminds me of someone…”

“Who?” Duanmu Guang asked.

“Lei Yu!”

Lei Yu! He was a terrifying beast whose reputation had surpassed Yang Yuyuan!

“There’s no way…” Murong Xiang hesitated for a moment and continued, “Wasn’t there news of him dying in the past? Whatever the case, he should no longer be in our Huang Long World!”

When Lei Yu had left the Origin Holy World in the past, rumors flew around everywhere. There were some who said he died, and there were some who said that he managed to leave the confines of the Huang Long World. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yuan Yuyuan shook his head. “What if the rumors are false? If it’s really Lei Yu…” His expression turned solemn. “Huang Xiaolong might be even harder to deal with than it seems.”

Duanmu Guang scoffed in response. “There’s no way it’s Lei Yu. Why would an expert like him agree to be a mount for Huang Xiaolong? That’s an insult no expert can bear! Even if he dies, he wouldn’t agree to submit!”

“Even if that really is Lei Yu, Huang Xiaolong might not be a match for the World Master anyway!” Jiang Meng snarled.

Yang Yuyuan fell silent for a moment before continuing, “We’ll deal with this when Lord World Master returns!”

“But…” Jiang Meng tried to contest the decision, but he was shot down instantly.

“Enough. Brother Jiang Meng, I know what you wish to say. I’ve made my decision. We’ll deal with this when Lord World Master returns.” Yang Yuyuan’s tone made it clear that there was no negotiating with him.

“Also, contact Xuan Kong!”

“Go find out who are the ones fanning the flames. If they really wish for us to clash with Huang Xiaolong, we’ll punish them severely!”

Jiang Meng and the rest could only nod in acknowledgment.

Even though they were all marshals, Yang Yuyuan was their leader.

…

In the main hall of the Tyrant Beast Creed…

“Patriarch, we might have fanned the flames as hard as we could, but Yang Yuyuan might not be willing to clash with Huang Xiaolong!” one of the eminent elders reported.

Liu Qiuan, the Tyrant Beast Patriarch, sneered, “Yang Yuyuan might not be willing to, but the hatred will never resolve itself. As long as the hatred is there, they will clash sooner or later.”

“Who would have thought that the three headed-beast was an expert! I’ve heard that the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable had already submitted to Huang Xiaolong. Who in the world is he?!”

…

In stark contrast to the outside world, Huang Xiaolong was cultivating peacefully in the headquarters of the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce.

Several years passed in the blink of an eye.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong’s body was covered in a layer of green light as a mysterious wave of energy started to fill the space around him. Flora flourished around wherever the wave of energy passed, and a trace of life could be felt everywhere.

After using the Liquid of Life, Huang Xiaolong finally comprehended the power of absolute wood.

Under his control, the Flower of Life that had bloomed previously started to grow. In a few breaths of time, it grew into a terrifying organism that covered the heavens.

From afar, one would see that the entire space had turned green. It was as though an absolute treasure was about to be born!

Half a day later…

Dark light surrounded Huang Xiaolong, and the green space started to transform into a black prison. The Flower of Life was dyed black in the blink of an eye, and Huang Xiaolong’s body shone an icy blue. The color of the flower changed once again, and it shone with a light blue hue.

With another thought, Huang Xiaolong used another type of power. After using eight peak-level energies, he finally stopped. The cosmos energy around him started to fluctuate, and the space returned to normal.

When he finally emerged from his secret room, he finally learned that many experts had come to pay him a visit when he was in seclusion. That included the Origin Prince, Xiao Yuncheng, and Xuan Kong of the World Master’s Manor. Meng Binglan from the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce had come too.

However, they had left after learning that he was in seclusion.

Turning to Lei Yu, Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Hehe, did you meet the goddess in your heart?”

With his face turning red, Lei Yu chuckled under his breath, “Yeah, we talked for half a day.”

Half a day?

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he chuckled under his breath.

Soon, he asked about the changes in the Origin Heavenly Cave during the time he was in seclusion.

On the second day of his exiting seclusion, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable reported that Eminent Elder Chen Baili from the branch of the Mystical Pavilion in the Origin Heavenly Cave wanted to pay him a visit.

“The news sure spreads fast…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. The members of the Mystical Pavilion arrived as soon as he left seclusion.

“Should I send them away?” the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable asked.

“There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “I’ll meet them.” He really wanted to see what they were there for.

Could they also be there for the Pure Soil?
