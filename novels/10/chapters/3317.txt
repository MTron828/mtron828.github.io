Chapter 3318: Old Ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect

“Baka!” One of the grand elders of the Yagyu Clan roared in anger. “Even if you kill us, we won’t kneel!”

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother arguing as he pointed at the grand elder who spoke. In an instant, he exploded into a mist of blood. His nascent soul didn't even get the chance to leave his body when he died.

A look of fear appeared on the faces of the members of the Yagyu Clan as they jumped into the air.

“Split up!”

“Run!”

That was precisely the tactic of the Japanese Alliance. It was world renowned, and it was something they used to great effect when running away from the enemies they couldn’t beat. It was too bad their opponent was Huang Xiaolong.

Flipping his palm, the members of the Yagyu Clan fell to the ground like flies. It didn’t matter how far they got as none of them managed to escape. By the time they slammed into the ground, not a trace of life was left in them.

Everyone else who didn’t escape felt the blood draining from their faces. They didn’t dare to move a muscle as they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

“Kneel!” 

His voice was like a clap of heavenly thunder that rang in the ears of half the Tokyo population. Those who had no idea fell to their knees in shock, and even the experts who were well aware of the situation got to their knees in fright.

A pressure as vast as the sea emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and the members of the Yagyu Clan were forced to their knees whether they liked it or not. 

Everyone watched on as they started to insult themselves.

As they yelled time and time again, the words ‘japanese dog’ echoed through the air.

Everyone who saw the scene couldn’t believe their eyes. Not even the members of the super factions of the Japanese Alliance could explain what they were seeing.

“What’s going on?! They seem to be controlled by some sort of…” Murasakigawa Takashi widened his eyes as he felt like something beyond his scope of understanding was happening.

Murasakigawa Akira and the other experts of the Murasakigawa Clan were the same.

“Don’t tell me Huang Xiaolong knows some sort of illusion magic?!” A grand elder of the Murasakigawa Clan gasped.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“But… But… He didn’t use anything on them!” Murasakigawa Takashi shook his head.

Sucking in a cold breath, Murasakigawa Akira felt his heart pounding in fear.

He didn’t see how Huang Xiaolong used his secret art to control all of them, but that made it all the more scary!

Several moments later, the members of the Yagyu Clan stopped when they were done saying it a hundred times.

The faces of the grand elders and elders of the Yagyu Clan were ugly as they knew whatever they did. The only problem was that they couldn’t control anything they said!

“Scram.” Huang Xiaolong snorted. “Go back and inform your patriarch to retrieve the corpse in three days.” After he spoke, he waved his hand to hang Yagyu Motoichi’s body on the plaza across the street.

“If anyone from your Yagyu Clan dares to touch the corpse in these three days, you’ll die.”

As soon as the words left his lips, audible gasps could be heard everywhere on the street. Huang Xiaolong was basically declaring the Yagyu Clan as his enemy.

The entire family will burst with rage, and Huang Xiaolong would be the number one target of their family!

Even though rage filled the hearts of the members of the Yagyu Clan, they didn’t dare to say a word. They grabbed Yagyu Tyrant who was beaten into a sorry state and they left.

Since Huang Xiaolong smashed the Yagyu Clan’s flying ship with Yagyu Tyrant’s body previously, they could only rely on their bodies to soar through the skies.

Next, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on Chen Kerui. When they felt his stare on them, Chen Kerui and Chen Shaozuo fell to their knees. They begged for mercy like there was no tomorrow as tears streamed down their faces. It was especially so for Chen Shaozuo as snot and tears flew everywhere.

The experts of the Fierce Tiger Gang soon followed their lead.

“Traitors like you guys deserve to die!” Huang Xiaolong snorted as he casually squeezed the air before him. Chen Kerui and Chen Shaozuo were crushed by a formless pressure and they formed craters that went several meters deep into the ground.

When Zhang Yu heard what he said, his legs went numb. A stream of urine stained his pants a muddy yellow.

Huang Xiaolong heard from Lu Dingming that the two of them were members of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce in pretty high positions before they left. They didn’t think that the two would immediately form a gang to go against the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce after leaving!

Huang Xiaolong hated traitors who bit the hand who fed them…

“Who is the second in command of the Fierce Tiger Gang?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

“Lord… I… I’m the second in command!” Someone who looked pretty loyal for a member of the underworld stood out all of a sudden and spoke.

“Alright. From now on, you’ll be the chief.” A ray of purple light entered the middle aged man’s forehead after Huang Xiaolong spoke.

“Yes, Lord!”

Falling to his knees, he swore, “Zhang Tian will heed the lord’s command!”

The members of the Fierce Tiger Gang stared at each other and chose to remain silent.

The next to fall to his knees were one of the Nascent Soul Realm experts of the Fierce Tiger Gang. “I, Grand Elder Xing Shuai of the Fierce Tiger Gang, will receive the lord’s command!”

The members of the Fierce Tiger Gang quickly fell to their knees when they saw that one of their grand elders had taken the lead. 

In a matter of minutes, the entire Fierce Tiger Gang submitted to Huang Xiaolong as the members of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce stared at them in confusion.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong turned around to stare at Zhang Yu.

“Lord, please, please don’t kill me!” Zhang Yu smashed his head into the ground in a massive kowtow. “Chairman, please don’t kill me! Please plead on my behalf! After all, I did work for the chamber of commerce!”

Lu Dingming couldn’t bear to watch Zhang Yu being killed and he sighed, “Xiaolong…”

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong spoke, “As the vice chairman of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, Uncle Dingming should deal with him.”

Lu Dingming revealed a grateful expression as he thanked Huang Xiaolong before announcing Zhang Yu’s punishment.

Due to the kindness in his heart, Lu Dingming spared the man’s life. However, he stripped Zhang Yu of everything he had in the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce before firing him. Moreover, he had someone chop off one of Zhang Yu’s arms as punishment.

The events started to spread through the Japanese Alliance that very night.

“The old ancestor of the Yagyu Clan is currently in the Purple Flame Sect! He’s consulting the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect on the art of pills, and after he heard that Yagyu Motoichi was killed, he erupted with rage. He is currently rushing back to the city!”

“He should be back in two days, and he will definitely claim Yagyu Motoichi’s body! Moreover, he swore to kill Huang Xiaolong before hanging his body in Yagyu Motoichi’s place!”

The news caused the powers to fall into a state of disarray.

“I’ve heard that the old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect is coming along with him!”

The old ancestor of the Purple Flame Sect was one of the six strongest cultivators on earth! He was also the best pill master in the world!

Now, he was backing the Yagyu Clan up as they returned to Tokyo!
