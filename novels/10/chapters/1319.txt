Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were shocked seeing the unyielding determination on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Master, please don’t worry, I will be careful.” Huang Xiaolong reassured them, and added, “Furthermore, I’m someone with abundant luck, hence the loosening of the Sealed Devil’s Entrance is a good opportunity for me to gain some experience.”

A good opportunity to gain some experience!

Everyone had a weird expression on their faces as a reaction to Huang Xiaolong’s words.

As the Sealed Devil’s Entrance was loosened, all the disciples who were in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield were scrambling to leave, whereas Huang Xiaolong desired to go in there to train!

He wants to hunt devils?!

However, considering the heaven-defying and monstrous talent shown by Huang Xiaolong so far, no one uttered a word of ridicule or tried to reprimand him.

However, quite a few Grand Elders were inwardly shaking their heads, as they thought that Huang Xiaolong didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth.

‘Didn’t he hear Gate Chief Zhu Yi say that there might be a possibility of devils above Ancestor God Realm crossing over to the Divine World? Even if you have abundant heaven-defying luck, facing absolute strength meant only death!’

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, that level of masters could shred Huang Xiaolong into a million pieces with a mere blow from their mouths.

“We’ll talk about this later.” Golden Brow Ancestor stated with finality.

At this moment, Huang Xiaolong could only nod and sit down. He could sense that Golden Brow Ancestor would agree to let him go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield with a little persuasion.

Huang Xiaolong planned to put in a little effort in persuading his Masters in the next two days.

Gate Chief Zhu Yi went on to divulge more information related to the loosening of the Sealed Devil’s Entrance at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, and the current situation before dispersing everyone. All of them returned to restrict disciples who were under their authority.

Huang Xiaolong returned to his Cosmos Palace from the Assembly Shrine.

He thought of cultivating, but his heart couldn’t calm down, as he was worried about Li Lu. Thus, Huang Xiaolong went out riding on the little cow, strolling around the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

When Huang Xiaolong was passing by Luo Yunjie’s cultivation palace, he decided to pay him a visit. Whenever the two of them met, they drank wine inevitably. As they drank, Huang Xiaolong’s mood actually worsened, even the wine in his mouth was tasting bland.

Huang Xiaolong left Luo Yunjie’s place shortly after. Knowing Huang Xiaolong was worried about Li Lu, Luo Yunjie did not ask Huang Xiaolong to stay.

Huang Xiaolong roamed aimlessly around the Fortune Divine Kingdom, and unknowingly came to the Blood Eye Devil Stele, located close to the Assembly Shrine. The Blood Eye Devil Stele stood inconspicuously at the same place, exuding a coldness from its Matt black surface.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Blood Eye Devil Stele, and suddenly said to the little cow, “Xiaoniū, the Divine World’s impending calamity that you have mentioned before... Is it the loosening of the Sealed Devil’s Entrance? Related to the Devil World?"

The little cow shook her head, "It is hard to say, the Sealed Devil’s Entrance is actually not a big deal for the Divine World, or the Divine World would have stationed experts at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield."

Huang Xiaolong nodded. On second thought, what the little cow said was true.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife’s Ancestor’s place.

The two were sitting and playing chess in the yard, as if they were waiting for Huang Xiaolong. They looked certain that he would come to visit them. Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had arrived, Golden Brow Ancestor chuckled softly, “I had already guessed that you would come.”

“Sit. You’re here because of Li Lu, right?” Blood Knife Ancestor said as he pointed to a seat.

Huang Xiaolong sat down awkwardly, feeling a little embarrassed.

“If you want to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, then go.” Golden Brow Ancestor said just as Huang Xiaolong sat down.

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a second, but asked enthusiastically, "Masters, are you really allow me to go?!"

Blood Knife Ancestor jokingly scolded him, "Would you really stay here obediently, even if we didn’t allow you to go?"

Huang Xiaolong grinned sheepishly, as he felt a little embarrassed to give any explanation. Indeed, a while ago, he had decided to sneak away to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield even if Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were to refuse his request to leave.

Even though the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield was more dangerous at present, he had to search for Li Lu to determine that she was safe.

“But, you must be extremely careful this time.” Golden Brow Ancestor exhorted. Then he took out a golden divine armor from his spatial ring as he went on, “I forged this Golden Divine Armor using numerous chaos metal spars, put it on and protect yourself.”

“Master, this...!” Huang Xiaolong was overwhelmed. He knew this was Golden Brow Ancestor’s divine armor that he always wore. It was one of Golden Brow Ancestor’s most loved treasures. It could even be said that half ofGolden Brow Ancestor’s life was in that armor. Yet, Golden Brow Ancestor was giving him his divine armor.

“You’re a man, so don’t act like a sissy, and take it!” Golden Brow Ancestor scolded Huang Xiaolong, as he hesitated.

Huang Xiaolong accepted the golden divine armor with both hands, and solemnly said, “Thank you, Master!”

With the possession of this Golden Divine Armor, the Yellow Springs Magic Robe, and his True Dragon Physique, there was no need for Huang Xiaolong to fear any attacks from cultivators below the Ancestor God Realm.

“Since your Big Master is sending you away with the Golden Divine Armor, I cannot not be stingy either.” Blood Knife Ancestor said as he took out a bloodred knife from his spatial ring.

With its air of bloodlust and piercing coldness, Xiaolong could tell from one glance, that it was the great blood-red knife.

A sky sragon was carved on the blood-red knife’s body. It was so life-like that it looked like it would come alive the very next second.

“This Sky Dragon Blood Knife has accompanied me for many years, I hope you would treasure it!” Blood Knife Ancestor said to Huang Xiaolong, his fingers caressed the length of the knife, filled with reluctance.

Huang Xiaolong was struck with shock,Blood Knife Ancestor was actually giving him his Sky Dragon Blood Knife? This Sky Dragon Blood Knife was Blood Knife Ancestor’s symbolic weapon that has been with him for tens of thousands of years, deterring various world surfaces. Blood Knife Ancestor had defeated numerous experts and enemies, with the help of his Sky Dragon Blood Sword. The Sky Dragon Blood Knife was his beloved, and precious partner.

Huang Xiaolong was just about to shake his head in refusal, when Blood Knife Ancestor cut him off, “Your Big Master has already said, you’re a man, so don’t act like a sissy, take it!” The Sky Dragon Blood Knife floated towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s hand reached out and caught the Sky Dragon Blood Knife. Without a word, he suddenly dropped to his knees, and respectfully kowtowed to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor accepted Huang Xiaolong’s kowtow without any guilt, then reached out lightly to hold Huang Xiaolong up.

“Go prepare well, and set off tomorrow.” Golden Brow Ancestor went on, “Both of us must stay and protect the Fortune Gate, therefore, we cannot accompany you. You must have Feng Er and the others accompany you.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement.

The Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield was filled with layers of perils, therefore, Feng Er, Gui Yi, the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the others were bound to go with Huang Xiaolong.

With these several bodyguards, Huang Xiaolong would be much safer. As long as Huang Xiaolong’s enemy was not above the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm master and above, it wouldn’t be a problem.

“Masters, do you know Li Lu’s last location, before we lost the communication with her?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield’s territory was extremely vast with numerous world surfaces, and planets. Without any indication, searching for Li Lu was akin to fishing for a needle in the sea. It would be impossible to find Li Lu if that were to be the case.

“According to Myriad Flames Ancestor, Li Lu and Black Ice Ancestor were last seen in the proximity of Wind Domain World.” Blood Knife Ancestor answered. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Wind Domain World.” Huang Xiaolong repeated under his breath as he committed the name to his memory.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong inquired about the Wind Domain World and details regarding the situation when Li Lu had gone missing. A while later, he left his Masters’ place.

While Huang Xiaolong prepared for his long trip to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, inside the sea tribe’s Sea God Temple’s main hall, the twelve prominent families’ Ancestors, Patriarchs, and other Ancestor God Realm masters were assembled to discuss about the loosened Sealed Devil’s Entrance at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Everyone was shocked, as Feng Yingying had mentioned that she wanted to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

“Lord Sea God, you... really want to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, especially at this time?” Feng Family’s Patriarch Feng Kaiyun asked.
