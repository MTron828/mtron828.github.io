The other disciples excitedly charging towards Huang Xiaolong were stunned, and they slammed on the brakes as hard as they could as they stopped dead in their tracks.

The disciples of the Fortune Emperor Palace felt cold sweat drenching the back of their clothes.

That’s so scary!

Even though they were no longer charging towards him, they saw Huang Xiaolong raise his hand at them. A look of terror appeared on their faces, and before they could scream, Huang Xiaolong’s palm slammed downwards towards them.

In an instant, all of them turned into nothing but a rain of blood.

All the disciples who had apprehended him were all members of the Snow Moon Hall. And the Snow Moon Hall only had one voice, Zhou Chen’s. As such, Huang Xiaolong showed no mercy when dealing with them.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t kill all of them. He left one alive.

When the only survivor looked at the carnage around him, his legs went soft, trembling non-stop. A tiny trickle flowed down his legs.

He actually wet himself!

Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and pulled the disciple before him. As the stench of urine assaulted his nose, Huang Xiaolong searched his soul.

In an instant, Huang Xiaolong found everything he needed.

A chilly light flashed through his eyes, and Huang Xiaolong knew that Zhou Chen had trapped everyone related to him!

His treatment to Zhao Lei, Golden Brow, and Blood Knife was especially bad. He had thrown them into the deepest level of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s prison.

The harshest punishments were given at the lowest level of the prison!

Under Zhou Chen’s instructions, the disciples who were in charge of the prison used different methods to torture Zhao Lei and the rest.

“Zhou Chen!!” Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent soared through the sky, and a fire lit up in his palm, turning the disciple into ash.

With a flash of his body, Huang Xiaolong brought the four odd beasts towards the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Since the place where Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao were detained was closer to him, he decided to save the two of them before doing anything else.

On his way, the members of the Fortune Emperor Palace pounced on him whenever they saw him, as though they were wolves who had seen their prey.

Huang Xiaolong personally dealt with those who were below the Heavenly Monarch Realm. He didn’t hold back, and the number of people who died under his hands grew. Some lucky few were sent flying, and the luckier ones merely fainted from the shockwaves of the battle.

As for those stronger than the Heavenly Monarch Realm, Huang Xiaolong left them to the four odd beasts. He didn’t wish to reveal too much of his strength before the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

The disciples who were from the Snow Moon Hall were directly executed by Huang Xiaolong and the four odd beasts. There was no lucky survivor to speak of as Huang Xiaolong picked them out specifically. Even the elders and grand elders weren’t able to survive. It was too bad; all of them were Zhou Chen’s trusted subordinates. As for the other disciples, they were the lucky ones as Huang Xiaolong merely sent them flying.

He was like a wolf in a pack of sheep. None of the disciples could stop him.

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the place where the two ladies were trapped.

In the palace, the two of them were still coming up with ways to break the restriction when they heard the guards’ miserable cries resounding through the air.

What’s going on? A single thought flashed through the minds of both ladies at the same time.

Before they could react, they caught sight of a figure walking towards them.

“Xiaolong!”

When they realized that the black-haired young man before them was the person they had longed for day and night, they rose to their feet and exclaimed in pleasant surprise.

However, their faces changed in the next instant.

“Xiaolong, hurry up and get out of here! Zhou Chen has placed a bounty on your head!” Fang Xuanxuan panicked.

At almost the same instant, Peng Xiao said anxiously, “Don’t bother about us! Just leave! Seek help from Bei Xiaomei! If you don’t leave now, it will be too late!”

Seeing the two ladies so concerned about him, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel a tinge of warmth in his heart. After all, they were persuading him to run away to hide from Zhou Chen instead of saving them.

A smile bloomed on his face, and he shook his head. “I won’t run away and leave the two of you behind.”

The two of them were stunned for a second, and a sweet feeling filled their hearts.

However, just as they were about to persuade him to leave, a loud clap echoed through the air.

They were shocked as they turned to look at the source of the clap, only to see Sun Shihai clapping as he walked into the palace. The remaining hall masters followed behind him.

Sun Shihai had already received reports about Huang Xiaolong’s return, and he quickly gathered all the hall masters he could to rush over to intercept Huang Xiaolong.

When Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao saw all the experts behind Sun Shihai, their expression turned ugly.

“Isn’t this a touching scene?” Sun Shihai glanced at Huang Xiaolong as he chuckled, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re risking your life to act out a show of the hero saving the beauty... However, it’s such a shame...”

He shook his head as he looked at Huang Xiaolong with a pitiful gaze. “It’s a shame you’re going to die here. Don’t worry. I will personally take you down before cutting off your flesh piece by piece before Peng Xiao. Oh right. I’m getting excited, just thinking about your miserable screams!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold back his laughter when he heard Sun Shihai’s delusional thoughts. “Are you so sure you can cut the flesh off my body?”

Sun Shihai felt as though it was the hilarious thing he had heard, and he looked at the four odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong. I know that the four weird monsters behind you are pretty strong. They are probably at the later stages of the Heavenly Monarch Realm, right? You even killed the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s elders with their help. However, do you think that they are a match for hall master Gong Sunchi?

Gong Sunchi was an expert at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. He had even escaped from an early-First Order Emperor Realm cultivator before.

For a Heavenly Monarch to escape from an Emperor, it was something hard to imagine. It was also a testament to Gong Sunchi’s strength.

Huang Xiaolong turned, and his gaze fell onto Gong Sunchi.

Gong Sunchi stepped out suddenly and spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, you better surrender yourself now. As long as you do not resist, I will beg Ancestor Zhou Chen on your behalf. He might spare your life.”

When Huang Xiaolong had entered the Fortune Emperor Palace, his incredible talent had caused Gong Sunchi to fight with the hall master of the Medicinal Hall to take Huang Xiaolong as his disciple. As such, he still had feelings for this could-have-been disciple of his. All he could do was to plead for mercy on his behalf.

Sun Shihai frowned and snapped at Gong Sunchi, “Hall Master Gong, know your place. Huang Xiaolong is a traitor of the Fortune Emperor Palace, and no matter what, no one will be able to change Ancestor Zhou Chen’s mind.” He turned to glare at Huang Xiaolong before continuing, “Huang Xiaolong, don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. As long as you can defeat me, I will ask my master to give you a quick death.”

After he spoke, his aura started to rise, and a loud explosion filled the palace hall.

Late-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Huang Xiaolong felt a little interested, and he raised one of his eyebrows when he looked at Sun Shihai.

He had never thought that Sun Shihai would breakthrough into the Heavenly Monarch Realm while he was away, much less the late-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. It was no wonder he was so confident when speaking to Huang Xiaolong.

Sun Shihai glared at Huang Xiaolong with his bloodshot eyes. Huang Xiaolong had been the biggest smear of his reputation since his appearance. In the past, he had exhausted his potential to defeat Huang Xiaolong. He had cultivated the secret manual Zhou Chen had given him and drained all of his latent potential.

After training without exhaustion, he had finally broken through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm. He had even reached the late-First Order in the past few years.

He wanted to defeat Huang Xiaolong before killing him personally. Otherwise, the hatred in his heart wouldn’t dissipate.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
