Chapter 3010: Huang Long Twin Blades

The Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, Nine-Headed Tree Demon, Feng Ming, Ao Ji, and the others who were trapped in the Sun Moon Furnace were able to see past the restrictions and observe Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation. When they saw how he refined the Holy Dragon Pills and noticed his ever-rising aura, the expressions on their faces turned colorful.

“How… How can he cultivate so quickly?!” Feng Ming couldn’t believe his eyes. “That’s a Holy Dragon Pill!”

Moreover, the speed of which the phoenix flames and nirvana energy descended from the Parasol Tree was several thousand times faster than when Feng Ming personally cultivated under the tree!

He was the Nine-Tailed Phoenix! The Parasol Tree was where he was born…

“I finally know how he managed to increase his strength in the past several hundred years…” The Poison Bodach muttered as his throat went dry.

During the Creation Ceremony, Huang Xiaolong was merely a First Esteem Dao Venerable. He managed to reach the Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm in several hundred years! After defeating the Heart Devourer Twin Devils, he cultivated for a short amount of time before reappearing at the Blue Lotus Pond with the cultivation of a Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable! That was also where most of the experts in the Sun Moon Furnace met Huang Xiaolong!

If they weren’t looking at how he cultivated, they wouldn’t have believed it!

Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed shattered whatever they knew about cultivation! It exceeded the scope of their understanding!

As one Holy Dragon Pill after another disappeared, Huang Xiaolong’s strength continued to rise. It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the peak of the early-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, and he soon entered the mid-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

A little more than a hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.

A golden phoenix the size of a mountain swam around the space about Huang Xiaolong’s body. It would occasionally turn into streams of golden qi, but it would return to its form as a phoenix soon enough.

After so many years, Huang Xiaolong had long since refined all sixty Holy Dragon Pills. He was refining the Heavenly Phoenix Pills of the Heavenly Phoenix Race, but there were only forty of them. Moreover, the effects of the Heavenly Phoenix Pills were less than half of that of the Holy Dragon Pills.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong managed to enter the peak of the late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. He could enter the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm as soon as he took a small step forward.

When Huang Xiaolong finally swallowed the final six Heavenly Phoenix Pills several years later, a horrifying wave of energy appeared in the skies above him. Tribulation clouds appeared in the skies as it covered a gigantic area around the Sun Moon Furnace.

Staring at the tribulation clouds in the air, the experts trapped in the furnace widened their eyes in shock.

“White… White Flame Lightning?!”

“How is it possible for White Flame Lightning to appear in a tribulation?! Isn’t the White Flame Lightning only rumored to exist during the creation of the Huang Long World?!”

Flames that color couldn’t be described appeared among the lightning as traces of ancient light revealed itself.

“Origin Fire?!”

“Light of Creation?!”

When an expert at the peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm mastered all thirteen elements and reached the grand completion level in all of them, a terrifying tribulation would descend on them! If they crossed the tribulation successfully, they would become a God of Creation!

The Origin Fire and Light of Creation would only appear during their tribulation to enter the God of Creation Realm, but now, it appeared during Huang Xiaolong’s tribulation to enter the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

“There’s no way… Did he already experience the might of the White Flame Lightning, Origin Fire, and Light of Creation in his previous tribulations?!” The Nine-Headed Tree Demon stammered.

Silence filled the furnace as the minds of everyone in the Sun Moon Furnace turned blank.

It was no wonder his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth was so disgustingly strong. It was because he used the power of the White Flame Lightning, Origin Fire, and Light of Creation to temper his body! His tribulation was something only Creation Realm experts could enjoy!

Even though the power contained in the tribulation was terrifying, one would be able to experience a large leap in strength as long as they crossed it!

“There’s no way he can withstand the power of the White Flame Lightning, Origin Fire, and Light of Creation…” The Sword Venerable cursed Huang Xiaolong as a sense of jealousy formed in his heart.

“That’s right! The Origin Fire will burn him to nothingness!” Feng Ming and the others quickly added.

…

Opening his eyes slowly, Huang Xiaolong exhaled a stale breath.

More than two hundred years had passed since his tribulation, and it was clear that their curses were completely useless. After he refined the leftover energy from his seventh tribulation, he managed to solidify his foundations even further.

“It’s time for me to open the Blood Dragon Stele…”

Retrieving the Blood Dragon Stele, brilliant rays of golden light lit up his surroundings.

Huang Xiaolong pressed his palm against the stele as he activated the Huang Long Bloodline in him. Circulating the Soaring Dragon Art, he started to refine the Blood Dragon Stele.

With the Soaring Dragon Art and Huang Long Bloodline, he managed to complete the refinement process in several short days. Opening the space within the stele, Huang Xiaolong saw a pair of blades hovering before him. An insignia of the God of Creation, Huang Long, was branded on the body of the blades.

Even though the blades were hovering in the middle of the space contained within the Blood Dragon Stele, Huang Xiaolong could feel prickling sensations on his skin. The terrifying blade light produced by the blades could pierce through anything!

“Huang Long Twin Blades!” Huang Xiaolong yelled happily.

The twin blades were part of the Set of Creation. During the Creation Ceremony, the blades Huang Shuai had were fake!

Grabbing the air before him, the blades started to fly towards Huang Xiaolong. The space contained in the Blood Dragon Stele was shattered when the blades flew through the air. When he finally grabbed onto the handles of the blade, he casually swiped at his finger. Blood sprayed out from his wound and the cut revealed his bones. If not for the fact that he did it casually, his finger would be completely severed!

That was the power of the Huang Long Twin Blades! Nothing could challenge its offensive prowess!

Even his grand dao physique couldn’t stop the twin blades!

“Too strong!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. The more he looked at the twin blades before him, the more he liked them. He started to swing them around as the space around him started to wrap unsteadily.

When he finally decided to stop playing with the blades, he kept them well before turning to look at a golden bottle in another part of the space within the Blood Dragon Stele.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong expected for there to be mountains upon mountains of treasures in the Blood Dragon Stele. He didn’t expect for there to only be two items. Other than the Huang Long Twin Blades, there was only a golden bottle.

Retrieving the golden bottle, he opened the cap cautiously. In an instant, a pillar of golden light charged out from the jade bottle and it nearly blinded him.

When the golden light finally started to fade, Huang Xiaolong peered into the bottle and noticed twenty tiny dragons that resembled the true body of Huang Long himself! Despite looking like living dragons, all of them were medicinal pills! They were medicinal pills that surpassed the creation-level, and it was refined from his father’s cosmos energy and blood essence!

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong could no longer contain the excitement in his heart.

He expected there to be previous treasures in the Blood Dragon Stele, but he didn’t expect for there to be creation-level pills!

The bottle of creation-level pills should be the only bottle in the entire Huang Long World!

Huang Long’s blood essence Huang Xiaolong refined in the past could be considered a treasure that surpassed everything they knew, but a single creation-level pill was several hundred times more valuable than a single drop of blood essence!

Keeping the golden bottle extremely well, Huang Xiaolong left the space contained in the Blood Dragon Stele.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
