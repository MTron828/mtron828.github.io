Huang Xiaolong was amazed to hear that he would be able to forge anything into a space artifact after his cultivation would reach the Emperor Realm; this ability was, um, a little heaven-defying.

Then a thought flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind and he blurted out a question to the little cow, “Then is the whole Divine World a space artifact?”

Not only Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng and the others were dumbfounded, but even the usually nonchalant little cow was dumbfounded by Huang Xiaolong’s unexpected question.

“Are you asking if the Divine World is a spatial artifact forged by a peerless master? Can that be the same with the Devil World, Demonic World, Buddha World, and Hell?” The little cow mumbled.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Since anything in the universe could be forged into a spatial artifact, then, there was a possibility that the Divine World, and similar big worlds were just some spatial artifacts with super space sizes.

The little cow’s head swayed as she contemplated Huang Xiaolong’s question. A while later, she shook her head and said, “I have never thought of this question, but as far as I know, such a thing is not possible. You cannot imagine how big the Divine World really is, and the universe doesn’t have such a powerful master. If the Divine World is really a spatial artifact forged by a master, then that master’s power is too terrifying to even think of.”

Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng nodded in unison, agreeing with the little cow’s opinion, as they also thought that it was impossible.

“Actually, generations of my tribe’s ancestors have felt that the myriad worlds were different spaces created by a great master with supreme godforce.” The little cow said with her head swaying left and right. “But to do that, that master would have needed to integrate certain rules into these spaces, thus forming the Divine World, Devil World, Demonic World, and many other different concept worlds.”

Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and others hadn’t expected to hear that from the little cow. If what she said was real, then what realm would that peerless master have achieved?!

Then the little cow sounded grumpy, “You bunch of kids are too idle, is it? What’s the point of discussing this master, instead, better spend your time cultivating diligently. You can think about this when you’re an Emperor!”

“... Then, inside this Heavenly Python Azure Bovine’s hair... Are there chaos spiritual pills, or spirit stones?” Huang Xiaolong stopped asking about the myriad worlds and changed the subject, diverting it to the cow hair.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest were also curious about what those several Emperors had left behind.

The little cow wiped away her grumpiness with a secretive smile as she said, “There are too many eyes and ears here, so let’s go back and talk.”

Huang Xiaolong and the others had an impulse to turn away from her.

“Then, let’s go buy a residence.” Huang Xiaolong gave the little cow a fierce glare, and then said to the rest.

With that, Huang Xiaolong’s group headed towards the trading houses located at the center of the Brimming Snow City.

“The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace and Fortune Emperor Palace have been here for so many years, but they still haven’t taken away the treasures from the Great Desolate Formation?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking the little cow, on the way to the city center.

“Naturally, the Fortune Emperor Palace and Nine Dragons Emperor Palace have Emperor Realm masters, who are as powerful as the Great Desolate Formation in itself. So two Emperors’ joint efforts could, surely, break the formation, right?

Hearing his question, the little cow chuckled sarcastically, then said with an underlying meaning, “Some treasures can’t be taken relying on your strength. One item is required to activate the Great Desolate Formation!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up instantly like shining beacons as he asked, “Are you referring to that cow hair?!”

Would that cow hair be the key to opening the Great Desolate Formation’s core?!

The little cow chuckled, “Your brain’s not bad, and its reaction speed is quite fast.” There was complacence in her voice.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the others were flabbergasted by the piece of information—that cow hair was actually the key to opening the space at the Great Desolate Formation’s core? Who would have thought of that!

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply, while his heart raced with ecstasy.

Does that mean, as long as he became an Elder of the Fortune Emperor Palace, he could take out the treasures left behind by the several Emperors inside the formation’s space?

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Brimming Snow City’s city center.

“Silver Fox Commerce.” Huang Xiaolong stopped as the name of a splendorous shop caught his attention with an eye-catching silver fox emblem on its signage at the entrance.

There was also a Silver Fox Commerce branch here in the Brimming Snow City!

Huang Xiaolong stopped merely for several seconds before he stepped into the Silver Fox Commerce, with the rest of his group following behind him.

However, Huang Xiaolong was surprised to see a crowd inside the Silver Fox commerce. His gaze swept around the lobby, and he immediately spotted the same group of Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples, following respectfully behind a young man.

This young man had thick eyebrows, big ears, spirited eyes, and he was exuding a strong aura of being born with an imposing air.

And standing beside that young man was a pretty young lady. Naturally, she was Fang Xuanxuan.

Behind Fang Xuanxuan were the same two old women.

That young man was, of course, the so-called Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple. The group of Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples had mentioned him earlier. Huang Xiaolong saw a familiar face beside Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple—the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy who had appeared in Vientiane World to rescue Feng Yingying.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group stepped into the lobby, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s group and Fang Xuanxuan turned to look by reflex, and each of them had a different expression on their faces upon seeing Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“It’s you!”

Two voices exclaimed almost simultaneously. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

One of the voices belonged to the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy Li Qunhao, and the other voice was Fang Xuanxuan’s.

The Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple was caught off guard for a second, then he looked at Huang Xiaolong carefully because clearly, he hadn’tn’t expected Li Qunhao and Fang Xuanxuan to know this black-haired young man.

The group of Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples were the most shocked as they saw Li Qunhao and Fang Xuanxuan knew Huang Xiaolong.

The Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Zhao asked Li Qunhao, “Qunhao, you’re familiar with this friend?”

“Friend?” Li Qunhao glared hatefully at Huang Xiaolong, then respectfully reported to the Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Zhao, “Both he and my Junior Sister Feng Yingying comes from the Vientiane World.” He stole a glance at Fang Xuanxuan before continuing. “He’s a disciple of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch.”

Although Li Qunhao hadn’t mentioned it clearly, Chen Zhao could see from Li Qunhao’s expression that there was a deep grudge between him and this Fortune Emperor Palace’s branch disciple.

Fang Xuanxuan blinked her eyes at Huang Xiaolong and smiled. “Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t expect to see you here. Did you come here because you knew that I was here? What a coincidence. By the way, have you finished eating those Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits you got at the auction?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly at her words. As expected, women were vengeful creatures. He merely won the bid for the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, and so many years had passed since then, but this woman still remembered it.

Also, she knew very well that it was purely a coincidence that they had met there, and he definitely had not come to the Brimming Snow City because of her. She had simply said that to direct the Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Zhao’s hatred onto him.

As Huang Xiaolong had expected, the look in the Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Zhao’s eyes was not so amiable anymore.

“It was a surprise that Miss Fang is in Brimming Snow City. I’m merely passing by the city, and came into the Silver Commerce Fox to purchase a residence, stay a few days, then set off.” Huang Xiaolong stated calmly.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t care what Chen Zhao thought of him, he still clarified his intentions.

“Purchase a residence?” Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Zhao interjected and said to Fang Xuanxuan, “Sister Xuan, does this branch disciple have enough spirit stones to afford a residence in Brimming Snow City?”

In other words, he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong, who was merely a Fortune Emperor Palace’s branch disciple, could afford a Brimming Snow City residence.
