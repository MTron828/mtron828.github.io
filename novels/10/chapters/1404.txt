Longwu Ling Er’s brows creased slightly at Gudu Man’s words. She was not going to rely on Song Rui’s words like Gudu Man, and assume that Huang Xiaolong had really gone amok to attack the Martial Dragon City’s people indiscriminately.

There were too many loopholes in Song Rui’s explanation.

Thus, Longwu Ling Er did not respond to Gudu Man’s words. She looked away and her eyes caught sight of the four Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders. She exclaimed in surprise. “He has a high-level God King Realm master by his side?”

Gudu Man noticed the four Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders at Longwu Ling Er’s exclamation, and was equally shocked.

“Yes, that big elephant by his side is an Eighth Order God King Realm master!” Song Rui confirmed.

In Song Rui’s opinion, only an Eighth Order God King Realm master could parry the Gudu Clan’s four God King Realm Grand Elders’ attacks in a single strike.

Longwu Ling Er and Gudu Man nearly staggered at his words.

Eighth Order God King Realm Master!

The fact that Xiang Xun was an Eighth Order God King Realm master did not shock them as much as the fact that Huang Xiaolong actually had an Eighth Order God King Realm mount!

What is that black-haired young man’s identity? Both of them wondered about the same thing.

Longwu Ling Er looked in the direction in which Huang Xiaolong’s Giant Shark Flying Ship had left, and she had a feeling that she and that black-haired young man would be meeting again!

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong was completely unaware of what was going on in these two women’s minds. By this time, the Giant Shark Flying Ship had traveled through the High Martial World’s outer space barrier, and was speeding away in the dark space.

The repaired Giant Shark Flying Ship was twice faster than before, and it was barely raising any ripples or sound as it moved.

After setting the flying ship’s destination to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, Huang Xiaolong left the core formation’s control to Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng, increasing the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s speed.

Whereas he went inside a cultivation room and began cultivating.

Since Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had reached late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm, he was aiming to break through to Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm. This would allow him to condense low-grade eight spirit stones.

Using low grade-eight spirit stones to fuel the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s core formation would further raise the flying ship’s speed. Even though this increase in the speed was not as significant, it might still enable him to return to the Vientiane World one or two years earlier.

Huang Xiaolong sat down cross-legged, upon entering the cultivation room number one. He summoned his three avatars and formed the four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation.

Subsequently, a spark of lightning appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead as a Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit flew out. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Like before, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars began cultivating with the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. The Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s fire element energy roiled, and filled the whole cultivation room in a sea of flames.

Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars were submerged under the roiling flames.

Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness slowly slipped away due to the waves of scorching pain. He continued to absorb the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s fire element energy purely based on his instincts.

The first time Huang Xiaolong had refined a Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit, the scorching pain had lasted for a month, before diminishing gradually. This time around, it subsided in twenty days; the time had greatly shortened.

As the pain diminished, Huang Xiaolong was once again enveloped inside a cocoon of comfortable warm feeling.

Huang Xiaolong felt completely relaxed. So did his three avatars.

A month later, the one hundred fire phoenixes’ spirits around the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit entered Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ bodies one by one.

Two months later, the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s fire element energy was completely absorbed by Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars, while the fruit turned into ashes and disappeared from the world.

Huang Xiaolong had taken more than three months to refine the first Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit, but for the second Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit, it had taken him a little over two months.

As Huang Xiaolong’s strength kept improving, so did his refining speed.

Huang Xiaolong did not stop after he finished refining the second Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit. Another spark of lightning flashed from Huang Xiaolong’s forehead and the third Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit appeared in front of him.

Subsequently, when the third Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit disappeared from the word, Huang Xiaolong took out the fourth one.

Likewise he moved from the fourth to the fifth Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit.

Nine months later, Huang Xiaolong had finished refining the fifth Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit. During this time a light suddenly shone out of Huang Xiaolong’s body, accompanied by muffled crackling noises.

Huang Xiaolong’s various elements godforce lit up every corner of the cultivation room. It glimmered like waves, and whispered an unidentifiable music that resembled ancient drums, or the roars of a thousand divine beasts. It was also accompanied by the long cries of the phoenixes, and the clashes of swords from an ancient battlefield.

This went on for days.

However, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars were still submerged in the waves of lights.

A surreal blue dragon coiled in the air; archdevils gathered; and meditating golden Buddhas appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. Primordial divine dragon, archdevil, and golden Buddha appeared behing his respective avatars.

The three avatars’ primordial divine dragon, archdevil, and golden Buddha had the same aura as Huang Xiaolong’s main body, yet they were slightly different at the same time. It was as if the three avatars’ manifestations were still in their infancy, but would surpass the main body’s once they matured...

Another ten days passed before Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and stood up. Popping noises came from his bones, and it resembled the rumbling divine thunder shaking the world.

Finally, he had broken through to Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm!

Even though it was only Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help feeling a little excited.

Was his current strength four to five times stronger than the time he had left the High Martial World?

Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads spun at high speed, and godforce roared throughout his body as he punched out. Fist force passed through the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s body towards the vast space outside, forming a river of energy fluctuations. The fist force struck an uninhabited planet in the far distance, and then rumbled—! A big pit appeared on the surface of the uninhabited planet.

This pit was bottomless, with spider-web crack lines at its edges.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his fist, and nodded with satisfaction at the result.

With his current power he could now defeat anyone under Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm.

After this, Huang Xiaolong headed to the flying ship’s control hall.

“Congratulations, Master!” Since Huang Xiaolong had not concealed his cultivation, Xiang Xun, and void devil beast Xu Baisheng could tell that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm.

One could imagine their astonishment at Huang Xiaolong’s break through to Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm.

How long has it been since Huang Xiaolong broke through to Ancestor God Realm? It seems... less than a decade!

A decade!

Now, Huang Xiaolong’s already Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm!

Even though Xiang Xun was astounded, excitement and hope sprouted in his heart. If Master’s cultivation speed continues at this rate, it won’t be long before he breaks through God King Realm. At that time, he can resolve the petrification seals inside my body!

Huang Xiaolong asked the two of them, “What is our current location?”

“Master, we have reached the Fire and Ice World. We can reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds in roughly four years with this speed!” Xiang Xun replied respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong said with a little bit disappointment, “Roughly four years? That’s still too slow.” Subsequently, he twirled his fingers in the air, and Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng saw spirit stones raining down from the void. All these spirit stones were low grade-eight spirit stones!
