The shop supervisor was dazed for a minute at Huang Xiaolong’s words, then he slowly turned his neck, looking at the shop workers under his charge.

Under the supervisor’s gaze, the surrounding shop workers became ashen, large beads of sweat trickled down their foreheads, involuntarily trembling. The leader was stammering in fear, “Su-Supervisor, w-we...”

The supervisor released a loud roar at them, “You bunch of good-for-nothing dogs, roll over here for me! Immediately apologize to this Young Master!”

Petrified by the supervisor’s anger, all the shop workers scrambled to stand in front of Huang Xiaolong, falling to their knees without any hesitation, apologizing over and over again.

An eyebrow rose up as he watched this group of workers, “Forget it.”

Only after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words did the supervisor shoo the shop workers away.

After the group of shop workers left, Huang Xiaolong pointed at Zhuo Wenting, asking the supervisor, “Is she an Elder of your shop?”

No doubt, the supervisor recognized Zhuo Wenting. Although he didn’t know why Huang Xiaolong asked such a question, the supervisor still answered truthfully, “She is not.”

Huang Xiaolong snickered, “I thought she was one of your shop’s Elders since she was the one who ordered your shop workers to throw us out.”

The supervisor blanked for a moment and hesitated. He understood the underlying meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words, but even so, Zhuo Wenting was their shop’s frequent patron, not to mention the fact that her status wasn’t low.

While the supervisor was struggling, his eyes caught sight of the pile of ten million pieces top heaven grade spirit stones and brightened. In the next second, he walked toward Zhuo Wenting.

When Zhuo Wenting saw the supervisor walk toward her, her face paled.

“Madame Wenting, if there’s nothing else, kindly leave the premise for the day.” The supervisor spoke courteously.

But Zhuo Wenting did not care, pointing her finger at the supervisor’s face, “Good, good, you’d better remember this, I’ll definitely make you pay!” Throwing out that sentence, she flicked her sleeves and stormed toward the exit. When she passed by Huang Xiaolong, her gaze was filled with fury and hatred, “You bunch of dog slaves, don’t think just because you’ve got your hands on some cultivation cave treasure, that you’re so great with some money in your hands. I will make sure you understand that there are some people you cannot afford to offend even if you’re wealthy!”

But, just as she was about to step out of the shop, whether it was by pure coincidence or otherwise, she tripped over the threshold, falling face first to the floor.

Watching this, the Huang Family snickered out loud.

Huang Xiaolong turned around to face the Huang Family, “Since everyone is so happy today, if you see anything you like, just buy it. If we don’t spend these ten million top heaven grade spirit stones, we’re not leaving!”

Only leave after spending ten million top heaven grade spirit stones!

These words buzzed ceaselessly like a beehive in the surrounding family disciples and wealthy madames’ minds.

Zhuo Wenting had just climbed up from the ground, but as if Huang Xiaolong’s words startled her greatly, her legs went weak, slumping to the ground once more.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong announce that they would leave only after spending the ten million pieces of top heaven grade spirit stones, the supervisor bowed so low before Huang Xiaolong’s group that he was barely at chest height, making people wonder if he went through strenuous exercise the night before and hurt his waist.

Those rich madames around immediately began to send flirtatious looks in Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaohai, and the other menfolk’s direction. A more daring madame approached Huang Xiaolong, speaking in a coy voice, “My name is Meng Xiaojiao, may I know how to address this Young Master?”

Huang Xiaolong did not answer, but the Ascending Moon Old Man beside him grinned sheepishly, “Little miss, I’m surnamed Xiao, name Bailian.”

The young madame was startled, then recited the name in one breath: “Xiao Bailian.” [1]

The Huang Family nearly burst out laughing.

Huang Xiaolong hid his smile in a head shake, this old man’s face was thicker than the average people. Taking a glance at the Ascending Moon Old Man’s wrinkle-filled face, almost as black as charcoal, if a face this like could be called ‘little white face’ then this world would be filled with pretty men everywhere.

With the matter settled, everyone began looking around for things they liked. After going through the front hall, inner hall, as well as the shop’s special collections, they finally achieved the task Huang Xiaolong set out, spending the ten million pieces of top heaven grade spirit stones. What made Huang Xiaolong speechless was that the old man also chose more than a hundred ornaments. According to the old man, it would be a waste not spending his disciple’s money.

After spending the ten million top heaven grade spirit stones, Huang Xiaolong led everyone out of the shop.

Long after Huang Xiaolong’s group had left, the supervisor gradually straightened his back with a beaming face. In his mind, he could already imagine how the upper management was going to reward him after knowing the large business today.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s group in the distance, he firmly believed he had made the right choice today. As for that Zhou Wenting, whether she would bear a grudge toward him or not, he didn’t mind in the slightest.

Huang Xiaolong’s group went on, shop by shop. Piles after piles of grade one, heaven grade, and even saint grade spirit stones were spent. To the current Huang Xiaolong, both spirit stones and Xuanwu coins were mere numbers, just a concept.

What he needed now was divine grade spirit stones and above. Those grade one, heaven grade, and even saint grade spirit stones were no different than useless garbage.

When he was still a Sixth Order God Realm, he could already condense heaven grade spirit stones, and now that he was a Seventh Order God Realm, he was able to form saint grade spirit stones. Following this, by the time he broke through to Tenth Order God Realm, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he would be able to condense divine grade spirit stones.

After a full day of shopping, by dusk fall, everyone returned to the Luo Tong Residence. Ever since the Huang Family moved to the Golden Dragon Peak, the residence had been empty most of the time.

Returning this time, everyone felt a silent lament.

Huang Xiaolong arranged for food to be sent over from a nearby restaurant to the Luo Tong Residence. Sitting in the main hall, the Huang Family had a joyous meal and did not disperse until the moon hung high in the night sky.

The night passed without events as the sun gradually rose on the horizon.

By the time Huang Xiaolong appeared in the main hall, Xie Puti was already there in a clean set of brocade robes. The cup on the table was already empty, it was clear that Xie Puti had drunk his fill from nervousness.

Watching this side of Xie Puti, Huang Xiaolong felt like laughing. This kid had never been afraid of anything, yet he was so nervous now.

Noticing Huang Xiaolong walking in, Xie Puti literally jumped up from his seat.

“Are you alright?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Xie Puti smiled awkwardly, “I’m alright.”

“Let’s go then.” Huang Xiaolong said. Both men left the Luo Tong Residence, but before leaving, Huang Xiaolong informed his parents as well as the Ascending Moon Old Man.

From the Luo Tong Residence, they headed straight to the agreed meeting place.

“In this Manqin Restaurant?” Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong asked as both of them stood at the entrance of a big restaurant.

Xie Puti nodded, confirming the location. This was the place he and the other party first met.

Without further delay, they stepped inside, heading up to the first floor where a private room had been reserved. After knocking on the door, a clear voice sounded from inside the room: “Please come in.”

The door opened and both men stepped inside.

However, when Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti saw the two women sitting inside the room, both were surprised and shocked, for one of them was the woman they had a conflict with yesterday—Zhuo Wenting.

When Zhuo Wenting saw Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti, her delicate face turned sullen in an instant. The murderous gaze in her eyes was cold enough to lower the room’s temperature by several degrees. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The beautiful young woman beside her noticed Zhou Wenting’s strange reaction, asking curiously, “Sister, are you alright?”

Xie Puti felt like his brain exploded on the spot; sister?! This Zhuo Wenting was actually her sister!
