Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, he appeared at the Black Warrior City’s transmission array.

He lost the mood to stroll around the city after what happened.

Passing through the transmission array, Huang Xiaolong stepped out onto the Black Warrior Institute’s soil. He headed straight toward his Master Feng Yang’s manor, however, upon arriving, he was informed by the disciples guarding outside that Feng Yang had already entered seclusion. Huang Xiaolong could only leave in low spirits.

From there, he made a quick trip to his Golden Dragon Peak.

Everything on the Golden Dragon Peak was as he left it last time. It seems that after he taught He Zhiwu and He Fei a lesson, that old witch Wang Na had wisely kept her toes behind the line.

After a brief stop at the Golden Dragon Peak, Huang Xiaolong went to Liu Yun’s dwelling.

When he saw Huang Xiaolong, Liu Yun’s mouth spread into a wide grin, “Junior Apprentice-brother, you’re back!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, a smile on his face.

Liu Yun happily wrapped an arm around Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders, leading him into the hall. As they walked, he asked Huang Xiaolong about Saint Mother Yao Chi’s legacy.

Toward Liu Yun, Huang Xiaolong had always been quite frank and open, telling him that he had already received the Yaochi Sect’s successor token.

Hearing this, Liu Yun enthusiastically congratulated Huang Xiaolong. Then, he took out several jugs of good wine that he had been saving so the two of them brothers could drink to their heart’s content in celebration of Huang Xiaolong’s successful inheritance of Saint Mother Yao Chi’s legacy.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand saying, “Senior Apprentice-brother please taste this Heavenly Pill wine that I personally brewed.” Two jugs of Heavenly Pill Wine appeared in his hand.

“Heavenly Pill Wine?” Liu Yun’s eyes showed his bemusement.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong already uncorked the two jugs of Heavenly Pill Wine, instantly filling the hall with a tantalizing wine fragrance.

Liu Yun was stunned at first, then his gaze turned hot. He still didn’t know what this Heavenly Pill Wine was, however, just from its fragrance, he was absolutely certain that it was good stuff.

Liu Yun was itching to get a taste, swiftly accepting the jug that Huang Xiaolong offered, gulping down a mouthful. The liquid glided smoothly over his taste buds and down his throat. The wine fragrance permeated his mouth with a lingering aftertaste. Multiple strands of warm energy spread from the depth of his body, feeling extremely comfortable.

“Junior Apprentice-brother, this Heavenly Pill Wine...!” Liu Yun stared at Huang Xiaolong with amazement.

This was the best wine he had ever tasted in his lifetime, even the Royal Pill Wine which was said to be the best wine in the four galaxies lost a point compared to Huang Xiaolong’s Heavenly Pill Wine.

Huang Xiaolong had expected this reaction from Liu Yun, laughing as he said, “I used a thousand different kinds of saint grade divine pellets to brew this Heavenly Pill Wine, but it’s different from the Royal Pill Wine, for I added a number of sacred grade divine pellets into it. Of course, the brewing method is also different, I used my own specially developed method!”

Liu Yun was genuinely shocked, “One thousand different kinds of saint grade spirit pellets, and a number of sacred grade divine pellets!” Then, just the cost of this Heavenly Pill Wine was close to a hundred million?!

Liu Yun suddenly felt that the wine jug in his hands was extremely heavy.

A moment later, he smiled wryly. Most likely only his Junior Apprentice-brother could afford to brew and drink this wine, even the four institutes’ Principals couldn’t afford to enjoy a jug of wine that cost a hundred million.

“How’s the taste?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Worthy of its heavenly name.” Liu Yun answered. “If this Heavenly Pill Wine claimed to be second, no other wine would dare to claim the top spot.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “If Senior Apprentice-brother likes it, I still have a few jugs here, they’re all yours.”

Liu Yun beamed. Not acting modest with Huang Xiaolong, he accepted those several jugs of Heavenly Pill Wine and put them away into his spatial ring with swift movements, as if afraid that someone would snatch them away from him.

Following that, the two of them continuously clinked their wine cups.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother, the matter about you and Third Apprentice-sister, how is it now?”

Liu Yun’s smile froze on his face at Huang Xiaolong’s question, his face crestfallen. His mouth opened and closed, but no words came.

Watching Liu Yun’s reaction, a tiny frown furrowed Huang Xiaolong’s mouth forehead, “Did the Qi Ancestor go back on his word?!” His eyes gleamed as he asked this.

Liu Yun shook his head, explaining, “After we returned from the Yaochi Mountain, your Third Apprentice-sister and I immediately left to see the Qi Family Ancestor. When he saw the twenty-thousand high divine grade spirit stones, he already agreed to rescind Qi Wen’s betrothal with Zhu Family, but the Zhu Family’s side...” His voice trailed off.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, despite Liu Yun having left his words hanging, but Huang Xiaolong had already guessed what problem was; the Zhu Family’s Ancestor!

Huang Xiaolong’s tone turned somber, “Since the Qi Family Ancestor has already agreed to rescind the betrothal with the Zhu Family, it’s not the Zhu Family’s place to disagree, right? What’s the reason for Zhu Family Ancestor to disagree?”

Liu Yun’s smile reflected the bitterness in his heart, “The year when the Qi and Zhu Families’ Ancestors set the betrothal, both sides had signed a blood contract. Unless both sides unanimously agree to dissolve the marriage, with the blood contract being in the Zhu Family Ancestor’s hand...”

Huang Xiaolong’s frown became deeper, “Did the Zhu Family Ancestor say under what conditions would he agree to dissolve the marriage?”

Liu Yun hesitated before saying, “The Zhu Family Ancestor said he would agree to dissolve it for twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones,” Liu Yun paused then went on, “He also said that he must receive them before the Highgod Advancement Tournament.”

Huang Xiaolong snorted, this Zhu Family Ancestor was basically asking for the moon.

Twenty-thousand high divine grade spirit stones!

This Zhu Family seemed to believe that as his Master Feng Yang was due to yield the Principal seat, his Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun was just clay that he could squash and mold as they liked?

“Senior Apprentice-brother, come on, we’re making a trip to the Zhu Family’s main manor!” Irritation seeped into Huang Xiaolong’s heart thinking about this and got to his feet.

Liu Yun was flabbergasted: “Junior Apprentice-brother, you, this...”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “It’s only twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones, I can still afford it.” Of course, it depended on whether the Zhu Family was capable of taking them from his hands.

“But...” Liu Yun dithered.

It was already a favor bigger than heaven the last time Huang Xiaolong gave him twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones, how could he be so thick-faced to have Huang Xiaolong tape out another twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones?

This was also why, all these years, he had never gone to the Yaochi Mountain to visit Huang Xiaolong. Even when Huang Xiaolong came over, he did not bring up the matter.

“Rest assured, Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother, forget twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones, even if it’s two hundred thousand high divine grade spirits stone, I still have them. Come, let’s go.” Watching Liu Yun’s expression, he understood what Liu Yun was thinking about, thus persuaded.

In the end, Liu Yun could only nod. He and Huang Xiaolong left the Black Warrior Institute in the direction of the Zhu Family’s New Stone World.

Stepping out from the New Stone World’s transmission array, Huang Xiaolong and Liu Yun did not dally elsewhere, directly heading to the New Stone City, where the Zhu Family’s main manor was located.

At this time, within the Zhu Family Manor’s great hall, the Zhu Family’s Patriarch, Zhu Chu, and other masters of the family were gathered with grim faces looking at the cold corpse on the floor that was Zhu Wuhou.

“Huang Xiaolong is intolerable, he isn’t putting our Zhu Family in his eyes at all!” A Zhu Family Grand Elder seethed. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Patriarch, this matter cannot be allowed to end like this!” Another Grand Elder raised his voice in anger, “One should pay with a life for a life, we cannot let that Huang Xiaolong off just because he’s the personal disciple of the Ascending Moon Old Man and the Black Warrior Institute Principal!”

“That’s right, we should storm the Black Warrior Institute and demand that Feng Yang hand Huang Xiaolong to us!”

“Kill Huang Xiaolong, skin him alive!’

The Zhu Family’s Grand Elders were outraged.
