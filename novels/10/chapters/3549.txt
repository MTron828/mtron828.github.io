Chapter 3550: Eliminate Huang Xiaolong

 

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong nodded slowly.

Lin Tong continued, “That’s right. We only discovered Mei Jie’s true intention after he left for the Unknown Lands! The Universe Sphere and Cosmos Sphere are two parts of the Universe Orb, and one will be able to locate the Universe Boat after obtaining it. With the Universe Boat, one will be able to comprehend the laws in order to ascend to the Universe God level! We cannot allow the cosmos sphere to land in their hands.”

“Otherwise, the Creation Palace will sweep through the thirteen universes, becoming a true overlord!” A look of worry flashed in Lin Tong’s eyes.

Chen Yizhen sighed, “Even if Mei Jie only manages to obtain the cosmos sphere, he will be able to comprehend the universe laws contained within. His strength will take a huge leap forward, and he’ll break through to the peak of the grand completion stage! When that happens, he’ll be unstoppable!” 

Mei Jie was terrifying enough at his current level. If he broke through, his strength would more than double! He would be able to suppress the entire Eternal Heaven Alliance by himself!

“Since the cosmos sphere has appeared, the universe sphere should show itself soon. We have to obtain the cosmos sphere before anything else happens!” Lin Tong added.

Huang Xiaolong felt his heart trembling slightly in response.

Soon after, they explained several matters regarding the Unknown Lands including the regions he had to take note of.

Several moments later, Huang Xiaolong left the main hall to return to his palace. He told Wang Meiqi and the others about the cosmos sphere, and he instructed them to prepare themselves to leave for the Unknown Lands.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the word, ‘universe’, on the mysterious scale he obtained previously.

That should be the universe sphere they were talking about! Huang Xiaolong had his guesses, but he only confirmed his guesses after the meeting with Lin Tong and Chen Yizhen.

“Cosmos sphere…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He had to obtain the cosmos sphere when he entered the Unknown Lands. If he managed to combine both spheres, he could locate the universe boat! When that happened, he wouldn’t be afraid of Mei Jie!

The Universe Boat contained the highest laws of the universe! It was the most precious treasure in the thirteen universes! Nothing could match up to its speed! With the Universe Boat, Mei Jie couldn’t hunt Huang Xiaolong down even if he wanted to!

Sitting down, Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the universe laws in the universe sphere. Due to the complexity of the universe laws, Huang Xiaolong could only comprehend one ten-thousandth of the laws contained in the universe sphere after spending so much time. Even if he had hundreds of millions of years, he would find it difficult to understand the mysteries contained within.

The night passed quickly.

Huang Xiaolong only noticed the rays of sunshine on him when Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi interrupted his cultivation.

Retrieving the universe sphere, he slowly got to his feet.

Huang Xiaolong might not have understood much of the universe laws contained in the universe sphere, but the treasure had already fused into his body. No one would be able to discover its presence.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived in the main hall, everyone in the Eternal Heaven Alliance had already arrived.

More than four hundred of them were present.

“Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are to make all of us wait?” Tao Shi sneered in contempt. “You even made the leaders of our alliance wait for you.” 

“There’s still a minute left until the appointed time. If you’re anxious to leave, you can head there alone,” Huang Xiaolong muttered in response.

“You!” Tao Shi roared with rage.

He was silenced by Chen Yizhen, who waved his hand in the air to stop the petty squabbles. “Enough. All of us here are brothers of the same alliance. It might not be the time we said we were going to set off at, but since everyone is here, we can leave.”

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong took the lead and entered the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s flying ship and everyone else followed closely behind.

“Your Highness, Tao Shi is messing with you, time and time again! Should I teach him a good lesson?” Ao Shenghai’s voice rang softly in Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

“We’ll get our chance.” 

As the flying ship was activated, it turned into a streak of light that disappeared into the space above.

The Eternal Heaven Alliance’s flying ship was a high-grade creation artifact, and it was infinitely close to a top-grade creation artifact. It was much faster than Huang Xiaolong’s Purple Lightning Peak.

Looking at the stars that they passed, Huang Xiaolong decided that he would refine all the treasures left behind by Ao Ying and the others to turn the Purple Lightning Peak into a high-grade creation artifact as soon as he could.

After all, Ao Ying and the others got a high-grade creation artifact to hunt Huang Xiaolong down. Now everything belonged to Huang Xiaolong.

Ordinarily, no one would be crazy enough to melt down a high-grade flying ship into a mid-grade one. However, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less.

Since they needed three to four months to arrive in the Unknown Lands, Huang Xiaolong hid in one of the cultivation caves in the flying ship to continue comprehending the universe laws.

“Your Highness, the intelligence of the cosmos sphere has already been leaked. The Solitary Alliance and Hundred Empire Alliance have mobilized everyone in their alliance to head to the Unknown Lands. Every other Gods of Creation in the First Universe heard the news,” Ao Shenghai made the report. “I heard that Kun Feng, Kai Dong, and Xuan Hong have all entered the Unknown Lands.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. It was no wonder Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong told them the news. If the news hadn’t been leaked, the two alliance leaders wouldn't be kind enough to tell them!” 

“Wouldn’t that mean that a majority of the Gods of Creation in the First Universe went to the Unknown Lands?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think of Jiang Shaoyu.

She probably went with her father to the Unknown Lands.

“Yes, Your Highness… Young Lady Shaoyu left for the Unknown Lands with her father.” Ao Shenghai guessed what Huang Xiaolong was thinking, and he quickly made the report.

Laughing slightly, Huang Xiaolong suddenly thought of something and his tone changed. “What about Ao Wanshan of the Hundred Empire Alliance?” 

There were five experts in the First Universe with the Huang Long Bloodline. The strongest among them was Ao Wanshan of the Hundred Empire Alliance!RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. He had nearly 9.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and he was one of the six leaders of the Hundred Empire Alliance!

The Hundred Empire Alliance might not possess a half-step Universe God, but they had six experts at the peak of the grand completion stage at the God of Creation Realm.

Ao Shenhai was slightly taken aback, but he nodded slowly, “Yes. Everyone in the Hundred Empire Alliance is headed for the Unknown Lands. Your Highness, you need to be careful of Ao Wanshan and those from the Hundred Empire Alliance. I heard that half of them have the intention to join the Creation Palace… Ao Wanshan is one of the alliance leaders supporting them.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

That wasn’t good news. If the Hundred Empire Alliance were to join the Creation Palace, the Creation Palace would become too strong! When that happened, the Creation Palace would make a move on the Eternal Heaven Alliance.

“However, half of them are against the idea. There’s no need to be too worried,” Ao Shenghai continued.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

When that conversation was happening, Tao Shi and the others were stuck in a discussion about Huang Xiaolong.

“When we enter the Unknown Lands this time, we need to get the Creation Palace to get rid of him!” A cold light flashed in Tao Shi’s eyes.

“It won’t be easy to get rid of him. Not even Ao Ying and the others managed to take him down!” Qian Shaolin shook his head.

“Don't worry. Kun Feng will definitely move against him this time.” Tao Shi snorted. “The Creation Palace wouldn’t miss this chance.”
