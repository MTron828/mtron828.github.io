Chapter 3748: Raining Punches on the Dragon Sage Human Emperor

These Dragon Saint Palace experts coughed up blood as they crashed to the ground.

Both the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source were astonished. The Dragon Sage Human Emperor could barely accept it. After all, he knew Huang Xiaolong took away the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, whereas the dragon soul source was completely ignorant. Therefore, he received a bigger shock watching Huang Xiaolong send several hundreds of Dragon Saint Palace experts flying with a wave of his hand.

Among these several hundreds of Dragon Saint Palace experts, there were existences with twenty-one billion marks battle strength.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t spare those Dragon Saint Palace experts a second glance and further shortened the distance between him and the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. “I don’t like to repeat myself, so hand over the devil mirror fragment.”

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s face turned unsightly as he was the human race’s strongest cultivator!

The second strongest person in the entire Origin Universe!

Since when did someone dare to talk to him so?!

“Dao Brother Huang Xiaolong, we can join hands to suppress the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, and the devil mirror fragment on him will go to you,” the dragon soul source Ao Shan suddenly interjected.

After witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s strength, the dragon soul source was ecstatic.

“Join hands?” Huang Xiaolong glanced at the dragon soul source from the corner of his eye and asked, “Who told you that I would agree to join hands with you?”

The dragon soul source was rendered awkward by Huang Xiaolong’s directness, and anger and humiliation burned in his chest.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor suddenly appeared behind Huang Xiaolong, and he directly stabbed the Dragon Spear towards Huang Xiaolong.

There was only a small distance between the two. On top of that, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor attacked suddenly. Hence the Dragon Spear was mere inches from penetrating Huang Xiaolong’s back.

Right at this time, thirteen spheres of light appeared around Huang Xiaolong.

Zheng!

The Dragon Spear in his hand stabbed into one of the thirteen spheres.

While the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was stunned that his sneak attack failed, he was knocked back by the repelling power from the thirteen light spheres.

The dragon soul source was just as shocked as the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

Not only Huang Xiaolong was fine after taking a blow from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, but the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was sent staggering backward instead!

Probably the Origin Universe’s number one expert also wouldn’t be able to do this, right?

The dragon soul source looked at the thirteen spheres around Huang Xiaolong that were exactly the mini versions of the Thirteen Universes with each one containing supreme universe esoterics and laws.

“These are?!” The Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source exclaimed in astonishment.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder as he fixed his icy gaze on the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, “Originally, I merely wanted you to hand out the devil mirror fragment, but unfortunately, you forced me to act.”

Huang Xiaolong’s Universe Transformation Art had already reached great perfection state for he had thoroughly comprehended the nameless devil mirror’s Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws.

It was no exaggeration to say that with Huang Xiaolong’s current battle strength, even if the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source joined hands against him, they were no match against Huang Xiaolong.

After saying that, Huang Xiaolong stepped towards the Dragon Sage Human Emperor at a slow pace, however, every step he took, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s heart tightened a notch.

As Huang Xiaolong got closer, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor felt suffocated.

This was the kind of feeling he got when in awe while looking at an indomitable great mountain. No, more accurately, Huang Xiaolong was an avatar of the Universe’s heaven and earth, whereas he was merely a lowly existence in the universe, the same like many others.

How is this possible?

At this moment, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s heart actually gave birth to fear.

Even when facing Yuan Fang, he did not give birth to apprehension, much less fear. But now, he felt genuine fear towards a human race’s junior.

Amidst his fear, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor let out a roar to the sky, and soundwaves of a dragon’s roar shook the air. With a wave of his hand, he sent the Dragon Soul Bind towards Huang Xiaolong while yelling at the dragon soul source, “Ao Shan, we’ll join hands and deal with him. If I lose here, you won’t fare much better because Huang Xiaolong definitely won’t let you off!”

Ao Shan was caught off guard by the proposal.

But in the next second, he snickered, “Even if I won’t fare well, I would rather watch you being abused to death!”

A while ago, he was nearly captured by the Dragon Sage Human Emperor to be absorbed. As forgiving as he might be, it hadn’t reached the point where he would cooperate with the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor was infuriated upon hearing that.

The thirteen light spheres around Huang Xiaolong flew up and rammed against the Dragon Soul Bind. With the thirteen spheres circling around, the Dragon Soul Bind’s thousands of divine dragons were pulverized and scattered away.

The golden rope that was connected from head to tail to form a circle was cut into several sections, and it scattered all over.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor paled visibly.

The Dragon Soul Bind was something he had put a lot of effort and time in, as well as the effort of many experts in the Dragon Saint Palace, but it got cut into pieces just like that!

While the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was in the cusp of panic, Huang Xiaolong punched out with his fist.

When Huang Xiaolong punched out, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor had a fleeting feeling that there were thirteen universes slamming towards him.

He didn’t have time to think too much, and he hollered as he gathered every shred of cosmos energy in his body. Glaring light burst out from his palms and shot straight at Huang Xiaolong.

It was obvious that the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was desperate.

But it was futile. As Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed, the Dragon Spear broke into several sections, and even the dragon head handle of the spear shattered.

Huang Xiaolong’s fist force finally landed on the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor tumbled in the air like a broken kite to the horizon.

A long time later, someone reacted.

“Your Highness Dragon Sage Human Emperor!”

The Dragon Saint Palace’s experts shouted, their voices filled with despair.

In a single step, Huang Xiaolong arrived where the Dragon Sage Human Emperor fell. His punch had broken several of the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s ribs, causing his chest to cave in, and the dragon qi around him dissipated, revealing his bloody and gravely wounded body.

This was the power of Huang Xiaolong’s thirteen universes.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Horror was written all over the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

A force dragged the Dragon Sage Human Emperor off the ground. Huang Xiaolong sealed the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s strength, and returned to the previous spot in a flicker.

……

Before long, the news spread about Huang Xiaolong, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, and the disappearance of the experts of Dragon Saint Palace.

“It is said that Huang Xiaolong tried to snatch the dragon soul source from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, and the Dragon Sage Human Emperor killed Huang Xiaolong. He then got the dragon soul source and entered seclusion!” said a family’s old ancestor.

“Didn’t I say it earlier, that Huang Xiaolong is practically seeking death to try to snatch the dragon soul source from His Majesty!”

For a period of time, rumors flew about.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know about the rumors flying outside. At this time, Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged in the depths of Dragon Soul Mountain, and there was a devil mirror fragment suspended in front of him. This was the piece of devil mirror fragment the Dragon Sage Human Emperor obtained from the Devil Mirror Palace.

This piece of devil mirror fragment was made of the same material as Huang Xiaolong’s nameless devil mirror. His full attention was on the piece of devil mirror fragment, and from the mirror surface, he could see flashes of images like what he saw in the nameless devil mirror in the beginning. However, the images on this devil mirror fragment were incomplete.

Sitting there, Huang Xiaolong was as still as he could be, comprehending the devil mirror fragment. In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of years went by, stopping only when it was almost time for the Devil Mirror Palace to open.
