Chapter 2494: Lucky B*stard!

Xiao Lengxue was in fifth place and You Lingzi from the Ghost Talisman Holy Gate was sixth. Ji Xinyi finally appeared in the seventh place in the leaderboard and Bai Buren of the Holy Lands Alliance took the eighth spot. Dou Rui was ninth, and Sai Qian from the Vajra Race was tenth.

Everyone was shocked when they noticed She Nanfeng on the fourth spot.

No one had heard of him before, but his strength seemed to have surpassed Xie Bufan. He could be said to be stronger than most of the genius disciples in the younger generation of the Holy World! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After Xiao Baili, the Holy Race had actually managed to nurture another genius, She Nanfeng! Even though no one knew how talented he was, it was clear that he wouldn’t defer too much from Xiao Baili!

Even though the competition had only started and the ranking wasn’t set in stone, one could easily see the terrifying combat prowess of those on the board.

Bai Buren and Sai Qian also managed to draw attention to themselves.

“Bai Buren… It seems like the Holy Lands Alliance has finally managed to nurture a genius.” Cao Nan nodded slowly.

Not many people could be acknowledged by a Primal Ancestor, and Bai Buren was pretty good if Cao Nan would praise him.

Su Biqing of the Devil Palace was eleventh, and Xia Yao of the Holy Heavens ranked twenty-third. Li Yijia was twenty-ninth, and Chen Kaiping was in the thirty-eighth spot. Since Lin Xiaoying had only cultivated for a short period of time and hadn’t obtained a Saint Fate, she could only sit in the ninety-sixth rank.

Huai Po was one position behind Lin Xiaoying, in the ninety-seventh rank.

There were more than a hundred and thirty True Saints in the Trial of Blood. It was an achievement in itself for a peak Ninth Tribulation Half Saint like Lin Xiaoying to enter the top hundred ranks.

After sweeping through the top hundred names, Cao Nan turned to Tyrant Chu and laughed sinisterly, “Tyrant Chu, Even Lin Xiaoying and Huai Po managed to climb into the top hundred. They’re pretty good… Wasn’t your disciple bragging about entering the top ten? Am I wrong or am I blind? Why don’t I see his name?”

Tyrant Chu could only sneer softly, “The trial has barely started. The ranks won’t matter now. There’s a chance for all the disciples of the Devil Palace to die in the city.”

Tyrant Chu’s provocation was clear.

A frosty light flashed in Cao Nan’s eyes, but he suppressed his anger. “I was just thinking about that. I hope that the members of your Holy Heavens can return unscathed. Especially Huang Xiaolong… Isn’t he just a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint? I hope he’s strong enough to face the challenges in the city.”

The two of them sparred verbally, and none of them lost their ground.

Even though everyone around them heard the argument, they didn’t dare to interrupt.

The grudge between Tyrant Chu and Mo Cangli was known by all, and they seemed to have a personal vendetta against each other. However, the enmity between Cao Nan and Tyrant Chu had already surpassed that level. The hatred they had for each other was built through several billion years.

When Xue Lingyun heard their squabbles, she couldn’t help but look at them helplessly.

The only person who felt entertained was the Old Man Cangqiong. They were like two kids fighting with each other over a candy, and he chuckled to himself as he watched their ‘battle’ in amusement. No matter what, no one could deny that Tyrant Chu and Cao Nan were kids compared to the Cangqiong Old Man.

All of a sudden, the Cangqiong Old Man’s eyes flashed, and he stared at the tablet in the middle of the plaza with interest.

Xue Lengyun wouldn’t miss the change in her master’s face, and she turned to stare at the jade plaque. “Huang… HUANG XIAOLONG?!”

She thought that she had read the name wrong, and she rubbed her eyes in doubt. The person who had appeared on the ranking stele was Huang Xiaolong!

Even though there were more than a million disciples in the city right now, the jade stele only recorded the names of the top one thousand disciples.

Anyone whose name could appear on the board had a cultivation level of a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint!

After all, there were more than two thousand Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints who took part in the trial.

There were tons of them who were crowded out due to their lackluster performance, but Huang Xiaolong’s name actually appeared on the stele!

On the 996th position, clear markings indicated, “Holy Heavens, Huang Xiaolong!”

Tyrant Chu, Cao Nan, Mo Cangli, Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Bai Moyang, Jin Nu of the Vajra Race, Gui Buwang of the Ghost Talisman Holy Gate, Zhan Zhiyuan, and the others quickly noticed the anomaly.

They widened their eyes in shock.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had three saint Godheads and the Holy Mandate Imprint, he was only a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint! No matter how strong he was, no one felt that he could defeat a Ninth Tribulation Half Saint. After all, anyone who could enter the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm in a hundred thousand years probably had terrifying talent and decent combat abilities.

Not a single person present could remain calm.

Tyrant Chu finally revealed a smile as his chest loosened up. The brat didn’t let him down. Even though he ranked in the nine hundreds, it was a feat to appear on the board with his cultivation level. If the news got out, no one would laugh at Huang Xiaolong. After all, it was already a miracle for a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint to enter the leaderboards.

“Heh, isn’t that just the nine hundred ranks? Look at yourself…,” Cao Nan couldn’t help but sneer when he saw the smile on Tyrant Chu’s face. “Do you really think that he can keep this up? He will probably fall out of the rankings in a minute. He’s just lucky to be ranked in the top thousand.”

Before he was done, Huang Xiaolong’s name disappeared from its spot. Rising by a few positions, he replaced the name in the 995th position.

Tyrant Chu snickered. “He’s pretty lucky! That’s my boy!” His gaze couldn’t help but shi+ft onto Xie Bufan’s place. “Look at your disciple. He’s probably in the third position because of his luck. Shouldn’t he be ranked in the seventh or eighth place?”

The Devil Palace was confident that Xie Bufan would be able to fight for the top spot after his cultivation in the Death Cave. However, looking at the ranking chart, it seemed as though something was wrong. Cao Nan couldn’t help but feel a sense of irritation in his heart. When he heard that his disciple could only obtain his current achievement because of luck, he nearly exploded in rage.

Soon after, everyone realized that Huang Xiaolong’s name was rising in the ranks every minute.

“994!”

“994!”

…

“990!”

Every time his name climbed up in a rank, everyone screamed in fright. In several short minutes, he climbed by six ranks.

An hour quickly passed and Huang Xiaolong’s rank was no longer as low as it was.

“8… 899?!”

“He has already broken past the nine hundred ranks!” Someone in the crowd screamed.

A commotion broke through the crowd in an instant.

Initially, no one had faith that Huang Xiaolong would last through the trial, much less make it through. Even someone like Xue Lingyun believed that he had entered the ranking charts due to his luck. However, he had managed to climb into the 899th rank in a short hour! Xue Lingyun was shocked, and the faces of those, who hated Huang Xiaolong with a passion, couldn’t be described.

Even Tyrant Chu didn’t believe his eyes. He stared at Huang Xiaolong’s name and a single thought flashed in his mind. There’s no way this brat’s luck is so good… right?!
