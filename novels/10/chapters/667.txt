Zhang Han, Chen Yun, and the other Zhang Family experts were stunned, their eyes went wide with disbelief looking at the Zhang Family Elder that was thrown back with a single punch from Huang Xiaolong, especially Zhang Han and Chen Yun. Their hearts missed a beat.

They remembered clearly that the last time they saw Huang Xiaolong, he was just a Fifth Order God Realm!

Yet, now..! How long had it been!

With a clap of his hands, Huang Xiaolong shattered the space shackles that the Zhang Family Elder placed around Shi Xiaofei.

At this time, Zhang Han, Chen Yun, and the rest of the Zhang Family experts finally recovered from their shock. Zhang Han couldn’t care about anything else, as he was the first to turn around, wanting to escape.

Just as Zhang Han, Chen Yun, and Zhang Family experts leaped into the air, Huang Xiaolong’s right-hand fingers curled into claws, ripping across the sky. The Asura Demon Claw cast a shadow over the earth as thousands of ferocious howling demons flew out.

Zhang Han, Chen Yun, and every one of the Zhang Family experts were struck by the Asura Demon Claw, slapping them down to the ground from midair.

Only then did Huang Xiaolong turn to face Shi Xiaofei, his voice clear and resolute: “It’s fine now, I...” before he could finish his sentence, Shi Xiaofei run into Huang Xiaolong’s embrace, hugging him tightly with tears flowing down her face. Wet patches bloomed on Huang Xiaolong’s robe from her tears.

Embracing Shi Xiaofei, Huang Xiaolong was laden with guilt, apologizing as he looked at her, “My bad.”

Shi Xiaofei shook her head vehemently, then she kissed him on the mouth. Huang Xiaolong froze in shock for the briefest time before returning her kiss. Their tongues locked as the kiss deepened, they were inseparable for a long time!

Some time later, a noise came from the side, reminding the two of the present situation.

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder, glaring at Zhang Han who was trying to climb up from the ground, as did Chen Yun, and the rest. A strong killing intent surged in his eyes, but the monstrous killing intent in Shi Xiaofei’s eyes was much more piercing.

Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei separated, and both approached Zhang Han.

“You, what do you want to do?!” Looking at a murderous Huang Xiaolong walking toward him, his pupils dilated with fear as he stumbled backward. Even so, he tried to threaten Huang Xiaolong, “My father is the Zhang Family’s Patriarch, and this is the Wintry North World! Punk, you dare—!!!”

Before Zhang Han could finish, Huang Xiaolong landed a punch on his chest, knocking him backward, smashing into the stone wall in the distance.

“Young Lord!” Chen Yun and all the Zhang Family experts were alarmed, swiftly rushing to Zhang Han’s side.

The force of Huang Xiaolong’ fist bore through Zhang Han’s chest, causing blood to spurt out uncontrollably.

Chen Yun and the Zhang Family experts nearly lost their minds seeing this.

Zhang Han was a Fourth Order God Realm cultivator, but most importantly, for several thousand years, his physique was conditioned and enhanced using precious medicinal baths. Not to mention the fact that a God Realm cultivator’s physical body was extremely tough, common divine artifacts could hardly pierce through Zhang Han’s chest. Yet, this impossible thing had just happened in front of their eyes!

Emitting a whelming killing intent, Huang Xiaolong was not yet done with Zhang Han.

The Zhang Family experts became ashen as they watched Huang Xiaolong approach.

With help from Zhang Family’s experts, Zhang Han managed to stand up, wobbly and shaking. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, blood spurted out instead. His fearful eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, he could feel the killing intent prickling on his skin—Huang Xiaolong was really going to kill him!

“If you kill me, you’ll die as well!” Zhang Han’s face was hideous with fear and fury, shouting his voice hoarse.

“You need not worry about this on my behalf.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. In a flash of light, the Mulberry Sword was gripped in his palm.

“Kill, KILL HIM!!” Zhang Han roared at the surrounding Zhang Family experts.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared in a flicker, displaying his martial spirits’ innate ability Phantom Shadow. His afterimages weaved between the Zhang Family experts as his Mulberry Sword drew patterns in the air. With every slash and thrust, a Zhang Family expert’s body would explode, as countless rays of sword qi pierced out from their bodies.

Other than that Eighth Order God Realm Elder, the dozen Zhang Family experts that Zhang Han brought over this time mostly consisted of Third, Fourth, and Fifth Order God Realms. This level of strength did not have the slightest chance to resist before Huang Xiaolong.

Soon, only Zhang Han and Chen Yun were left alive.

Looking at the corpses littered on the ground around them, Zhang Han and Chen Yun were paralyzed with fear.

The Mulberry Sword in Huang Xiaolong’s hand once again slashed out, sending a ray of Asura sword qi through Chen Yun’s forehead, who could barely let out a scream due to the excruciating pain. Inside Chen Yun’s body, one ray of Asura Sword qi split in many, rupturing every part of his body before breaking out again. Just like the dead Zhang Family experts, Chen Yun’s body exploded into pieces. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Now, it’s your turn!” Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze fell in Zhang Han.

“No, don’t kill me, don’t kill me!” Zhang Han cried, his hands waving frantically.

“I already gave you two chances!” Huang Xiaolong remained stoic, the Mulberry Sword in his hand thrust forward, piercing right through Zhang Han’s chest into his heart. In the next second, immortal essence fire began to spread from the top of the Mulberry Sword.

Huang Xiaolong pulled out his Mulberry Sword, leaving the immortal essence fire to burn inside Zhang Han, starting from his heart, bit by bit.

Almost immediately, a scent of burnt meat filled the air.

Zhang Han’s screams reverberated endlessly in the land of new moon as he jumped around while trying to suppress Huang Xiaolong’s immortal essence fire with his god battle qi. However, all his efforts were futile. No matter what he did, the immortal essence fire continued to spread inside his body.

“Save me, save me!” In extreme fear, Zhang Han actually ran toward Huang Xiaolong.

With a wave of his Mulberry Sword, Huang Xiaolong cut off Zhang Han’s legs. Zhang Han rolled and flipped on the ground, crying and screaming in pain.

Starting from Zhang Han’s heart, the immortal essence fire spread outward towards the lungs and other internal organs nearby, continuing to other parts of the body, burning Zhang Han’s entire body in a vivid fire.

Reaching this point, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with Zhang Han, turning to Shi Xiaofei saying, “Let’s go.”

Zhang Han’s death would bring other Zhang Family experts over soon, it was not safe for them to linger in this land of new moon.

Understanding that this wasn’t the time nor place for them to talk about things, she nodded obediently.

Holding Shi Xiaofei by her hand, Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air, speeding off with her.

Shortly after Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei left, numerous silhouettes arrived in whistling winds. These were none other than high experts of the Zhang Family, and the person leading them was exuding a sharp aura. It was peak late-Tenth Order God Realm master, infinitely close to stepping into the Highgod Realm, the Zhang Family’s Chief Steward, Zhang Hao.

By the time Zhang Hao’s group arrived, the immortal essence fire had fully enveloped Zhang Han, but Zhang Han wasn’t dead yet. He was still twisting and screaming in excruciating pain on the ground, however, his voice and movements were weak compared to earlier.

Looking at the immortal essence fire that was like a cocoon over Zhang Han, Zhang Hao’s expression was stretched taut.

Not hesitating further, Zhang Hao acted. Slapping both palms out, countless strands of frigid purple qi landed over a wide area around Zhang Han. The ground in Zhang Han’s proximity was instantly frozen, layers of purple ice emerged from on the ground surface.

But to the Zhang Family experts’ astonishment, surrounded by Zhang Hao’s frigid cold qi, not only did the fire burning Zhang Han not extinguish, it actually burned even stronger.

No matter what the group of Zhang Family high experts did to rescue Zhang Han, it was all useless.

In the end, Zhang Hao and the other experts watched helplessly as Zhang Han screamed in pain while the immortal essence fire slowly reduced him into a pile of gray ashes,

Each Zhang Family expert wore an ugly expression witnessing the terror of the immortal essence fire.

“Pass the order, seal off the entire Wintry North World!” Zhang Hao’s eyes darkened, “We must capture that murderer!”

If word that the Zhang Family Patriarch’s son was killed in the Wintry North World was leaked, it would be their Zhang Family’s greatest humiliation!

The group of Zhang Family experts shivered at the cold aura coming from Zhang Hao, acknowledging his order. Each of them understood the gravity of the matter and its implication. Zhang Han being killed in the Wintry North World was equivalent to the sky falling down.

After relaying the order, Zhang Hao disappeared from the scene, returning to the Zhang Family Manor at high speed to report the incident to their Zhang Family Patriarch.
