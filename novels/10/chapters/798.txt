Just as the two Green Iceman brothers were tempted by the suggestion, Huang Xiaolong’s Earthen Buddha Palm squarely hit the Evil Ghost Ancestor’s chest. Pure Buddhist force burst into his Infernal Ghost Body, making him wail in agony.

“Let us join forces to kill Huang Xiaolong, I only want tw0-tenths of the divine grade spirit stone treasure. The rest of it is yours!” While the Evil Ghost Ancestor was wailing, he seized the chance to shout at the two green creatures.

Eight-tenths!

Both Green Icemen were stunned, the greed in their eyes even more obvious.

“Why aren’t you two attacking?! If you wait till other old monsters arrive, we won’t have anything left!” Evil Ghost Ancestor cried out again. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Green Iceman brothers exchanged a look, nodding at each other in tacit agreement. In the next moment, their hands suddenly attacked Huang Xiaolong. Multiple strands of icy green qi surged out, looking like two giant green ice rivers arching across the sky.

Although Huang Xiaolong had the Black Warrior Institute Principal and the Ascending Moon Old Man backing him, two people the brothers were wary of, they could immediately go into hiding after getting the divine grade spirit stones treasure. Even the Black Warrior Institute Principal or the Ascending Moon Old Man was powerless if they couldn’t find the two brothers.

The two of them could leave the four galaxies’ territories, going to other galaxies and hide. With so many galaxies existing in the vast space, they wouldn’t need to be on guard constantly, worrying day and night when the Black Warrior Institute Principal or the Ascending Moon Old Man would find them.

Seeing that the two green creatures were finally willing to move and attack Huang Xiaolong, the Evil Ghost Ancestor secretly sighed in heavy relief. Then he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, your time has come!”

The two green ice rivers were about to strike Huang Xiaolong when, all of a sudden, a resounding dragon roar shook the heavens. In the next moment, before the Evil Ghost Ancestor and the two Green Icemen’s bewildered eyes, a five-clawed golden dragon more than a thousand zhang long appeared right before them.

The instant the five-clawed golden dragon appeared, majestic dragon might seem to envelop heaven and earth. Before this majestic dragon might, the three of them were akin to fish out of water, unable to breath.

Right at this time, the five-clawed dragon’s powerful and sturdy claw slammed down on the two Green Icemen.

Under the golden dragon claw, pieces of shattered ice fell to the land below.

Overwhelmed by the impact, both Green Icemen reeled and staggered for no less than a hundred meters before managing to steady themselves. Even so, they coughed up a couple mouthfuls of blood.

“Ancient Dragon Clan!”

The two Green Icemen, as well as Evil Ghost Ancestor in the distance, cried out almost in unison. The quiver in their voices were obvious.

On top of that, it is the Ancient Dragon Clan’s royal blood, the golden dragon!

Needless to say, the golden dragon was Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, who had been watching from inside the Huang Clan Manor until now.

“So, it’s a Senior from the Dragon Clan’s. Senior Dragon is also here for that divine grade spirit stone treasure? Since Senior Dragon is also interested in that treasure, we naturally dare not compete for it.” One of the Green Icemen spoke with utmost respect to Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi. Judging by the flattering expression on his face, one could hardly tell that he was just injured by Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s claw just moments ago.

Listening to the Green Icemen plodding on, a low chuckle escaped Huang Xiaolong’s mouth.

Clearly, the other side taught that Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi also came to Martial Spirit World from the outside to snatch his divine grade spirit stone treasure.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi guffawed, rousing a small wind.

The Evil Ghost Ancestor kept his distance, feeling apprehensive, and did not say a word. Like the two Green Icemen, the Evil Ghost Ancestor also thought this Ancient Dragon Clan master came for Huang Xiaolong’s divine grade spirit stone treasure.

Though the Evil Ghost Ancestor was a thousand times unwilling, he dared not utter a word of complaint. He could tell that this golden dragon in front of them was definitely a master of late-Second Order Highgod Realm or above!

“Little Huang brat, how you want to handle them?” Right at this time, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi turned over to look at Huang Xiaolong with a smile, a dragon claw pointed at the Evil Ghost Ancestor and the two Green Icemen.

The two Green Icemen and Evil Ghost Ancestor fell into a daze, Little Huang brat?

Could it be?!

“Don’t kill them yet.” Huang Xiaolong added, “Let me first settle the Evil Ghost Ancestor.”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi nodded, then his divine sense restrained the two Green Icemen where they were.

When the Evil Ghost Ancestor and the two Green Icemen were still in a daze, Huang Xiaolong’s right hand swung down, making a slash. A golden light flashed and vanished. He locked down space using the ancient God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope.

The Evil Ghost Ancestor finally felt scared, his palms striking out in panic. Lines of silkthread shone brightly wherever the Evil Ghost Ancestor’s palms struck.

“What is this?”Evil Ghost Ancestor’s eyes widened in fear.

“This is an ancient divine artifact, the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope.” Huang Xiaolong smiled but it didn’t reach his eyes, “Don’t waste your energy. If you want to go out, you must first defeat me. Of course, if you can’t, my apologies, but you can only die here.”

The Evil Ghost Ancestor’s fury pierced the sky, fixing a ghostly stare at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, don’t get excessive!! If you push me into a corner I’ll drag you into the grave with me!”

Huang Xiaolong’s smile couldn’t help but widen, “Good ah, go ahead and blow up right now.”

Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed by the Evil Ghost Ancestor’s threats, he naturally didn’t believe that this Evil Ghost Ancestor had the guts to blow himself up like the Golden Horned Beast King did.

Moreover, the main reason the Golden Horned Beast King chose to die was that he was completely controlled by that mysterious Great Lord.

This Evil Ghost Ancestor wasn’t.

Humans feared death the most, Highgod Realm masters were no exception.

As expected, the Evil Ghost Ancestor did not choose to self-destruct, but bellowed as he lunged at Huang Xiaolong.

Outside of the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope’s coverage, the two Green Icemen were looking gloomy, restricted by Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s divine sense. The two brothers wisely chose to remain where they were, not daring to move.

It never crossed their minds that there would be a late-Second Order Highgod Realm ancient divine golden dragon at Huang Xiaolong’s side!

Had they known that, apart from the Ascending Moon Old Man, there were still the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Phoenix Clan Patriarch, three Great Peng brothers, and a Nine-Tailed White Fox, six other Highgod Realm masters, what would be their reaction?

Time slowly trickled by; one hour passed.

Inside the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope’s space, the Evil Ghost Ancestor was riddled with wounds all over his body, from sword slashes to handprints from the Earthen Buddha Palm. Even though the Infernal Ghost Body had fearsome abilities, the Evil Ghost Ancestor was hindered from displaying its transformations due to the God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope.

By now, the Evil Ghost Ancestor had lost all of his high spirits and confidence that he had when he first arrived.

“Huang Xiaolong, if I, Evil Ghost Ancestor, escape this time, I swear I’ll skin you alive and eat your flesh raw!!” Evil Ghost Ancestor’s malicious voice rang in the air.

“Escape?” Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Too bad you’ll never have this chance.” With that said, a blinding light flashed and an enormous tortoise with a snake as its tail, emitting an icy blue light, appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

In the blink of an eye, an icy blue light filled the entire God Restricting Golden Silkthread Rope space.

“This, this is the Black Tortoise Divine Fire?!” The Evil Ghost Ancestor shrieked sharply, “You actually obtained the Black Tortoise Divine Fire!”

While the Evil Ghost Ancestor was still shrieking, a colorful flying phoenix appeared around Huang Xiaolong, releasing a blazing crimson fire.

“Ver-Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!!” the Evil Ghost Ancestor was beyond shocked. Unfortunately, before he regained his senses, his body was engulfed by the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires.

Shortly after, a black godhead fell from the air.

Huang Xiaolong opened his palm and a suction force pulled the black godhead into his hand. He recalled the two divine fires back into his body and stepped out from the locked space.
