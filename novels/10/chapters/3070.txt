Chapter 3071: Your Godfather Will Be the Final Winner

“Lose?” Huang Xiaolong smiled slightly. He extended his palm and a flaming crimson jade bottle appeared in everyone’s sight. “This is Nine Flames Pills personally refined by the Nine Flames Immortal. I just got this a while ago. If I lose, then this bottle of Nine Flames Pills is yours.”

“Nine Flames Pills!”

Those three words immediately caused a furor amongst the spectating experts, and gazes of undisguised greed were locked on the flaming crimson bottle on Huang Xiaolong’s palm, and Jin Hongyuan was not immune to temptation. Even Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s eyes glimmered with a burning light.

With Jin Hongyuan and Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s statuses and identities, there were few things that could tempt them. However, the Nine Flames Pills were definitely one of those items that made their breaths quicken, and they almost couldn’t breathe.

That’s a bottle of Nine Flames Pills refined by the Nine Flames Immortal himself!

These were Genesis-level pills, and on top of that, these were top-rank mid-grade pill!

Suddenly, more than a dozen figures leaped into the air and rushed towards Huang Xiaolong. These were naturally part of the experts who had been watching from the sides, who gave into their greed and wanted to snatch the bottle of Nine Flames Pills from Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

However, just as these people got close to Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu’s enormous purple head blew out torrents of purple lightning water, like a rainstorm that poured down from the heavens.

Rumble!

All of the dozen experts were hit by the torrent of purple lightning water, and screams cut across the air. In the next moment, the others saw these people crash to the sandy land. When the crackling streaks of lightning enveloping them dissipated, all of them had been burnt to charcoal.

This successfully deterred many people.

“Perfection level absolute lightning power!” someone in the crowd gasped.

Jin Hongyuan and Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s eyes widened in shock.

Those who had harbored similar thoughts of snatching retreated immediately, quivering in dread.

Jin Xiaoxiao, Chen Yi, Li Xu, and others looked at Lei Yu with unconcealable fear.

They were baffled earlier by Jin Hongyuan and Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s respectful demeanor towards Lei Yu, but many of them didn’t think much of Lei Yu. Now after witnessing that scene, everyone was frozen on the spot, and no one dared to budge an inch without permission.

Huang Xiaolong spoke to Wind Cloud Dao Venerable as if he had not noticed the burnt corpses scattered around, “Inside this bottle are twenty-three pellets of Nine Flames Pills, and if you defeat me, all of them are yours.”

As for what would happen if Wind Cloud Dao Venerable lost instead, Huang Xiaolong did not bring it up nor was it necessary to bring it up.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. “Alright, I will fight a battle with you!”

Hearing that, Jin Hongyuan returned to the Golden Fox Flying Ship with his daughter and the rest, and then backed the flying ship to a safe distance away. It was obviously impossible for him and Wind Cloud Dao Venerable to gang up on an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable junior.

The crowd of experts also backed far away for safety.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable was watching Huang Xiaolong, and there was solemness on his face, which perplexed the crowd.

“Please, make your move.” Wind Cloud Dao Venerable said flatly.

Huang Xiaolong did not hold back. In the blink of an eye, he was entirely enshrouded in bright light as cosmos energy from his three worlds surged. There were phantoms of roaring divine dragons, kingdom of golden Buddhas, and various spiritual beings, eclipsing the flames that dominated the Golden Flame Sandy Land as long as anyone could remember. On top of that, green plants actually surfaced on the barren sandy land.

“Cosmos, cosmos energy from three worlds!” Wind Cloud Dao Venerable exclaimed with an incredulous expression.

Jin Hongyuan, Jin Xiaoxiao, and all the present experts looked like they had seen a ghost.

Shouldn’t a cultivator only have one small world?

But they were seeing three different worlds’ cosmos energy from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and Huang Xiaolong alone possessed three worlds!

Subsequently, above Huang Xiaolong’s head, twelve Saint Fates appeared, hovering majestically between heaven and earth.

When twelve Saint Fates appeared, all the experts discovered the vigorous flames burning on the entire Golden Flame Sandy Land stilled, and not only the waves of flames, but everything on the entire Golden Flame Sandy Land seemed to be frozen in time.

“Twelve Saint Fates!” Jin Xiaoxiao shrieked sharply.

And all of them were high-order Saint Fates!

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, Jin Hongyuan, and the various forces’ experts looked at the twelve Saint Fates dazedly.

Three worlds’ cosmos energy and twelve high-order Saint Fates! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Is there really this kind of existence under the heavens?

“This, this is someone on the first place of Mystical List, right?” someone asked in a quivering voice.

Each individual that could be listed on the Mystical List was a genius amongst geniuses of the younger generation. Currently, the strongest person on the Mystical List was the Mystical Pavilion’s very one Son of Mystic.

Rumor had it that the Mystical Pavilion’s Son of Mystic possessed the talent of an era that shattered everyone’s concept of talent. He had eleven high-order Saint Fates.

But now, they were seeing twelve high-order Saint Fates!

“Three worlds’ cosmos energy, twelve high-order Saint Fates! This is absolutely the first person in the whole Origin Holy World, no, it should be in the entire Huang Long World!” someone shouted excitedly.

“Three worlds’ cosmos energy, twelve high-order Saint Fates! This is indeed the first person in the whole Origin Holy World. However, a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable still has to rely on his own strength. Legend has it that the Son of Mystic has comprehended five elements of absolute power, and this young man is only an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. I think he hasn’t even comprehended one kind of absolute power!” someone said whilst shaking their head.

“I agree. In the end, one’s strength plays a bigger role.”

Some experts debated as they watched on in shock.

Right at this time, dark green flames appeared from Huang Xiaolong’s body and swirled around him.

“Power of nirvana!” Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s face tightened when he saw the dark green flames.

His worry was justified. When Huang Xiaolong had dared to challenge him, he had already guessed that Huang Xiaolong had comprehended one kind of absolute power. As expected!

Moreover, it was the power of nirvana that was only second to the power of space!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong’s power of nirvana had reached major completion!

Jin Hongyuan, Jin Xiaoxiao, Golden Fox Manor, and Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce’s experts ashened visibly.

“He, he, an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable has actually comprehended absolute power!” Jin Xiaoxiao couldn’t believe her eyes.

It was an effort for Jin Hongyuan to suppress the waves of shock he was experiencing, and he said, “It is said that the Son of Mystic also comprehend one absolute power of lightning at early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm,” he then added, “However, it is a fact that this young man is still an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and although he wields major completion absolute power of nirvana, in terms of battle strength, he’s still a little lacking compared to your godfather. Therefore, the final winner can only be your godfather!”

As one of the experts on the Extermination List, Jin Hongyuan still had this much judgment.

Although Huang Xiaolong wielded the power of nirvana, Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s perfection level absolute wind power was more than enough to contend. Moreover, Wind Cloud Dao Venerable had advanced to peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm for a long time, so he was more than apt with his strengths.

Hearing that, Jin Xiaoxiao wasn’t so nervous anymore.

Jin Hongyuan barely finished his words, when his gaze dazed in the next second as an extreme ink-black light rushed out from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

“Ab-Absolute poison power, perfection level!” Jin Hongyuan screamed in a high-pitched voice.

Jin Xiaoxiao swayed unsteadily as if she was hit with a great blow.

A shiver ran down Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s back without anyone knowing.

In the far distance, voices that had been discussing if Huang Xiaolong was strong enough to be ranked on the Mystical List came to an abrupt stop.
