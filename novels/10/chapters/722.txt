It wasn’t a lie to say that the Ascending Moon Old Man did not get anything in this one month on the Heavenly Mountain.

Although he and Yang Yi did come across many herbs and rare spiritual fruits, in these two people’s eyes, nothing truly attracted them. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In short, the two seniors were harvestless.

When they reached Royal Pill City, using the fact that Huang Xiaolong found the Heavenly God’s blood pool and a two-million-years-old Black Lotus as excuses, the old man dragged Huang Xiaolong to the Royal Pill House for celebratory drinks.

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless.

Then again, this definitely called for a celebration. Huang Xiaolong was happier than the time he won the Pill King title.

As usual, the bill was left for Huang Xiaolong to settle.

After the celebration drinks, worrying about his family’s safety, Huang Xiaolong left Royal Pill City and rushed back to Martial Spirit World.

After all, the temptation of a two-million-years-old Black Lotus was too big. With the news of him having a two-million-years-old Black Lotus spreading, some forces’ masters might use his family to threaten him.

When he reached the Huang Clan Manor and saw that everyone was fine, he was able to loosen his shoulders, his worry vanished.

Back in Martial Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong chose to enter seclusion and refine the Black Lotus.

What happened on the Heavenly Mountain opened Huang Xiaolong’s eyes to a truth, he was still weak. If he could break through to Tenth Order God Realm, he’d be able to kill that perfection stage Tenth Order God Realm Black Dungeon Tarragon!

Even against a Highgod Realm master such as Tao Gu, Huang Xiaolong need not fear him.

Therefore, it was crucial for him to breakthrough to Tenth Order God Realm.

The Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi also came to the Huang Clan Manor to ensure that no one disturbed Huang Xiaolong’s refinement of the Black Lotus.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong planned to divide the twenty-three petals of the Black Lotus to the Ascending Moon Old Man, Yang Yi, Shi Xiaofei, his family, and several others, giving one petal to each of them. But the old man, Yang Yi, and everyone else refused.

A rare and priceless two-million-years-old Black Lotus had the best results when consumed and taken as a whole. If it was divided, the benefits would be greatly reduced.

Increasing Huang Xiaolong’s strength was most important.

With everyone stubbornly refusing, Huang Xiaolong was left to refine the whole Black Lotus.

Sitting cross-legged inside the Godly Mt. Xumi, black qi was floating around Huang Xiaolong.

Slim strands of black light shone from the surface of his skin and below him was a lake of black qi. From the distance, Huang Xiaolong looked like he was sitting on top of a black lotus.

Day after day passed just like that. In the blink of an eye, one year came and went.

Even after a year, even with Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique and Etheric Physique, he was far from completely refining the medicinal benefits inside the two-million-years-old Black Lotus.

At this moment, Huang Xiaolong was totally submerged inside the black qi. Inside, the Godly Mt. Xumi space looked like a black piece of hell. Within this black hell, Buddha luminance and true dragon qi continuously glimmered.

His strength grew measurably every day.

In no time at all, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation rose from early Ninth Order God Realm to peak early Ninth Order God Realm.

Five years passed.

The black qi shrouding Huang Xiaolong began to roil and surge, but instead of expanding outwards, it began to gather, drilling into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Another three years passed in seclusion.

All the black qi was completely absorbed by Huang Xiaolong, disappearing from the air.

A full eight years. It took Huang Xiaolong that long to refine all the energy and medicinal properties of the 2.3 million-years-old Black Lotus.

At the end of these eight years, Huang Xiaolong had advanced to mid-Ninth Order God Realm, touching the border of peak mid-Ninth Order God Realm.

But Huang Xiaolong did not stop cultivating even though he had completely refined the Black Lotus. Inside the Xumi Temple, he blended into the background, becoming one with the Xumi Temple, one with the Godly Mt. Xumi world.

At first, everything inside the Godly Mt. Xumi space emerged clearly in Huang Xiaolong’s soul sea. Every blade of grass, every petal on a flower, down to a minuscule dust particle. In fact, he could trace the trajectory of every dust particle, experiencing the changes in every stage of a life; how a sprout broke out from the soil, how it strived to grow strong and sturdy into a towering tree.

Season after season, year after year.

The surface of Huang Xiaolong’s skin glittered in a brilliant light.

His soul sea had undergone drastic changes, reflecting radiant white light like a precisely cut diamond.

At first, Huang Xiaolong could only ‘see’ the movement and changes within ten thousand li radius, but this radius gradually grew bigger, reaching a hundred thousand li, as if everything was right in front of him.

The Black Tortoise star force poured down like a waterfall into Huang Xiaolong’s body, tempering his True Dragon Physique at all times.

More time passed.

One day, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, as if waking up from a dream.

“This is...?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked after opening his eyes. His eyes now seemed to possess the ability to penetrate solid matter, he was actually able to look past Godly Mt. Xumi’s barrier to the world outside.

Delving his divine sense internally, Huang Xiaolong was delighted to discover that he was now a peak late-Ninth Order God Realm!

Not only had his soul achieve complete clarity, it reached the stage of being pure and clear as a diamond, reflecting a radiant white light. Huang Xiaolong remembered Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi once saying that, when he condensed his godhead, his soul has achieved a pure and clear state like a diamond.

Meaning to say, if Huang Xiaolong could condense his godhead right now, at the very least, he could achieve a rank seven godhead?

Other than the improvement to his soul and strength, Huang Xiaolong keenly felt that his True Dragon Physique had once again transformed after refining the Black Lotus and being tempered by Black Tortoise star force. Whether it was defense or power, both had significantly strengthened.

In the four galaxies, comparing just physical strength below the Highgod Realm, if Huang Xiaolong claimed he was second, no one would dare to claim they were first.

‘I wonder if Father and Mother are doing well.’ A short while later, Huang Xiaolong calmed down and exited the Godly Mt. Xumi. Moments later, he reached the Huang Clan Manor’s main hall.

“Heavens, you brat are finally willing to come out! My old bones were going to turn into fossils waiting for you.” Just as Huang Xiaolong came out, a shadow flickered as the Ascending Moon Old Man appeared in front of him.

However, in the next second, the Ascending Moon Old Man stared at Huang Xiaolong as if he was looking at a terrifying monster, his chin and beard were twitching visibly in an exaggerated manner. The old man let out a shrill shriek, “Your sis ah, peak late-Ninth Order God Realm!”

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s shrill shriek brought all the Huang Family members over.

Huang Xiaolong watched the old man’s exaggerated reaction speechlessly. However, where did this old man learn to say ‘your sis ’?

“Old man, isn’t it just peak late-Ninth Order God Realm? Do you need to act so shocked?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow at the Ascending Moon Old Man.
