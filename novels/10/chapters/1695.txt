At the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters...

“What? Did you say that the mysterious genius is that Asura noble?” Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Ming’s face was distorted in disbelief as he stared at Patriarch Shi Wushuang.

This news was a thunderbolt out of nowhere.

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang nodded his head affirmatively, “That is right. It’s confirmed that it is the same Asura noble.”

After getting this report, Shi Wushuang himself was astonished and surprised.

“Why is it like this! How could it be like this?!”

Old Ancestor Shi Ming sat on the main seat, his expression flickering back and forth, but it remained extremely gloomy.

That mysterious genius is actually the Asura noble, who is the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s new master!

Damn it!

That Asura noble, being the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s new master meant he’s standing opposite to Lu Kun. Lu Kun wanted to eliminate this trouble as soon as possible, but if his Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe tries to recruit that Asura noble, then Lu Kun would definitely break off with their tribe.

Old Ancestor Shi Ming’s brows were tightly locked in a scrunch.

“Old Ancestor, what do we do now?” Patriarch Shi Wushuang asked. Obviously, he had arrived at the same thoughts.

Suddenly, Old Ancestor Shi Ming looked up fiercely, killing intent glinted in his eyes as he spat out one word, “Kill!” The hall’s temperature fell sharply.

Between Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kun, Shi Ming had chosen Lu Kun.

In Old Ancestor Shi Ming’s opinion, even though that Asura noble had amazing talent, and would become unrivaled once he grew up, this kind of geniuses were hard to recruit. Hence, he was incomparable to Lu Kun.

Once that Asura noble dies, and Lu Kun’s cultivation surpassed the Emperor Realm, Lu Kun could grasp the Netherworld King’s Organisation in his hand.

With Lu Kun and the Netherworld King’s Organisation in his hand, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe was akin to a tiger that had grown wings.

“Yes, Old Ancestor, I understand.” A second of surprise later, Shi Wushuang nodded his head solemnly.

Old Ancestor Shi Ming went on, in a low and serious tone, “However, make sure nothing goes astray. I want you to make a trip personally, and take thirty high-level Emperor Realm experts with you to the Nethersea. That Asura noble must die!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Understood! I’ll make preparations to head over to the Nethersea immediately!” Patriarch Shi Wushuang swiftly stood up.

“Please rest assured, that brat won’t be able to leave the Nethersea alive.”

......

Ghost World, Fengdu City.

A series of feelings flickered across Qin Fan’s face as he muttered, “It turned out to be that Asura noble!”

“Master, I think by now the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe must have gotten the same news.” Qin Fan’s personal disciple Jiao Zhouqing spoke. “We can only guess what decision Shi Ming would make regarding this.”

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe and Lu Kun’s connection was an open secret, other super forces had long known about it.

A sharp light glinted in Qin Fan’s eyes as he stated, “Perhaps, this is an opportunity for us.”

Jiao Zhouqing’s eyes lit up. “Master is saying that Shi Ming would choose Lu Kun. In that case, it is indeed the best opportunity for us to recruit that Asura noble; when the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe and Massacring Gods Gate besiege him, our Fengdu City can extend a helping hand to him, enabling him to escape. That Asura noble would definitely be grateful to our Fengdu City.”

But Qin Fan shook his head and said, “Although that Asura noble’s talent is astounding, and he could be the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s new master; it is not worth it for us to offend the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and the Howling Moon Wolf Race for him and the Netherworld King’s Organisation.”

Jiao Zhouqing was baffled. He asked, “Then, Master intends too....?”

Qin Fan smiled meaningfully as he said, “The snipe and clam fights, who has the last laugh?”

The realization hit Jiao Zhouqing, and he laughed out loud. “Master is wise. We merely need to stand back and watch, helping neither side. When the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Howling Moon Wolf Race, and the Netherworld King’s Organisation suffering heavy losses, our Fengdu City can easily unify the Ghost World, and Master will be the Lord of Ghost World.”

All these years Fengdu City had been secretly amassing strengths, and all of it was for the purpose of unifying the entire Ghost World one day with absolute strength. However, there was the Netherworld King’s Organisation suppressing above them which made Fengdu City wary to make any big movement without the absolute certainty of succeeding.

As long as the Netherworld King’s Organisation and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe suffered losses, it would weaken their powers, and neither side would be able to suppress Fengdu City anymore. It was only a matter of time, and Fengdu City would rise to the top with overwhelming power and unify the Ghost World.

“The Lord of Ghost World, I like this title.” Qin Fan chuckled softly. “But, just the Ghost World is too small.”

“Master wants....?” Jiao Zhouqing exclaimed in surprise, “Asura World and Spirits World?”

Qin Fan laughed out loud as he affirmed, “That’s right! While the Massacring Gods Gate and Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s powers are weakened, we would unify Ghost World with an overwhelming momentum, and riding on this wave, expanding our forces to the Asura World and Spirits World. Even if we didn’t manage to unify the Asura World and Spirits World, occupying several hundred thousand of Asura World and Spirit World’s planes would be manageable.”

“Yes, Master, this disciple’s mindset is too shallow, and can’t compare to one-tenth of Master’s.” Jiao Zhouqing smiled as he went on, “But, Master, can the Netherworld King’s Organisation really cause serious damage to the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and Howling Moon Wolf Race?”

Although the Netherworld King’s Organisation was known as the most powerful force in Hell, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe was not that far behind. After adding the Massacring Gods Gate and Howling Moon Wolf Race to the equation, the Netherworld King’s Organisation might not be able to withstand these three forces’ alliance.

Qin Fan waved his hand nonchalantly, then added, “The Netherworld King’s Organisation is much stronger than you think. Even if the Netherworld King’s Organisation cannot withstand the triad of Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and Howling Moon Wolf Race’s alliance, the Netherworld King’s Organisation is still capable of giving the triad a severe blow. Naturally, even if it results in heavy losses just on one side, the Netherworld King’s Organisation will be the one that will get eliminated. In the end, it does not affect our plan of unifying the Ghost World.”

“Yes, Master is more far-sighted than disciple.” Jiao Zhouqing smiled widely.

Qin Fan was still smiling as he went on, “Stop flattering me. From now on, tell the people below to report the changes in the situation above the Nethersea immediately. For the time being, we can sit back and wait to watch a good show.”

“Disciple follow Master’s order.”

Hell’s super forces had varied reactions when they received news that the mysterious genius was the Asura noble. Each had their own intentions and schemes, and the majority of them held the wait-and-see stance like Fengdu City. It was up to each of them to choose the right time to enter the fray or continue watching the show.

On the other hand, the Massacring Gods Gate and Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had sent even more experts rushing to the Nethersea to ensure Huang Xiaolong won’t have the chance to leave the Nethersea alive.

In a short span of time, a great storm was brewing in Hell.

While the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang hurried to the Nethersea with a group of experts, Huang Xiaolong finally reached the other end of the golden light tunnel.

Huang Xiaolong crossed over to ‘Heaven’ and was immediately enveloped by a bright holy light like a warm, gentle embrace. He almost groaned comfortably.

“What kind of energy is this? The effects are no less than the grandmist aura!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in astonishment.

Although Huang Xiaolong didn’t know what kind of energy this holy light was, he could clearly feel how amazing this holy light was.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong stopped going forward. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the spot and began circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to absorb the holy light’s energy.

In the next second, the holy light energy gathered around Huang Xiaolong.

Sitting there without moving, Huang Xiaolong resembled a holy angel.
