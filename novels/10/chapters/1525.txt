“Although our Martial Demon Emperor Palace has never been afraid of others or needs to be afraid of anyone, something is not right about this matter!” Ancestor Zhang Lu insisted. Shaking his head, he added, “Anyways, there is nothing wrong in exercising caution.”

“Is there a record of what happened at that time?” The Martial Demon Emperor Mo Xiao questioned.

“Only the images of our disciple Ning Shaozhi being killed in Demonic Python City.” One of the Hall Masters stepped up and answered, and passed the stone jade with the recording to Mo Xiao.

Mo Xiao received it and channeled a small amount of godforce into the stone jade. Immediately, bright lights shone out from the stone jade, through the roof to the sky outside. However, everyone present was baffled by the light images which were blurry and indistinctive. They could not tell what was what, other than hearing a few screams.

Faces in the great hall turned ugly at this result.

Clearly, the recorded images had been tampered with!

Who did it? Was it that Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple?!

But this recording was sent by the Demonic Python City’s Mayor, how could that disciple tamper with it?!

The temperature around Mo Xiao plummeted sharply, as everyone felt like their Martial Demon Emperor Palace had been toyed with.

“Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu, take my order!” Mo Xiao looked at the two silvered-haired young men from the dais. “Bring back that Ten Thousand Elephant and Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple to me! Remember, I want them alive! As long as they are still breathing, I’m going to let them taste every punishment of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace!”

In Mo Xiao’s opinion, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu were more than sufficient to capture Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun to bring them back to the Martial Demon Emperor Palace.

“For the rest of their group, kill them on the spot!”

“Yes, please rest assured, Emperor!”

Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu both took a step forward and respectfully complied. Their sonorous voices reverberated in the great hall. After a quick salute, both retreated from the great hall and sped away, disappearing in the horizon.

As Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu left the Martial Demon Emperor Palace and appeared at the Demonic Python City’s transmission array after an hour, the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace also sent Emperor Realm masters to capture Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun.

The difference was that the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace had sent four Emperor Realm masters to capture Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun.

One early Fifth Order Emperor Realm master, one mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm master, and two late-Third Order Emperor Realm masters.

How long has it been since the last time the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace had made such a big move, sending four Emperor Realm masters after someone? This clearly proved how furious the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace was.

The two Emperor Palaces’ experts stepped out consecutively from the Demonic Python City’s transmission array.

Wang Shuchen, Wang Shuyu, and the four Magic Shaman Emperor Palace’s experts blanked momentarily when they saw each other.

“I wouldn’t have guessed that the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace would actually send four Emperor Realm masters to capture a mere Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple; it’s truly unexpected ah.” Wang Shuchen taunted.

“Same.” The Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s early Fifth Order Emperor Realm Zheng Weijin retorted offhandedly.

Wang Shuchen chuckled nonchalantly, then said, “Zheng Weijin, do you think there’s a need for you and your group with the two of us, me and my brother, here? I advise you better go back. The Magic Shaman Emperor Palace can’t take any share of that kid and his Ten Thousand Elephant mount.”

Zheng Weijin wasn’t agitated at all as he flatly refuted, “Not necessarily.”

“Then, we’ll see who finds that kid first!” Wang Shuchen sneered. He exchanged a glance with Wang Shuyu and the brothers sped away.

“The Martial Demon Emperor Palace has actually sent these two old monsters!” Hall Master Hao Wei said as his eyebrows scrunched together. Hao Wei was one of the late-Third Order Emperor Realm masters from the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace.

“We must find that kid before they do!” Zheng Weijin said solemnly.

The other three nodded and all four disappeared from the transmission array in a blur.

“According to the scouts below, the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple had headed towards the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range?!”

“The Scarlet Blood Mountain Range? Why is he going there? The Scarlet Blood Mountain Range has heavy blood qi and also the territory of the Demonic Blood Beast Clan’s settlement!”

“Why think so much what he’s doing? We just need to capture and take him back to the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace before the Martial Demon Emperor Palace! I recently have had some success in cultivating an ancient divine beast art, enabling me to perceive the existences of divine beasts. We definitely can find them before the Martial Demon Emperor Palace!”

Zheng Weijin’s group had amazing speed, traversing a hundred thousand li in a few breaths of time. Moments later, the four arrived at the forest where Huang Xiaolong’s group had stopped earlier.

“It really is the aura left behind by an Emperor Realm Ten Thousand Elephant!” One of the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace’s late-Third Order Emperor Realm Hall Master stated as he looked at the large piece of destroyed forest.

“This Ten Thousand Elephant is likely a peak late-First Order Emperor Realm master. Any one of us can capture him easily! The Sect Chief sending the four of us to capture this disciple and his mount, seems like making a fuss over a small problem.”

“My sentiments exactly!”

As they spoke, the four had already sped away from the forest. They were following the route Huang Xiaolong’s group had passed through, getting closer and closer to Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“They passed by here roughly an hour ago, there are still some faint traces of that Ten Thousand Elephant!” Zheng Weijin stopped when they were passing by a valley. He reached out with his hand and gathered a ball of faint aura.

“Just one hour back, they were here! Based on that group’s speed, we’re probably not far from them. We would be able to catch up with them in no time!”

“Go—!” Zheng Weijin’s group accelerated.

As all four of them were Emperor Realm masters, their bodies were able to merge with the void as they flew, without causing any fluctuations in the air.

...

Half an hour later.

The four reached a mountainous terrain.

Zheng Weijin stopped again suddenly. There was a confused expression on his face because he had suddenly lost all traces of Huang Xiaolong’s group at that spot!

The other three were also baffled. What’s going on?

“You guys are looking for us?” A voice sounded as space rippled. Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the rest appeared.

“You!” Zheng Weijin and his three companions were startled by Huang Xiaolong’s group’s sudden appearance. Judging from their attitudes, were they waiting for them here? How did Huang Xiaolong discover them?

Zheng Weijin’s gaze was sharp as blades as it swept over Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun. But the more he looked, the more baffled he was. He was certain that Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xu Baisheng, and several others were merely God King Realm kids, and Xiang Xun was the only Emperor Realm master, though only a peak late-First Order Emperor Realm master.

While Zheng Weijin was still confused, Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong spoke, “Go back, go back and tell Peng Yi, this matter ends here.”

Peng Yi was the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s true name.

In that instant, four pairs of eyes fell on the Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong. There was shock and astonishment in their eyes, as to why this nondescript middle-aged man knew their Emperor’s real name. Had the Fortune Emperor Fang Gan told them their Emperor’s name? Does that mean, it was also Fang Gan’s order for this group to come to the Floating Twilight Land?

Why did Fang Gan send them to the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range?

At this time, one of the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace’s Emperor Realm masters, the mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm Hall Master, sneered at Jiang Hong. “This matter ends here? What a big tone! Punk, who do you think you are? How dare you address our Emperor by name?!”

Zheng Weijin’s eyes narrowed as he asked, “Did Fang Gan send you to the Floating Twilight Land?”

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

“Brother Zheng, to save future troubles, we should capture that kid and that elephant first?” Nie Bin suggested. After all, the Martial Demon Emperor Palace is also targeting that kid and his elephant.

Zheng Weijin nodded in agreement, “Alright, pay more attention!” He vaguely felt something wasn’t right.

But Nie Bin laughed off his concern, saying, “It’s just a peak late-First Order Emperor Realm elephant.” His pupils needled, locking onto Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun.
