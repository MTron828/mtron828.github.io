Chapter 3249: Beast Tide in the East Sea

Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and Huang Chenfei had not stepped out of the house for a long time until this day, so they knew very little about what was going on outside. It was Huang Dayou who answered, “No, it is said that Huang Houde went to the capital city a few days ago!”

“Oh, he went to the capital?!” Huang Xiaolong, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and even Huang Chenfei were surprised.

Huang Datou nodded his head. “Yup, it seems like the East Sea’s beasts are attacking the border again, and this time, the beast tide is much bigger than all other times. The alliance’s upper echelons have summoned Huaxia’s various families’ patriarchs. In fact, they’ve called all the patriarchs with a little bit of strength there!”

“Huang Houde would probably come back a month later,” Huang Datou added. Honestly, he didn’t know when Huang Houde would return, and that was merely his guess.

Huang Chenfei’s brows furrowed with worry and it was apparent in his voice as he said, “The East Sea’s beasts are attacking again? The alliance actually summoned all the cultivation families’ patriarchs? The beast tide this time must be very serious!”.

Huang Xiaolong asked, “The East Sea’s beasts often attack the border?”

Huang Chenfei nodded in affirmation, “Yes, they would attack at least once every few years as our city is located close to the East Sea, and the East Sea is a gathering place for many fierce beasts. Nothing can be done about it. Still, the alliance has stationed an army at the border, and most of the time, there isn’t any problem. This is the first time the alliance has summoned so many cultivation families’ patriarchs!”

“I’ve even heard that the Old Ancestor has gone to the East Sea!” Huang Datou added.

“What? Even the Old Ancestor has gone to the East Sea?!” Huang Jiyuan and the others were genuinely surprised hearing that, and Huang Jiyuan looked solemn. “If the Old Ancestor also went to the East Sea, then it’s something major!”

Generally speaking, an Enlightenment Realm expert rarely made a move. Something that required the power of an Enlightenment Realm expert had to be a serious matter.

Even though Huang Xiaolong was surprised that Huang Ming had gone to the East Sea, Huang Xiaolong didn’t put the matter to heart.

Huang Xiaolong accompanied his family, talking about Huang Family, the Earth, and other things as they enjoyed the food.

This afternoon meal went on well as Huang Xiaolong really scraped clean all the dishes, and not a crumb was wasted. His mother had cooked all these.

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong did not suffer from any heartburn.

By the time the meal was over, the sun was setting in the horizon.

Fiery ember rays of sunlight shone on the house, falling on Huang Xiaolong as he stood in the air. Looking at the sunset, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “So beautiful!”

This was the first time he noticed that Earth’s sunset was so beautiful.

The soft rays intermingled with the last bits of blue and white in the sky, with ever changing colors, that one could never get bored looking at them.

Huang Datou was standing in front of the house on the ground, looking at Huang Xiaolong who was standing in the air, and his face was full of envy and idolization. Although Golden Core Realm experts could fly in the sky, only Nascent Soul Realm experts and above could stand in the air as if it was flat ground. It was a dream for many people to stand in the air overlooking other living beings.

“Do you want to come up?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice suddenly came from above.

Huang Datou blanked for a split second then nodded his head excitedly.

He felt a gentle power wrap around him and carry him into the air with a casual wave of Huang Xiaolong's hand. The feeling frightened him at first, but he quickly regained his senses and stood steadily.

Huang Xiaolong continued to watch the sunset quietly, and Huang Datou smartly kept quiet.

“What do you want to do most when you’ve broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Huang Datou was momentarily dazed as he had never contemplated this question before because no one had thought that one day, he would be able to break through to Nascent Soul Realm.

It was so hard to break through to Nascent Soul Realm, and even many cultivators who were born with grade-seven spiritual veins, or even grade-eight spiritual veins, were unable to advance to Nascent Soul Realm smoothly, and he was merely someone born with innate grade-five spiritual veins.

“Uncle, I don’t think I’d be able to enter Nascent Soul Realm in my lifetime.” Huang Datou sounded dejected.

Huang Xiaolong smiled. This kid probably had not realized that after I improved his physical body, his talent has left the so-called grade-ten spiritual vein geniuses in the dust.

Forget grade-ten spiritual vein, even king-level spirituals, monarch-level, and even immortal-level meridians couldn’t compare to Huang Datou’s current talent.

“Then, just suppose, one day, if you really become a Nascent Soul expert, what do you want to do most?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

Huang Datou hesitated for a while before answering. “What I want to do most is marry Tan Wei!”

“Oh Tan Wei?” Huang Xiaolong’s interest was piqued.

Huang Datou scratched his headly shyly at Huang Xiaolong’s reaction. “I, I like Tan Wei!”

Huang Xiaolong grinned. “No need to feel embarrassed for liking someone. This Tan Wei, where is she from?”

“She’s our Donglin Province Tan Family’s direct descendent disciple!” Huang Datou explained, but a trace of complicated look and longing flashed across his eyes. “She’s very beautiful, especially her eyes that can talk straight with your soul. I’ve liked her since I saw her for the first time ten years ago.”

Huang Xiaolong asked, “Does she like you?”

Huang Datou’s face flushed an unnatural red, stuttering in his answer, “Wait till I break through to Nascent Soul Realm. I think, I think she might like me!”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed as it seemed to be a one-sided crush on his nephew’s side.

Huang Xiaolong continued to chat with Huang Datou, asking how he had met with Tan Wei. Ten years ago, Tan Wei had come to visit a Huang Family’s elder with her parents, and later she had run into Huang Bo’s group as they were bullying Huang Datou. She had helped Huang Datou out of a predicament, and it was at that time Huang Datou had fallen for Tan Wei?!

Huang Xiaolong shook his head with a wry smile on his face.

“You two have only met that one time?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Somehow, Huang Datou’s face was even redder. “N-no, she was here for half a month at that time, and I saw her a few more times after that. We became friends. I also ran into her when I went to Laixin City a few years ago.”

“Do you think you can only stand beside her after you’ve advanced to the Nascent Soul Realm?” Huang Xiaolong asked another question.

Huang Datou’s voice dropped considerably low as he said, “She’s very talented, then most talented amongst the younger generation of Tan Family. She has already advanced to Golden Core Realm. Not to mention, her marriage will be decided by her grandfather. Her grandfather is a Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm expert,and he once said that anyone who wants to marry Tan Wei, must be a Nascent Soul expert.”

Huang Datou’s voice dropped even lower, “But, she’s a direct line Tan Family’s disciple and extremely doted on by her grandfather. To marry her, the dowry will not be low, and it will be at least one hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones!”

One hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even in the past, their line of descent was incapable of taking out this exorbitant amount, and they definitely couldn't do it now!

Huang Xiaolong patted his shoulders and comforted, “Merely one hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones. When you really want to marry that Tan Wei, Uncle will settle it for you.”

Huang Datou was stunned.

“Which is the biggest bank on Earth now?” Huang Xiaolong asked, changing the subject.

“It’s the Swiss Bank!” Huang Datou answered without needing to think.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised to hear the famous Swiss Bank from the past still existed. “Is there a Swiss Bank branch in our Donglin Province? Take me there tomorrow. I have some things to exchange.”

He was going to exchange the dozen high-level beasts’ golden cores. Twenty million low-grade spirit stones would be enough for him to deal with the immediate situation.
