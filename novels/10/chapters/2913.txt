Everyone was stunned when they heard the voice.

Excitement bubbled in their hearts as they realized where the source of the voice came from.

“It’s Young Lady Yin Yue!” someone screamed.

“Young Lady Yin Yue!”

Chen Tianyang’s expression fluctuated slightly, but he didn’t stop. His palm continued to fly towards Huang Xiaolong.

Staring at Chen Tianyang with an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong casually waved his right hand. Everyone around them stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression on their faces.

“What’s that dumb brat doing?”

“Is he trying to swat a fly?!”

“No! He’s probably trying to fan the fumes of his fart away!”

Laughter filled the air instantly when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s half-*ssed defense.

A sneer formed on Chen Tianyang’s face, and he felt that Huang Xiaolong was tired of living. He couldn’t believe that a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor would be able to stop his attack imbued with cosmos energy.

As he snickered in his heart, a formless energy struck him, and the expression on his face changed. A look of terror appeared in his heart when he realized that he wouldn’t be able to stop the incoming attack.

Twisting his body, he didn’t care about his reputation any longer as he only desired to escape!

In front of the crowd gathered in the plaza, a terrifying wave of energy slammed into Chen Tianyang. As he drew a beautiful arc through the skies, he landed outside the city gates.

Several experts who were accomplishing in the grand dao of space saw that Chen Tianyang was kicked out of the city with a swipe of Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

When Fatty Zhu, who was standing in the crowd, saw what had happened, he was stunned silly.

Not a single person dared to believe their eyes, and they muttered in shock, “This… This... “

They looked at the direction where Chen Tianyang was booted, and they quickly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“Preposterous!”

“How dare you disrespect the members of the Silver Shadow Creed in our territory?!”

Two horrifying pressures descended from the skies and an aura threatened to suffocate everyone in the city.

Two silver streaks tore through the skies and pierced at Huang Xiaolong.

The streaks of light were formed by sword qi, and thunder rumbled in the skies as the light shot towards Huang Xiaolong. The true experts who were present were shocked as one could only produce such power when they reached the peak in the way of the sword.

From what they could see, only mid-level Dao Venerables would be able to unleash such a strike! The people who did it were possibly in the Fifth or Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

“Eminent Elders, stay your hand!” Yin Yue’s voice emerged from the immortal cave once again, and two ray of sword light emerged to block those flying at Huang Xiaolong. It was too bad Yin Yue wasn’t strong enough to stop the two Dao Venerables. She was strong, but she wasn’t stronger than two mid-level Dao Venerables!

It came as no surprise that her attacks were shattered the moment they collided with the silver sword lights. Without stopping for a single second, the two streaks of silver shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing as the two beams were about to arrive before him, the Immemorial Sword appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. He drew a line through the skies and a horrifying shockwave shook the lands.

The space around the collision started to shatter as holes formed in the skies above.

Some disciples who were unlucky enough to be in the way of the residual shockwave had several holes pierced through their bodies.

Everyone retreated in haste.

“Huh?” Two cries rang through the skies as two figures appeared in the space above the plaza.

“It’s Ancestor Hou Tingwei and Ancestor Chen Hongyuan!”

Those who recognized them broke out into discussion, and the plaza soon filled with noise.

Hou Tingwei was the master of the crippled Li Haitai, and he was a peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable! Chen Hongyuan might have been a little weaker than him, but he was still a late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable!

The two of them were accomplished in the way of the sword, and even high-level Dao Venerables were impressed by their comprehension!

The only thing that shocked those present more than the identities of the two ancestors was the fact that the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor was still alive and kicking after taking on their combined attack!

They didn’t even scratch his skin!

If those in the crowd were shocked, then there was no need to mention the two Dao Venerables in question. They stared at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous expression.

How were they supposed to explain the fact that they couldn’t harm a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor?!

Were they dreaming?

No! They couldn’t be!

When everyone had no idea what was going on, a figure appeared in the skies between both parties.

A look of joy appeared on the faces of everyone when they recognized the newcomer.

“It’s Young Lady Yin Yue!”

Her appearance caused quite a ruckus to tear through the crowd.

By turning to the two ancestors, she greeted them with a slight bow. “Eminent Elders…”

Hou Tingwei and Chen Hongyuan’s expressions loosened up when they saw her.

“Yin Yue, is this a friend of yours?” An expression of rage could be seen on Hou Tingwei’s face after he turned to stare at his disciple in concern.

“This is Young Master Huang, the expert I invited over to cure my mother of the absolute poison.” Yin Yue didn’t plan to hide anything.

The moment the words left her lips, the entire plaza rose into a riot.

“Huang Xiaolong! That’s Huang Xiaolong! He’s the one who beat Xuanyuan Potian half to death!”

“He’s the Primal Ancestor who fought Lord Bi Ye and sent him flying with a single fist!”

A look of admiration appeared in the eyes of those present. There were even some who burned with the urge to salute such a legendary figure.

The battle of the Monarch Yu Sacred Land had rocked the entire Divine Tuo Holy World, and Huang Xiaolong had turned into an idol in the eyes of many.

Fatty Zhu felt a bomb going off in his head when he realized what was going on. He was one of Huang Xiaolong’s die-hard fans, and he couldn’t believe that he had been talking to Huang Xiaolong for such a long time without even realizing it. Moreover, he recalled Huang Xiaolong’s promise of introducing him to Yin Yue.

The matter of Yin Yue and Feng Yue looking for Huang Xiaolong several years ago had long since been revealed to the world. There were many disciples who were speculating about the relationship between them, and now, they finally learned why Yin Yue approached Huang Xiaolong.

When Hou Tingwei and Chen Hongyuan heard what she said, they stared at him in shock. They hadn’t thought too much previously, but now that his identity was revealed, they couldn’t help but look at him in a different light.

“Young Master Huang, I’m sorry.” Yin Yue turned to Huang Xiaolong and apologized. “I didn’t think things through and allowed Young Master Huang to suffer some grievances…”

When they heard what she said, the expressions of many changed. Hou Tingwei’s expression was unsightly as he turned to look at his disciple and Chen Tianyang.
