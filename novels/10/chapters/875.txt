Fang Chu looked at Huang Xiaolong, saying, “Huang Xiaolong, your talent and cultivation speed are really beyond my expectations, you are the most gifted genius I’ve ever seen from countless galaxies in so many years. During the registration, your bone-age was only two hundred and fifty-eight! Tsk tsk, two hundred and fifty-eight years old ah, and now you’ve already reached late-Second Order Highgod Realm, even I can’t help but be amazed!

“What?! Bone-age of two hundred and fifty-eight!” Wangu Yanhui, Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei, these four people turned their heads so fast that they nearly twisted their necks. Their eyes widened incredulously with a trace of denial.

They did not know about Huang Xiaolong’s bone-age prior to this. Listening to Fang Chu, only now did the four of them come to know about Huang Xiaolong age!

And he was already a late-Second Order Highgod Realm!

Most of all, Wangu Yanhui, Mu Qi, and You Wuye had witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying strength, which was much higher than merely late-Second Order Highgod Realm. So high, in fact, that the ranked third Zhou Yao, an early Fourth Order Highgod Realm, was easily defeated in one move!

‘This...!’

Lu Dongwei remembered that he wanted to snatch Huang Xiaolong’s key in the beginning and now felt cold sweat dampening his robe.

This kind of a freak genius, if offended, one could imagine the consequences once he grew up. If possible, even a hegemon such as the Wangu Clan would try not to get on the wrong foot with Huang Xiaolong.

Based on his alarming cultivation speed, one couldn’t imagine to what extent he would rise given another two years or so!

All of a sudden, Lu Dongwei felt like his throat was exceptionally dry and itchy.

Fang Chu looked past these people’s astounded expressions, his eyes never leaving Huang Xiaolong, “During the registration, you were still a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm, right? This means that you only broke through to Second Order Highgod Realm after entering this Overflowing Lightning World!”

Hearing this, the four people at the side were stunned agape, their eyes protruding from their sockets staring at Huang Xiaolong.

From perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm to late-Second Order Highgod Realm, this was unprecedented in countless galaxies, in countless millennia!!

Furthermore, it had been less than two years since the tournament started, which meant that Huang Xiaolong was still a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm a year and a half ago. But now, Huang Xiaolong was a late-Second Order Highgod Realm!

As this timeline flashed in the minds of Wangu Yanhui, Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei, the four felt their palms clammy with sweat.

Huang Xiaolong watched Fang Chu with a calm expression, allowing him to continue.

Supposedly, before the tournament began, he was merely a small character from the four galaxies. A perfection stage late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm thrown in a sea of genius Highgod Realm disciples would barely raise a small splash in the water, most likely not even a small splash.

But this Fang Chu actually knew so much about him?

Adding the intense killing intent that Huang Xiaolong sensed from Fang Chu when they first met, he already thought of a possibility, only that he wasn’t sure yet.

“You killed the Azure Dragon Institute’s Xiang Mingzhi, hence, the Azure Dragon Divine Fire must be in your possession.” Fang Chu seemingly tried to confirm his deductions, in no hurry to kill Huang Xiaolong.

“Correct, I have the Azure Dragon Divine Fire.” Huang Xiaolong indifferently affirmed.

Fang Chu’s face bloomed into a smile, “That’s good! This way, there’s some worth to killing you. Otherwise, killing you just for the sake of killing takes out the joy out of it.”

Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity was stoked, did this Fang Chu know about the Azure Dragon Divine Fire’s background? Although Huang Xiaolong had obtained the complete four great divine fires, he only knew that they were born of the four galaxies, that was all.

“Are you so confident that you can kill me?” Huang Xiaolong asked calmly.

Fang Chu let out a burst of hearty laughter, “‘I know you killed Yelu Tianfeng and Beitang Wuji. Moreover, the fact that you were able to make Wangu Yanhui act so respectful towards you means that your true strength is definitely not weaker than a mid-Fourth Order Highgod Realm, perhaps even comparable to a late-Fourth Order Highgod Realm. But so what? Even if you were a peak late-Fourth Order Highgod Realm, the result would be the same, you’d be dead!”

“This here is an independent space. One can only leave after they get all the keys and re-activate the central formation, therefore, don’t harbor any hope of luck in escaping this place!” Fang Chu snickered with ridicule.

The five keys, after activating the formation, had flown back to their owners. Therefore, in order to collect the five keys again, Huang Xiaolong had to kill Fang Chu to get his key.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly spoke, more like a statement than a question. “You’re that mysterious Great Lord behind old witch Wang Na, right?”

Fang Chu was dazed for a second, then the smile on his face deepened, “That’s right, but even if you know now, what can you do? Regardless of how monstrous your talent is, or how heaven-defying your luck is, you are destined to die here today.”

“If that is so, then I’m assured.” Huang Xiaolong said as if a heavy burden was lifted off his chest.

His main headache was that the mysterious Great Lord backing Wang Na had always been in the shadows, he had no clue about his identity before this. But now that he had confirmed that Fang Chu was the Great Lord, things were going to proceed smoothly.

Even though Fang Chu was stronger than he had assumed, it was not the worst kind of situation.

Huang Xiaolong was just in need of someone to test his full strength, and Fang Chu was undoubtedly the ideal candidate.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, Fang Chu’s laughter turned sinister, “Assured? Since it’s like that, Huang Xiaolong, I won’t kill you immediately. In a while, I will make sure you slowly feel the fear of death, then I’ll play with you until you die!”

A glaring light rose behind Fang Chu. The shadow of a great gate then emerged from that light before Huang Xiaolong and the others.

This great gate seemingly incorporated every color existing in the world, manifesting as sea of brilliant lights. In the blink of an eye, it had gone through a myriad of changes.

“You actually condensed the Gate of Fortune!” Wang Yanhui blurted out in terror.

Wangu Yanhui had some knowledge about the Fortune Gate, as well as it’s ultimate cultivation technique, Gate of Fortune. Only those who achieved perfect completion could condense the Gate of Fortune using the fortune energy in their bodies.

It was said that, in the whole Fortune Gate, only the Chief and Ancestor could condense the Gate of Fortune, yet right now, in front of them, Fang Chu condensed that very same gate!

Both Fortune Gate Chief and Ancestor were masters of Tenth Order Highgod Realm, it was granted they could comprehend the Gate of Fortune cultivation technique to the perfection stage. On the other hand, Fang Chu’s cultivation was only at Fifth Order Highgod Realm, but he could already condense the Gate of Fortune. This was the most frightening point.

The last ray of hope in Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei’s hearts shattered.

“Yes, this is the Gate of Fortune.” Just as Fang Chu’s voice sounded, he moved, attacking in a flicker. His powerful palm struck down but not toward Huang Xiaolong. This attack was at aimed at Wangu Yanhui.

The Gate of Fortune’s energy rolled out, multiplying the power of Fang Chu’s palm as if it aimed to sunder the land.

Wangu Yanhui was shocked and furious watching Fang Chu suddenly target him instead, however, just as he was about to use some godforce, he discovered to his dismay that his godforce was suppressed by a terrifying force! He couldn’t use even a strand of it!

“Shit!” Wangu Yanhui was afraid and panicked.

Fang Chu’s powerful palm closed in, striking Wangu Yanhui on the chest; the overwhelming force sent him flying back, slamming horizontally against the wall and then crashing down to the floor. Blood was being coughed up by the mouthful, staining Wangu Yanhui’s face, robe, and the floor.

Defeated in one move!

Watching this, Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei’s faces had lost all colors.

Fang Chu coldly watched Wangu Yanhui lying on the floor, his chuckle harsh to the ears, “I forgot to tell you that my Gate of Fortune can suppress all kinds of godforce!”

This sounded like the final nail in the coffin for Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei.

Suppress all kinds of godforce!

Fang Chu was already a Fifth Order Highgod Realm, and on top of that, their godforce was being suppressed, how the hell were they going to fight?
