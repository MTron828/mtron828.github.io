Chapter 3335: You’re Going To Jail

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask Huang Datou when he saw how excited the kid was, “Is Pan Yingying really famous?”

“Yeah!” Huang Wen explained, “She’s the top celebrity in our Huaxia Alliance!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly. If Huang Wen had heard of her, she had to be pretty famous.

“She’s not just famous in our Huaxia Alliance! She’s one of the top few female celebrities in the world!” Huang Datou became even more excited as he introduced, “She managed to win three Oscars and countless other awards!”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

He knew that the Oscars were extremely hard to obtain. Even before he left Earth, nearly no one in the Huaxia Alliance had managed to obtain one of them! Now, Pan Yingying had obtained three of them!

As Huang Datou was still star-struck, the entire group arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong and they took a seat. 

The bodyguards around her stared at everyone around them with frosty expressions. It was as though they were afraid someone would make a move on Pan Yingying.

Wang Meilan couldn’t help but snort after looking at Huang Xiaolong, “Why does she need such exaggerated protection? She’s even more ostentatious than you.” 

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Mom, you just haven’t seen me in front of others.”

When more than ten thousand experts who led the various powers on Earth kneeled and bowed to him, that was a true show of strength. Those experts were at the Nascent Soul Realm at the very least, and there were even experts in the Enlightenment Realm and Spirit Severing Realm.

Wang Meilan thought that he was referring to the time when Tan Bi and the others kneeled in front of the Blue Dragon manor, and she chided, “Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.”

Huang Datou couldn’t sit still as he started to walk towards Pan Yingying.

After all, she was an idol he had admired for a very long time.

Before he could arrive, he was stopped by her bodyguards.

“I… I just wanted her autograph…” Huang Datou tried to explain himself.

“Our boss needs her rest,” one of the bodyguards growled.

In order to protect herself, Pan Yingying had established a security company. The bodyguards she employed to protect her were in the Xiantian Realm, and they could easily deal with ordinary people who tried to harass her. However, they were useless when up against a real expert.

Pan Yingying merely glanced at Huang Datou before returning to her magazine.

“I… I just want an autograph from her! I won’t take long…” 

It was clear she heard him, and she shook her head in silence after waving her hand to shoo him away.

“Bisheng, come back here!” Huang Chenfei couldn’t help but sigh when he saw Huang Datou’s persistence.

He could only lower his head as he walked back to Huang Xiaolong and the others.

Soon after, all of them passed security, and they headed towards the plane. They could see that  Pan Yingying and her bodyguards were heading for the same plane.

“Don’t tell me she’s really going to be on the same flight as us! That’s great!” Huang Datou yelped in joy.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Everyone could see that he was still waiting to get an autograph from her.

Huang Chenfei snorted coldly, “I’ll break your legs if you dare to pester them again.”

He was extremely disgusted when he thought about idols and stars. According to him, all of them were completely useless to society. As for the people in the entertainment industry, he felt that 90 percent of them were walking down the wrong path.

Zhang Rui, his ex-wife, was someone who worked in the entertainment industry, and that explained the hatred he had for them.

Huang Datou could only lower his head quietly after receiving the warning from his father.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s entire group was stopped by one of Pan Yingying’s bodyguards when they were about to board the plane.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Huang Chenfei’s expression sank.

When the bodyguard stopped them from boarding the plane, Huang Chenfei erupted in rage. After all, he was irritated by Pan Yingying’s presence from the beginning.

With a smug smile on his face, the bodyguard sneered, “It’s nothing much. However, none of you are allowed to board the plane.”

A frown formed on Huang Wen’s face. “Our tickets are for the first-class seats on the plane. Why are we not allowed to enter?”

Pan Yingying, who had already boarded the plane, sneered when she heard the question, “Alright, I’ll transfer you guys however much money you used to purchase the tickets. We can even pay for your tickets in economy class. Don’t even dream of sitting near me during the flight.”

“Do you think you can do whatever you want because of your stinking money?!” Huang Chenfei snapped.

Ignoring all the arguments that were going on, Huang Xiaolong casually flung the bodyguard in their way to the side before boarding the plane.

Huang Chenfei and the others stared at him in shock.

Pan Yingying was taken aback by his sudden act of violence.

She didn’t think that anyone would dare to make a move on her bodyguards.

“Throw every single one of them out.” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Huang Chenfei.

Roaring with laughter, Huang Chenfei sprung into action. “Alright! No problem!” One after another, the bodyguards were thrown off the plane.

Huang Chenfei was a Seventh Level Foundation Building Realm, and after training hard in the Blue Dragon Orchard, no one in the Foundation Building Realm was his opponent! Not to mention the fact that the bodyguards were only Xiantian Realm cultivators.

“What do you think you’re doing?!” Pan Yingying roared in anger, “All of you will go to jail!”

Huang Xiaolong grabbed her collar, and as her screams pierced the air, he threw her off the plane too.

Slamming face-first into the ground, Pan Yingying couldn’t believe what had just happened. 

It was the same for Huang Datou. His idol, who had won three Oscars and was the goddess of many young masters’ eyes, was thrown out of the plane by his uncle!

“What’s going on?!” Several workers ran over when they noticed the commotion. They were shocked to discover bodies scattered all around.

They knew that Pan Yingying would be flying with them, and all of them had received orders to ensure that she got whatever she wanted.

Crawling to her feet, Pan Yingying pointed at Huang Xiaolong as she gasped for breath.

“Young Lady Pan Yingying, this…” More than thirty enforcers appeared all of a sudden.

“These… These peasants are plotting against my life! Take them down right now! I will throw them all in jail!” Pan Yingying roared in anger.

The enforcers were shocked to hear what had happened, and they drew their guns immediately.

Huang Jiyuan and the others turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. After all, with Huang Xiaolong present, not even a rocket launcher would be enough to harm them.

“I’ll give you one chance right now to put down your guns. If you open fire, no one in this world will be able to save you,” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly.

Staring at each other, the enforcers didn’t know what to do.
