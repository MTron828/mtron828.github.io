Chapter 2608: Get Out of the Chaos Essence Holy Peak!

“That’s right! No one expected for that unassuming guard to be as strong as a Primal Ancestor!” The elder, who had reported to Feitian Longpeng previously, gasped in shock. “How can his guard be at the level of a Primal Ancestor?! Only the Mansion Master and the deputy Mansion Master would be able to suppress him in the Otherworldly Mansion!”

Feitian Longpeng shook his head slowly. “No. There’s someone else.”

“Someone else?”

Everyone knew that there were only two Primal Ancestors holding the fort in the Otherworldly Mansion under notmal circumstances. Where did a third Primal Ancestor come from?

“You probably haven’t heard of him. However, it is true that there is someone else capable of suppressing him.” Feitian Longpeng’s gaze turned serious.

Even though the Otherworldly Mansion was created with the alliance of many royal families, the organization had grown too strong too quickly. It had already transcended the control of the royal families.

Three Primal Ancestors were enough to scare any faction away.

“Oh! From what we have gathered, Huang Xiaolong is planning to challenge the Dao Gate!” Feitian Yuchen reported.

“Oh!” Feitian Longpeng was stunned for a second, but a smile soon formed on his face. “It seems like he’s an ambitious one.”

It was basically confirmed that one wanted to fight for a spot as the Mansion Master if they challenged the Dao Gate.

“Even though Huang Xiaolong is the young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race, he’s from the human race. Even if he succeeds, he won’t be able to obtain the recognition of ten royal families,” Feitian Yuchen muttered, “He’s wasting his time…”

However, Feitian Longpeng didn’t think so. “We have to push ourselves in order to grow stronger. Even if we know it’s impossible, we have to fight for it! What’s the point of living otherwise?!” He slowly got to his feet before he continued, “Since that’s the case, I’ll be registering too.”

“Young Master, you… “ Feitian Yuchen stuttered, “Feng Jiu is also planning to challenge the Dao Gate!”

“Feng Jiu?!” Feitian Longpeng was stunned. “What’s with her?!”

“Yeah. There were tons of disciples who wanted to register for the challenge. However, they had canceled their application after hearing that Feng Jiu was also planning to take part.” Feitian Yuchen explained, “Young Master, waiting for another ten years is fine. Why don’t you register when the Dao Gate opens next?”

A brilliant light flashed in Feitian Longpeng’s eyes. “No. I’ll register. I wish to experience Long Jiu’s strength! Since the competition is different every ten years, the strongest cultivator might not be the one who obtains the spot!”

Feitian Yuchen could only shake his head silently. No longer trying to dissuade his young master, he prayed that what Feitian Longpeng said was true. Even though there was a possibility of the strongest disciple failing to obtain the spot, there was a ninety-nine percent chance he was wrong.

…

When Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo returned to the Falling Yang Peak, Teng Mu, the hall master of the logistics hall visited him that very night.

Teng Mu was a member of the Teng Yi Race, and they were part of the royal families. They were ranked somewhere in the middle, and Teng Mu was extremely polite when he came to visit Huang Xiaolong. He hastily apologized the moment he saw the man, “I was absent previously, and I didn’t know how Brother Huang was treated by Jin Kang. Who would have thought that he would make things difficult for you? He even arranged for you to reside in the Fallen Yang Peak…”

“After returning, I taught him a lesson he would never forget!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart when he saw how enthusiastically Teng Mu was acting. He would rather believe that Hei Luo was an emotional being than believe that Teng Mu hadn’t given his consent when Jin Kang had arranged for him to live in the Fallen Yang Peak.

Teng Mu definitely had learned of Jin Kang’s decision the day it was made, and he only visited Huang Xiaolong after the news of Hei Luo’s strength had started to spread. Huang Xiaolong would know Teng Mu’s intentions even if he used his butt to think.

However, it wasn’t wise to slap a smiling face. As such, Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject Teng Mu’s goodwill.

As a disciple of the Teng Yi Race, Teng Mu was there to propose an alliance with the Purple Spider Race.

Since forming an alliance with the Teng Yi Race was beneficial to him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject his proposal immediately. However, there were steps to forming an alliance and Huang Xiaolong felt that it was still too early for that.

“Brother Huang’s talent is unparalleled! With your status as the young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race and your outstanding talent, you should have been arranged to stay in the Chaos Essence Holy Peak!” Teng Mu chuckled, “I have already arranged for Brother Huang’s cultivation cave in the Chaos Essence Holy Peak! Brother Huang, why don’t we head over to take a look?”

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

The Chaos Essence Holy Peak was where the core disciples of the Otherworldly Mansion resided.

With Huang Xiaolong’s talent, he was more than qualified to live there. This couldn’t be seen as preferential treatment from Teng Mu.

Of course, when Huang Xiaolong obtained the qualifications to fight for a spot as the Mansion Master, he would be able to enter the Otherworldly Royal City! That was where the disciples with the highest status resided.

Every single disciple who managed to successfully complete their challenge would be eligible to enter the Otherworldly Royal City! It was proof of their status and achievement! Regardless of whether they managed to become the Mansion Master or not, their residence in the Otherworldly Royal City would remain. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong and Teng Mu arrived at the Chaos Essence Holy Peak.

Even though there were hundreds of cultivation caves on the mountain, Huang Xiaolong’s residence was arranged at the peak. One could easily imagine the value of the only cultivation cave at the top of the mountain!

“Brother Huang, what do you think of this cultivation cave? Are you satisfied with it?” Teng Mu turned to Huang Xiaolong and asked.

The cultivation cave that was arranged for Huang Xiaolong was called the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave.

“The Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave is the best cultivation cave on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak. So, of course, I’m satisfied,” Huang Xiaolong snickered in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t believe Teng Mu if he said that it was the only cultivation cave available. Arranging this residence for him meant that he would be targeted by everyone in the Otherworldly Mansion.

Moreover, only disciples, who were likely to successfully challenge the Dao Gate, were arranged to live in the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave. There would be tons of criticism flying about when the other disciples learned about it.

“It’s good that you’re satisfied.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care too much about Teng Mu’s little schemes, and he quickly moved into the residence.

Just as he had expected, discussions started to spread across the Otherworldly Mansion as soon as he moved in.

“Huang Xiaolong moved into the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak!”

“He’s just a mere human! How can he be qualified to live in the best cultivation cave? We have to storm the deputy Mansion Master’s manor and ask him to evict Huang Xiaolong!”

“That’s right! Get him out of there! He should leave the Otherworldly Mansion altogether! His guard injured Lady Zi Yutong, and they should both be punished!”

There were tons of disciples, who screamed ‘unjust’ as they planned to storm the mountain.

As for Huang Xiaolong, the person who caused everything, he ignored their cries of the trash-talkers as he continued to cultivate in peace. However, there were some who were adamant about disrupting his peaceful cultivation session. Several days later, a group of disciples stormed the mountain to confront him.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re a d*mn human, and you’re not allowed to live in the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave! Get out here right now!” Someone screamed.

However, the words barely left his lips when Hei Luo flung him over to another mountain peak.

After dealing with the first dumb*ss that shouted, Huang Xiaolong sauntered out from his cultivation cave.
