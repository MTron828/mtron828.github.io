Chapter 3717: Location of the Universe Source Stone

When the two of them finally felt that something was wrong, they quickly summoned all their power to form a protective barrier around them.

Boom!

A wave of energy slammed into them right as they completed their defenses.

The barrier shattered in an instant and it broke into a million pieces. The two of them were sent tumbling out countless miles as they smashed through several palaces on their way.

Debris filled the land.

Only after a long while did the rumbling stop.

Ninth Void, Cong Dan, and the others looked at the two supreme experts of the Universe First Race who were sent flying by a ‘slave’ of the Human Race.

The Thirteen Kings were the pillars of the Universe First Race, and it had been that way since the start of time!

Now, the ranked seventh and eighth among them were easily swept away by a Human!

The scene smashed heavily into the hearts of everyone present.

“Daddy, Mommy!” Qing Luan cried out in fright when she looked at the two of them.

Standing where he was, Huang Xiaolong didn’t press the attack. He looked at the two of them and sighed, “I know that the two of you have a special combined attack called the Earth Prison where the Phoenix Waltz. Go ahead and use it.”

Dust filled the air as the two of them soared into the skies.

They stared at Huang Xiaolong, dumbfounded.

According to the Golden Cymbals King, Huang Xiaolong only managed to defeat him by drawing the battle out. He relied on the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, Reversal Sword, and Three Gods Halberd. When he sent them flying earlier, he didn’t use a single one of them!

The strength that he displayed earlier had crossed the 27 billion mark that was described by the Golden Cymbals King!

Their expressions finally turned serious.

“Who would have thought that you would have broken through?” Blood Phoenix Queen screeched.

“Even so, we’ll be able to suppress you!” The Titan King no longer held back as he released his aura completely.

Huang Xiaolong’s increase in strength might be unexpected, but the two of them were confident that they could take him down. After all, they were stronger than the Golden Cymbals King when they worked together!

Moreover, their strength increased quite a bit in recent years…

As the earthy light expanded around the Titan King, a pair of blood-red wings appeared behind the Blood Phoenix Queen. She grabbed him as they flew into the skies as their auras started to intertwine.

The fire around Blood Phoenix Queen that could incinerate everything in her path fused seamlessly with the earth aura from the Titan King.

The light that surrounded them started to transform and it burned a bright stinging yellow.

The weird light seemed to contain all the colors of the universe and in the distance, the two looked like they were dancing in mid-air! They were flying above a cage formed by the mysterious light and their power charged at Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Their strength was far from what it was before. The combination of the two wasn’t a simple addition.

Even Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when faced with their powerful strike.

Ordinarily, the fire was an element that couldn’t fuse perfectly with anything. Now, the two of them proved Huang Xiaolong wrong.

One had to know that such a perfect fusion was something nearly impossible. Especially, after they reached a level as high as that of the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King. They were far too strong and the energies they had should be completely incompatible with each other. However, they proved the universe wrong.

When Ninth Void and the others noticed the power coming from the couple, their jaws dropped in fright.

“Can the two of them really defeat Huang Xiaolong?” Cong Dan gasped.

“My parents will definitely be able to defeat that slave!” Qing Luan snorted.

When the storm of energy arrived before Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hold back to unleash all 29.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

The moment he did, the world seemed to stop moving. The city trembled as the skies shook. The powerful attack from the couple stopped right before it could crash into Huang Xiaolong and it was forced to stay ten feet away from him.

The two of them looked at Huang Xiaolong with terror in their eyes.

“This…” Only one other person emitted such a frightening aura.

The Black Nether King!

They only felt this way when they faced the Black Nether King!

Could Huang Xiaolong have already reached that level?!

Ninth Void and the others couldn’t believe what they were seeing and their bodies started to tremble.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Stepping into the void, every step Huang Xiaolong took seemed to resonate in the hearts of the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King. They retreated step by step, but they realized that their bodies no longer listened to them.

Huang Xiaolong tore through the energy storm as he made his way towards them.

Standing before the couple, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand slightly to disperse any sort of energy surrounding them. Grabbing them by the neck, he dragged them towards himself.

…

An hour later…

Huang Xiaolong left Blue Phoenix City with Pangu.

This time, he didn’t use any effort to control the Blood Phoenix Queen, Titan King, and a bunch of experts from the city.

Huang Xiaolong learned about the White Feather King’s whereabouts from Ninth Void.

“White Deer Cave!”

That was where the White Feather King went towards.

The White Deer King was an existence similar to a black hole in the universes. It was an extremely mysterious land, and it was one of the places even Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to step into in the past.

It seemed as though the Universe Source Stone was located there!

Several months later, Huang Xiaolong left the Universe Vault and headed straight towards the White Deer Cave. No matter what happened, he had to locate the stone before the White Feather King!
