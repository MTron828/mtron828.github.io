Chapter 2583: Stop Right There!

Qing Ying and her guards didn’t know what to do for a moment.

“Mysterious Ice Race? Honorary Eminent Elder?!” Princess Qing Ying stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

She had a little knowledge on the Mysterious Ice Race of the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds.

As the daughter of the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, she looked into every noteworthy power in the various holy grounds around her. The Mysterious Icy Race was pretty powerful. Even though they had no True Saint, they had more than a hundred half-True Saints. With that fact alone, no one could look down on them. Moreover, it was said that the relationship between Old Patriarch Yan Heng and the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor was pretty good.

The Storm Bringer Holy Emperor was a legend in the Dissociation Domain. He had cultivated for less than a million years before entering the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm. Even her father, the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, had to show some respect to the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor. From what she had heard, the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor had the potential to surpass her father by entering the high-level True Saint Realm.

That meant that he could enter the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm!

In the Dissociation Domain, experts in the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm could be counted on one hand!

As such, her father had passed down strict orders to avoid messing with the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor.

“Hehe, no wonder a mere human race trash dares to attack Princess Qing Ying’s guard. He’s just a piece of sh*t borrowing the name of the Mysterious Ice Race!” One of the purple-robed young men beside Princess Qing Ying snarled. There was a diagram of a soaring serpent embroidered on his robes.

Soaring Serpent Race! He was part of the second strongest race in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds!

The young man happened to be a core disciple of the Soaring Serpent Race, and he was a nephew of the current patriarch.

In the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds, the Soaring Serpent Race had serious beef with the Mysterious Ice Race. The only reason they hadn’t launched an all-out attack to exterminate the Mysterious Ice Race was because of the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor.

Now that he learned of Huang Xiaolong’s identity as an honorary Eminent Elder, he was extremely displeased.

What the f*ck… I am not able to touch the Mysterious Ice Race, but how can I not deal with a mere honorary Eminent Elder?

“Brat, a dog like you must be blind! Who do you think you are? Do you really think you’re some type of big shot now that you have the Mysterious Ice Race behind you?” Teng Baining swung his whip at Huang Xiaolong. “Why are you still standing there? Kneel and apologize to Princess Qing Ying!”

Not only would he be able to vent his anger on this human race kid, but he could also leave a good impression on Princess Qing Ying by teaching Huang Xiaolong a lesson!

Even though he knew that Huang Xiaolong was definitely someone strong with his status as an honorary Eminent Elder of the Mysterious Ice Race, he didn’t care too much. After all, he was the most talented disciple in the Soaring Serpent Race. He was already at the peak of the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, and someone with Huang Xiaolong’s age would definitely be weaker than him! Or so he thought…

Of course, the whip in his hands was no ordinary weapon. It was a peak-grade pseudo holy artifact.

Turning into an ice dragon, the whip shot towards Huang Xiaolong. It possessed incredible strength and the guards behind Princess Qing Ying widened their eyes in shock.

“The human race brat is dead now! He actually offended Young Master Teng Baining!” Some alien race disciple screamed.

“Even though the brat seems strong, Young Master Teng Baining is one of the five strongest experts under the True Saint Realm! His whip is the strongest pseudo holy artifact and there’s no way that kid can take a single strike!”

Everyone broke out into discussion.

No one felt that Huang Xiaolong would be able to escape unscathed from the attack.

Teng Baining was one of the five strongest experts under the True Saint Realm, and even First Heaven True Saints wouldn’t be able to stand up to him!

It was an impressive feat for a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint to kill a First Heaven True Saint!

After seeing that Teng Baining was about to make a move, Princess Qing Ying stared at Huang Xiaolong coldly. There wasn’t a trace of pity in her eyes. After all, he was a mere Eminent Elder of the Mysterious Ice Race. If he died, nothing would happen to her. It wouldn’t matter if he told the Storm Bringer Holy Emperor. After all, an honorary Eminent Elder was a nobody.

As everyone continued watching, the whip arrived above Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Not moving too much, Huang Xiaolong merely pointed at the space above him.

Seemingly passing through ten billion years of aging, the whip started turning to dust. However, Teng Baining’s arm wasn’t spared either as it started to crumble. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

His body, head, and legs turned into gray-colored ash as a breeze scattered whatever remained of him into the wind. Under the illumination of the sun, he painted a sorry picture through the void.

Everyone stared in disbelief at the gray ash floating in the wind.

Silence descended on the lands and Princess Qing Ying’s shrill scream pierced through the air.

“Ahhhhhhh!”

Her scream brought everyone back to reality.

Everyone started to panic as fear gripped their hearts.

All of a sudden, an old expert appeared beside Princess Qing Ying and he stared at Huang Xiaolong with an expression of trepidation.

The old man was definitely a True Saint Realm expert sent by the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor to protect her.

After all, Qing Ying was his daughter. The True Saint Realm expert had been given strict orders to protect Qing Ying’s life at all costs, and he would only appear when her life was in immediate danger.

Princess Qing Ying was scared silly, and the blood drained from her face. It was no wonder she was scared. After all, Teng Baining had turned into a pile of dust beside her. He didn’t even die with a complete corpse! She wasn’t prepared to experience something like that.

No matter how prestigious her status and how much of the world she had seen, she had never expected for a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint to turn into dust beside her.

Ignoring the fearful expression on their faces, Huang Xiaolong made his way towards Princess Qing Ying.

“Young Lord, please stop!” The True Saint Realm expert could only suppress the fear in his heart and do his job. With a sword appearing in his hand, he pointed it at Huang Xiaolong.

“Take her away right now. Don’t stand in my way.”

Everyone, who had felt that Huang Xiaolong’s actions were shocking, frowned when they heard what he said.

“How dare you! You’re a weakling from the human race! How dare you make Princess Qing Ying get out of your way?” Another guard screamed at Huang Xiaolong. “Even if you’re a True Saint Realm expert, you can’t talk to our Princess this way!”

The guard wasn’t b*lllsh*tting. In the Dissociation Domain, low-level True Saints had to bow respectfully when they saw Princess Qing Ying. Since Huang Xiaolong was a human race expert, his status was even lower.

Princess Qing Xuan was not just the daughter of the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, but her status was bestowed upon her by the Lord of the Dissociation Domain!

Footnote: Princess Qing Xuan (title), real name, Qing Ying, to avoid confusion with her father, Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, from hereon, we will use Princess Qing Ying.
