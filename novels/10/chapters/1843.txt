Even the VIP suites’ members felt their eyes brighten when they saw the Tushita Flying Ship’s appearance. The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor and the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor were no exception.

In contrast, Huang Xiaolong was remarkably calm when he looked at the Tushita Flying Ship.

The spirit stones he had were more than enough to obtain both the treasures, and he wasn’t worried at all. Instead, he allowed the rest of the people to raise the bid to whatever they wanted.

“Tushita Flying Ship... It’s the personal treasure of the leader of the Fire World. There is no need for me to speak further. With the Tushita Flying Ship, entering the Kingdom of Devil Beasts would be a walk in the park. You’ll be able to obtain the treasures of the Kingdom of Devil Beasts by just reaching out and grabbing it!” The auctioneer activated his unique skill and spoke all sorts of great things about the ship.

A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

This auctioneer is pretty impressive.

The way he spoke was really unique. His speech was like a melodious tune and resonated with the hearts of the audience. No one would feel awkward in the hall when he was around.

Ordinary auctioneers would be extremely serious when introducing a treasure like the Tushita Flying Ship. No one would act like him.

According to his fabulous description, as long as one bought the Tushita Flying Ship, the Kingdom of Devil Beast would turn into their backyard.

“This auctioneer is pretty good at talking.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Gao Changran couldn’t hide the smile on his lips. “Lord is right.”

“Alright, now, the auction will begin! The starting price is thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones!” His tone changed in an instant, and a solemn declaration left his lips. “Every bid must raise the price by at least a million!”

“Thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones!”

“One million increment per bid!”

Everyone widened their eyes in shock.

Several ancestors who were holding on to their sweet dreams of obtaining the Tushita Flying Ship felt as though a bucket of ice water was poured over their heads.

There were even some ancestors who were shocked to the point where they couldn’t breathe properly.

Even ancestors of superpowers ranked in the top twenty felt their hearts trembling. They felt as though the trace of hope they had in their heart was extinguished without mercy.

Even some of the ancient superpowers and those ranked in the top ten had to take a step back. Their ancestors sucked in a cold breath when they heard the starting price.

“Thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones seems a little too vicious.” The sect master of the Devil Mountain Sect couldn’t help but grumble. It had to be said that the Devil Mountain Sect was the eighth-ranked superpower in the Devil World.

Thirty million low-grade chaos spirit stones were like carving out a piece of meat of the Devil Mountain Sect.

Moreover, that was only the starting bid.

If the Devil Mountain Sect Master really wanted to purchase the Tushita Flying Ship, he would need to be ready to sacrifice everything he had.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong was utterly indifferent. He remained completely expressionless when he heard the starting bid.

He didn’t care if the starting bid was twenty or thirty million. To him, it was all the same.

Perhaps the starting bid of thirty million was too high, and no one dared to make the starting bid.

“The auction starts now!” Just when the words left the auctioneer’s lips, a booming voice rang through the hall. “Thirty-one million!”

Everyone stared in shock at the source of the voice.

“It’s the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor!”

The person who made the first bid was precisely the Stone Archdevil Ancestor in the sixth suite.

Everyone felt as though things were about to get interesting.

Perhaps because they were afraid of his reputation, no one called out a second bid even after a long time.

“Thirty-two million!” A voice rang out from the seventh suite.

“It’s the old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate!” Someone managed to recognize the ancestor’s voice in the seventh room, and he yelled out in excitement.

The Absolute Devil Gate was an ancient superpower who had strength comparable to the Hundred Transformation Sect. They weren’t any weaker when compared to the Devil Ape Cult. Moreover, they always had beef with the Devil Ape Cult.

The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate was one of the supreme existences in the Devil World.

When the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor heard the voice of the old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate, he harrumphed, but before he could call out another bid, someone beat him to it. “Thirty-three million!”

Xing Yinuo’s crystal clear voice resounded through the hall.

When the younger generation’s male disciples heard her voice, all of them felt excitement rushing up their hearts. Their fanatical screams filled the hall.

The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate formed a weird smile on his face, and he conceded. “It seems like Martial Niece Xing is interested in the item. You sure have great charm... It seems as though we old men can’t match up to your attractiveness in the slightest.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xing Yinuo’s voice rang out once again. “Senior Absolute must be joking. Junior doesn’t dare to compare myself to you.”

“Forty million.” Huang Xiaolong straightened his back and called out.

Forty million!

The hall fell into silence in an instant, and all the banter stopped. They turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a surprised gaze, and even the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, Xing Yinuo, and other ancestors failed to contain their shock. The old ancestor from the Absolute Devil Gate lost his train of thought.

“Hehe, the younger generation will surpass us in due time...” The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate finally broke the silence. However, he didn’t raise the bid.

In the number One VIP suite, Xing Yinuo’s gaze turned to look at Huang Xiaolong once again.

“How can this brat take out so many spirit stones?” Wang Zhiqiao widened his eyes in shock. It was clear that he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong could foot the bill.

“Forty-one million!” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor rose the bid once again.

The twelve Archdevil Ancestors had swept through the Devil World in the past, and the number of people they had killed couldn’t even be counted. They held countless treasures in their hands, and their personal fortune could rival the accumulated riches of any superpower. Several tens of millions didn’t bother the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor at all.

“Forty-two million.” Another voice rang out. When they turned to look at this person, they saw that his entire body was covered in a black robe, and there were traces of devil runes on his skin.

“Forty-three million.” Xing Yinuo raised the bid once again.

“Fifty million.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bat an eyelid when he called out his bid.

Everyone present sucked in a cold breath. When they saw the ever-increasing price, they felt as though their hearts couldn’t take it.

“Sixty million!” When everyone was still amazed at Huang Xiaolong’s bid, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor raised the bid once again.

A soft smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips, and he continued. “Seventy million.” Even though the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor had enormous wealth, it paled compared to what Huang Xiaolong had obtained in Hell and the loot from all the people he had killed.

In the number One VIP suite, everyone’s faces were scrunched together when they heard the bids.

Even though they had prepared quite a sum, they knew that seventy million was too much to pay for the Tushita Flying Ship.

A brilliant light flashed through Xing Yinuo’s pretty eyes, but she decided to give it up.

“Seventy-one million.” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s voice was low, and it was clear he wouldn’t give up easily.

“Eighty million.” Huang Xiaolong continued to raise the price without a change in his expression.

This time, the entire hall fell silent as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Even the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor remained silent.

In the end, the Tushita Flying Ship was won by Huang Xiaolong with a bid of eighty million low-grade chaos spirit stones. When he paid up and received the Tushita Flying Ship, Gao Changran felt his throat going dry.

“Next up, we’ll be auctioning off our final anchoring treasure, the Devil Holy Water!”

In an instant, several million eyeballs landed on the stage.
