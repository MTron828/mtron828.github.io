When the elders heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed Wangu Yanhui as ‘that little kid,’ they couldn’t help but frown.

They had already felt that he was a retard when he spoke about killing Wangu Wudi and how he wanted to uproot the Wangu Clan. Right now, they felt that he wasn’t just a retard. He was a crazy, mentally handicapped b*stard.

Even Wangu Wudi, who was known as the strongest under the heavens, wouldn’t dare to call Wangu Yanhui’s name, much less address him as a ‘little kid.’

Huang Xiaohai nodded his head. “Yes, Wangu Yanhui became the leader of the Wangu Clan several hundred years ago. Even though he’s not as strong as Wangu Wudi, he wouldn’t be too much weaker.”

Huang Xiaolong turned around and asked the elder who spoke non-stop since entering the hall. “When will the members of the Wangu Clan arrive?”

Despite hearing the question, the elder refused to reply. He hated how Huang Xiaolong spoke as he felt that Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a braggart.

“Are you deaf?! Why are you keeping silent now?!” Huang Xiaohai raged when he saw that the elder was keeping mum.

Being on the receiving end of Huang Xiaohai’s rage, the elder was stunned. He had never seen the Family Head so angry in his life.

“Yes, Family Head, the members of the Wangu Clan will be here in a few minutes.” No longer daring to show his attitude, the elder replied to the question.

Huang Xiaohai turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Getting to his feet, Huang Xiaolong said to everyone in the hall. “Since they will be here soon, we should go out and welcome them. Otherwise, they might say that we are rude.”

Since Huang Xiaolong had already decided, Zhang Fu, Zhao Shu, Huang Xiaohai, and the others didn’t dare to dally. They followed behind him as they walked to the entrance of the manor.

When the elders saw that even the head of the Huang Family and the various experts were walking behind Huang Xiaolong like obedient children, they couldn’t help but feel shocked in their hearts. A sense of suspicion flashed through their minds.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the entrance, they saw the group of Wangu Clan’s experts sauntering towards them.

His gaze landed on Wangu Changlong, who was standing in front of everyone. He saw the look of disdain in Wangu Changlong’s eyes, and he couldn’t help but find it funny.

The two groups met each other at the entrance of the Abundant Deities Manor.

Wangu Changlong spotted Huang Xiaolong in an instant, and he snorted, “So you’re the mentally handicapped b*stard who killed my disciples?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaohai, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the others almost erupted with rage.

However, Huang Xiaolong stretched out his hand and stopped them before they could do anything,

“That’s right. I killed them.”

Wangu Changlong chuckled in a sinister voice. “It’s good that you dare to admit it. I thought that you would wet your pants when you saw us. It looks like you’re no coward.”

All the experts from the Wangu Clan burst into laughter.

“Family Head Zhang, where is the marriage contract?” Wangu Changlong turned to look at the black-haired old man behind him and asked.

The person he spoke to was precisely Zhang Zongyang, the head of the Zhang Family.

Without missing a beat, Zhang Zongyang retrieved the marriage contract and said, “Lord Changlong, this is the marriage contract.” A golden-colored book appeared in his hand as he passed it to Wangu Changlong.

Wangu Changlong didn’t bother receiving it, and he snorted in response. “Humph. Right now, you can tell Huang Xiaohai about the matter about dissolving the marriage.”

Zhang Zongyang bowed before bringing the book to Huang Xiaohai. “Huang Family Head, this is the marriage contract you had brought over to my Zhang Family in the past.” As soon as the words left his lips, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong with a sneer on his face. “But it’s too bad a wastrel like Huang Kebin isn’t worthy of marrying my daughter. He’s nothing but a toad lusting over swan meat. Today, I’m here to cancel the engagement.”

As though he was afraid Huang Xiaohai wouldn’t agree, Zhang Zongyang continued, “Even if you refuse to agree, you don’t have a choice.” With a wave of his hand, the marriage contract was shredded to bits, and the broken pieces fluttered in the wind.

Huang Xiaohai’s expression sank.

Even though everything happened in front of him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother stopping it. He stared at the scene without so much as opening his mouth. He didn’t even allow Huang Xiaohai or anyone present to stop Zhang Zongyang.

When Wangu Changlong looked at the pieces of paper fluttering in the air, a sneer appeared on his face. “I’ve seen snow fluttering in the air before, and I’ve even witnessed black colored rain. However, this is the first time I’ve seen a marriage contract filling the skies! This is too beautiful!”

“Are you done?” Huang Xiaolong finally opened his mouth. “If you’re done, I’ll send you on your way now. If you’re not, I’ll give you another minute to act like clowns in front of me.” He shook his head and chided. “To be honest, your performance a moment ago was comparable to trash...”

Wangu Changlong and the other experts of the Wangu Clan stared at Huang Xiaolong, dumbstruck.

“Brat, I’ll kill you right now!” Wangu Di felt fire spilling out from his eyes as he charged at Huang Xiaolong.

However, Wangu Changlong reached out and stopped him before Wangu Di could complete his move. “It’s a pity to kill him like that. We should tear off all the skin on his body before scraping the flesh off from his bones. We’ll rip out his eyeballs and torture him in front of everyone in the city! Things wouldn’t be fun otherwise.”

Wangu Changlong turned to Huang Xiaohai and said, “I don’t care about his relationship with all of you. If you continue to cover for him, all the male disciples in your Huang Family will suffer the same fate! We’ll grab all your female members and turn them all into playthings for our disciples!”

Too bad Huang Xiaolong had enough of his nonsense as he reached out with a single hand and slapped Wangu Changlong across the face.

As Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother moving too quickly, Wangu Changlong saw his attack. “Brat, you dare?!”

However, his expression changed when he spoke up to that point.

Under the gaze of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong’s slap landed perfectly on his face.

With a miserable shriek escaping his lips, Wangu Changlong was sent flying. His fate was the same as Wangu Rui as his face was slapped flat by Huang Xiaolong!

His teeth scattered around the ground, his eyes popped out of their sockets, his mouth was torn open and copious amounts of blood emerged from his throat.

The initially noisy scene turned deathly silent in an instant.

Everyone who was there to watch a good show stared at the scene before them, dumbstruck.

As for the other experts from the Wangu Clan, they stared at each other, and their jaws nearly dropped to the ground.

When Huang Kebin charged all the way to the entrance after hearing that the Zhang Family Leader wanted to renounce the marriage, he was greeted with a shocking scene. His jaws dropped, and his eyes widened to the size of saucers.

The various elders of the Huang Family who followed behind Huang Xiaohai and the others didn’t dare to believe their eyes.

When everyone was confused about how to react, Huang Xiaolong spoke up, “Perfect. I told you I would give you another minute to mess around.” A minute perfectly passed when Wangu Changlong smashed into the ground after his slap.

Huang Xiaolong’s voice caused everyone to snap back to attention. Everyone turned to stare at his unfamiliar face.

Wangu Changlong died from a single slap...

He killed a late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm expert with a single slap!

“You... you... you... “ Wangu Di pointed at Huang Xiaolong, and he stuttered. His finger trembled, and the rest of the words failed to leave his lips.

“Who are you?!” Wangu Hanyan suppressed the fear in his heart, and he yelled, “What is your relationship with the Huang Family?!”
