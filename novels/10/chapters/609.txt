But, just as Huang Xiaolong left his Yard No.1, he ran into a group of inner disciples, and the person leading them was none other than Jiang Bi. Behind Jiang Bi were Li Dufeng and a dozen other inner disciples.

When Jiang Bi spotted Huang Xiaolong, his eyes narrowed all of a sudden.

“Huang Xiaolong.” Jiang Bi spoke in a slow and deliberate tone.

Huang Xiaolong was more casual and relaxed, “Jiang Bi.”

A fire burned in Jiang Bi’s heart seeing Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant attitude in facing him, causing him to snap, “Huang Xiaolong, later on the Rising Dragon Arena, I will make you understand that in my eyes you’re just a tethered horse prancing about. No matter how you jump, you’re but a horse. Wait till I break your legs, let’s see how you’re going to jump then!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted, “To me, you’re not even a horse, because in my eyes, you are nothing!”

“What?! Huang Xiaolong, don’t act so arrogant!”

“Our Senior Brother Jiang Bi needs only ten moves to take your life! No, not even ten moves!”

The inner disciples standing behind Jiang Bi shouted loudly, their faces twisted in anger. Jiang Bi’s eyes were spitting fire, glowering at Huang Xiaolong with unconcealed rage.

Li Dufeng spoke up at this time, “Huang Xiaolong, I’m not afraid to tell you honestly, Brother Jiang Bi found the legendary ancient Supreme Heavenly Ghost’s ‘Heavenly Ghost Record’. Now he’s a dual cultivator of Buddhism and Ghost techniques, allowing his strength to soar to unimaginable heights, definitely not something you can resist! If you know what’s good for you, apologize to Big brother Jiang Bi right now. For the sake of the Institute Principal, Big brother Jiang Bi will leave you some face on the Rising Dragon Arena!”

“That’s right, Senior Brother Jiang Bi’s strength is not something you can imagine!” The others joined in the clamor.

Jiang Bi stood without saying anything, merely looking coldly at Huang Xiaolong as if waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s decision.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind at all, “If that’s how you want to play, then on the Rising Dragon Arena, I’ll break your two legs before throwing you off the stage.”

“You!” Jiang Bi was stunned, anger erupted in his eyes. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In fact, he had been waiting for Huang Xiaolong to come over and apologize, but who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong was so outrageous, declaring that he would throw him off the Rising Dragon Arena after breaking both of his legs!

“Good! Huang Xiaolong, just you wait!” Jiang Bi forcefully repressed the boiling anger in his heart, signaling the group of inner disciples with a wave of his hand: “Let’s go!”

Watching Jiang Bi, Li Dufeng, and their followers fly away, Huang Xiaolong sneered. Jiang Bi truly wasn’t anything at all for the current him, moreover, he had never placed any importance on Jiang Bi. For Huang Xiaolong, his only opponent this time was that Xiang Mingzhi.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at his Master’s manor.

At that time, his Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun, Second Apprentice-brother Chen Yang, and Third Apprentice-sister Qi Wen were already there. Other than the three of them, there were also Grand Elder Chan Yu, Bao Xinrui, Elder Zhang Tianchuan, as well as other Grand Elders and Elders.

The instant Huang Xiaolong appeared in the main hall, all eyes turned to him, each of them with their own thoughts underneath their calm surface.

Feng Yan’s lips parted as if there were many things he wanted to say, but in the end, only two words were uttered: “Let’s go.” Leading everyone out of the main hall, they flew toward the Rising Dragon Arena.

“Junior Apprentice-brother, I heard that Jiang Bi is cultivating both Buddhism and Ghost techniques, and that his strength is not what it used to be.” Halfway, Eldest Apprentice-brother Liu Yun drew closer to Huang Xiaolong, speaking in low whispers, “Are you confident against him?”

Everyone’s ears perked up.

“Probably.” Huang Xiaolong smiled naturally.

“Probably?” Liu Yun observed Huang Xiaolong with a suspicious eye, “What’s the probability of you winning?”

“About sixty percent.” Huang Xiaolong pondered before answering. In fact, he merely needed one move to deal with that Jiang Bi.

“Sixty percent is good.” If Huang Xiaolong was victorious over Jiang Bi, losing to Xiang Mingzhi later would not make things look too bad.

After all, everyone knew that Huang Xiaolong had only cultivated for a short time. Being able to defeat Jiang Bi and snatch the title of Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciples’ leader was already shocking enough.

However, Grand Elder Chan Yu, Bao Xinrui, and some of the others didn’t really take Huang Xiaolong’s words at face value, doubt persisted in their hearts, thinking that Huang Xiaolong said ‘sixty percent’ just to save his own face.

They had heard about Jiang Bi’s current cultivation strength—late-Fourth Order God Realm.

Five years ago, Huang Xiaolong was only a Second Order God Realm. Five years later, could Huang Xiaolong defeat Jiang Bi who was a late-Fourth Order God Realm possessing the Golden Buddha Arhat Physique?

Different from the rest, Feng Yang’s eyes lit up when he heard Huang Xiaolong say that he had a sixty percent chance of defeating Jiang Bi. This fourth disciple’s character, Feng Yang knew better than anyone here, he would not exaggerate things on purpose. Since he said there was a sixty percent chance, then it shouldn’t be any less.

“Do your best.” Feng Yang encouraged.

“Yes, Master.” Huang Xiaolong acknowledged respectfully.

Shortly after, their group arrived at the Rising Dragon Arena. The Rising Dragon Arena and the Hidden Dragon Arena were both located on mountain peaks. The top of this peak was also cut off, creating a flat area with the Rising Dragon Arena built at the center. The viewing stands were constructed outside the stage perimeter. At the moment, these viewing stands were already filled with masters from super forces and families, and below the high viewing stands, the seats were packed with Black Warrior Institute disciples.

The arrival of Huang Xiaolong’s group instantly created a commotion in the arena, heads quickly turned in their direction.

“The black-haired kid beside the Black Warrior Institute Principal is that Huang Xiaolong?”

“Ever since the Black Warrior Institute’s disciple selection until the outer disciples’ assessment, Huang Xiaolong has yet to be defeated even once, winning the first place every time. This time, will he be able to keep his undefeated record?”

“Undefeated? I heard some rumors circulating saying that Jiang Bu now cultivates in dual Buddhism and Ghost techniques and even broke through to late-Fourth Order God Realm. That Huang Xiaolong is fated to be defeated tragically this time, not to mention the fact that there’s also Xiang Mingzhi.”

The various forces’ masters spoke in low hushed voices, and although it couldn’t be considered loud, it did not escape many of the God Realm masters in the arena, causing Black Warrior Institute Grand Elder Bao Xinrui and the others’ faces to darken slightly.

Huang Xiaolong, on the other hand, was calm as he followed behind his Master Feng Yang to the host viewing stand.

On the host viewing stand, Vice-Institute Principal Wang Na, and the other two Vice Institute Principals, Su Haodong and Li Zhiqun, as well as some Grand Elders and Elders who were in Wang Na’s faction had arrived earlier.

“Institute Principal!” Seeing Feng Yang, all stood up to salute. Despite being wholeheartedly unwilling, Wang Na could only stand and salute like everyone else.

Feng Yang nodded, his gaze sweeping over them and then took his seat in the main host seat. After him, Wang Na, Su Haodong, Li Zhiqun, Grand Elders like Chan Yu, Bao Xinrui, as well as the Elders took their seats.

“Huang Xiaolong, as the Institute Principal’s personal disciple, you must show a good performance on the Rising Dragon Arena later. You must absolutely not lose too uglily! Out Black Warrior Institute has always been impartial towards rewards and punishment, victorious disciples will be rewarded, and just the same, defeated disciples will be punished!” As she sat down, Wang Na directed at Huang Xiaolong in a lofty tone.

“Punish?” Feng Yang issued a cold harrumph, “Old witch, since when does my, Feng Yang’s, personal disciple need you to lord over him? Watch over your lower part well first!”

Wang Na having illicit affair with the Jiang Family’s Patriarch Jiang Wuhuang was an open secret.

Hearing these words coming out from the Institute Principal’s mouth, everyone’s expression was a scene to behold.

Liu Yun failed to control his laughter and ended up laughing loudly together with Huang Xiaolong. Their Master was indeed uniquely valiant, actually telling Wang Na to take care of her lower part in public!

Wang Na was furious: “You!” The murderous light in her eyes exploded, her face flushed a deep red from anger.

“What? Do you want to fight me?” Feng Yang totally ignored the other side’s fury, grinning complacently, “No problem, wait till the inner disciples’ assessment is over, I’ll play with you for a while on the stage. But, you alone are not my opponent, remember to call your adulterous partner as well.”

Adulterous partner, of course, referred to Jiang Wuhuang.

Wang Na nearly vomited blood then and there due to anger, no longer concealing the killing intent in her eyes.
