When Huang Xiaolong stepped into the Assembly Shrine’s hall, all eyes fell on him.

There were feelings of a fleeting complex in Wang Wei and Zhu Feng’s eyes as they looked at Huang Xiaolong. Even though both had concealed their true feelings well, a trace of surprise still showed on their faces.

Two months ago, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s return from the Clear Spirit World had spread like a wildfire. Along with that everyone had also heard about Huang Xiaolong’s astonishing advancement with regards to his cultivation, as he had broken through to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. This had shocked the Fortune Gate’s higher echelons, disciples, and even the various forces on Fortune Mainland.

Huang Xiaolong was still a mid-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm disciple during the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle. That was less than five years ago, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had actually broken through again and again, and now, he was already a high-level Ancient God Realm master, at late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!

How was this possible?!

Late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm in less than five years?!

Wang Wei and Zhu Feng had thought to themselves, so did Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and also the Fortune Gate Chief Zhu Yi.

Huang Xiaolong calmly saluted his two Masters and others upon arriving at the hall, despite other people’s shocked and complicated gazes.

Sky Sword Ancestor sighed enviously at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, “Frankly speaking, I’m really envious of you two brothers for having a disciple like Xiaolong.”

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor chuckled proudly.

“I’ve already said, we don’t mind at all if you’re willing to pass your legacy to Xiaolong.” Golden Brow Ancestor said with a wide smile.

Lightning Hammer Ancestor interjected, “I say, Old Sword, no matter what, you’ve already accepted two disciples, if you feel envious, what about me who doesn’t have even one disciple? If Xiaolong’s godhead were of lightning element, I surely would have passed on my legacy to him."

Blood Knife Ancestor smiled, "Looks like our darling disciple, Little Long Long is very popular ah." Everyone could hear smugness in his tone.

Goosebumps ran down Huang Xiaolong’s back when he heard Blood Knife Ancestor called him Little Long Long.

The Fortune Gate Chief Zhu Yi smiled faintly as he said, "It never crossed anyone’s mind that Xiaolong could breakthrough to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm. Xiaolong talent and great fortune are our Fortune Gate’s blessings. In God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, he will surely raise our Fortune Gate’s prestige!”

Zhu Feng agreed loudly, "Father is right, with Junior Brother Huang’s talent and strength, he’s bound to defeat all the sea tribes’ so-called geniuses during this trip to the sea tribes. In my opinion, even the sea tribes’ genius Feng Yingying is not a match against Junior Brother Huang, even less so the Guo Family’s Guo Jun!"

The entire hall fell into silence at Zhu Feng’s words.

Everyone one present knew that the sea tribes’ number one genius Feng Yingying was at least a mid-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, perhaps even a late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. It was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to defeat Feng Yingying at his current strength.

Zhu Feng’s words carried a taste of sarcasm.

Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, and Myriad Flames Ancestor were all frowning. Even Zhu Yi glared at Zhu Feng with dissatisfaction for a second. In Zhu Yi’s opinion, his son Zhu Feng was just too brash.

Wang Wei simply stood where he was, expressionless as if everything was unrelated to him.

“Alright, let’s set off now. Ancestors, what do you think?” Zhu Yi courteously asked Golden Brow Ancestor and others to break the heavy silence.

Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and the other Ancestors nodded. Zhu Yi was the Fortune Gate’s Chief after all, it is not appropriate that they reprimanded Zhu Feng in front of him.

Thus, every walked out of the Assembly Shrine’s hall, and then flew towards the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s exit.

This time, Fortune Gate’s Chief Zhu Yi was personally leading the group to the sea tribes’ God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, instead of Golden Brow Ancestor. Other than Zhu Yi, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor, Wang Wei, and Zhu Feng were joining the group that was setting off to the sea tribes.

Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, and Myriad Flames Ancestor were going to oversee the sect’s affairs during this time.

After they exited the Fortune Divine Kingdom, the group flew straight to the Fortune City’s transmission array nonstop, and transferred all the way. Several days later, they arrived at the Huo Prefecture City.

The group rested for a day in Huo Prefecture City, journeyed onwards the next day, and arrived on Wu Island. Only Wu Island’s transmission array could connect to other islands in the sea tribes’ region of the Endless Sea.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong wanted to see Luo Yunjie when he was at the Fortune Gate, but Luo Yunjie had gone to experience the outside world, hence, Huang Xiaolong had no other choice but to wait until the end of the God of the Sea Ceremony in order to meet Luo Yunjie, once he was back in Fortune Gate.

As there were Zhu Yi, Zhu Feng, and Wang Wei in the group, it was inconvenient for Huang Xiaolong to bring along Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er. Thus he had asked them to stay behind at the Myriad Gods Manor.

The group stayed for a day on Wu Island.

Huang Xiaolong took this time to pay a visit to Meng Yuan, the Head Supervisor of Infinite Circles Commerce Hall.

Now that the Pill Blending Tower was repaired, he needed to procure a great amount of various herbs and materials to get a stable supply of chaos spiritual pills to support his cultivation.

Although there were quite a lot of chaos spiritual herbs within the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure, Huang Xiaolong needed other supporting materials to refine these chaos spiritual herbs into pills; for example, refining the Reverse Incarnation Pill required more than a thousand kinds of ingredients, only the Golden Radiant Needle Mushroom, Blue Flaming Heart Fruit, Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus, Deep Sea Crystal, and Enigmatic Yang Thistle were chaos spiritual herbs.

Head Supervisor of Infinite Circles Commerce Hall Meng Yuan was agape when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s long list of herbs and other things. Each item on his list was a rare material.

“Brother Huang, are you sure you want to buy all the herbs and other materials listed here?” Meng Yuan swallowed audibly, and added, “A hundred of each item?”

Although Meng Yuan was unable to accurately add up the cost of one hundred copies of every item on the list, he was certain that it would be exorbitant!

Thirty trillion? Or forty trillion? Perhaps, even more than that!

“I’m certain.” Huang Xiaolong answered calmly. He had already expected such a reaction from Meng Yuan.

Meng Yuan looked at Huang Xiaolong. When he saw that he was serious, a radiant smile bloomed over his face, “Brother Huang, please wait for a moment, I’ll send someone to pick up the things on the list right away and send them over to you.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

Meng Yuan hastened away. He returned sometime later with a spatial ring in his hand. The spatial ring was open, revealing piles and piles of herbs within it.

“Brother Huang, inside this spatial ring are all the herbs and elixirs that you need.” He showed a trace of embarrassment as he said, “However, we only have around seven thousand kinds of herb elixirs in there, and not all of them are in a quantity of hundred.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had compiled a list of the items and the quantities that were in stock at the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall.

Huang Xiaolong swept over the list from Meng Yuan, and frowned subconsciously. ‘Only seven thousand kinds?’ Then he won’t be able to refine a few kinds of chaos spiritual pills, not to mention one of them was the chaos spiritual pill that he wanted to refine the most as well as the chaos spiritual pill that he needed the most.

The chaos spiritual pill was named ‘Soul Strengthening Heavenly Fire Divine Pill’. This chaos spiritual pill was used to nourish the soul. Even though he has the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell to nourish and strengthen his soul, it was not enough.

“But, Brother Huang, don’t worry, I’ll order the remaining two thousand or so kinds of herbs and elixirs. If they are available, I will have them sent here.” Meng Yuan said hurriedly as he noticed the frown on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement, ‘this was one method.’

However, he did not plan to rely on the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall entirely, as he decided to make a trip to check the trading houses in Void Sky World.

After paying a little over thirty trillion shenbi, Huang Xiaolong left the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall and headed back to accommodation for the Fortune Gate’s group.

However, when Huang Xiaolong left, Zhu Feng slowly stepped out from the inner hall. He watched Huang Xiaolong with doubt in his eyes, ‘Why is Huang Xiaolong buying such a large volume of herbs?’
