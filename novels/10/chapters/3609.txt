Chapter 3610 – Everywhere!

When Wang Xin noticed that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t taking his advice into account, he couldn’t help but shake his head. Perhaps, the man really knew Celestial Emperor Lin Xian, but even so, Wei Qi wasn’t going to care about that!

In the past, there were many people who knew God of Creation Realm experts at the grand completion stage who tried to ascend the mountain. They didn’t bring gifts with them, and neither did they bring a message from the expert in question. They were exactly like Huang Xiaolong and they were taught a lesson the moment they saw Wei Qi.

When that happened, they tried to get the God of Creation Realm experts they knew to seek justice on their behalf, but how in the world would a God of Creation at the grand completion stage mess with Zhou Chi?!

No one would offend a God of Creation Realm expert with 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy for a nobody!

As such, everyone who was sent rolling down the mountain could only suppress their anger.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the gazes around him and he continued to stroll towards the entrance.

He was stopped by the experts of the Ice Mountain the moment he approached. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

There weren’t too many experts stationed at the entrance, and there were probably sixty of them in total. All of them were experts who had comprehended at least eleven elements, and there were even some who had comprehended all thirteen elements!

All of them were obviously experts who chose to serve the Ice MOuntain.

The person who stopped Huang Xiaolong wasn’t Wei Qi. Instead, it was some random expert who had comprehended twelve elements. Wei Qi was sitting comfortably on his throne in the middle of the plaza.

A beauty brought a spiritual fruit to his lips as he sat there staring at the experts who wanted to enter the Ice Mountain. He was like an emperor who was staring down at his subjects!

As soon as the man stopped Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t bother with the formalities. He stretched out his hand and snapped, “Where’s your present? Hand it over for me to take a look.”

One wouldn’t be able to enter the mountain if they brought sub par gifts. Only presents that could rouse Wei Qi would allow one to enter the plaza.

“I didn’t bring any.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Get Zhou Chi to come out here. I wish to meet him.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t speak loudly, but everyone managed to hear what he said.

The expert who stopped him was stunned for a second and so was Wei Qi and the others.

“You didn’t bring anything?! You want Lord Zhou Chi to come out here to meet you?!” The man stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

He felt that Huang Xiaolong was going overboard, but he didn’t dare to offend the man. Instead, he turned to look at Wei Qi.

Wei Qi glanced at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye and he growled, “Who do you think you are?”

“You can call me the Blue Dragon Young Master. I know Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“Blue Dragon Young Master? Lin Xian?!” Wei Qi roared with laughter the moment the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “I have never heard of you in my life! Lin Xian? Hahaha! Did all of you hear this?! Some random b*stard who claims to know Celestial Emperor Lin Xian dares to call my master out!”

The beauty standing beside him giggled and everyone else burst into laughter.

The lady placed a spiritual fruit into Wei Qi’s mouth delicately and sneered, “I thought he’s the Son of Creation from the Limitless Celestial Empire from the way he spoke… Who would have thought that he's just some random lowlife.”

Glancing at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of her eye, she continued, “There hasn’t been anyone who dared to approach the entrance with no gifts… Lord Wei Qi, you’ll have to punish this man. Otherwise, our reputation will go down the drain!”

Wei Qi chuckled with glee, “Jiao’er, you’re amazing. You actually read my mind.” Turning to the man who stopped Huang Xiaolong, Wei Qi snorted, “Did we throw the last person who came here without gifts off the mountain? Alright, we’ll punish this little b*stard a little more. Break all his limbs and cripple his cultivation before throwing him off the mountain.”

Bowing respectfully, the expert repealed a sinister smile when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “I believe you heard what Lord Wei Qi said.”

“You can’t blame me for what’s about to come…”

“You can only blame yourself for being stupid!”

However, he discovered that he couldn’t even raise his hand after speaking. The space around him seemed to turn completely solid, and his body was like a solid block of wood.

This…

A look of confusion appeared on his face.

Huang Xiaolong sighed as he looked at the expert standing before him. “You’re right. You can only blame yourself for what’s about to come.”

Raising his hand slightly, the expert who comprehended twelve elements slowly turned into dust. From his head to his toe, he turned into specks of powder that drifted through the wind.

Wei Qi wanted to say something when he noticed that the man wasn’t moving, but his eyes widened in shock when he saw the figure of the man crumbling.

The experts of the Ice Mountain, along with those who came all this way to pay Zhou Chi a visit, were shocked!

Leaping to his feet, Wei Qi roared, “You… How dare you kill a subordinate of my Ice Mountain?!”

That was the first time anything of the kind happened.

No one dared to kill experts who served the Ice Mountain.

“I’ll give you one last chance. Call Zhou Chi out. Otherwise, you’ll suffer the same fate as him.” Huang Xiaolong muttered indifferently.

Roaring in rage, Wei Qi released his aura completely.

“Half step God of Creation!” Those standing around gasped in fright.

It was true that Wei Qi had reached the doors of the God of Creation Realm. He was even stronger than Ying Wuyou!

“Do you really think you can kill me?!” Wei Qi screamed, “Not even Lin Xian would dare to say something like this in front of my face! Even if a God of Creation at the grand completion stage arrives, he wouldn’t dare to touch a single hair on my head! You can try it if you have the guts to!”

“If you dare to lay a finger on me, you won’t be leaving this place alive!”

A mocking sneer could be seen in Wei Qi’s eyes when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong casually pressed downwards with his palm. Wei Qi felt as though the entire universe was crashing down on him.

It was something he had never felt in his life!

Before he could react, he was sent straight into the depths of the mountain range!

Wei Qi, who had unleashed all his strength just a moment ago, was flattened like a pancake!

“I don’t have a habit of touching a single hair on your head. What are you going to do now that I touched every single hair on your body?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.
