Chapter 3715: Universe Source Stone

After his seclusion, Huang Xiaolong reached the 29.9 billion mark. In fact, he was one strand of grand cosmos energy away from reaching the 30 billion mark!

He reached his current level more than a hundred thousand years ago. However, he had been trying to break through with all his might but to no avail. It was like when he tried to break through to the peak of the grand competition stage in the past!

All these years, Huang Xiaolong might have tried to understand the mysteries of the Nameless Devil Mirror, but he only managed to comprehend thirty to forty percent of it. He was slightly lacking when it came to entering the half-step Universe God Realm.

He wanted to continue his seclusion in order to understand the mysteries behind the Thirteen Universes, but Bi Qing returned with news that the White Feather King’s search for a Universe Source Stone found some headway in the past few years.

How could Huang Xiaolong not know what the Universe Source Stone was?

He heard from the Ferocious Devil that the Universe Source Stone was the core of the Extermination Formation. The first Extermination Tribulation suffered by the Thirteen Universes was extremely powerful due to the presence of the Universe Source Stone!

The Universe Source Stone was created by the Thirteen Universes during their birth. Legends had it that it was the source of the Thirteen Universes. It was the reason behind the birth of spiritual energy in all the lands.

It was extremely hard to locate even a single piece, and the Universe First Race only managed to find one after god knows how many years. Who would have thought that they would be able to locate another one?

Huang Xiaolong was unable to stop the Extermination Formation in the past, but now that he had reached his current level, he would stop them with everything he had! He couldn’t allow them to obtain the piece of Universe Source Stone!

Even though he made some alterations to the runes he inscribed, the Black Nether King would be able to discover his petty tricks the moment they activated the formation. He might be able to destroy the formation once, but once they fixed it, he wouldn’t be able to do it again!

As for the universe-level spiritual veins he stole, he was sure that the Universe First Race would simply use a vast quantity of lower leveled spiritual veins to activate the formation.

As such, all his tricks up to this point were pretty much useful in delaying them slightly. If he obtained the Universe Source Stone, he would really be able to impact their activation of the formation.

Without the source stone, they could only use something else for the core of their formation. That would greatly affect the power behind the formation and the tribulation would decrease in strength. If the Black Nether King wanted to use the tribulation to harvest all the lives in the Thirteen Universes, it would be much more difficult with Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

If he failed this time, no one knew when the Black Nether King could try again. When that happened, Huang Xiaolong’s chances of entering the Universe God Realm before him would be so much higher!

Leaving the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong saw Bi Qing and Yin Xue.

“Lord!” They bowed respectfully.

He asked about matters regarding the Universe Source Stone when they got up.

“The White Feather King has already left to obtain the stone,” Bi Qing mentioned.

“Do you know where he went?”

Bi Qing shook his head slowly and replied, “No one knows where he went. The last we heard, he left the Universe Vault in search of the Universe Source Stone.”

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. It was useless if he didn’t know where the White Feather King went. There was no way he could search aimlessly. The Thirteen Universes were boundless, and even if he used several hundred million years, he might not be able to discover anything! By that time, the Universe Source Stone would have already landed in the White Feather King’s hands!

“His disciple, Ninth Void, might know where he went,” Yin Xue muttered. “The White Feather King has always doted on his disciple.”

“NInth Void!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

As the White Feather King’s inheritance disciple, he might really know where his master went!

“Where is Ninth Void now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“He left the Ninth Void Valley several months ago for the Blue Phoenix Palace.”

“Blue Phoenix Palace?”

“That’s right. Ninth Void has always been interested in Qing Luan,” Bi Qing muttered.

Qing Luan, the owner of the Blue Phoenix Palace, was the daughter of the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King.

The Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King ranked below the Golden Cymbals King. The Golden Cymbals King was ranked sixth among the kings, and the Blood Phoenix Queen ranked seventh. The Titan King was ranked eighth, but they were the only couple among the thirteen kings.

Qing Luan, Yin Xue, and Chi Feng were the greatest beauties in the Universe First Race. However, Qing Luan was weaker than the other two in terms of talent. Her combat abilities were stuck at the 19 billion mark and she wasn’t able to compete for the position of the six geniuses.

Even so, she was a goddess in the eyes of the men in the Universe First Race. Ninth Void was one of her many suitors.

When Huang Xiaolong heard that Ninth Void had left his palace, he grabbed Pangu and left.

When he fought for the Universe Source Stone, everyone in the Universe First Race would know that Pangu was his master. Since they couldn’t kill Huang Xiaolong, their target would shift over to Pangu! In order to keep his master safe, Huang Xiaolong decided to bring him away from the Universe Vault.

As the Blue Phoenix Palace wasn’t located too far away from the Snow Continent, Huang Xiaolong arrived in less than a month.

Releasing his dao souls, he discovered Ninth Void’s presence almost immediately. Qing Luan was hosting him with a massive banquet, and there were countless experts present.

Huang Xiaolong discovered the presence of two supreme experts with close to 27 billion units of combat abilities.

There was no room for doubt. It was the Blood Phoenix Queen and the Titan King!

Even though they were both present, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried in the slightest. He might have been afraid of them in the past, but right now, he could suppress them with a single arm!

Summoning the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong sent countless branches into the void to seal off the space around the city.

…

Qing Luan giggled slightly when she looked at Ninth Void. “I heard that Big Brother Ninth Void managed to obtain the Golden Crow Divine Tree from the Golden Crow Divine Race…”

The Golden Crow Divine Tree might not be comparable to the Star Dragon Divine Tree, but it was an absolute treasure in the Thirteen Universes!

“Little Sister Qing Luan is really well-informed!” Reaching out slightly, a tiny tree appeared in his palm. Golden flames filled the space around him and one could make out tiny golden crows if they looked closely.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
