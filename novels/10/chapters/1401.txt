Huang Xiaolong shook his head after hearing the bid for ‘forty million’ from private room number seven.

“The woman next door is really merciless, as she has the essence of this cow’s domineering style from the past!” The little cow praised unabashedly.

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes, which clearly meant, ‘your style is not domineering, that’s cow-mineering.’

In the end, the Thunderstorm Divine Robe was bought by the pretty young lady from private room number seven for forty million high grade-seven spirit stones.

With that, the curtains fell on the auction.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and the rest stepped out from their private room.

Just as Huang Xiaolong stepped out of the door, he came across Song Rui and Gudu Yue who were coming out of private room number five. Murderous cold gleams flickered across their eyes when both of them saw Huang Xiaolong. According to Gudu Yue, those space velocity stones and Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits would have been his, if it wasn’t for Huang Xiaolong!

Not just that, but Gudu Yue had also believed that he could have bought the space velocity stones with five hundred thousand high grade-seven spirit stones. But Huang Xiaolong had obviously spoiled his plan.

Gudu Yue strode towards Huang Xiaolong with a menacing gaze. “Kid, don’t think that you’re great for getting those space velocity stones and Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits. Everything will depend on whether you live to refine them!”

Huang Xiaolong replied indifferently, “That’s not for you to worry about.”

Anger exploded in Gudu Yue’s eyes as he spat, “Let’s hope you that can hide inside the Martial Dragon City forever!”

The Martial Dragon City was the Longwu Clan’s territory, thus, Gudu Yue did not dare to attack Huang Xiaolong blatantly inside the Martial Dragon City. However, things would be different once Huang Xiaolong were to step outside of the Martial Dragon City.

“Go!” Gudu Yue harrumphed coldly as he turned around and left.

Song Rui glared daggers at Huang Xiaolong before leaving.

“Xiaolong, do you want me to go up and directly resolve that fella?” The little cow grumbled at Huang Xiaolong, while her gaze was fixed on Gudu Yue. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong was speechless but retorted, “We’re in Martial Dragon City.”

The little cow snickered, “Don’t worry! Even if I smashed the whole Martial Dragon City, the Longwu Clan’s Patriarch won’t dare to let out a fart, given my younger generation grand-disciple’s relation with the Longwu Clan’s Old Ancestor.”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised, but he shook his head and said, “Forget it.”

Even though the little cow might have been telling the truth, Huang Xiaolong didn’t want any trouble.

It was more urgent to repair the Giant Shark Flying Ship in order to reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds as soon as possible. He had already overstayed in the High Martial World.

Huang Xiaolong had barely taken two steps when a young lady walked out from private room number seven and demanded, “You’re the one who won the bid for the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, right?” In the next second, her demeanor changed, and she looking a little shy as she asked, “Erm, could you sell one of them to me? I want to know the taste of the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit...”

Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San looked at her agape.

The pretty young lady was wearing an innocent and naive expression as she looked at Huang Xiaolong, and her eyes were shining in anticipation. Anyone would have found it difficult to refuse her due to her expression.

Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased slightly, but he shook his head and replied, “I don’t lack money.”

Yes, what he lacked at that moment was strength.

He could condense as many spirit stones as he wanted. Moreover, once he would break through to Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm, he would be able to condense low grade-eight spirit stones. Money was going to be less of a problem once he entered the mid-level Ancestor God Realm.

As Huang Xiaolong refused her request, the young lady stamped her feet and complained, “Why are you so stingy? Fine then, this Miss doesn’t want it anymore. I’ve already checked you out, you’re Huang Xiaolong, am I right? You are our Fortune Emperor Palace’s Vientiane World branch’s disciple, and you’re planning to register for the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Huang Xiaolong and the rest of his group were stunned. Even the little cow was surprised. This young lady must have had Huang Xiaolong investigated in the midst of the auction, in less than half a day’s time, her people had already managed to investigate Huang Xiaolong’s background.

It was not an easy task to investigate a stranger’s background in the vast Divine World in half a day’s time. It seems this young lady’s quite powerful, at the very least, she was able to use the influence of a powerful background.

Moreover, the little cow had noticed that the young lady had mentioned ‘Fortune Emperor Palace.’ Did that mean that this young lady was the Fortune Gate headquarters’ disciple?

“Wait till you come to the Fortune Emperor Palace, you won’t know what hit you!” The young lady wrinkled her small nose and announced, “Remember, my name is Fang Xuanxuan!”

“Old Tong, we’re leaving!” The young lady Fang Xuanxuan said to the two old women.

Huang Xiaolong’s mouth opened to say something, but in the end, he silently watched the young lady’s group leave without saying a word.

“Fang Xuanxuan?” Huang Xiaolong repeated under his breath. He remembered that Golden Brow Ancestor had once mentioned that surname of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Gate Chief was Fang. Is that young lady related to the Fortune Emperor Palace? And was she the Emperor’s disciple or related in anyway?

“Heihei..., Xiaolong, you’ve provoked trouble this time.” The little cow was clearly gloating. “It looks like that girl is a Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple, with a very high status. She’ll probably make your life miserable when you reach the Fortune Emperor Palace. If I were you, I would have definitely agreed to such a pretty girl’s small request. Isn’t it just one Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit?”

Huang Xiaolong glared at the little cow. "I remember that it was you who had told me to get the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit, even if it meant forgoing the Thunderstorm Divine Robe."

The little cow chuckled in embarrassment, and shook her head. “Did I? This cow’s memory has always been bad. Can’t remember it.”

Huang Xiaolong felt an impulse to kick her after hearing her explanation.

“Those two old women are quite strong. Although their strength couldn’t be compared to my peak strength, their strength is still not far away from it.” Xiang Xun said suddenly, as he had been paying attention to the two old women.

His words astonished Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, and the others, and they stared at the two old women, who were following behind Fang Xuanxuan. These two old women are very powerful experts!

Once again, this proved that the young lady’s status was high in the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong felt an onslaught of headaches. At a glance, it was obvious to him that the young lady was mischievous and playful. Huang Xiaolong could see dark clouds in his future as he would be targeted by her.

He turned and saw the little cow’s gloating expression. In the next second, his palm struck the little cow’s forehead and he ordered, “Go back!”

Now, there was only one thing he could do—go back and repair the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group was back at the residence.

The moment they were all inside the residence, Huang Xiaolong activated all the attack and defensive formations of the residence. He then ordered Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the little cow to further strengthen their defenses by using a few more layers of defensive formations.

Repairing the Giant Shark Flying Ship was not an easy task, and it was going to take a long time. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong did not want anyone interrupting their progress.

Even though they were inside the Martial Dragon City, it was better to be safe than sorry. Caution was a good habit.

It turned out that Huang Xiaolong’s strength was weak for repairing a top-grade chaos spiritual artifact, like the Giant Shark Flying Ship. Therefore, at the end of the day, the task fell on Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s shoulders.

After learning that Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng would need three to four months to repair the Giant Shark Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong decisively entered his room and began cultivating.

Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged inside his room and called out his three avatars. They positioned themselves into a four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation, and Huang Xiaolong took out one of the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.
