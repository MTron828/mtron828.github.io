Chapter 2239: Speaking Incoherently

“Let him wait?” The disciple was startled.

“What? Do you have any objections?” Xiao Feng snorted when he saw the disciple’s hesitation.

The disciple was taken aback, and he quickly shook his head. Stepping back, the disciple decided to do as Xiao Feng said.

Before long, the disciple returned to the outer hall and approached Huang Xiaolong, who was sitting down with his eyes closed. “Custodian Xiao Feng has passed down his order. He will assess you tomorrow!”

“Tomorrow?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened, and a terrifying light flashed through them.

“If I ask you to wait, you shall wait. If you have any objections, you can find Custodian Xiao Feng and make your complaint!” The disciple was frustrated from Xiao Feng’s lecture, and he directed all his pent-up anger on Huang Xiaolong.

He then walked off without caring about Huang Xiaolong.

Staring at the disciple who was walking away, Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of irritation rising in his heart. “Xiao Feng!”

The next day.

Inside the hall, Xiao Feng looked towards the sky and turned to Song Shaokang, “Brother Shaokang, do you want to observe that brat’s assessment?”

Song Shaokang shook his head, “What’s there to see? He’s just going to waste my time. I’ll sit here and wait for him to crawl over to beg me to forgive him!”

Xiao Feng laughed, “Indeed, with Brother Shaokang’s status, there’s no need for you to take a look at a nameless junior’s assessment.” After speaking, he left Song Shaokang and prepared to administer the assessment for Huang Xiaolong.

After all, it wasn’t good for him to delay the assessment for such a long time. Even though he was a custodian in charge of the branch division in the Falling Jade Dynasty, he still had to obey the rules of the Holy Gate.

There were still high custodians and even the division master with authorities surpassing him!

Soon, Xiao Feng arrived in the outer hall and saw Huang Xiaolong adjusting his breath. A cold sneer left his lips, “Do you still want to take the assessment? If you do, follow me now. Otherwise, get lost!”

Perhaps it was because he had conversed with Song Shaokang previously, but the trace of disgust he felt for Huang Xiaolong increased.

An indifferent look hung on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he followed Xiao Feng into the inner hall.

The inner hall for the assessment was massive. It was about a thousand square meters in size. In the middle of the hall there was a large ancient array with densely engraved runes with a humongous ‘Holy’ character carved onto the eye of the array.

The ‘Holy’ character contained the meaning of heaven and earth, and it contained supreme laws and dao. Faint holy light surrounded it.

Rays of light exuding majestic aura filled the hall, and everyone who laid eyes on it would be filled with a feeling of worship.

“Brat, what are you still standing there for? Hurry up and get in!” Xiao Feng snapped when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong was standing rooted to his spot.

Huang Xiaolong stared coldly at Xiao Feng for a brief moment before walking into the array.

When Xiao Feng felt the gaze and disprect coming from Huang Xiaolong who was only a mere Ninth Order Sovereign, his expression got even icier. Wait until the end of the assessment to see how I deal with you!

At that time, even if Song Shaokang failed to take action, he would definitely do something to show Huang Xiaolong who was the boss.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had gotten into position, Xiao Feng’s hand moved and activated the array using a mysterious technique.

In fact, the assessment was very simple. As soon as the array was activated, nothing else needed to be done. As long as one had a Saint physique, Saint bloodline, or a Complete Dao Saint Godhead, the ‘Holy’ character would light up. Depending on one’s talent, the character would light up with different colors.

If the person being tested had none of the three, the character wouldn’t light up. There was an exception and that was if one’s talent was astounding, the character would emit a faint light.

As Xiao Feng continued activating the array, the densely engraved patterns in the middle of the array started flickering in succession. In the end, splendid lights rose up from the middle of the array.

As rays of light landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, a wave of comfort swept through him. It was as though he had swallowed an origin spiritual pill of the highest grade.

Xiao Feng smirked as he stood outside the array and saw Huang Xiaolong’s comfortable expression. Let’s see if you can still remain so haughty in a moment.

Most disciples would feel comfortable at the start, but as the light rays increased in strength, some participants with weaker godheads, physiques, or bloodlines would experience extreme pain.

After seeing Huang Xiaolong’s comfortable expression, Xiao Feng couldn’t help but increase the speed of his activation.

In an instant, splendid lights continuously rose from the array and seeped into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

A frown soon formed on Xiao Feng’s face when he realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t feeling any different from before.

He squinted his eyes all of a sudden when he realized that strange rays of faint light were covering Huang Xiaolong’s body. Even though they were faint, the light rays were extremely dazzling, and they seemed to be comparable to those coming from the eye of the array. In fact, it seemed a little brighter than that!

Could this be...?!

Xiao Feng was stunned.

The light surrounding Huang Xiaolong grew brighter and brighter as green light lit up on the ‘Holy’ character under his feet.

Looking at the green light, Xiao Feng’s chest tightened, his eyes widened, and a look of shock appeared on his face.

Green light rays!

If the participants had a saint physique, the “Holy” character would emit green light.

Didn’t this mean...?

Xiao Feng’s face turned ugly.

Huang Xiaolong actually had a saint physique! Regardless of the type of saint physique, Huang Xiaolong would be a disciple of the Holy Gate!

With his status, there wasn’t a need to mention him! Even Song Shaokang wouldn’t be able to do anything to Huang Xiaolong in the future!

“Thank god this kid only possesses a saint physique!” Xiao Feng’s expression was ugly as he comforted himself.

Since Song Shaokang had a saint bloodline, his status would be a lot higher than Huang Xiaolong in the Holy Gate. Even if he offended Huang Xiaolong, he had formed some sort of friendship with Song Shaokang and his gains could be said to have made up for his losses.

Following the endless light rays entering Huang Xiaolong’s body, one of the saint bloodlines inside his body started vibrating.

Buzz!

The “Holy” character under Huang Xiaolong started buzzing.

Xiao Feng’s eyes widened further when he stared at the character in the array. His body started trembling. Could it be...?! No, no, it’s impossible!

As the buzzing sound grew louder and louder, rays of red light emerged from the character under Huang Xiaolong’s feet.

The green and red lights twisted around each other and it was a breathtaking sight. The entire hall was filled with resplendent rays of light as Huang Xiaolong stood in the middle of the array.

“Saint... saint bloodline” Xiao Feng’s voice trembled uncontrollably, “This... me... him...” He said incoherently.
