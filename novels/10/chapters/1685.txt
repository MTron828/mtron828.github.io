Huang Xiaolong was naturally happy to feel the improvement in his strength.

At this rate, when he climbs up to the twelfth floor, how much would his strength improve?

Early Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?!

No, definitely higher than early Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

His Senior Brother Jiang Hong had predicted that he could win first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court if he managed to break through to the Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Whereas now, there were about thirty years left until the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

Calming his bubbling joy, Huang Xiaolong began to adjust his condition. After half an hour of adjusting his condition, his depleted godforce recovered completely. Only then did Huang Xiaolong fly through the entryway leading to the fourth floor.

The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared on the fourth floor, the Holy Mountain’s outer surface emitted dazzling rays of light like a blossoming golden flower, primarily in the fourth floor’s location. Several million li radius were bathed in bright golden light.

The various forces’ experts waiting outside the Holy Mountain looked slightly dazed, then their expressions turned from astonished and shocked to dumbfounded.

“Someone has cleared the third floor! This, this, in only half a day! From the time the Holy Mountain’s entrance appeared, it has only been half a day, but someone has already passed the first three floors!”

“This is the first time in history! Unprecedented! Ascending three floors in half a day! That year, Castellan Qin Fan had taken over a month to finish clearing the third floor, right?!”

“That’s right, more precisely, Castellan Qin Fan spent thirty-six days and four hours!”

“Unparalleled genius! Who is this person exactly? Is it Qin Huangzhong, or is it Shi Yinyu? Or an unparalleled genius from the ancient hidden families?”

The experts outside were in a furor of excitement, sinking in astonishment.

Even Desolate Giant Tai Yue, Demon King Fan Hui, Asura King Jin Yuan, and Golden Lionman Wan Yutian stared speechlessly at the Holy Mountain’s fourth floor for a long time.

Earlier, someone clearing the first two floors in less than an hour had already been shocking enough for them. And now, someone clearing three floors’ obstacles in half a day was totally unheard of, despite witnessing it with their own eyes. This had exceeded their scope of knowledge.

“Would it be our Master?” Jin Yuan asked hoarsely, and his throat felt a little dry.

“Probably not.” Tai Yue shook his head.

Although they had seen Huang Xiaolong’s astounding talent, none of them dared to dream that Huang Xiaolong could ascend three floors in half a day. In the past, it had taken Qin Fan thirty-six days and four hours to clear the first three floors’ obstacles. In their opinions, their Master could have been faster than Qin Fan, but not to this stupefying degree.

Huang Xiaolong was unaware of this furor on the outside.

Radiant rays condensed in front of Huang Xiaolong as he entered the fourth floor. A split second later, three holy fruits appeared in midair.

Though Huang Xiaolong was confident that he would be the first person, he couldn’t help feeling a burst of joy when he saw three holy fruits.

He had nine holy fruits now!

Since he was the first person to clear three floors consecutively, Huang Xiaolong had collected nine holy fruits.

Huang Xiaolong collected the three holy fruits and kept them in his Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle, then flew forward.

This time, appearing in front of Huang Xiaolong, was a sea of stone monsters. These stone monsters were more than ten meters tall and blackish all over, except for their glowing crimson eyes.

These are... Blackstone Monsters? Huang Xiaolong searched through his memories.

The Blackstone Monster was a rare monster, and there were very few records about Blackstone Monsters. But without doubt, these Blackstone Monsters’ defenses were on another level compared to the beasts on the first three floors.

Moreover, these Blackstone Monsters were much harder to kill than the hell beasts on the first three floors.

Perhaps it was fortunate that there were only ten thousand of these late-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Blackstone Monsters.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath as if preparing himself for a long battle ahead. His three supreme godheads spun to the limit as he flew straight towards one of the Blackstone Monsters.

This time, Huang Xiaolong did not use lightning clouds as a form of attack.

The lightning attacks were powerful; however, the most effective power to kill these Blackstone Monsters was actually wood element energy.

Huang Xiaolong extended his arms out to the sides, and his three supreme godheads’ godforce surged out. In an instant, he was entirely concealed in a green light cocoon. Wood element supreme godforce turned the surroundings into a sea of flickering lights that condensed into robust green divine dragons.

Huang Xiaolong accelerated forward, crossing the distance between him and the Blackstone Monsters in a split second. With a wave of his hands, green wood element divine dragons shot out like arrows, piercing through the Blackstone Monsters.

Wood restricts earth.

In the blink of an eye, several Blackstone Monsters were smashed into crumbles by these green divine dragons.

Wood element supreme godforce easily broke these Blackstone Monsters’ vitality.

But to Huang Xiaolong’s surprise, these crumbled Blackstone Monsters did not die but reassembled themselves.

Almost in the blink of an eye, these crumbled Blackstone Monsters were as good as before.

Upon seeing this result, Huang Xiaolong’s palms struck out. Numerous green divine dragons once again smashed into the rows of Blackstone Monsters. After three consecutive attacks, the crumbled Blackstone Monsters no longer reassembled. Pieces of stones turned into energy that was absorbed by Huang Xiaolong.

After absorbing the energy from these Blackstone Monsters, a refreshingly comfortable feeling filled Huang Xiaolong.

The energy from the first three floors was incomparable to the energy from these Blackstone Monsters.

Huang Xiaolong was delighted at this result.

He distinctively discovered that the energy from these Blackstone Monsters not only rose his strength but also temper his soul and body.

That motivated Huang Xiaolong further and he dove into the sea of Blackstone Monsters. Groups and groups of Blackstone Monsters crumbled and turned into energy.

Ten Blackstone Monsters, twenty, thirty, one hundred, one thousand...

By the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong had killed six thousand out of the ten thousand Blackstone Monsters. During this time, his cultivation had risen to the peak of the early Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

At this time, finally, another person cleared the second floor’s obstacles and arrived at the entrance of the third floor.

This person was Shi Yinyu.

Because Shi Yinyu had gotten ‘third place’ when clearing the first floor’s obstacles, his anger had fueled him on the second floor. Due to this, Shi Yinyu had resorted to using an ancient secret technique that he had never used in the past. Finally, he had successfully reached the third floor ahead of Qin Huangzhong.

While clearing both the first and second floor’s obstacles, Shi Yinyu had merely spent a little over a day. This speed was slightly better even compared to Qin Fan’s records.

However, when only two holy fruits appeared before him, Shi Yinyu’s expression turned gloomy in an instant.

He had resorted to an ancient technique that he had never used before. Even his Grandfather wouldn’t have been able to help but lament at the power of this ancient technique when he had killed the hell beasts on the second floor, yet it had only won him the second place?!

There was someone one step faster than him!

“Is it Qin Huangzhong?” A dark glimmer flickered across Shi Yinyu’s eyes. “Does it mean that Qin Huangzhong is the foe who could threaten me amongst Hell’s younger generation geniuses, that Grandfather had mentioned? Qin Huangzhong, I admit that I had underestimated you in the past, but the third floor’s first place is mine!”

This time, he was prepared to use an even more powerful ancient secret technique.

“Qin Huangzhong, I hope you won’t disappoint me.”

With amazing speed, Shi Yinyu flew onto the third floor. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Soon, a light glimmered on the third floor’s entryway as a figure appeared. The third person who had just cleared the second floor’s obstacles was... Qin Huangzhong.
