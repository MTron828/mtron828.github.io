Chapter 1579: Saint Artifact?

“This might be a saint artifact!” When Huang Xiaolong was still thinking about what it could be, the little cow yelled with an expression that could only be described as uncontrollable excitement.

“Saint artifact!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned. After snapping back to his sense, he asked in amazement, “Is this the saint artifact you were talking about in the past?”

The little cow had mentioned the saint artifact many times in the past but this time, she didn’t bother explaining it to him. Instead, an enigmatic expression appeared on her face.

Huang Xiaolong raised the chaos lightning bead in his hand and wondered, how is this a saint artifact?

“Is a saint artifact something better than the treasures born in the grandmist era? Are grandmist spiritual artifacts better than saint artifacts?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t withhold the curiosity in his heart and he asked. Why else would the little cow and his senior brother, Jiang Hong, be so excited when he obtained it?

The little cow nodded resolutely, “That’s right. Even though grandmist spiritual artifacts are treasures, none of them can be compared to a saint artifact! This is either a spiritual artifact born by the world, or it would be something a Saint Realm expert refined using the saintforce in his body!”

“Saint Realm expert?!” Huang Xiaolong swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

His senior brother, Jiang Hong, was definitely not a Saint Realm cultivator. In fact, even his master, the king of grandmist, wasn’t a Saint Realm cultivator! Could it be that there was the so-called ‘Saint Realm’ after someone surpasses the Emperor Realm?

The little cow nodded yet again. “You heard right, I’m talking about someone at the Saint Realm. However, this is someone I’ve only heard of in the legends. I’ve never seen an expert at the Saint Realm in my life. Obviously, I haven’t seen any saint artifacts in my life...”

Huang Xiaolong felt that something was off. “How do you know that this is a saint artifact then? Since no one has seen a cultivator at the Saint Realm, why would you know anything about it?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The little cow stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock and failed to reply. After thinking of how to respond, she opened her eyes wide and said, “So what if no one has seen them before? That can’t prove that they don’t exist. Since the legends spoke about Saint Realm experts, there has to be records of it! So what if I haven’t seen saint artifacts before? Can’t I make a deduction?!”

Huang Xiaolong was left speechless.

A deduction... Do things even work that way?

“However, this is my judgement of it. It might not turn out to be a saint artifact after all...” The little cow shook her head before continuing, “Actually, you might be right. No one has ever seen a Saint Realm expert in their life. It might just be a myth that they exist.”

“Even people like your master and I aren’t able to sense the existence of the Saint Realm, how will anyone else possibly sense that realm? If someone really cultivated to the Saint Realm, why hasn’t he made an appearance in the billions of years of existence?”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the chaos lightning bead in his hand again and saw that tiny cracks were dancing on the surface of the item.

Despite the amount of effort he put in to study this item, he wasn’t able to find anything new about it.

Could it be that the chaos lightning bead was really a saint artifact?

Huang Xiaolong’s heart shook. Didn’t the barbaric space come into existence during the grandmist era? Was it possible that it was a space created by a Saint Realm expert?!

The more he thought about it, the more he felt like heading back to the Floating Twilight Land after meeting with his master, the king of grandmist. He wanted to take his time to search every inch of the barbaric space as he felt that there might be something hidden there.

Why would a barbaric space possess so many different treasures?! There was the purple grandmist aura, the grandmist aura, and even the chaos lightning bead which might or might not be a saint artifact. It was indeed baffling.

“Kiddo Huang, you should do your research on the chaos lightning bead when you have time. When do you plan to head to the Grandmist Lands?” The little cow asked before she became distracted again, “After so many years of not seeing that old man, I’m starting to miss that stubble on his chin.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “We’ll head over to the Silver Fox Chamber of Commerce before going over to the Grandmist Lands.”

“Why do you want to visit the Silver Fox Chamber of Commerce?” Her eyes spun and she started giggling, “You brat! You’re definitely thinking about Bei Xiaomei! Don’t worry! Even someone like me will pine for a fresh and pure, mesmerizing and cute little girl like her!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hold himself back as he sent a kick flying towards the little cow. “Shut up!”

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong remained in the Dragon Tiger Palace Gardens with the ladies and he didn’t bother going back to his immortal cave.

After the few leisurely days had passed, Huang Xiaolong headed over to Zhao Lei’s palace to bid him farewell.

After paying a visit to the Silver Fox Chamber of Commerce, he would be heading over to the Grandmist Emperor Palace to pay respects to his other master, the king of grandmist. After leaving the Grandmist Lands, he was planning to return to the Barbaric Space in the Floating Twilight Land. He also had to head over to the Hell Asura World to look for the king of hell’s inheritance after that.

As such, he would only be able to return after several tens of years.

When Zhao Lei heard the news, he stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. After all, his disciple would only be back in time for the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

“There are around eighty years to the Battle of the Heavenly Court! You little brat! Can’t you cultivate peacefully in the Fortune Emperor Palace?” Zhao Lei cursed.

Huang Xiaolong mused, “Master, you should know that I’m not someone who can endure loneliness. I plan to head over to the Hell Asura World during my adventures.”

As for the part where he was planning to go to the Grandmist Lands, he kept it a secret from Zhao Lei.

“What?! Why are you going to the Hell Asura World?!” Zhao Lei yelled in shock. He knitted his brows together and said, “What do you plan to do there?!” Anyone who heard about the Hell Asura would think that Huang Xiaolong was crazy.

“I found a treasure from one of the experts in hell and the inheritance is located in the Hell Asura World. I plan to head over there to check things out. If I am able to receive that expert’s inheritance, I will be able to grow much stronger before the Battle of the Heavenly Court.”

Zhao Lei instantly understood Huang Xiaolong’s intentions and he nodded, “I never thought that you’ll be lucky enough to obtain a treasure from an Emperor Realm level expert. Since that is the case, I shall no longer stop you. However, you have to be careful after entering the Hell Asura World.”

Huang Xiaolong was referring to the king of hell’s inheritance. However, from what Zhao Lei gathered, he felt that Huang Xiaolong had merely found an inheritance from some random Emperor.

Stunned for words, Huang Xiaolong didn’t try to explain himself. “Master, please rest assured. I will take care of myself.”

After staying in Zhao Lei’s palace for several hours, Huang Xiaolong decided that it was time to leave.

After some considerations, Huang Xiaolong went over to Fang Gan’s palace for a short visit. Fang Xuanxuan was there as well and when the father and daughter duo heard that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over to the Hell Asura World, their reaction was basically the same as Zhao Lei.

After an hour, Fang Xuanxuan escorted Huang Xiaolong out of the palace.

“Xiaolong, can you please help me to look for my older brother in the Hell Asura World? I am extremely worried about him...” Fang Xuanxuan hesitated for a moment before stating her request.

Seeing the anxious look on Fang Xuanxuan’s face, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, “Yes, I will.”

“What’s your older brother called again?”

“He’s called Fang Mingyu.” Fang Xuanxuan said without skipping a beat.

Fang Mingyu? Huang Xiaolong blanked out for a second.

“He gave me this in the past. He also has one on him. Here, you wear it.” Fang Xuanxuan held out a circular jade pendant and passed it to Huang Xiaolong. Her face was slowly starting to heat up and no one knew what she was thinking.

Even though the jade pendant was given to her by her older brother, she had been wearing it her whole life. There was still her scent lingering on the piece when she handed it over to Huang Xiaolong.
