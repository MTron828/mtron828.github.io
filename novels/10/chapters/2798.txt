Chapter 2799: Immemorial Sword

The Saint Devil Prince’s expression turned extremely ugly. If Yi Xiaotang weren’t present, he wouldn’t have felt so humiliated. However, everyone had heard his previous promise, including Aunt Qing, and his subordinates.

While refusing to look at Yi Xiaotang, Xu Jian glared at Huang Xiaolong and snapped, “I said that I’ll do it if you had seven or more…”

“You’ll have to bring out eight high-order Saint Fates for me to kill myself, not seven.”

With a frown on her face, Yi Xiaotang felt that the Saint Devil Prince’s image in her mind was getting more and more repulsive.

He was clearly trying to renege on his promise!

When Aunt Qing heard what he said, she felt that it was a little inappropriate for the Saint Devil Prince to back down. However, the reputation of the Blue Heaven Creed was at stake, and she couldn’t force a disciple of the faction to kill himself.

A smile crept up on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he asked, “Are you sure you’ll kill yourself if I bring out an eighth high-order Saint Fate?”

With his face flushed, the Saint Devil Prince stared straight into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as if to call his bluff. “That’s right! As long as you can bring out another high-order Saint Fate, I’ll kill myself!” He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be able to summon another one.

Even young patriarchs of various creeds wouldn’t be able to obtain eight high-order Saint Fates, much less some peasant who came from a crappy little sacred ground no one had ever heard of before.

However, the words had barely left his lips when another beam of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body to reveal the eighth high-order Saint Fate. Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong showed them the thing they were all waiting for.

“Eight… Eight strands of high-order Saint Fates!”

Aunt Qing gasped in surprise.

When Yi Xiaotang saw the eighth Saint Fate appear from Huang Xiaolong’s body, a strange look flashed through her eyes.

She stared at Huang Xiaolong as her surroundings fell completely silent.

“Eight… Eight high-order Saint Fates!”

He was a genius whose presence would overshadow the rest!

There was actually such a genius hiding in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave!

As opposed to everyone who was reeling from shock, the blood drained from the Saint Devil Prince’s face. His body started to sway, and it seemed as though all the energy was sucked out of him.

“Kill yourself.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in his mind.

Unable to resign himself to his fate, Xu Jian stared at the eighth high-order Saint Fate that appeared.

Every single strand seemed to be mocking him as it was of better quality than his!

Huang Xiaolong sneered when he noticed the expression on Xu Jian’s face.

However, the situation changed before anyone had the time to react. Xu Jian leaped in the skies and slashed his sword down towards Huang Xiaolong once again.

“Die! DIE!!!”

“So what if you’re someone with eight high-order Saint Fates?! You’re just a True Saint! You’re nothing more than an ant to me!”

“F*CK YOU!”

Killing intent surged out of his body as his roar filled the skies.

A terrifying ray of sword light shot towards Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Snickering to himself, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Immemorial Sword and slashed upwards. With unstoppable momentum, the Immemorial Sword emitted copious amounts of immemorial grand dao energy that seemed to move the immortal cave itself.

The Immemorial Sword light shattered the Saint Devil sword qi easily and shot towards the Saint Devil Prince with no resistance at all. A miserable shriek left Xu Jian’s lips as he was sent flying.

By the time he landed, a shockingly large wound was left on his chest.

He couldn’t stop the blood from gushing out of his body as the Saint Devil Prince stared at his bloodstained hands in disbelief.

He was injured by a True Saint!

Very quickly, his expression changed when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Yi Xiaotang and the others were equally as shocked.

By the time the battle was over, the experts who were in the immortal cave had arrived, and they saw Xu Jian’s sorry figure on the ground below.

When Tang Jia looked at the sword in Huang Xiaolong’s hand and the eight high-grade Saint Fates hovering in the air above him, his throat went dry.

“Eight… Eight high-order Saint Fates…”

With Zhu Yu’s help, the Saint Devil Prince finally got to his feet, and he glared at Huang Xiaolong with rage spewing out from his eyes. “That’s the Immemorial Sword!” A burning gaze soon replaced his angry expression. “Cosmos Artifact! It’s the artifact controlling the Immemorial Grand Formation!”

He was no stranger to the immemorial grand dao energy. When Huang Xiaolong used it in combination with the sword, he gave everything away.

Xu Jian turned to the experts who had gathered around and yelled, “Kill him! The sword he’s holding is the Immemorial Sword! It’s the Cosmos Artifact refined by the Immemorial Dao Venerable himself and one will be able to control the Immemorial Grand Formation after you get your hands on it!”

“If you kill him, we’ll split the treasure amongst each other equally!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

One had to say that the Saint Devil Prince’s terms moved a lot of experts. Everyone stared at the Immemorial Sword greedily.

However, no one dared to make the first move.

All of them were no idiots. The Saint Devil Prince could be said to be one of the strongest people in the Immortal Cave right now. If someone like him was sent flying with a single strike, they could easily guess their end if Huang Xiaolong decided to move against them. After all, not even someone strong enough to fight First Esteem Dao Venerables could block Huang Xiaolong’s strike.

“There’s no need to be afraid!” The Saint Devil Prince tried to reassure them. “He was merely using the power of the Immemorial Grand Formation earlier! I was injured as I wasn’t ready to take on his attack! He’s just a True Saint and won’t be able to use the formation for long! With my reputation at stake, I promise you that anyone who gets the sword will be able to obtain a grand dao treasure from the treasury!”

A patriarch of a sacred land appeared behind Huang Xiaolong as soon as the words left Xu Jian’s lips. A malevolent smile could be seen on his face as he roared with laughter. “Huang Xiaolong, what rights do you have as a True Saint to hold the Immemorial Sword?! Hand it over right now!”

The person who had appeared wasn’t someone from the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. Instead, he was the patriarch of Nirvana Sacred Land from the Midnight Heavenly Cave, a region close to Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. As the patriarch of one of the strongest factions in Midnight Heavenly Cave, he was at the peak of the late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. He might not be the Saint Devil Prince’s opponent, but he was close.

The moment he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong, the members of the various factions commenced their attacks. All of them were afraid that the treasure would land in someone else’s hands.

A chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he saw everyone charging at him. Boundless killing intent rushed out from his body as he no longer decided to show mercy.

Waving the Immemorial Sword, Huang Xiaolong stabbed backwards and sliced through the body of the Primal Ancestor behind him. It was like cutting through tofu as his body was cut in half without any resistance.

Those who were leading the charge couldn’t help but stop in their tracks.

With a sneer on his face, Huang Xiaolong turned around to cut the brains of the Nirvana Sacred Land’s patriarch open. Starting his assault, Huang Xiaolong charged at the person closest to him.

With a wave of his arm, he severed the Primal Ancestor’s upper body from his lower body.

Even though everyone who dared to attack him was a high-level Primal Ancestor, none of them could endure a single chop from Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s body started flickering through the crowd upon soaring into the skies. Every time a sword light flashed, several experts fell.
