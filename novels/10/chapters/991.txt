Huang Xiaolong stood up and hurried to the entrance, but when he reached the doors, Lin Chaoqun’s figure had disappeared amongst the crowd on the busy street. His eyes searched for a while, but there was no sign of Lin Chaoqun, he could only give up and return to his table.

However, when he reached his table, he saw that the waiter had just cleaned away his dishes. Standing beside his table were none other than that Zhu Wanchen and his two slaves.

Huang Xiaolong’s hand extended, blocking the waiter and asking, “What are you doing? I haven’t asked for the bill yet.”

The waiter looked at Huang Xiaolong with a difficult expression, “This young master, you see… You have eaten more or less, and there are no other empty tables around. Young master Zhu Wanchen was looking for a table, so…”

How could Huang Xiaolong not understand what the waiter implied?

Just now, the waiter saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn't at his table, and there were no other seats available, therefore he decided to clean up Huang Xiaolong’s table and give it to Zhu Wanchen.

“Eaten more or less?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. Looking at his untouched dishes and back at the waiter, “Don’t tell me you’re actually blind, I haven’t touched any of it.”

The truth was, Huang Xiaolong merely took two sips of his wine and hadn't taken a single bite of the food he ordered. The waiter most likely received some benefits from Zhu Wanchen. At the same time, pressured by Zhu Wanchen’s identity, the waiter acted this way.

The waiter’s expression turned ugly at Huang Xiaolong’s words, but he was only a lowly waiter, he really didn't have the guts to forcefully throw Huang Xiaolong out of the restaurant. He couldn’t help looking helplessly at Zhu Wanchen.

One of the old slaves standing behind Zhu Wanchen walked over to Huang Xiaolong at this point, saying, “How about this, your bill is on us. On top of that, we will give you one shenbi, it should be enough for you to go to another restaurant and eat several tables’ worth of a meal!” He placed one shenbi onto the table.

One shenbi!

This was literally trying to send Huang Xiaolong off like a beggar seeing that he was dressed like a commoner. Then again, one shenbi was a windfall to a commoner.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, taking out three shenbi and flipping them onto the table, “I’ll give you three shenbi, you two and your Young master can have one each. Now scram, don’t block the air here, you’re ruining my drinking mood.”

The two old slaves were instantly enraged, their faces turned purple.

Just as they wanted to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson, Zhu Wanchen stopped them, shaking his head at them, “Forget it, it’s just a table. Let’s find another restaurant.”

In Zhu Wanchen’s eyes, him, as the illustrious Zhu Family Young master, fighting over a mere table in public with some backwater family’s disciple was an insult to his status.

However, before leaving, he left some words for Huang Xiaolong, “It is very rare that someone has the guts to defy me. I am very curious, where does your confidence to offend me come from?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t answer. In fact, he was too lazy to spare these people another glance. He returned to his seat and sipped on his wine leisurely.

A sharp light glinted at the bottom of Zhu Wanchen’s eyes.

“Let’s go.” He said to the two old slaves and left the restaurant. Clearly, he had jotted down Huang Xiaolong’s offense.

The waiter looked sympathetically at Huang Xiaolong, shaking his head as he left.

This brat actually dared to offend Zhu Wanchen? He really didn't know how to write the word for death.

Although the Zhu Family’s power couldn't be compared to the three top sects, it was still a power in the top ten of the Green Cloud Island. There really weren't many people who would choose to offend Zhu Wanchen. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The other customers also sneaked a glance at Huang Xiaolong from time to time, whispering in low voices amongst themselves then shaking their heads. Obviously, they reached the same conclusion as the waiter earlier.

Huang Xiaolong had never been bothered by others’ opinion, he was just sitting there and sipping on his wine.

After filling his stomach, Huang Xiaolong left the restaurant and found an inn to rest for the night.

When he stepped out from the restaurant, in another restaurant not far away, a Zhu Family slave ran to report to Zhu Wanchen. “Young master, that brat has left the restaurant, should we make our move now?”

Zhu Wanchen shook his head instead, as if he was unconcerned, “He’s just a small fry, it doesn’t call for you lot to do it personally, finding someone to teach him a lesson is enough. There’s no need to kill him, let him live.”

The two slaves immediately understood Zhu Wanchen’s meaning, let the brat live knowing he was better off dead.

“Yes, Young master.” The two slaves complied.

“I wonder if there are any other geniuses with top rank ten godhead taking the disciple recruitment exam this time.” Zhu Wanchen casually mentioned.

One of the slaves beamed ingratiatingly, “Top rank ten godhead? Were they to flip the entire Green Cloud Island over, they still wouldn't find another one. This time, among those waiting to take the disciple recruitment exam, Young master should be the only one with a rank ten or above godhead.”

“With Young master’s talent, you will certainly catch the Barbarian God Sect Chief’s eye and be received as a personal disciple, and when the next All Islands Great War arrives, Young master will definitely obtain one of the participant seats. This old slave has no doubts that Young master’s performance during the All Islands Great War will enter the Fortune Gate Elders’ eyes, they will be fighting to accept you as their personal disciple!”

Zhu Wanchen nodded with a faint smile on his face.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was inside his room, refining the godheads of Tie Chengdong’s group.

Tie Chengdong’s godhead was of the fire element, while amongst the other five, there were earth, water, and wood element godheads. Godforce of different elements was floating out from those five godheads, entering Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The night quickly passed.

Huang Xiaolong ended his cultivation when sunlight shone into his room.

Despite being only one night of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong felt a clear difference, bringing him closer to peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm. At this rate, in half a month, he would be able to reach that target.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his room, lightly stretching himself before leaving the inn, heading to the Barbarian God Sect.

Several hours later, he had left Pingyi City behind him. When he passing through the trees, the path in front of him was suddenly blocked by three people.

“Did that Zhu Wanchen send you guys?” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over the three people, his tone mild. Huang Xiaolong had noticed from the beginning there were people following him, but, it was inconvenient for him to act inside the city, therefore he had allowed them to follow.

One of them chuckled evilly, “Looks like you aren't that stupid. Kid, don’t blame us, we’re only following orders, you can only blame yourself for not knowing how to judge people, offended Young master Zhu Wanchen. But don’t you worry, Young master Zhu Wanchen gave the words to spare your dog life!”

“Hehe, he said that crippling you is enough.” Another one chimed in.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, wearing a faint smile on his face, “You guys can’t blame me either. If you really had to blame someone, you can only blame your Young master.” With that said, an attractive force dragged the three people in front of him. Following this, purple characters spun in his pupils and entered the three people’s foreheads as he began the soul-scouring. Moments later, when things concluded, Huang Xiaolong pointed at them, using an Absolute Soul Finger to pierce through all three men’s foreheads at the same time.

Subsequently, his palm mimicked a blade and waved in front of him.

Three heads fell, rolling on the ground, dead with their eyes wide opened. Disbelief and fear was frozen on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong snorted, that Zhu Wanchen was really putting him on a high pedestal, sending three First Order Heavenly Gods to kill him. He didn’t even bother with taking their godheads, flicking out a ball of divine fire, letting it burn the three corpses completely.

From the three people’s memories, Huang Xiaolong came to know that Zhu Wanchen was also heading to the Barbarian God Sect for the disciple recruitment exam.
