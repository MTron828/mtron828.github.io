Chapter 3445: You’re So Sure of My Strength?

A burst of joy filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart when he saw the flying ship.

He started moving towards it, but before he could get close, a group of guards left the ship to stop him. “Hold it right there. Explain your purpose for approaching us!”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the guards.

All of them weren’t weak, and some of them were at the peak of the late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. The strongest of them all had already started to comprehend the elements.

If they were back in the Huang Long World, experts at their level would be considered top-tier experts! For those who could comprehend the elements, they would stand at the apex of the power chain there!

Huang Xiaolong looked at them and said calmly, “I’m here to ask you a few questions.”

Just as the guard was about to chase Huang Xiaolong away, a voice echoed through the skies. “Do not disrespect him!”

A figure soon emerged from the flying ship.

Two giant figures followed closely behind, and it was clear that they were her guards. One of them was an expert who reached the large completion stage in the power of the absolute flame.

“Young Lady!” The guard who approached Huang Xiaolong bowed respectfully when he saw her.

After emerging from her flying ship, the young lady smiled at Huang Xiaolong and said, “If you’re alright with it, please take a break on my ship.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t refuse her goodwill as he boarded the ship in a single step.

“Please.” The young lady was polite as she invited him into the main hall of the ship.

The main hall was extremely well decorated, but every single material used was at the grand dao level. Those were extremely rare in ordinary holy worlds, but they were nothing to someone at Huang Xiaolong’s level.

After entering the main hall, Huang Xiaolong was incited to take a seat. “I am Li Wei of the Myriad Stars Palace. I wonder what questions you have.”

“Which great world is your faction a part of?” Huang Xiaolong got straight to the point.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Great world?

Li Wei and the guards behind her looked at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“My Myriad Stars Palace is a creed in the Black Flame Holy World of the Shi Li World.” She might have found it weird, but she replied nonetheless.

“Young Lady!” One of the guards tried to interrupt her.

“It’s alright. He has no ill intentions.” She knew what they were concerned about.

“Shi Li World?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

There were more than thirty great worlds in addition to the Blazing Dragon World, but none of them was called the Shi Li World. Could he have left the universe he was familiar with?

Was Xuan Hai a God of Creation from this universe?!

Li Wei noticed the confused expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and she asked, “Do you not know about the Shi Li World?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “That’s right. I came from somewhere extremely far away and I’m not familiar with the area.”

Li Wei and her guards stared at him in shock.

“So that’s the case…” Li Wei nodded in acknowledgment.

It was the guards behind her who became a little suspicious. It was clear that they didn’t believe him at all! Indeed, Huang Xiaolong’s story was a little too far-fetched.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked Li Wei other questions. He asked about the number of great worlds in the universe, the number of Gods of Creation, and the number of holy worlds in the Shi Li World.

She didn’t know much as the God of Creation Realm was too far for her at the moment.

As for the number of holy worlds in the Shi Li World, she had no idea how to answer his question either. The only thing she could recall was her father saying that there were more than fifty great worlds in the universe.

Fifty great worlds?

Light sparkled in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. It seemed as though the number of God of Creation Realm experts were more than he thought.

“Sir… Li Wei has something to ask of you.” After chatting with Huang Xiaolong for more than an hour, she couldn’t help but change the topic.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

“I know that it might be a little too sudden, but this is too important to me,” Li Wei said with an embarrassed expression hanging on her face.

“It’s alright. Please, speak your mind,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“The reason we left the Shi Li World was to look for a type of spiritual herb called the Dragon Heart Grass. It’s located in the Dragon Cave, and it’s up ahead,” Li Wei explained. “My father was seriously injured, and he needs the Dragon Heart Grass in order to recover. However, there’s a group of dragonian beasts living in the cave. It’s extremely dangerous, and we’re not confident of grabbing the herb.”

Huang Xiaolong understood what she was asking of him immediately.

“Are you so confident that I’ll be able to deal with them?” An amused look appeared on his face.

Li Wei’s beauty might not be enough to topple a city, but she was a pretty lass nonetheless. There was a different vibe about her.

Li Wei’s face started to heat up after noticing Huang Xiaolong’s gaze on her, and she squeaked, “I might not know of your origins, but I believe that you’re definitely an expert. Even if everyone on my ship joined forces, they wouldn’t be your match.”

She was right.

The guards behind her stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, and it was clear that they doubted her words.

Huang Xiaolong fell silent for some time, and Li Wei started to panic the longer the silence lasted.

“Alright.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

He had no idea how to return to the universe he knew, and he had no choice but to remain there for some time.

After hearing his agreement, Li Wei jumped in joy. “Many thanks to fellow cultivator! Please rest assured that we will give you a million dao coins as compensation regardless of the success of our mission.”

A million dao coins was a massive fortune to most creeds!

The corners of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curled upwards. One had to know that in order to buy a batch of Flower of Time back in the Blazing Dragon World, he used billions of dao coins.

“Since we’re fated to meet, there’s no need for the formalities.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and refused to accept her payment.

Soon, he asked some questions about the Dragon Cave.

When he learned that the Dragon Cave was a tiny natural world, he was shocked.

Li Wei’s flying ship was quick, and it took three days for them to arrive. After chatting with Li Wei for three days, Huang Xiaolong gained a basic understanding of the new universe.

“Sir, that’s the Dragon Cave.” Li Wei pointed at a giant hole in space as a serious expression formed on her face.

The Dragon Cave was considered a forbidden region, and if not for the fact that she needed the Dragon Heart Grass, she would never venture to a location like that.

“Alright, let’s head in.” A relaxed expression could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he declared.

Li Wei nodded slightly and she got her men to activate a formation on the flying ship before charging into the Dragon Cave.

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he saw the anxious expression on her face. He could feel that there were several strong auras in the Dragon Cave, but they were merely ants in front of him. As long as he willed it, he could wipe them all out with a swing of his arm.

Not too long after they entered, they were attacked by a group of dragonian beasts. The guards protecting the ship managed to hold them off and the group managed to continue their journey.

Initially, Li Wei’s group was able to stop the dragonian beasts as they weren’t too strong. The deeper they got, the stronger the beasts became.
