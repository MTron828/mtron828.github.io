“Master, if the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor really leads an army to attack our Devil Scorpion Tribe, we must make preparations in advance.” After leaving the Green Flame Mountain Range, aboard the Netherking Flying Ship, Demon King Fan Hui said with a serious expression.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement. At the end of the day, the Massacring Gods Gate was the second ranked super force of Asura World, and in recent years, their momentum had eclipsed the Netherworld King’s Organisation, so the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor was definitely not simple.

“How strong is he compared to you four?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Asura King Jin Yuan replied solemnly, “We haven’t fought him before, but when fighting one-on-one with him, none of us will be a match against him.”

Huang Xiaolong was slightly shocked, “He is so strong?!”

Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Tai Yue, and Wan Yutian were all peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts, more importantly, their strengths were higher than the average peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts. The four of them had reached the pinnacle of their strengths for a long time.

“Very strong.” Tai Yue’s tone was absolutely serious as he went on, “He is someone from the same era as the old master.”

Huang Xiaolong was visibly astonished this time, “A grandmist archdevil?!”

Same era as the Lord of Hell, that could only mean a grandmist archdevil!

“Yes.” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian nodded solemnly and added, “Moreover, the Massacring Gods Gate’s rampant actions in recent years, claiming they would unify Asura World makes us suspect he might have surpassed...!”

“Surpassed the Emperor Realm!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed.

If that so-called Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor’s cultivation really did surpass Emperor Realm, that would really be troublesome.

“This is only our conjecture. Surpassing the Emperor Real is harder than ascending the heavens. Although the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor is a grandmist archdevil and he is innately highly talented, it is not so easy for him to break through to that realm. Who knows, maybe he’s like the four of us, stuck at the pinnacle of the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm!” Jin Yuan elaborated.

No doubt, even if the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor’s strength is at the pinnacle of the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, his battle prowess is terrifying.

“Other than the Devil Scorpion Tribe, which other forces are there under the Netherworld King’s Organisation?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked.

“Replying to Master, other than the Devil Scorpion Tribe in Asura World, there is the Cataclysm Cult, Thunder Demon Gates, as well as the Misty Clouds Sect.” Tai Yue answered respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong was quite surprised.

The Cataclysm Cult, Thunder Demon Gates, and the Misty Clouds Sect were all Asura World’s top one hundred forces. It was unexpected for him to find out that they were the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s vassals.

Moreover, the Cataclysm Cult ranked in the top twenty of the Asura World’s super forces.

“What about in the Spirits World and Ghost World?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Jin Yuan respectfully replied, “In the Spirits World there are the Golden Corpse Temple, Clear Heart Sect, and Fumu Faction, whereas in the Ghost World, Heaven Sacrificial City, Blood Sea Cult, and Copper Ghost Cult.”

Huang Xiaolong dazed in shock for a second.

The Golden Corpse Temple, Clear Heart Sect, Fumu Faction,Heaven Sacrificial City, Blood Sea Cult, and Copper Ghost Cult were also forces in the top one hundred. Both the Golden Corpse Temple and Heaven Sacrificial City were forces comparable to the Cataclysm Cult, yet both were forces under the Netherworld King’s Organisation.

The Netherworld King’s Organisation’s influence extending to Hell’s three worlds was scary enough, and adding these ten super forces to the overall power of the Netherworld King’s Organisation was beyond startling.

“These forces, are all of them absolutely loyal to the Netherworld King’s Organisation?” Huang Xiaolong asked solemnly.

“Rest assured, Master. The old master has placed a soul prohibition on these forces’ Old Ancestors and Leaders, so they are absolutely loyal to the Netherworld King’s Organisation. Now that Master has successfully obtained the old master’s inheritance, if they give birth to any improper ideas, Master can make their souls perish with a thought.” Jin Yuan reassured Huang Xiaolong.

Fan Hui hesitated, “But...?”

“But what?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Fan Hui.

“But if any one of them surpasses the Emperor Realm, then, he would be able to break free of the old master’s soul prohibition.” Fan Hui answered, then went on to add, “In recent years, the Spirits World’s Great Commander Lu Kun has been associating closely with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor. The others and I, we are guessing that Lu Kun might have found a way to suppress the soul prohibition in him.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, “You’re trying to say that Lu Kun might have broken through, surpassing the Emperor Realm?

“Not to that extent yet.” Tai Yue shook his head, “Lu Kun is the most talented amongst the ten of us, and in the last few billion years, he has had several fortuitous encounters and has even obtained a grandmist treasure. We suspect that he’s trying to suppress the soul prohibition in him by borrowing the grandmist treasure’s power. On top of that, with the power of the grandmist treasure, he would soon break through! Probably in the next several thousand years.”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by the weight of the information. Who would’ve thought that Lu Kun would have such a great fortuitous adventure.

“What kind of grandmist treasure is it?” Huang Xiaolong asked another question.

“We don’t know.” Fan Hui shook his head. “We have only managed to find out it is a grandmist treasure, but what it is exactly, none of us is clear about that.”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows were scrunched together. Looks like he still has to improve his strength faster. Lu Kun was like a time bomb, it would be hard to deal with him if he really broke through.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong inquired about Lu Kun and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s situation.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank upon hearing that the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s power covered the entire Spirits World, completely suppressing the Netherworld King’s Organisation in the Spirits Worlds. Huang Xiaolong realized that he had underestimated the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s influence in the past.

“You mean the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe is stronger than the Massacring Gods Gate?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Judging from what we know, that seems to be the case,” Tai Yue replied. “Moreover, lately, Lu Kun and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor have been in a lot of contact, and we’ve learned the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s people have snuck into our Netherworld King’s Organisation in the Spirits World. A quarter of the Spirits World’s Netherworld King’s Organisation’s control has fallen into the hands of Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s disciples.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a breath of cold air. The Netherworld King’s Organisation’s situation in the Spirits World was worse than he had imagined.

“After the matters of Asura World are settled, I will make a trip to the Spirits World.” Huang Xiaolong stated decisively.

“Master, this...!” Jin Yuan and the others were shocked.

“Master, if Lu Kun finds out that you’re going to the Spirits World, I’m afraid...” Fan Hui tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong otherwise.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and reassured in return, “It’s alright, I have the City of Eternity and the heart of hell. Even if they find out I’m in the Spirits World and want to kill me, it will not be so easy.” Then his tone changed, “Oh right, any result about the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple Fang Mingyu that I had asked you to check?”

Tai Yue replied as he shook his head, “So far, we’ve only found news of Ren Wokuang. As for that Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple Fang Mingyu, we could not find anything related to him. We think Fang Mingyu might have left Asura World, to enter either the Spirits World or Ghost World instead.”

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in contemplation then ordered, “Contact the Spirits World and Ghost World’s side, have them check this matter.”

All four respectfully complied.

“Another thing, send people to investigate if there are any of the Void Devil Beast Clan’s disciples still around the Asura World. If there are, protect them to your best efforts,” Huang Xiaolong thought of another matter and exhorted the four.

Xu Baisheng’s Void Devil Beast Clan originally came from the Asura World.

“Master, please rest assured.”
