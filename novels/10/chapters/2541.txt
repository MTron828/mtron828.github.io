Chapter 2542: No One Can Stop Huang Xiaolong Anymore

Refining the Cangqiong Blade was smooth and easy for Huang Xiaolong as he had gotten Old Man Cangqiong's inheritance. In a short period of merely a little over a month, he obtained the preliminary grasp of the Cangqiong Blade's power.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong's inextinguishable dao heart played a big part in speeding up the refinement process. Otherwise, it might have taken Huang Xiaolong ten, twenty, or maybe even more years for him to grasp the preliminary powers of the Cangqiong Blade.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t spend much effort to refine the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring, mainly because Li Chen was already dead. The soul imprint Li Chen had left in the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring had scattered, hence Huang Xiaolong didn’t come across much resistance when he took ownership.

As for the Devil Palace’s Fiend Moon Blade, the Devil Palace Master Qiao Jinyang’s soul imprint was still on it, as well as the inextinguishable grand dao of Qiao Jinyang’s comprehension, thus it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to refine the Fiend Moon Blade at his current strength.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had his own inextinguishable dao heart, there was no hope of erasing Qiao Jinyang’s markings on the Fiend Moon Blade on his own unless his cultivation reached the Primal Ancestor Realm.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong completely gave up on refining the Fiend Moon Blade after a day's struggle. He was unable to refine the Fiend Moon Blade, but he could ask for help from his Fourth Master after going out.

After refining the Cangqiong Blade and Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring, Huang Xiaolong exited the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

Huang Xiaolong saw Old Man Cangqiong the moment he came out. Old Man Cangqiong smiled knowingly at him, caressing the pitifully sparse goatee on his chin as he nodded his head in appreciation.

Other than Old Man Cangqiong, the Clear Snow Palace’s three beauties and Palace Master Xue Lingyun, his Fourth Master, Tyrant Chu, and a group of Holy Heavens’ disciples and experts were also present.

Of course, the Devil Palace’s three Palace Masters with a large group of Devil Palace’s experts exuded hostility so strong that they could hardly be ignored.

Apart from these top powerhouses, there were many other forces as well.

Cao Nan’s eyes never left Huang Xiaolong since the moment he appeared, and the look in his eyes made others break out in cold sweat, yet Huang Xiaolong treated it as nonexistent.

“Disciple greets Master,” Huang Xiaolong stepped forward, standing properly in front of Old Man Cangqiong before he saluted respectfully.

“Good, good!”Old Man Cangqiong nodded with a beaming face, as he moved forward and slightly raised Huang Xiaolong from his bow.

Tyrant Chu approached them smilingly, and Huang Xiaolong greeted respectfully, “Fourth Master.”

“Way to go, kiddo. You didn’t disappoint us!” Tyrant Chu laughed heartily, “As expected as my disciple!”

Holy Heavens’ disciples and experts congratulated Huang Xiaolong with Wu Ge in the lead.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at them, and smiled as he thanked them.

Cao Nan and the Devil Palace’s experts approached from the distance, and Cao Nan’s gaze was as cold as his voice. “Huang Xiaolong, did you kill my disciple Xie Bufan?”

“That’s correct,” Huang Xiaolong admitted frankly. In truth, he didn’t plan to deny or conceal the matter at all. Moreover, it was an open secret at this point. Naturally, Huang Xiaolong was not afraid that other people would suspect that he had a dao heart, because he had the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear with the Heavenly Master’s grand dao imprinted on it. This weapon was more than sufficient to kill Xie Bufan and Li Chen without raising any suspicion.

“Very good!” Cao Nan sneered coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, we really underestimated you!” He then opened his palm towards Huang Xiaolong, demanding, “Where is the Fiend Moon Blade? Hurry up and return it to us!”

Huang Xiaolong responded tepidly, “The Fiend Moon Blade is in my hand. However, if you want it back, it’ll cost you ten thousand holy pills!”

“WHAT?!!!” Cao Nan and the Devil Palace’s experts yelled in anger.

Tyrant Chu hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to come up with such a hand that he broke into laughter. Good kiddo, Huang Xiaolong had dared to think of something he didn't… ten thousand holy pills! That was a mind-blowing condition!

Probably, you won’t be able to find so many holy pills even if you combed through every inch of the Holy World with a fine-tooth comb.

“YOU—!” Overwhelming killing intent roiled in Cao Nan’s eyes, as he wished nothing more than to tear Huang Xiaolong into pieces with his bare hands.

But with Tyrant Chu present, Old Man Cangqiong, and the rest, he couldn’t touch a hair on Huang Xiaolong, much less tear him into pieces.

“Fourth Master, what do you think?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked Tyrant Chu.

Tyrant Chu was dumbfounded for a split second, but then, he laughed and replied in a domineering tone, “That’s it, ten thousand holy pills, and it’s non-negotiable!”

Smoke was rising from Cao Nan’s head from fury as he glared at Tyrant Chu. “Tyrant Chu, I’ll tell you. Don’t dream! You won’t get even one holy pill! Don’t think the Fiend Moon Blade is yours because it’s in your hands!”

As long as the Fiend Moon Blade was not refined by Tyrant Chu, or any of the four Primal Ancestors, it still belonged to the Devil Palace. The Devil Palace Master Qian Jinyang would have an opportunity to take it back in the future.

Tyrant Chu chuckled when he heard that and didn’t bother to waste time bickering with Cao Nan anymore. He turned to Old Man Cangqiong and Xue Lingyun. “Daoist Cangqiong, Daoist Xue Lingyun, we’re one family from hereafter. We should meet more often in the future.”

Old Man Cangqiong smiled amiably and responded, “Naturally.”

Xue Lingyun squeezed an awkward smile as she gave Tyrant Chu a slight roll of her eyes. What does he mean by ‘we should meet more often in the future?’ The choice of words made her speechless.

“Daoist Cangqiong, I have prepared a feast, shall we head over now? Drink a few cups?” Tyrant Chu went on.

Old Man Cangqiong nodded, accepting Tyrant Chu’s invitation.

Subsequently, Tyrant Chu, Huang Xiaolong, Old Man Cangqiong, Holy Heavens’ experts, and Clear Snow Palace’s experts entered the Cangqiong Dao Palace. When Tyrant Chu passed by Cao Nan, he said, “Daoist Cao Nan, why don’t you join us?”

Cao Nan’s cold glare could almost pierce a hole through Tyrant Chu and Huang Xiaolong’s back, as his face looked frighteningly gloomy.

Soon, the news that Huang Xiaolong had obtained Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance reached the four corners of the Holy World.

The news shook the Holy Lands Alliance from top to bottom. It shook the Holy Race, Ghost Talisman Holy Ground, and the Vajra Race!

The other holy grounds and ancient races had similar reactions.

In a short time, Huang Xiaolong’s reputation rose to a new height.

He was already famous from the stage battles at the Mirage Pavilion. Not to mention his performance through the Trial of Blood, entering the top five and revealing his holy soul. It had further astounded the Holy World to the core.

And now, Huang Xiaolong had killed Li Chen and Xie Bufan, and triumphantly obtained Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance, becoming his successor. He had become Old Man Cangqiong’s one and only personal disciple! Thus, this information left the Holy World reeling.

Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong! Huang Xiaolong!

Everyone everywhere was talking about Huang Xiaolong.

At the Holy Lands Alliance headquarters, when Mo Cangli heard the news, he fell into a long pensieve silence. A long time later, he raised his head and sighed heavily, “In the future, no one will be able to stop Huang Xiaolong’s path anymore!”

Huai Po’s voice was heavy with sour jealousy as he complained, “Huang Xiaolong got lucky that Lord Long gave him the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear, and the Heavenly Master added his inextinguishable grand dao to it. Without these, how could he have possibly defeated Xie Bufan and Li Chen? Not to mention that he might have had more than one dao artifact in his hand.”

He was extremely jealous that Huang Xiaolong obtained Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance and became Old Man Cangqiong’s successor, and he was more than a little upset.

He and Huang Xiaolong had never seen eye to eye from the start.

Mo Cangli looked at his disciple. As Huai Po’s master, how could he not know Huai Po’s thoughts?

“Later on, you must not have any thoughts of deliberately provoking Huang Xiaolong,” Mo Cangli warned him sternly.

Huai Po was stunned but nodded and answered, “Yes, Master.”

Inwardly, Huai Po didn’t really take his Master’s warning to heart, insisting that Huang Xiaolong had merely got lady luck shining down on him.

Five years went by in the blink of an eye.

In these five years, Huang Xiaolong had been staying at the Cangqiong Holy Mountain, listening to Old Man Cangqiong preach his way of dao. During this time, the Devil Palace’s Qiao Jinyang had personally come to visit, and of course, his aim was to get the Fiend Moon Blade back. In the end, enduring the pain of his bleeding heart, Qiao Jinyang emptied out half of the Devil Palace’s treasury to exchange and take back the Fiend Moon Blade.
