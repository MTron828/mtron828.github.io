Chapter 2418: All Extinguishing Holy Ground

“Your Highness!”

Chen Zhi and the others fell to their knees the moment they arrived before Huang Xiaolong. A look of reverence and shock was stuck to their faces.

Previously, they had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was. However, after their trip into the Holy Heavens City, they had finally learned of his true status. Their master was the one and only disciple of all four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens organization, and the future of the Holy World!

It was no wonder he had two saint godheads!

It also explained Huang Xiaolong’s indifference when he had killed Yu Fujiang.

The way they addressed him, had immediately changed after learning of his identity.

“Rise.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Huang Xiaolong explained the reason behind his journey to the Purple Clouds Sea, and he ordered for all of them to get ready.

“Oh right. I have to look for a place to cross the second tribulation before we head there. Do you know of a secluded spot in the area?”

The Departing Sword Sage thought about it for a moment and replied, “Your Highness, there isn’t a secret region nearby suitable for a breakthrough. However, we can head a little further. The All Extinguishing Holy Ground should be nearby. The All Extinguishing Holy Emperor created the All Extinguishing Holy Ground billions of years ago, but he offended the Holy Lands Alliance and caused the entire holy ground to be wiped out. Right now, it should be an abandoned area, and it’s extremely suitable to serve as Your Highness’ cultivation grounds.”

“All Extinguishing Holy Ground?” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Yes. The reason behind their annihilation was because of a Primal Ancestor dao artifact.” Yu Ming continued the explanation, “Actually, there were tons of ancient races who made their move against the All Extinguishing Holy Ground. Even monstrous presences like the Devil Palace made a move. In the war, the All Extinguishing Holy Ground was smashed into rubble. The aftershocks of the battle even radiated to several holy grounds around them. In the battle more than a dozen True Saints were killed. As for those, whose bodies were destroyed, numbered no less than a thousand.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

More than a dozen True Saints fell in a battle!

One could only imagine the destructive might of the battle.

“The All Extinguishing Holy Emperor had terrifying talent. His godhead ranked in the tens and he rose abruptly in the Holy World. Under his lead, the All Extinguishing Holy Ground caught up to superpowers like the Beast Tamer Holy Gate. It’s a pity the All Extinguishing Holy Emperor, Feng Lin, was killed by a Palace Master of the Devil Palace. Qiao Jinyang appeared in the battle and personally killed Feng Lin! If Feng Lin was alive, he might have already transcended the True Saint Realm to become a Primal Ancestor!

The Departing Sword Sage shook his head. “It’s not as simple as it seems. Lin Feng may have chosen to enter the reincarnation river and start from scratch. He’ll definitely rise again and crush those who sought to kill him.”

“What about the dao artifact?” Huang Xiaolong asked. “Who managed to obtain the dao artifact?”

Yu Ming shook his head. “I have no idea. It’s said that the Holy Lands Alliance managed to obtain the treasure. However, there are also some that say that Qiao Jinyang managed to get his hands on it. There are also rumors that no one managed to grab the dao artifact in the end. Of course, there are also legends of the dao artifact entering some sort of secret space during the battle. From what they say, one will only be able to obtain the treasure by finding the All Extinguishing Holy Symbol.”

“Lin Feng might not even have obtained any sort of dao artifact to begin with. During the battle, he didn’t bring it out when his life was threatened. If he had used it, Qiao Jinyang couldn’t have killed him so easily.” The Departing Sword Sage analyzed. “Of course, it’s also possible that Lin Feng couldn’t refine the weapon.”

Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of excitement in his heart, and he asked them about several other things pertaining to Lin Feng.

Ten days later, Huang Xiaolong stopped the Winged Dragon Flying Ship above the All Extinguishing Holy Ground.

Looking out at the lands below them, Huang Xiaolong saw a land ravaged by battle. Everything was destroyed and massive craters lined the continent below him. He could see that the craters were created by someone with terrifyingly strong battling abilities. He could even see several craters that pierced through the entire continent.

The All Extinguishing Holy Ground was extremely sturdy after the All Extinguishing Holy Emperor’s reinforcement. Those who could punch a hole through it had to be Primal Ancestors.

“What terrifying death, blade, and sword qi!” Chen Zhi yelled.

“In the battle that took place, more than a dozen True Saints fell. The casualties under the True Saint realm cannot be counted. Basically all the experts living in the All Extinguishing Holy Ground were killed!” The Departing Sword Sage said, “The number of people who managed to escape can probably be counted on both hands.... It’s no wonder the death qi here is so strong!”

There were several dozen continents in the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground, and one could only imagine the number of dynasties and kingdoms they housed. As for the All Extinguishing Holy Ground, it was god-knew how many times larger than the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground! The number of God Kings, Heavenly Monarchs, Emperors, Venerables, and half-True Saints were uncountable!

“The blade and sword qi around should be left behind by Primal Ancestors. Even if they hadn’t entered the Primal Ancestor Realm, they should be close,” Yu Ming continued, “This is also the reason no one is willing to enter the All Extinguishing Holy Ground. The sword qi and blade qi in the air isn’t something half-True Saints can defend against.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly as he steered the Winged Dragon Flying Ship deeper into the All Extinguishing Holy Ground.

As he crossed mountain planes and massive rivers, he failed to spot a complete structure.

Not a single river was intact and all of them were smashed in various places, branching out to many smaller streams.

There were even giant palm prints left on ancient forests.

The deeper they went, the stronger the offensive qi became. Ringing sounds filled the ship as the sword and blade qi slashed against it.

No matter how they slashed against the ship, they failed to leave a single scratch.

“Your Highness, why don’t you enter seclusion there?” Yu Ming pointed to a mountain valley in the distance.

“No. Let’s head over to the headquarters of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate.”

“What?!” Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage jumped in shock.

The Departing Sword Sage quickly tried to dissuade Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, the headquarters is said to be filled with several supreme-level undead spirits. All of them were formed when the anger and resentment of the dead True Saints merged with the origin energy in the surroundings. They are nigh unkillable, and we will be in deep trouble if we run into them!”

“Undead spirits?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Initially, he had planned to explore the headquarters of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate. With his three holy souls, he felt that it was possible for him to obtain the All Extinguishing Holy Symbol.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll break through to the Second Tribulation half-True Saint Realm here.” Huang Xiaolong looked at the valley Yu Ming had pointed out.

He planned to cross the second tribulation before heading over to the headquarters.

No matter what happened, he had the Winged Dragon Flying Ship and the Darkness Holy Ring. He wouldn’t alarm the undead spirits even if he approached.

Huang Xiaolong and the others quickly arrived in the valley. Choosing a spot deep underground, they laid down countless holy dao restrictions. Huang Xiaolong finally felt at ease and retrieved his Winged Dragon Flying Ship. In the next instant, he threw the Clear Jade Great Rebirth Holy Pill into his mouth.

The moment it entered, dense clouds filled the skies, and the second tribulation quickly gathered.
