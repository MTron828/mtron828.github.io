Chapter 3691: Release

However, they felt that something was wrong when they examined the Dragon Overlord closely. It seemed as though he was really hurt!

How could anyone injure an expert at the Dragon Overlord’s level?!

Huang Sheng and the others saw the look in the Dragon Overlord’s eyes, and they slowly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Could it be?!

“It’s you!” the Dragon Overlord roared when he saw Huang Sheng and Meng Tian. “You’re from the Thirteen Universes!”

Initially, Huang Sheng and Meng Tian had told him about Huang Xiaolong when they joined him.

Soon after, they disappeared, and he guessed that it had something to do with Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I’ll tell you now, Zhu Chen has already submitted to me.”

“What?!”

“Lord Zhu Chen chose to serve Huang Xiaolong?!”

Wei Zheng and the others gasped in shock as they turned to look at Zhu Chen.

“That’s right! I am Lord Huang’s subordinate!” Zhu Chen nodded.

!!

Lord Zhu Chen actually chose to serve the kid!

Everyone found it hard to believe, but he already admitted the matter.

Zhu Chen was one of the pillars of the Unknown Space. However, he chose to serve someone from the Thirteen Universes!

“Zhu Chen, how dare you betray Lord Devil?!” Wei Zheng roared with rage.

Even though Zhu Chen, the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and the Green Ghost stood alongside the Ferocious Devil as the five supreme overlords of the Unknown Space, everyone knew who was the true ruler of the Unknown Space.

The Ferocious Devil was the one who called the shots!

Zhu Chen didn’t fly into a rage. Instead, he muttered, “I didn’t betray Lord Devil. Lord Huang Xiaolong is the same as us. We have the same enemy, and that’s the Universe First Race!”

The Dragon Overlord sneered, “You’re a traitor and that’s that. There’s no need for your excuses. Zhu Chen, now that you submitted to an outsider, you’re an enemy of our Unknown Space!”

“All of you, take them down!” the God of Death roared.

“Kill!”

Every single expert from the Unknown Space charged towards Huang Xiaolong at once.

“You don’t know what’s good for you…” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

The Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared above Huang Xiaolong, and he summoned the four Universe Origin Fires. A sea of flames surrounded the entire group.

“Star Dragon Divine Tree!”

“That’s the four Universe Origin Fires!”

Yells rang through the skies.

The branches of the Star Dragon Divine Tree moved all of a sudden.

Without a single exception, everyone was sent flying.

The origin fires landed on the experts of the Unknown Space when they were flying away.

No matter how hard they tried, they failed to shake off the flames that stuck to them like superglue.

It quickly burned through their armor before landing on their physical bodies.

Miserable shrieks filled the skies.

The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death didn’t dare to challenge the flames directly, and they dodged every single strand of flame flying towards them.

It was too bad the flames weren’t the only thing they had to be aware of. Huang Xiaolong took a single step and appeared before them. The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd that appeared in his hand chopped at them.

The two of them raised their weapons in a desperate attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong.

Without any fanfare, the two of them were sent flying.

They realized that Huang Xiaolong’s strength was basically two times what he displayed earlier! They felt a warm feeling rising from their chest and they spat out a mouthful of blood each.

The Dragon Overlord’s combat abilities might have crossed the 24 billion mark, but he was far from Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy, much less the man’s combat abilities.

There was even less to say for the God of Death.

Huang Xiaolong appeared before them once again and he struck out with both weapons.

Their expressions changed.

The Reversal Sword plunged straight into the God of Death’s chest.

As for the Dragon Overlord, he was a little better off as he was sent smashing into the ground by the Three Gods Halberd. At the very least, he didn’t turn into a human kebab.

When the experts of the Unknown Space thought that Huang Xiaolong was too busy to deal with them, a blood sea charged towards them and the five monster kings moved.

Wei Zheng and the others were sent flying before they could try anything.

Pulling his sword out from the God of Death’s chest, Huang Xiaolong sent him flying into the ground below with a single punch.

…

One day later…

The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death pledged their alliance to Huang Xiaolong.

By the time they did, they were beaten up so badly that their bodies trembled when he approached.

No one managed to escape as Huang Xiaolong caught every single one of them.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Naturally, the Yin Yang Flame Wheels and the Blade of Death went to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of joy rising in his heart when he held the two treasures.

The Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, the Universe Origin Fires, the Three Gods Halberd, The Reversal Sword, Golden Sun Circlet, Yin Yang Flame Wheels, and the Blade of Death belonged to him! Out of the thirteen treasures, he held eight of them!

Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to leave the Netherworld as he started to refine the treasures.

As peace returned to the Netherworld, Yin Qi, who was standing outside the entrance of the Netherworld, stared at the entrance in shock.

“City Lord, should we enter the Netherworld?” Yin Guan asked.

However, Yin Qi shook his head and sighed, “There is no need for that. Now that Lord Dragon Overlord has captured Huang Xiaolong, he should be back in several years.”

Yin Guan wanted to say something, but he eventually swallowed his words.

More than twenty years had passed and Huang Xiaolong finally refined their treasures. They left for the entrance of the Netherworld.

Several years passed…

Huang Xiaolong and the others finally saw the entrance to the Netherworld, and they wasted no time as they charged out from the god-forsaken place.

When Yin Qi and the others saw Huang Xiaolong returning from the Netherworld, they stared in shock.

Huang Xiaolong paused for a second before approaching Yin Qi.
