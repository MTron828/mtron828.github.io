Chapter 3437: Opening the Dao Emperor’s Treasury

A crafty smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he laughed, “Of course I did!”

He found it!

The old dragon roared with laughter and his eyes lit up. “Nice! Little brat, you didn’t let me down!”

He knew the importance of the Pangu Axe when Huang Xiaolong had to face Huang Sheng in the future.

“Little brat, you got lucky!”

He had always been envious of Huang Xiaolong’s luck.

Chuckling in amusement, a tiny little axe appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. The surface of the axe looked a little silvery, but it most definitely was not made of silver. He passed the axe to the old dragon.

Caressing the axe in his hands, the old dragon sighed, “This is a good axe… It’s an amazing weapon…” However, a frown soon formed on his face.

At his level, he could easily notice the problem with the Pangu Axe.

“This axe…” Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, the old dragon frowned.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Pangu fought with a God of Creation in the past, and the weapon spirit was damaged. He left the axe on Earth in order to nurture it with the natural spiritual qi.”

“Now, the axe only has half of its original power!”

The old dragon stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

What the f*ck?

“Who has the ability to damage the weapon spirit?! With Pangu’s strength, he can’t be much weaker than me! Not even Huang Sheng’s Dragon Axe will be able to damage the Pangu Axe.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I only managed to learn of the reason after the weapon spirit awakened. In order to learn of his identity, I will have to wait for the weapon spirit to fully recover. All I know is that the weapon spirit was damaged by a giant hammer.”

“Giant hammer?!” After racking his brains, the old dragon had no idea who used a giant hammer.

After some time, a look of pity appeared on the old dragon’s face. “Such a pity…” The power of the Pangu Axe might be shocking, but it was nothing it used to be!

Moreover, it wouldn’t be easy to restore a weapon like that!

If it was easy to restore the axe, Pangu wouldn’t have left it on earth.

“Do you know where Pangu is?” the old dragon asked.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I have no idea. However, he left the Pangu World not too long after his battle. Not even the weapon spirit knows where he went. From what I think, the other God of Creation should play a crucial part in Pangu’s whereabouts.”

“Do you mean to say that you’ll be able to locate Pangu after you find the God of Creation who battled with him?”

“Yes!” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

If he didn’t learn of the battle, he might not know how to find Pangu. However, Huang Xiaolong knew that he would be able to understand everything once he found the unknown God of Creation.

“I will use the power of the empire to look for him…” the old dragon sighed.

“Master, do you think that the mysterious God of Creation is the Dao Emperor?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

After all, the Dao Emperor has also been missing for quite some time.

A light flashed in the old dragon’s eyes for a moment, but a sigh soon followed. “It can’t be the Dao Emperor. He might be strong, but he won’t be able to fight Pangu. Even without the axe, Pangu wouldn’t lose to him. There’s no way he could damage the Pangu Axe.” Turning to Huang Xiaolong, he continued, “Are you planning to cultivate in the Blazing Dragon World? Or…”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “I’ll head out for a bit.”

Even though the Blazing Dragon World was safe, he wanted to see if he could discover other miracles when exploring the universe.

He might have obtained the Pangu Axe and gained the ability to use the Pangu World Origin, but the spiritual energy contained in the Pangu World was scarce. He pretty much devoured what he could in the years that he was there, and it was also the reason he left.

Moreover, he used all the Pangu Pills he obtained in the Pangu Treasury. If he wished to increase his strength, he would need to look for more treasures.

If he wanted to reach the limit of his third world in seclusion, he would probably need a hundred million years!

He couldn’t afford to take that long.

As such, he planned to scour the universe for more treasures!

“Alright… You have incredible luck, and you might discover something when traveling the universe.” The old dragon nodded happily. “However, you will need to be careful of the True Dragon Celestial Empire.”

“Relax. I know what to do.” Huang Xiaolong reassured the old dragon. “Master, do you know of any other worlds like the World of Departed Souls?”

If he could find another world like it, it would be great. The spiritual qi contained in the world origin of a world that size would be more effective than a hundred million creation-level pills.

Staring at the brat in shock, the old dragon didn’t expect him to ask about things like that. After pausing for a second, he shook his head. “The only world at that level in the explored universe is the World of Departed Souls…”

Huang Xiaolong guessed as much, but a wave of disappointment filled him when he heard what the old dragon said.

“However, there might just be worlds like that in the universe.” The old dragon laughed. “You might be able to find one if you explore the universe.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

After staying for a day in the Blazing Dragon World, Huang Xiaolong left.

He thought about the Shi Xiaofei and the others, and he planned on bringing them along with him.

Even though the Blazing Dragon was there to protect them, he would only feel safe when they entered the World of Departed Souls.

Moreover, they would be able to interact with the members of the Huang Family.

Of course, there were also the ten overlords, Yuan Tianyi, and the subordinates of the overlords.

When he brought them over to the World of Departed Souls, he spent a year with them before leaving.

With nothing else to hold him back, he could cultivate in peace! He wouldn’t have to worry about their safety when roaming the universe!

However, he went to the Dao Emperor World before he started to roam the universe.

When Huang Shengdao obtained the Dao Emperor Sword in the past, he didn’t open the final seal in the Dao Emperor’s Treasury. Now, Huang Xiaolong planned to complete the final step. After all, it was the most important part of the Dao Emperor’s Treasury. No matter what, there should be several creation-level pills in there.
