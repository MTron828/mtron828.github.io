Chapter 2523: Why so Ruthless?

“Your Highness, we…” Before the two True Saints from the Devil Palace could speak, a terrifying wave of sword qi shot towards them.

The Departing Sword Sage, Chen Zhi, Yu Ming, and the others made their move.

Shan Yufeng and Yu Xiongan retreated hastily.

By this time, miserable cries had already filled the air as countless experts from the Devil Palace were killed by the two True Saint Realm profound beasts. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The two True Saints from the Devil Palace stared at each other, and they came to a decision immediately.

“Leave!”

The two of them sped away as soon as they got the chance.

However, the Departing Sword Sage, Chen Zhi, and Yu Ming had long expected them to do so. Hence, they obstructed them in an instant.

With a wave from Di Huai, the experts who had submitted to the Jiang Family, exploded into a mist of blood.

They were like fireworks in the night sky. Blood red bursts filled the air as the stench of blood assaulted everyone.

When Di Huai saw the looks of fear on the faces of those who had submitted to the Jiang Family, he felt no pity. After all, they had conspired with the Devil Palace to kill the disciples of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate. All of them had broken the rules laid down by the Holy Gate in the past, and they deserved to die because of that.

When the True Saints of the Devil Palace were stopped, a sense of irritation rose in their hearts as rage clouded their minds.

“Huang Xiaolong, we didn’t offend you! Why are you hell-bent on killing us?! Why do you have to be so ruthless?!” Shan Yufeng screamed.

Huang Xiaolong snorted coldly, “B*llsh*t. Don’t you know that I was a disciple in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate? Why did you kill the disciples of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate if you already knew that?”

If not for the Devil Palace, the members of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate wouldn’t have died.

Zhan Yufeng sucked in a cold breath.

“That was an order from Lord Dou Rui! We had nothing to do with it! We were merely there to carry out orders!” Yu Xiongan tried to explain himself.

Too lazy to listen to their reasons, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Flying Heavens Blood Stele. With his holy soul, he sent it flying towards Yu Xiongan.

A miserable scream rang through the air, and a giant hole appeared in his body.

Under the terrified gaze of everyone present, Yu Xiongan started to shrivel, and after a short moment, only his bones were left.

After the blood stele had sucked out all the blood essence from Yu Xiongan’s body, the runes swirling on its surface emitted brilliant rays of light.

A golden figure emerged from Yu Xiongan’s shriveled up body, and his holy soul tried to make its escape. Luckily for Huang Xiaolong, he was long prepared for something like that to happen. Before the holy soul could escape, Huang Xiaolong used his holy soul to trap it in the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

With another sweep of his arm, he cleaned out Shan Yufeng and trapped his holy soul into the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

The situation changed before any of the ladies could react.

As they stood there with their mouths agape, they couldn’t believe what they saw.

Of course, they managed to notice Huang Xiaolong’s display of strength despite their shock.

He has a holy soul!

Zeng Yin’s eyes widened, and her eyeballs seemed to pop out from their sockets. Did my junior brother enter the True Saint Realm?! He took a hundred short years to enter the True Saint Realm from the Sovereign Realm!

How is that even possible?!

Wait a minute… The Saint Fate hasn’t even been born yet!

How could Huang Xiaolong enter the True Saint Realm without fighting for the Saint Fate?

The more she thought about it, the harder her head started to ache.

Very quickly, Di Huai and the others killed everyone on the other side.

The scene was extremely similar to the time when the Devil Palace had cleaned out the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

Miserable cries filled the skies,

After they were done, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the Zhuoyuan Treasury was still intact. He retrieved it and grabbed the treasures from the Jiang Family before handing it over to Zeng Yin.

“Are… Are you actually giving them to me?!” Zeng Yin didn’t believe her eyes. The origin spiritual pills that piled up into a tiny hill distorted her vision.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

Even though the multitude of treasures he obtained were precious to others, they were useless to him. After handing them over to her, Huang Xiaolong hoped that Zeng Yin would be able to continue the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate’s legacy.

However, it was evident that the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate was no longer a safe place to be. When he left, he brought the ladies, and the surviving disciples of the old Zhuoyuan Holy Gate away.

Several days later, they arrived at the Yuanchen Holy Grounds.

Since the Yuanchen Holy Gate was a tiny power under the Holy Heavens, Huang Xiaolong felt that it was safe enough to house the remaining members of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate. After leaving behind some words of encouragement, he left them there.

After settling them down, Huang Xiaolong continued on his way to the True Reason Holy Gate.

It was too bad that when Huang Xiaolong arrived at the True Reason Holy Gate, he discovered that Fan Xia had already escaped. After searching through the souls of the upper echelons, Huang Xiaolong discovered that Fan Xia had already escaped to the Unparalleled Holy Grounds in the Holy Lands Alliance.

Of course, the monk might leave, but the temple wouldn’t be able to shift its roots easily. Those who had carried out the massacre in the past weren’t lucky enough to escape. Di Huai didn’t show mercy as he killed them off to vent the anger in his heart.

As for the several True Saints in the True Reason Holy Gate, Huang Xiaolong dealt with them the same way he had dealt with the True Saints of the Devil Palace. He devoured their blood essence with the Flying Heavens Blood Stele before storing their holy souls in the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

After a day of slaughter, Huang Xiaolong left the True Reason Holy Gate with Di Huai.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Di Huai who was still seething with rage because Fan Xia had managed to escape, and said, “Di Huai, Fan Xia wouldn’t be able to hide in the Unparalleled Holy Gate forever. If he really tries to, we’ll go to the Unparalleled Holy Gate after the opening of the Cangqiong Holy Manor. We’ll force them to hand him over!”

A grateful look appeared on Di Huai’s face as he thanked Huang Xiaolong sincerely, “Your Highness… Please receive my sincerest thanks!”

“There’s no need. I’ll get Fu Yunjie, and the others to hand him over.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and a trace of rage flashed through his eyes. Li Chen had already lost the bet, but he had refused to hand Fu Yunjie over to Huang Xiaolong. According to Li Chen, he had no idea where Fu Yunjie had run to.

It was clear that Li Chen was hell bent on going against Huang Xiaolong. He wouldn’t hand over anything Huang Xiaolong wanted!

Huang Xiaolong was extremely clear that Li Chen was adamant about protecting Fu Yunjie because of the humiliation he had suffered.

No longer thinking about it, he continued his journey.

After leaving the True Reason Holy Grounds, Huang Xiaolong decided to head over to the All Extinguishing Holy Grounds once again to enter the Fifth Tribulation Half Saint Realm. He would return to the Holy Heavens after crossing the tribulation.
