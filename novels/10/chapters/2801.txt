Chapter 2802: Fu Daosheng is Too Strong!

As soon as he spoke, Fu Daosheng rose into the skies as his aura started to expand. Horrifying pressure came crashing down on everyone present.

“Too damn strong! It’s no wonder Fu Daosheng is hailed as the number one expert in the Dao Talisman Heavenly Cave! The strength he possesses is several times stronger than the Saint Devil Prince! No… Even if three Saint Devil Princes arrive, they would be crushed by him!” Someone gasped in shock.

Zhou Hong and the others sucked in a cold breath.

As half-step Dao Venerables, they were ready to break through any time into the Dao Venerable Realm. As long as the conditions were right, they would be able to advance to a whole new realm!

They were considered invincible existences under the Dao Venerable Realm, but they realized that someone like Fu Daosheng would be able to crush them easily! With an expert of this level, the Immemorial Grand Formation that was controlled by Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a slightly more troublesome formation to crack!

The moment they shattered the formation, Huang Xiaolong would no longer be able to act as he pleased! He might not even be able to keep the Immemorial Sword in his hands!

Scorching flames covered Fu Daosheng’s body in an instant.

The flames were silver in color and bone-white to the point that they numbed one’s mind. Every strand of flame seemed to form a fire rune, and they contained the power of the grand dao.

“Talisman Flame!”

The Talisman Flame was a special type of fire that possessed horrifying might. It was something that could rival the power of the absolute flame.

Moreover, Fu Daosheng had already made the fire a part of him, using it to increase his own strength.

Reaching out into the space before him, Fu Daosheng gathered a ball of flame in his hands before turning them into two massive blades.

The moment the blades appeared, the space around it started to tremble and everyone felt a piercing pain stabbing them straight through the soul.

Just the energy fluctuations alone were enough to prick the dao souls of everyone present. They wondered if their dao souls would shatter the moment the blade landed on them.

From what they knew, only Dao Venerables had the ability to shatter the dao souls of Primal Ancestors. However, the blades formed from the Talisman Flame in Fu Daosheng’s hands gave off a feeling of death.

Waving both blades through the air, Fu Daosheng moved.

“Talisman Flame Devours the Land!”

“Exterminate everything in your path, leave nothing standing!”

Fu Daosheng’s voice boomed through the air.

Bang!

The blades tore through space and a massive explosion occurred in the void.

Zhou Hong and the others were shocked when they realized the power Fu Daosheng wielded.

“Nice!” Zhou Hong couldn’t help but scream in joy.

When they saw how the Talisman Flame Blades tore through the space, they were overjoyed. Their emotions were further amplified when they saw how it landed on the eye of the formation. In an instant, brilliant rays of light emerged from the depths of the immortal cave and the space started to shake.

The Immemorial Grand Formation was acting in self-preservation after taking on Fu Daosheng’s strike!

The smile on everyone’s face became a little brighter.

“Fu Daosheng is too damn strong! He managed to shatter the immemorial grand dao energy protecting the formation!”

“Brother Yang Jia, the moment Fu Daosheng shatters the formation, Huang Xiaolong would receive a serious backlash. That will be our chance!” one of the Primal Ancestors beside Yang Jia chuckled.

A light flashed in Yang Jia’s eyes, and he nodded his head slowly.

However, the situation spiraled out of their control as immemorial grand dao energy poured out from the eye of the formation to devour the Talisman Flame Blades.

As though they had never existed in the first place, the Talisman Flame dissipated.

It was like a massive rock that Fu Daosheng had thrown at the sea. It might have been a formidable force, but it was only able to cause a slight ripple before disappearing forever. The immemorial grand dao energy filled the space around them once again.

“What?!”

Zhou Hong and the others felt as though a bucket of cold water was poured over their heads.

When Fu Daosheng had made his move earlier, all of them had expected it to shatter the eye of the Immemorial Grand Formation… However…

Fu Daosheng’s Talisman Flame couldn’t be seen anywhere!

“No… Impossible!” Fu Daosheng, who was standing arrogantly in the air, stared at the scene before him in disbelief.

Even First Creation Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to take on the strike, much less a formation controlled by a True Saint!

The Immemorial Dao Venerable might have been an existence who could have killed every single one of them with a single breath, but he was no longer present! Even if someone else had obtained the Immemorial Grand Formation, they would never have been able to wield its full strength. It was especially so when Huang Xiaolong was a mere True Saint! According to him, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to bring out even one ten thousandths of its power! He couldn’t be more wrong as his strike didn’t even shake the defensive barrier around the formation eye! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What in the world just happened?!

He had utilized his ultimate strike, but he only managed to cause the barrier around the formation to ripple! He couldn’t even reach the dao runes around it!

Rage filled his heart as Fu Daosheng felt that he was humiliated by Huang Xiaolong in front of everyone present. Pushing himself past his limit, the Talisman Flame in his hand became even stronger.

“This time, Fu Daosheng will definitely be able to shatter the formation!” Zhou Hong screamed. He could feel that Fu Daosheng’s Talisman Flame was stronger than before.

Fu Daosheng was using everything in him for this final strike!

“Talisman Flame Phoenix! Shatter the formation!”

A horrifying wave of energy emerged from Fu Daosheng’s body and the Talisman Flame around him turned into a blazing phoenix as it charged towards the river of immemorial grand dao energy protecting the formation. The phoenix was so large that it covered the skies.

Boom!

Breaking through the surface of the river, it smashed into countless waves formed by the immemorial grand dao energy. It might have looked stronger, but after the phoenix entered the river, peace returned to the surface. It was as though nothing had happened.

“How can this happen?!” Fu Daosheng screamed in anger when he realized that he had failed to shatter the formation even with his full power.

As a half-step Dao Venerable, he failed to shatter a formation operated by a True Saint!

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips when he saw the look of disbelief that evolved to one of desperation on Fu Daosheng’s face. Ordinary Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm would be dead before they could blink if Fu Daosheng were to use his ultimate strike on them. However, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary Ninth Heaven True Saint.
