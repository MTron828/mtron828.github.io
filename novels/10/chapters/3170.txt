Chapter 3171: In This Holy World, You Have the Highest Authority?

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Shi Xiaofei, and the others felt horror facing the Chen Family experts’ collective killing intent.

Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at the Chen Family Patriarch who was peering down at him and his family condescendingly from midair and uttered three words, “Get down here!”

Get down here!

These three words exploded like ten thousand echoes of thunder.

The entire Deer Spring Holy Land’s sky rumbled, frightening many experts that they were kneeling on the ground in reverence.

In the next second, the Chen Family Patriarch crashed to the ground as if he was struck by a great impact, and the several hundred experts with him fell to the ground like drops of rain.

Miserable screams reverberated in the air as if it would never end.

Blood sprayed out from the several hundred Chen Family experts’ mouths.

Patriarch Chen’s flesh split in various places, and his armor exploded to smithereens, revealing the net-like bloodlines that ran all over his body. His hair was disheveled, and blood flowed out from his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. He was a stark contrast to his inviolable majestic appearance a moment ago.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, the little cow, Old Man Grandmist, Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and the rest watched with dumbfounded eyes, with disbelief was written on their faces as they looked dazedly at the several hundred Chen Family experts and the Chen Family Patriarch.

“This, this is not an illusion, right?” Huang Xiaohai stuttered stupidly.

Huang Xiaolong landed a kick on Huang Xiaohai’s backside and snorted. “Illusion your as*!”

Huang Xiaohai protected his backside, then as he realized something, he yelled loudly in joy, looking especially thrilled, “Big Brother, you, you’re really a True Saint expert?!”

He thought that if Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a True Saint expert, how could he possibly make the Chen Family Patriarch fall from the air?

Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong in pleasant surprise.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “You can say so. I already said it earlier, but no one believed me.”

Huang Xiaohai scratched his head, feeling as awkward as the others.

The two Chen Family guards, who had mocked Huang Xiaolong repeatedly, stared at Huang Xiaolong with petrified faces. This, this young man is really a True Saint Realm expert?!

There was ssh’ing sounds from the restaurant staff’s pants.

When the others turned to look, they saw a yellow puddle under his feet.

“You—!” The Chen Family Patriarch was terrified as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, and then quickly scrambled to his feet and knelt before Huang Xiaolong. “Lord, have mercy, have mercy!”

He kowtowed incessantly.

In general, not even a peak Ninth Order half-True Saint could exert such might with merely his voice, thus the young man could only be a True Saint Realm expert!

Although the Chen Family was considered as one of the big families in Deer Spring Holy Land, he, the Chen Family Patriarch, could only prostrate humbly in front of a True Saint Realm expert.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept past the Chen Family Patriarch as he reached out and pulled a silver-haired old man out from the void. The old man crashed to the ground, and when the Chen Family Patriarch saw this silver-haired old man, he cried out, “Old Ancestor!”

Huang Peng, Shi Xiafei, and the others were genuinely shocked when they heard the Chen Family Patriarch calling the silver-haired old man old ancestor.

“Lord, please show mercy!” After rolling out from the void, the Chen Family’s old ancestor knelt towards Huang Xiaolong in fear, not knowing what had happened.

“Saint Luquan and I have been friends for many years, and we’re familiar old friends. I beg Lord to please spare the Chen Family looking at the sake of Saint Luquan!” Chen Family’s old ancestor pleaded.

There was no temperature in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he listened to the Chen Family’s old ancestor use Saint Luqian to ‘pressure’ him. Huang Xiaolong once again reached to the void and pulled out another person clad in holy robe, and exuded a majestic momentum exceeding the Chen Family old ancestor.

“Saint Luquan!” The Chen Family’s old ancestor and patriarch gasped.

Saint Luquan?! Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others looked extremely skeptical.

Saint Luquan was terrified half to death after being pulled out from his secret chamber to this place by Huang Xiaolong, and he knelt in salute and asked respectfully, “Lord, you are…?”

“Huang Xiaolong,” Huang Xiaolong stated in a tepid tone.

Chen Family’s old ancestor might have been unaware, but this Saint Luquan had to have heard of him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As expected, when Saint Luquan heard Huang Xiaolong’s name, he crawled towards Huang Xiaolong with a terrified face, “I, I didn’t know it is the World Master, I beg for the World Master’s pardon!”

World Master!

Not only Huang Peng’s side was dumbfounded, but even the Chen Family’s old ancestor and those that noticed the commotion there were stupefied.

“Go check the matters of the Chen Family, deal with it, and report to the Holy Heavens,” Huang Xiaolong ordered Saint Luquan.

“Yes, Lord World Master!” Saint Luquan kowtowed as he complied.

“Father, Mother, let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong turned around and said to his family. He took out the Purple Lightning Peak, expanded it, and brought everyone inside.

The sky-eclipsing Purple Lightning Peak, and everything that happened that day were too much to take in for Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others. When they finally reacted, the Purple Lightning Peak had turned into a streak of purple lightning and disappeared from the Deer Spring Holy Land.

“Big Brother, that Saint Luquan calls you Lord World Master?” As usual, Huang Xiaohai was the first to ask questions.

Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Facing the curious and doubtful glances, Huang Xiaolong smiled and admitted, “Yes, I am the World Master for this holy world.”

Although most of them had guessed it, it was still shocking and surprising to hear it straight from Huang Xiaolong.

“Big Brother, does that mean you’re the biggest boss in this holy world?” Huang Xiaohai asked with brightly shining eyes.

Huang Xiaolong could guess what his younger brother was thinking without the need to ask, and he chided good-naturedly, “I am the biggest here, but if you make a mistake, you’ll be punished just the same.”

“Ah!” Huang Xiaohai’s jaw dropped in disbelief, causing others to laugh at him.

Roughly two weeks later, the group reached the Holy Heavens Headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong, and the four ladies took the time to explain about the subsequent cultivation realms, such as the True Saint Realm, Primal Ancestor Realm, Dao Venerable Realm. They also explained what absolute powers were, as well as the various forces of Cangqiong Holy World, Origin Holy World, and Divine Tuo Holy World to the newly ascended group.

Hence, they were repeatedly shocked and amazed.

When they reached the Holy Heavens Headquarters, Cangqiong Old Man, the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, and Elder Crow had already led a large group of experts waiting to welcome them.

That night, there was a large feast at the Holy Heavens Headquarters, and wine flowed endlessly in the merry-making.

For a period of time, Huang Xiaolong remained at the Holy Heavens Headquarters with his family and friends. During the day, he would give guidance in their cultivation, and the night was naturally allocated for his women.

Huang Xiaolong poured all his feelings into action, every night, and amorous noises could be heard.

Several hundred years went by quickly.

In these several hundred years, under various spiritual pills, herbs, and Huang Xiaolong’s help, everyone who had ascended broke through to Venerable Sovereign Realm. Huang Xiaolong also used the blood moon, Pure Soil, and absolute powers to strengthen and improve everyone’s physique and talent.
