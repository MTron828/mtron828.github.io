The middle-aged man suddenly opened his eyes from his meditation. There were roiling chaos lightning-like waves in the depths of his pupils. Just a little bit of the chaos lightning was enough to shatter space, forming a lightning black hole.

This middle-aged man was the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Chief of Hall Masters, Zhao Lei!

Surnamed Zhao, and his name was a single ‘Lei (雷 [1])’ character.

The numerous lightning streaks in Zhao Lei’s eyes multiplied and intensified, then when it seemed like the lightning streaks were about to explode, they vanished without a clue.

There was a heavy disappointment in Zhao Lei’s eyes, and he sighed heavily while muttering, “Still a bit lacking, I still can’t breakthrough to the eleventh level of Amplified Lightning Tactics!” He paused for a moment, then muttered under his breath, “I wonder how’s Liu Qin and Fu Feiyu’s performing among this batch’s rankings competition. The competition has been going on for almost a month.”

Zhao Lei stood up as he muttered to himself and took a step forward. Almost immediately, he appeared in a hall, and there was a crushed communication talisman on his palm.

Shortly, an honest looking young man arrived at the hall in a streak of light and respectfully saluted, “Master, what instructions do you have?”

“How’s the current batch of disciples’ rankings competition? Is Peng Xiao in the first place, followed by Fu Feiyu and Liu Qin in second and third places?” asked Zhao Lei.

The young man froze for a second. He hesitated but reported honestly, “Master, Peng Xiao is indeed in the first place, however, Fu Feiyu is not in the second place.”

Zhao Lei froze for a second in surprise. A moment later, he asked tentatively, “Fu Feiyu is not in second place? Is it Liu Qin then?”

The young man replied, “Not Liu Qin. It’s a disciple called Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang Xiaolong?” The name didn’t ring any bell in Zhao Lei’s mind, so he asked the young man, sounding a little confused, “Is Huang Xiaolong also a God King Realm disciple in this batch of disciples?”

Why hadn’t he heard of this disciple before?

The young man shook his head and said, “He’s not. Huang Xiaolong is only a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple.” There was a strange expression on the young man’s face as he went on, “But Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength is truly amazing. During this one month, all the disciples who have come across him, were sent flying with one move. It was the same result even if it was a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple!”

“What?!” Zhao Lei exclaimed in surprise.

Even a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple was sent flying with one move!

“This, this Huang Xiaolong, is really only a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm?” Zhao Lei asked the young man. The tone of his voice changed slightly, laced with urgency.

It was shocking if this Huang Xiaolong was really only a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple.

The young man replied respectfully, “That is so, Master. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation is indeed only at the peak of early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, and the strange thing is, his godhead is merely the high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead. Oh right, I’ve heard that Huang Xiaolong has a variant True Dragon Physique that’s absolutely monstrous. His True Dragon Physique can continuously evolve, and this has sparked the interest of various Hall Masters, as they are saying that Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique is comparable to the third ranked Great Holy Physique!”

“A variant True Dragon Physique that can evolve without limit, which is comparable to the third ranked Great Holy Physique!” Zhao Lei repeated in astonishment.

“Come on, follow me to the examination hall!”

With that said, a flow of godforce wrapped around him and his disciple. They teleported and arrived at the examination hall almost immediately.

When Zhao Lei appeared in the examination hall, he instantaneously discovered the rowdy atmosphere akin to a market. With a little effort in listening, Zhao Lei learned that everyone was talking about Huang Xiaolong.

The Enforcement Hall Master Gongsun Chi and Medicine Hall Master Xu Wen were bickering so hard that their faces had turned red. Both wanted to take Huang Xiaolong as their personal disciple! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Therefore, no one noticed when Zhao Lei appeared in the hall.

“It’s the Chief of Hall Masters!” Finally, one of the Elders noticed Zhao Lei and exclaimed.

The hall came to an abrupt silence.

“Greetings, Chief of Hall Masters!”

Whether it was Gongsun Chi, Xu Wen, even Zhang Dong, and other Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders all saluted Zhao Lei respectfully.

As the Chief of Hall Masters, Zhao Lei oversaw the various halls under the Fortune Emperor Palace, hence, his status and identity were very high, only a slightly below the Fortune Emperor and several Ancestors. Not to mention, Zhao Lei’s strength was far above Gongsun Chi, Xu Wen, and the other Hall Masters.

Zhao Lei nodded at them and said, “Stand up.”

Gongsun Chi, Xu Wen, Zhang Dong, and the rest stood up from the floor

Zhao Lei looked at everyone and chuckled as he spoke openly, “Don’t be so nervous. I heard there’s a kid called Huang Xiaolong in this batch of disciples, and he has performed overly well in the rankings competition. So I came to take a look out of curiosity. But I hadn’t expected to see all of you talking about him as well? In that case, I’m even more interested to see Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength, and see if his variant True Dragon Physique really rivals the Great Holy Physique!”

Gongsun Chi, Xu Wen, Zhang Dong, and the others chuckled softly.

Zhao Lei looked at the ranking list at the center of the hall, and found a disciple named Huang Xiaolong ranked second, below Peng Xiao’s name.

Zhao Lei subsequently walked towards one of the mirror jades and watched Huang Xiaolong’s actions through the mirror jade.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong who was on the giant Cloudless Island, had no clue that he had become the biggest attraction for the Elders, Grand Elders, Hall Masters, and even the Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei.

“Exactly six hundred.’’ Huang Xiaolong had just successfully snatched two more Fortune Divine Fruits from a disciple, adding them to his own collection—exactly six hundred Fortune Divine Fruits.

Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense swept over his identity token and noted Peng Xiao was at first place with six hundred and thirty-one Fortune Divine Fruits.

This raised a smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Thirty-one fruits, it’s not hard to surpass.

Fu Feiyu and Liu Qin were ranking below him respectively with five hundred and twelve, and four hundred and forty-three Fortune Divine Fruits.

Compared to the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, somewhere in the giant Cloudless Island, Fu Feiyu and Liu Qin were extremely sullen. Their eyes were spewing fire as they stared at the name at the second place on the rankings list.

Especially Liu Qin who was somewhere above a stretch of sea, screamed in denial with a distorted face, “Impossible! How could that bast*rd get so many Fortune Divine Fruits! Did he bribe other disciples, so they gave him their Fortune Divine Fruits?!”

That was not improbable. As long as Huang Xiaolong had given them high enough price, the disciples who had realized early on that they had no hope of entering the top one thousand might really have agreed to give Huang Xiaolong their Fortune Divine Fruits.

There was no other explanation in Liu Qin’s opinion. Otherwise, how could Huang Xiaolong have more Fortune Divine Fruits than him and Fu Feiyu!

A mere peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple was actually ranked higher than them, the two God King Realm masters?!

“If I find that punk, I’ll crush him on the spot!” Liu Qin bellowed in anger.

Right at this time, he noticed several disciples flying towards him.

This group of disciples was the same group who was defeated by Huang Xiaolong. They had his communication talismans, with his order to contact him if they came across Liu Qin or Fu Feiyu.

They were delighted when they spotted Liu Qin from a far distance, and flew towards him as fast as they could.

“Senior Brother Liu! We’ve found you at last!” One of the disciples shouted.

The ecstatic expressions on their faces confused Liu Qin.
