Chapter 2595: Origin

Xu Wen and the others felt as though they had seen a ghost.

“Do you know how Li Yapeng died?” Huang Xiaolong stared at them with a cold gaze as the light of his dao heart pierced through the chest of the holy emperor he captured.

The holy emperor withered down to nothingness with speed visible to the naked eye as his miserable shrieks pierced through the air.

Terrified expressions appeared on the faces of You Shiheng and the others. Previously, they had thought that Huang Xiaolong had only managed to kill Li Yapeng with a dao artifact, but now, they finally discovered the true way Li Yapeng had died.

“Anyone else?” Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across those present and asked.

No one dared to respond.

“Domain Lord You,” Huang Xiaolong stared straight at You Shiheng as a dazzling smile appeared on his face. “Since you’re the Domain Lord, you shall be the first to make the choice! Submit or die!”

You Shiheng’s body trembled once as panic set in.

“Relax. I’ll give you one whole minute to consider your options,” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in his ears once again.

One minute?! What the f…

With despair taking over his mind, You Shiheng wanted to curse Huang Xiaolong’s ancestors, but he didn’t dare to.

Xu Wen and Xu Hai stared at You Shiheng with looks of trepidation.

With his weird zombie-like face, Hei Luo started counting down. “Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty-seven…”

Very quickly, he arrived at the last ten seconds.

You Shifeng felt as though those grandaunts in his manor were sitting on his chest with their giant a**es, and he couldn’t breathe properly.

“Nine,” Hei Luo continued.

You Shiheng finally realized that his time was about to run out, and his mind started to spin.

“Eight.”

Xu Wen and Xu Hai started to panic.

“Seven.” Hei Luo’s deep voice seemed to mirror the endless void.

Finally descending into insanity, You Shiheng screamed, “Even if you kill me, I will never submit! The master of the Otherworldly Mansion will definitely learn of the matter today! They will take revenge for me, and you won’t be able to live for much longer!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and spoke in the calmest way possible, “I have an Inextinguishable Dao Heart.”

You Shiheng stared at him silently.

Indeed. With the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, no one would be able to kill him! Even if the Primal Ancestors of the Otherworldly Mansion worked together, they wouldn’t be able to do a thing to him!

“Five,” Hei Luo continued.

“You…” Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, You Shiheng wanted to continue his threats.

“I have an Inextinguishable Dao Heart,” Huang Xiaolong interrupted him again with the same sentence.

You Shifeng felt a sickly sweet feeling welling up in his throat when he realized that none of his threats would be of use.

“Four.”

“AHHHHHH!” Hearing the annoying voice coming from the zombie-like man beside the human, You Shiheng roared in anger and sent a punch flying over. All he wanted to do was to punch that damn zombie so hard that he wouldn’t be able to tell left from right.

Before his hand could land on Hei Luo’s face, a black-colored palm wrapped itself around his fist. Like the wrapper around a dumpling, Hei Luo’s arm was the skin and You Shiheng’s fist was the filling.

You Shiheng stared at Hei Luo as his eyes went wide. The other experts didn’t believe their eyes either, and Zi Dongping narrowed his eyes. Even someone at his level couldn’t see how Hei Luo stopped the attack.

Releasing You Shiheng, Hei Luo didn’t wait for him to rejoice before sending another fist into his chest. Feeling the entire world spinning around him, You Shiheng’s body spun round and round, but his head remained in its place.

No one could believe their eyes.

How is this possible?!

Only after spinning for quite some time did You Shiheng stop. His vision had gone completely black.

Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab You Shiheng by the neck as a frosty light flashed through his eyes. “Time is up!”

“Wait!” You Shiheng screamed, but Huang Xiaolong’s dao heart’s dao light had already pierced through his chest.

Staring at the hole in his chest, You Shiheng lamented that there was no divine pill to turn back time.

“I gave you a chance,” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the skies.

You Shiheng’s body started to wither, and the panicked screams of the experts he had brought over, filled the air!

“Domain Lord!” “Kill!” an enforcer yelled before charging at Huang Xiaolong.

Before the enforcer could even arrive, Hei Luo grabbed the man by the throat and flung him into his mouth. The army that was about to follow behind the enforcer froze in their place when they saw what had happened.

However, there were some who disregarded the dangers and rushed towards Huang Xiaolong without a care for their lives.

Even though they knew that they would die, they didn’t regret their actions!

Hei Luo didn’t hesitate as he returned to his true form. Turning into the black corpse from the Black Corpse Devil Cave, his body stood several dozen thousand feet tall as dark corpse qi filled the space around him. Slamming his palm down, he killed every single person, who dared to charge at him.

Even Zi Dongping jumped in fright when he saw Hei Luo’s true form. He had always been suspicious about Hei Luo’s origin, but he finally realized the zombie’s true form! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He was a spirit puppet refined with the corpse of a Primal Ancestor! Moreover, he wasn’t just an ordinary Primal Ancestor when he was alive… With the strength contained in Hei Luo’s moves, Zi Dongping knew that he had to be a rank-two or rank-three Primal Ancestor when he was alive.

Turning to stare at Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t understand how the kid had managed to get his hands on someone at that level!

…

An hour passed.

Obediently standing behind Huang Xiaolong, Hei Luo had already returned to his tiny form. Even though he stood tall at three meters, he didn’t emit the slightest aura. The only weird thing about him was that his skin was charred black. No one would think that the zombie-like man standing beside Huang Xiaolong was a Primal Ancestor!

Other than You Shiheng and several experts, who were killed by Huang Xiaolong, the Xu Brothers, along with most of the holy emperors had agreed to submit to Huang Xiaolong.

After controlling Xu Wen and Xu Hai, Huang Xiaolong immediately laid down the order to spread the rumor that You Shiheng had offended Zi Dongping and was taken down by the Primal Ancestor! He conveniently pushed the deaths of Li Yapeng and the others onto Zi Dongping.

The news of You Shiheng’s death started to spread through the lands and everyone started discussing the matter.

“What?! Domain Lord You Shiheng died?! He was killed by the patriarch of the Purple Spider Race! It’s been so many years since Zi Dongping’s disappearance!”

“I wonder if Lord Zi Dongping has regained his full strength…?!”

A simple rumor raised thousands of waves in the Dissociation Domain.

As night fell, Huang Xiaolong stared at the city beneath him with Zi Dongping and Hei Luo standing beside him.

“What’s the matter with Yuan Qianxing from the Otherworldly Mansion?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Zi Dongping and asked.

Since Zi Dongping could compare Huang Xiaolong to Yuan Qianxing, he definitely had his reasons. Huang Xiaolong was extremely curious as to Yuan Qianxing’s talent.
