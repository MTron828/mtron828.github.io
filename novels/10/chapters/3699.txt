Chapter 3700 – Golden Qilin King

Other than the devilish creatures, there were countless herbs and treasures lying within. There were even several treasures that couldn’t be found in the outside world! Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t slow down to pick them up.

As someone who stood at the peak of the world, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t lacking in such treasures.

After the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the region masters’ surrender, Huang Xiaolong could obtain anything he wanted with a snap of his fingers. He couldn’t obtain universe-level spiritual veins in the past, but with a single order, he could gather every single universe-level spiritual vein in their treasuries. He wouldn’t be able to utilize them all.

As such, Huang Xiaolong would be able to charge straight through to the 29 billion mark the moment he broke through the barrier to the peak of the grand completion stage.

As he flew towards the depths of the Devil Abyss to look for Mo Kun, the Devil Land suffered from a massive invasion from the devilish creatures. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Those were the creatures that lived in the Devil Land, and they were even more terrifying than the vicious beasts in the other lands. Normally, the creatures would remain in their territory without disturbing the humans. Now, they rushed out like a tide as they attacked every single territory populated by the Human Race.

There were several regions without sufficiently strong experts and they were overwhelmed in an instant.

The Humans and Devils in the Devil Land were devoured by the creatures.

As the massacre started, chaos filled the lands.

In the Devil Capital Celestial Empire, they were surrounded by devilish creatures in all directions.

Activating the city protecting formation, every creature who drew near to the city were killed. Despite the resistance, the devilish creatures charged towards the city without caring for their lives. They had one goal and one goal only. They wanted to bring down the city!

The Devouring Devil, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen, and the others stared at the creatures that filled the skies as a frown formed on their faces.

“They definitely received instructions from someone to start creating havoc in the Unknown Space…” The God of Death growled. “Seems like the Universe First Race is starting to make their move.”

The Devouring Devil, Mo Ren, sighed, “According to the reports, other celestial empires are suffering from a sudden invasion from the creatress. More than ninety percernt of the territories are currently stuck in a war with the creatures!

The Dragon Overlord’s eyes flashed red and he chuckled, “I haven’t flexed my muscles for quite some time…” Turning to look at the God of Death and Zhu Chen, he continued, “Let’s go out and have some fun. We’ll see who kills the most…”

A grin slowly formed on their faces.

“Alright!” The God of Death roared with laughter, “We’ll kill to our heart’s content!”

“Nice!” The Dragon Overlord roared. “When the lord returns, we’ll surprise him!”

Zhu Chen muttered, “What do you mean? It’s just a little hiccup…” As soon as he spoke, he left the confines of the barrier.

The Dragon Overlord and the God of Death followed quickly behind. After all, the enemies were too weak. If Zhu Chen got a head start, they could be stronger than him for all he cared. The lead he gained was unlikely to shrink!

As soon as they arrived outside the barrier, they attacked in unison.

With a single punch, the Dragon Overlord summoned a myriad of golden dragons. Nothing remained in their way.

The God of Death sent a giant palm flying through space as it slowly transformed into a massive skull. It tore a giant hole through the group of creatures before disappearing into the horizon.

Zhu Chen rose into the skies as flames surrounded his body. He seemed to have turned into a giant phoenix as he incinerated every creature nearby.

The five monster kings appeared one after another as they went on a rampage.

Every time they attacked, the skies would shatter and the earth would shake. They were obviously much more efficient killing machines than the three.

The marshals and generals stationed in the city gasped in fright when they saw the scene playing outside the barrier.

No matter which one of the eight they looked at, they knew that those were existences far beyond their level. Mo Ren’s combat abilities closed in on the 19 billion mark. Even if he ran into Gui Chi or several others, he would be able to put up a fight. Now, he realized that he was as weak as a newborn child before the eight supreme masters outside the barrier.

Just as they were destroying everything around them happily, a golden scaled arm appeared from the void.

There were mysterious runes carved into the arm, and they formed images of a golden qilin!

The arm swept towards the Dragon Overlord the moment it appeared!

Bang!

The instant they collided, a massive blast rocked through the space.

A golden palm print appeared above the Dragon Overlord as it came crashing down.

The God of Death and the others yelled, “Be careful!” They didn’t hesitate. They launched their attacks in unison to stop the golden palm. Right before the palm could land on the Dragon Overlord’s head, a supreme dragon appeared to defend him.

That was the limit of the Dragon Overlord’s strength. It wasn’t something he would use to slay the puny devilish creatures.

The heavens seemed to lose their color when the explosion occurred.

Even when the three of them worked together, they were sent flying by the giant palm.

When they finally found their footing, blood leaked from the side of their lips.

Everyone in the city sucked in a cold breath.

The three supreme overlords were sent flying with a single strike!

“Golden Qilin King!” The three of them roared as they looked at the void above them.

A middle-aged man slowly revealed himself.

He looked extremely sturdy and his body seemed like a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.

“Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen… We meet again.” The middle-aged man looked at the three and he muttered. Even his eyes dazzled a shiny gold.

The person who came was the Golden Qilin King, one of the thirteen kings of the Universe First Race!

He was slightly stronger than the Golden Cymbals King when it came to combat abilities!

The Golden Cymbals King has already surpassed 27 billion units in combat strength, and one could only imagine how strong the Golden Qilin King was!

The three of them felt an uneasy feeling welling up in their chest when they looked at the Golden Qilin King.

Casually looking at the five monster kings, the Golden Qiling King harrumphed, “Looks like Huang Xiaolong isn’t all talk… He even managed to subdue the five monster kings of the Naihe Bridge.”

“It’s too bad he didn’t bring the Ghost Devil King along!”
