It didn’t take long for Jin Hai and Wei Zhi to arrive. Even though they were Gods of Creation, they were extremely respectful when speaking to Huang Xiaolong.

In the main hall, Huang Xiaolong invited them to take a seat.

“When the ghost corpse army attacked the city in the past, you managed to save the city single-handedly. We are extremely grateful to fellow cultivator.” Jin Hai stood up and cupped his fists.

Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “It’s nothing.”

Wei Zhi stood up soon after, and he bowed respectfully, “Our Jin Family and Wei Family managed to gather up several creation level pills, and creation level herbs. We have two universe-level spiritual veins, and we wish to present them to fellow cultivator for saving the city.” He handed over a spatial ring after he spoke.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject the gifts.

“I came to the Limitless Land not too long ago, and I’m unfamiliar with the situation here. Please enlighten me.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Getting to their feet, Wei Zhi and Jin Hai stood at attention. “We will answer your questions to the best of our abilities!”

Since they heard the reports, they had their guesses that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t from the Limitless Land. After all, he was too damn strong! If he hailed from the Limitless Land, his name would have long since shocked the world.

As such, they didn’t question him about the fact that he was unfamiliar with the Limitless Land.

Soon after, he asked them many questions about the current situation.

Huang Xiaolong subdued the five beast kings in the past and looked through their memories in order to gain a clearer picture about the Limitless Land. Even so, the five beast kings weren’t Gods of Creation, and the secrets of the world were hidden from them. As experts in the God of Creation Realm, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were much more reliable when it came to information regarding the Limitless Land.

The first question Huang Xiaolong had was the strength of the Limitless Master. Since he was currently in someone else’s territory, he had to know how strong they were.

When they heard his question, the two of them were taken aback.

“The Limitless Master has two great worlds, and we are unable to estimate his strength. However, there were rumors going around that he managed to accumulate 17 to 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy.” Jin Hai frowned.

Indeed…

Huang Xiaolong snorted in his heart.

In the past, he managed to estimate the strength of the Limitless Master after looking at the restrictions in Jin Shi’s dao soul. He guessed that the man was slightly weaker than himself, and as it turned out, he was right!

He continued to ask about the various God of Creation Realm experts in the Limitless Land. There weren’t too many of them with two great worlds.

However, he was shocked by the fact that there were more than six thousand God of Creation Realm experts in the Limitless Land!

There were more than a thousand God of Creation Realm experts in the First Universe, but that was a mere fraction of those in the Limitless Land!

There were dozens of unexplored regions in the Unknown Space!

Soon after, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi revealed that there were more than forty regions in the Unknown Space, and the Limitless Land ranked somewhere in the middle.

When Huang Xiaolong asked about the strongest expert in the Unknown Space, Jin Hai and Wei Zhi paused for a second. They were shocked that Huang Xiaolong had no idea who the strongest expert was.

“I’ve been in seclusion for a long time… I emerged recently, and I have no idea who the strongest person here is.” Huang Xiaolong explained.

The two of them gasped in fright.

There weren’t too many people who were like Huang Xiaolong…

“The strongest experts in the Unknown Space are the Ferocious Devil, Azure Ghost, Dragon Overlord, Zhu Chen, and the God of Death! The five of them are comparable in strength.” Jin Hai explained. “They are experts who possess almost 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy. As for their combat strength, it has far exceeded their current realm.”

Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned when he heard the revelation, but it was within his expectations. They might be strong, but he had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy. With the Star Dragon Divine Tree and Universe Boat, his combat abilities had far surpassed his level.

The only thing that shocked him was the fact that there were several people who managed to create two great worlds. Of course, there was no one with three great worlds.

Huang Xiaolong was the only God of Creation who possessed three great worlds.

As long as he had enough resources, it was a matter of time before he surpassed them!

The number of Gods of Creation might be several times that of the First Universe, but there were rarely any experts at the level of Zhu Qiming and Hao Jin!

There were many half step Universe Gods who had less than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

“Have you heard of Zhu Qiming?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Lord Zhu Qiming?” The two of them jumped in fright when they heard his name.

“What’s with your reactions?

A bitter smile appeared on Wei Zhi’s face. “Lord Zhu Qiming is extremely famous! He’s the son of Lord Zhu Chen, and he’s the second most talented person in the second generation of the Unknown Space! It’s said that Lord Zhu Qiming has already broken through the 14 billion units mark. It’s said that he’ll break through the 19 billion units mark as long as he sets his mind to it!”

“However, it’s unknown whether or not Lord Zhu Qiming’s great worlds would experience a transformation to allow him to break through the 20 billion mark!”

When the two of them spoke of the transformation, Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled.

From the two of them, Huang Xiaolong learned about the reason behind the transformation of his great worlds.

The most important factor behind the transformation was one’s cultivation realm being at the half step Universe God Realm. Of course, that wasn’t the only reason behind the transformation. Only a small fraction of them would be able to transform their great worlds.

The higher the talent and grade of their secret art, the greater the possibility of transformation!

The three of them chatted for more than an hour before they stopped.

“Lord, we discovered that Jin Shi and the others went to Cloud Mountain.” Wei Zhi continued, “However, Lord Zhang Yun wasn’t available as he went to the Land of Death. He’ll only be back after a few years.”

Instead of responding to the report, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Do you know where I can find universe-level spiritual veins in the Limitless Land?”
