“Master!” Chen Wenli was finally able to scream out, “Zheng Guowen, Chen Zheng, and the others have betrayed the Sand Waves Sect. Arrest them all and punish them with a death penalty!”

“There’s also this punk! His group! Tear them into a million pieces!”

Chen Wenli glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, his eyes filled with hatred. If looks could kill, he would have torn Huang Xiaolong into several million pieces by now.

Gui Yi had carried Chen Wenli his shoulder all the way from the Long Sun City like a tied up clown on a parade, which had turned Chen Wenli into a laughing stock. The other forces’ experts’ laughing faces were still vivid in his mind. He’s going to payback this humiliation a thousand times!

But, Chen Wenli had barely finished venting his fury, when a sword appeared in Gui Yi’s hand. With a swift flick of his wrist, the sword slashed across Chen Wenli’s face. Blood spurted out from Chen Wenlu’s mouth as Gui Yi cut off his tongue.

Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders were all outraged by Gui Yi’s action.

Violent killing intent roiled in Cao Fang’s eyes. The other side had actually dared to hurt his disciple right in front of him! This was a completely disrespectful behavior towards him !

“Courting death!” Cao Fang roared, and he lethally punched Gui Yi. The fist force rumbled unpredictably like layers of sandstorm. No one could guess where the punch would land.

Gui Yi snorted coldly. In a split second, as his fist swung out, roiling ghost fog surged forth, forming numerous ghostly shadows that covered the sky.

Rumble~!

Thunderous booms shook the air, and terrifying shockwaves swept out in four directions. The spiritual flowers and spiritual trees in the proximity were uprooted, and the ground quaked.

Gui Yi staggered back several steps from the collision before regaining his balance.

Even though Cao Fang’s cultivation was at the peak late of Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, Gui Yi’s strength had risen dramatically in recent years, and his battle power was above the average cultivator, therefore, his overall strength was not weaker than Cao Fang.

Since Gui Yi had successfully withstood Cao Fang’s punch, Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, and Li Ye were genuinely shocked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“So, you’re a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, no wonder you dared to act so arrogantly!” Cao Fang’s expression grew colder as his gaze swept over the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and Gui Er. He then said, “It seems, the few of you are all late-Tenth Order, or peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.”

As void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Fegn Er, and Gui Er had concealed their cultivation realm with secret methods, Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, and Li Ye were unable to determine their exact strengths.

Deng Qishun also had an ugly expression as he looked sternly at Huang Xiaolong. “Kid, even if you have four late-Tenth Order, or peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters with you, that doesn’t mean you can come swaggering into our Sand Waves Sect! I’m giving you one chance; first, release Wenli, then take out one thousand chaos spiritual pills, and one hundred pieces of grade six spiritual stones as compensation!”

“Lastly, handover Zheng Guowen, Chen Zheng, and the rest of the traitors, to be punished by our Sand Waves Sect!”

“Or else, this Wind Waves Desert will become your burial place!”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and Gui Er, as well as the several chaos spiritual beasts laughed wantonly.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow shook their heads as they snickered.

Deng Qishun glared frostily at them, “You don’t agree?”

“I say, little guy, did you think that we would agree?” The little cow questioned in return.

Little guy? Deng Qishun and the others were dumbfounded.

Deng Qishun was still fuming when Huang Xiaolong said, “Haven’t you all wondered why Liang Luwen, Liang Mingzhi, and other Sand Waves Sect’s disciples have not returned until now?”

Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, Li Ye, and the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders blanked for a moment.

“You’ve taken our Sect Chief and Young Lord hostage?” Li Ye demanded sternly. There was a little hesitation in his voice, “Or you have... our Sect Chief and Young Lord?!”

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng laughed as he answered, “That’s right, your Sect Chief and Young Lord have already been killed by us!”

“What—?!” The Sand Waves Sect’s Elders exclaimed in fright.

“Ancestors, kill them! Avenge our Sect Chief!”

“Kill them, kill all of them!”

The Sand Waves Sect’s Elders shouted angrily.

Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, and Li Ye secretly exchanged a glance, and the three of them simultaneously formed a strange seal with their hands. Immediately, terrifying waves of sword qi shot out from underground towards the sky.

The three of them had activated the Sand Waves Sect’s grand formation—the Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation!

“Manor Lord, watch out!” Feng Er appeared beside Huang Xiaolong. Her eyes surveyed their surroundings as she swept away the sword qi flying out from underground. Gui Yi and Gui Er also swept away the sword qi coming at them.

However, the rays of sword qi were endless. Covering over ten thousand li radius.

Chen Wenli was inwardly gloating when he sensed some panic in Huang Xiaolong’s group at the sudden appearance of the Sand Waves Sect’s Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation. His face warped, but right at this moment, a dozen sword qi from underground pierced through his body.

His eyeballs protruded out as he looked at bloodied holes in his body. The light in his eyes gradually dimmed and vanished.

“Wenli!” Cao Fang cried out from outside the grand formation when he saw his disciple Chen Wenli being pierced by a dozen rays of sword qi and his body plummeting to the ground.

“I want them dead, kill them—!” Cao Fang went berserk. Godforce burst out from his body, flowing vigorously into the Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation.

The number of sword qi shooting out from underground immediately became denser.

Huang Xiaolong turned to the void devil beast Xu Baisheng who was protecting him and said, “No need to worry about me, go and break the formation!”

In a matter of seconds, the several chaos spiritual beasts had suffered severe injuries within the formation. If this were to continue, these chaos spiritual beasts would die in the next few seconds!

The Sand Waves Sect’s grand formation had exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s estimation.

According to Zheng Guowen and Chen Zheng’s previous description, the Sand Waves Sect’s grand formation was not supposed to be this powerful. It seemed like they were not aware of the grand formation’s actual power.

“Break this formation?” Cao Fang’s face contorted as he snickered, “This Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation was arranged by our God King Realm ancestors. Therefore, even a First Order God King Realm won’t be able to break this formation. All of you will be buried with my disciple today!”

Cao Fang, Deng Qishun, and Li Ye increased the power of the formation to the fullest. On top of that, even the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders contributed their godforce into the formation.

However, right at this time, void devil beast Xu Baisheng let out a resounding bellow. He grew several hundred times bigger in the blink of an eye right in front of everyone’s eyes! His momentum soared and corrosive devil qi roiled out from his body like a tsunami.

Subsequently, Xu Baisheng pressed his claw in the air towards the ground.

Rumble!

The ground cracked and crumbled. Muffled blasts came from underground as if something was continuously exploding.

The Confoundment Seven Emotions Extinction Sword Formation covering over ten thousand li radius dispersed suddenly like a mist. At the same time, Cao Feng, Deng Qishun, Li Ye, as well as all the Sand Waves Sect’s Elders were thrown back by an overwhelming force.

The sand in the desert below them was dyed red in color with blood. Under the sunlight the dyed sand appeared glaring red.

Cao Fang and the others were smashed into the man-made hilly terrains below, destroying the beautiful sceneries.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely relieved as Xu Baisheng had succeeded in breaking the Sand Waves Sect’s grand formation. Then, he turned to look at the three Ancestors.

Cao Fang climbed out from a pile of stones. He looked at the void devil beast Xu Baisheng. He was beyond shock as he stammered, “Y-you are a God-God King Realm master?!”

Moreover, a Second Order God King Realm or above?!
