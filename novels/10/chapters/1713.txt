“Ten... Ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones? Senior, are you for real?” Tan Zhiming looked at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous look in his eyes. Could it be that Huang Xiaolong was really serious about his offer?

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “That’s right.” Taking out a spatial ring, Huang Xiaolong flicked it towards Tan Zhiming.

“There are ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones here.” Huang Xiaolong paused for a moment before continuing, “If you have nothing else to say, give me the Seed of Enlightenment.”

“Of course, all of you need to make an oath that you will not leak anything about the Seed of Enlightenment to anyone else.”

Tan Zhiming stared at the mountain-like pile of low-grade chaos spirit stones in the spatial ring in a daze. A burst of joy filled his heart, and he nodded his head like a chicken pecking rice. “Sure, sure! Senior, please rest assured. We will make the oath right now!”

Even though the Seed of Enlightenment was a treasure, it was more like a hot potato to him. He was more than happy to trade it for ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Moreover, it was challenging to cultivate the Seed of Enlightenment. With the resources held by the Spirit Destruction Sect, it was near impossible for the Seed of Enlightenment to germinate.

In an instant, all the disciples of the Spirit Destruction Sect made an oath to the heavens that they would not leak anything regarding the Seed of Enlightenment.

After making the oath, Tan Zhiming personally passed a seed glowing with a resplendent radiance over to Huang Xiaolong.

The seed was as big as an infant, and it resembled Buddha’s head. There were two tiny little eyes on its surface, giving it a human-like look.

After receiving the Seed of Enlightenment, Huang Xiaolong could clearly feel that there were two different energies contained within it. There was Buddhist energy, and there was also a type of radiance energy.

Buddhist Energy in this fruit could allow one to enter zen. Interestingly, its radiance energy was different than that contained in the Heavenly Hall. The radiance energy in the Heavenly Hall and Radiance Divine Scepter held a type of purifying effect. As for the radiance energy contained in the seed, Huang Xiaolong felt that it would hasten the speed of circulating his godforce.

In that instant, Huang Xiaolong even felt the world became transparent before him!

It was an extremely mysterious feeling.

Looking at the Seed of Enlightenment in his hand, a brilliant light flashed through his eyes. It was no wonder the Bodhi Divine Tree ranked first among all the Buddhist World’s divine trees.

Not to mention the fact that he was merely holding the Seed of Enlightenment in his hand. He could only imagine what would be the effects of a mature Bodhi Divine Tree.

Before he could react, the radiance covering the Seed of Enlightenment multiplied by several folds. As though it was resonating with the radiance energy coming from the Heavenly Hall and Divine Radiance Scepter, the Seed of Enlightenment had reacted on its own. Could it be a little excited and happy to meet its kind?

It even started trembling as it spun around Huang Xiaolong’s body. It was acting like a little kid running about in joy.

When Tan Zhiming and the rest saw what was happening, they felt their jaws drop in shock.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he felt a burst of happiness in his heart as he chuckled, “Alright, little one, come down and stop messing about.”

In an instant, the Seed of Enlightenment returned to Huang Xiaolong’s hand. However, it failed to remain still, as though it wasn’t able to contain its excitement. It started to roll about without any intention of stopping.

A smile slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. However, he still threatened it. “If you still mess about, I’m going to refine all the energy in you before throwing you away.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong was kidding, the Seed of Enlightenment didn’t dare to mess about any longer. It turned completely still in case Huang Xiaolong’s words turned out to be true.

“Hehe...” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in joy. He hadn’t felt so happy in a long time. Since he had left for Hell and separated from the little cow, this was the first time he had laughed from the bottom of his heart.

“I wonder how the little cow is doing back in the Grandmist Lands...” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He didn’t know how far her divine soul had recovered, ever since she had started restoring her strength in the Grandmist Lands.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head to get rid of all the random thoughts in his head. He looked at the Seed of Enlightenment that resembled a human head in his hand, and he couldn’t help but think to himself. I wonder what will happen if I refine this seed...?

Since it was the seed of the Divine Bodhi Tree, it possessed unimaginable power. If he really swallowed and refined it, he would probably be able to receive some unexpected gains. He might even directly breakthrough to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm after refining it! Maybe even higher!

There would probably be other uses for the Seed of Enlightenment after he swallowed it as well. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, Huang Xiaolong quickly dismissed the idea.

Even though he would be able to increase his cultivation quickly after refining the Seed of Enlightenment, it would be a waste compared to what he would gain if he successfully allowed the Divine Bodhi Tree to mature!

He was also unwilling to refine the cute little seed, especially now that he had formed some sort of emotional connection with it.

In the next instant, Huang Xiaolong kept the seed into the space between his eyebrows. He was going to allow the lightning energy contained in both lightning pools to nourish the seed.

Finding spirit soil and spirit liquid would be next on the list. After obtaining both, he would be able to grow the Divine Bodhi Tree.

After he was done, he looked at Tan Zhiming and the other disciples from the Spirit Destruction Sect.

When Huang Xiaolong turned his gaze to look at them, they felt uneasy in their hearts.

“Okay, you can leave now.”

As though the mountain pressing on their back was finally lifted, Tan Zhiming and his fellow disciples heaved a sigh of relief. Joy blossomed in their heart, and they thanked Huang Xiaolong before leaping into the air.

In an instant, all of their figures disappeared into the distance.

When Huang Xiaolong saw that they were in such a hurry to leave, he shook his head and laughed before returning to the hidden mountain valley.

He was in an excellent mood after obtaining the Seed of Enlightenment, but his thoughts started to drift. He thought about the Xumi Divine Mountain in the lower world and the old man guarding it.

A weird feeling appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. Am I really fated to cross paths with the Buddhist World?

The Seed of Enlightenment came from the number one tree in the Buddhist World. He was afraid that he possessed the only Seed of Enlightenment in existence. After all, no one could obtain one of the most guarded treasures in the Buddhist World.

In the past, that old man on Mount Xumi had spoken about the matters of him becoming the king of hell. He had even asked Huang Xiaolong what he would do if the Hell Asura World and the Buddhist World broke out into conflict. It seemed as though the old man had already guessed that Huang Xiaolong would be the next king of hell...

Who in the world is that old man?!

Is he the Buddha himself?

That’s not too plausible...

The night eventually passed, and the day started to brighten.

Huang Xiaolong rode on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin as they made their way over to the Heaven Resentment Continent.

“Your Majesty, the news of you going over to the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters has already spread far and wide. Do you think that Liao Yuan would take the chance to leave?” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin paused for a moment before continuing, “There is a chance that the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters is empty right now.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Even if Liao Yuan knows that I’m coming, there is no way he will escape with his entire race.”

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was stunned for a second. However, a lightbulb lit up in its mind. “Do you mean that Chu Han from the Massacring Gods Gate...”

“Yeah. Chu Han will never allow them to leave. Instead, he will force Liao Yuan to wait for me in the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and said.

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin continued to ask, “Is Chu Han planning to use the Black Ant Clan as bait?”

Huang Xiaolong’s laughter reverberated through the air, “I’m afraid Chu Han is already here. He is probably waiting for me to show myself at the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters..."
