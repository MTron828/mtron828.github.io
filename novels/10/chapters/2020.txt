Chapter 2021: Darkness Gold Fruit

When the King of Darkness heard what she said, a frosty expression appeared on his face. “Are we really close to each other?” After speaking to the little cow, he turned around and looked at Huang Xiaolong. Walking towards him, the King of Darkness bowed, “Many thanks for master’s grace. Without Master, I couldn’t have returned to life.”

Huang Xiaolong reached out to help him up. “You are my master’s younger brother. You are my senior. In the future, please call me Xiaolong like how Xiaoniu does.”

The King of Darkness stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. A trace of suspicion flashed through his eyes as he asked, “Xiaoniu?”

Huang Xiaolong tilted his head and looked at the little cow.

The King of Darkness’s eyes widened in shock, and he turned to stare at the little cow. “Her?! Xiaoniu?!” The way Huang Xiaolong addressed her was really shocking to him. The cold expression on his face slowly thawed, and a smile appeared in its place. He eventually roared with laughter.

“Xiaoniu?!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Hahaha! Old Ancestor Azure Cow is now Xiaoniu?!”

His laughter shook the space around him.

When the little cow saw the mocking look on his face, her face flushed red, and she raced, “Old Black, what are you laughing at?! Is my name really so funny?”

The King of Darkness reverted back to his serious appearance as he nodded his head. “It’s actually hilarious.”

In the next instant, maniacal laughter left his lips again as his body shook uncontrollably.

The little cow felt her head expanding, and a wave of irritation swept across her heart. “F*ck you!” She charged towards the King of Darkness as lightning surrounded her body.

The King of Darkness dodged and exclaimed in shock, “Hey Xiaoniu, are we fighting for real?! Hahaha! I’m afraid you’re no match for me!” As soon as the words left his lips, his palms swept outwards as he sent a boundless sea of darkness energy towards the little cow.

Boom!

The palace started to shake as a deafening explosion echoed through the air.

When the two overlords slammed into each other, Huang Xiaolong knew that things were definitely getting out of hand.

He hastily ran out of the palace as he wiped the sweat on his forehead.

As soon as he left the palace, he was greeted with a loud blast behind him as the palace turned into a pile of dust and rubble. Even though the palace was made from the metal essence from Hell song with dark gold, there was no way for it to withstand the strength of two mid-level Sovereigns going all out.

Even after the palace crumbled, the King of Darkness and the little cow didn’t let up as they slammed into each other once again.

After several repetitions, the King of Darkness was finally sent flying into the ground by the little cow’s horn. A massive crater appeared in the earth as the little cow’s laughter resounded in the air, “How’s that, Old Black?! Don’t you feel refreshed?!”

The King of Darkness burst out from the earth as a suffocating black glow surrounded his body. He shook off all the dirt on his body as he glared at the little cow, “This body of mine is new, and I haven’t gotten used to it yet. My godhead isn’t even recovered! How else could you have injured me...?”

He was right. Even though the little cow was strong, it wouldn’t be easy for her to injure the King of Darkness. With the Heart of Darkness, he could close the gap in strength between the two of them.

The little cow snickered under her breath. “Do you really think that I’m fully recovered? My body is new too. I barely managed to restore my divine soul not too long ago.”

Huang Xiaolong appeared between them suddenly, and he chided, “Enough! Stop messing around. We have other things to do.”

This time, Huang Xiaolong had returned to the Divine World with a purpose in mind.

The two Sovereigns stared at each other before finally standing down.

“Let’s go! We’re going to the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix Palace!” Huang Xiaolong turned and flew away. He had stayed in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield for far too long. He needed to hasten his trip in case anything unexpected happened in the Radiance World.

Refining the Lotus of Darkness took him more than eleven years.

Despite his long period of disappearance, the Reverence Moon Old Man and his master, the King of Grandmist didn’t come looking for him. It seemed as though the situation in the Radiance World was still under control.

After leaving the Ghost Pool, Huang Xiaolong rode on the little cow as they made their way to the Nine Colored Divine Phoenix Palace. The King of Darkness followed behind them.

Blacklight revolved around the King of Darkness’ body. If there were other Sovereign Realm experts around, they would see that the King of Darkness was condensing his godhead with the darkness energy in the surroundings.

Normally, it would be impossible to form another godhead after one’s original godhead was shattered. However, the King of Darkness had the Heart of Darkness. It was nothing for him to reform his godhead if he could preserve his soul from dissipating after several billion years.

With the Heart of Darkness and his original soul, it was a matter of time before he condensed his original godhead.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong asked about the King of Darkness’s current situation. He wanted to know how long it would take before he could return to his peak strength. However, the little cow butted in and interrupted him, “In the past, Shi Ming managed to obtain a piece of Darkness Divine Stone. If you manage to find it, Old Black will be able to return to his peak state very quickly. It’s too bad Shi Ming might be holding on to it himself. It’s also possible that he left it in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury.”

A brilliant light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Since there is a chance, we shall head over to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe after I unify the Radiance World!” He had long since wanted to make a trip over to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. In the future, he would take the chance while Shi Ming was refining the Blade of Death to exterminate the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

The King of Darkness shook his head and explained, “Even if you manage to obtain the Darkness Divine Stone, it will only cut down the time it takes for me to recover. Even if I get my hands on it, it will take me several thousand years before returning to my peak state. Unless I manage to get my hands on darkness attributed treasures like the Lotus of Darkness, I won’t be able to recover in a short period of time. With treasures at that level, it might take me several tens of years at most to restore my strength.”

“Actually, there is another method! The Blood of Darkness works too!”

“Blood of Darkness?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the King of Shadows with a curious expression.

The little cow interrupted and explained, “The Blood of Darkness is the supreme treasure of the World of Darkness. It’s said that a single drop of blood would form every ten billion years. If anyone with a darkness attributed godhead swallows a drop of it, they can bring themselves back from the brink of death. Anyway, it’s nowhere close to the Lotus of Darkness. The Blood of Darkness is only useful in healing injuries.”

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “A single drop every ten billion years?”

“There is a Divine Tree of Darkness in the World of Darkness. It’s the top-ranked divine tree in the World of Darkness. Its roots are located in the World of Darkness’s depths, and it absorbs darkness energy directly from the origin. Every ten billion years, a single drop of blood would be produced, and a single fruit would be born. It’s called the Darkness Gold Fruit.”

“If the Blood of Darkness is good for treating injuries, what is the fruit good for?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Even though the Darkness Gold Fruit cannot be compared to the Lotus of Darkness, it’s still a level two origin treasure.” The King of Darkness explained, “It’s a priceless treasure to anyone who has a darkness attributed godhead. To any cultivator at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, it’s a chance at breaking through to the Sovereign Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong stared at them in shock. Wouldn’t that mean that the Darkness Gold Fruit had the same effects as the Three Lives Flower?

“The last time the tree produced the Blood of Darkness and the Darkness Gold Fruit was over nine billion years ago.” The little cow racked her brains and replied, “In fact, there are a hundred years before it will produce it again. Every time the Blood of Darkness and Darkness Gold Fruit is born, rivers of blood will fill the galaxies. In the past, members of the City of All-Heavens came over to fight over it! This time, I’m afraid they will be present once again!”

City of All-Heavens!

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils shrank.

“That’s right. The City of All-Heavens...” The King of Darkness sucked in a cold breath as a complicated expression appeared on his face. It seemed as though he was brought back to the past.

So many years had passed...

I wonder if she’s still doing alright...

A trace of pain flashed through the King of Darkness’s eyes as he remembered someone from his past.
