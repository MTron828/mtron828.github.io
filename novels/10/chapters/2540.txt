Chapter 2541: It’s Huang Xiaolong!

After Li Chen’s holy soul imprint was utterly shattered, all of the Devil Palace’s members from top to bottom celebrated his demise. The celebration continued till the next day, and it was livelier than ever. The wine and laughter were endless.

Suddenly, one of the celebrating Devil Palace’s Palace Master had a dazed expression on his face as he turned to look at the holy spiritual stone containing Xie Bufan’s holy soul imprint.

The holy spiritual stone with Xie Bufan’s soul imprint that originally shone with glimmering radiance was dimming at a rapid speed.

Before long, other Devil Palace’s Hall Masters, Vice-Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders, as well as Cao Nan also noticed this matter.

The great hall that was buoyant with festive air just a moment ago was blanketed by an abrupt, heavy silence. Arms raising wine-filled cups for a toast frozen in midair. Whereas, those gnawing on spiritual fruit choked on the fruit in their throats, forgetting to swallow.

All the Devil Palace’s experts were wide-eyed and frozen on the spot. Their hearts constricted and chests tightened. Subconsciously, each of them was afraid that if they dared to inhale or exhale, Xie Bufan’s soul imprint would dim faster.

Unfortunately, despite not daring to move their ass by a millimeter, or even swallowing their saliva regardless of the dry, itchy feeling in their throats, the light of Xie Bufan’s soul imprint continued to dim.

As he watched Xie Bufan’s soul imprint flicker unsteadily akin to a candlelight in a stormy night, threatening to go off the moment he looked away, Cao Nan rose from his seat abruptly, and shouted at the top of his lungs, “What the hell is going on? Which motherf*cker can tell me what the hell is going on?! How come it’s like this! Why?!”

“Ahhh —!!!” Cao Nan let out an anguished roar.

His roar shook the great hall, raising specks of dust in the air.

Apprehension gripped the hearts of Devil Palace’s experts, and no one dared to make a sound, but each of them could see their own fear and worries mirrored in the faces of their companions close to them. They reflected bewilderment, confusion, and shock.

Judging from the current situation, Xie Bufan’s soul imprint was surely on the edge of collapsing. Xie Bufan, their Devil Palace’s chief Devil’s Son, was going to die?!

But… didn’t Xie Bufan obtain Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance earlier? Didn’t he kill Li Chen?

His Highness Xie Bufan should be accepting Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance right now!

Or could it be that Xie Bufan suffered from some sort of backlash when accepting Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance?

Though a backlash rarely occurs when accepting an inheritance, the chances of it happening was not absolutely nil.

In a split second, various possibilities raced through the minds of these Devil Palace’s experts.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong, it must be Huang Xiaolong that son of a b*tch!” Suddenly, Cao Nan spat through gritted teeth. His eyes were bloodshot as killing intent surged from every pore of his body.

When Xiao Lengxue had died, followed by Dou Rui, and then Su Biqing, Cao Nan hadn’t even batted an eyelid. But this time, his eyes were bloodshot with fury and violent killing intent in an instant, as if they were dyed with blood!

But they were talking about Xie Bufan! He was the most talented disciple amongst the Devil Palace’s young generation of geniuses—the disciple on whom the three Palace Masters, Qiao Jinyang, Cao Nan, and Gu Tian, placed all their hopes, and the disciple on whom the three of them had spent countless resources and effort to nurture!

Not to mention, Cao Nan practically regarded Xie Bufan as his son.

Heart-piercing pain! This was what Cao Nan was experiencing right now.

“…It’s Huang Xiaolong??!!” Some Devil Palace’s experts repeated in disbelief.

Among the various possibilities that crossed these Devil Palace experts’ minds, none of them connected the matter with Huang Xiaolong.

Subconsciously, they still thought that it could not be Huang Xiaolong, and it was absolutely impossible that it could be Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right, it’s Huang Xiaolong that b*stard!” Cao Nan’s eyes glowed red, “It’s definitely him. He killed Li Chen. It’s him who got the Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance! We were wrong this entire time. No one thought it would be him, but we’ve really underestimated that b*stard!”

The Devil Palace’s experts looked at their companions in astonishment, was it really so?

If the perpetrator was really Huang Xiaolong, then how terrifying was the potential of his talent? How strong exactly was he now? At the very least, certainly, no Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm expert can harm His Highness Xie Bufan that holds the Fiend Moon Blade… right?

Yet, His Highness Xie Bufan is? Even Li Chen too…?!

Right at this time, crisp crumbling noises rang through the great hall. The holy spiritual stone with Xie Bufan’s soul imprint cracked to pieces, and the elegant phantom image of Xie Bufan dimmed, and disappeared completely from the world.

“Bufan!” Cao Nan cried out in grief, as hatred and sorrow etched on his face.

Great sorrow gripped at everyone’s heart.

The feeling that they had lost something significantly important hit them, as if their hearts were emptied out.

The great hall was blanketed with dead silence until sonorous laughter broke the atmosphere as Tyrant Chu walked in with a group of Holy Heavens’ experts. Tyrant Chu laughed as he met with Cao Nan’s murderous gaze, “Cao Nan, congrats, congrats to you ah. Your disciple Xie Bufan first got the Cangqiong Blade, then Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance, becoming Old Man Cangqiong’s successor.”

Cao Nan and all the Devil Palace’s experts’ expressions turned ugly. This Tyrant Chu definitely came here to congratulate after knowing Xie Bufan’s soul imprint had shattered. Coming to congratulate at this time was literally stabbing another knife into Cao Nan’s pained heart!

“Tyrant Chu, you—!” Cao Nan glared furiously at Tyrant Chu.

Tyrant Chu let out another bout of sonorous laughter, and said, “The Devil Palace is holding a celebration banquet, I originally wanted to attend, but I was busy yesterday. I came uninvited today, don’t take offense, ah.”

Cao Nan’s face darkened further, and his voice was cold, “Tyrant Chu, don’t feel so complacent, your Holy Heavens’ chief disciple Li Chen is dead as well!” He chuckled maliciously, letting Tyrant Chu savor his next words, “Li Chen was probably killed by Huang Xiaolong as well. I am waiting to see how you are going to punish Huang Xiaolong when he comes out! Huang Xiaolong killed the Holy Heavens’ chief Holy Prince. If you do not handle this matter according to the Holy Heavens’ rules, I think all the Holy Heavens’ disciples would rebel from dissatisfaction!”

Tyrant Chu was stunned for a split second then laughed loudly, “That is our Holy Heavens’ internal affair, so there is no need to trouble yourself about it. Oh right, I will be holding a celebration banquet later, you must be free right? Why don’t you head over with me and have a few drinks?”

“Not everyone has a chance to taste my wine.”

Cao Nan was beyond indignant, and his gaze was as cold as it could be. “Tyrant Chu, I advise you not to celebrate so early, who knows for sure if it is really Huang Xiaolong who has gotten Old Man Cangqiong’s inheritance.”

Tyrant Chu snickered upon hearing Cao Nan’s words that were no different than a fart. Three people entered the Cangqiong Holy Manor. Both Li Chen and Xie Bufan had fallen, and the only person remaining was Huang Xiaolong. Hence, the result still couldn’t be determined at this point?

Tyrant Chu and Holy Heavens’ experts swaggered away with beaming faces a while later.

Cao Nan’s fist clenched till his fingers dug into his palms, as he wanted to kill, but he suppressed it with much effort. After all, they were not in their own territory. Attacking aggressively at the Cangqiong Dao Palace was like stepping over Old Man Cangqiong’s bottom line.

At this time, the Clear Snow Palace also heard about Xie Bufan’s soul imprint’s destruction, and the three beauties had a strange expression on their faces.

In the end, it was Huang Xiaolong!

Tan Juan didn’t say a word, while a plethora of words were racing through Ji Xinyi’s head. On the other hand, Lin Xiaoying was dumbfounded.

“Master, that Thirteen, is he going to become my Martial Uncle in the future?” Lin Xiaoying suddenly turned and asked Xue Lingyun.

Xue Lingyun had yet to recover after hearing the news.

Inside the Cangqiong Holy Manor, after refining both Li Chen and Xie Bufan’s holy souls, Huang Xiaolong walked towards the left side of the hall. His hand reached into the air and grabbed, and a blade flew out from the void into Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

Cangqiong Blade!

There were some similarities between the Cangqiong Blade and Fiend Moon Blade. However, the Cangqiong Blade was slightly longer and the blade tip curved upwards. Its body reflected a chilling coldness.

Then, Huang Xiaolong went to collect the Cangqiong Holy Pills.

When all these tasks were done, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to leave just yet. Hence, he stayed inside the Cangqiong Holy Manor to refine the two doa artifacts, the Cangqiong Blade and Eight-Side Desolate Beast Ring.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
