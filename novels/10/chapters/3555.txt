Chapter 3556 – Garbage Rules

Feng Tianquan didn’t see the message from the Creation Palace, and he didn’t know that Kai Dong and fifteen other experts had gone missing.

When Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin heard him, they roared at him in shock, “Shut up!”

They panicked and failed to suppress their voice. The soundwave that erupted scared Feng Tianquan and the rest.

With his mouth agape, Feng Tianquan looked at the two of them with a wronged expression on his face.

Casually turning to glance at Feng Tianquan, Huang Xiaolong decided against taking action as the allure of the cosmos sphere was too d*mn great! He continued to fly in the direction of the treasure.

In the blink of an eye, he disappeared from the sights of the group.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had left, Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin heaved a sigh of relief.

“Lord Tao Shi, this…” Feng Tianquan couldn’t help but ask.

Hesitating for a moment, Tao Shi eventually decided to show Feng Tianquan the message from the Creation Palace. “Huang Xiaolong isn’t someone you can afford to offend. In the future, steer clear of him.”

Feng Tianquan snorted in contempt when he scanned through the message. “Lord Tao Shi, are you seriously going to believe that Huang Xiaolong has three half step Universe Gods protecting him?”

Tao Shi’s expression sank when he saw that Feng Tianquan was still taking it as a joke. “If you anger Huang Xiaolong in the future, you better not blame me for not backing you up!”

Tao Shi left no room for arguments.

After all, if Feng Tianquan were to offend Huang Xiaolong, Tao Shi would be dragged into it regardless.

Feng Tianquan’s face finally changed.

“Lord Tao Shi, Huang Xiaolong… Should we follow him?” Qian Shaolin asked.

“Alright.” Tao Shi decided after a short moment of contemplation. He flew in the direction Huang Xiaolong left without bothering with Feng Tianquan.

With his expression ugly to the extreme, Feng Tianquan’s hatred for Huang Xiaolong grew even stronger. In his eyes, Huang Xiaolong was the reason he was humiliated by Tao Shi. When he thought about the look in Wang Meiqi’s eyes when she looked at him, rage filled his heart.

‘Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck do you think you are? The only reason behind your arrogance is the Star Dragon Couple! Humph. You’re just a God of Creation at the large completion stage. You’re not fit to stay by Wang Meiqi’s side!’ Feng Tianquan growled in his mind as he followed behind Tao Shi.

Huang Xiaolong’s group soared through the air and they passed mountain ranges after mountain ranges in an instant. Wang Meiqi and the rest were curious about his intentions, but they could only follow silently behind.

After flying for half an hour, Huang Xiaolong stopped above a patch of barren land. Descending slowly, he walked slowly in a certain direction. The three of them saw a piece of golden scale emerging from Huang Xiaolong’s body and a look of excitement formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Wang Meiqi and the rest were shocked. They don’t recall Huang Xiaolong ever looking so elated. What in the world was going on?

Tao Shi and the rest had arrived, and they were equally as stunned to see the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Their gazes slowly went to the golden scale hovering in the air before him.

When they saw the runes on the scale, Tao Shi felt a bolt of lightning running through his mind. Was that…

He rushed towards the golden scale without a care in the world. It was as though Huang Xiaolong didn’t exist!

It was too bad he was sent back by a terrifying blast of energy. Tao Shi stared at Ao Shenghai in shock.

“Lord Tao Shi!” Qian Shaolin and the rest surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s group instantly.

Sucking in a cold breath, Tao Shi spoke to Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, as long as you are willing to give me the scale, I’ll agree to any request you have!”

Huang Xiaolong turned around and looked at Tao Shi like the other party was a clown. “I found this treasure by myself. Who do you think you are to ask me to hand it over?”

Since he located the cosmos sphere, there was no longer a point in hiding his strength.

When an expert behind Tao Shi heard what Huang Xiaolong said, he roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far! How dare you speak to Lord Tao Shi in this manner?!”

Feng Tianquan couldn’t give up such a good opportunity to clash with Huang Xiaolong and he sneered in disgust, “Huang Xiaolong, kneel and apologize to Lord Tao Shi immediately!”

“Kneel to apologize?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually before grabbing Feng Tianquan through the void. He grabbed the man by the neck, and he squeezed down tightly. Feng Tianquan’s eyes bulged as sounds of bone snapping came from his neck.

Everyone gasped in fright.

Tao Shi and Qian Shaolin frowned as they didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so strong.

From their estimations, Huang Xiaolong probably had several mysterious experts protecting him in the dark. They didn’t think that he would be strong enough to deal with an expert at Feng Tianquan’s level by himself.

After all, Feng Tianquan was at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. He was but a mere chicken in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. If that was the case, wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong was at the peak of the grand completion stage?! Even if he wasn’t, he definitely had more than 8 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Failing around in rage and confusion, Feng Tianquan didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so strong! He tried to compose himself as he roared with rage, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you move against me before Lord Tao Shi?! Are you ignoring the rules of the alliance?! Release me immediately!”

He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would go too far.

“Rules of the alliance?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Those rules don’t mean a thing to me.”

A surge of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s arms the next instant and he crushed Feng Tianquan’s neck. “I didn’t bother arguing with you all these years because of Wang Meiqi. Oh, another reason behind my nonchalance was because you’re nothing but an annoying piece of sh*t that isn’t worth my attention. Do you really think that I’m afraid of you?”

He turned the rest of Feng Tianquan’s head into a puddle of blood after he spoke.

“Huang Xiaolong!” A God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage yelled as he tried to stop Huang Xiaolong. However, Tao Shi held him back.

After Huang Xiaolong was done crushing Feng Tianquan’s physical body, he tossed his dao soul into the Sun Moon Furnace.

There was a reason a God of Creation was said to be immortal. They shared the same lifespan as the universe, but nothing was absolute. With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, exterminating the physical body of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage was nothing.

“You… You’re definitely at the large completion stage! How can you…” Tao Shi stuttered. Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong revealed his true strength.

11 billion units of grand cosmos energy emerged from his body instantly as it filled the space around them. Tao Shi and the others were sent tumbling backwards.

When they finally stabilized themselves, Tao Shi realized something extremely important! He knew how Kai Dong disappeared, and he knew why there weren't any signs of battle! Huang Xiaolong was too freaking strong! He dealt with them quickly and cleaned up the battlefield before the members of the Eternal Heaven Alliance arrived!

There had never been any hidden experts around Huang Xiaolong! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He was the one who resolved all the problems that came his way!
