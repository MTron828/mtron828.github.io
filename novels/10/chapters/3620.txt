Chapter 3621 – Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce

When everyone was still stuck in a state of terror, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Kong Lei and Qian Jun.

The entire hall had already gotten to their knees.

When Kong Lei and Qian Jun saw Huang Xiaolong approaching them, their bodies trembled like leaves in the wind. It was especially so for Qian Jun who tried to make a move on Huang Xiaolong. He might be the vice director of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, but no one could be sure that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t kill him right then and there!

When he finally arrived before the two, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “I’ll take all the universe-level spiritual veins you have. I’ll take the one he had his eyes on too. Director Kong Lei, do you have a problem with that?”

Glancing at Cao Ze from the corner of his eye, Kong Lei started to hesitate. Eventually, a smile formed on his face and he replied, “Of course! We have always been fair when it comes to making deals! Lord is an esteemed customer and we welcome you with open arms! Why would we have a problem?”

Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart. Fairness had always been dictated by those with the biggest fists. If he didn’t show off his strength, Kong Lei would never treat him as an equal.

If he didn’t reveal enough power, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce would have dealt with him without a care in the world.

Their trade went exceedingly smooth. With several dozen creation artifacts with one of them at the top-grade level, he managed to trade for more than a hundred and twenty universe-level spiritual veins.

He threw all of them into the Sun Moon Furnace instantly.

“Do you have a problem with me?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Cao Ze and laughed, “Kong Lei decided to sell me the spiritual vein you had your eyes on. Don’t look at me… You can talk to him if you like.”

Kong Lei’s expression changed instantly when the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. When he looked at Cao Ze, he noticed the unfriendly look in the man’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Yang Rong and Chen Hui who were rooted to their spot and he chuckled, “Do you want to come with us?”

With her heart thumping, Chen Hui waved her hand and muttered, “There… There’s no need.”

However, Yang Rong pulled Chen Hui back instantly and bowed towards Huang Xiaolong, “We’ll listen to whatever young master says.” She knew that if they didn’t leave with Huang Xiaolong right now, they would turn into Cao Ze’s targets when he left. If he chose to take his anger out on the two of them, not even their old ancestor would be able to save them.

As such, they followed behind Huang Xiaolong as they left the second floor.

The two ladies followed closely behind. Walking behind Huang Xiaolong, they didn’t dare to breathe loudly and their steps were light. They never thought that there would come a day when they would walk alongside one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land.

They didn’t dare to speak to Huang Xiaolong and neither did they dare to look at him.

After they arrived on the first floor, Huang Xiaolong found Gui Xiaoer.

“Did you buy what you need?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Nodding his head happily, Gui Xiaoer laughed, “Yes I did! Many thanks to Lord for bringing me in!” Even though he was curious about the three new figures standing behind Huang Xiaolong, he didn't think too much into it.

“Alright. Let’s go.”

Gui Xiaoer nodded.

Soon after, they left the plaza.

When they emerged, Gui Xiaoer frowned. “There was a God of Creation who made a move on the second floor… I wonder who it was. They have to be crazy!”

The entire plaza felt the exchange when Rong Hua sent the members of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce flying.

“Oh? It was a group of them. And they didn’t just fight on the second level. They fought in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce.” A crafty light twinkled in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and he explained.

“Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?!” Gui Xiaoer exclaimed in shock.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “Yeah. Vice director Qian Jun and one of Cao Ze’s guards was taught a lesson!”

“Cao… Cao Ze?!” Guo Xiaoer felt his legs going soft when he heard the name. “Are you talking about Cao Ze from the Cao Family in the Limitless City?! Is there anyone crazy enough to teach him a lesson? Could it be Lord Wu Qifeng?”

They even dealt with Qian Jun of the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce…

No matter who it was, they were gods in the eyes of Gui Xiaoer. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“That’s the one.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Oh. I was the one who taught them a lesson.”

Gui Xiaoer stopped dead in his tracks and he stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. “Lord, you shouldn’t joke about things like that.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

Yang Rong and Chen Hui nearly squeaked when they heard what he said. They lowered their heads even more.

After walking a little further, Gui Xiaoer cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong and spoke, “Lord, I guess we’ll part ways here. I need to return to my family.” Now that he obtained the Ice Dragon Bone, he wanted nothing more than to return to solve his problem.

He bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong with a grateful expression plastered on his face. “Gui Xiaoer will definitely remember the Lord's grace. If you have time in the future, you can look for me in Huazhou City.”

The Gui Family was a third rate family in the Limitless Land and there was no way they could find a residence in the Limitless City. Huazhou City was quite a distance away from the celestial empire.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Gui Xiaoer turned to leave after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s reply.

“That kid is pretty good…” Huang Xiaolong remarked as he looked at Gui Xiaoer’s leaving figure.

His sincere personality was only one of the reasons behind Huang Xiaolong’s praise. His talent was top notch, but it was a pity he came from a small family. If he were born in a super family and was given endless resources, he would be able to enjoy a life of glory.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others returned to the Ice Manor, the events that happened in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce started to spread through the city.

The entire city trembled.

“The person who taught them a lesson is a youngster who calls himself the Blue Dragon Young Master! It’s said that Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua are his subordinates! When the three of them appeared beside him in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce, Kong Lei, Qian Jun, and Cao Ze were struck speechless!”

“What?! Why would the three of them surrender to the young man?! Who in the world is he?! Is he some supreme expert who came out of nowhere?!”

“The Blue Dragon Young Master used dozens of creation artifacts to obtain all the universe-level spiritual veins in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce. The reason behind Cao Ze’s beef with him started from a fire dragon attributed top-grade universe-level spiritual vein!”

“Yeah! When Lord Zhou Chi and the others arrived, Cao Ze didn’t even dare to breathe loudly!”

When the rumors were going around, Cao Ze was standing in the main hall of the Cao Family Manor with his head hung low. He was like a kid who was wronged.
