Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in the air, ten meters above the Demon God Blood Pool, and then took out the two grandmist aura rivers.

The two streams of grandmist auras resembled two small rivers. Neither of the grandmist aura ran away after coming out from the spatial container; instead, they danced excitedly around Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled good-naturedly watching this familiar scene. The intimate reactions of the two grandmist aura rivers did not surprise him. When he and Senior Brother Jiang Hong had found the grandmist aura and purple grandmist aura in the Barbarians Space, both the grandmist aura and purple grandmist aura had also felt close to him.

Even Senior Brother Jiang Hong had complained enviously that even he, as the senior brother, was not as popular as Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong adjusted his condition, then began circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. The two grandmist aura rivers reacted immediately, drilling into Huang Xiaolong’s body one after another through his palm.

The two grandmist aura rivers appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind upon entering his body.

As Huang Xiaolong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, his three supreme godheads absorbed the grandmist energy waves from the two grandmist aura rivers.

Huang Xiaolong was completely enshrouded in resplendent lights.

At the same time, at the bottom of the Demon God Blood Pool, slivers of golden-colored blood qi rose to the surface and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body.

As these slivers of golden blood qi continuously entered Huang Xiaolong’s body, the three powerful and mysterious archdevils’ bloodlines inside his body gradually awakened.

It was akin to a mighty fierce beast that had been in slumber for numerous millenniums. Once it awakened, it would shake the thirty-three skies.

The days turned into months.

Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded with a cocoon of bright dazzling lights. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As the three powerful and mysterious archdevil bloodlines within Huang Xiaolong’s body awakened, the lights enshrouding Huang Xiaolong flickered between three dazzling colors.

Three dazzling lights intensified with time as if something was brewing within.

Huang Xiaolong was concentrating on refining the two grandmist aura rivers, and trying to awaken his archdevils bloodlines by borrowing the Demon God Blood Pool’s energy. At this time, in the Spirits World’s Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters, Shi Wushuang was raging with killing intent as he spoke to Shi Ming, “Old Ancestor, I am certain that Yu’er was killed by that bast*rd Duwei! Send the army. We’ll attack the Mohe Plane, and kill Duwei, Tai Yue, and all of them!”

“Moreover, only by killing Duwei can we unify Hell without any impediment!”

Shi Ming’s eyes glimmered.

“That’s right, Old Ancestor, we cannot endure any more! Gather the army to attack the Mohe Plane! Kill them till they flee with their tails between their legs!”

Some of the present Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors clamored with a fervor.

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s defeat at the Nethersea was like a fishbone stuck in their throats ever since, and now, Shi Yinyu’s death had lit up the fury fermenting in their hearts.

Shi Ming raised a hand to silence all of them.

“Duwei, must be killed, but now is not the time.” Shi Ming went on calmly, “Since he dared expose the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters, there must be a reason for his confidence. The Netherworld King’s Organisation’s headquarters is likely to be protected by grand array formations laid out by the last Lord of Hell.”

Although his cultivation had continued to improve in these years, Shi Ming still wasn’t very confident about breaking the last Lord of Hell’s array formations.

Upon hearing the mention of ‘Lord of Hell,’ everyone shut up. Even Shi Wushuang fell silent.

The Lord of Hell was an existence who had ruled over Hell for countless billions of years, even though the Lord of Hell was no longer there, just the mention of him was enough to deter many.

“Therefore, before we successfully forge the Blade of Death, let Duwei, that clown, jump a while longer.” Shi Ming added, “Once Blade of Death’s forging is completed successfully, we’ll attack the Mohe Plane, destroy the Netherworld King’s Organisation, and unify Hell!”

“Then, our army will march to the Divine World, and attack the Heavenly Court! We will rule over the universe!”

Shi Ming’s cold voice echoed, reverberating in the great hall.

The Blade of Death was the grandmist treasure artifact that they were currently forging.

In truth, Shi Ming had been making preparations to forge the Blade of Death since their Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had lost the inheritance treasure, the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, in the battle against the Ancient Heavenly Court.

He had been forging the Blade of Death for several billion years, consuming countless grandmist spirit stones, iron ores, and many other precious materials. Now, they were finishing the last few segments, and they would be successful.

The time they would succeed was when the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe would sweep over other forces and rule the universe.

It was also the time when Duwei would die!

Those who had dared to go against the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, would become lost souls under the Blade of Death.

Thus, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe swallowed their anger this time.

The experts of Hell’s three worlds were shocked because the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had choosen to endure silently even after their Young Lord Shi Yinyu had been killed. Rumors began flying around, and many mocked the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe behind their backs.

After this incident, the number of forces that chose to submit under the Netherworld King’s Organisation increased. Thus, the number of Emperor Realm experts in the Netherworld King’s Organisation also increased.

One year turned into two.

In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.

Huang Xiaolong, who had been cultivating at the Demon God Blood Pool during these three years, had advanced to the peak late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. Just half a step more, and he would break through to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Once he broke through to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t need to rely solely on the City of Eternity and the Heavenly Hall, as he would be able kill a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch on his own. With that there wouldn’t be many opponents under the Emperor Realm for him!

Sitting cross-legged in the air, above the Demon God Blood Pool, a faint layer of golden blood mist gathered around Huang Xiaolong.

And the flickering tri-colored lights enshrouding his body expanded over a hundred li radius, vaguely showing three massive shadows.

These three shadows not only exuded the power of God but also the power of the Devil.

Devil and God in co-existence!

As time passed five years went by.

Huang Xiaolong was completely covered by the golden blood mist.

The whole Demon God Blood Pool was dominated by these three glaring lights that had reached a thousand li radius. The three vague shadows had become more apparent and condensed. There was a golden, an ink-black , and a myriad colors shadow. Each of these three shadows was several hundred li tall.

Suddenly, a muffled boom sounded from the inside of Huang Xiaolong’s body, louder than thunder, akin to an archdevil awakening from slumber. The tri-colored lights swirled around Huang Xiaolong, his momentum soared, and the three shadows behind him solidified further.

This whole time Demon God Blood Pool was shaking, even the earth underneath was swaying in protest.

Tai Yue and the others waited outside the forbidden land. All of them were stunned for a second, detecting the changes within the forbidden land. Joy rose to their faces.

“His Majesty has broken through to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?!”

“What a strong momentum, powerful energy, and overbearing pressure! Some famous geniuses could not exude this degree of startling pressure even when breaking through to the Emperor Realm!”

“What are those three pressures?”

Tai Yue and the others were curious as well as astonished.

The forbidden land’s vigorous movements went on for four days and four nights before returning to calmness. The layer of golden blood mist around Huang Xiaolong disappeared, leaving only the three massive figures in the air behind him.

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, and there was joy in them. He had finally broken through to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm! On top of that, by borrowing the Demon God Blood Pool’s energy, he had successfully awakened three kinds of archdevils’ bloodline powers within his body!

With three kinds of archdevil bloodlines’ power awakened, his True Dragon Physique evolved further. Now, not only did he have the True Dragon Physique, but also three different archdevils’ physiques!

His physical body’s toughness had far surpassed the concept of heaven-defying.
