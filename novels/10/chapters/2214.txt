Chapter 2215: Are You An Idiot?

On the road towards the Radiance Chamber of Commerce, a loud scream came from behind him, and Huang Xiaolong turned around in shock.

Miserable shrieks soon echoed through the air

Chaos ensued.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and saw a man riding on a nameless divine beast, charging towards him. Guards followed behind him as they rode on Iron Rhinoceros Beasts.

As they thundered down the streets, they ran over pedestrians who reacted a little too slowly.

When everyone around Huang Xiaolong was busy dodging the beasts, he wasn’t flustered in the slightest. As the beasts brushed past him, his robes fluttered in the wind. Just a fraction of a foot closer and they would have run Huang Xiaolong over.

A frown quickly formed on Hung Xiaolong’s face.

“Who is that youngster? Is he crazy? How can he speed down the street on his divine beast? Isn’t he afraid of angering the Gujiao City’s enforcement team?” Someone along the street roared, complaining.

“Don’t you know who he is? Let me tell you, he’s the Radiance Chamber of Commerce’s young master, a dragon amongst men! Not only is his father Qin Yuan, the president of the Radiance Chamber of Commerce, but he is also the sworn brother of Custodian Weng Siqi of the Big Dipper Sword Sect! Who would dare to apprehend him?” Someone else shook his head and explained.

“What? That’s Qin Shaolong?! Qin Shaolong of the three geniuses in our Jinyuan Kingdom?!”

“That’s right! Alongside Princess Zhang Wenyue from the Prince Qian Manor, and Young Prince Dong Zeyu from the Prince Long Manor, Qin Shaolong is the third genius! He is said to be more talented than the other two, and he has the highest chance of entering the Big Dipper Sword Sect!”

“With his relationship with Custodian Weng Siqi from the Big Dipper Sword Sect and his natural talent, there is no way for him to be rejected! The moment he enters the sect, Weng Siqi would accept him as a personal disciple! It can be said that he’ll reach the heavens with a single step!”

Discussions broke out immediately on the streets.

Huang Xiaolong was startled.

Radiance Chamber of Commerce’s young master, Qin Shaolong? Qin Yuan’s son?

A cold smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he walked towards the Radiance Chamber of Commerce.

When Qin Shaolong arrived at the headquarters of the Radiance Chamber of Commerce, his father, Qin Yuan, was accompanying a silver-haired old man in the inner hall. The old man carried a sword on his back, and his blade seemed to be shrouded in starlight.

The silver-haired old man was precisely Custodian Weng Siqi from the Big Dipper Sword Sect.

Qin Yuan and Weng Siqi were engaged in happy conversation when Qin Shaolong returned.

“Brother Siqi, after Shaolong enters the Big Dipper Sword Sect, we will have to trouble you...,” Qin Yuan smiled when the words left his mouth.

Weng Siqi waved his hand in response, “Brother Qin Yuan, you’re too modest. With Shaolong’s talent, it won’t be difficult for him to enter the Big Dipper Sword Sect. The moment I accept him as my personal disciple, his status in the sect will rise higher than ordinary disciples!”

“Many thanks to Brother Siqi!” He then took out a jade box, and continued, “I know that Brother Siqi is cultivating the Seven Sword Art and is in need of sword spirits. I managed to obtain this sword spirit for you.”

Weng Siqi quickly accepted the box and the moment he opened it, brilliant sword light blinded those present in the hall. A wave of threatening sword qi emerged.

There was a tiny sword lying in the jade box, and its body was infused with starlight.

“Innate Celestial Body Sword Spirit?” Weng Siqi’s eyes brightened.

Qin Yuan nodded his head and smiled, “That’s right. This Innate Celestial Body Sword Spirit is more than a billion years old and the sword qi it contains is extremely fierce. As long as Brother Siqi refines it, your strength will skyrocket!”

Weng Siqi smiled, “Since Brother Qin Yuan is so considerate, I will accept this Innate Celestial Body Sword Spirit!” He no longer stood on ceremony as he kept the jade box in his spatial divine artifact.

When he kept the box away, Qin Shaolong entered the hall.

“Greetings, Uncle Weng!” Qin Shaolong greeted when he saw his father’s sworn brother present in the hall.

Weng Siqi nodded his head in approval as he looked at Qin Shaolong, “Nephew Shaolong is indeed worthy of being the top genius in the Jinyuan Kingdom. I haven’t seen you in several decades and you managed to enter the Heavenly Monarch Realm!”

“Shaolong’s bone age should only be around twelve thousand years, right?” Weng Siqi turned around and asked Qin Yuan.

Qin Yuan smiled, “Yes, to be precise, it’s twelve thousand one hundred and twenty years old.” One could easily hear the excitement in his voice. After all, it was extremely rare for anyone to enter the Heavenly Monarch Realm in a mere twelve thousand years.

He then said to Qin Shaolong, “Long’er, after you enter the Big Dipper Sword Sect, you must address Uncle Weng as your master!”

Qin Shaolong nodded his head, stepped forward, and said respectfully: "Shaolong pays respect to master!"

Weng Siqi laughed loudly and helped him up.

According to them, Qin Shaolong couldn’t fail Big Dipper Sword Sect’s disciple selection.

As Weng Siqi was about to help Qin Shaolong up from the ground, the disciples who were guarding the entrance flew into the inner hall, kicking up a huge commotion.

The three of them couldn’t help but stare at each other with quizzical looks on their faces.

Under their shocked gazes, Huang Xiaolong sauntered into the hall.

Qin Shaolong looked at the disciples, who were rolling about in pain on the ground, and he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “You’re pretty courageous to barge into the Radiance Chamber of Commerce. How dare you make a move on our disciples?!”

An indifferent chuckle filled the hall. “You’re right. Courage is indeed something I do not lack. However, I’m not here to cause trouble... I’m here to kill!”

They couldn’t help but stare at him in shock.

“Earlier on the main streets, you almost knocked into me,” Huang Xiaolong said to Qin Shaolong.

Qin Yuan waved his hands to the guards and ordered, “Give him a hundred holy bills and throw him out!”

In the past, Qin Shaolong was no stranger to knocking into people on the streets. There were some experts, who would attempt to reason with them and Qin Yuan would send them away after throwing some holy bills at them. The situation that was playing out wasn’t uncommon at all.

“Father, this person injured the disciples of our Chamber of Commerce. How can we let him go so easily?”

Qin Yuan ignored his son as he barked at the guards behind him. “Give it to him!”

He could easily see that Huang Xiaolong was no simple character. Instead of creating more trouble, the best way was to send him away with some money. After all, those who dared to cause trouble in the Radiance Chamber of Commerce definitely had some sort of backing.

Following his command, a guard retrieved a holy bill representing a hundred holy bills and tossed it towards Huang Xiaolong’s feet. “Pick it up and scram!”

A devilish smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’ face when he saw the bill at his feet. “I’m afraid hundred holy bills aren’t enough.”

Qin Yuan couldn’t help but frown.

Weng Siqi, who had kept quiet the whole time finally opened his mouth to ‘advice’ Huang Xiaolong, “Young man, you must know when to advance and when to retreat. Otherwise, you won’t be able to live to regret it.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A soft chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “How about this, I won’t ask for too much. Just give me the keys to the treasury of the Radiance Chamber of Commerce, and I’ll leave.”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Qin Shaolong was the first to regain his wits as he roared with laughter, “Brat, are you sure that your brain isn’t filled with water? Did you turn into an idiot after I bumped into you on the streets?!”
