Chapter 3626 – The End of the Island

Everything seemed normal when he looked at the plains from outside, but everything changed the moment he entered. Waves of green light emerged from the plains like an endless tide.

The green light was much more intense than anything that could be seen in the Bewilderment Island.

It was too bad the green light never managed to reach Huang Xiaolong as it was stopped by the veil of star light that enveloped Huang Xiaolong. Tiny little stars twinkled around Huang Xiaolong, protecting him from everything.

After the green light failed to harm Huang Xiaolong, Death Locusts charged out from the plains and surrounded Huang Xiaolong. The leeches in the outer region of the island would attack their prey alone, but the Death Locusts weren’t as honorable as that. They would swarm their prey, overwhelming them with numbers.

Huang Xiaolong circulated his grand cosmos energy as he killed a path through the Death Locusts.

A storm of bugs flew towards Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to devour him whole. Those locusts that he killed seemed to respawn when they touched the grassy plains.

It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong noticed someone else in the plains. The person seemed to have been swallowed by the illusory formations as he was wandering aimlessly through the plains with Death Locusts stuck on to his body.

A huge part of those who entered would fall in the green plains just like the person before him.

Soaring over, Huang Xiaolong got rid of all the Death Locusts on his body. The expert he saved was a God of Creation at the small completion stage, and he seemed to have been trapped there for countless years. The essence blood in his body was sucked dry and he was as skinny as a stick.

With a wave of his hand, a ray of star dragon qi entered the expert’s glabella.

“This…” As soon as he awakened, he started to look around himself cautiously.

“This is the Bewilderment Island. We’re currently in the Death Locusts Plains, and you lost yourself to the illusions.” Huang Xiaolong explained.

After his reminder, the man felt his memories coming back.

“Did you save me?” With his gaze landing on Huang Xiaolong, the man widened his eyes in shock when he discovered the star dragon qi. “This… This is the Star Dragon Light?!”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong easily noticed his burning gaze.

Suppressing his greed, the other party cupped his fists to thank Huang Xiaolong. “Many thanks for saving me. Since fellow cultivator has the Star Dragon Divine Tree, I hope you can bring me out of the Death Locusts Plains. As long as you bring me out, I will be eternally grateful.”

“There’s no need to thank me. I am more than willing to bring you out. However, you’ll have to allow me to brand your soul and turn into my subordinate.”

“What?! Impossible!” The man roared with anger when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s suggestion.

Without saying anything else, Huang Xiaolong turned to leave.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong could have branded the man’s soul when he was still trapped in his illusions. He didn’t choose to do that.

Whatever the case, the man was merely a God of Creation at the small completion stage. It didn’t matter whether he agreed to serve Huang Xiaolong or not.

As such, Huang Xiaolong gave him a choice. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“You…” Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had turned away, a flash of greed appeared in his eyes. Light swirled in his palms as he lunged towards Huang Xiaolong.

As they were standing pretty close to begin with, he managed to land his strike.

A flash of joy filled his heart.

However, a terrifying wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body when the man was celebrating. He was sent flying in an instant, and by the time he landed, the bones in his hand had shattered into a thousand pieces.

Huang Xiaolong casually pointed at the man and a ray of Vermillion Bird Origin Fire swallowed him.

As he continued on his way, it didn’t take long before he ran into another God of Creation.

Similar to the previous expert, he was a God of Creation at the small completion stage.

This time, the man knew what was good for himself and submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Death Locust Plains. There were nearly seventy Gods of Creation Realm following him around. There were even several of them at the peak of the large completion stage!

Of course, the strongest among them was only at that level. The Death Locust Plains might contain terrifyingly strong formations, but they weren’t enough to trap a God of Creation at the grand completion stage.

Crossing the plains, Huang Xiaolong approached a world covered in flames.

Magma spewed into the air as golden colored flames emerged from time to time.

The occasional roars of beasts could be heard from time to time.

When some of the experts behind Huang Xiaolong heard the cries, their expressions changed.

That was the Flaming Mountain Range in the Bewilderment Island.

From what everyone who emerged from the island said, the Flaming Mountain Range located on the Bewilderment Island was the most dangerous one in the universe! It was dubbed the Incinerated Wasteland.

“All of you will have to follow closely behind me.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Yes, Lord!”

Before entering the Incinerated Wasteland, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Star Dragon Light. He summoned the four Universe Origin Flames and the heat around them instantly lessened.

Everyone followed behind Huang Xiaolong as they entered the fiery region.

Stepping in the space above the mountain range, Huang Xiaolong could feel the terrifying heat rolling off the mountain range despite the protection of the origin fires. Like all the other regions, there were formations all around the mountain range. However, they wouldn’t be activated if one didn’t step foot onto the mountain.

…

Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.

The entire group emerged from the Incinerated Wasteland without suffering much.

When they did, they were greeted with a lush forest.

“Looks like we’ve arrived in the Bewilderment Forest.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Lord, that’s right. This is the famous Bewilderment Forest that’s said to exist on the island.” One of the old experts reported.

In the past half a year, Huang Xiaolong saved nearly seven hundred other God of Creation Realm experts. The silver haired elder who spoke earlier was a half step Universe God. Even though he hadn’t broken through the 10 billion mark, his strength was comparable to Lin Qiankun. He came from the Zhu Lan Land and was an ancestor of one of the celestial empires. His name was Zheng Shen

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

The Bewilderment Forest was the final region he had to pass through.

Along the way, he failed to find the Three Gods Halberd. If the news Zhou Chi had was reliable, it could only be located in the forest.

However, the Bewilderment Forest was the most dangerous region on the island. Even leaders of various regions like the Limitless Master wouldn’t enter for fun.

In the past, the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race entered the Bewilderment Forest in order to look for something. They only emerged after working together.

“All of you can wait for me here. I’ll be out in a month at most.”

Zheng Shen and the others bowed respectfully.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong entered the forest.

The moment he did, the demonic trees around him started to move. They spun around him, twisting the space they were in. The spinning was so intense that Huang Xiaolong felt himself getting a little dizzy.
