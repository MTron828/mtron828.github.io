The Radiance Knight Corp and the army from the Radiance Divine City contained more than ninety percent of the Radiance World’s fighting force!

The might of the Radiance World was only second to the five Greater Worlds. One could only begin to imagine the strength of ninety percent of the Radiance World’s fighting strength.

If the Divine World were to gather ninety percent of all the Emperor Palaces and superpowers’ strength, it would be somewhat stronger than that of everyone on the battlefield of the Radiance World right now. Of course, there were existences of mega superpowers like the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Brightness Emperor Palace, or other ancient superpowers in the Divine World. However, the Radiance World wasn’t too far behind! How many trillions of experts would they be able to gather?!

It was a number no one could count.

As soon as the Radiance Knight Corp clashed with the Radiance Divine City’s troops, corpses littered the air.

As the corpses slammed into the world surfaces all around, mountains were flattened, and rivers overflowed—mountains of corpses formed around the various surfaces and cities.

Even the experts who were used to bloodshed sucked in a cold breath when they looked at the scene before them.

This was the battle to take over a world!

No one would be able to remain unaffected when they saw the massive battle happening before them.

There were also existences like the Reverence Moon Old Man, Cang Mutian, the King of Shadows taking part in the battle. It could be said that it was a battle of epic proportions!

Even the superpowers from the various worlds surrounding the Radiance World paid attention to the battle.

In the Heavenly Court’s main hall in the Divine World, Di Jun had long since gotten someone to open the Mysterious Transmission Mirror to watch the battle going down in the Radiance World in real-time. Many experts from the Heavenly Court had their eyes glued to the screen.

Not only had Di Jun sent over experts from the Heavenly Court to assist Dun Ei, but he had even sent ten billion Heavenly Soldiers over to boost Dun Ei’s military strength.

Of course, they had long since changed into the armors of members of the Radiance City, and they were currently embroiled in a battle with the Radiance Knight Corp.

It was too bad that the Radiance Knights had completely suppressed the Heavenly Soldiers from the Heavenly Court. Their casualty count rose quickly, and Di Jun’s expression sank deeper and deeper.

Even though ten billion Heavenly Soldiers were nothing to the Heavenly Court, they were part of the elites! He had used tons of resources in order to cultivate them to the level they were at currently!

“I never expected Huang Xiaolong to be able to convince that old freak from the Dragon Bear Race to help him...” Xiao Yi, who was standing behind Di Jun, spoke all of a sudden. A trace of worry appeared in his eyes. “The strength of the Reverence Moon Old Man is nothing to look down on either. He has become extremely terrifying...”

The Grand Marshals and Marshals present in the hall didn’t dare to breathe loudly.

Finally, Marshal Yu Shi broke the silence. “Even if the Reverence Moon Old Man possesses horrifying strength, it is impossible for Huang Xiaolong to take Radiance Divine City down. Dun Ei has the support of our Heavenly Court and the Fire World! Not to mention the Massacring Gods Gate... He won’t lose! Huang Xiaolong will definitely be defeated!”

Heavenly Emperor Di Jun stared at the screen, and he refused to open his mouth.

“Your Majesty, why don’t we send more troops over to assist them?” Xiao Yi turned to Di Jun and asked cautiously.

Whatever the case, the battle was extremely important to the Heavenly Court. If Huang Xiaolong really managed to bring Dun Ei down, the power he commanded would increase once again. It would be extremely likely that his spear would point to the Heavenly Court if he managed to take Radiance Divine City down.

When that happened, the Heavenly Court would no longer be able to stop Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right. Your Majesty, we should hurry up and send more troops over to Radiance Divine City!” Another Grand Marshal of the Heavenly Court piped up.

Before long, everyone in the hall voiced their agreement and persuaded Di Jun to send additional assistance to Dun Ei in the Radiance World.

A ruthless look flashed through Di Jun’s face, and a murderous look filled his eyes. “Alright. We shall send another three hundred billion elite soldiers! I refuse to believe that Huang Xiaolong will be able to unify the Radiance World!”

Three hundred billion elite Heavenly Soldiers!

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they saw Di Jun’s determination to stop Huang Xiaolong.

Even Xiao Yi was stunned. He was the person who had suggested sending reinforcement, but three hundred billion elite troops were out of his expectations. After all, they were talking about three hundred billion elites, not three hundred billion ordinary soldiers!

No matter how the outside world claimed that the Heavenly Court had trillions of elite troops, three hundred billion was no small amount!

Di Jun turned to stare at them with bloodshot eyes, and he growled, “Send a message to Dun Ei. If he fails to defeat Huang Xiaolong, he doesn’t need to wait around for Huang Xiaolong to execute him. I’ll do it myself!”

“Yes, Your Majesty!”

......

Back in the Radiance World, Huang Xiaolong sent out punches one after the other. Every time his fist landed, a Fourth Order Emperor from Radiance Divine City would explode into a mist of blood.

Beside him, there were one hundred Undead Race Netherguards, several dozen Ice Dragons, and twelve-winged angels. He killed his way around the battlefield without any resistance.

As Dun Ei stared at Huang Xiaolong, who was wantonly killing the Emperor Realm experts from his Radiance Divine City, he couldn’t control his anger, and he raged, “Huang Xiaolong if you have the guts, fight me like a man!”

As soon as the words left his lips, the experts from the other worlds shook their heads and sneered, “Is he stupid? A peak late-Tenth Order Emperor like him wants to challenge Huang Xiaolong to a one on one battle...?”

Even the pontiffs who were standing beside Dun Ei felt their faces redden.

When Dun Ei’s voice resounded in Huang Xiaolong’s ears, he sent another punch and smashed a mid-Fourth Order Emperor from the Radiance Divine City to bits. He glanced at Dun Ei from the corner of his eye and said, “Fight you like a man? I won’t bully you. Every single one of my Netherguards here is at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. If you manage to fight any one of them and kill them, I’ll accept your challenge.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Dun Ei’s expression sank.

Even though the Netherguards behind Huang Xiaolong were at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, they were from the Undead Race! He was clear about how terrifying the members of the Undead Race were! They were basically unkillable! Not to mention the one hundred Undead Netherguard puppets the King of Hell had refined personally. Even if he was at the limit of the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm and had the ability to step into the Sovereign Realm at any time, he wasn’t sure that he could kill a single Netherguard!

Huang Xiaolong paused all of a sudden, and the Heart of Hell in his body started to pulse. Traces of black light emerged from his body, and an earth-shattering roar broke the skies. It was as though the roar pierced through the rivers of time to arrive in their ears, and it contained a world-destroying might.

The heaven shaking sound shook the souls of everyone present!

“This?!” Chiyou’s expression changed. He yelled to all his comrades. “Everyone, you need to be careful! This is an ability from the Heart of Hell! It feeds on our inner demons! Rid yourself of all distracting thoughts!”

He knew the horrors of the Heart of Hell. It had long been imprinted in his mind. When he was on the battlefields of hell, Huang Xiaolong had used the exact same move to force the ancestors of the Black Killer Devil Sect, Hundred Transformations Sect, and Lightning Beast Valley to fight among themselves! He had controlled them with the help of the Heart of Hell, and they had turned on one another!

Dun Ei’s expression changed once again. He was shocked and angered at the same time. “Hurry up, activate the Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra!”

Previously, he had heard about Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying battle accomplishments in Hell. He had long since taken precautions against the Heart of Hell by passing down the Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra to all the pontiffs under him.

The Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra could destroy all demonic obstructions in one’s heart.

As soon as Dun Ei gave his order, the pontiffs started to chant the Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra. Runes appeared one after another and cleansed the area.

The runes were sent into the bodies of the bishops under them, who were controlled by their heart demons unendingly.
