Chapter 2539: Impending Appearance of the Saint Fate!

Snapping his eyes open, Huang Xiaolong stared at the one thousand eight hundred feet long lightning dragon in the sky. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Roar!

Without warning, the dragon charged at Huang Xiaolong.

Lighting filled the skies above the Cangqiong Holy Manor and terrifying waves of energy swept through the space.

Every single bolt would be enough to heavily injure a First Heaven True Saint.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to rush at the lightning dragons. After summoning his dragon attributed holy soul, Huang Xiaolong unleashed the Prosperity of the Dragons instantly.

…

Half a day later.

The tribulation clouds that covered several hundred million miles finally gathered enough power. With a growl that caused the world to tremble, an incredible amount of lightning bolts crashed down towards Huang Xiaolong.

There were a total of a hundred waves falling at once, and the boundless lightning threatened to swallow the seventh floor of the Cangqiong Holy Manor. It wanted nothing more than to swallow everything in its path.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t back down as he summoned the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear, the Flying Heaven Blood Stele, the Darkness Holy Ring, and the Black Corpse Holy Ring to meet the lightning head-on. He even summoned the Winged Dragon Flying Ship.

The three holy souls and saint godheads were pushed to the limit as he used everything he had.

“Prosperity of the Dragons!”

“Epoch of Darkness!”

“Sea of Endless Demons!”

“Heavenly Master Incarnation!”

Every single ultimate skill was unleashed, and Huang Xiaolong used every weapon at his disposal to take on the tribulation.

Boom!

With the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear taking the lead, it slammed into the lightning bolts falling from the skies before the Darkness Holy Ring turned the entire area into a world of darkness. Black corpse qi surrounded him, and the Winged Dragon Flying Ship opened its wings to take on the tribulation.

The heavens and earth shook as the two super forces clashed.

A buzzing sound filled Huang Xiaolong’s ear, and it didn’t fade until after a long time later.

The lands trembled, and it was as though they were shaking in fear of the strength of his sixth tribulation.

Only after a very long time did the Cangqiong Holy Manor regain its calm.

With the tribulation clouds finally dissipating, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief as the sky regained its color.

The sixth tribulation had already exceeded his expectations as it was several tens of times stronger than the fifth tribulation. Previously, he was shocked that the fifth tribulation had lasted for one whole hour, but now, the sixth tribulation took half a day!

Wiping away the cold sweat on his forehead, Huang Xiaolong sighed.

He was extremely lucky that he had the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear. Of course, he congratulated himself for improving his holy souls and Saint godheads throughout the years.

Since he was trying to accept the inheritance at the same time, Huang Xiaolong had to focus on both sides while taking on the tribulation. A single careless move, and he would be devoured by either side.

Whatever the case, he had passed the sixth tribulation.

As for the seventh one, Huang Xiaolong no longer thought about it. After all, he could deal with it after refining the energy contained in the sixth tribulation.

Three years passed in the blink of an eye and Huang Xiaolong refined the energy contained in the sixth tribulation with no issues. Turning his focus back to the inheritance, he devoured the grand dao energy coming from the statue.

…

Several dozen years later…

Tribulation clouds gathered in the skies once again as Huang Xiaolong saw the size of the lightning dragons. They were more than 2000 feet long and the clouds stretched out to fill more than a billion miles.

…

Thirty years later, the eighth tribulation arrived!

Fifty years later, Huang Xiaolong crossed the ninth tribulation!

Before entering the Cangqiong Holy Manor, Huang Xiaolong had estimated that he would probably be able to arrive at the Eighth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm after accepting the inheritance. However, he was shocked there was enough energy for him to arrive at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

After arriving at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, all that was left to do was to obtain the Saint Fate to enter the True Saint Realm!

Even with his holy souls, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t considered a True Saint. He would only become a True Saint after obtaining the Saint Fate born from the Holy World.

After so many years, those outside were still guessing the result of the battle on the sixth level over the key.

“There’s no need for us to hurry. Dao Friend Cangqiong’s inheritance isn’t something that can be accepted after several dozen years. Bufan will probably need several hundred years to accept the inheritance, and he might enter the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm when he emerges.”

“Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm?!”

The experts of the Devil Palace yelled in shock.

One had to know that Xie Bufan was only a Second Heaven True Saint when he had entered the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

“That’s right! Moreover, the Fourth Heaven is only a conservative estimate!”

Who the hell was the Cangqiong Old Man? He was the strongest cultivator in the Holy Heavens! His inheritance was something ordinary Primal Ancestors couldn't compare to!

“Lord Cao Nan, I’ve heard that Lin Xiaoying, Huai Po, and other Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints have already detected the birth of the Saint Fate. It should appear in the next thirty years.” One of the hall masters reported.

Cao Nan nodded slowly. “Since there are thirty years left, there’s no chance for Huang Xiaolong to fight for it!”

No matter how terrifying Huang Xiaolong’s talent is, he wouldn’t be able to arrive at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm in such a short amount of time!

“That’s right! Huang Xiaolong will never be able to fight for the Saint Fate! What’s more, he might even be taking a stroll in the netherworld right now. After all, His Highness Xie Bufan might have succeeded!”

“His Highness probably plans on killing Huang Xiaolong after accepting the inheritance. However, that would mean that Huang Xiaolong would live for several hundred more years!”

“That is true… His Highness probably wants Huang Xiaolong to watch him accept the Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance before killing him!”

Laughter filled the ranks of the Devil Palace.

…

In stark contrast, Lin Xiaoying stood at the peak of the Cangqiong Holy Mountain as she stared worriedly at the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

“Senior Sister, do you think it’s possible for Thirteen to accept the inheritance?” Lin Xiaoying turned to Ji Xinyi and asked.

In the Ghost Devil City, Huang Xiaolong had wiped out her memory about his holy souls. As such, Lin Xiaoying had no idea how strong Huang Xiaolong actually was. She was hoping with all her heart that Huang Xiaolong would be able to accept the inheritance by a stroke of luck.

Li Xinyi shook her head slowly. “Junior Sister, I know what you’re thinking of. However, Huang Xiaolong will never be able to obtain the key from either Li Chen or Xie Bufan. After all, Qiao Jinyang of the Devil Palace gave the Fiend Moon Blade to Xie Bufan, and his combat abilities had already surpassed Senior Sister Tan Juan. Even Senior Sister Tan Juan couldn’t have fought for the key if it landed in Xie Bufan’s hand…”

Lin Xiaoying lowered her head as a worried frown formed on her face.
