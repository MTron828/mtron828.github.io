Chapter 2134: Heavenly Master

As soon as Wan Shi was taken out from the battle, Tian Chen spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood. He tumbled about in the air as he retreated several million miles away from Huang Xiaolong. Even though Wan Shi managed to block most of Huang Xiaolong’s attack, a small portion of it landed on Tian Chen.

When Tian Chen finally stopped, he realized that there was a hole in the middle of his chest, and blood streamed out of it.

Everyone couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath when they noticed what happened. They were flabbergasted by the sudden change in events.

Tian Chen, who was suppressing Huang Xiaolong, was blown back in an instant! With a single punch, Huang Xiaolong had forced both Tian Chen and Wan Shi back!

The smiles on the faces of Tian Chen’s supporters froze, and it was especially so for the Dark Curses Old Ancestor and the others.

“You!” Tian Chen grabbed his chest and yelled at Huang Xiaolong.

“Weren’t you relying on the strength of the source energy of the Heavenly World? I’ll kill Wan Shi right now. Without him, let’s see how you call upon the power of the Heavenly World!”

A shaky figure slowly emerged from the broken mountain range. Wan Shi’s body was covered in blood, and there was a massive hole in his chest. It was a horrific sight that caused everyone who laid eyes on him to gasp in shock.

Was that the Lord Wan Shi they knew?! Wasn’t he the strongest person under the heavens?! Even someone as strong as him couldn’t block a single punch from Huang Xiaolong!

How strong did Huang Xiaolong have to be in order to give Wan Shi such a serious wound?!

Wan Shi crawled out from the ground and heard how Huang Xiaolong declared his death as though he was nothing more than an ant on the ground, and he couldn’t help but vomit another mouthful of blood.

Who in the myriad of worlds could look down on him?! When had he ever had to suffer from such humiliation?!

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll kill you!” Wan Shi roared at the heavens as white light poured out from his body. Blood-red light slowly emerged to add to his scary image.

A shockingly powerful aura emerged from Wan Shi’s body.

The wound on his chest closed in an instant as the destructive energy Huang Xiaolong had poured into his body was expelled at an astounding rate. His aura strengthened and pierced through the heavens.

It was clear that he was utterly incensed by Huang Xiaolong’s threat. No longer caring about the consequences, he decided to use everything he had to take Huang Xiaolong down.

Even though Wan Shi was using a special technique to increase his strength in a short period of time, the backlash he had to endure was equally as large. In fact, he would suffer heavy injuries even if he managed to defeat his opponent!

When Huang Xiaolong looked at Wan Shi, who was pushing his body past its limits, he remained indifferent. Even if Wan Shi became stronger and joined hands with Tian Chen, he knew that they weren’t his opponents.

Moreover, Wan Shi should only be able to maintain his strength for a limited amount of time. Also, he wouldn’t be able to become an unstoppable monster. After all, there was a limit as to how strong he could become.

No longer giving Huang Xiaolong time to think about it, Wan Shi pushed both his palms towards Huang Xiaolong as he commenced his attack. Tian Chen didn’t remain idle as his blade slashed downwards. It was as though they had rehearsed their attack in the past.

A cold snort escaped Huang Xiaolong’s lips as he sent a palm towards Wan Shi and a fist towards Tian Chen’s blade light.

Blacklight covered his palm as brilliant radiance enveloped his fist.

Boom!

A massive explosion sounded out when the attacks collided with each other. Wan Shi and Tian Chen were sent flying at the same time!

The Dark Curses Old Ancestor and the rest of Tian Chen’s supporters sucked in a cold breath.

Even after using a secret technique to increase his strength, Wan Shi and Tian Chen were no match for Huang Xiaolong!

After the two of them retreated, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred once again as he appeared before Wan Shi. Blacklight converged to form a dark sword before he stabbed towards the space between Wan Shi’s eyebrows.

Before the sword could even reach him, Wan Shi felt as though his skin was tearing apart. Pulling out the supreme spiritual treasure armor, he tried desperately to protect himself. Even so, the armor was nowhere near its complete state, as cracks had spread all around it ever since Huang Xiaolong had blasted it with the lightning bead.

Even though the armor wasn’t at its peak state, Wan Shi couldn’t care less. He used all the energy in his body to activate the grand formation carved into the armor as he summoned the Myriad Worlds Bamboo to stab towards Huang Xiaolong. His other hand gathered Great Purity qi as he slammed it into Huang Xiaolong’s dark sword in a desperate attempt to stop him.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother with the Myriad Worlds Bamboo. The sword in his hand didn’t stop as it slammed into the Great Purity qi. With the ability to turn anything it touched back into streams of chaos qi, the sword in Huang Xiaolong’s arm slowly crumbled.

It was too bad the sword light continued to pierce towards the space between Wan Shi’s eyebrows. A stream of blood emerged from his glabella after Huang Xiaolong’s sword light pierced into him.

At the same time, the Myriad Worlds Bamboo slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s chest, and it sent him flying. Too bad for Wan Shi, only a shallow wound was left on Huang Xiaolong’s chest, and he didn’t even manage to draw blood.

After Huang Xiaolong’s attack connected, Wan Shi fell from the skies.

Tian Chen, whose blood was boiling, felt as though a bucket of ice water was poured over him as he couldn’t help but stare at the scene before him with his jaws agape.

Spitting out a mouthful of blood, he cried out, “Brother Wan Shi!”

The words barely left Tian Chen’s mouth when Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi slashed towards his forehead. The sword qi was nothing to scoff at. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t holding back any longer, and if Tian Chen were to take the attack head-on, he wouldn’t be far from death.

A look of fear flashed through Tian Chen’s eyes as his life flashed past his eyes. Raising the blade in his hands, he attempted to block Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi. It was too bad the sword qi made a turn as it dodged his giant blade to arrive in the space between his eyebrows.

Am I going to die?!

The feeling of death gripped his heart, and it was as though the sky had lost its color. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Dark Curses Old Ancestor and the others watched as Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi stabbed towards Tian Chen as their expressions changed. Suddenly, a majestic voice boomed in the skies and brought with it endless amounts of power. “Ignorant junior, how dare you behave so preposterously?!”

A giant palm appeared above Huang Xiaolong’s head. It was a massive gray palm that contained suppressive might. Endless gray light covered the skies as life force seemed to drain from every single living creature under the heavens.

Everyone felt their bodies tremble, and they experienced the feeling of something being taken from them.

Huang Xiaolong finally turned serious when he noticed the gray palm slamming down towards him. He had no choice but to give up on killing Tian Chen as his figure flashed once again in retreat. Three Complete Dao Saint Godheads appeared above him as a palm formed with radiance energy met the gray palm in the sky.

Bang!

The world flashed with two different colors and two different colors only when their attacks slammed into each other.

A sharp pain shot through the eyes of everyone present, and the cultivators who were even remotely close to the point of impact were sent flying.

Tian Chen wasn’t able to escape as he was sent tumbling through the air like everyone else.

When Huang Xiaolong retreated several dozen thousand miles away, he stared at the Heavenly World’s highest point. Above the peak of the Heavenly Master Divine Palace stood an old man whose body was covered in streams of chaos energy.

“Heavenly Master...” Huang Xiaolong muttered in a low voice.
