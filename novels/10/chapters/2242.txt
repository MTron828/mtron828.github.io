Chapter 2243: Their Young Master Became A Holy Prince?!

Looking at a crowd of several thousand experts kneeling in salute, the Nine Heavens Gate’s Chief Du Youze, Eminent Elder Wang Qi, and the rest of the Nine Heavens Gate’s experts reacted and hurriedly knelt towards Huang Xiaolong in salute.

Despite suppressing his panic, the Nine Heavens Gate’s Chief Du Youze’s hands and legs were trembling.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over the saluting crowd and finally stopped on the Nine Heavens Gate’s Chief Du Youze and Grand Elder Zhou Heng.

Zhou Heng couldn’t muster up any energy when he sensed Huang Xiaolong’s gaze on him. He lowered his head further to the ground, shrinking his body as small as he could, not daring to look at Huang Xiaolong. The scenes from the Lingering Fragrance Inn, where he forced Huang Xiaolong to vacate the room with his VIP card and attacked him, replayed in his mind.

He, a Nine Heavens Gate’s Grand Elder, actually wanted to force the Holy Gate’s Holy Prince to scram with a VIP card...?!

He, a Nine Heavens Gate’s Grand Elder, actually dared to attack the Holy Gate’s Holy Prince?!

What crime was that to attack a Holy Gate’s Holy Prince?!

Thinking of the consequences, Zhou Heng fell into a stupor!

After seeing that Zhou Heng had actually frightened himself to the point of fainting, Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent on the surface, but he was a little speechless inwardly. He had everyone stand up and then walked straight towards the division’s main entrance.

Zhang Wenyue and the others were still waiting outside for him.

Sun Huage, Liu Cheng, and the others followed after Huang Xiaolong faithfully. Inwardly, they were a little baffled, seeing Huang Xiaolong walking towards the division’s main entrance, but none of them dared to ask him any questions.

At the same time, the Falling Jade Dynasty’s Emperor Bi Liang, Big Dipper Sword Sect’s Sect Chief Wang Tian, Incineration Valley Master Qin Zhixu, and the rest also followed after the group in front cheekily.

Their expressions indicated that it was a glorious thing being able to follow Huang Xiaolong,, even if it was in this manner!

Indeed, being able to follow behind a Holy Prince was a great honor in the Holy Lands, even if one was following at the tail of a long line.

The Holy Lands consisted of ten continents, over seven hundred dynasties, more than three thousand Venerable expert headed sects, and forces like the Beast Emperor Sect were too many to count. One couldn’t even count the number of experts, desiring to follow a Holy Prince’s side, but never had the chance in their lifetime.

If the Holy Lands was an empire, then the Holy Prince would be a candidate with a high chance of succeeding the throne, the Patriarch position of the Holy Gate. Only a Holy Prince qualified for the selection. Only a Holy Prince had the hope of rising to that position.

This was not the Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds’ rule, but the same rule applied to the Holy World’s thousands and thousands of Holy Gates.

Only Holy Princes, who possessed a complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, had the possibility of stepping into True Saint Realm, and inherit the Holy Gate’s Patriarch position.

This was the reason why a Holy Prince’s status was so high in the Holy Lands.

At this time, on the outside of the Holy Gate division’s main entrance, Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian were waiting anxiously, looking towards the entrance from time to time.

“This kind of waiting really makes people anxious. On top of that, we can’t even find out how the Young Master is doing?” Zhang Wenyue mumbled. Her delicate face was filled with worry. “Why were there so many experts hurrying over to the division a while ago? Did something happen inside the Holy Gate division?”

“Could it have something to do with that golden light, and red and green rays?” Zhang Haochen blurted out.

The three of them had naturally seen the brilliant colorful rays. Although they didn’t know what had happened inside, Zhang Haochen had an inclination that it had got something to do with so many experts arriving at the Holy Gate division.

Just as Zhang Wenyue opened her mouth to speak, she spotted Huang Xiaolong coming out.

“Young Master!” Joy rose to Zhang Wenyue’s face. She hurried towards Huang Xiaolong with Zhang Haochen and Prince Qian, but seconds later, all three stopped, dumbstruck.

The three of them finally discovered there were Sun Huage, Liu Cheng, Falling Jade Dynasty’s Emperor Bi Liang, Big Dipper Sword Sect’s Sect Chief Wang Tian, Incineration Valley Master Qin Zhixu, and many others.

Although none of them recognized big shots like Sun Huage, Liu Cheng, and the Falling Jade Dynasty’s Emperor Bi Liang, they could roughly guess these people’s identities.

But now, the Falling Jade Dynasty’s Emperor Bi Liang and other big shots were walking behind Huang Xiaolong. And the bright smiling expressions on their faces were naturally hard to miss!

One word could be used to describe the smiles on these people’s faces—ingratiating.

While the trio was still in shock and confusion, and they were looking a little lost, Huang Xiaolong smiled at them and said, “We’ll return to the inn first.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Return to the inn first?!

Sun Huage, Liu Cheng, Emperor Bi Liang, and the rest were the ones dumbfounded now.

“All of you disperse for now.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand as he directed his words to the crowd behind him. He then added to Sun Huage and Liu Cheng, “These days, I would be staying at the Lingering Fragrance Inn. If there is anything, just find me at the Lingering Fragrance Inn.”

Both Sun Huage and Liu Cheng didn’t dare to object Huang Xiaolong’s decision, and both knelt down and acknowledged, “Yes, Your Highness Holy Prince!”

Emperor Bi Liang, and the rest also knelt as they acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s words, “We adhere to Your Highness Holy Prince’s order, and we bid farewell to Your Highness Holy Prince!”

Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian quivered slightly, and their eyes widened like headlights. H-Holy, Holy P-Prince?!

Their Young Master had become a Holy Prince?!

Could it be...?!

“Why are you guys standing here so dumbstruck? Let’s go ah.” Huang Xiaolong flicked Zhang Wenyue’s forehead smilingly, then left on the Six-Eyed Ice Lion.

Zhang Wenyu’s senses finally returned due to the pain in her forehead. She trembled with excitement as she looked at Huang Xiaolong’s back. She couldn’t believe it, and the whole situation was simply unbelievable. In the end, she realized she was still standing on the same spot when Zhang Haochen and Prince Qian gave her a light pull.

The Falling Jade Dynasty’s Emperor Bi Liang, Big Dipper Sword Sect’s Sect Chief Wang Tian, Incineration Valley Master Qin Zhixu, and the rest of the crowd all looked on enviously at Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian’s backs.

In the eyes of Venerable Realm experts like Bi Liang, Wang Tian, Qin Zhixu, the trio Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian had clearly run into supermassive dog-shit luck. Even though being mere Heavenly Monarch Realm cultivators, they were able to be by the Holy Prince’s side!

In general, those who could stay by a Holy Prince’s side were high-level Venerable experts.

While Huang Xiaolong was on his way back to the Lingering Fragrance Inn, news of the appearance of a Holy Prince, simultaneously possessing a complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, exploded in the Falling Jade Dynasty.

The Falling Jade Dynasty consisted of several thousand kingdoms, countless families and clans, and even more sect forces, who boiled!

Soon, this news spread to the neighboring dynasties, the whole Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent, and even the Continent City!

The whole Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent was in a furor!

The dozens of dynasties on the continent were shocked. The emperors, over two hundred Venerable experts’ sects of these dynasties, all hurried to the Falling Jade Dynasty like great swarms of bees.

While these people were hurrying to the Falling Jade Dynasty, there was a humongous flying ship traveling through the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent’s unique space tunnel in the direction of the Falling Jade Dynasty. On the side of this humongous flying ship was an enormous eye-catching ‘Holy’ character!

This was the special flying ship owned by the Holy Gate’s branch in the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent. This was the only one in the entire continent.

Inside the flying ship stood more than a dozen experts, and each one of them was clad in the Holy Gate’s brocade robe. Their bodies exuded deep and vigorous energy.

“It has been more than a hundred billion years since a Holy Prince appeared in our Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent!” The thick-browed, middle-aged man, standing at the head of the group laughed heartily, “Finally, we don’t have to rank at the bottom!”

This thick-browed, middle-aged man was the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent Holy Gate branch’s Branch Master, Du Gen.

Another Holy Prince had appeared in the Forceful Heavenly Bull Continent. He could dip in some of the glory as the Branch Master.
