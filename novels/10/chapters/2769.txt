Chapter 2770: Qian Haishan

The auction finally began, and the first auction item was a peak grade saint artifact. Although it wasn’t a dao artifact, it successfully stirred the crowd’s enthusiasm and lifted the auction’s atmosphere.

In a short time, another ten items were auctioned off, from unique holy spiritual veins, ancient items, and divine beast core, to unverifiable rare holy stones.

However, Huang Xiaolong was silent the whole time. His main goal this time was simple, to buy the Purple Lightning Water and the three other innate materials, as well as those dozen of grand dao pills.

On the other hand, the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Young Patriarch Chen Hong had bought several items so far. Moreover, his bidding prices were all on the higher side. These several items had cost two to three hundred million Tuoshen Holy coins to Chen Hong’s pocket. Every time Chen Hong made a successful bid for an item, he would purposefully glance in Huang Xiaolong’s direction, clearly telling Huang Xiaolong that he was richer than the hillbilly Huang Xiaolong.

“Young Lord, that hillbilly hasn’t made any bid so far. It seems like he really doesn't have money, and he only came to join the liveliness. We overestimated that hillbilly. We thought that hillbilly might be able to come out with one hundred million Tuoshen Holy coins, but now, I think that even taking out fifty million will be a problem for him.” Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Primal Ancestor expert, who had reprimanded Huang Xiaolong, snickered.

Chen Hong smiled, “It is very common for people that come from remote sacred lands like them. They mostly come to gain experience, to have a taste of the atmosphere.”

The two of them did not conceal their words, deliberately speaking loudly, so that the words reached Huang Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man, and the others’ ears.

Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, and Chen Qi’s brows furrowed slightly, yet Huang Xiaolong watched on without any reaction.

The auction house auctioned several items as time passed, yet Huang Xiaolong remained silent.

Seeing this, Chen Hong and his group were even more certain that Huang Xiaolong had merely come to join in the fun, and their mocking snickers and words never stopped.

“Our next auction time is the Purple Lightning Water, Stone of Black Abyss, Frozen Ice Heart, and Heavenly Earth Mud, these four innate materials. I believe everyone already knows that these four items are crucial main materials in forging dao artifacts.” On the auction stage, the auctioneer went on, “Not to mention, these four materials still have many other uses.”

The auctioneer briefly explained some uses of the four materials and lastly increased his voice, “Shall we start the bidding for these four materials? These four materials will be auctioned together, and the bidding price starts at three hundred million Tuoshen Holy coins!”

Three hundred million!

The moment the auctioneer announced the bidding price, it frightened off many tempted individuals.

Chen Hong, too, was taken aback by the initial bidding price, and mumbled, “The Purple Lightning Water, Stone of Black Abyss, Frozen Ice Heart, and Heavenly Earth Mud are priced so expensively!”

The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Primal Ancestor expert also frowned slightly. “The auction house is really black. Three hundred million Tuoshen Holy coins is more than enough to buy all four items, but they actually set it as the starting price. The deal price will probably reach four hundred million, will it?”

Many other guests were also complaining about the price in low voices.

“Three hundred and ten million,” suddenly, a voice from the far back sounded.

The voice immediately attracted many people’s attention.

“It’s Sea Mountain Sacred Land’s Patriarch Qian Haishan!”

Quite a few people recognized the person who made the bid.

Sea Mountain Sacred Land ranked sixteenth in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave’s forces! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Even though the Sea Mountain Sacred Land wasn’t one of the top ten sacred lands, their patriarch, Qian Haishan, was a powerful expert who was listed as one of the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave’s top ten experts!

After hearing Qian Haishan’s name, the crowd stirred as if no one had expected Qian Haishan to appear in an underground black market auction.

Many that planned to bid for this batch of materials extinguished their thoughts when Qian Haishan made the first move. Since Qian Haishan had spoken personally, who would dare to compete against him?

Even if the top ten sacred lands’ young lords were there, they would think twice before making a bid.

“I didn’t expect Patriarch Qian Haishan would attend the auction in person. It looks like he’s determined to get these four items.” Chen Hong was just as surprised as others, and at the same time, he looked at Qian Haishan with fervor. Qian Haishan was one of the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave’s top ten experts.

While everyone was surprised by Qian Haishan’s presence, a voice rang across the hall, “Four hundred million!”

Four hundred million!

The voice wasn’t loud, but it clearly sounded in everyone’s ears.

The amount shocked everyone and their necks craned towards another direction to see who it was. Someone actually dared to bid after Patriarch Qian Haishan.

Could it be a young lord from the top ten sacred lands?

However, to their amazement, the person who made the bid was an unknown young man from the human race.

Naturally, this young man was Huang Xiaolong, and he was dead set on getting these four materials. Forget about Qian Haishan, but even if it was the Saint Devil Patriarch himself, he would still fight for these materials.

“It’s him, that hillbilly!” The same Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Primal Ancestor was astonished, and so was Chen Hong. He stared at Huang Xiaolong, looking dumbfounded. This hillbilly has four hundred million? And he dared to bid against Lord Qian Haishan?

When Qian Haishan saw it was an unknown young man, bidding against him, he was a little surprised. Not to mention that this young man was a mere Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm belonging to the human race. He took a quick glance at Huang Xiaolong, and said, “Four hundred and ten million.”

He wanted to see if this human race youngster still dared to follow his bid.

“Five hundred million!” Huang Xiaolong called out without needing to consider.

“What?!”

Everyone was greatly shocked now.

Five hundred million?!

“This hillbilly has five hundred million? He won’t be making trouble deliberately, right?” The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s expert voiced his doubt out loud.

Chen Hong sneered, “He better not be making trouble on purpose, or he will be really dead for sure.”

As one of the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave’s ten biggest commerce houses, the Crimson Knife Commerce had many business transactions with various sacred lands. It was no exaggeration to say that even an existence like Qian Haishan would have to be courteous to the Crimson Knife Commerce.

Qian Haishan frowned. He shot a glare at Huang Xiaolong, and he suspected that Huang Xiaolong was sent by his enemy to bid against him.

Qian Haishan called one of the auction’s supervisors and said, “Go and verify if that kid really has five hundred million Tuoshen Holy coins, and if he does not, then detain him. After the auction ends, leave it to me to deal with him!” His tone was far from amicable, and he did not hide his displeasure. Thus his voice reached Huang Xiaolong’s ears clearly.

As the Sea Mountain Sacred Land’s patriarch, and one of the top ten experts of Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, he was provoked so blatantly in public by a mere True Saint brat. The thought of killing Huang Xiaolong flashed across his mind.

Although Qian Haishan was not a part of the Crimson Knife Commerce’s upper echelons, the supervisor did not dare to refuse his request. He approached Huang Xiaolong and ordered Huang Xiaolong to prove his credibility.

Huang Xiaolong threw a spatial ring to the supervisor with a calm expression. When the supervisor opened the spatial ring, a rush of holy spiritual energy flowed out, astounding the rest.

“This, this, that hillbilly actually has so many Tuoshen Holy coins on him?!” Chen Hong exclaimed in shock, “1.5 billion?”

Huang Xiaolong had exchanged about 1.2 billion at the Saint Dao Bank on top of the several hundred million he had on him. In total, there were almost 1.6 billion inside the spatial ring.

Qian Haishan had not expected Huang Xiaolong to have so many Tuoshen Holy coins on him, and he was genuinely shocked. It was more than a billion Tuoshen Holy coins, and although he too could take out this sum, it was startling that a True Saint had such wealth.

“Can we continue?” Huang Xiaolong asked as he stared at the auction house’s supervisor.

The supervisor reacted and respectfully returned the spatial ring to Huang Xiaolong.

The auction resumed.
