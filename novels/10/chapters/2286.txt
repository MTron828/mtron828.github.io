Chapter 2287: Spiritual Island in the Mirage Sea

“Huang Xiaolong had only displayed his Infinite Brilliance Divine Dragon Saint Godhead in the arena, and it ranked three thousand two hundred and eighty among the saint godheads. Even if he transformed into a primordial divine dragon, he shouldn’t have been Yang Rong’s match!” Jiang Tian suddenly realized that there was something wrong with the battle. “He managed to kill Yang Rong even after Yang Rong’s powerup. There has to be something suspicious about that!”

Jiang Wuji felt his head spinning as he muttered to himself, “There has to be some sort of secret on Huang Xiaolong’s body!”

...

After leaving the Jiang Family, Huang Xiaolong headed towards the servant quarters of the Chen Family before bringing Feng Tianyu, and the various other slaves to leave the Central Holy Dynasty for the Blue Sea.

As soon as they left the capital of the Central Holy Dynasty, Huang Xiaolong retrieved several pills that aided in breakthroughs before giving them all to Feng Tianyu and the other slaves of the Chen Family.

After handing Feng Tianyu’s beloved disciple, Xue Qi, over to the guardians of the Holy Gate, Huang Xiaolong requested them to aid her in her recovery.

Despite their abilities, Xue Qi’s condition seemed extremely bleak. The members of the Jiang Family hadn’t held back, and they damaged the root of her godhead. She couldn’t recover unless she was fed a saint pill!

Unless True Saint Realm experts personally made a move to help Xue Qi, there was no way she would recover.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t blame the four guardians for being unable to cure her. Taking out several precious origin pills and jade stones, Huang Xiaolong allowed them to pick whatever they liked. Moreover, he gave them a hundred billion holy bills each.

For the half-True Saint Realm experts, a hundred billion holy bills were no small sum.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong had rewarded them with a hundred billion holy bills each, along with several precious spiritual pills and jade stones, their ‘desire’ to protect Huang Xiaolong grew stronger. Finally, their gaze softened when they looked at the god of fortune before them.

Initially, they hid some resentment in their hearts when Li Wen had sent them to protect Huang Xiaolong. After all, he was just a mere Sovereign Realm expert. Lofty half-True Saints like them weren’t supposed to act as bodyguards for a Sovereign! However, the moment Huang Xiaolong passed them a hundred billion holy bills, their resentment instantly disappeared. They couldn’t be happier that they were chosen to protect Huang Xiaolong.

As they made their way to the Blue Sea, Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle. He took out the level-six origin spiritual pill Li Yuhui and the others had given him as compensation and started to refine them. There was also the matter of Yang Rong’s saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique.

Twenty days later, when they arrived in the space above the Blue Sea, he had completely refined Yang Rong’s saint attributes. His three saint godheads, saint bloodlines, and saint physique had improved by quite a bit.

Even though he had no idea how much he had improved, he was sure that their ranking had increased by a substantial amount. They should be ranked in the three thousands now.

Along with his refinement of various precious treasures, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation reached the peak of the early-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm.

The moment they arrived in the space above the Blue Sea, Huang Xiaolong contacted the chief of the bandits he had subdued in the past before heading towards the northern part of the sea.

Four days later, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at a spiritual island in the northern part of the Blue Sea.

When looking at the island from above, it wasn’t large at all. There was just enough space on land to build a city, and it was called the Mirage Sea Spiritual City.

The Mirage Sea Spiritual Island was but one of many islands located on the outskirts of the Blue Sea and several tiny bandit groups operated around the area. All the bandits subdued by Huang Xiaolong had banded together to form their own bandit group.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the Mirage Sea Spiritual City, the chief of the bandits had been waiting for quite some time.

“We greet Your Highness, Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong!”

Everyone kowtowed when Huang Xiaolong approached. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Looking at the four to five thousand bandits who kowtowed in unison, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction before allowing them to get up.

“Your Highness, we have prepared a grand feast in the city.” A middle-aged man with thick eyebrows rose to his feet as he bowed towards Huang Xiaolong.

The middle-aged man was called Liu Zhi, and he was the strongest among all the bandits. He was also the smartest one around. Because of that, Huang Xiaolong had allowed him to act as the leader of the group.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong led Feng Tianyu, the guardians, and everyone else into the city.

The Mirage Sea Spiritual City couldn’t be considered an actual city. It was constructed in a simplistic manner, and it was barely bigger than the courtyards of the superfamilies in the Central Holy Dynasty’s capital city.

When Liu Zhi and the others appeared to take over the island, the city had already been built. With the resources given to them by Huang Xiaolong and the combined strength of them all, they had managed to renovate the city into something a little more pleasing to the eye.

Since they had less time, they had tried their best to improve the conditions in the city.

A look of embarrassment appeared on Liu Zhi’s face when they entered the city. He turned to Huang Xiaolong and apologized, “Your Highness, I am sorry, but due to the lack of jade stones and spirit stones, the spiritual qi in the city isn’t dense enough....”

Huang Xiaolong shook his hand and laughed, “It’s fine. We can take things one step at a time. This city will do it.”

“Look at the flowers, trees, and scenery around us. There are even spiritual beasts, spiritual fruits, and even divine trees growing around us. We have all we need. Aren’t there other islands with nothing on them?”

Everyone chuckled when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Regardless of the situation of the island, it was much better than the other islands around the Blue Sea.

As soon as they entered the city, Huang Xiaolong, Feng Tianyu, and the guardians entered the Mirage Sea City Residence. Even though it wasn’t comparable to the Myriad Dragon Peak in the Holy Gate, it was better than nothing. In fact, it was pretty impressive after the bandits’ renovation.

Sitting in the main hall, Huang Xiaolong questioned Liu Zhi about the situation of the other spiritual islands around them.

Without missing a beat, Liu Zhi replied to Huang Xiaolong’s questions to the best of his knowledge.

When he spoke about the other spiritual islands, the Divine Sea Spiritual Island stood out from the rest. It was the island with the strongest experts and the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island was outclassed in terms of strength. The Divine Sea Spiritual Island was nearly a hundred times stronger than them and Liu Zhi couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear blossoming in his heart.

In the past, the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island was experiencing mass chaos as bandits had fought against each other to control the island. The Divine Sea Spiritual Island didn’t bother too much about them, but now that the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island had fallen under Liu Zhi’s control, the Divine Sea Spiritual Island was no longer planning to sit still.

“According to the way the Divine Sea Spiritual Island does things, they should be sending an envoy over soon. They should be planning to take over the island, and if I refuse to give in, they’ll probably send over assassins to kill me. As soon as I die, they’ll send over some men to take control of the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island.”

“What if you give in?” Feng Tianyu asked.

“If we do, we will have to pay tribute to them every hundred years. We will have to give ninety percent of the earnings to the Divine Sea Spiritual Island!”

“Ninety percent?!” Feng Tianyu sucked in a cold breath. “What’s the difference between them controlling the island themselves and collecting that much tribute?!”

Ten percent was barely enough to keep the island running!
