Chapter 2851: Dragon Fish Creed Mission Hall’s Senior Deacon!

Relying on the fact that he was Liu Ansheng’s nephew, Zhou Xing spoke directly to Li Yuan, “Elder Li Yuan, this dog of a slave and their young master have been lawlessly arrogant from the moment they entered the front hall. I merely asked them a question, but not only did they refuse to answer me properly, but attacked me instead!”

Liu Ansheng spoke ahead of Li Yuan after hearing his nephew’s explanation, “Elder Li Yuan, there is no need to waste time with this kind of arrogant and ignorant generation that disregards the Dragon Fish Creed. Let them pay with their lives for their mistakes!”

“Deacon Liu Ansheng is right. Regardless of who they might be, we need to capture them first before we do any talking!” Another deacon supported.

Li Yuan ignored Liu Ansheng, his eyes never leaving Long Jianfei. He was waiting to see how Long Jianfei was going to explain himself.

Long Jianfei’s cold gaze swept over Zhou Xing, Liu Ansheng, and the deacon who clamored to capture him, and then, he took out a token and threw it to Li Yuan.

Li Yuan easily caught the token in midair, with a hint of confusion between his brows, but when he saw the token, he froze for a second then blurted out, “Dragon Fish Creed Mission Hall’s senior deacon!”

This token was exactly the identity token of the Dragon Fish Creed Mission Hall’s senior deacon!

Some sacred lands’ experts might not recognize this token, but as an inner disciple, who was promoted to a branch elder’s position, Li Yuan naturally recognized this token!

“What?! Dragon Fish Creed Mission Hall’s senior deacon?!”

Liu Ansheng was stupefied!

Zhou Xing and Tai Cheng looked similarly stupefied!

There were also the present deacons and other experts. All of them stared at that token in disbelief.

Tai Cheng, Liu Ansheng, Zhou Xing, and the others looked at Long Jianfei with unbelievable expressions.

This, this dog-slave is actually a Dragon Fish Creed Mission Hall’s senior deacon?!

Despite the highest authority of a Dragon Fish Creed’s branch, Li Yuan’s status and identity were much lower than that of a Mission Hall’s senior deacon!

This lowly slave actually has a higher status than Li Yuan?!

Long Jianfei wasn’t surprised that Li Yuan recognized the identity token. Although he had been missing for many years, generally, a top creed force like the Dragon Fish Creed would not revise the characteristics of their tokens.

“That’s right, I am a senior deacon of Dragon Fish Creed’s Mission Hall. I’ve been missing for many years that the Dragon Fish Creed proclaimed my death and erased my record. I came here today to re-register my identity,” Long Jianfei said without much explanation.

Tai Cheng, Liu Ansheng, Zhou Xing, and everyone who heard Long Jianfei’s words were dumbfounded.

“I see,” Li Yuan’s attitude changed immediately, and he respectfully said to Lang Jianfei, “Lord, please follow me into the inner hall. Due to the procedural requirements, I need to confirm certain details with Lord, so this way please!”

Li Yuan showed the way with his hand, inviting Long Jianfei into the inner hall.

But Long Jianfei turned to Huang Xiaolong and respectfully said, “Your Highness, please, after you.”

Those watching were completely dazed when they stared at Huang Xiaolong in bewildered astonishment.

His Highness?

For a moment, Li Yuan was at a loss as to how he should greet Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong walked ahead under Long Jianfei’s invitation towards the inner hall, followed by Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and lastly, Li Yuan.

There was an ugly expression etched on Liu Ansheng’s face as he watched the four people walk away. He shot Zhou Xing a hateful glare and scolded, “Is this the good thing you did?!”

There was no doubt that Long Jianfei’s identity token was genuine. Li Yuan wouldn’t make a mistake on that matter. When Long Jianfei’s identity was restored, and if he held a grudge on what had happened today, Liu Ansheng could predict his gloomy days ahead.

The deacon, who had spoken out supporting Liu Ansheng and clamored to capture Long Jianfei earlier, was twisting his guts in regret. He even wanted to give himself a few slaps for the troubles that his mouth had caused.

Long Jianfei, who was walking towards the inner hall behind Huang Xiaolong, spoke icily as he passed in front of Tai Cheng, “Go back and tell Yu Xin that sl*t that I’ll be paying her a visit soon.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Tai Cheng stiffened, and his expression turned unsightly, but this time, he didn’t even dare to make a sound. He lowered his head, hiding the hatred and fury in his eyes.

Under various complicated gazes, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng entered the inner hall under Li Yuan’s respectful escort.

“We… should we go in too?” Liu Ansheng sort of muttered the words awkwardly before following after the four in a few quick steps. Other deacons also trailed into the inner hall.

The Dragon Fish Creed Blue Rainbow branch’s guards and disciples surrounding the front hall dispersed without a word.

In the hall, Tai Cheng and Zhou Xing stood gloomily, showing no signs of leaving.

“Young Lord?” A while later, a Tai Family’s guard gingerly approached Tai Cheng and called out.

Tai Cheng snapped out of his bewilderment and looked at the guard.

“Are, are we still going to register?” the guard asked weakly.

Tai Cheng nodded despite looking lost in thought, “Let’s go register,” but he sounded dispirited.

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng stepped out of the inner hall, sent out respectfully by Li Yuan, Liu Ansheng, and a few others.

Liu Ansheng walked behind Long Jianfei, saying something with a fawning smile on his face, but judging from his tone, it seemed like he wanted to invite Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng to his manor to apologize and make amends for the earlier misunderstanding.

“There is no need,” Long Jianfei rejected mercilessly.

Before the apprehensive, complicated, and envious gazes of various forces’ disciples who had come to register, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Dua Feng left the Dragon Fish Creed’s branch.

Li Yuan, Liu Ansheng, and the rest of the deacons sent Huang Xiaolong’s group all the way to the main entrance. None of them returned to the building until long after the three people disappeared at the horizon.

Several days later…

In the noble Tai Family main residence’s great hall, an elegant woman that exuded nobility down to her bones was standing in front of Tai Cheng. This woman was Yu Xin.

“You said that person is called Long Jianfei? A senior deacon of the Dragon Fish Creed’s Mission Hall from the past?!!” Yu Xin exclaimed in shock as she stared wide-eyed at her son.

She had just returned to the Blue Rainbow Sacred Land not long ago, and she was surprised to hear this news the moment she returned.

In truth, none of the Yu Family had informed Yu Xin of Long Jianfei’s return.

“Mother, you really know this person?” Tai Cheng asked, “Who is he?”

Yu Xin did not answer him, but her face didn’t look very good.

“He was your mother’s ex-fiance, but he went missing for a long time and the Dragon Fish Creed announced his demise. Later on, your mother married me.”

A good-looking man walked in with vigorous steps. This man was none other than the Tai Family’s current patriarch, Tai Zhaoyang.

“Father!”

Tai Cheng greeted, but at the same time, his mind was blown away by the information his father had revealed, “That Long Jianfei, he’s mother’s ex…?”

“Yes, Lon Jianfei was a famous young lord from the Long Family in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land. After Long Jianfei went missing, your mother and Yu Family decided to rescind the engagement between the two families and even began to suppress the Long Family. The Yu Family went as far as hiring a Dao Venerable from the Mystical Pavilion to deal with Long Jinafei’s father,” Tai Zhaoyang spilled the events of the past to his son.

“That’s enough!” Suddenly, Yu Xin snapped agitatedly.

A complicated feeling flickered across Tai Cheng’s face. He had always known that there was a knot between his partners. Today, he finally learned the cause, and it was Long Jianfei?!

“There’s one more thing. I received news that after Long Jianfei returned, he killed your Yu Family’s younger generation Yu Yi, and many other Yu Family disciples. Even your cousin Yu Chengming’s physical body was destroyed, and his dao soul was imprisoned!” Tai Zhaoyang added.
