Chapter 3674 – Surprise

“Alright!” Wu Zun laughed, “We’ll go to the Sword Grave now! I heard that the Hell Refining Sword might appear this time!”

“Hell Refining Sword?!” The Nether Yang King and Jiu Yu gasped in shock.

The Hell Refining Sword was one of the most famous swords in the Unknown Lands! It was a treasure at the pseudo universe level artifact!

There were differences between levels of pseudo universe level artifacts. Those born naturally by the universe would be much stronger than those refined by cultivators.

The moment the Hell Refining Sword was born, the howls of spirits would be heard through the lands. As long as an expert who cultivated in the ghostly arts got their hands on it, they would be able to unleash a terrifying might!

“Yeah! Other than the Hell Refining Sword, there might be several other pseudo creation level artifacts!” Wu Zun laughed. “This is one of the reasons I came.”

After hearing the news, the eyes of the Nether Yang King and Jiu Yu lit up.

“We have to go to the Sword Grave right now! We can’t allow the kid to get all the good stuff!” Jiu Yu chuckled. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng arrived.

Jiang Dacheng was too stunned to speak when he saw the scene at the Sword Grave.

In front of him, there was an endless amount of swords! There were all types of swords, and there were trillions of them stretching out for as far as he could see!

It was practically a sea of swords!

“This… Lord… There are so many swords! How should I find one?” Jiang Dacheng widened his eyes and looked at the sea of swords before him. He didn’t know what he should do.

Due to the unique properties of the land, all the swords didn’t emit the slightest bit of aura. He couldn’t tell what grade they were!

“Don’t look at them. Your dao soul and dao eye are useless in this situation. Use your sword heart to find the one that resonates with you!”

Jiang Dacheng nodded and closed his eyes. He used his sword heart to inspect every sword before him.

Huang Xiaolong did the same.

There were always rumors about someone obtaining a pseudo universe-level artifact from the Sword Grave.

With his strength, he wouldn’t care for pseudo universe-level artifacts. However, he was already there. It didn’t hurt to play around a little.

With his sword heart leading the way, Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of sword qi that started to resonate with him. The stronger the sword qi, the higher quality the sword.

Swords that had the qualifications to enter the sword grave were definitely of the creation level! Of course, most of them were low-grade creation artifacts.

The amount of sword qi contained in those swords would be several dozen thousands strands at best. Those of the mid-grade would possess hundreds of thousands of strands.

Huang Xiaolong’s sword heart wasn’t able to spread across a huge distance, but he discovered a sword that contained hundreds of millions of strands of sword qi nearby!

That had to be an absolute treasure!

The sword qi contained in the blade was sinister, and one would feel as though they dropped into hell once they came into contact with it! Was that the rumored Hell Refining Sword? He heard about the rumors when discussing the dao with Jian Wushuang in the past.

However, Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a second before continuing onwards.

The Hell Refining Sword was good, but in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, it was slightly better than a toy.

Just like that, the two of them spent more than an hour in the Sword Grave.

By that time, the Nether Yang King and the others also arrived.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong standing quietly in the distance, they heaved a sigh of relief. As long as he hadn’t made his decision, the Hell Refining Sword wouldn’t be taken away!

The other pseudo universe-level swords were definitely still present.

“We should start looking for our swords!” Jiu Yu muttered before starting his search.

“All of you can do the same.” They instructed their subordinates.

Joy filled their eyes and they started to look around themselves.

Another hour passed and another group of experts arrived.

The group consisted of another Ghost King called the Yin Horn Ghost King and his strength was shocking. He might not be as strong as Wu Zun or Jiu Yu, but he was comparable to Yu Xiaohong of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. After they arrived, they started to look for swords that suited them.

When everyone was searching, a loud yell filled the skies and sword qi shot up into the air. A blood red sword flew out of the Sword Grave and landed in Wu Zun’s hand.

Wu Zun yelled as an expression of wild joy filled his face. “Hell Refining Sword! It’s the Hell Refining Sword!”

Another ray of sword light filled the skies and swords appeared in the Nether Yang King and Jiu Yu’s hand.

Grins broke out on their faces too. “Scarlet Dragon Sword!”

“Radiant Buddha Sword!”

The two swords were also pseudo universe level treasures that were born during the creation of the universe!

The experts standing around quickly congratulated the three of them.

When wide smiles were hanging on their faces, the heavens trembled and something seemed to want to break out from the ground below.

Under their shocked gazes, the swords in the Sword Grave flew over in a certain direction!

When that happened, a pillar of light tore into the skies and a sword qi that contained the power to sunder the universe filled the skies.

“This!” The Nether Yang King, Wu Zun, and Jiu Yu gasped in unison. Comparing the sword qi in their swords to the one that just appeared was like comparing the firefly to the moon.

How could it be?! The three swords they obtained were pseudo universe-level treasures! How could there be a sword that was a thousand… No! Tens of thousands of times stronger than theirs?

Could it be?!

A sword flew into the skies when they were still second guessing themselves. The moment it appeared, the three swords that were obtained earlier fell to the ground and prostrated as though they were subjects before their king!

Hovering in the air for a second longer, the sword that emerged from the depths of the Sword Grave fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hand. A satisfied smile appeared on his face. He didn’t expect to receive such a huge surprise on his trip.
