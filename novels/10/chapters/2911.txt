Chapter 2912: Silver Moon Immortal Cave

With the patriarch of the Silver Shadow Creed at the early-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, the faction was placed firmly at the top of the power structure in the Divine Tuo Holy World. The leader of the faction was Zeng Lin, a female Dao Venerable, and she was also Yin Yue’s master.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Silver Shadow Mountain Range, it was already deep into the night.

Silver light enveloped the mountain, and it glowed gently in the darkness. The beauty of the mountain range couldn’t be described in mere words.

With his body flashing through the air, Huang Xiaolong appeared in the Silver Shadow City located at the peak of the mountain range. When he stepped into the city, he noticed that it was still bustling with activities. The structure of the city was also unique, as it was built into the mountain face. The city was layered, and there were a total of twenty layers.

Every single layer was formed by a huge swathe of land, and the area was more than enough to house several billion people.

The Silver Moon Immortal Cave was located on the sixth level, and when Huang Xiaolong finally arrived on the sixth layer, he realized that it was much busier than the previous five levels.

People filled the streets as shops were open for business even in the dead of night. Disciples of various sacred lands and creeds shuttled back and forth, and Huang Xiaolong even managed to notice disciples of the Dragon Fish Creed, Blue Lotus Creed, Ten Swords Creed, and Tempest Lightning Creed.

The part that shocked him was the fact that there were tons of disciples of the Qiao Family present!

“I’ll give up a hundred million years of my life if I manage to see Lady Yin Yue’s smile…’ A half-step Dao Venerable sighed.

“Young Lady Yin Yue rarely shows her face around here. Moreover, It’s even harder to see her smile. Anyone lucky enough to see her smiling face will never forget it as long as they live!” Another half-step Dao Venerable beside him revealed an intoxicated look when he thought about it.

“Lady Yin Yue appeared in Monarch Yu Sacred Land several years ago. Too bad we were stuck in seclusion…”

Waves after waves of discussion poured into Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

By shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. Indeed, everyone on the sixth level was there to see Yin Yue.

Previously, he had learned that there were millions of disciples requesting an audience with Yin Yue every day. He haddn’t believed the rumors, but now it seemed like everything was true!

Those who were able to meet Yin Yue were definitely the young patriarchs of the super creeds or the extremely famous beings in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

When Huang Xiaolong reached the plaza outside the Silver Moon Immortal Cave, he was greeted with a sea of disciples squeezing their way around.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the endless amount of people before him.

How in the world was he supposed to look for her?

“Fang Yucheng, the young patriarch of the Jade Orchid Creed requests an audience with Young Lady Yin Yue!” A young man standing at the entrance of the immortal cave cupped his fists at the guard and said.

“Fang Yucheng?” The disciple guarding the Silver Moon Immortal Cave sneered in disdain, “Apologies. Senior Sister Yin Yue isn’t meeting guests. Please leave.”

With an unwilling expression Fang Yucheng continued, “Fellow cultivator, I’ll have to trouble you to inform Young Lady Yin Yue that I have something urgent to speak to her about.”

“Everyone who tries to meet our senior sister use the same reason. Please leave.” After he spoke, the disciple gestured for Fang Yucheng to leave.

Fang Yucheng opened his mouth, but he failed to think of another reason to remain. In the end, he could only leave.

Everyone broke out into discussion when they noticed what had happened.

The Jade Orchid Creed might only be a small creed, but their reputation was pretty good. Whatever the case, Fang Yucheng was the young patriarch of the Jade Orchid Creed. Even someone like him, was turned away.

The disciples of many creeds and superfamilies were struck a blow after noticing Fang Yucheng’s failure.

Even so, not many people left. All of them were willing to risk rejection.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the unending flow of people, and he knew that he wouldn’t be able to reach the entrance even if he had half a month.

“Little brother, you’re just a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor… Don’t tell me you’re here to look for Young Lady Yin Yue,” a fatty at the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm approached Huang Xiaolong and said.

Even though he was slightly taken aback, Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

The fatty shook his head and tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong, “I’ll advise you to leave now. I’ve never heard of Young Lady Yin Yue accepting a visit by anyone in the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. If you didn’t notice, Fang Yucheng was a half-step Dao Venerable. Even someone like him was rejected, much less someone like you!”

“Young Lady Yin Yue requested for me to come,” Huang Xiaolong explained.

With an expression of shock on his face, mocking laughter soon left the fatty’s lips when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You’re pretty funny. Why would Young Lady Yin Yue invite a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor like yourself? Pray to tell, what is the reason you’re here for?”

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to deny anything. “I’m here to dispel the poison plaguing her mother.”

The fatty was stunned for a whole second, but the fats around his belly started to jiggle as he roared with laughter, “Young Lady Yin Yue requested for you, a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, to deal with the poison in her mother’s body?!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

According to him, Huang Xiaolong’s lies were too blatant. With Young Lady Yin Yue’s esteemed identity, there was no way she would invite a Primal Ancestor over to cure her mother. After all, even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables had failed to do so!

The people around them stared at the fatty before turning to look at Huang Xiaolong with a look of mockery in their eyes.

“Little brother, which faction do you come from?” the fatty asked.

“I’m not in any creed, and neither am I from a genesis race.”

“Don’t tell me you’re a disciple from a sacred land,” the fatty continued.

Those who had the guts to request an audience with Yin Yue were core disciples of the various creeds, or some super clan. Even if they weren’t, they had to be disciples of some hidden clan. Not a single disciple of a sacred land was worthy of meeting Yin Yue.

However, Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless when he answered their question. “That’s right. I’m a mere disciple of a tiny sacred land.”

He came from the Cangqiong Sacred Land, and it was definitely considered a small sacred land in the scheme of the Divine Tuo Holy World.

With a giggle, the fatty raised his thumbs up at Huang Xiaolong. “Little brother, I, Old Zhu, am impressed by your courage!”

“Old Zhu? Are you a pig?” Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock. He didn’t understand why someone would compare themselves to a pig.

“No! That’s not the pronunciation! It’s the other ‘Zhu’!” Fatty Zhu explained.

The crowd turned rowdy all of a sudden, and several dozen disciples wearing the robes of the Silver Shadow Creed appeared.

“That’s Chen Tianyang! Young Lady Yin Yue’s senior brother!” someone screamed.

Yin Yue’s master, Zeng Lin, had four direct disciples. Yin Yue was the youngest of them all, and Chen Tianyang was the oldest disciple. His intentions for coming were clear.

As soon as they appeared, a giant path was cleared in the plaza.

Huang Xiaolong felt that it was his chance to approach the immortal cave, and he quickly walked towards Chen Tianyang.
