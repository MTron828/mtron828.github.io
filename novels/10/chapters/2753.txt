Chapter 2754: Forming An Alliance

Omitting Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan, only twelve Primal Ancestors remained unyielded. Most of these twelve people were Tang Long and Han Mo’s subordinates.

Duan Feng’s gaze turned sharper by the second, looking at the twelve people, as he slowly spat out, “One!”

One!

“I’m willing to submit!” Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to make his move, another eight people walked out, shouting that they were willing to submit.

In the end, only four people remained.

Huang Xiaolong and everybody else’s focus fell on these four people. These four people were Tang Long and Han Mo’s subordinates.

One of them looked at Huang Xiaolong and laughed towards the sky, “Huang Xiaolong, do you feel this is strange that there are people who refuse to yield and submit to you.”

“We have followed Master Tang Long for many years, battling everywhere, and managing Tang Dragon Sacred Land together. It’s not an exaggeration to say that we’re life and death brothers. You want us to submit to you, what a joke?! You defeated us today, but there will be a day when all of you and Huang Xiaolong, will become the prey of other sacred lands’ prey just the same!” Another person sneered and mocked. He then looked at the Primal Ancestors who had submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

“So, Huang Xiaolong, don’t feel too happy about it. Who knows, one day, your end will be more miserable than us!”

These two people seemed to be fearless as they mocked Huang Xiaolong and those who had submitted to him as harshly as they could.

Huang Xiaolong’s placid tone rang, “I admire that you are loyal to Tang Long, but you’re mistaken about one point.”

Huang Xiaolong blurred into a flicker, arriving in front of the four almost instantaneously, and he smashed their bodies with one punch.

As for the point that these four people were mistaken about, Huang Xiaolong did not clarify.

“Although I admire your loyalty, my enemies only have one ending!” Huang Xiaolong’s tone was inviolable.

Coming so far, Huang Xiaolong had never been soft-handed towards his enemies.

After watching Huang Xiaolong kill the four experts without the slightest hesitation, the experts, who had submitted and watched from a distance, felt their hearts stop for a second.

Huang Xiaolong collected the four dao souls and threw them into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

“Alright, it’s you guys now,” Huang Xiaolong said as he looked at the four thousand plus True Saints from the three sacred lands.

To Huang Xiaolong, it didn’t matter whether these four thousand people decided to submit or not. Of course, if they chose the first option, it would be good, if not, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill them all.

Obviously, Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others could handle these people.

The three sacred lands’ four thousand plus True Saints were already frightened senseless after witnessing Huang Xiaolong destroy Tang Long, Han Mo, Chu Yifan, and capture Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the others. Watching Huang Xiaolong kill the four Primal Ancestors with one punch was the last straw for them.

Now that Huang Xiaolong had spoken, people immediately walked out in batches, crying that they would submit to him.

Even before ten seconds had passed, half of the number had already submitted.

The remaining half soon submitted in several groups.

Two minutes later, the three sacred lands’ four thousand plus True Saints had all chosen to submit.

Zhu Xu and other sacred lands’ experts sighed inwardly at this result, but deep down, they admitted that if they had been in these True Saints’ shoes, they would have made the same choice.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold face eased slightly after seeing that all the True Saints had chosen to submit. Once that was taken care of, he proceeded to brand the eighty-plus Primal Ancestors’ dao souls with his soul mark.

As for these True Saints, Huang Xiaolong ordered them to swear an oath on the grand dao.

Cangqiong Old Man watched everything from the side as his disciple easily wrapped up the three sacred lands’ Primal Ancestors and True Saints. He felt mixed emotions, like shock, comfort, happiness, and thrill.

Looking at his disciple, he felt proud. What merit did I accumulate to be able to accept a disciple like Huang Xiaolong?

Wang Xueru and the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s experts stared at Huang Xiaolong with feverish, starry eyes filled with reverence. They really wanted to prostrate to Huang Xiaolong.

Whereas, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on Zhu Xu, and the experts spectating from the far distance.

“All who have come are our guests. Since you all are here in our Cangqiong Sacred Land, please come in and have a seat. I have a feast prepared,” said Huang Xiaolong.

These people, who had been feeling apprehensive, paled visibly upon hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Have a feast prepared? No doubt, this was a banquet set with unfavorable intentions towards them.

Once they entered Cangqiong City, it would be harder for them to exit, but if they refused to do so, they might very well meet with the same fate as Tang Long.

“Lord Huang, I, I, I have some matters left unattended, so, I…” one of the sacred lands’ experts stammered weakly as he looked at Huang Xiaolong furtively.

“You want to leave?” Huang Xiaolong’s face sank immediately, and a sharp murderous aura surged around him as he locked onto that expert.

Sensing Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent locked onto him, the expert nearly jumped out of his skin in fright. He hurriedly denied, “No, not at all, I don’t mean that. Receiving an invitation from Lord Huang is my honor. My matters are merely small matters. They can be put off till later, so I’m in no hurry to leave at all.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, and then looked at Zhu Xu and the rest. He spoke every word clearly, “Everyone, please.”

Huang Xiaolong did not want news of his strength leaked out, causing the surrounding sacred lands’ vigilance. Therefore, Zhu Xu and these people couldn’t be allowed to leave just yet.

Not to mention, he had already decided to loop these sacred lands into his camp, and when that happened, conflict with Zhu Xu and the others was bound to rise. In that case, he planned to settle everything on this day itself!

All-Heavens Sacred Land’s Master Zhu Xu, and the others understood Huang Xiaolong’s intention. Then again, even if they understood that, the murderous aura from Huang Xiaolong left them with no option, but to enter the Cangqiong City.

After entering the Cangqiong City, the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples prepared a big banquet. Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man took the main seats. Originally, Cangqiong Old Man had wanted Huang Xiaolong to sit at the top alone, however, Huang Xiaolong insisted and pulled Cangqiong Old Man with him.

The wine served at the banquet was excellent wine, something Cangqiong Old Man had preciously kept for a long time. However, the wine tasted bland in Zhu Xu’s and the other experts’ mouths, in fact, they even found it a little bitter. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

When everyone had feasted their share, Huang Xiaolong spoke, “I arrived in the Divine Tuo Holy World only a few days ago. I have heard from my master that there are many sacred lands’ alliances in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. These sacred lands’ alliances share good and bad times together, and they have been developing well. So, I think that it is a good choice for Cangqiong Sacred Land to form an alliance with various sacred lands’ patriarchs here. We can co-exist and benefit from each other, what do you all think?”

There were tens of thousands of sacred lands in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, however, many of them had already grouped and formed alliances. According to Huang Xiaolong’s understanding, there were currently more than a dozen sacred lands’ alliances in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. The bigger alliances had several hundred sacred land members, and the smaller alliances had a dozen sacred land members.”

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong wanted to emulate this method, and form a sacred lands alliance.

Of course, it was a disguise to have these sacred lands submitted to Cangqiong Sacred Land by forming an alliance. Using this method to subjugate these sacred lands was easier for them to accept.

As expected, when Huang Xiaolong spoke these words, Zhu Xu and other sacred lands’ patriarchs were stunned, and their expressions were a myriad of sights.

A total of eleven sacred lands’ patriarchs had paid a visit to Cangqiong Sacred Land. If the sacred lands, who had participated in besieging Huang Xiaolong, were excluded, there were still six sacred lands’ patriarchs present at the banquet. Zhu Xu and the others exchanged a glance, but no one took the initiative to speak.
