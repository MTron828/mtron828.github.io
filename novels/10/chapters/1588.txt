Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The ancient seal glowed brightly with a might much stronger than the Great Brightness Palm. However, it buzzed and dissipated immediately when Lei Budong’s divine lightning came into contact with it. A giant explosion occurred and the thousands of angels that formed were destroyed with a single hit.

Ancestor Peng Xingfei was then forced to retreat from the impact, resulting in him and the rest of the members of the Brightness Emperor Palace smashing into the walls of the inner palace.

Naturally, the elders and core disciples from the Grandmist Emperor Palace weren’t spared either and were also knocked into the walls of the Inner Palace.

Even though Lei Budong was just a peak early-Fourth Order Emperor like Ancestor Peng Xingfei from the Brightness Emperor Palace, he was from the Barbarian Race and his combat strength was way higher than Peng Xingfei.

Lei Budong’s divine lightning didn’t stop there. It raged upon the surroundings.

In the Inner Palace, the experts from the various palaces who were invited by the Grandmist Emperor Palace were shocked when they sensed the formidable power coming from outside.

“What’s going on? Is someone attacking the Grandmist Emperor Palace?”

“Wouldn’t they be courting death...!”

“Let’s go take a look!”

The powerful experts from the various palaces slowly emerged from the inner palace.

However, when they came out and saw the state of Peng Xingfei, Sun Bin, Wu Tianhe, Tian Ziyi, and the rest, their jaws dropped.

Who would have expected Wu Tianhe, the grand elder sent by the Grandmist Emperor Palace to be beaten up by someone?

Soon, everyone’s gazes landed on Huang Xiaolong and Lei Budong.

Without a doubt, he was the one who had caused everything to happen.

“Who’s this kid?!”

“Huang Xiaolong!”

“Huang Xiaolong? Fortune Emperor Palace’s king of supreme godhead?”

“Seems like it!”

Many of the Elders from different palaces recognized Huang Xiaolong and exclaimed.

“It really is Huang Xiaolong! Was he also invited by the Grandmist Emperor Palace? How did he end up fighting with the people from the Brightness Emperor Palace and Grand Elder Wu Tianhe?”

“Who knows? Whatever it is, we are definitely in for a good show! How do you think the Grandmist Emperor Palace will punish Huang Xiaolong? Even though Huang Xiaolong has the king of supreme godhead, as the number one palace in the Divine World, the Grandmist Emperor Palace will definitely not allow anyone to wreak havoc here. If they do not punish Huang Xiaolong today, others will think they are a joke if word gets out!”

“Did the guy beside Huang Xiaolong send Peng Xingfei and the rest flying? Isn’t he comparable to Fifth Order Emperor Realm experts? He’s definitely not from the Fortune Emperor Palace! His inner strength seems pretty weird as well... Ancestor Wang Qing, are you able to tell his origins?”

A wave of discussion erupted amongst the crowd as everyone tried to guess the identities of Lei Budong and Feng Chen.

Even though there were many ancestors from various Emperor Palaces, none of them were able to recognize the Barbarian Race.

Huang Xiaolong felt a little shocked when he saw the lineup of experts invited by the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

From various emperor palaces to powerful individuals in the Emperor realm... From the looks of it, there were at least thirty of such outstanding individuals present.

Why did the Grandmist Emperor Palace invite so many experts?!

Was it possible that the Grandmist Emperor Palace was holding an apprenticeship ceremony like the Fortune Emperor Palace had done in the past?

Just then, a breaking voice came crashing from the horizon. “Who dares to behave outrageously at my Grandmist Emperor Palace!” A great might reverberated through the minds of everyone present.

“It must be an ancestor from the Grandmist Emperor Palace! He probably came after noticing the disturbance...”

“I wonder which ancestor has come this time. From the pressure he is emitting, he should be at the Seventh Order or higher.”

Everyone turned to look at the source of the voice and a look of shock appeared on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong, Lei Budong, and the rest of them also turned around.

Yao Chi leaned towards Huang Xiaolong’s body with a face full of worry. Even the always confident Li Lu seemed to waver a little as she grabbed his arm. She never thought that things would spiral out of control so quickly.

“Xiaolong, should we leave now?!” Li Lu couldn’t help but panic.

The little cow laughed heartlessly, “Little lass, do you think we are able to leave now?”

Li Lu was stunned.

Huang Xiaolong held Li Lu’s little hand and reassured her, “Don’t worry, the little cow is here to resolve it.”

The little cow opened her mouth in shock. “What are you talking about?! I didn’t cause this?!”

“Haha, you’re responsible for this because you’re a cow.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Cow!

Both Li Lu and Yao Chi laughed uncontrollably. Huang Xiaolong’s relaxed attitude seemed to allow them both to loosen up a little.

Wu Tianhe scrambled to his feet and wiped the blood off the corners of his mouth. He laughed loudly, to the extent that it sounded psychotic and said sarcastically, “Huang Xiaolong, you are the first person who dared to injure a grand elder from the Grandmist Emperor Palace inside the palace itself! How are you still able to joke around? Actually, I’m pretty impressed by your courage.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Thank you.”

Thank you?

Everyone felt their heads exploding at the moment.

A few of the experts shook their heads.

Even though they didn’t know why Huang Xiaolong was able to crack jokes when facing an ancestor of the Grandmist Emperor Palace, they knew that his ending would be a gruesome one for sure. In the entire Divine World, no one would be willing to protect Huang Xiaolong anymore.

Who would dare go against the Grandmist Emperor Palace?

That would be simply digging their own grave!

Even when the Fiend God Emperor Palace had unified all the palaces and brought carnage and terror to the entire Divine World back then, they hadn’t dared to provoke the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

All of a sudden, everyone felt their vision going blurry as two figures appeared out of thin air and stood before all of them. It wasn’t just a single ancestor who had rushed over... There were two of them!

Everyone felt a little startled when they saw the two figures standing before them.

“It’s the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Zhang Renjie and Han Qing! Both of them are Eighth Order Emperor Realm experts!”

The elders from the various palaces were shocked and quickly went up to greet the two ancestors.

Wu Tianhe was delighted and bowed respectfully to Zhang Renjie and Han Qing along with the disciples from the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

When Huang Xiaolong heard Wu Tianhe greet Zhang Renjie as ‘Master’, he frowned a little.

Before he could react, Zhang Renjie and Han Qing turned around to look at him.

“Who are you? What’s going on?” Zhang Renjie didn’t immediately try to capture Huang Xiaolong. Instead, he asked amicably. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Master, he is the Fortune Emperor Palace’s king of supreme godhead disciple, Huang Xiaolong!” Wu Tianhe answered. He then proceeded to explain, “Previously, when we met him at the Perfect Galaxy, he snatched the Earth Bear from us and injured all of us! Now, he has come over to the Grandmist Emperor Palace to do the same thing!”
