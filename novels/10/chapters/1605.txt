“This...” The king of grandmist frowned.

Jiang Hong spoke up to warn him, “Junior Brother, it’s your first time going to Hell and you don’t know the dangers there. Moreover, you are only a God King. If you go alone, you will be placed in an extremely dangerous situation!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head resolutely, “Master, Senior Brother, I’ve already made my decision. I’m going alone.”

Xiang Xun and the others had always been following Huang Xiaolong, and whenever he met with danger, they would step out and solve all his problems. He always felt that it was detrimental for his development.

As such, he decided to head over to Hell alone.

After speaking of his reasoning to the king of grandmist and Jiang Hong, the both of them stared at each other in silence.

“Kiddo Huang, if you head over to Hell alone, you’ll take forever to travel around the place. I’ll follow you.” The little cow said all of a sudden

Huang Xiaolong turned to her and explained, “Didn’t you plan on regaining your strength by cultivating in the grandmist pool? Moreover, you still need to repair your divine soul.”

The little cow was stunned for a moment. It had slipped her mind that those were her original intentions.

Despite the amount of time that had passed since her reincarnation, she hadn’t been able to recover her damaged divine sense. In order to recover, she required the aid of someone who had comparable prowess to herself from her past life. Now that the king of grandmist was present, he would be able to assist her in regaining her damaged divine soul. With the aid of the grandmist pool, she would be able to recover much quicker.

The little cow finally relented but she raised a condition of her own. “Fine, you can go alone, but you can’t find other women when you’re there.”

The king of grandmist, Jiang Hong, Li Tong, and everyone present were stunned.

Huang Xiaolong’s face flushed red and he glared at the little cow.

“Hehe, I’ve been to Hell in the past and there’s an extremely amazing brew of wine there. It’s called the Yin Yang Separation Wine. Can you bring some back when you return?”

Huang Xiaolong was shocked speechless. This little cow still remembers the taste of the wine she had when she had last visited Hell...

“The Yin Yang Separation Wine is extremely famous in Hell. You’ll be able to get some in some of the larger divine planes there.” As though she was afraid Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t get some with the excuse of not knowing where to buy it, the little cow hastily explained.

Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered looking at the little cow and he turned his head away.

“Xiaolong, when do you plan to leave?” The king of grandmist asked all of a sudden. Since Huang Xiaolong was adamant about going alone, there was no need to persuade him any longer.

It was as he had said, going alone would allow him to better temper himself.

Moreover, it was evident to him that Huang Xiaolong’s luck was unparalleled through the heavens. People who possessed such luck wouldn’t fall easily.

“This disciple plans to leave in a year.” Huang Xiaolong replied after thinking about it for a moment.

In the following year, Huang Xiaolong decided to train himself in the Grandmist Lands. He wanted to solidify his foundations. Since his master was here, he could also gain some insights from the old man himself. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Since he was going to Hell to train himself, it didn’t matter if he went there a year or two later.

“That’s good.” The king of grandmist revealed a smile and continued, “You can listen to my lectures in the following year and ask me if you face any difficulties when cultivating.”

“Yes, master.” Huang Xiaolong replied with respect and turned to look at Li Lu and Yao Chi who were still busy refining the grandmist fruit. “Master, as for Li Lu and Yao Chi...”

“You don’t have to worry about them. I will station Li Tong and the others here to protect them. Nothing will happen to them. However, I’m afraid it will take several tens of thousands of years for them to refine the grandmist fruit.”

“Several... several tens of thousands of years?!” Huang Xiaolong’s jaws dropped in shock.

The king of grandmist laughed and explained, “Do you think they’re like you? No one other than you will be able to refine a grandmist fruit in several years! Speaking of which, don’t you think you’re too wasteful?! You merely broke through to the peak of the late-Seventh Order God King Realm from the peak of the late-Sixth Order God King Realm! After they refine the grandmist fruit, they will probably break through to the God King Realm! It’s even possible for Li Lu to directly enter the middle stages of the God King Realm!”

Even though the cultivation of the two ladies had risen extremely quickly in the Fortune Emperor Palace, Yao Chi was merely at the early stages of the Ancestor God Realm and Li Lu was at the Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

To be able to break through to the God King Realm in several tens of thousands of years was a stunning feat.

After all, the two ladies didn’t have heaven defying talent for cultivation.

“This... Master, don’t you think that several tens of thousands of years is too long?” Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before asking, “Is there any way for you to hasten the process?”

The king of grandmist turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong and said seriously, “I can arrange a formation to speed up the time in the space they are in. They might be able to finish refining it in five to six thousand years. It’s even possible for them to be done in a thousand years or so. However, they will be unable to borrow the power of the tree qi from the grandmist spiritual trees and the spirit qi in the fruit tree garden. The effects of the grandmist fruit will definitely be diminished.”

Huang Xiaolong felt a weight lifted off his chest when he heard his master’s idea. It didn’t really matter. After all, speeding up the process had its advantages. They didn’t need to sit idle for several tens of thousands of years and he didn’t need to stare at them from a distance.

According to Huang Xiaolong’s wishes, his master arranged a formation to accelerate the time in the space they were in.

After arranging the formation, all of them left the fruit tree garden and the king of grandmist left two people behind as their guards.

Thus began Huang Xiaolong’s life in the Grandmist Lands.

In the day, he would head over to listen to the king of grandmist’s lectures with Li Tong and the rest. The moment he discovered any doubts, Huang Xiaolong would clarify it with his master immediately.

When night fell, Huang Xiaolong would swallow a high-grade grandmist spiritual pill before starting to cultivate.

Occasionally, he would flip open the Tianwu Array Records and would ask his master and senior brother about some of the questions he had.

As for the fourth restriction on the Netherworld King’s Jade, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a rush to break it.

The lesser the number of people who knew about the Netherworld King’s Jade the better it was. Even though his master and Jiang Hong would never betray him, he decided to refine the fourth restriction when he left the Grandmist Lands.

In a flash, a year passed.

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t manage to break into the Eighth Order God King Realm in the span of this one year, his divine soul and mental state rose to a whole new level after attending his master’s lectures. As for the art of arrays, he improved by leaps and bounds. He managed to reach the grand completion of the second level in a year.

......

A flying ship soared through the Grandmist Galaxy and it was precisely the Dragon Shark Flying Ship.

After staying in the Grandmist Lands for a year, Huang Xiaolong left for Hell by himself.

As soon as he left the Grandmist Galaxy, Huang Xiaolong started to think about his next course of action. He steered the Dragon Shark Flying Ship towards the Desolate Era divine plane as he planned to look for somewhere to refine the fourth set of restrictions in the Netherworld King’s Jade before heading over to Hell. Of course, he also planned to look for the Desolate Era’s Black Dragon Race’s three treasures after refining the restriction.

Two days later, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship arrived and stopped in the space above the Desolate Era divine plane.

Huang Xiaolong’s divine soul stretched outwards and he quickly confirmed the direction. He charged towards the ruins of the Black Dragon Race.

After several days, he arrived at his destination and after digging a hole several tens of thousands of feet deep, he jumped into it without hesitation. After arranging dozens of restrictions above him, he finally relaxed and took out the Netherworld King’s Jade.
