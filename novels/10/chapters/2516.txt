Chapter 2517: Embarrassment!

Countless experts from the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds came over to congratulate Huang Xiaolong.

The news of Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul had spread through the Holy World long before he left the City of Light.

If Huang Xiaolong’s prestige had reached an all-time high for a period of time after revealing his three saint godheads during the battle in the Mirage Pavilion, then the news of his holy soul had broken his all-time record!

As a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint, he hadn’t even entered the True Saint Realm, and he had managed to possess a holy soul. That was something people had never seen before in the Holy World! The very appearance of his holy soul shocked everyone!

“Your Highness!”

“Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong!”

Experts lined the skies, and they screamed with all their might as soon as he appeared.

There were even some who screamed, “Your Highness Hung Xiaolong is Invincible under the heavens!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Their voices pierced into the skies and shook the eardrums of anyone who heard them.

The scene caused the hearts of Shi Feng and the others to shake. This was the first time they had ever seen such an awe-inspiring sight.

Even Tyrant Chu was taken aback.

With a smile on his face, Tyrant Chu chuckled, “This is the first time so many people have come over to welcome a single person. It seems like you’re more popular than me now!”

Huang Xiaolong had no idea what to say when he heard what his master said.

As for Li Chen, the look in his eyes was dark, and he scowled when he heard the cheers from the crowd.

When they finally arrived before the members of the Holy Heavens, Wu Ge led everyone and they bowed to Tyrant Chu.

With a nod, he allowed them to rise.

After the welcome ceremony was done, Tyrant Chu, Huang Xiaolong, and the others returned towards the Holy Heavens City.

As soon as they returned, Huang Xiaolong and Li Chen went straight to meet the four Primal Ancestors. When the Heavenly Master, Lord Long, and Elder Crow saw Huang Xiaolong, a look of unbridled joy appeared on their faces. They didn’t even spare Li Chen a second glance.

Upon noticing the cold treatment from the four Primal Ancestors, Li Chen couldn’t help but feel a sense of irritation in his heart.

When they were done speaking to Huang Xiaolong, they finally turned to face Li Chen to offer him several words of encouragement.

One long hour later, Huang Xiaolong and Li Chen left the Primal Ancestors’ space. As they returned to the city, they didn’t speak to each other. When they finally left, they didn’t spare a glance at the other party, and they returned to their respective manors.

However, Huang Xiaolong did remember to remind Li Chen, “Don’t forget that you have to carry out your end of the bet within twenty-four hours.” In the City of Light, Huang Xiaolong had agreed to give them twenty-four hours to gather whatever holy artifacts they had lost to him. They were also supposed to kneel in front of the Blue Dragon Manor for an entire day.

Without replying, Li Chen glared at Huang Xiaolong before leaving.

By the time Huang Xiaolong returned, there were tons of people waiting for him. Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, Xue Qi, Ji Cai, and the others were overjoyed when he stepped through the gates.

An air of festivities filled the manor.

Di Huai was especially happy. He suggested inviting the various experts over for a feast, and Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement. Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, and the others rushed out to prepare a celebratory feast for Huang Xiaolong the moment they got the nod.

The only thing Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect was the attendance. Even if he counted the True Saint Realm experts who arrived, there were nearly a hundred thousand of them! The Blue Dragon Manor was filled to the brim, and people couldn’t even move about without bumping into each other.

As for those who weren’t invited, they didn’t give up as they filled up the streets outside the manor.

Huang Xiaolong jumped in fright when he saw such a scene.

In stark contrast, Li Chen’s manor was so empty that tumbleweeds were rolling about.

Since he had managed to obtain the third spot in the Trial of Blood, he had organized a banquet the moment he had returned. However, not a single person turned up! When he heard from Xie Yao that Huang Xiaolong’s manor was filled to the brim, unbridled killing intent erupted from his eyes.

“HUANG XIAOLONG!” Li Chen raged under his breath.

“Senior Brother Li Chen, about the bet…” Xie Yao was extremely worried about the conclusion as the deadline of the bet was the very next day.

Upon glancing at Xie Yao from the corner of his eye, Li Chen snarled, “I’ve already ordered for all the disciples under us to beg their respective masters. They should join hands and beg for mercy on our behalf to the four Primal Ancestors. As soon as day breaks tomorrow, I will look for my master.”

Soon after, Li Chen, Xie Yao, Lin Yijia, and the others made several plans before leaving.

…

When dawn broke the next day, Di Huai looked for Huang Xiaolong and reported the alliance between the several hundred disciples.

“All of them were encouraged by Li Chen. I’ve also heard that Li Chen went to look for Lord Long to beg for mercy. According to them, none of them have any holy artifacts on them. They plan to hand them over when they gather all the holy artifacts available.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle, “Hand them over when they have gathered all the artifacts? Li Chen’s pretty sly…” He turned to Di Huai and continued, “What else?”

“Xie Yao also went to beg his master, Grand Hall Master Wu Ge, to implore the four Primal Ancestors to call off the bet. However, Wu Ge slapped him mercilessly as soon as the request left his lips.” Di Huai roared with laughter when he recalled what he had heard. “Xie Yao probably looks like a pig head now that he was slapped by Wu Ge.”

“His face is so swollen that no one recognizes him.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly.

“As for the disciples who went to beg their masters on Li Chen’s order, they were thrown into jail by the members of the law enforcement hall.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

Half a day later, Li Chen, Xie Yao, Lin Yijia, and those who had made the bet, obediently went over to the Blue Dragon Manor to hand over the holy artifacts. Under the curious gaze of everyone present, they kneeled at the gates of the manor.

As the leader of the holy princes in the Holy Heavens, Li Chen’s actions drew a large crowd to Huang Xiaolong’s manor.

Under the mockery of those present, Li Chen and the others wanted to dig a hole in the ground and hide their faces in it. They lowered their heads to the ground, and waves rolled in their hearts.

That was the day Li Chen and the others would remember as long as they lived.

Li Chen had no idea how the day passed, but dusk fell eventually.

One day later, all of them used a secret art to disappear from the entrance of the Blue Dragon Manor.

“Your Highness, Li Chen will probably hate you for this. When the Cangqiong Holy Manor opens, he will definitely think of ways to get back at you.” Di Huai was obviously able to feel the terrifying killing intent hidden in Li Chen’s eyes before he left.
