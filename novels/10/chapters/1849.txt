When Xing Yinuo saw how the Hundred Transformation Sect’s members left, she couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. “Father, are we really not going to snatch the Devil Holy Water?”

She felt that the alliance with the Hundred Transformation Sect was sure to take place. However, reality proved her wrong.

Xing Tian laughed. “Even though the Devil Holy Water really tempts me, we need to know who we’re up against. No matter how much I want to snatch the hundred drops of Devil Holy Water, I will never do something I have no confidence in.”

Xing Yinuo and the other experts felt their jaws dropping to the ground.

Could it be that even the strongest of the Archdevil Ancestors had no confidence in taking that black-haired youth down?!

“Father, are the people around that black-haired man really that strong?!” Xing Yinuo asked in disbelief.

A solemn expression finally appeared on Xing Tian’s face as he nodded his head. “Extremely strong.”

These two words seemed to crush down on the hearts of all the ancestors present in the hall.

“Does father know the true identity of the black-haired youth?” Xing Yinuo couldn’t help but ask again.

Xing Tian shook his head, and he wasn’t able to confirm his guess. “I cannot be sure, but we’ll know soon.”

All the ancestors in the hall looked at each other in disbelief.

“Even if we refuse to make a move, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor and Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor will try to snatch it.”

“All of them are stuck at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, and they have already lost their true self in the pursuit of power.” Xing Tian shook his head. “However, even if they ally, they’ll be wasting their time.”

“Enough. This topic ends here.” Xing Tian’s tone changed, and he asked Xing Yinuo, “Nuo’er the opening of the Devil Tower spells a once in a lifetime opportunity. You have to give it everything you got. Climb to the highest possible floor...”

“Father, you can rest assured that I will.” Xing Yinuo nodded her head, and a solemn expression appeared on her face.

“How high do you think you can go?” Xing Tian asked.

After pondering over it for a little while, Xing Yinuo explained. “The seventh floor won’t be a problem. I have a little confidence in climbing up to the eighth floor, but the ninth will be extremely difficult!”

The ninth floor was where the Heavenless Archdevil Lord had reached in the past, and no one else had ever climbed that high ever since. No matter how high Xing Yinuo felt her talent was, she knew that she had zero chance.

Xing Tian sighed. “Difficult doesn’t begin to describe the ascend to the ninth floor.”

In the past, he had also tried to ascend the Devil Tower. However, he had to use all the strength in his body just to arrive on the eighth floor!

“This time, there might be someone who manages to climb to the ninth floor...” Xing Tian muttered to himself.

When they heard the soft whisper, all the ancestors in the hall felt a bomb going off in their head.

“Lord Archdevil Ancestor, are you saying that Chen Weijian has a chance of arriving at the ninth floor?!” Li Yu exclaimed in shock.

To their surprise, Xing Tian shook his head. “Even though Chen Weijian might be more talented than Nuo’er, the highest he will go is the eighth floor. He can’t reach the ninth floor.”

Everyone stared at the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor in shock. They could have never expected for the person he was referring to be someone other than Chen Weijian.

“Father, is there someone more talented than Chen Weijian in the younger generation?!” Xing Yinuo revealed a look of suspicion as she questioned her father.

Xing Tian chuckled and a mysterious smile formed on his face. “You’ll know when it happens.”

Everyone became even more curious about the ‘talent’s’ identity.

However, the figure of the black-haired young man flashed through Xing Yinuo’s mind subconsciously. Could it be him?! She shook her head to clear her mind. It’s impossible.

After more than an hour, Chen Jianwei left the residences of the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor and Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor with a smile on his face.

He had finally managed to convince the two of them to form an alliance with him!

From that moment on, the three of them would move whatever resources they could and combine their strength. In half a day, they would gather and make a move against Huang Xiaolong!

Half a day passed in a flash.

The three superpowers gathered all their strength. Under the leadership of the two Archdevil Ancestors, the Black Killer Sect, Exquisite Sea City, and thirty other superpowers were dragged into their plan. There was almost no need to mention that all the powers they had dragged in ranked in the top one hundred in the Devil World.

Right before they could arrive at Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard, Eternal Devil City shook.

Chen Weijian and the others felt as though a thunderbolt struck their minds.

A brilliant light rose from the north side of the city, and the light pierced through the nine heavens.

“This...” Chen Weijian stared at the light in shock, but joy filled his mind in the next instant. “The Devil Tower has opened!”

He was right. The Devil Tower had indeed unsealed itself. The resplendent rays of light emitted by the tower filled the lands, and everyone in Eternal Devil City watched as it rose from the ground.

Countless experts threw the plan to the back of their minds as they swarmed towards the tower.

“Senior Stone Ape, Senior Violent Lightning, the Devil Tower has opened. We can only carry out our plan to kill that brat after the event...” Chen Weijian turned to the two Archdevil Ancestors and apologized.

The two of them nodded their heads.

“It’s fine. We’ll take care of him after settling matters with the Devil Tower.” The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor wasn’t able to stop everyone, and he could only agree.

The second the Devil Tower appeared, everyone lost the motivation to deal with Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Weijian and the others changed their direction of flight as they shot towards the Devil Tower.

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning were very excited when they realized that the Devil Tower was open. However, Huang Xiaolong was still refining the Devil Holy Water. No matter how anxious they were, they could only wait.

When the next day arrived, Huang Xiaolong finally emerged from his cultivation session. The two of them hastily went up to him and reported about the Devil Tower.

“The Devil Tower is open!” A brilliant light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Yes, Your Majesty, the tower opened after you entered seclusion cultivation again in the afternoon. Almost everyone in Eternal Devil City is gathered there.” Words came out of Gao Changran’s mouth like bullets. “I’ve heard that Chen Weijian managed to reach the second level one hour ago.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Chen Weijian’s talent is pretty good...”

Huang Xiaolong knew little when it came to ascending the tower. There weren’t more than a handful of people who had managed to climb to the second floor on the first day of the tower’s opening.

When Gao Changran saw the indifferent expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile. The Emperor hasn’t panicked, but the eunuchs have already lost their minds.

“Your Majesty, will we be heading there now?”

“Let’s go.” When Huang Xiaolong saw the anxious expression on Gao Changran’s face, he laughed. “Don’t worry. No matter how high Chen Weijian’s talent is, he can’t arrive at the ninth level.”

After a few hours...

The few of them finally arrived at the tower that pierced through the clouds.

They could see black dots surrounding the tower, and it was apparent that the experts in Eternal Devil City formed the sea of black around the tower.

Like Gao Changran had said, nearly all the experts in Eternal Devil City had made their way there.

For latecomers like Huang Xiaolong, they couldn’t push their way to the tower unless they had overwhelming strength. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong ignored them all and charged through the skies with the four odd beasts.
