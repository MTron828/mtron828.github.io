"Eight... Low grade-eight spirit stones!" Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng exclaimed as they stared at the pile of several thousand low grade-eight spirit stones, and their eyeballs nearly dropped out of their sockets.

Up until now, only the little cow had been aware of the fact that Huang Xiaolong could condense spirit stones through spiritual energy from the void. Therefore, Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng were dumbstruck as they watched a pile of low-grade eight spirit stones appear out of nowhere.

“Don’t use high grade-seven spirit stones to fuel the Giant Shark Flying Ship anymore. Instead, use these low grade-eight spirit stones!” Huang Xiaolong said to both of them.

Both were dumbstruck once again.

“Mas-Master, did you say, u-use these low grade-eight spirit stones to fuel the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s core formation?!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng gulped loudly and asked for confirmation.

These were low grade-eight spirit stones ahh⸺!

Needless to say, grade-eight spirit stones were rare in the Divine World. Even big families’ God King Realm masters would keep any grade-eight spirit stones for cultivation, rarely willing to spend them.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong was actually asking them to use grade-eight spirit stones to fuel the flying ship!

What a waste!

What extravagance!

This was it! This was wasteful! This was extravagant!!

Even Xiang Xun couldn’t help having the same feeling.

Huang Xiaolong grinned seeing Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng’s dumbstruck expressions, and said, “In the future, you can tell me how many low grade-eight spirit stones you need, and don’t worry about them running out of supply!” As he said this, he reached out into the void once again, and pieces of low grade-eight spirit stones rained down from the void.

Huang Xiaolong’s continued to condense low grade-eight spirit stones, and they kept raining down from the void.

A few hours later...

Almost every corner of the flying ship’s control hall was filled with low grade-eight spirit stones before Huang Xiaolong stopped.

Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng were agape staring at their surrounding low grade-spirit stones.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s heart quivered nonstop.

Huang Xiaolong said to the two of them, “Take half of these low grade-eight spirit stones for your own use, and use the rest to fuel the flying ship.”

Take half of them to use!

At this point, even Xiang Xun was trembling uncontrollably.

“Mas-Master, are you giving half of these for our use?” Xiang Xun asked.

Huang Xiaolong laughed seeing the expressions on their faces and said, “You two heard right, you can take half of these for your use, and use the other half to fuel the flying ship. Half of the low grade-eight spirit stones here should be enough to last us until the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, right?”

“Definitely enough to reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds!” Xiang Xun replied with confidence.

Huang Xiaolong added, “Wait until we’ve reached the Royal Buddha Great Worlds; I will give both of you higher grade spirit stones for cultivation. So, there is no need to worry about running out of these spirit stones."

Higher grade spirit stones!

The two God King Realm masters were stupefied as they thought to themselves, ‘could it, be mid-grade eight spirit stones!’

Huang Xiaolong turned and left the control hall.

The little cow, Feng Er, and others were each cultivating inside respective cultivation rooms, thus Huang Xiaolong did not interrupt their cultivation. He returned to his cultivation room and continued cultivating.

Huang Xiaolong released the one thousand plus magic beasts, ghosts, and evil spirits that he had subjugated at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to let them cultivate inside the remaining cultivation rooms. After all, there were a lot of cultivation rooms left inside the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

The Giant Shark Flying Ship was a top-grade chaos flying ship, and cultivating inside the flying ship yielded better results as compared to the Xumi Temple.

Sitting cross-legged inside cultivation room number one, Huang Xiaolong once again summoned his three avatars and formed a four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation. Then, he took out his sixth Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit and began refining it.

By the time Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars circulated their godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to refine the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s fire element energy, Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng finally recovered their senses in the control hall.

“This, is this real?” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng stared at the piles of low grade-eight spirit stones around him and asked Xiang Xun, still doubting that he was dreaming.

Xiang Xun stepped up with doubt in his eyes, and raised one foot and stepped onto one of the low grade-eight spirit stones. Noises came from under Xiang Xun’s foot, but the stones were still intact when he lifted his foot.

“It’s real!” Xiang Xun sucked in a breath of cold air, then answered.

The hall fell into silence.... A dozen minutes later...

Fueled by low grade-eight spirit stones, the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s speed increased further. It turned into a streak of light across the space, carrying Huang Xiaolong and the others towards the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

In the vast starry space, the Giant Shark Flying Ship continued to fly onwards; leaving one world surface after another behind them, and these world surfaces grew smaller than a grain of sand with the distance.

Inside cultivation room number one, Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars were devouring the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s fire element energy every second, every minute.

By the time Huang Xiaolong refined his eighth Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit, he could no longer feel any scorching pain and adapt to the fire element energy right away. This was perhaps due to the accumulated fire phoenix spirits’ fire element energy inside his body.

...

Two years passed by in the blink of an eye.

On this day, inside cultivation room number one, the fiery Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit in front of Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars dimmed gradually, and finally the whole fruit disappeared from the world.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong stopped cultivating.

Close to two years of cultivation, he and his three avatars had finally finished refining the remaining thirteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.

He had won eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits from the auction, but now, they were consumed completely and not even their skins remained.

Huang Xiaolong used his divine sense check internally and found that after refining eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, whether it were his internal organs, three supreme godheads, or his True Dragon Physique, all had strengthened significantly. There was also a faint flow of fire element energy throughout his body.

This was the phoenix power that had emerged in Huang Xiaolong’s body after refining eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, and it could increase the power of Huang Xiaolong’s attack and defense to a certain degree.

And his cultivation had risen from the initial Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm to peak late-Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm, however, Huang Xiaolong felt pity that he had not managed to advance to Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm.

‘The next question is, where are we right now?’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. Just as he was about to step out of the cultivation room, a powerful energy fluctuation came from the front of the Giant Shark Flying Ship. Alarmed, Huang Xiaolong jumped to his feet and strode to the control hall. At the same time, the little cow, Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San also came out from their respective cultivation rooms.

“Master!” Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng quickly went up to Huang Xiaolong upon seeing him.

“What’s going on?” Huang Xiaolong demanded.

“There are people fighting ahead of us, and there are quite a lot of people. Judging from the energy fluctuations, they are probably God King Realm masters.” Xiang Xun answered.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart eased slightly.

Suddenly, the echoes of a wail reached their ears, seemingly, there was a demonic beast injured.

At the same time, void devil beast Xu Baisheng cried out, “It’s a disciple of my clan!” He was excited, agitated, and anxious all at once.

The Void Devil Beast Clan’s disciple?! The others were a little surprised at Xu Baisheng’s words
