Chapter 2692: Capturing Yuan Qianxing!

Smashing through the Return of the Origin, Huang Xiaolong’s fist sent the Primal Ancestor Dao Artifacts in the hands of the various experts flying. Not a single attack could stop him.

Upon noticing the terrifying strength behind Huang Xiaolong’s strike, the Primal Ancestors in the hall only had one thought in their minds. ‘Run!’ They retreated quickly, in an attempt to escape from the death god that was Huang Xiaolong.

However, they underestimated Huang Xiaolong. The punch seemed to appear before them instantly, preventing any of them from escaping.

With no other choice, Yuan Qianxing and the rest pushed themselves to the limit. By raising their arms hastily, they had to take on Huang Xiaolong’s punch. However, two massive black arms reached out from the side to meet his punch before it could slam into the Primal Ancestors.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Boom!

The heavens shook and the blast resounded through countless holy grounds around the Otherworldly mansion.

Experts and disciples from the regions around the Otherworldly Mansion who heard the explosion turned to stare in the direction of the mansion with a face full of shock.

“Battle between Primal Ancestors?! Who could it be? Did Mansion Master Mo Zhi return to stake his life in a final battle with Elder Ming?”

“Mo Zhi is alone, and he won’t be able to do anything even if he returns. He’s basically committing suicide by returning!” A disciple of the Myriad Origin Race sneered.

“That’s right! Mo Zhi managed to escape previously, and Mansion Master Yuan was worrying that he would return to carry out sneak attacks on the mansion. Now that he has returned, he won’t be able to escape!”

“When Elder Ming and the others take down Mo Zhi, Mansion Master Yuan will be able to ascend to the position without any fears! No one will dare to say a thing!”

Disciples of the Myriad Origin Race, Enchantress Race, and the Golden Buddha Race laughed.

The shockwave that threatened to obliterate anything in its path soon arrived.

“How is Mo Zhi so strong?! He doesn’t seem to be in trouble when facing Elder Ming and the others!” The fluctuations from the battle became even stronger and those who were waiting for Yuan Qianxing to announce the outcome of the battle were shocked.

“Mo Zhi is said to be in the early-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. It won’t be easy to take him down! Whatever the case, he’s just prolonging the inevitable! He won’t be able to escape!” a disciple from the Golden Buddha Race mocked.

However, a figure soon appeared in the horizon as it flew towards them at an astounding speed.

Smashing into the ground beside the disciples, who were mocking Mo Zhi, a massive crater formed.

The disciples stared at each other before stepping forward to observe the victim. A middle-aged man entered their sights and the armor around his body was completely shattered. Bloodstains could be seen decorating his skin. The mark of someone’s fist could be seen on the middle-aged man’s face, but they managed to recognize him with whatever facial features that were visible.

“Ancestor?!” The disciples of the Golden Buddha Race jumped in fright. They didn’t dare to believe that the person who was lying like a dead dog in the crater was the ancestor of the Golden Buddha Race, Chan Yuli!

It didn’t take long for a second figure to appear.

“Is this our ancestor?!” The disciples of the Enchantress Race stared at Yao Chengxin’s disfigured face in the crater in disbelief.

Compared to Chan Yuli, Yao Chengxin seemed to suffer worse injuries. His face was beaten in, and one of his arms was gone! It seemed as though someone had forcefully ripped it out from its socket, and there was a gaping hole in his chest!

Yao Chengxin’s chest had a hole blown through it and fresh blood was still leaking out from it!

“Mo Zhi?! How can Mo Zhi be so strong?!” the disciples of the Myriad Origin Race exclaimed in shock.

“This should be his dying struggle! In his moment of death, he probably used everything he had to drag Chan Yuli and Yao Chengxin down with him. He should have already lost to Elder Ming…” An expert from the Myriad Origin Race sneered.

However, another explosion rang through the skies as soon as the words left his lips. Another person flew through the skies and landed in the crater. When the members of the three races stared at the ‘newcomer’, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Yuan… Yuan Qianxing? Mansion Master Yuan?!” The expert from the Myriad Origin Race gasped in shock.

The hole in Yuan Qianxing’s chest was even larger than Yao Chengxin, and both his arms were torn apart.

Yuan Qianxing’s breaths were shallow as he lay motionless in the crater.

“It’s fine! Everything will be fine! Elder Ming will suppress Mo Zhi soon!” another expert from the Myriad Origin Race yelled.

However, Huang Xiaolong had to prove him wrong. The ground beneath their feet started to shake and several figures shot towards them.

Yuan Wanfei, the ancestor of the Myriad Origin Race!

Jiang Heng, the ancestor of the Suoluo Race!

Teng Xiao, the ancestor of the Teng Yi Race!

There were three of them in total, and the disciples no longer dared to utter another word.

Under their shocked gazes, a final figure fell from the skies and everyone recognized the person instantly.

“Elder… Elder Ming!”

The final person, who was defeated, was the person whom they revered in their hearts. He was the mysterious and undefeatable legend, Elder Ming!

Was Mo Zhi able to injure Elder Ming with his crazed attacks?!

A strange look appeared on the faces of all the disciples. They finally realized that things weren’t going as they had expected.

While they were trying to process everything that had happened, another figure appeared. However, he wasn’t a loser who was sent crashing into the lands. Standing in the sky above, Huang Xiaolong looked at Elder Ming and the rest.

Those present raised their heads instantly to look at the human standing high above them.

“Huang… Huang Xiaolong?!” Yuan Wangfeng screamed.

“Huang Xiaolong?!”

“Impossible!” The members of the Myriad Origin Race cried out in disbelief.

Yuan Qianxing, who cut a sorry figure in the crater, rose to the skies all of a sudden. However, it wasn’t to confront Huang Xiaolong. He shot in the other direction as he tried his best to run away.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong sent him crashing to the lands with a single slap before he could run.

The slap seemed to land on the hearts of the various experts present.

It was especially so for the disciples of the Myriad Origin Race. The blood drained from their faces, and it was as though something in them died.

Yuan Qianxing was the hope of their race, and he was someone everyone could look up to! He was a hero! However, his prestigious image shattered with a single slap from Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll remember this! One day, I’ll make you suffer a fate a trillion times worse than this!” Yuan Qianxing roared as he glared at Huang Xiaolong with a sinister expression.

“One day? Do you really think you’ll be able to live for another day?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Huang Xiaolong had already made up his mind. There is no way Yuan Qianxing will be allowed to leave today.

Even if Yuan Wanfei and the others escaped, Yuan Qianxing would have to die!

As he looked at Yuan Qianxing’s Origin Saint Godhead, Huang Xiaolong estimated that his saint godheads would be able to progress quite a little, if he managed to devour it…

…

Half an hour later…

Huang Xiaolong tossed Yuan Qianxing, Yao Chengxin, and Chan Yuli into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Even though he managed to capture all three of them, Elder Ming and Yuan Wanfei managed to escape.

As for Jiang Heng and the others, they didn’t dare to run as they remained quietly in their place to receive Huang Xiaolong’s judgment.

Retrieving the Cangqiong Dao Palace, Huang Xiaolong stared at the Magic Pagoda before him. Even though Elder Ming had escaped, he didn’t manage to take his dao artifact along with him.
