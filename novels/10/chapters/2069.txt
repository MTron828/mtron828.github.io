Chapter 2070: ‘Penalize’ On The Spot

“Let’s go and take a look outside!” Bei Xiaoji said to those inside the cabin. Then, she quickly rushed outside with Bei Xiaomei. Elder Fu and the other experts swiftly followed behind them.

In this short duration, Silver Fox Commerce’s experts on other flying ships had already flown out, encircling Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu’s team and glaring at them with fierce, angry expressions.

Facing the encirclement of the Silver Fox Commerce’s several tens of thousands experts, Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu chattered on in a lively manner.

“Kill all these noisy flies.” Wan Zhuoyuan ordered the City of All-Heavens’ experts behind him, “In case they spoil Brother Tian Yu and my mood!”

“Yes, Young Lord!” The City of All-Heavens’ guards acknowledged in sonorous voices.

But right at this time, a voice rang in everyone’s ears, “Stop!”

Bei Xiaoji, Bei Xiaomei, and a group of experts were flying over from a distance.

Seeing Bei Xiaoji and Bei Xiaomei’s faces, there was a hint of appreciation in Wan Zhuoyuan’s eyes as he commented, “These two women are not bad looking. One’s an alluring icy beauty, and the other one is innocently charming. They are quite suitable to become my maids.” He then looked at Tian Yu and said, “Brother Tian Yu, one for each of us. You choose first.”

Tian Yu smilingly nodded his head in agreement, “In that case, I’ll take the first pick.”

His gaze shifted between Bei Xiaoji and Bei Xiaomei’s body for a while, then pointed at Bei Xiaoji, “This one suits my taste. I’ll take this one!”

“Insolent!”

“Presumptuous!”

Silver Fox Commerce experts were enraged, seeing the two young men conversing brazenly without any anxiety or tension on their faces, as they picked and divided Bei Xiaoji and Bei Xiaomei.

Both women, Bei Xiaoji and Bei Xiaomei, also showed anger on their faces hearing Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu’s words.

One of the Silver Fox Commerce’s captain guards shouted, “How dare you blaspheme Eldest Miss and Second Miss!”

“Brothers, attack! Kill them!”

Bei Xiaoji’s heart sank hearing that captain guard’s righteous sounding shout. It was already too late when she wanted to stop them. The City of All-Heavens’ experts behind Wan Zhuoyuan attacked in a flicker. Overwhelming palm force struck across space and sword qi crisscrossed. In the blink of an eye, the attacking Silver Fox Commerce’s guards were reduced into a bloody mist.

Even though this group of Silver Fox Commerce’s guards was courageous, the strongest one amongst them was only a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch. How could they resist the powerful experts from the City of All-Heavens?

The lowest cultivation realm among these City of All-Heavens expert guards was high-level Emperor Realm.

Elder Fu and the several other Silver Fox Commerce’s Emperor Realm experts’ faces tightened with tension at this sight.

“Protect and take the Misses away!” Elder Fu bellowed, “Eldest Miss, Second Miss, leave quickly!”

“The rest of you attack together with me and open a path for the Misses!” Other Silver Fox Commerce Emperor Realm experts shouted at the guards.

Elder Fu and the rest of Silver Fox Commerce’s Emperors immediately launched attacks towards the City of All-Heavens’ group.

Bei Xiaoji’s beautiful face was wrought with tension and worry. She grabbed Bei Xiaomei by the hand and spoke urgently, “Xiaomei, we have to go!”

“Want to go?” Wan Zhuoyuan sneered sarcastically. His body blurred as he leaped off the Nine Dragon Carriage, reaching past Elder Fu and other Silver Fox Commerce’s experts’ line of defense.

As Wan Zhuoyuan passed by their side, Elder Fu and the rest of Silver Fox Commerce’s Emperors’ bodies cut into pieces as if a blade had slashed through them.

“Elder Fu—!”

“Guardian Tang!” Several Silver Fox Commerce’s experts shouted with bloodshot anguished eyes.

Bei Xiaomei screamed, staring dazedly at Elder Fu’s incomplete corpse. Elder Fu had been with her since her childhood, and he was closer than a family elder to her.

Wherever Wan Zhuoyuan passed, all the Silver Fox Commerce’s experts were slashed into pieces. No one could block his attack.

In the blink of an eye, Wan Zhuoyuan was already standing in front of the Bei sisters. Before the sisters’ fearful faces, Wan Zhuoyuan’s fingers clutched the sisters’ shoulders, and he detained them.

“So, you’re Huang Xiaolong’s woman, the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss, Bei Xiaomei.” Wan Zhuoyuan fixed his attention on Bei Xiaomei, then snickered, “My luck has always been quite good. I had merely planned to take a stroll around the Divine World today. I hadn’t expected to run into Huang Xiaolong’s woman.”

His gaze circled over Bei Xiaomei’s face, then moved down to her bosom and further down... “Tsk, tsk, this face, this figure, no wonder Huang Xiaolong was tempted. But I’m surprised that you’re still a virgin, ah. Is Huang Xiaolong reluctant to touch you? Haha, it seems I’ve picked up a bargain!”

Bei Xiaomei was enraged and felt insulted, “Y-you dare! Uncle will not spare you lot!”

Uncle?

Wan Zhuoyuan realized Bei Xiaomei was referring to Huang Xiaolong, a beat later.

“Uncle? Heihei, from now on, let me be your Uncle.” Wan Zhuoyuan chuckled lecherously.

Bei Xiaoji’s eyes were icy as she looked at Wan Zhuoyuan then Tian Yu. “You are from the City of All-Heavens?” In her opinion, in the Greater Worlds, only people from the City of All-Heavens would speak of Huang Xiaolong with this kind of nonchalance.

Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu were stunned for a second that she could guess their origins so fast. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Tian Yu smiled and said to Wan Zhuoyuan, “Looks like this Silver Fox Commerce’s Eldest Miss’ eyesight is quite sharp. She guessed our identities so fast.”

The remaining Silver Fox Commerce’s experts were shocked hearing their enemy came from the City of All-Heavens.

Wan Zhuoyuan smiled at Bei Xiaoji as he spoke, “Correct, I came from the City of All-Heavens. However, there’s no prize for guessing correctly.” He then looked back and ordered the City of All-Heavens’ experts, “The rest of Silver Fox Commerce’s people, kill them all!”

The City of All-Heavens’ experts complied and started slaughtering immediately. In an instant, tragic screams undulated.

“Stop! Stop!” Bei Xiaomei yelled furiously.

Yet the City of All-Heavens’ experts continued to slaughter with cold expressions.

Wan Zhuoyuan chuckled, watching her actions, and teased, “Little Missy, they don’t listen to you. They are my subordinates, so they only listen to me. But if you call me Uncle, I can order them to stop!”

Flames of fury burned in Bei Xiaomei’s eyes as she spat, “You, you, shameless!”

Wan Zhuoyuan didn’t mind it at all. He smilingly added, “I like this description. It’s a pity though. Since you refused to call me uncle, you can only watch your subordinates die in front of you. You are the one who killed him!”

“You!” Bei Xiaomei’s chest heaved from resentment, but she knew that even if she called him Uncle, Wan Zhuoyuan would not order his subordinates to stop.

Soon, over a hundred thousand of Silver Fox Commerce’s guards were annihilated by the City of All-Heavens’ experts.

“Leave one alive.” Wan Zhuoyuan suddenly ordered.

In the end, among tens of thousands of Silver Fox Commerce’s guards, only one was left alive.

Looking at the fearful Silver Fox Commerce’s sole surviving disciple, Wan Zhuoyuan ordered, “Go back and tell Huang Xiaolong, if he wants to save his woman, come to the World of Darkness when the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness matures. I will be waiting for him at the World of Darkness. Heihei, if he doesn’t come, don’t blame me for ‘penalizing’ her on the spot, then slowly torture her to death!”

Penalize on the spot! It was obvious what Wan Zhuoyuan meant.

“Brother Tian Yu, shall we make a move?” Wan Zhuoyuan asked Tian Yu.

Tian Yu laughed softly as if he was enjoying himself. “Well, we’ve more or less seen the Divine World. Let’s return.”

With that said, the two left on the Nine Dragons Carriage, taking away Bei Xiaomei and Bei Xiaoji. The City of All-Heavens’ experts followed closely behind the carriage.

The Silver Fox Commerce’s disciple was rooted on the spot, looking dazedly at Wan Zhuoyuan’s group speeding away. His gaze fell on Elder Fu and the others’ corpses. Only then did he snap back to his senses. He quickly took out his communication symbol and reported the matter to the Silver Fox Commerce headquarters.

At this point in time, the Silver Fox Commerce’s President Bei Lengyan was at the little cow’s palace, paying his morning respect to the little cow. When he got the report, his face discolored.
