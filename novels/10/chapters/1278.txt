‘Ghost Manor?’ Huang Xiaolong’s interest was piqued hearing their conversation.

The Ghost Manor was the most mysterious force in the Clear Spirit World, as it appeared randomly once within several hundred to several thousand years. But every time it appeared, it always raised great waves through the Clear Spirit World.

Even though no one knew the Ghost Manor Lord’s real strength, the Xiao Family, Chen Family, and Ma Family’s Ancestors would fidget on their toes at the mention of Ghost Manor Lord.

A certain sect’s disciples were engaged in deep conversations as they flew towards the small valley, where Huang Xiaolong’s group was resting.

Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of the five disciples in a flicker and blocked their path. These five disciples were clad in dark azure battle robes, with a small drum tied at each of their waists. These small drums had profound symbols painted on them.

Huang Xiaolong guessed that they were Clear Spirit World’s Golden Drums Sect’s disciples, based on their attires.

Similar to the Burning Sky Sect, the Golden Drums Sect was also a first-rank force in Clear Spirit World.

The five Golden Drums Sect’s disciples were inwardly astonished, as someone had suddenly appeared right in front of them. But they were soon relieved as they noticed that the other side was just a Seventh Order Ancient God Realm disciple. At this time, anger burned in their hearts. A Seventh Order Ancient God Realm disciple dared to block their path?

“Friends, I want to ask about the Ghost Manor you were just talking about.” Huang Xiaolong said in a friendly manner, as if he did not see the anger on their faces.

By this point, the little cow and void devil beast Xu Baisheng had appeared at the scene and were standing behind Huang Xiaolong.

Golden Drums Sect’s Zheng Wei and his four companions snickered, while they looked meaningfully at Huang Xiaolong as if they were looking at a clown, “Punk, which small sect do you belong to? Don’t you feel you’re very foolish? Why must we tell you about the Ghost Manor? Are you my slave or someone related to me?”

Another Golden Drums Sect’s disciple Wang Hua laughed, “I wouldn’t want such a stupid slave anyway, even if you give one to me, otherwise, with him going out and causing such troubles everyday, I won’t even know why I died.”

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over the five Golden Drums Sect’s disciples; two were late-Eighth Order, two mid-Ninth Order, and one was a late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm.

Huang Xiaolong reached out suddenly as his palm made a grasping gesture in the air, and immediately, the five Golden Drums Sect disciples felt a terrifying power squeezing them from all around. Their faces paled. In the next second, all five of them crashed into a mountain cliff not far away, like broken kites, then they slid to the ground while blood gurgled out of their mouths.

“You—!” Zheng Wei was terrified as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, and his face paled.

“Speak, tell me everything you know about the Ghost Manor.” Huang Xiaolong ordered coldly.

The late-Ninth Order Ancient God Realm Zheng Wei’s body wobbled as he struggled up to his feet, nonetheless he faked bravado, “Do you know who we are?”

However, before he could explain his identity, the little cow’s tail struck out like a whip across the air. In the next moment, Zheng Wei let out a scream and his body flew out and crashed once more to the ground. His companions could see a whip mark running from his head to his leg.

There were tiny ribbons of lightning crackling along the whip mark.

Zheng Wei was rolling on the ground, screaming in pain.

Wang Hua and the other three disciples were deathly pale as they saw Zheng Wei’s miserable condition.

At this time, the little cow turned around and blew a few times at her tail as lightning crackled. She was getting more familiar at using her ‘cow-tail-whip-you-to-death’ move.

“Now, who else wants to introduce their identities?” The little cow directed her question at Wang Hua’s group.

All four desperately shook their heads in fear. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The little cow turned to Huang Xiaolong with a flattering smile and said, "Master, please ask them again, and I am sure this time you will get your answer."

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, this cow!

Subsequently, Wang Hua and the rest explained in great detail everything that they knew about the Ghost Manor to Huang Xiaolong. All of them were afraid that if they were a second too slow, they would be killed, thus, the four of them fought over one another to tell Huang Xiaolong what they knew.

“Is Xiao Family’s Elder Xiao Teng coming to the Ghost Manor?” Huang Xiaolong asked. This was the main reason he had come to the Clear Spirit World.

The chaos five-colored heaven refining stone was in Xiao Teng’s hand. If Xiao Teng was also coming to the Ghost Manor, it’d save him a trip to the Stone Buddha Mainland.

“This we don’t know.” Wang Hua and the other three disciples said and shook their heads.

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong branded Wang Hua and the other three Golden Drums Sect’s disciples mind with his soul mark, holding their lives in his hands.

As Wang Hua’s group knew the location of the Ghost Manor, he had them lead the way for him.

Although Huang Xiaolong couldn’t determine if Xiao Teng would be at the Ghost Manor, he still decided to go there to take a look first. It was only a matter of a few days time even If Xiao Teng did not appear at the Ghost Manor.

Zheng Wei did not die, since Huang Xiaolong gave him a healing pellet, and his injuries recovered slightly.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected Zheng Wei to have a hard background, but as it turned out, Zheng Wei was the Golden Drums Sect’s Chief Zheng Xiong’s son.

No wonder his tone had been so big, sometime back.

This time, the Ghost Manor had appeared at the Ghosts Sea within the Odious Ghosts Forest. With their flying speed, they could arrive at the Ghosts Sea in seven to eight days.

Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to reach the Ghosts Sea, as there were more than ten days left until the day the Ghost Manor’s Lord would choose a personal disciple. Therefore, they traveled during the day, while Huang Xiaolong cultivated at night.

Other than cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium at night, Huang Xiaolong also tempered his physical body with the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks.

The little cow had mentioned earlier that the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks has a divine effect in tempering the physical body. Huang Xiaolong hadn’t believed her words initially, but now he was a complete believer.

The Eidolon Crystalline Rocks’ physical tempering effects were beyond divine, it was simply heaven-defying.

Every night after tempering his body with the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks, he distinctly felt the changes in his True Dragon’s Physique. Both his defenses and explosive power improved to a shocking degree.

During this time, the little cow and void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s strength also had improved significantly, especially Xu Baisheng. With the help of the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit his strength had recovered at a terrifying speed, that even Huang Xiaolong smacked his lips in envy.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng was different from the little cow. Xu Baisheng’s cultivation had dropped because he was imprisoned by the ancient Burning Purgatory Magical Formation for too long, as long as he was consuming divine pills and spiritual herbs, he could swiftly regain his peak strength. On the other hand, the little cow was reincarnated and had to start cultivating from scratch. Therefore, even though her cultivation was improving quickly, it was slower, when compared to Xu Baisheng.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Ghosts Sea after ten days, Xu Baisheng’s strength had recovered to peak late-Second Order Ancestor God Realm, just half a step more, and he could reach Third Order Ancestor God Realm.

Whereas Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was closer to peak early Seventh Order Ancient God Realm.

By the time Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Ghosts Sea, the atmosphere was extremely lively. Various sects’ disciples had already arrived at the Ghosts Sea.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group was flying towards the Ghost Manor, a group of disciples flew towards them, and directly blocked their path.

Zheng Wei, Wang Hua, and the rest of Golden Drums Sect’s disciples tightened nervously after recognizing the person blocking their path.

“Hey, Zheng Wei, long time no see.” The crimson-haired young man who was standing in front of the other group looked arrogantly at Zheng Wei, and went on, “It seems you’ve been living well recently. You’re here for the Ghost Manor? Then, let’s go together.” His tone left no room for Zheng Wei to refuse.

Zheng Wei did not reply, instead, he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the group who was blocking their path. It was clear that this group had grudges with Zheng Wei, and from Zheng Wei’s apprehensive expression, the crimson-haired young man had quite the background.
