Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, Feng Er, the others and the Barbarians appeared consecutively in the same area. When the Barbarians’ experts came out, they immediately scanned their environment. At the same time, they felt the difference in the spiritual energy, air, and everything else around them. Everyone started whooping and shouting in joy.

Even Lei Budong, the Barbarian’s number one expert was shouting to vent his roiling emotions, “We came out at last!”

“We’re out, we’re out!”

The other Barbarians’ experts’ reactions were similar, as they laughed, shouted, cried and howled madly.

Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly watching them, allowing them to vent their emotions.

He could understand the Barbarians’ emotion. Any person, or an entire tribe that was trapped within that space for millions to billions of years, would feel a rush of liberation after regaining freedom.

When the Barbarians had vented their emotions, Huang Xiaolong said to Jiang Hong, “Senior Brother, let’s go.”

Jiang Hong nodded his head in agreement.

Thus, everyone flew out from the Ghost River.

Upon reaching the Ghost River’s riverbank, Huang Xiaolong got a feeling of finally being able to see the light again, as he looked at the surrounding environment, and the Floating Twilight Land’s sky that was covered by devil qi.

However, the ghostly cries that they had heard before seemed to have disappeared, hadn’t they?

Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, Feng Er, and the others also noticed this difference.

Huang Xiaolong turned back and looked at the group of Barbarians’ experts, especially Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and other three Head Chieftains. He spoke solemnly, “Lei Budong, I will be leaving with Senior Brother, so what are you going to do?”

Lei Budong, Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang instantly regained their senses from their overexcitement.

“Wherever the Great King goes, we naturally follow the Great King.” Lei Budong respectfully replied with a firm and determined face.

“It is exactly as Elder Brother Lei said, no matter where the Great King goes, we will follow!” Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang said with similar determination.

Subsequently, the chieftains also declared that they would follow Huang Xiaolong, and go wherever he went.

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly in his heart. These Barbarians averaged ten meters tall and had black fur-like hair growing from their bodies... It would be strange if he didn’t become the center of attention if these Barbarians followed him everywhere.

He didn’t want to be the talk of the town wherever he went.

Moreover, if Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and these Barbarians were to leave with him, what were the rest of the Barbarians who were still inside the space going to do?

Hence, Huang Xiaolong said to Lei Budong, “I know that all of you are willing to follow me, but if all of you leave like this, what about the Barbarians still inside the space?”

Lei Budong and the rest had no answer.

“How about we do this? Both Lei Budong and Feng Chen will follow me first, Shui Luosheng, Hui Haibo, Guang Wenfang, and other chieftains all stay behind.” Huang Xiaolong suggested after pondering on this matter for a moment.

‘That...” Shui Luosheng and the others who were told to stay behind exchanged a look.

“I have completely absorbed the chaos divine lightning, so all of you can enter and leave the Barbarians’ space at any time, moreover, the tribe needs your management.” Huang Xiaolong went on, “Later, when I find a suitable place for your tribe to migrate, I will take all of you there.”

Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang hastened to comply respectfully, “We’ll follow the Great King’s order!”

Huang Xiaolong then gave Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang numerous grade-ten spirit stones and spiritual pills. He also tasked Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and others to develop the Barbarians Tribe and cautioned them not to wander outside a hundred million li radius from the Ghost River.

Shui Luosheng and the others respectfully complied to each of Huang Xiaolong’s reminders.

In the meantime, Jiang Hong also resolved the restrictions he had placed on them.

Only then did Huang Xiaolong’s group leave the Ghost River.

The kneeling Barbarians stood up long after Huang Xiaolong’s group left. They took some time to explore the near surroundings of the Ghost River before returning to the Barbarians’ space.

On the other hand, not long after leaving the Ghost River area, Huang Xiaolong’s group saw the Heaven Eye Mountain Range that they had camped in before.

But Huang Xiaolong’s group did not linger there and flew onwards.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong thought of a problem. According to their initial plan, they had planned to pay his Master the King of Grandmist a visit, but there was only a little over a year left until the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition. If they were to go visit his Master at the Grandmist Lands, would he be able to make it in time for the selection competition?

Huang Xiaolong shared his thoughts about this with his Senior Brother Jiang Hong.

Jiang Hong almost exclaimed in astonishment, “Junior Brother wants to participate in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition?” But he agreed, “The Grandmist Lands is very far away indeed. It would take at least two to three years of travel time from the Floating Twilight Lands to reach there. In truth, I just need to say a word to the Heavenly Court, if Junior Brother wants to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court without participating in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition.”

With Jiang Hong’s identity, as long as he brought the matter up with the Heavenly Court, the Heavenly Court would certainly agree.

This was not a problem at all.

Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong’s current strength fulfilled the conditions set for the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected Jiang Hong to propose this to him, but he responded with a wry smile, “Forget it, I better participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court through the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition.”

If Jiang Hong were to put out a word on Huang Xiaolong’s behalf to the Heavenly Court, and the news of it were to leak, it would probably attract even more troubles.

Who was Jiang Hong? The person hailed as the strongest person in the Divine World, the Divine World’s number one Emperor Palace’s Emperor, yet he would come out and speak to the Heavenly Court for Huang Xiaolong? So that a mere Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple Huang Xiaolong could participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court? That would send other Emperor Palaces in a flurry of frenzy with guesses and theories of conspiracy.

Jiang Hong understood the underlying meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words, and did not insist. He said instead, “In truth, Junior Brother need not participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.”

Even though the Battle of the Heavenly Court’s prizes are amazing, with Huang Xiaolong’s current identity, he does not lack any of those things.

The little cow’s chuckles sounded at this time, and then the rest of the group heard her speak, “Kiddo Huang naturally has his reasons to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, maybe at that time, he would need some godly assistance from you, his Senior Brother.”

The little cow said that because Huang Xiaolong’s current strength was still far from being able to take away the two chaos lightning pools from the Heavenly Court. But if there was a super master like Jiang Hong helping him by his side, the difficulty would be greatly reduced.

Hearing the little cow’s words, Jiang Hong was quick to agree, “Please rest assured, Senior Azure Cow, as long as Junior Brother says the word, I will certainly help.”

The little cow let out a hearty laugh as she said, “You have promised. Don’t forget that when the time comes.”

Jiang Hong looked at the wolf-like cunning smile on the little cow’s face, and he got a feeling that he had stepped into a fire pit.

As Huang Xiaolong insisted on participating in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition, he and Jiang Hong decided to postpone the trip to the Grandmist Lands after the end of the selection competition.

Jiang Hong gave Huang Xiaolong a token and said, “This is my Grandmist Emperor Palace’s token, after Junior Brother is finished with the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition, bring this token and look for me at the Grandmist Emperor Palace. I’ll take Junior Brother and Senior Azure Cow to the Grandmist Lands to see Master.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong put away the token as he nodded his head, “Alright.”

The group flew onwards in a harmonious atmosphere, laughing and chatting along the way.

.....

Several days later, they stopped at another city in the Floating Twilight Land.

This city was significantly bigger than the Demonic Python City and it was built to resemble an ancient demonic tiger.

Huang Xiaolong’s group planned to rest one night in this city before continuing their journey the next day. Moreover, Lei Budong and Feng Chen had recently come out from the Barbarians’ space, so this was an opportunity to let them see the cultures outside the Barbarians’ space.

However, not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the Devil Tiger City, a group of disciples clad in silvery-white brocade robes also stepped into the Devil Tiger City.

This group of disciples was none other than the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples led by Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang.
