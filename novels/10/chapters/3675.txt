Chapter 3676 – Capital City

The Reversal Sword didn’t emit much light when Huang Xiaolong waved it around. It looked like an ordinary sword that couldn’t be less noteworthy! Even so, the chain and blade clattered to the ground.

The Ghost Chain shattered into countless pieces, and the Ghost Blade shattered into pieces.

The two Ghost Kings stood rooted to their spots. The light in their eyes started to dissipate.

“It’s pretty sharp…” Huang Xiaolong Huang Xiaolong glanced at the sword once before keeping it. He walked away content, and Jiang Dacheng stared at him in fright. However, he kept up with Huang Xiaolong the best he could.

Everyone stared at the leaving Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Was that it?! Was he leaving just like that?

As Huang Xiaolong turned around, the bodies of the two ghost kings started to split apart.

A fountain of blood sprouted from their heads.

Wu Zun, Jiu Yu, and the others couldn’t believe their eyes.

Bing Yu had it the worst as his face turned ashen gray.

When Huang Xiaolong passed Bing Yu, he paused for a second and muttered, “Since they saved you, you should have cherished your chance to live. You shouldn’t have chosen to mess with me again.” Pointing at Bing Yu, a tiny flame entered his chest before incinerating his body.

When that was going on, Yue Hong and the others were starting to approach on their Ghost King Ship. They might have started their journey earlier than Huang Xiaolong, but their Ghost King Ship was much slower than the Supreme Ghost King Ship! They were even slower than Bing Yu and the rest!

“I think Lord Yin Reversal and the rest should have arrived…” Yue Hong muttered.

After all, they saw the Yin Reversal Ghost King and Bing Yu pass them earlier. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ao Fangwu nodded slightly. “They might have already clashed. Hahaha, with Lord Yin Reversal’s strength, he would have killed the kid in a second!”

Yue Hong’s transmission symbol rang and he slowly took it out. From the looks of it, the report came from an eminent elder from the Yin Horn Race.

Before reading the report, he chuckled in amusement, “It’s from the Yin Horn Race. Looks like the battle is over and the good news is here.”

The eminent elder from the Yin Horn Race was a great friend of his, and the excitement on the faces of the rest started to show. As they read the report together, their faces started to sink. Explosions rang through their minds. By the time they read the last portion of the report, their souls seemed to have left their bodies.

Yue Qing and the others started to crowd around them in confusion.

“What?! Lord Yin Reversal and Lord Nether Yang joined hands… And lost?!”

“Their physical bodies were completely destroyed!”

Yue Qing and the others felt their legs trembling fiercely.

…

After leaving the Sword Grave, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng completed the tribulations and arrived at the Enlightenment Mountain.

“Is this it?” Jiang Dacheng looked at the mountain peak before him and frowned. The Enlightenment Peak in his mind was much more imposing. However, the scene before him was far from his expectations.

“The Enlightenment Peak is much more complicated than it looks.” Huang Xiaolong reminded when he saw the look on Jiang Dacheng’s face. Jiang Dacheng might not be able to see the intricacies behind the mysterious structure, but Huang Xiaolong could!

The Enlightenment Peak looked ordinary, but it was made up of countless individual spaces.

Every single rock that made up the mountain was transformed from one of the grand dao laws!

It could even be said that the entire mountain was made up of the laws!

“Let’s go. We’ll find a good spot before the others arrive.” Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards the Enlightenment Mountain. With Jiang Dacheng following closely behind, the two of them soon arrived at the foot of the mountain.

One could only climb up the mountain step by step. There was no way to fly up directly. There were Gods of Creation who refused to abide by the rules and tried to fly up. In the end, they were destroyed by the restrictions on the mountain.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had the Universe Boat, he still chose to ascend the mountain step by step.

Jiang Dacheng barely took a few steps up before he stopped. He huffed and puffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t climb any higher. That was the fate of those who weren’t strong enough. They could only stay at the foot of the mountain.

“Lord, I can’t go on. You should keep going. I’ll remain here…” Jiang Dacheng panted.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong knew that there was no use trying to force things. The grand dao laws at the peak of the mountain were extremely intricate. If he forcefully brought Jiang Dacheng up there, the latter wouldn’t be able to comprehend anything anyway. Instead, he might face a huge backlash.

Leaving Jiang Dacheng behind, Huang Xiaolong started to ascend the mountain.

The Enlightenment Mountain might not be towering into the heavens, but climbing step by step would take him several hours. The higher he got, the stronger the pressure became.

Of course, the pressure was basically negligible for existences at Huang Xiaolong’s level.

Without stopping, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the peak after three short hours. Standing at the top of the Enlightenment Mountain, Huang Xiaolong looked down, only to see countless worlds beneath his feet! They were worlds created from the grand dao laws!

Slowly sitting down, Huang Xiaolong started to comprehend the mysteries of the grand dao laws…

Several days passed, and a mysterious feeling seeped into his mind.

In the blink of an eye, half a month passed.

The world under him started to experience a huge change, and it was no longer the pure sheet of white it had once been.

The grand dao laws seemed to turn sentient in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Another five days passed, and Huang Xiaolong was still deep in comprehension.

The grand dao laws around the Enlightenment Peak continued to transform and they danced about like little fairies in his mind.

When three more days had passed, Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and leaped off the mountain. Waking Jiang Dacheng up, they left the Enlightenment Peak.

The Yin Ghost River would only remain open for a single month. As such, the two of them had to return.

Since the Supreme Ghost King Ship had been imprinted by their dao souls, no other cultivators could seal it from them.

A day or two later, the two of them returned to shore.

“Lord… Would you like to stay with my Jiang Family for a few days before leaving?” Jiang Dacheng asked. He knew that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over to the Fengdu City now that he had explored the Yin Ghost River.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head casually. “It’s alright.”

After thinking for a moment, he handed over a token. “Take this. If anyone forces you to reveal my location or messes with you, show them this token. They shouldn’t mess with you after.”

The news of him receiving the Reversal Sword should have already spread through the lands. There were definitely people who would turn their eyes to Jiang Dacheng who followed him throughout his journey.

When Jiang Dacheng received the token, he looked at the two words inscribed on it and nearly dropped the token in fright. The words ‘Gui Chi’ were carved intricately onto the token!
