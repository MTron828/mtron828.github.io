After reading Bei Xiaomei’s report, Huang Xiaolong felt a burst of joy in his heart.

“Xiaolong, is there news on Xiaofei?” Su Yan walked over to Huang Xiaolong and asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, and he passed his transmission symbol over to Huang Peng and the rest.

According to what Bei Xiaomei said, Shi Xiaofei was currently on the Datong World. It wasn’t located too far away from the Fire Stone World, and with the Netherking Flying Ship, it would take them four days at most to arrive on the Datong World!

Moreover, she was accepted into the Changzhi Sect, one of the Datong Diving Plane’s top powers. An ancestor level figure in the sect had noticed her and accepted her as a direct disciple. Her apprenticeship ceremony was going to take place several days later! She was in no danger at all.

Huang Xiaolong felt a huge boulder lifted off his heart when he received the news.

“Xiaofei, wait for me!” Huang Xiaolong muttered in his heart.

Four days!

In four days, Huang Xiaolong would be able to arrive on the Datong World. He would be able to make it in time for Shi Xiaofei’s apprenticeship ceremony!

Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others rejoiced when they received news about Shi Xiaofei.

“Xiaolong, are we going to the Datong World?” Su Yan asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Yes. We shall head over to the Datong World. After picking Xiaofei, we shall head back to the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Guo Xiaofan spoke up all of a sudden. “Uncle, are you an ancestor of the Fortune Emperor Palace? Why did Hu Qingzhong and the rest address you as the King of Hell?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Even though they had managed to learn that Huang Xiaolong had already broken into the Emperor Realm when they had eavesdropped on the disciples of the Earth Shattering Gang, they had no idea about most of his other achievements. The only other thing they knew was that he managed to obtain something they called the devil stele... Of course, none of them had any idea what the title ‘King of Hell’ meant.

“Are you the emperor of some massive country?” Guo Xiaofan guessed. “Are you some sort of emperor of a dynasty?”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao started giggling at the side.

Huang Xiaolong turned speechless as laughter slowly escaped his lips. “I’m not an emperor of a massive country, and neither am I an emperor of a dynasty. I went to Hell in the past, and I managed to obtain the inheritance of the King of Hell. Right now, one of my identities is the King of Hell. I control all three worlds in Hell.”

Fang Xuanxuan was afraid Guo Xiaofan and the others were unaware of the power Huang Xiaolong possessed. So, she continued to explain. “The Divine World, Hell, Buddha World, Devil World, and the Demon World, are known as the five Greater Worlds. The Divine World is controlled by the Heavenly Court, and Hell is controlled by the King of Hell. Xiaolong is the current King of Hell!”

Guo Xiaofan, Huang Peng, and the others felt their jaws dropping in shock.

King of Hell!

Controls three worlds in Hell!

Initially, they felt as though entering the Emperor Realm was Huang Xiaolong’s greatest achievement after ascending for such a short amount of time. After all, even a sect leader like Hu Qingzhong was only at the Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Right now, they learned that Huang Xiaolong was actually the ruler of one of the Greater Worlds!

Guo Xiaofan’s jaws dropped as he said exaggeratedly, “Uncle, that’s so cool! Doesn’t that mean I can walk sideways in the Divine World from now on?!” His smile widened to the point where it threatened to split his face in half.

Huang Xiaolong laughed. “If you want to, you can use your arms to walk around in the Divine World.”

Guo Xiaofan was stunned for a second, and everyone laughed at his silly response.

“Hehe...” Guo Xiaofan’s silly laughter filled the air in the next second.

“Uncle, are these your subordinates?” Guo Xiaofan turned to look at the four odd beasts, Undead Netherguards, and radiance angels before continuing, “Are they all in the Emperor Realm?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “That’s right. They are all Emperors under my command.” He casually introduced everyone one of them to his family members.

A light lit up in Guo Xiaofan’s eyes, and he asked, “Uncle, can you let me bring them about when I’m out on the streets? It’s going to be so awesome!”

Huang Xiaolong kicked him in the butt. “Nonsense!”

Everyone roared with laughter at Guo Xiaofan’s antics.

Along the way, Guo Xiaofan bubbled with excitement as he asked about everything and anything that came to his mind.

Even though they had already ascended for ten years, they were trapped in the mine of the Earth Shattering Gang as slaves. They had no idea about any of the happenings in the Divine World, and Guo Xiaofan had tons of questions he wanted to ask. Looking at the bubbly Guo Xiaofan, Huang Xiaolong patiently explained everything he wanted to know.

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao chirped in from the side occasionally.

There were some things that the two ladies knew more than Huang Xiaolong. After all, he had merely ascended for several hundred years. He had spent most of his time training instead of messing about in the Divine World.

Along with their explanation, the members of the Huang Family learned about everything that had happened.

While the Netherking Flying Ship was headed for the Datong World, a celebratory air filled the Changzhi Sect. Lanterns lit up the sky, and auspicious objects were placed all over the area.

Hundreds of thousands of disciples rushed about like busy bees in their headquarters.

In a few days, their old ancestor, Tao Yu, was going to accept a disciple. That was something that only happened once several millions of years. After all, the last time their old ancestor had accepted a disciple was a million years ago.

As everyone from the Changzhi Sect rushed about, the Datong World’s superpowers went over to offer their congratulations. Countless flying ships headed towards the Datong World from the neighboring planes.

Out of all of them, there was a flying ship with a Violet Phoenix insignia soaring through the space of the Divine World.

It was a flying ship sent by the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace.

Out of the Emperor Palaces, the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace ranked one hundred and twelve. Even though they weren’t in the top hundred, they were an untouchable existence in the eyes of the various powers of the Datong World.

This time, the reason the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace had sent people over to celebrate the apprenticeship ceremony because Tao Yu was friends with their old ancestor, Huang Fangtong. They had gone through life and death together and were considered bosom buddies.

Before Huang Fangtong had broken into the Emperor Realm, he had become acquainted with Tao Yu. They had gone through hell and highwaters before. The number of times Tao Yu had saved Huang Fangtong numbered more than one.

However, Huang Fangtong had something going on, and he wasn’t able to personally head over to give his congratulations. In the end, he had sent his personal disciple, Huang Shiyi, to offer his congratulations.

Huang Shiyi was the number one genius of the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace. Even though he didn’t possess a supreme godhead, his godhead was at the peak-grade emperor rank, and it was infinitely close to a supreme godhead. He was a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch, and it was clear that the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace treated the Changzhi Sect seriously.

On the flying ship, Huang Shiyi was surrounded by the Violet Phoenix Emperor Palace’s various elders.

“I’ve heard that Shi Xiaofei not only has a peak-grade emperor rank godhead and the radiance ceramic glaze godhead, but she also has an innate Pure Luminance Elightened Buddha Physique. Her talent is through the roof, and she should be the greatest genius the Changzhi Sect has ever received. She’s comparable to the founding ancestor of the Changzhi Sect!” One of the elders exclaimed in surprise. “It’s no wonder Tao Yu will accept her as a direct disciple.”

“Shi Xiaofei is extremely pretty, and her beauty is indescribable.” Another elder praised. “I’ve also heard that the young master of the Scarlet Origin Emperor Palace is here to offer his congratulations. There are so many young masters present... They are probably there for Shi Xiaofei!”

Huang Shiyi didn’t open his mouth, but a scene appeared in his head. Several months ago, he had met Shi Xiaofei. He was stunned by her beauty. Her image had been burned into his mind, and this time, he was headed to the Changzhi Sect to ask for her hand in marriage.
