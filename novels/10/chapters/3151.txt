Chapter 3152: Son Of Mystic

When the island was reduced to dust, a startlingly dazzling purplish red lava geysered into the ninth heavens. The sudden and overwhelming force of bursting lava astounded everyone.

Before this magnitude of force and lava, the average peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable would have turned into gray ash faster than one could blink.

Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Tianyi who were at the center of everything were submerged by the purplish, red lava. Lei Yu and the others were still in shock when they saw two balls of light break out from the depths of flowing lava as they dove to the seabed!

These two balls of light were naturally Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Tianyi.

Seeing this, Lei Yu, Di Shuang, and the others put up a protective barrier over themselves with cosmos energy and dove into the thick lava flow, diving towards the seabed right behind Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Tianyi.

Further into the lava flow, the pressure from all around increased greatly, and at one point, the cosmos energy barrier around Huang Xiaolong started thinning.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong circulated his absolute blaze power to the fullest, and at the same time, he activated the Huang Long Armor.

Under the Huang Long Armor’s defenses, Huang Xiaolong’s speed improved.

Although Yuan Tianyi had seven elements’ perfection, his absolute blaze power wasn’t one of them. Moreover, without a magical artifact like the Huang Long Armor, his speed was worse than Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong had gone deeper than twenty thousand meters when he was caught off by a burst of bright light that caused him to stop for a split second. The next thing he knew was that he was inside a purplish red space!

The bottom half of this purplish red space was endless rolling lava, and in the air above was vigorous burning flames. Scorching doesn’t describe the temperature within, and even space had turned ash gray from the heat. Probably the very core of a fire world could not burn at this temperature.

Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls spread as he turned into a streak of light and sped in one direction, disappearing from the spot. He headed straight towards the center of the purplish, red space.

While Huang Xiaolong was heading towards the center of the space, high in the center of the purplish red space was an enormous suspended blood-red moon!

This enormous blood-red moon was as big as a supercontinent, emitting endless blood-red rays of light.

Right below the blood moon was a group of people seated cross-legged, enshrouded in bright blood-red light. At the same time, there was a mysterious energy coming from their bodies, trying to seep into the blood moon. But this mysterious energy was blocked off when it came in contact with the blood moon’s surface.

Clearly, these people were trying to refine the blood moon even as they absorbed the blood red energy.

“Someone came in!” Suddenly, amongst the dozen people, an old man enshrouded in darkness spoke.

The others reacted and were slightly surprised. “There are people capable of finding this place?”

Beside the old man enshrouded in darkness was a young man of extraordinary bearing, and his brows furrowed as he spoke. “Capable of entering this space? It seems this person’s strength is not weak.”

Another person stood up and requested, “Your Highness, let me go kill him!”

The old man within the darkness waved his hand as he said, “That’s not necessary. He’s already here, so we’ll wait for him here.” He barely finished that sentence, when he exclaimed in surprise, “Another one came in!”

The others exchanged glances of surprise.

“Do they belong to the same group?” the young man asked.

The old man’s eyes glimmered. “Not likely!”

He was the strongest amongst this dozen people, and he could sense that the first person and second person who entered seemed to be hurrying and chasing. It didn’t look like they belonged to the same group.

But is it a coincidence that these two people found this place at the same time?

“So what if there’s two of them, or even twenty to two hundred people? I alone am enough to deal with them!” A middle-aged expert with a scar on his face sneered. He was the same one who wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong.

The young man looked at the blood moon, “I didn’t expect it to be so difficult to refine, but even with more than a thousand years of effort, we’ve only managed to refine one-tenth of it. The progress is too slow!”

The old man calmly responded, “It’s easier said than done to take away a supreme treasure like the blood moon! Spending a hundred thousand years or more is nothing at all, and even if it takes a million years, it’s worth it!”

“Pavilion Master is right!”

Others chimed in agreement.

Then, they chattered in a relaxed manner, as if they were not concerned about the two people coming at them at all. With their strengths, no one in the Origin Holy World was worth their attention.

Before long, they saw Huang Xiaolong whistling across space, towards them. At this time, Huang Xiaolong had deactivated the Huang Long Armor, leaving merely the protective barrier of absolute blaze power.

“Oh, perfection-level of absolute blaze power,” the old man exclaimed softly, merely a little surprised. “No wonder you can reach this place!”

This person’s comprehension of absolute blaze power has reached perfection level, thus it is nothing strange that he could reach this space.

Though it was unexpected that Huang Xiaolong wielded perfection level absolute blaze power, the others weren’t really concerned about it. To them, it was merely perfection level of absolute blaze power. Amongst the thirteen elements, it ranked only ninth. Had it been the third-ranked power of nirvana, they might act slightly more vigilant.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong stopped some distance away from the group.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised to see a group of people waiting for his ‘arrival.’ He had not concealed his presence when he had entered this space, so it wasn’t surprising they detected his presence.

His gaze swept over the dozen people and finally stopped on the young man standing beside the old man enshrouded in darkness. Huang Xiaolong noticed that this person’s features bore some similarities to Huang Shuai!

From the features to bearing, there were seventy to eighty percent similarities. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

A thought flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind as he observed the young man and pointed out the young man’s identity, “Son of Mystic!”

The young man and others were genuinely surprised that Huang Xiaolong knew who he was in such a short time. He scrutinized Huang Xiaolong and asked, “Who are you?”

Logically speaking, Huang Xiaolong shouldn’t have known who he was. Other than the people present, no outsiders had seen him.

Seeing the young man’s reaction, Huang Xiaolong knew that he had guessed right, and he did not answer the Son of Mystic’s question. Instead, he turned and looked at the old man enshrouded in darkness. “Main Mystical Pavilion’s Pavilion Master?”

This old man fit the description the Origin Holy World Master Xiao Tianyi had given to Huang Xiaolong, it was very likely this old man was the Main Mystical Pavilion Master that Xiao Tianyi had once fought. But Xiao Tianyi couldn’t be sure whether this was the real or fake Main Pavilion Master, and neither could Huang Xiaolong ascertain it!

A sharp light glinted in the old man’s eyes. He stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong as if he wanted to see through Huang Xiaolong as his voice rang, “Looks like you came with a purpose!”

Came with a purpose!

Then, the blood moon wasn’t the only reason.

The rest quickly locked onto Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong admitted frankly despite the killing intent locked onto him from various directions, “That’s right!”

His answer dumbfounded everyone for a second, as no one had expected that Huang Xiaolong would admit it.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze finally shifted towards the enormous blood moon high in the air. “The blood moon is really here!”

Right at this time, the sounds of whistling winds accompanied Yuan Tianyi’s arrival.

“Peak major completion absolute blaze power, perfection level absolute earth power,” the old man stated as he looked at the absolute blaze and absolute earth barrier around Yuan Tianyi.

Yuan Tianyi ignored them, with his burning gaze fixed on the blood moon and declared to Huang Xiaolong, “The blood moon can only be mine!”

This was his warning to Huang Xiaolong!

If Huang Xiaolong dared to snatch it, he would be ruthless with him!
