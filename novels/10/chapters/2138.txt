Chapter 2139: A World Outside the 33 Heavens?!

The little cow, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the rest snapped awake as their jaws widened in shock when they stared at the bizarre happenings around them.

The purple lightning that the little cow could use had the ability to destroy and create. That was the reason why the little cow was revered as the ancestor of the demonic lightning. She was the only person in the world who had the ability to utilize lightning in such a way. Looking at what Huang Xiaolong did, the little cow stared at the scene before her in shock as there was no way she could replicate what he did.

The best the little cow could do was to restore someone’s battle ability and heal their injuries. What Huang Xiaolong did was a millionfold better than what the little cow was able to do!

A figure soon stepped out from the pillars of light.

When everyone saw the current Huang Xiaolong, they felt their souls trembling uncontrollably.

This is?

They felt as though they were looking at an ancient god who had the ability to wield lighting as he wished.

The lightning energy he controlled had the ability to influence life and death!

Life, death, yin, and yang were all under Huang Xiaolong’s control.

Spotting the shocked faces of his party members, Huang Xiaolong broke out into laughter. “What, you can’t recognize me now?”

The little cow nodded her head reflexively but shook her head immediately after.

“Xiaolong, you...?” The King of Grandmist asked in surprise.

Opening his mouth, he started to explain the situation, “I broke into the Sixth Order Sovereign Realm a year ago...” He knew what his master wanted to ask, and he wasn’t planning on hiding anything from them.

When they heard that he had already entered the Sixth Order Sovereign Realm, the little cow, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others stared at him with a face full of disbelief.

A bitter smile eventually appeared on the little cow’s face. “You brat, aren’t you too heaven-defying? If we were to compare ourselves to you, I think all of us should smash our heads against the wall to kill ourselves!”

Ordinarily, one had to take hundreds of millions of years to absorb origin energy to cultivate. Even a slight increase in strength would take an extremely long time! The only way for someone to boost their strength in a short amount of time was to refine origin treasures!

It went without saying that origin treasures were cabbages that grew on the side of the road. The Darkness Gold Fruit that came from the World of Darkness ripened every billion years!

Moreover, even if any of the overlords refined a level two origin treasure, they would never be able to mirror Huang Xiaolong’s increase in strength!

Ten years ago, Huang Xiaolong had barely entered the Fourth Order Sovereign Realm. Right now, he had already arrived at the Sixth Order Sovereign Realm!

It was even more surprising that he was a mid-Sixth Order Sovereign! Of course, everything had to do with the lightning bead, but everyone still found it hard to comprehend his rapid increase in strength.

Hearing what the little cow said, a smile broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Where in the world are you going to find a wall that can stop you?”

The little cow was struck speechless.

“Do you have news of the Heavenly Master, Wan Shi, and Tian Chen?” Huang Xiaolong decided to change the subject to something of greater importance. Now that he had fully devoured the lightning energy stored in the lightning bead, it was time for the Heavenly Master to meet his end. Not only had his strength risen dramatically, but he was also able to utilize the full strength of the lightning bead!

“There was news from an unknown source a few days ago...” Cang Mutian continued, “According to rumors, the Heavenly Master, Wan Shi, Tian Chen, and the rest of them entered the Heavenly Terror Country!”

“Heavenly Terror Country?” Huang Xiaolong raised his eyebrow.

After searching through Wan Yue’s memory, he had gained a basic understanding of the Heavenly Terror Country!

From what he had learned, the Heavenly Terror Country was one of the five greatest Heavenly Countries located on the Heavens Path! The ruler of the country was someone whose strength ranked in the top ten among the experts in the Heavens Path, and even though the Heavenly Master was also ranked in the top ten, his strength was far from the ruler of the Heavenly Terror Country!

From Wan Yue’s memory, Huang Xiaolong had learned that the ruler of the Heavenly Terror Country used to be the Grandmist Archdevil. Because he had run into some fortuitous encounter, the Archdevil bloodline in him had transformed into a Saint bloodline. With a Saint physique and a Complete Dao Saint Godhead, his strength had increased by a huge amount.

Despite knowing that the Heavenly Terror Country’s ruler was stronger than the Heavenly Master, Wan Yue had no idea how their strength deferred.

As for the little cow, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others, they only knew that Wan Shi was the only high-level Sovereign in existence. They had never come into any contact with the experts residing in the Heavens Path.

When they spoke of the matter with the Heavenly Terror Country, their faces turned grave.

“The Heavenly Master is borrowing the spiritual world of the Heavenly Terror Country to perfect his Divine Burial Grand Art. He should reach the great completion stage very soon. According to him, he plans to take your life the moment he’s done!” The little cow continued.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head half-heartedly. He really didn’t care too much about the Heavenly Master.

The only thing he was worried about right now was the ruler of the Heavenly Terror Country.

“Have you guys found out where the Heavenly Terror Country is?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Everyone shook their heads.

“Since this is the case, let’s look for the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool before anything else.” Huang Xiaolong thought about it for a second before making his decision. It’s more than enough for us to learn that the Heavenly Master ran to the Heavenly Terror Country.”

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong shot into the skies as he made his way to the location of the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool as marked on the map.

“It seems like I have to set up my own forces in the Heavenly World...” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. Even though he controlled Hell, the Radiance World, the Devil World, and others, none of his influence there could enter the Heavens Path. It caused him a big headache when he thought about the lack of espionage in the Heavens Path.

As long as he managed to cultivate a strong force in the Heavens Path, locating the Heavenly Terror Country would be nothing more than a single order away. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When Huang Xiaolong and the rest charged towards the location of the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool, a group of people appeared from nowhere as they appeared at the location marked on Huang Xiaolong’s map.

All of them were clad in scarlet red battle armors, and they seemed to be experts from a certain Heavenly Country. They were led by a middle-aged man with a scar on his face.

“Second brother, the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool seems close.” One of the bald men behind the middle-aged man said.

The man with the scar nodded his head, “Everyone split up into groups of ten and started looking for it! The ruler has ordered for us to obtain it at all cost!”

“Yes!” Everyone acknowledged before splitting off to find it.

“Big Brother, is the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool really so important to the ruler? It’s not even comparable to a level two origin treasure! Why did the ruler send out so many troops from our Heavenly Saint Country to look for it?!” The bald man questioned.

“Who cares about a single Fifth Earth Lightning Pool? The only thing that matters is gathering all nine great chaos lightning pools! As long as we gather all of them, we should be able to create something extremely terrifying! Our master flipped through countless ancient records and came to a conclusion that the nine chaos lightning pools had something to do with the world outside our 33 heavens!

“What?! A world outside our 33 heavens?!” The bald men gasped in surprise.
