Chapter 2511: I Should Have Thought of This!

With the three of them joining hands, the peak-tier holy arts of the three factions shot towards Huang XIaolong.

Terrifying waves of energy swept through the blood plains, and the lands seemed to tremble under their crushing might.

Even though there were a ton of True Saints around the battlefield, they couldn’t help but take several steps back in retreat.

Even though Chen Yi’s group and Lin Xiaoying were sent far away from the battlefield, they could feel the threat, and they beat a hasty retreat.

“Xiaolong, be careful!” Lin Xiaoying didn’t forget to scream as she moved backwards.

When Xiao Lengxue, and the other two heard her cries, a sinister smile broke out on their faces. Cruel light flashed in their eyes as they pushed themselves even further to send more energy into their attacks.

Under their combined strength, Huang Xiaolong was like a tiny ant ready to be crushed into paste.

Upon seeing that their attacks were about to land, another golden figure flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Dragon’s might filled the space around and an endless amount of heavenly dragons spared through the skies. The Blood Plains was transformed into a kingdom of dragons.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they realized that Huang Xiaolong had two holy souls!

“Two… That’s a second holy soul!”

When everyone was still trapped in a state of shock, another golden figure charged out from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

As soon as it appeared, darkness filled the skies. The Blood Plains transformed once again, into a land of the damned. The Blood Plains turned into the Devil’s Empire the moment Huang Xiaolong’s third holy soul emerged.

Xiao Lengxue and the others felt an explosion going off inside their heads as the blood drained from their faces. “Three! He has three holy souls!”

Three holy souls!

Huang Xiaolong possesses three great holy souls!

Chen Yi and the others were equally as shocked. Even Lin Xiaoying, who had seen both his holy souls before, didn’t believe her eyes. She had assumed that Huang Xiaolong had formed two holy souls and she was worried he wouldn’t be able to challenge all three of them with whatever little strength he had.

However, now that he had three holy souls…

As the three holy souls stood in the skies above Huang Xiaolong, the holy light emitted by them enveloped the heavens.

Everything else seemed to lose its color. Even the Polar Dawn Sword Law lost its shine, and the world of white was swallowed by the change.

“Prosperity of the Dragons!”

“Nirvana Purity Holy Art!”

“Epoch of Darkness!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to use all his ultimate skills at once.

As the heavenly dragons soared into the skies, countless buddhas started to attack his opponents. The space around them plunged into complete darkness and Huang Xiaolong started his counterattack.

Boom!

With three holy souls, two Primal Ancestor level grand dao secret art, and the strongest holy art from the Holy Heavens organization, Huang Xiaolong welcomed the three attacks from Xiao Lengxue and the others.

When the two parties slammed into each other, the Blood Plains shook as the space around them started to fluctuate.

The skies were filled with the roars of dragons, Buddhas’ chanting, and an unstoppable wave of darkness energy.

Terrifying waves of energy swept through the lands and everyone could only retreat once again.

The Blood Plains only managed to regain its calm after a long time. By the time the shockwaves scattered, silence filled the lands.

Everyone looked over and discovered that the battlefield had turned into a wasteland. The countless mountain peaks, that had stood tall among the plains, had turned into dust, and the hills were flattened. Several meters were scraped off the surface of the land and a massive crater remained.

As Xiao Lengxue and the other two were flung away from the battlefield, their bodies were stained red with blood. Xiao Lengxue fared the best out of the three, but the other two were close to death. Their arms were shattered and blood flowed from their seven orifices.

Huang Xiaolong took several steps back, and his face was pale.

Everyone couldn’t believe their eyes when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

All of them stared at the three holy souls with an unblinking gaze, and those who had mocked Huang Xiaolong previously, felt a sense of fear welling up in their hearts.

A seed was slowly forming deep down in the hearts of everyone present. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Chen Yi and Lin Xiaoying found it hard to suppress the surprise they had felt after discovering that Huang Xiaolong had three holy souls!

“I… I should have expected this…” Lin Xiaoying muttered to herself. After learning that Huang Xiaolong had managed to transform two divine souls into a holy soul, she should have expected for him to have a third one.

In fact, everyone knew about his evolving saint attributes. If they thought deeper, they should have guessed that Huang Xiaolong had three holy souls. However, it was too shocking for a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint to possess one holy soul. No one would think that he would have three of them!

When Huang Xiaolong tried to catch his breath, he activated the Dao Heart to suck in the pure holy spiritual qi from the core of the Holy World. His expression soon returned to normal as he started to make his way towards the three-men alliance.

As they saw that Huang Xiaolong was approaching, Xiao Lengxue, Bai Buren, and She Nanfeng struggled to get to their feet. It was especially so for Bai Buren and She Nanfeng, as they used all the remaining energy they had to stand up.

When the three of them crawled to their feet, Su Biqing, who had landed on the blood stele previously, opened his eyes. He stared at the three holy souls above Huang Xiaolong and failed to hide the shock on his face.

Xiao Lengxue wiped off the blood flowing down the side of his face, and he sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, it seems like we underestimated you!”

“But do you think that you have won?” Xiao Lengxue snorted, “I was merely unprepared to take on your attack.”

Huang Xiaolong rose into the air slowly and commenced another round of offensive. “We’ll see.”

…

Several minutes passed and Xiao Lengxue, Bai Buren, She Nanfeng, and Su Biqing laid motionless on the ground.

After sealing their holy energy, Huang Xiaolong tossed them into the Black Corpse Holy Ring.

After he was done, he slowly walked towards the blood stele.

By this time, Chen Yi, Lin Xiaoying, and the others had finally managed to digest everything that had happened.

“Xiaolong, this blood stele…” Lin Xiaoying wanted to remind Huang Xiaolong of its dangers, but his hand was already on the stele. With a smooth tug, he pulled the stele out from the ground. When he finally removed the entire stele, everyone realized that the blood stele was several tens of thousands of feet tall!

The scene where Huang Xiaolong uprooted the towering stele shocked everyone. It was especially so for the disciples of the other holy gates. All of them knew that Xiao Lengxue and the others had studied the blood stele for several days, and they had failed to budge it.

Whereas, Huang Xiaolong had managed to pull the entire stele from the ground with a single arm!

Could it be because of his holy souls?

Of course, how could any of them know that Huang Xiaolong had only managed to do so because of the Dao Heart?

Keeping the entire stele, Huang Xiaolong decided to refine it slowly.

He only managed to heave a sigh of relief after he was done. Even though he hadn’t refined the blood stele, it seemed as though it was really a piece of dao artifact! The power contained in it was unfathomable!

Since he had obtained the blood stele, Huang Xiaolong found no reason to saty there. Before he left, he used some sort of secret art to wipe the memories of Chen Yi and everyone present. Of course, he didn’t forget to wipe away Lin Xiaoying’s memory.

After all, he had managed to capture so many True Saints in the previous battle. If all of them died one day, the secret of his Dao Heart might be revealed to the world! After a period of consideration, Huang Xiaolong destroyed the memories of everyone in the Blood Plains.
