Chapter 3658: Should We Go Together?

“What did Zhu Chen go there for?” Huang Xiaolong asked Jian Wushuang.

“This… I’m not too sure. Why don’t I get them to make a detailed investigation?” Jian Wushuang replied.

Grunting slightly, Huang Xiaolong thought of the various possibilities. There was no way Zhu Chen would go over to the Fengdu City for fun.

“Lord, why don’t we head over to the Fengdu City after ascending the Heavenly Peak?” Tao Han’er asked.

“Fengdu City? Why do you want to go to Fengdu City?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Hehe, the city is the number one city in the Green Ghost Lands. It’s also one of the five greatest cities in our Unknown Lands! I heard that everyone there is a ghost spirit… I wish to take a look!” Tao Han’er giggled.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Those who remain in the Fengdu City for a long time are indeed ghost spirits. The yin qi in the city is extremely strong. Those who are weaker wouldn’t dare to stay there for long. You’re just a Second Resurrection Dao Venerable… You can’t stay for more than two seconds in the city…”

Jian Wushuang and the others burst out laughing.

Tao Han’er pouted, “Hmph! You’re bullying me again! In the future, I’ll continue to cultivate and enter the Universe God Realm! You can’t laugh at me anymore when that happens!”

Huang Xiaolong tried to contain his laughter and he replied, “Wow, that’s quite a goal…”

Another round of laughter ensued.

Tao Han’er glared at him and snapped, “Why can’t I have a target when you have one of you own?”

Jian Wushuang whispered at the side, “Han’er, do not speak to the Lord so disrespectfully!”

Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong dismissed Jian Wushuang’s worries. “Don’t worry about it.”

He then turned to Tao Han’er and smiled, “Alright, we’ll see who enters the Universe God Realm first!”

“That’s unfair! You already have more than 20 billion units of grand cosmos energy! I haven’t even formed my first strand! You’ll definitely be faster than me!” Tao Han’er complained softly.

Wu Xin and the others roared with laughter when they heard what she said.

She was the little happy pill that entertained everyone along the way. Because of her, their journey became much more enjoyable.

Almost a month later, they arrived.

Huang Xiaolong kept the Universe Boat and looked at the majestic city standing before him. The Zhu Lan City seemed boundless, and the mountain ranges contained within were like pillars that propped up the heavens! Huang Xiaolong couldn’t even see the peak of it!”

Even with three dao souls operating at full power, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see the tallest peak!

That was what the Heavenly Peak was…

It was one of the greatest wonders of the Unknown Lands.

Ordinarily, the Heavenly Peak would be shrouded in clouds and the restrictions around it would be frighteningly strong. The clouds would scatter once every few eras. Anyone could take the chance to ascend the Heavenly Peak.

When the clouds returned and the restrictions came back, not even experts at the level of the five overlords had the ability to force their way up. The Heavenly Peak seemed to contain the power of the universe origin. It was the power that stopped anyone from trying to force their way up, and it was the power that scattered together with the clouds.

“Lord, the clouds around the peak have scattered.” Tao Han’er pointed in the distance and cheered.

Indeed. The clouds seemed to have been torn apart by some unnatural power as the peak was revealed to the world.

“Lord Huang, the Heavenly Peak is about to be fully open…” Yu Xiaohong reminded him from the side.

Nodding, Huang Xiaolong said, “We’ll head over right now.”

Just as Huang Xiaolong and his group of experts were about to head over to the city, a group of cultivators appeared behind them.

“Are you also here to climb the Heavenly Peak?” One of the middle aged men in the group called out to them.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the newcomers and discovered that they were Dao Venerables who had comprehended twelve to thirteen elements to the grand perfection level. The person who spoke to them was a Dao Venerable who had comprehended thirteen elements to the grand perfection level.

“Yeah!” Huang Xiaolong replied casually.

“I am Chen Bi of the Feihong Celestial Empire. I am the young master of the Chen Family, and I wonder where fellow cultivator came from!” The middle aged man smiled.

“Feihong Celestial Empire?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Jian Wushuang smiled, “The old ancestor of their celestial empire is a God of Creation at the small completion stage.”

Huang Xiaolong understood the hidden meaning behind Jian Wushuang’s words immediately.

In that case, the Chen Family was nothing more than a tiny blip in the Zhu Lan Lands.

If the old ancestor of their celestial empire was a God of Creation at the small completion stage, the old ancestor of the Chen Family couldn’t be much stronger.

When Chen Bi overheard Jian Wushuang’s introduction of their celestial empire, a proud smile appeared on his face. “The old ancestor of my Chen Family is also a God of Creation at the small completion stage, comparable to the old ancestor of the celestial empire!” A confident smile appeared on his face and he glanced at Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er from the corner of his eye.

His actions didn’t escape Huang Xiaolong’s observations and a chuckle rang in his ear. “Oh! Excuse us! Your old ancestor is actually a God of Creation at the small completion stage!”

Tao Han’er and the rest nearly burst out laughing.

Did the man who soloed nearly ten thousand Gods of Creation back at the Jian Family, including the terrifying Jian Wushuang whose combat strength broke through the 20 billion units mark say ‘excuse me’ to the grandson of a God of Creation at the small completion stage?!

Chen Bi didn’t understand the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words and he continued haughtily, “I wonder which powerful expert stands behind your family?”

Ordinarily, those who had the ability to come to the Heavenly Peak were disciples of great powers. Those powers naturally had God of Creation Realm experts at the helm.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “My father is called Huang Long and you can call me Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang Long?” A look of confusion appeared on Chen Bi’s face. He tried to rack his brains and he couldn’t think of anyone with that name in the God of Creation Realm.

“Young Master, he might not even be a God of Creation. From the looks of it, his Huang Family might be some third-rate family from some random continent…” One of the young men beside Chen Bi whispered into his ear.

There were always exceptions to those who came to climb the Heavenly Peak.

Chen Bi chuckled after hearing what his clansman said. “As it turns out, Brother Huang is from the great Huang Family! Why don’t we ascend the peak together?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Wu Xin, Ye Ye, Yu Xiaohong, Jian Wushuang, and the others were trying their best to hold in their laughter when they caught a stare from Huang Xiaolong. They swallowed their response to Chen Bi and Huang Xiaolong turned to reply, “Sure!”

Chen Bi’s group ended up joining Huang Xiaolong’s squad of Gods of Creation as they headed towards the Zhu Lan City.

“How can I address the two beauties?” Chen Bi asked Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er all of a sudden.

A frown formed on Yu Xiaohong’s face. After all, she had the ability to wipe out his entire family with a flick of her fingers. She was too lazy to respond to a junior at his level.

Tao Han’er, on the other hand, was only at the Dao Venerable Realm. She replied softly, “I am Tao Han’er…”

“Oh! Young Lady Tao Han’er. I didn’t think that you would try to ascend the Heavenly Peak at the Second Resurrection Dao Venerable Realm. Please follow behind me later. I’ll protect you.” Chen Bi laughed.

“My granddaughter doesn’t need your protection…” Jian Wushuang growled at the side.

Stunned, Chen Bi replied to Jian Wushuang politely. “Sorry, I didn’t think that you were her grandfather! My apologies!”

Jian Wushuang didn’t bother looking his way and neither did he give a response.

Stuck in an awkward situation, Chen Bi turned to Huang Xiaolong who seemed the friendliest of the bunch and asked, “Brother Huang, how many times have you tried to ascend the Heavenly Peak?”

“This is my first time.”

Nodding slightly, Chen Bi explained, “This is my third time ascending the Heavenly Peak! The process places emphasis on your dao heart and your comprehension of the grand dao laws. When I came for the first time, I only managed to reach the 30th platform. On my second try, I managed to reach the 80th platform!”

One of the disciples of the Chen Family interrupted, “Our young master will reach the 100th platform this time and break through to the God of Creation Realm!”
