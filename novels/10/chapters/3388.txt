Chapter 3389: Golden Brow Arhat

Yang Kai might be an Immortal Emperor and as the favorite disciple of the Maitreya Buddha, his name shook the five continents. However, the Myriad Treasures Dao Master was on a whole new level!

The Myriad Treasures Dao Master was a disciple of the Heaven Piercing Sage! He fought in the ancient wars, and his name could strike fear into the hearts of many! Yang Kai was a newbie when compared to him!

Naturally, Yang Kai’s strength was like a baby’s when compared to the Myriad Treasures Dao Master.

Yang Kai might be at the Second Level Immortal Emperor Realm, but he was a mere junior when compared to old experts like that.

During the war of ancient times, the Myriad Treasures Dao Master was already at the high-level Immortal Emperor Realm. Yang Kai hadn’t been accepted as a disciple of the Maitreya Buddha then!

There weren't many people in the five continents who were unaware of the Myriad Treasures Dao Master!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly when he looked at Huang Xiaochun. “That’s exactly the guy I’m looking for.”

Doyen Huang Xiaochun of the Azure Sword Immortal Gate stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence for a long time before breaking out into laughter. “Is Brother Huang a big shot in the Immortal World?!”

“I don’t know if you will consider me a big shot, but even the sages would have to kneel in my presence. The number of immortals under me cannot be counted.”

In the Huang Long and Blazing Dragon World, it was true that Huang Xiaolong controlled countless experts. Even the number of Dao Venerables was uncountable, much less those in the Immortal Realm…

Huang Xiaochun roared with laughter the moment Huang Xiaolong spoke. “Brother, you’re too f*cking funny!”

“Did the Myriad Treasures Dao Master ascend to a holy being?” Huang Xiaolong changed the topic all of a sudden.

“I have no idea.” Huang Xiaochun shook his head. “Many rumors are going around about the Myriad Treasures Dao Master, but no one can be sure of anything. Some say that he’s half a step into the ascension, and there are others who say that he has already attained enlightenment.”

“Also, there are others who say that he’s planning to convert himself to become a Buddha!”

“No one is sure of what is going on right now…”

Huang Xiaochun dropped a bomb all of a sudden. “Brother Huang, are you married?”

Huang Xiaolong stared at him with his eyebrows raised in confusion.

“I didn’t mean it any other way!” Huang Xiaochun shook his arms and laughed. “Since we’re fated to meet, I have a little sister that I wish to introduce you to.”

That was the first time Huang Xiaolong felt beads of cold sweat dripping down his forehead when he spoke about matters of marriage to someone else other than his mother.

“My little sister really causes us a lot of worry… You have no idea. My parents tried to matchmake her in the past, but she didn’t like any of them!” Huang Xiaochun sighed. “She said that she likes men with a sense of humor. From what I can see, you’re extremely suitable.”

Humorous?!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly. Huang Xiaochun thought that he was messing around when he admitted to killing Yang Kai and possessing tons of subordinates.

Laughing in amusement, the two of them continued to banter for two whole hours as they made their way over to the platform where the Golden Brow Arhat was giving the lecture.

The platform was tens of thousands of feet tall, and it was surrounded by golden light. Experts were packed like sardines under the platform as they waited for him to start.

“There’s quite a lot of people here,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Even if there weren’t a hundred million experts present, they should number in the upper tens of millions. It was bustling with activity.

Huang Xiaochun nodded his head. “Of course! Yang Kai might be the Maitreya Buddha’s favorite disciple, but he cultivated for a short amount of time! The Golden Brow Arhat’s dao is way more intricate and pure than what Yang Kai understood. After all, he took part in the ancient war.”

“During that war, countless experts were embroiled in battle. The entire Immortal World was stained with blood. Many Golden Immortals, Immortal Kings, Immortal Venerables, and Immortal Emperors fell.”

Huang Xiaochun explained on and on as Huang Xiaolong stared straight at the platform. He looked at the entrance of the Myriad Buddha World in interest.

There were countless disciples guarding the entrance, and one needed to cross the platform where the Golden Brow Arhat planned to give his lecture.

A ray of golden light emerged from the entrance of the Myriad Buddha World and it landed on the platform. A figure with dazzling golden eyebrows could be seen on the platform after the golden light faded.

The person who appeared was precisely the Golden Brow Arhat.

Those who were there to listen to his lecture fell to their knees as they cheered incessantly.

Huang Xiaochun revealed a look of excitement as he yelled, “The Golden Brow Arhat is here!” He planned to kneel, and he grabbed Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad he couldn’t budge the man no matter how hard he tried.

Huang Xiaolong remained standing with his arms clasped behind him.

“Quick! Kneel!” Huang Xiaochun yelled.

“Even if Buddha Rulai appears, he’s not qualified to make me kneel,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Huang Xiaochun stared at Huang Xiaolong as panic started to set in. He couldn’t understand if Huang Xiaolong was delusional or not.

A ray of light emerged from the Golden Brow Arhat’s eyes as he turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

It was clear that he heard everything Huang Xiaolong said.

“Preposterous! How dare you disrespect the almighty Buddha Rulai?!” The Golden Brow Arhat roared.

When everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong they broke out into an uproar. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Who the hell does he think he is?! Get him out of our Western Niuhe Continent!”

“That’s letting him off too lightly! We cannot allow him to leave!”

Angry voices filled the skies.

Almost every single cultivator in the Western Niuhe Continent cultivated the Buddhist arts. No one would stand for any disrespect to their greatest master!

As the furious roars filled the skies, even the Immortal Kings in the audience screamed in rage.

Not even an Immortal King would be able to stand up to the backlash from the various experts in the crowd. What a shame Huang Xiaolong wasn’t an existence they could shake no matter how hard they tried.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong stepped into the air as he walked towards the platform.

“The audacity! Get down here right now!” One of the Immortal Kings in the crowd sent a punch towards Huang Xiaolong when he saw the other party standing above his head.

When his fist slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s body, a terrifying force smashed into that Immortal King’s body as blood streamed from his lips.

Everyone stared at him in shock.

The Golden Brow Arhat was no exception. With his eyes focusing on Huang Xiaolong, Buddhist lights surrounded him. Like a flower, the golden rays bloomed as they charged straight into the nine heavens. Tearing through space, the golden rays filled the space around him.

Everyone couldn’t help but chant the Buddhist mantra as the area around them turned into a holy kingdom.

It was too bad their attempt to stop Huang Xiaolong couldn’t slow him down for a second as he continued to walk towards the Golden Brow Arhat.

Seeing how Huang Xiaolong wasn’t affected, the Golden Brow Arhat gasped in shock. Even Immortal Emperors wouldn’t be able to do what he did!

When doubt flashed through the Golden Brow Arhat’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong arrived on the platform.
