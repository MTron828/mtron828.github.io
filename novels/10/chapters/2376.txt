Chapter 2377: Encountering the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate Again

Devour True Saints’ holy souls!

After possessing that ability, Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul’s power would reach a terrifying degree.

While Huang Xiaolong strung along the Departing Sword Sage in his quest for grandmist holy spiritual aura and holy lake, the Holy Lands Alliance’s experts got word that Huang Xiaolong had separated from the Clear Snow Palace’s group.

“Elder Wang Yuan, this is a good opportunity!” Yu Fujiang almost could not contain his excitement, “Without those nosy women, we definitely can capture that kid alive! That Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast is ours!”

“That’s right, although that Departing Sword Sage is quite powerful, he alone is not enough to protect that punk!”

Wang Yuan’s personal disciple Li Zhang agreed loudly, “Master, we must find that punk quickly, or else the Devil Palace or Blue Whale Race might get ahead of us. They probably already know that the punk has separated from the Clear Snow Palace group before us.”

Wang Yuan nodded in agreement, “Alright, we’ll head back the way we came, and track that kid as fast as possible!” Recalling his defeat to the Departing Sword Sage in front of so many people, he couldn’t swallow that foul breath!

Furthermore, their Holy Lands Alliance had sent more than one True Saint expert. There were two True Saints in his camp!

After counting True Reason Saint Fan Xia and Qianyuan Saint Feng Cheng, there were four True Saints powerhouses on their side!

The power of four True Saints was more than enough to destroy the Departing Sword Sage’s body and deal severe damage to his holy soul!

Wang Yuan’s group acted quickly, returning the way they came back to the earlier location.

True Reason Saint Fan Xia took out an eyeball that emitted a gloomy dark glow. This eyeball seemed to be able to see through everything, its sight penetrating through time and space.

“That kid went that way!” True Reason Saint Fan Xiao pointed towards the north. This direction was indeed where Huang Xiaolong and the Departing Sword Sage had flown off after separating from the Clear Snow Palace’s group.

“Chase!” Wang Yuan and the rest turned into streaks of light and chased towards the north.

Not long after Wang Yuan’s group disappeared in the horizon, the Blue Whale Race, Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, and Devil Palace’s experts appeared consecutively at the same location. Each party used their own method to determine Huang Xiaolong’s direction of departure, and they immediately began their pursuit!

Roughly two hours later, when Huang Xiaolong was passing over a swamp area, he suddenly stopped, and sneered coldly after sensing the powerful auras directed at him, “They came quite fast.”

He had three powerful holy souls. Therefore, his senses were much stronger than the Departing Sword Sage, due to which he detected the Holy Lands Alliance experts pursuing them first.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, the Departing Sword Sage was baffled at first, but he soon detected the Holy Lands Alliance’s experts, who were coming for them.

“It’s Wang Yuan’s group!” The Departing Sword Sage’s gaze turned icy in an instant, then he asked Huang Xiaolong, “Young Master, should we find a place, and avoid them for some time?”

“Avoid?” Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly as he answered, “There is no need for that.”

He stayed to look for holy herbs as well as the origin treasures his tasks required. If he had to find a place to hide, why would he have remained in the Profound River? He might as well leave the Profound River with the Clear Snow Palace’s group.

The Departing Sword Sage wanted to persuade Huang Xiaolong after hearing his response. But Huang Xiaolong activated the Darkness Holy Ring’s darkness boundary, enveloping him, the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast, and Departing Sword Sage. Two people and one beast suddenly vanished from the spot without a trace.

“This, this is a high-grade saint artifact?!” The Departing Sword Sage was bewildered as he stared at the black, ordinary looking ring on Huang Xiaolong’s finger.

“Yes,” Huang Xiaolong grinned as he added, “Come on.”

Huang Xiaolong had already flown some distance ahead when the Departing Sword Sage finally recovered his senses. Although he already knew that Huang Xiaolong had three saint artifacts, and he had only seen the Barbarian Space’s lightning bead, he was unaware what the other two saint artifacts were. Subconsciously, he had assumed the remaining two of Huang Xiaolong’s saint artifacts to be low-grade saint artifacts.

After all, the sad fact was that it was nothing strange that a holy ground’s patriarch did not own a mid-grade saint artifact.

But what had he just seen?!

High-grade saint artifact?!

The Departing Sword Sage could not describe the shock he felt. His mouth parted, as questions hung at the edge of his lips, but he hesitated to ask.

“You want to know my identity?” Huang Xiaolong asked smilingly.

The Departing Sword Sage nodded as he looked at Huang Xiaolong with anticipation.

“You will know in the future.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. “When I leave the Profound River, I will return to the holy gate.” Once he was back at the Holy Heavens, the Departing Sword Sage would know who he was. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After hearing this, the Departing Sword Sage stopped asking further questions.

“Don’t worry, I would not let you serve me for nothing.” Huang Xiaolong said as he took out the Purple Yang Vine, and said, “This is for you.”

The Departing Sword Sage blanked for a second, and his brain failed to register Huang Xiaolong’s words. “For, for me?!”

As a True Saint expert, how could he not understand how valuable and rare a holy herb was.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “That’s right, you have a fire element saint godhead, this Purple Yang Vine is useful to you. In the future, every one hundred years, I will give you a holy herb, take it as your compensation for serving me!”

One hundred years, one holy herb!

The Departing Sword Sage reacted and took a deep breath. Even for someone like him, it was hard not to feel excited.

It was needless to say how important holy herbs were to a True Saint expert. Still, the age old problem remained the same, holy herbs were difficult to find. Thus, the majority of holy grounds’ True Saint experts consume high-grade, level-ten origin spiritual pills when they cultivate.

Now, Huang Xiaolong had promised to give him one holy herb for every one hundred years of service. This compensation was simply too lucrative to speak of!

Even if it was one holy herb for ten thousand years of service, the Departing Sword Sage was absolutely certain there would be a lot of True Saint experts willing to be Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates.

“Young Master, thank you!” The words seemed to have taken a lot out of him.

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled.

Four days quickly went by.

Though Huang Xiaolong didn’t find any grandmist holy spiritual aura or holy lake during these four days, his luck was still good. He found several holy herbs, and also several origin treasures required by his tasks.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong also tamed a dozen profound beasts. Not all of these profound beasts were peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint, and the weakest was still at the strength of a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint.

With more than a dozen Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint profound beasts, in addition to the holy spiritual array Huang Xiaolong taught them, as well as the buoyant effects of Profound River, Huang Xiaolong’s group was more than enough to hinder any First Heaven True Saint expert.

On this day, after Huang Xiaolong tamed another peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint profound beast, a group of people suddenly appeared on the horizon.

As he saw the familiar face among them, the corners of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth curved into a smile.

Scarlet Flame Holy Gate! Chen Zifeng!

As Huang Xiaolong had not activated his Darkness Holy Ring’s darkness boundary, the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s Chen Zifeng and the others soon spotted Huang Xiaolong and the Departing Sword Sage.

Chen Zifeng’s expression turned sullen in an instant upon spotting Huang Xiaolong, but his composure returned swiftly. A cold sneer escaped his lips, and he spoke to the old man in front of him, “Master, it’s Thirteen that punk!”

The old man, Yu Jizhang, nodded his head as his gaze locked onto the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast under Huang Xiaolong. A smile brightened his old face as he said, “Looks like our luck is good, we found this Thirteen before the Devil Palace, and Holy Lands Alliance.”

He then led the group of Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s experts, flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

It was not strange that the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s group was acting so fearless at this time. Yu Jizhang, one the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s Hall Master, was a mid-First Heaven True Saint expert. In terms of strength and cultivation realm, he was stronger than the Nine Plains Holy Gate’s Wang Yuan. Moreover, the middle-aged man beside Yu Jizhang was a deputy hall master of the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, a True Saint expert.
