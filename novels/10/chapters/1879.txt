Huang Xiaolong understood the meaning of Cang Yuanzong’s words. Cang Yuanzong wanted him to help expel the black-copper ghostly creatures from the previous Heavenly Dragon Bear Race’s Patriarch Cang Mutian’s body.

What dumbfounded Huang Xiaolong was the so-called black-copper ghostly creatures. What the heck were they? They were so terrifying that even a powerful Sovereign Realm expert like Cang Mutian could not expel them from his body and was reduced to sealing himself...

“You mean you want our help to expel the black-copper ghostly creatures from your Master Cang Mutian’s body?” Huang Xiaolong wanted to make sure he hadn’t misunderstood. “But, even when your Master couldn’t solve this problem, how can you be certain that I can?”

Gao Changran, Lu Xiaoqing, and the others looked inquiringly at Can’t Yuanzong. That was also the question in their minds.

Though Huang Xiaolong was the Lord of Hell, his cultivation was just at the mid of the Ninth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

“Perhaps you can’t do it now, but in the future, you might be able to expel the black-copper ghostly creatures completely,” said Cang Yuanzong.

Huang Xiaolong actually felt more baffled hearing that.

“According to what I know, the Heavenly Hall’s inheritance you have obtained comes from the Radiance World’s first-generation Radiance Ancestor.” Cang Yuanzong went on, “Wait until you’ve stepped into Emperor Realm and obtained the full inheritance of the Radiance Ancestor, then you would be able to control the Radiance World’s origin power. At that time, you would be able to exterminate the black-copper ghostly creatures in my Master’s body!”

Realization dawned on Huang Xiaolong, ‘So, it was like that.’

“The Heavenly Hall’s inheritance you have gotten at the moment should only be half of it, am I right?” Cang Yuanzong asked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely shocked; no one knew about this. How did Cang Yuanzong know?

Under Cang Yuanzong’s gaze that seemed to see through everything, Huang Xiaolong admitted frankly, “That is correct, I have only gotten half of the inheritance.”

Cang Yuanzong nodded at Huang Xiaolong’s frankness. “Half of the inheritance is enough to help my Master suppress the black-copper ghostly creatures. As long as you do that successfully, my Master would be able to wake up temporarily, instead of being in slumber for eternity. I can lend you the Heavenly Origin Stone after he wakes up. When you have gotten the entire inheritance in the future, you would be able to help my Master to get rid of his troubles completely.”

Huang Xiaolong barely wasted any time to think it through. He agreed promptly, “That is not a problem.”

To him, that was merely the effort of extending a helping hand.

Not to mention that Cang Mutian could be considered as a good friend of the previous Lord of Hell, an elder from a certain aspect. Hence, he had help if possible.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong agree so easily, Cang Yuanzong’s gaze became kinder as he smiled, “Then I shall thank Lord Nether King on behalf of my Master in advance.”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, smiling sincerely, “Patriarch Yuanzong is too polite.”

Cang Yuanzong led the group from the hall towards the mountain behind the Dragon Bear Valley, the True Dragon Mountain. When Cang Mutian had decided to seal himself, he had set his place of slumber at the True Dragon Mountain.

Leaving the Dragon Bear Valley, the group flew for ten minutes to reach the True Dragon Mountain.

Looking at the True Dragon Mountain in front of him, Huang Xiaolong finally realized why it was called the True Dragon Mountain. This True Dragon Mountain was actually a fossil of a real dragon.

The entire mountain was formed from the corpse of a whole dragon. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although this dragon had been dead for many years, it still exuded an awe-inspiring dragon might, and Huang Xiaolong, who possessed the True Dragon Physique, had the strongest feeling.

Before this dragon had died, it was also a Sovereign Realm existence.

However, Huang Xiaolong found it strange that there was a dragon corpse in the vicinity of the Dragon Bear Valley. Does this Dragon Bear Valley have some connections with the ancient dragon clan? Or perhaps, are they related to the Dragon World?

While these thoughts ran through Huang Xiaolong’s mind, the group had already landed on the peak of True Dragon Mountain.

Cang Yuanzong formed a series of seals with his hands and flicked them into the mountain wall. Seconds later, a large boulder shook and revealed an opening wide enough to accommodate ten people together.

“Lord Nether King, please.” Cang Yuanzong politely invited Huang Xiaolong.

“Please.” Huang Xiaolong responded with courtesy.

Cang Yuanzong and Huang Xiaolong walked side by side and entered within. The group descended following the stone steps.

It was a long stone staircase, and there were more than several thousand steps. It took the group some time to reach the bottom as they arrived at a huge square.

At the center of this enormous square was a big stone stage that resembled an altar. On this altar lay a burly middle-aged man.

This middle-aged man was Cang Mutian, entangled by the black-copper ghostly creatures.

Cang Mutian, once the devil beasts’ most powerful existence, was lying here quietly. He had been lying here for billions of years.

The edges of the stone altar were engraved with a myriad of sacred creatures that were linked together with mysterious runes. This generated a strong sacred power that enveloped Cang Mutian lying at the center, preventing his physical body from deteriorating.

Two old men were guarding at different corners of the stone altar.

When they saw Cang Yuanzong, they hurried forward and saluted, "Patriarch."

Cang Yuanzong nodded his head at them. While they were still baffled why Cang Yuanzong would come down with a Heavenly Monarch kid, Cang Yuanzong introduced Huang Xiaolong to them, “This here is the Lord Nether King. He has a way to suppress the black-copper ghostly creatures within the Old Patriarch’s body. I invited him over to help the Old Patriarch.”

Lord Nether King?!

Both were startled hearing that. They naturally understand what the title Lord Nether King represented.

“Cang Dongyi,”

“Cang Zhaoyu,”

“Pays respect to the Lord Nether King.”

Both old men greeted Huang Xiaolong politely. Even though both were peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts, neither was reckless enough to put on haughty airs in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, returning their greetings. Then he stepped onto the stone altar following Cang Yuanzong while the four odd beasts, Gao Changran, Lu Xiaoqing, and the rest, waited in the distance.

Although Cang Mutian was lying on the stone altar, there was a sacred power elevating his body one meter from the stone altar’s surface.

Even though Cang Mutian had sealed himself and was in deep slumber, Huang Xiaolong’s heart was pounding, standing beside him.

When facing his Master, the King of Grandmist and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming Huang Xiaolong had felt the same way.

Cang Yuanzong respectfully saluted towards Cang Mutian before he faced Huang Xiaolong and said, “Lord Nether King, I’ll leave the rest to you.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, then he leaped into the air above Cang Mutian and sat cross-legged. Next, the Heavenly Hall appeared above Huang Xiaolong’s head, and under the fourteen Radiance Angels’ power, the golden hexagon rune pillar emerged, emitting pulses of sacred energy rushing out like a waterfall.

Hearing how terrifying the black-copper ghostly creatures were from the others, Huang Xiaolong had all fourteen Radiance Angels to send all their power into the Heavenly Hall. At the same time, he took out the Radiance Divine Scepter. When the sacred golden light from the hexagon rune pillar rushed down, the crescent moon on top of the Radiance Divine Scepter shot out a torrent of moon blades.

The moment the hexagon rune pillar’s sacred energy rushed down, an ear-piercing, shrill shriek came from Cang Mutian’s body. Huang Xiaolong’s soul felt as if it was going to rip apart at this penetrating noise.

Huang Xiaolong’s face tightened solemnly.

In the next second, he saw a black fog fly out from Cang Mutian’s body that resembled an ancient black coffin. The dense nefarious qi and ghost qi coming from this black fog far exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s imagination.

No more chaps today!
