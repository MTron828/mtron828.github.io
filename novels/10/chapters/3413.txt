Chapter 3414: Meeting the Heaven Piercing Sage and the Heavenless Devil Ancestor

“She’s right.” Ying Gou, who had been silent all this while, sighed. “Even if we know that the Pangu Immortal Cave exists, it won’t be easy to find.”

Huang Xiaolong reached into the void and grabbed something. Soon after, a lion-headed beast appeared in front of them, and everyone was shocked to discover that the lion-headed beast was as strong as the Yin Yang Devil Ancestor!

The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor was the second strongest expert in the Devil World, and the beast Huang Xiaolong casually grabbed was no weaker than him!

In his hands, the beast was like a docile little kitten.

Huang Xiaolong shot a ray of purple light into the beast’s head, and Huang Xiaolong could guess that it knew something about the Devil Forest. After all, it was one of the original inhabitants of the forest.

A look of disappointment formed on his face when he discovered nothing important after the soul search.

Even though he managed to learn a lot of secrets of the Devil Forest, the beast knew nothing about the Pangu Immortal Cave.

“Bring me to the other genesis-level beasts.” Huang Xiaolong commanded.

Now, he could only hope that the other creatures would have an idea.

“Yes, Your Highness!” The lion-headed beast nodded hurriedly as he brought Huang Xiaolong and the others deeper into the forest.

There were tons of genesis-level beasts all around, and Huang Xiaolong’s group managed to locate more than twenty of them in an hour!

All of them had terrifying strength. Even if the Yin Yang Devil Ancestor, Ying Gou, and the Holy Phoenix ran into a single one, they would be in trouble. They might not lose in a fight, but neither would victory come easy. However, the beasts were nothing more than domestic pets Huang Xiaolong could grab with ease.

Despite there being so many of them, Huang Xiaolong didn’t manage to find anything related to the Pangu Immortal Cave.

“How in the world did the Heaven Piercing Sage and Heavenless receive news of the cave?!” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor was starting to grow curious.

So was Huang Xiaolong.

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong turned to look in a certain direction and he gasped in shock.

“Huh?!”

Without explaining himself, he leaped off the Holy Phoenix’s back. “Wait for me here.”

In an instant, he disappeared.

The four of them stared at each other in silence.

“Did His Highness discover something?” Ying Gou whispered.

…

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong appeared above a giant sea that was shifting through space.

That was right. It was an actual sea.

The sea contained water that was the color of jade, and it was extremely mesmerizing. It was like a giant piece of jade that drifted across space.

That was one of the wonders of the universe.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste his time as he tore through the water to arrive at the ocean bed.

As soon as he arrived, he discovered that it was another space altogether. Palaces lined the ocean bed, and he quickly approached them.

He was in no rush to enter, and Huang Xiaolong only reached out after a period of observation. A giant hole was formed, and he was sucked into the area that contained the palaces.

After he entered, he quickly approached one of them.

“Pangu Manor!”

Indeed!

That was the place!

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

All of a sudden, a shock wave emerged from the distance.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Sword qi that continued the power to shake the heavens appeared in the distance, but no matter how strong it was, it failed to break the light barrier around the region.

Howls filled the skies as the aura of a terrifying beast emerged from the assailant. The aura was horrifyingly strong, and it was the strongest Huang Xiaolong had seen in the Pangu World! He could tell that the beast was several times stronger than Rulai!

Despite the powerful sword qi and beast aura, a cloud of devil qi emerged and suppressed the both of them.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when he noticed the powers in the air.

The sword qi probably belonged to the Heaven Piercing Sage, but the beast aura was a mystery. It seemed to be stronger than the Heaven Piercing Sage. As for the devil qi, it most likely belonged to the Heavenless Devil Ancestor.

It managed to suppress the other two existences, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but turn his attention to the battle.

With several quick steps, he arrived at the battlefield.

He saw two figures fighting with a beast in a plaza somewhere in the area. The youngster who was waving four swords about should be the Heaven Piercing Sage, and the Heavenless Devil Ancestor was a strange looking man with a twelve petaled black lotus around him. His face was filled with devil runes, and his black lotus was pretty similar to the one Rulai used. The only difference was the color.

The giant beast they were fighting was a beast that slightly resembled a qilin. It had a lion’s head, and it had golden eyes. Its body was jade green in color, and icy blue water surrounded its body.

“Jade Sea Golden Eyed Beast!”

Huang Xiaolong recognized it instantly. The giant beast was said to be the beast with the greatest talent in the universe!

When Huang Xiaolong appeared suddenly, the three of them were shocked.

The battle paused instantly.

The Heavenless Devil Ancestor stared at Huang Xiaolong doubtfully.

Even though the three of them were staying quiet, they were accessing Huang Xiaolong. They had no idea how he entered, and if he managed to do so, he wouldn’t be that weak.

“How should we address you, fellow cultivator?” THe Heaven Piercing Sage was the first to break the silence.

“Huang Xiaolong.”

“It’s you!” The Heavenless Devil Ancestor jumped in fright and he retreated hastily.

The Heaven Piercing Sage and the beast were frightened when they saw the Heavenless Devil Ancestor’s reaction. They didn’t understand why he would be so agitated after hearing a name.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the old devil and sneered, “I went to your palace to look for you, but you managed to escape… Are you surprised to see that your Boundless Devil Qi failed to hurt me?”

Forcing a smile on his face, the Heavenless Devil Ancestor chuckled, “Lord Huang is mistaken! Why would I plot against you when we’re not even enemies?”

“Didn’t you get people to spread rumors about me being the Innate Devil Ancestor?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

“That’s not me! If someone from the palace caused you trouble, I’ll hand them over to you!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother wasting time with him. He started to approach the old devil and he thought about dealing with the Heavenless Devil Ancestor before asking the Heaven Piercing Sage about the Pangu Sword.

When the other two heard how the old devil addressed Huang Xiaolong, their hearts started to palpitate in fear. Why would the strongest expert in the Devil World try to please some random guy they never heard of?!
