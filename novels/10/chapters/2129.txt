Chapter 2130: Tian Chen’s Treasury

“What?!”

Wan Shi and the others couldn’t help but stare at Tian Chen in shock.

Previously, they had thought that Huang Xiaolong was merely messing about in the Heavenly World. They had never expected the little troublemaker to barge into Tian Chen’s personal cultivation grounds and slay more than half of his personal guards!

When Huang Xiaolong had killed the members of the Dark Curses Sect, it was considered a mere scuffle. Even the matter with Di Jing could be overlooked if they wanted to. The Heavenly World wouldn’t immediately declare war on Huang Xiaolong based on the small transgressions he made. However, barging into Tian Chen’s cultivation grounds and killing hundreds of thousands of guards was no small matter!

They could no longer turn a blind eye to Huang Xiaolong’s actions!

He was blatantly disrespecting the Heavenly World, and Huang Xiaolong was basically declaring war with them at this point.

The next day was Tian Chen’s wedding ceremony, and if news got out that no one punished the person who killed his way into Tian Chen’s cultivation palace, he would turn into a laughing stock!

“Everyone, please head over with me!” A frosty light flashed in Tian Chen’s eyes as killing intent spilled out of his body. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that no one can suppress you if my older brother isn’t around?”

In their eyes, Huang Xiaolong was a death-seeker!

“Huang Xiaolong is too arrogant! I shall head over with Lord Tian Chen to punish him!” The Dark Curses Old Ancestor was the first to acknowledge.

Everyone soon agreed.

Of course, Wan Shi wouldn’t sit still with Huang Xiaolong was running around rampantly.

More than ten overlords charged out of the main palace towards Tian Chen’s cultivation grounds in the blink of an eye. Tian Chen and Wan Shi took the lead as the old ancestors of the various factions followed behind them. After the old experts gathered their underlings, several dozen thousand people flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

Without hiding their aura, they alarmed almost all the experts who came to the Heavenly World.

“Huang Xiaolong and the others seemed to have barged into Lord Tian Chen’s palace! They killed several hundred thousand guards on their way there!”

“What?!”

Several old ancestors jumped in fright when they heard what Huang Xiaolong did in the Heavenly World.

No one had expected Huang Xiaolong to act so presumptuously.

The wedding ceremony between Tian Chen and Wan Xiaorong would be carried out the next day. Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong slapping them across the face by raiding Tian Chen’s palace?!

“It seems like Lord Tian Chen, Lord Wan Shi, and the others are ready to wage war on Huang Xiaolong...”

“You don’t even need to mention Lord Tian Chen! No one would be able to take that lying down! Quick! Let’s go and observe the battle!”

A wave of people soon followed behind the group of overlords.

In one of the magnificent palaces close to the Heavenly Master’s divine palace, a beauty capable of devastating worlds with her looks sat in the main hall.

The woman was precisely Wan Xiaorong!

She was acknowledged as the top beauty in the myriad of worlds, but good looks were not the only thing she had. Her strength was equally as frightening. Wan Yue had once revealed to a group of overlords that even someone like him wouldn’t be able to take on a single blow from her.

He might have exaggerated a little, but it was enough to show that Wan Xiaorong wasn’t weak.

Despite the rumors going around about the strength, no one had ever seen her true strength. Not even people like the Ancient Heavenly Emperor or the King of Darkness knew how strong she really was.

“What happened out there?” When she heard the commotion outside her palace, she couldn’t help but frown.

A female servant by her side quickly investigated everything that had happened in the past few hours and reported everything to her. “Reporting to Mistress, Huang Xiaolong, Old Ancestor Azure Cow, the King of Darkness and the rest barged into Lord Tian Chen’s palace and killed more than a hundred thousand of his personal guards!”

What?!

Wan Xiaorong widened her eyes in shock.

“Mistress, you do not need to worry. Lord Wan Shi, Lord Tian Chen, and the others have already led a huge group of experts over. With Lord Wan Shi and Lord Tian Chen joining hands, even if Huang Xiaolong has the ability to turn over the heavens, he wouldn’t stand a chance!”

Wan Xiaorong got to her feet as an uneasy feeling bloomed in her heart.

“Ready the carriages. I’m going to meet Senior Heavenly Master!” Wan Xiaorong muttered under her breath.

The female servant stared at Wan Xiaorong in shock when she heard what she said. “Mistress, is there really a need to look for Senior Heavenly Master? Didn’t he say that unless the Heavenly World was about to face destruction, no one could disturb him during his time in secluded cultivation?”

“Do as I say!” Wan Xiaorong snapped at the servant.

“Yes, Mistress!”

In the space above Tian Chen’s palace, Huang Xiaolong and the others killed their way through the endless armies and finally arrived at the palace entrance.

“Indestructible Palace.”

There were two words carved in ancient text into the plaque above the entrance of the palace. There was an air of tyranny surrounding them, and it seemed as though everything in the mundane world was beneath it.

The little cow snorted, “Tian Chen is pretty arrogant...”

He dared to call himself indestructible when even existences who surpassed the Sovereign Realm wouldn’t dare to do so.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care a single bit as he smashed the entrance open with a single palm strike.

According to the other lightning pools’ feedback, the lightning pool was located deep within the palace.

After destroying all the restrictions around them, Huang Xiaolong and the others stepped into the Indestructible Palace.

Huang Xiaolong knew that Tian Chen would have already received news of his palace being broken into. As such, he had to retrieve the lightning pool before Tian Chen came killing his way back.

He didn’t pause for a single second as he charged towards the lightning pool hidden deep inside the palace. There wasn’t a single restriction that could slow him down in the slightest.

Since the restrictions inside the palace were set by Tian Chen, the little cow, the King of Grandmist, and the others could break them if they worked together. Of course, in front of Huang Xiaolong, all the restrictions were thinner than paper.

Destroying more than a hundred restrictions along the way, Huang Xiaolong and the others finally arrived at the entrance of a treasury.

“Nice! He actually made this using Heaven Dao Divine Stone!” The little cow cried out in shock when she saw the entrance of the treasury.

The entrance itself was carved out from a solid piece of Heaven Dao Divine Stone! One had to know that even a single piece of it was a priceless treasure. Heavenly Prince Di Jing had only managed to enter the Emperor Realm when he had obtained a tiny piece of it in the past! Looking at the entrance before them, it was at least several dozen meters tall and several meters wide!

Even people like the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others couldn’t help but stare at the entrance in shock.

“Xiaolong, bring the door away with us!” A fire burned bright in the little cow’s eyes as she swallowed a mouthful of saliva. It was as though the entrance of the treasury before her was a rank-four origin treasure, and she couldn’t wait to grab it!

When Huang Xiaolong saw the eager look on the little cow’s face, he laughed and nodded his head. With a single punch, he destroyed the restrictions on the entrance and pulled the entrance out from the ground. Tossing it towards the little cow, he continued his advance.

Before long, all of them entered Tian Chen’s treasury.

The moment they laid eyes on the treasures stored inside, they felt a bomb going off in their heads.
