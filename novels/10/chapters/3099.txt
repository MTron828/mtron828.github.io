Chapter 3100: Don’t Let Wangu Xu Wait

Hearing Lei Yu’s laughter, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable and the others couldn’t help but chuckle. Even the Myriad Formation Devil revealed a rarely-seen smirk.

“Let’s go. It’s not good to make Wangu Xu wait.” Huang Xiaolong turned and spoke to them.

“Yes, Your Highness.” The Myriad Formation Devil and the others replied respectfully.

With all of them trailing behind him, Huang Xiaolong tore through the skies.

Even though they had left, Wangu Qinger was still suppressed by Lei Yu’s strength and she remained kneeling where she was.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others finally disappeared, Xu Minghua finally stepped forward to destroy the suppressive energy Lei Yu placed on her. However, she snapped at him the moment he got close. “There’s no need to trouble Senior Brother Xu! Get away from me!”

Xu Minghua couldn’t help but sigh resentfully. He knew that she was angry at him for not standing up to Huang Xiaolong.

“Junior Sister Qinger, I was…” He tried to explain himself, but he was interrupted mid way.

“There’s no need for you to explain yourself.” Wangu Qinger yelled before roaring at the experts of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch. “Useless slaves, get over here and save me!”

As they swarmed over and tried everything they could to shatter the suppressive energy placed by Lei Yu, they realized that they couldn’t do a thing to it.

When random experts traveled across the area, they couldn’t help but gasp in shock when they saw Wangu Qinger kneeling in the middle of nowhere.

“Isn’t that Princess Wangu Qinger from the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch? Why is she kneeling there?”

“It’s Huang Xiaolong’s doing! Wangu Qinger ordered her men to kill Huang Xiaolong and his subordinates, and the three headed beast Huang Xiaolong rode on made a move to suppress her!”

“Are you talking about the person who killed Xie Li and Zhu Jingchen in the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce?”

“Who else?!”

“Huang Xiaolong is really daring. How dare he move against Wangu Qinger in the Limitless Sacred Land? Is he tired of living?! If Wangu Xu learns about this, he’ll dig out Huang Xiaolong’s heart and stamp on it till the end of time!”

“Huang Xiaolong is really as crazy as the rumors made him out to be. He isn’t afraid of offending anyone! He killed Xie Li of the Tyrant Beast Creed and Zhu Jingchen of the Mysterious Sparrow Creed, injured Jiang Meng of the World Master’s Manor, and he even dared to touch Wangu Qinger! If he manages to live after offending so many people, the sun will rise from the west!”

Discussions about the matter flew about.

The matter concerning Wangu Qinger seemed to have stabbed a wound deep in the hearts of many experts.

It was no wonder they would think so. Everyone knew that Wangu Qinger was Wangu Xu’s precious daughter. He was extremely protective of her, and he would go to great lengths to ensure that she was satisfied. Now that Huang Xiaolong humiliated her in public, Wangu Xu wouldn’t let him off easily!

When Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu were heading towards the Limitless City, Wangu Xu had already received reports of everything that happened. The moment he read the reports, killing intent spilled over from his eyes and he roared, “Huang Xiaolong, you motherf*cker! How dare you do this to my baby daughter?!”

Everyone in the Mystical Pavilions’ Branch felt the killing intent rolling off him and they didn’t dare to breathe loudly. They fell to their knees instantly.

“What’s going on?” A shadow made from flames appeared beside Wangu Xu.

“Lord San Song.” Wangu Xu finally calmed down when he saw the figure. He looked at the shadow and growled, “Huang Xiaolong went too far!”

When the shadow read the reports, he fell silent for a moment. “When I obtain the Pure Soil from Huang Xiaolong, you can do whatever you want to him! However, you cannot do anything before this! The Pure Soil is extremely important to the Pavilion Master, and we cannot afford to mess things up for him!”

“Yes, Lord San Song! Rest assured I will do everything I can to make this plan work!” Wangu Xu felt a chill running down his spine when he heard what San Song said.

“Good.”

“Get some men to save Qinger.” Lord San Song’s shadow disappeared after he spoke.

After an hour passed, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu finally arrived in the city. When they arrived, their exchange with Wangu Qinger had already spread through the lands.

“He’s Huang Xiaolong! Huang Xiaolong is here!” Someone yelled the moment they caught sight of him.

Many people fought to catch a glimpse of the monster that was Huang Xiaolong, and they wanted to see if he was really as fearless as they had thought.

“What do you think of his strength? The Wind Cloud Dao Venerable and the others follow him willingly, and he shouldn’t be too weak if he can command them! It’s too bad no one has ever seen him fight…” A hall master of the Devil Shadow Creed muttered softly.

“Humph. They might be his subordinates because of the power backing him. Whatever the case, I want to know which power has the ability to subdue experts at the level of the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable and Lei Yu…” A vice hall master of the Ghost Sea Creed sighed.

The Devil Shadow Creed and the Ghost Sea Creed were ranked eighth and seventh in the Origin Heavenly Cave respectively.

As the Origin Heavenly Cave was the strongest region in the Origin Holy World, the seventh and eighth ranked factions there were fairly strong even when ranked against the entire world. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The patriarchs of their creeds would usually possess the power of a region master if they wanted to reach the top ten ranks. As the ranked fourteenth dao convergence, the Tyrant Beast Creed has more than one thousand five hundred and ninety three Dao Venerable Realm experts. As powers that rank in the top ten, the Devil Shadow Creed and the Ghost Sea Creed were no doubt a lot stronger than the Tyrant Beast Creed!

Five to six superpowers had arrived in the Limitless Sacred Land to watch the exchange between Huang Xiaolong and the Mystical Pavilion. All of them were there to pick up the scraps of the battle, and Huang Xiaolong had tons of other treasures other than the Pure Soil! The dao coins he had were enough to tempt them all into action.

Even if all of them obtained a portion of the dao coins he had, it would be enough. They would be satisfied even if they managed to obtain one hundredth of the ten trillion dao coins Huang Xiaolong threw out casually.

“Huang Xiaolong should be extremely strong. At the very least, he should be as strong as the Origin Prince, Xiao Yuncheng!” An expert of the Nine Dragon Creed sighed.

The Nine Dragon Creed was the third ranked power in the Origin Heavenly Cave, and it was stronger than the Devil Shadow Creed and the Ghost Sea Creed combined!

“That might not be the case! His Highness, Xiao Yuncheng, cultivated for less than a million years and comprehended the power of absolute wind, earth, and blaze! He’s a genius among geniuses! How can Huang Xiaolong even begin to compare to him?! If he’s really so talented, why haven’t we heard of him?”

Many experts nearly came to blows as they quarreled among each other.

They might have transmitted their voices to each other without allowing the outside world to learn of their conversation, but they failed to hide anything from Huang Xiaolong. Of course, Huang Xiaolong paid them no heed as he headed straight for the Mystical Pavilion’s branch in the heart of the city.

Not too long after they arrived, a huge group of experts rushed towards them. The person in the lead was Wangu Xu and he emitted a boundless aura that suffocated those around him.

“It’s Branch Pavilion Master Wangu Xu! Huang Xiaolong forced his daughter to kneel in the mountain ranges outside the city, and Branch Pavilion Master Wangu Xu is here to make him pay!”

“As a monster ranked eleventh on the Extermination List, he’ll be a fool if he decides not to do anything to Huang Xiaolong!”
