Chapter 3530: Could It Be?

The next day, Huang Xiaolong and the others left the mountain range under the respectful gazes of the members of the Fantasy Butterfly Race.

Of course, they laid down several supreme formations to protect the race, and Wang Meiqi left behind a huge amount of resources.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After they left, Huang Xiaolong and the others decided to stop by the Dark Shadow Race. After all, Wang Meiqi gave them a deadline earlier, and they didn’t seem to care about her threats.

It took half an hour for them to deal with the Dark Shadow Race.

After they were done, they continued on their way like nothing ever happened.

Huang Xiaolong steered the Purple Lightning Peak as they traveled towards the Tricking Scarlet Celestial Empire.

As Huang Xiaolong had refined the Purple Lightning Peak time and time again, its speed had reached a terrifying level. It tore through the void of the Trickling Scarlet World, and not even experts at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm would be able to catch a glimpse of it.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong felt that it was too slow.

The Sun Moon Furnace and the Purple Lightning Peak might have reached the level of a creation artifact, but they were low-grade creation artifacts at best.

“I wonder if the Eternal Heaven Alliance would be able to supply me with treasures to strengthen my artifacts…” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

The Eternal Heaven Treasury had countless treasures gathered over the years. God of Creation Realm experts of the alliance would be able to trade with treasures of equivalent worth, and their collection would only grow larger.

Half a month passed, and Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the Trickling Scarlet World.

However, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t discover any traces of Chi Qin no matter how hard he tried. The other three also released their dao souls, but failed to discover a thing.

“Looks like he isn't here.” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“We’ll know after we ask his son,” Ao Guang muttered.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slightly.

In that instant, the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor was in the main hall with a group of old ancestors from various creeds. More than a hundred of them were enjoying a banquet, and all of them were experts who had comprehended all thirteen elements to perfection levels. The old ancestor of the Wang Family was also present.

Just as they were reaching the climax of the banquet, a massive blast rang through the skies and a massive claw descended from the heavens. It tore through the restrictions and broke through the formations laid down by Chi Qin.

The Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor was shocked. His father was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, and he had nearly 8 billion units of grand cosmos energy! The grand formation around the palace was laid down after countless efforts, but someone actually managed to tear through it in a single attack!

When the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor was still stuck in a state of shock, the giant claw grabbed him and brought him into the skies.

“Your Majesty!”

Everyone in the hall screamed and they wanted to assist the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor. However, they were struck down before they could do anything.

The person who made the move was Ao Shenghai.

Even though Chi Qin was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, Ao Shenghai was near the peak of the God of Creation Realm. It was easy for him to shatter the formation around the palace.

Soon, the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor was dragged before Huang Xiaolong.

The Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor, Chi Tianyang, stared at the four people standing around in shock.

“Relax. We didn’t come here to mess with you. His Highness wants to look for Chi Qin, and we need to ask you where your father is,” Ao Shenghai spoke.

When Chi Tianyang heard what Ao Shenghai said, question marks popped up in his mind once again. He didn’t expect all of them would make such huge waves in order to find his father.

He even thought that he was going to die when the claw dragged him into the skies.

All of a sudden, the experts sitting in the hall charged into the skies.

“Stop right there! Stay back!” Chi Tianyang roared hastily when he saw them rushing out ready to fight.

After he sent them away, he bowed respectfully to Huang Xiaolong and the others. He asked cautiously, “I wonder why you’re looking for my father… Is there something wrong?”

“We wish to enter the Eternal Heaven Alliance! We want your father to recommend us.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t hide his intentions.

When Chi Tianyang heard what he said, he gasped in fright.

Four Gods of Creation were planning to join the Eternal Heaven Alliance!

That was something that could shake up the entire First Universe!

Even though he had no idea how strong the other three were, he knew that Ao Shenghai was definitely an existence stronger than his father.

Since Ao Shenghai addressed Huang Xiaolong as ‘His Highness’, it was clear their identities weren’t simple.

“Lords, are you really planning to join the Eternal Heaven Alliance?” Chi Tianyang stuttered after some time.

“This isn’t something you’re qualified to ask,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

With his heart leaping in fright, Chi Tianyang replied hastily, “Yes, yes, yes, I was rash. I didn’t mean to show any disrespect.”

In the distance, the experts who came to the palace saw Chi Tianyang bowing and scraping before the four, and they were shocked. After all, Huang Xiaolong didn’t block off his surroundings. Everyone heard what he said.

Everyone thought back to the time when Chi Tianyang was grabbed by the mysterious power. They didn’t notice anything as they were far too weak! When they thought about what had happened, they felt a chill running down their backs. It was as though they took a trip to the netherworld and returned unharmed.

“I wonder who Lord Creations are…” Chi Tianyang asked, but he started to explain himself in the next instant, “I don’t mean to disrespect you, and I only wish to learn of your identities.”

After all, he needed to know who they were before he could make the report to his father.

“I’m the Ancestor of the Fantasy Butterfly Race in the Six Dao Holy World.” Wang Meiqi continued, “Your father will eventually learn of their identities.”

When those standing around heard Wang Meiqi’s revelation, they weren’t too shocked. However, the old ancestor of the Wang Family felt a bolt of lightning running through his body.

What?! She is the Lord Ancestor my descendants told me about!

He received the reports from the higher-ups of the Wang Family a long time ago. He wanted to exterminate the Fantasy Butterfly Race when he returned from the banquet. However, beads of cold sweat started dripping from his forehead.

“Brother Wang Jing, are you alright?” someone noticed Wang Jing’s abnormal reaction, and he asked.

“I… I’m fine.” Wang Jing shook his head hastily.

Chi Tianyang was surprised to learn of her identity. He vaguely remembered the Fantasy Butterfly Race, and he knew that they were one of the oldest races in the Trickling Scarlet World. However, they seemed to have fallen.

Soon, he contacted Chi Qin and made a report about Huang Xiaolong and the others.

When Chi Qin, who was discussing some matters with Jin Shenglin, another God of Creation at the grand completion stage, received the report, he jumped in fright.

“Brother Chi Qin, this…” Jin Shenglin asked.

He handed the report over to Jin Shenglin and heard a gasp. “Four… Four Gods of Creation wish to join our Eternal Heaven Alliance?! One of them is even stronger than you!”

“Ancestor of the Fantasy Butterfly Race?!” Jin Shenglin suddenly thought of something and an excited expression formed on his face. “Could it be?! She’s still alive!”
