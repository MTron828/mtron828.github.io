Chapter 3737: Origin Universe

 

Huang Xiaolong drove the ship between the balls of energy but countless days later, there was no change in his surroundings.

The energy balls formed dense clouds in the space and Huang Xiaolong traveled onwards carefully.

Huang Xiaolong was the only person traveling through the vast space as several years passed in the blink of an eye.

If not for there being more clouds of energy, Huang Xiaolong would have long since turned around.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After dozens of years, he saw the end.

Blinding rays of light came from the region outside the energy sea, and Huang Xiaolong steered his ship carefully into the distance.

He was shocked to discover that the light was so dense that it formed a giant curtain that hovered in the space before him.

The light curtain was endless, and it seemed to separate the space between them completely.

Huang Xiaolong had no idea how large the curtain of light was, but he had a strong suspicion that he would be able to arrive at the Universe Origin after crossing the curtain of light!

Calming himself down, Huang Xiaolong charged straight through the curtain of light.

The moment he entered, a massive blast could be heard. The light curtain seemed to drape over the Universe Boat as the entire structure trembled.

Rays of light covered the ship as Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock.

The Universe Boat was extremely sturdy. Even if experts whose combat strength crossed the 20 billion mark gave it their all, they wouldn’t be able to shake the ship in the slightest. Now, the Universe Boat was rocking like a tiny boat in the ocean.

That alone proved how terrifying the light curtain was.

Retrieving a top-grade universe-level spiritual vein, Huang Xiaolong supplied the grand formation with endless energy. Only then did the shaking stop.

Huang Xiaolong continued onwards carefully.

The further he got, the stronger the light became. Now, his pace was slowed to the speed of a crawl.

Several dozen years passed once again. Finally, Huang Xiaolong crossed the barrier of light.

The moment he did, Huang Xiaolong gasped in fright. He entered another universe and signs of life were everywhere to be seen. It was as though he entered the Thirteen Universes once again.

Even so, he was extremely sure that the place before him wasn’t the Thirteen Universes he came from!

The spiritual energy was even purer than that in the Thirteen Universes, and there was a special type of power contained in the air.

The laws of the universe were much stronger there than in the Thirteen Universes!

“Is this the Universe Origin?!”

He finally arrived!

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Even after taking so much time, he arrived!

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong suppressed his excitement and continued onwards.

Several days later, he saw a spatial black hole sitting in the middle of space.

Without a second though, he entered the black hole.

When he arrived on the other side, he was greeted with a scenery greater than that in the Universe Vault.

Taking a deep breath, Huang Xiaolong felt extremely comfortable. He continued on his way onwards.

Soon, he arrived before a giant primitive forest.

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls and even though he couldn’t cover the entire area, he knew that it was larger than whatever forest he found in the Thirteen Universes.

There were ferocious beasts at the God of Creation Realm within.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure started to blur as he appeared above the beast he discovered. With a swing of his arm, he pulled the beast over and invaded its soul with his own. He could feel an extremely pure energy in its body. It was a combination of grandmist energy and universe source qi.

The beast’s physical body was different from that of the creatures in the Thirteen Universes. The beast was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, and it barely broke through. However, its body was stronger than experts who had 15 billion units of combat strength back in the Thirteen Universes. 

The runes that lined its body contained exquisite grand dao laws.

The beast stared at Huang Xiaolong in fear and yelled, “Senior, please spare my life!” 

“Relax. I won’t do anything to you.” Huang Xiaolong chucked and branded its soul.

As he came alone, he needed to find a suitable mount after entering the Universe Origin.

After controlling the beast, he looked through its memories.

Huang Xiaolong learned that the beast and everyone who lived there called the place the Origin Universe!

Creatures there were called Origin Beasts, and there were countless ancient races. Other than Humans, there were many different life forms. The Origin Universe was larger than any of the thirteen universes.

Even though the creature was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, it had no idea how large the Origin Universe Was. It only knew that one person had ever entered the Universe Origin.

What shocked Huang Xiaolong was the fact that the beast knew the way to enter the Universe God Realm!

A massive palace would appear in a place called the Golden Valley and there was a mirror situated within. It contained the highest of laws in the Origin Universe, and legends had it that anyone who could comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror would be able to enter the Universe God Realm.

From what it seemed, the palace would appear again in several hundred thousand years!

“Is the place called the Devil Mirror Palace?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

Was it possible for the mirror in the palace to be similar to the one he obtained back in the Unknown Space? When Huang Xiaolong thought about the secrets contained in the Nameless Devil Mirror he realized that it was eerily similar to the mirror described in the beast’s memory!
