The Brightness Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, and others were glaring at Huang Xiaolong with intense hatred.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was tepid as he replied, “I only counted the two hundred and forty-five Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples that I killed. I can’t say for the other palaces if your disciples were among them.”

Killed two hundred and forty-five Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples!

Gasps of shock sounded through the crowd.

Simply ruthless.

The Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Wenqian, Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong, and the rest of Brightness Emperor Palace’s group were spewing fire from their eyes. They looked as if they would roast Huang Xiaolong there and then, and gnaw on his flesh and blood.

“Huang Xiaolong, you dog—!” Chen Wenqian bellowed, and his killing intent soared to the sky.

"Oh right, I remember now," Huang Xiaolong suddenly remarked. "One time, there was a Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple shouting that he was the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Weiqian’s disciple, but I don’t know if it was true..."

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, the killing intent in Chen Wenqian’s eyes turned violent, and he roared, “You’re saying that despite knowing he was my disciple, you killed him?”

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he questioned in return, “So what if he was your disciple?”

“You—! Why?!” Chen Wenqian glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Chen Wenqian like he was looking at a retard. “Fine, if you need a reason, I’ll give you one. The sight of Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples displeased my eyes. Moreover, didn’t the Brightness Emperor Palace instigate idiotic Yu Shi to force us out of Manor No. 61? Of course, other than those reasons, your disciple and two other Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples, as well as two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples, were besieging Peng Xiao for the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s one million low-grade chaos spirit stones bounty.”

Everyone was stunned.

Was Huang Xiaolong telling them that he had killed those two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples too?!

“You killed two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples?!” Chen Wenqian asked with uncertainty and disbelief. He watched Huang Xiaolong’s face to see if there were any signs of lying.

The participants from the Grandmist Emperor Palace were all core disciples, and the majority of them were either Grand Elders or Hall Masters, and even Ancestors’ personal disciples.

Even the Heavenly Court’s princes wouldn’t disclose that they had dared to kill the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s participating disciples.

It was no exaggeration to say that, no matter their identity, people wouldn’t dare to kill a Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciple. It was equivalent to piercing a hole through the sky.

The Grandmist Emperor Palace’s group that was about to leave stopped abruptly and turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. Obviously, they had heard what Huang Xiaolong had said.

Leading the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s group to the Battle of the Heavenly Court was Han Qing, Zhang Renjie, and eight Ancestors.

When Han Qing and others looked over, Huang Xiaolong went on matter-of-factly, “That’s right, I killed those two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples named Chen Ming and Zhao Xiaodan.”

The gaze on Huang Xiaolong became slightly strange.

Suddenly, an overpowering momentum surged forth. A figure blurred, and in the next second, Han Qing stood right in front of Huang Xiaolong. Her gaze was as icy as her voice, “So, my Grandmist Emperor Palace’s two fallen disciples were killed by you!”

“Huang Xiaolong, you have really got big guts. Do you really think just because our Emperor once met with you, you can be lawless and do as you like?!”

“Do you think you can pull our Grandmist Emperor’s banner and do whatever you want? The Heavenly Court has already investigated that you have no relation, whatsoever, with our Grandmist Emperor!”

Killing intent erupted in Han Qing’s eyes.

Since the Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong had ordered Wu Tianhe’s cultivation to be abolished and expelled out of the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Han Qing had deeply resented Huang Xiaolong because Wu Tianhe was a junior of her family clan.

But Huang Xiaolong didn’t even give Han Qing one look. Instead, he turned to Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao, saying, “Let’s go.” With that, he raised his foot and prepared to walk away.

“Stop right there!”

“Stop!!”

Since Huang Xiaolong continued to ignore her, Han Qing barked, and her body trembled in a fury.

The Brightness Emperor Palace’s Chen Wenqian, Lan Tailong, the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Feng Chan, Liu Yuan, and the rest shouted in unison with Han Qing for Huang Xiaolong to stop.

At the same time, Han Qing’s body flickered forward, blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path.

“Huang Xiaolong, you killed disciples of my Grandmist Emperor Palace, and you want to run just like that? Don’t think just because you got first place in the preliminary round, you can...!” Han Qing’s cold and resentful eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

“Get lost!” Huang Xiaolong cut off Han Qing’s words. “Earlier, I didn’t tell you off, out of respect for your Grandmist Emperor, but if you continue to entangle with me like a mad dog, then you will die!”

Everyone was stupefied listening to Huang Xiaolong equate Han Qing to a mad dog.

Han Qing was also stupefied. She was flushing with anger, a moment later, when she reacted. As an Eighth Order Emperor Realm expert, she had always been held in high status, even among the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Ancestors. Everyone envied her wherever she went, but now, she was called a mad dog by Huang Xiaolong, who was a mere Heavenly Monarch Realm ant!

“Huang Xiaolong, go die for me!” Han Qing screamed sharply. She could no longer suppress the roiling, killing intent in her heart as her fingers clawed at Huang Xiaolong.

Azure-colored streams of energy flowed violently, and ice shards shot everywhere, spreading out frigid cold qi. The surrounding people felt as if they had fallen into a blizzard purgatory.

“This is the Chaos Era’s Nether Niflheim Emperor Palace’s supreme technique Azure Nether Niflheim Claw!” Some of the spectating Ancestors exclaimed.

Although the Nether Niflheim Emperor Palace had long perished, the Nether Niflheim Emperor Palace’s reputation, during the Chaos Era, was comparable to the current Grandmist Emperor Palace. A large part of their reputation was built on the Azure Nether Niflheim Claw.

According to old rumors, when one reached the significant completion in the Azure Nether Niflheim Claw, that cultivator could turn an entire world surface into a world of ice, and every living being inside would turn into azure ice sculptures.

Moreover, not even the famous divine fires of the Desolate Era could melt this ice.

Before the Azure Nether Niflheim Claw reached Huang Xiaolong, the air around him froze into fine layers of azure-colored ice.

Exactly at this time, a vigorous power enveloped the entire plaza as a low growl rumbled in everyone’s ears. A shadow flickered, and Han Qing’s body tumbled through the air like a broken kite, crashing on the other end of the plaza. The entire plaza quaked for several seconds.

The attacker was naturally one of the two odd beasts.

After slapping Han Qing away, the figure flickered back to its position behind Huang Xiaolong. Its movements were so fast that the others were yet to react.

The fine layers of azure ice around Huang Xiaolong shattered, and he walked out as if nothing had happened.

“Ancestor Han Qing!”

The Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Zhang Renjie and the others paled. Some of them hastened to Han Qing’s side. Han Qing was coughing out large mouthfuls of greenish golden blood.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong led Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, and the others away.

The Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Wenqian and Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Liu Yuan secretly shook their heads at Lan Tailong and Feng Chan.

Huang Xiaolong indifferently walked past Han Qing.

“Huang Xiaolong, kill me if you dare to!” Suddenly, Han Qing screeched like a madwoman with a distorted face. “Or when you fall into my hands in the future, I’ll make you wish you were dead instead!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Just as Han Qing finished speaking, one of the odd beasts’ palm slapped down on her. The plaza shook again, and a deep human-shaped pit appeared.

The people around sucked in a breath of cold air in shock.

The plaza was built sturdy and had been strengthened many times through the years with numerous array formations. Even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert would find it difficult to leave a palm imprint on it.

This!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the half-dead Han Qing and stated in a tepid tone, “Unfortunately, you won’t have the chance.”

In that palm strike, the odd beast had already abolished her cultivation.

Huang Xiaolong walked away without another word.
