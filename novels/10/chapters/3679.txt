Chapter 3680 – Hidden Hell

Yin Ping was huddled close to the other three and their faces were deathly pale. Despair flashed in their eyes when they saw the never ending wave of ferocious ghosts.

“Yin Ping, are we really going to turn into food for these creatures?!” The young lady of the Ying Family cried. “I don’t want to die! Please!”

“No! We won’t die!” Yin Ping suppressed the fear in her heart. “My father definitely knows that we have entered the Netherworld. They will come in here to save us!”

Looking at the endless tide of ferocious ghosts, she started to doubt her own words. Was her father really able to save them?

Even if he managed to charge his way in, they might already have been eaten by the ferocious ghosts!

When she thought about the gruesome fate that awaited them, goosebumps formed all over her body.

Their twelve companions who had died in the hands of the ferocious ghosts were torn to shreds before being swallowed by the vile creatures. She could still hear their wretched cries in her ears.

If not for the fact that the four of them had a protection talisman from their respective fathers, they would have died a long time ago. Of course, at the rate they were going, they wouldn’t be able to hold out for much longer.

When the protection barrier around them started to fade, a ball of golden light entered their vision.

The golden light started to approach them at a frightening speed and wherever it went, the ferocious ghosts would be turned to dust!

They noticed a figure shrouded in the golden light as he approached.

It was a handsome young man covered in golden light, and they couldn’t even begin to describe how handsome he was!

Every action he made contained some sort of charm that caused their hearts to throb.

“Is he… Is he here to save us?” The young lady of the Ying Family asked with her voice slightly trembling.

Save…

Yin Ping suppressed the shock in her hearts and a look of joy appeared on her face. “Yeah! He has to be! My father definitely sent him here to save us! We’re finally saved!”

The three other young ladies felt relief sweeping through their hearts. They saw hope at the end of the tunnel.

Huang Xiaolong heard whatever they said even though he was extremely far away, and after taking a single step, he arrived beside them.

“Did my father send you in here to save us?” Yin Ping asked.

“Are you Yin Ping?” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother answering the question and asked one of his own instead.

“Yes, that’s me!” Yin Ping cried.

The young lady of the Ying Family yelled at the side, “Me too! I’m the young lady of the Ying Family. Please save us!”

The two other ladies spoke hastily, pleading with Huang Xiaolong to save them.

At that point, they were completely terrified of the ferocious ghosts. They didn’t wish to remain in the Netherworld for a single second more.

“Relax. I’ll get you out.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “Follow me.”

As soon as he spoke, the barrier of light around him expanded several times. It surrounded the four ladies and he brought them towards the exit.

Wrapped up in the ball of golden light, the four ladies felt a warm current flowing through their bodies. They also saw the ferocious ghosts who entered the radius of the light crumbling to dust!

Heaving a sigh of relief, they knew that they were finally saved.

As they followed closely behind him, the four ladies tried to suppress the shock in their hearts.

“Lord, are you an expert whose combat strength crossed the 10 billion units mark?” One of the ladies asked in a daze.

“Yeah.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Seeing the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, the lady felt her heart thumping in her chest.

As the four of them were located on the first level of the Netherworld, it wouldn’t take long for them to return.

When they saw the exit, joy filled their hearts.

“I’ll send you out now. Yin Qi is waiting outside.” Huang Xiaolong said when they were about to arrive.

Yin Ping gasped in fright, “Lord, are you not leaving with us?”

“No. I’ll have to enter the Hidden Hell.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and explained.

“The Hidden Hell?!” The expressions on the faces of the four ladies changed instantly.

The Hidden Hell was what they called the lowest of the eighteen levels of hell. It was the most terrifying region in the Unknown Lands!

When they were still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and the ball of golden light that contained the four ladies flew towards the exit.

As anxiousness filled Yin Qi and Yin Guan’s hearts, they saw a streak of light shooting towards them after it pierced through the seal laid down by Huang Xiaolong. They were extremely relieved when they saw Yin Ping and the others.

“Yin Ping!” Yin Qi yelled when he noticed his daughter.

“Father!”

Yin Guan appeared at the side and asked, “Young Lady, where is the senior who went in to save you?”

Staring at Yin Guan in confusion, she eventually connected the dots and realized that he was asking about Huang Xiaolong. Pausing for a second, she muttered, “He said… He said that he’s headed for the Hidden Hell.”

“What?!” The experts in her surroundings jumped in fright.

“Is he tired of living?! Why would he head towards the Hidden Hell now?” One of the ancestors of a great clan in the Green Ghost Lands sighed at the side.

“Not even Lord Gui Chi would dare to enter the Hidden Hell at this time… There are so many ferocious ghosts on the loose right now! The Hidden Hell should be experiencing some sort of disaster!” Someone else quipped.

The two of them were experts whose combat strength had broken through the 10 billion units mark.

“I wonder which region this supreme expert called Huang Xiaolong came from. I don’t think our Unknown Lands contain a Huang Family…”

“Well, I wonder what he wishes to do in the Hidden Hell!”

The experts of the various families started discussing among themselves.

Complicated expressions could be seen on the faces of the four ladies.

…

When that was happening, Huang Xiaolong was rushing towards the entrance to the second level of the Netherworld. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After he saved the four ladies, there was no need to waste any more time on the first level. He increased his speed and charged towards the entrance of the second level, and even at his current speed, it would take him nearly a month to get there. Each level in the Netherworld was too damn big!

Getting annoyed with the distance, Huang Xiaolong eventually brought out the Universe Boat. With its speed, he took several days to arrive at the entrance of the second level.

He did the same for the rest of the levels…

Two months later, he finally arrived at the eighteenth level of the Netherworld, the Hidden Hell!

Huang Xiaolong saw ferocious ghosts pouring towards the seventeenth layer where he came from, but his gaze landed on the eye of the formation laid down by the Green Ghost god knew how many years ago.

“Looks like something really happened to the eye of the formation…” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he muttered to himself.
