Chapter 3429: Appearance of the Pangu Axe

Now that the ancient weapon was about to appear, the various experts of the strongest factions moved out en masse in order to seal off the area.

There were more than three hundred high-level Void Immortal Realm experts among them!

Counting the grand elders and elders, there were more than ten thousand of them present.

Ten thousand experts in the Grand Completion Realm and above was a terrifying power!

If they joined forces, they would be able to level the entire region if they wished!

As the Kunlun Emperor emerged from the crowd, his robes fluttered in the wind. He glared at Huang Xiaolong as he roared, “Were you the one who leveled my Kunlun Palace?!”

Huang Xiaolong could feel that the Pangu Axe was about to appear any minute now, and he couldn’t be bothered with them. “If you have something to say, speak up now. Otherwise, I’ll give you one minute to f*ck off.”

The experts of the various superpowers stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Laughing in anger, the Kunlun Emperor sneered, “You’ll give us one minute to f*ck off?!”

“You deserve to die a thousand deaths for insulting His Majesty!” one of the Ninth Level Void Immortals behind the Kunlun Emperor raged. The halberd in his hand shot towards Huang Xiaolong the moment he spoke.

The halberd tore through space and appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Just as they thought that the halberd would blow a hole through Huang Xiaolong, he stretched out a single hand to grab it.

With his hand clamping down on the halberd, the Ninth Level Void Immortal was unable to move it a single inch. Everyone around stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, as a burst of light emerged from his palm. The expert holding the halberd felt a sharp pain shooting through his arm. He could only beat a hasty retreat.

Casually tossing the halberd away, it pierced straight through the man’s chest. It pinned him to the cliff face on the other side as blood dripped from the tip of the weapon.

The expert from the Kunlun Kingdom didn’t die, but no matter how hard he tried, he failed to free himself.

Those standing around looked at him in shock.

That included the Kunlun Emperor and the leaders of the other factions.

The six of them were peak existences in the Kunlun Secret Region, and all of them were at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Void Immortal Realm. They were surprised to see that a Ninth Level Void Immortal was easily dealt with by Huang Xiaolong.

When the Kunlun Emperor thought about what he said to Huang Xiaolong earlier, he felt his heart trembling.

It was as though a knife was stabbed through his heart.

He was enraged when Huang Xiaolong told them to leave earlier, but now, the killing intent in his heart had disappeared.

“You have 30 seconds left,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

30 seconds!

The experts of the other factions looked at each other and their expressions were ugly.

“You’re too overbearing!” The valley master of the Heartless Valley growled, “You might be strong, but you’re alone! We have more than ten thousand experts here, and if we join forces, you won’t be leaving here alive today…”

“Oh. What about it?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the valley master in amusement.

“Our factions discovered the treasure first, and it belongs to us.” The valley master continued. “If you leave right now, we can pretend that you weren’t here.”

“Are you sure you were the ones who discovered the birth of the treasure in the Golden Dragon Mountain Range?” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

One of the factions around the mountain range had discovered the birth of the treasure, but the six super factions arrived to force them away before sealing the mountain range.

The valley master stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, and he didn’t know how to respond.

“30 seconds.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air once again.

The Kunlun Emperor finally stood out from the crowd, and he snapped, “Are you really planning to challenge all of us at once? You’ll regret your actions if you refuse to listen to us.” After he spoke. He released his aura completely. Multi-colored light surrounded his body.

That was the Nine Absolute Immortal Art he trained in.

The Nine Absolute Immortal Art was something created by nine peak-level Void Immortals. When he unleashed it, it would feel as though nine godly beings were attacking at once. It was publicly known as the strongest immortal art in the Kunlun Secret Region!Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The experts of the six factions couldn’t help but stare at the Kunlun Emperor in awe.

His aura continued to climb…

“Time’s up.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in their minds. Just as the Kunlun Emperor showcased his full strength, Huang Xiaolong moved. As his figure blurred, he appeared in front of the Kunlun Emperor before anyone could react. A punch landed on the emperor’s chest, and the armor around his body shattered instantly. As the shard rained down on the land, Huang Xiaolong’s fist exited from the emperor’s back. Like a shooting star, the Kunlun Emperor was sent flying and he slammed heavily into one of the distant mountain ranges. As soon as he landed, the peak crumbled.

Next, the Pangu Sword hovering in the air released countless rays of sword light. As the light rained down on the lands, miserable shrieks could be heard. The experts of the six super factions started falling from the sky like bugs.

Those who could remain standing in the air were dealt with by Huang Xiaolong with a single punch. In the blink of an eye, all ten thousand experts were lying pitifully on the ground.

The experts of the other factions who were chased away by the six super factions looked at them in shock.

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong dealt with the members of the six super factions, the mountain range started to rumble. They felt as though a giant beast was about to emerge from under the earth.

Terrifying rays of light shot into the skies, and the experts of the six factions who were struck by it were vaporized.

Yelling in shock, they tried to escape despite their serious injuries.

The Golden Dragon Mountain Range trembled violently, and the earth started to crack. The snow that built up on the lands for god knows how many years was swallowed by the valleys that formed in the earth.

The pillars of light that stretched into the skies could sunder the heavens. Despite its power, Huang Xiaolong stood in his place as a look of excitement formed on his face. He bathed in the light as though it was a comfortable shower.

When they saw the comfortable look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, they felt their legs going soft.

“Is he… Is he really human?!”

Just a moment ago, there were Ninth Level Void Immortals who were turned into nothingness by the light! However, the powerful beam couldn’t do a thing to Huang Xiaolong!

They could only imagine how strong his physical body was.

As the Golden Dragon Mountain Range slowly crumbled, a giant axe appeared in the skies.
