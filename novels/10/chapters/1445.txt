Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The inner sect disciple froze for a split second, but he soon laughed as he answered Huang Xiaolong, “There is hope but Hall Masters have extremely strict requirements when accepting personal disciples. Even if you manage to enter the top one hundred rankings, you must have at least a top emperor rank godhead to attract the eye of a Hall Master. Brother, you have a strong physique but your godhead rank slightly falls short of that requirement. Then again, if you could make it into the top one hundred rankings with your talent, then there might be a chance you would be accepted by a Grand Elder as personal disciple.”

Huang Xiaolong listened carefully with a calm face. He nodded his head then asked, “What if it’s the top ten?”

The inner sect disciple shook his head as he explained, “Top ten? To enter the top ten, you need at least the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm strength. Let me tell you something, in this batch of disciples, there are over sixty disciples who have peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm strength. On top of that, there are also God King Realm disciples; among them one is an early First Order God King Realm disciple, and another is mid-First Order God King Realm.”

Even though the inner sect disciple did not spell it out, it was clear that he didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong had any hope of entering the top ten rankings.

In his opinion, even though Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique was very powerful, at the most, Huang Xiaolong’s strength could rival a mid-Tenth Order or late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple given the combination of his cultivation realm and True Dragon Physique.

If Huang Xiaolong’s luck was good, perhaps he could enter the top one hundred rankings.

“What’s the two God King Realm disciples’ names? Which branch are they from?” Huang Xiaolong pretended to be shocked as he asked.

The inner sect disciple chuckled, “In truth, these details cannot be revealed at this point, but since it’s Junior Brother Huang who’s asking, I’ll reveal a little bit. One of them came from the Unparalleled branch, a disciple called Liu Qin, and the other one is Fu Feiyu, a disciple from the Eternal Zephyr World surface’s branch.”

Liu Qin, Fu Feiyu. Huang Xiaolong made a mental note of the two names.

“But, Brother, how did you cultivate? You actually advanced to the early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm in less than a thousand years!” The inner sect disciple sighed. “This cultivation speed is comparable to a supreme godhead genius ah!”

The inner sect disciple and Huang Xiaolong chatted as they walked. Through their little chat, Huang Xiaolong learned that the inner sect disciple was called Luo Yun. Luo Yun’s Master was a Fortune Emperor Palace Elder, however, Luo Yun’s Master’s status was not comparable to Elder Bai.

As Luo Yun had seen Huang Xiaolong’s future potential, he had not put on a superior attitude towards him, hence, they were able to chat amiably.

When Luo Yun and Huang Xiaolong were back in the outer hall, it looked as if they were best of friends.

Zhou Wen and the other disciples stopped talking when they saw Huang Xiaolong and the inner sect disciple walking out of the inner hall. Each of them was surprised seeing the amiable atmosphere between the two.

Once they were back in the Supreme Harmony Hall’s outer hall, Luo Yun immediately announced that Huang Xiaolong had passed the assessment. After that he inscribed Huang Xiaolong’s name and branch on the jade token and gave it to Huang Xiaolong as he reminded Huang Xiaolong, “Junior Brother Huang, take good care of this identity jade token. Half a year from now, this identity jade token will be used during the rankings competition.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled slightly and agreed, “Understood.” He received the identity jade token from Luo Yun and put it into his spatial ring for safekeeping. He then stepped away to make room for the purple-haired female disciple behind him.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to step out from the outer hall, loud gasps of astonishment rang behind him.

“What! Supreme rank godhead, she’s actually a supreme godhead genius!”

“Another supreme godhead disciple has appeared in our Fortune Emperor Palace!”

Huang Xiaolong was a little astonished after hearing these exclamations. He turned around and saw the testing stone emitting dazzling lights with the following words on its surface: “Supreme godhead, unknown ranking.”

The person being tested was none other than the purple-haired female disciple who was standing in the line behind Huang Xiaolong.

A light glimmered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he watched her.

Luo Yun, the inner sect disciple in charge of the testing, soon recovered from his astonishment and scrambled off in a hurry to report the matter to Elder Bai. Elder Bai tore the fabric of space and arrived at the outer hall in a fraction of a second; euphoria and excitement were obvious on his face as he looked at the purple-haired female disciple.

Elder Bai went straight to the point this time, “You, follow me to see the Hall Master right now.” With that said, he tore a hole in the void and swept away the purple-haired female disciple from right before everyone’s eyes.

As she was a supreme godhead genius, the latter tests determining cultivation realm and bone-age were no longer important.

Zhou Wen and the others watched enviously. So did Luo Yun.

All of them knew that the purple-haired female disciple would soon alert the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor and Ancestors, and she would be taken as a personal disciple by the Emperor or one of the Ancestors.

What glory it was to become the Emperor or one of the Ancestors’ personal disciple! That was equivalent to ascending to the heavens in a single leap.

“She is Peng Xiao, from the Soaring branch.”

“I’ve already noticed Junior Sister Peng Xiao’s unique bearing, and she’s actually a supreme godhead genius ah. I wonder which lucky man would be Junior Sister Peng Xiao’s companion in the future.”

“What’s Junior Sister Peng Xiao’s identity? To be worthy of her favor, you would need to be a supreme godhead genius as well, so people like us can’t even dream about it.”

The disciples in the outer hall chatted with enthusiasm.

Contrary to the excited disciples in the outer hall, Huang Xiaolong was calm and a bit indifferent as he turned and stepped out through the outer hall entrance.

Since he had passed the initial requirements, all he had to do now was to wait for the rankings competition that was going to take place in six months. For a second his thoughts wandered off, as he wondered about the form that would be used for conducting the rankings competition.

From what he had heard from Luo Yun so far, it didn’t seem to be a stage battle competition, but it was certainly going to be related to the disciples’ strengths.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t gone far from the outer hall when a blurry figure flickered and stopped right in front of Huang Xiaolong, blocking his path.

Huang Xiaolong looked at this person, and it was Zhou Wen.

“Zhou Wen, do you need anything from me?” Huang Xiaolong asked flatly.

Zhou Wen’s gaze became a little sullen as Huang Xiaolong had directly used his name. His smile became sinister as he spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, is that right? Although I don’t know what method you used for passing the testing stone assessment, I will make you understand why flowers are red during the rankings competition.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled calmly and asked, “Do you know why leaves are so green?”

Zhou Wen was stupefied for a split second then his face sank. “What do you want to say?”

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled, he sped off into the sky without another word to Zhou Wen.

Zhou Wen’s hands clenched tightly as he watched Huang Xiaolong leave, and his surrounding temperature fell sharply, but he swiftly converged his emotions, remembering the Fortune Emperor Palace’s rules.

“I will let you jump for a few more months because I am going to beat you up so badly during the rankings competition that you will be crying for your mommy.” Zhou Wen scoffed. He flew off as well. Inwardly, he was confident that he, a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm could teach an early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm Huang Xiaolong a memorable lesson.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong had left the Supreme Harmony Hall, Elder Bai had arrived at an enormous building with the purple-haired female disciple. They met with the Supreme Harmony Hall’s Hall Master Zhang Dong who was responsible for assessments and tasks.

Zhang Dong was extremely happy seeing the purple-haired female disciple Peng Xiao. He asked Peng Xiao questions with a wide smile on his face, and he was an epitome of an affable elder.

Just as Zhang Dong was about to lead Peng Xiao to see their Fortune Emperor Palace’s Sect Chief and the Fortune Emperor, Elder Bai said suddenly, “Hall Master, I have another matter to report. It’s about another disciple called Huang Xiaolong.”

Peng Xiao’s eyes glimmered with expectation as she heard Huang Xiaolong’s name. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh, Huang Xiaolong?” Zhang Dong looked at Elder Bai, waiting to hear Elder Bai’s report.
