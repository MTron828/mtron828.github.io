Chapter 3029: Heaven Seizing Inn

After staying in the Leiyu Creed for another month, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu finally departed for the Mystical Pavilion’s branch in the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave.

It would take more than a month for the auction to commence, and Huang Xiaolong decided to take a nice trip around the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave while he was one the way there.

When Zhou Hong and the others learned that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over to the Mystical Pavilion Branch, they got ready the Lei Yu Flying Ship.

One had to know that the Lei Yu Flying Ship was something Lei Yu personally refined in the past. It was a high-grade cosmos artifact, and he used quite a bit of effort to create it.

However, Lei Yu chuckled lightly at his disciples when he saw the flying ship in the skies. “His Highness’ status wouldn’t allow him to sit in the Lei Yu Flying Ship. You guys can relax. His Highness has his own flying ship.”

Tan Hua looked at the other two and realized they were also looking at him with a strange expression. Was a high-grade cosmos artifact not enough?

Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly and summoned the Purple Lightning Peak.

When they looked at the giant purple mountain hovering in the skies above them, Tan Hua, Sui Hengyi, and Zhou Hong felt their jaws dropping. The mountain was as large as a supercontinent and the shadow covered the entire creed.

“This… This… Is this a peak-grade cosmos artifact level flying ship?!” Tan Hua asked.

Chuckling to themselves, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu didn’t reply. The Holy Dragon Flying Ship was a peak-grade cosmos artifact, but it was like a snail compared to the Purple Lightning Peak! There were genesis level formations all around the mountain, and it possessed much stronger offensive and defensive capabilities than the Holy Dragon Ship. Despite that, Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu couldn’t ascertain the grade of his treasure.

Perhaps, it was a creation level artifact…

After all, even peak level cosmos artifacts were far worse compared to the Purple Lightning Peak! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Master, should we come along?” Zhou Hong asked after snapping back to reality.

“There’s no need.” Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong refused their company. “Just arrange for two disciples to follow us there. In fact, the previous two will do.”

Tan Hua and the others were extremely interested to follow beside Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu, but since Huang Xiaolong had already given them the order, they could only arrange for Peng Fei and Jia Zhen to go along. When the two disciples of the Leiyu Creed entered the Purple Lightning Peak, the three Dao Venerables felt a trace of jealousy forming in their hearts.

Under their respectful gaze, the Purple Lightning Peak tore through the skies and disappeared through the skies.

It didn’t take long for the Purple Lightning Peak to leave the Leiyu Creed.

Since they needed to travel through four regions before arriving at the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch, Huang Xiaolong decided to visit each and every one of them along the way.

As per usual, Huang Xiaolong sparred with Lei Yu when the Purple Lightning Peak was traveling to its destination. In order to challenge himself, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Old Monster Flame and other experts who commanded absolute energies to assist Lei Yu during the sparring sessions.

There were thirteen experts who comprehended absolute powers in the Sun Moon Furnace, and eight of them were captured by Huang Xiaolong when he entered the Blue Lotus Pond in the past. Five more came from the Bright Lightning Abyss, and all of them were cultivators from the holy worlds.

Stationing the demons of the Outer World back in their respective regions, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bring them along with him. Otherwise, the number of experts who wielded absolute energies would reach a staggering number!

When he passed through the black regions of the Outer World previously, he subdued groups of Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm demons. He planned to bring all of them over when he eventually clashed with the Mystical Pavilion, but that wouldn’t happen anytime soon.

With the addition of thirteen experts who wielded absolute energies, Huang Xiaolong’s understanding of the powers he controlled deepened.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong reached perfection level in both the powers of absolute frost and poison. However, he was only able to utilize seventy percent of their power. After his constant sparring sessions, he was able to wield his powers with more than ninety percent efficiency!

Moreover, there were several experts who controlled the power of metal and wood. There were even some who could use the power of absolute earth and wind, and it was great practice for the upcoming battle with the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce!

With the addition of those from the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong’s understanding in the various energies deepened.

“What a pity… No one knows how to use the powers of space and time!” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but think of the Dark Shadow Devil.

It had been so many years, but the only person who could use the powers of space was the Dark Shadow Devil.

During the battle in the Blue Lotus Pond, Huang Xiaolong exterminated his shadow, but he failed to locate the other party’s true body!

In the past hundreds of years, Huang Xiaolong used the powers he controlled in the Divine Tuo Holy World and the Demon Buddha Alliance to look for him, but to no avail.

“I wonder if the Dark Shadow Devil is in the Origin Holy World…”

That wasn’t impossible.

The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor spoke to him about the matter before. The Dark Shadow Devil was born in the Origin Holy World, but he hadn’t been seen ever since. No one knew which Creed he came from, and no one knew his whereabouts.

Huang Xiaolong decided to investigate the matter after the auction ended.

If he managed to locate the Dark Shadow Devil, he would definitely be able to increase his understanding of the powers of space! Moreover, the Dark Shadow Devil seemed to know his father’s whereabouts.

After crossing the various creeds, Huang Xiaolong and his group finally arrived at the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch after one entire month.

It was located in the Qiongqi Sacred Land of the Cangming Creed! In the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, the Cangming Creed was ranked third! They were a force to be reckoned with, and the patriarch of the Cangming Creed had a pretty good relationship with the Mystical Pavilion Branch Master. As such, the Golden Fox Dao Venerable had to be respectful when facing the Cangming Dao Venerable.

As the branch was located in a place called the Xuan City, Huang Xiaolong ordered Lei Yu to head over as soon as they arrived in the Cangming Creed. As soon as they arrived, they were greeted by a sea of people. Experts from all over the land were streaming into the Xuan City without an end in sight.

“Even the Dragon Venerable Jian Huang came for the auction!”

“He’s not the only one! Fan Luo, the Stone Ancestor, and Dao Jianchou have already arrived in the city!”

“What?!”

Riding on Lei Yu on the streets, Huang Xiaolong managed to listen to everything those around him said. Fifteen experts followed behind them, and they were the thirteen experts from the Sun Moon Furnace and the two disciples of the Leiyu Creed.

Passing Peng Fei and Jia Zhen a hundred million dao coins, he requested for them to look for a decent inn. When they held the spatial ring with a hundred million dao coins, they felt as though their souls were about to leave their bodies.

After the two of them left, Huang Xiaolong and the others headed over to a restaurant.

“Is this the legendary Heaven Seizing Inn with the Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

There were tons of different types of rice in the Origin Holy World, and Huang Xiaolong tried the grains of the Fiery Light Maize previously. The Ice Phoenix True Dragon Rice was said to contain the highest amount of spiritual qi among the different grains, and it was a true treasure!

It was only sold in the Heaven Seizing Inn, and it was a crop that belonged solely to the Heaven Seizing Chamber of Commerce. In the Origin Holy World, the Heaven Seizing Chamber of Commerce was a behemoth that outclassed even the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce!
