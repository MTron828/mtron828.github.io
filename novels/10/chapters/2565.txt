Chapter 2566: Heading to the Ancient Battlefield

After getting to the ancient battlefield, obtaining the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, and advancing to the Second Heaven True Saint in one go, Huang Xiaolong planned to venture into the Alien Lands.

Despite the Holy World’s seven Primal Ancestors, the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, Elder Crow, Xue Lingyun, Mo Cangli, and the Holy Race’s first generation patriarch Jian Duzun, had formed an alliance, they weren’t able to completely eradicate the Devil Palace and Ghost Talisman Holy Ground at the moment.

But if Huang Xiaolong could get support from the Alien Lands’ forces, the whole situation would be different. There wouldn’t be any less Primal Ancestor Realm experts amongst the top forces on the Alien Lands.

The number of Primal Ancestor experts in the Alien Lands were not less than the Holy World’s side.

Seven Primal Ancestors couldn’t eradicate the Devil Palace and Ghost Talisman Holy Ground, but what about forty Primal Ancestors? Or fifty? What about sixty or even seventy Primal Ancestors?

“Manor Lord, the Bright Scale Holy Ground and Nine Treasures Holy Ground’s patriarchs are outside seeking an audience with you, as they want to join the Blue Dragon Manor.” a burly middle-aged man that exuded a robust wild aura respectfully approached Huang Xiaolong from the back and reported.

This middle-aged man was called Yuan Zhan, the patriarch of Torrent Origin Holy Ground, who was a Ninth Heaven True Saint expert. After swearing allegiance to Huang Xiaolong, he was loyal and devoted, and Huang Xiaolong had promoted him as one of his right-hand men, letting him manage many important matters of the Blue Dragon Manor with Di Huai.

“I know,” Huang Xiaolong responded and nodded slightly before adding, “You go out first.”

“Yes, Manor Lord.” Yuan Zhan respectfully withdrew.

Although Huang Xiaolong was still a Holy Prince of the Holy Heavens organisation, all the forces that had submitted to Huang Xiaolong referred to Huang Xiaolong as Manor Lord instead of Your Highness.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong went out to meet with the Bright Scale Holy Ground and Nine Treasures Holy Ground’s patriarchs. In the last decade, countless holy grounds and ancient races’ patriarchs had come to plead Huang Xiaolong to allow them to join the Blue Dragon Manor. After all, some of these holy grounds and ancient races could possibly be spies sent by the Devil Palace.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong would run a detailed background check on each of them.

Moreover, during this decade, Huang Xiaolong had indeed found more than a few spies, and there were more than thirty of them to be precise.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t have any mercy towards these thirty-plus spies who were sent by the Devil Palace or Ghost Talisman Holy Ground. All of them were devoured and refined as a warning to the Devil Palace and Ghost Talisman Holy Ground for trying to encroach inside the Blue Dragon Manor.

After meeting the Bright Scale Holy Ground and Nine Treasures Holy Ground’s patriarchs, Huang Xiaolong made a trip to the Primal Ancestor’s space.

“You want to go to the ancient battlefield?” The four Primal Ancestors were astonished hearing Huang Xiaolong’s plans to head to the ancient battlefield.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

“In the last one hundred years, the ancient battlefield’s situation has not been very stable. More Alien Lands’ cultivators have been crossing the barrier into the ancient battlefield, therefore, the current ancient battlefield is many times more dangerous than before!” Lord Long added, “If there is nothing special, it’s better you don’t go.”

“That’s right,” The Heavenly Master agreed. “The ancient battlefield’s barrier has grown increasingly unstable. More and more Alien Lands’ cultivators are entering the ancient battlefield, and there might even be peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint experts.”

The Heavenly Master went on seriously, “If it is not necessary, it’s better not to go to the ancient battlefield. Moreover, in less than a hundred years, the barrier would disappear. At that time, there might be a large-scale war between us and the Alien Lands.”

A barrier similar to a restriction had always enveloped the ancient battlefield region, and this barrier indirectly separated the Alien Lands and Holy World. Thus the Holy World and Alien Lands were able to maintain a certain degree of peace.

But this barrier would become unstable every few billion years or ten billion years, and at certain times the barrier would completely disappear temporarily. When the barrier disappeared, the Alien Lands’ native cultivators would lead an army into the Holy World territory, triggering the large- scale war between the Holy World and Alien Lands.

Now, the ancient battlefield’s barrier had become unstable again.

Listening to his four masters’ sincere persuasion, Huang Xiaolong did not conceal and told them about the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance.

After hearing that Huang Xiaolong intended to go to the ancient battlefield to look for the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, all four Primal Ancestors were genuinely surprised.

“Masters, don’t worry. Although the ancient battlefield is dangerous, at my current strength, the risk is not very high.” Huang Xiaolong smiled reassuringly, exuding a strong confidence.

He had integrated twelve high-order Saint Fates, and he possessed three complete dao saint godheads, Inextinguishable Dao Heart, and the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring, Cangqiong Dao Palace, and Cangqiong Blade. That was more than enough to protect himself, and Huang Xiaolong was naturally confident.

The four Primal Ancestors laughed while shaking their heads.

Indeed, with Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, their worries were a little superfluous.

“How about I send Wu Ge with you?” The Heavenly Master suggested after some thought, “One more person will give you added strength. After all, there is safety in numbers.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and refused, “There is no need for that because after finding the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, I want to go to the Alien Lands.”

“What? You are planning to go to the Alien Lands?!” The four Primal Ancestors blurted in unison.

“No!” The four added almost in the same breath.

“Xiaolong, the Alien Lands are very dangerous. Although you are sufficiently strong, once your identity is exposed, what you will be facing would be an entire Alien Lands’ cultivators!”

Elder Crow shook his head. “It’s too dangerous! You cannot go!”

“Your safety is related to the entire Holy World’s rise in the future, therefore, you cannot jeopardize your safety for a moment of playful impulse!” Lord Long chided.

“No, I don’t feel at ease,” Tyrant Chu stressed, “You brat definitely won’t listen to us, therefore, I will go to the ancient battlefield with you. If you dare to cross over to the Alien Lands, I will tie you up and drag you back.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly.

Had he known this would happen, he wouldn’t have said anything about going to the Alien Lands.

A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the Primal Ancestor’s space, and let out a big breath of relief. After spending several hours persuading his four masters and agreeing to many conditions, he had finally got his four masters’ permission.

Back at the Cangqiong Holy Land’s Blue Dragon Manor headquarters, Huang Xiaolong gathered Di Huai, Yuan Zhan, and others over and exhorted them many tasks. However, he did not inform any of them that he was heading to the ancient battlefield, merely mentioning that he would be away for some time. When he was away, if they met with matters they could not decide, they could look for the Holy Heavens’ Grand Hall Master Wu Ge.

Di Huai, Yuan Zhan, and others complied with Huang Xiaolong’s orders.

Huang Xiaolong left the Cangqiong Holy Ground several days later, heading to the ancient battlefield.

The ancient battlefield was located on the Holy World’s northern edge, and it was a long distance away. Even with the Cangqiong Dao Palace, it would take him half a year to reach the destination.

But, before Huang Xiaolong set off to the ancient battlefield, he decided to stop by the Profound River and Black Corpse Devil Cave to look for that giant black corpse. He planned to continue his journey towards the ancient battlefield after subjugating it.

When he had obtained the Black Corpse Holy Ring at the Ghost Devil City, Huang Xiaolong had once wondered if that black corpse was the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s body. But after he had broken through to True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong had quashed this thought.

He was certain that the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s body would not exude the same horrifying dark corpse qi and devil qi as the black corpse.

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong once again appeared above the Profound River as he headed straight to the Black Corpse Devil Cave. In the past, Huang Xiaolong had to rely on the Winged Dragon Flying Ship and proceed with extra caution, but now, he could venture straight into the dark corpse qi and devil qi without being affected.

The moment he entered the Black Corpse Devil Cave, the familiar howling shrieks entered his ear.
