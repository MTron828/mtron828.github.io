Chapter 228: Clues of Godly Mt. Xumi’s Location

“Whaㅡt? Self-created battle skill!” The seven other old men blurted in amazement at the idea.

“This, not possible... right?” One of them queried uncertainly.

As far as they knew, every battle skill was handed down from ancient times, every battle skill that they knew of now was created by the human race of ancient times, whereas legendary heaven rank battle skills were created by the ancient God Tribes.

However, legendary battle skills were lost treasures as time elapsed, leaving only high-grade heaven rank battle skills as the highest grade available, albeit their scarcity.

“That’s right ah, Old Law. It doesn’t seem like this kid knows how to create a battle skill, it’s a feat even harder than breaking into the God realm! Even some warriors that succeeded in breaking through and traversed to other higher grade worlds were never rumored to have created their own battle skill!” Another one of the old men debated with surprise lingering in his voice.

Old Law answered with a solemn voice, “I did not believe it myself at first but observe carefully and you will notice that when he first started practicing this skill, his movements were crude and simple. Nearing the end, however, it became smoother and complete, the changes when attacking became more unpredictable, and the potency increased over time. Look, every time he practices, he continues to improve and perfect the transformations.”

When the rest heard this explanation, each started to observe Huang Xiaolong’s actions more closely and noticed it was as Old Law had described.

Despite that, most of them still found it hard to believe what they were seeing.

Creating a battle skill, if this was leaked out, it would definitely cause an earth-shattering quake across the Martial Spirit World.

At the same time, inside the Buddha Cavern, Huang Xiaolong leaped up with his palm striking out. Countless Buddha statues were seen emerging from the ground, exuding an overwhelming spiritual pressure.

The current of time continued to flow, and soon, a month had passed.

Huang Xiaolong had spent an entire month inside the Buddha Cavern.

On this particular day, Huang Xiaolong was flying forward, when suddenly, the scene in front him changed! A vast stretch of mountainous region with towering age-old trees and winding rivers with crystal-clear emerald water. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

No more Buddha statues!

In this one month, Buddha statues were the only objects Huang Xiaolong had seen, so much that it gave rise to a belief that other than Buddha statues, nothing else existed within the Buddha Cavern.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart blossomed seeing green mountains up ahead, accelerating his flying speed, he left the Buddha statues region quickly and landed at the foothills of a mountain. Out of the Buddha statues region, a deep sense of relief washed over him the moment his feet touched solid ground.

In the Buddha statues region, Huang Xiaolong’s soul and spiritual force felt like they were being squashed by a big boulder that was instantly lifted now.

Huang Xiaolong turned back to look at the vast region of endless Buddha statues, he shivered, slightly traumatized. This one month was worse than being stranded in the abyss of hell.

Drawing a deep breath, Huang Xiaolong turned back and started walking towards the forest, soon reaching the peak. Entering his sight were long ranges of mountains, winding into the horizon, causing Huang Xiaolong’s brows to wrinkle. ‘Don’t tell me that I need to spend another month to cross this mountain region!’

The lack of reaction from the three Heavenly Treasures in his body frustrated Huang Xiaolong.

‘Forget it, since I’m already here it’s better I continue searching for it.’ Huang Xiaolong comforted himself, he would never be willing to leave things half-assed this way.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong flew deep in the mountain region direction. And soon, another month came and went.

By this point in time, Huang Xiaolong no longer harbored any hope of finding the Godly Mt. Xumi here, especially when all three Heavenly Treasure showed not even the tiniest reaction. In Huang Xiaolong’s opinion, if the Godly Mt. Xumi was really somewhere here in the Buddha Cavern, there would surely be some reaction from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, God Binding Ring and the Absolute Soul Pearl.

Making a resolute decision, Huang Xiaolong decided to give it ten more days’ time. If there still wasn’t any reaction from the three treasures within this ten days’ time, he would leave the Buddha Cavern.

He would think of another way that didn’t require the Godly Mt. Xumi.

Perhaps he could search for the second or third Heavenly Treasures on the list. Moreover, his Master Ren Wokuang left a precious treasure for him in the Asura’s Gate headquarters, something that would aid in his Asura Tactics cultivation. With that, and the benefits from the Lingling Treasure Pagoda, God Binding Ring and the Absolute Soul Pearl, he could still enhance his strength rapidly to reach Xiantian Tenth Order.

Three days passed quickly like grains of sand seeping through one’s fingers.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong stopped beside a river bank at the foothills. Just as he wanted to wash up, a golden light flickered from the riverbed. Although it was only for a split second, Huang Xiaolong caught a glimpse of it.

His actions stopped and he released his spiritual sense, directing it towards the bottom of the river, but his spiritual sense encountered a resistance at the edge of the river bank. Curious, Huang Xiaolong stood up. After a brief hesitation, he leaped up, opened up a path leading downward and made his way to the riverbed.

In the river, Huang Xiaolong dived deeper.

From the surface, the river didn’t seem wide. Only after Huang Xiaolong dived into the river, did he realize it was much bigger than he had thought. He sank more than a hundred zhang deep before he reached the riverbed.

The instant Huang Xiaolong leaped into the river, Old Law and the seven other old men who were watching Huang Xiaolong suddenly noticed that his aura disappeared.

“Could this river be another space dimension?” One of them muttered.

Inside the Buddha Cavern existed links to many different space dimensions. Though the eight of them were guardians of Buddha Cavern, none knew how many of these other dimensions there were within the Buddha Cavern.

“That kid’s aura had vanished totally, no doubt this river is a different space dimension.” Another old man voiced his opinion.

“Old Law, then we...?”

“Go with the flow, our mission is to guard the Buddha Cavern.”

“Yes, Old Law!”

On the other side, down on the riverbed, another bright light flickered and a black hole appeared. Before Huang Xiaolong could react, a great suction force from the black hole wrapped around him, swallowing him in.

His vision blurred. The scene changed and Huang Xiaolong was standing upon a golden sand beach.

“This is...?” In front of Huang Xiaolong was a sea the color of gold, with gentle waves washing upon the golden sand beach. There was a small boat floating on the sea, with an old man in his seventies holding a fishing rod.

At what seemed to be the center of this golden sea sat a golden mountain.

The surroundings were very quiet. Looking at this scene, Huang Xiaolong was stupefied.

“Young man, welcome to the Sea of Suffering.” While Huang Xiaolong was stupefied at the sudden change in his surroundings, the old man on the boat spoke.

“The Sea of Suffering!” Huang Xiaolong looked at the large expanse of golden sea.

The old man raised his head, revealing a long white beard that fluttered in the nonexistent breeze as he smiled at Huang Xiaolong, “It has been sixty thousand years... Finally, someone entered this Sea of Suffering space after a long sixty thousand years.”

“Sixty thousand years!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked. This old man meant to say he stayed in this Sea of Suffering space for more than sixty thousand years? Wouldn’t that mean this old man had lived more than sixty thousand years!

What concept was that!?

Not even a Saint realm expert could live that long!

Could this old man be... Huang Xiaolong sucked in a breath of cold air.

“Young man, you entered Buddha Cavern for the Godly Mt. Xumi right?” The old man continued at his own pace.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised and wary at the same time. How did this old man know?

“Yes.” Seconds later, Huang Xiaolong composed himself and admitted his purpose.

The old man chuckled, “Not bad, at least you’re honest. Then, I shall tell you. Yes, the Godly Mt. Xumi is indeed within the Buddha Cavern.”

The Godly Mt. Xumi was inside the Buddha Cavern!
