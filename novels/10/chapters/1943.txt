“Huang Peng!”

“Father!”

“Grandpa!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Everyone’s faces changed when they saw Huang Peng’s miserable condition.

Everyone rushed over towards him and helped him up. When they saw the horrifying scars on his body, hatred and rage welled up in their hearts.

“Brother Peng, are you alright?!” Su Yan started to cry as she pressed her hands onto his wound. She used all the godforce she could muster to try to stop Huang Peng’s injury from becoming worse.

Since none of them had any pills to treat his injury, she could only use the most primitive method available.

It was too bad that his wound was profound. Blood flowed non-stop.

Huang Peng lowered his head weakly. “Don’t worry, I’m fine. I will live until the day I see my son.”

Su Yan could no longer hold her tears back as she bawled her eyes out.

The disciple raised his whip again, and he snapped impatiently at her, “B*tch, don’t think that I won’t whip you if you don’t stop crying?!”

Huang Peng hastily stopped Su Yan from crying as he shook his head.

However, Guo Xiaofan couldn’t help himself as he tried to explain to the Heavenly God Realm disciples. “Lords, my uncle is really called Huang Xiaolong. I know about aunt Li Lu, and she was his childhood sweetheart in the lower realm!”

Even though none of them cared about him, Guo Xiaofan continued to explain.

If he didn’t say anything, there wouldn’t be a chance of them ever believing him. If he said something, there was a chance they might actually listen to him!

A sneer escaped the disciple’s lips. “How dare you remain stubborn?! Don’t think that I don’t know what you guys are planning. Do you really think we’ll release you if you claim that Huang Xiaolong is your son?! I’ve seen this too many times!”

It was true. In order to escape, many Highgod Realm cultivators came up with all sorts of excuses.

Guo Xiaofan didn’t want to give up and he eventually ate a whip from the Heavenly God Realm expert. He was sent flying and suffered the same fate as Huang Peng. In fact, his wounds were worse than Huang Peng, and his blood stained the ground red.

“Xiaofan!” Everyone screamed as they ran over to support him.

Everyone glared at the group of Heavenly God Realm disciples.

However, they were only met with a casual glance from these disciples. One of them spoke, “If anyone dares to come up with reasons to escape, they will be whipped three times! I’ll cripple one of their hands!”

Everyone’s expressions changed.

They needed both their arms in order to dig, and if one of the arms was crippled, there would no longer be a way for them to hit their target. They would die a horrible death at the end of the month if that was the case.

...

Several days later, in the Fortune Divine Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong looked at the clouds of spiritual qi swirling around the mountain peak as he tightly knitted his brows together. It had already been a month, but no one had managed to find any news about his parents.

Every day felt like a year, and he felt especially uneasy these few days.

In the distance, two figures slowly approached him.

It was precisely Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao.

As they appeared beside Huang Xiaolong, they noticed the dejected look on his face. They looked at each other but failed to think of a way to console him.

“Xiaolong, don’t worry, uncle and aunty will definitely be fine. Don’t overthink things...” Fang Xuanxuan eventually decided to say something.

“That’s right! Xiaolong, with the strength of the Silver Fox Commerce, there will definitely be news of them soon!” Peng Xiao hastily followed up.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and sighed, “I hope so.”

“Xiaolong, some of the Emperor Palaces sent over news that Heavenly Prince Di Jing managed to break into the Emperor Realm. With his Heavenly Dao Divine Physique and Godhead, no one would be able to kill him!” Fang Xuanxuan suddenly thought of the report she had heard previously and relayed the information to Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong felt a little shocked when he heard the news. He had never expected Di Jing to be able to enter the Emperor Realm so quickly.

As he became the embodiment of the Heavenly Dao, his body was indestructible and his soul would never scatter... Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up.

“Also, we heard that Heavenly Prince Di Jing and Heavenly Emperor Di Jun managed to invite a monstrous old freak. Some say that he will be there to deal with Shi Ming, but others say that he is there to deal with the King of Grandmist!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned, and a surprised look flashed through his eyes. “Which old monster did they manage to invite?”

Since the rumor could spread, the report was most probably true. Huang Xiaolong knew that it didn’t matter who was the old freak they had managed to invite. But he was afraid that the old freak they had invited wouldn’t lose to his master, the King of Grandmist, if they were to fight.

“We don’t know who it is.” Fang Xuanxuan shook his head. “Perhaps the King of Grandmist might know...”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. After he found his family members, he would head over to the Grandmist Lands before going to the Radiance World.

I wonder how the little cow is doing... Did she manage to regain her strength?

Even though the number of experts around him was aplenty, he knew that he lacked Sovereign Realm experts. If the little cow recovered her strength, she would be another strong fighting force for him.

He also had to think of a way for the four odd beasts, the radiance angels, Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, and the other Great Commanders to break through to Sovereign Realm.

All of them were trapped at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm for several billion years. They needed nothing but a stroke of luck to break through to the next realm.

Just as he was thinking about them, his transmission symbol shook. Huang Xiaolong retrieved it, and to his surprise, it came from Bei Xiaomei!

“Fire Stone World. Earth Shattering Gang!” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t control himself as a look of joy appeared on his face. He had finally managed to locate them!

According to what Bei Xiaomei said, his family members were located on the Fire Stone World.

“Xiaolong, did you receive news about uncle and aunty?” Fang Xuanxuan couldn’t help but ask when she saw the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and passed his transmission symbol to the two girls.

They rejoiced when they saw Bei Xiaomei’s message.

“That’s great! Xiaolong, shouldn’t we hurry over to the Fire Stone World right now?” Fang Xuanxuan couldn’t help but ask when she saw the expression on his face.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. “You guys want to go as well?”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao nodded in unison. Their faces flushed red at the same time as they thought of something.

“Alright. We shall head over to the Fire Stone World right now!” Huang Xiaolong declared. He knew that the most important thing right now was to head over to the Fire Stone World.

The three of them flew in the Netherking Flying Ship as they charged towards the Fire Stone World.
