Chapter 2690: You’re Not Qualified to be My Descendant

Huang Xiaolong closed his fist after everything Guo Chen had unleashed, including his grand dao energy, grand dao art, and battle-spirits, were trapped between his fingers. The terrifying energy popped like a bubble, and it seemed as though it hadn’t existed in the first place.

Not stopping there, Huang Xiaolong extended his fingers once again.

Before Guo Chen could react, he felt the world spinning around him as a force stronger than anything he had ever experienced locked his body in place. After being dragged across the space, he appeared before Huang Xiaolong.

“What?!” The Primal Ancestors in the hall yelled in shock.

Even people like Yuan Qianxing and Yuan Wanfei were stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s display of strength.

Elder Ming, who had been looking down on Huang Xiaolong since the moment he had appeared in the hall, couldn't help but turn a little serious.

Guo Chen was a peak late-Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor! How could he lose to Huang Xiaolong so easily?!

As for the person in question, Guo Chen, panic flashed in his eyes as he stuttered, “You… You…!”

Was the person who had captured him really the True Saint, Huang Xiaolong?!

How was someone at his level unable to move when facing a mere True Saint?!

“You’ll call me your ancestor if I manage to take on a single punch?” Huang Xiaolong sneered. After all that was what Guo Chen had yelled when he had made his move earlier.

“You can’t even take a punch from me. As such, you’re not qualified to call me your ancestor!” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Guo Chen’s expression turned extremely unsightly as he struggled with all his might. He tried pushing his dao soul to their limit, but he realized that the strength Huang Xiaolong possessed was more terrifying than he could ever imagine. He felt as though a mountain was weighing down on him from all directions.

“Huang Xiaolong, free Brother Guo Chen right now!” Another Primal Ancestor who had better relationships with Guo Chen yelled.

“Release him?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “I gave you a choice. All of you wanted to force yourself through this narrow gate of enmity I had with Yuan Qianxing and the others.” After sealing Guo Chen’s energy, he threw the man into the Cangqiong Dao Palace to be with Mo Jincheng.

“That’s one,” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he swept his gaze across those present once again. “Who’s going to be number two?” His gaze eventually landed on Jiang Heng and Teng Xiao.

The blood drained from their faces in an instant as they took several steps backwards.

What a joke. At the peak of the late-Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, Guo Chen was done in by Huang Xiaolong with the wave of an arm! They hadn’t even reached the Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re celebrating too early!” Guo Chen screamed from the Cangqiong Dao Palace, “Elder Ming has yet to make his move! The moment he does, you’ll be on your knees begging for your life!”

“That’s right!” Everyone in the hall chimed.

Yuan Qianxing looked at Yuan Wanfei. A trace of suspicion flashed in their eyes as they turned to look at Elder Ming.

As he slowly made his way towards Huang Xiaolong, Elder Ming’s robes started to flutter. The color of the heavens changed as a trace of frost, nefarious intent, and bloodthirst filled the headquarters of the Otherworldly Mansion.

“Peak of the late-Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm.” Elder Ming glared at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Who would have thought that someone like you would be able to escape from the Death Cave… You even managed to break through so quickly.”

Even though he was shocked that Huang Xiaolong had cultivated so quickly, he was still confident in his abilities to suppress the other party.

After all, he was in the mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

Even Mo Zhi, an early-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, had to escape when they had fought! Then why should he be afraid of facing a Sixth Heaven True Saint?!

Killing intent burst from his eyes and they alternated between red and black. This time, he would ensure that Huang Xiaolong died!

If he allowed the brat to escape, he was afraid that someone at his level wouldn't be able to do a thing once Huang Xiaolong entered the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm.

“Too bad you’re not my opponent!” Elder Ming’s aura expanded as the space around him shattered.

“Today is the day you die!”

As soon as he spoke, he sent his palms flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

Two massive palms glowing red and black seemed to contain the limitless power of the netherworld as they charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

Seas of blood and endless abyss stretched as far as the eyes could see as the nefarious qi swallowed everything in its path.

Vengeful spirits howled in the seas of blood and the cries of devils could be heard echoing in the endless abyss.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Descent of the Nefarious Divination!”

Elder Ming’s voice resounded through the skies and everyone in the hall retreated in a hurry.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to receive the attack casually as he activated all three dao souls and his twelve high-grade Saint Fates surrounded him. The power of the grand dao poured down from the void like a heavenly river.

The Cangqiong Blade appeared in his hands, and he slashed it across the air.

In the instant he drew the arc across the sky, everyone felt as though Huang Xiaolong had split the world in two.

The blade light flashed and it tore through the seas of blood and endless abyss to arrive before Elder Ming.

Elder Ming widened his eyes and waved his arm as a mysterious light surrounded them. By the time he stopped retreating, he was several miles out. Moreover, he had cut a pretty sorry figure after defending himself from Huang Xiaolong’s Cangqiong Blade strike.

“What?!” Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, Jiang Heng, and the others couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

What happened?!

Elder Ming’s expression was jet-black as he spat, “Cangqiong Strike!”

In the past, Huang Xiaolong had executed the same move when he was surrounded by them. The power contained in his attack back then was nothing compared to the slash that had sent Elder Ming flying! Right now, he could see the shadow of the Cangqiong Old Man in Huang Xiaolong!

He also couldn’t believe that a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor at his level would be threatened by Huang Xiaolong’s attack!

Right now, Huang Xiaolong was an existence stronger than Mo Zhi! No! Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess could put him to shame!

No matter how much he tried to deny it, Huang Xiaolong was indeed stronger than him!

With a mysterious light flashing in his eyes, the Magic Pagoda in his hands shot into the skies to release a ray of black light.

Long Jianfei’s expression sank when he saw the pagoda.

Can it be?

A yell escaped Elder Ming’s lips all of a sudden, and it was as though the heavens exploded. The skies shook as the Magic Pagoda started to enlarge itself. Streams of black light poured down and surged towards Huang Xiaolong.

By reaching out with his right hand, Huang Xiaolong attempted to grab the tower.

“You’re asking to die!” Elder Ming sneered as a trace of joy flashed in his heart.

The black light emitted by the pagoda wasn’t an ordinary attack. It was a type of divination poison that was refined through several trillion years. Even a Primal Ancestor’s dao physique would corrode if they touched the light, and their dao soul would suffer serious damage! They would even be corrupted by the pagoda!

One could only imagine their sorry end if they were corrupted by the pagoda.

While Elder Ming laughed sarcastically at the side, resplendent rays of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s arm before he touched the Magic Pagoda.
