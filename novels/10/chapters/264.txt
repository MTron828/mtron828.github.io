Chapter 265: You Think This Is A Joke?

“Not a threat?” Jiang Tianhua nodded, perhaps he worried too much. Just like what his subordinate Cui Ming said, even if Chen Xiaotian and Geng Ken reached an agreement, they still didn’t pose a threat to him.

“Open the door.” Jiang Tianhua said to a Blood Swallow School Elder standing beside him.

“Yes, Doyen!” Responding to Jiang Tianhua, that Elder stepped to the front, gathering force in his palm and striking against the door leading to Sky Magi Sect’s great hall. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A loud blast sounded as the door shattered.

“Enter.” Jiang Tianhua ordered with a wave of his hand. Cui Ming and the Elders followed behind Jiang Tianhua in a line.

Upon entering the great hall, Jiang Tianhua saw both Chen Xiaotian and Geng Ken. Apart from the two of them, the Sky Magi Sect’s Elders were also present. However, what stunned Jiang Tianhua was that in the main throne seat inside the hall sat an unfamiliar black-haired young man, while Chen Xiaotian, Geng Ken, and the rest were standing respectfully on the left and right.

Without exception, everyone was shocked noticing this, including Cui Ming and the others that entered after Jiang Tianhua. But then again, amongst the Blood Swallow School Elders that came with Jiang Tianhua, a large portion had submitted to Huang Xiaolong, thus there wasn’t much surprise coming from them.

Jiang Tianhua stood there, even forgetting his purpose of coming to the Sky Magi Sect.

A black-haired young man was actually sitting on the Sky Magi Sect’s Sovereign throne, this was too shocking to him.

“Doyen Jiang is surprised?” At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s voice dawdled, his fingers curled upon the armrest, gently tapping, issuing a monotonous tapping sound.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s voice jolted Jiang Tianhua back to his senses.

“Who are you?” Jiang Tianhua couldn’t resist blurting the question. His reflex reaction was to find out this black-haired young man’s identity. Cui Ming and the Blood Swallow School Elders also turned their attention onto Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong laughed indifferently at Jiang Tianhua’s question, “Who I am is not important, it wouldn’t matter even if you knew. Now, the Sky Magi Sect is under my control, Chen Xiaotian, Geng Ken, and all the Sky Magi Sect Elders have submitted to me.”

“What?!” Jiang Tianhua’s face tightened.

Chen Xiaotian, Geng Ken, and all the Sky Magi Sect Elders submitted to this black-haired young man! No one from the Blood Swallow School’s group could hide the shock from their faces, including Jiang Tianhua, Cui Ming, or the Elders.

When did this happen? How come the Blood Swallow Sect did not receive any news?

At this point, Jiang Tianhua finally understood why Chen Xiaotian and Geng Ken suddenly showed a united front. Why Chen Xiaotian and Geng Ken would refuse to cooperate with the Blood Swallow Sect.

The root cause of all this was the black-haired young man! Everything was happening because this black-haired young man had said so.

Cui Ming also reached the same conclusion, and his face turned ugly.

After a momentary blunder, Jiang Tianhua forced himself to appear calm, showing an amiable smile towards Huang Xiaolong, “So Sky Magi Sect is under this Brother’s control. My purpose in coming here today is to propose an alliance with Brother against the Nine Fiend Sect.”

“Alliance with me, against the Nine Fiend Sect.” Huang Xiaolong muttered, nothing could be read from this calm expression.

“That’s right. I’m sure Brother is aware, if our Blood Swallow School is destroyed or merged into the Nine Fiend Sect, then the next target would be Sky Magi Sect.” Jiang Tianhua affirmed.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled lightly.

Jiang Tianhua frowned at Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, “What is Brother laughing at?” there wasn’t anything funny in what he just said.

Huang Xiaolong faced Jiang Tianhua, “How do you know that it won’t be me that will destroy the Nine Fiend Sect?”

Jiang Tianhua blanked.

“You? Annihilate the Nine Fiend Sect?” Cui Ming couldn’t hold it in any longer, “Relying on you and this small Sky Magi Sect you control?”

Obviously, in Cui Ming’s opinion, Huang Xiaolong was too arrogant, overestimating his abilities.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes swept over Cui Ming, “If you kneel down now and beg for mercy, perhaps I can consider sparing your life.”

“What did you say?!” Cui Ming turned gloomy, glaring ferociously at Huang Xiaolong. Without warning, a bright light burst from Cui Ming’s body.

A person’s battle qi grade was related to the grade of their cultivation technique, whereas a person’s battle qi color was influenced by their martial spirit. In general, white colored battle qi was seldom seen.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Cui Ming’s white-colored battle qi and snickered. From Chen Xiaotian and Geng Ken’s mouths, he already knew that this Cui Ming’s martial spirit was the Ghostface martial spirit.

The Ghostface martial spirit belonged to a rare type of necro-martial spirits and there were two kinds of Ghostface martial spirits, one was the Black GhostFace and the other was the White Ghostface. Cui Ming’s martial spirit was White Ghostface.

However, just as Cui Ming was about to attack, Jiang Tianhua extended his arm out, blocking Cui Ming. The entire time, Jiang Tianhua’s eyes never left Huang Xiaolong. With a condescending, mocking snicker, he directed Huang Xiaolong a question, “You think that relying on Sky Magi Sect’s strength you can annihilate the Nine Fiend Sect?”

Ignoring the other side’s mockery, Huang Xiaolong retorted nonchalantly, “Perhaps now it is insufficient, but after reigning in Blood Swallow School, it can be done.”

Huang Xiaolong’s reply was so stupefying that it caused Jiang Tianhua and Cui Ming to stiffen for a moment. In the next second, one after another, powerful battle qi soared, turning the entire great hall into the eye of the storm.

“Are you sure that what you’ve said is not a joke?” Jiang Tianhua glared sharply at Huang Xiaolong, undisguised killing intent flitting past his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong replied with another question: “Do you think it was a joke?”

In the tense deadlock, a scream rendered the air and another powerful aura targeted Jiang Tianhua from the back. Jiang Tianhua’s face tightened, with no time to think, he leaped into the air as his palm poised, snaking an attack to the hidden assailant.

A loud blast shook the spacious hall.

Landing on another side of the great hall, Jiang Tianhua turned and saw amongst the group of Blood Swallow School Elders that came with him that five of them laid on the floor, whereas the ones who attacked them were the other Blood Swallow School Elders!

“You all!” Jiang Tianhua and Cui Ming were shocked and angered.

Several Blood Swallow School Elders came before Huang Xiaolong, kneeling down in salute, “Greeting the Young Lord!”

Greeting the Young Lord? Jiang Tianhua and Cui Ming’s jaws dropped when they heard that, the expressions on their faces turning worse.

“All of you, stand up.” Huang Xiaolong looked at the group of Blood Swallow Sect Elders that knelt before him and said.

“We thank the Young Lord!” Only then did the Elders stand up and retreated to the side.

Among the sixteen Blood Swallow School Elders that Jiang Tianhua brought with him to Sky Magi Sect, eleven of them had already submitted to Huang Xiaolong. When these eleven people launched a lightning fast sneak attack, other than Cui Ming and Jiang Tianhua, the remaining five Elders were all injured.

“You group of traitors!” Cui Ming roared in anger! His silhouette blurred in a flicker, targeting a Blood Swallow School Elder next to Huang Xiaolong. As Cui Ming slammed his palm down, a whitebone hand clawed at that Elder.

But, before Cui Ming’s attack reached its target, a cold snort sounded in the hall. Huang Xiaolong flew out from the throne seat, one palm strike bringing forth ten thousand Buddhas as Buddha luminescence lit up the hall.

Earthen Buddha Palm!

The Earthen Buddha Palm instantly shattered the whitebone claw, and at the same time, Huang Xiaolong reached right in front of Cui Ming.

Caught with no retreat, Cui Ming made a desperate attack, striking a palm at Huang Xiaolong first, but just as he attacked, a fist imprint enlarged right before his pupils. Terrified, it was as if he fell into a quicksand in mid-air, unable to move.

Huang Xiaolong’s punch landed on his chest.

A powerful force exploded.
