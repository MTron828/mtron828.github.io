“Father wants to see me? Do you know what it’s about?” Hun Dishan asked.

The deacon shook his head before leading Hun Dishan to the Soul Tribe’s main hall.

Inside the hall was a tall middle-aged man standing with his hands behind his back, exuding a regal air that raised a palpable feeling of awe in others.

This middle-aged man was none other than the Soul Tribe Patriarch, Hun Yueyang.

“Father,” Hun Dishan stopped a few feet from his father and respectfully greeted.

Hun Yueyang had his back to Hun Dishan, nodding once, “You’re here.” His calm and majestic voice sounded as he turned around. His eyes resembled the timeless stars, so bright that no one dared to look at them directly.

Hun Dishan lowered his head.

“I have a task for you. You need to head to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.” Hun Yueyang spoke of the matter directly.

‘The Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield?’ Hun Dishan was caught off guard for a second.

Hun Yueyang went on, “I received news that someone saw two Asura Kings on the Lightning Lagoon Mainland at the edge of Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.”

“Two Asura Kings!” Hun Dishan was surprised at the news. Within the Asura Clan, once their members’ cultivation reached the Ancient God Realm, they were titled as Asura Kings.

However, the Asura Clan experts rarely appeared in the Divine World. This was the reason why Hun Dishan was surprised when he heard that two Asura Kings had appeared in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

“These two Asura Kings’ strength isn’t high, somewhere around Fourth Order Ancient God Realm. I want you to head over to the Lightning Lagoon Mainland, find these two Asura Kings and bring them back.” Hun Yueyang solemnly continued, “I suspect there’s something on the Lightning Lagoon Mainland that attracted those two.”

It made no sense for two Asura Kings to risk coming to the Divine World for no reason.

“Yes, father, I understand.” Hun Dishan nodded.

Hun Yueyang added, “Grand Elders Hun Xing, Hun Cheng, Hun Biwu, and Hun Xin will be going with you. Remember, there must be no mistakes this time. Immediately bring the two Asura Kings back once you found them, do not dally.”

Hun Xing, Hun Cheng, Hun Biwu, and Hun Xin were the Soul Tribe’s Four Great Grand Elders, all four at Seventh Order Ancient God Realm.

Hun Yueyang felt that having these four people support his son, coupled with the fact that their destination was only at the edge of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, there was no doubt they would bring back the two Asura Kings.

Hun Dishan respectfully complied.

Two days later.

Hun Dishan took his leave after bidding farewell to his father, flying out from the Soul Islands with the four Grand Elders. Roughly one month later, they appeared in the vast space outside of the Vientiane World.

Hun Dishan looked at the humongous black mass floating in the vast space, then at the four Grand Elders. Without a word, the five of them teleported continuously, getting closer to the black mass with each teleportation.

Despite executing continuous teleportation, it still took the five of them two months before reaching the border even though the Vientiane World was one of the closest world surfaces to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. It would take an Ancient God Realm master from other world surfaces that were further away at least half a year to reach its border.

It was common for cultivators from far distant world surfaces to travel for one year, or even two years to reach the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield’s border.

Just as Hun Dishan was hurrying over from the Vientiane World, tens of thousands of Ancient God Realm cultivators from various sects and forces belonging to other world surfaces close to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield were also hurrying over, including a few experts above the Ancient God Realm.

Every year, countless Ancient God Realm cultivators ventured into the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, but their deaths were countless as well.

Not long after Hun Dishan and the four Soul Tribe Grand Elders tore through the natural barrier and flew inside the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, there was another group coming from the direction of the Vientiane World, with Huang Xiaolong among them.

Huang Xiaolong was sitting atop a Cloud Devouring Divine Beast as it whizzed through space, whereas the little cow Xiaoniū was on the other beast.

However, the picture of a cow perched atop an ancient divine beast was simply incongruous. Huang Xiaolong had a hard time holding back his laughter.

The little cow suddenly turned its head to the side, looking at him, “Master, you’re almost purple from holding back, you can laugh if you want to.”

Hearing this, Huang Xiaolong burst out laughing without restraint. With the little cow accompanying him, the long journey didn’t feel dull at all.

Half a month after Hun Dishan’s group arrived, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts appeared at the border of Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

On the other side of the barrier, dense black-colored qi roiled like sea waves. From time to time, gray death qi and purple nefarious qi appeared on the surface.

The barrier itself was a kind of energy that exuded a faint dark glow.

Only cultivators with Ancient God Realm cultivation and above could tear the barrier and enter. Then again, this wasn’t a problem for Huang Xiaolong and Xiaoniū who had the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts.

In a few seconds, the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts tore a hole in the barrier and entered the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield with Huang Xiaolong and the little cow. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The instant they passed through the barrier, roiling devil qi engulfed them, it was as if they had fallen into an ocean of devil qi. This devil qi’s corrosive nature forced most Ancient God Realm cultivators to circulate their godforce to resist, but Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Supreme Godhead started rotating on its own.

At a speed visible to the naked eye, the surrounding devil qi, death qi, and purple nefarious qi rushed into him, completely absorbed by his Archdevil Supreme Godhead.

The little cow’s eyes nearly fell out from their socket staring in horror at Huang Xiaolong.

It had lived for thousands of millennia but this was the first time witnessing someone who could absorb all three types of qi flowing inside the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!

Being able to absorb the devil qi here was not rare, however, Huang Xiaolong’s godhead could actually absorb the death qi and nefarious qi as well?

Xiaoniū sensed Huang Xiaolong’s aura slowly but steadily rose as he absorbed the three types of qi. Although the changes were negligible, it was clear as day to Xiaoniū.

“What’re you looking at? Let’s go, someone’s coming.” Huang Xiaolong reminded the little cow and fly forward on the Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts.

The little cow and the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast it was riding hurried after them.

“Where do the devil qi, death qi, and nefarious qi here come from?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked at the little cow and asked.

The little cow explained, “At the heart of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield is the sealed path to the Devil World. The devil qi here seeps out from the sealed entrance even though the seal prevents devils from crossing over, whereas the death qi and nefarious qi have accumulated through the years as more and more cultivators died here.”

“The Devil World!” Huang Xiaolong did not expect that.

At the heart of this Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield was the path to the Devil World?!

Just like the Divine World and Hell, the Devil World too was a higher realm.

Devils existed in the numerous world surfaces but their birthplace was the Devil World.

“You think it’s strange?” The little cow snickered watching Huang Xiaologn’s reaction, "What’s strange about it? Why do you think it’s called the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield? Whenever the seal’s power is at its weakest, those devils would assemble a great army to invade the Divine World. At that time, the Divine World’s army would fight them here, right in this Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!”
