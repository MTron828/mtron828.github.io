Chapter 3162: Also Huang Long Bloodline?

Huang Shuai and every Mystical Pavilion expert’s heart tightened when they sensed a group of experts rushing towards them.

“Attack!”

Cang Xun and Di Shuang shouted in unison as they simultaneously attacked Huang Shuai. The Huang Long Cape was on Huang Shuai. Hence, anyone from the Mystical Pavilion could be allowed to leave, but absolutely not Huang Shuai!

The two of them had blocked off all of Huang Shuai’s paths of retreat even before they attacked, and the land quaked and rumbled under their overwhelming force.

The instant they attacked, a fluttering golden yellow cape emerged from Huang Shuai’s shoulders, and on the surface of the cape was an intimidating giant yellow dragon that looked very much alive. A resounding dragon roar reverberated in the air as its four claws reached out and tore the space that was locked down by Cang Xun and Di Shuang. Then, the giant dragon wrapped up Huang Shuai and escaped through the torn space.

Ei!

Cang Xun and Di Shuang were astonished as it had never occurred to either of them that Huang Shuai would be able to escape their two-layered locked space.

Looking at the escaping Huang Shuai, Cang Xun and Di Shuang bellowed as they attacked again, exuding supreme coercive pressure with a flip of their palms. Heaven and earth seemed to shrink in size, Huang Shuai immediately felt space tighten around him, restraining his movements, his dao soul, his bloodline, and the small world in his body, and he was unable to move.

Huang Shuai was startled and pushed the Huang Long Cape to the limit with cosmos energy, but his small world was restrained. How was he going to activate the Huang Long Cape?

If the Huang Long Cape’s speed advantage couldn’t be utilized, then he was no different than an ant in front of Cang Xun and Di Shuang.

Cang Xun’s palm enlarged rapidly as it pressed down above the crown of Huang Shuai’s head.

Mystical Pavilion experts scrambled to assist Huang Shuai’s escape, but their attempts were hindered by the other nine beast kings and nine overlords. They could barely take care of themselves, much less extend a hand to help Huang Shuai.

Cang Xun clenched his fist, and instantly, the space around Huang Shuai shattered, as well as the protective arrays around him. Finally, Huang Shuai was held up by Cang Xun.

Bright light rippled all over Huang Shuai as layers of runes appeared, and these runes contained terrifying power, which enabled Huang Shuai to break free from Cang Xun’s grip. In a flicker, Huang Shuai was fleeing again.

Both Cang Xun and Di Shuang were astonished.

They could tell that those runes were refined by a supreme expert for Huang Shuai. That expert had integrated the runes into Huang Shuai’s body, and they had become a part of Huang Shuai’s dao physique and dao soul. When Huang Shuai was in mortal danger, these runes would appear to save him.

Looking at Huang Shuai, who was on the run again, Cang Xun and Di Shuang snorted coldly and acted to capture Huang Shuai. Blinding rays of several thousand meters shone from their bodies. These rays of light turned into a sea of light with vengeful towering waves that swore to drown the land, and submerge the space Huang Shuai was in.

Bang!

Hit by the light waves, Huang Shuai plummeted from the air to the ground, and his robe was torn in various places. His armor had broken into pieces from the crash, leaving him almost completely and miserably naked. Fury was written all over Huang Shuai’s face.

In the next moment, Cang Xun and Di Shuang reached where Huang Shuai was.

Huang Shuai’s eyes were spewing fire as he glared at them. “You two lowly b*stards, since you’re bent on seeking death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Terrifying destructive energy surged from his body.

This destructive power was so overwhelming that Cang Xun and Di Shuang felt as if the air was robbed out of their lungs. Their faces paled, and at the same time, both shouted, “Retreat!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Both retreated in haste.

But the destructive power expanded faster than Cang Xun and Di Shuang’s speed, and they felt death breathing down their necks. In a moment of desperation, they roared and circulated every last strand of energy they could muster and attacked Huang Shuai.

But their effort was futile against the destructive power that was akin to the light of a firefly, trying to compete with the moon, and the gap was simply unbridgeable.

With their eyes widened in shock, they watched the destructive power swallow them.

At the very last moment, before Cang Xun and Di Shuang completely disappeared in the waves of destructive force, time and space came to a halt, and a radiant light flashed before their eyes. The next thing they knew was that they had escaped from being swallowed by the destructive force.

There was another person by their side, and it was none other than Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong rushed over after dealing with the Main Mystical Pavilion Master Huang Rong, and just as he arrived, he saw Cang Xun and Di Shuang in danger. Therefore, he quickly rescued them.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Huang Shuai stared in shock at Huang Xiaolong, who appeared in front of him, with a fleeting complicated gaze of jealousy, hatred, resentment, envy, and rage.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong was inwardly a little shocked by Huang Shuai’s strength. Huang Shuai was already a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable. Then again, he himself had advanced to the peak of late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm and comprehended thirteen elements of absolute powers. Therefore, it was nothing surprising that Huang Shuai’s cultivation had reached the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

Huang Shuai and the Main Mystical Pavilion Master Huang Rong were cousins from their fathers’ side. In their universe’s first-ranked family, the Huang Family, his status was higher than the Son of Mystic.

“Hand over the Huang Long Cape,” Huang Xiaolong stated directly as he had no interest in reminiscing the old days with Huang Shuai.

Huang Shuai’s face became distorted, and he snorted, “Huang Xiaolong, do you think that you’ve won?”

“At least, it doesn’t seem you have a chance to escape in this situation,” Huang Xiaolong pointed out indifferently. His attention was locked on Huang Shuai and Huang Rong. Other Mystical Pavilion experts could escape, but not Huang Shuai and Huang Rong. Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t permit it!

If these two people escaped, the behemoth family behind them would be a disaster for Huang Xiaolong in the days to come.

Huang Shuai chortled when he heard that, and with a twisted expression, he sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, with the protective runes talisman my father has refined for me, you wouldn’t be able to break it unless you have achieved perfection in the thirteen elements. What can you do to me then?!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong snickered, “Your protective runes talisman is indeed amazing, but how many times can it protect you? Don’t tell me that these runes’ power is endless!”

Even a God of Creation couldn’t refine a protective talisman with unlimited usage.

Huang Shuai’s face turned extremely gloomy.

Right at this time, Huang Rong appeared beside Huang Shuai with one hand gripping Huang Shuai’s shoulder as he tried to take him away, but would Huang Xiaolong let them escape? The two of them barely moved an inch when Huang Xiaolong transformed into a dragon of creation. His four claws flexed, locking the immediate surroundings and refining the space!

Space melted like iron!

Space was an intangible existence, but now, it was being melted as if it was a solid entity!

Huang Shuai and Huang Rong crashed to the ground.

Upon seeing this, Huang Xiaolong’s four claws slammed down and just as his attack was about to hit Huang Shuai and Huang Rong, Huang Rong suddenly let out a resounding dragon’s roar. Blinding golden light burst out from his body as an enormous golden yellow dragon appeared behind him.

“This is?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

Huang long Bloodline?!

Huang Rong also possesses the Huang Long Bloodline? Although the bloodline’s purity couldn’t be compared to him, it was certainly the same Huang Long Bloodline as him.

Whilst Huang Xiaolong was still in shock, Huang Rong also transformed into a dragon of creation in a flash.
