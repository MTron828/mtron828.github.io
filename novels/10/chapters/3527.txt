Chapter 3528: Creation Palace

 

When Wang Xinming thought of the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor, he felt the world crumbling around him.

After all, the Trickling Scarlet Celestial Emperor was akin to a god in the Trickling Scarlet World.

“You… You killed him?!” Wang Dongcheng snapped back to reality and looked at Huang Xiaolong. Since he didn’t know who made the move, he pinned the blame on Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring the man, Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce. Wang Xinming followed closely behind in a daze.

His mind couldn’t stop buzzing.

When Wang Dongcheng saw that Huang Xiaolong and the others had ignored him, his expression sank. Gripping his fists tightly, he glared at their leaving figures. However, he chose not to make a move in the end.

He might be a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, but he knew that he wasn’t their match. He didn’t even understand how Wang Quan died!

“Lord Wang Dongcheng, what do we do about Lord Wang Quan?” an expert of the Wang Family asked.

With his face turning gloomy, Wang Dongcheng growled, “Bring his corpse back to the Wang Family and make the report. I’ll go in and keep an eye on them!”

“Yes, Lord Wang Dongcheng!” The disciples of the Wang Family did as they were told, and they brought the corpse back. Wand Dongcheng brought several experts along with him to the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce.

Even before Wang Quan’s corpse returned, Wang Qianchang, a grand elder of the Wang Family and Wang Quan’s father, learned of his death. When he heard the news, killing intent filled his heart, and he roared, “Fantasy Butterfly Race, I’ll exterminate your race to accompany my son in hell!”

His voice boomed through the Wang Family Manor.

The higher-ups of the Wang Family were equally as shocked by Wang Quan’s sudden death.

After all, they didn’t believe that the Fantasy Butterfly Race had the guts to kill a core disciple of their family.

When the grand elders of the Wang Family learned that Wang Qianchang wanted to kill his way over to the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce, they stopped him. After all, the patriarch was away, and they should investigate the matter before making any moves. Wang Qianchang roared in anger, “It’s not your son who was killed! Why do I need the patriarch’s permission to take revenge?! If you insist on stopping me, then don’t blame me for what happens next!” After speaking, he charged into the skies and disappeared.

The grand elders could only shake their heads helplessly.

“From what Wang Dongcheng reported, there’s a lady among them and Wang Xinming called her the Lord Ancestor of the Fantasy Butterfly Race.” One of the grand elders frowned. “When did the Fantasy Butterfly Race gain a new ancestor?!”

“From what I can tell, you’re too cautious. The Fantasy Butterfly Race is nothing! Even if she’s their ancestor, she can’t be too strong. Not even the world master dares to oppose us. Why would our Wang Family be afraid of a small race like that?”

“Whatever the case, we need to look into her identity.”

…

When that went down, Huang Xiaolong and the others had already entered the grand hall of the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce. 

“I wonder what you wish to purchase?” one of the managers approached them and asked courteously.

The manager of the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce branch in the Six Dao Holy World was an expert at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. He learned about the matter at the entrance, and he was exceptionally polite to Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

Not even super experts who came to the branch would receive such attention from him.

“Get the highest authority of your branch out here,” Ao Shenghai spoke.

A frown formed on the manager’s face as he didn’t expect them to be so overbearing.

The director of their branch was an expert who had comprehended ten elements. Not even the princes of the world master’s manor would be able to meet him. Only the world master had the honor of seeing the branch director.

“I wonder what you’re looking for… I can make all the decisions around here.” The manager, Huang Pa, continued, “The director is out at the moment.” 

Everyone could hear the displeasure he felt.

Ao Shenghai tossed over a spiritual herb the moment the manager was done speaking.

As soon as the herb appeared, the entire hall was filled with grand dao qi. 

The experts in the hall were shocked by the sudden influx of grand dao qi, and they stared at Ao Shenghai in shock.

“This… This is a peak-grade grand dao herb!” someone in the crowd screamed.

Wang Dongcheng, who was in charge of keeping tabs on Huang Xiaolong’s group, couldn’t help but gasp in fright. They might be able to see grand dao herbs in the great auctions, but those were low-grade herbs! They hadn’t seen a high-grade herb since god knows when, much less a peak-grade grand dao herb!Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Seeing the blank look on Huang Pa’s face, Ao Shenghai sneered, “We still have a lot of these. If your director isn’t here, we’ll come again another day.”

Huang Pa jumped in fright the moment he heard what Ao Shenghai said. “Wait! Wait! Lords, please hold on a moment. Our director has always been in the area, and I’ll make the report right now! Please give me a minute.” As soon as he spoke, he ran off to make the report. He completely forgot about the excuse he gave.

Huang Xiaolong was completely indifferent. After all, he had long discovered the presence of their director.

The director of the branch quickly appeared before Huang Xiaolong and the others before inviting them into the inner hall for a chat.

Wang Dongcheng’s expression turned sullen when he saw the respectful look on the branch director’s face.

…

Eventually, Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain several trillion dao coins. Initially, Huang Xiaolong planned on selling some treasures to get ten trillion dao coins, but the Fire and Ice Chamber of Commerce branch couldn’t move so much cash in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong managed to learn some things about the First Universe from the branch director. There were more than three hundred worlds in the First Universe!

There were more than a thousand Gods of Creation, and the discovery caused them to jump in fright.

The information they obtained from Ao Xing and Ao Meixia was too far off compared to the information they obtained from the branch director! It seemed as though Ao Xing and his wife weren’t too familiar with the First Universe.

With the Creation Palace as the strongest power among them, they managed to gather more than three hundred Gods of Creation under their banner!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank a little when he heard the number.

The Creation Palace’s strength had already exceeded his imaginations. They had more than twenty experts at the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, and that didn’t include the four palace masters!

“Your Highness, I had no idea they were so strong!” Wang Meiqi muttered. The revelation of strength caused a massive weight to bear down on her heart.

“It’s fine.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and sighed, “When I enter the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, we won’t be afraid of them.”

Just as they were about to leave, an enraged cry filled the skies. “Wang Xinming, get out here right now!”

Grand Elder Wang Qianchang finally arrived.
