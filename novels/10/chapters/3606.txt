Chapter 3607 – Treasure Map

When they thought of the possibility, their breaths started to quicken.

That was the level of a supreme overlord!

He would be a peak-level existence in the Unknown Space!

Even though half step Universe Gods were known as the strongest existences in the God of Creation Realm, they knew that they were merely ants in the face of such terrifying experts. At best, they were slightly bigger ants.

No matter how big an ant was, it was just an ant.

Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun thought about what Huang Xiaolong said to Ying Ze earlier, and they realized that Ying Ze, Ying Wan, and Ying Wuyou basically possessed the same level of threat to him. They were nothing more than specks of dust he could get rid of whenever he wanted!

To supreme overlords, that was indeed the case.

Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun who were hesitating started to feel their hearts calming down when they thought of the possibility of Huang Xiaolong being a supreme overlord.

Eventually choosing to live, they chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong. They released their defenses around their dao souls and allowed him to lay down a soul brand.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t shatter the Limitless Master’s restrictions when he did his thing. Instead, he laid down another restriction that hid his control over the two.

With that being the case, he would be able to control the two of them without the Limitless Master discovering anything off.

With his current strength he didn’t wish to clash head on with the Limitless Master. After all, he only had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

He didn’t stop there. He laid down restrictions in the dao souls of those from the Yin Yang Celestial Empire. He used the same method to hide his actions from the Limitless Master.

The ancestors and patriarchs of the great families in the celestial empire were completely ignored by Huang Xiaolong. He wasn’t worried that they would spread the news of what happened as Lin Qiankun and the others would take care of it.

After Lin Qiankun submitted, he quickly retrieved the universe-level spiritual veins from the treasury.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a stingy person, and he allowed Lin Qiankun to pick a top-grade creation artifact. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Lin Qiankun saw Huang Xiaolong bringing out more than ten top-grade creation artifacts, he was shocked. Chen Huanzhi and the other God of Creation Realm experts were equally as stunned.

Eventually, Lin Qiankun chose Kai Dong’s weapon.

Chen Huanzhi and the others quickly retrieved their universe-level spiritual veins when they learned that Huang Xiaolong was no miser.

As someone who had broken through the 10 billion units mark, Chen Huanzhi was also a marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire. His net worth was definitely comparable to Lin Qiankun, and Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when he saw more than thirty spiritual veins sitting before him.

As for the others, they took out whatever they had.

Huang Xiaolong counted sixty-three universe-level spiritual veins in total.

It was an unexpected surprise, and Huang Xiaolong wasn’t complaining.

Initially, he thought that he would only be able to obtain the spiritual veins Lin Qiankun put up for trade. Now, he managed to obtain more than three times the amount!

Huang Xiaolong gave Chen Huanzhi ten leaves from the Star Dragon Divine Tree. They were much more precious compared to the Star Dragon Scales and they were useful to experts at his level.

Chen Huanzhi bowed profusely when he received the treasures.

Huang Xiaolong soon asked Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun about the matter of the ocean beasts’ attack.

Lin Qiankun looked at Chen Huanzhi as the latter was a marshal of the Limitless Celestial Empire. Chen Huanzhi knew much more than him.

Chen Huanzhi replied respectfully, “The Limitless Prince stole the Yin Yang Treasure Map from the Hydra Fish Race. It’s said that one will be able to locate the Yin Yang Flame Wheel if they manage to decipher the location!”

“Oh?!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

Lin Qiankun and the others were equally as shocked.

Even though the map was stolen, no one knew what treasure it led to. They didn’t know that it was the Yin Yang Flame Wheel and it was the first time they were hearing about it.

“That’s right.” Chen Huanzhi nodded. “The Limitless Prince and the Limitless Master have been trying to figure out the location of the treasure, but to no avail.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

The Limitless Master had more than a hundred sons, and the Limitless Prince was the youngest son in the family. He was the son the Limitless Master doted on the most.

“How strong is the Limitless Prince?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“His strength crossed the 10 billion mark a long time ago, and he has two great worlds. I’m no match for him.” Chen Huanzhi’s expression turned serious. “There are many people who speculate that he crossed the 12 billion mark.”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised. After all, Zhu Qiming had already crossed the 14 billion units mark. It was normal for the Limitless Prince to reach the 12 billion units mark

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about the strength of the Limitless Celestial Emperor.

The Limitless Celestial Emperor was the oldest son of the Limitless Master, and he was equally as competent.

“His Majesty is a little stronger than the Limitless Prince. After all, he cultivated for a much longer time!” Chen Huanzhi replied, “His Majesty’s talent is second only to the prince..”

Out of all the sons the Limitless Master had, the Limitless Prince boasted the highest talent. The Limitless Celestial Emperor was slightly worse.

Half a day later…

Chen Huanzhi and the others left before Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion. With the spiritual veins he obtained this time, he would be able to sustain his cultivation for more than several hundred thousand years!

Universe source qi gushed out from the eye of the formation, and Huang Xiaolong sat in the middle of the space quietly.

Circulating the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art, the universe source qi poured into his body.

When Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion, the battle between the Ocean Race and the humans became more intense. They were at the cusp of breaking out into a full blown war with the Limitless Celestial Empire. Experts from the other regions charged into the Limitless Lands when they received news that the Yin Yang Treasure Map was stolen by the Limitless Prince. Naturally, they didn’t come to assist the Limitless Celestial Empire. All of them had their eyes on the treasure map.

As more and more people poured into the Limitless Land, a storm started to brew.
