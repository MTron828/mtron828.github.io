Chapter 2940: Celebration

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and the light around his body gradually disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong commanded Zeng Lei and the others to stop while he inspected his inner body. After close to a year of cultivation and refinement, Huang Xiaolong realized that his inner world had expanded again. His cosmos energy was flowing endlessly. His small worlds were starting to take shape.

His three dao souls, twelve Saint Fates, and inextinguishable dao heart had advanced a lot.

Without doubt, the most obvious change was still the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth. If his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth gave him the power to destroy ten sacred lands before, he would be able to shatter thirty of them with the same punch!

Huang Xiaolong emerged from the the Sun Moon Furnace and was delighted to observe the change that happened to it. He slowly reached out and the gigantic pill furnace shrunk to fit in the palm of his hand.

Within a year, he refined thirty strands of beginning qi because of his Huang Long Bloodline. Of course, the Sun Moon Furnace and the cosmos energy of the other experts played a part.

“Once the ascension ceremony ends, I will completely refine the pull furnace!” Huang Xiaolong pondered. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The moment he gained complete control over the pill furnace, the effects of his cultivation would increase by a huge amount!

He would be able to subdue even more beasts then.

He felt that the cosmos energy from those outside was lacking slightly. According his estimation, the Sun Moon Furnace would be able to withstand the cosmos energy of a thousand high-level Dao Venerables.

If a thousand high level Dao Venerable experts used their cosmos energy to assist in his cultivation, how terrifying would that be?!

Of course, it was impossible for a single individual to control a thousand high-level Dao Venerables to give away their cosmos energy. However, Huang Xiaolong had the Huang Long Bloodline to control them and it was certainly a possibility.

No matter how unwilling Zeng Lei and the others were, they still had to obey his will.

Keeping the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong quickly appeared in the outside world.

As for the pills he had and the seven drops of Huang Long Blood Essence left over, they would have to wait until the end of the ceremony.

Less than ten days remained till the ceremony.

“Experts from everywhere should be present….” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Zhang Wen, Chen Shaoen, and Shi Chuan who were guarding the space outside were dumbstruck when Huang Xiaolong emerged. Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong supposed to be dealt with by the branch master?! What was he doing out there? Soon, they saw Zeng Lei following behind Huang Xiaolong like an obedient servant.

What in the world?!

“Master Zeng Lei, Huang Xiaolong he...?” Chen Shaoen stepped forward and asked cautiously.

Just as he spoke, he was slapped harshly by someone. Zeng Lei’s palm was firmly impritned into Chen Shaoen’s face.

The slap was so hard that Chen Shaoen flew out.

Zhang Wen and the others were startled.

“How dare you call His Highness by his name?!” Zeng Lei lashed out coldly.

His Highness?! Zhang Wen, Shi Chuan, and a few others were dumbfounded. Your Highness? They looked towards Huang Xiaolong. Could it be?

Chen Shaoen crawled up from the ground and his head spun around in confusion. He had no idea why Zeng Lei slapped him. Once again, he pointed at Huang Xiaolong and yelled, “Branch Master Zeng Lei, Huang Xiaolong…” The moment the words left his lips, he was slapped twice by Zeng Lei.

“What the f*ck is wrong with you?! How dare you call His Highness directly by his name!” Zeng Lei seethed with murderous eyes.

Zhang Wen and the others sucked in a cold breath. They looked at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

They didn’t know if Zeng Lei was actually delusional, but now it seemed as though he was serious.

His Highness?

What in the world?!

Several people were dumbfounded.

A terrifying thought flashed through their minds. Huang Xiaolong was the son of the Mystical Pavilion’s Main Pavilion Master!

Yes, only the son of the main pavilion master would be shown such respect by Zeng Lei!

Zhang Wen started to panic and he quickly bowed respectfully, “Greetings Your Highness, Zhang Wen did not know of your identity before. If I have offended you, please pardon me.”

Shi Chuan and the others reacted one after another and all of them bowed towards Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, but he soon realized what was going on.

Allowing them to get up, the golden dragon appeared behind him without any warning.

Zhang Wen and the others felt their jaws dropping in fright.

It didn’t take long for them to kneel before Huang Xiaolong. When everything was done, he asked them about the events that took place while he was cultivating.

When he heard that the ten great creeds and Huang Shuai had joined hands to pass down an order for his capture, a sinister smile formed on his face. However, when he heard that Huang Shuai had given the order to capture Long Jianfei and the others, his face sank.

“Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and the others are trapped in the Dragon Fish Creed. They are tortured by hundreds of kinds of soul torturing devices every day and Huang Shuai said that if Your Highness fail to show up for the ceremony, he will kill them and destroy their dao souls!” Zhang Wen continued.

He also spoke about the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin.

They were slowly being tamed by Huang Shuai, and as for the Boundary Emperor and the others, they were locked up in the dungeon. They were treated much better than Long Jianfei and the others as Huang Shuai was a little hesitant to deal with the Di Bai. As a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable the torture methods were useless against him.

“Huang Shuai, you are courting death!” Huang Xiaolong growled. Killing intent leaked out from his body and Zeng Lei and the others fell to their knees. They felt as though they had fallen into the depths of hell.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong charged into the air as he turned into a streak of light that headed straight towards the Dragon Fish Dao Creed.

He didn’t bring Zeng Lei and the others as he didn’t wish to expose his relationship. Only the six Dao Venerable Realm beasts followed him. He didn’t expect them to come in handy and they were there for appearance sake. After all, he was going to face the ten great creed!

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Dragon Fish Creed headquarters.

Dao runes filled the skies and an air of festivity could be felt!

The Dragon Fish City was decorated with lanterns and coloured banners. All kinds of rare grand Dde seen chatting with each other!

It was a celebration!
