2 trillion!

More cultivators fainted here and there on the square.

They couldn’t even begin to comprehend the magnitude of one trillion.

In the history of the four galaxies, there had yet to be any auction house able to procure an item worth 2 trillion. Forget about 2 trillion, they didn’t even have an item reaching the 1 trillion mark.

A sum of 2 trillion was way beyond their imagination. Still, some Ancestors and Patriarchs could imagine the sight of 200 billion.

200 billion falling down from the sky could turn the sea into land! It could completely submerge a large city, piling up high into a mountain over a thousand zhang tall.

Inside private room one, the Azure Dragon Institute Principal Qin Yi instructed a disciple behind him, “Investigate who’s inside private room twelve.”

The disciples acknowledged respectfully and left the room.

Similar scenes were taking place in other private rooms. All the present super forces were curious about he identity of the guest in private room twelve.

Whereas in private room two, Yang Yi was worried, “I don’t think that little Huang boy can take out 2 trillion, right? That godhead fragment is going to fall into the hands of whoever is in private room twelve!”

The Ascending Moon Old Man remained silent.

It hadn’t crossed his mind that this godhead fragment would be hiked to such a whopping 2 trillion! Even though he had accumulated some savings in the last several ten-thousand years, he only had 600 billion on him.

“2 trillion, private room twelve bid 2 trillion!” While everyone in the square had yet to recover from the multiple blows to their hearts, the auctioneer’s voice rang out loudly, albeit it was shaking slightly as he asked, “An~yone bi~~dding highe~r?” It sounded more like the auctioneer was bleating like a sheep rather than speaking. Thankfully, everyone present had commendable hearing, able to make out what the auctioneer was saying.

The truth is, when the White Tiger Institute Principal decided to take out the godhead fragment for auction, he estimated that it could fetch 600 billion at most. But now, the price had reached an earth-shaking 2 trillion!

This sum was more than thrice the amount he expected.

Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong almost at the same time, wondering if he would bid a higher price.

However, Huang Xiaolong sat there indifferently, it didn’t seem like he was going to speak. Seeing this, there was a collective sense of disappointment.

“Private room twelve bids 2 trillion! Anyone bidding higher?!” Every time he said 2 trillion, his voice involuntarily shook.

The auctioneer looked around the square, his gaze falling on Huang Xiaolong more often than not.

Just as he raised his wooden hammer and was about to declare the successful bidder, the indifferent Huang Xiaolong suddenly called out: “5 trillion!”

5 trillion—

This sum was like a spell cast over the people in the square. Everyone forgot to breathe, as if time stopped while their mouths were agape, staring at Huang Xiaolong. No one made a move, not even a finger. No one spoke, not even the lowest whisper, after all, these people already forgot to breathe...

Within private room number twelve, that young man Mirage King jumped to his feet. Even though the mysterious light glow still shrouded his features, causing the others in the room to be unable to see his expression, from the chilling killing intent exuding from his body they could somehow image his expression.

Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Na, and the others also had an ugly expression on their faces, jumping to their feet with obvious fear in their eyes.

The twenty-eight Highgod Realm masters inside the room daren’t make a sound.

Because, all the wealth they had on them added together, the wealth of all twenty-eight Highgod Realm masters, was only 5 trillion! This was the limit of what they managed to gather. And Huang Xiaolong’s bid was exactly 5 trillion! Not one coin more, not one coin less.

Most importantly, they couldn’t afford to take out even 1 billion more. The auctioneer had mentioned this at the beginning, the increment from the last bid offered should be a minimum of one billion.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong paid more than sixty thousand top divine grade spirit stones and succeeded in obtaining the Heavenly God’s godhead fragment.

Watching Huang Xiaolong receive the godhead fragment from the auctioneer’s hand, the Mirage King’s chilling voice sounded as if it came from the abyss of hell, “We must not allow Huang Xiaolong to leave this Firmament Divinity Mainland!!”

Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Na, and the oher Highgod Realm masters present were stunned, but quickly reacted, acknowledging respectfully.

The auction ended with the attendees feeling shocked, exhilarated, and fired up as they left.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of four left with many gazes following them.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left the auction square he received a message from the Ascending Moon Old Man, thus he didn’t return to the inn. Together with Shi Xiaofei, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen, the four of them arrived at a courtyard on the south side of White Tiger City, where the old man and Yang Yi were waiting.

“You brat, I didn’t see you for so many years, but just as you appeared today, you nearly frightened this old man to death.” The moment he saw Huang Xiaolong, the old man complained.

Shi Xiaofei cheerfully stepped forward, greeting her Master and Senior Ascending Moon. Both Liu Yun and Qi Wen hurried to greet the seniors.

Yang Yi was full of smiles as she pulled Shi Xiaofei to her side while chiding the Ascending Moon Old Man, “I say, it isn’t that you were nearly frightened to death, but overjoyed to death. If it weren’t for your precious disciple, would you even have the chance to touch that godhead fragment?”

The Ascending Moon Old Man grinned sheepishly, slapping Huang Xiaolong’s back, “You brat, your performance in the auction house just now wasn’t bad, domineering all the way, exactly like your Master!”

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes at the old man.

Shi Xiaofei, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen laughed secretly at the side.

Huang Xiaolong took out the godhead fragment and handed it to the Ascending Moon Old Man, “Old man, take this godhead fragment for now. Also, bring Xiaofei and them back.”

Now that Huang Xiaolong had become a target, he naturally wouldn’t keep Shi Xiaofei by his side. That would be too dangerous.

The Ascending Moon Old Man and the others understood the underlying meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words.

“No, Big brother Huang, I want to stay with you.” Shi Xiaofei blurted out in worry.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “You don’t need to worry about me. Listen to me and return with Master and the rest to Martial Spirit World. I need to make a trip to the Devil Domain Mainland.”

Hearing that Huang Xiaolong would be going to the Devil Domain Mainland, everyone was surprised.

“Brat, you’re going to the Devil Domain Mainland? There are countless devil sects there, and these devil cultivators are savage and filled with bloodlust. Even I don’t dare to enter recklessly.” The Ascending Moon Old Man persuaded.

Huang Xiaolong stated, “I need to go there to search for something.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man, Yang Yi, and the others persuaded again, however, Huang Xiaolong already made his decision, he had to get the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s last sealed body part. Only this way would his Soul Devouring Physique be completed.

Which was why, despite the dangers of the Devil Domain Mainland, he must go. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, he had the true immortal essence force that allowed him to change his appearance, hence he wasn’t worried about what would come after.

In the end, under Huang Xiaolong’s coaxing, Shi Xiaofei obediently left with the old man and Yang Yi, leaving the godhead fragment with the Ascending Moon Old Man.

Huang Xiaolong planned to find the last part of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s body, and then the White Tiger Divine Fire. He didn’t have the time to study the godhead fragment, thus it was better to leave it with the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi for the time being.

It would be more appropriate for him to study it after he stepped into the Highgod Realm, when he had his own God’s Law.

After Shi Xiaofei left with the Ascending Moon Old Man, Yang Yi, and the others, Huang Xiaolong stayed in that yard for half a month. Half a month later, he discreetly altered his appearance and physical features, turning into a rough and brawny middle-aged man. Without alerting anyone, Huang Xiaolong left the Firmament Divinity Mainland despite the many blockades of the various forces.

Six days later, the space above the White Tiger Galaxy’s Devil Domain Mainland rippled as a figure walked out from the void. This figure was none other than Huang Xiaolong, who had quietly left the Firmament Divinity Mainland.
