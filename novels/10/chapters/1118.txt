Detecting the group from the Four Seas Trading House tailing him, Huang Xiaolong frowned in displeasure.

“Master, let me out to release a few lightning farts and kill those few sons o’ b*tches.” The little cow who was within the Xumi Temple clamored, stamping its front hooves on the floor.

Huang Xiaolong was speechless, scolding softly, “Little girl should be more refined when speaking.”

Xiaoniū responded with several cold harrumphs and said, “Who says I’m a little girl? I’m the number one invincible super cow between this heaven and earth.”

Huang Xiaolong stifled.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t stand the little cow’s nonstop nagging and released it from the Godly Mt. Xumi.

Well, he was planning to deal with the people from the Four Seas Trading House anyways, having them buzzing around him like a group of flies was slightly inconvenient.

The moment Xiaoniū was released, its four hooves stretched out, loosening its stiff muscles, even doing some stretching postures with a high difficulty level.

After a few popping sounds and puffs of lightning qi, the little cow groaned comfortably, ’So nice!’

“Master, can I discuss something with you?” The little cow asked feebly.

“No.” Huang Xiaolong bluntly refused without listening. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Its eyes protruded in shock and pain.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, he could guess what the little cow was plotting; what it wanted to discuss was none other than not returning to the Xumi Temple.

By this time, the Four Seas Trading House group had caught up, but they were slightly startled when they saw that Huang Xiaolong had stopped moving. Therefore they too stopped and hid, observing from a distance.

They thought Huang Xiaolong hadn’t discovered them yet.

They couldn’t be blamed for thinking so, for their cultivation of Eighth Order Heavenly God Realm was stronger than the ordinary mid-Sixth Order cultivator, a weaker cultivator being unable to detect their presence was matter-of-fact.

The little cow was fuming with anger at this moment sensing the group of mice hiding in the distance. Them thinking that Xiaoniū and Huang Xiaolong still hadn’t noticed them intensified its anger.

The little cow suddenly tilted its head upward, mouth wide opened and roared.

As its roar rippled in the water, numerous lightning streaks emerged, forming a giant lightning beam that shot straight at where the Four Seas Trading House people were hiding.

Great currents appeared in the sea, creating a violent whirlpool that affected an area of ten thousand li.

The lightning beam was too bright and too fast that the Four Seas Trading House group fell into astonishment and despair at the same time. In the next second, they were swallowed up by the lightning beam, annihilated.

First, it was their defensive robe turning into fragments, followed by the explosion of their flesh and blood. Finally, their godheads were burnt into gray ash, scattered away with the current.

The lightning beam continued forward even after burning through the people from the Four Seas Trading House, splitting the seawater into two sides and raising great waves on the sea surface.

Even the Punishing Heaven City was affected, shaking slightly from the shockwaves.

Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted at the little cow’s lethal attack.

Xiaoniū turned its head back and grinned at Huang Xiaolong’s flabbergasted expression, “This move is called Invincible Heaven Destroying Giant Cannon! It’s amazing, right?”

Although Xiaoniū’s puffed up expression triggered a temporary violent impulse in Huang Xiaolong, he still nodded, admitting that the move just now was indeed amazing.

The little cow harrumphed proudly, “In the past, I used this trick to blow up the SoulSoul World!”

Huang Xiaolong looked thunderstruck, ’Blew up the Souls World!?’ Hell’s Soul World was a higher realm, just like the Divine World. Huang Xiaolong doubted that even the Divine World’s current most powerful cultivator would be able to blow up the Soul World...

“When did you go to the Soul World?” Huang Xiaolong asked in bewilderment.

Ever since Xiaoniū hatched from that egg, it had always been at his side, and he knew very well the extent of this little cow’s current strength.

Could Xiaoniū be the reincarnation of a grandmist divine beast that was now slowly recovering its past memories?

“That’s something from a long long time ago.” The little cow in low voice, reminiscing the past.

“Let’s leave this place first.” Sensing quite a few strong auras rushing towards their direction from Punishing Heaven City, Huang Xiaolong said to the little cow and leaped onto its back, speeding away from the scene.

Moments after Huang Xiaolong and the little cow disappeared, experts from various sea tribes arrived consecutively.

When they arrived and saw the colossal rift at the bottom of the sea that wasn’t there before, each of them sucked in a breath of cold air.

This rift was caused by the shattering effect of Xiaoniū’s Invincible Heaven Destroying Giant Cannon scraping over the seabed. Tiny streaks of lightning crackled from the earth below.

While these sea tribe experts lamented at the appalling rift created by the little cow, the two responsible for this scene were already several thousand li away.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong did not send the little cow back into the Xumi Temple.

After all, there could be a multitude of things for which he would need to rely on this ‘number one invincible super cow in this heaven and earth’, he couldn’t make it feel depressed...

The little cow knew a chaos grade transformation technique, and even though it couldn’t completely alter its physical appearance like Huang Xiaolong, looking like a sea beast wasn’t a problem. Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see any flaws.

The little cow chose to disguise itself as a Metal Carapace Searhino.

The Soul Tribe was one of the more powerful tribes in the Endless Sea, having generations of soul force cultivators that could kill with an invisible knife. It was a tribe that other sea tribes were unwilling to provoke. However, the Soul Tribe members were physically weak compared to other sea tribes; they were also thinner and taller than the average humans, their height ranging from two to three meters.

Although the Soul Tribe was one of the sea tribes, they did not live at the bottom of the Endless Sea like the rest. Instead, they built their cities on a secluded archipelago.

This archipelago consisted of twenty-odd islands that were almost side to side; no one knew whether it was man-made or naturally so.

However, every single one of these islands was bigger than Green Cloud Island. Even a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm master would be at their wit’s end trying to move these islands.

These twenty-odd islands formed the Soul Islands.

A little over a month later, on this particular day, Huang Xiaolong and Xiaoniū’s figures emerged from the void in the air above the Soul Islands.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong had already altered his physical appearance to resemble a Soul Tribe member. He was now over two meters tall, abnormally thin, and had long pointed ears. Huang Xiaolong’s current looks could be considered quite handsome.

After they appeared, he looked at the twenty-odd islands below and flew toward the centermost island.

This was known as the main island, where the Soul Tribe’s treasury was located.

A short while later, he and Xiaoniū descended on a high mountain peak. As Huang Xiaolong had altered his appearance earlier on, despite coming across a few Soul Tribe experts, he was neither suspected nor questioned.

The little cow looked around and said, “This should be the main island’s northern Shredding Wind Mountain. Not far from here is the Soul Tribe’s main settlement.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

This Shredding Wind Mountain was extremely famous among the Soul Tribe.

The reason for this was that all wind that arrived at this mountain would vanish without a trace as if it was shredded by a giant hand.

No one had been able to solve this strange phenomenon.

“There’s something sealed inside the belly of this Shredding Wind Mountain.” The little cow said suddenly.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow, could this be the reason why the wind never got past this mountain?

“Can you go in?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow pondered the possibility and answered, “I can, but I’ll have to wait until I break through to the Ancient God Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong felt as if someone just burst his happy bubble, feeling a strong urge to beat up the little cow. What’s the use of saying pointless words?
