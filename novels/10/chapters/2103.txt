Chapter 2104: Wan Shi Leaves Seclusion!

Huang Xiaolong!

The last remaining member felt a bomb going off in his head.

Even after a long time after Huang Xiaolong’s departure, he failed to return to his senses.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others left, they didn’t remain in the Borderless City for too long. They quickly left and charged towards the north. The only thing he had to do was to look for a secluded spot to refine the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele, just like he had done with the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus.

As for Sui Wenhui and the old steward, they made their way to the Skull Devil Sect’s headquarters after Huang Xiaolong left.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong’s group stopped in the space above a deep abyss.

“This should be the spot...” Huang Xiaolong looked into the bottomless abyss and muttered.

It was extremely secluded, and it was also unlikely for anyone to discover his chosen spot. It was an excellent choice for a location to go into seclusion.

Since Huang Xiaolong had already decided on the place, the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python had no objections.

The four of them quickly descended as they hastily set up individual spaces and defensive formations all around. It was the same as before when Huang Xiaolong had refined the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus.

When Huang Xiaolong finally entered the space he created, he crossed his leg and sat down in the middle of the air before retrieving the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele. He sucked in a cold breath when he thought about what the last devil stele signified. Even though it was far too lacking when compared to the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus, Huang Xiaolong knew that he would be able to obtain the energy straight from the source of the Devil World! He would immediately take over the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s position!

Soon after, he would be able to unify the Devil World!

No one would be able to remain calm if they knew that they would be able to take over a world soon!

Huang Xiaolong eventually suppressed the excitement in his heart as he summoned the Glaze Devil Stele, Myriad Curses Devil Stele, Blood Eye Devil Stele, Imperial Beast Devil Stele, and the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

All six devil steles hovered in the air, and Huang Xiaolong quickly started to circulate his Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

A brilliant light emerged from the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele as a pillar of devil light, terrifying beyond belief, shot towards the heavens. The original darkness energy of the Devil World poured through the void.

Light quickly shot out from the other five devil steles, and every single one revolved around Huang Xiaolong.

.....

“What?! Huang Xiaolong might have obtained the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele?!” Wan Yue listened to a report in the main hall of the All-Heavens Divine Palace, and his face sank.

Yang Gang didn’t dare to lie, and he quickly reported everything he knew. “From our intelligence network in the Devil World, Huang Xiaolong obtained a stone tablet in one of the manors in the Borderless City. The stone tablet should be the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele!”

Wan Yue’s eyes narrowed as frosty light flashed in them.

“Lord Wan Yue, please be at ease. Even if Huang Xiaolong manages to obtain the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele, it doesn’t mean anything.” Yang Gang continued, “He won’t have the time to refine it! Even if he manages to refine it in several years and become the successor of the Heavenless Archdevil Lord, Lord Wan Shi will be able to crush him with a pinky!”

Yang Gang quickly broke out into laughter, “If that were to happen, Huang Xiaolong would be the shortest-lived leader of the Devil World! He’ll be the joke of an era!”

Wan Yue sneered when he heard what Yang Gang said, “You’re right. So what if Huang Xiaolong manages to succeed the Heavenless Archdevil Lord?! He won’t be able to live for long anyway. In the future, all six devil steles, the Ancient Heavenly Court, the Radiance Divine Scepter, Nine Yin Magic Mirror, and all of his treasures will belong to our All-Heavens City! We need to thank Huang Xiaolong for gathering all six devil steles for us!”

Six years quickly passed by...

In the depths of one of the spaces in the City of All-Heavens, space started to fluctuate, and rays of brilliant light shot into the heavens. In an instant, a terrifying aura enveloped the city.

Even existences like Old Monster Lun Zhuan, the Old Crow Ancestor, the King of Shadows, Shi Zhen, and other super experts found it hard to breathe.

“This?!” Wan Yue revealed an expression of joy when he felt the familiar aura.

“Lord Father! Lord Father is about to leave seclusion!” Wan Yue yelled excitedly.

When the overlords in the main hall heard what he said, they sucked in a cold breath. Lord Wan Shi was about to exit seclusion!

Everyone got over their shock in a matter of seconds before revealing a joyous expression.

They had been waiting for a long time for Lord Wan Shi to emerge from his secluded cultivation!

For several years, they had awaited the day Lord Wan Shi would take revenge for them!

“Hahaha! Now that Lord Wan Shi has emerged, it’s time for Huang Xiaolong to die!” Old Monster Lun Zhuan roared with laughter.

“Let’s go! Everyone, follow me to welcome my father from seclusion!” Wan Yue got to his feet with barely concealed joy on his face.

He quickly led everyone out of the main hall, and they made their way towards the secret space Lord Wan Shi had created.

Before they could even approach the secret space, a horrifying might repelled them. Wan Yue, Lun Zhuan, the Old Crow Ancestor, the King of Shadows, and Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen had to work together in order to resist the pressure.

Even after working together, they barely managed to fend it off.

A look of shock appeared in their eyes.

A massive figure shrouded in light suddenly shot into the skies.

When Wan Yue saw the familiar figure, he hastily stepped forward to pay his respects. “Wan Yue greets Lord Father!”

It went without a doubt that the person who had just appeared was the only known high-level Sovereign, Wan Shi!

Even the faint glow around his face couldn’t hide his eyes that twinkled like stars in the night sky. They emitted rays of resplendent light, and it was as though nothing could hide from his sight.

“Lun Zhuan, Old Crow, Shi Zhen... We greet Lord Wan Shi! Lord Wan Shi is the ruler of the myriad of worlds and invincible through the lands!” No one dared to put on airs in front of Wan Shi, and they greeted him in haste. They fell to their knees and kowtowed, not daring to look directly at him.

Wan Shi swept his gaze across everyone present, and he nodded his head slightly, “Get up.” Even though his voice was placid, it resonated deep in their hearts, and they found it impossible to defy his orders.

Only then did Wan Yue and the others rise. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Congratulations to Lord Father for completing the secret art!” Wan Yue stepped forward, and a smile appeared on his face.

Wan Shi nodded his head slowly and said with indifference, “This wasn’t a bad session. I not only managed to comprehend the secret art, but I also managed to increase my strength by quite a bit.”

Comprehend the secret art!

Increase his strength by ‘quite a bit’!

Wan Yue and the others nearly jumped in joy when they heard what he said.

“Lord Father, you might not have heard, but in the past thousand years, there has been a brat called Huang Xiaolong who rose to fame. He managed to obtain the King of Hell’s inheritance as well as take the King of Grandmist as his master. Not only that, but he also managed to obtain the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance and unify the Radiance World!” Wan Yue quickly complained to Wan Shi. “He gathered the Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, Old Ancestor Azure Cow, and several others and disregarded our City of All-Heavens City! He’s too arrogant!”

After he spoke, he quickly sprinkled in some details to make Huang Xiaolong look extremely bad.

“Oh? Huang Xiaolong?” Wan Shi wasn’t really interested in Huang Xiaolong. However, his interest was finally piqued when he heard the entire story.

“Lord Father, please make a move and kill Huang Xiaolong!” Wan Yue added.
