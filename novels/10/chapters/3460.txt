Chapter 3461: Yin Yang Source Vein!

“Third Young Master, is there really a universe-level spiritual vein in the Ice Palace?” a white-browed expert asked.

Gao Boyang looked at the man before muttering, “That's what we heard. No one knows if that’s actually true. However, many world masters are here to try their luck.”

His father, the world master of the Floating Light World, was also there for the rumored universe-level spiritual vein.

“There are rumors that there are more than a single universe-level spiritual vein in the Ice Palace…” Gao Boyang muttered.

Everyone stared at him in shock.

“Third Young Master, what do you mean?”

“It’s said that the universe-level spiritual veins in there were formed at the same time. They seem to be related to each other, and if you find one, you’ll be able to find the other,” Gao Boyang explained.

Twins?!

“There should be a universe-level spiritual vein in the Dragon Cave too!”

“How is that possible!”

Gao Boyang continued, “Well, there might be one, but no one has been able to locate it. Only people with ungodly luck will be able to find treasures like a universe-level spiritual vein.”

Of course, he had no idea that Huang Xiaolong had not only obtained the universe-level spiritual vein, but had also refined it.

…

Half a day later…

Huang Xiaolong and the others saw a giant ice valley in the ground below.

“Your Highness, it looks like we came to the right place!” Long Yi grinned.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response.

They had just learned about the presence of the Yin-Yang universe-level spiritual vein.

Gu Yuan muttered, “I heard that Lord Shi Li will be here too…” His expression turned solemn.

That was a God of Creation! The strongest expert in the Shi Li World! He was a God of Creation who had reached the large completion stage! Moreover, he wasn’t any ordinary expert. He had entered the large completion stage a long time ago…

“How strong do you think Shi Li is?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

The three of them fell silent in an instant.

There wasn’t a good way to estimate Shi Li’s strength!

“Probably… Probably 4 billion units of grand cosmos energy or more…” Gu Yuan eventually replied.

4 billion!

That was only Gu Yuan’s initial estimate! Even if Shi Li didn’t possess so much grand cosmos energy, he wouldn’t be too much weaker. No one could be sure that Shi Li didn’t run into some sort of fortuitous encounter in recent years. If he did, his strength would far surpass that level.

“4 billion…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

At that moment, he was closing in on 3.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He was willing to take the risk to battle Shi Li with the help of the Pangu Axe!

After devouring the Dragon Marrow he obtained in the Dragon Cave, the Pangu Axe could be said to have recovered quite a bit of its strength!

However, if he could obtain the Heart of Ice and the Ice Marrow, the Pangu Axe would definitely grow even stronger!

“Alright! We’ll head into the Ice Palace!” Huang Xiaolong tore through the air and soared straight for the Ice Palace.

Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han followed closely behind.

The Ice Palace was located deep in the Ice River and even with their speed, they would need three months to arrive.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others were rushing over, a huge group of experts from the Northern Court Celestial Empire had already gathered outside the Ice Palace.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

With Bei Yanrui in the lead, the various grand marshals of the empire stood behind him. There were countless generals behind them, and their party consisted of more than ten thousand people! Of course, everyone who could appear in the Ice River was an expert who had comprehended the elements.

The Ice Palace stood tall in the middle of the land, and it was millions of miles long!

Mysterious runes swirled around the walls of the palace and weird mirages could be seen from time to time.

There were rumors that said that if one could understand the mysteries behind the runes, they would be able to enter the one-thousandth space!

Even so, the Ice Palace had stood tall for countless years. No one had ever been able to understand the visions or runes.

There was no need to mention comprehending the mysteries behind the runes. Not many people could understand one-ten-thousandth of it.

Those who could uncover the mysteries behind a portion of the runes would be considered monstrous geniuses in the Shi Li World! Anyone who could comprehend one-tenth of the mysteries would be geniuses among geniuses.

The experts who traveled to the Ice Palace stared at the experts of the Northern Court Celestial Empire in fright. Even though there were slightly more than ten thousand people in their entourage, they were more than enough to suppress countless holy worlds.

“Why did so many experts from the Northern Court Celestial Empire come?! It’s too exaggerated, even if they are here to welcome Lord Bei Ting! Did they deploy the entirety of their strength or something?” the world master of the Giant Sentry Holy World muttered.

The Giant Sentry Holy Word was pretty famous in the Shi Li World. The world master had comprehended eleven elements to perfection level, and he could rank in the top hundred experts in the Shi Li World!

“Don’t you know? Something happened in the Northern Court Celestial Empire. Something big!” the world master of the Purple Smoke Holy World whispered. “I heard that the other party is also here in the Ice River World, and that’s the reason behind their mobilization.”

“What in the world is going on?! I emerged from seclusion not too long ago, and something so big happened?! Who’s crazy enough to challenge the Northern Court Celestial Empire?” Ju Bin, the Giant Sentry World Master gasped.

“I have no idea. The empire is extremely strict in keeping the matter under wraps. After all, it’s probably humiliating for them to reveal what happened. From what I’ve heard, Lord Yang Han seems to have fallen into the enemy’s hands. The celestial empire sent many experts over to save him, but none of them succeeded!” Wang Shang, the Purple Smoke World Master said softly.

Ju Bin exclaimed in fright, “What?! Is Lord Yang Han currently held in captivity?!”

Yang Han was the imperial teacher in the Northern Court Celestial Empire. He was the fourth princess’ master, and everyone knew that he had accumulated 1 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

Wang Shang shook his head. “No. He wasn’t held captive. I heard that Lord Yang Han submitted to the other party after he was captured.”

Ju Bin opened his mouth slightly, but no words came out of it. Yang Han actually betrayed the celestial empire!

“Who… Who’s the other party?!” Ju Bin whimpered.

“We have no idea. We only know that the other party has the surname, Huang.”

Ju Bin felt his body trembling violently. “Huang… Huang… Is he related to the Huang Family in the Mu Yang World?!”

“Nope…” A complicated expression appeared on Wang Shang’s face. “He shouldn’t be related to Huang Muyuang, but he might be coming to the Ice Palace.”

?! Ju Bin turned to look at the experts standing all around him.

Guessing Ju Bin’s thoughts, Wang Shang continued, “You’re right. Everyone isn’t here to enter the Ice Palace. They wish to see the guy who challenged the Northern Court Celestial Empire.”

One month later…

The news of Lord Shi Li’s arrival shook the Ice River World.

Soon after, the news of Bei Ting’s emergence from the Ice Palace spread through the lands.
