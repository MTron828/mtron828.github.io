Chapter 505: Unifying Starcloud Continent

Asura’s Gate headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong sat on the throne seat in the main hall, and in front of him on both sides were experts of Starcloud Continent and Ten Directions Continent; Asura’s Gate, Nine Yang Valley, Distinct Void Door, White Phoenix House, and the rest on the left, whereas Ao Kun, Lei Ge, Chuck, and those from Ten Directions Continent stood on his right.

More than four thousand Saint realm experts were present!

Looking at the people gathered before him, Huang Xiaolong was in a perplexed mood, sighing at the sight of the force in his hand yet feeling proud at the same time.

This force was enough to flatten the entire Martial Spirit World!

If this was ten years ago, he dared not believe that there would be a day when he could break through to Ninth Order Saint realm, that there would be a day when he would hold such a powerful force in his hands!

Twenty years ago, Huang Xiaolong was merely an average Huang Clan Manor disciple, a low-level insignificant family. Whereas now, he had more than four thousand Saint realm experts at his beck and call! And too many half-Saints and Xiantian realm disciples to mention.

Huang Peng and Su Yan both indirectly felt the same feelings as their son. More than twenty years ago, when Huang Xiaolong’s martial spirit had just awakened, he was determined as an average grade seven martial spirit. Neither of them had imagined that their son would rise to the pinnacle of the Martial Spirit World.

With all the Saint realm experts presents, Huang Xiaolong began to organize the Asura’s Gate, Nine Yang Valley, Distinct Void Door, and other Starcloud Continent forces. The subjugated forces became the Asura’s Gate branches and their Sovereigns and Leaders were designated as Branch Master.

When the reorganization was done, Huang Xiaolong ordered Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu to recite the new Asura’s Gate rules that he had established.

Hearing one of the new rules of the Asura’s Gate that Huang Xiaolong created that required all Branch Masters to respectfully salute Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, the corner of the Nine Yang Valley Branch Master Chi Jiuyang’s mouth twitched.

He, a half-step God Realm, actually needed to respectfully salute Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, these two peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm? In the end, he merely sighed inwardly, a thousand words buried unspoken in his heart.

Now, he was just someone branded with Huang Xiaolong’s soul mark. Before Huang Xiaolong, he was merely a servant! What rights did a servant have to negotiate with the master?

As Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu recited the rules Huang Xiaolong established, the facial expressions on Chi Jiuyang, Liu Zhiding, and the other Branch Masters did not escape Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

When Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu completed their tasks, Huang Xiaolong spoke: “Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu.”

“Your subordinate is here!” Both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu answered in unison, taking a step forward.

“Bring the Nine Yang Valley, Distinct Void Door, White Phoenix House, Strong Sword Sect, and all the nine forces’ experts to the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School! Capture and bring their Sovereigns to the Asura’s Gate, those who resist, kill them all!” Huang Xiaolong commanded.

Nine out of eleven of Starcloud Continent’s super forces had already surrendered to Huang Xiaolong, leaving only the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School. Only by subjugating the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School could Huang Xiaolong be considered as truly having unified the Starcloud Continent. Of course, with the Asura’s Gate’s current momentum, it was not necessary for Huang Xiaolong to make a trip personally to take over the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School.

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu complied with a respectful demeanor.

As an afterthought, Huang Xiaolong gave both of them one thousand Poison Corpse Scarabs each to ensure that everything went without a hitch.

Day gradually darkened into a silent night.

Huang Xiaolong stood alone in the Asura’s Gate inner yard, in contemplation.

With the addition of the Nine Yang Valley and the other super forces under him, the strength of his forces was enough to annihilate Deities Templar. But, Huang Xiaolong still had one nagging concern about Temple Preceptor Ying Tian’s cultivation level.

If Huang Xiaolong exerted his full effort to attack using the Godly Xumi Art, he could battle to a draw with the half-step God Realm Chi Jiuyang. However, against a true genuine God Realm Master, he didn’t have even one ounce of confidence.

According to Chi Jiuyang’s words, the difference between a God Realm and half-step God Realm was like heaven and earth.

A God Realm Master killing a half-step God Realm expert was akin to a Saint realm expert killing a half-Saint expert, as easy as killing an ant on the ground.

Even if it was just a God Realm Master that had just broken through, Chi Jiuyang still wouldn’t be able to take a single hit.

“Dragon God Grass.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself, arriving at the same conclusion again.

During the day, other than giving orders to attack the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School, Huang Xiaolong also tasked the many branches to send their disciples out to search for Dragon God Grass.

Whoever found Dragon God Grass or provided feasible information would be heavily rewarded! Thus, Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate, swallowing the Ape Deity Herculean Strength Pellets while he waited for news of Dragon God Grass.

Half a month passed by.

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the rest did not disappoint Huang Xiaolong, successfully capturing the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School’s Sovereigns, as well as all the experts from both forces, bringing them back to the Asura’s Gate headquarters.

In the midst of subjugating these two forces, Deities Templar’s experts jumped out, trying to hinder Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, but with Chi Jiuyang, Liu Zhiding, and the other Branch Masters with them, Deities Templar’s hindrance was dealt with akin to crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.

Despite being brought as captives, the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School’s Sovereigns did not surrender to Huang Xiaolong.

The Brilliant Sword Sect’s Sovereign glared coldly at Huang Xiaolong, saying, “Huang Xiaolong, don’t feel too complacent. In our Temple Preceptor’s eyes, you’re nothing but an ant! If he wants to kill you, a single finger would be sufficient to squash you.”

Supreme Harmony School’s Sovereign echoed, “Our Deities Templar Temple Preceptor did not kill you only because he felt disdained to do it himself.”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong sneered; summoning the Poison Corpse Scarabs and had them devour both of sovereigns down to the bones right in front of the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School’s experts.

The two forces’ experts watched as the Poison Corpse Scarabs devoured their Sovereigns. The tragic screams that were begging for mercy sent chills deep into their hearts, their faces drained of all color. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Huang Xiaolong did not put away the Poison Corpse Scarabs after they were done with the two Sovereigns but allowed them to hover above the group of Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School experts.

Other than that, Huang Xiaolong did nothing else. Not a word was said.

“I, I’m willing to submit!” Brilliant Sword Sect’s Deputy Sovereign stammered, stepping out in a kneeling position. Following that, several Elders from the Brilliant Sword Sect and Supreme Harmony School also showed their willingness to submit to Huang Xiaolong.

Witnessing this, the reluctant ones were swayed, surrendering with the rest and Huang Xiaolong marked all of them with a soul imprint.

With this, Huang Xiaolong was fully in control of all the notable forces, unifying the Starcloud Continent!

Then, Huang Xiaolong commanded the Ten Directions Continent Saint realm Elders to lead more than half of the experts back to the Ten Directions Continent, leaving no less than five hundred Saint realm experts in the Asura’s Gate headquarters.

As things moved, another two days passed.

On this day, when Huang Xiaolong was practicing the Asura Sword Skill and Fifteen Moves of the Dragon God, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu ran in to report with beaming expressions, “Sovereign, there’s news of Dragon God Grass!”

Hearing this, a sliver of excitement shot through his body.

“There’s an old man who claims back when he entered the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins he collected nineteen stalks Dragon God Grass! He’s in Asura City at this very moment!” Zhao Shu laughed.

“Good!” Huang Xiaolong also laughed heartily.

Nineteen stalks!

This was truly the greatest news! With these nineteen stalks of Dragon God Grass, he had full confidence in breaking through to Tenth Order Saint realm!

“Come, we’re heading to the Asura City right now!” Huang Xiaolong laughed and was the first one to fly out of the main hall. Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu followed behind him.

The three of them headed to Asura City.

Asura City was situated at the foot of the mountain. After not even ten breaths of time, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu arrived at their destination.
