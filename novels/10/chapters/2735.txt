Chapter 2736: Who Exactly Are You, Huang Xiaolong?

“What?!” Qiao Bai, Tang Yuan and Wang Xueru screamed in shock when they saw He Ba smashing to the ground.

“Lord He!” The Primal Ancestors of the Ice Blue Sacred Land yelled in unison.

As Huang Xiaolong casually walked past the seven other Primal Ancestors, they retreated hastily.

He ignored all of them as he walked towards He Ba. By dragging him up from the debris, Huang Xiaolong held him up like a dead chicken. After the punch from Huang Xiaolong, He Ba wasn’t any different from Yuan Yue and Tang Jin, who were smashed into meat paste previously. The divine armor around him was completely shattered, and injuries filled his body. It was a horrifying sight.

He Ba’s breaths were light, and he was on the verge of death. If Huang Xiaolong had used a little more strength just a second ago, his physical body would have crumbled.

“I guess you’re not doubting my abilities now,” Huang Xiaolong said with indifference. Pausing for a second, he continued, “You have two choices now. You can either die like Tang Jin and Yuan Yue, or you can choose to submit, and be my slave.”

Everyone froze.

Even though everyone saw how strong Huang Xiaolong was when he defeated He Ba with a single punch, they failed to hide their discomfort when they heard what he said.

He Ba was a peak late Fourth-Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert. Not even a high-level Primal Ancestor Realm expert would be confident of crushing his grand dao physique!

Everyone present stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. He Ba was no different.

A feeling of shame filled He Ba’s heart when he realized that he was at the mercy of a Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm cultivator. He was humiliated, but a sense of anger soon formed in his heart. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think you’re unbeatable?! Kill me if you dare! You’re a wimp if you can only run your mouth!”

He Ba broke out into a sinister laughter.

When he thought that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be willing to kill him, a sense of relief swept through his heart.

A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he started to circulate his power. The Huang Long Bloodline in his body started to move as he unleashed his complete strength. A streak of golden light emerged from his fist as his punch slammed into He Ba’s body.

Boom!

A loud blast rang through the air.

As he exploded into a mist of blood, the heavens trembled, and his golden blood rained down on the lands.

As a mid-level Primal Ancestor, his blood contained a ton of energy.

The enormous amount of grand dao qi that used to fill his body swept out like a wave. Those standing around felt suffocated when the wave of grand dao qi swept past them.

Their jaws dropped as they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Tang Yuan and Qiao Bai felt the blood draining from their faces, and their legs felt weak.

“There is no way… How can this be real?!” a disciple of the Ice Blue Sacred Land mumbled foolishly.

As He Ba’s dao soul tried to escape, Huang Xiaolong reached into the air to grab it. There was a fearful look on He Ba’s dao soul, but he failed to escape no matter how hard he tried.

“This… This is not possible! Huang Xiaolong, who… Who in the world are you?!” His dao soul trembled in fear.

For a True Saint to crush his grand dao physique… How strong would Huang Xiaolong have to be in order to accomplish such a feat?

He was unable to understand how he lost to a True Saint. That was the first time a True Saint had killed anyone in the Primal Ancestor Realm in the history of the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave! Not even the surrounding regions produced such a monstrous existence!

No… He hadn’t heard of a genius at that level in the Divine Tuo Holy World!

“Me? There’s no need for you to worry about that. Everyone in the Divine Tuo Holy World will soon learn of my identity.” A charming smile soon formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Indeed, the Divine Tuo Holy World would be welcoming the Son of Creation!

Tossing He Ba’s dao soul into the Cangqiong Sacred Land, he no longer bothered with it. According to Huang Xiaolong’s plan, he wanted to devour the dao souls of Yuan Qianxing and the others once he entered the Primal Ancestor Realm.

After dealing with He Ba, Huang Xiaolong focused his attention on the seven Primal Ancestors from the Ice Blue Sacred Land.

They stared at Huang Xiaolong as horror ran through their minds.

“Time for you to make your choice. You can choose to submit, or you can die. Of course, you can also choose to be like He Ba, who refused to believe me,” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

A grimace could be seen on the faces of the seven Primal Ancestors.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They didn’t think that they would be making a choice like that when they had arrived.

Serve Huang Xiaolong? What nonsense! They couldn’t accept serving a True Saint, but if they refused, their end would be the same as He Ba! Their grand dao physiques would be destroyed!

“Let’s join forces and kill him! There is no way we will fail to stand up to a Ninth Heaven True Saint!” a mid-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor howled.

If seven Primal Ancestors joined forces to kill True Saints, they would possess enough power to kill a Ninth Heaven True Saint a million times over!

“Kill!” they roared after glancing at each other. They released their aura and a terrifying pressure filled the lands.

All seven of them charged at Huang Xiaolong in unison.

“You’re tired of living.” A flash of cold light ran through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Since they had made their choice, Huang Xiaolong would fulfill their wishes.

Huang Xiaolong’s body started to flash around the air as he appeared in front of the Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor after he spoke. With a single punch, he dealt with his enemy.

Turning around, he sent out another punch.

Blasts rang through the air as the Primal Ancestors dropped like flies.

When it came down to the final Primal Ancestor of the Ice Blue Sacred Land, Huang Xiaolong paused for a second to look at the expression of fear on the other party’s face. Soon after, he shattered the Primal Ancestor’s dao physique with another punch.

He threw their dao souls into the Cangqiong Dao Palace when he was done.

Turning to look around him, Huang Xiaolong saw the golden rain as grand dao energy surged through his body. He felt everyone’s gazes on him as they stared at him in disbelief.

Wang Xueru and the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land were dumbstruck for a long time.

The space around Huang Xiaolong started to shake, and Long Jianfei and the others appeared.

“Young Lord!” Long Jianfei greeted politely.

“Clean this up,” Huang Xiaolong ordered.

Long Jianfei bowed respectfully, and he dealt with the aftermath of the battle. When he was doing so, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards Tang Yuan and the others.

There was an inexplicable look of fear on their faces.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong…” Tang Yuan stuttered.

As a ray of light shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s finger, Tang Yuan’s body exploded.
