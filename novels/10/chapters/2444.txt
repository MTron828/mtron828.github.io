Chapter 2445: So-so

Huang Xiaolong noted the shock on Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Zhan Zhiyuan, Li Chen, Xie Bufan, Dou Rui, and others’ faces, without missing the burning gleam of fanatic desire. He sneered inwardly, as this was exactly the reaction he wanted!

With the grandmist holy spiritual aura golden dragon here, Huang Xiaolong was not worried that Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Xie Bufan, Li Chen, Zhan Zhiyuan, and the rest wouldn’t be willing to send the most promising disciples of their forces up to challenge him.

With the presence of the grandmist holy spiritual aura from the golden dragon rippling through the air, Duan Xuan, Xie Bufan, and the others would definitely bet everything they had, sending their best disciples up to the battle stage.

Even if there was only the slimmest hope, these people would grab at it desperately.

Having Wu Ge and the various Holy Heavens’ hall masters here was an insurance. Hence Huang Xiaolong was not afraid there would be anyone wanting to snatch the grandmist holy spiritual aura.

Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong had long ‘tamed’ this golden grandmist holy dragon, and with a mere thought, he could easily and swiftly put it back into the Darkness Holy Ring. Even if these people wanted to snatch it, they wouldn’t be able to, unless they killed Huang Xiaolong first.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned to Fang Xing, Sui Yunfeng, Gu Xuanxu, and other participating disciples’ astonished faces, as they stared fixedly at the golden grandmist holy dragon to the point of forgetting to draw lots. Huang Xiaolong reminded them, “Does everyone have their numbers?”

Fang Xin, Sui Yunfeng, Gu Xuanxu, and the others awakened from their dazed state.

They continued to draw the lots.

Before long, Fang Xing, Sui Yunfeng, Gu Xuanxu, and the rest of the thirty-nine challengers in the first round had all drawn their numbers.

Everyone wiped away the restriction on the tokens they had drawn to see the number they had gotten.

Fang Xin suddenly let out a maniacal laughter, shrieking, “I’m number one, I’m number one! Haha, the grandmist holy spiritual aura is mine! That grandmist holy spiritual aura is mine!”

Obviously, he subconsciously believed that the grandmist holy spiritual aura was already something in his pocket!

Fang Xin came to his senses a second later, and realized he had made a gaffe, and said hurriedly, “The grandmist holy spiritual aura belongs to our Ancient Emperor Holy Ground!”

The stern light in Duan Xuan’s eyes diminished slightly hearing Fang Xin’s revised words, and the smile on his face deepened.

“Congratulations, Master!” Zhang Yihui congratulated the beaming Duan Xuan.

“Congratulations, Patriarch!”

The various Eminent Elders of Ancient Emperor Holy Ground, and hall masters were quick to congratulate Duan Xuan. All of a sudden, the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s group was infected with a joyous atmosphere as if the grandmist holy spiritual aura dragon was already in their bag.

Ancient Holy Emperor Duan Xuan laughed heartily, “Great, didn’t I tell you that my luck is excellent this year. Look, my luck is indeed excellent! Everyone will be rewarded to celebrate my winning of the grandmist holy spiritual aura when we return! You will get Ancient Emperor Holy Qi and Ancient Emperor Thousand Realms Pills! Everyone will have to share!”

Zhang Yihui, the group of Ancient Emperor Holy Grounds’ Eminent Elders, and hall masters enthusiastically thanked Duan Xuan.

Huang Xiaolong watched this scene with interest, as he shook his head inwardly. He felt a little speechless. The first match had not even begun, but Duan Xuan had already announced that Ancient Emperor Holy Qi and Ancient Emperor Thousand Realms Pills would be rewarded when they returned to the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong had to admire Duan Xuan’s grandiose manner, as he was willing to take out the Ancient Emperor Holy Qi and Ancient Emperor Thousand Realms Pills. These two Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s treasures were famous and grand rewards.

On the other hand, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Sui Yunfeng, who had gotten 2nd number, was crestfallen as he returned to Shen Jiewen’s side. His head lowered to his chest as he mumbled apologetically, “Patriarch, disciple is useless, I got the 2nd number.”

Shen Jiewen took a quick glance at Duan Xuan, who was laughing heartily, feeling very much uncomfortable, but he forced a smile and said, “Don’t worry about it. You are not to blame for this. Not to mention, even if the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground has got the first chance, Fang Xin might fail to defeat Huang Xiaolong.”

Unfortunately, Shen Jiewen himself wasn’t certain of his own words. After all, Fang Xin had the Sacred Emperor Saint Godhead that was ranked twenty-third.

Is Huang Xiaolong strong enough to be Fang Xing’s opponent?

Fang Xing was excited for a full three minutes before finding his way to the battle stage in hurried steps.

He looked at Huang Xiaolong with a bright smile as he said, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, fists and legs have no eyes on the battle stage, so if I happen to hurt you accidentally, please forgive me.”

Huang Xiaolong truly couldn’t hold back his sarcastic nature anymore looking at the sunny smile on Fang Xing’s face. “Sure, don’t worry. If you happen to hurt me, I won’t blame you.” Then he continued, “But are you certain that you’re capable of hurting me?”

Fang Xing’s smile stiffened for a split second, but he recovered soon. “It looks like Your Highness is very confident about himself?”

“There is some confidence,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Although I am not very strong, I am confident that I can kill you.”

Fang Xing’s eyes narrowed dangerously and the smile on his face diminished. “In that case, I won’t hold back.”

Although Fang Xing did not take out any weapon, a blinding light burst from his body, and crepuscular rays reached the sky as a figure exuding strong holy aura emerged from the sea of light.

This supreme holy figure was ten thousand zhang tall, casting a shadow over the land, and subjecting the experts below with a strong coercive pressure. Disciples below Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint backed away from the stage involuntarily, and their faces pallid.

“It’s the Ancient Holy Emperor True Body Manifestation!”

“This is one of the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s highest grade of holy martial arts. Fang Xing actually succeeded in practicing this holy martial art. It is as expected of the genius who possesses the Sacred Emperor Saint Godhead! It is said the Ancient Holy Emperor True Body Manifestation can send a fraction of the Ancient Emperor Ancestor’s power into the body of the caster, raising the caster’s strength significantly. Fang Xing’s battle power is originally high, but now that he executed this holy martial art, he can easily kill the average Sixth Tribulation half-True Saint Holy Princes!”

The surrounding experts exclaimed in shock. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wu Ge’s brows were tightly scrunched together.

Is Huang Xiaolong going to lose in the first day’s very first match?

He couldn’t help taking another look at the majestic golden grandmist holy spiritual aura dragon high in the air!

Pangs of regret gnawed at his heart. Had he known the grandmist holy spiritual aura Huang Xiaolong had was so massive, he would have stopped Huang Xiaolong from setting up this stage battle challenge.

Lin Xiaoying, who was spectating secretly, urged with hushed whispers, “Senior Sister Tan Juan, do you think Thirteen will lose in the first match? Let’s think of a way to help him quickly!”

Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi both shook their heads, “Huang Xiaolong can only rely on himself on the battle stage. We cannot interfere in any way.”

Experts gathered around the battle stage were as numerous as the clouds. Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi couldn’t help even in secret.

Moreover, to ensure fairness and inhibit anyone from interfering with the battles, layers of restrictions were arranged around the stage so that the people outside won’t be able to directly influence whatever was taking place on stage in a short time.

“Ancient Emperor’s Great Dao Fist!”

Fang Xing bellowed as his fists punched out mightily towards Huang Xiaolong. In the same instant, the Ancient Holy Emperor True Body Manifestation emitted an intense light, sending a great amount of energy into Fang Xing’s body.

Giant fists appeared in the air, falling accurately on Huang Xiaolong’s body faster than any Sixth Tribulation, or even Seventh Tribulation half-True Saints below the stage could react.

BOOM! An ear-splitting collision from the stage reverberated through the venue.

Fang Xing’s Ancient Emperor’s Great Dao Fist struck Huang Xiaolong, and Lin Xiaoying’s face was drained of blood watching what transpired. She was clutching her own mouth to stop herself from screaming out loud.

Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi too didn’t look very well.

Fang Xing was a peak late-Third Tribulation half-True Saint with a Sacred Emperor Saint Godhead, and adding the boost from Ancient Holy Emperor True Body Manifestation, could Huang Xiaolong survive the overwhelming force of Fang Xing’s Ancient Emperor’s Great Dao Fist?

Wu Ge and the present Holy Heavens’ hall masters as well as grand elders had their hearts hanging high, as none of them could believe that Fang Xing had actually dared to attack Huang Xiaolong so ruthlessly!

Wu Ge looked at the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s experts with piercing killing intent.

Xie Bufan shook his head in disappointment, lamenting, “Pity, it fell into the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground’s hand!”

Li Chen’s brows were deeply furrowed. Huang Xiaolong died just like that? Didn’t he die too easily!

Upon seeing that he had killed Huang Xiaolong in one strike, Fang Xing too was surprised, but it was soon replaced by sonorous laughter that bubbled uncontrollably up his chest, “Huang Xiaolong, you who are hailed as the future’s strongest person of the Holy World are merely so-so!”
