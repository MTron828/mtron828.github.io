While the Barbarians were crying tears of joy, Huang Xiaolong who had absorbed all the earth element chaos divine lightning opened his eyes, and breathed out a mouthful of turbid qi.

At this time, a brownish yellow bead fell from the void, and Huang Xiaolong reached out and caught it in the air.

The brownish yellow bead was half the size of an adult man’s fist with tiny ribbons of earth element chaos divine lightning crackling over its surface. The situation inside the bead was a hazy blur.

But Huang Xiaolong knew the earth element chaos divine lightning that had covered this enormous land earlier, originated from this unremarkable looking bead!

The main culprit that had hindered the Barbarians from freedom was this bead!

There was a glimmer of astonishment and doubt in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he observed the mysterious chaos lightning bead.

Even with his powerful soul, he was unable to enter the chaos lightning bead. He was getting rebounded the moment his divine sense tried to approach it.

“Junior Brother!”

“Master!”

“Manor Lord!”

Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, Feng Er, and others’ voices sounded at this time.

Huang Xiaolong turned around to look and saw Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, and the rest flying towards him with beaming faces. Still holding the chaos lightning bead, Haung Xiaolong stood up from the ground and greeted Jiang Hong, “Senior Brother.”

Not only had he succeeded in absorbing the Land of Lightning Penalty’s earth element chaos divine lightning but his strength had also improved significantly in the process. Not to mention that his three avatars had broken through to the God King Realm. So, Huang Xiaolong was in a good mood.

“Kiddo Huang, what’s that lightning bead in your hand?” Descending by Huang Xiaolong’s side, the little cow’s gaze was fixed on the chaos lightning bead in his hand with an astonished expression.

Her words attracted Jiang Hong’s attention. He looked at the lightning bead and his eyes widened in surprise.

Clearly, both the little cow and Jiang Hong could see the extraordinariness of the chaos lightning bead in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, otherwise, they wouldn’t have shown this level of astonishment.

“The earth element chaos divine lightning that covered this land came from this lightning bead.” Huang Xiaolong told them frankly.

“Quick, let me have a look.” The little cow urged.

Huang Xiaolong handed the chaos lightning bead to her without a word.

The little cow held the chaos lightning bead, turning it left and right. She became more excited as she looked at it, then said, “Could it be, could it be, really that thing?” But in the next second, she refused herself, “But how could such a thing appear in this space?!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“No, impossible, how could this thing appear here?!”

The little cow was feeling excited, baffled, astonished, and surreal all at the same time, shaking her head as she muttered unintelligibly under her breath.

Jiang Hong too was staring fixedly at the lightning bead. His expressions were not that much different from the little cow’s.

Watching their expressions, Huang Xiaolong and the rest grew increasingly curious.

“Xiaoniu, this chaos lightning bead is very precious, isn’t it?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking.

The little cow nodded her head heavily with a serious expression that Huang Xiaolong had never seen before and said, “Super treasure!”

A super treasure!

The others felt like laughing watching the little cow’s contradicting expressions but none of them dared to laugh.

Although Huang Xiaolong guessed the chaos lightning bead was precious, the little cow and Jiang Hong’s reactions clearly told him that the value of the chaos lightning bead far exceeded his imagination.

“Senior Brother and Xiaoniu, do you recognize this chaos lightning bead?” Huang Xiaolong mainly looked at Jiang Hong.

Jiang Hong shook his head, “No.”

No...? The answer threw Huang Xiaolong off guard.

What’s with your reactions then?

The little cow passed the chaos lightning bead to Jiang Hong while saying, “Kiddo Jiang Hong, you take a look too.”

Although the chaos lightning bead’s value was enough to rouse greed and desire in the hearts of many cultivators, the little cow knew Jiang Hong was not such a person.

Jiang Hong’s hands were shaking from excitement as he received the chaos lightning bead from the little cow.

He almost repeated the same words as the little cow, after checking the chaos lightning bead from left, right, and all around with shining eyes.

A long time later, Jiang Hong returned the chaos lightning bead back to Huang Xiaolong, and took a deep breath before he spoke with a serious expression, “Junior Brother, no matter what, this chaos lightning bead cannot be taken out in public, or shown to others.”

Huang Xiaolong put away the chaos lightning bead and nodded. He did not ask the little cow or Jiang Hong what exactly this chaos lightning bead was.

Since this chaos lightning bead was so precious, he would find an opportunity to ask the little cow or Jiang Hong about it in the future.

After all, there was a large group of Barbarians present around them.

After Huang Xiaolong threw the chaos lightning bead into the Tianwu Treasure, Lei Budong, Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang walked up to Huang Xiaolong. When they were right in front of Huang Xiaolong, the Barbarians’ five Head Chieftains suddenly knelt on their knees and kowtowed deeply. “Lei Budong, Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang salute to the Great King!”

Salutes to the Great King!

The Great King!

After hearing Lei Budong and the other four Head Chieftains addressing Huang Xiaolong as their Great King, Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and the others were dumbfounded.

Subsequently, the Barbarians’ thirteen small chieftains also stepped up to Huang Xiaolong, knelt on their knees and kowtowed in salute, “Salute to the Great King!”

Again, Great King!

Looking at Lei Budong and the group of people kneeling in front of him, Huang Xiaolong had a wry smile on his face. Why did it feel like he has become a group of mountain bandits’ king?

“Stand up,” Huang Xiaolong said helplessly.

“Yes, Great King!” Lei Budong, Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, and the rest respectfully complied and got up from the ground. So did the rest of the chieftains and experts.

“Erm, that, can you not call me Great King?” Huang Xiaolong asked Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the rest of the five Head Chieftains.

But Lei Budong answered with utmost determination, “According to our ancestral rules, the person who leads our tribe out of this space is our tribe’s king, our Great King!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had yet to really lead them out of the space, they could see a big black hole in the far distance. That black hole was probably the exit.

Therefore, Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the others were fixed on recognizing Huang Xiaolong as their Barbarians’ king! Great King!

The little cow laughed as she said, “Kiddo Huang, you’ve become a Great King now, then what am I?”

Huang Xiaolong stressed, “You are this Great King’s mount.”

Mount!

The others could no longer hold in their laughter. Xu Baisheng was already guffawing dramatically.

The little cow raised her back leg and mercilessly kicked Xu Baisheng, sending him flying several thousand meters away. Xu Baisheng looked aggrieved as he climbed from the ground.

“That’s enough, stop playing around. Let’s go out first.” Huang Xiaolong stated.

“Yes, Great King!” Before Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, or others could say anything, Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the rest of the Barbarians replied with sonorous voices.

Huang Xiaolong squeezed a smile, then leaped onto the little cow’s back and flew straight towards the black hole. The rest followed and soon, the group arrived in front of the black hole.

This giant black hole was several hundred meters wide and it could easily fit several hundred people for crossing it at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong zoomed into the black hole on the little cow, followed by Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and lastly, the Barbarians group.

The moment they entered the black hole, heaven and earth reversed. In the next second, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had arrived outside.

Huang Xiaolong scanned his surroundings. He was delighted as he noticed he was at the bottom of the Ghost River.

They were outside!!
