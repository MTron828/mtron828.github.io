Those Radiance Angels’ holy and pure twelve wings withered and rotted under the corrosion of Huang Xiaolong’s darkness godforce, akin to a dried-up branch without any vitality.

To an angel, their wings were a vital part of them, as a Radiance Angels’ light energy source gathered in their wings. The withering and rotting of a Radiance Angel’s wings significantly weakened his strength.

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly relieved when he saw that this attack was effective.

Losing their source of light energy meant these several hundred Radiance Angels could no longer form part of the grand formation.

The pressure on Huang Xiaolong diminished greatly.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong did not dare to take things lightly. His supreme darkness godforce was already gathering around his hands again, forming numerous sharp blades that pierced through the several hundred Radiance Angels. However, these Radiance Angels did not die on the spot. They thrashed around in pain, and powerful bursts of energy came from their bodies as they attempted to break free from Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claws.

Dragon flames surfaced around Huang Xiaolong’s claws upon seeing this.

Dragon flames were one of the most potent fires in the world. Based on the terrifying strength of Huang Xiaolong’s primordial divine dragon body, not just these twelve-winged mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Radiance Angels, even the late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Radiance Angels would get destroyed by Huang Xiaolong’s dragon flames. Hence, in a matter of moments, these Radiance Angels were incinerated.

As they were reduced to ashes, several hundred sources of Holy Mountain’s energy slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s body almost simultaneously.

Huang Xiaolong trembled from the vast rush of energy.

The amount of energy from each of these Radiance Angels was greater than Huang Xiaolong had estimated. Shockingly, this energy actually contained a kind of chaos law!

“This is chaos law?!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed out loud in a pleasant surprise.

Only cultivators who completely comprehended chaos law at the peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm could advance to Emperor Realm, becoming an Emperor. Chaos laws were not easy to comprehend, much less completely comprehending a kind of chaos law was very difficult. Countless geniuses’ cultivation was stuck at the peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, unable to break through to the Emperor Realm because of this.

This was also the reason why Emperor Realm experts were so scarce in the universe.

Yet, the energy from these twelve-winged Radiance Angels on the Holy Mountain’s twelfth floor actually contained a kind of chaos law! This chaos law was similar to the Holy Mountain’s energy. Due to this, Huang Xiaolong was able to refine and integrate it into his supreme godheads easily!

In other words, as long as Huang Xiaolong’s supreme godheads integrated a certain degree of this chaos law, he could almost advance directly to Emperor Realm when his cultivation reached the peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

There was a burning light in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he took another look at the army of Radiance Angels. The wryness earlier had long vanished in a puff of smoke.

From a particular perspective, these Radiance Angels were more precious than any grandmist treasures, ah! Although a grandmist treasure like the City of Eternity possessed powerful attacks, it did not help Huang Xiaolong in building a foundation for his breakthrough to the Emperor Realm, but the Holy Mountain’s energy from these Radiance Angels could help him achieve that!

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply to calm the excitement surging in his chest. His dragon flames incinerated the other several hundred Radiance Angels caught in his other dragon claw.

Immediately, several hundred sources of Holy Mountain’s energy, containing chaos law, rushed into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

When the other Radiance Angels attacked, Huang Xiaolong dodged with the Black Dragon Clan’s agile technique, then his dragon tail swept out in a counter-attacked. Radiance Angels that were too slow to dodge were sent flying in various directions.

Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claws slapped down, smashing another several hundred Radiance Angels out of the way.

With the combination of Huang Xiaolong’s primordial divine dragon’s swiftness and the Black Dragon Clan’s movement technique, groups of Radiance Angels were rapidly incinerated, turning into the Holy Mountain’s chaos law energy.

Ten thousand, two thousand, three thousand....

Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads integrated more sources of chaos law, and his strength rose steadily. His cultivation that had reached the peak of mid-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm finally broke through after absorbing almost four thousand Twelve-winged Radiance Angels! A brilliant light enshrouded Huang Xiaolong’s body as he advanced to the late-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

The moment Huang Xiaolong broke through to the late-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, he clearly felt that his speed had almost doubled, and his supreme godforce’s power had increased by a large degree.

With a sweep of his dragon claw, the Radiance Angels were slammed deep into the floor.

Before his breakthrough, though he could hit them easily, he couldn’t smash them into the floor in a single strike as he did now.

.....

A year later.

Huang Xiaolong had finished killing all thirty thousand Radiance Angels on the twelfth floor.

When the last Radiance Angel turned into a stream of energy and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body, Huang Xiaolong reverted to his human form. He crumbled to the floor as his highly-strung body relaxed. He laid on the floor, panting heavily, too exhausted to lift a finger.

He had cleared it!

He had cleared the Holy Mountain’s twelfth floor that no one had been able to clear since its appearance!

Huang Xiaolong was still panting on the floor when golden lights flickered, and three holy fruits appeared before him.

For a moment, Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

According to the ‘rules,’ the holy fruits should have appeared after he entered the entryway on the next floor, but these three holy fruits had already appeared?

Then again, remembering that this was the highest floor, Huang Xiaolong has taken it for granted.

Huang Xiaolong sat up, and a suction force from his palm sucked the three holy fruits to his front. Adding these three holy fruits, he now had a total of thirty-six holy fruits.

He placed the three holy fruits into the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle. He then started circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to recover his strength.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong’s godforce fully recovered. He stood up and gazed into the next entryway. Where would it lead him? Could it be the legendary ‘heaven?’

Huang Xiaolong blurred into a flicker, arriving at the entryway almost instantaneously. He took a couple of deep breaths to adjust his mind, godforce brewing within his body in preparation as he took a step inside. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Experts waiting on the outside saw a hole rupture in space above the Holy Mountain when Huang Xiaolong stepped in. Crepuscular rays of radiant light shone onto the Nethersea like a thunderstorm.

These rays exuded an aura of holiness, reaching every corner of the Nethersea.

Bathed in this holy light, all the experts felt their evil thoughts, impurities, and nefarious elements vanish from their hearts and souls, washed away by the golden holy light.

Following the emergence of this golden light, a gigantic and ancient building with holy radiance slowly descended from the space rupture.

“This, this is ‘Heaven!’ Heaven really appeared! There really is a Heaven in Hell!”

“Someone passed the twelfth floor! Is it that mysterious genius?!”

A sea of screams and shrieks echoed endlessly in the air.

Everyone’s breathing quickened.

They were witnessing a historical moment, something that had never happened in Hell. No one had ever seen the ‘Heaven’ appear, but they were looking at Heaven now.

Even Desolate Giant Tai Yue and his three companions were shocked to their souls at this moment, as they watched the ancient building descending from the void.

“There are grandmist treasures inside ‘Heaven,’ and top-grade grandmist spiritual pills! Quickly go grab it!”

Suddenly, one of the Ancestors shouted at the experts of his sect, then flew towards the descending ‘Heaven,’ in a hurry.
