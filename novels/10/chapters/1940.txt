“Family Head... is there something wrong?” When You Wuye saw the You Chengguang sitting on the ground listlessly, he couldn’t help but ask, “Is there a bigshot in the Divine World with the same name as Huang Xiaolong?”

You Chengguang broke into laughter all of a sudden, and he couldn’t stop laughing. His laughter gave You Wuye and the others oosebumps.

“Several hundred years ago, there was indeed a kid called Huang Xiaolong. He ascended from the lower realm and that Huang Xiaolong was a disciple of a tiny sect located in the Vientiane World surface.”

You Chengguang’s voice rang loud and clear through the hall.

You Wuye, Wangu Yanhui, and Cheng Zongyi knew that the Huang Xiaolong You Chengguang was describing was definitely the Huang Xiaolong they were talking about.

“After that, when the Fortune Emperor Palace opened up their disciple selection on the Vientiane World, Huang Xiaolong signed up and obtained the first position. He was accepted as the personal disciple of the ancestor stationed in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s branch in the Vientiane World surface.”

The moment the three of them heard what You Chengguang said, their expressions changed.

“Also, not too long ago, all of the Emperors felt that something huge was going to happen in the Divine World, and they decided to accept genius disciples from their branch palaces into the main palace. Huang Xiaolong went ahead to obtain the first position in the Fortune Emperor Palace’s grand tournament as well.”

“What?!” The three of them screamed in unison as they started to tremble.

When all three of them heard that Huang Xiaolong had taken first place in the mere branch palace of the Fortune Emperor Palace, they were still hopeful about taking their revenge. They had never thought that Huang Xiaolong could obtain first place in the main palace’s competition!

“After that, Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei accepted Huang Xiaolong as his personal disciple.” You Chengguang ignored the looks of shock on their faces, and continued.

“How is the Fortune Emperor Palace ranked in the Divine World? Are they ranked in the top few?” You Wuye’s voice became softer and softer as he asked.

You Chengguang felt a myriad of emotions running through his heart when he answered the question. “Sixty-first. They rank sixty-first among all the Emperor Palaces!”

“Sixty-first!” You Wuye and the other two sucked in a cold breath.

It was no wonder everyone’s faces changed when they heard that the person who had exterminated the You Family was Huang Xiaolong.

Wangu Yanhui hesitated for a moment before asking. “Senior Chengguang, even though they are ranked sixty-first, they probably wouldn’t attack my Wangu Emperor Palace because of a disciple, right?”

“A disciple?” One of the elders from the You Family stared at Wangu Yanhui as though he was a retard. “Do you really think we’ll be so afraid if Huang Xiaolong is a mere disciple of the Fortune Emperor Palace?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The three of them stared at the elder in shock.

“Could it be that he has another identity in the Divine World?!” Cheng Zongyi couldn’t control his emotions, and asked.

You Chengguang continued, “Do you know about the Battle of the Heavenly Court?” Even without waiting for their reply, You Chengguang started to tell his story. “The Battle of the Heavenly Court takes place once every hundred thousand years. Every single Emperor Palace sends their strongest disciple, and every single one of them has to be in the God King Realm and above. Moreover, they can’t be more than a hundred thousand years old.”

“God King?!” Wangu Yanhui and the other two felt their expressions dropping.

They knew that the Ancient God Realm was above the Heavenly God Realm, and the Ancestor God Realm came after that! The God King Realm was even higher than the Ancestor God Realm! Even You Chengguang, who was standing before them, was merely an Ancestor God!

“Family Head Chengguang, do you mean to say that Huang Xiaolong took part in the Battle of the Heavenly Court on behalf of the Fortune Emperor Palace?” You Wuye’s voice started to tremble. “Is Huang Xiaolong already in the God King Realm?!”

You Chengguang’s laughter rang through the air. “God King?! On the stage, Huang Xiaolong humiliated the Heavenly Emperor’s son, Di Jing, by beating him down mercilessly. In the end, he obtained first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. Heavenly Prince Di Jing was at the peak of the early-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. He even had the Heavenly Dao Supreme Godhead! Even so, Huang Xiaolong beat him down like a dead dog on the side of the street!”

Wangu Yanhui, You Wuye, and Cheng Zongyi felt a bomb going off in their head.

First place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court!

Even the Heavenly Prince who was at the peak of the early-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm was beaten like a dead dog on the side of the street!

Peak of the early-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Their bodies stiffened.

“Wouldn’t that make Huang Xiaolong the number one person in the younger generation of the Divine World?!” Wangu Yanhui stuttered.

“Isn’t he afraid of facing the Heavenly Emperor’s wrath after humiliating Heavenly Prince Di Jing?!” Cheng Zongyi felt his jaws dropping to the ground in shock as he asked.

You Chengguang shook his head, and a look of unrestrained fear flashed through his eyes. “He’s not just the number one person in the younger generation of the Divine World. He’s the junior brother of the number one expert of the Divine World, the Grandmist Emperor! Other than Zhao Lei, Huang Xiaolong has another master, the King of Grandmist himself!”

The junior brother of the number one expert in the Divine World!

Wangu Yanhui, You Wuye, and Chang Zongyi felt their hearts stop beating.

“That’s just one of Huang Xiaolong’s identities.” The look of fear on You Chengguang’s face became more solemn as he continued, “Huang Xiaolong went over to Hell and obtained the Netherworld King’s inheritance. He is the current King of Hell. He controls all the experts in Hell!”

King of Hell!

Wangu Yanhui, You Wuye, and Cheng Zongyi felt their souls leaving their bodies.

......

An entire month later...

The Netherking Flying Ship, that was speeding past the Divine World, stopped, and Huang Xiaolong emerged from the ship with his party in tow.

When they saw the countless palaces floating in mid-air, the Ascending Moon Old Man and the others sucked in a cold breath of air.

“Little brat, is this the Fortune Emperor Palace?” The Ascending Moon Old Man asked with his jaws agape.

Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Of course. Let’s go in.”

The first time he had seen the headquarters of the Fortune Emperor Palace, his reaction was the same as the Ascending Moon Old Man.

The Ascending Moon Old Man, Xie Puti, and the other hastily followed behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Sect master, we aren’t members of the Fortune Emperor Palace. Won’t there be trouble if you bring us into the palace?” Fei Hou asked.

A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Don’t worry about it. I have special authority in the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man and the others finally relaxed when they heard what he said. The deeper they approached, the greater was the shock on the Ascending Moon Old Man’s face. Every single disciple along the way greeted Huang Xiaolong, and they kneeled the moment they saw him. They didn’t move a single muscle until Huang Xiaolong, and the others disappeared from their sight.

It didn’t matter if the disciples they ran into were inner disciples or core disciples! Even personal disciples of various ancestors were no exception! There were even elders who greeted Huang Xiaolong with the same level of respect!

“Little kid, could that be a hall master of your Fortune Emperor Palace?” The Ascending Moon Old Man pointed towards one of the random members kneeling on the ground and asked.

Xie Puti, Fei Hou, Ao Taiyi, and the rest stared at him in shock.

Huang Xiaolong felt a little embarrassed when they stared at him, and he thought that he had to explain himself. “Yes. That’s the hall master of the medicinal hall.” He hesitated for a moment before continuing, “In fact, my identity is a little special. Other than being a disciple of the Fortune Emperor Palace, I have several other identities.”
