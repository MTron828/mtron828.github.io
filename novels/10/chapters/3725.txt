Chapter 3726: Golden Phoenix Crown Prince

“You don’t know?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

The White Deer snorted in response. “I might be the owner of the White Deer Space, but do you think I’m god?! How am I supposed to know everything that happens here?”

“Should we go take a look?” Yang Dingsheng asked cautiously.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the look of anticipation on Yang Dingsheng’s face, he chuckled, “Alright… let’s go take a look.”

He knew that Yang Dingsheng was afraid that the two would break out into a massive brawl if their argument got any worse.

If that were to happen, he might not be able to save his wife!

Huang Xiaolong knew exactly how Yang Dingsheng felt.

As such, the three of them flew casually over to the source of the energy fluctuations.

After half an hour, they saw a massive continent floating in midair. The continent was comparable to the one where Huang Xiaolong found the White Deer, but there were strange white creatures growing all over the land.

The White Deer Cave was an eerie place, and everything they saw was black. There wasn’t a single speck of white throughout their journey, but an entire continent was now covered in it!

The grass was white, the stones were white, and even the river that flowed in the land was white in color!

Yang Dingsheng was equally as surprised.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the White Deer only to be greeted by a confused look. “How in the world did these things turn white?” It hadn’t left the White Deer Cave for a long time and it knew everything that happened in the lands. Such a huge change should have caught its attention!

A terrifying power emerged from the depths of the land, and it was evident that there were several experts fighting within.

Huang Xiaolong and the others flew deeper into the white continent.

As they went deeper and deeper, there was a weird holy energy that emerged from the lands.

Huang Xiaolong thought of the White Feather King when he felt the pulsating waves.

“Don’t tell me that there’s really a treasure here…” A burning gaze appeared in the White Deer’s eyes.

It could tell that the item was definitely not ordinary. The energy coming from the lands felt extremely familiar.

Huang Xiaolong also felt his heart speeding up.

The number of treasures that could excite him could probably be counted on one hand. However, there were definitely a few of them that could tempt him into fighting for them.

It was clear that the treasure that was about to appear was anything but ordinary.

Huang Xiaolong sped up after thinking about it.

The White Deer and Yang Dingsheng did the same.

“This is mine! It appeared in my White Deer Cave, and I’m the owner of the region! You can’t fight me for it!” The White Deer snapped.

“Nonsense. Didn’t the Universe Source Stone come from your territory too?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

The White Deer snorted in annoyance.

It didn’t take long for the three of them to arrive.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s the experts from the Dazzling Black Race…” Yang Dingsheng gasped. “Their opponents are from the Ghost Ao Race!”

The members of the Dazzling Black Race are the ones who had annoyed Huang Xiaolong previously. Even though Cao Cheng wasn’t part of the battle, his subordinates were.

The Dazzling Black Race was considered one of the top races among the ancient races. The Ghost Ao Race was close to them in strength.

Those who were fighting were experts who neared the 20 billion mark.

The experts of the other races were enjoying their battle at the side, and Huang Xiaolong saw a giant lake slightly past them.

Completely white in color, the lake emitted a milky glow that contained dense radiant energy.

Huang Xiaolong could feel a strange power condensing deep in the lake, and the might it gave off was no weaker than the Universe Source Stone!

From the looks of it, the object would only be ready after several hours…

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls in order to spy on the object, only to be disappointed. There were countless restrictions around the lake made by the universes in order to protect the object within.

It was the reason behind the massive battle that was taking place. Both parties wanted to lay claim to the item the moment it emerged.

The Dazzling Black Race ignored Huang Xiaolong’s presence completely. After all, they couldn’t be bothered by the ‘weakling’ that traveled with Yang Dingsheng. As for the White Deer, it had long since concealed itself. It hid its aura and stood beside Huang Xiaolong like an ordinary creature.

When the two parties were about to reach the climax of the battle, a massive flying ship tore through the air. It traveled towards them at a frightening speed and a giant shockwave arrived before the ship came.

Seeing the insignia on the massive ship, everyone gasped in fright.

“Golden Phoenix Race!” Yang Dingsheng yelled.

The Golden Phoenix Race was ranked among the top five out of all the ancient races!

The Dazzling Black Race and Ghost Ao Race might be strong, but they were far from comparable to the Golden Phoenix Race!

The faces of Cao Cheng and the others changed and a look of fear crossed their faces.

It didn’t take long for the flying ship to arrive. Several dozen people emerged from the ship and more than half of those who emerged were existences at the same level at Yang Dingsheng.

Their leader was a young man who had a golden flame symbol dancing between his eyebrows.

“Golden Phoenix Crown Prince!” many people yelled when they saw him.

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince was someone whose combat strength closed in on the 22 billion mark. He was only weaker than the Fortune Prince in the younger generation of the ancient races.

As soon as he appeared, he swept his gaze across those present and sneered, “The item in the lake belongs to my Golden Phoenix Race. I’ll give all of you one minute to leave the area.”

The faces of everyone present changed, but no one dared to speak out against him.

Even so, no one took their leave.

Ordinarily, they would listen to whatever the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince said. However, the treasure under the lake was too tempting.

“Cripple anyone who doesn’t leave in a minute.” The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince said to the experts behind him.

When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, he walked towards the giant lake.

However, a voice rang through the air as he approached. “Brat, the item under the lake is mine. If you approach the lake, I’ll cripple your legs!”

Everyone turned to stare at the person who spoke with disbelief in their eyes. To their horror, the person who spoke was Huang Xiaolong!

Cao Cheng was stunned for a second, and he didn’t understand where Huang Xiaolong found his courage from. Did he not know the Golden Phoenix Race?

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince paused for a second before bursting into laughter. “Brat, you wish to cripple me?”

He didn’t expect anyone to counter his threat with a threat of their own!
