When the humongous entity broke out from the Nethersea, the sea surface within a billion li radius exploded consecutively, heaven and earth shook and swayed. The sea waves splashed over ten thousand zhang tall!

The experts within the one billion li radius range retreated in a hurry, flying higher and further away.

The Nethersea’s seawater was no child’s play. Its corrosiveness was very lethal and a splatter of a few drops would make an Emperor Realm expert’s face distort in excruciating pain. The pain went bone-deep, reaching the soul.

Heavenly Monarch Realm experts needed to stand far away, especially those with a weaker physique. Just a drop of Nethersea’s water would corrode the Heavenly Monarch Realm until nothing was left.

However, Huang Xiaolong had the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and the protection of four peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts. So he naturally didn’t need to worry about these raging waves reaching him.

When the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin rose higher into the sky with Huang Xiaolong, the roaring high waves splashed towards them. The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s four hooves stomped in the air, and instantly, the rising tides fell back to the sea.

Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, and the others directly released their momentum outwards in the four directions. Any sea waves that came close stopped meters away from them, then dispersed into the sea below.

The humongous entity was still rising from the sea below, causing the sea waves to roil higher and rougher. The entire Nethersea that was twice the size of the Nirvana Plane was swaying.

The humongous entity had yet to emerge to the sea surface, except for a tiny part. Even so, from afar, it looked like a big mainland was rising from the bottom of the sea, taking up one-tenth of the Nethersea.

“This Holy Mountain is so huge!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in astonishment.

Though Tai Yue and the others had mentioned early on that the Holy Mountain was absolutely massive; still, the size of the entity in front of him was bigger than Huang Xiaolong had imagined.

It was already the size of some of the smaller planes.

“This is less than half of the Holy Mountain in its entirety. Wait until the Holy Mountain emerges fully, as Master will then realize how big the Holy Mountain really is.” Fan Hui chuckled.

Less than half! Huang Xiaolong was genuinely shocked.

As the Holy Mountain continued to rise to the surface, fissures appeared in the surrounding space. Tempestuous winds howled as a sudden downpour started. This downpour was actually seawater blown by the wind. The speed of the downpour was comparable to the attack of a low-level Emperor Realm expert.

The surrounding experts quickly called their divine armors in a fluster or attacked while dodging from being splashed by the water droplets.

Half an hour later, the Holy Mountain was still rising out from the Nethersea.

Half of the Nethersea sea area dimmed under the shadow of the Holy Mountain.

A dozen of minutes passed.

At last, the Holy Mountain had risen out from the sea in its entirety, hovering high in the air above the Nethersea. It was casting an enormous shadow over the Nethersea. Those standing closest to the Holy Mountain were unable to see the sky as the Holy Mountain was simply too big for words.

A human was smaller than a speck of dust standing beside the Holy Mountain.

Huang Xiaolong was awestruck by the Holy Mountain in front of him. The Divine Tree of Darkness was the Asura World’s most enormous divine tree, however, the visual impact of the Holy Mountain was much more powerful than the Divine Tree of Darkness. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Holy Mountain exuded a holy aura with a soft halo of bright colors from top to bottom!

This was completely different from what Huang Xiaolong had imagined.

In the general conception, Hell represented darkness, bloodthirstiness, coldness, and depravity without hope. It was illogical that something sacred like the Holy Mountain existed in Hell.

While Huang Xiaolong was looking at the Holy Mountain in amazement, Asura King Jin Yuan’s voice sounded in his ears, “Master, the Holy Mountain’s entryway is about to open.”

Huang Xiaolong reacted, his gaze fell on the foot of the Holy Mountain.

The Holy Mountain was triangular like a pyramid. The first floor was located at the mountain base while the twelfth floor was located at the peak.

Just as Jin Yuan reminded Huang Xiaolong, a ‘big mouth’ suddenly opened at the Holy Mountain’s base. Dazzling rays of light escaped from the entryway, shining onto the sea surface.

“The entryway has appeared!”

“Hurry, enter!”

The experts surrounding the Holy Mountain shouted in excitement, seeing this and dashed towards the entryway so they could enter a second faster than others.

Everyone wanted to enter one step ahead of the others as the deadline for every time the Holy Mountain appeared was twelve years. Not to mention that only the first three people who cleared the obstacles on each floor were rewarded with holy fruits.

“Hao Ren, go!” Huang Xiaolong lightly patted the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s head. Hao Ren, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin nickered and turned into a streak of crimson flames, carrying Huang Xiaolong towards the entryway. All those blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path were immediately swept away.

These experts made full effort to send their young lords or sects’ genius disciples to the entryway as fast as possible.

Although Huang Xiaolong was quick among these people, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Song Litao, Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s Shi Yinyu, and Peng Zhengfei were even faster. When Huang Xiaolong was still some distance away from the entryway, Song Litao, Shi Yinyu, Peng Zhengfei, and a few others had almost reached the entryway.

Watching them, Huang Xiaolong yelled, “Tai Yue!”

Following Huang Xiaolong’s line of sight, Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian immediately locked onto Song Litao, Shi Yinyu, and Peng Zhengfei who were closest to the entryway and punched with their fists in their direction.

The four of them were peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts, so one could imagine the horror of their full power attacks. All the experts in their fist force’s path were sent flying away, striking accurately at Song Litao, Shi Yinyu, and Peng Zhengfei.

"Rascals, how dare you!"

The Massacring Gods Gate and Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts protecting Song Litao and Shi Yinyu were enraged, realizing the intention of Tai Yue’s group. All of them struck out in retaliation, attempting to disperse the fist force from Tai Yue’s group.

Rumble~ee!

An ear-splitting boom resounded.

The Massacring Gods Gate and Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor generation experts were sent staggering back, while Song Litao, Shi Yinyu, Peng Zhengfei, and the others were swept to the sides.

In this window of time, Huang Xiaolong reached the entryway at lightning speed, riding on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong leaped off the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s back, disappeared into the entryway, and everyone’s sight.

Only those below the Emperor Realm were allowed to enter the Holy Mountain, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, Desolate Giant Tai Yue, and the rest could only wait outside for Huang Xiaolong to come out.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappear through the entryway, Desolate Giant Tai Yue and the others inwardly heaved a sigh of relief.

After Huang Xiaolong entered through the entryway, the Misty Palace’s He Jingyi and Ghost World’s Qin Huangzhong also rushed in.

Upon seeing this, Song Litao’s eyes turned scarlet as he roared in anger, “Bloody hell, I’m going to kill you!”

“Young Lord, go in quickly!” The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Lu Tianyuan shouted. He knew that in this situation, the more important thing was to make it through the entryway as fast as possible, and the other things could be left for later.

Song Litao suppressed the boiling killing intent inside his chest and rushed into the Holy Mountain with Shi Yinyu and the rest.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong, who had already entered the Holy Mountain, discovered that he had arrived at a sandy land. On the other end was the entrance to the second floor!

Just as Huang Xiaolong wanted to fly over the sandy land towards the second-floor entrance, suddenly, a roar shook the air as giant beasts resembling lions formed right before his eyes. There were precisely ten thousand of them, not a lion, more or less.
