Chapter 2433: Ancient Holy Emperor

Huang Xiaolong followed Shi Feng and the others, and flew towards the north.

Along the way, he asked Shi Feng about the reason he had appeared in the Purple Clouds Sea. After all, as the hall master of the Holy Heaven’s Law Enforcement Hall, he wouldn’t leave the organization normally.

As it turned out, Shi Feng had managed to obtain a map of the Desolate Saint. Everything had pointed him in the direction of the Purple Clouds Sea, and he had decided to head over to take a look for himself.

The Desolate Saint was the ancestor of the Ancient Emperor Holy Grounds. He was an existence with the same seniority as the Ancient Holy Emperor himself. In the Holy World, he could be considered among the first batch of experts, who had entered the True Saint Realm.

There were eight people in the group, who had paved the way into the True Saint Realm, and the Desolate Saint was one of them.

Even though there was no need to doubt the Desolate Saint’s strength, he had already disappeared for an unknown amount of time. Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected Shi Feng to obtain a treasure map related to him.

Since the matter was related to Shi Feng’s treasures, Huang Xiaolong was no longer interested in asking more questions.

Half an hour later, they arrived at one of the desolate mountain ranges and Huang Xiaolong bade Shi Feng farewell.

Initially, Shi Feng had planned on sending Huang Xiaolong back to the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds before leaving in search of his treasure. However, Huang Xiaolong was adamant about leaving the Purple Clouds Sea, and there was nothing he could do to stop him.

As such, Shi Feng could only allow Huang Xiaolong to do as he wished.

After the trio bowed to Huang Xiaolong, they tore through the skies and left.

After seeing that the three of them had gone, Huang Xiaolong brought along Chen Zhi and the others as they headed straight for the deepest regions of the Purple Clouds Sea.

“Your Highness, Zhang Yihui is a b*stard!” Sun Xiang of the Black Inferno Race couldn’t help but rage. He had never expected Zhang Yihui to make claims over the grandmist holy spiritual aura before they could react.

The other True Saints couldn’t help but yell in anger.

A frosty light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he heard Zhang Yihui’s name. If not for the appearance of Guo Chang, he would have long since slain Zhang Yihui.

Too bad for him, Guo Chang had arrived before he could make his move.

However, when his masters would pin the matters on the Ancient Emperor Holy Grounds, the Ancient Holy Emperor would probably punish Zhang Yihui. It was even possible for Zhang Yihui to lose his position as the chief of the Holy Princes!

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to bring Chen Zhi and the others around the Purple Clouds Sea.

Since he still had more than thirty years to the start of the Trial of Blood, he wasn’t in a hurry to refine the grandmist holy spiritual aura. He planned to search for holy herbs in the Purple Clouds Sea before doing anything else.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong was a little hesitant about refining the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura. After all, the strand he had obtained was probably the largest strand of grandmist holy spiritual born in the Holy World. Therefore, directly refining it was really a waste of heaven sent resources.

Whenever he would return to the Holy Heavens and allow his four masters to learn about what had happened, they would probably vomit blood before giving him the whooping of his life.

With the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura he had obtained, he could probably reinforce the main formation of the Holy Heavens organization. It could benefit every single person in the Holy Heavens!

As such, Huang Xiaolong was extremely conflicted when he thought about refining the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura.

He knew that the effects of refining the grandmist holy spiritual aura would far surpass anything he had refined in the past. He would enter the Third Tribulation half-True Saint Realm in an instant, and it was possible for him to enter the mid-Third Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

Even though it could boost his strength, a never-before-seen strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura was a little too valuable to be used in a trade for a one-time increase in strength.

Eventually, Huang Xiaolong tossed the decision to the back of his mind. He decided to deal with the grandmist holy spiritual aura once he returned to the Holy Heavens.

The more he adventured, the larger the stockpile in his Darkness Holy Ring became. The number of holy herbs started to pile up once more.

The situation was similar to what had happened in the Profound River. In a day, Huang Xiaolong would probably discover two stalks of holy herbs.

Since Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage had followed behind Huang Xiaolong in the Profound River, the speed of his collection was not astonishing to them. However, the same couldn’t be said for the rest. Yu Ming, Sun Xiang, and Li Huajun couldn’t believe their eyes.

They felt as though they were dreaming when Huang Xiaolong located holy herb after holy herb in the Purple Clouds Sea.

Only after several months did Huang Xiaolong’s speed start to decline.

Initially, he would find two stalks a day. However, the number decreased to a single stalk every ten days.

A year later, Huang Xiaolong failed to locate a single holy herb even after half a year. Finally stopping his ‘shopping spree,’ Huang Xiaolong decided to return.

In the year he had spent there, he had managed to subdue a ton of purple clouds beasts at the peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm. Even though they couldn’t compare to the number of profound beasts he had collected in the past, he still managed to capture six hundred of them.

That wasn’t all. He also managed to subdue two True Saint Realm purple clouds beasts. Since they had entered the True Saint Realm, they could transform themselves.

Two months later, Huang Xiaolong finally returned to the Mirage Pavilion.

Before he could enter, he was stopped by several experts from the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate. Other than Zhang Yihui, Guo Chang was present. However, the two of them were currently standing respectfully beside a scholarly middle-aged man. The man looked like a refined scholar, and he maintained an immaculate beard.

The imperial aura around the man was like an unstoppable wave that battered against everyone unceasingly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Is this little brother Huang Xiaolong of the Holy Heavens?” The refined middle-aged man addressed Huang Xiaolong the moment he appeared at the entrance. “You can call me Duan Xuan.”

Indeed...

Duan Xuan was the current patriarch of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate, and he was the Ancient Holy Emperor’s one and only disciple!

It was said that he had long since arrived at the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm, and his strength was comparable to the Ancient Holy Emperor of the past.

“As it turns out, Patriarch Duan Xuan is here!” Huang Xiaolong cupped his fist, and he continued his greeting, “Why are your subordinates stopping me from entering?”

As the patriarch of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate, there was no reason for him to leave the Holy Gate. Now that he had personally arrived at the Mirage Pavilion, there could only be a single reason. The strand of grandmist holy qi! Even though the other party was a peak Ninth Heaven True Saint, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that he would forcefully snatch the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura.

Duan Xuan chuckled, “Your Highness, please don’t misunderstand. I’m not here to mess with you. Instead, I’m here to apologize for my disciple’s actions.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “If Patriarch Duan doesn’t need anything else, I’ll take my leave.” He turned around and left with Chen Zhi and the others as soon as the words left his lips.

“Huang Xiaolong, stop acting like an arrogant *sshole!” Zhang Yihui, who had been standing at the side silently, couldn’t help but rage.

One had to know that his master was the patriarch of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate. Duan Xuan’s identity in the Holy World was only second to the Primal Ancestors. Now that he had personally arrived to apologize, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even bothered looking at him for a second more.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but turn around.

However, no one could react in time when Duan Xuan sent Zhang Yihui flying with a vicious slap.

“You ungrateful disciple! Kneel and apologize to His Highness!”
