Chapter 2746: Defect

“Xiaolong, don’t you think we should retreat?” Cangqiong Old Man said to Huang Xiaolong after learning that the three sacred lands were coming at them with full force.

Originally, with Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and three other Primal Ancestors around, and counting Hunag Xiaolong, Cangqiong Old Man had some confidence to deal with the three sacred lands’ pressure. But, no matter how strong of a will he had, he didn’t think this group of people was enough to block sixty-eight Primal Ancestor experts!

When he heard that Cangqiong Old Man wanted them to retreat, Huang Xiaolong remained calm as he asked Wang Xueru, “Did Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land send sixty-eight Primal Ancestor experts?”

Wang Xueru, who had obtained first-hand news, replied respectfully, “That is correct, Senior Brother. Apart from sixty-eight Primal Ancestors, there are four thousand and five hundred True Saints, and the weakest of them are mid-level True Saint Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong flashed a smile at Duan Feng and the rest after hearing that and said, “It looks like we can save some time and a few trips back and forth, and we can wipe out these three sacred lands in one swoop.”

Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others chuckled at Huang Xiaolong’s words.

“The three sacred lands want to destroy Cangqiong Sacred Land, and kill the Young Lord, but they don’t know that we are the ones who want to kill them.” Long Jianfei smiled. “The Young Lord can take this chance to checkmate the three sacred lands instead, and after that the nearby sacred lands will come to worship on their own.”

Cangqiong Old Man was completely dumbfounded by the conversation around him.

Wipe out in one fell swoop? The nearby sacred lands will come worship on their own?

Madness!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Was Cangqiong Old Man suspecting himself to have gone mad? Was it an illusion, or had he heard wrongly?

Huang Xiaolong turned to Cangqiong Old Man and said, “Master, I’ll deal with the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight Primal Ancestors alone. The three sacred lands’ True Saints will be left to you, Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Jianfei, and the others.”

Cangqiong Old Man’s eyes widened to the size of a fist. What did Xiaolong say just now?

He alone will deal with the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight Primal Ancestors?!

“Xiaolong, you, are you sure you didn’t speak in err?” Cangqiong Old Man asked in astonishment, “Are you certain that you can deal with sixty-eight Primal Ancestors alone? That’s sixty-eight Primal Ancestors we’re talking about, not sixty-eight True Saints…”

Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jianfei, and the others exchanged knowing smiles. Although they had already told Cangqiong Old Man that Huang Xiaolong’s combat power was amazing, and it surpassed even Duan Feng’s, none of them had clarified how much stronger he was compared to Duan Feng. Thus, Cangqiong Old Man still had an indistinct idea of Huang Xiaolong’s real strength.

No doubt, Cangqiong Old Man thought that even though Huang Xiaolong’s combat power was stronger than him and Duan Feng, he could probably fight Tang Long, but it was impossible for him to kill the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight experts alone!

Therefore, after hearing Huang Xiaolong say that he was going to deal with the sixty-eight Primal Ancestors alone, he thought that it was ridiculous.

“Lord Cangqiong, it shouldn’t be a problem for the Young Lord to deal with the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight Primal Ancestors,” Duan Feng reassured the Cangqiong Old Man and added, “After all, there aren't any Eight Resurrection Primal Ancestor experts amongst the three sacred lands.”

There isn’t any Eight Resurrection Primal Ancestor? Cangqiong Old Man’s eyes were rounded wide. Do these people mean that his disciple is capable of battling an Eight Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert?!

“This, you guys…!” For a moment, he was at a loss for words.

“Master, don’t worry so much. I alone can deal with the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight Primal Ancestors. It’s not a problem at all,” Huang Xiaolong reassured and added, “Even so, I must strengthen the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s defensive grand formation.”

One could imagine the amount of destructive power that would sweep everywhere after the war began. Huang Xiaolong didn’t want the Cangqiong Sacred Land to be reduced to rubbles. Therefore, no matter what, the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s grand formation needed to be strengthened.

Then again, it was unrealistic to want to cover the entire Cangqiong Sacred Land, but protecting the entire Cangqiong City and some of the lands around the Cangqiong City was still doable.

After conquering the nearby sacred lands, he could always rebuild the Cangqiong Sacred Land in no time with these sacred lands’ assistance.

Cangqiong Old Man responded absent-mindedly in response to Huang Xiaolong’s request to strengthen the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s grand formation. He was still thinking about Huang Xiaolong facing the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight Primal Ancestors.

“Young Lord, the three sacred lands’ armies are approaching. Chen Birui’s group is probably going to defect, so should we capture them before that?” Long Jianfei asked, “We should tie up this loose end first, in case Chen Birui stabs us in the back.”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, “There is no need for that. They are just a few grasshoppers, so let’s wait till the three sacred lands’ armies arrive. We’ll deal with them once and for all.”

If Chen Birui and other worshiped experts were Eight Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm experts, then Huang Xiaolong would have been more cautious with them. But Chen Birui’s group consisted of merely Second, Third, and Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestors, so Huang Xiaolong was not worried about them.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong, Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, and the rest began to act, strengthening the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s grand formation, especially the Cangqiong City’s defensive grand formation.

While Huang Xiaolong’s group was busy with strengthening the Cangqiong Sacred Land, Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the others had learned of the approaching three sacred lands’ armies, and they were naturally ecstatic.

“The three sacred lands’ armies are arriving faster than we expected.” Cheng Yueyang clapped and cheered. “Judging from the three armies’ speed, they might arrive in the next few days!”

Chen Birui said, “I was thinking of going to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land to discuss cooperation, but who would’ve thought that the three armies would be already on their way here.”

“Since that’s the situation, I will contact Tang Long and discuss cooperation.” With that said, Chen Birui took out his communication symbol and sent a message to Tang Long.

In truth, he had been in contact with Tang Long since long ago.

Chen Birui soon got in touch with Tang Long, and began discussing cooperation with him. Their discussion ended shortly after, and Chen Birui was smiling from ear to ear.

“Brother Chen, how is it?” Cheng Yueyang asked in a hurry.

Chen Birui looked at his companions with a big smile. “Our cooperation is set, and once the three sacred lands’ armies arrive, we will open a door through the grand formation, allowing the armies to enter. After Cangqion Old Man dies, I will take over as the patriarch of Cangqiong Sacred Land!” He was beaming with complacence.

Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the others were happy to hear that.

“Congratulations, Brother Chen!” Cheng Yueyang congratulated smilingly.

“It should be congratulations to Patriarch Chen!” Goa Chen chuckled from the side.

“Right, right, right, look at my slow mind!” Cheng Yueyang slapped his forehead, causing the others to laugh.

A few days went by quickly.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong ignored the ongoings in the outside world, as he, Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, and the others diligently strengthened the grand formation. In order to speed up the process, Huang Xiaolong even released the Sky Opening Island’s spirit Skylet from his inner small world to help.

A few days later, Wang Xueru came to report that the three sacred lands’ armies were closer and half an hour away from Cangqiong Sacred Land. Only then did Huang Xiaolong’s group stop the work at hand.

In the Cangqiong City airspace, Huang Xiaolong, Duan Feng, and the others stood straight. Cangqiong City that was bustling a few days ago, seemed deserted. After learning that Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land’s armies were going to attack Cangqiong Sacred Land, all the families and forces within Cangqiong Sacred Land had made a run for it. Even many disciples of Cangqiong Sacred Land had deserted the sacred land.

It was not an exaggeration to say, nine out of ten Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples had run away!

“A life and death situation is the best test of loyalty,” Mo Zhi lamented. The Cangqiong Sacred Land, below them, reminded him of the Otherworldly Mansion. When Elder Ming had attacked the Otherworldly Mansion, the disciples had scattered in all directions.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent because after eliminating the three sacred lands, these deserters would be captured and punished accordingly. He set his gaze towards the horizon, and under the coverage of his dao souls, he could see that the three armies had reached the border of Cangqiong Sacred Land.
