Chapter 2114: The 33 Heavens

With the strength to suppress the heavens itself, Huang Xiaolong’s palm slammed down on Wan Zhuoyuan.

With a look of utter fear in his eyes, Wan Zhuoyuan felt a mountain-like pressure crushing down on him. No matter how hard he circulated his godforce or how quickly his Complete Dao Saint Godhead spun, he failed to move his body.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand once again to drag Wan Zhuoyuan towards himself.

“You... It’s not possible! How can you be so strong?!” Wan Zhuoyuan found it hard to believe, and he choked on his words. He found it inconvincible, and he stuttered, “You... you already broke into the mid-level Sovereign Realm?! No! It’s not possible! How can you enter the overlord realm so quickly?!”

“What are you talking about?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled coldly, “Since you can break into the mid-First Order Sovereign Realm, why can’t I enter the mid-level Sovereign Realm? Why can’t I become an overlord?”

Wan Zhuoyuan glared at Huang Xiaolong as a trace of shock rose in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong managed to enter the mid-level Sovereign Realm and become an overlord in such a short amount of time!

Previously he had only guessed that Huang Xiaolong had entered the mid-level Sovereign Realm. When he heard Huang Xiaolong admitting it, his heart shook. Even with Wan Zhuoyuan’s experience as a Venerable Realm expert and all the heaven-defying talents he had seen in his time, he had never seen anyone like Huang Xiaolong before!

One had to know that even an ex-Venerable like him who underwent reincarnation wouldn’t be able to break into the mid-level Sovereign Realm in several tens of years from the mid-First Order Sovereign Realm!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the shocked Wan Zhuoyuan as he quickly placed restrictions on Wan Zhuoyuan’s body to prevent him from circulating his godforce. He threw him into one of the random palaces in the Ancient Heavenly Court, and he landed beside Yang Gang.

As soon as Wan Zhuoyuan entered the Ancient Heavenly Court, he saw Yang Gang rolling on the ground screaming and yelling. His expression changed. With his experience, he could see that Huang Xiaolong had already started to refine Yang Gang’s soul. Moreover, it wasn’t some weak soul refining art... Wan Zhuoyuan recognized it immediately, and he knew that the secret art Huang Xiaolong used was enough to cause even a Sovereign to suffer endlessly.

When he thought about how Huang Xiaolong would use this soul refining art on him, beads of cold sweat started to form on his forehead.

After throwing Wan Zhuoyuan into his Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong quickly left the forbidden area.

“Xiaolong, how is it?” When he finally met up with the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python on a mountain range somewhere on the outskirts of the city, the little cow asked with concern.

“It’s done!” Huang Xiaolong revealed a smile as he nodded his head.

Relaxed laughter resounded through the air when they heard what he said. With Wan Zhuoyuan in their hands, Wan Shi and Wan Yue wouldn’t dare to kill the King of Grandmist and King of Darkness.

Without delay, everyone entered the Ancient Heavenly Court.

“Huang Xiaolong, release me this instant!” Wan Zhuoyuan got to his feet as soon as he saw Huang Xiaolong and the others. “If you release me, I’ll agree to all of your demands! I’ll give you everything my City of All-Heavens has to offer!”

“Your City of All-Heavens can’t offer me what I want...” Huang Xiaolong chuckled, and he slowly made his way to Wan Zhuoyuan. Placing his hand on Wan Zhuoyuan’s shoulder, Huang Xiaolong clenched his fist. The sound of bones shattering echoed through the air.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong sent frigid darkness qi into Wan Zhuoyuan’s body. Without his godforce to protect him, Wan Zhuoyuan’s face turned pale as pain shot through his body. A look of fear and hatred flashed in his eyes, “Huang Xiaolong, I am a reincarnated Venerable, and my soul will never be extinguished! You can’t kill me! As long as you release me, I can teach you my Venerable Art! I’ll tell you everything you want to know!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Do you really think I can’t kill you? Fine. I’ll just imprison you here for eternity. Whatever the case, I don’t need you to tell me what I want to know.”

Terror filled Wan Zhuoyuan’s eyes as he realized what Huang Xiaolong wanted to do. Opening his mouth, he screamed at the top of his lungs, “Huang Xiaolong, my Complete Dao Saint Godhead is protected by Saint Dao Restrictions! Trash like you will never be able to read my memories!”

“Are you sure about that?” Huang Xiaolong didn’t care in the slightest as purple grandmist qi poured into Wan Zhuoyuan’s body without stopping. At the same time, his Sovereign’s will materialized and smashed towards the other party’s soul sea. When Huang Xiaolong’s Sovereign’s will appeared before Wan Zhuoyuan’s Complete Dao Saint Godhead, it turned into the tiny chaos axe as it slammed forward.

Boom!

A wave of pain filled Wan Zhuoyuan’s head, and he felt as though his soul sea was splitting apart. The Saint Dao Restrictions around his Complete Dao Saint Godhead emitted resplendent rays of light as it trembled non-stop.

Wan Zhuoyuan’s expression changed. Huang Xiaolong’s Sovereign’s will had wildly exceeded his expectations. One had to know that even high-level Sovereigns wouldn’t be able to break the Saint Dao Restrictions he had laid down. However, a single blow from Huang Xiaolong nearly shattered them!

If he allowed Huang Xiaolong to continue, he was afraid...

Boom!

The second strike landed!

All the Saint Dao Restrictions on his Complete Dao Saint Godhead started to loosen once again.

“Huang Xiaolong, I am willing to share everything I know with you!” Wan Zhuoyuan finally gave in as he screamed, “I know the way to refine saint artifacts, and I can tell you how! The memory to refine saint artifacts is sealed in the deepest part of my memory! If you forcefully break the restrictions around my godhead, you will damage the memory fragments! You will never be able to learn how to refine saint artifacts unless I tell you the method!”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled.

The way to refine saint artifacts...

Too bad Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about him as he continued to slam the tiny chaos axe against the restrictions.

The third and fourth strike soon landed on Wan Zhuoyuan’s Compete Dao Saint Godhead.

After tens of times, a crisp cracking sound echoed through the air as the restrictions around Wan Zhuoyuan’s Complete Dao Saint Godhead shattered.

In an instant, endless memories poured out from Wan Zhuoyuan’s godhead. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The memories he had in his past and current life flowed into Huang Xiaolong’s head.

An hour quickly passed, and most of the memories Wan Zhuoyuan had were scanned through by Huang Xiaolong. Only a small part remained in the depths of his soul. When Huang Xiaolong tried to look through them, some type of strange energy stopped him.

Noticing the abnormality, Huang Xiaolong continued to slam the tiny chaos axe towards the final line of defense in Wan Zhuoyuan’s soul sea.

Half a day later, a brilliant smile broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face. This was the first time anyone had seen him so happy!

When Huang Xiaolong shattered the final line of defense in Wan Zhuoyuan’s soul sea, he managed to learn of a way to activate saint artifacts! That wasn’t all. He even learned how to refine them!

He would finally be able to use the lightning bead he had obtained back at the Barbarian Space! With the energy contained in the lightning bead, there was no longer a need for him to fear Wan Shi!

“The 33 heavens...” Huang Xiaolong muttered in a soft voice.

The thing that shocked Huang Xiaolong was the final part of Wan Zhuoyuan’s memory. He learned that at the end of the Heavens Path, there was a world Wan Zhuoyuan referred to as the ‘the 33 heavens.’

The world of the 33 heavens was somewhere countless experts gathered. Venerables were everywhere, and there were uncountable heaven-defying geniuses roaming the lands. It was a boundless piece of land, and if he were to place the myriad of worlds there, it would take up a tiny corner at best.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong learned that one had to leave the 33 heavens before one could break into the Venerable Realm! After entering the Venerable Realm, one would be able to transcend life itself and control the cycle of reincarnation!

Too bad Wan Zhuoyuan hadn’t completely recovered his memory of his past life. Huang Xiaolong learned next to nothing about the world outside the 33 heavens.

“It’s the Reverence Moon Old Man! The old man sent me a message!” The little cow yelled all of a sudden as she retrieved her transmission symbol.
