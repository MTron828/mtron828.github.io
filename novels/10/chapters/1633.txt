After the Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards entered the City of Eternity with Huang Xiaolong, they disappeared in a flicker, and each of them returned to their own post, guarding the City of Eternity.

There was a grand ancient formation array around this City of Eternity. It was the Eternal Heaven Refining Array, which was simultaneously activated by these hundred plus puppet Netherguards. Even the heavens could be refined within the scope of this Eternal Heaven Refining Array.

Imagine the array’s power!

After those puppet Netherguards disappeared, Huang Xiaolong activated the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation between his eyebrows to pinpoint the exact location of the other chaos lightning pool.

It merely took Huang Xiaolong a few moments to lock onto the other chaos lightning pool and he disappeared in a streak of light.

As he got closer, Huang Xiaolong could see fine threads of black-colored lightning in the air!

Black-colored lightning! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed in contemplation.

He had seen various kinds of lightning, including the little cow’s purple lightning, however, he had never seen black-colored lightning! He could feel the terrifying destructive power from the black-colored lightning and it was actually located above the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool!

Joy shone in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Even among the nine chaos lightning pools, there were rankings. The first chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool that he had obtained was merely ranked fourth amongst the nine chaos lightning pools.

The chaos lightning pool within this City of Eternity should be the chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool ranked second.

Huang Xiaolong restrained the roiling ecstasy in his heart, and circulated his three supreme godheads’ godforce. At the same time, he summoned the Black Dragon Divine Armor. With nine big black dragons guarding around him, Huang Xiaolong accelerated onwards.

The closer he got, streaks of black-colored lightning in the vicinity increased, and became even more powerful.

At the beginning, these streaks of black-colored lightning were as thin as a thread, gradually becoming as thick as a finger.

These finger-sized thick black-colored lightning could most likely kill the average First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert instantly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, when these black lightning streaks were about to fall on Huang Xiaolong, they were swallowed clean by the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s nine black dragons’ wide opened mouths. Thus Huang Xiaolong was completely unharmed.

Even though this black lightning was powerful, the Black Dragon Divine Armor was a top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact. In the entire universe, there were very few things that could break through its defenses.

Maybe, if there was a high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm expert controlling the chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool, then this black lightning could break the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s defenses.

Seeing that the Black Dragon Divine Armor was effective, Huang Xiaolong’s agitated nerves relaxed as he continued to fly towards the chaos lightning pool up ahead.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong suddenly stopped flying as a stretch of black lightning sea appeared in front of him.

A boundless sea of black lightning.

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s strong soul force, he couldn’t see the other edge of the black lightning sea.

Above the black sea of lightning was a giant black tortoise!

The giant black tortoise was condensed from numerous streaks of black lightning, spanning for thousands and thousands of li. Each tortoise leg was as big as a chaos mountain, and the surface of the tortoise shell was lines of large lightning symbols, glimmering in black light. Each ray of black light contained enough power to destroy a world.

It really is the second ranked chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes gleamed, then he sped towards the giant black tortoise.

As he entered the sea of black lightning, the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows emitted streaks of golden dragon lightning that was roaring with joy.

Huang Xiaolong lightly descended on the giant black tortoise’s shell and sat down cross-legged.

The moment Huang Xiaolong’s feet touched the giant black tortoise’s shell, black lightning seawater rushed to envelop Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium and the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation simultaneously. The black lightning water that enveloped Huang Xiaolong seemed to find a new target and rushed towards the space between his brows.

As Huang Xiaolong continued to swallow, more and more black lightning water flowed towards him.

Even one drop of the black tortoise lightning water would take a cultivator some effort to refine it, but Huang Xiaolong was different. He had the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool, and supreme darkness element godhead; his supreme godhead godforce had merged with the Netherworld King’s Jade’s power, not to mention his Grandmist Parasitic Medium as well as two other supreme godheads!

Huang Xiaolong summoned his three avatars out and formed a four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation.

His three avatars ran the Grandmist Parasitic Medium simultaneously. The surrounding black lightning water roared, seemingly incensed, and rushed even more violently towards Huang Xiaolong.

Days turned into weeks, then one month came and went by.

Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars sat cross-legged on the giant black tortoise’s shell, completely submerged by black lightning water, emitting radiant blue lights from their bodies. The blue lights shining from them were so dazzling that it shone through the black lightning water.

Subconsciously, Huang Xiaolong’s senses merged with the surrounding heaven and earth.

In the blink of an eye, three years went by.

Asura King Jin Yuan and his three companions remained waiting outside the City of Eternity, staring in the direction Huang Xiaolong had entered the city.

“I wonder how is master doing right now?” Demon King Fan Hui wondered out loud.

“Don’t know if master decided to first refine the chaos lightning pool the old master has left behind or to accept the old master’s inheritance?!” Desolate Giant Tai Yue chimed in.

“Probably accept the old master’s inheritance first. That chaos lightning pool the old master left behind is the chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool ranked at second place, so it’s not that easy to refine. Even if our master is a genius with the king of supreme godhead, it would take him several hundred thousand years to do so. Maybe, even millions of years!” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian commented while shaking his head.

“Indeed, refining the chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool is easier said than done.” Asura King Jin Yuan went on, “If master decided to accept the old master’s inheritance first, one to two hundred years are probably sufficient for him.”

“But it’s a pity, the Holy Mountain is about to appear, I’m afraid master won’t make it in time.” Desolate Giant Tai Yue shook his head with regret.

“I’ve heard that Lu Kun’s personal disciple Peng Zhengfei and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Young Lord Yin Yu have already arrived in the Asura World just for the Holy Mountain!” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian grumbled.

“This time around, even the Ghost World’s Fengdu City’s Young Lord Qin Huangzhong has come for the Holy Mountain. All of Hell’s monstrous geniuses from the three worlds have appeared one after another, each aiming to climb to the top of the Holy Mountain!” Asura King Jin Yuan snickered harshly, “But is the Holy Mountain’s twelfth floor so easy to climb? Even a king of supreme godhead genius can’t guarantee he would be able to climb to the top. Why else has no one ever succeeded in climbing to the twelfth floor?!”

“I also feel that in order to reach the twelfth floor, it requires a peerless genius with two king of supreme godheads, or the Heavenly Dao’s Godhead. But from ancient times until now, there haven’t been any geniuses with the Heavenly Dao’s Godhead.” Demon King Fan Hui said, shaking his head.

“Also, the matter regarding the Asura Gate’s Ren Wokuang that master ordered us to investigate, should we report the results to him now?” Asura King Jin Yuan suddenly asked.

“No need for now. If master is accepting the old master’s inheritance, we cannot divide his concentration, moreover, Ren Wokuang is not in any immediate danger. It won’t be too late to report to him when he comes out after accepting the old master’s inheritance.” Desolate Giant Tai Yue stated his opinion.

Others nodded their heads in agreement. It was more important for the master to accept the old master’s inheritance at that moment.

Introduction

Fengdu Ghost City on the banks of the Yangtze River is the "Netherworld" in ancient Chinese legends. The Naihe Bridge (The Bridge of Helplessness-a bridge every soul needs to cross before being reincarnated), the Ghost Gate and the 18th Layers of Hell in ancient Chinese legends can all be found in the Ghost Town of Fengdu. Statues of the legendary netherworld judges and the King of the Netherworld have been erected in the Ghost Town of Fengdu to convey the traditional concept in ancient China of persuading people to perform good deeds and avoid doing bad deeds.
