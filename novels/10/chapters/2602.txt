Chapter 2603: Big News!

Wu Ming wasn’t the only one who was terrified. The members of the Seven Souls Race were equally as scared.

Hun Rui was a Sixth Heaven True Saint! He could probably endure a kick from Jiang Shaohuang, but all of them were merely weaklings! If Jiang Shaohuang really kicked them like how he kicked Hun Rui, they would be dead!

“Hun Rui, your Seven Souls Race is going overboard. How dare you frame my brother?!” Jiang Shaohuang snorted before Hun Rui could say anything.

Hun Rui’s expression changed when he heard how Jiang Shaohuang addressed Huang Xiaolong. However, a smile soon formed on his face. “Lord Jiang is right! I was wrong! It was my mistake that my disciple was killed, and I definitely heard the report wrong! I looked for the wrong person, and I apologize to Lord Jiang! Please forgive me!”

Even though he was a vice hall master in the Seven Souls Race, he was far too lacking if he wanted to compare himself to Jiang Shaohuang. No. Even if the young patriarch of the Seven Souls Race met Jiang Shaohuang, he would have to lower his head and show some respect.

“Forgive you?!” Huang Shaohuang snorted.

Luckily for him, Huang Xiaolong spoke up at the side, “Forget it. Just get him to leave.”

Jiang Shaohuang was a little stunned, but he agreed.

As Hun Rui left, Huang Xiaolong spoke to him, “If you’re unresigned, you can look for me anytime.”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Hun Rui yelled before leaving with the members of the Seven Souls Race.

After getting Jiang Shaohuang’s permission Wu Ming brought the members of the enforcement hall and left too.

With the brief interlude over, the registration process continued smoothly.

Initially, there were more than twenty True Saints standing in front of Huang Xiaolong. However, they quickly moved to the side with a smile on their face after the episode.

After seeing that they were willing to let him go first, Huang Xiaolong didn’t decline their goodwill, and he stepped forward.

Even though the person in charge of the registration process was Sui Fangxing from the mission hall, he didn’t dare to put on airs in front of Huang Xiaolong. After all, Jiang Shaohuang was standing right there! Despite the fact that Jiang Shaohuang’s words held no weight in the mission hall, he was still a vice hall master! Sui Fangxing could only treat Huang Xiaolong with the highest respect as he personally poured Huang Xiaolong a cup of tea.

He asked Huang Xiaolong about his origins with extreme enthusiasm.

“Dissociation Domain, Hong Zhen Holy Grounds. I’m Huang Xiaolong from the Purple Spider Race.”

Everyone turned to stare at him the moment he revealed his origins.

“Purple… Purple Spider Race?!” Sui Fangxing jumped in fright.

“Huang Xiaolong from the Purple Spider Race?! I know! He’s the foster son of Zi Dongping! Lord Zi Dongping held a ceremony two years ago for him, and he’s the current young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race!” someone screamed.

After all, the news of how Zi Dongping had accepted a human as his foster son had spread through the lands. The news of him killing the members of the Golden Buddha Race was also included and everyone had learned of Huang Xiaolong’s name a long time ago.

“It’s no wonder Lord Jiang Shaohuang will accept him as a sworn brother!”

The crowd bubbled with excitement as they continued to speak about Huang Xiaolong’s origins.

As for the members of the Chen Luo Sect, they sucked in a cold breath.&nbsp;Huang Xiaolong of the Purple Spider Race?!

“Who would have thought that he would be the one…?” The old experts, who had proposed saving Huang Xiaolong, sighed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As members of the largest human race superpower, they were naturally aware that Huang Xiaolong was now the young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race.

In the past, their sect leader had already told them to befriend Huang Xiaolong, no matter the cost.

If they had spoken up for him when the members of the Seven Souls Race were threatening him, wouldn’t they have already completed the mission?

The experts from the Chen Luo Sect turned to Chen Muguang and their thoughts started to wander.

Of course, Chen Muguang wasn’t an id*ot. His face started to heat up when he realized that they were staring at him weirdly as a strange feeling filled his heart.

“Ah! As it turns out, you’re Young Patriarch Huang!” Sui Fangxing snapped back to attention and the respect he had for Huang Xiaolong increased once again.

He quickly completed the registration process for Huang Xiaolong after waiving off all the fees he needed for the registration. After all, no members of the royal families needed to pay when registering to enter the Otherworldly Mansion.

It didn’t take long for him to bring Huang Xiaolong over to one of the dao steles.

“I wonder if the young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race would be able to pass…”

“No sh*t! His talent has to be world-defying for Lord Zi Dongping to accept him as a foster son! I heard that Jin Yue from the Golden Buddha Race was killed with a single punch even though he had a saint godhead ranked in the top thirties!”

“He killed Jin Yue with a single punch?! There’s no way that’s true! The Purple Spider Race is lying!”

Discussions filled the crowd.

Chen Muguang’s gaze didn’t leave Huang Xiaolong as he completed the test.

Placing his hand onto the stele, Huang Xiaolong pushed his holy energy into the structure. As the stele emitted rays of light, the results soon came out. “Early-Second Heaven True Saint!”

That was Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm, and there was no way to fake it.

However, the next sentence soon appeared below it. “Primal Dragon Complete Dao Saint Godhead!”

“What?! Rank-thirty saint godhead!”

Huang Xiaolong’s dragon-attributed godhead was indeed ranked thirtieth.

A frown formed on Chen Muguang’s face instantly. All the humans hailed him as the person with the best talent among the human race, and his Fate Changing Saint godhead was ranked lower than Huang Xiaolong! No! Huang Xiaolong wasn’t merely a little more talented than him… He was much more talented!

However, another line appeared under the evaluation of Huang Xiaolong’s saint godhead. “Solitary Darkness Complete Dao Saint godhead!”

The noisy atmosphere turned stiff instantly as silence fell across the lands.

“Two… Two saint godheads!” Chen Muguang gulped in fright when he saw the third line.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong’s Solitary Darkness Saint Godhead was ranked twentieth!

Sui Fangxing, who had a lot of experience during the registration phase, couldn’t help but twitch in fright.&nbsp;Doesn’t this mean that this human’s talent is comparable to Longpeng from the Flying Heaven Race?!

The only person who wasn’t shocked was Jiang Shaohuang.

Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, a fourth line appeared. “Chaos Void Complete Dao Saint Godhead!”&nbsp;

The bodies of everyone present in the plaza started trembling.

“Three… Three saint godheads!” Sui Fangxing screamed in fright.

Not only did the human possess three saint godheads, but they were ranked thirtieth, twentieth, and eleventh, respectively! It was the first person they had seen with three saint godheads since the creation of the Alien Lands!

The plaza erupted instantly.

“Is this the start of our human race’s comeback?!” Tears streamed down the eyes of all the human race experts in the plaza.

…

In one of the luxurious halls in the Otherworldly Mansion, Longpeng played with his crescent-shaped blade as he thought about life. That was his most beloved weapon, and he played around with it whenever he had the time.

As he continued to admire his blade, an elder from the Flying Heaven Race charged into the hall and screamed, “Young… Young Patriarch, something big happened!”

Turning to stare at the elder, Longpeng growled, “What’s there to go off about? Why are you screaming?”

“The young patriarch of the Purple Spider Race… He’s here to register!”
