Chapter 3497: All of Them

Lu Qianqian looked at Huang Xiaolong in shock. Pangu might have accepted her as his foster daughter in the past, but he didn’t pass on his Creation Art due to her lack of talent.

Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong was more talented than her?

Li Qianqian was slightly doubtful. The Submerged Dragon Institution was where the godly talents in the Star Dragon Universe gathered, and as the most talented teacher there, there was practically no one as talented as her.

Huang Xiaolong could only nod slightly when he saw her curious expression.

“This is Xiaolong’s father, and you can call him Uncle Huang Long,” Pangu introduced. “He’s a good friend of mine.”

Lu Qianqian was stunned.

There weren’t many people who were considered friends with Pangu. No matter how she looked at it, the sickly Huang Long didn’t seem to be a God of Creation.

Nevertheless, she still addressed him respectfully in a cute voice.

Huang Long chuckled in amusement, “Who would have thought that Pangu would find such a pretty little daughter at his age…” Huang Long spoke the truth. He didn’t expect anything like it, and neither did the rest.

Lu Qianqian could only smile in response.

Soon after, he introduced Wang Meiqi, Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and the Ice King.

“Big Sister Wang Meiqi, you’re so pretty!” Lu Qianqian gasped.

Wang Meiqi grinned, “Little Sister Qianqian is the true beauty…”

“Alright. Let’s talk inside. I ran all this way and I’m rather thirsty. Little lass, do you still have some of the Monkey Flower Wine?” Pangu laughed.

“Of course I do! I made several dozen thousand jars!” Lu Qianqian giggled.

Soon after, they followed Lu Qianqian into the inner courtyard.

Shen Shijie and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong and the others but chose to remain silent.

“Senior Brother Shen, you need to help me explain my actions to Teacher Lu…” The disciple who tossed Pangu’s plaque pleaded with Shen Shijie.

If he didn’t explain himself, he would be in for a bad time when Lu Qianqian decided to make things difficult for him.

Shen Shijie glanced at the disciple from the corner of his eye and sneered, “F*ck off!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He wouldn’t even be able to explain himself, much less for the kid.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others entered Lu Qianqian’s palace, she brought out several jars of Monkey Flower Wine. After they had a taste, they realized why Pangu was so fond of it. They felt their souls floating in the clouds, and the taste was simply marvelous. The flavor was extremely intense, and Wang Meiqi placed her cup down after a single sip.

“Foster father, are you here to look for the principal?” Lu Qianqian asked. It didn’t seem as though Pangu brought them over to meet her.

Pangu shook his head. “The old foggy is too eccentric! Why would I want to look for him?” He pointed to Huang Long and continued, “Your Uncle Huang here suffered some serious injuries. We heard that there’s a drop of Star Dragon Essence here in the institution.”

They had nothing to hide. After all, they would need her help when they looked for the drop of Star Dragon Essence.

“Star Dragon Essence?!” Lu Qianqian was shocked at the revelation.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. “We obtained the news from the Third Princess of the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire.”

Lu Qianqian sighed, “Not many people know about this, but there is indeed a drop of Star Dragon Essence here in the institution. However, no one knows where it is. Not even the principal!”

Huang Xiaolong and the others weren’t surprised. If Yu Long knew where it was, he would have grabbed it for himself.

“I wonder how Uncle Huang got injured… The Star Dragon Essence is too rare! Not even the principal managed to find it. We have a lot of medicine here, and we have the Resurrection Pill. It’s great for injuries.”

“Did the old man actually succeed in refining that pill?!” Pangu gasped in shock.

He knew about how Yu Long traveled the universe to look for countless treasures to refine pills. However, Yu Long didn’t manage to gather everything before Pangu left in the past.

Lu Qianqian smiled. “That’s right. The principal gathered everything he needed in the past, and he managed to refine a batch of Resurrection Pill with Senior Chen Huan and the others.”

She knew that Pangu and Yu Long made a bet in the past. Pangu bet on the fact that Yu Long wouldn’t be able to refine the pill after ten billion years, but it hadn’t been ten billion years. It seemed as though Pangu had lost…

Pangu coughed lightly when he noticed her stare. “The old foggy didn’t obtain the herbs himself! He used the experts of the institution to locate the herbs! Even if he did manage to locate it himself, he didn’t refine the pill alone!”

Lu Qianqian chuckled in amusement.

Pangu turned to Huang Xiaolong and the others and introduced the Resurrection Pill.

“The power of the Reincarnation Pill might be shocking, but it won’t help Brother Huang Long’s injuries. It will only be able to slightly alleviate the symptoms.” Pangu shook his head. “Only the Star Dragon Essence can stabilize Brother Huang Long’s injuries.”

Lu Qianqian was shocked. Not even the Resurrection Pill could help!

“Qianqian, from what I heard, one has to complete a task for the institution before getting permission to sit before the Dragon Eye Cliff. Is that true?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Lu Qianqian was slightly stunned, but she continued, “That’s right. However, you need to enter the institution before you can accept the task.”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. Before they came, he did enough research. “I heard that the institution is currently looking for several librarians.”

“That’s right.” Lu Qianqian thought for a moment and continued, “The library is looking for six librarians, but their requirements are stringent. Even several teachers in the institution wouldn’t be able to pass the test.”

Even though she didn’t make it obvious, it was clear that she didn’t think Huang Xiaolong and the others would pass.

Huang Xiaolong and the others looked at each other and smiled.

“Are they currently looking for six librarians? Great! There are six of them! All of them will take the test.”

“All of them?!” Lu Qianqian was stunned.

“Being a librarian in the Submerged Dragon Institution isn't bad! You’ll get some pretty amazing compensation. Moreover, there are several treasures in the library waiting for you to uncover,” Pangu smiled.

Indeed, there were countless grand dao arts in the library of the Submerged Dragon Institution. Everyone who wishes to enter will need to get approval from a librarian! As such, they will definitely be willing to give you a few benefits in order to gain access to the library!”

Lu Qianqian revealed a bitter smile. She didn’t think that Pangu would send all six of them for the test! After all, the test wasn’t something they could pass just because they wanted to! If one of them could pass, they should be thanking the heavens!

The next day, Lu Qianqian could only lead Huang Xiaolong and the others over to the library.

Pangu said that he planned to take a stroll around, and he chose to go off on his own.
