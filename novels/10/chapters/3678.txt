Chapter 3679 – Who Touched the Formation?!

After he increased the strength of the formation he laid down, the trembling around the entrance stopped.

Everyone around the entrance could see ferocious ghosts piling up around it. They tried their hardest to destroy the formation stopping them from leaving.

As there were no ferocious ghosts who escaped from the Netherworld, those who managed to escape death earlier were quickly exterminated by the group of experts surrounding the entrance.

The commander of the army guarding the entrance went over to Huang Xiaolong and bowed gratefully, “Yin Guan of the Fengdu City thanks the Lord for killing the ferocious ghosts!”

If the ferocious contained in the Netherworld were to run wild, the consequences were imaginable. It would be an understatement to say that the Green Ghost Lands would fall into utter chaos!

The experts of the various families who were done killing the ferocious devils came over to greet Huang Xiaolong one after another.

Yin Guan was a half-step Universe God whose combat strength broke through the 10 billion units mark. The experts standing around also possessed some influence in the area, but none of them dared to breathe loudly when facing Huang Xiaolong.

“Do you know what happened in the Netherworld?” Huang Xiaolong asked Yin Guan.

Shaking his head, Yin Guan sighed. “I am not too sure what happened down there. However, it seems as though the eye of the formation guarding the Netherworld was damaged! Someone might have attacked the formation laid down by Lord Green Ghost!”

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The eye of the formation guarding the Netherworld?

Who had the ability to do something like that?

Was Zhu Chen behind this?

However, he didn’t seem to have a motive to do something like that!

If Huang Xiaolong subtracted Zhu Chen from the equation, he had no idea who would possess the ability to affect the formation!

When Huang Xiaolong was deep in thought, another group of experts arrived.

Yin Guan spoke to Huang Xiaolong when he saw the party of newcomers. “Our city master is here. Please excuse me while I welcome him.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded nonchalantly.

Yin Qi, the City Lord of the Fengdu City rushed over as quickly as possible. From their names, it wasn’t hard to deduce that they were from the same family. With his position as the Fengdu City Lord, the Yin Family was naturally a massive power in the Green Ghost Lands.

Yin Guan approached Yin Qi and reported everything that happened, including Huang Xiaolong’s actions.

Yin Qi stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock before he slowly went over with Yin Guan following closely behind.

Arriving before Huang Xiaolong, Yin Guan introduced, “Lord, this is the Fengdu City Lord and the patriarch of the Yin Family, Yin Qi!”

“Fellow cultivator assisted us in exterminating the ferocious ghosts and sealed off the entrance to the Netherworld. I really thank you for that.” Yin Qi cupped his fists respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong.

He might be the Fengdu City Lord and the patriarch of the Yin Family, but he didn’t dare to put on airs around Huang Xiaolong. He realized that he couldn’t feel the slightest bit of aura coming off Huang Xiaolong. From what Yin Guan said, his strength seemed to be even a level higher than the Yin Reversal King and Nether Yang King!

“How may I address fellow cultivator?” Yin Qi asked.

“Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang Xiaolong?” A look of confusion appeared on Yin Qi’s face.

One of the experts of the Yin Family cried out all of a sudden, “City Lord, the young lady is still trapped in the Netherworld!”

“What?!” Yin Guan yelled before Yin Qi could even say anything.

“Did Yin Ping enter the Netherworld?! When did she enter?! Why didn’t I hear about this?!” Yin Qi roared.

The expert who made the report flinched before spilling everything he knew. “The young lady entered a month ago! Along with the young lady of the Yin Family, they gathered a group of experts before entering the Netherworld to train themselves! The young lady was afraid that you would stop her and she chose not to report her whereabouts. I only learned about this from the patriarch of the Ying Family!”

A frown appeared on Yin Qi’s face and panic filled his heart. “She went too far this time! Does she think her life is a joke?!”

He looked at the ferocious ghosts pounding away at Huang Xiaolong’s seal around the entrance of the Netherworld and he gulped. He might have 16 billion units of combat strength, but he knew that he would be overwhelmed the moment he entered! There was no way he would be able to save her.

“City Lord, we can mobilize the army! We’ll charge in and save the young lady!” Yin Guan muttered.

However, Yin Qi shook his head slowly. “Even if you gather all the troops stationed in the Fengdu City, you won’t be able to do anything. Everyone who enters now will only be giving up their lives for nothing.”

“I’ll go.” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden.

The experts of the Yin Family stared at him in shock.

“Many thanks for fellow cultivator’s kind intentions…” Yin Qi cupped his fists towards Huang Xiaolong, “Fellow cultivator might possess extraordinary strength, but the Netherworld is too dangerous right now! There is no need to throw your life away.”

He thought that no matter how strong Huang Xiaolong was, he wouldn’t be able to do a thing after entering the Netherworld.

“What does your daughter look like? I need the descriptions of her friends too.” Huang Xiaolong ignored Yin Qi and continued. He was planning to look for Zhu Chen in the Netherworld anyway. If he ran into them, he didn’t mind saving them.

Moreover, he wanted to learn the reason behind the damaged formation.

Yin Qi stared at him in shock for a moment. However, he eventually told Huang Xiaolong what he needed to know. “Fellow Cultivator Huang, the Netherworld is really very dangerous right now…”

Before he could complete his warning, Huang Xiaolong had already disappeared. A flash appeared on the other side of the seal he created, and he entered the sea of ferocious ghosts.

Yin Qi stared at the entrance to the Netherworld in fright.

“Lord… Perhaps… Perhaps Lord Huang will be able to save the young lady…” Yin Guan muttered.

“Unless Lord Gui Chi personally descends, there might not be any hope…” Yin Qi sighed. “A more important matter is at hand. Why did the formation stop working? Did any suspicious characters enter the Netherworld in the past few years?”

Yin Guan thought about it for a second before replying, “There were too many experts who entered the Netherworld. I didn’t notice any suspicious activity going on…”

…

After Huang Xiaolong entered the Netherworld, he glanced at the neverending wave of ferocious ghosts charging his way.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t use his universe treasures. Instead, he circulated his grand cosmos energy and a mysterious force surrounded his body. Every creature who came into contact with it died!

Every layer of the Netherworld was boundless, and ordinary cultivators wouldn’t be able to notice the path to the next layer. However, Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary cultivator! With his three great dao souls, he knew where he needed to go. He also managed to discover the presence of Yin Ping and the others.

At that moment, they were surrounded by ferocious ghosts in all directions. They were pushed to the limits as they tried to stay alive.

From what he knew, there were sixteen of them who entered the Netherworld. Looking at them now, there were four left.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
