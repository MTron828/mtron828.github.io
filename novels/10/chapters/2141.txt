Chapter 2142: And If I Don’t?

The little cow, King of Grandmist, and the others, who had been waiting on the side, relaxed when they saw Huang Xiaolong successfully take away the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool.

“The Chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool—got it! Now, only the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool left!” There was excitement in the little cow’s voice as she spoke.

The Spatial Domain Lightning Pool was the highest ranked lightning pool amongst the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools!

“The Spatial Domain Lightning Pool is not only the most powerful among the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools, but it is also the hardest to locate.” The King of Grandmist said and added, “It’s said that the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool moves between space domains and time. It can disappear to any place and different time. This makes it extremely difficult to detect it, much less capture it. Moreover, no one has ever seen the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as he listened.

It could be said that, even if the other eight chaos lightning pools were to be combined, their power would be still incomparable to the chaos Spatial Domain Lightning Pool. At the same time, the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool was also the most difficult to find.

Then again, no matter what, Huang Xiaolong was adamant about getting the chaos Spatial Domain Lightning Pool.

Of course, the more urgent matter at hand right now was to find a safe place to refine the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool.

Huang Xiaolong’s group barely left the location when Huang Xiaolong’s movements suddenly stopped.

The little cow and King of Grandmist were baffled. They were about to ask Huang Xiaolong what was going on when they noticed Huang Xiaolong looking towards the horizon, sneering coldly, “It looks like some people really don’t know how to give up.”

Huang Xiaolong barely finished his words, when over a dozen overwhelming auras rushed towards them that were akin to great tidal waves hitting the shore. These overwhelming auras directly affected the surroundings, turning the air within ten thousand li radius turbulent and chaotic. Even outside the ten thousand li radius, the little cow and King of Grandmist felt an invisible pressure compressing their bodies from all directions.

The little cow and the others immediately looked solemn.

“Are those people from the Heavenly Saint Country?” Cang Mutian guessed out loud.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and confirmed Cang Mutian’s guess, “It’s the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler.”

He had checked the dozens of auras coming at them, and one of the auras, the most powerful aura, was stronger than the Heavenly Master by a point. There was only one explanation for that, the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler has come personally.

“The Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler!” The little cow and the others exclaimed in shock. It had never occurred to them that the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler would come personally. He had seemingly brought the entire Heavenly Saint Country’s experts with him?!

“Xiaolong, why don’t we retreat first?” The King of Grandmist suggested with worry.

Although Huang Xiaolong had already advanced to the Sixth Order Sovereign Realm, the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler was an existence more powerful than the Heavenly Master. Not to mention, he had brought out all the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts with him.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No need.”

The Heavenly Saint Court’s ruler was the very person he was waiting for! Since the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler had come to the party with the entire army, that was even better. It saved Huang Xiaolong from running a few extra trips up and down.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong waited on the spot for the Heavenly Saint Country’s group’s arrival.

Living up to Huang Xiaolong’s expectations, the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts appeared on the horizon before long. The person leading them was a middle-aged man clad in a golden-scarlet armor. He had a tall and heavy build. His eyes were round and fearsome. A faint golden-scarlet light was threaded around his body, exuding a noble majesty.

An obscured light gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. This golden-scarlet-armored middle-aged man was very likely the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler. However, other than the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler, another person caught Huang Xiaolong’s attention. This person was a tall, old man, standing beside the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler.

This old man’s hair was akin to flowing ink-blue flames. He held a great halberd in his hand, and his body exuded a strong momentum that was comparable to the Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler. Though a little weaker than the ruler, he was a lot stronger than Wan Shi and Tian Chen.

The Heavenly Saint Country’s marshal?

From Wan Yue’s memories, Huang Xiaolong had learned the norms of hierarchy in heavenly countries in Heavens Path. Below the ruler was the marshal that commanded an army of several hundred million, and under the marshal were the generals.

Every heavenly countries’ marshal’s strength almost stood at par with the ruler.

While Huang Xiaolong and his group were scrutinizing the Heavenly Saint Country’s group members, the latter was doing the same.

Other than Huang Xiaolong’s prominent looks on the surface, nothing else stood out about him. Is this young man really someone, even the Heavenly Master, could not suppress? The Heavenly Saint Country’s ruler was inwardly perplexed.

Not only the Heavenly Saint Ruler thought so, but even Marshal Lan Shifan had a hint of confusion in his eyes.

A second later, the Heavenly Saint Country’s group stopped in front of Huang Xiaolong.

“Is it him?” The Heavenly Saint Ruler asked.

The Heavenly Saint Country’s General Zhu Xinyi stepped forward and answered respectfully, “Yes, Your Majesty. This is a person who sent the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s Xiong Gang flying in one move. This person is very likely to be that Huang Xiaolong.”

The Heavenly Saint Ruler nodded.

Marshal Lan Shifan stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong for some time, and then demanded, “Are you Huang Xiaolong? I have heard that even the Heavenly Master lost to you?” His tone clearly showed that he didn’t believe the news.

After all, the Heavenly Master was a peak late-Ninth Order Sovereign, one of the Heavens Path’s top ten experts. On top of that, they had also heard that Huang Xiaolong was the King of Grandmist’s recently accepted youngest disciple.

Lan Shifan took a glance at the King of Grandmist on the side. He knew of the King of Grandmist. Then again, the King of Grandmist was merely a Fifth Order Sovereign, so how strong could his disciple be?

“I am Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong admitted casually. “And I didn’t really defeat the Heavenly Master.”

Although the Heavenly Master had fallen downwind in their battle, he was not defeated. He had merely understood that if the battle was prolonged, he would lose in the end. Hence he had fled. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong was able to gain the upper hand at that time due to the lightning bead he had found in the Barbarians Space.

Then again, at Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, if he were to face the Heavenly Master again, the result would be vastly different.

Marshal Lan Shifan’s face eased slightly, hearing Huang Xiaolong admit that he had not defeated the Heavenly Master. It seems the rumor circulating about the Heavenly Master losing to Huang Xiaolong was nothing but a rumor. After all, no one had seen the actual battle between Huang Xiaolong and the Heavenly Master.

Lan Shifan went on, “Huang Xiaolong, you must have gotten the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool, right? You know what we are here for, so hand over the chaos Fifth Earth Lightning Pool and chaos Black Sea Lightning Pool to us.” He specifically added another sentence, “I advise you not to have other thoughts. Obediently hand the two chaos lightning pools as you’re told.”

“If you cooperate, we won’t make things difficult for you.”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t vexed in the slightest hearing Lan Shifan’s words. He looked meaningfully at Lan Shifan and said, “I do have the two chaos lightning pools you mentioned, but it depends on whether you’re capable of making me hand them over to you?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Lan Shifan shook his head in disappointment, “I know that you’re quite strong. Look around you. All of our Heavenly Saint Country’s experts are here. We can even suppress two Heavenly Masters with our combined strength., So you’d better hand over the two chaos lightning pools.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “And if I don’t?”

Lan Shifan’s gaze turned frosty in an instant as he barked, “If you don’t, then die!” A wave of tyrannical origin energy rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

“I look forward to it.” Huang Xiaolong retorted nonchalantly, and allowed the tyrannical origin energy from Lan Shifan to rush towards him, which was exuding pressure greater than a mountain.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s voice fell, Lan Shifan made his move, leaping off his beast mount. The halberd in his hand glistened sharply and fell above Huang Xiaolong’s head with the momentum of destroying yin and yang and splitting the sun and the moon with one hack.
