Chapter 2550: Your Appetite Is Too Big!

“Elder Cheng Feng!”

The Devil Palace experts cried out when they saw that the person, who had ambushed Huang Xiaolong, was sent to his death with a punch from Huang Xiaolong. On top of that, Huang Xiaolong had halved his holy soul with the Cangqiong Blade.

The Devil Palace experts’ eyes were bloodshot with fury and hatred, as they stared ferociously at Huang Xiaolong.

“Everyone join hands and kill Huang Xiaolong!”

"Kill him and the Cangqiong Blade is ours! As well as the Cangqiong Holy Pills!”

Several Devil Palace experts shouted loudly.

However, just as these Devil Palace experts renewed their attacks, a curtain of icy hail fell on them, freezing the dozen of Devil Palace experts attacking Huang Xiaolong. In the next second, a finger force directly pierced a bolt through these ice statues.

These dozen of Devil Palace experts’ bodies shattered into pieces of ice, and their holy souls were no exception.

Other experts faces paled in dread as countless gazes turned towards the Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun. The person, who made a move just now was none other than Xue Lingyun.

In a single move, a dozen True Saint Realm experts had lost their lives in vain.

This was the power of a Primal Ancestor expert!

Everyone felt a frigid wind blowing across their hearts.

Other Devil Palace experts retreated in fear, although they were brave and courageous, that did not mean they weren’t afraid of death.

“Palace Master Xue Lingyun, do you really plan to oppose our Devil Palace?” One of the Devil Palace hall masters mustered up some courage and questioned Xue Lingyun.

Xue Lingyun didn’t even spare a glance at that person. Her gaze swept over other forces’ experts who were itching to make a move, and her expression was as cold as her voice, “Huang Xiaolong is the successor of my godfather. Cangqiong Old Man has selected him, and therefore, he is my Junior Brother. Whoever dares to block Huang Xiaolong’s path will be considered as going against me, Xue Lingyun, and going against the Holy Heavens!”

Xue Lingyun’s words were not brimming with killing intent, but given her cold temperament, her words hit like an ice pick.

It chilled everyone to the soul.

Those secretly making moves to block Huang Xiaolong stopped their actions abruptly.

Only then did the present experts remember that Huang Xiaolong had another identity, Xue Lingyun’s Junior Brother.

Although the Holy Heavens’ four Primal Ancestors were absent, Xue Lingyun was there! The Clear Snow Palace experts were there!

The Clear Snow Palace’s Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and other experts’ gazes immediately swept across the other experts, as they prepared to battle if needed.

The Holy Lands Alliance experts turned to Mo Cangli, but Mo Cangli remained silent and had a deadpan expression on his face. Those experts, who had received Huai Po’s signal and had prepared to attack, ceased their thoughts.

In a sway, Huang Xiaolong’s figure shot across space and entered the Saint Fate’s boundary.

Seeing this, the Devil Palace’s experts and others, who wanted to secretly hinder Huang Xiaolong, immediately regretted that they had not stopped Huang Xiaolong at all cost.

Everything was too late.

Huai Po’s heart sank to the bottom of the sea, seeing that Huang Xiaolong had enter Saint Fate’s boundary.

Just as Huang Xiaolong appeared within the Saint Fate’s boundary, seemingly stimulated by something in Huang Xiaolong’s body, the Crimson Pool Star’s sky once again lit up with blinding light like never before. It immediately attracted everyone’s attention. On the other end of the nine high-order Saint Fates that had appeared were three additional high-order Saint Fates! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Three at once!

Moreover, there were three high-order Saint Fates!

Counting the initial nine, there were a total of twelve high-order Saint Fates!

Twelve!

Everyone’s head spun, threatening to faint into oblivion.

Twelve high-order Saint Fates, this…!

All in all, there were three low-order, six mid-order, and twelve high-order Saint Fates!

This had exceeded everyone’s estimation, imagination, and scope of understanding by many times over.

At the same time, when the three additional high-order Saint Fates appeared in the Cambrian Pool Star’s sky, all the Saint Fates shone in mesmerizing splendor.

The grand dao repelling energy protecting them disappeared simultaneously.

Grab!

This was the first thought of all Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm disciples within the Saint Fate’s boundary.

Amongst them, one person made the swiftest action, and with a turn of his wrist, he reached for one of the high-order Saint Fates.

This person was naturally Huai Po.

Seeing that Huai Po’s fingers were about to reach one of the high-order Saint Fates as he planned to pull it down from the void, a finger force cut off the suction force from Huai Po’s palm. On top of that, Huai Po tumbled backwards due to the finger force’s overwhelming impact.

Huai Po turned and glared at Huang Xiaolong with haterade. “Huang Xiaolong, what is the meaning of this?!!”

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as he stated, “All high-order Saint Fates belong to Lin Xiaoying and me. If any other person touches them, they will die!”

His voice resounded through the entire Saint Fate’s boundary.

Hearing that, Huai Po let out a sonorous laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, your appetite’s too big. I’m afraid you won’t be able to swallow them all, and you might choke to death! Since you are saying that these twelve high-order Saint Fates belong to you and Lin Xiaoying, then are you planning to become an enemy against every disciple here? Become an enemy against the world?”

Huai Po was trying to sow discord between Huang Xiaolong and everyone else within the Saint Fate’s boundary, pushing him to the opposite side of all the disciples.

How could Huang Xiaolong not see Huai Po’s intention that was so obvious, but Huang Xiaolong was nonchalant, “So what if I become enemies with everyone here? Enemies with the world?”

Everyone was dazed for a moment.

Huang Xiaolong’s retort successfully lit up more than a few superpowers’ disciples’ furies.

“Huang Xiaolong, I admit that your talent is excellent, but we’re inside the Saint Fate’s boundary, so you cannot use your holy souls, or dao artifacts, and only your peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint strength. Still, you have the guts to provoke all of us? You are overestimated yourself!”

A Ghost Talisman Holy Gate peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint disciple Xiao Chongshan couldn’t stop himself from reprimanding Huang Xiaolong, and pointing his finger at Huang Xiaolong’s face.

With Xiao Chongshan taking the lead, many superpowers’ disciples followed in reprimanding Huang Xiaolong.

“Everyone attack together, and snatch the high-order Saint Fates, I want to see if Huang Xiaolong really dares to attack us. If he dares, we’ll unite against this common enemy, suppress him!” Huai Po cried out.

As he finished saying that, Huai Po attacked again, aiming at one of the high-order Saint Fates. Xiao Chongshan and other peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm disciples all had their own targets.

However, just as Huai Po, Xiao Chongshan, and others made their moves, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred in a few sways, and with every sway, a disciple exploded to his death!

In a short while, those twenty-plus disciples, attempting to snatch high-order Saint Fates, turned into a fog of blood!

Only Huai Po remained!

Of course, Huai Po felt as if he was hit by a great mountain, as he was knocked off his feet, and he coughed up blood.

There was heavy silence all around.

Everyone was wide-eyed with shock, looking at the blood fog that used to be peak late-Ninth Tribulations half-True Saint Realm disciples. Gui Buwang's expression was sullen to the extreme. Although Xiao Chongshan couldn’t be compared to You Lingzhi who had died in the Trial of Blood, he was still a valued core disciple of the Ghost Talisman Holy Gate. Huang Xiaolong had actually killed him without hesitation!

Having similar thoughts to Gui Buwang were the forces of the fallen disciples, and they were also slightly astonished by Huang Xiaolong's strength.

After seeing Huang Xiaolong kill more than twenty peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint disciples in a short few seconds had a big impact on Mo Cangli.
