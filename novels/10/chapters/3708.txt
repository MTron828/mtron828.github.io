Chapter 3709: Controlling the Snow City

A frown formed on Pangu’s face as he looked at them. “What do you think you’re doing?”

One of the half-step Universe Gods who was approaching said, “Let me tell you the rules governing this place.”

“Rules?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow slowly.

A sneer left the lips of the half-step Universe God. “Everyone who comes in here is a slave. All of you will have to listen to my order! I am your leader and those who refuse to listen to me will be tortured until they submit!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Pangu and a trace of amusement flashed through his eyes. Reaching out slightly, Huang Xiaolong dragged the man over. “Listen to your order? I refuse.” He looked at the hundred-odd God of Creation Realm experts behind the man and asked, “What can you do to me?”

All of them stared at him in shock. The half-step Universe God who spoke earlier was the strongest among them! He could take on three to four other experts at the half-step Universe God Realm, but he was like a dead chicken in Huang Xiaolong’s hand!

The half-step Universe God was equally as shocked as he stared at Huang Xiaolong in terror. He could tell that Huang Xiaolong was at the peak of the grand completion stage. How can he be so damn strong?!

“There’s no need to be afraid! No matter how strong he is, he’s alone! Attack! Kill him!” The half-step Universe God yelled, “I’ll explain to Lord Yin Xue if anything goes wrong! Kill him now!”

Everyone charged at Huang Xiaolong when they heard what he said.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely indifferent when he looked at the number of people rushing towards him. With a wave of his arm, everyone was sent flying at the same time.

Not a single person managed to resist his strength.

When they finally slammed into the ground, miserable cries rang through the air.

The half-step Universe God stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. There was a trace of fear in his eyes. How could anyone injure so many Gods of Creation at the same time?!

Wouldn’t that mean that he was already…

“Do you really think that you can kill me?” Huang Xiaolong growled.

“Lord… I… I know my mistakes.” The half-step Universe God felt the expression on his face turning rigid.

“You’ll have to face the consequences of your actions,” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he popped the half-step Universe God with a squeeze of his hand.

The hearts of everyone present turned cold when they witnessed the scene.

Throwing the dao soul of the half-step Universe God into the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong laid down restrictions in the souls of the others.

When he was finally done, he looked at Pangu and chuckled, “Master, shall we take a stroll around the city?”

“Alright!”

With Huang Xiaolong around, there was nothing he would be afraid of.

As such, the two of them passed through the restriction in the prison and arrived in the city above.

Before leaving, Huang Xiaolong helped Pangu to alter his appearance and aura.

The Snow City was extremely pretty.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had been to countless cities, none of them could hold a candle to Snow City they were in.

Every single structure in the Snow City was made from frosted metal essence. There wasn’t a single trace of impurity around.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong discovered that everyone in the city seemed to be pretty busy.

As Snow City wasn’t the capital of the Snow Continent, Yin Xue’s manor wasn’t situated in the city.

The Snow Continent spanned countless miles, and the highest ruler of the region was Yin Xue!

She was an expert who broke through the 20 billion barrier, and she was also the oldest disciple of the Heaven Devouring King. Her position in the Universe First Race wasn’t low, and she could easily rank in the top twenties.

Of course, her strength closed in on the 22 billion mark. She wasn’t an expert who barely crossed the threshold.

She was comparable to Zhu Chen of the Unknown Space!

After Huang Xiaolong scanned through the memories of those who captured Pangu, he realized that Yin Xue wasn’t in the city. No one had any idea where she went.

Naturally, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a rush. She would definitely return in the next few years. He would capture her and control her when the time came. Due to her position, he would be able to learn a lot of valuable information on the Universe First Race after he looked through her memories.

Even if she had no idea who was setting up the Extermination Formation, there should definitely be some traces of information about what was going on.

The only thing left to do was for Huang Xiaolong to gain control of the entire city before she returned.

After casually strolling about with Pangu for a little bit, they arrived in the main manor in the city. Without a word, he controlled the city lord.

As Snow City was one of the more important cities in the Snow Continent, the city lord wasn't too weak. He was an expert with 16 billion units of combat strength. It was too bad he was no weaker than an ant before Huang Xiaolong.

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong would explore the continent when he had nothing to do. He would bring Pangu around and Huang Xiaolong would control several experts who were in important positions in Yin Xue’s territory.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong was comprehending the mysteries behind the Nameless Devil Mirror when they sent him a report. They said that Yin Xue was about to return to the city. She would be back in a month at most, but she wasn’t the only one coming back. There were a bunch of experts of the Universe First Race coming along.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Do you know who they are?”

The experts who made the report shook their heads.

“Lord Yin Xue told us to prepare the banquet to welcome the guests,” one of them said.

Huang Xiaolong asked several of them the same question and after sending them away to reply Yin Xue, he went around to lay down the Star Dragon Grand Formation.

Even though he had no idea who would be coming, he investigated the members of the Universe First Race since he entered the Universe Vault. He could guess who would be coming with her.

The people who would travel with her would probably be experts who crossed the 20 billion mark. There were thirty of such experts in the Universe First Race, but there were only so many who had a good relationship with Yin Xue.
