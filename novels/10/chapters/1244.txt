Black Ice Ancestor had no way to refute Blood Knife Ancestor’s words. In order to save herself from humiliation, Black Ice Ancestor said coldly after a brief pause, “If he wins the first place in this term’s New Disciples Battle, I will definitely request the Sect Chief to increase his benefits, regardless of your suggestions!”

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor frowned at her words. Win first place in this term’s New Disciples Battle?

Anyone knows of Wangu Ziyi’s strength, hence he was the popular and uncontested choice for first place in most people’s mind. Black Ice Ancestor demanding Huang Xiaolong to win first place was requesting for something impossible.

Black Ice Ancestor sighed to herself in relief at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s expressions.

Black Ice Ancestor suddenly recalled the time when Huang Xiaolong had broken through to peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm, and she had lost the bet with Blood Knife Ancestor. At that time, Blood Knife Ancestor had taken kt one of her most precious treasures, the Profound Ice Armor. This had made her heart bleed blood.

She had collected numerous precious chaos grade materials over a hundred thousand years to forge that Profound Ice Armor. Moreover, in order to forge the Profound Ice Armor, she had invited a master above Ancestor God Realm which had cost her over ten trillion ah!

Over ten trillion ah!

“Blood Knife, I had lost a bet with you at the time when Huang Xiaolong broke through to Ancient God Realm. How about we make another bet this time?” Black Ice Ancestor continued to tempt Blood Knife Ancestor, “If Huang Xiaolong manages to win the first place during this term, then you can select one thing from inside my Black Ice treasury; however, if you lose, I want the Profound Ice Armor back as well as your spiritual blood pool!”

Black Ice Ancestor stared fixedly at Blood Knife Ancestor with a burning gaze.

Blood Knife Ancestor blurted out without thinking, “Not betting!”

Everyone knew it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to win the first place in the New Disciples Battle, therefore Blood Knife Ancestor was not sick in the head to bet with Black Ice Ancestor on this.

“Choose two items?” Black Ice Ancestor was unwilling to give up.

But Blood Knife Ancestor shook his head as he declined her offer. Even after Black Ice Ancestor had increased to four items from her treasury, he still shook his head in refusal.

In the meantime, Wang Shi had already announced Huang Xiaolong’s victory in the first match and Huang Xiaolong had returned to the Fortune Gate’s viewing stage.

Naturally, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, and Myriad Flames Ancestor said a few words of praise to Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong stood beside Li Lu, secretly holding her small hand.

A faint pink hue crept up her face. She gave Huang Xiaolong a fierce stare and pulled her hand out from his hold.

In the subsequent second, third and fourth matches, everything went smoothly. Zhou Xu, Tan Lin, Luo Yunjie, Wu Qian’er, Guo Yuanhui successfully entered into the top twenty. Six disciples also entered successfully into the next round from the Eternal Mainland; five disciples from the Dark Elf Tribe; and the Primal Chaos Mainland had a lower number, merely three disciples.

Huang Xiaolong and the others went up once again to draw lots to determine their opponents for the second round match. Unlike the first round match, this time, Huang Xiaolong didn’t draw the stick with a number one inscribed on it, however, he drew a stick with a number two inscribed on it.

Number two? Huang Xiaolng’s gaze swept over the rest of the participants’ sticks and he discovered that another stick for the second number was actually in Dark Elf Mainland’s You Wuxin’s hand.

Wangu Ziyi, You Wuxin, and Huang Xiaolong were the three disciples everyone paid the most attention to, therefore, when Huang Xiaolong and You Wuxin drew the sticks for the second lot, the crowd stirred with excitement.

“Huang Xiaolong is actually going to battle You Wuxin in the second round, and it’s another fight between two number ones, this is simply too exciting!”

“Although Huang Xiaolong’s strength is startling, he most likely will lose in this round. I have heard that You Wuxin had entered into the Dark Elf Tribe’s perilous land and also the Capital of the Ghost Domain, while surviving a hellish training. Half a year ago, he also broke through to late-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm, not to mention, he received the Capital of the Ghost Domain King’s inheritance!”

“That is not necessary, Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique is very strong!”

“It’s true Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique is very strong, however, You Wuxin has succeeded in cultivating the Ghost Domain’s Ghost Body that is as strong as Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique!”

Even though Huang Xiaolong and You Wuxin were yet to start their battle, the crowd below was already in a furor.

On the viewing stage, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, and even Myriad Flames Ancestor were frowning.

‘In the second round, Huang Xiaolong’s opponent is going to be You Wuxin?’ Like most of the experts in the crowd, they were also concerned. Even though Huang Xiaolong was quite strong, he was still lacking by a mile as compared to You Wuxin.

If Huang Xiaolong were to lose this match, he won’t even enter the top ten!

“This matter must be investigated.” Golden Brow Ancestor stated solemnly. ‘In the first round, Huang Xiaolong’s opponent was Gu Jiannan, and in the second round, his opponent is You Wuxin!’

Both Gu Jiannan and You Wuxin were among the more powerful participants, as both of them were ranked as number one disciples in their respective mainlands.

This cannot be a coincidence!

Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor and Myriad Flames Ancestor read the underlying meaning of what Golden Brow Ancestor just said—DidWang Shi tamper with the lots? Sky Sword Ancestor sounded solemn as he defended, "Wang Shi is one of our Fortune Gate’s people, he won’t do this, right?"

Myriad Flames Ancestor also felt that it was impossible for Wang Shi to do so.

Black Ice Ancestor agreed loudly, "Although the stage battles are overseen by Wang Shi, Huang Xiaolong is the one drawing the lots. This can only be attributed to his bad luck and has nothing to do with Wang Shi."

Black Ice Ancestor’s heart bloomed like a flower when Huang Xiaolong actually drew You Wuxin as his opponent. However, she kept calm on the surface as it wouldn’t be appropriate to show her delight in front of Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

"Whether it is his bad luck or a scheme against him, we’ll know after investigation." Golden Brow Ancestor stated indifferently.

The second round’s first match was between Zhou Xu and a Wangu Clan disciple named Wangu Chang.

Huang Xiaolong and the others retreated back to their respective viewing stages, leaving behind Zhou Xu and Wangu Chang on the battle stage.

Back on the viewing stage, Blood Knife Ancestor said majestically, “You do not need to get under too much pressure or feel stressed when battling You Wuxin, just do your best.”

Golden Brow Ancestor added, “Just make use of the advantages of your True Dragon Physique, and you might be able to fight with him to a draw!”

A wry smile rose to Huang Xiaolong’s face. Don’t feel too much pressure or feel stressed? He looked far from being stressed or feeling like he was under pressure. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Yes, two Masters don’t worry. I will do my best.” Huang Xiaolong could only reply so, while thinking if he should display his full strength?

At this time, Li Lu reached out to hold Huang Xiaolong’s hand. He saw the worry in her eyes. Huang Xiaolong gave her a reassuring smile.

All of a sudden, the crowd exclaimed. On the battle stage, Zhou Xu and Wangu Chang made their moves; the momentum from Zhou Xu’s body was alarming. An enormous azure dragon floated out from his body and attacked Wangu Chang as numerous rays of sword qi shot out from its body. In an instant, Wangu Chang, a late-Third Order Ancient God Realm was forced back repeatedly.

“Good!” Black Ice Ancestor smiled and nodded, “This Zhou Xu is indeed our Fortune Gate’s number one disciple, he actually broke through to Fourth Order Ancient God Realm in such a short time! He has successfully created some unique sword qi by integrating the Sky Sword Canon with his azure dragon, right? It’s power is indeed amazing!”

Sky Sword Ancestor smiled happily and said, “Zhou Xu’s compression in sword cultivation is very high.” Zhou Xu was Sky Sword Ancestor’s disciple, and he also felt happy when his disciple performed well.

Few moments later, Wangu Chang was injured by Zhou Xu’s azure dragon sword qi and fell off the battle stage. Zhou Xu won the battle easily by using merely six moves, from the beginning until the end.

Zhou Xu returned to the viewing stage accompanied by loud cheers. He glanced in Huang Xiaolong’s direction, the provocation and smugness in his eyes were very obvious.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent to Zhou Xu’s provocation. He descended onto the stage in a single leap almost at the same time as You Wuxin.

The crowd immediately quieted down.
