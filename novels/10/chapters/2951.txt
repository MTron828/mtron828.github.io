Chapter 2952: The Frost Eye Race’s Treasury

When Huang Xiaolong stepped out of his chariot, he immediately spotted Feng Yue’s group that seemed to have been waiting for a long time. Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong quickly flew towards them.

Feng Yue cheered up when she saw Huang Xiaolong, and she hurried forward with Elder Tong to greet Huang Xiaolong.

“We greet Your Highness Huang Xiaolong!”

Stopping meters away from Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and dozens of people saluted him respectfully. Based on Huang Xiaolong’s current identity, even existences like the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng, and Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun had to salute Huang Xiaolong with respect, much less them.

Feng Yue also saluted Huang Xiaolong with respect.

Huang Xiaolong had everyone rise, and said apologetically, “Young Lady Feng Yue, I have made everyone wait for a long time, haven’t I? I have been studying some pill refining methods. Hence, I was a bit delayed.”

Feng Yue quickly shook her head and denied, “Not at all. Your Highness need not feel apologetic because we just arrived today as well.”

Elder Tong smiled wryly in her head. We just arrived today? We’ve been here for almost two weeks.

But since the young lady said so, it was inappropriate for her to say otherwise.

Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yue’s group proceeded onwards as they talked.

The Frost Eye Race’s treasury was located in a certain sacred land within the Immortal Creed’s territory. It would take them ten days or so to reach the said location.

Right at this time, Elder Tong suddenly spoke, “These two beasts pulling Your Highness’ chariots are probably late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, or maybe even peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm experts, right?”

Others were astonished by Elder Tong’s question, and couldn’t help turning to look at the two fierce beasts pulling Huang Xiaolong’s chariot.

Because both beasts had converged their auras, Feng Yue and the others didn't pay much attention to them, and were astonished after hearing Elder Tong point it out.

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly, “Just two beasts I tamed along the way.”

Although Huang Xiaolong did not say more, his answer indirectly admitted that the two beasts were late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, or maybe even peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable experts. Feng Yue and the others were visibly astonished now.

But there was also a sense of speechlessness when Huang Xiaolong said that he had tamed them.

Naturally, no one fully believed that Huang Xiaolong had really tamed the two beasts casually. After all, these two were at least late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm fierce beasts. It would take a lot of time and effort even for a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable to tame these two fierce beasts.

Huang Xiaolong then added, “But these two beasts’ speed is still a little slow. After finding the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, I plan to replace them with a few Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable beasts.”

Everyone’s heart quivered, and they were utterly speechless.

Some people actually disdain the speed of two late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm beasts?! And plan to get a few Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm beasts to replace them?!

A few beasts!

Despite being aware of Huang Xiaolong’s identity, Elder Tong couldn’t help thinking that Huang Xiaolong was bragging too much.

In the entire Divine Tuo Holy World, only a small number of people had Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm beasts for transportation, not to mention, having a few of them.

Moreover, which great expert who had Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm fierce beasts had not spent ten millions years, or even a hundred million years, to tame it? Which of them could upgrade them as they pleased like Huang Xiaolong?

Then, Huang Xiaolong added another sentence, “If Young Lady Feng Yue likes this beast chariot, I’ll send it to Young Lady Feng Yue as a gift.”

Everyone was flabbergasted.

Feng Yue looked at the beast chariot dazedly, feeling a little tongue-tied, “You…want to give this beast chariot to me? Including the two beasts?”

These were two late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, or maybe even peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm fierce beasts they were talking about.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Yes.”

He wasn’t joking. Although Feng Yue had invited him to open the Frost Eye Race’s treasury because of his absolute frost power, at the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong owed her a favor.

She had waited almost a hundred years because he was entangled by other affairs. Therefore, sending the beast chariot to Feng Yue was considered as compensation for that.

Elder Tong and the others thought Huang Xiaolong was joking, but watching him nodding his head seriously, they didn’t know what to think.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, this is too valuable.” Feng Yue shook her head, ready to decline.

“In your opinion, it’s valuable, but to me, fierce beasts like these can be tamed at any time. So, it’s nothing much,” Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “You invited me to open the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, and I’ve made you wait a hundred years. So, consider this beast chariot as my compensation to you.”

Compensation? Elder Tong and the others exchanged glances.

“I accept!” Then, Feng Yue gritted her teeth and nodded, “Since Your Highness is giving them to me, then I’ll accept them.”

She accepted the beast chariot not because of the two beasts, but purely because Huang Xiaolong gave them to her!

Huang Xiaolong gave, so she accepted!

After Feng Yue agreed to accept the beast chariot, Huang Xiaolong taught Feng Yue the method to control them, traveling onward as they talked.

Elder Tong watched their backs, walking side by side, and talking harmoniously, feeling happy and comforted.

Several days later, the group stopped above an icefield of a land.

At a glance, ice could be seen everywhere in this secret land. Up in the sky, and down on the ground, the rivers, mountains, trees, cities, everything was frost and ice, exuding a soft icy blue glow. The entire sacred land resembled an icy blue sea of snow. It was a mesmerizing scenery.

Frozen Sea Sacred Land!

This was the name of this sacred land, and also their destination this time.

The Frozen Sea Sacred Land’s bitter coldness was especially overbearing, and even high-level Primal Ancestors had a hard time resisting the frost qi. Hence, very few people could be found in the whole sacred land.

Feng Yue took out the Eye of Frost and said to Huang Xiaolong, “From here on, I’ll trouble Your Highness to sense the treasury’s location.”

Huang Xiaolong took the Eye of Frost. “I already told you to call me by my name. There is no need to be so rigid with the rules.”

Feng Yue hesitated and gathered a bit of courage, “Then, I’ll call you Xiaolong?” Her heart raced as she spoke, and after seeing that there was no anger on Huang Xiaolong’s face, she relaxed.

Huang Xiaolong held the Eye of Frost in his right hand, and circulated the power of absolute frost. The Eye of Frost gradually emitted rings of blue light.

“That way!” Huang Xiaolong pointed in one direction according to what he sensed, and then flew in that direction with the rest.

Not long after the group left, a bright light flashed above the Frozen Sea Sacred Land as a group of people stepped out from the void. This group of people had an ice-frost rune on their foreheads, indicating that they were experts from the same race.

The young man leading the group took out an icy blue orb which looked exactly the same as the Eye of Frost Feng Yue had!

“Ancestor Xuan, I will trouble you to sense the location of the treasury,” The young man respectfully requested an elderly old man with snowy white eyebrows.

The old man addressed as Ancestor Xuan nodded and held the Eye of Frost in his hand. An icy blue light emerged from his palm, and this was the power of absolute frost! And the old man was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert!

“That way!” Ancestor Xuan said as he pointed in one direction. And this direction was the same direction Huang Xiaolong’s group had set off in.

“Excellent!” The young man’s eyes shone, and he smiled as he said, “Once we find our Frost Eye Race’s treasury, and our Frost Eye Race’s Holy Staff, it won’t be long till our race returns to glory! There will be no need to fear the Holy Dragon Race or the Heavenly Phoenix Race anymore!”

The group sped off moments later, flying at high speed behind Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yue, and the rest stopped in front of an ice peak.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
