“Special identity? You have other identities?!” The Ascending Moon Old Man yelled in shock.

“Little brat, don’t tell me that you’re the young master of the Fortune Emperor Palace!” The old man chuckled but failed to hide his shock.

Huang Xiaolong finally came clean, and he explained, “Actually, I’m the junior brother of the number one expert of the Divine World, the Grandmist Emperor. I have another master, and he is the King of Grandmist.”

The Ascending Moon Old Man felt his body going stiff, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong with his mouth agape.

Xie Puti, Fei Hou, and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong, and none of them knew how to react.

The junior brother of the number one expert in the Divine World!

He has another master, the King of Grandmist!

In fact, some of them failed to hear Huang Xiaolong’s complete sentence due to the shock they received.

As night fell, the silver moon hung high in the sky as it illuminated the earth with a soft silvery glow.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t calm his heart down to cultivate, and he stood on the top of the mountain peak located in the main palace of the Fortune Emperor Palace as he stared into the horizon. He thought about his parents, Shi Xiaofei, and his sister, Huang Min.

“Are they doing well? Where are they...” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Ever since returning to the Divine World, Huang Xiaolong had never stopped thinking about his family members. No matter how hard he tried, he failed to calm his heart.

The Divine World was boundless. He could only rely on the Silver Fox Commerce, Grandmist Emperor Palace, Martial Demon Emperor Palace, and the Netherworld King’s Organization for help.

Thinking about the messy situation the Divine World was in, Huang Xiaolong’s worry grew deeper.

Even though the Devil World’s invasion was being held back by the heavenly troops and the Divine World looked calm on the surface, Huang Xiaolong knew that it was merely the calm before the storm.

Looking at the incident that happened to Fang Gan and other Emperor Realm experts, Huang Xiaolong knew that the Nine Yin Corpse Giant Tribe had already infiltrated deep into the Divine World.

As soon as Shi Ming would complete the refinement of his peak-grade grandmist artifact, the Blade of Death, Huang Xiaolong had no doubts that he would kill his way to the Divine World. There would no longer be peace in the Divine World after the start of the battle. Huang Xiaolong knew that he had to locate his family members before that were to happen.

Previously, his goal was to obtain the other half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance. Right now, he felt that he had no choice but to delay his search for it.

......

There was a tiny world surface located south of the Fire Stone World.

On one of the ore veins located in the very south of the tiny divine plane, several ragged-looking Highgod Realm experts were blasting the ground with all their might as they tried to extract some of the metal from under the earth.

There were forty to fifty thousand Highgod Realm experts, and the weakest of them was already at the mid-level Highgod Realm. The strongest individual there was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm.

Several Heavenly Gods were staring at the group of Highgod laborers in the distance, and all of them held metal whips in their hands.

“Hurry up! Tomorrow is the last day of the month! If you fail to extract ten catties of gold, you’ll be in trouble!” One of the Heavenly Gods snapped at the Highgods below them.

As one of the Fifth Order Highgods took a short break to catch his breath, a metal ship smashed into his back and ripped his flesh apart. He fell to the ground as he cried out in pain.

The metal whips weren’t an ordinary divine artifact. They were made from metal essence from the Ghost World, and it would send yin energy to attack the victim’s soul in addition to the damage it caused to their body.

“Anyone who slacks off will be given more lashes! Hurry up!” The Heavenly God retrieved his metal whip and sneered at the Highgods. “Don’t blame me for not warning you...”

“Hurry up and dig!”

The Fifth Order Highgod Realm cultivator crawled to his feet, and he didn’t dare to say a word. He lowered his head as he continued to dig.

After witnessing the scene of the poor soul before them, everyone sped up.

If Huang Xiaolong was present, he would realize that his Huang Family members were among those who were part of the labor force, and they were merely several feet from the Highgod who had been lashed.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Min, Guo Tai, Guo Xiaofan, Shi Fantian... All of them were present.

All of them were no different from beggars on the street as their clothes were tattered, and their faces were muddy. They looked extremely haggard, and due to the constant digging, all of their godforce was worn out.

The only person who was missing was Shi Xiaofei.

Several tens of years ago, when Huang Peng and the others had ascended to the Divine World, Shi Xiaofei was blown away when they had run into a hurricane. Since then, all of them had been separated.

After several hours, the night finally fell.

“Enough. Stop and take a one hour break.” One of the Heavenly Gods yelled.

In an instant, all the Highgod Realm cultivators in the mine crumpled to the ground. They panted like dogs as they sucked in mouthfuls after mouthfuls of air.

Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others fell to the ground, and they felt as though all the energy in their body had left them.

When they had appeared on the Fire Stone World, none of them had managed to gather the godforce in their body before they were captured by a bunch of disciples from the Earth Splitting Gang.

The Earth Splitting Gang was a second rate power in the Fire Stone World, and they refined weapons for a living.

All the divine artifacts they made were sold to the first-rate families in the Fire Stone World.

Even though they were merely a second-rate power, they weren’t people Huang Peng and the others who had just ascended could go up against.

After falling into the hands of the Earth Splitting Gang, all of them were sent to the mines. Ten years had passed slowly, as all of them were separated from the outside world.

For ten years, all of them were only able to rest for a single hour before they were forced to dig for another day. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the eyes of the Earth Splitting Gang, these Highgods were nothing more than slaves.

“It’s been ten years... I wonder how sister-in-law is doing.” Huang Min sighed. “I wonder where big brother is! If this goes on, I’m afraid we won’t be able to see big brother even after ten thousand years!”

Of course, the sister-in-law she was referring to was Shi Xiaofei.

A trace of hatred flashed through Guo Xiaofan’s eyes. “This is all my fault. If not for my insistence to ascend to the Divine World, none of you would be trapped in this godforsaken land...”

Huang Peng frowned. “We don’t even know if Xiaolong knows that we have ascended to the Divine World. Even if he knows, the Divine World is boundless, and it won’t be easy for him to locate us. Even if he finds us, he might not be able to save us!”

Even though the Earth Splitting Gang was a second rate power in the Fire Stone World, they had been in existence for several millions of years. Their foundations were deep, and they had countless Heavenly Gods under them. Not to mention they had lots of Ancient Gods, Ancestor Gods, and God Kings. They even had a Heavenly Monarch leader to hold the fort!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had ascended for several hundred years, none of them believed that he would be able to go against the Earth Splitting Gang.

Just as they were taking a break and catching their breath, the Heavenly Gods who were in charge of watching them, started discussing a particular topic, and their voices traveled into the ears of Huang Peng and the others.

“I’ve heard that Huang Xiaolong went to the Devil World. He managed to get his hands on the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and the Glaze Devil Stele.”

“Huang Xiaolong’s talent is through the roof! His luck isn’t any worse than his talent... If only I had one ten thousandths of his talent and luck... I’ll be more than content.”
