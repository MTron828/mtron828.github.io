Riding on the Thunder Bone Tiger, Huang Xiaolong descended on the top of the Giant Wolf Peak.

On top of the mountain peak was a cluster of over ten palaces, enshrouded in abundant spiritual energy. Spiritual floras of myriad colors were planted around these palaces that were organized neatly, adding a different flavor to the scenery.

Huang Xiaolong went to the most central cultivation palace and stood in front of its entrance. Above the colossal entrance were ancient texts —Wolfless Palace.

“Wolfless Palace?” Huang Xiaolong smiled as he read the name. Luo Haoming’s naming sense for his cultivation palace was unique and somewhat interesting.

‘Giant Wolf’ and ‘Wolfless’ were such a contradiction. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Huang Xiaolong took out a jade token that he had found inside Luo Haoming’s spatial ring after killing him. It was the key to opening the Wolfless Palace.

Huang Xiaolong infused his godforce into the jade token, then flicked the jade token into a groove slightly above the Wolfless Palace’s entrance. The Wolfless Palace and the surrounding palace building instantly emitted glimmering lights as the entrance slowly opened.

When the Wolfless Palace entrance fully opened, Huang Xiaolong collected the jade token with his palm’s suction force from the groove in the wall and walked into the Wolfless Palace.

Once inside, Huang Xiaolong noticed the Wolfless Palace was a different world altogether. A rare spiritual spring flowed through the garden. There were also various precious spiritual fruit trees growing in this garden that glistened like jewels. It was like a personal paradise.

Luo Haoming had made a great effort to collect this good stuff.

Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction at the Wolfless Palace’s environment, filled with rich spiritual energy. Just this one cultivation palace would make other super forces’ Emperor Realm Ancestors green with envy.

Huang Xiaolong took a stroll around the Wolfless Palace and the connecting palace buildings. There was a spiritual vein buried under the Wolfless Palace. With this spiritual vein as the primary energy source, Luo Haoming had laid out ancient chain formation arrays that connected the several palace buildings with excellent defenses and attack power.

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong was back at the main Wolfless Palace.

There were more than a dozen rooms within the Wolfless Palace.

The rooms were a little too much as there was only Luo Haoming cultivating in the Wolfless Palace.

Huang Xiaolong picked a room he liked in the Wolfless Palace and sat cross-legged inside it. After considering some matters, he took out his communication talisman. He issued an order to Desolate Giant Tai Yue to investigate the secret method of entering the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury. He also ordered him to check if there was a possibility of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Chu Han leaving the tribe’s headquarters.

As days passed, the Battle of the Heavenly Court drew closer. There were less than ten years now; thus Huang Xiaolong needed to hurry up and find a source of grandmist aura. That way, his Grandmist Parasitic Medium would be able to advance to the fourth stage a day earlier.

The earlier he obtained a new source of grandmist aura, the greater his hope of breaking through to early Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm would be, before the Battle of the Heavenly Court commenced.

If another seven or eight years were to pass, it would be useless even if he found a source of grandmist aura for he wouldn’t be able to advance to the fourth stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium before the battle. There wasn’t enough time.

Although his Senior Brother Jiang Hong had said that there was a chance he could win the Battle of the Heavenly Court’s first place if his cultivation advanced to the early Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, it was merely a chance. If he could break through to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, then the first place was guaranteed to be his. He could defeat the rest of the Divine World’s geniuses and snatch the first place with undefeatable momentum!

After Huang Xiaolong sent his orders out, he activated the Wolfless Palace’s defensive formations. He took out three hundred Brilliant Sun Divine Pills and summoned his three avatars as they began another round of cultivation.

What he needed to do now was cultivate and wait.

While waiting, he needed to improve his strength as fast as he could.

.......

The night passed peacefully.

The first ray of sunlight peeked over the horizon.

Huang Xiaolong had just finished refining the three hundred Brilliant Sun Divine Pills when a thunderous boom shook the whole Giant Wolf Peak. The Wolfless Palace and other buildings swayed unsteadily.

Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted. What’s going in? Someone has the guts to attack a Grand Elder’s residence palace right at the center of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters?

Huang Xiaolong exited his room. In a flicker, he disappeared in the direction of the Wolfless Palace’s entrance.

“Luo Haoming, roll out here for me!” Before Huang Xiaolong reached the Wolfless Palace’s entrance, he heard a voice yelling loudly.

A woman?

While Huang Xiaolong was still baffled as to what was going on, he arrived at the Wolfless Palace’s entrance. He opened the gates and stepped outside.

In the open space, in front of him, stood a group of women clad in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Grand Elder and core disciples’ robes.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the woman clad in a Grand Elder’s brocade robe, standing at the head of the group.

At first impression, Huang Xiaolong was astonished by her beauty. She was exceptionally gorgeous!

Huang Xiaolong was considered as someone who had seen many beauties. Just based on looks, no one could compare with this woman. However, it was a pity she was a devil. A pair of black wings grew out of her back, and a small horn was protruding on her forehead.

Huang Xiaolong searched through the memories he had gotten from Luo Haoming. Finally, he learned who this woman was. Her name was Yang Jing, one of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s supreme godhead geniuses. Apart from that and her Grand Elder’s status, she was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s and also the Spirits World’s number one beauty. Not to mention, she was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor Gao Ning’s personal disciple.

Gao Ning was a late-Tenth Order Emperor, the same one whom Huang Xiaolong had killed at the Death Tomb City. He had even hung Gao Ning’s corpse above the Death Tomb City gates.

En, there was another thing. Shi Yinyu and this woman were quite close and saying that they were childhood sweethearts was no exaggeration. From Luo Haoming’s memories, Shi Yinyu was going to wed Yang Jing after advancing to the Emperor Realm.

This was an open secret among the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s higher echelons.

However, it didn’t seem like Lu Haoming had offended this woman, so why did this woman come here looking for his trouble?

“So, it’s Grand Elder Yang Jing. May I ask what matters bring Grand Elder Yang Jing to my Giant Wolf Peak, and what do you mean by attacking my Wolfless Palace for no good reason?” Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts turned quickly. He asked without missing a beat, “Although Grand Elder Yang Jing’s status is a little special, this does not conform with the tribe’s rules, isn’t that so?”

As the hegemon of Spirits World, the tribe’s rules were strictly enforced. According to the tribe’s rules, the punishment for attacking a Grand Elder’s cultivation palace for no apparent reason was not light.

But Yang Jing didn’t put Huang Xiaolong’s words to heart. With her cold deadpan expression, she said, “I heard from the Piercing Moon Cult’s Chen Dongyue that you rescued a person who had disguised as Yang Jun?”

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly taken aback. He hadn’t at all expected her visit to be related to the Piercing Moon Cult’s incident.

Chen Dongyue did say that his Cult Head was good friends with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Hall Master Li Buqun. It had crossed Huang Xiaolong’s mind that Li Buqun would come to make trouble for him, but who could have thought that Yang Jing would go instead of Li Buqun.

“There is such a matter,” Huang Xiaolong replied. There was no need to deny.

“The Piercing Moon Cult’s Yang Jun is my clan brethren.” As if she had seen through Huang Xiaolong’s confusion, Yang Jing clarified in a concise sentence. “Today, I come to ask for that person from you. Since you rescued that fake Yang Jun, hand him to me now.”

Clan brethren!

Huang Xiaolong understood the connection in one sentence. So, it’s like that...

“That person had a grudge with me, so I’ve already killed him.” Huang Xiaolong frowned deeply and explained.

A cold gleam flashed across Yang Jing’s eyes as she demanded, “Killed? Where’s his corpse?”

“I incinerated it with divine fire.” Huang Xiaolong replied calmly.
