The young man clad in Xiao Family’s emblem robe was none other than the Xiao Family’s Young Lord, Xiao Zhangyu.

Huang Xiaolong frowned inwardly. The Hundred Tribulations’ Faction’s Chang Fang had actually came together with Xiao Zhangyu. This showed that their association was quite deep.

As expected, the experts in the hall began talking with their companions, “I’ve heard that the Young Lord Chang Fang of the Hundred Tribulations Faction has become sworn brothers with Xiao Family’s Young Lord Xiao Zhangyu!”

“Both of them are our Clear Spirit World’s most dazzling geniuses and their sworn brotherhood is already looking favorable in many people’s eyes.”

Elders and disciples from Hundred Tribulations Faction and the Xiao Family followed behind Chang Fang and Xiao Zhangyu as they entered the front hall.

Chang Fang walked into the hall with his head held high. Suddenly, as his gaze swept over the hall, he spotted Huang Xiaolong. Immediately, hostility glinted in his eyes, roiling with killing intent.

Xiao Zhangyu immediately felt the murderous aura coming off from Chang Fang’s body. He followed Chang Fang’s gaze a little doubtfully and saw Huang Xiaolong.

“Chang Fang, did that kid offended you?” Xiao Zhangyu asked. He found it unusual that a Seventh Order Ancient God Realm could bring out such a strong killing intent from Chang Fang.

Chang Fang answered, “Sometime back, he killed a disciple of my Hundred Tribulations Faction above the Ghosts Sea!” His eyes stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong.

Xiao Zhangyu was astonished. ‘That kid killed a disciple from Hundred Tribulations Faction above the Ghosts Sea?! And from Chang Fang’s words, it was apparent that it had happened right in front of Chang Fang!’

It was even more surprising that Chang Fang had actually let the kid go at that time?

“This kid is not as simple as he looks.” Chang Fang said.

Upon hearing this, Xiao Zhangyu took another look at Huang Xiaolong, but he couldn’t see anything extraordinary about Huang Xiaolong.

“But I hadn’t expected this punk to have the guts to step into the Ghost Manor.” Chang Fang sneered coldly. As his killing intent thickened, there was a fury burning in his heart. Huang Xiaolong’s action had blatantly insulted the Hundred Tribulations Faction! Was he not afraid of the grave repercussions?

Xiao Zhangyu promised, “I’ll help you vent this anger.”

Chang Fang didn’t expect that, “That...”

“Don’t worry, I guarantee your anger will be appeased.” Xiao Zhangyu smiled and reassured Chang Fang.

At this time, all the experts sitting at the center of the hall stood up from their seats, and enthusiastically greeted Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang.

Chang Fang could only smile in response to these experts’ greetings.

Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang soon took the seats in the front row. No one objected to this, as if these seats were rightly theirs.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong had reached near the Burning Sky Sect’s group.

As Xiao Zhangyu sat down, he ordered a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm Xiao Family’s guard, “Go, summon that kid over here. Tell him that I have something to ask him, and also, he’s to come over here on his knees.” He pointed at Huang Xiaolong who was standing beside Guo Jie.

The Xiao Family’s guard respectfully acknowledge Xiao Zhangyu’s order, and strode powerfully towards Huang Xiaolong.

Since Xiao Zhangyu had not lowered his voice deliberately, quite a lot of experts in the hall were able to hear him. Their attention turned to Huang Xiaolong and they shook their heads inwardly; they were sure that Huang Xiaolong would end up miserably.

In the past, a first-rank force’s young lord had offended Xiao Zhangyu, and he ended up being skinned alive by Xiao Zhangyu before his soul extracted. That young lord had died miserably, but his family had not dared to utter a single word.

Worry rose to Guo Jie’s face as she watched the Xiao Family’s guard walking straight to Huang Xiaolong. She asked anxiously, “How did you offend the Xiao Family’s Young Lord?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly and said as he shrugged his shoulders, “Maybe because I killed a disciple from the Hundred Tribulations Faction a few hours ago?”

“What?!” Guo Jie, Du Gao, and others were flabbergasted. This was the reason...

“You!” Guo Jie was even more anxious as she urged, “Quickly run then! Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang are life-and-death brothers. Now that you have killed a disciple from the Hundred Tribulations Faction, Xiao Zhangyu is venting on behalf of Chang Fang and he won’t let you off that easily!”

“Don’t worry, it’s nothing that serious.” Huang Xiaolong flashed her a brilliant smile.

“How can you say it’s nothing, after killing a disciple from the Hundred Tribulations Faction?!” She was fuming, but didn’t know what to say anymore, as she saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t anxious.

Not to mention, the disciples who had qualified to follow Chang Fang to the Ghost Manor were all important core disciples from the Hundred Tribulations Faction.

Killing a disciple from the Hundred Tribulations Faction was... nothing?

In these few seconds, the Xiao Family’s guard had already arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, you’ve already heard what my Young Lord said, didn’t you? Now, walk over on your knees, or do you want me to break your kneecaps before you kneel?”

He looked coldly at Huang Xiaolong. He was prepared to shatter Huang Xiaolong’s kneecaps immediately, if Huang Xiaolong dared to utter the word ‘No’.

Huang Xiaolong replied indifferently, “If your Young Lord has something to say, then he can walk over here on his knees.”

The people in the hall were stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s reply. Even more shocked were Guo Jie, Du Gao, and the rest of the Burning Sky Sect’s disciples.

Everyone could feel the intense cold gleam in Xiao Zhangyu’s eyes.

“Courting death!?” The guard, Xiao Jianzhi, reacted. His fingers bent into a claw to strike down at the crown of Huang Xiaolong’s head. The others in the hall barely caught the afterimages of his hand, as a powerful yin corpse qi rushed out of it.

This was the Xiao Family’s Yin Corpse Claw technique. Once scratched by this technique, the victim would be in excruciating pain as yin corpse qi would invade their body.

Seeing that Xiao Jianzhi’s claw was very close to clutching Huang Xiaolong’s head, all of a sudden, a black palm reached out and blocked the attack. Then, this black palm lightly slapped against Xiao Jianzhi’s claw.

The peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm guard Xiao Jianzhi flew out like a withered leaf in the storm and crashed right in front of Xiao Zhangyu’s feet. In the next second, Xiao Jianzhi’s flesh started rotting rapidly, leaving only his bones a few breaths later.

At the end, wisps of black qi flowed out from Xiao Jianzhi’s bones.

“This is the corrosive devil qi!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Corrosive devil qi!”

Shocked gasps sounded in the hall.

The experts and their young lords sitting nearby jumped away in, so did Xiao Zhangyu and Chang Fang.

In the next moment, everyone looked in astonishment at the cute void devil beast Xu Baisheng standing beside Huang Xiaolong.

“Ancestor God Realm magical beast!”

Up until now, no one had noticed that the completely black and cute beast behind Huang Xiaolong was actually an Ancestor God Realm master!

Guo Jie, Du Gao, and others were agape.

Though these experts recognized the corrosive devil qi, none of them recognize that Xu Baisheng was a void devil beast. They thought it was a common magical beast.

Regaining his balance, Xiao Zhangyu looked at Xiao Jianzhi who was corroded until nothing was left except his white bones, and his face turned extremely gloomy. His head jerked up as he glared at Huang Xiaolong with startling killing intent.

Huang Xiaolong had actually dared to have his magical beast kill a Xiao Family’s disciple in front of him, and in front of so many experts?!

Just as Xiao Zhangyu was about to order the Xiao Family’s Ancestor God Realm master to kill Huang Xiaolong, the space in the hall rippled as a mysterious person wearing a ghost mask appeared in front of them.

“Ghost guard!” A few exclaimed.

This ghost guard was naturally the Ghost Manor’s guard. Outsiders only knew that there were a lot of ghost guards, but no one knew exactly how many of them were there, nor did they know their strengths.

“Xiao Zhangyu, this is the Ghost Manor, not the Xiao Family’s main residence. If you cause trouble again, don’t blame me for throwing all of you into the Ghosts Sea.” The ghost guard warned.

Xiao Zhangyu stared fixedly at the ghost guard. A while later, he waved his hand at the Xiao Family’s Elders and disciples and indicated them to stay where they were.

“Punk, consider yourself lucky this time. Let’s see if you can hide forever inside the Ghost Manor. The day you go outside, is the day you die!” Xiao Zhangyu said icily to Huang Xiaolong.
