Chapter 3295: Poorest Chap

“Uncle, were you a couple with Teacher Zhang Yuhan?” Lin Kai asked curiously on board the flying ship.

Like Huang Datou, Lin Kai was extremely intrigued when he learned of Huang Xiaolong’s relationship with a teacher in their school.

“What the hell are you so concerned about?” Huang Xiaolong snapped at him.

Lin Kai lowered his head, but a crafty smile formed on his face.

Walking to the front of the ship, Huang Xiaolong looked out of the window at the forest and mountains below.

As the flying ship was driven by an automated artificial intelligence, there was no need for anyone to actually steer the ship. As such, Huang Xiaolong could do whatever he wanted.

Even though they hadn’t interacted for a long time, Lin Kai knew that Huang Xiaolong loved silence. He didn’t dare to interrupt, and he headed towards the back of the flying ship.

Huang Xiaolong’s mind wandered to the past, and he recalled how he flew with Zhang Yuhan a hundred years ago. There was once where they went on holiday, and the plane they were on experienced massive turbulence. Everyone on board was terrified.

In the past, Zhang Yuhan stared at Huang Xiaolong with an extremely calm face and said, “In the next life, we’ll still be together!”

After so many years, Huang Xiaolong still remembered what she said to him.

“In the next life…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Every time he thought about it, complicated emotions would fill his heart. Now that he returned from another world, wouldn’t it count as his next life?

A weird feeling filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart as they approached the Eastern University.

Retrieving an identity plaque, Huang Xiaolong looked at the words ‘Eastern University’ inscribed on it. That was the pass he obtained from Huang Shengan. The plaque wasn’t something that indicated his identity as a student, lecturer, or even an associate professor in the university. Instead, it was the plaque of a deputy head of the school!

Initially, he planned on asking Huang Shengan for an ordinary plaque. It was fine as long as he could enter the school as he wished. Who would have thought that Huang Shengan would go above and beyond to give him a plaque of that level?

According to what Huang Shengan said, he felt that the higher the position, the easier things would be for Huang Xiaolong. If he was a mere student, he wouldn’t be allowed to leave the school on weekdays. Anything else and he would have to teach some lessons. As such, the best identity in the university was the one of the deputy head as he didn’t need to do anything!

In fact, Huang Shengan’s initial idea was to give Huang Xiaolong the plaque of the vice principal of the university. However, time was too tight and even if he pulled all the strings he had with his identity, it would take half a month to get the plaque.

“Deputy head…” Huang Xiaolong looked at the plaque in his hand and he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Zhang Yuhan was the head of the university, and his current identity would make her his boss!

As random thoughts ran through his mind, they arrived in the skies above the capital city.

The Eastern University was located in the northern region of the capital city, and Huang Xiaolong saw the giant structures and he sighed softly.

The capital city was the place of his dreams.

In the past, he was attracted by the hustle and bustle of the capital city. He even swore to purchase a massive mansion in the city center! He would move over with his parents and his sister in order to give his family members a good life.

However, that was all in the past. For one hundred years, no one had seen any traces of Huang Xiaolong.

The capital city that was under his feet right now flourished even more than before. There were countless flying ships in the air, and cars filled the streets. A weird feeling washed over Huang Xiaolong, and the feeling of power and authority finally filled him when he looked at the streets below.

The history and changes of countless years left its mark on the city.

When Huang Xiaolong was still thinking about the past, a flying ship flew over from the side and scratched Huang Xiaolong’s ship.

Wobbling slightly, Huang Xiaolong’s ship didn’t experience the slightest damage. The same couldn’t be said for the other party. Their ship rammed into a massive building and caused a loud explosion.

Boom!

Rubble fell from the skies, and everyone stopped to stare at the flying ship that crashed.

Lin Kai was stunned to discover that they were unlucky enough to be the victims of an accident right before they arrived in school.

With the doors opening on the crashed ship, three figures appeared. A middle aged couple and a young man left the ship.

One could see how rich the other party was from their clothes. With a single glance, one could tell that they came from a rich family.

“Are you blind?! Get out here right now! Do you even know how to drive?” The three of them started shouting the moment they left their ship.

“Uncle we…” Lin Kai couldn’t help but turn to Huang Xiaolong.

Shaking his hand, Huang Xiaolong landed the ship. The doors opened and they walked out of the flying ship.

As soon as Lin Kai saw the other party, his expression changed. “Liu Decong!”

“Lin Kai!” A frown formed on the other party’s face. It was clear he didn’t expect to meet Lin Kai on the streets.

He knew how poor Lin Kai was, and he didn’t expect the kid to appear from a flying ship. After all, Lin Kai couldn’t even afford spiritual fruits.

“Do you know each other?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Uncle, he’s the richest kid in our class! His family does land development, and their company is called the Heng Rong Real Estate!”

It was a company that was pretty high up in the rankings in the Huaxia Alliance.

Regardless if it was the Earth a hundred years ago or now, real estate has always been the one of the most profitable industry.

The youngster called Liu Decong stared at Liu Kai suspiciously when he saw how the kid called Huang Xiaolong ‘uncle’.

“Decong, is this your friend?” The middle aged man asked. A trace of arrogance could be seen on his face when he addressed them.

Nodding his head, Decong explained, “Dad, he’s called Lin Kai! He’s the poorest classmate we have, and he usually eats salted vegetables and rice for lunch!”

The middle aged man was called Liu Pinchen, and he was slightly stunned. He thought that Lin Kai came from a pretty well off family. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Even if you’re Decong’s classmate, you have to pay us for the damages!” The middle aged woman snapped.

With his expression changing, Lin Kai argued, “You were the ones who knocked into us! Why do we have to pay?”

The woman was Liu Decong’s mother, and she was called Zou Ru. She wanted to continue, but a police ship arrived on scene and two officers approached them.

“What’s going on?”

Zou Ru pointed at the two of them and tears formed in her eyes, “The two of them drove recklessly and caused our ship to crash! Our ship came from the Yutong Company, and it’s their newest product! It’s worth two million low-grade spirit stones! They have to compensate us no matter what!”

Liu Pinchen walked up to the two officers and he growled, “The two of you better know what’s good for you. I’m the general manager of Heng Rong Real Estates, and we’re disciples of the Liu Family!”

The expressions of the police officers changed the moment he said that.

Heng Rong Real Estates was a behemoth in the capital city, and so was the Liu Family! Everyone heard of them, and they were considered one of the ten strongest cultivation families in the Huaxia Alliance! Even if they ranked at the absolute bottom, which they did, they were still an insurmountable existence!”
