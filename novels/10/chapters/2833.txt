Chapter 2834: Public Apology

Yi Beihang, Wang Jin, He Yugui, and Yan San looked at each other and saw the horror in each other’s eyes. This time, there was no way they could stop him.

Yi Beihang retreated the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong’s revelation of strength.

Could we really kill such an existence?

Yi Beihang, who was extremely confident in the power of the dao origin, started to doubt himself.

If we fail to kill Huang Xiaolong, wouldn’t that mean that our Blue Heaven Creed would be…

Not just Yi Beihang, but the other three thought of the same thing.

Yan San actually felt regretful. He finally regretted his actions of killing the disciples of the various sacred lands. He finally thought that persecuting Huang Xiaolong might be the wrong thing to do.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the four of them and said, “Yi Beihang, make your move!”

How could he not understand what the four of them were thinking of?

Yi Beihang’s expression was overcast, yet he didn’t move.

“Huang Xiaolong, if you swear not to make things difficult for my Blue Heaven Creed, we can drop the grudges, and we can let you leave,” Yi Beihang declared after thinking for some time.

“As for the surrounding sacred lands, we can compensate you. Our Blue Heaven Creed will give you several tens of millions dao coins.”

Tens of million of Divine Tuo dao coins!

Many sacred lands would consider that to be an astronomical amount.

Huang Xiaolong smiled indifferently, “I said it before, and I’ll repeat myself once again. I am willing to leave if you make a public apology. Hand over half the treasury and your dao origin, along with Yan San.”

Yi Beihang, Yan San, Wang Jin, and He Yugui’s faces turned extremely unsightly.

Yan San roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think we can’t kill you?! So what if you have three grand dao souls and twelve high-order Saint Fates? You’re just a mere Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor! If the four of us join hands and go all out with the dao origin power, we’ll slay you right where you stand!”

Yan San said to Yi Beihang, “Patriarch, Huang Xiaolong is pushing us too far! Let’s join hands to activate the dao origin and kill him!”

Yi Beihang sucked in a long breath, and he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “If you regret your actions now, we’ll stop here. It’s not too late for you to leave. Tens of millions of dao coins isn’t a small amount!”

It wasn’t impossible for them to apologize publicly in front of all the patriarchs from the surrounding regions, but it was impossible for them to hand Yan San over.

It was downright insane for Huang Xiaolong to ask for half the treasury and dao origin.

Huang Xiaolong smiled indifferently and kept his silence. To others, several million dao coins was an astronomical amount. However, it was a drop in the ocean for the Blue Heaven Creed. The treasuries they had obtained when they had destroyed the surrounding sacred lands were worth much more than tens of millions!

To put it bluntly, they were trying to shoo a beggar away with that amount!

The dao souls above Huang Xiaolong shone brightly, and boundless grand dao energy poured down onto Huang Xiaolong.

Rays of light came from the saint fates as the power of heaven and earth surged in his body.

He might not have answered, but his actions made it clear. Yi Beihang’s face turned extremely unsightly.

“Patriarch, we…” Wang Jin muttered.

“Kill!” Yi Beihang growled.

Since Huang Xiaolong insisted on having a battle with them, they could only choose to use everything they had to eliminate the threat.

Yi Beihang’s entire body was covered in light, and grand dao laws filled the skies. His cosmos energy poured out of his body unceasingly.

Yan San didn’t hold back as he gave it his all.

Wang Jin and He Yugui could only cooperate and join hands to fully use the power of the dao origin to deal with Huang Xiaolong.

However, they were surprised by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden attack. He appeared before them in an instant, and the power of absolute frost and flame fused around his fist. A blinding ray pierced into the skies as the heavens changed colors.

Those who had retreated the moment the dao origin had appeared could feel the terrifying power of absolute frost and flame from a distance.

A horrified expression appeared on their faces. If they were struck by such a powerful attack, wouldn’t that mean…

No one dared to imagine their end.

Bang!

A loud sound rang through the skies.

With the help of the dao origin, Yi Beihang and the others managed to take on the punch from Huang Xiaolong.

The glaciers and sea of flames that had appeared in the skies were blasted away.

Huang Xiaolong and the four Dao Venerables took several steps back.

Evenly matched!

“What?!”

Yi Xiaotang and the others screamed in fright when they saw the result of the clash.

Despite four Dao Venerables joining hands and borrowing the power of the dao origin, they were barely evenly matched with Huang Xiaolong!

This result had greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations.

Yi Beihang, Yan San, Wang Jin, and He Yugui were similarly shocked. They couldn’t believe how strong the kid standing against them was!

An invigorated cry rang through the skies when they were still stuck in their state of shock. “Again!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Destructive power that contained the power to shatter the heavens swept through the world.

A loud blast filled the ears of those present.

The heavens shook, and the earth trembled.

The Blue Heaven Creed seemed to be on the verge of splitting apart as cracks started to appear along the mountain range. Rocks crumbled and the rivers dried up. Palaces started to fall, and the disciples of the Blue Heaven Creed who were watching in the distance sucked in a cold breath.

They summoned their artifacts to protect themselves, but they were too weak to stand up against the shockwave of the clash.

After tumbling away, they quickly gathered into a circle as they desperately joined hands to withstand the impact.

They were the only ones who were shocked. The four Dao Venerables attacking Huang Xiaolong were struck silly. They were evenly matched initially, but as the battle progressed, Huang Xiaolong became stronger and stronger!

His strength seemed to be endless!

Gradually, Huang Xiaolong gained the upper hand!

……

A few days later, the Blue Heaven Creed gave the order to gather the patriarchs of the various sacred lands around them.

When the various factions were guessing the intentions of the Blue Heaven Creed, Yi Beihang apologized to Huang Xiaolong, a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor, on behalf of the creed.

The patriarchs present were shocked, confused, and puzzled.

Not long after, the Blue Heaven Creed appointed a new palace hall master to replace Yan San, who had disappeared. It was as though he had vanished into thin air.
