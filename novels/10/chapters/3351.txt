Chapter 3352: Demon Hell Secret Region

 

As such, the group left the city for the Great Valley the next instant.

After their introductions, they discovered that their guide was a famous adventurer in the African Continent.

“I would explore the area before the valley appeared. I might not dare to claim to know everything in the world, but I am certain that I know all there is to know about the region around the valley,” the guide, Ife, started to boast of his abilities.

“Oh? Do you know the reason behind the appearance of the valley?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Ife hesitated for a moment before nodding his head. “Yes, I do!” 

Alexis was shocked. “I heard that no one knows the reason behind the appearance of the weird monsters pouring out from the valley. How do you know the cause behind it?”

Experts all over the world used satellite images to look at the area around the valley in order to determine the reason behind its appearance. However, they were unable to do so. Since Ife claimed that he knew the reason, the world would tremble if the news got out.

“Since you know the reason, why don’t you report it to the great alliance?” Ayi asked.

A sneer formed on Ife’s lips. “Why should I tell them?”

Frowns formed on the faces of those present.

“Even if I look for an official and tell him the reason, he might not believe me. Even if they do, they will definitely report it to the higher-ups and claim all the credit for themselves.” Ife sneered. “I won’t get anything out of it. In fact, they might even silence me to keep it a secret!” 

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ife with a look of amusement. “Why would you trust us then?”

“Humph. I’m great at judging people.” However, he paused for a second. “Anyway, I didn’t say that I’m telling you the reason behind the appearance of the valley.”

Huang Xiaolong tossed over another spatial ring. “There’s another hundred thousand in there.”

Alexis and the rest were shocked. They didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to buy an answer for a hundred thousand low-grade spiritual stones.

According to them, it didn’t really matter even if he knew, right?

Ife looked at the ring in his hand before turning to look at Huang Xiaolong with suspicion in his eyes. “Young Master Huang, you’re planning to go there for the black diamonds, right?” 

“Hurry up and get to the point,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“In fact, I’m no adventurer. I’m an archaeologist! The reason I chose to adventure near the valley was because I discovered a secret region there!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Secret region?!” Alexis, and the others gasped in fright.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly and he seemed to have thought of something.

“That’s right! It’s a secret region called the Devil Hell Secret Region!” Ife turned serious, and his tone sank, “All these years, I failed to find the entrance of the secret region.”

“Do you mean to say that the Great Valley is now the entrance to the Devil Hell Secret Region?! Are the monsters all from hell?!” Alexis yelped in terror.

“Yes.”

Everyone looked at each other doubtfully as the story was too unbelievable. 

Ife turned to Huang Xiaolong and continued, “Young Master Huang, do you believe my theory?”

“I do.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Indeed, the Devil Hell should be a secret region like the Kun Lun Saint Region.

The only difference was the person who left the region behind. Pangu was the one behind the creation of the Kun Lun Saint Region, but he had no idea who left behind the Devil Hell Secret Region.

Alexis and the others were a little speechless when they heard that Huang Xiaolong agreed to the man’s speculations.

“Are the black diamonds a type of energy crystal born in the secret region?” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Ife’s jaws dropped when he heard what Huang Xiaolong asked. “That’s right… I guessed as much. The black diamonds greatly resemble the spirit stones on earth.”

“If someone manages to enter the Devil Hell Secret Region, wouldn’t they make it rich?!” Keta gasped.

Ife could see the greed in Keta’s eyes, and he chuckled in amusement. “If you make it out alive, you’ll be rich. You won’t be able to stop counting the money you make if you return alive! However, are you sure that you can make it out in one piece? It’s said that Lord Yuan Hui entered the valley once, but he was forced back after going in several hundred meters. The devil qi in the area is too terrifying. I’m afraid that even the experts who have surpassed the Enlightenment Realm wouldn’t be able to go too deep into the valley.”

Keta and the others felt their scalp going numb.

“The only people who might be able to enter the valley would be the ancient immortals from the Huaxia Alliance if they return to life…”

Huang Xiaolong remained calm as he asked Ife about the current happenings around the Great Valley. Perhaps it was because he took Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual stones, he told him everything he knew. However, he didn’t know anything that happened within the valley. The only thing he knew was the stuff recorded in the ancient scripts.

Along the way, Ife told Huang Xiaolong and the rest about his great adventures. All of them were as weird as could be, and Alexis and the others learned a lot from him.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong realized that Ife was a pretty good guy. The only thing about him was that he was avaricious.

“After crossing this mountain, we’ll arrive in the Crimson Flames Basin.” Ife pointed towards the peak before them, and he explained, “The valley is right in the middle of the basin! When we enter the basin, there will be tons of monsters!” 

It was a kind reminder to all of them that things would become dangerous.

As he was really familiar with the area, they didn’t run into any creatures along the way.

However, it would be unavoidable the moment they entered the basin.

When they arrived before the giant mountain, he reminded them about various things they had to take note of.

However, they saw a group of people flying back towards them, and it was clear that they came from the valley.

“Haha! We’re going to be rich! We found more than thirty black diamonds this time, and there’s one of them the size of a small fist!” 

“Loos is really stupid to believe us. However, it’s lucky he did. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to escape from the multitude of creatures…” 

Laughter filled the air.

However, the mood was completely different on Alexis’s side. Her expression changed instantly, and she rushed over to stop the group of people. “Laha, what did you just say?! What happened to my big brother?!” 

She was naturally referring to the man they called Loos.

The man she spoke to was a young patriarch from the Nande Family from one of the surrounding cities. However, they were much stronger than the Pier Family.

The young man looked at Alexis and sneered, “Hahaha! Look, it’s little sister Alexis!” 

After he spoke, all of them surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s group with sinister smiles on their faces.
