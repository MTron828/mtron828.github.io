Guo Gang nodded proudly and went on, "No genius from the younger generation is worthy of being Big brother Guo Jun’s opponent in the sea tribes, or this entire Vientiane World. Big brother Guo Jun has already reached the tenth stage of Silver Whale Scripture, not to mention, his cultivation realm has advanced to mid-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, or maybe even higher!"Guo Gang’s subordinate suddenly said, "Young Lord, I have heard that Feng Yingying has inherited the Ancient Sea God’s bloodline, is that true?" After saying this, he shivered uncontrollably. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Inherited the Ancient Sea God’s bloodline!

As one of the sea tribe’ disciples, they all knew what that represented.

Once Feng Yingying truly merges with the Sea God’s bloodline, she will be the sea tribe’ ‘new Sea God!

The Sea God was the existence that stood above the whole sea tribe, as their supreme leader!

Feng Yingying would then also become the Head of the Sea God Temple. All of twelve sea tribes’ prominent families would be obliged to obey Feng Yingying’s orders.

Guo Gang looked frostily at the subordinate, “Don’t go inquiring about things that you shouldn’t know, or one day, or you might lose your life.”

Coldness gripped the subordinate’s heart, as he hastily acknowledged with a terrified ‘yes.’

“Feng Yingying is going to be Big brother Guo Jun’s woman sooner or later.” Guo Gang said confidently. “Only Big brother Guo Jun is worthy of her in this whole Vientiane World. If Feng Yingying really possesses the Sea God’s bloodline, then he could get her yin essence energy after dual cultivating with her. This will help him to finally reach the twelfth stage of the Silver Whale Scripture, thus, enabling him to break through to Ancestor God Realm!”

“When that happens, our Guo Family will rule the sea tribe!”

“Once our Guo Family unifies the sea tribe, the next target will be the whole of the Vientiane World!”

As Guo Gang said this, the smile on his face deepened, along with a hint of killing intent in his eyes, “The first one to be annihilated will be the Fortune Gate!”

As the days passed by, it got closer to the day of the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, and excitement and liveliness spread across the sea tribes’ cities.

Huang Xiaolong did not step out of his room and cultivated for the remainder of the time before the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony. In truth, he was too lazy to go out.

But he still knew what was happening outside, as he could hear the conversations between the Guo Family’s disciple patrols. Wangu Clan’s Wangu Ziyi, as well as the Dark Elf Tribe’s You Wuxin had also arrived in Sea God City.

Not only that, the sea tribe had also invited the Void Sky World’s Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Yama Gates, Virtual Returning Cult, Short Blade Gate, and also some other super forces from neighboring world surfaces, including the Scarlet One World’s Blood Imperial Sect, and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate Branch.

“Golden Phoenix Pavilion, Short Blade Gate, Yama Gates, Blood Imperial Sect, and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate branch...” Huang Xiaolong sneered under his breath as he heard these familiar names.

The Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Head, and that Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s number one genius disciple Lin Zhi had arrived.

‘I wonder if Wang Yu would come here too?’ A fleeting killing intent appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart, as the thought crossed his mind. Since the sea tribe had also invited the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate branch, he thought that it was very likely for Wang Yu to attend the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

Not to forget Sun Yi; perhaps Wang Yu knew Sun Yi’s whereabouts in the Divine World.

Huang Xiaolong certainly had to kill Wang Yu and Sun Yi, especially Sun Yi. Not to mention the main body of mysterious Fang Chu.

Huang Xiaolong was not worried about Wang Yu and Sun Yi, but he was a little concerned about Fang Chu’s main body. Every time he thought of Fang Chu, he would get a strong sense of uneasiness.

...

In the blink of an eye, the month came and went.

Perhaps it was Huang Xiaolong’s diligence, or may the large number of chaos spiritual pills that he had consumed, or even the four divine fires’ gray chaos spiritual energy, Huang Xiaolong broke through to peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm six days before the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

It was an unexpected delight for Huang Xiaolong.

As his cultivation advanced, so did the defenses and power of his True Dragon Physique. Huang Xiaolong had continued tempering his body with the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks throughout this whole time. The amount of Eidolon Crystalline Rocks he had obtained at the Devil Prison Mountain was sufficient to support a few years of his cultivation.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his room, as he desired to go out for a stroll.

Huang Xiaolong saw the little cow lying on the ground as we walked to the yard. She was lazily crunching on an Ancestor God Realm master’s godhead.

Since the void devil beast Xu Baisheng had not followed Huang Xiaolong to the Sea God City, the little cow was a little lonely by herself.

Even though she saw Huang Xiaolong, she still continued lying down lazily and without much spirit as she basked in the sun.

Huang Xiaolong gave her a kick and stated, “The ‘sun’ has come out.”

But the little cow said with disinterest, “That sun has been out for a long time.” And still doesn’t seem to want to stand up.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong gave her another kick, slightly harder.

“Where?” The little cow still hadn’t come around.

“Where do you think? Of course, out. For a stroll.” Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes at the little cow, then turned and walked straight in the direction of the gates.

The little cow blanked out for a second, but then in a split second, she swooshed out like a streak of lightning while screaming: “Here I come!” The loud, enthusiastic voice sounded like a waiter in an inn attending to customers.

“Only now do I notice that you have potential to become a restaurant waiter.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

The little cow chuckled sheepishly, “Really? Then you open a restaurant, and become a boss, while I’ll be your restaurant’s waiter.”

Huang Xiaolong laughed as he imagined himself opening up a restaurant and having the little cow shuffling back and forth with her butt swaying all over the place, “Forget it, if you become my waiter, there definitely won’t be any business.”

The little cow curled her lips in protest, “My charm is very big.”

“I really did not see that.” Huang Xiaolong said as he surveyed the little cow from top to bottom.

The two talked and joked as they walked out of the courtyard and on the streets of Sea God City.

Compared to a month ago, there were more people in the city, and it was livelier outside. There were pedestrians walking up and down the wide streets, and the air was full of excitement.

While Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were casually strolling on a street, Golden Phoenix Pavilion and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples were strolling casually towards them from the opposite direction. At the very front of the group were Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s number one genius disciple Li Zhi, accompanied by his younger sister Li Ting, and Wang Yu.

“Younger brother, I have heard that Feng Yingying is not only the sea tribes’ number one genius, but she’s also the number one beauty. More importantly, she has no companion yet.” Li Ting said to Li Zhi.

“That’s right, our Senior Brother Li Zhi is an unparalleled talent. Even that sea tribes’ Guo Jun cannot be compared to our Senior Brother Li Zhi. Senior Brother Li Zhi is the only one worthy of Feng Yingying.” One of the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciples said.

Golden Phoenix Pavilion and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples began flattering Li Zhi.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” All of a sudden, Wang Yu’s steps halted as he stared fixedly at a figure not far away from them. There was shock and astonishment in his eyes.

As Huang Xiaolong was not in disguise, Wang Yu had recognized him right away. This was his nemesis from the lower realm!

The rest of Wang Yu’s group turned to look because of Wang Yu’s sudden exclamation.

A Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple spoke, “Huang Xiaolong? The number one genius of the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch, is that him? I have heard that even Wangu Clan’s genius Wangu Ziyi lost to him.
