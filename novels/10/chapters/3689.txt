Chapter 3690 – Solo Battle

The two were shocked to discover Huang Xiaolong’s approach.

The experts of the various regions stared at each other in confusion.

“Is Huang Xiaolong planning to fight against the two alone?!” The Nefarious Golden Master mocked.

“Hahaha! It’s possible!” A youngster who covered half his face sneered. “He even dares to kill the Yin Reversal King and Yang Nether King! Of course he’s confident enough to take on the two of them at the same time!”

Everyone broke into laughter.

The person who spoke was called Wei Zheng. He was comparable in strength to Gui Chi and his combat abilities closed in on the 20 billion mark. He was an existence who was only second to the supreme overlords! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong quickly arrived before the two.

“You can come at me together.” Huang Xiaolong stated in a flat tone.

The moment the words left his lips, everyone broke out into laughter.

“Hahaha! We’re right!”

The Nefarious Golden Master sneered, “He’s tired of living. Does he think that the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death are as weak as the Yin Reversal King and the Yang Nether King?!”

Both the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death frowned when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Brat, are you planning to fight us alone?!” The Dragon Overlord roared. His voice was thunderous and everyone felt their ears ringing. “Do you really think you have the capabilities to battle the two of us at once?”

The God of Death slowly approached Huang Xiaolong. “I’m more than enough if we wish to kill you. I’ll give you a chance to show off your Reversal Sword.”

Huang Xiaolong’s strength couldn’t be underestimated after he killed the two kings. His strength might have crossed the 20 billion mark, but the God of Death was confident that he could take Huang Xiaolong on no matter how strong he was.

With his combat strength at the 23 billion mark, he still had the Blade of Death to assist him. Not even the Dragon Overlord was confident of defeating him!

That was because he had the ability to control death! He was indestructible!

No matter how strong one’s attack was, it couldn’t affect his fleshy body.

“Why would I need the Reversal Sword to deal with you?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed.

The God of Death scoffed when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Since that’s what you think…” The Blade of Death appeared in his hand and he stabbed at Huang Xiaolong without any warning.

The Blade of Death was extremely quick. The God of Death didn’t use any superfluous movement and his blade arrived beside Huang Xiaolong’s neck in the blink of an eye.

However, Huang Xiaolong casually grabbed the blade with his fingers.

In front of everyone present, the Blade of Death was stuck between Huang Xiaolong’s fingers!

The God of Death, the Dragon Overlord, and the various region masters stared at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief in their eyes.

Casually flicking the body of the blade, Huang Xiaolong wanted to see how strong the weapon actually was.

Clang!

A clear ringing sound filled the skies.

A terrifying shockwave swept through the lands, forcing the God of Death to retreat several dozen thousand miles.

When he landed on the ground, the rumbling didn’t stop for a long time.

The sudden change caused everyone to stand rooted to their spots as their world view crumbled before them.

Not even the Dragon Overlord believed what he saw.

No one expected Huang Xiaolong to send the God of Death flying with a single tap!

Ignoring everyone, Huang Xiaolong walked towards the Dragon Overlord and sighed, “It’s your turn.”

Next, he looked at the region masters and continued, “You’re free to attack me in a group.”

The Dragon Overlord’s expression sank.

A weird light flashed in Wei Zheng’s and others’ eyes. It was evident that they were thinking of working together to deal with Huang Xiaolong.

Even though they had no idea how Huang Xiaolong really was, they knew that he was stronger than the Dragon Overlord since he sent the God of Death flying easily.

They knew that they were no match for him individually.

When they were still hesitating, Huang Xiaolong moved. He appeared in front of Wei Zheng and the Nefarious Golden Master before sending a punch their way.

Their expressions changed drastically as they tried to retreat. It was too bad they failed to dodge the punch.

Huang Xiaolong’s fist slammed heavily into their chests

The sound of bones shattering filled the air.

Everyone saw their innards being beaten out of their bodies.

The Nefarious Golden Master’s strength ranked in the middle of the group, but he was comparable to Wei Zheng and Gui Chi! With his strength, he was nowhere comparable to Huang Xiaolong!

Wei Zheng’s physical body was like paper in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone who wanted to attack Huang Xiaolong second guessed themselves. They realized that they might not be able to defeat him even if they worked together.

Under their terrified gaze, Huang Xiaolong sent a punch towards the Dragon Overlord.

Reacting instantly, a pair of flame wheels appeared in his hand.

One of them was dark and the other was burning bright.

They were the Yin Yang Flame Wheels.

When the Dragon Overlord waved the wheels together, a terrifying tornado was formed.

The tornado attempted to block Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong’s fist didn’t slow down as it tore through the tornado. It smashed straight into the Dragon Overlord’s chest.

Like the God of Death, the Dragon Overlord was sent flying. He landed beside the God of Death.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath.

They might have tried to overestimate Huang Xiaolong’s strength, but they were far from it!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t continue his assault as he looked at the two casually.

The God of Death and the Dragon Overlord crawled to their feet and fear filled their hearts.

“Who the hell are you?!” The Dragon Overlord yelled.

“Do you remember Huang Sheng?” Huang Xiaolong replied with a question of his own.

The Dragon Overlord stared at him in silence. “Are you talking about Huang Sheng from the Thirteen Universes?”

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong summoned the Sun Moon Furnace and he released Huang Sheng along with Meng Tian.

The moment they appeared, they stared at the group of experts surrounding them in fright.

“Lord… Lord Dragon Overlord!” They exclaimed with disbelief and they felt as though their savior had appeared.
