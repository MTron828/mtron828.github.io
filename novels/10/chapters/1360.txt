As the divine elephant looked at Huang Xiaolong, so did everyone from the group of Ten Thousand Elephant Clan.

Xiang Xiaojie was glaring hatefully at Huang Xiaolong; he stood up and took a few steps forward. He respectfully said, “Old Ancestor, this person brought his people to the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City and violated our rules, injuring our clan’s disciples, Grand Elder, and Elders; even Ancestor and Patriarch were injured!”

“I plead to Old Ancestor to be our judge, kill this person and his followers!”

Since more than a billion years had passed, many people had forgotten the rule—the person who resurrects the divine elephant would be the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Master. Even Xiang Xiaojie had forgotten this rule.

Xiang Xiaojie stared at Huang Xiaolong with faint smirk and excitement.

It was as if he could already see his clan’s Old Ancestor killing Huang Xiaolong and his followers, especially the late-Third Order God King Realm beast!

Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai actually ashened when they heard his words.

Xiang Xiaojie, Grand Elders and Elders may have forgotten that rule, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Ancestor and Patriarch would never forget that rule.

Just as Xiang Hui and Xiang Tai were about to say something, the divine elephant slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

Tremors ran through the land with every step the divine elephant took with his mountain of a figure.

Huang Xiaolong looked very small and weak as he stood face to face with the divine elephant. It looked like the divine elephant could send Huang Xiaolong to the end of the Divine World with a blow of his breath.

The divine elephant’s overwhelming aura washed over Huang Xiaolong as he walked towards him.

The corners of Huang Xiaolong’s robe fluttered in the absence of the blowing wind.

The excitement in Xiang Xiaojie’s eyes shone even brighter as he watched their clan’s Old Ancestor walk towards Huang Xiaolong, and there was an obvious bloodthirst in his eyes as he thought to himself, ‘Huang Xiaolong’s slaves, you also need to prepare yourselves to die!’

However, there was a slight regret in his heart, as he thought that this was going to be an easy death for Huang Xiaolong and his slaves.

At this time, the divine elephant stopped thirty meters from Huang Xiaolong. To everyone’s surprise, the divine elephant bowed and knelt down in front of Huang Xiaolong. He respectfully and solemnly said, “My gratitude to Master for resurrecting Xiang Xun; Xiang Xun kowtows to thank Master!”

With that said, the divine elephant’s forehead touched the ground, and his large trunk swung happily.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er’s taut nerves finally relaxed. On the other hand, the little cow shook away the dust from her body while mumbling something under her breath.

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s group froze on the spot. Shock and disbelief were clearly written on every Grand Elder and Elder’s face. A split second later, everyone remembered the particular ‘rule’ that was passed down through generations of Ten Thousand Elephant Clan.

Xiang Xiaojie’s jaw dropped in shock and his face turned deathly pale. His chest heaved, and his body swayed back and forth due to shortness of breath. It looked like he would collapse and die at any moment.

Master!

Gratitude to Master?!

Their Old Ancestor had addressed Huang Xiaolong as ‘Master!’

His legs shook like he was carrying a great boulder on his shoulders.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the divine elephant kneeling in front of him. He wasn’t surprised by this gesture because the divine elephant resurrected by his grandmist worm would have recognized him as his Master, regardless of the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s rule.

Huang Xiaolong’s rubbed the divine elephant’s head. His hand looked extremely small against the giant elephant head, but the divine elephant trembled with excitement and happiness.

“Stand up.” said Huang Xiaolong.

“Yes, thank you, Master!” The divine elephant Xiang Xuan thanked Huang Xiaolong respectfully before getting up.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell upon Xiang Xiaojie.

Xiang Xiaojie’s legs gave out, and he fell to his knees with a ‘plomp.’ He hurriedly crawled towards Huang Xiaolong on his hands and knees while wailing at the top of his lungs, “Master, Xiang Xiaojie was confused for a moment, confused for a moment ah! Master, Old Ancestor, please don’t kill me. I’ve been loyal and faithful to the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan for the past hundreds of thousands of years, so please don’t kill me!”

Ancestor Xiang Hui, Patriarch Xiang Tai, the Grand Elders, and Elders hastened towards Huang Xiaolong in a fluster, as they realized that they were in big trouble. All of them knelt down respectfully before Huang Xiaolong, and saluted loudly, ‘Greetings Master!’

Huang Xiaolong ignored these people, his attention was on Xiang Xiaojie who was kneeling in front of him with snot and tears on his face. His pride and arrogance as a Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elder had vanished completely.

Divine elephant Xiang Xun’s cold gaze fell on Xiang Xiaojie. He said, “You were disrespectful towards the Master, and even dared to think of borrowing my hands to kill him. According to the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s rules, you should die one million times. But you have the nerve to cry for sympathy?” He then turned to Huang Xiaolong and said, “Master, please let Xiang Xun kill this Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s disciple on y our behalf.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded in approval, “Alright.”

‘Xiang Xiaojie had repeatedly tempted Xiang Hui and Xiang Tai through voice transmission to kill him and his followers. This had nearly caused his efforts of resurrecting the divine elephant to fail. Indeed, Xiang Xiaojie deserved to die a million times.’

If Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai would have interrupted Huang Xiaolong while resurrecting the divine elephant, they would have wasted all of Huang Xiaolong’s efforts thus far; not to mention, the backlash would have severely injured his soul, affecting his breakthrough to God King Realm in the future.

Xiang Xiaojie was terrified as he heard Huang Xiaolong grant Xiang Xun his permission for killing him.

The divine elephant Xiang Xun opened his mouth and blew a ball of black flames at Xiang Xiaojie. The black flames enshrouded Xiang Xiaojie, and he screamed with an agonizing pain.The black flames incinerated Xiaojie’s body part by part,starting from his arms, legs, and lastly the rest of his body.

The Ten Thousand Clan’s group paled hearing Xiang Xiaojie’s heart-wrenching screams.

Both Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai broke out in cold sweat. They too were guilty, since they had decided to kill Huang Xiaolong due to Xiang Xiaojie’s repeated inducement.

Moments later, Xiang Xiaojie was completely incinerated, including his godhead. During this whole time, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s group remained kneeling on the ground, holding their breaths.

“Black Infernal Divine Fire is mediocre.” While everyone held their breaths in apprehension, the little cow walked over with her tail swinging lazily.

Everyone blanked momentarily blanked.

However, divine elephant Xiang Xun looked at the little cow and asked with astonishment, “You know about the Black Infernal Divine Fire?”

The Black Infernal Divine Fire was one of the desolate era’s divine fires. Since he was sealed into a stone, it had disappeared for numerous years. But surprisingly, this little cow was able to recognize it! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The little cow raised her head and said, “Know about merely the Black Infernal Divine Fire? I also know about the Myriad Circles Indestructible Divine Fire.”

The divine elephant Xiang Xun shook at her words. The Myriad Circles Indestructible Divine Fire! This cow even knows about that!

The Myriad Circles Indestructible Divine Fire was the most powerful divine fire amongst the desolate era’s divine fires, but it had disappeared long before the Black Infernal Divine Fire.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the snobbish expression on the little cow’s face and felt like laughing. ‘This old cow is again putting on an act.’

“You’re the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Patriarch?” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on Patriarch Xiang Tai.

Xiang Tai inevitably trembled and respectfully replied in a fluster, “Yes, Master, I am the current Patriarch of Ten Thousand Elephant Clan.” His heart was beating wildly.

“Send people to lockdown the square, I don’t want a word about today to leak out.” Huang Xiaolong ordered.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t want the news of his successful resurrection of the divine elephant to leak out.
