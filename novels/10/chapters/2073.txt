Chapter 2074: The Divine Tree of Darkness

Forty-plus low-level Sovereigns!

That did not include the big six mid-level Sovereigns, Reverence Moon Old Man, the little cow, King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, King of Darkness, and Du Hai!

With Huang Xiaolong in the mix, there were fifty-one Sovereign Realm experts!

Fifty-one Sovereigns! This level of firepower could destroy the myriad worlds.

Even Huang Xiaolong’s heart skipped a beat in shock when the final number of Sovereigns was reported to him.

In the past, this level of the grand scene was something beyond Huang Xiaolong’s imagination. When he was still a mere Heavenly Monarch, dreaming of having a Sovereign as a subordinate was a luxury.

On further thoughts, these Sovereigns came from Hell’s three worlds, Divine World, Radiance World, Demon World, Dragon World, Fiend World, and Fire World. Hence, there was nothing to be surprised about it.

When all Sovereigns were assembled, Huang Xiaolong and everyone else boarded the Ancient Heavenly Court. They tore through the fabric of space, and departed to the World of Darkness faster than the speed of light.

While Huang Xiaolong’s group set off to the World of Darkness, inside a grandiose palace somewhere in the World of Darkness, Wan Zhuoyuan and the Heavenly World’s Tian Yu were seated at the head of the great hall and seated by the two young men’s sides were Bei Xiaomei and Bei Xiaoji.

However, the sisters’ godforce seemed to be restrained by some kind of technique that one could not sense any aura from them. It was as if they were mortals.

On both sides of the great hall sat experts of the City of All-Heavens and Heavenly World.

Each of them exuded the aura of a Sovereign that was as vast as the heaven and earth. Clearly, all of them were Sovereign Realm experts. Even so, they were only-low-level Sovereigns. There were thirty-two of them in total.

This time, the City of All-Heavens and Heavenly World had deployed all the low-level Sovereigns they had for procuring the Darkness Gold Fruit.

Wan Yue, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen, and the rest of the usual faces were absent from the great hall.

“I’ve got the news that Huang Xiaolong has summoned Hell’s three worlds, Divine World, Demon World, and Radiance World’s Sovereign Realm experts. They are on their way here to the World of Darkness,” Tian Yu said.

Wan Zhuoyuan wasn’t perturbed by the news at all, “That kid really knows how to pick a time. Based on the Ancient Heavenly Court’s speed, they would arrive before the Darkness Gold Fruit arrives. There are still seven days left. I couldn’t help anticipating this.” He turned slightly to the side towards Bei Xiaomei as he went on, “But, your Uncle is only rushing over to the World of Darkness to rescue you. It looks like your position in your Uncle’s heart is not so high.”

Bei Xiaomei was seething as she glared fiercely at Wan Zhuoyuan, “Don’t waste any effort trying to provoke discord. When my Uncle arrives, he will definitely defeat you and kill you with his own hands!”

Hearing that, Wan Zhuoyuan wasn’t angry at all. Instead, he laughed loudly, “Defeat me? Oo~oh, I’m so scared ah! It looks like you’re very confident about your Uncle. In a few days, I’ll let you witness with your own eyes how I’m going to kill your Uncle, and after I’ve dealt with your Uncle, I’ll finish with you!”

“I’ll have Huang Xiaolong watch how I’m going to pack up his woman!” Wan Zhuoyuan snickered lecherously as he added, “I get excited just imagining Huang Xiaolong vomiting blood from anger.”

“You!” Bei Xiaomei’s anger spiked, “Shameless, you’re dreaming!”

“You’ll find out soon enough if this is a dream.”

Wan Zhuoyuan continued to tease Bei Xiaomei. “Right now, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation is probably at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Maybe it’s already at the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm! Even if he’s already a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor, I’m certain to render him half-dead with one strike!”

“As for you, I guarantee to make you hover between heaven and hell as well!”

Bei Xiaomei’s face was red with anger and shame as she glared fiercely at Wan Zhuoyuan.

Tian Yu, who had been quiet so far, said to Wan Zhuoyuan, “Then again, I have to admit that Huang Xiaolong is very talented. His battle strength is definitely not weak. You should still be careful. Don’t forget that he has the Ancient Heavenly Court as a trump card!”

Wan Zhuoyuan snickered nonchalantly, “Don’t worry. Even if he’s already broken through to Sovereign Realm and has the Ancient Heavenly Court, I can still defeat him easily.”

Tian Yu nodded, “I trust your ability and combat power.”

“I wonder how’s the situation on my father’s side with the Great Killing Formation?” Wan Zhuoyuan suddenly changed the topic. “Although our main target this time is Huang Xiaolong, we must not let those old fogies King of Darkness, King of Grandmist, and the others escape!”

Tian Yu reassured him confidently, “With my Heavenly World’s enforcement teams and two senior captains, Xu Yang and Liu Yunyun, as well as the Great Killing Formation, it is certainly sufficient to trap the King of Darkness, King of Grandmist, and those old men. It might be troublesome killing overlords like them, but low-level Sovereigns like Elan, and the rest, all of them will surely die!”

“A toast to our victory in advance!” Wan Zhuoyuan raised his wine cup at Tian Yu. The present All-Heavens City and Heavenly World’s Sovereigns followed and raised their cups in a good mood and gulped down their wine. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

......

As the time for the Darkness Gold Fruit to ripen drew closer, undercurrents surged stronger as the number of experts from various directions arriving at the World of Darkness increased rapidly.

Many of them were hidden experts and old monsters who had not appeared for a long time. Some of them were sect founders, cults’ old devils, and even characters that had existed from ancient times.

A great storm was brewing within the World of Darkness.

Six days went by in the blink of an eye.

On this day, the World of Darkness’s tranquil airspace suddenly rippled violently as a massive flying palace emerged from the void. This was precisely the Ancient Heavenly Court, carrying Huang Xiaolong’s group.

The moment Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the World of Darkness, they immediately sensed the intangible killing intent surging in the atmosphere. But Huang Xiaolong didn’t pay it any attention as he directed the Ancient Heavenly Court towards the Divine Tree of Darkness’s location.

The Divine Tree of Darkness was the World of Darkness’ most valued divine tree, and deeply rooted in the World of Darkness’s core space. This core space was called the inception space.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the entrance to the inception space.

The inception space’s entrance stretched several hundred thousand li wide, right in the air of the World of Darkness like a giant beast with its mouth wide open.

Huang Xiaolong’s group did not delay at the entrance and directly entered the inception space.

The inception space was extremely vast. It was big enough to fit in several hundred thousand huge world surfaces. However, Huang Xiaolong’s group immediately spotted the colossal black tree that grew taller than the eyes could see. The tree was visible from any corner of the inception space.

“It’s the trunk of the Divine Tree of Darkness!” The Reverence Moon Old Man said, squinting his eyes as he looked at the black tree.

Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted. That’s just the Divine Tree of Darkness’ tree trunk!

This Divine Tree of Darkness gave a much bigger impact than the Asura World’s divine tree.

The entire time, the little cow had been seriously observing the Divine Tree of Darkness. She finally spoke, “The Divine Tree of Darkness’s light of darkness has already condensed. The Darkness Gold Fruit will ripe soon, in half a day at most!”

Huang Xiaolong opened his heavenly eyes to survey the surroundings and discovered there was a faint glowing blacklight swirling on the Divine Tree of Darkness’s trunk. This faint black light was slowly concentrating on the tree.

“We’re heading over!”

The Ancient Heavenly Court accelerated forward towards the Divine Tree of Darkness.
