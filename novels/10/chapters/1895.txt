Huang Xiaolong looked at the icy creature beside him, and he was stunned for a second. As it turns out, this guy is an Ice Dragon! No wonder I can feel the bloodline of a dragon running through its veins.

After retracting his gaze from the icy creature, Huang Xiaolong looked at Huo Liucheng and his group.

When they met his gaze, they subconsciously took a step back. Terror gripped their hearts.

Huo Yiyang was an early-Ninth Order Emperor. Out of all the experts Huo Liucheng had brought with him, Huo Yiyang was the second strongest! Now that he was sent flying with a single hit from the Ice Dragon around Huang Xiaolong, everyone realized how terrifying this icy beast was.

They weren’t wrong. Huang Xiaolong had summoned an ice dragon at the peak of the late-Ninth Order Emperor Realm.

Even though it was only at the peak of the late-Ninth Order Emperor Realm, with the bloodline of the Heavenly Dragon and the frigid qi around it, there was no way for an early-Ninth Order Emperor like Huo Yiyang to take a blow from it, even more, when he was unprepared.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less as he took several steps towards Huo Liucheng and the rest,

When they saw that Huang Xiaolong was making his way towards them, a look of shock appeared on their faces.

“Brat, who are you?!” Another ancestor level figure from the Violet Python Empire, Huo Xuanguang, blocked Huang Xiaolong’s path. His face was gloomy as he spoke, “Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you have a peak late-Ninth Order Ice Dragon. If we really want to kill you, you won’t be able to escape from dying a miserable death!”

Huo Xuanguang was the strongest expert Huo Liucheng had brought with him. He was at the early-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, and according to him, even with the protection of the Ice Dragon, he would be able to kill Huang Xiaolong all the same.

A look of indifference remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “I’ll give you a single chance. If you kill Huo Liucheng, I’ll let you leave.”

Everyone felt a bomb going off in their heads when they heard what he said.

An ugly expression appeared on Huo Xuanguang’s face. Kill Huo Liucheng?! What Huang Xiaolong wanted him to do was nothing more than an outright insult. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Go to hell!” Huo Xuanguang soared through the air as he sent a fist towards Huang Xiaolong’s head. At the same time, he sent another punch towards the Ice Dragon protecting Huang Xiaolong.

As Huo Xuanguang had unleashed his full strength, the Tenth Order Emperor’s aura expanded and filled the area as earth-shattering might came crashing down towards Huang Xiaolong. Everyone widened their eyes in shock.

As for Zhao Rou and the other experts from the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire, their gazes didn’t shift from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

“Does this youngster have something else to rely on?” One of the ancestors asked in surprise.

Chen Qin shook his head. “The Ice Dragon is part of an ancient race, and there aren’t too many of them alive right now. Not a single one has appeared in the past billion years, and subduing a single one is a miracle in itself. He shouldn’t be able to bring out another Ice Dragon...”

There was no way he would believe that Huang Xiaolong would possess another Ice Dragon.

However, just as the words left his lips, another frosty light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body and welcomed Huo Xuanguang’s punch.

An aura no weaker than the one emitted by Huo Xuanguang slammed into his fist, and the air froze. A tyrannical figure appeared and charged towards Huo Xuanguang.

Huo Xuanguang was like a kite with a broken string with an ear-shattering collision as he flew through the air uncontrollably. As he spun round and round, he knocked into countless experts from the Violet Python Empire behind him before smashing into a massive rock on the peak of the mountain. That wasn’t the end. As the rock crumbled to dust, Huo Xuanguang was sent tumbling down the mountain.

As his body rolled down the mountain, a layer of ice slowly formed around him. He turned into an ice statue, and brilliant rays of light reflected off him, piercing into the eyes of everyone present.

Everyone stared at his body in shock.

Huo Xuanguang, a Tenth Order Emperor, was defeated just like that?!

Even Zhao Rou and the members of the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire stared at the other Ice Dragon, dumbstruck.

The Ice Dragon that had just appeared was several times stronger than the one that had sent Huo Yiyang flying.

Chen Qin sucked in a cold breath and refused to believe his eyes.

He took several deep breaths and tried to calm himself. That’s a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Ice Dragon!

It was a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Ice Dragon that possessed the Heavenly Dragon’s bloodline and supreme frigid qi! This!!!

He didn’t dare to believe that the young man before him had managed to subdue an Ice Dragon at that level!

Even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert like him felt some fear when he saw the newly summoned Ice Dragon!

Zhao Rou and several other experts from the Two-headed Devil Dragon Empire turned to look at Chen Qin. An awkward look appeared on his face. Didn’t he say something about the Ice Dragon being rare, and there was no way for the youngster to subdue another one?

Chen Qin coughed and tried to explain himself. “He should only have two of them! It’s impossible for him to have a third!”

By the time he spoke, Huang Xiaolong had already started walking towards the Violet Python Empire’s members.

Huo Liucheng and the others finally started to panic.

Even though there were thirteen of them left, the strongest expert they had was only at the late-Seventh Order Emperor Realm.

With Huo Yiyang and Huo Xuanguang failing to take even a single hit from Huang Xiaolong’s Ice Dragons, there was no need to mention the late-Seventh Order Emperor. Even when they combined their strength, they wouldn’t be able to take a single hit.

Huo Liucheng looked into Huang Xiaolong’s cold eyes, and unrestrained fear appeared in his heart. The feeling of death seemed to approach closer and closer.

Even though he didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would dare to kill him, he saw the look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. It was as though he was already a dead man walking in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“You!” Huo Liucheng suppressed the fear in his heart and asked, “What do you want?”

A cold chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. What do I want? I already allowed you to live two days ago. I never thought that you would bring so many men here with you today. I have already given you a chance. In fact, I gave you another chance when you appeared.”

Huo Liucheng’s expression turned ugly beyond comparison. It was true, Huang Xiaolong had indeed given him a chance previously. He had even asked them to get out of his sight.

However, he ignored Huang Xiaolong’s kind reminder.

Huo Liucheng sighed and decided to concede. “Fine. We’ll leave now.”

According to him, he would be giving Huang Xiaolong enough face if he left now.

“Leave? Do you really think that you still can leave?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Huo Liucheng and his group of experts stood frozen to their spot as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Zhao Rou looked at Chen Qin in astonishment. Does he really want to...?

“Go.” Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and relayed his command to the two Ice Dragons.

In an instant, they charged towards Huo Liucheng and his group.

Their speed was frighteningly fast, and frigid qi filled the air as it avalanched towards the experts from the Violet Python Empire. Before they could react, they had already turned into ice statues.

The two Ice Dragons didn’t care, and they swept their tails towards those ice statues. In an instant, the experts of the Violet Python Empire, whose bodies had turned into ice statues, shattered. Shards of ice filled the air.

Miserable shrieks rang through the sky.

More than half of the army Huo Liucheng had brought with him disappeared in several breaths of time.

“Bring the prince, and get out of here!” The strongest expert left from the Violet Python Empire roared as he threw himself towards the two Ice Dragons.

It was too bad his body froze after he rose into the air. After turning into an ice statue, he went crashing back down towards the ground.

......

After a few minutes...

Huo Liucheng looked at the fragments of ice around him as the blood drained from his face. He took several steps back in retreat.

The atmosphere around them seemed to have frozen, and everyone who had wanted to watch how Huo Liucheng took care of Huang Xiaolong fell silent. Their legs started to shake, and they nearly fell to the ground in fright.

Over two hundred Heavenly Monarchs and fifteen Emperors were exterminated in a matter of minutes!

Huo Liucheng turned around suddenly and started running towards Zhao Rou and Chen Qin in a last-ditch attempt to survive.
