The moment the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin appeared, no one could sit still. Even Song Litao in private room number one, He Jingyi in private room number two, people with statuses such as Shi Yinyu or Peng Zhengfei, Qin Huangzhong or Zhai Chen, a brilliant flame lit up in their eyes.

All of a sudden, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin roared towards the sky.

The heavens seemed to shake with a single yell from the divine beast.

A ear-shattering cry resounded in the ears of everyone present.

In the next instant, the ancient symbols on the cage formed a cage of light but as the soundwave smashed into the barrier, it trembled unceasingly.

Even though the light barrier stopped a majority of the impact, the disciples of the various clans present felt the blood drain from their faces.

If not for the light barrier, even Tenth-Order Heavenly Monarch Realm cultivators wouldn’t be able to withstand the might of the sound blast. Their hearts would shatter and their meridians would be severed. Their divine soul would dissipate and even if it fails to take their life, they wouldn’t be too far from death.

A single howl demonstrated the power of the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

In the fourth private room, Shi Yinyu exclaimed in admiration, “Nice! It deserves its name as a grandmist divine beast. No wonder it’s considered an imperial qilin...”

One of the ancestors from the Spirit World chuckled, “Only Young Master Shi deserves to obtain the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. Once you bring it into battle alongside you when we wage a war on the Divine World, Young Master Shi will be able to showcase the might of the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe!”

Shi Yinyu laughed in response and he turned around to joke with Peng Zhengfei, “I’m definitely getting this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. Please don’t fight with me for it.”

Peng Zhengfei merely revealed a smile and replied, “I will be unable to subdue this beast... There is no point in getting it anyway.”

“Thank you for giving it up to me.” Shi Yinyu declared with confidence. It was as though he had already obtained the divine beast.

As for Song Litao in private room number one... “Everyone, this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin belongs to my Massacring Gods Gate. If anyone bids for it, you will be going against me. If you’re not afraid of going against my Massacring Gods Gate, go for it!” His voice boomed through the hall and landed in the ears of everyone present for the auction.

As soon as Song Litao’s declaration emerged from his mouth, the elders and ancestors of various families felt the fire in their heart going out.

He Jingyi harrumphed coldly in the second private room.

As for Qin Huangzhong who was in the third room, he laughed coldly. Other people might be afraid of the Massacring Gods Gate, but the Fengdu City in the Ghost World wasn’t a pushover either. It was impossible for them to fear the Massacring Gods Gate.

Even though Song Litao threatened everyone with the name of the Massacring Gods Gate, Zhang Tianle seemed to ignore his action completely. He didn’t even give him a warning.

His superiors had already told him to ignore everything as long as it had anything to do with the Massacring Gods Gate or the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe.

“Everyone, I believe all of you know that this is the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and it is a grandmist divine beast. I hope everyone knows that qilins are extremely rare and they are basically extinct. No one has seen them in the past billions of years, and this beast was obtained by one of the ancestors of my race after risking his life on an expedition. He only managed to bring it back after undergoing extreme lengths.”

“In order to capture this beast, my Dark Roc Family sacrificed two ancestors in the Emperor Realm. As for the grand elders in the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm, countless of them died in the process.”

“All these years, in order to suppress the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, we have expended lots of resources to build this cage.”

As he droned on and on, he spun a grandmother’s tale for everyone’s listening pleasure.

Just before Song Litao, Shi Yinyu, and the rest were about to lose their patience, Zhang Tianle announced the start of the auction. “The auction for the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin will begin at ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones. Each increment must be no less than a hundred thousand. Please begin bidding!”

“Ten million one hundred thousand!” As soon as the words left Zhang Tianle’s lips, Song Litao yelled out a bid.

Everyone seemed to turn silent the moment Song Litao spoke.

“Ten million two hundred thousand!” A voice echoed from the third private room.

“It’s the Ghost World’s Qin Huang!”

Clamor broke out among the crowd.

Fengdu City was the strongest superpower in the Ghost World! It’s might was unrivaled!

The City Lord of Fengdu City was Qin Fan, and he was the number one expert in the Ghost World. Rumors had it that even the old ancestor of the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe, Zong Shiming, was fearful of facing Qin Fan head-on.

As for Qin Huangzhong, he was the youngest son of Qin Fan! He was also the son Qin Fan loved and doted on the most.

In fact, Qin Huangzhong’s reputation was larger than Song Litao in all three worlds of Hell.

Hearing that someone was competing with him for the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, Song Litao’s expression turned gloomy. However, before he could continue to bid, Shi Yinyu’s voice sounded out from the fourth room. “Ten million four hundred thousand!”

Ten million four hundred thousand!

In an instant, the price jumped by two hundred thousand!

Everyone felt their jaws dropping in shock. That was two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones!

“Ten million six hundred thousand!” A chilly light flashed through Song Litao’s eyes and he yelled even louder.

Qin Huangzhong started to laugh out loud in his private room. “Since the two of you are being generous, I’m not going to be stingy. Ten million eight hundred thousand!”

“Twenty million.” A delicate voice rang out before anyone could appreciate Qin Huangzhong’s bid.

It was precisely He Jingyi from the Misty Palace!

All the experts present sucked in a cold breath. In just a span of ten breaths, the price doubled! It even reached twenty million low-grade chaos spirit stones! That was two whole million! Many of the family heads, and even ancestors of their race felt their bodies trembling at the thought of that many spirit stones.

Twenty million low-grade chaos spirit stones was something even a superpower like the Asura Gate wouldn’t be able to raise even if they sold the underwear of all their disciples!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the fight going on above him and he didn’t bother calling out a price yet.

“Twenty million one hundred thousand!” Song Litao was the first to break the twenty million barrier. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After calling out a hefty sum of twenty million one hundred thousand everyone remained silent for a moment. Even the auction hall fell into silence.

“The guest in private room number one bids twenty million one hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. Are there any higher bids?” Zhang Tianle’s voice echoed through the hall.

“Twenty million two hundred thousand.” Qin Huangzhong’s voice sounded out all of a sudden.

Right after him, Shi Yinyu’s bid appeared. “Twenty million three hundred thousand!”

“Master, do we...” Fan Hui turned to Huang Xiaolong and asked.

“There’s no need to rush.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and muttered, “The battle has just started.”

Indeed, the battle for the grandmist divine beast had barely started.

“Twenty million eight hundred thousand!” He Jingyi raised the price by half a million at once.

Everyone felt their jaw dropping.

Even Huang Xiaolong was dumbstruck.

Song Litao and Shi Yinyu’s complexion turned extremely gloomy when they heard her bid.

“He Jingyi, you b*tch!” Song Litao raged and he crushed the cup in his hand. “Wait till the day my Massacring Gods Gate conquers the Hell Asura World. I will force you to kneel before me and lick me for days without rest!”

In private room number ten, Zhai Tiancheng shook his head in silence. He wanted to fight for the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, but the moment the price crossed the twenty million mark, it wasn’t something he could obtain. Even though he was equally as famous as Qin Huangzhong, the Heaven Sacrificial City behind him wasn’t known for its wealth. Not to mention their strength... They couldn’t even begin to contend against Fengdu City.

“Thirty million.” Huang Xiaolong, who had kept silent the entire time, finally broke the silence.
