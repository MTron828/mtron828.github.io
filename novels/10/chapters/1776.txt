The Fortune Emperor Palace’s group became anxious, watching Peng Xiao’s name glimmering dimly like a candle in the wind that could go off at any moment. Their hearts were hanging in their throats.

This situation indicated that Peng Xiao was in mortal danger!

If Peng Xiao’s name disappears, then that would mean...!

Thinking of this possibility, Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Li Shan, Golden Brow, Blood Knife, and the others became agitated.

“What to do? What to do?!” Fang Xuanxuan was almost pacing in circles from anxiety.

Zhao Lei sighed, “There is no way we can go inside. We can only hope Xiaolong finds Peng Xiao as soon as possible!”

‘Xiaolong, you must find Peng Xiao quickly.’ Fang Xuanxuan prayed over and over again in her heart.

At this time, inside the Heavenly Court Secret Region, Peng Xiao’s dress sleeves were damp from dripping blood. There was a giant fist imprint on her chest, and the outer edges of the fist imprint exuded ripples of radiance energy. This radiance energy had a corrosive element that continuously corroded her internal organs and godhead.

Besieging her were three disciples from Brightness Emperor Palace and two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples.

These disciples’ cultivation ranged between early to mid-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm and a late-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Peng Xiao forced herself to remain steady as she moved back very slowly. Behind her was the edge of a bottomless sharp cliff.

“The five of you attacked a single woman. I truly did not expect the Grandmist Emperor Palace to have such shameless disciples!” Peng Xiao glared fiercely at the five men opposite her.

The late-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm disciple from Brightness Emperor Palace sneered disdainfully at Peng Xiao’s words, “After killing you, we can collect the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s one million low-grade chaos spirit stones bounty. What’s wrong with being shameless? Moreover, nothing is really shameless in this world.”

The other two Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples chuckled wickedly, and one of them said, “Peng Xiao, I’ve heard you have the Purple Phoenix Physique and that your yin essence is a great supplement, ah. How about this, if you want to live, serve us well, we can spare your life. What do you think?”

“Peii!” Peng Xiao spat in indignance. She glared coldly at them and sneered, “Stop dreaming! Even if I die, I won’t let you lay a finger on me. However, don’t feel smug so fast, as when you go collect your bounty from the Fiend God Emperor Palace, Xiaolong will definitely find out about it. So, even if I die here, Xiaolong will avenge me!”

Huang Xiaolong!

The five disciples’ expressions sank.

It would be a lie to say they were not apprehensive of Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong had suppressed even the Heavenly Prince, so any fool could see that Huang Xiaolong was not as simple as he seemed on the surface.

Peng Xiao’s sneer deepened as her gaze shifted to the two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples. “I heard that when Xiaolong visited the Grandmist Emperor Palace in the past, your Grandmist Emperor sent his personal disciple, the Emperor’s Disciple, to welcome him. You’d better think of the consequences of killing me!”

Panic and dread flickered across the two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples’ eyes.

Although neither of them had witnessed this, they had learned that the Grandmist Emperor had ordered Grand Elder Wu Tianhe’s cultivation to be abolished before expelling him from the Grandmist Emperor Palace for offending Huang Xiaolong!

The late-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple interjected promptly with a cold sneer and said, “Peng Xiao, no need to play mind games at this point. The Heavenly Court has already determined that Huang Xiaolong has no direct relationship with the Grandmist Emperor. The Grandmist Emperor had his personal disciple welcome Huang Xiaolong only because of his talent with a king of supreme godhead. That is why the Grandmist Emperor gave Huang Xiaolong a chance to see him, that is all there is to it.”

He then said to the two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples, “Brother Chen Ming, Brother Zhao Xiaodan, don’t listen to that woman’s nonsense. Think about it. Even if we kill this woman Peng Xiao, who would know if we don’t talk? If you are worried, then the three of us can help you collect the bounty from the Fiend God Emperor Palace. Neither of you needs to show your face. Huang Xiaolong will never find out this matter’s connection with you.”

The two Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples’ eyes shone a little with obvious temptation. A moment later, both finally nodded their heads in agreement.

Zuo Ran inwardly sighed in relief, seeing this.

Though Peng Xiao was merely a peak late-Tenth Order God King Realm, her battle prowess was higher than average that it took the five disciples’ combined efforts to suppress her.

The five advanced towards Peng Xiao.

Peng Xiao took a step back, then another, until she was right at the edge of the cliff.

Snickers sounded from all five men.

“Peng Xiao, unless you decide to blow your body, I advise you to surrender obediently. Pleasure us. It’s pleasurable for you as well, isn’t that a good thing? Let me tell you frankly. After we kill you and get our bounty from the Fiend God Emperor Palace, what can Huang Xiaolong do to us when he learns about it?” The Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple laughed wantonly.

“My Master is the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Wenqian. Huang Xiaolong won’t dare to touch a hair on my body?”

“I don’t think he has the guts!”

The rest laughed in undisguised ridicule.

“You will know very soon if I have the guts.” Suddenly, an icy voice sounded in their ears.

The five men were startled and turned around in a jerk.

“Huang Xiaolong!” The five exclaimed in unison.

Peng Xiao was overjoyed at Huang Xiaolong’s arrival, but she was also slightly dazed with disbelief. How? She had never imagined Huang Xiaolong could really find her.

“Xiaolong, you, is it really you? Really, really?!” Peng Xiao’s eyes were red-rimmed with tears threatening to fall.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at her and smiled, “Can I be fake?”

Peng Xiao bloomed like a sea of flowers after the rain, at his response.

Before entering the Heavenly Court Secret Region, Huang Xiaolong had given Peng Xiao a protection talisman. This protection talisman was actually given to him by the King of Grandmist, and it came as a pair. As long as Peng Xiao was in danger and activated the talisman’s power, Huang Xiaolong would sense Peng Xiao’s location with other talisman’s help.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over the five disciples.

In a split second, Zuo Ran lunged towards Peng Xiao to capture her as a hostage.

A strong killing intent flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, seeing the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple’s intentions to use Peng Xiao as a hostage. He was already blocking Peng Xiao in a flicker, while he raised his fist and punched to the front.

Poof!

In the next second, the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple Zuo Ran spewed blood from his mouth, and his flesh ruptured. By the time he fell to the ground, there was nothing but a puddle of blood.

The stifling blood scent and the pieces of internal organs on the ground nauseated the other four disciples.

“Huang Xiaolong, my Master is the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestor Chen Wenqian.” The same disciple, who had claimed that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t have the guts to do anything, shouted and suppressed the fear that was spreading in his chest as he added, “You...!”

Before he could finish his words, Huang Xiaolong slapped him across space like he was swatting a fly, flattening the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple into a human-shaped meat cake into the ground.

The remaining three disciples were bloodlessly pale at this point.

Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze fell on them as he spoke, “Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. Each of you can say one sentence, and if your reason can move me, I will spare your life.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Hope flared in Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciple Chen Ming’s heart, and he almost shouted, “Huang Xiaolong, I am a disciple of Grandmist Emperor Palace!”

Huang Xiaolong flicked his fingers, the force sent the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciple flying out, and he exploded into blood-mist in midair.

“Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples, so what?”
