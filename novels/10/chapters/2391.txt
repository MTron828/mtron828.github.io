Chapter 2392: Teng Yunlong’s Death!

Nearly all the sect chiefs followed behind Teng Yunlong as they approached the Elegance Inn. Nearly twenty thousand Venerables made their way towards Huang Xiaolong.

As they didn’t bother concealing their aura, terrifying pressure pressed down on Direction Mountain City.

Faces of fear could be seen throughout the city, as everyone stared at Teng Yunlong and the others who were heading over to Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard. Everyone fell to their knees as though the heavens were collapsing down on them.

In the Elegance Inn, Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes, and he walked out from his room, expressionless.

“Young Master....” Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage greeted him as soon as he appeared.

“Let’s go. We have to loosen our bones a little.” Huang Xiaolong said. “After that, we’ll head to the headquarters of the Four Seas Holy Gate.”

Nodding in agreement, the two of them followed Huang Xiaolong and left the inn.

Riding on their profound beasts, Huang Xiaolong and the others met Teng Yunlong and those who were there to kill him. In the blink of an eye, Teng Yunlong’s group soared into the skies and surrounded the three of them.

Without descending, Teng Yunlong stared at Huang Xiaolong’s party of three before directing his gaze towards Huang Xiaolong. “Are you the one who killed my brother and an Eminent Elder of my Teng Family?”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong replied calmly.

When Teng Yunlong noticed Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant attitude, he couldn’t help but rage. Killing intent shot out from his eyes.

One of the grand elders of the Four Seas Holy Gate stepped forward and snorted, “Brat, you’re too arrogant! How dare you act so casually after killing His Highness’ younger brother?! You better get on your knees right now and beg His Highness for forgiveness! Otherwise, we’ll tear your tendons from your body and....”

Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong raised his arm and slapped it outwards.

“Argh!”

A single slap rang through the skies, followed by a miserable shriek. However, the screams didn’t last for long as the grand elder turned into a mist of blood.

Blood rained down on those present, and everyone behind Teng Yunlong revealed a look of disbelief. They couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath as their expressions fell. Even Han Jiangcheng felt his chest tightening.

A grand elder of the Four Seas Holy Gate was an existence at the Ninth Order Venerable Realm!

However, he was killed by that youngster with a single strike!”

“You! Early-Ninth Order Venerable Realm!” Han Jiangcheng stared at Huang Xiaolong, and he gasped in shock.

The members of the Teng Family, who were bursting with killing intent, couldn’t help but stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. Yang Nan and the others were equally surprised.

Early-Ninth Order Venerable Realm?

Teng Yunlong touched his face and noticed that it was stained red with blood. Waves surged in his heart and his hands trembled in fear.

This....

He stared at Huang Xiaolong with a terrified gaze as shock filled his heart. No matter how hard he tried to overestimate Huang Xiaolong’s strength, the other party still managed to shock him. Even as an early-Ninth Order Venerable, he had managed to kill a grand elder of the Four Seas Holy Gate with a single slap!

“No wonder you had the courage to run rampant!” Teng Yunlong growled as he suppressed the fear in his heart. He glared at Huang Xiaolong. “It’s too bad you’ll have to die even if you were a Tenth Order Venerable!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at Han Jiangcheng and the others behind him and asked, “Are you so confident in their abilities?”

A sense of irritation filled the hearts of everyone behind Teng Yunlong in an instant.

The faces of Han Jiangcheng and the various experts of the continent fell. “Brat, you’re too arrogant! Do you think that you can take on all of us at once? You’re just a puny little Ninth Order Venerable! Do you really think that you’re a half-True Saint?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to waste time speaking to Han Jiangcheng, and his fist shot out. The space crumbled around it as it flew towards Han Jiangcheng’s chest.

Terrifying might surged towards Han Jiangcheng, and his expression changed when he felt the power behind Huang Xiaolong’s punch. Unable to think clearly, he pushed himself to the limit and attacked! “Taiji Extermination!”

A whirlpool appeared in the air and a yin yang diagram welcomed Huang Xiaolong’s punch as destructive might emerged from the yin yang symbol.

When the two forces collided, a massive explosion rang through the air. The yin yang diagram sent out by Han Jiangcheng was shattered in an instant as Huang Xiaolong’s fist continued on its way to its target.

However, Han Jiangcheng wasn’t fortunate enough to take on Huang Xiaolong’s fist. Before the punch could arrive, his body was shattered by the immense energy contained in the strike.

He was like a firework that bloomed in the morning sky. As droplets of blood fell to the ground, Han Jiangcheng’s life came to an end.

Silence filled the area as everyone stared at the blood-red ground. None of them dared to move a single muscle.

“Too weak.” Huang Xiaolong stared at the spot where Han Jiangcheng once stood and snorted.

The moment the words left his lips, it was like a demonic chime that slammed into the hearts of the present experts. Teng Yunlong and the members of the Four Seas Holy Gate felt their hearts clenching in fear.

“Lord... Lord Continent Master!” One of the experts screamed. However, he was met with no reply.

“You... you....” Teng Yunlong snapped back to reality and stared at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous expression. He hadn’t dared to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be daring enough to make a move on the continent master! Neither had he thought that Huang Xiaolong would kill Han Jiangcheng with a single punch!

One punch!

If Huang Xiaolong shocked them when he killed the grand elder in a single hit, they were flabbergasted when they saw what Huang Xiaolong did to Han Jiangcheng.

How could that happen? Was it even possible? He was a mere early-Ninth Order Venerable, but his combat strength was terrifying enough to kill anyone under the half-True Saint Realm! Even the chief disciple of the Holy Princes in the Four Seas Holy Gate wouldn’t be able to do it!

“Who are you?!” Teng Yunlong screamed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Someone who’s about to kill you.” Huang Xiaolong replied with a placid expression as he reached out with a single arm. Teng Yunlong felt the space around him crunching down on him. They were like mountain ranges crushing down on a tiny mouse, and Teng Yunlong was that poor little creature!

In the next instant, Teng Yunlong popped like a bubble. Blood rained down on the lands once again.

No one managed to control their bodies as they shivered uncontrollably.

“Teng... Teng Yunlong?! Your Highness!” The grand elders of the Four Seas Holy Gate found it hard to breathe as they called out to the Holy Prince.

“Kill him!” Teng Heqing roared as a crazed look appeared in his eyes. He leaped out of the crowd and screamed, “Kill him right now! If he escapes, all of you will have to die!”

The various experts finally reacted when they heard what he said.

However, the profound beast under Huang Xiaolong seemed to have expected their response as it raised its head to the sky to release a heaven-shaking roar. Terrifying waves of energy slammed downwards and surged towards the present experts.

Under the suppression of the energy wave summoned by the profound beast, not a single person managed to move.

A whirlwind was swept up, and it slowly tore the motionless experts into pieces.
