Chapter 2455: Challenge the Entire Holy World

Xie Yao complied.

"Also, tell them that if they could defeat Huang Xiaolong, I will give them another double amount of holy spiritual jade stones!" Li Chen added through gritted teeth.

Xie Yao nodded his head as he answered yes, then added, "Rest assured, Senior Brother Li Chen. Anyone would be tempted by this kind of heavy reward and there should be many Third Tribulation half-True Saints coming to be of service to you very soon!"

Upon hearing that, Li Chen’s ugly expression eased slightly as he nodded.

As Xie Yao said, under the lure of lucrative reward, some of the Third Tribulation half-True Saints that were currently at the Mirage Pavilion were moved by the reward, and they rushed over.

Before long, Li Chen was able to organize another fifty Third Tribulation half-True Saint disciples to start the fourth round of the challenge.

But the final result was that these fifty people became supplements that helped Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads to improve.

Although these fifty people also had complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, these hurriedly recruited experts’ talent and battle strength were much worse compared to the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground, Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and other forces’ disciples. Despite his half-True Saint energy having mostly been exhausted, it was still a breeze for him to deal with them.

After reaping the benefits from these fifty people,. Huang Xiaolong once again sat cross-legged on the stage and adjusted his condition.

The Holy Mandate Imprint between Huang Xiaolong’s forehead shone with brilliant luster as the Holy World’s origin energy surged like a great river that was hanging down from the void.

By the end of the third round, Huang Xiaolong’s three complete dao saint godheads had already risen up several places in the ranks, getting closer into the top twenty. Driven by his three complete dao saint godheads and Holy Mandate Imprint, the Holy World’s origin energy entered endlessly into Huang Xiaolong’s body, allowing his exhausted energy to be replenished at an amazing speed.

Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and the others were busy organizing disciples for the fourth round of the challenge, but whatever they were doing came to a stop after they watched Li Chen’s team being annihilated without any suspense, that was still unable to harm a hair on Huang Xiaolong.

For a moment, no one from the Black Inferno Race, Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, Blue Whale Race, and Devil Palace sent their disciples up to the battle stage anymore, which indirectly gave Huang Xiaolong more time to recover.

Huang Xiaolong’s energy was spent after a day’s killing, but with three complete dao saint godheads and Holy Mandate Imprint, he recovered in a short time.

In a short one hour, Huang Xiaolong’s condition had returned to the peak.

However, Huang Xiaolong pretended to be far from recovering his strength, and continued to sit cross-legged, absorbing the Holy World’s origin energy.

Soon, the silver moon hung high in the night sky.

The battle stage’s surroundings were unusually quiet.

The various forces’ experts looked at Huang Xiaolong with complicated gazes.

Although Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and the rest did not stop the disciples of their forces to challenge Huang Xiaolong, none of them left the place for they dared not!

It was too hard for them to believe that not only they had lost over sixty Holy Princes of outstanding talents, but also precious saint artifacts! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This was especially true for the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, whose Black Serpent Rope was taken away by Huang Xiaolong. How would Shen Jiewen be willing to leave just like that? Thinking of his Black Serpent Rope, Sui Yunfeng, and other disciples, hatred boiled over in his heart! He hated heaven and earth, and he hated Huang Xiaolong!

But neither heaven nor earth gave him a reply!

And Huang Xiaolong, whom he hated, was adjusting his breath!

Upon observing Huang Xiaolong, who was adjusting his condition, Shen Jiewen wanted nothing more than to rush up the stage and slap Huang Xiaolong into meat paste.

The night’s darkness gradually receded as the dawn’s sunlight peeked over the horizon.

After a night of adjusting his condition, Huang Xiaolong stood up.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Li Chen, Xie Bufan, and the rest, as the corner of his mouth curved up in a smile. “Not planning to send your disciples up to continue the challenge? Merely the first day has passed, and you’ve already given up? Are you giving up on the above grandmist holy spiritual aura?” His finger moved up and down as he pointed at the above dragon.

The golden dragon manifestation of grandmist holy spiritual aura coiled docilely in the air, breathing in and exhaling the Holy World’s holy spiritual qi.

Under the morning sunlight, the golden dragon scales glistened so bright that Duan Xuan and the others had to close their eyes.

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly, and then turned to Wu Ge, “Since no one is going to continue challenging, Grand Hall Master Wu Ge, I’ll trouble you to help me make an announcement to the Holy World, any holy ground, any ancient race, and any sect that they can send their disciples to challenge me on this battle stage. The conditions and rules are the same, they can send fifty disciples below Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm to challenge me, and as long as they defeat me, they can take away this grandmist holy spiritual aura dragon!”

When Shen Jiewen heard what Huang Xiaolong said, there were many words he wanted to say, but he could not get them out.

They had a previous agreement with Huang Xiaolong that if none of the thirty-nine forces challenged Huang Xiaolong, then Huang Xiaolong could allow other forces to challenge him.

Wu Ge blanked for a second as his brain processed Huang Xiaolong’s words. Huang Xiaolong was planning to issue a challenge to the entire Holy World... right? He reacted and complied, then started sending out Huang Xiaolong’s words.

In an instant, the Holy World was in an uproar.

The three ladies, Lin Xiaoying, Tan Juan, and Ji Xinyi heard that Huang Xiaolong planned to issue the challenge to the whole Holy World’s holy grounds, ancient races, and sects, and their eyes widened in shock.

This was the first time that somebody had challenged the entire Holy World...?!

Though it was actually a challenge to all disciples below Fourth Tribulation half-True Saints, this action in itself was formidable. Don’t forget that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was just at the Second Tribulation half-True Saint at the moment.

Moreover, the opponents were allowed to form a team of fifty people.

When the news of Huang Xiaolong challenging the entire Holy World’s disciples below Fourth Tribulation half-True Saints reached the Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, and Elder Crow, all four Primal Ancestors were dazed for a good while.

The Heavenly Master chuckled wryly, “That little guy is planning to turn our Holy Heavens organisation into the entire Holy World’s common enemy, is he?”

If Huang Xiaolong killed a Holy Prince from every holy ground in the Holy World, it was equivalent to the Holy Heavens offending all these holy grounds once and for all.

Tyrant Chu laughed heartily instead, “So what if we become the entire Holy World’s common enemy? As a man, one should have a domineering personality, and the little guy’s truly my good disciple, as he has the same domineering trait as me!”

After listening to Tyrant Chu indirectly praising himself, left the other three Primal Ancestors speechless.

Lord Long had a complicated expression on his face as he spoke, “Xiaolong that little guy, the speed of his complete dao saint godheads’ evolution has greatly exceeded our estimation. At this rate of progress, it seems like his complete dao saint godheads could enter the top ten in several hundred years, right?”

Top ten!

Not to mention that Huang Xiaolong possesses two complete dao saint godheads!

Thinking of this possibility, the four Primal Ancestors’ hearts thumped wildly.

Envy and jealousy were written on Tyrant Chu’s face, “Even I am envious to death at his talent, but luckily, he is our personal disciple! If he had chosen to join the Devil Palace instead of our Holy Heavens at that time...!”

The four Primal Ancestors shuddered at the probable mayhem.

There was a pensive look in the Heavenly Master’s eyes as he spoke, “I feel this is not the limit of the little guy’s potential, there must be something he’s keeping a secret from us. The Departing Sword Sage has always been a very proud person, so how could he be willing to follow Huang Xiaolong? Moreover, Yu Ming is an elder of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate. Logically speaking, it is impossible for him to betray the Beast Tamer Holy Gate.”

Tyrant Chu responded half-jokingly, “You won’t be trying to tell me that Xiaolong convinced them with his strength?”

“This is naturally impossible, and this is also the point that baffles me,” said the Heavenly Master, shaking his head.

As strong as Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength was, he was still a Second Tribulation half-True Saint. Naturally, the Heavenly Master wouldn’t be so foolish to assume a Second Tribulation half-True Saint could suppress True Saints like the Departing Sword Sage and Yu Ming purely relying on strength.

“However, Li Chen and Xiaolong’s battle stage bet, do we want to...?” Lord Long frowned as he spoke of the matter. If Li Chen comes out on the losing side, he would have to lick the bottom of Huang Xiaolong’s shoes in public. One could imagine the devastating blow to Li Chen if he lost. After all, Li Chen was his personal disciple, he was naturally unwilling to see this result.

The Heavenly Master shook his head, “We won’t interfere in the matters of the younger generation. Let them settle it themselves. From another angle, this is a kind of an experience for them.”
