Chapter 3695 – What’s Going On

Practically every single expert in the palace emerged!

She could also see her Third, Fourth, Fifth… Grandfathers running out behind Devouring Devil! After them came people of the royal family like her father, the Ice Devil. Her father stood right at the back of the line!

Her eyes widened in shock.

She contacted reinforcements to take the group standing outside the palace down, but she didn’t expect so many experts to appear!

Moreover, every single expert who was a general or higher came out!

What in the world was going on?!

The status of her grandfathers was so high that she couldn’t meet them even if she wanted to!

Ever since her birth, she hadn’t seen all her grandfathers gathered together!

As for the subordinates behind her, there was no need to speak for them.

In fact, the Dazzling Sun Princess wasn’t the only one who was surprised. Everyone who came from inside the palace were equally as stunned. When Devouring Devil and the others emerged from the palace, they noticed the Dragon Overlord standing in front of the gates!

He wasn’t the only one!

The God of Death stood right beside him, and Zhu Chen came right after!

Behind them was a whole bunch of region masters!

The three of them actually came with an entourage of region masters!

What in the world…

Even the marshals and great generals felt the world spinning around them.

Glaring at the guard captain beside him, Devouring Devil silently cursed at him. When he made the report earlier, he only said that Lord Dragon was present. He didn’t say anything about the rest.

In fact, Devouring Devil was wrong. The only person who identified himself was the Dragon Overlord. How would the guard captain recognize the others?!

The guard captain felt his entire face cramping up as the hair on his body stood on end.

He had no idea that that was his last day as the guards captain. Devouring Devil had already decided to demote him the moment they got back.

After looking at the captain, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Waves crashed against his fragile little heart as the young man he was looking at stood before the three supreme overlords!

What was going on?!

Who in the world was the kid?!

He racked his brain to think of every single expert in the Unknown Space whose status was above the three, but he failed to think of any.

As for the Dazzling Sun Princess and the experts behind her, they were completely overlooked.

The Devouring Devil ran all the way to the entrance.

When the Dazzling Sun Princess snapped out of her confusion and wanted to greet Devouring Devil, Devouring Devil cupped his fists and greeted the supreme overlords. “Mo Ren greets Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen! Lords brought so many cultivators over to our celestial empire and we deserve to be punished for not welcoming you properly!”

Mo Ren was the Devouring Devil’s true name.

The Dazzling Sun Princess felt as though a thunderbolt was running through her mind.

Dragon Overlord!

God of Death!

Zhu Chen! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Weren’t they…

She saw her other grandfathers cupping their fists as they greeted the supreme overlords. “We greet Lord Dragon, Lord Death, and Lord Zhu Chen!”

Eventually, her father and her uncles bowed to greet members of Huang Xiaolong’s party.

As for the various generals and marshals, they got to their knees.

The Dazzling Sun Princess felt her brain hurting.

She thought that she heard Mo Ren wrongly when he greeted them.

Now, she realized that they were serious!

The servants behind her fell to their knees in fright when they saw the generals kneeling.

The Dragon Overlord looked at Mo Ren and the others and he spoke casually, “This is Lord Huang Xiaolong!”

Mo Ren jumped in fright when he heard how the Dragon Overlord addressed Huang Xiaolong, he knew that the real master was standing before him.

One could only imagine what type of existence the Dragon Overlord and the others would take as their master.

Mo Ren cupped his fist and bowed respectfully, “Mo Ren, the second son of the Ferocious Devil, greets Lord Huang Xiaolong!”

He didn’t bow when he met the other supreme overlords, but he chose to do so towards Huang Xiaolong.

The others quickly did the same.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “There’s no need for such formalities. I came all the way over here with them in order to look for your father. I heard that your older brother, Mo Kun, might know where he is.”

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, Mo Ren continued, “Lord, my older brother went to the Devil Abyss. He will only be back next month.”

“Devil Abyss?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

The Devil Abyss was the most dangerous region in the Devil Land. It was no wonder he didn’t come out to welcome them. Also, it was located quite a distance away from the celestial empire.

“Lord, I got some men to prepare a banquet for you in the palace. Why don’t all of you return to the palace with me and enjoy yourselves while we wait for my older brother to return?” Mo Ren muttered.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong eventually nodded his head.

That was probably the only thing he could do. After all, one month wasn’t a very long time.

With Huang Xiaolong’s group following closely behind, Mo Ren entered the palace carefully.

As the Ice Devil stood at the back of the group, he quickly noticed his daughter’s abnormal behavior. “Ruo’er, why are you standing there? Hurry up and enter the palace with me! If you manage to make a toast to any of the supreme overlords, you will be able to gain a great opportunity!”

“If you manage to catch their eye, you’ll benefit a whole lot if they choose to give you a few pointers!”

One had to know that they were together on the list with the Ferocious Devil!

Even though the members of the celestial empire were descendants of the Ferocious Devil, they hadn’t met their old ancestor! Much less receive his pointers!

“I… I…” The Dazzling Sun Princess started to stutter. Trepidation filled her heart.

She might not have personally made a move against them, but she definitely behaved inappropriately towards them!

Moreover, her subordinate called Huang Xiaolong and the rest several ungodly words…

When the Ice Devil saw the look on his daughter’s face, a bad feeling welled up in his heart.

“Ruo’er, what’s going on?”

The Dazzling Sun Princess looked at him and didn’t know what to say.
