Back in his courtyard, Huang Xiaolong entered the Godly Mt. Xumi, sitting cross-legged at the center of the Xumi Temple. He then began circulating the Asura Tactics.

The Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires’ spirits flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, orbiting around him as two types of star force poured out from the void into him.

Soon, the night gave way to day.

When morning came, Huang Xiaolong ended his practice. He noticed that his internal organs were stronger than ever, tempered by the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Galaxies’ star force, emitting a soft glow like starlight.

“I wonder what will happen if all four great divine fires converge...” A sudden thought flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

After integrating with the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire, a theory formed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind, growing stronger as time passed. If he could integrate with all four divine fires, there should be some kind of transformation. There was a chance that the final product would evolve into a new, higher grade fire that surpassed the four divine fires. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A fire that surpassed the four divine fires! What kind of flame would that be?

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know, but he was sure that it would bring unimaginable benefits to his cultivation path.

Moreover, with four great divine fires converged as one inside his body, his soul’s clarity would be further enhanced by a huge degree, it might even prompt a stunning transformation in his soul.

This further reinforced his goal of condensing a supreme godhead.

The supreme godhead, the king of godheads!

However, the Azure Dragon Divine Fire was in Xiang Mingzhi’s body. Remembering this, an intense murderous aura flickered in his eyes. If he wanted to get his hands on the Azure Dragon Divine Fire, there was only one option, kill Xiang Mingzhi!

If Xiang Mingzhi was dead, the Azure Dragon Divine Fire would be ownerless. At that time, Huang Xiaolong would be able to integrate with it!

Therefore, during the Highgod Advancement Tournament, he must kill Xiang Mingzhi!

Coming out from the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong was about to practice his Asura Sword Skills when he saw Liu Yun and Qi Wen walking in together.

Yesterday, Liu Yun told Qi Wen about the twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones, hence, this morning, both of them came to thank Huang Xiaolong. Qi Wen was especially grateful.

Huang Xiaolong could only accept it, smiling wryly in his heart.

He understood that, although twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stone wasn’t a significant sum to him, to his Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun and Third Apprentice-sister Qi Wen, the twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stone were the thing that saved their lifetime happiness.

In the blink of an eye, four days passed.

In these four days, other than cultivating, Huang Xiaolong would sometimes go to Feng Yang’s courtyard for advice on cultivation.

Of course, Feng Yang told Huang Xiaolong what he knew.

After four days, the day of Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday banquet had finally arrived.

But before they headed to the banquet, Feng Yang had Huang Xiaolong stand in front of him and took out a pale blue divine armor. Feng Yang looked at his disciple, saying, “This is an ancient divine armor I found by chance long ago, called Blue Lion Divine Armor. Now, Master is giving it to you, put it on later.”

Blue Lion Divine Armor!

Standing close at the sides, Liu Yun, Qi Wen, and Chen Yang each had different thoughts.

As an ancient treasure, the Blue Lion Divine Armor had a strong defensive power, and it was one of the top-tier divine armors amongst those known in the four galaxies. Naturally, it was extremely precious. However, there was a crucial point to this; before Feng Yang received Huang Xiaolong as his disciple, he had told his three other disciples, Liu Yun, Chen Yang, and Qi Wen, that whoever receives this Blue Lion Divine Armor would be the one who succeeds his true legacy!

No one expected Feng Yang to choose this time to give the Blue Lion Divine Armor to Huang Xiaolong.

Liu Yun and Qi Wen looked enviously at Huang Xiaolong, whereas an unnoticeable flicker of hatred flitted passed Chen Yang’s eyes.

Legacy inheritor!

There was difference like heaven and earth between a personal disciple and a legacy inheritor.

A great master can have numerous personal disciples, but there will only be one legacy inheritor!

Huang Xiaolong had no idea of the underlying meaning of his Master giving him the Blue Lion Divine Armor. He hid a wry smile looking at the divine armor emitting a soft blue glow.

With everything said and done, his Master Feng Yang was still doubtful of his strength. No doubt, this Blue Lion Divine Armor was for him to protect himself. But, it was hard to blame Feng Yang for not believing that Huang Xiaolong could stand against disciples on the Highgod Advancement List.

In every term, there were thirty names on the Highgod Advancement List.

Each name represented a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm and above, most of them being peak perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm.

In the four galaxies, there were more than thirty people at peak perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm, however, not everyone could have their name on the Highgod Advancement List. For example, Huang Xiaolong’s Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun. Liu Yun couldn’t even climb to the bottom of the list.

“Master, this Blue Lion Divine Armor, I..” Just as Huang Xiaolong wanted to decline, Feng Yang pulled his face down and stated in an absolute tone, “Don’t say anything more, I already decide to give this to you, put it on this instant.”

This instant?

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Having no choice but to nod and comply, he wore the Blue Lion Divine Armor beneath his robe in front of his Master and Senior Apprentice-brothers and Senior Apprentice-sister.

Only after Huang Xiaolong put on the armor did Feng Yang’s expressions soften into a smile, “With this Blue Lion Divine Armor, that Jiang Hanzhi will have a hard time if he wants to hurt you.”

Hearing Feng Yang bringing up that Highgod Advancement List fifth-ranked Jiang Hanzhi, Huang Xiaolong secretly shook his head.

“But you have to be careful of that Lu Cong’s Ten Thousand Words Dharani.” Feng Yang went one, “That Ten Thousand Words Dharani technique was the ancient Scholarly Gate’s supreme technique, don’t underestimate its power. Lu Cong has already cultivated more than three thousand words, his strength is already comparable to an early First Order Highgod Realm master.

Huang Xiaolong nodded again, acknowledging Feng Yang’s words.

But Feng Yang went on, giving Huang Xiaolong some advice and reminders before the group left the courtyard, heading to the hall where the birthday banquet was held.

Yao Chi’s courtyard was at the peak of Yaochi Mountain, not too far from where Feng Yang and the others were staying, thus it didn’t take them long to reach the banquet venue.

‘Yaochi’ was a pond of several hundred square meters large with white mist floating from its surface. This pond was one of the universe’s natural spiritual energy ponds that brought unimaginable benefits to cultivators practicing inside it.

Around the spiritual energy pond were seated many masters who came from various forces.

Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance around, seeing groups from the Azure Dragon Institute, Vermilion Bird Institute, White Tiger Institute, Jiang Family, Gudu Family, the Celestial Peach Sect, etc. There were many familiar faces.

When Feng Yang arrived, a lot of guests stood up, enthusiastically greeting Feng Yang.

Feng Yang grinned, cupping his fists to return everyone’s greetings before Saint Mother Yao Chi’s maids escorted his group to their seats.

Reaching their designated seat, Feng Yang sat down while Liu Yun, Chen Yang, Qi Wen, and Huang Xiaolong stood behind him. In the banquet, only Highgod Realm masters were qualified to have a seat.

Just as Feng Yang sat down, an equivocal voice sounded, “I say, Feng Yang, based on your disciples’ strength, how thick-faced are they to come and participate in Saint Mother Yao Chi’s banquet? Aren’t you’re afraid that you’ll be embarrassed by them?”

Huang Xiaolong tilted his head slightly toward the source. The person who spoke was the Azure Dragon Institute Principal, Qin Yi. By coincidence or not, Qi Yi’s seat was beside Feng Yang’s, with no more than a three meters distance between them.

Qin Yi’s voice was loud enough to attract the surrounding guests’ attention.

Feng Yang’s face darkened hearing this, his voice cold in retort, “Qin Yi, do you really think Saint Mother Yao Chi is going to choose someone from your Azure Dragon Institute?”

Qin Yi laughed proudly, full of confidence, “In terms of strength, our Azure Dragon has a better chance than your Black Warrior Institute.”
