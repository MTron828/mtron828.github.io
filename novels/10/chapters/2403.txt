Chapter 2404: This Brat is Lying!

Yu Fujiang couldn’t help but feel a burst of joy in his heart when he saw that Huang Xiaolong was about to die! As soon as the kid died, all the treasures on ‘Thirteen’s’ body would belong to him!

He knew that Huang Xiaolong had level-ten origin spiritual pills on his body, and according to what he knew, there were definitely pills more precious than the Vitality Rejuvenating Pills on him.

That was a level ten origin spiritual pill! It was something even high-level True Saints coveted! When the brat died, everything would belong to him!

As Lu Ding was planning to get closer to the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, he would have to hand over the Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast and the pills, whether he liked it or not!

Just as Lu Ding was about to kill Huang Xiaolong, a burst of holy light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Boundless might emerged from his holy soul as a golden phantom appeared behind him. A giant palm appeared in the skies as it slammed towards Lu Ding.

“Four Seas Heavy Palm!”

A cold roar filled the hall.

An uncountable number of palms filled the hall, and it turned into a sea that swallowed Huang Xiaolong’s enemies. The sea formed by his attacks contained holy water that weighed more than a mountain.

Every single drop was several tons in weight, and it was impossible to estimate the weight of the entire sea.

“This... This is the Four Seas Heavy Palm!” Lu Ding yelled in fright as a maniacal expression appeared on his face. He pushed his saint godhead to the limit as holy essence energy poured out of his body. He no longer held back as he used his full strength.

However, it was useless.

Even with his full strength, he couldn’t stop the energy contained in the Four Seas Heavy Essence Palm. As his energy faded away, the energy in Huang Xiaolong’s attack slammed towards him.

Terrifying waves of energy destroyed everything in their path as they swept towards Lu Ding.

Roaring with all his might, Lu Ding unleashed everything he could. “Break! Eternal Fist!”

A different type of energy slowly filled the area, and it was as though everything that entered the scope of his attack would age to infinity. With unstoppable might, it crashed against Huang Xiaolong’s Four Seas Heavy Palm. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Boom!

A massive explosion rang through the hall and the space around the collision was torn beyond belief. Several half-True Saints from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, who failed to avoid the attack, were crushed.

As the terrifying wave of energy continued to sweep towards Yu Fujiang, his face turned ashen as he screamed, “Help... Help me!”

“Your Highness!” One of the True Saints from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate finally reacted. No longer bothering with the Departing Sword Sage, he charged towards Yu Fujiang.

“Yin Yang Blade! Yin Yang Separation!”

The moment the blade energy appeared, it shattered the wave of energy surging towards Yu Fujiang.

As soon as the surroundings cleared, the First Heaven True Saint dragged Yu Fujiang back towards the entrance of the main hall.

Lu Ding arrived beside them soon, but he was in a sorry state as he was forced to retreat by the frighteningly powerful attack Huang Xiaolong unleashed.

He felt the world spinning around him, and he quickly raised his head to look at the golden phantom behind Huang Xiaolong who attacked “You... Holy soul!”

“You have a holy soul!” Yu Fujiang screamed as the other True Saints from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. Even the Eminent Elders, who had no idea how strong Huang Xiaolong was, couldn’t believe their eyes.

Everyone was dumbfounded when they witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

A First Tribulation half-True Saint with a holy soul that is only possessed by True Saint Realm experts... What is the concept behind this?

Half Saint holy soul?! What the fu...

If they were to learn that Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul was born when he was still in the Seventh Order Venerable Realm, no one knew what they would think. Moreover, if they learned that he had more than a single holy soul, they would probably kill themselves.

The only people who could remain calm were Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage. However, the impact they felt when Huang Xiaolong called out his holy soul was a different story altogether. Their hearts shook when they witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s strength for the first time.

It was the makings of a miracle! They were witnessing the birth of a legend since the start of time!

As the Departing Sword Sage retreated several steps, Huang Xiaolong took a couple more steps back in order to regain his footing. From what they observed, Huang Xiaolong seemed to have gained the upper hand in the exchange.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong had managed to deal with a mid-First Heaven True Saint back in the Profound River. However, he had summoned two holy souls in order to do so. Now, Huang Xiaolong could obtain victory with just one holy soul. It was clear that his combat prowess had already advanced to an unfathomable level.

After accepting the Four Seas Holy Emperor’s inheritance, Huang Xiaolong had not only managed to push his cultivation level to the Half Saint Realm, but his holy soul had also experienced a complete evolution.

That was also the reason why Huang Xiaolong could rely on a single holy soul to suppress Lu Ding.

Ignoring everyone in the hall, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Lu Ding.

Even though he had already expected Huang Xiaolong to approach him, Lu Ding couldn’t help but retreat subconsciously. Slamming into the gate behind him, he finally realized the fear he had of Huang Xiaolong.

He wouldn’t be afraid even when going against late-First Heaven True Saints, but he was truly terrified when facing a First Tribulation half-True Saint right now.

Anyone would be afraid of someone who could suppress them even though they were one entire great realm weaker.

“Lu Ding, I have already accepted the inheritance of the Four Seas Holy Emperor. Right now, I can control the source energy of your Four Seas Holy Gate and use the full strength of the Holy Gate. I’ll give you one last chance. If you kneel and submit to me, I will spare your life.” Huang Xiaolong held the Four Seas Holy Symbol in his face and continued. “Otherwise, I shall declare you as a traitor and sentence you to death!”

Death!

Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent filled the hall in an instant.

Lu Ding’s heart shook and fear flashed through his eyes.

He knew that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t joking, and he knew the meaning behind the inheritance. It was true that Huang Xiaolong would be able to activate the complete strength of the Four Seas Holy Grounds to destroy him. With his holy soul and the might of the entire Four Seas Holy Grounds, a Second Heaven True Saint would have to leave their life behind if they came over to threaten the kid.

As Lu Ding was struggling to accept the fact, Yu Fujiang screamed, “Lu Ding, ignore the kid! You had left the Holy Gate for only several years. How can someone accept the inheritance in such a short period of time? He has to be lying!”

“If you work with me, we can kill the kid! Even with his holy soul, his fleshy body won’t be able to withstand the continuous attack of True Saint Realm experts! After we kill him, you can take the Four Seas Holy Symbol and accept the inheritance left behind by your master!”

“With the inheritance, you’ll be able to enter the Second Heaven True Saint Realm!”

Lu Ding snapped back to reality after he heard what Yu Fujiang said. Even someone like him would take a hundred or more years to accept the inheritance! He had only left the Holy Gate for a mere ten years, and it was impossible for anyone to accept the inheritance in such a short amount of time! The brat had to be lying!
