Chapter 369: Cancel Your Tryout Eligibility!

Hearing Zhao Shu say that he and Zhao Yi were from different branches of the Zhao Clan, Huang Xiaolong nodded, asking, “Do you know what Zhao Yi’s strength is like?”

Zhao Shu shook his head, “It has been close to a thousand years since this subordinate last saw Zhao Yi, thus I have no idea. But, Zhao Yi’s talent is very high, his martial spirit is a Nine-headed Hydra. In our Peace Emperor World, he was known as one of the dazzling geniuses.”

“A Nine-headed Hydra!” Both Huang Xiaolong and Zhang Fu were astounded.

Nine-headed Hydra, the legendary mythical animal of the underworld, ranked top amongst grade fourteen martial spirits! Rumour has it, people that had Nine-headed Hydra would possess an unfathomable power.

“Yes, a Nine-headed Hydra!” Zhao Shu affirmed with a dignified expression: “All those years ago, Zhao Yi broke into the Xiantian realm within ten years and stepped into the Saint realm in less than thirty years. If he hasn’t broken through to God Realm by now, he probably isn’t far from it!”

Breaking into Saint realm after merely thirty years of cultivation! Huang Xiaolong’s face became somber. ‘This Zhao Yi is actually so terrifying.’

Although Huang Xiaolong cultivated for no more than twenty odd years, he was different. These years, he had many fortuitous adventures. If it weren’t for of the Godly Mt. Xumi, it would have been impossible for Huang Xiaolong to break through to Xiantian Tenth Order. Without those Ghost King Dans, Huang Xiaolong could hardly touch the edge of the Saint realm.

Nevertheless, it mattered not if that Zhao Yi was interfering in Asura’s Gate matters, he was making this trip to Starcloud Continent! Determination shone in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

This time, he absolutely had to win back the Asura’s Gate Sovereign position and have the entire sect under his sole authority!

A few days later, Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu passed the Luo Tong Kingdom’s border. From there, the three flew straight to the Luo Tong Royal City, arriving a few hours later. Luo Tong Royal City was as busy as it always had been, prosperous and busy, with people shuttling along the streets.

Strolling along the streets of Luo Tong Royal City, Huang Xiaolong sighed inwardly watching the commoners going about their days. The city was the same, but the familiar face was no more.

Subconsciously, Huang Xiaolong’s feet brought him to the Delicious Restaurant. After the building was destroyed in the battle between Huang Xiaolong and Ao Baixue, the Delicious Restaurant was rebuilt, the signboard still looked new.

The fragrance of Snow Moon Wine wafted out from the premise. Huang Xiaolong knew, his good brother Lu Kai loved this Delicious Restaurant’s Snow Wind Wine the most.

The last time he was here, saving Lu Kai from the punishment square, then having a drink with Lu Kai here, those scenes were still fresh in his mind.

Lifting a foot, Huang Xiaolong walked in. Since he was already here in Luo Tong Royal City, he was in no hurry to act.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group of three walked into the premise, they ran into the restaurant’s boss. Seeing Huang Xiaolong, the restaurant boss’ face paled considerably: “Huang, Young Noble Huang!” Quickly ushering Huang Xiaolong up to the first floor, whispering in a barely audible voice, “Young Noble Huang, the current Luo Tong Kingdom has issued an arrest order with heavy rewards for your capture. I heard the Luo Tong Palace is filled with Deities Templar’s experts, all lying in wait for you!”

Huang Xiaolong exchanged a look with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, and then turned back toward the restaurant boss with a faint smile, “Heavy rewards for my capture? I wonder, how much is my head worth?”

The restaurant boss said, “Anyone who saw you, as long as they informed the palace, they could get one hundred million gold coins, ten thousand Grade Five Spirit Dan, and be appointed an official position!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “I worth so little?”

The restaurant boss became more anxious watching Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalance, still in the mood to laugh, “Young Noble Huang, in this little one’s opinion, Young Noble should quickly leave Luo Tong Kingdom. Although you are very strong, this time, Deities Templar...”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, interrupting the restaurant boss, “How much Snow Moon Wine is left? Go bring everything to me, also, prepare a table of good dishes.” Saying this, Huang Xiaolong turned around and walked to a corner table with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu.

The restaurant boss shook his head, sighing at Huang Xiaolong’s response. He could only go prepare Huang Xiaolong’s order.

After taking a seat, Huang Xiaolong took a look around. Today, the restaurant’s first floor was a little empty, merely three to four tables were taken, with only about a dozen or so customers.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong overheard the discussion going on at one of the tables.

“I heard the palace is selecting guards, opening registration today, as long as you’re a Houtian Eighth Order and above, you’re qualified. How about we go and try together?”

“Forget it, although a palace guard’s benefits are good, I still want to live a few more years. Who knows when that Young Noble Divine Dragon will return, don’t mention Houtian Eighth Order, even if you’re Xiantian Eighth Order, it’s nothing in front of Young Noble Divine Dragon!”

“Speaking about that, Prince Lu Kai died miserably, he was hung at the Royal City gates under the scorching sun for three days and three nights, then beaten to a pulp by those people, splashed with salt water, bones broken and tendons dug out. Only after half a month of torture did he breathe his last breath!”

“Prince Lu Kai indeed died wrongfully, but those Deities Templar people are too vicious. Even if they wanted to lure Young Noble Divine Dragon out, it wasn’t necessary to do what they did!”

Both men shook their heads.

The gaze in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes became frigid, a monstrous momentum of slaughter aura burst out from his body, taking the shape of a hell skull, hovering around him, giving a bone-chilling feeling.

Beaten, splashed with salt water!

Bones broken, tendons dug out! Hung at the city gates under the scorching sun for three days and three nights!

The killing intent in Huang Xiaolong’s heart erupted with brutal violence. He could imagine the inhumane pain Lu Kai had to endure being tortured by those Deities Templar scum before dying.

Deep remorse filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart, if he brought Lu Kai to Duanren Imperial City at that time, he wouldn’t fall to such end.

He himself was to be blamed! Warm tears pooled at the edges of Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Sensing the terrifying murderous intent surging out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, everyone on the first floor was startled, turning their heads towards the source.

“He... looks like Young Noble Divine Dragon?!”

“Seems like it’s him, a few years ago, he rescued Prince Lu Kai from the punishment square, I caught a glimpse of him from afar!”

Two people among the customers were astonished when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s face.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong turned around, a purple character ‘soul’ emerged in both his pupils for an instant. A powerful spiritual force enveloped the entire first floor, ‘soul’ characters flew out one after another, entering the consciousness of everyone present between their brows.

After Huang Xiaolong broke through to Saint realm, his spiritual force had reached another degree altogether, both the Ancient Puppetry Art and Soul Mandate advanced to the fifth stage. Displaying both together, not only he could take control over others, he could now remove certain parts of a person’s memories.

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu knew that Huang Xiaolong was erasing the memories of the people around, but even so, witnessing it with their own eyes still amazed them. Erasing a person’s memories, this was an ability possessed by the ancient masters! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Something even a peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm couldn’t do, but their Sovereign could.

In just seconds, Huang Xiaolong erased the memories of himself from the minds of the other customers on the first floor.

Right at this moment, the restaurant’s boss brought the wine and dishes up to Huang Xiaolong’s table.

Finding out that Lu Kai suffered so much in the hands of Deities Templar, Huang Xiaolong lost the mood to drink, but he kept all the Snow Moon Wine into the Asura Ring, paid for the food and wine, and left the restaurant with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, heading straight to the Luo Tong Palace.

It didn’t take the three of them long to reach the palace.

In the large square in front of the Luo Tong Palace, a palace guard selection was taking place. A lot of Luo Tong Kingdom’s experts came to try their luck.

“Quite lively.” Huang Xiaolong scanned the square, the sarcasm in his voice unmistakable. He continued to walk straight to the palace’s main doors.

“Stop there!” At this time, a palace guard saw them, barking out loud: “Are your dog eyes blind? Where do you think you’re going? The palace guard selection is over there, go and line up, if not, cancel your tryout eligibility!”
