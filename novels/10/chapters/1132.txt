The beast’s head was the size of a small mountain, its blood-red eyes resembling two big lakes. Its appearance caused a savage, primitive aura to descend on the Barbarian God Sect mountain range.

Just this beast’s aura actually slowed down Ju Wufei’s attack. All around, terrified eyes stared at the enormous beast head stretching out from the void behind Huang Xiaolong.

“This is an ancient Cloud Devouring Divine Beast?!” One of the Giant Tribe’s Eminent Grand Elders trembled, screaming in fear as if he had just seen a ghost.

An ancient Cloud Devouring Divine Beast! Gasps resounded all around.

Apprehension gripped Ju Wufei’s heart. From the pressure exuded by this Cloud Devouring Divine Beast he estimated that its strength had at least reached Fourth Order Ancient God Realm!

No, not Fourth Order! If it was merely a Fourth Order Ancient God Realm beast, it was impossible to force his attack to slow down relying purely on the pressure of its cultivation. Most likely, this Cloud Devouring Divine Beast was...!

Ju Wufei dared not let his thoughts travel further down this path.

He then looked at Huang Xiaolong. Had this late-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm Cloud Devouring Divine Beast also been invited by Huang Xiaolong? How was that even possible?! How was he capable of inviting a late-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm Cloud Devouring Divine Beast to help?

Another thing was, how did Huang Xiaolong come across an ancient divine beast? A divine beast like the one before them had never appeared in millions of years.

While Ju Wufei and others present were feeling apprehension, awe, and suspicion, the giant Cloud Devouring Divine Beast extended a leg from the void and lightly lowered its paw. Just this simple action immediately extinguished Ju Wufei’s palm attack, akin to pouring water over tiny flames.

The Cloud Devouring Divine Beast continued to lower its paw that was right above Ju Wufei.

Space cracked, causing fissures to spread like a spiderweb.

Ju Wufei was horrified as he looked at the enormous beast paw falling on him. The pressure was equivalent to a hundred mountains slamming onto his back.

Ju Wufei roared all of a sudden, circulating his godforce to the limit before punching upward at the beast paw.

At the same time, a metallic light enshrouded Ju Wufei as his hair fluttered in the air. The Devilish Heavenly Snake Sword appeared in his hand, slashing at the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast’s head.

Countless rays of sword qi shot forward, turning into a swarm of heavenly snakes, their sharp fangs aimed at the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast’s eyes.

However, Ju Wufei’s resistance was futile. His powerful punch did nothing to stop the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast’s paw, and the pressure falling on him multiplied instead. The rays of sword qi were shattered by a burst of sharp light from the beast’s eyes.

Watching both of his attacks fail, the terror in Ju Wufei’s eyes intensified, and it was already too late for him to dodge. His surroundings darkened as he was struck by the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast’s paw in the next second; like a meteorite, his body smashed heavily into the earth.

When Ju Wufei’s body hit the ground, causing a booming explosion to echo and the mountain to quake violently.

Everyone’s hearts jumped watching this scene.

The Giant Tribe Patriarch, a late-Third Order Ancient God Realm master that was close to reaching peak late-Third Order, a person with a resounding reputation that lasted for several thousand years was actually struck to the ground with one strike, just like that?

“Patriarch!”

The several Giant Tribe Eminent Grand Elders shouted anxiously and couldn’t be bothered with attacking Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du as they hurried to Ju Wufei’ side, helping him up from the ground. One of them sent a handful of divine pellets into Ju Wufei’s mouth

Huang Xiaolong merely watched, not preventing these people from healing Ju Wufei.

At this time, the early Fifth Order Ancient God Realm Cloud Devouring Divine Beast had completely emerged from the void, standing firm behind Huang Xiaolong like a hundred zhang tall mountain.

Bing Jiuyi, as the Green Ice Hail Devil Ancestor was almost ten zhang tall but beside the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast was akin to an anthill next to a hill.

Eyes widened in horror as they stared unblinkingly at the behemoth standing behind Huang Xiaolong.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were both apprehensive and amazed, but above all, they were ecstatic. At this time, Chen Hao’s eyes were filled with death and despair, looking bloodlessly pale as his heart beat erratically.

A short while later, after swallowing a handful of divine pellets, Ju Wufei’s injuries slightly stabilized. He then slowly stood up.

“Senior Cloud Devouring Divine Beast, this one is the Giant Tribe Patriarch Ju Wufei. May I inquire what conditions Huang Xiaolong promised that Senior is willing to help him? We’re willing to double it!” Ju Wufei cautiously and respectfully inquired from the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast.

In his opinion, since this beast had been invited by Huang Xiaolong, as long as he could come up with the appropriate terms, he would not be refused.

Pff! Yao Chi couldn’t help laughing hearing Ju Wufei’s words, just like a blooming flower.

Her laughter attracted everyone’s attention, including Ju Wufei’s fierce glare. Inwardly, he decided that once Senior Cloud Devouring Divine Beast agreed with his terms, he was going to play this woman to death.

The Cloud Devouring Divine Beast turned to Huang Xiaolong saying, “Master, this man wants me to rebel against you? What should I do?” Its tone was filled with provocation toward Ju Wufei.

Master?!

The way that Cloud Devouring Divine Beast addressed Huang Xiaolong stupefied everyone.

When Ju Wufei and the others regained their senses, the incredulous expressions on their faces were a sight to behold. ‘Could it be this Cloud Devouring Divine Beast wasn’t invited by Huang Xiaolong?!’

Otherwise, how could it be here?

Ju Wufei’s gaze fell onto Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du... ’These people were also not invited by Huang Xiaolong?’

The Giant Tribe’s side felt they were losing their minds.

A mere Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm punk was the master of a bunch of Ancient God Realm old monsters?!

Huang Xiaolong smiled at Ju Wufei, “Ju Wufei, what kind of terms are you offering to have Senior Cloud Devouring Divine Beast attack me? Let me hear you out, if the terms are really good, maybe I’d be tempted enough to have Tun Zhicao attack me.”

Tun Zhicao was this Cloud Devouring Divine Beast’s name when it was still alive.

Ju Wufei’s expression was as ugly as it could be, how could he not hear the ridicule in Huang Xiaolong’ voice. At this time, he finally realized why Yao Chi laughed when he offered to double the price.

“Go!” Ju Wufei bellowed, his body turned into a streak of sword light as if he and the Devilish Heavenly Snake Sword were a single body, speeding away from the Barbarian God Sect. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Giant Tribe Eminent Grand Elders also followed, turning into streaks of sword light, accelerating quickly.

However, before they could get too far, an enormous beast head blocked their path, causing an even more powerful pressure to lock onto them.

Two giant beast paws swept over Ju Wufei’s group, sending them back toward the Barbarian God Sect.

Another Cloud Devouring Divine Beast emerged from the void, but more importantly, this second one was even stronger than the first. Seeing this, Chen Hao lost his self-control and wet himself.

A large number of the Sky Dragon League members’ pants were wet while An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and other Grand Elders and Elders felt their knees go weak.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling looked at the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beast at Huang Xiaolong’s side, as well as Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du, their minds completely blank. The sky seemed bluer than usual, the clouds floating merrily... Were they daydreaming?
