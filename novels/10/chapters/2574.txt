Chapter 2575: Alien Lands

Huang Xiaolong looked around, the ancient battlefield that was filled with yin winds and blood corpse qi, and it gave him an inexplicable sense of intimacy.

Huu~!

Huang Xiaolong exhaled. The clouds in the far distance roiled from a sudden gust of strong wind.

His strength had risen further after obtaining the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance and advancing to Second Heaven True Saint Realm.

‘My current strength should be enough to protect myself when dealing with Primal Ancestors!’ The thought flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

He inwardly compared his current strength with the Suoluo Race’s Eminent Elder Jiang Long. Even in the circumstance, he didn’t use any dao artifacts, he had the confidence to suppress Jiang Long.

Following that conclusion, when he advanced to Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm, he would be able to suppress First Resurrection Primal Ancestors.

The mere thought of a Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm suppressing First Resurrection Primal Ancestors was simply ridiculous in the common eyes. If Huang Xiaolong dared to utter such words outside, he would definitely be treated as a fool, but Huang Xiaolong had such confidence.

“It’s time to head to the Alien Lands.” Huang Xiaolong said as he looked towards the Corpse River’s other side bank. The Alien Lands were over that side.

“Go!”

Without further delay, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo sped across the sky towards the other side of the Corpse River. A moment later, the two were in the air above the Corpse River. After a brief stop, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo flew over the Corpse River, and both continued flying onwards after arriving on the other side.

Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo rarely stopped to rest. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo proceeded onwards in the same manner they had first entered the ancient battlefield—undead spirits and nethersouls below Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm they encountered were devoured by Hei Luo, whereas those Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm and above were subjugated by Huang Xiaolong.

Several months later, by the time Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the other side of the ancient battlefield, he had truly arrived at the Alien Lands. Now, Huang Xiaolong had exactly ten Ninth Heaven True Saint undead spirits!

Adding four nethersouls, it was a total of ‘new’ fourteen Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm underlings.

Not forgetting Hei Luo and Huang Xiaolong himself, Huang Xiaolong had enough manpower to oppose a royal family like the Suoluo Race.

As they stepped onto the Alien Lands and felt the spiritual energy that was the same as the Holy World, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo flew onwards. As for the ten undead spirits and four nethersouls, Huang Xiaolong had thrown them into the Cangqiong Dao Palace long back, letting them cultivate through the Cangqiong Dao Palace’s primal ancestor array.

Humans were one of the races living on the Alien Lands. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to change his appearance or disguise his aura.

Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo flew towards the closest holy ground. Currently, he needed to determine which domain he was in.

The Alien Lands had tens of thousands of domains in various sizes, and each domain had more than a few holy grounds. In some of the bigger domains, there existed several thousand holy grounds, and in a few there were probably ten thousand.

Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo arrived at the closest holy ground after a day of travel.

This holy ground was not as prosperous as the Heavenly Master Holy Ground, and the holy spiritual qi around here was pitifully thin.

After some asking around, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo arrived at the biggest city, Yang City.

Yang City was not only the biggest city closest to them, but it was also one of the biggest cities in the entire holy ground.

But before Huang Xiaolong could step into the city, he was stopped by the alien race’s experts guarding the city gates and ordered to pay a fee! Ten holy coins!

The universal currency on the Holy World side was holy bills, but in the Alien Lands, transactions were conducted with holy coins, especially for commoners.

Holy spiritual jade stones were used and accepted by those with higher statuses, whether it was in the Holy World or Alien Lands.

Huang Xiaolong rummaged around and found the lowest grade and worst quality holy spiritual jade stone inside the Black Corpse Holy Ring to give to the alien race expert guard. Then again, even holy spiritual jade stone of the worst quality in the lowest grade, inside the Black Corpse Holy Ring, was more than enough to delight the captain guard that he couldn’t stop smiling.

Perhaps it was at the sake of the holy spiritual jade stone, but the captain guard’s attitude towards Huang Xiaolong was much more polite after that.

In the Alien Lands, it was the alien races’ territory, the alien races had a higher status than humans. Here, humans were largely servants to the alien races, or they were low-level guards.

Only a small number of True Saint Realm human experts fared better and were given a certain degree of respect.

Of course, there was a limit to how much respect they received.

Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo proceeded to enter the city.

The captain guard who accepted Huang Xiaolong’s holy spiritual jade stone watched Huang Xiaolong leave while caressing the holy spiritual jade stone in his hand, as greed flicker across his eyes as he mumbled, “Seems like he’s a fat sheep.”

“Captain, his strength is probably not low,” one of the guards spoke.

The captain guard chuckled meaningfully, “I know. Someone, who can take out a holy spiritual jade stone so easily, naturally has some strength. His strength is likely at high-level Heavenly Monarch. So what? In our Alien Lands, a high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm human is the same as a fart. If I can’t handle him, then isn’t there Lord Zhu to help me?”

Lord Zhu was also called as Deputy Commander Zhu Bi of Yang City’s Army Guards. He was the captain’s superior, and also a relative. Whenever the captain had something good, he would hand it over to Zhu Bi, hence his relationship with Zhu Bi was quite good.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo were leisurely strolling the streets after entering the city.

Although this Yang City was not as prosperous as the Holy Heavens City, there were still a lot of people around. Huang Xiaolong even spotted two half-True Saint Realm alien race experts, however, they were merely First Tribulation half-True Saints.

Although they were only half-True Saints, they were considered as top experts of high statuses in Yang City, and even this holy ground. This can be seen from the numerous servants and guards accompanying them.

Huang Xiaolong also saw several humans on the streets, but these people followed humbly behind alien races’ disciples, like minions as they fawned and flattered alien races’ disciples. He also saw several of these human minions being kicked and punched when alien races’ disciples got annoyed by their flatteries.

Originally, there was no human race in the Alien Lands, but during the war, many human race experts were captured and brought to the Alien Lands. Some were imprisoned, and others were subjugated as the alien race’s low-level guards.

As the years had passed, these human race experts’ offsprings had multiplied, giving birth to native human race on the Alien Lands. Here, the human race was labeled as inferior people, slaves, and other similar derogatory terms were used. There were alien races’ royal families, who specifically liked keeping human slaves, and they tortured and abused them to vent themselves out.

When Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo were passing by one of the shops, a human race expert was kicked out of the shop by an alien race disciple. That human race expert happened to roll towards Huang Xiaolong’s feet, with blood spurting from his mouth.

Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into furrows.

“Motherf*cker, who do you think you are! It’s your great fortune that I happen to like your blade, but you actually have the cheek to demand holy coins from me!” The alien race disciple walked out from the shop while cursing, glaring fiercely at the injured man. There were more than a dozen servants behind him.

From the alien race disciple’s attire, he was likely a direct descendent of a big family in the Yang City.

Although Huang Xiaolong didn’t know the details, he could guess more or less, judging from his curses.

“Punk, what’re you looking at?!” The alien race disciple was displeased after noticing Huang Xiaolong, a human, standing there looking at him in a silly manner. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong and barked, “Roll the f*ck off! Or I’ll dig out your eyes!”

“Remember, roll, not walk, if you dare to walk, I’ll break your legs, so that you’ll never walk again in your life!”
