Despite hearing that ten thousand points would be deducted if he failed to complete the task within the stipulated time, there were no changes to Huang Xiaolong’s expression.

“Tang Hong actually chose the Nefarious Devil Gold Core task! He’s really overestimating himself, who does he think he is, Senior Sister Hu Dan?” A core disciple who was there to pick a task stared at Huang Xiaolong’s back, mocking him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Who can say for certain? Didn’t that kid refine some grade three Hundred Scales of the Golden Dragon Divine Pills a few days ago? Maybe he will give everyone another great shock, running into some super dog shit luck and find a Nefarious Devil Gold Core!”

“I think he’s trying to attract Senior Sister Tian Juaner’s attention, otherwise why would he accept this task that cannot be completed in front of her?”

The several disciples laughed and snickered as they gossiped.

Some wanted to get into Tian Juaner’s favor while others were jealous because Huang Xiaolong refined grade three Divine Pills.

In short, no one believed that Huang Xiaolong was capable of completing the task.

“I want the Linglong Hallow Jade task.” Tian Juaner turned back to Li Yahong and instructed.

The Linglong Hallow Jade task also required the disciple to head to the sea region close to the Nefarious Devil Tribe, but the level of difficulty and risks was much lower compared to Huang Xiaolong’s task, something with only eight thousand points as reward.

“It’s done, Senior Sister Tian.” Li Yahong said with a courteous smile and proceeded to explain the requirements of the task in a subtle yet flattering manner.

Following this, Tian Juaner left the Grand Dragon Hall.

Although she chose to take the Linglong Hallow Jade task, due to the impending pill refining, she also pushed back her departure to one month later.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left the Grand Dragon Hall, Liu Qingyang received news that he took the Nefarious Devil Gold Core task.

Inside Liu Qingyang’s cultivation dwelling, Sun Jinqiang snickered maliciously, “That kid was struck silly in the head by an Earthworm Beast, he actually dared to take the Nefarious Devil Gold Core task!”

Contrary to Sun Jinqiang’s thoughts, Liu Qingyang contemplated the matter, “By taking that task, he’ll most likely set off after the Gate Chief finishes refining the Lightning War Monarch Pill. These past couple of days I’ve been thinking how to lure that kid out from the Golden Dragon Gate, but it seems like I don’t have to waste time thinking about that now.”

As Liu Qingyang said this, a sharp light flashed in his eyes as his killing intent leaked out for a moment.

Sun Jinqiang laughed happily, “Grandfather, when we capture that Tang Hong, I want to finish him off personally!”

Liu Qingyang dotingly consented, “Naturally.”

...

Time flowed, and in the blink of an eye over twenty days had passed.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong would routinely head to the library in the morning, while at night he would enter the Xumi Temple to refine the grade four spiritual vein after reinforcing what he comprehended during the day.

Silvery moonlight danced in the cold night air.

Huang Xiaolong was completely enshrouded in a bright light while sitting cross-legged above the spiritual vein. His persistent effort in recent days had pushed his cultivation to peak early Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm. Still, there were a few days to go until he could truly step into mid-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Having awakened from a night of cultivation, Huang Xiaolong exited the Xumi Temple.

Outside, the sun was shining brightly.

Standing in his yard, Huang Xiaolong deeply breathed in the Golden Dragon Mountain’s rich spiritual energy, which contained a weak dragon qi within.

He could feel this dragon qi flow out from the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple. From this, he concluded that the weak dragon qi originated dom the dragon pearl itself.

This finding increased Huang Xiaolong’s anticipation toward studying that Golden Dragon Pearl

Tomorrow was the day when the Golden Dragon Gate Chief wanted to refine the Lightning War Monarch Pill.

“Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus...” Huang Xiaolong whispered.

Tomorrow, in order to snatch away the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus, having the Green Ice Hail Devil Bing Jiuyi act alone would be enough. The plan was for Bing Jiuyi to instantly teleport away after snatching the lotus. This way, whatever suspicions may arise wouldn’t fall upon his head.

Thus Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried that his identity would be exposed.

When the matter of the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus was settled, it was time to set off to the Nefarious Devil Tribe territory. After completing the task, he’d be able to enter the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple and study the dragon pearl.

The truth was, Huang Xiaolong had another motive in selecting the Nefarious Devil Tribe task.

The Primordial Divine Dragon Clan’s divine dragons had a dragon pearl inside their bodies, and the Nefarious Devil Tribe members, as one of the primordial races, would also condense a small bead referred to as a gold core inside their bodies when they broke through to the Ancient God Realm.

This Nefarious Devil Gold Core slightly resembled a beast core, but within a gold core was the true essence of a Nefarious Devil Ancient God Realm master. Although it wasn’t as precious as a godhead, if a cultivator could get their hands on a gold core and refine the origin essence within, not only would it improve their cultivation, it could also strengthen the physical body and godhead at the same time.

Since tomorrow was the day of the pill refinement, Huang Xiaolong did not go to the library. Instead, he went down to the Golden Dragon City, casually walking around.

Taking the name of the sect, the Golden Dragon City was the most important city under the Sect’s governance, slightly bigger than the Barbarian God Sect’s Barbarian God City. Huang Xiaolong noticed that the spiritual veins sealed under the Golden Dragon City were of higher quality compared to the ones under Barbarian God City.

As one of the two hegemons of the Dralion Island, in terms of power and heritage, the Golden Dragon Gate left the Barbarian God Sect in the dust.

While Huang Xiaolong was strolling around the city, he passed by a restaurant that seemed to be a crowd favorite. Following his heart, Huang Xiaolong walked in and ordered some dishes and a flagon of their best wine.

However, when he was leaving the restaurant, he ran into Sun Jinqiang who was walking in with several core disciples.

The instant Sun Jinqiang saw Huang Xiaolong, fury, hatred, and killing intent erupted in his heart.

“Tang—Hong.” Sun Jinqiang spat the name through gritted teeth.

Huang Xiaolong coldly glanced at Sun Jinqiang and walked past him without a word.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s attitude, the killing intent and hatred in Sun Jinqiang expanded several times. His gloomy, icy voice sounded behind Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, just you wait, I’ll pulverize your d*ck into dust!”

Sun Jinqiang did not bother to control the volume of his voice, in fact, he said it for Huang Xiaolong to hear.

Huang Xiaolong snorted in response and left.

“Jinqiang, do you want me to help you cripple that punk?” One of the core disciples with Sun Jinqiang offered. This core disciple was a mid-Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator.

“No need.” Sun Jinqiang added, “Let him jump around for a few more days.”

Early morning the next day, the sky was clear, cloudless for a thousand li.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from Tang Hong’s place and headed toward the Golden Dragon Gate Chief’s cultivation dwelling.

This time, the pill refinement would be done inside the Gate Chief’s personal chamber.

Roughly two hours later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Gate Chief’s cultivation dwelling. After showing his identity token to the guarding attendants, he was led inside.

Walking into the front hall, Huang Xiaolong saw Tian Juaner and the other four already waiting. Other than them, more than a dozen Elders and Grand Elders with dual element godheads containing lightning and fire were present as well. Clearly, they were here to assist the Gate Chief in refining the pill. Counting Huang Xiaolong, and the Golden Dragon Gate Chief, a total of eighteen people were involved.

The Golden Dragon Gate Chief Liu Zhuo was sitting on the main seat. When Huang Xiaolong walked in, a golden light flashed in Liu Zhuo’s eyes as his gaze fell on him. It was as if all of Huang Xiaolong’s secrets were laid bare before him.
