Chapter 2668: Death Cave

Although Huang Xiaolong had the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and he was able to flee at incredible speed, it was a huge problem that they were within the dire region at the moment where there were countless dangerous restrictions. This hindered Huang Xiaolong’s speed while Yuan Qianxing’s group was pursuing relentlessly.

As they chased after Huang Xiaolong, Yuan Qianxing and the others attacked consecutively.

Yuan Qianxing and Yao Chengxin’s attacks were almost negligible, but Yuan Wanfei, Mo Jincheng, and Elder Ming’s attacks were at another level. Every time their attacks landed on the Cangqiong Dao Palace, inside the Cangqiong Palace, Huang Xiaolong’s blood flow churned violently. After all, these three were Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestors and above, and especially, Elder Ming’s attacks were especially lethal. Blood was flowing out from the corner of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth.

Despite the Cangqiong Palace and Cangqiong World’s amazing defenses, it could not fully disperse the power of Elder Ming’s attacks.

At this rate, Huang Xiaolong’s injuries would worsen in no time, and he would fall into these people’s hands.

Yuan Qianxing, if I survive this, the next time I see you it will be the day you all die!

Fury and killing intent boiled in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

An hour later, because of his worsening injuries, the Cangqiong Dao Palace’s speed began to slow down, and finally, Huang Xiaolong came before a great dark cave.

As he stood in front of the great dark cave, like a beast’s opened mouth ready to swallow him, Huang Xiaolong felt apprehensive. This might be the most dangerous place possible in the entire dire region, if he wasn’t mistaken, this was the Death Cave Mo Zhi had told him about!

It wasn’t a joke to say it was a hundred percent death once you entered the Death Cave! There were not one in a million chances of surviving!

Ninety percent of Primal Ancestors who had entered the Death Cave out of curiosity had never returned.

But it was already too late for Huang Xiaolong to turn back at this point. Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder and saw Yuan Qianxing’s group of five whistling through the wind, blocking Huang Xiaolong’s only path of return.

Yuan Wanfei looked at the huge dark cave behind Huang Xiaolong and chuckled sinisterly, “So, it’s the Death Cave! Hehe, Huang Xiaolong, you have nowhere to run anymore. It looks like even the heavens want you to die.”

Huang Xiaolong controlled the Changqiong Dao Palace, ramming straight at Yao Chengxin, but the instant the Cangqiong Dao Palace moved, his path was blocked by a huge dark palm print. Elder Ming!

Elder Ming’s huge palm print sent Huang Xiaolong reeling back, and then he spoke coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, if you submit to me, I can spare your life.”

“What?!” Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, Yao Chengxin, and Mo Jincheng couldn’t believe what they heard.

Even Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect Elder Ming would say that, but he sneered coldly in response. He could already guess what the other side wanted to say.

As expected, Elder Ming added, “Hand over the Cangqiong Blade, Cangqiong Dao Palace, and the other two dao artifacts to me.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, and didn't bother to hide his contempt. He didn’t reply to Elder Ming, but he sent his four dao artifacts, the Flying Heaven Spear, Cangqiong Blade, Cangqiong Dao Palace, and Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring to attack Yao Chengxin and Yuan Qianxing.

……

An hour later, Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, Yao Chengxin, Mo Jincheng, and Elder Ming’s faces grew increasingly unsightly.

As they watched, Huang Xiaolong and his four dao artifacts disappeared into the Death Cave’s darkness. Huang Xiaolong was swallowed by the cave’s darkness, gone from sight in an instant.

“F*ck!” Yuan Qianxing roughly rubbed off the blood stain from his mouth, hissing angrily.

Realizing it was hopeless in trying to escape, Huang Xiaolong had actually chosen to jump into the Death Cave!

Before jumping into the Death Cave, Huang Xiaolong had struck out with his Thousand Armed Holy Devil with full force, inflicting heavy injuries on Yuan Qianxing and Yao Chengxin. If it wasn’t for Elder Ming, Yuan Wanfei, and Mo Jincheng’s timely rescue, their injuries would have been worse.

Yuan Wanfei, Mo Jincheng, and Elder Ming didn’t have any good expression on their faces, watching Huang Xiaolong jump into the Death Cave.

“What a waste.” Standing in front of the Death Cave, Elder Ming lamented coldly as he watched Huang Xiaolong’s figure being swallowed by darkness.

One could only wonder whether he thought it was a waste of Huang Xiaolong’s talent or the four dao artifacts.

“Huang Xiaolong really won’t be able to walk out from this Death Cave alive, right?” Mo Jincheng asked worriedly.

Yuan Wanfei laughed, “Even if Cangqiong Old Man goes in, he’s bound to die inside. No one has ever walked out alive from the Death Cave, unless Huang Xiaolong is an existence transcending Primal Ancestor!”

“From now on, there is no more Huang Xiaolong!” Yao Chengxin stated, and he was inwardly relieved. Had Huang Xiaolong been allowed to grow stronger, the ones dead would surely be them instead of him. This was the ideal result for them. Huang Xiaolong was dead, finally.

Although it was slightly different from what they had expected, it wasn’t in vain since they had succeeded in killing Huang Xiaolong. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s go.”

They stood in front of the Death Cave for a while, until Elder Ming could no longer sense Huang Xiaolong’s aura. As he confirmed to the others, they returned the way they came.

His original plan was to lure Huang Xiaolong into another perilous location in the dire region, and then destroy his physical body by borrowing the restriction’s power over there. Following that he had planned to capture Huang Xiaolong’s holy soul, and Inextinguishable Dao Hear, and then collect the Cangqiong Blade. But Huang Xiaolong’s combat power had exceeded their estimation, thus had they failed to manipulate Huang Xiaolong to the location they had set.

Yuan Qianxing took another glance at the Death Cave before speeding away with Yuan Wanfei and the others.

After the group left, the Death Cave remained the same, death qi and darkness energy roiled.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong felt an overpowering force pulling him towards the depths of the cave the moment he jumped in.

The further down he fell, the death qi around became more terrifying. In the end, this terrifying death qi was so thick that it condensed into many tiny death worms. These death worms gave Huang Xiaolong the creeps as if death was hovering around him.

He felt a greater danger from these death worms than from that black-robed Elder Ming!

Fortunately, Huang Xiaolong still had the Cangqiong Dao Palace!

When these death worms landed on the Cangqiong World’s barrier, the Cangqiong World’s barrier started corroding at a rapid speed!

Soon, these death worms were chipping the Cangqiong Dao Palace itself bite by bite, and these low chomping noises reached the inside of the Cangqiong Dao Palace. Under these death worms’ persistent effort, the Cangqiong Dao Palace’s speed slowed further!

A chilling feeling spread through Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

If these death worms got inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace, probably his own body would be eaten clean in a few seconds. Without his physical body, his holy souls and Inextinguishable Dao Heart were more vulnerable in this Death Cave, and he surely would be a dead man!

Not to mention, his holy souls would probably be gnawed by these death worms as well.

Although his three holy souls were amazing, and there were very few things that could threaten them, these death worms were definitely one of those things!

These death worms’ death qi was a million times more terrifying than Hei Luo’s death qi, maybe more!

Hei Luo?

An idea came to him. Perhaps, Hei Luo would be able to swallow these death worms?

Huang Xiaolong quickly put Hei Luo out, but he soon noticed, Hei Luo was actually afraid of these death worms.

As these death worms chomped away, finally the Cangqiong Dao Palace could not operate anymore. In the blink of an eye, death worms swarmed over the Cangqiong Dao Palace from all directions, submerging Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart bottomed.

Am I going to die here?

Huang Xiaolong’s hands tightened around the Flying Heaven Spear and Cangqiong Blade, he attacked the death worms but to his dismay, attacks were useless on these death worms… When his attacks landed on these death worms, they turned into scattering death qi, then condensed again into death worms!

Looking around him, everywhere was blocked by dense death worms, cutting off all his chances of survival. In these last moments of his life, the thought that crossed his mind was his family on Earth.
