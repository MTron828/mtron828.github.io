Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of relief as he looked at the calm Blue Spectre Spring river bubbling calmly inside his Ghost Buddha Ring. He retrieved the Yellow Springs Magic Robe into the Ghost Buddha Ring, and let it soak within the blue river water.

As soon as the Yellow Springs Magic Robe entered the Blue Spectre Spring river, Huang Xiaolong could immediately feel the Yellow Springs Magic Robe cheering with vitality.

That’s right, cheering with vitality!

The magic symbols on the magic robe glimmered spiritedly, whereas the ax-wielding archdevil diagram exuded a devilish red light with brutal and violent aura.

Huang Xiaolong was feeling extremely cheerful after acquiring the Blue Spectre Spring river.

Since the Blue Spectre Spring river was now repairing the Yellow Springs Magic Robe, it would become more powerful in the days to come.

“The Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruit are just up ahead in that direction.” The little cow said as she pointed her hoof in front of her.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. Shortly, everyone continued flying onwards.

Half an hour later, they arrived at a stone valley.

Surveying from high up in the air, Huang Xiaolong’s group could see colorful halos from the spiritual herbs and flowers in the valley below. Towering ancient trees loomed over from the high edges of the valley walls, that were laden with aromatic spiritual fruits.

“That’s the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass!”

“Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits!”

"Heavens, there’s so many Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits! There’s enough to refine several hundred batches of Brilliant Black Soul Divine Pills!”

“Having several hundred batches of these Brilliant Black Soul Divine Pills will enable your soul to achieve a state of perfection!”

Huang Xiaolong’s face split into a wide grin at the little cow’s words. He too was feeling quite happy.

On the ground of the valley, there were clusters of grass enshrouded in a faint greenish halo. These clusters of grass resembled the blooming petals of a flower. This was the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass, and it looked adorable and charming. There were more than two hundred clusters. On the other hand, the Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits were in a haze of purple halos. The Soul Fruits were about the same in quantity as the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass, if not more.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was preparing to collect them, whistling winds sounded from the distance, as a group of people flew towards them at high speed. The sound of the whistling winds caught Huang Xiaolong’s attention and he turned to look in the distance. He was a little surprised when he saw the Blue Spirit Gate’s group, whom he had encountered at the ghost cave’s entrance.

A faint frown creased Huang Xiaolong’s smooth forehead. ‘Have they also come here for harvesting the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits?’

If that was the case, then, conflict was inevitable.

Huang Xiaolong signaled Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and others to prepare for battle.

Moments later, the Blue Spirit Gate’s group arrived above the same valley.

Naturally, they also spotted the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits. Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestor Zhang Yunbo, Ancestor Jiang Dongyang, and others couldn’t hide the joy from their faces.

“There are lots of Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits in the valley below!”

“Ha ha ha, these Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits are all ours!!”

One of the Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestors exclaimed with an exuberant laugh.

Huang Xiaolong sneered as he listened to him.

One of the Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestors rushed down towards the valley to collect the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass, as if Huang Xiaolong’s group didn’t even exist.

However, a shadow flickered out of nowhere to block his path, before he could reach the valley. In the next second, a surging palm force flooded forward from a slender palm as ghost fog roiled towards him. The Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestor was taken aback, but he dodged it with a quick reflex, and at the same time, his palm struck forward to meet the attack.

Booming blasts thundered in the air, and the shockwaves from the collision shook the valley below.

The Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestor was repelled back.

“YOU–!!” He looked at Feng Er angrily, and demanded, “What’s the meaning of this?!”

Feng Er was cold and indifferent as she said, “Meaning?!” She looked at the Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestor as if she was looking at an idiot, “Are you an idiot? If you really don’t know, I can tell you!”

Idiot!

A red blush of shame rose the Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestor. Just as he was about to retaliate, Zhang Yunbo’s arm reached out and stopped him. Zhang Yunbo looked at Huang Xiaolong, and then at Feng Er. He then said, “Little brother, Blue Spirit Gate needs these Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits. Therefore, Blue Spirit Gate wants to take all these herbs. Little brother has already collected more than a few precious herbal ingredients, right?”

Huang Xiaolong spoke calmly, “In other words, are you trying to say that you’re already being magnanimous for not ordering us to handout those spiritual herbs, is that it?”

Zhang Yunbo nodded matter-of-factly and said, “That’s right. If you leave without taking the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits, I won’t force you to handover the Water Magic Fruits and other spiritual herbs!”

“Ancestor, you cannot let them leave so easily!” The Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elder who had argued with Huang Xiaolong at the ghost cave’s entrance jumped out anxiously. He stressed, “Those spiritual herbs should belong to the Blue Spirit Gate. They must hand over all of their spiritual herbs!”

“Yes, all of them must hand over their spatial rings!”

“They must also leave their divine armors here!”

Other Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elders followed and clamored vehemently. They all agreed that Huang Xiaolong’s group needed to handout their spatial rings! And not just that, Huang Xiaolong was even expected to leave behind his prior possessions before coming to the ghost cave including all divine pills, spiritual herbs, and divine artifacts.

They even wanted their divine armors!

This meant that Huang Xiaolong’s group could only leave when there was not even a thread left on their bodies.

The Blue Spirit Gate’s experts could see that the divine armors worn by Huang Xiaolong’s group’s members were all of the finest quality.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, as he found this situation a little helpless as well as hilarious. He said directly to Zhang Yunbo, “How about a counteroffer? Before I change my mind, all of you better hand over your divine armors and spatial rings, then leave.”

Zhang Yunbo, Jiang Dongyang, and the rest of Blue Spirit Gate’s experts were astounded by Huang Xiaolong’s words for a second, then all of them burst out roaring laughter.

“Kiddo, you do have a lot of people on your side, but more people doesn’t mean more power. There are four great peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters on our side, while there is only one on yours!” Jiang Dongyang snickered mockingly, “Just the four of us are enough to annihilate all of you!”

But Jiang Dongyang’s words were cut off by an overwhelming coercion from the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s body. Space became distorted from the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s momentum, and the spiritual herbal fragrance floating above the valley was swept away.

The Blue Spirit Gate’s group started suffocating from the pressure exerted by the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s overwhelming coercion. Their eyes widened in horror.

“G-G, God King Realm master!” The Blue Spirit Gate’s Ancestor who had rushed down to collect the Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass shrieked. His teeth were chattering from fear and astonishment.

That mundane looking magic beast at the black-haired young man’s side was actually a God King Realm master!

On top of that, this magic beast didn’t look like it had broken through to First Order God King Realm recently!

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze fell on Zhang Yunbo’s group, and his tone was just as cold when he said, “You’re right, your side has four peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters, but we have one Second Order God King Realm master here!”

Second Order God King Realm master!

The revelation was like a thunderclap in the ears of the Blue Spirit Gate’s group members. Despair clouded their faces as they thought inwardly—Second Order God King Realm! Zhang Yunbo believed that with the four of them, they could have had a chance to escape if it would have been a peak late-First Order God King Realm master. But now, there was no such thing!

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze shifted to one of the Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elder. He was the one who had first mentioned about taking Huang Xiaolong’s divine armor. And he was also the one who had questioned Huang Xiaolong’s identity at the entrance of the ghost cave.

The Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elder’s legs gave out when he saw Huang Xiaolong looking at him. He tried to speak, but he could only make intelligible gurgling sounds.

Void devil beat Xu Baisheng tapped his finger in the air. In the next second, this Blue Spirit Gate’s Grand Elder’s body was corroded away, leaving behind only his white bones!FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
