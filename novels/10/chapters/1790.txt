As the chaos lightning grew stronger and stronger, everyone practically stopped breathing under the anticipation. None of them dared to blink for fear of missing the amazing show before them.

As for Di Jun, who was seated on the Nine Dragon Throne, a frown appeared on his face. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and Bei Xiaomei, who were about to go on a rampage, stopped, and they stared at the ball of chaos lighting in the sky.

The lightning started to dissipate under everyone’s gaze slowly, and it seemed as though something was sucking it dry.

Han Qing and Zhao Tong looked at each other, and a feeling of unease filled their hearts.

As time slowly passed, the ball of lightning in the air shrunk. As it became thinner and thinner, the speed at which it was being absorbed sped up considerably.

Eventually, a blurry figure appeared before everyone’s eyes.

This...

Huang Xiaolong?!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t die!!!

He devoured the chaos lightning in an instant, and not even the slightest bit of waste could be seen. The endless reservoir of chaos lightning charged into the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows and entered his body!

“This! This isn’t possible!” Han Qing screamed.

Even as an Eighth Order Emperor Realm expert, she wouldn’t be able to swallow all the chaos divine lightning, as Huang Xiaolong did. He was a mere Heavenly Monarch. How in the world was he able to do something like that?!

Also, the Massacre Emperor Bead had failed to kill Huang Xiaolong!

Heavenly Emperor Di Jun looked at the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows, and he seemed to have thought of something. Several other experts from the other superpowers felt a terrifying thought flash through their minds as well.

“Nine Chaos Lightning Pool!” Yan Tianchen, who was standing beside Di Jun, gasped in shock. A solemn expression formed on his face.

“I never thought that this brat would be able to fuse with the Nine Chaos Lightning Pool...” Xiao Yi, who was standing on the other side of Di Jun exclaimed in surprise as well. A complicated look flashed through his eyes.

He had never heard of anyone subduing the Nine Chaos Lightning Pool in his entire life.

In fact, such a mythical object couldn’t be subdued by anyone. There were two other chaos lightning pools in the Heavenly Court. Despite his best efforts, even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor himself could not subdue both of them, let alone Di Jun. Not even the number one genius of the Heavenly Court, Di Jing, was able to mess about with them.

Yet Huang Xiaolong had managed to do it right before their very eyes!

Everyone was stunned silly as a complicated light flashed through their eyes. When Huang Xiaolong crawled out from the mess he had made, he walked towards the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s direction.

Han Qing and Zhao Tong felt their expressions change.

Zhao Tong felt incredibly nervous as his legs went soft. His pants even turned a little moist as he was no longer able to control his fear.

“Ancestor, you have to save me!” Zhao Tong screamed and begged for help from Zhang Renjie and Han Qing.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you think you’re doing?” A vicious light flashed through Han Qing’s eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

When Zhang Renjie and the others saw that Huang Xiaolong was approaching them with bad intentions, they had no choice but to stand their ground. After all, Zhao Tong was a disciple of the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

Yu Shi also stepped forward, and he pointed the sword in his hand at Huang Xiaolong’s head. “Huang Xiaolong, this is the Terrace of Heaven! Our rules govern our Heavenly Court, and it’s not somewhere you can run amok! Leave!”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Yu Shi before ignoring him completely. Before anyone could react, one of the monsters behind Huang Xiaolong flicked out with a single finger, and Yu Shi’s miserable shrieks filled the air. He shot backward at incredible speed.

Everyone felt a bomb going off in their minds.

“Audacious!”

“Insolent!”

All the marshals and grand marshals of the Heavenly Court roared in unison.

Yu Shi was a marshal of the Heavenly Court! However, Huang Xiaolong had shown him no mercy in front of everyone; not even a trace of mercy.

It was clear that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t showing the slightest bit of respect to the Heavenly Court!

According to Yan Tianchen and the rest, Huang Xiaolong had already made a grave mistake by not kneeling to greet the Heavenly Emperor. Right now, his crimes were enough for them to call for his immediate execution!

Right before Yan Tianchen and Xiao Yi were about to make a move, Di Jun raised his arm to stop them. He spoke with indifference, “The Grandmist Emperor Palace violated the rules. According to the Battle of the Heavenly Court rules, we shall cancel their qualifications to participate. Huang Xiaolong is the victor!”

“Zhao Lei, do you have any opinions about the matter?”

The Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Zhao Tong kneeled on the ground and groveled, “This subordinate accepts the order.”

He naturally had no complaints. After all, staying alive was the most important thing.

Di Jun turned his gaze towards Huang Xiaolong and said. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you think?”

Everyone’s eyes landed on Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Everyone felt that Heavenly Emperor Di Jun had already shown Huang Xiaolong enough respect by asking him about his opinion even though Huang Xiaolong had sent a marshal of the Heavenly Court flying right before his eyes.

Yet, Huang Xiaolong looked at Di Jun and responded. “I accept the outcome of the battle.” In the next instant, his tone changed. “Even so, I’m still going to kill Zhao Tong.”

Even though it seemed like Di Jun was showing Huang Xiaolong respect by asking for his opinion, he was biased towards the Grandmist Emperor Palace by allowing Zhao Tong to live.

Victory? With Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he would win even if he fought with his backside. It was also the reason Huang Xiaolong felt no need to contest Di Jun’s decision. However, accepting Di Jun’s decision didn’t mean that he couldn’t have one of his own. He was going to kill Zhao Tong, whether they liked it or not.

Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong, and their jaws nearly dropped to the ground.

A frosty light flashed through Di Jun’s eyes.

As the Heavenly Emperor, his words were law! How dare Huang Xiaolong go against his will?!

In the Divine World, the number of people that could go against his words could be counted on one hand. As for Huang Xiaolong, his name didn’t even surface in Di Jun’s mind when he thought about the people that could disobey him.

Di Jun glared at Huang Xiaolong, and a suffocating aura covered the area.

The two monsters behind Huang Xiaolong released their strength and made a shocking display of power.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath, and silence filled the air.

Everyone felt that as a Heavenly Monarch, Huang Xiaolong was seeking death when he went against Heavenly Emperor Di Jun’s will. They wondered if Huang Xiaolong was relying on the two monsters behind him.

The Heavenly Emperor was one of the peak existences in the Divine World! Rumors were going around that Di Jun had already surpassed the Emperor Realm to become the generation’s supreme master! No matter how strong Huang Xiaolong’s monsters were, they couldn’t have already surpassed the Emperor Realm. Killing them was nothing more than stomping on ants for Di Jun. As for Huang Xiaolong, he was someone who could be killed with a single breath.

“Huang Xiaolong, the Divine World is vast. But no matter how boundless the Divine World is, no one dares to go against me.” Di Jun sat high on his Nine Dragon Throne as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “Do you really think that I won’t be able to do anything to you?”

“Are you sure that no one dares to go against your will?”

“...”

A trace of rage flashed through Di Jun’s face, and he stretched his hands out towards Huang Xiaolong. A crushing pressure congealed in the air.

“Right. Even if you want to pin a crime on my head, what are you going to say?” Huang Xiaolong ignored the ugly look on Di Jun’s face, and he continued, “Zhao Tailong violated the rules of the competition, and it’s natural for you to cancel his rights to participate. Why aren’t you punishing him?”

When they heard how Huang Xiaolong was counter-attacking and scolding Heavenly Emperor Di Jun, even the faces of the ancestors behind Di Jun turned ugly.

As for Di Jun, he broke out into laughter. “Huang Xiaolong, am I the Heavenly Emperor or you? Who are you to say that I can’t pin a crime on your head and punish you as I please?”

The killing intent around Di Jun spiked, and the air turned stale.
