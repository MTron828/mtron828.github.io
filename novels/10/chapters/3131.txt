Chapter 3132: A Generation of Coward!

When Huang Xiaolong comprehended the power of metal, a majestic phenomenon could be felt on the Heaven Piercer. The sound of metal clashing with one another rang through the entire ship.

The experts on board saw the mirages before them and the clanging rang loud and clear through their ears.

Lei Qianqian and Hao Zhen were coincidentally in the area, and Hao Zhen gasped in shock, “Power of metal!” He was clear that someone managed to comprehend the power of metal on board the Heaven Piercer.

Lei Qianqian was also surprised. Ordinarily, one would choose a secret spot to cultivate. Especially when they wanted to comprehend one of the thirteen elements. That was the first time she had seen anyone comprehending one of the elements in such a public space!

“Whose palace did it come from?” Lei Qianqian couldn’t help but ask.

She knew that it came from the second-class cabins, but she didn’t know which palace exactly.

“It’s the young man…” One of the experts from the Lightning Phoenix Race reported. As though he was afraid Lei Qianqian wouldn’t know who he was referring to, he continued, “He’s the person who killed the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race!”

“It’s him!” Lei Qianqian gasped in shock.

Hao Zhen frowned as he didn’t expect the youngster to comprehend one of the peak powers on board the Heaven Piercer.

All of a sudden, the golden hue that enveloped the area disappeared. Under the gazes of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong left his cabin with Lei Yu and the others.

Ignoring everyone, he planned to disembark the Heaven Piercer. However, before he could leave, a lovely voice rang through the air. “Young Master, please wait.”

The voice contained a magnetic effect, and everyone turned to look at the speaker.

It was none other than Lei Qianqian, and Huang Xiaolong decided to see what she was up to. Ordering Lei Yu to stop, he turned around.

“Young Master has to be careful when entering the Black Frost Abyss. From what I know, the members of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race brought over a huge army to ambush you.” Lei Qianqian warned. “If Young Master doesn’t mind, you can enter the city with us. I know the patriarch of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, and I can mediate the situation.”

Everyone felt a trace of jealousy rising in their hearts. They glared at Huang Xiaolong as they knew that Lei Qianqian was trying to foster a sense of friendship between the two parties.

In the Origin Lands, there were only one or two people in the younger generation who could catch Lei Qianqian’s eye.

Now, Huang Xiaolong was one of them!

Anyone could see that Lei Qianqian was interested in the man.

Hao Zhen’s expression sank.

“There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled under his breath.

Everyone looked at him as though they were looking at a crazy person. He actually rejected Lei Qianqian’s goodwill!

Riding on Lei Yu, Huang Xiaolong soared through the skies.

Lei Qianqian was taken aback as she stared at his leaving figure. That was the first time anyone said no to her!

“Princess, do we…” One of the experts of the Lightning Phoenix Race stepped forward and asked if they should stop Huang Xiaolong from leaving.

All of them felt a trace of anger rising in their hearts when they saw how Huang Xiaolong rejected Lei Qianqian’s suggestion.

“It’s fine.” Shaking her head, Lei Qianqian regained her composure. “Let’s enter the Black Frost City.”

The Black Frost City was the city located right outside the Black Frost Abyss, and it was one of the famous cities in the Origin Lands. There were tons of treasures only obtainable from the Black Frost Abyss, and they were sold in the Black Frost City.

The reason they were there was to purchase a type of flower called the Black Frost Flower. It was something that could attract all sorts of treasures, and with it, they would be able to increase their chances of obtaining the Void Reincarnation Thistle.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t bother entering the city. He wasn’t afraid of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, but he didn’t have time to waste. He had to locate Di Shuang in three short days, and time was a little tight.

The news of Huang Xiaolong avoiding the city soon traveled into the ears of Lei Qianqian and the others.

Hao Zhen sneered at the news. “What a loser. He knows that he won’t be able to fight off all of them, and he chose to escape.”

A look of suspicion formed in Lei Qianqian’s eyes. Was that really the case? She felt that the young man wasn’t afraid of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race at all. Whatever the case, she felt a little disappointed in her heart.

In the city, the patriarch of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race, Man Yihui, received the news too. He snorted, “Hiding in the Black Frost Abyss? Heh, I'll bring everyone in there and kill him anyway!”

In an instant, the troops of the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race moved out and charged into the Black Frost Abyss.

They separated into four groups as they tried to trap Huang Xiaolong.

After entering the Black Frost Abyss, Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop for a moment as he rushed straight towards the deepest part of the abyss.

The Black Frost Abyss was extremely dense in darkness energy, and one would only be able to comprehend the power of darkness if they went to the deepest part of the abyss. As such, there was only one place for Di Shuang to be if he wanted to comprehend the power of darkness.

Activating three dao souls, Huang Xiaolong searched through every nook and cranny of the place.

Lei Yu and the others didn’t remain idle. Their ability to search for things might not be as strong as Huang Xiaolong, but they released their dao souls anyway. The only people who were of any help were the Myriad Formation Devil and the Dark Shadow Devil. One was skilled in the art of formation and the other was adept in the power of space. Nothing could escape their detection.

However, the Black Frost Abyss was boundless. There were tons of people looking for treasure in the area, and there were many Black Frost Beasts lurking around. There were also several Ice Beasts, and the difficulty of locating Di Shuang in three days was sky high.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye, but a suspicious fluctuation coming from the depths of the abyss caught Huang Xiaolong’s attention.

With his knowledge, he quickly determined that it was the power of darkness!

Raising his right hand, Huang Xiaolong signalled to the thirteen of them. All of them retracted their auras in an instant as they lowered their speed.

They quickly approached the separated space where he felt the fluctuations, and the Myriad Formation Devil looked at the restrictions in the area. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Your Highness, that’s the Nine Heavens and Ten Earth Grand Formation. We will need a lot of time if we wish to enter the space.” A frown formed on He Zhen’s face when he made the report.

The formation was one of the ten strongest formations in the Origin Holy World, and it was clear that Di Shuang laid it down in order to stop anyone from disturbing his cultivation.

“If we can’t enter, we’ll just make him leave the space.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. Summoning the Blood Dragon Stele, he smashed it towards the formation.

The moment he made his move, Man Yihui noticed Huang Xiaolong and the others. With a single order, every single expert from the Silver Horn Barbarian Locust Race charged towards their location.
