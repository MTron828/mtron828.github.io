Huang Xiaolong chuckled mysteriously and said, “It’s a secret.”

The ladies immediately felt lightheaded, as though they could collapse at any moment.

“Uncle, do you have some sort of unspeakable secret with Mo Xiao?!” Bei Xiaomei rolled her eyes and shot a suspicious look at Huang Xiaolong.

This time, it was Huang Xiaolong’s turn to nearly faint.

“What are you talking about?! How can two grown men share an unspeakable secret?” Huang Xiaolong yelled as he tried to defend himself.

Bei Xiaomei stared at him like a guilty convict, and it was evident that she didn’t believe him. She bombarded him with questions without end.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong had no choice but to explain himself. He turned around and spoke, “Before the selections in the Fortune Emperor Palace, I went to the Floating Twilight Lands to temper myself. Do you guys remember?”

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao nodded. They were extremely clear about that. In the past, Huang Xiaolong had slapped Sun Shihai into a pig head after returning from his training expedition. The scene was too shocking for any of them to forget.

“I killed several members of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace, and I caused some trouble there during that time. I butted heads with the Martial Demon Emperor Palace, and Mo Xiao eventually made a move on me. No one would have thought that he would recognize the little cow, and we eventually became acquainted with each other.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao were stunned silly.

So that’s what happened.

The two ladies were extremely clear about the little cow’s ‘awesomeness.’ When they had visited the Silver Fox Commerce in the past, even Bei Xiaomei’s father, the president of the Silver Fox Commerce, Bei Lengyang, had addressed the little cow as his senior.

It wasn’t surprising for the little cow to know Mo Xiao.

However, Bei Xiaomei stared at Huang Xiaolong, and she asked with suspicion in her voice, “Is that it?!”

Huang Xiaolong kept a straight face and lied. “Of course.”

“Little cow? What’s a little cow?” Zhao Lei couldn’t help but ask.

Even though the ladies knew about the little cow, Zhao Lei didn’t.

Li Shan was extremely curious as well.

Huang Xiaolong’s lips curled upwards. “Master, do you remember my mount?”

Zhao Lei yelled in shock. “You... You mean that the little cow you were riding on knows Mo Xiao?!”

Li Shan’s expression changed, as well.

The two of them had never bothered with the ordinary-looking cow Huang Xiaolong always messed with when they were back in the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Bei Xiaomei chuckled, “Uncle Zhao, you have no idea how amazing the little cow is! Even my father knows her! He even addresses her as his senior! In the past, my father personally went out to welcome uncle and the little cow when they came to visit the Silver Fox Commerce.”

Zhao Lei, Li Shan, Golden Brow, and Blood Knife felt their jaws dropping to the ground. They stood there like wooden chickens, dumbfounded as they stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Even the president of the Silver Fox Commerce had to call the little cow ‘Senior!’ Bei Lengyang personally went out to welcome the both of them when they went to visit the Silver Fox Commerce!

This!!!

Even if Mo Xiao, the Martial Demon Emperor, personally visited the Silver Fox Commerce, Bei Lengyang wouldn’t bother welcoming him personally.

Who in the world was the little cow?! What godly existence was she?!

However, the most intriguing question was that how could the little cow be Huang Xiaolong’s mount?!

Zhao Lei stared at Huang Xiaolong, and a complicated feeling arose in his heart. He laughed bitterly. He felt that it was surprising enough for Huang Xiaolong to bring back four beasts at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. However, he never thought that his disciple would be hiding even more earth-shaking surprises.

It seemed as though his understanding of Huang Xiaolong was less than he thought!

This brat! How many secrets is he hiding from me?!

Although he was grumbling, Zhao Lei knew that everyone had their secrets. If Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to tell him about it, he felt that there was no need to ask.

Everyone laughed as they made their way to Manor 6.

In the distance, everyone saw Mo Xiao standing at the manor’s entrance, waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s arrival. Other than Mo Xiao, all the ancestors, grand elders, elders, and every one of their disciples were present!

Seeing the warm welcome Mo Xiao had prepared, Zhao Lei and Li Shan felt their heart trembling.

They knew that Mo Xiao wasn’t there because he respected either one of them. Neither were they welcoming Bei Xiaomei or Fang Xuanxuan.

Mo Xiao was personally welcoming the disciple of their Fortune Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong!

Without suspense, Mo Xiao’s eyes lit up the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong. He ran over, and when he finally arrived before Huang Xiaolong, he chuckled softly, “Young Master Huang... You’re finally here!”

Looking at the smile on Mo Xiao’s face and his respectful attitude, Zhao Lei and Li Shan felt their vision spinning. Was this the same cold-blooded and ruthless Mo Xiao of the Martial Demon Emperor Palace?! Was this the Mo Xiao who could walk sideways in the Floating Twilight Lands?!

Even the ladies had a baffled expression stuck to their faces.

Chen Kaiwen, Yan Kang, and the other ancestors quickly put on their brightest smile as they greeted Huang Xiaolong. “Greetings to Young Master Huang!”

An awkward silence descended upon the members of the Fortune Emperor Palace.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he turned to Mo Xiao and chuckled. “It has been a hundred years since we last met in the Floating Twilight Lands. Martial Demon Emperor Mo Xiao, you look more handsome than before.”

Mo Xiao hastily shook his hand to dismiss Huang Xiaolong’s praise. “Young Master Huang, how can you address me as Emperor Mo Xiao?! If you really look highly upon me, please address me as Mo Xiao!”

Who in the world was Huang Xiaolong?! He was the Grandmist Emperor, Jiang Hong’s junior brother! He was the direct disciple of the King of Grandmist himself!

When he thought about the little cow Huang Xiaolong was riding on; his heart nearly stopped beating.

When everyone else heard how Mo Xiao spoke to Huang Xiaolong, they felt a bomb going off in their head.

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother about the details, and he simply nodded his head. “Let’s go in. I bought several cases of Yin Yang Separation Wine. Let’s go in and enjoy it together.”

With his identity as the King of Hell, no need to mention Mo Xiao; Huang Xiaolong could even call the Heavenly Emperor by name if he were present.

Mo Xiao started laughing when he heard that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t disgusted by his presence. “Sure! I haven’t tasted the Yin Yang Separation Wine in a long time. Since Young Master Huang has some, I won’t stand on ceremony.”

In the next instant, Huang Xiaolong and Mo Xiao entered the manor with several others.

Other than Mo Xiao and several other Emperor Realm experts from the Martial Demon Emperor Palace, no one else entered the manor. All of them stood outside and awaited their instructions.

“This manor is so much better than Manor 61.”

Mo Xiao laughed. “It’s just a manor. With Young Master Huang’s identity, only the best manor will be worthy of your presence. The Heavenly Court is blind. No one would have thought that Yu Shi’s eyes would be growing on his backside. Young Master Huang, do you need me to drag Yu Shi out and beat him up for you?”

When Zhao Lei and the others heard how Mo Xiao wanted to drag Yu Shi out for a beating, they felt beads of cold sweat rolling down their forehead. With Mo Xiao’s personality, he might just do as he said.

Huang Xiaolong simply laughed it off. “He is just an insignificant character. I will personally take care of him once the Battle of the Heavenly Court ends.”

Feeling the killing intent rising from Huang Xiaolong’s body, Mo Xiao felt his heart constrict. “Great. As long as Young Master Huang gives the command, I will not hesitate to carry it out. Even if you ask me to jump into a pit of fire, I will willingly do so!”

Everyone eventually made their way into the main hall, and they found their seats.

“Young Master Huang, did Senior Azure Cow come along with you?” Mo Xiao hesitated for a moment before asking.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and said, “She’s treating her injuries with my Master. My senior brother is helping them, and none of them came with me.”

Mo Xiao’s eyes nearly popped out of his socket when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.
