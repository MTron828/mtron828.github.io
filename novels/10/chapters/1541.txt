Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the disciples who were about to leave stopped dead in their tracks.

An expression unsightly beyond compare appeared on Tian Ziyi’s face as he glared at the little cow. “What do you mean by that? Do you think that you can keep us here forcefully?”

This damn cow is merely Huang Xiaolong’s mount... As an elder in the Brilliance Emperor Palace, why should I listen to a cow?!

Bai Yunxiang turned to sneer at the little cow, “We’ll leave when we want to. Even if Zhao Lei was here, he wouldn’t have the guts to force us to stay.”

In their opinion, Zhao Lei would have to lower his head when speaking to them, much less a damn cow.

As soon as they spoke, everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s party revealed a strange look. Even Jiang Hong’s face lit up as he turned to look at them.

He couldn’t help but look at the members of the Brightness Emperor Palace in pity.

In the past, even the Palace Master of the Brightness Emperor Palace had to run with his tail tucked between his legs when he met Senior Azure Cow. As for people who dared to act arrogantly in front of her... They wouldn’t be able to find a handful of them after combing through several world surfaces, right?

A brilliant smile appeared on the little cow’s face and she said, “From what I can see, this mountain peak seems a little too tall. Walking down will take too long. How about you guys roll back to the bottom? You’ll be able to save both your energy and time “

Roll down the mountain!

Save energy and time!

When her suggestion entered their ears, the rage they had been trying to suppress burst out like water from a broken dam.

What did this damn cow just say?!

How dare she ask us to roll down the mountain!

Not only was this mountain at least three thousand feet high, it was also covered in thorny poisonous bluegrass. Not mentioning the sharp rocks on the surface, it would be a feat to survive after rolling off it. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Xiang Xun reached out with his palm and slapped the void above the members of the Brightness Emperor Palace. They felt a sudden burst of dark energy invading their bodies and it sealed off the godforce in their body. In the next instant, they were sent flying.

Xu Baisheng and the others watched as Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the disciples rolled off the mountain.

As Xiang Xun had already sealed off their strength, they were unable to stop as they rolled off the mountain. Neither could they use their godforce to protect themselves.

One of the disciples that rolled down ended up with a sharp rock stabbed deep into his thighs.

Miserable screams came one after another as they went rolling down the mountain..

As the screams became softer and softer as they rolled further down the mountain, the little cow turned to Xiang Xun and chided, “You should have used your hellfire to burn off all their clothes before throwing them down...”

Everyone stared at the little cow with their mouths agape.

Xiang Xun smiled bitterly and said, “ Yes, I will keep in mind, Senior Azure Cow.”

Huang Xiaolong laughed in delight and announced, “The meat is ready!”

In an instant, all of them forgot the brief interlude with the members of the Brilliance Emperor Palace.

After more than an hour.

Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang and his group finally arrived at the foot of the mountain and they laid on the ground, gasping for air. A sense of horror filled their mind as they tried to get over the fact that they had escaped from certain death.

After crawling back to their feet with great difficulty, they looked at their tattered body that was covered with cuts and bruises. A wave of shame and anger clouded their mind as killing intent surged in them.

“I swear that I will definitely tear that cow up into tiny pieces one day!” Tian Ziyi shouted furiously.

Bai Yunxiang fished out a chaos spiritual pill, swallowed it and gnashed his teeth in anger, “There’s still that damnable Huang Xiaolong! He better pray that he doesn’t end up in my hands in the future!”

When Xiang Xun’s dark energy started to dissipate after a short while, all of them managed to gain control over their godforce once again.

They quickly circulated their godforce to recover from their ‘adventure’.

A few hours later. Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang stood up and stared resentfully at the peak of the mountain before taking their leave.

“Huang Xiaolong, Fortune Emperor Palace, you guys wait and see!”

“This matter won’t end here!”

......

The next day. Huang Xiaolong and his group resumed their journey towards the Ghost River.

They managed to arrive in the remote Ghost River in half a day and they felt a chilling energy covering their bodies.

Standing in front of the Ghost River, they looked at the multi-colored water as it flowed downstream for hundreds of meters. They could hear faint sounds of wailing in the distance and felt a cold shiver run down their spines.

Huang Xiaolong released his divine sense and tried searching for the source of the wails. However, after several minutes of searching, he failed to find what he was looking for.

The wails seemed to come from the depths of the sky, from the bottom of the earth and from the depth of one’s soul.

“Junior brother, how is it?” Jiang Hong wanted to see if Huang Xiaolong could feel the presence of the grandmist aura around them.

Since Huang Xiaolong had refined the purple grandmist qi and grandmist aura before, he should be able to sense the presence of grandmist aura as long as it was nearby.

“Let me try.” Huang Xiaolong replied before using his godforce to stimulate the purple grandmist aura within his body. He sent out his purple grandmist aura into the surroundings.

However, Huang Xiaolong realized that there seemed to be some kind of mysterious barrier surrounding the Ghost River that stopped him from spreading his purple grandmist aura more than three to four thousand feet away.

Huang Xiaolong turned to Jiang Hong and explained the strange occurrence.

Jiang Hong was astounded that there was something that could actually obstruct Huang Xiaolong’s connection with the purple grandmist aura. After all, the purple grandmist qi was one of the supreme spiritual qi.

“Let’s go and take a look below.” Jiang Hong suggested.

This Ghost River was extremely long and they were at the start of it.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong and the rest of them started to follow the river trail.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle as they traveled downwards as he sent out his purple grandmist aura every now and then.

The Ghost River was frighteningly silent as rays of green and blue light constantly emerged from its depths. The wailing of the dead continued and seemed to follow behind Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

When they arrived at the halfway point, an intense surge of grandmist aura appeared from inside the river but it disappeared in the next second.

Huang Xiaolong was bewildered as he stopped to stare at the center of the river.

“Junior brother, what’s the problem?” Following Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, Jiang Hong’s eye landed on the center of the river as well.

“Senior brother, are you able to see what’s at the bottom of the river? For a brief moment, I seemed to sense a trace of grandmist aura coming out from the river,” said Huang Xiaolong.

Jiang Hong was pleasantly surprised. However, a bewildered look flashed through his eyes in the next moment. “Even though the bottom of this Ghost River is thousands of feet deep, there’s nothing there.”

“Why don’t we take a look?” Huang Xiaolong was certain that there was grandmist aura somewhere in the river.

“Alright.”

Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and the rest, broke through the surface of the river as they made their way downwards.

Before they had the chance to arrive at the bottom, a terrifyingly strong devouring force appeared. Before any of them could react, they arrived in the space above a primitive forest.

“I knew it. There was an independent space located in the river!!” Jiang Hong looked at his surroundings in shock. He was surprised at the fact that the independent space was able to avoid his detection.

When the rest of them looked around, they realized that they couldn’t see the end of the forest. Huang Xiaolong tried to make a connection to the purple grandmist aura in his body but was shocked to find that it didn’t react.
