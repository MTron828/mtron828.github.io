Chapter 2657: The Eternal One and Only

It was no wonder that Yuan Qianxing’s arrogance did not crumble. Just like he said, he had the Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

True Saint experts’ holy souls were said to be immortal and indestructible, but when the opponent possessed the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, death was the only end for a True Saint expert!

The way Yuan Qianxing saw it, even though Huang Xiaolong had three top saint godheads, he still couldn’t escape the fate of being annihilated by his Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads would end up as a super supplement to his Origin Saint Godhead!

Long Shengtian, Mo Wunian, Feitian Longpeng, and others around the battle stage, especially Fei Yanzi, had worried expressions on their faces.

Despite knowing that Huang Xiaolong had three saint godheads and possessed amazing combat power, she had not seen all of Huang Xiaolong’s trump cards.

“Senior Brother Qianxing will finally use the power of his Inextinguishable Dao Heart. Huang Xiaolong is nothing but a piece of sh*t under the Inextinguishable Dao Heart’s power!” Yao Ji laughed wantonly.

“As long as His Highness Yuan Qianxing absorbs Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads, His Highness would be invincible in the truest sense!” Yuan Wangfeng’s eyes shone with a fanatic, euphoric light.

Since I have been serving under His Highness Yuan Qianxing, once he conquers the Alien Lands and the Holy World, would that mean…?

On the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent facing the complacent Yuan Qianxing, “Is that so?”

With that said, golden lights flew out one by one from his three saint godheads.

Every golden light was brilliant and brimming with the aura of supremacy. Heaven and earth’s most dazzling rays enshrouded each golden light.

All around were dazed expressions after seeing the golden lights emerging from Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads, but these expressions were soon replaced by absolute awe.

“These, these are high-order Saint Fates!”

“So many of them? There are three high-order Saint Fates?!” an Otherworldly Mansion’s vice hall master exclaimed.

Greeting him was the surrounding shocked silence.

“It’s not surprising that Huang Xiaolong has three saint godheads and three high-order Saint Fates.” Yuan Wangfeng reacted and sneered coldly, “His Highness Yuan Qianxing’s one godhead contains three high-order Saint Fates!”

As expected, Yuan Qianxing also summoned the high-order Saint Fates within his saint godhead after a brief moment of surprise. Not one more, and not one less, there were exactly three high-order Saint Fates!

Yuan Qianxing looked mockingly at Huang Xiaolong, and that expression on his face said it all.

Everyone’s attention was on Yuan Qianxing’s three high-order Saint Fates, including Mo Zhi and Long Shengtian. This was the first time they were learning that Yuan Qianxing had actually integrated with three high-order Saint Fates!

During the year the Saint Fates had appeared, there had been a change in the surroundings when Yuan Qianxing had snatched for them. Thus no one had known exactly how many Saint Fates Yuan Qianxing had integrated with at that time. Now, the answer to this mystery was right before their eyes!

When everyone was shocked by Yuan Qianxing’s three high-order Saint Fates, a golden light suddenly flew out from one of Huang Xiaolong’s saint godheads.

“What?! Four, four high-order Saint Fates?!” The crowd was flabbergasted, and their attention shifted from Yuan Qianxing’s Saint Fates to Huang Xiaolong’s Saint Fates.

“...This?!” Yuan Wangfeng was dumbfounded.

While Yuan Qianxing was caught off guard by Huang Xiaolong’s fourth high-order Saint Fates, his face was unsightly despite his disdainful words, “Merely four high-order Saint Fates.”

His one saint godhead had three Saint Fates, whereas Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads merely had four Saint Fates!

When comparing, it was obvious who was better.

But right at this time, another golden light flew out from one of Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads.

“Five, five high-order Saint Fates!” Yuan Wangfeng’s eyes turned dazed, and his body quivered slightly.

Long Shengtian, Yin Zhangguo, Feitian Longpeng, and the others stared at the fifth high-order Saint Fate with their mouths agape.

Fei Yanzi’s delicate hand was pressed against her heart, as she tried to calm herself down.

Yuan Qianxing’s expression was even more unsightly, and his voice sank as he insisted, “Merely five high-order Saint Fates!”

After all, Yuan Qianxing had integrated with three high-order Saint Fates in one saint godhead. Whereas, even with his five high-order Saint Fates and three saint godheads, Huang Xiaolong was still lacking in comparison to him as it averaged to less than two Saint Fates in one saint godhead.

But he barely finished his sentence when he saw that another golden light had appeared. He nearly choked but his eyes never left the newly appeared high-order Saint Fate.

“Six, six high-order Saint Fates!”

The crowd was in an uproar.

The shrieks coming from all around the battle stage were filled with shock and disbelief.

Yuan Wangfeng, Yao Ji, and Chen Muguang felt their throats go dry, whereas Fei Yanzi’s hand on her chest pressed down firmer.

Then, another golden light emerged!

“Seven, seven!”

A vice hall master yelped, but before he could finish what he wanted to say, the eighth golden light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s saint godheads.

“Eight, eight!”

Then, the ninth golden light joined the lineup.

“Ninth, ninth!”

The vice hall master suddenly started stuttering, mouthing his numbers.

“This, this isn’t true, right?!”

“Ninth, ninth! This is unprecedented, eternally one and only, ah!”

Though it wasn’t cold, people were sucking in breaths of cold air, as they were rendered shocked and speechless.

Yuan Qianxing, who was being disdainful towards Huang Xiaolong a while ago, was completely frozen, and not a sound came from him anymore.

His fingers dug into his palms, as he clenched his fists tightly. At the same time, his eyes were fixed on the nine high-order Saint Fates!

Three saint godheads, nine Saint Fates!

Like him, Huang Xiaolong had integrated three Saint Fates within each of his saint godheads!

Just as everyone thought that it was going to end there, suddenly, another golden light flew out. It appeared in front of everyone quietly, shining brilliantly, and shocking everyone until their eyes almost fell out of their sockets.

“Ten, ten, ten!” The same vice hall master started stuttering again.

Mo Wunian’s eyes dimmed slightly. Am I a…?

On the other hand, Fei Yanzi pressed on her chest again with a little more force.

Huang Xiaolong took note of the crowd’s expression as he released the eleventh high-order Saint Fate! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Elevel high-order Saint Fates in a row in high air. The world seemed as if it was losing its brilliance, and Yuan Qianxing’s Origin Saint Godhead’s three high-order Saint Fates looked dim and bleak in comparison. The Origin Saint Godhead’s three Saint Fates huddled together, akin to moths seeking warmth from closeness.

“How come?! It’s not possible. How could there be eleven high-order Saint Fates!” Yuan Qianxing roared hysterically.

Huang Xiaolong sneered as his twelfth Saint Fate flew out, and the world’s light was eclipsed.

Everyone stared foolishly at the twelve high-order Saint Fates in an orderly row in high air.

Yin Zhangguo was already numbed from the consecutive shocks he had received today that he was speechless. When Huang Xiaolong had revealed his nine Saint Fates, he had proclaimed Huang Xiaolong as an unprecedented genius, eternally one and only. What should he say now that there were twelve high-order Saint Fates?

Suddenly, Yuan Qianxing laughed loudly like he had gone mad. “Excellent, excellent! This is simply wonderful! Huang Xiaolong, the stronger your three saint godheads are, the better it is. With my Inextinguishable Dao Heart, I will absorb your three saint godheads, and devour your twelve high-order Saint Fates. Then, I will truly be super invincible!”

Huang Xiaolong shot Yuan Qianxing a ridiculing gaze. In the next second, the Holy Mandate Imprint between his eyebrow let out the brightest dazzling rays, stupefying the crowd. Rays of inextinguishable light also shone from his chest, coupled with grand dao energy that flowed around Huang Xiaolong like best-behaved children.

Yuan Qianxing’s hysterical laughter died as his fantasy of becoming super invincible shattered into smithereens, kicking him back to reality.

“In-Inextinguishable Dao Heart!” someone in the crowd yelled.
