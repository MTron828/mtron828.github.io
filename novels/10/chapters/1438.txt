Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and the others who weren’t aware of this were shocked by the little cow’s revelation.

Treasures left behind by several Emperors!

What could be those treasures? Huang Xiaolong mused with anticipation.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, the little cow grinned widely and said, “What, interested? The treasures left behind by those kids are indeed quite good, but it’s useless even if you’re interested.”

Huang Xiaolong cast a confused look at the little cow.

“That’s because the Great Desolate Formation has been monopolized by the Fortune Emperor Palace and Nine Dragons Emperor Palace. Only the Fortune Emperor Palace and Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Elders and above can enter the formation.” The little cow explained, sounding a little schadenfreude.

Huang Xiaolong blanked momentarily, then glared at the little cow.

This old cow, why didn’t she say so earlier. She had made him daydream for a second.

At that moment, he wasn’t even a Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciple, so who knew how many years would have passed by the time he climbed to the position of a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Elder.

The little cow went on as if she hadn’t seen Huang Xiaolong glared at her, “In truth, other than leaving some treasures inside the Great Desolate Formation, those kids also left something outside the formation.”

Huang Xiaolong and the others blanked for a moment, then delight rose on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“But, you won’t be able to take away that thing with your current strength.” Before Huang Xiaolong could utter a word, the little cow nipped his hope in the bud.

Huang Xiaolong felt his joy plummet to hell in a tumble.

When Huang Xiaolong stared at the little cow with murderous intent, she cleared her throat nervously, and appeased softly, “Though it’s not possible to take it away at your current strength, Xiang Xun can do it.”

Only then did the murderous glint in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes softened a little, only a little.

As the Great Desolate Formation was located on the Brimming Snow Mainland of Brimming Snow World, Huang Xiaolong’s group determined the direction and flew off.

Two days later, the group stopped in the air above the Brimming Snow Mainland.

Seemingly, snowflakes were falling heavier on Brimming Snow Mainland.

It was white in every direction they looked, as layers upon layers of snow was blanketing their surroundings, yet it didn’t look chaotic; from a distance, the ‘white’ scenery was pleasing to the eye.

A thought flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s mind—in the future, he could bring Li Lu here for sightseeing.

Li Lu likes snow.

Then, Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts wandered off, thinking of Shi Xiaofei. Like Li Lu, Shi Xiaofei also had a special liking for snow.

The others dared not nudge him or disturb him, as they saw Huang Xiaolong lost in his thoughts while looking at the falling snowflakes.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong spoke a few minutes later, breaking the silence. He soon started flying towards the Brimming Snow Palace.

After billions of years of changes due the passage of time, cities had emerged around the periphery of the Great Desolate Formation, and the formation itself was located within the Brimming Snow City.

An hour later, after paying the required spirit stones for the entrance fee, Huang Xiaolong’s group entered the city.

Upon entering the Brimming Snow City, their sights brightened at the exquisite and dream-like buildings that were exuding celestial air.

It was lively, but there was also a peaceful calmness.

The blood battles outside seemed to have no relation here.

Huang Xiaolong immediately took a liking to this city, and smiled widely at his group. “Let’s buy a residence in this city and stay for a few days.”

So that when he returned here in the future with Li Lu, Yao Chi, and even Shi Xiaofei, there will be a place for them to stay.

But as Huang Xiaolong said this, a sharp snicker sounded from the side. “Where did a bumpkin like you run out from? You actually dare to say that you want to buy a residence in our Brimming Snow Palace, do you think you can afford it?”

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he turned to look at the owner of this voice, and so did the others. A group of disciples was walking behind them.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed dangerously seeing the nine dragons emblem on their robes.

Disciples of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace!

Seeing it was a group of Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi’s eyes turned slightly red with wrath.

The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace continued to talk, and joked amongst themselves. One of them looked at Huang Xiaolong and said sarcastically, “Brat, do you know how many spirit stones the cheapest residence in Brimming Snow City costs? I’ll tell you, so listen carefully—it’s a hundred million low grade-seven spirit stones! Did you hear that? Low grade-seven spirit stones, one hundred million of it!”

One hundred million low grade-seven spirit stones! Inwardly, Huang Xiaolong was genuinely a little surprised. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

One hundred million low grade-seven spirit stones was equivalent to fifty million mid-grade seven spirit stones, equal to twenty-five million high grade-seven spirit stones, or 12.5 million top grade-seven spirit stones!

The majority of the Divine World’s first-rank forces wouldn’t be able to afford it.

As they saw shock flicker across Huang Xiaolong’s face, the Nine Dragon Emperor Palace’s disciples chortled, “Look at this brat’s face!”

The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples laughed loudly.

“Come on, let’s go! The Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple is here. We have go welcome him!”

“Senior Brother Lin, I’ve heard that the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Fang Xuanxuan is also here in our Brimming Snow City, is it true?”

“Fang Xuanxuan is not someone we can discuss. But remember that she’s going to be our Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple fiancée sooner or later. At that time, she would be our Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Young Madam. In the past, when some disciples had talked about Fang Xuanxuan, the words had reached our Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple. Those people’s tongues were cut off and their mouths were sewn shut because of that!”

As the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciples were leaving, a cold glint flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. But his thoughts were interrupted when he had heard that Fang Xuanxuan was also in the Brimming Snow City.

This ‘Fang Xuanxuan’ was most likely the same Fang Xuanxuan he had come across at the High Martial World’s auction.

A pretty young lady’s face emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s memories.

“Why are you standing here foolishly? They are already gone.” The little cow spoke in an untimely manner and interrupted Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts. “That Azure Dragon Disciple is chasing Fang Xuanxuan, so if you want to woo Fang Xuanxuan, then you need to eliminate that Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple first, hehe!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the little cow and kicked her as he scolded her with a short temper, “You talk too much.”

“Come on, you lead the way.”

The little cow protested, “I’m someone even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor needs to be courteous to, you kid better...!”

Huang Xiaolong gave her another kick before she could finish, and scolded, “Lead the way!”

The little cow was finally quiet, and obediently led the way.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the others raised their heads, awed by the sky, and pretended they did not see anything.

Half a day later, with Xiang Xun’s help, Huang Xiaolong’s group finally reached the location where the several Emperors had left something outside the Great Desolate Formation, according to the little cow.

However, when Huang Xiaolong saw what that ‘something’ was, he was rendered speechless.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest also had strange expressions on their faces.

“This is the thing the several Emperors have left behind?” Huang Xiaolong pointed at the single strand of hair in front of him and asked the little cow. His face was slightly ashen due to anger.

But the little cow responded nonchalantly, “Don’t underestimate this hair, it’s an armpit hair left behind by a desolate era divine beast, the Heavenly Python Azure Bovine.”

Armpit hair!

Sweat trickled down from Huang Xiaolong’s forehead to his neck.

“This bovine hair is actually a spatial artifact.” The little cow said quickly, before Huang Xiaolong broke out in violence.

Huang Xiaolong and the others were dumbfounded.

Spatial artifact? This cow hair? Huang Xiaolong still couldn’t react.

“What’s so strange about this is that once your cultivation reached the Emperor Realm, and you have comprehended space esoterics, you can refine anything into a space artifact.” The little cow explained.
