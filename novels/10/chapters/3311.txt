Chapter 3312: Urgent Matters

Seeing as they were about to crash into Huang Xiaolong, a formless barrier stopped the car several meters from his body. 

The youngster in the car was shocked, and he pressed down on the accelerator. Even though his pedal was against the floor of the car, he failed to move a single inch!

The tyres screeched as the smell of burning rubber filled the air.

There were countless people who were walking along the streets, and they quickly turned to look at the interesting scene playing out in front of them.

One minute later, the youngster finally gave up and he quickly got out of the car. There was an insignia of the word ‘紫’ on the pockets of his shirt, and Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes when he looked at the other party. The word could only mean one thing. The kid was from the Murasakigawa Clan!

With his face giving off some pretty femenine vibes, he rushed at Huang Xiaolong and glared at him from top to bottom. “Chinese pig, humph! You’re pretty strong if you’re able to stop my new car! Are you a Golden Core Realm cultivator?” After he spoke, he handed Huang Xiaolong a card. “This is my name card. My company is hiring bodyguards right now, and you should be able to earn two hundred low-grade spirit stones a month. Look for me if you’re interested.”

After speaking, he left towards one of the malls at the side of the street. 

Seeing as the other party didn’t even offer a single word of apology, Huang Xiaolong’s expression darkened. He was speechless.

As the doors of the mall opened, a formless energy dragged the youngster back towards Huang Xiaolong. No matter how hard he struggled, he failed to resist the pull.

Gasping in shock, he stared at Huang Xiaolong in anger, “Chinese pig, are you trying to stop me?! If you try anything like this again, you won’t be leaving on your legs today.”

Huang Xiaolong slapped him as soon as the words left his lips. He didn’t slap him through the air. Instead, his palm landed on the left side of the man’s face.

“Pa!” Blood filled the mouth of the man from the Murasakigawa Clan. The world started to spin around him as his nose broke from the impact.

Not expecting Huang Xiaolong to move against him, the man cupped his face and yelled in fury, “Chinese pig, do you know who I am?!”

As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Xiaolong’s palm landed on the right side of his face. Half his teeth were beaten out of his gums.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Call me that again and I’ll twist your head off your shoulders.”

The young man might be enraged by Huang Xaiolong’s actions and threats, but he didn’t dare to utter a word.

Grabbing the man’s name card, Huang Xiaolong read, “Chairman of the Wanhao Bodyguard Company, Murasakigawa Marriot”

Resisting the pain shooting through his face, the man sneered, “That’s right! I’m a disciple of the Murasakigawa Clan, and my father is an elder! My grandfather is a grand elder of the family, and my sister is an inner disciple of the Ice Palace! I created the Marriot Bodyguard Company, and we have three hundred Golden Core Realm cultivators!”

When the man was bragging about his achievements, Huang Xiaolong snorted, “So what?”

Murasakigawa Marriot stared at Huang Xiaolong with his mouth agape.

With a wave of Huang Xiaolong’s arm, Murasakigawa Marriot felt a searing pain shoot up his shoulders.

“I crippled your arms because you tried to crash into me with your car. This can be considered a little punishment for your actions. You can try to take revenge with the power of your family. I’ll stay here for a single day.”

“However, if you choose to do that, your arms won’t be the only thing I cripple.” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

After he spoke, Huang Xiaolong turned to leave. He threw the card casually and it stabbed into one of the nearby rocks.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

After he left, Murasakigawa Marriot roared in rage, “Chinese pig, you’re going to regret that!”

He could be considered one of the most influential young masters in Tokyo, and he could shake the city with a stomp of his feet. However, he was defeated by a random brat from the Huaxia Alliance! He didn’t just get slapped twice, his arms were also crippled!

He planned on getting someone from the family to pick him up, but he realized that he had lost all feeling in his arms!

“What are you looking at?! If you keep watching, I’ll cripple your arms myself!” Murasakigawa Marriot roared at those watching from the sidelines.

There were many in the crowd who recognized the insignia on Murasakigawa Marriot’s clothes, and they left quickly in their cars. As for those who didn’t know who he was, they yelled in anger, “Who do you think you are?! Do you think we want to look at a cripple such as yourself?!”

“Yeah! You’re someone who was crippled by someone from the Huaxia Alliance! How dare you bark at us on the streets?”

“If I were you, I would have slammed my head into the wall and committed suicide!”

As more and more people mocked him, Murasakigawa Marriot felt his intestines going green from anger.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know where he wanted to go after he dealt with the man. He strolled around the city as he admired the scenes.

A hundred years ago, Tokyo was completely different from what it was currently. Huang Xiaolong tried to locate the Pangu Axe as he roamed the streets. Before he knew it, he was standing under the Tokyo Tower.

A hundred years had passed, but the tower still stood tall.

In the past, there weren’t many buildings around the tower. However, everything has changed since then. Towering skyscrapers could be seen all around it.

After stopping for some time, Huang Xiaolong decided to leave.

Just as he was about to walk away, a group of several dozen people with anxious looks on their face approached him.

They couldn’t help but stop when they saw Huang Xiaolong. Looking at their attire, Huang Xiaolong couldn't help but ask, “Are you from the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce?”

They stared at him in shock and replied, “Yeah. Are you from the Huaxia Alliance?”

Nodding, Huang Xiaolong continued, “That’s right. I wish to ask you about someone.”

In the past, Huang Xiaolong followed Huang Jiyuan all the way to Tokyo in order to look for an old friend. The person they were looking for was the director of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, but they were set up by the disciples of the Murasakigawa Clan along the way. If not for the man’s help, they wouldn’t have been able to leave on the second day!

As such, Huang Xiaolong was pleasantly surprised to meet the members of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce on the street.

“Who are you looking for?”

“Manager Chen, we should head back as soon as possible. If we arrive later, Young Lady Lu might be in serious trouble.” Someone among them yelled.

The person in the lead apologized to Huang Xiaolong after hearing the comment. “Little brother, we have something urgent to attend to. Sorry.” After they spoke, all of them rushed off.

Young Lady Lu? Huang Xiaolong recalled that ‘Lu’ was precisely the surname of his father’s old friend.

With curiosity burning in his heart, he quickly followed behind them.
