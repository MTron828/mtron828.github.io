Chapter 3639 – Are You Afraid I’ll Cripple Him

Yu Xiaohong didn’t hold back and her second kick caused Jian Xiyuan’s spine to snap.

Initially, Jian Xiyuan was an expert with 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He would be able to put up a fight against Yu Xiaohong, but he was careless! He didn’t think that she would move against him with the threat of Jian Wushuang hovering over her head!

Yi Xiaohong didn’t stop there. She appeared before Jian Xiyuan before slapping him heavily. When her palm landed on Jian Xiyuan’s face, he flew out once again.

“That’s for your foul mouth.”

Struggling to get to his feet, Jian Xiyuan’s gaze was cold as killing intent raged in his eyes. He glared at Yu Xiaohong and he roared, “Yu Xiaohong, you bitc…” He was about to finish his word when he saw the cold gaze in her eyes. Swallowing his words, he changed the topic immediately. “We’ll report this to our patriarch! He will definitely tell our ancestor about this incident!”

“When that happens, our Lord Ancestor will pay a visit to your celestial empire personally!”

Yu Xiaohong couldn’t be more calm and she sighed, “Go back and tell Jian Wufeng and Jian Wushuang that there’s no need for them to come over. We’ll head over to your Jian Family in a short while.”

Taken slightly aback, Jian Xiyuan stuttered, “Fine… Fine! We’ll do just that!” Looking at Zheng Shen and the others, he quickly backed away.

“We’re leaving!”

Zheng Shen and the others didn’t make things difficult for the members of the Jian Family and they allowed them to leave.

After Jian Xiyuan and the others were gone, Yu Xiaohong returned to the courtyard in the palace and made a report to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly and muttered, “Alright. You can take your leave for now.”

Everyone quickly left his courtyard.

Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong chuckled to himself. He planned to visit Tao Han’er on his trip, but who would have thought that the Jian Family would mess with them before they even arrived?

…

Jian Xiyuan and the others left the city in a sorry state.

“Lord Xiyuan, how dare that sl*t attack us?!” Jian Chengfeng couldn’t contain the rage in his heart and he roared in anger. He couldn’t take the slaps lying down!

Killing intent filled Jian Xiyuan’s eyes and he continued, “That b*tch crippled Yu Dawei and attacked us… She even said that she would pay a visit to the Lord Ancestor. Seems like she’s tired of living! I’ll make a report to the patriarch right now!”

Jian Wufeng soon received a report.

He stared at the report in shock.

“What?! She’s not willing to hand over the spiritual veins?!” Jian Wushuang frowned and he looked at his son. “Well, that’s nothing special. She wouldn’t be able to find them in the span of a day anyway.”

Jian Wufeng hesitated for a moment and continued, “Jian Xiyuan also said that she wouldn’t return us any of our treasures.”

“Oh?!” Jian Wushuang frowned and he was stunned by the news.

“Did she really say that or is Xiyuan talking nonsense? Is she really not planning on returning my sword manual?” Jian Wushuang asked again. He could understand the reason behind Yu Xiaohong’s actions of crippling Yu Dawei. However, he couldn’t believe the fact that she would lust over the treasures of the Jian Family.

“That was what Xiyuan said in his report.” Jian Wufeng said. “He wouldn’t lie to me. Moreover, she kicked him twice, causing his spine to snap! She also slapped Jian Chengfeng eighteen times!”

“What?!” Unable to contain his surprise, Jian Wushuang allowed a small part of his sword intent to leak. The city trembled.

Not a single person missed the sword intent that came from the Jian Family Manor, and they stopped what they were doing.

“Give me the report.”

Jian Wufeng didn’t dare to dally in the slightest as he passed the report over to his father.

He read the report word by word as the frosty expression on his face grew stronger.

A moment later, Jian Wufeng spoke after Jian Wushuang had retracted his aura. “Father, the ceremony is about to begin. We can always look for her after the ceremony ends. After all, she has already refined the sword pills. That might be the reason behind her reluctance to return our treasures.”

“Since she swallowed the pills, she will eventually belong to us in a few years. We can do whatever we like to her then!”

Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Wufeng quietly and the latter eventually lowered his head.

“Are you afraid that I’ll cripple her? It’s been so many years… Are you still not over her?” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Jian Wufeng didn’t dare to say a word. He was a God of Creation with more than 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Even so, he was like a little kid before Jian Wushuang.

“Relax… Since you love her so much, I won’t cripple her. However, I won’t let her off easily after she injured the eminent elders of my Jian Family!”

“Many thanks to Lord Father!” Jian Wufeng thanked profusely.

Several days passed in a flash.

Everything that happened in the imperial palace of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire caused a storm to spread in the Zhu Lan Land.

In the days that passed, Huang Xiaolong cooped himself up in his courtyard to read the sword manual written by Jian Wushuang and he had no idea what happened in the outside world.

With his speed, he reached the eighteenth page in a few short days. As the pages at the back were harder to understand, his speed slowed down considerably.

Huang Xiaolong’s respect for Jian Wushuang grew as he continued to read the manual. He had to admit that he was far from Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the sword dao. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

One fine day, Yu Xiaohong and the others came over to find him.

“Lord, there’s something we wish to report.” Yu Xiaohong didn’t dare to speak loudly in case she distracted him from his comprehension.

“Speak.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes didn’t leave the sword manual and he spoke.

“We heard that the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce will be selling a batch of universe-level spiritual veins in a few days.”

“Oh? Them again?” Huang Xiaolong snapped the manual shut.

“That’s right. There seems to be two hundred spiritual veins in the batch they are planning to auction off. There are several top-grade universe-level spiritual veins among them.” Yu Xiaohong explained. She knew that Huang Xiaolong urgently needed them.

“That’s a lot…” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Zheng Shen laughed all of a sudden, “I heard that the oldest son of the patriarch of the Jian Family will be attending along with Young Lady Tao Han’er. Right… Mei Jie’s son might also be there!”
