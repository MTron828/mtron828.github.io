Chapter 3655: Jian Wushuang’s Sword Dao

Seeing as Jian Wushuang had stepped up, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

Tao Han’er was the only one in the audience who started to panic. Stepping between Jian Wushang and Huang Xiaolong, she cried, “Lord Huang, Grandpa, don’t do this! There’s no need to resort to violence!”

“Han’er, it’s alright. I’ll experience your grandpa’s sword dao and exchange some pointers with him.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Jian Wushuang smiled too. “Fellow Cultivator Blue Dragon is right. Han’er, step back. We know when to stop.”

Tao Han’er could only return to her seat quietly.

Everyone else in the hall retreated to the side too. Those who were weaker ran all the way out. For experts like Jian Wushuang to take action, every single shockwave due to the exchange had the ability to wipe them out of existence.

Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong also went to a corner of the hall.

Gui Chi, Mie Jie, and Elder Baixuan Tian retreated to the other side of the hall and stood beside each other.

“Lord Gui Chi, who do you think will win?” Mei Jie asked.

Gui Chi didn’t say a word and a somber expression hung on his face.

Elder Baixuan Tian replied in his place, “Brother Wushuang’s sword dao had reached an unfathomable level. We can’t begin to comprehend the abilities he possesses. He will definitely come out victorious!”

Gui Chi continued to remain silent as he cursed in his heart. So what if his sword dao is strong?! So what if he understands the way of the sword?! Nothing matters if the other party is much stronger! He can just bulldoze his way to victory!

Gui Chi looked at Huang Xiaolong and Jian Wushuang and sighed. Obviously, he hoped that Jian Wushuang would win! But from the looks of it…

Jian Wushuang made his move all of a sudden! No one saw how he did it. Not even Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, or Mei Jie!

Jian Wushuang’s sword couldn’t be described. It seemed like the sword he was using had encompassed the entire universe.

The dao souls of everyone in the city felt a terrifying sword qi hovering around them, but they couldn’t pinpoint its location!

Even so, they were sure that it was present!

Huang Xiaolong could tell that Jian Wushuang’s sword qi was expanding endlessly. It was as though it had turned into the universe itself. He was like a tiny little creature hovering in space, ready to be killed by the sword qi.

Of course, that was before he showed his strength.

All of a sudden, a terrifying pressure descended on the lands as Huang Xiaolong’s three great worlds started to spin.

When Jian Wushuang’s sword qi arrived, a massive explosion ensued.

It was as though the world was ending as the river of time threatened to split apart.

Even though the exchange happened in the blink of an eye, everyone felt that they had taken a trip through time and space.

Was that what it meant to possess a sword dao at the universe level?

Indeed. That was Jian Wushuang’s sword dao. It had exceeded the confines of the universe laws.

Jian Wushuang’s sword seemed to come from the universe origin and it went on forever.

The light around Huang Xiaolong’s body was broken and his body trembled slightly. After some time, the sword qi started to fade.

The space around the hall returned to normal and everyone came back to reality.

When they looked at Huang Xiaolong, they saw him stepping back slightly.

Gui Chi and the others sucked in a cold breath. They could tell how terrifying the strike was. If they were in his place, they would have died a million times over! Not even their dao souls would have survived!

However, the man they call the Blue Dragon Young Master only retreated slightly!

What shocked them the most wasn’t that. Instead…

“Three great worlds!”

They discovered that Huang Xiaolong was an existence with three great worlds!

With his grand cosmos energy, he blocked Jian Wushuang’s strongest attack with brute force!

Jian Wushuang stared at Huang Xiaolong with a horrified expression. He was also frightened by the discovery that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds!

“Your universe level sword dao is strong indeed… Too bad you can’t break through my defense.” Huang Xiaolong addressed Jian Wushuang directly without caring about the reaction of those in the hall.

Huang Xiaolong had to admit that Jian Wushuang was strong. However, technique was nothing in the face of pure strength!

The difference in their strength was too large!Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jian Wushuang’s expression fell and he seemed to age a lot. “Indeed… I have lost.”

“No. You didn’t lose.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head.

In terms of sword dao, Jian Wushuang was the undeniable winner of the battle! After all, Huang Xiaolong’s sword dao was nothing compared to the man!

With a complicated expression on his face, Jian Wushuang continued, “It doesn’t matter how you put it. I have lost.”

He naturally knew the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words. However, the exchange between experts depended on strength! The winner was king!

Indeed… Jian Wushuang had lost!

Even though Huang Xiaolong didn’t make a move, Jian Wushuang couldn’t break through the other party’s defenses with his strongest attack! There was no point in fighting any more!

When everyone was still flabbergasted by the outcome, Huang Xialong walked towards Mei Jie and Zhu Jian.

Their hearts skipped a beat when Huang Xiaolong approached.

“Father…” Zhu Jian held his father’s sleeves tightly as his legs threatened to give way.

“Lord Blue Dragon, I am Mei Jie of the Zhu Family. My son offended you in the past but I hope that you can put it behind you on behalf of Lord Zhu Chen.” Mei Jie cupped his fists and bowed towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong snorted in response, “Mei Jie, do you really not know who I am?”

From the looks of things, Mei Jie didn’t seem to know who he was!

Mei Jie was equally as stunned.

Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and Kun Feng, Kai Dong, and Xuan Hong appeared in the hall.

“Kun Feng?! Kai Dong?! Xuan Hong?!” Mei Jie’s expression changed when he saw them.

“Fourth brother!” The three of them rejoiced.

“Fourth Brother, that’s Huang Xiaolong! He was the one who destroyed our Creation Palace!” The three of them yelled in unison.

Evidently, they had no clue what was going on.

They thought that Huang Xiaolong would release them because of Mei Jie’s interference.

Mei Jie drew in a sharp breath and he looked at Huang Xiaolong before turning to the three of them.
