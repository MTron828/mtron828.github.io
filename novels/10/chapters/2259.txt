Chapter 2260: Egg of a Holy Beast

“Your Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong,” The eldest of the Three Red Devils, He Longjie, quivered in fear as he spoke, “As long as you are willing to spare our lives, we can tell you a shocking secret!”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t tempted in the slightest, and he responded, “I would still find it out after searching your souls!”

In fact, from the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples’ memories, Huang Xiaolong had already learned what the Three Red Devils’ ‘shocking secret’ was.

The Three Red Devils plunged into despair. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Your Highness Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong, we know we’re bound to die, but before we die, we have a last request.” Second Brother, He Longde, pleaded, “Please annihilate the Holy Alliance!”

If the Holy Alliance hadn’t given them the wrong information, misleading them to think that the three of them were enough to kill Huang Xiaolong, they would not have stayed there, waiting for Huang Xiaolong’s arrival. Therefore, they resented the Holy Alliance down to their bones.

“Don’t worry, even if you don’t make this request, I will do it.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently searched the Three Red Devils’ souls for their memories and then devoured their’ complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, leaving only their heads as proof of completing his task.

He also collected the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples’ and Three Red Devils’ spatial artifacts before walking to the space in the inner section of the Three Red Devils’ residence.

There was only one item inside this space!

An egg!

A giant egg!

The egg’s surface was densely covered with intricate, mysterious patterns. These patterns were probably inscribed on the egg by someone, for it exuded a powerful sacred aura. Clearly, the inscriber was someone who had already stepped into the True Saint Realm.

Something worthy enough for a True Saint to make the effort of inscribing these detailed patterns on the giant egg showed just how valuable the egg was. This egg was the shocking secret the Three Red Devils had tried to tempt Huang Xiaolong with earlier.

A giant egg that was a holy beast’s egg!

Only a holy beast that possessed complete bloodline inheritance could be called a holy beast, and only this kind of holy beast could advance to True Saint Realm.

One point to note was that there were fewer holy beasts than Holy Princes. For example, the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground’s Holy Gate had thirty Holy Princes, but in the entire Zhuoyuan Holy Ground, there was only one holy beast. This spoke volumes as to how rare a holy beast was.

Although the value of a holy beast egg was lower than an actual holy beast, it was still a precious treasure.

Huang Xiaolong reached out, placing his hand on the egg and spurred his three complete dao saint godheads’ power, and gently probed the life within the holy beast egg.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong removed his hand, and there was a big smile on his face.

From his probings, Huang Xiaolong could already confirm that the holy beast egg in front of him was going to hatch soon. At most, in a little over a hundred years, the little guy inside would break out.

Generally, it took ten million years and even a billion years for a holy beast egg to hatch. It was a stroke of good luck that the holy beast egg he found was already close to hatching. Huang Xiaolong honestly admitted that he did not have the patience to wait for millions of years.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had learned that there was a kind of medicinal potion that could speed up a holy beast egg’s incubation time from Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories. With this medicinal potion, the holy beast egg would hatch in a decade, maybe even in a short few years. There was no need to wait a hundred years or more.

Huang Xiaolong put away the giant holy beast egg into the lightning bead’s space then left the Three Red Devils’ residence.

Not only he had successfully completed his training task of killing the Three Red Devils this time, but he had also devoured the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples’ saint godhead and saint bloodline, and even picked up a giant holy beast egg. This put Huang Xiaolong in a good mood.

If Eminent Elder Guo Qirong knew about his harvests, would he still have given Huang Xiaolong this task? Huang Xiaolong gloated inwardly.

Huang Xiaolong was done with his task after killing the Three Red Devils with ample time to spare, so he was in no hurry to return to the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate. He planned to find a place at this Blue Sea to cultivate and completely absorb the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples’ as well as the Three Red Devils’ saint godheads, saint bloodlines, and saint physique.

Huang Xiaolong did not leave the Spirit Fire Island. He found a suitable cave in another range of barren mountain, and laid out multiple layers of restrictive and defensive formations around before starting to absorb the five people’s saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique.

The two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples were no ordinary disciples. Their statuses in the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate were only second to a Holy Prince. Both of them were personal disciples of Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s Hall Masters and they both possessed complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline that ranked quite high.

One of them had a complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline that ranked slightly after two thousand, while the other disciple’s complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline ranked lower. The gap was not very big.

Luckily, Huang Xiaolong attacked decisively, transforming into his primordial divine dragon form, and even resorted to using the four divine fires and the lightning bead. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so easy to kill them as he did.

It was a great pity that the Three Red Devils’ complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique’s rankings were too low for Huang Xiaolong’s taste; it was way below three thousand.

Four months soon went by.

In these four months, apart from refining and absorbing the five people’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique, Huang Xiaolong was also popping level-five origin spiritual pills like snacks as he cultivated.

Under the efficacy of level-five origin spiritual pills, Huang Xiaolong fully absorbed the five people’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique without problem. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong successfully advanced to late-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm, touching the border of peak late-Ninth Order Sovereign.

I wonder what my three complete dao saint godheads, three saint bloodlines, and saint physique rank now? Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Originally, if he had merely devoured the Three Red Devils’ complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline and saint physique, his rankings would have been a tad higher than Huang Zhouping’s rankings, but with the addition of the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate Hall Masters’ personal disciples, Huang Xiaolong was certain that his rankings were now a lot higher than Huang Zhouping’s.

Huang Xiaolong got to his feet and stretched to loosen his muscles, taking a few deep breaths of the fresh air while thinking, “Huang Zhouping, it will soon be your turn!”

Huang Xiaolong turned into a streak of light across the sky and left.

However, Huang Xiaolong was not returning to the Holy Gate headquarters just yet. Instead, he planned to take a look around the Spirit Fire Island’s Spirit Fire City.

As the biggest island among the Flood Cave Islands’ archipelago, the Spirit Fire Island’s Spirit Fire City was one of the biggest trading locations.

Here, one could always purchase spiritual herbs and spiritual pills that could not be bought in many dynasties.

He might find the several spiritual herbs required to concoct the medicinal potion to speed up the giant holy beast egg’s hatching here.

....

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Spirit Fire City.

Just as Huang Xiaolong entered the Spirit Fire City, he felt many malicious gazes falling on him and staring at him with greed. Despite being the safest city on the Blue Sea, robberies and killings were common here.

Huang Xiaolong, as a late-Ninth order Sovereign, appearing alone like the young master of some big family, he was the ‘little fat sheep’ the people around here liked the most.

Huang Xiaolong headed in the direction of the Spirit Fire City’s biggest trading market without a change in his expression. He walked around idly, and bought the required spiritual herbs when he saw them without bargaining.

As expected, Huang Xiaolong’s generous spending made those people watching him change his label to ‘big fat sheep.’ Their gazes on Huang Xiaolong grew increasingly hot.
