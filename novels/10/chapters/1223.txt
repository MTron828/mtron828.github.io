Hu Qi’s words made Hu Dan’s pretty face tighten in worry for Huang Xiaolong.

"Can’t protect myself?" A cold indifferent voice sounded behind Yang Liming, Hu Qi, and Ouyang Yunfei.

Hearing this familiar voice, Yang Liming, Hu Qi, and Ouyang Yunfei subconsciously quivered. All three slowly turned back in fear and saw Huang Xiaolong striding towards them from the distance.

"Elder Brother Huang!" Hu Dan cried out, her face beaming with happiness. She rushed to Huang Xiaolong’s side in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded at her.

"Elder Brother Huang, they...!" Hu Dan pointed vengefully at the trio of Yang Liming, Hu Qi, and Ouyang Yunfei.

"Don’t worry, I’ll deliberate my fair judgement for you." Huang Xiaolong reassured her and then turned to look at the trio in front of him with cold eyes.

Although Huang Xiaolong did not know the details, he could roughly make a guess from everything he had just heard.

It seems like Yang Liming, Hu Qi, and Ouyang Yunfei are in a real hurry to die sooner! He hadn’t even finished looking into their troublesome conduct, but these clowns have already been jumping around as they liked.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards the three of them.

"Huang Xiaolong, what’re you doing?!" Yang Liming shouted. He warned Huang Xiaolong, "we are at the Fortune Gate and fighting is prohibited here. Don’t you dare attack us!!"

"I’m a personal disciple of Elder Sun Peng, how dare you...?!" Hu Qi shouted loudly but his words were cut off when Huang Xiaolong’s hand clutched his throat.

Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei were scared. They didn’t even see how and when Huang Xiaolong caught Hu Qi.

Hu Qi was terrified as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. His heart fell to the bottom of an ice cave as he felt this murderous intent coming from Huang Xiaolong.

Hu Qi did not doubt anymore that Huang Xiaolong would dare to kill him.

"Don’t worry, I won’t kill you." Huang Xiaolong said as he looked at Hu Qi’s terrified face; the corners of his lips curved into a smile.

Hu Qi dazed for a second. The terror in his heart slowly subsided, ’looks like Huang Xiaolong is still wary of Fortune Gate’s rules. Also, since they were personal disciples of Fortune Gate Elders, Huang Xiaolong didn’t have the guts to kill them.’ CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

"What? Huang Xiaolong, are you afraid? Let me go this instant then!" Hu Qi sneered proudly and added, "But this matter won’t end here! When I go back, I will ask my Master to sue you in front of our Young Lord!"

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong’s other hand clenched into a fist and punched straight into Hu Qi’s chest.

The force from Huang Xiaolong’s fist passed through Hu Qi’s chest and came out from his back. A blood curdling scream escaped Hu Qi’s mouth as his body flew backwards. Everyone could see the appalling bloody hole in Hu Qi’s chest.

The abrupt turn of events rendered Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei deathly pale.

"I said I won’t kill you, but that doesn’t mean I won’t teach you a small lesson." Huang Xiaolong’s expression was frosty.

Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei’s faces twitched at Huang Xiaolong’s words. ’This is a small lesson??!’

Both Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei could see that the punch from Huang Xiaolong had crippled Hu Qi almost entirely.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and looked at Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei. Just this much was enough to make Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei to back away in dread.

"Senior Brother Li Chengwen, save me!" Yang Liming screamed all of a sudden.

Li Chengwen, the disciple in charge of the Nine Boundaries Tower was hiding nearby. He flew out hearing Yang Liming’s scream. At this point, he could no longer stay hidden. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to explain to Wang Wei or Yang Liming’s Master.

Though, on the other hand, he could not afford to offend someone like Huang Xiaolong.

"Brother Huang, Junior Brother Yang Liming and the others were just joking, don’t take it seriously. Let’s end this matter here, what do you say?" Li Chengwen could only lower his attitude and try to persuade Huang Xiaolong. "If Brother Huang chooses to cultivate here at the Nine Boundaries Tower, I will surely select a good place for brother."

Huang Xiaolong looked from Yang Ming to Ouyang Yunfei and then at Li Chengwen as his lips curled into a sneer. "Who is your brother? Scram or don’t blame me for being rude."

‘Give him a good place when he would come to cultivate? What a joke?! The Fortune Divine Kingdom Thousand Spirit Mountain’s spiritual energy was a million times better than the Nine Boundaries Tower. Why would he need to come here to cultivate?’

Even though Huang Xiaolong was not aware of the exact relationship between Li Chengwen and Yang Liming; since Yang Liming had called for Li Chengwen’s help, it meant they were better acquainted. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong naturally chose to ignore Li Chengwen.

Scram?! Li Chengwen didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to dismiss him by telling him to scram...

His face sank while he endured in anger, saying, "Huang Xiaolong, I...!" Before Li Chengwen could finish his words, he was slammed away by an enormous hand. He crashed to the ground and didn’t move anymore.

It was the Black Baboon who slammed Li Chengwen.

Li Chengwen was just an early Seventh Order Ancient God Realm disciple, hence how could he withstand the Black Baboon’s attack?

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother to see Li Chengwen’s condition, and simply continued walking towards Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei. Though his current strength could easily defeat Li Chengwen, he didn’t want to expose his strength at this moment.

Suddenly, Yang Liming gritted his teeth and waved his hand at Huang Xiaolong. Several hundred black beads flew towards Huang Xiaolong. In a sway, Yang Liming had escaped a few hundred meters away.

These black beads were called star soul beads that Yang Liming had gotten from an ancient cultivation dwelling.

One star soul bead was refined from one planet, each contained horrifying fire and lightning element energy. Once it met with collision, star soul bead would explode, which could destroy a small mainland.

Yang Liming believed as strong as Huang Xiaolong was, he would still suffer heavy injuries.

Huang Xiaolong watched as several hundred black beads flew towards him. Although he did not know what these black beads were, he felt the overwhelming destructive power inside them. Just as he was about to wave them away, the little cow shouted: "Wait!"

Huang Xiaolong’s halted immediately.

In the next second, lightning crackled from the the little cow’s golden horns forming a net made with streaks of lightning. Several hundred black beads were collected by this lightning net in an instant.

The little cow sighed in relief at the result.

Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei had already fled into the distance. Huang Xiaolong didn’t have time to ask the little cow what the black beads were as his hand grasped through the void, Yang Liming and Ouyang Yunfei shrieked in pain and plummeted to the ground.

Yang Liming fared better as he fainted upon his crash. But Ouyang Yunfei on the other hand was spitting white foam from his mouth. His eyes turned white as he fainted into oblivion.

Huang Xiaolong still held back slightly against Hu Qi and Yang Liming, but towards Ouyang Yunfei, Huang Xiaolong had no scruples.That palm strike completely crippled Ouyang Yunfei.

With Ouyang Family almost annihilated, he won’t let Ouyang Yunfei live to annoy him.

"Let’s go." Huang Xiaolong said to the stunned Hu Dan and flew away leisurely. Hu Dan came to her senses and quickly chased after Huang Xiaolong.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, the Nine Boundaries Tower incident spread like wildfire among Fortune Gate disciples.

After Huang Xiaolong separated from Hu Dan, he returned to the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

When Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, their first sentence to him was, "Kid, you bring us trouble as soon as you return."

At this, Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly and asked, "That’s not trouble at all; don’t tell me I dared to make trouble for two Masters?"

Golden Brow and Blood Knife laughed at Huang Xiaolong’s words.

"Kid, you just couldn’t stay still when you came back in Green Cloud Island, could you? Dragon Origin Sect and Twin Cities Sect have clamored all the way here in regards to Ouyang Family’s matter. You’d better behave for a few days and prepare for the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle." Golden Brow Ancestor added, "I received news that Wangu Ziyi is preparing to breakthrough to Sixth Order Ancient God Realm."
