The Mohe Plane was the number one Divine Plane in the Hell Asura World.

Not only was it because it was the biggest Divine Plane in the Asura World, it was also because many superpowers had built their headquarters on the Mohe Plane.

More than thirty plus superpowers that ranked in the top hundred in the Hell Asura World had built their headquarters on Mohe Plane.

It was an extremely rare sight to see dozens of superpowers building their headquarters on a single Divine Plane.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had mentally prepared himself for his arrival on the Mohe Plane, he realized that he had underestimated it. The scale of the Mohe Plane was far beyond his imagination.

The Desolate Ancient Divine Plane where the Primordial Black Dragon Clan was located was one of the biggest divine planes in the entire Divine World. However, the Mohe Plane was at least a thousand times bigger! No, it might even be several thousand times bigger!

Huang Xiaolong was stunned as he stood in the space above the Mohe Plane as he stared at it in awe. The entire divine plane was shrouded in layers of dark light that exuded a fearsome pressure. As for Jin Yuan and the rest, they were standing behind Huang Xiaolong and they remained extremely silent.

After a short while, the four of them transformed into the appearances of ordinary people.

“Let’s head over.” Huang Xiaolong regained his senses and flew towards the Mohe Plane with the four of them in tow.

Soon, the five of them broke the barrier surrounding the Mohe Plane and officially entered the divine plane.

“What frightening darkness energy!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in surprise after entering the Mohe Plane.

Tai Yue smiled and said, “Master, you might be unaware, but there are more than four hundred low-grade chaos spiritual veins and eighteen middle grade chaos spiritual veins sealed underneath the mountain ranges of the Mohe Plane! Moreover, they are all of the demonic yin attribute.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a breath of cold air.

More than four hundred low-grade chaos spiritual veins!

Eighteen middle-grade chaos spiritual veins!

Isn’t this simply too extravagant?

Back when he had won six low-grade chaos spiritual veins from Wang Yongsen during the apprenticeship ceremony of the Fortune Emperor Palace, he shocked everyone around him. Right now, he learned that there were more than four hundred of those under the Mohe Plane!

Moreover, there were even eighteen middle-grade chaos spiritual veins!

Even the top ten Emperor Palaces in the Divine World would treat a middle-grade chaos spiritual vein like a priceless treasure. As for the top hundred Emperor Palaces, they might even have difficulty looking for one. However, there were eighteen of them right before him!

“Are these chaos spiritual veins formed naturally?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

“Most of them are formed naturally, and it is said that the Mohe Plane was the first Divine Plane formed in the Hell Asura World. Legends has it that the Mohe Plane is blessed by the heavens and rumors has it that there is a demonic yin spiritual sea under the plane.”

Demonic yin spiritual sea!

It’s no wonder then...

Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of shock in his heart.

Only after the demonic yin energy had reached an astonishing level, would it finally gather to form a demonic yin spiritual sea. There was no doubt that there would be natural spiritual veins in the vicinity of the demonic yin spiritual sea.

Wan Yutian and the three others then brought Huang Xiaolong to the headquarters of the Netherworld King’s Organization.

“Master, this is the Arxan Mountain Range, and it is the main headquarters of the Withered Bone Sect.”

The Withered Bone Sect was one of the top ten superpowers in the Hell Asura World.

“That is the Black Sea, and it is the main headquarters of the Hell Prison Sea.”

Similarly, the Hell Prison Sea was also one of the top ten superpowers in the Asura World.

“And this is Tianxiang City, where the main headquarters of the Lifeless Sect lies!”

Even though the Lifeless Sect was not a top ten superpower in the Hell Asura World, they were still in the top twenty.

As they moved along, the four of them would enthusiastically introduce Huang Xiaolong to the places of interest.

Of course, there weren’t many superpowers that deserved to be introduced by the four of them.

Huang Xiaolong committed all of the names to his memory.

“Is the Asura Sect’s headquarters built here as well?” Huang Xiaolong’s heartbeat started to speed up when he asked the question.

The four of them were startled.

“No, the Asura Sect’s headquarters is on the Netherworld Divine Plane. However, there is quite a big branch of the Asura Sect here.” Fan Hui replied.

“Billions of years ago, the Asura Sect was the number two superpower in the Hell Asura World. However, due to that battle that happened billions of years ago, they had lost too much of their resources and turned too weak. Right now the Asura Sect has declined to become the tenth superpower in the Hell Asura World. If they continue to weaken, they will probably drop out of the top ten in the next hundred thousand years.” Jin Yuan sighed emotionally.

“Which battle are you referring to?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Several billion years ago, the Ancestor of the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe declared war on the Divine World. He enticed the sect leaders of countless sects in Hell to join him, and the leader of the Asura Sect personally led several tens of billions of disciples to take part in the battle. In the end, the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe, the Asura Sect, and many others who took part in the battle suffered a disastrous defeat. The Asura Sect Leader even died at the hands of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor!

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and changed his tone, “Jin Yuan, I want you guys to help me investigate if there is a disciple called Ren Wokuang in the Asura Sect!”

The four of them acknowledged respectfully. Even though they felt that it was strange for Huang Xiaolong to pay so much attention to the Asura Sect, they didn’t ask any further questions since Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to explain himself.

Afterwards, Huang Xiaolong also requested them to check the whereabouts of a Fortune Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple, Fang Mingyu.

Even though the Hell Asura World was infinitely big, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find out the whereabouts of the two of them with the influence of the Netherworld King’s Organization.

“Master, that is the Nine Prison City, and it is also where the headquarters of our Netherworld King’s Chamber of Commerce is located! Would you like to go and take a look?” Tai Yue asked suddenly as they passed by an enormous city.

Huang Xiaolong looked over and saw a city the size of a small Divine Plane! Over the city, countless rays of brilliant lights intertwined, and even an ordinary low-level Emperor wouldn’t be able to touch them.

“Maybe next time. Let’s head to the headquarters of the Netherworld King’s Organization first.” Huang Xiaolong contemplated for a while before making his decision. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The thing he wanted most was to increase his strength using the Demon God Blood Pool. He wanted to retrieve the chaos lightning pool found in the land of inheritance.

The four of them nodded their head respectfully and continued flying forward.

After flying for more than ten days, the few of them finally arrived at a gigantic mountain range that was surrounded by a dark green flame.

“Master, this is the Green Flame Mountain Range, and it is one of the three largest mountain ranges on the Mohe Plane. Our Netherworld King’s Organization headquarters is located in the depths of this mountain range. In this world, other than the ten Great Commanders, no one else knows about the true location of our headquarters. Old Master’s inheritance is located inside the headquarters.” Fan Hui explained.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised as he didn’t expect that the headquarters of the Netherworld King’s Organization would be located in the depths of the Green Flame Mountain Range. In fact, Huang Xiaolong had received some news about the Green Flame Mountain Range in the past ten days or so. He knew that it was where the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe resided and he knew that they were considered one of the few super forces in the Hell Asura World.

Is the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe part of the Netherworld King’s Organization?
