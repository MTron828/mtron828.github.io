Chapter 3238: The Huang Family on Earth

Left Earth for a hundred years!

Huang Xiaolong might not care about it much when he spoke of his absence, but the two of them felt their brains trembling in their heads. Ordinarily, only Nascent Soul Realm experts were able to pierce through the atmosphere to leave the planet!

Wouldn’t that mean that the youngster before them was an expert in the Nascent Soul Realm?!

“I… I have no idea what senior wishes to know…” The both of them stuttered.

Nascent Soul Realm experts were considered supreme experts in the eyes of mortals!

Not to mention the fact that the man standing before them was probably already a Nascent Soul Realm expert a hundred years ago!

“Do you know about the Chuan Province that existed a hundred years ago? Where is it now?”

After the changes eighty years ago, the entire layout of the world changed.

The Huang Family of the past was located in the Chuan Province of the Huaxia Country, but the changes confused Huang Xiaolong.

Even though they were curious about Huang Xiaolong’s sudden question, the two of them replied respectfully.

Donglin Province?!

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised that the name of the province had changed. Noting it down, he started to ask about the events that happened in the Huaxia Alliance and the Donglin Province.

There were more than sixty provinces in the Huaxia Alliance, and the Donglin province was one of the largest and most important among them.

“Do you know about the Huang Family?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

“Huang Family?!” Liu Duan and Xu Shijie jumped in shock. “Lord, are you asking about the ancient martial arts family, the Huang Family?!” Could the mysterious expert before them be part of the Huang Family?!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly when he saw their reactions. It seemed as though the reputation of the Huang Family wasn’t too bad! Otherwise, the two of them wouldn’t have heard of them!

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

When they received the confirmation that Huang Xiaolong was asking about them, Liu Duan quickly spoke up, “We know that the Huang Family who was known as an ancient martial arts family of the past has already been classified as one of the ten strongest cultivation families of the Huaxia Alliance!”

“Huh?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock. “One of the ten strongest cultivation families of the Huaxia Alliance?”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect that.

It seemed as though the Huang Family progressed quite a bit during the time he was gone.

The Huaxia Alliance was the strongest alliance in the current world, and even the Six Swords Gate had to think twice if they wanted to go against the entire alliance. As such, one of the ten strongest cultivation families of the Huaxia Alliance was nothing to scoff at. One could only imagine the power and prestige the Huang Family held!

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the current state of the Huang Family.

“Have you heard about Huang Jiyuan of the Huang Family?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Huang Jiyuan was Huang Xiaolong’s father on Earth.

He might be Huang Long’s son, but he was sent to Earth during his past life, and the relationship between Huang Jiyuan and himself wasn’t something that could be written off as he pleased!

“Huang Jiyuan?” The two of them stared at each other for a moment before shaking their heads.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel a sense of disappointment washing over him.

Even so, a trace of hope remained in his heart. Since the Huang Family was one of the ten strongest cultivation families in the Huaxia Alliance, it was possible for his parents and sister to have reached the Foundation Building Realm.

“Who’s the current patriarch of the Huang Family?!”

“The current Huang Family Patriarch is called Huang Houde.” Xu Shijie replied instantly.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

It wasn’t a foreign name. Instead, it was extremely familiar.

In the past, he was hailed as the most talented of geniuses alongside Huang Houde. The two of them clashed with each other constantly, and grievances formed along the way. Huang Houde planned for Huang Xiaolong to die, and it was a grudge Huang Xiaolong couldn’t forget.

“Lord, do you know Patriarch Huang Houde?” Liu Duan asked when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s reaction.

“I do.” Glancing at the two of them, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding anything. “I formed some grievances with Huang Houde in the past.”

The two of them suddenly felt as though their lives were candles flickering in the wind. They thought that Huang Xiaolong would be happy to hear that Huang Houde was the current patriarch of the Huang Family, but they didn’t expect the two of them to be enemies!

Soon after, Huang Xiaoong learned that Huang Houde had already entered the Nascent Soul Realm several years ago, and he was currently a Sixth Level Nascent Soul Realm Expert.

Sixth Order Nascent Soul Realm!

That was the level of a top level expert in the Huaxia Alliance!

Even on Earth, Huang Houde was able to walk sideways!

It was no wonder the Huang Family reached its current heights. With Huang Houde’s personal strength, he could easily trample on members in the same generation!

“Who’s the strongest cultivator in the Huang Family right now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“It’s Huang Ming!” A trace of fear formed in the eyes of Liu Duan and Xu Shijie when they spoke his name.

Even when they talked about Huang Houde, they weren’t too afraid!

Huang Ming! Complicated feelings welled up in Huang Xiaolong’s heart when he heard the name.

Huang Ming was the old ancestor of the Huang Family, and he was the survivor of Shaolin who escaped to the mortal world! He created the Huang Family, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect him to still be alive!

In the past, Huang Ming treated him pretty well. After all, he was one of the two biggest talents of the Huang Family. Huang Xiaolong could still remember the kind look on Huang Ming’s face with his silver beard drifting in the wind.

Next, he learned that the old ancestor of the Huang Family had already entered the Enlightenment Realm. He was the sole reason the Huang Family had the rights to remain in the top ten strongest families of the Huaxia Alliance.

After chatting for more than an hour, Huang Xiaolong learned the general state of the Huang Family.

He also learned that Earth no longer used money as their currency. Instead, everything was measured in spirit stones.

Gold and oil were no longer the most sought after commodities on Earth. Instead, spiritual veins, spiritual herbs, and everything that could assist in cultivation were the hot potatoes.

When he left, he pointed at the space between their eyebrows and chuckled. “Return and practice this specialized martial art. You will be able to enter the Nascent Soul Realm in ten years.”

With their jaws dropping in excitement, Huang Xiaolong disappeared from their sight.

“What… What did that lord say?! Did he just say that we will be able to enter the Nascent Soul Realm in ten years if we cultivate the martial art he showed us?!” Liu Duan and Xu Shijie stared at each other in shock.

They knew that their talent only limited them to the Golden Core Realm, and there was practically no hope of them ever breaking through! However, Huang Xiaolong said that they would be able to, in ten years to boot!

“You shall not tell anyone else about our meeting today.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice suddenly rang through their minds. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

With their hearts trembling in fright, the two of them bowed and remained standing there for a long time. They only returned to their senses a long time after Huang Xiaolong had left.
