Looking at Wei Hong who was crying out miserably, Ren Wokuang revealed a cold smile as he broke the bones in Wei Hong’s forearm.

Wei Hong yelled furiously amidst his cries, “Ren Wokuang, if you have the guts then kill me now! Otherwise, I will haunt you even after I become a ghost.”

“Even after you become a ghost? Doesn’t that sound familiar?” Ren Wokuang roared in laughter as he said derangedly, “Every time you saw me in the Black Prison, you would break all the bones in my body and wait for it to regrow before breaking them all over again! Didn’t I say the same thing to you every time you ended my torture session? Didn’t I tell you a few days ago that I will haunt you to the ends of the earth even after turning into a ghost? Who would have thought that our positions would be reversed now!”

Before saying another word, he punched out and shattered Wei Hong’s ribs.

“However, don’t worry. I won’t let you die so easily. I will make sure to return tenfold, no, a hundredfold the pain and humiliation you have given me!”

“This punch is for Wang Mengqin!”

“This punch is for my brother Wu Cheng!”

Ren Wokuang punched out again and again. All these years, when Ren Wokuang had been tortured and imprisoned in the Black Prison, all the disciples close to him were planted with false charges on them and were successively killed by Wei Hong under Jia Ding’s supervision.

The surrounding experts had watched silently, shaking their heads.

All of the disciples, up to the grand elders in the Asura Gate, quivered in fear and none of them dared to step forward to help Wei Hong.

“Master, pat... patriarch, save... save me please.” Wei Hong hissed as he stared at Jia Ding and Huang Peng. The gaze in his eyes couldn’t hide the fear in his heart.

Even though he knew that Jia Ding and Huang Peng were powerless and couldn’t even defend themselves against Huang Xiaolong, he still grasped on to the last glimmer of hope in his heart.

However, as soon as Wei Hong’s voice sounded out, Jia Ding said frantically, “ Wei Hong isn’t my disciple anymore and I have decided to expel him out of the sect! I was unaware of everything he had done! Ren Wokuang, you are extremely talented and I can recommend you to the patriarch for him to accept you as his personal disciple!”

Looking at Jia Ding who was willing to expel Wei Hong, and recommend Ren Wokuang to become Huang Peng’s personal disciple in order to survive, Huang Xiaolong sneered in his heart.

Wei Hong glared at Jia Ding and roared, “Jia Ding! You old fogey, I served you for many years and I treated you as my own father! How dare you do this to me?!!!”

......

Half an hour later.

Ren Wokuang retracted his gaze from Jia Ding’s corpse and turned to Huang Xiaolong. He said respectfully, “Many thanks to senior for allowing me to take my revenge.”

Even though Jia Ding couldn’t be more dead, he had left Wei Hong alive. As for Deng Zhifei, he decided to let him off as they once shared some close bonds.

Huang Xiaolong could only smile helplessly, “Master, shall we leave?”

“Yes, senior.” Ren wokuang replied respectfully.

When he saw how his master was referring to him as ‘senior’, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh bitterly in his heart.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong turned and spoke to Tai Yue and the rest.

“Yes, master!”

Immediately after, Huang Xiaolong broke through the void and left the scene. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The surrounding experts felt a sense of relief as they saw Huang Xiaolong and his group fading away into the distance.

As for the members of the Asura Gate, all of them heaved a sigh of relief as though they had made a 180 degree turn from the gates of hell.

Huang Peng and the others looked at each other silently. His face twitched then he looked at the sunken continent, and collapsed mountain peaks that contained countless medicine fields. The spiritual trees and flowers that were destroyed and the lifeless branches of the Divine Tree of Darkness entered his sights.

If he had known that this was going to happen, he would have directly handed Jia Ding and Wei Hong to Huang Xiaolong!

He felt even more regretful and heartbroken when he thought about the number of low-grade chaos spiritual veins that had dried up when they had awakened the Divine Tree of Darkness. His thought process didn’t stop there as he recalled the earth-shaking battle that had happened just a moment ago. The shocking battle results would spread like wildfire through the three great worlds in Hell. Even the Spirit World and the Ghost World would learn about the humiliation suffered by the Asura Gate.

He could foresee the reputation of the Asura Gate dropping drastically as soon as everyone learned the news of their defeat.

The more he thought about it, the more unresigned Huang Peng became. Opening his mouth, he spat out another mouthful of blood.

“Patriarch!” All the ancestors yelled in shock.

“I’m fine.” Huang Peng shook his hand and said in a weak voice.

Was he really fine? His injuries were extremely serious and he would only be able to recover to his full strength after a thousand years. Moreover, the chances of him breaking into the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm would become ever so slim.

When he looked at the other ancestors beside him, he realized that their injuries were even more severe than his.

“Patriarch Huang Peng, our sect has ordered me to return to settle some pressing matters. We won’t be intruding on you any longer. Goodbye!” Xu Junhua stepped forward and cupped his fist together as he bade his farewell.

Huang Peng cupped his fist together politely in response.

Following which, the Yuanyang Valley, Dragon Lion Sect, and all the other superpowers bade their farewell one after another.

Everyone in the Asura Gate felt resentful when they saw droves of guests rushing out of the Divine Darkness Plane as though their backsides were on fire. After all, the Lifeless Sect and Yuanyang Valley were on friendly terms with them. That was also the reason they were invited to the wedding ceremony. Not only did they fail to step up when the safety of the Asura Gate was being threatened, but they also left as soon as the battle ended as though they were avoiding the plague!

“Send an order down from me. From today onwards, our Asura Gate will activate our grand array and seal off the gate of our headquarters. All disciples are prohibited from going out, and the Asura Gate will no longer receive guests!" Huang Peng said slowly.

The ancestors of the Asura Gate received the order respectfully.

Just like what he expected, the results of the battle spread through the Hell Asura World at frightening speed.

“What?! Huang Peng and all the ancestors from Asura Gate were severely injured, and Ancestor Jia Ding was even killed?! They were defeated even after awakening the Divine Tree of Darkness! How... how is this possible?!”

“Four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors and ten late-Tenth Order Emperors! Who in the world is this Asura noble?! His identity is too terrifying!”

“Four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors? Don’t tell me that they are the four Great Commanders of the Netherworld King’s Organization?! If they are, won’t that make the Heavenly Monarch the Netherworld King’s Organization’s new master?!”

For a while, all the superpowers in the Hell Asura World were shaken and overwhelmed with shock as endless debates broke out among them. The entire Hell Asura World was strongly shaken and everyone speculated the identity of the Asura noble who had crashed the Asura Gate’s event.

As for the Massacring Gods Gate that was second only to the Netherworld King’s Organization, they fell into shock and frantic discussions followed.
