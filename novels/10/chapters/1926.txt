When Huang Xiaolong heard the question, he chuckled in a low voice. “Your Wangu Clan probably knows my relationship with the Huang Family. It’s too bad you probably won’t live to learn of our relationship.” He turned to look at Wangu Changlong’s corpse and continued, “Oh right, I forgot to tell you. Wangu Rui suffered the same fate as that guy. I slapped him to death.”

The faces of the experts of the Wangu Clan turned ugly.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about their anger at all. Instead, he stared at Wangu Di and Wangu Hanyan as he continued, “Didn’t you say something about tearing off all my skin and scraping my flesh? Weren’t you going to dig out my eyeballs? Why are you hesitating now?”

Huang Xiaolong took a step towards them.

The instant his foot struck the ground, the experts from the Wangu Clan took a step back in fear.

Even though he took a step back in fear, the anger in Wangu Di’s heart burned bright. When had members of their Wangu Clan ever suffered such humiliation?!

“Don’t panic!” Wangu Di yelled in a fury. “He’s merely a peak late-Tenth Order Highgod! I refuse to believe he can deal with our combined strength! We shall deploy the Wangu Formation and crush him to death!”

“Arrange for formation!” Wangu Hanyan ordered the other elders behind him.

In an instant, their figures started to blur as they hastily tried to set up the Wangu Formation before Huang Xiaolong could react.

Looking at all of them flying about, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother stopping them.

Before long, they managed to set up the Wangu Formation.

“Kill!”

Flames enveloped Wangu Di’s body and killing intent burst out from his eyes. He sent a punch towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest, and the godforce of all the experts gathered around his fist. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The fist shattered the space surrounding it, and the structures around them started to shake from the sheer power contained in it. Everyone felt as though the sky was collapsing around them.

The faces of Huang Xiaohai, Zhao Shu, and the others changed.

Even though they knew that Huang Xiaolong was an unparalleled existence, the might contained in the fist caused their trust in him to shake. After all, Huang Xiaolong was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm right now. He was up against a formation arranged by nearly a hundred experts of the Wangu Clan!

Before they could make a move, Huang Xiaolong’s voice entered their ears. “There’s no need for you to do anything.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Wangu Di, who was throwing a punch at him, but the deadpan expression on his face didn’t disappear. Raising his arm, he flicked a single finger towards Wangu Di, and a trace of energy pierced through whatever energy Wangu Di had gathered. In the next instant, Huang Xiaolong’s attack shot through the space between Wangu Di’s eyebrows and exited from the back. A line of blood appeared in the sky.

An uneventful fight ensued as Wangu Di was sent crashing down towards Wangu Changlong’s corpse.

Boom!

A massive blast blew up the dust and sand on the ground when Wangu Di slammed into the earth beside Wangu Changlong.

Looking at Wangu Di’s face, there was a trace of disbelief in his eyes. It was the feeling he last had before his soul departed from the world.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they saw how Huang Xiaolong dealt with Wangu Di.

He slapped Wangu Changlong to death before killing Wangu Di with a single finger!

The sound of saliva being swallowed sounded out behind Huang Xiaolong as the Huang Family elders entered a state of shock.

The Wangu Family experts keeping up the Wangu Formation no longer dared to move as boundless fear gripped their hearts after watching how Huang Xiaolong had killed Wangu Di.

Ignoring the looks of fear in their eyes, Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards the members of the Wangu Clan. With the first step he took, the members of the Wangu Clan felt a heaven crushing pressure slamming into their heart.

With the second step he took, the members of the Wangu Clan felt their bodies being crushed, and they vomited mouthfuls of fresh blood.

With the third step, even a Tenth Order Highgod like Wangu Hanyan could no longer defend himself. He spat out several mouthfuls of blood.

With the fourth step, the blood vessels in the bodies of all the members of the Wangu Clan ruptured. Blood emerged from every single pore in their body.

With the fifth step, blood streamed out from every single orifice of their body as their organs turned into mush.

Just as they were about to die from the crushing pressure, Huang Xiaolong stopped.

The pressure that was smashing down on them disappeared, and they collapsed onto the ground. Their bodies turned into jelly as they gasped for breath. They felt as though they had crawled out from the depths of hell as the air that entered their lungs never felt fresher.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the bunch of people gasping for air on the ground, he raised his right palm. In the next instant, a palm print larger than a mountain blocked out the sky and came slamming down towards them.

Those elders who had barely managed to escape death stared at the massive palm print rushing down towards them, and a horrified expression appeared on their faces.

Their fear only lasted for an instant before they lost the ability to feel anything else.

When the palm landed, Divine Dan City shook.

Everyone around Huang Xiaolong failed to keep their balance as they fell to the ground.

After a long while, the earth finally regained its calm.

Everyone stared at the scene before them and saw something they would never forget as long as they existed. The massive palm print several hundreds of miles long had flattened everything in its path. It had formed a bottomless pit in the ground, and everything in its path was swallowed and turned into nothingness.

As for the experts from the Wangu Clan, not even their hair remained.

Even if everyone around were to use their butts to think, the fate of the members of the Wangu Clan was clear to all.

As Huang Xiaolong had only made a move on the members of the Wangu Clan, the Zhang Family Leader and the other experts of the Zhang Family were left alive. A bone-chilling feeling filled their bodies, and they felt their limbs freezing up.

They felt the freezing sensation travel up all the way to their hearts. As for Zhang Wei, she felt the blood draining from her face.

A single palm killed nearly a hundred experts from the Wangu Clan!

Most of the experts Huang Xiaolong killed were high-level Highgods! They were all elder level figures in the Wangu Clan!

It became so silent that the sound of a pin-drop could be heard.

Ignoring the shock on everyone’s face, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Zhang Zongyang and Zhang Wei.

When he saw that Huang Xiaolong was looking at him, Zhang Zongyang’s legs turned soft, and he fell to his knees. Tears streamed out from his eyes, and he begged, “Senior! Senior, please show mercy! Don’t kill me! I had to do what I did because of the pressure coming from the Wangu Clan! I had no choice!”

Zhang Wei and the other experts from the Zhang Family fell to their knees in an instant.

It was too bad nothing they said could thaw the cold look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“We are in-laws! Please, we know our mistakes! Don’t kill us!” Zhang Zongyuan crawled towards Huang Xiaohai’s thighs. It was at that moment he learned that Huang Xiaohai’s legs were sturdy enough for him to weather the storms of the world.

A look of disgust flashed through Huang Xiaohai’s face as he kicked Zhang Zongyuan to the ground.

......

All the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s elders were gathered in the main hall, and an outstanding young man was sitting in the main seat of the room. One person was sitting at the end of the hall, and it was, without a doubt, the Ascending Moon Old Man.

A look of fury flashed past the Ascending Moon Old Man’s face as he raged at the young man seated at the main seat in the room. “Wangu Wudi, f*ck your mother! Who the f*ck are you? What rights do you have to dismiss this old man from my position?”

Wangu Wudi stared at the Ascending Moon Old Man with a frosty expression. “Ascending Moon Old Fogey, don’t think that I won’t dare to kill you because you’re the master of that b*stard Huang Xiaolong or whatever his name is. You are no longer an elder of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union. If I really wish to kill you, it won’t be any different from me killing a dog on the side of the street!”

Even though the Ascending Moon Old Man was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm, Wangu Wudi didn’t see it as a problem. The number of peak late-Tenth Order Highgods who had died in his hands weren’t few.

As the Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled in a fury, he spat, “Wangu Wudi, you’re a scoundrel! This old man...” Before he could complete his sentence, a fist filled with killing intent shot towards him.

A look of surprise appeared on the old man’s face as he hastily raised his fist to welcome Wangu Wudi’s attack.

As soon as the fists collided, the furniture in the hall shattered. The Ascending Moon Old Man was sent flying as he started vomiting blood.
