"You be dammed!" Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s explanation, Yang Jing’s voice was immensely icy as she uttered each word in a grave tone. A magic whip appeared in her hand, and she snaked it out at Huang Xiaolong in an apt wrist flick.

Infused by Yang Jing’s godforce, the magic whip in her hand roared as it turned into a demonic dragon that breathed toxic green corpse qi. Huang Xiaolong could smell a foul stench coming from the demonic dragon even before it reached him.

This foul stench seemed to be the combination of corpse qi and poisonous qi that could temporarily confuse a soul.

Moreover, Yang Jing was a peak late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert, a flick of her whip contained mountain splitting might.

A light flickered in the depths of Huang Xiaolong’s eyes watching her. He slightly shifted his footing as if it was the most expected action, and dodged Yang Jing’s whip without any suspense.

The whip struck the ground where Huang Xiaolong stood a moment ago. The entire Giant Wolf Peak trembled at the strike of the whip, and zigzagging cracks ran across the ground surface.

When Luo Haoming had chosen the Giant Wolf Peak as his cultivation palace’s location, he had strengthened the mountain peak’s foundation with formation arrays. Yet, Yang Jing had dealt the peak a great extent of damage with a single strike of her whip. One could imagine the force she had exerted.

Yang Jing was stunned, seeing Huang Xiaolong had dodged her whip. In her opinion, her attack should have almost split Luo Haoming’s body, but the result was contrary to her imagination.

But Yang Jing’s composure returned almost immediately. Her wrist turned, and the long whip in her hand struck out again. The demonic dragon reared its head and rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

This time, Yang Jing increased her godforce. The magic whip cut across space, evoking booming air blasts in the air.

Huang Xiaolong shifted his foot again, easily dodging Yang Jing’s second attack.

Yang Jing’s expression sank with displeasure, but the long magic whip in her hand already attacked again—one strike after another, one whiplash stronger than the previous one.

Sounds of airblasts rang endlessly.

The entire Giant Wolf Peak quaked and swayed.

Every time, Huang Xiaolong easily dodged Yang Jing’s attack by merely shifting his footing.

In a short time, Yang Jing had attacked Huang Xiaolong over a dozen times.

All around were images of a long whip.

After more than ten whiplashes, the whip’s afterimages vanished as Huang Xiaolong’s hand firmly gripped the other end of the long whip.

Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent expression had turned icy as he looked at Yang Jing and said, “I’m being tolerant since you’re a woman, but if you attack again, don’t blame me for being rude.”

Yang Jing was already fuming with anger inwardly as more than a dozen attacks from her whip hadn’t even touched the corner of Huang Xiaolong’s robe. To top it off, Huang Xiaolong’s words infuriated her even further. She sneered with disdain, “Let me see how you are going to be rude to me.” Then, she exerted more force in her wrist as she tried to pull out her whip from Huang Xiaolong’s hand. However, while pulling, Yang Jing realized that she couldn’t get her whip out of Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

In the next second, an overpowering brute force rushed at her from the other end of the long whip.

Yang Jing’s eyes widened in shock. A sharp pain jolted up her arm holding the long whip, and her grip loosened. The long whip fell to the ground while she staggered back several steps. The momentary collision with the brute force had reversed her blood flow.

Yang Jing’s face darkened as she stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong. This Luo Haoming is usually unremarkable, but he’s actually stronger than me?

With her talent and current cultivation at the peak late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch, her battle strength was higher than the average same realm cultivators.

Huang Xiaolong threw Yang Jing’s long whip far away to the side and spoke coldly, “Leave now.” If he was not worried about exposing his identity, he would have burst this little wench like a bubble with a finger.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes furtively swept over Yang Jing’s bosom. Inwardly, he admitted that this Yang Jing was more than voluptuous in that area. When she was attacking just now, her bosom jiggled up and down every time she flicked her long whip, bedazzling others’ gazes.

Yang Jing was outraged, seeing Huang Xiaolong throw her long whip to the side. Furthermore, when she noticed Huang Xiaolong looking at her chest, she was incensed, and her violent killing intent surged.

“You’re so dead!”

She snapped. Her body lunged into the air, forming a whirl of a death energy vortex. Her palm struck through the thick wind layer straight at Huang Xiaolong.

The massive waves of palm imprints distorted space, and interweaved among the palm imprints were palpitating green flames. Even the distant palace buildings on the Giant Wolf Peak were making cracking noises.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong stopped dodging her attacks this time around. He raised a palm and met head-on with Yang Jing’s palm.

The death energy vortex dispersed in the blink of an eye. So did the waves of palm imprints. Yang Jing plummeted from the air and staggered as she landed on the ground. There was blood trickling from the corner of her lips.

“Grand Elder Yang Jing!” The several Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s core disciples who had accompanied her cried out anxiously as they hurried over to help Yang Jing.

Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at Yang Jing and said, “Whirlwind Corpse Flame Palm is not bad, pity that you haven’t reached the major completion realm.”

“Very good, Grand Elder Luo Haoming is really hidden deep.” Yang Jing glared icily at Huang Xiaolong as she went on, “I’ve jotted today’s matter, I’ll come to ask for Grand Elder Luo Haoming’s advice another day.”

After saying that, a suction force from Yang Jing’s palm brought the long whip in the distance back into her hand. Without another look at Huang Xiaolong, Yang Jing sped away, with the group of core disciples hurrying after her.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he watched Yang Jing’s leaving figure. It looks like there would be more troubles in the future. Hopefully, this woman can be tactful. Otherwise, he won’t mind resolving her completely.

As for the little bit of strength, he had exposed today, Huang Xiaolong didn’t worry too much about it. Even if it had roused Yang Jing’s suspicion, she hadn’t discovered his secret. Moreover, the time he spent here wasn’t going to be very long as he planned to leave immediately after getting that grandmist aura.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and returned to the Wolfless Palace to cultivate.

Before that, Huang Xiaolong strengthened the Wolfless Palace’s defensive formation array.

The next couple of days passed peacefully.

Yang Jing did not come to disturb, which gave Huang Xiaolong some peace of mind.

Another several days passed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong was cultivating when, suddenly, his communication talisman shook. He quickly took it out and read the message—the message was from Tai Yue.

They had already found clues about the secret method of entering the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury—only the Old Ancestor Shi Ming and Patriarch Shi Wushuang, and Young Lord Shi Yinyu knew the method. However, Shi Yinyu had been cultivating inside the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s forbidden land in recent years, thus he had not been venturing out. The Netherworld King’s Organisation had yet to find an opportunity to interrogate the secret method from Shi Yinyu’s mouth.

There was another news in the message.

In another month, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe would open the Gate of Nine Yin and enter the Corpse Soul Land. At that time, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, Patriarch Shi Wushuang, and Young Lord Shi Yinyu, as well as the many Ancestors, Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and even Elders would enter the Corpse Soul Land to cultivate and train.

The Gate of Nine Yin’s Corpse Soul Land was a unique space, treated as one the Nine Yin Giant Tribe’s important locations, and they rarely opened it. This time, opening the Gate of Nine Yin was likely related to the grandmist weapon Shi Ming, Peng Zhengfei, and others were forging.

Tai Yue’s message also mentioned Shi Ming and Peng Zhengfei’s group most likely wanted to borrow the corpse soul energy within the Corpse Soul Land to complete the grandmist treasure forging.

“The Gate of Nine Yin, Soul Corpse Land.” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath.

This time, in order to open the Gate of Nine Yin, Shi Ming would definitely leave the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters. To Huang Xiaolong, this was a heaven-sent opportunity.

However, to open the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe’s treasury, he still needed the secret method of opening the treasury to enter. He couldn’t get the secret method from Shi Ming or Shi Wushuang’s mouth, thus the only choice left was Shi Yinyu.

However, Shi Yinyu had been cultivating within the forbidden land. It went without saying that the experts would strictly guard the forbidden land. Sneaking in had a high risk of being found out.

What should he do now?
