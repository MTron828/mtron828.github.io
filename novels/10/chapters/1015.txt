Had it been one month prior, Zhao Chenyuan’s suspicion would not have fallen on Huang Xiaolong, but some time back, the news of Huang Xiaolong having a king rank godhead had spread. Whilst the news shocked the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect, many sides began paying attention to him.

Subsequently, the news of Huang Xiaolong injuring Chen Xiong also leaked out.

This also came as a shock to Zhao Chenyuan. At the same time, he found out that Huang Xiaolong was at the island as well when his disciple Han Yang was killed on Volcano Isle, which was the beginning of Zhao Chenyuan’s suspicion.

“Master, what if that Huang Xiaolong truly is the killer?” Chen Wenyuan asked.

A sharp glint exploded in Zhao Chenyuan’s eyes, “If it really was that Huang Xiaolong who killed your Junior Brother, kill him! No matter who it was that killed this Zhao Chenyuan’s disciple, they should be buried together! Remember, make it clean, you must absolutely must not leave any clues for the Barbarian God Sect to find!” His expression grew grim speaking of this.

“Rest assured, Master.” Chen Wenyuan nodded in a dignified manner, he understood the gravity of the matter.

If Huang Xiaolong was killed and the Barbarian God Sect found out it was related to their Elephant Genesis Sect, they would definitely try their best to draw blood from them. Not to mention the Barbarian God Sect, even their Elephant Genesis Sect or the Great Whale Sect would go crazy after losing genius with a king rank godhead.

Zhao Chenyuan subsequently reminded Chen Wenyuan about other things he should pay attention to.

Chen Wenyuan respectfully complied and left the hall, hurrying off to the Blood Phoenix Forest.

Although Huang Xiaolong’s talent and growth were alarming, Zhao Chenyuan has full confidence toward his disciple. With Chen Wenyuan’s Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm strength, dealing with Huang Xiaolong would be as easy as snapping his fingers.

On a certain mountain peak on the periphery of Blood Phoenix Forest, Huang Xiaolong’s punch sent a Third Order Heavenly God Realm Shadow Leopard flying before arriving above it in a flicker, sending out another punch. The Shadow Leopard slammed into the earth, causing the ground to split open.

Huang Xiaolong formed a blade with godforce and killed the Shadow Leopard with a slash, removing its godhead.

This was the eighth day since he entered the Blood Phoenix Forest.

After arriving here, Huang Xiaolong’s main prey were Third Order Heavenly God Realm demonic beasts.

In eight days’ time, the number of Third Order Heavenly God Realm demonic beasts that died in his hands reached at least a hundred.

He had just finished dealing with that Shadow Leopard when the Godly Mt. Xumi suddenly shook.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised, taking it out to see.

The Godly Mt. Xumi was shining in bright golden light, even releasing ripples of lightning.

‘This is...?!’ Huang Xiaolong quickly discovered that the ripples came from the lightning beast egg inside the Godly Mt. Xumi.

The lightning beast egg was glimmering with flashes of lightning as cracks emerged on the shell, spreading all over its surface.

Crack! The phenomenon went on for half an hour before the lightning beast egg finally cracked and a demonic beast drilled out from it.

However, its appearance surprised Huang Xiaolong so much that his mouth was agape.

“A cow...?!”

This lightning beast egg actually gave birth to a little cow with two golden horns and a green body! Its size was similar to the newborn calf on Earth.

What kind of lightning beast was this? Huang Xiaolong was completely speechless.

He had read through quite a lot of books in the Barbarian God Sect’s library describing the various kinds of demonic beasts of the Divine World, but he really couldn’t recognize what kind of demonic beast this green cow with two golden horns was.

At this time, that little cow was gradually swallowing its shell. A circle of lightning was rippling around its body. A few minutes later, the little cow shook its butt and head as it approached, looking intimately at Huang Xiaolong as it stood before him.

“Moo!” It called out cutely.

Huang Xiaolong was once again speechless. Judging from the little cow’s demeanor, it took him as its mother? As this thought crossed his mind, goosebumps ran down his spine.

Fortunately, this little cow didn’t drink milk.

At this time, the little cow’s eyes were staring at the Shadow Leopard godhead in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, moo-ing at him.

“You want this?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow nodded, its spirited eyes somehow looked pitiful.

Huang Xiaolong gave the godhead to the little cow.

The golden horned little cow’s eyes brightened, swallowing the godhead in one go and crunching it. A few seconds later, it licked its mouth, just like someone who had eaten something delicious. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Huang Xiaolong was astounded. This reminded him of the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey, Huang Xiaoyong. Could this golden horned little cow absorb the godforce within the godheads to improve its strength?

At this time, the little cow raised its head, looking pitifully at Huang Xiaolong again. That expression was exactly like a little child who was hungry.

Huang Xiaolong let out a wry laugh as he took out another godhead from his Submerging Dragon Ring.

In the blink of an eye, the little cow chewed another godhead, then raised its head at Huang Xiaolong again.

He took out another godhead.

Huang Xiaolong took out a total of fifteen godheads between Second Order and Third Order Heavenly God Realm before the golden horned little cow rubbed its belly with its front hoof, burping loudly.

Huang Xiaolong flicked the sweat off his forehead.

‘Sissy fudges, if this little one eats so much every day, I’m going to be eaten poor soon.’

Fortunately, there were quite a lot of godheads inside his Submerging Dragon Ring, otherwise he probably couldn’t even feed the little one more than a few days.

Ten days passed by.

In these ten days, Huang Xiaolong made his way through the forest while killing demonic beasts, and every time Huang Xiaolong was fighting a demonic beast, the golden horns little cow would watch and yawn at the side. Only after Huang Xiaolong killed the demonic beast he was fighting would it come up with a flattering expression, its purpose clearly written on its face.

Huang Xiaolong felt slightly depressed.

In these ten days, he could already surmise that this little one was a lazy glutton. The godheads he got from killing demonic beasts over the last ten days all entered this little one’s stomach. Huang Xiaolong had become its free labor.

A few days ago, Huang Xiaolong noticed there was nothing hanging from the little one’s lower part, moreover, due to the similar syllables of their names, Huang Xiaolong named it ‘Xiaoniū’. [1]

“I say Xiaoniū, what kind of divine beast are you exactly? Is there a divine beast that can eat like you in this world?” Huang Xiaolong handed it the godhead obtained from the demonic beast he just killed, complaining.

However, replying Huang Xiaolong was a sound of “Moo!”

“Other than moo, what else do you know?” Huang Xiaolong complained.

“Moo!”

“If you moo again, I’ll butcher you and make some roast meat!”

“Moo moo!”

Huang Xiaolong stopped talking. In these ten days, other than ‘moo’, this little one did not issue other sounds.

In general, a divine beast could only speak the human language after reaching the Heavenly God Realm. Until then, Huang Xiaolong could only put up with the little one’s moo-ing.

This little cow could really eat. In the first three days, it ate fifteen godheads per day, but from the fourth day onwards, the number increased to sixteen godheads and above before it was full. As a result of its eating capability, the little one grew a circle in size almost every day, in a short ten days, it had grown more than ten circles bigger!

At this rate, in two months, this little cow would reach the size of a mature cow on Earth.

What baffled Huang Xiaolong though, was the fact that he actually couldn’t see its strength or cultivation. Moreover, inside the little cow’s body was a type of energy that gave Huang Xiaolong palpitations.
