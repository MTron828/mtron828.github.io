Chapter 3093: How Dare You Stop Me?!

The senior commander who just spoke up was Jiang Meng’s confidant, and his position in the World Master’s Manor was extremely high. It was no wonder he was unhappy with Huang Xiaolong. After all, no one dared to make them wait if they wanted to meet them!

Moreover, Marshal Jiang Meng had made a personal appearance to meet the kid!

He was a Marshal of an entire world!

His status spoke for itself.

According to the senior commander, it was Huang Xiaolong’s honor to meet with Marshal Jiang Meng!

Even the patriarchs of the super creeds wouldn’t dare to slight the marshal!

When the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable heard what the senior commander said, an icy light appeared in his eyes. “Commander, you had better watch your words. You’re in no position to talk about His Highness. If you’re not willing to wait, the door is right there. His Highness isn’t the one requesting an audience with you.”

Jiang Meng and the others were taken aback as they stared at the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable.

In the past, they had done their investigation on Huang Xiaolong and the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce. They had realized that their relationship ran pretty deep, but they didn’t know the specifics. They were shocked when they heard how the old man addressed Huang Xiaolong. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There were many ways they could interpret it, but no one would have thought that the old man would dare to antagonize them for a mere Huang Xiaolong!

Even though the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable was an expert who ranked in the top twenty, they were members of the World Master’s Manor. Even if he wanted to beat a dog, he had to see who its master was! In front of the World Master, he was just a commoner! They were officials chosen by the World Master to carry out their duties, and they should be more important than a mere Wind Cloud Dao Venerable!

There was no way a commoner could win in a battle against officials!

However, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable was willing to take the risk!

The commanders present were no longer able to hold themselves back when they heard what he said. Even Jiang Meng frowned. Senior Commander Qu, the person, who had spoken spoke initially, growled, “Are you sure you wish for us to leave?”

He might have been a little respectful to the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable if they had ran into each other outside. After all, the old man was ranked in the top twenties! However, Jiang Meng and many other commanders were there to back him up! There was nothing for him to be afraid of now.

Releasing his aura, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable smashed the table beside him into dust. “Do you think my Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce is a place you can come and take a shit as you please? Do you really wish to fight?”

His outburst quickly doused the fire in the hearts of the commanders. They found it hard to breathe and they quickly backed down.

The only person who managed to force out a laugh was Jiang Meng. “Wind Cloud President, we were just making a joke! Hahaha, Qu Jian made a tiny mistake. Let’s not get caught up in it.” He turned to Senior Commander Qu and chided, “Are you not going to apologize to the Wind Cloud President?”

No matter how angry Qu Jian was, he couldn’t defy Jiang Meng’s order. “Wind Cloud President, I apologize for offending you.”

However, his heart burned with anger despite his apology.

The Wind Cloud Dao Venerable merely glanced at Qu Jian, and he didn’t say anything in response.

Seeing as the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable was unwilling to accept the apology, Qu Jian’s expression sank.

How dare the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable not accept his apology?!

…

Despite his anger, he didn’t dare to do anything. The hall fell into silence as they waited for Huang Xiaolong’s arrival.

Half an hour passed and Huang Xiaolong was nowhere to be seen.

Jiang Meng’s expression slowly sank and a trace of anger formed in his heart.

Even patriarchs from the top five creeds wouldn’t make him wait for more than half an hour!

When Jiang Meng’s face turned dark, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable got to his feet. Everyone turned to look at several figures walking towards them. It was precisely Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

“Your Highness!” Wind Cloud Dao Venerable greeted as he made a ninety degree bow.

Jiang Meng, who was still feeling extremely pissed off about Huang Xiaolong’s late arrival, nearly jumped in fright when he saw how respectful the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable was. He hesitated for a moment before getting to his feet.

The commanders stood up behind him, and they looked at Huang Xiaolong with a suspicious gaze.

Everyone in the Origin Holy World was guessing Huang Xiaolong’s identity, and there were even some who said that Huang Xiaolong was the Mystical Pavilion's young master!

Whatever it was, everyone knew that Huang Xiaolong had fourteen experts following behind him. All of them could wield peak-level energies, but something seemed off. There were fifteen of them now.

Jiang Meng and the others pondered over the identity of the final member, and their gaze landed on the old man with a massive build.

Could he also be someone who could wield absolute powers?

Jiang Meng broke the silence and started to introduce himself. “Are you Huang Xiaolong? I am Jiang Meng of the World Master’s Manor.”

“What do you want?” Huang Xiaolong got straight to the point. In fact, he didn’t even dismount from Lei Yu when he spoke to the man!

The commanders behind Jiang Meng were irritated by Huang Xiaolong to begin with, and now that he showed such disrespect, they exploded.

Even the Prince of the Destiny Race would have to show some respect to Marshal Jiang Meng!

“Huang Xiaolong, you’ve gone too far!” Qu Jian took the lead, and he started spewing curses at Huang Xiaolong. “How dare you show such nonchalance when you meet Marshal Jiang Meng?! You’re a disrespectful b*stard!”

“Disrespect? You’re just members of the World Master’s Manor. I’m showing you enough respect by granting you an audience.”

The commanders raged the moment the words left his mouth.

However, Huang Xiaolong continued before they could speak. “I hate it when people point and curse at me. If you’re smart, you will put your finger down right now. Get to your knees and apologize, and I’ll forget everything.” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Qu Jian roared with laughter in response. “Kneel and apologize?! Haha! Who do you think you are? Are you going to break my fingers if I refuse?”

He didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to do something like that.

However, a flash of light filled the room and his entire arm dropped onto the ground. Blood sprayed from his wound and stained his surroundings red.

Screaming in pain, Qu Jian held his wound. He glared at the Old Monster Flame as the skinny old man was the one who had made the move.

Jiang Meng wanted to stop both parties from making a move, but he was a step too late. No one would have thought that Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate would sever Qu Jian’s arm without warning. He didn’t bother going for the fingers. Instead, he took off the other party’s arm!

“How dare you?!” Jiang Meng roared in rage, and he sent a punch flying towards the Old Monster Flame.

As an existence who ranked in the top forties of the Extermination List, he wielded shocking strength. The Old Monster Flame might have reached the large completion stage in the power of absolute flame, but he was still a little weaker than the marshal from the World Master’s Manor.

However, a palm appeared to stop Jiang Meng’s fist.

A loud blast filled the skies as the hall they were in vaporized. Jiang Meng retreated and shattered god knew how many walls in his path before stopping.

When he finally stabilized himself, he glared at the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable and growled, “How dare you stop me?!”
