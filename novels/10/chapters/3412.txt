Chapter 3413: Pangu Immortal Cave

When he heard that they were finally located, Huang Xiaolong felt a rush of adrenalin. However, he was taken aback when he heard that they were going towards the same place.

“The two of them were headed to the same place?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Yes, Your Highness.” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor replied. “They seem to have headed into the Devil Forest!”

“Oh? What’s the Devil Forest?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“The Devil Forest isn’t in the Devil World. It’s located right outside the Devil World, and you’ll arrive at the entrance to the Ghost World after you cross the forest.” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor explained. “The forest has been in existence since the start of time.”

“A primal existence…” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback. “Wouldn’t that mean that the forest existed long before the Pangu World?!”

“Yes.” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor replied. “It was said that Lord Pangu cultivated in the Devil Forest for quite some time. After he received enlightenment and created the Pangu World, he didn’t destroy the forest because of its meaning to him. As such, the experts of our Devil World and the Netherworld would enter the Devil Forest from time to time in order to look for Lord Pangu’s cultivation cave…”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by the news. After all, he didn’t expect for the Devil Forest to hold such significance to Pangu.

“Dao Ancestor Hong Jun and the six sages entered the forest in the past. From what I can guess, the Heaven Piercing Sage and the Heavenless Devil Ancestor entered the forest because they received some news on Pangu’s Immortal Cave!”

After all, the timing was too damn coincidental!

“That might be possible.” Huang Xiaolong nodded and sighed, “Get ready. We’re going there too.”

“Yes, Your Highness!” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor bowed respectfully.

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong and the others left the city. They turned into streaks of light as they disappeared into the horizon.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bring too many people with him. Apart from Sun Wukong, Ying Gou, and the Holy Phoenix, he only brought the Yin Yang Devil Ancestor along with him.

As the devil ancestor could be considered the owner of half the Devil World, he was extremely familiar with the area. It would be much more convenient to bring him along.

Under his lead, they arrived at the entrance of the Devil Forest in several short days.

“Your Highness, that’s Devil Forest.” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor introduced.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the place he referred to, he was greeted with an endless space filled with stars twinkling all around. There were giant trees lining the forest, and they emitted dense spiritual energy.

The place they called the Devil Forest wasn’t filled with the slightest trace of soil!

The trees took root in the depths of the space all around, and they managed to live for countless years!

Even though Huang Xiaolong was someone who had seen a lot, he was shocked when he discovered the intricacies of Devil Forest.

“Daddy Sun here has long since heard of the Devil Forest. Looks like everything they say is true!” Sun Wukong gasped in shock. It was his first time coming to the Devil Forest.

“It’s no wonder Pangu kept this place even after creating his world.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “If I were him, I wouldn’t destroy it either.”

After pausing for a second to admire the magical Devil Forest, the group entered.

Even though the Devil Forest was named as such, there wasn’t a slightest trace of devil qi in the area. The spiritual qi in the air caused those who entered to feel extremely comfortable.

“This place is really suited for cultivation…” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Your Highness is right. The experts of the Devil World and the Netherworld usually enter seclusion here.” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor explained. “I cultivated here in the past.”

“However, there are too many weird beasts here. Many of them have existed since the creation of the world, and their descendants possess extraordinary strength. All of them hate outsiders, and they will usually hunt down the experts who don’t belong here.”

“Even though this place is extremely suited for cultivation, not too many people dare to do so for a long period of time.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

They were no different as they were assaulted by a group of beasts the moment they entered.

Of course, the Monkey King was more than enough to deal with the beasts who roamed the outskirts of the Devil Forest.

He sent them flying with a single punch, but to his surprise, they came running back without much care for their wounds.

“They are really not afraid of death!” After several rounds, Sun Wukong was enraged and he smashed them to bits with his Golden Rod.

“The beasts in the Devil Forest are as such. All of them won’t stop till their opponents are dead. The only way for you to get rid of them is to kill them off.” The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor sighed. “They seem to be under a curse of some sort…”

“You’re right. They have been cursed.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “There is a strange energy in their bodies that causes them to behave irrationally.” Others might not be able to detect the abnormality in their bodies, but they couldn’t hide from Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls.

The Yin Yang Devil Ancestor was stunned. There were countless rumors going around that the beasts in the Devil Forest were cursed, but no one could be sure of it. Now, Huang Xiaolong was clearing up his doubts.

“Who will be crazy enough to curse the creatures of the forest? Why would they do something like that?” The Holy Phoenix sighed.

“Pangu probably did it himself. They might be protecting something in the forest!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled and he grinned.

Everyone stared at him in disbelief.

Pangu?!

“Your Highness, from what you say, the legends of the Pangu Immortal Cave will be true! Could they have been cursed to drive away intruders to the Pangu Immortal Cave?!”

“Damn!”

“Wouldn’t that mean that we will be able to find it?!”

Sun Wukong jumped in joy.

If they managed to discover the Pangu immortal Cave, they would win big!

Even a single bottle of pills there would be a priceless treasure!

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. The moment he found the immortal cave, he would be able to find the Heaven Piercing Sage and the Heavenless Devil Ancestor. After all, the two of them were probably there for the cave.

“How in the world are we supposed to start looking?!” The Holy Phoenix asked. “If it’s that easy, everyone should have found it a long time ago!”
