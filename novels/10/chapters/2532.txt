Chapter 2533: Joining Hands

“What?! The key to the seventh floor?!” Xie Bufan jumped in shock, and his gaze landed on the item in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

Since he had just obtained it, Huang Xiaolong didn’t have time to put it away.

“That’s right! I only managed to destroy the restriction protecting it after using up a lot of my strength! Huang Xiaolong attacked me from behind, causing severe injuries before taking the key for himself! He’s a sneaky b*stard!” Li Chen continued, “After killing him, we’ll open the seventh floor together and share whatever’s inside!”

Xie Bufan’s heart shook, and he chuckled, “Of course. As a person who upholds justice, I will never allow despicable brats to run rampant. We have to get rid of someone like Huang Xiaolong!”

He shot towards Huang Xiaolong after he spoke.

As a holy pill appeared in Li Chen’s palm, he swallowed it without hesitation.

“White Flower Holy Pill!” Xie Bufan’s eyes were extremely sharp, and he called out the name of the holy pill Li Chen ate instantly as shock flashed through his heart.

The White Flower Holy Pill was something the All Extinguishing Holy Emperor had refined in the past with countless precious herbs. It was exceptionally effective for healing wounds, and it was perfect for someone like Li Chen at his current level.

Seeing as Xie Bufan had already recognized the pill, Li Chen felt that there was no point hiding the dao artifact, and he summoned the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Dao artifact!” Xie Bufan’s eyes flashed once again.

Without a change in expression Li Chen ‘warned’ Xie Bufan, “Brother Bufan, you have to be careful! Huang Xiaolong isn’t as weak as we thought! He has three holy souls!”

“WHAT?! Three holy souls?!” Xie Bufan was stunned.

That was indeed something unthinkable.

It was the first time a single person had managed to form three holy souls!

Moreover, he wasn’t even in the True Saint Realm yet!

“That’s right!” Li Chen nodded seriously. He felt a trace of fear and shock in his heart, along with a smidge of envy when he mentioned Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls, “He also has the Opening Heaven Dragon Spear my master gave him! That’s not all. He has something that might be a dao artifact, and we have to work together to prevent him from escaping!”

That was what Li Chen was truly afraid of.

If Huang Xiaolong managed to escape and locate the seventh floor, all his hard work would be wasted.

Xie Bufan’s expression sank when he heard that Huang Xiaolong had the Heaven Opening Dragon Spear and another suspected dao artifact. Just a moment ago, he had felt that with the dao artifact given to him by the Devil Palace, he would be able to suppress Huang Xiaolong singlehandedly. However, it seemed as though he was too hasty.

When he looked at Huang Xiaolong again, it was as though there was an invisible pressure pressing down on him.

Of course, it came from Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls.

It seemed as though Li Chen was a deceptive little b*stard. With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he would be able to kill Li Chen with a sneak attack if he attacked with all he had. Xie Bufan instantly called the bluff as he realized that Li Chen was injured after an intense battle with the other party.

After a slight hesitation, he still summoned the Fiend Moon Blade.

As soon as it appeared, sharp rays of light pierced through the skies.

The might of a Primal Ancestor started to spread out as the devil qi rolled about.

With the blade in hand, Xie Bufan seemed to have turned into a devil king.

“Fiend Moon Blade!” Li Chen was shocked. He didn’t think that Xie Bufan would be holding onto the treasured Fiend Moon Blade of the Devil Palace.

There were different grades when it came to dao artifacts, and the Fiend Moon Blade was the strongest Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact the Devil Palace had to offer. It was several times stronger than his Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring.

When the All Extinguishing Holy Emperor had obtained the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring in the past, he had failed to fully refine it as he lacked a Dao Heart. He wasn’t able to continue refining the ring, and it was stuck at its original level. On the other hand, Fiend Moon Blade was different. Qiao Jinyang was a Primal Ancestor, and he had used all he had to refine the blade. Who would have thought that he would allow Xie Bufan to bring the Fiend Moon Blade into the Cangqiong Holy Manor…

Huang Xiaolong stared at the blade and felt a trace of surprise. It seemed as though the Devil Palace would stop at nothing to kill him.

However, a sneer soon formed on his face. The Devil Palace was bound to be disappointed. No one would have thought that Huang Xiaolong had an Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

If they knew, Qiao Jinyang wouldn’t have been delusional enough to lend Xie Bufan the Fiend Moon Blade.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong knew that he couldn’t be careless when dealing with the two of them.

Upon glancing at each other, Li Chen and Xie Bufan came to an understanding immediately. Soaring to the skies, they sent the two weapons out in unison.

Pincering Huang Xiaolong, Li Chen attacked Huang Xiaolong’s head while Xie Bufan went for the lower body.

Eight Eight Horned Desolate Beasts emerged from the ring as a torrent of blades shot out from the Fiend Moon Blade.

“Huang Xiaolong, die!” Li Chen roared.

After swallowing the White Flower Holy Pill, his injuries were fully healed. Moreover, his combat strength had risen to another level.

Seeing as they were attacking him together, Huang Xiaolong snorted coldly as he activated all three holy souls. With the Opening Dragon Spear and the Flying Heaven Blood Stele, Huang Xiaolong attacked.

Boom!

With the power to smash and overturn the heavens, the three of them exchanged several tens of blows in mid air.

Li Chen and Xie Bufan used their high-grade holy arts to their maximum power, but they were unable to do a thing to Huang Xiaolong. Instead, they were forced to retreat time after time.

The looks on their faces were extremely ugly. Initially, they tried overestimating Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess. However, it seemed as though they were still wrong.

After several dozen more rounds, the three of them stopped. Li Chen and Xie Bufan cut an extremely sorry figure.

A weird light emerged from Li Chen’s body suddenly, and a string of weird runes charged into the skies.

The runes seemed to be human, but they started to transform into other living beings in the next instant.

“Myriad Creations Saint Godhead!” Huang Xiaolong and Xie Bufan yelled in unison.

The Myriad Creations Saint Godhead was ranked fifth in the Holy World, and it was a heaven-defying existence.

In the past, Su Baili had revealed his godhead that ranked in the top ten, but it paled in comparison to the Myriad Creations Saint Godhead.

“That’s right!” a smile formed on Li Chen’s face.

No one would be humble if they possessed the fifth ranked godhead.

Seeming as Li Chen was planning to risk it all, Xie Bufan no longer held back. He activated his Undead Heart, and boundless death qi filled the area.
