“Xiaoniu, you’ve been here before, so you lead the way.” Huang Xiaolong said as he leaped onto the little cow’s back. “Head to the Royal Buddha World first!”

The Royal Buddha Great Worlds consisted of tens of thousands of world surfaces. Each world surface was bigger than the Vientiane World, therefore, it was difficult to predict the amount of time that Huang Xiaolong would need to visit all of them, if he decided to do so.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong decided to first head to the biggest world surface located at the center of the Royal Buddha Great Worlds—the Royal Buddha World!

According to the little cow, the auction houses in the Royal Buddha World would normally auction God King’s Buddha Pellet.

At Huang Xiaolong’s order, the little cow sped forward with Huang Xiaolong on her back, and flew towards the Royal Buddha World. Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest followed behind them.

Even though they had entered the Royal Buddha Great Worlds’ territories, it was still going to take them a month’s time to reach the Royal Buddha World.

Using the Giant Shark Flying Ship would have saved them time, but Huang Xiaolong chose to fly instead, as the flying ship would have attracted unwanted attention and they were going to get delayed by only one month, which was not too much of a significant delay according to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong could also cultivate and continue condensing some mid grade-eight spirit stones along the way as they traveled.

The group had flown for six days when Huang Xiaolong said, “Xiaoniu, stop at the world surface in front of us. We will rest for a day then continue our journey tomorrow.” Huang Xiaolong pointed at a world surface up ahead.

“Alright.” The little cow replied.

Two hours later, the group descended upon one of the mainlands of the world surface and entered one of its cities.

The city wasn’t big but it looked heavily populated, moreover, the features of the people in this city were slightly odd. Huang Xiaolong could see quite a few beastmen and half-beastmen in this city.

Since ascending to the Divine World, this was his first time coming across beastmen and half-beastmen.

These beastmen and half-beastmen reminded Huang Xiaolong of the lower realm’s, like the Ten Directions Mainland in the Martial Spirit World. He had once been the Lord Beast God of the Ten Directions Mainland’s beastmen tribes and Elf Tribes.

But that seemed like a very distant time from his past.

Subconsciously, his thoughts wandered back to his family in the lower realm, and of course, Shi Xiaofei.

“They are all offspring of the Heavenly Beast Clan.” The little cow added as she saw that Huang Xiaolong was curiously looking at the beastmen and half-beastmen.

“The Heavenly Beast Clan?” Huang Xiaolong was somewhat surprised.

The little cow went on, “During the desolate era, the Heavenly Beast Clan was one of the most powerful and glorious clans. When the Ancient Heavenly Emperor was still around, the Heavenly Beast Clan’s Patriarch was the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s right hand man, who was extremely loyal and faithful. It’s a pity that not long after the Ancient Heavenly Emperor went missing, the Heavenly Beast Clan’s Patriarch also went missing. Soon after that, the Heavenly Beast Clan began to decline; several billion years have passed, almost bringing the Heavenly Beast Clan to its extinction. Although these beastmen and half-beastmen have the Heavenly Beast Clan’s bloodline, it’s thin and not very pure.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, Xu Shi, Feng Er, and the rest were surprised by the Heavenly Beast Clan’s story.

Huang Xiaolong sighed inwardly. No matter how strong and powerful a Clan is, it is not exempt from the merciless passage of time. Everything fades away, and the Heavenly Beast Clan as well as the Void Devil Beast Clan were an example of this.

However, Huang Xiaolong wondered if the Heavenly Beast Clan’s Patriarch had met his demise and gone missing at the hands of the current Heavenly Emperor.

The current Heavenly Emperor would have naturally targeted the Heavenly Beast Clan after getting rid of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, as they had been extremely faithful to the Ancient Heavenly Emperor.

...

Huang Xiaolong’s group continued to walk along the street.

The buildings along the streets were decorated with various stupas, Buddha statues, and other Buddhist items.

“Ei!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed softly when he spotted a group of disciples a short distance away, as they were clad in the robes of Fortune Gate’s disciples.

He hadn’t expected to run into Fortune Gate’s disciples here!

“Feel strange?” The little cow smirked and added, “In fact, there’s a Fortune Gate branch here in the Royal Buddha World named Royal Buddha Branch. This Royal Buddha Branch is among the top ten strongest Fortune Gate branches, and the branch building is located in this Royal Buddha World. This city is not that far from the Royal Buddha World surface, hence, it’s common to see the Fortune Gate’s disciples here.”

Huang Xiaolong was astonished—the Royal Buddha Branch!

Since the Fortune Gate had more than ten thousand branches all over the Divine World, one could imagine how strong the top ten branches were.

This group of Fortune Gate disciples was walking in Huang Xiaolong’s direction, but as Huang Xiaolong was not wearing his Fortune Gate’s disciple robe, he avoided attracting their attention.

These Fortune Gate’s disciples brushed past Huang Xiaolong’s group nonchalantly. However, their conversation stoked Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity.

“I didn’t expect the Thousand Autumns Buddha Sect’s Sect Chief’s luck to be so good that he actually found an ancient Buddhist sect’s treasures some days back!”

“Tsk, tsk, I would have become rich if I could have gotten that ancient Buddhist sect’s treasures. I’ve heard that the ancient Buddhist sect’s treasures have high God King Realm master’s Buddha Pellet, God King’s Buddha Paste, numerous high grade-seven spirit stones, a number of grade-eight spirit stones, and loads of ancient Buddhist sect’s high-grade and top-grade chaos spiritual pills.”

“That’s right ah! In a few months, the Royal Buddha World is holding a big auction. It’s said the Thousand Autumns Buddha Sect Chief is planning to auction several high-level God King Realm masters’ Buddha Pellet at that time!”

“Really?!”

“I’m afraid it’s true, however, even if he takes it out to auction, it’s got nothing to do with us. Can you afford it? Don’t daydream about these items.”

“Junior Brother Tao Yuan, I’ve heard that your Master is entertaining an important guest since the last few days?”

“They are the people from another branch called Blue Emperyean-something. He is an old friend of my Master. He is visiting with his disciple, but I don’t know the reason behind their visit.”

The little cow watched as the group of the Fortune Gate’s disciples walked away, and then she turned to wink at Huang Xiaolong, “Looks like we’ve come at the right time... Li Lu’s God King’s Buddha Pellet is waiting for us.”

Huang Xiaolong grinned boyishly, as he was obviously in a good mood.

Although a God King’s Buddha Pellet was going to be auctioned in the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, it usually did not appear every year. Sometimes, it only appeared once in a decade. So, Huang Xiaolong had really come at the right time.

However, Huang Xiaolong had fallen into contemplation after hearing the name of the ‘Blue Empyrean’ being mentioned by the Fortune Gate’s disciples. Could it be the Vientiane Branch’s Blue Empyrean Ancestor? Had Blue Empyrean and Wang Wei come to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds?

More than a decade ago, Wang Wei had left the Vientiane World for unknown reasons. Since then, he had not returned to the Vientiane World, and now, what were he and his Master Blue Empyrean doing here in the Royal Buddha Great Worlds?

“I wonder what’s Wang Wei’s cultivation right now.” Huang Xiaolong mumbled to himself.

Even though he didn’t hold much of a grudge against Wang Wei, he had never had a good impression of Wang Wei. Wang Wei was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and a character nastier than Zhu Feng.

“Xiaolong, since we’ve found Li Lu’s Buddha Pellet, should we go eat meat and drink wine now?” The little cow smiled widely. “The Buddha Wine and Buddhist beast meat here are a delicacy!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed. “You know nothing but eating!”

“Let’s go, eat meat and drink wine! But, Xiaoniu, how do you know there’s Buddha Wine and Buddhist beast meat here? You’ve been here before?”

“There was a time when I used to be idle, and ventured out in the Divine World, Hell, Buddha World, and Demon World. This cow has left prints in a lot of big worlds.”

“In the past, I had also entered the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s treasury, and even left a few hairs inside it as memorabilia.”
