Even though Huang Xiaolong was only a late-Tenth Order God Realm, his speed in refining spirit pellets and absorbing spiritual energy was faster than any late-First Order Highgod Realm master.

Thus, he estimated that he wouldn’t take long to refine Jia Xiangtian’s rank four godhead. At least, it wouldn’t take as much time as it did when he was a Seventh Order God Realm refining the rank five godhead.

The passage of time flowed, three days came and went.

Wuhuang Peak, Black Warrior Institute.

Sitting on the main throne-like seat in the main hall, Wang Na was looking dark and gloomy. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“The Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian still haven’t sent back any message?” Wang Na was obviously in a dark mood as she questioned the Black Warrior Institute Grand Elder Zhang Yijia who was standing some distance from her.

Zhang Yijia shook his head with a solemn expression, “Not yet.” He hesitated before adding, “Vice-Principal, could the Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian have swallowed both the Hailstone and Xuanji Treasures, and thus, they didn’t initiate any contact with Vice-Principal after killing Huang Xiaolong?”

A trace of doubt flashed past Wang Na’s gloomy face, but she shook head, denying, “Not likely.”

Considering Wang Na’s reply, Zhang Yingjia said, “If that is not the case, why haven’t they sent any reply? It has been three days. Did they perhaps fail to kill Huang Xiaolong?”

“Failed to kill Huang Xiaolong?” Wang Na was nonplussed. This possibility never crossed her mind.

However, being said out in the open now, Wang Na’s doubts were roused. Maybe the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi didn’t really leave Martial Spirit World and that was why the Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian failed their task?

Right at this time, a cold harrumph echoed in the hall.

At the sound of this cold harrumph, Wang Na who was sitting on the main seat fell down to her knees, her tone filled with respect: Wang Na greets the Great Lord!”

Black Warrior Institute Grand Elder Zhang Yingjia also fell to his knees, trembling from head to toe.

“The Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian are dead.” The voice sounded again, cold, abstract, yet holding inviolable authority and pressure.

Wang Na’s head jerked up in disbelief, “The Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian are dead?!”

“Yes.” The intangible voice sounded. Only the voice could be heard, not a shadow or inclination of its owner.

“Great Lord, is it true that the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi really didn’t leave Martial Spirit World?” Wang Na couldn’t resist asking.

All of a sudden, a vast force surged out from the void. Before this vast power force, even Wang Na dared not have the slightest thought of resisting as she was blasted into the air, together with the throne seat behind her.

Watching this, Grand Elder Zhang Yingjia curled deeper, like he wished to make himself smaller.

Wang Na quickly struggled up and on her knees again, not a groan of pain came from her as she spoke with caution: “Please give your order, Great Lord.”

“The Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian’s cause of death, investigate it in detail! Also, find out if Huang Xiaolong’s side has other Highgod Realm masters other than the Ascending Moon Old Man and Yang Yi!”

Other Highgod Realm masters? Wang Na was dumbfounded, but she quickly answered, “Yes, Great Lord!”

After a short ‘En’, the voice disappeared and the hall returned to silence.

It was a long time later when Wang Na gradually stood up, her face dark with thoughts.

“You heard what the Great Lord said just now.” Wang Na looked at Grand Elder Zhang Yingjia, her voice chilling, “Immediately go find out how the Golden Horned Beast King and Jia Xiangtian died! You know what the repercussions are if you fail!”

A cold shiver ran down Grand Elder Zhang Yingjia’s back and he quickly answered: “Yes, Vice Principal!”

The person inside the Godly Mt. Xumi, who was refining Jia Xiangtian’s rank four godhead, was oblivious to this.

Sitting cross-legged inside the Xumi Temple, Huang Xiaolong’s body was cocooned by swirling dragon qi.

Both the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires’ spirits were hovering around him as the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Galaxies’ star force rushed down like a waterfall from the void, into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Jia Xiangtian’s rank four godhead was hovering in front of Huang Xiaolong. Godforce and God’s Law were floating out, entering his body together with the star force from the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Galaxies.

The Treasure Dragon diagram glimmered brightly inside his body, absorbing the three different kinds of forces at a crazy speed, as well as the godforce and God’s Law.

Unknowingly, a year passed.

One year later, the godforce and God’s Law contained inside that rank four godhead were completely absorbed by Huang Xiaolong. The godhead turned into gray ash, disintegrated and disappeared from this world.

Another three days passed before Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, waking up.

After opening his eyes, Huang Xiaolong immediately checked his overall condition, but the result was disappointing.

Although Jia Xiangtian’s rank four godhead did help his strength increase a little, it wasn’t enough to push his cultivation to peak late-Tenth Order God Realm. However, the number of space and time threads in his soul sea multiplied, reaching a significant number, and his True Dragon Physique became that much stronger.

“I wonder how much I’ll improve after refining the other parts of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s body.” Huang Xiaolong muttered his thoughts under his breath.

Now, it was time to search for the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s other sealed body parts.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong exited the Godly Mt. Xumi.

Out from the Godly Mt. Xumi, he summoned the Phoenix Clan Ancestor and the others, asking about the events of the past year.

During the time when Huang Xiaolong was in seclusion, nothing out of ordinary happened in the Huang Clan Manor or Martial Spirit World. Neither the demonic beasts clan nor the people from the Azure Dragon Institute appeared.

Also, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, the Peng brothers, and the Nine-Tailed White Fox had completed the task Huang Xiaolong gave them before he entered seclusion; arranging small scale Spirit Amplifying Arrays in all royal cities and a relatively bigger array in imperial cities.

On the other hand, the Huang Clan Manor had expanded twice its previous size.

Hearing these reports, Huang Xiaolong nodded in satisfaction.

But, two days later, just as Huang Xiaolong was about to leave in search for the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s other sealed body parts, two unexpected guests appeared at his door.

“Senior Apprentice-brother, Third Apprentice-sister!” Seeing them, Huang Xiaolong greeted in surprise.

“Haha, Junior Apprentice-brother!” Liu Yun was extremely happy seeing Huang Xiaolong, laughing heartily as he patted Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder.

“Junior Apprentice-brother!” Qi Wen also greeted with a wide smile on her face.

“Senior Apprentice-brother, Third Apprentice-sister, it has been a long time. What brings you here?” Huang Xiaolong asked. These years, both Liu Yun and Qi Wen had been focusing on their cultivation in preparation for the upcoming Highgod Advancement Tournament.

Liu Yun smiled, “What, we can’t come here to see our Junior Apprentice-brother without a purpose? You, already returned to Martial Spirit World for so long, yet you didn’t even come back to the Black Warrior Institute to visit me and your Third Apprentice-sister.”

Huang Xiaolong tried to cover his embarrassment with a smile.

These years, if he wasn’t in seclusion, he was searching for the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire and the Black Tortoise Divine Fire. He really didn’t have time to return to the Black Warrior Institute.

“But, coming over this time, we do have something to tell you.” Liu Yun grinned, “Master has left his seclusion and wants you to return to the institute, he has something to tell you.”

“Master is out from seclusion.” Huang Xiaolong was dazed. But he had no idea what his Master wanted to speak to him about.
