Heavenly Emperor Di Jun was inwardly taken aback. Not Shi Ming?

But Heavenly Prince Di Jing was extremely confident, “King of Grandmist Old Man’s strength is indeed amazing, but he could only rank within the top ten in the vast universe.”

Heavenly Prince Di Jun nodded his head, “It is said the Devil World’s Dragon Bear Race’s Cang Mutian has appeared again, and Cang Mutian’s strength is no less than the King of Grandmist. Then again, these old monsters will not take action easily. It will be difficult to invite them to deal with the King of Grandmist, ah.”

But Heavenly Prince Di Jing laughed and said, “Rest assured, Imperial Father. When the time comes, follow me to a place. That old monster surely will agree to come out.”

Seeing his confident son, Heavenly Prince Di Jun, was genuinely baffled. He could not guess who Di Jing was talking about...

“Imperial Father, let’s go back to the Heavenly Court first and prepare a heavy gift. Then we’ll go see that old monster.” Heavenly Prince Di Jing mapped out his hands.

Two figures whistled away in the air shortly after.

Silence returned to the uninhabited planet as if the two people had never been there.

......

Roughly a month later, the Netherking Flying Ship stopped above a certain territory of the Divine World.

Huang Xiaolong put away the Netherking Flying Ship, and his attention fell onto the world surface in the distance up ahead. According to Bei Xiaomei, the Thunder Clan had been living in seclusion in that world surface up ahead.

Huang Xiaolong converged his presence and flew towards his target destination.

Recently, Huang Xiaolong had stabilized his newly broken through early First Order Emperor Realm cultivation and had become more familiar with employing the three devil steles’ power.

A dozen minutes later, Huang Xiaolong descended on a random mountain peak on the world surface.

His divine sense spread out in inquisition. When Huang Xiaolong determined the direction of the nearest city, he flew towards it immediately.

The way was smooth, and he did not come across any hindrance. Soon, Huang Xiaolong’s feet touched the ground some distance away from the city gates.

“Golden City.”

Standing in front of the city gates, Huang Xiaolong read the city’s name under his breath. He merely stopped briefly before lifting his foot and walked into the city.

This Golden City was more bustling than Huang Xiaolong had imagined. There were a lot of people moving around. In fact, there were quite a large number of disciples from other different Emperor Palaces. Huang Xiaolong even spotted a group of Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples!

Amid the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s battle, the Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi had fled to the Radiance World. After his escape, the Heavenly Court had sent out armies to attack the Brightness Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace.

However, the Heavenly Court had merely destroyed the five Emperor Palaces and had not completely slaughtered their disciples.

Not to mention, these five Emperor Palaces had over a trillion disciples. Even if the Heavenly Court had wanted to kill off every disciple of the five Emperor Palaces, it would have been a difficult feat. On top of that, it would have provoked public ire. Hence, the five Emperor Palaces’ remnant disciples could still be seen on various world surfaces in the Divine World.

Then again, most of these Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples had lost their arrogance and condescending behavior. Even when walking in the city, they were wary and full of vigilance.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t spare a second glance at these Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples and strolled along leisurely on his own.

“Hey brother, you’re also here for the Luring Lightning Clan’s celebration ceremony, right?” A young man and a woman were walking past Huang Xiaolong’s side when the man suddenly took the initiative to greet Huang Xiaolong.

“For the Luring Lightning Clan’s celebration ceremony?” Huang Xiaolong was bewildered by the question.

From the Silver Fox Commerce’s investigation, apart from living in seclusion, the Lightning Clan had changed their tribe’s name to the Luring Lightning Clan to escape the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s pursuit. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Brother didn’t come for the Luring Lightning Clan’s celebration ceremony?” The man asked after capturing Huang Xiaolong’s brief bewildered expression.

Huang Xiaolong smiled sheepishly as he replied, “I am just passing by this place.”

Huang Xiaolong then took the chance to ask the man questions about the Luring Lightning Clan’s celebration ceremony.

The guy easily spilled everything he knew to Huang Xiaolong.

After hearing the guy’s explanation, Huang Xiaolong was slightly surprised. It seemed like the Luring Lightning Clan’s Patriarch’s personal disciple, Chen Nan had broken through to the Emperor Realm a few days back. Thus the Luring Lightning Clan was holding this celebration ceremony and had invited the surrounding world surfaces’ forces.

Although the Luring Lightning Clan was said to live in seclusion, they had not cut off all contact with the outside world. Only the clan’s disciples rarely step out of this world surface.

“Since brother’s arrival coincides with this happy event, why don’t you come with us if you have nothing else to do?” The pair invited Huang Xiaolong familiarly.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement, “Alright.” Since he was planning to head to the Lightning Clan, Huang Xiaolong accepted the invitation.

As the three set off again, they began to talk. Huang Xiaolong learned that the guy and the woman were actually Hall Masters of the Azure Firmament Emperor Palace.

The Azure Firmament Emperor Palace’s headquarters was located nearby. In the Divine World, the Azure Firmament Emperor Palace ranked in the hundreds. Although this status was nothing in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, it was a status the Lightning Clan needed to ingratiate.

The guy was called Wu Yichun, and the woman’s name was Cui Yiting.

“Brother has an extraordinary bearing. May I ask which Emperor Palace’s disciple you might be?” Wu Yichun asked. Because he had noticed Huang Xiaolong’s extraordinary bearing, he had invited him along to get to know each other. Wu Yichun was a mid-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. Despite Huang Xiaolong’s bearing, he could not see through Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation.

“What Emperor Palace’s disciple could I be? I’m just a disciple of the Ele-lynx Clan.” Naturally, Wu Yichun’s intention did not escape Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he answered his question with a crude white-lie.

The Ele-lynx Clan was merely a top power amongst the Divine World’s first-rank forces. Although they were powerful in the eyes of first-rank forces, they were insignificant before other forces like the Azure Firmament Emperor Palace.

As expected, upon hearing that Huang Xiaolong was merely a disciple of the Ele-lynx Clan, the man immediately lost interest in getting to know Huang Xiaolong, and his attitude grew lukewarm. The conversation dwindled to a single syllable or no more than a few words. As for Cui Yiting, her demeanor was snobbier, and she didn’t spare Huang Xiaolong a glance even from the corner of her eye.

Huang Xiaolong did not mind the changes in their attitude at all.

......

Half a day later, the group of three finally arrived at the Lightning Clan’s headquarters, or more accurately, the Luring Lightning Clan’s headquarters.

“Hall Master Wu Yichun, this Senior is...?” A higher echelon of Lightning Clan inquired after exchanging greetings with Wu Yichun and Cui Yiting, as his attention fell on Huang Xiaolong.

This Lightning Clan’s higher echelon member was a late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, yet he too couldn’t see through Huang Xiaolong.

Wu Yichun answered, “This here is the Ele-lynx Clan’s Brother Huang. He was passing by and wanted to come to have a look. So I brought him with me.”

His attitude was neither endearing nor distant, neither cold nor warm. The Lightning Clan member and others instantly understood the relationship between the three of them. It was merely of a passerby stranger.

“I see. Brother Huang Xiaolong Ele-lynx Clan, thank you for coming today.” The Lightning Clan’s higher echelon member cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong and said smilingly. His attitude was considered polite, but a little distant compared to his warm friendliness towards Wu Yichun.

Huang Xiaolong merely nodded.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s response, the Lightning Clan’s higher echelon member frowned slightly in dissatisfaction, but his composure returned just as quickly as he invited the three people inside.

After passing the foyer, the Lightning Clan’s higher echelon member personally led Wu Yichun and Cui Yiting to the important guests’ seatings. In contrast, Huang Xiaolong was packed off to an ordinary core disciple’s seat in the outer hall.

In general, only guests from super forces would be seated in the inner hall. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong was arranged in the outer hall with the rest of the first-rank forces.

Seeing that he was arranged to sit at an obscure corner of the outer hall, Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly in the heart.
