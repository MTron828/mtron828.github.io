The Reverence Moon Old Man turned around and entered the Boundary Ancestral Mountain. As the restrictions around the mountain flashed, the Reverence Moon Old Man slipped through the barrier.

Huang Xiaolong and the young master of the Dragon World, Ao Ping, felt their jaws dropping in shock. When others attempted to barge into the Boundary Ancestral Mountain, they were sent flying by the restrictions around the mountain. However, nothing happened to the Reverence Moon Old Man!

“Brat, why are you standing there? Hurry up and come in!” The Reverence Moon Old Man pestered when he saw that Huang Xiaolong was standing rooted to his spot.

Huang Xiaolong snapped back to attention and hastily ran into the mountain range. Since he had already revived the spirit of the fourteen winged angel’s soul, the restrictions around the mountain wouldn’t be able to stop him. Huang Xiaolong could enter and leave as he pleased.

After entering the Boundary Ancestral Mountain with the Reverence Moon Old Man, the old man brought Huang Xiaolong to a palace on the mountain’s peak. A look of regret appeared on the old man’s face when he stood before the palace entrance. “In the blink of an eye, several hundreds of millions of years have passed... This old man is still alive and kicking, but you’re no longer here.”

He thought about the time when he had established the Reverence Moon Library alongside the Radiance Ancestor.

Huang Xiaolong stood at the side as he didn’t speak a word.

The old man only started walking into the palace after a full minute. When he entered, he saw the bare interior and chided, “Little brat, you really know how to sweep away treasures...”

Huang Xiaolong could only chuckle in response, “Ahem... since they were there collecting dust, there was no point leaving them there.”

The Reverence Moon Old Man roared with laughter. “Little brat, you really know what to say!” He walked over to one of the planets and sat down on a mountain peak along with Huang Xiaolong.

“You really resemble Ke Shun...” The Reverence Moon Old Man spoke all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. Ke Shun? Wasn’t the old man talking about the Radiance Ancestor? Was the Radiance Ancestor’s name Ke Shun?

“In the past, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and the Buddhist Ancestor had joined hands and fought against Ke Shun. I was in the Rotting World then, and I was held up by something. I failed to return immediately.” After the Reverence Moon Old Man recalled the past, a look of suffering flashed through his eyes. “If not for me insisting on barging into the Rotting World, I could have fought alongside Ke Shun! Nothing would have happened to him...”

Huang Xiaolong fell into silence for a moment before comforting the old man. “Senior Reverence Moon, there is no need to blame yourself. It isn’t your fault.”

The Reverence Moon Old Man shook his head, and a pained look appeared on his face. “I have been blaming myself my whole life. I owe your master too much... After returning from the Rotting world and receiving the news, I went to look for the Ancient Heavenly Emperor in a fit of rage.”

He had long realized that Huang Xiaolong was the Radiance Ancestor’s successor, and that would mean that Huang Xiaolong was the Radiance Ancestor’s disciple. That was also why the Reverence Moon Old Man had made a move against Bai Hui, Bin Ge, and the others.

Huang Xiaolong felt his chest tighten. “What happened next?”

“After that, I beat the Ancient Heavenly Emperor up so much that his mother wouldn’t recognize him.” The old man smiled, and his pearly white teeth shined as a childish expression appeared on his face.

Cold sweat dripped down Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

He was really too awesome! Didn’t his master, the King of Grandmist, say that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor ranked in the top ten superpowers in the myriad of worlds?

What about the Reverence Moon Old Man?

“It’s too bad the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had the top-grade grandmist artifact, the Ancient Heavenly Court, to assist him. I wasn’t able to kill him.” A look of regret appeared on his face as he continued, “When the Buddhist Ancestor learned that I beat up the Ancient Heavenly Emperor to the point where no one would recognize him, he ran away to the Godly Mt. Xumi. He hid in it like a turtle. After standing outside the Godly Mt. Xumi for a hundred million years, I decided to leave.”

Huang Xiaolong stared at the old man in shock.

He could have never expected there to be such juicy news.

“After that, I came back to the Reverence Moon Academy before entering seclusion. All these years, I remained in the Rotting World. In order to vent out the frustration in my heart, I killed rotting corpses day and night!”

“Rotting World?” Huang Xiaolong felt a little curious.

The Reverence Moon Old Man explained, “The Rotting World is just one of the countless worlds that exist. There is a space tunnel that leads directly into it. Even though the Rotting World isn’t part of the five Greater Worlds, it can be classified as the most dangerous and mysterious world. Rotting corpses have formed countless mysterious and weird races. They are extremely terrifying...! In the past, I had learned of the birth of an unparalleled treasure in the depths of the Rotting World. Due to which I had barged into its depths. After that...” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Reverence Moon Old Man sank into silence. What came after was naturally the events that played out in the Radiance World.

“It’s the most dangerous and most mysterious world!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock.

The old man glanced at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye and chuckled. “What? Are you planning on going in there to take a look? You’re too weak right now. Wait till you break through to the Sovereign Realm. We’ll work together and wreak havoc in their Corpse Pool.”

Seemingly afraid that Huang Xiaolong would misunderstand, he explained, “The Corpse Pool is the most dangerous place in the Rotting World. It’s also where their absolute treasure is located. If you’re lucky, you might be able to pick up a third-level origin treasure.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. There’s a third-level origin treasure in the Corpse Pool of the Rotting World!

Since the Reverence Moon Old Man could tell him about it, there was no need to doubt the authenticity of the news.

Before long...

The Reverence Moon Old Man chatted with Huang Xiaolong. Since Huang Xiaolong was the inheritor of the Radiance Ancestor’s legacy, a doting smile hung on the old man’s face. If Bai Hui and the others could see the expression on the old man’s face, their jaws would drop to the ground. They had never seen the old man smile at them before.

When Huang Xiaolong was chatting with the Reverence Moon Old Man, the news of the old man’s reappearance shook the Reverence Moon Divine City. The news of how he had smashed the faces of Bai Hui, Bin Ge, Bai Luo, and Ban Ke spread like wildfire.

As soon as the news went out, the city started to shake.

“What?! The Reverence Moon Old Man has left seclusion?! He even beat the four deputy deans’ teeth out?! How can something so ridiculous happen?!”

“It’s true! The young master of the Dragon World, Ao Ping, saw it for himself! Ao Li, who had been studying in the imperial courtyard, managed to gain enlightenment and revive the soul of the fourteen winged angel! He entered the Boundary Ancestral Mountain and managed to obtain the treasury left behind by the Radiance World’s ancestor! The four deputy deans disregarded everything and tried to snatch it away from him! In the end, Senior Reverence Moon appeared and smashed their faces in!”

“What?! The Radiance Ancestor’s treasures?!” Ao Li actually managed to obtain it?!”

In an instant, countless experts in the Reverence Moon Divine City broke out into fervent discussions.

As the battle arena set up by Dun Hao still existed, the experts who had come to Reverence Moon Divine City hadn’t yet left. All of them felt their hearts pounding when they heard the news.

One of the reasons was the reemergence of the Reverence Moon Old Man, and the other was because of the Radiance Ancestor’s treasure.

Just a single piece of news was enough to shake them to the core.

When the four deputy deans and Dun Hao returned to the Reverence Moon Hall, their expressions were too ugly to behold. It was mainly so for the four deputy deans. The killing intent in their eyes became so strong that it almost turned solid.

“Dun Hao,” Bin Ge turned to Dun Hao and said, “When that Ao Li comes back to challenge you, I don’t care what you do but use everything at your disposal to kill him! You have to trample on him! If you can’t kill that Ao Li, you can’t blame us for ignoring the relationship between master and disciple....”
