Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The little cow also recognized Hun Dishan and snorted coldly, a malicious gleam in its eyes.

In the distance, Hun Dishan and the four Soul Tribe Grand Elders were searching for the two Asura Kings’ whereabouts when they flew toward Huang Xiaolong’s direction. Hun Dishan did not pay the young man flying towards them any attention, for Huang Xiaolong disguised himself as a Soul Tribe member. Now that Huang Xiaolong appeared with a different face, Hun Dishan naturally couldn’t recognize him.

But when his gaze shifted to the little cow, Hun Dishan was stunned for a moment. Then, looking at the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts under Huang Xiaolong and the little cow, a cold light gleamed in his eyes.

He had once found two Cloud Devouring Divine Beast corpses with unique but subtle features that he was familiar with, and the two in front of him also had them, exactly the same!

Hun Dishan stopped in front of Huang Xiaolong’s group, his sharp gaze locked on Huang Xiaolong.

“You’re that punk?” Hun Dishan sharply questioned Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled nonchalantly, replying, “Soul Tribe Young Lord’s eyesight is quite good, recognizing me so fast.”

“It really is you!” Killing intent erupted in Hun Dishan’s eyes, fury like never before burned in his heart.

If it wasn’t for this damn punk, he wouldn’t have been punished by his father, locked inside the dungeon for a year, where he was tortured by the burning of geocentric fire!

If it wasn’t for this damn punk, he might have probably already succeeded in refining the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, the treasury key would be safe where it was, and an entire hill filled with fifty-million-year-old herbs wouldn’t have been stolen, including treasures like the Nether Spirit Beads!

“Young Lord, this kid is?” Watching Hun Dishan’s enraged expression, Grand Elder Hun Xing asked, feeling a little confused.

“He’s the thief that stole our tribe’s treasury key!” Hun Dishan roared, glaring hatefully at Huang Xiaolong.

“What, him?!”

Hun Xing, Hun Cheng, Hun Biwu, and Hun Xin, the Soul Tribe’s Great Four Grand Elders were taken aback, but in the next second, killing intent surged from their bodies. In a flicker, four figures surrounded Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

“Punk, you’ve got some dog guts to sneak into our Soul Tribe, stealing the treasury key. You even stole an entire hill of fifty-million-year-old herbs, Nether Spirit Beads, and Ancient God Realm godheads!” Hun Xing’s eyes were exceptionally cold.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was surrounded by the four Grand Elders, Hun Dishan sneered, “Looks like your illusion technique is quite good, good enough to fool our Eminent Elders guarding the treasury.” His gaze fell onto the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, adding, “It seems you also know a puppetry technique, hehe, and it seems to be very profound, this is really a pleasant surprise for me ah.”

Hun Dishan could tell at a glance that Huang Xiaolong was the one controlling the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, such technique was many times better than his.

He understood very well what it meant to have a powerful controlling technique.

“Ah!” Hun Dishan suddenly exclaimed as if he had just noticed something unbelievable. His widened eyes stared at Huang Xiaolong like a stranger all of a sudden.

A few years back when he hunted Huang Xiaolong, he was just a Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm, but now, this punk was already a late-Ninth Order Heavenly God Realm.

“This, how is this possible?!” Hun Dishan muttered dazedly under his breath.

“Young Lord, what is it? What is impossible?” Hun Cheng asked lowly, there was confusion in his eyes.

Hun Dishan sucked in a breath of cold air, replying, “A few years back when I chased after this punk, he was still a Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm.”

Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm!

Hun Xing and the other three Grand Elders slightly trembled.

“Young Lord, you’re saying that this kid broke through from Sixth Order to late-Ninth Order Heavenly God Realm in a few years?! You, you, are you sure he was only a Sixth Order at that time?” Hun Xing asked.

Hun Dishan nodded, “I remember it clearly.”

The four Soul Tribe Grand Elders’ burning gazes locked onto Huang Xiaolong like they were staring at a chaos treasure.

“The fact that this kid can break through from Sixth Order to Late-Ninth Order Heavenly God Realm in a short few years shows there must be a great secret on him!” Hun Xing’s lit up with expectations.

Even their Soul Tribe’s First Ancestor did not have such terrifying cultivation speed!

The five people’s eyes reflected each other’s excitement and greed, akin to five big wolves seeing a juicy piece of meat.

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly looking at their expressions.

It was clear to him that these four Soul Tribe Gran Elders’ strength was about the same level as the three old men who attempted to pass through the Pill Blending Grand Formation, early Seventh Order Ancient God Realm.

Although there were four of them, his Black Baboon could easily abuse them to death.

As for Hun Dishan, a mere peak mid-Third Order Ancient God Realm, any one of the Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts could smash him to death with a paw.

“Looks like coming to this Lightning Lagoon Mainland was the right decision. Although we didn’t find the two Asura Kings, the Patriarch will not blame us for not completing the task if capture this kid.” Hun Xin laughed happily.

“If we search this kid’s memories and get his shocking secret, the Patriarch will reward us instead!” A smile bloomed on Hun Xing’s face.

While the five of them were happily laughing and discussing Huang Xiaolong’s ‘great secret,’ the space around them shook as a horrifying pressure came bearing down on them. Before Hun Dishan, Hun Xing, and the others’ astounded faces, a giant black beast resembling a baboon appeared in front of them.

The cheerful smiles on their faces vanished, replaced by deep horror.

“Bl- chaos spiritual beast, Black Baboon?!”

Furthermore, from the overwhelming pressure it exuded, this Black Baboon was close to advancing to Eighth Order Ancient God Realm! Perhaps, it already was an Eighth Order Ancient God Realm chaos spiritual beast!

“You!” Hun Xing and the other four paled as they looked incredulously at Huang Xiaolong. Before they could say a word, the Black Baboon’s fist slammed down like a hammer onto the Soul Tribe Grand Elders. Terrified, the four of them swiftly jumped away while sending attacks toward the Black Baboon at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong shifted his attention to Hun Dishan while the Black Baboon was dealing with the four Grand Elders, calmly asking, “Soul Tribe Young Lord, just now you mentioned that your purpose in coming to this Lightning Lagoon Mainland is to find two Asura Kings?”

Hun Dishan’s expression at this moment was distorted with anger but did not speak.

Huang Xiaolong snorted and the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast below him struck its paw onto Hun Dishan, half-burying him into the ground below.

Hun Xing and the other three Grand Elders watched as Hun Dishan shot towards the ground, helpless to do anything as they were already having a hard time trying to dodge the Black Baboon’s attack

The Cloud Devouring Divine Beast struck once more, causing Hun Dishan’s to be completely buried.

After a few more hammering attacks, the Cloud Devouring Divine Beast finally stopped. A force pulled Hun Dishan’s limp body out of the pit toward Huang Xiaolong who then began to search through his memories.

A short while later. Huang Xiaolong had gone through all of Hun Dishan’s memories.

Disappointingly, he did not find the two Asura Kings’ location, only that they were on the Lightning Lagoon Mainland.

Why these two Asura Kings appeared on the Lightning Lagoon Mainland and what the secret behind their presence here was, Hun Dishan didn’t know.

A short while later, the Black Baboon had taken care of the four Grand Elders, taking their bodies and spatial rings to Huang Xiaolong.

He kept away all these people’s spatial rings and left their godheads to the little cow.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong and the little cow prepared to leave, sounds of applause rang in the air as a young man in crimson robes emerged from the void, exuding a sharp blade qi aura.

This young man was the Bladeless Gate’s Young Lord that Huang Xiaolong and the little cow had seen battling before.

“Marvelous! Marvelous!” The Bladeless Gate young man applauded with a smile on his face.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
