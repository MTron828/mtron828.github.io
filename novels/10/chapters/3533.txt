Chapter 3534: More Star Dragon Scales

 

Even though they spoke till their mouths ran dry, Huang Xiaolong’s reaction didn’t surprise them. They were going to the Black Sea.

When the two of them mentioned the idea of following him, Huang Xiaolong shook his head resolutely. “I shall go alone. After all, the Creation Palace owns the area. The lesser the people the better.”

They wouldn’t be able to avoid detection if all of them went together.

It would be much more convenient for him to go alone. Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang might be strong, but they would be useless if a fight really broke out in the Black Sea. After all, the Creation Palace didn’t lack experts weaker than them.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong, and the others paid a visit to the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s treasury before he left. He exchanged for the various treasures he needed, and he basically swept away the entire inventory of Deep Sea Essence Stones and Radiant Horns.

The price he had to pay was four Star Dragon Scales!

With just four scales, he managed to exchange for a ton of treasures needed to upgrade his creation artifacts! 

One could only imagine how precious the Star Dragon Scales were.

A single scale was enough to trade for several universe-level spiritual veins. 

The Star Dragon Scales were pretty much useless to Huang Xiaolong after he refined so many of them in the past. That was also because he obtained the Star Dragon Divine Tree. The law contained in the scale came from the divine tree itself.

Since they were nothing valuable to him, it was more than worth it to trade for so many treasures he needed.

Even so, Chen Yizhan and Lin Tong were shocked to hear what Huang Xiaolong exchanged.

“Huang Xiaolong actually has so many Star Dragon Scales!” Chen Yizhen gasped in shock.

Star Dragon Scales were in high demand in the Star Dragon Universe, but it was equally as valuable in the First Universe.

“Huang Xiaolong probably got them from the Star Dragon couple. I didn’t think that they would be so generous. Looks like Huang Xiaolong is pretty important to them…” Lin Tong gasped.

“He might have more on him!” Chen Yizhen said all of a sudden.

“Do you mean…”

“I heard that Huang Xiaolong sent Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang to look for news on naturally formed great worlds in the First Universe.” Chen Yizhen muttered, “He’s definitely trying to raise his strength as soon as possible, and I still have several Eternal Heaven Pills on me along with several universe-level spiritual veins.”

Eternal Heaven Pills were peak-grade creation-level pills.

Lin Tong nodded. “I have several universe-level spiritual veins too…”

He might not have any more pills, but he had quite a lot of spiritual veins.

The treasures they had on them might not be useful to half-step Universe Gods like them, and they decided to trade them for several Star Dragon Scales.

After all, the Star Dragon Scales contained the grand dao laws comprehended by the Star Dragon Couple. It would greatly assist their journey to become a Universe God.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong met Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong. When he saw the thirty plus universe-level spiritual veins and hundreds of Eternal Heaven Pills before him, he was stunned. 

“Alliance Heads, are you trying to use these to trade for my Star Dragon Scales?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Happiness bloomed in his heart, but a frown formed on his face. After living for so long, he had long since learned how to control his emotions. A reluctant expression was revealed to all.

Chen Yizhen laughed, “We know about your desire to obtain universe-level spiritual veins. It’s a coincidence Brother Lin Tong and I have a few of them on hand. The Eternal Heaven Pills are what we gathered after obtaining the rarest treasures in the First Universe. They are great for raising your strength.”

“I wonder if you still have several Star Dragon Scales on you…” Lin Tong asked. “Of course, we know how precious they are, and we won’t short-change you.”

In fact, the two of them felt their hearts pounding when they requested for the trade.

“I do have a little more Star Dragon Scales on me, but I’m getting low on them.” Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a second and continued, “I might need the universe-level spiritual veins to raise my strength, but I can’t do without the Star Dragon Scales either. I wish to keep some of them for myself.”

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong looked at each other before bringing out a gigantic spiritual vein each.

“Peak-grade universe-level spiritual vein!” Huang Xiaolong jumped in fright. Moreover, they had two of them.

“That’s right. We obtained these when we explored a secret region somewhere in the universe.” Chen Yizhen nodded.

Lin Tong continued, “The number of peak-grade universe-level spiritual veins in the First Universe can probably be counted on a single hand.” 

Huang Xiaolong was definitely tempted. He didn’t think that the two of them would be so generous.

It seemed as though he had underestimated the value of his Star Dragon Scales.

He wondered if the two of them would start to plot against him if he revealed the fact that he was the Star Dragon Divine Tree. They might kill him there and then…

After all, the value of the tree was more than enough for them to offend the Star Dragon Couple.

As such, Huang Xiaolong raised the awareness in his heart once again. The matter of the Star Dragon Divine Tree can never be revealed.

After half a day of negotiating, Huang Xiaolong used ten scales to trade for everything before him. There were tons of spiritual herbs and ingredients, and the two peak-grade spiritual veins were included in the pile.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After the two of them left, Huang Xiaolong looked at the treasures he obtained, and he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He was planning to head over to the Black Sea, but it seemed as though he would have to hold out for a little while as he refined his newfound treasures.

That wasn’t all. When everyone learned that Huang Xiaolong still had several scales, the Gods of Creation of the alliance came over to trade with him. Even Jin Shenglin and Huang Zongquan couldn’t help but appear.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect that to happen, and he used another ten scales to trade for more than forty universe-level spiritual veins.

When Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi saw the sheer number of spiritual veins in front of Huang Xiaolong, they were dumbfounded.

They swore that they had never seen so many of them in a single place.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. It seemed as though he had to enter seclusion immediately!

He wanted to refine the Sun Moon Furnace and Purple Lightning Peak when he traded for the treasures from the vault of the alliance, but now, there was a change of plans. He decided to refine the spiritual veins and increase his strength before thinking of anything else.
