Chapter 3618 – Buying a Batch of Universe Spiritual Veins?!

“Zhou Chi? Lin Qiankun? Rong Hua?” Yang Rong stared at Huang Xiaolong with a frown on her face. A smile slowly appeared on her face and she continued, “Are you talking about Lord Zhou Chi from the Ice Mountain? Isn’t he one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land?” It was evident that she didn’t believe Huang Xiaolong.

No one could blame her.

Who would believe that one of the ten strongest experts of the Limitless Land was the subordinate of a random youngster they met on the streets?

Anyone who trusted what he said was definitely a fool.

Chen Hui frowned. She looked at Huang Xiaolong slowly. Initially, he caught her eye because of his impressive aura and his kind heart. Now, she felt that he was someone who only knew how to toot his own horn. It seemed as though he wasn’t the prince charming she was looking for.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about their reactions. “Yeah, that’s the one.”

Yang Rong laughed out loud, “You’re pretty funny…”

Shrugging his shoulders slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on explaining himself.

Yang Rong decided to give him some advice, “Young Master, you should avoid telling others about this. If what you say gets passed around, Lord Zhou Chi, Lin Qiankun, and Rong Hua might not care, but their disciples would definitely deal with you!”

“You might even drag your loved ones into this!” Chen Hui who was standing beside Yang Rong piped up all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled slightly. “Many thanks for your reminders.”

“We won’t be bothered to speak to others like this!” Yang Rong explained, “We’re doing this because of your kind actions previously!” She spoke like an elder to Huang Xiaolong.

Finding the two of them pretty interesting, Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I thank you for your advice.”

“Are you planning to buy some things on the second floor?” Yang Rong changed the topic.

“That’s right. The resources I require can only be found on the second floor.”

Of course, he didn’t tell them that he planned to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins. Even if he did, the two of them would think that he was exaggerating.

“We’re heading up there too!” Yang Rong giggled. “Let’s head up together.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject them this time and he simply agreed.

The three of them entered the formation at the same time.

“If you see anything you fancy, I’ll buy them for you. Let’s take it as a gesture of thanks for your reminder.” Huang Xiaolong joked.

“It’s alright. We wish to buy a batch of dragon marrow. They don’t come cheap and we can’t spend your money.” Yang Rong muttered. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Oh? Dragon marrow?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned.

He refined many of them in the past. Before he entered the God of Creation Realm, he managed to obtain a ton of them in the Meng Tian Universe.

That was where he met Gu Yuan and Long Yi.

In the eyes of Dao Venerables, dragon marrow was definitely an expensive treasure. However, they were practically worth peanuts to experts in the God of Creation Realm. To the current Huang Xiaolong, they were things he could obtain at the snap of his fingers.

“That’s right.” Chen Hui touched her chin and continued, “We need high-grade dragon marrows and they cost more than a billion each!”

Yang Rong continued, “We need several dozen of them and we can’t expect young master to pay such a huge amount…”

After all, they were talking about tens of billions of dao coins.

She wasn’t looking down on Huang Xiaolong. However, tens of billions wasn’t a small amount! Not even young masters of the great families would be able to bring out that much! For example, the young master of the Wei Family back in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire couldn’t take out such a huge amount!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t insist after what they said.

After arriving on the second floor, they could see that the entire area was built differently. The materials used were of the universe level and Yang Rong introduced, “There are high-grade dragon marrows in that shop!”

As such, the three of them headed over.

When they arrived, they quickly learned that there were nearly forty high-grade dragon marrows left. Yang Rong and Chen Hui quickly ordered them all.

“Young Master, now that we purchased what we came here for, why don’t we look for your items?” Yang Rong asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly and he looked around. When he locked on to his destination, he started to make his way over.

From Zhou Chi and the others, he heard that there were many shops on the second floor that had universe-level spiritual veins. However, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce was the entity that had the most!

Many God of Creation Realm experts in the grand completion stage and above loved to trade spiritual veins for treasures.

As one of the largest chambers of commerce in the Limitless Land, the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce had many branches in the region. Their main mode of business was to trade universe level herbs.

As such, Huang Xiaolong went directly towards it.

When the two ladies saw where they were, they sucked in a cold breath.

“Young Master, are you really planning to purchase something in the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce?!” Yang Rong gasped. “The cheapest item here starts at ten billion!”

She was afraid that Huang Xiaolong had no idea what entity the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce was.

“I asked my subordinates and this was the place they told me.” Without wasting any more time, he stepped through the entrance.

Yang Rong and Chen Hui hesitated for a moment before following him into the hall.

In fact, the two of them would enter the night market from time to time. The Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce was somewhere they wouldn’t go normally. When they entered the place, they would only look around without buying anything! After all, they couldn’t afford anything there! They could only admire the treasures silently.

When they entered the main entrance, the two of them started to tread carefully. They were afraid of drawing attention to themselves. Experts in the God of Creation Realm were everywhere in the hall. Some random old man they ran into could even be a God of Creation at the grand completion stage!

Huang Xiaolong quickly went to the counter in the main hall.

The attendant stationed there was a pretty lady and her figure was extremely enchanting.

“Young Master, can I help you?”

“I wish to buy a batch of universe-level spiritual veins. How many of them do you have here?” Huang Xiaolong went straight to the point.

The attendant stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Chen Hui and Yang Rong who were behind him felt an explosion going off in their heads.

“A batch… A batch of universe-level spiritual veins?!” Yang Rong stared at Huang Xiaolong, flabbergasted.
