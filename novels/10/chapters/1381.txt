“Brother Guo Jin, since Huang Xiaolong killed our Young Lord Guo Jun, we mustn’t let him die comfortably!” One of the Guo Family’s Grand Elders said, as he was very angry even at the thought of Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right ah, Lord Sea God Feng Yingying won’t have Huang Xiaolong die so easily, right? If it was up to me, I would have captured Huang Xiaolong, and let our Guo Family punish him according to every rule in our family by making him suffer all the unbearable pain, and torture him to death. Only that will allow us to vent our anger!” Another Guo Family’s Grand Elders chimed in.

Other Guo Family’s Ancestors also shouted similar things.

In short, Huang Xiaolong didn’t deserve to die comfortably, and they needed to put through every torture they could think of.

One of the Grand Elders even suggested hanging Huang Xiaolong above the Sea God’s sacrificial altar and having the sea tribe’s disciples urinate on them, and stoned him.

Just as everyone in the hall was clamoring how to torture Huang Xiaolong to his death, a Guo Family’s Elder walked in and reported to Guo Jin, “Grand Elder Guo Jin, a disciple from the outer post has reported of spotting Huang Xiaolong above Sky Heart Island!”

“Huang Xiaolong!”

Everyone blanked momentarily.

Guo Jin’s brows were locked tightly, there was doubt in his eyes, “Are you sure it’s Huang Xiaolong?”

Shouldn’t Huang Xiaolong be in Lord Sea God Feng Yingying’s custody at this moment? Why would Huang Xiaolong appear in the Sky Heart Island area?

The Sky Heart Island is not far away from the Sea God City, less than fifty thousand li distance.

“Absolutely true.” The Guo Family’s Elder confirmed respectfully, “It is indeed, Huang Xiaolong.”

“Who else is with him?” Guo Jin asked solemnly.

“Other than Huang Xiaolong, there is his mount, a small azure cow; an ordinary-looking elephant, as well as one woman and two men. They are likely Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates.” Guo Family’s Elder reported honestly.

Guo Jin was clearly relieved when he heard that. Still, he asked again to make sure, “Golden Brow and Blood Knife did not come?”

“No, we did not see Golden Brow!” The Elder affirmed again.

Excellent!

Guo Jin was completely at ease now.

“Strange, why would Huang Xiaolong appear in our sea tribe’s territory at this time?” Another Guo Family’s Grand Elder voiced his doubt aloud.

“What’s so strange about this is that Huang Xiaolong coincidentally is not at Fortune City, when Lord Sea God Feng Yingying is there, hence, he has escaped a calamity!” A Guo Family’s Grand Elder stated confidently.

“The question is, why is he here at our sea tribe’s territory?” Another Grand Elder reiterated the question.

Guo Jin wasn’t very concerned. He said, “Our sea tribe has many herbs and elixirs, and the disciples from the human race have often come looking for them in our territories. Huang Xiaolong is probably one of such disciples, but since he has dared to step into the sea tribe’s territories, regardless of his intentions, he won’t be able to go back!”

Guo Jin got up in a hurry. There was a murderous gleam in his eyes as he said, “During the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, we were cautious because of Golden Brow’s presence, but now our sea tribe has seven great God King Realm masters, no one can stop us!”

“Come, let’s go capture Huang Xiaolong!” Guo Jin ordered.

Since the Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi were absent, all the Guo Family’s affairs were temporarily being handled by Guo Jin. Other Grand Elders had to obey Guo Jin’s order.

At Guo Jin’s order, all the Guo Family’s Grand Elders stood up and complied loudly.

One of the Guo Family’s Grand Elders laughed, “All of our Guo Family’s Grand Elders are moving out just to capture Huang Xiaolong, I have to say it’s his honor!”

“We’re free anyways, so we can ‘welcome’ him to the sea tribe!”

With laughter echoing in the air, a large group of Guo Family’s Grand Elders flew out of the hall.

...

At this time, Guo Gang came from a distance. He went up to Guo Jin and said, “Father, I have heard from the disciples that Huang Xiaolong has entered the sea tribe’s territories, and is currently at the Sky Heart Island! Please allow me to follow Father to capture Huang Xiaolong!”

Guo Jin hesitated, then nodded in agreement, “Alright, but, when we are capturing Huang Xiaolong, you cannot be blinded by hatred and kill Huang Xiaolong on impulse!”

Guo Gang promised, “Rest assured, Father!” Hatred crept up his face as he added, “I won’t kill Huang Xiaolong so easily!”

Guo Jin nodded.

With that settled, everyone departed.

However, the group of Guo Family’s Grand Elders did not expect to see Huang Xiaolong’s group flying towards them just as they flew out from the Sea God City.

Like the Guo Family’s Elder had reported, there was a common elephant, one woman and two men in Huang Xiaolong’s group.

As the void devil beast Xu Baisheng was heavily injured by the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy, Huang Xiaolong had left him to heal at the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

Huang Xiaolong sneered when he spotted the Guo Family’s Grand Elders flying out from the Sea God City.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong’s group and the Guo Family’s group were standing a hundred meters apart in the air.

Guo Jin looked at Huang Xiaolong with a bright smile on his face, “Huang Xiaolong, you still dared to come to Sea God City after killing our Guo Family’s Young Lord Guo Jun?!”

Huang Xiaolong shrugged nonchalantly as he said, “I merely killed Guo Jun, so why wouldn’t I dare to come? I’ll tell you frankly, I have even killed your Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi.”

Even though Guo Da and Guo Shi were killed by Xu Baisheng, it was still Huang Xiaolong who had indirectly killed them. Therefore, there was nothing wrong in Huang Xiaolong saying so.

The Guo Family’s group blanked for a moment at Huang Xiaolong’s words, then burst out into a sonorous laughter.

Guo Gang laughed so hard that he was bent over, with tears threatening to fall from his eyes.

After a while, Guo Jin was still laughing as he spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, you said you’ve killed our Ancestor and Patriarch? I’m afraid that you don’t know that our Ancestor and Patriarch have already broken through to God King Realm—God King Realm! Do you understand! Do you know what a God King Realm master represents? Immortality!”

“You say a mere Ancient God Realm like you killed our Ancestor and Patriarch? I’m going to die from laughing! Even your Master Golden Brow will not dare to utter such bluff! If you have the ability, come kill me! If you can kill me, I will believe you!"

The Guo Family’s group burst into another wave of laughter. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Huang Xiaolong was extremely calm as he looked at Xiang Xun and commanded, "Kill him!"

Xiang Xun complied respectfully. In truth, he barely moved and merely moved his toe, and Guo Jin exploded to his death. Starting from his head, arms, torso, and even his godhead.

Everything happened so fast that the rest of the Guo Family’s group’s laughter stopped abruptly, as they kept staring dumbly at Guo Jin’s exploded remains. This, is this an illusion?! However, the splattered blood and flesh on the ground was vivid, and proof enough for what had just happened.

A long time later, Guo Gang screamed, angst stabbed his heart, “Father—!” He rushed madly at Huang Xiaolong. “I’m going to kill you!”

But, even before Guo Gang could close in on Huang Xiaolong, he was sent flying back by Huang Xiaolong’s fist. Guo Gang was embedded into the Sea God City’s city walls.
