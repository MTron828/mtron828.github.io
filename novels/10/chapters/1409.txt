Determination shone within the depths of Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, “If we cannot destroy the four Emperor Palaces in ten thousand years, then we will do it in a hundred thousand years. If a hundred thousand years are not enough, then a million years!”

Others might not succeeded in undertaking this task, but Huang Xiaolong had the confidence to accomplish it!

He was confident because he had three supreme godheads and the Grandmist Parasitic Medium!

Moreover, he had the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool, the Blood Eye Devil Stele, and the knowledge about the whereabouts of the Ancient Heavenly Court treasure in the Devil Abyss!

However, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi were inwardly shaking their heads. All three were thinking that Huang Xiaolong was naive to the point of being ridiculous. The four Emperor Palaces had been in existence for tens of billions of years, and the scope of their power was out of Huang Xiaolong’s imagination. How could Huang Xiaolong destroy such an immense existence within a hundred thousand years of effort?

Then again, even though they felt Huang Xiaolong was being naive to the point of sounding ridiculous, none of them dared to show their true feelings. After all, even the little cow and their Granduncle Xu Baisheng we’re referring to Huang Xiaolong as their Master.

Still, the three of them were confused and stumped. What did this man do to make the little cow, Xu Baisheng, Xiang Xun, and the others acknowledge him as Master?

They could see that Huang Xiaolong was merely a peak late-Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm junior. In some world surfaces, a peak late-Fourth Order Ancestor God Realms were considered to be powerful experts, however, the same cultivation in the vast Divine World was nothing more than a commoner with a little strength.

They could grab this level of juniors within the Void Devil Beast Clan blindfolded.

In the next second, they saw Huang Xiaolong extend his palm out, and... low grade-eight spirit stones rained down from the void—?!!

“Fly at the ship’s fastest speed! Onwards to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.” Huang Xiaolong ordered.

“Yes, Master!” Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng complied crisply.

Xu Yong and the other two felt a parchness in their throats.

Fly at the fastest speed?

“Granduncle, does that mean that we’re going to use these low grade-eight spirit stones to fuel the flying ship’s core formation throughout our journey?” Xu Yong couldn’t stop himself from asking.

Their reactions were similar to how Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng when they had first seen Huang Xiaolong making piles of low grade-eight spirit stones—‘simply too wasteful! Too extravagant!’

Not to mention, flying at the fastest speed meant bigger consumption of spirit stones. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“En.” Xu Baisheng answered firmly. “You all will get used to it soon, as you keep following Master!”

Get used to it!

In these past years, Xu Baisheng had grown used to a lot of things, since he had started following Huang Xiaolong.

Xu Yong and the other two exchanged silent glances.

“Master has said that we would use even higher grade spirit stones to fuel the flying ship after arriving at the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, therefore, these low grade-eight spirit stones are no big deal.” Xu Baisheng added.

Even higher grade spirit stones!

All three Void Devil Beast Clan’s juniors were extremely speechless.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong had returned to the cultivation room number one and cultivated.

He felt more pressured to raise his strength, strive forward, and cultivate harder, after learning about the Void Devil Beast Clan’s genocide.

Since Huang Xiaolong had finished refining all eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, he could only go back to refining the Sea God’s spirits inside the Sea God Tower.

To refine the Sea God’s spirit, he needed Xiang Xun on his side to suppress them from resisting.

Huang Xiaolong summoned his three avatars, and all four circulated their godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as they began refining the Sea God spirit’s pure, and robust energy.

This time around, Huang Xiaolong chose a Sea God’s Spirit with a mid-First Order God King Realm strength.

Under the suppression of Xiang Xun’s godforce, the mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God spirit’s pure energy flowed abundantly into Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ bodies.

As his strength had increased after refining the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, his True Dragon Physique and three supreme godheads’ endurance had greatly increased as well. Therefore, he and his three avatars were refining the mid-First Order Ancestor God King Realm Sea God’s spirit twice as fast, taking no more than a month.

Even though Xiang Xun had already witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, he was still flabbergasted as he watched the mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit’s pure energy rush into Huang Xiaolong’s body like tidal waves, while Huang Xiaolong absorbed it entirely without a sliver of waste.

Was Huang Xiaolong merely a peak late-Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm? Since when did a peak late-Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm’s cultivation speed become this frightening?

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, Xiang Xun would have thought that this speed was only restricted to a God King Realm cultivator.

After Huang Xiaolong finished refining the first mid-First Order Ancestor God Realm Sea God’s spirit, he went on to the next one without a break.

This time also, it was a mid-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit.

...

Four months later, Huang Xiaolong began refining a late-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirits.

Seven months later, it was a peak late-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirits.

When Huang Xiaolong was refining a peak late-First Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit, a light enveloped Huang Xiaolong, as consecutive muffled booms sounded from his body.

Huang Xiaolong’s momentum soared, and a robust supreme godforce surged and roiled, crashing against the four walls of the cultivation room. The sturdy Giant Shark Flying Ship’s body hummed from the clashes, and even Xiang Xun swayed slightly as he stood inside the cultivation room.

Xiang Xun looked at Huang Xiaolong in astonishment—Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm!

Whereas, Huang Xiaolong who had just broken through to the Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm exuded a pressure stronger than the average Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm cultivators; it was many times stronger.

In that case, did it mean that when it was time for Huang Xiaolong to step into high-level Ancestor God Realm, like Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, he would?! Xiang Xun was scared thinking of it.

Meanwhile, Huang Xiaolong continued cultivating and absorbing the Sea God’s spirit’s energy even after he had advanced to Fifth order Ancestor God Realm.

...

The Giant Shark Flying Ship rapidly consumed low grade-eighth spirit stones as it flew towards the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

The whole journey was smooth and peaceful.

Two years passed unknowingly as everyone was immersed in their cultivation.

During these two years, Huang Xiaolong had remained inside the cultivation room number one for this entire entire duration, without taking a single step outside. This was because he had completely entered an ethereal state in cultivation.

By this point, Huang Xiaolong had already refined all eight First Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits. In fact, he had also refined the six Second Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits, and all four Third Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits.

Inside the Sea God Tower, there were only four Fourth Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits, and two Fifth Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits.

Huang Xiaolong stopped cultivating after he finished refining the last Third Order God King Realm Sea God’s spirit. He roughly estimated the time, and guessed that they had probably reached the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.

Huang Xiaolong checked his internal condition using his divine sense. A second later, he nodded with satisfaction.

A little over two years of cultivation, and he had broken through to peak mid-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm; just half a step further, and he would be able to advance to late-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm. Most of all, Huang Xiaolong had not expected that to encounter abundance of energy from the Third Order God King Realm Sea Gods’ spirits.

Huang Xiaolong got up to his feet and stepped out from the cultivation room with Xiang Xun.

There was a complicated expression on Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi’s faces when they saw that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to peak late-Fifth Order Ancestor God Realm, as he came out from his cultivation room.

In the control hall, Huang Xiaolong asked Xu Baisheng about their flight-situation. Xu Baisheng respectfully answered, “ Master, if everything goes well, we would arrive at the Royal Buddha Great Worlds in ten days or so.”
