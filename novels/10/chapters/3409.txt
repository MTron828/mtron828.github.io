Chapter 3410: Heavenless Fled

The Devil World was the messiest world in the Pangu World. It was the darkest among the three. Thick devil qi drifted around the place, and anyone who didn’t cultivate the devil arts would find it difficult to live there.

However, the devil qi was completely unable to affect Huang Xiaolong and the other three.

Among the four, Sun Wukong was the weakest. However, he was still a Combined Dao Ancestor! Even if the devil qi was a thousand times stronger, it couldn’t stop the monkey.

They didn’t stop as they rushed towards the Heavenless Devil Palace. The devil palace appeared in their sights.

However, a frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. After he scanned the entire area, he noticed that the Heavenless Devil Ancestor was gone!

There wasn’t a single person in the palace!

The Heavenless Devil Ancestor fled!

“Your Highness, what’s wrong?” Ying Gou asked when he noticed the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Heavenless fled.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The three of them stared at him in shock.

“He ran away?! That old coward! He definitely ran the moment he heard the news!” Sun Wukong snapped.

The reason they rushed all the way over was because they wanted to make it before the Heavenless Devil Ancestor would be able to escape. They didn’t expect the old devil to run so quickly.

“The Heavenless Devil Ancestor has always been a cautious existence. He’s a cunning b*stard, and he definitely sent some spies over to the Gathering of the Immortal Peaches. He should know that Your Highness would look for him after learning that he was the one fanning the flames behind the scenes, and he ran the moment he got the news.” Ying Gou mentioned.

“Have you met the Heavenless Devil Ancestor in the past?”

Ying Gou nodded. “I fought with him when we were adventuring the Pangu World in the past. He was strong, and I have no idea how strong he is right now.”

“He has never shown his true strength before, and there haven’t been rumors going around about him.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sun Wukong and the Holy Phoenix were shocked by his revelation.

“Do you mean that he hadn’t been showing his true strength since the creation of the universe?!” The Holy Phoenix asked.

“That’s right. Everyone has only seen the strength he wishes to portray to the outside world. Everyone in the Pangu World feels that the six sages are the strongest existences after Hong Jun. In my eyes, I don’t think so.” Ying Gou explained.

Sun Wukong jumped in fright, “Do you think that Heavenless is stronger than the six sages?!”

Lao Zi, the Lord of Primal Beginnings, the Heaven Piercing Sage, Nuwa, and Rulai, were known as the strongest experts after Hong Jun. Now, Ying Gou was telling them a different story.

“That’s right!” YIng Gou nodded. “He is probably stronger than the Heaven Piercing Sage and the others…”

“That… Shouldn’t be possible, right?!” Sun Wukong was still in disbelief.

Ying Gou continued, “Even though this is hard to believe, Your Highness will know what I mean after you meet him.”

“Your Highness, where should we go now?” The Holy Phoenix asked.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. According to his original plan, he planned to take care of the Heavenless Devil Ancestor. He wanted to force the old devil to submit, and he could use the power accumulated by the devil ancestor to search for the Heaven Piercing Sage’s whereabouts. Huang Xiaolong found himself at a loss of what to do for a second.

“We’ll head over to the Heavenless Devil Palace. Let’s see if he left behind any clues.”

As such, the four of them continued on their way.

The moment they approached, the palace spat out a dense cloud of devil qi. The devilish nature of the qi was extremely ferocious.

“That’s the Boundless Devil Qi! It can corrode innate dao physiques and dao souls!” The Holy Phoenix yelled.

The Boundless Devil Qi was the strongest devil qi in the Pangu World. If anyone was affected by it, they would be dead beyond a doubt! Not even Combined Dao Ancestors would be able to hold out for long.

Sun Wukong and Ying Gou gasped.

No one would be able to remain indifferent in the face of the devil qi.

As soon as the cloud emerged from the palace, the entire area was surrounded. It sealed off all routes of escape, and when the devil qi was about to swallow Sun Wukong and the others, Huang Xiaolong made his move. He reached out with a single hand and beams of light emerged. They were like a tidal wave that swept the Boundless Devil Qi away.

It didn’t take long for all the devil qi to be refined.

Sun Wukong and the others stared at him in shock.

“This…”

“It’s the power of radiance at the perfection level.” Huang Xiaolong glanced at the monkey and said. “You’re a Spiritual Radiant Stone Ape, and you will be able to comprehend it if you focus on your cultivation.”

“Is that true?!”

Huang Xiaolong continued, “If you manage to comprehend the power of radiance to the grand perfection level, you’ll be able to purify the power of absolute poison! Just to let you know, the power of poison is tens of thousands of times more terrifying than this devil qi.”

Out of the thirteen elements, the power of radiance was ranked fourth. The power of poison was ranked sixth, and it was true that the power of radiance would trump over the power of poison.

“The Heavenless Devil Ancestor definitely arranged for this ambush! He knows that we will definitely come for him, and he laid it down before he escaped!” Ying Gou muttered.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. He had long since discovered the presence of the Boundless Devil Qi.

Soon after, the four of them flipped the palace upside down in order to look for clues. It was too bad the old devil cleaned his tracks before leaving, and Huang Xiaolong and the others failed to discover anything.

“We’ll head over to the Yin Yang Devil Race!” Huang Xiaolong said after they emerged from the palace.

The Heavenless Devil Race was the strongest race in the devil world, and their power spanned across half the world. The Yin Yang Devil Race might not be comparable to the Heavenless Devil Race, but they weren’t too far behind. If they could use the power of the Yin Yang Devil Race to look for the Heaven Piercing Sage, that would be for the best.

It took three days for them to arrive.

…

“What the f*ck! Hongyuan’s luck with the ladies is too damn good! How many concubines does he need?! This seems to be the 1632nd one, right?!”

“I heard that his latest concubine is special. She’s the princess of the Silver Tree Devil Race!”

“Silver Tree Devil Race?! The Silver Tree Old Devil actually plans to marry his daughter off to Hong Yuan?!”

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t entered the city when he heard the discussions coming from the members of the devil race.

Yinyang Hongyuan needs a lot of women to practice his devil arts.” Ying Gou mentioned.

When the party entered the city, they were stopped by the guards.

“Where’s your invitation?”

Sun Wukong chuckled happily when he heard the question. He used a single punch to send the guard flying.
