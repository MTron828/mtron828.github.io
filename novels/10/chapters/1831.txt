When the grand elders and elders saw how their Chief kneeled before Huang Xiaolong, they felt shocked. Especially the grand elder, who had ordered to throw out Huang Xiaolong, was more shocked. It was as though all the blood had drained from his body.

“I heard about the events that happened at the gates. This subordinate is at fault, and I will accept Lord’s punishment!” Gao Changran cupped his fists and said.

He lowered his head, and he didn’t dare to breathe loudly before Huang Xiaolong.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong pardoned all of them. “It’s fine. Let all of them leave.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t blame Gao Changran for not publicizing his identity to the Six Nether Gate’s disciples. He knew what Gao Changran was thinking, and he didn’t place the previous encounter in his heart.

“Yes, Lord!” Gao Changran acknowledged before turning around to address the Six Nether Gate’s members. “Take your leave.”

Of course, no one dared to go against his order, and all of them left the hall.

Gao Changran swept his gaze past his son, Gao Fang, and daughter, Gao Mengyao, requesting them to leave as well.

When everyone had left the hall, Gao Changran kneeled before Huang Xiaolong once again and kowtowed. “Gao Changran greets Your Majesty, the King of Hell! Your Majesty is invincible throughout the lands!”

In fact, he had informed his children about Huang Xiaolong’s background. Both of them knew that he was from the Netherworld King’s Organization, but they didn’t know his exact position.

Without Huang Xiaolong’s order, no one dared to leak his position in the organization carelessly.

After allowing Gao Changran to stand, Huang Xiaolong started to ask him about the matters regarding the Frigid North City and the Eternal Devil Lands.

Gao Changran didn’t dare to hide anything and replied with whatever knowledge he had. He told Huang Xiaolong everything he knew, down to the smallest detail. Before long, Huang Xiaolong gained a better picture of the situation.

After hearing Gao Changran’s report, Huang Xiaolong frowned. It seemed as though things were much more complicated than he had thought. Along with the news of the birth of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and the Glaze Devil Stele, tons of hidden masters had emerged. The Frigid North City was filled with experts and beasts overnight.

It seemed as though all the experts from the thirty-six cities had gathered in Frigid North City.

Right now, Frigid North City was experiencing an unprecedented boom.

Typically, one wouldn’t be able to see existences who had surpassed the Emperor Realm even if they waited for a billion years. However, based on the Six Nether Gate’s report, five of those existences had gathered in the Frigid North City!

It was unimaginable that five overlords had gathered in the same city at the same time.

However, reality proved otherwise. They were currently gathered in the Frigid North City.

“Did the ancestor of the Massacring Gods Gate, Chi Han, come as well?” Huang Xiaolong felt that it was a little inconvincible.

“Indeed. Your Majesty, we received news that Chu Han is currently residing in the Silver Devil Sect’s headquarters!”

“Silver Devil Sect...” A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Silver Devil Sect was the third-ranked superpower in the Frigid North City. It was also ranked in the top twenty of the entire Devil World. Even though their position was still far from the Devil Ape Cult, they were way stronger than the Six Nether Gate.

The Six Nether Gate considered the Silver Devil Sect as an insurmountable existence.

Since Chu Han could reside in their headquarters, it seemed as though his relationship with them was something out of the ordinary.

Suddenly, one of the grand elders of the Six Nether Gate entered the hall and reported to Gao Changran, “Chief, the young master of the Devil Ape Cult, sent a transmission symbol to us. He said...” Halfway through the report, the grand elder’s words ground to a halt.

“What did he say?” Gao Changran asked. “Where’s the transmission symbol?”

The grand elder hastily retrieved a transmission symbol and passed it over to Gao Changran. The moment Gao Changran read it, his face dropped.

He ordered the grand elder to leave the hall.

“Your Majesty, please take a look.” As soon as the grand elder had left, Gao Changran passed the transmission symbol to Huang Xiaolong.

Accepting it, Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze over it and saw that the young master of the Devil Ape Cult had commanded Gao Changran to rush over to the Heavenly Punishment Pavilion in the Six Nether City. If he failed to do so, there would be severe consequences.

It was a clear threat.

Of course, it was clear as day that the young master of the Devil Ape Cult was saying that the Devil Ape Cult would move against the Six Nether Gate if they failed to comply.

There was no doubt that the young master of the Devil Ape Cult was able to openly threaten Gao Changran due to the overwhelming strength of the faction behind him.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “There’s no need to care about him. It’s just the Devil Ape Cult...”

“Yes!” Since the King of Hell commanded him to ignore the message, Gao Changran felt like a hundred-ton boulder was lifted off his chest.

“Have we prepared everything we need to enter the Eternal Devil Lands?”

As the name suggested, the Frigid North City experienced extreme winter. Since the Eternal Devil Lands was located deep past that, they couldn’t avoid the bone-piercing chill. The coldness would seep deep into one’s soul, and there was definitely a need to be well prepared. Armor and divine pills to ward away the cold were a must.

“Your Majesty, please rest assured that I have already prepared everything we need. I sent someone to purchase a batch of Fire Phoenix Divine Armor. We also bought a batch of Fire Dragon Scorched Heavenly Pills. Everything should be ready in a few days. I have also ordered for someone to buy an Icy Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ship.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “That’s great. Make some preparations. As soon as things are ready, we’ll leave for the Eternal Devil Lands.”

Gao Changran bowed in acknowledgment, and Huang Xiaolong allowed him to take his leave.

When Gao Changran returned to his palace, he saw both his son and daughter waiting for him in the main hall.

He knew that they were curious about the events that had happened with regards to Huang Xiaolong.

“Father, what is the Lord’s identity? Why would you need to kowtow to him? Could he be the personal disciple of one of the Great Commanders of the Netherworld King’s Organization?” Gao Mengyao couldn’t hold back her curiosity.

Of course, Gao Changran shook his head. He said in a solemn tone, “The Lord’s identity isn’t something you can casually ask about. Enough. The news about him being from the Netherworld King’s Organization cannot be leaked! Otherwise, we won’t be able to clean our names even if we were to die a hundred deaths! Ensure none of the elders and grand elders speak a word about today’s matter. If they do, they will be charged with treason!”

Both Gao Fan and Gao Mengyao felt their hearts shaking as they replied, “Yes, father!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Father, are we really going to the Eternal Devil Lands?” Gao Fan asked all of a sudden. “The Eternal Devil Lands are filled with restrictions, and many superpowers have their sights set on it as well. With the power of our Six Nether Gate, even if we really locate the two Devil Steles, we won’t be able to keep them. We might even invite a sect destroying disaster!”

Gao Changran chuckled, “You do not need to worry about this. The Lord has his arrangements. If we really find the two Devil Steles, the Lord will reward us handsomely. The rewards he will be giving are something you can’t even begin to imagine.”

He knew that the current King of Hell was extremely generous when it came to rewards.

By the time an hour had passed, the young master of the Devil Ape Cult, Wu Jingnan, sat in the Heavenly Punishment Pavilion as he boiled with rage. How dare Gao Changran refuse to turn up?! Didn’t I give him an invitation?!

Is Gao Changran disrespecting my Devil Ape Cult?!
