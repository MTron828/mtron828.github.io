Chapter 2672: Grand Dao Physique, Dao Soul

“We are not able to determine her location,” Yuan Wangfeng answered, shaking his head. “We only know that she left the Otherworldly Mansion about the same time as Huang Xiaolong, and there is no news of her ever since.” Then his eyes lit up as he ventured a wild guess, “Could she have gone to the World River with Huang Xiaolong?”

“Impossible.” Yuan Qianxing firmly refuted, “When Huang Xiaolong was at the World River, he had been acting alone the entire time. Fei Yanzi wasn’t with him. Moreover, when we hunted down Huang Xiaolong, we didn’t discover any signs of Fei Yanzi in the vicinity.” He let out a snort and added, “That ugly woman, when I find her, I’ll strip her naked and let her feel like death is better than living!”

Whenever Yuan Qianxing remembered that Fei Yanzi had rejected him but stayed at Huang Xiaolong’s Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave, and recalled her cold gaze and indifference towards him during the stage battle competition, murderous aura surged from his body.

“Fei Yanzi is not around, so we can seize this opportunity to annihilate the Flying Heaven Race!” Yuan Wangfeng reminded.

Yuan Qianxing waved his hand. “Regardless, the Flying Heaven Race is still a royal family of the Alien Lands, and if we start slaughtering the Flying Heaven Race without a good cause, it would trigger other royal families’ dissatisfaction, and they will band-up against us.” Then, he suddenly thought of an idea, “Maybe, you can reconnect with Feitian Jin and Feitian Cheng.”

Yuan Wangfeng immediately understood Yuan Qianxing’s meaning, and smiled in response, “Subordinate has understood.”

Fei Yanzi’s absence was the best time for Feitian Jin to wrestle power.

With Yuan Qianxing around, Feitian Longpeng wouldn’t be able to cause much of a wave.

……

In the depths of Sky Opening Island, Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the grand dao source spring. At this time, there were strands of grand dao light around Huang Xiaolong’s body, and his three saint godheads hovered above him, as they were also enshrouded in strands of grand dao light.

Before this, the luster of Huang Xiaolong’s three saint godheads, holy light and grand dao light were intermingled, but now, there was no longer any trace of holy light. There only existed the light of grand dao!

This meant…. dao soul!Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Over a decade of cultivating inside the grand dao source spring, Huang Xiaolong’s three holy souls had successfully transformed into dao souls!

On top of that, Huang Xiaolong’s saint physique had also successfully transformed to dao physique! His early Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm cultivation had risen to Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm!

And it wasn’t as simple as early Sixth Heaven True Saint, but the peak late-Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm!

He had the dao physique, dao soul, and Inextinguishable Dao Heart!

These three were the ‘banners’ of a Primal Ancestor Realm, yet Huang Xiaolong was genuinely a peak late-Sixth Heaven True Saint. Although Yuan Qianxing had successfully transformed his Inextinguishable Dao Heart at Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm, he still had a saint physique and holy soul. On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong had already checked all three ‘banners.’

The current Huang Xiaolong was no different than a Primal Ancestor Realm expert except for actual cultivation realm.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and the dao light enshrouding his body gradually dispersed. His three saint godheads returned to Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Huang Xiaolong leaped up, standing in the air in his birthday suit.

Under the light, Huang Xiaolong’s skin reflected a fascinating glow.

Compared to a decade ago, Huang Xiaolong’s physical body had been elevated to another level. If a Primal Ancestor expert was here and saw Huang Xiaolong’s body, his flesh and bones, down to the last drop of blood, he was composed of intertwining grand dao laws. Not a flaw or weakness could be found.

Huang Xiaolong took out a robe from the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and covered his perfect body.

“It’s time to go out,” Huang Xiaolong mumbled to himself.

Although he very much wanted to seize this time to break through to Seventh Heaven True Saint in one go, he estimated that it would take him at least a hundred years of accumulation for that, and he couldn’t spend that long in this place.

Anyhow, based on his current strength, it was more than enough to squish Yuan Qianxing dead, including Yuan Wanfei, and the others. Huang Xiaolong was not afraid of facing Elder Ming either.

Recalling how Yuan Qianxing’s group had besieged him, forcing him to jump into the Death Cave, a cold glint gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Assuming that I am dead, those guys are probably having the time of their lives for the past decade, aren’t they? Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the remaining grand dao source spring that was a little bigger than a puddle. Although he had absorbed most of the grand dao energy from it during his dozen years of cultivating inside it, the rest still had a lot of use.

Huang Xiaolong took out an empty jade bottle and collected the remaining spring water, then walked towards the Tree of Grand Dao.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong had merely consumed six out of the ten Dao Fruits. Therefore, there were still four Dao Fruits left on the tree.

But the most important thing was the Tree of Grand Dao itself.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong moved the Tree of Grand Dao and the dirt around its roots into the Cangqiong Dao Palace’s main courtyard.

With the Tree of Grand Dao absorbing grand dao energy day in and day out, Huang Xiaolong believed that the Cangqiong Dao Palace could improve as well, and even raise its grade.

Naturally, there were distinctions between dao artifacts and currently, the Cangqiong Dao Palace was still a low-grade dao artifact. So were the Flying Heaven Spear and Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring. Whereas the Holy World’s number one dao artifact, Cangqiong Blade, was a mid-grade dao artifact.

There were low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade dao artifacts, and above high-grade was supreme dao artifact.

However, in the entire Holy World and Alien Lands, there wasn’t one piece of high-grade dao artifact, much less supreme dao artifact that was even more precious.

Huang Xiaolong did not stop there. After he collected the Dao Fruits and Tree of Grand Dao, he continued to move all the holy trees on the land into the Cangqiong Dao Palace, one by one. It was useless to leave them there.

The grand dao energy and holy spiritual qi within the Cangqiong Dao Palace immediately reached a new level with the addition of these trees.

When all holy fruits and holy trees were carefully collected and put away, Huang Xiaolong went on with collecting those holy spiritual veins underground, both big and small, and not one was left behind.

These holy spiritual veins had given birth to awareness which made it a little more strenuous to collect them. Then again, for Huang Xiaolong who was a peak late-Sixth Heaven True Saint expert, it was just a little more effort.

Still, Huang Xiaolong spent more than half a month collecting these holy fruits, holy trees, holy spiritual veins, and holy herbs.

Thankfully, Huang Xiaolong’s strength had increased significantly, or else, he would have spent several months to collect all these.

Huang Xiaolong stood in front of the exit towards the Death Cave. As he looked at the exit and sensed the Xuanhuang Turbid Water river’s power coming from the other side, he frowned.

Must I go out this way?

But he couldn’t be sure if he would be able to go out the way he had come even though his strength had improved. He still remembers how horrible the pressure boring down through the tunnel was.

Moreover, at a place with Xuanhuang Turbid Water, there would be Xuanhuang Water, but where is the Xuanhuang Water? Huang Xiaolong extended his holy souls’s divine sense, but did not discover any Xuanhuang Water.

Hesitating for some time, Huang Xiaolong did not cross back to the other side.

He had a nagging feeling that there was another secret in this place, not to mention, he was more than a little unwilling if he didn’t find the Xuanhuang Water.

Then again, the most important thing of all was this Xuanhuang Stone that was the Sky Opening Island! This was the most important treasure of all.

The grand dao source spring was important, the Tree of Grand Dao and Dao Fruits were important, but this big piece of Sky Opening Island Xuanhuang Stone was above all.

Huang Xiaolong returned to where the grand dao source spring was, and continued to fly onward from there.
