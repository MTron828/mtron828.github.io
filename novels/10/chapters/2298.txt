Chapter 2299: White Boned Blade Devil!

“Go! Capture that brat and bring him to us for interrogation!” The male disciple turned and ordered another disciple beside him.

It was clear that the statuses of the male and female disciples were higher than the ordinary disciples.

“Yes, Senior Brother Sui Ceng!” The disciple who was ordered nodded his head and flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

The disciple who approached Huang Xiaolong was not a mere half-step Venerable. He was someone who had already solidified his cultivation and was only waiting for a moment of inspiration to break through!

As he approached Huang Xiaolong, he didn’t bother speaking any sort of nonsense. The first thing he did was to greet Huang Xiaolong with a punch!

As the first-ranked sect in the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground, they were as strong as the Jiang Family! As one of the hegemons, the disciples they possessed had an arrogant air that permeated their bones. They had always acted overbearingly and the disciple was naturally disinclined to speak to someone he didn’t recognize.

However, one of them was clearly more confident in himself. Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at the disciple who was sending a punch to his chest and he merely clicked his finger. In an instant, the disciple from the Revered River Divine Sect exploded into a mist of blood. He didn’t even have the chance to scream.

Huang Xiaolong held no respect for the members of the Revered River Divine Sect. As such, there was no reason for him to show any mercy.

“What?!” Sui Ceng and the female disciple revealed dumbfounded looks as they stared at the sight before them.

Luckily, or unluckily for them, they managed to react quickly as all the members of the Revered River Divine Sect surrounded Huang Xiaolong and the little phoenix.

“How dare you kill a disciple from my divine sect?!” Sui Ceng roared with killing intent spilling from his eyes. “Brat, you must be tired of living! You....”

Too bad for him Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab him before he was done speaking. Like grabbing a duck by the neck, Huang Xiaolong raised him into the air.

“How dare...?” Sui Ceng stared at Huang Xiaolong with a terrified gaze and tremors ran through his heart.

He was astounded that as a Tenth Order Sovereign, Huang Xiaolong was able to suppress a First Order Venerable such as himself! The other party was strong to the point where he couldn’t even lift a finger to defend himself! However, he was angrier that someone had dared to move against him!

The other disciples of his sect were enraged when they saw that their senior brother was captured by the enemy.

“Release Senior Brother Sui Ceng at once!” The female disciple, Wu Weiwei, screamed. “Let me tell you right now! Senior Brother Sui Ceng is the personal disciple of Elder Chen Shaokang of the Revered River Divine Sect! If you dare to harm a single hair on his head, your entire family and sect will be dragged to hell with you!”

The other disciples glared at Huang Xiaolong, hoping that he would release their senior brother at once.

“Chen Shaokang?!” Huang Xiaolong furrowed his brows. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“That’s right! He’s an elder of our Revered River DIvine Sect!” Wu Weiwei snapped, “I am the young lady of the sect’s enforcement hall and you can’t escape from our divine sect if you harm Senior Brother Sui Ceng!”

As she raged on about her identity and status in the sect, Huang Xiaolong tightened his grip on Sui Ceng. A trace of divine flame appeared from his body and turned the man into a pile of ashes.

Wu Weiwei and the other disciples stared at Huang Xiaolong with a dumbfounded expression as they alternated their gazes between the youngster before them and the pile of ash scattering in the wind.

The other party actually killed Sui Ceng!

“You... you....” Wu Weiwei pointed at Huang Xiaolong, and she was at a loss of words. She wasn’t angry. Instead, it felt as though a bomb had gone off in her head as terror clouded her mind.

“Who’s Chen Shaokang? I’ve never heard of him.” Huang Xiaolong stared at her with an indifferent expression and continued, “By the way, I hate those people who point and curse at me.”

Wu Weiwei stared at him with her jaws agape. Even though she didn’t believe that the youngster would kill the young lady of the enforcement hall of the Revered River Divine Sect, she didn’t dare to test it out. She hastily withdrew her arm and placed it obediently by her side.

“My father and Elder Chen Shaokang are nearby!” Wu Weiwei glared at Huang Xiaolong as a trace of hope ignited in her eyes. “You won’t be able to escape after killing Senior Brother Sui!”

Huang Xiaolong nearly yawned when he heard what she said. “If I wanted to escape, I would have already ran. Go call your father and whatever elder you call him. I’m going to remain on the island for several more days.”

Shooting a final glare at Huang Xiaolong, Wu Weiwei grabbed the disciples of the Revered River Divine Sect and fled.

“Hold up. I allowed you to call for backup, not them.” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Before Wu Weiwei could question him, the tiny chaos axe appeared in the air and slammed against the group of disciples. In an instant, more than a dozen disciples fell from the skies.

Looking at her companions, who were slaughtered by the youngster before her, the blood drained from her face. A different type of fear formed in her eyes.

Under the influence of the dread she felt for Huang Xiaolong, she disappeared into the distance.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with her, and he continued to travel towards the northern regions of the island.

A day later, Huang Xiaolong stood at the peak of a mountain as he stared at the patch of desolate wasteland beneath him.

In the space above the wasteland, balls of concentrated frigid devil qi swirled and danced around.

Huang Xiaolong released his divine soul and covered the lands. After checking out his surroundings, he rode on the Rainbow Phoenix and charged into the desolate wasteland.

Before he got far, a ball of frigid devil qi brushed over his head and a shadowy figure rushed towards him with the intention of killing him.

As it approached, it was slapped away by a single palm from Huang Xiaolong.

As the shadow smashed into the ground, Huang Xiaolong saw its true appearance. It was a black leopard, and it resembled a dangerous black devil beast.

“Black Shadow...?”

It was a special type of black devil beast that had the transformation ability. Its speciality was its ability to hide, and its terrifying speed.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t tangle himself with it as he continued his journey.

Several hours later...

He stopped in the space above the wasteland. Blade qi soared into the skies as a figure who was wrapped in blade qi tore through the skies. Wherever the blade qi swept past, a black devil beast would fall.

More than a hundred black devil beasts were slain in the blink of an eye.

When they were all dead, the figure finally stopped moving as the blade qi in the air dissipated.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the man who was as thin as a skeleton and greeted, “White Boned Blade Devil.”

The man had dark green eyes, and his face was completely devoid of blood.

As Yu Dongyuan stared at Huang Xiaolong, it didn’t take long for him to lose interest in the weakling before him. He soon turned to stare at the Rainbow Phoenix as a smile lit up on his face. “Excellent mount!”

Even though he didn’t recognize the Rainbow Phoenix, he knew that it wasn’t ordinary.

“Are you a disciple of the Holy Gate here to kill me?” Yu Dongyuan casually asked.

“That’s right.”

A chuckle escaped his lips. “There were several disciples who accepted the mission to hunt me down. However, I’m still as fine as can be! None of the disciples from the Holy Gate managed to survive their encounter with me. All of them turned into ghosts under my blade!” Raising the White Boned Devil Blade in his arm, Yu Dongyuan continued, “You shall be number twenty three!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at him with a placid expression. “Sorry to disappoint you, but I’ll kill you and hang your head in the headquarters of the Holy Gate.”

“Hahaha! What qualifications do you have to take me down?! You’re a mere Tenth Order Sovereign! Do you really think you’re Jiang Tian, Zheng Yongjia, or Wu Shi?!”

As a mid-Third Order Venerable, he was extremely confident in his abilities. Moreover, his saint attributes weren’t low. His Saint godhead and Saint bloodline ranked pretty high up the ladder, and he was comparable to the Holy Princes. Even a Holy Prince at the same cultivation level as him wouldn’t be able to take him down with absolute certainty, much less a Tenth Order Sovereign like Huang Xiaolong!
