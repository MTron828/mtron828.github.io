Chapter 2228: Laughable!

When Zhang Haochen and Prince Qian heard the jeers from those surrounding them, the look of despair on their faces became even more apparent. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Huang Xiaolong had left the Prince Qian Manor in the past, his strength was indeed a little eye-catching. However, Prince Qian was naturally able to notice that he was only at the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Even if Huang Xiaolong was hiding his strength, he should at the very most be an Emperor-level expert.

So what if he was an Emperor Realm expert? With the lineup they had to face, an Emperor was nothing!

“I’ll hand over the Treasure Tome to you guys! However, you need to let us leave!” Zhang Haochen hesitated for a moment, and he tried bargaining with the Tenth Order Emperor on the other side.

Of course, his offer was met with a sarcastic shake of the head. “We should let you leave? Do you not understand the situation you’re in? Do you really think that you will be able to leave after we have gone through so much trouble to capture you?”

Zhang Haochen’s face quickly turned pale.

“Zhang Haochen... Stop dreaming. Hurry up and hand the tome over!” Dong Zening continued, “If you force us to make a move, you will die a horrible death!”

Zhang Wenyue bit down on her lips, and she spoke up all of a sudden. “Young Master Huang has nothing to do with this. I’ll hand it over if you allow him to leave.”

Dong Zening felt his patience running out, and he snapped, “Who the f*ck cares about that b*stard? If you continue to waste my time...” Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong made his move. He raised a single hand and sent a slap flying towards Dong Zening.

A miserable shriek left Dong Zening’s lips as he was smashed into the ground by Huang Xiaolong. After forming a bottomless hole under them, the sound of his breathing stopped just like that, and he was turned into a human-shaped meat cake.

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong with a dumbfounded expression.

“Young Prince!” Those from the Prince Long Manor finally reacted after some time, and they quickly flew towards the hole in the ground to fish him out. When they arrived at the bottom, they realized that Dong Zening’s body was smashed so hard that it had fused into the ground.

Those surrounding Huang Xiaolong looked at each other as a trace of doubt flashed through their eyes.

As for the Tenth Order Emperor from the Beast Emperor Sect, he stared at Huang Xiaolong as a sneer formed on his face. “Brat, it seems like you’re pretty strong. Do you really think that you can play the hero to save the beauty in distress in this situation? Have you thought about the consequences of killing someone on my side in front of my face?!”

“I’ll torture you to death! Your death will be a more gruesome one than his!”

“Your idea of saving the beauty is interesting, but it’s too bad that you met me!”

He turned to face the experts behind him and he ordered, “Bring the kid here. Cut the flesh off his body one slash at a time. Scrape the tendons off his bones and refine his soul! Show him what it means to offend me!”

Sounds of acknowledgements quickly filled the air and a single expert from the Beast Emperor Sect started to approach Huang Xiaolong.

The person who appeared was a Seventh Order Emperor.

With the cultivation of a Seventh Order Emperor, one could move about unhindered in some smaller kingdoms! Even the Beast Emperor Sect had to pay attention to cultivate such a promising individual!

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to let him do his thing. Huang Xiaolong pressed down on the void before him, and the Seventh Order Emperor suffered from the same fate as Dong Zening. He was smashed into meat paste into the ground before anyone could react. When Huang Xiaolong made his move, the air didn’t fluctuate in the slightest. In fact, he didn’t even cause so much as a breeze to be swept up when he attacked!

Silence fell on the lands as the body of the Seventh Order Emperor was pushed into the depths of the earth.

Everyone who saw the scene felt as though a bomb had gone off in their heads.

Even Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian couldn’t help but stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock. They looked at him before staring at the hole in the earth beneath them. They didn’t dare to believe their eyes when they realized that the Seventh Order Emperor had taken his last breath.

This...?

The person who was crushed was an elder from the Beast Emperor Sect!

Even though Prince Qian had no idea how strong the other party was, he knew that any elder from the Beast Emperor Sect had to be a Seventh Order Emperor!

However, someone like that was killed by the youngster they called ‘Young Master Huang!’

Is this some sort of performance they are putting up to mess with people?!

Prince Qian suddenly came up with a conspiracy theory. Huang Xiaolong was in cahoots with the other side!

“You...,” the high elder from the Beast Emperor Sect finally reacted after he got over his shock. A trace of rage flashed through his eyes, and he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “You killed him?! How dare you kill an expert from my Beast Emperor Sect?!”

“Expert from the Beast Emperor Sect?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. He thought about Song Shaokang he had crossed paths with in the Revered Fragrance Trading Company, and a smile formed on his lips. There was a trace of mockery on his face as he said, “I wonder if your Young Lord, Song Shaokang, has arrived in the lightning grounds...”

The members of the Beast Emperor Sect widened their eyes as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“You... Are you an acquaintance of our young lord?” A look of doubt flashed past the face of the high elder as he asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as he didn’t intend to hide his intentions. “That’s right! I know him! If he’s here, it’ll save me a lot of trouble! I’m thinking of killing him!”

When they heard what he said, everyone from the Beast Emperor Sect burst out laughing. However, there was a trace of cold light in their eyes as they glared at Huang Xiaolong. “So you’re someone who holds a grudge against our young lord! How can a tiny shrimp-like you form hatred with our young lord? What a joke!”

Before anyone could react, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he appeared before the high elder from the Beast Emperor Sect.

Shock filled the face of the high elder. Before he could make a move to teach the youngster before him a lesson, Huang Xiaolong had already grabbed him by the neck. Like he was lifting a little chicken, Huang Xiaolong looked at the high elder with a placid expression on his face. “Joke? Do I look like I’m laughing?”

“What?!” When everyone saw how the high elder of the Beast Emperor Sect was unable to lift a finger when he was grabbed by Huang Xiaolong, they felt as though their eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. A tremor ran through their body when they realized that things were going south.

The experts of the Beast Emperor Sect were the most affected as their bodies stiffened and fear clouded their eyes.

As for Zhang Wenyue, her jaws dropped as she formed a cute little circle with her tiny lips.

Zhang Haochen and Prince Qian felt their minds going blank.

When the high elder of the Beast Emperor Sect realized that he wasn’t Huang Xiaolong’s opponent, a look of terror appeared in his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak, but Huang Xiaolong tightened his grip around his neck. No matter how hard the high elder tried, he failed to say a single word.

“Isn’t this a joke? Wasn’t I joking? Laugh. Why aren’t you laughing?” A chilly light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he clenched his fist. The high elder’s throat was crushed in an instant and Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste time as he shattered the other party’s body with a single punch. A bloody mist filled the air, and everyone around them was covered in the high elder’s blood.

As droplets of fresh blood dripped down the faces of everyone present, not a single one of them dared to wipe it off.

A stench assaulted Huang Xiaolong’s nostrils all of a sudden and when he turned to look at the source, he realized that it was someone whose pants were dripping yellow liquid.

Of course, he didn’t say anything about it and no one dared to speak in his presence.

Even the three on his side didn’t dare to say a word.

Just like that, a strangely silent atmosphere was formed.

“Young Lady Zhang, how do you want to deal with them?” Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Zhang Wenyue all of a sudden and asked. “You can decide on how you want to deal with them.”

Zhang Wenyue nearly swallowed her tongue in fright as she stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. “Me?”

Everyone couldn’t help but turn their gazes to her. In an instant, no one bothered with their status as they fell to their knees to beg for mercy from this Tenth Order God King in front of them!

“Why don’t you let them go?” Seeming moved by their pitiful appearances, Zhang Wenyue suggested.

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he heard her decision. “Since you have decided to let them leave, I’ll let them go.” In fact, he was too lazy to deal with all of them. Not to mention that they were Emperors at most.

“Since the Young Lady has pardoned you, why are you not thanking her? After you show your gratitude, scram!”

Everyone turned to Zhang Wenyue in unison as they thanked them both. As soon as they said their thanks, they fled as quickly as they could.
