Chapter 2385: Meeting the Members of the Clear Snow Palace Again

Before Huang Xiaolong could approach the city, a beam of light pierced into the skies, and several figures charged out towards Huang Xiaolong’s party. They were precisely the True Saint Realm experts of the Blue Whale Race, the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, and the Qianyuan Holy Gate!

Adding them all together, there were more than thirty True Saints!

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected for so many True Saints to come. A sneer formed on his lips. Huang Xiaolong knew that the true reason they were there was for his Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast!

If not for his beast, they wouldn’t have activated so many True Saints to hunt him down!

The faces of Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage changed the moment they saw the terrifying line-up of True Saints. Even though their enemies were all in the First Heaven True Saint Realm, the three of them were definitely incapable of fighting thirty enemies!

Whatever the case, it was too late for them to retreat.

In a flash, the experts on the other side surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s party, cutting off all routes of retreat.

The other members under the True Saint Realm moved as well. More than three hundred thousand members surrounded the three of them.

Sweeping his gaze across everyone present, Huang Xiaolong wore an indifferent face.

“Brat, I bet you never thought that we would wait for you in the city!” A cold sneer resounded through the air. “After killing so many members of my Blue Whale Race, it’s time for you to die! Don’t even think of escaping!”

The person who spoke was Lan Meihui of the Blue Whale Race.

“Brat, where’s that beast of yours? Call it out now!” A True Saint from the Six Eyed Race growled.

“That’s right! Call it out now!” Another True Saint from the Snake Emperor Holy Gate sneered. “You’re just a mere Venerable. How dare you bring a Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast around? You’re not worthy! Hand it over or we’ll make you suffer a fate worse than death!”

True Saints yelled over each other, and they seemed to turn into neighbourhood ruffians.

Without a doubt, every single one of them was there for the profound beast.

“Hold it!” One of the True Saints from the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate yelled. “Are you Deputy Hall Master Chen?”

Since Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage had hidden their identities with some sort of secret art, no one managed to recognize them instantly.

A frown formed on Chen Zhi’s face.

“It’s you! Chen Zhi. How dare you betray the Holy Gate?!” The True Saint raged when he saw the expression on Chen Zhi’s face. “Where is Yu Jizhang?! Did you kill Chen Zifeng and the others?!”

The expression on everyone’s face changed as they stared at Chen Zhi.

“Chen Zhi? Who would have thought that you would betray the Holy Gate to submit to that brat! It’s no wonder the other members of the Holy Gate disappeared.... You definitely joined hands with the Departing Sword Sage to kill them all! With your strength, you couldn’t have dealt with them yourself!”

“I knew something was fishy when they disappeared.... The Departing Sword Sage isn’t strong enough to deal with them! So that’s what happened....”

“I wonder how that brat managed to convince Chen Zhi to betray the Holy Gate...? Did he tempt Chen Zhi with holy artifacts?!”

Discussions filled the air in an instant.

It was clear that Chen Zhi’s addition to Huang Xiaolong’s team shocked them all.

The experts and disciples of the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate glared at Chen Zhi with looks of hatred.

“Chen Zhi, are you going to surrender yourself or are we going to have to make a move?” The True Saint Realm expert from the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate growled “If you take the brat down now and return with us, we will plead for mercy on your behalf. Otherwise, you know what we do to traitors....”

In the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, all traitors would have their souls refined. True Saints would have their bodies destroyed as their holy souls were extracted. They would be thrown into a refinement chamber to be tortured for all eternity.

Chen Zhi’s expression changed, but he soon regained his calm. In the Profound River, he had long expected his day to come.

However, he had still chosen to side with Huang Xiaolong.

His decision wasn’t merely based on the fact that Huang Xiaoong had planted grandmist holy spiritual mark in his body.

Staying silent, he took a step forward and stood before Huang Xiaolong. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Seeing Chen Zhi’s behavior, the True Saint from the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate raged. “Fine! Chen Zhi, you shall suffer the consequence for your betrayal!”

Flames surrounded his body as they tuned into various manifestations.

Seeing as the battle was about to begin, the various experts retrieved their weapons.

A cold expression remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Since they were asking for it, he didn’t mind going on a killing spree!

Even though there were more than thirty True Saints on their side, Huang Xiaolong had the Darkness Holy Ring and the Winged Dragon Flying Ship!

“Die!” A spear pierced towards Huang Xiaolong and Chen Zhi, marking the start of the assault.

A white glow tore through the skies before Huang Xiaolong could make a move as a miserable shriek rang through the skies. The True Saint Realm expert, who wielded the spear, retreated with a face marked with fear.

Seeing the change in situation, everyone didn’t know how to react.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Turning around, he saw a group of female disciples flying towards him.

When everyone saw the group of newcomers, different emotions swept through them.

Experts of the Clear Snow Palace were there! The people leading the group were the three beauties of the palace!

From afar, Lin Xiaoying looked at Huang Xiaolong and revealed an adorable smile. In response, Huang Xiaolong could only smile bitterly. He hadn’t expected for the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace to show up at the crucial moment.

Seeing the members of the Clear Snow Palace, no one dared to make a move.

“What’s the meaning of this?!” A True Saint from the Six Eyed Race raged.

“What?” Lin Xiaoying glanced at him from the corner of her eye. “Thirteen is my man.” Realizing that her wording was a little too ambiguous, she hastily changed her phrasing. “He’s someone on our side!”

Everyone stared at each other without making a sound.

A long time ago, they had heard that Lin Xiaoying was saved by the man before them with a Vitality Rejuvenating Pill.

“Why are you still here?” Lin Xiaoying’s clear voice rang through the air, and those who were there to kill Huang Xiaolong stared at each other silently.

All of a sudden, the expert behind Lin Xiaoying released her aura and a True Saint’s might enveloped everyone present. Those who surrounded Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but retreat.

“Mid-level True Saint!”

The expert following behind Lin Xiaoying was actually a mid-level True Saint!

“Fine!” The True Saints of the Blue Whale Race were the first to retreat. Everyone else quickly followed and in the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong’s party was left all alone.
