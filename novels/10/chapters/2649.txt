Chapter 2650: Return

This sudden streak of light shot straight into Huang Xiaolong’s body faster than lightning. Neither Huang Xiaolong nor Fei Yanzi reacted in time when it appeared.

The shock Fei Yanzi felt was greater than Huang Xiaolong. She, Feitian Longpeng, and also her father, Fei Wushuang had read this ancient record in the past, but none of them had encountered any strange light flying out.

But she had seen the streak of light just as Huang Xiaolong had turned to the first page.

Fei Yanzi stared dazedly at Huang Xiaolong.

But Huang Xiaolong was staring at the page with feverish eyes.

He turned to the second page as he was done with reading the first page. Once again, another streak of light flew out from the page and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body. Moreover, this second streak of light was brighter than the first.

On the third page, the light was like blazing flames.

On the fourth page, the light’s brightness intensified further.

Huang Xiaolong read on, flipping one page after another until he was done reading. One after another, on every page he turned, a streak of light from the new page would enter his body. As time passed, Huang Xiaolong could feel there was an unfamiliar energy awakening in his body. It was as if something was breaking out from its restraints.

From Fei Yanzi’s angle, she could see that the golden dragon phantom had appeared behind Huang Xiaolong, and with each additional streak of light, the phantom dragon became more solid, and more life-like.

The entire golden dragon phantom seemed to have a life of its own like a real entity instead of just a phantom.

The ancient record had a total of one hundred pages. Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong had reached the ninety-ninth page, but no matter how he tried, he could not turn to the last page!

Despite using his holy energy, circulating the powers of his three saint godheads, he still failed to turn to the one-hundredth page.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected this.

This is?! Huang Xiaolong turned to Fei Yanzi with a puzzled expression.

Fei Yanzi responded with a bitter smile as she explained, “This page, both my father and I can’t turn it over. No one knows what is recorded on the last page, but my father guessed that the last page may contain a technique or a shocking secret left behind by the God of Creation. As for how to read it, and what conditions are required to read it, we really don’t know about that.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows scrunched together at her answer.

He had a strong feeling that something very important was on the final page. It could be related to his true identity and origins.

“How did your father get this ancient record?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking.

Fei Yanzi never thought of hiding it from Huang Xiaolong and answered frankly, “My father got it from one of his adventures at the World River. If I am not mistaken, he found this ancient record from the World River’s Dragon Fish Race’s treasury. My father sneaked into the Dragon Fish Race’s treasury and found this ancient record in the most hidden place in the treasury and took it away. It was said that after the Dragon Fish Race’s old ancestor learned about it, he was outraged. Perhaps, the Dragon Fish Race’s old ancestor knows the secret on the last page.”

A thought flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Dragon Fish Race?

At the end of the Alien Lands was where the World River began. Within the World River area, lived numerous sea races, and similar to the alien races on land, there were also royal families amongst the sea races. The Dragon Fish Race was one of the sea races’ royal families. Furthermore, the Dragon Fish Race royal family’s overall strength definitely ranked in the top three, which was equivalent to the Alien Lands’ Myriad Origin Race.

Since there was a possibility of learning the secret on the last page from the Dragon Fish Race’s old ancestor, then Huang Xiaolong was bound to make that trip to the World River no matter what. Not to mention that he had already planned to go to the World River sometime in the future, wanting to see what was at the end of the World River, and if there was a road linking to another world.

Huang Xiaolong then requested to take the ancient record away. Fei Yanzi was reluctant but agreed in the end. Although the Creation Record’s last page contained a big secret, it was useless since the Flying Heaven Race could not read it. Placed with the Flying Heaven Race, the records were nothing more but useless papers.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t take something for nothing. In return for taking the Creation Record, he gave Fei Yanzi a grand dao jade stone and a huge amount of holy herbs and holy pills as compensation.

To the Flying Heaven Race, the Creation Record was nothing more than useless papers, but to Huang Xiaolong, it was of utmost importance.

Coming out from the Flying Heaven’s bibliotheca, Huang Xiaolong separated from Fei Yanzi and returned to his palace, where he focused on studying the Creation Record. He discovered that when he spurred his bloodline power and channeled it into the Creation Record, small spheres of light would emerge from the ancient record and enter his body. His body felt extremely comfortable when came in contact with these lights.

But to Huang Xiaolong’s sore disappointment, he still failed to open the last page.

A day later, after using all the methods he could think of, Huang Xiaolong still could not open the last page, so he gave up.

Early the next day, Fei Yanzi, Feitian Longpeng, and a few others came by Huang Xiaolong’s place to discuss the journey back to the Otherworldly Mansion.

The stage competition for the Mansion’s young master position this time around was a grand event for the entire Alien Lands. Hence, Fei Yanzi, as the Flying Heaven Race’s patriarch, was going to travel to the Otherworldly Mansion to spectate the competition.

Of course, there was another important factor for making this trip—Huang Xiaolong!

“Yuan Qianxing!” As he stood high in the air, Huang Xiaolong said the name icily as he looked in the direction of the Otherworldly Mansion.

Fei Yanzi had told him that Yuan Qianxing’s strength had risen exponentially in these years, and he had reached perfection in his Return to Origin grand dao art.

Currently, the whole Alien Lands, and nearly all alien races’ royal families leaned towards Yuan Qianxing. Everyone was confident that Yuan Qianxing would win the Mansion’s young master position.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Yanzi, and Feitian Longpeng set off to return to the Otherworldly Mansion.

However, for their journey this time, they boarded Fei Yanzi’s personal Swallow Flight instead of the Flying Heaven Holy Ship. The Swallow Flight was a dao artifact forged with feathers fallen from her true body after entering Primal Ancestor Realm. Its speed left the Flying Heaven Holy Ship in the dust.

With its wings spread open, from end to end, the flying ship was the size of a small city. Huang Xiaolong stood on the deck, letting the winds blow at him as he combed through his thoughts. Perhaps, I can inquire about the Tree of Grand Dao from Long Shentian and Mo Zhi after the battle competition ends.

Although there was still time before Zi Dongping and Chan Yuli’s impending battle, the sooner he found the Dao Fruit, the faster Zi Dongping’s injuries could heal, and that would help him prepare for the battle.

On top of that, if there was more than one Dao Fruit, it would be a great opportunity for his cultivation to break through as well. Ideally, he could enter the Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm from the Fifth Heaven True Saint realm, and at that time, would he need to fear that Myriad Origin Race’s old monster?

He learned from Fei Yanzi that the Myriad Origin Race’s old ancestor was a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

Because the Swallow Flight flying ship did need anyone at the helm, it left Huang Xiaolong, Fei Yanzi, and Feitian Longpeng free to cultivate inside the cultivation rooms onboard.

Several months passed, and they finally entered the Otherworldly Mansion’s territory.

The moment Huang Xiaolong stepped into the Otherworldly Mansion, Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wangfeng, Yao Ji, and others got the news.

“Your Highness’ foresight is incredible. Huang Xiaolong has really returned.” Yuan Wangfeng was grinning as he flattered Yuan Qianxing, “It looks like he’s aware that he won’t be able to run even if he wants to, and he can’t hide either. So in the end, he could only return and accept his fate.”

“It’s merely futile resistance.” Yuan Qianxing sneered in contempt, “I heard that Fei Yanzi came with him?”

Yao Ji rushed to answer, “Fei Yanzi has bad judgment, taking the eye of a fish for a pearl. She would soon regret her choice. When Senior Brother Qianxing rises to the Mansion’s young master position, she would come begging on her knees to climb up Senior Brother Qianxing’s bed.”

Yuan Qianxing was smitten with Fei Yanzi at first sight, and he had professed his feelings to Fei Yanzi on the spot in front of everyone, but Fei Yanzi had rejected him. This matter had become a thorn in Yuan Qianxing’s heart.

Upon hearing Yao Ji’s words, a feverish light glimmered in Yuan Qianxing’s eyes.
