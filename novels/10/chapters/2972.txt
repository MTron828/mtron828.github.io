Chapter 2973: Ten-Seeded Blue Lotus

When Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon saw the Black Shadow Devil, their vigilance was raised to the highest as if they were facing a great enemy.

In their eyes, the Black Shadow Devil was a bigger ‘headache’ than Old Monster Flame.

Though there was a ‘Black Shadow Devil’ in front of them, who knew which space dimension the real Black Shadow Devil was hiding in. The black shadow in front of them was merely a reflection projected through different layers of space.

This was the power of absolute space, capable of hiding the main body in another space. Yet, it could reflect the shadow of the main body into this space, and the real body could control the shadow’s movements to even attack without a lapse in time as if the shadow was a real person. The problem was that the shadow was a formless entity which made it hard to destroy!

Unless one could drag the person’s real body out was harder than rising to the heavens in a single stride in order to do so. Who could tell the main body’s exact location?

This was why Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon were warier of the Black Shadow Devil.

When all the big shot’s attention was on the black shadow, the black shadow spoke, “The ownership of the Huang Long Armor, Tree of Beginning, and everything else, depends on each person’s capability!”

No one spoke in objection to the Black Shadow Devil’s statement. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

More top-tier creeds’ patriarchs arrived after the Black Shadow Devil. Their arrivals also caused a stir in the crowd. A few days later, the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng, Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun, Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingyue, and seven other patriarchs also arrived with a large group of experts from their own creeds. The difference was that Poison Bodach’s group had ill-intent towards Huang Xiaolong, whereas, Bi Cheng’s group was there to protect Huang Xiaolong.

The ten top-tier creeds’ patriarchs faced Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, Black Shadow Devil, and the rest.

Poison Bodach sneered loudly at their stance, “Bi Cheng, I advise you not to get involved in Huang Xiaolong’s matter, or it won’t be long before the ten creeds are razed to the ground.”

Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng harrumphed coldly, “Huang Xiaolong is the Son of Creation, the son of heaven and earth, and you disrespected His Highness, the Son of Creation, and that is a crime of clan annihilation. Poison Bodach, it’s best you beg for mercy on your knees when you see His Highness later. Maybe he might consider sparing your lives!”

Before Poison Bodach could respond, a snort sounded from the Black Shadow Devil, “What’s the Son of Creation? He is no different than a fart to me! In my eyes, there is no such thing as the Son of Creation, much less the God of Creation. Once my absolute space power reaches perfection, I will be the world’s sovereign!”

“Black Shadow Devil, enough with your impudence!”

“Insolent, how dare you blaspheme the God of Creation!”

Wu Kun and Hu Qingyue both indignantly rebuked Black Shadow Devil. A powerful pressure with crushing momentum swept out from Wu Kun like a storm, frightening the surrounding experts. The weaker cultivators retreated far away in a panic.

Yet, the Black Shadow Devil wasn’t the slightest bit affected, and he went on sarcastically, “Blaspheme the God of Creation? Wu Kun, do you think Huang Long would be able to return to Huang Long World? He can’t save himself right now!”

“Can’t save himself?!”

Others exchanged baffled looks with their companions hearing that, unable to decipher the meaning of Black Shadow Devil’s words.

Bi Cheng’s face was extremely gloomy, “Black Shadow Devil, what do your words mean?

The only response Bi Cheng got was sinister chuckles.

A sharp light flashed across Bi Cheng’s eyes, and surging dragon qi from his body condensed into numerous sky dragons that attacked the Black Shadow Devil like an archenemy. The space around the Black Shadow Devil shredded into pieces, but to everyone’s astonishment, the black shadow remains intact, unaffected by Bi Cheng’s attack at all.

The black shadow ridiculed, “The vassal of the God of Creation doesn’t seem to be all that powerful. Bi Cheng, as Huang Long’s hound, all ten of you are excellent hounds, but unfortunately, your strength isn’t very good!”

Bi Cheng’s three pupils gleamed sharply. Just as he was about to launch another powerful attack, Wu Kun said to him, “Brother Bi Cheng, we don’t need to argue with people who hide and sneak all year round now. Wait till His Highness is safely out,” he reminded Bi Cheng to prioritize Huang Xiaolong’s matter.

Bi Cheng nodded and agreed after a long pause, “You’re right! Dealing with this kind of person lowers my status.”

Black Shadow Devil merely chuckled coldly, but his chuckles sent goosebumps down people’s neck. Still, he did not attack. He was clearly reserving his energy to fight when Huang Xiaolong came out.

Poison Bodach, Sword Venerable, and the Nine-headed Tree Demon couldn’t help feeling disappointed that a fight didn’t break out between the Black Shadow Devil and ten creeds.

……

Within the Blue Lotus Pond, Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic looking at the blue lotus in front of him. This blue lotus had eight bright and shiny golden lotus seeds on it! Eight-seeded blue lotus!

Eight-seeded

Huang Xiaolong reached out and held the eight-seeded blue lotus, and immediately sensed vigorous heaven and earth energy, grand dao energy, and a unique water energy.

Despite knowing that an eight-seeded blue lotus greatly exceeded a seven-seeded blue lotus, the moment Huang Xiaolong held the eight-seeded blue lotus he knew how vastly different the heaven and earth energy, grand dao energy, and water energy were between the two.

This amount is comparable to a Fruit of Beginning, Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

An eight-seeded blue lotus was comparable to one Fruit of Beginning! What about a nine-seeded blue lotus? Will it be comparable to more Fruits of Beginning? What about ten-seeded then?! Huang Xiaolong could barely suppress his excitement as his imagination ran off like a wild horse.

With his first eight-seeded blue lotus in hand, Huang Xiaolong continued further in.

…

A month later.

Huang Xiaolong came to a space brightly illuminated by silvery golden light, and the space inside was filled with blue lotus nectar!

It was a sky full of suspended drops of blue lotus nectar, like a great chandelier of yellow and white diamonds!

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely bedazzled at this moment, and even someone who was usually steadfast like him dazed for a moment looking around him. How many drops of blue lotus nectar are inside here?! Several hundred thousand? More than a million?!

In the last month, Huang Xiaolong had found more than twenty thousand drops of blue lotus nectar, but his harvest was nothing compared to the amount of blue lotus nectar inside this space.

How much wealth would that all be when considering the blue lotus nectar in this space after calculating based on the market price of one drop at one hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins?

Probably no one could remain calm looking at the amount of blue lotus nectar in this space. Huang Xiaolong actually spotted several hundred fist-sized golden blue lotus nectar!

And these several hundred drops of fist-sized blue lotus nectar were gathered in one place! These were gathered around a dozen stalks of blue lotuses!

Nine-seeded blue lotuses!

And the blue lotus at the center was a ten-seeded blue lotus!

In a single step, Huang Xiaolong had reached where the dozen of blue lotuses were. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t tear his eyes away from the ten-seeded blue lotus, and the blue lotus gave him an indescribable feeling, as if it was the most gorgeous and magnificent being in the world. More importantly, Huang Xiaolong felt a familiar power from the ten-seeded blue lotus!

Absolute frost power!

That’s right, absolute frost power!

Absolute frost power as vast as an ocean!

This!

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply as this ten-seeded blue lotus actually has the power of absolute frost!

This was beyond his wildest imagination.

Huang Xiaolong finally looked away a while later. Initially, he had planned to find a place to refine all the blue lotuses he had found, but there was no such need now. He decided to enter seclusion in this space, and directly refined the dozen of nine-seeded blue lotuses and that ten-seeded blue lotus.
