But Huang Xiaolong could understand Cangqiong Old Man’s considerations and difficulties.

Cangqiong Sacred Land had just been established, and its foundation was far from stable. Thus, it required several Primal Ancestor experts to front a strong facade. For example, for some families’ disciples, wanting to join Cangqiong Sacred Land, would probably turn away as fast as they could if they heard Cangqiong Sacred Land only had one Primal Ancestor, Cangqiong Old Man himself.

If there was no steady stream of new enrollments into Cangqiong Sacred Land, how was it going to expand and grow strong?

Moreover, a few more Primal Ancestor experts was also a deterrence factor to other sacred lands in the vicinity. At the very least, Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land would be more wary to make any move.

At this time, one of the Cangqiong Holy Ground’s disciples said to Huang Xiaolong on an impulse, “Young Lord, you don’t know how arrogant Chen Birui’s group is in our Cangqiong Sacred Land. They order our sacred land’s disciples around by relying on their strength and numbers, and if we disobey, they strike us directly!”

“It is as if they are the masters of our sacred land!”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed as he listened.

Chen Birui is flagrant to that degree?!

Generally speaking, worshiped experts hired with a large sum of money by some forces did not hold real authority. Therefore, they did not have the right to issue any orders.

Chen Birui and the others were Primal Ancestor Realm experts. The power of a Primal Ancestor’s palm strike was not a light punishment for True Saint Realm disciples. Clearly, Chen Birui’s group often abused their status.

“That’s right, Young Lord. Some of their orders are simply troubling, making things difficult for us. They ordered us to search for things like the red tortoise bead, the divine holy spiritual bead, and the Hundred Leaves Thistle. These things are rare in the entire Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. You can’t even find these treasures inside the Tang Dragon Sacred Land, and Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s treasuries. Then, where are we supposed to find these items?”

Another Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciple also voiced out his grievances to Huang Xiaolong, “Also, they always put a deadline of one to two years to complete the tasks. If we fail to complete our tasks when the deadline arrives, they punish us!”

“Young Lord, there’s more. Along with Chen Birui’s group, their disciples are also extremely flagrant. Whoever dares to defy their orders will definitely suffer.”

Another Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciple added vehemently, “Chen Birui’s personal disciple, Li Fuyang, is the most hateful and does not treat others as humans. He’s always targeting the sacred land’s female disciples!”

“And he’s always entangling with Senior Sister Xueru!” Another disciple growled angrily, feeling helpless at the same time.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Wang Xueru.

Wang Xueru nodded, attesting that these disciples were telling the truth. She merely felt a little awkward when one of them told Huang Xiaolong that Li Fuyang was causing trouble for her.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed dangerously, and he indicated the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples to continue.

Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, Duan Feng, and Fei Yanzhi were enraged after listening to these disciples’ encounters with Chen Birui’s group’s wanton behavior in the Cangqiong Sacred Land.

After seeing the coldness on Huang Xiaolong’s face, Wang Xueru hesitated slightly, but decided to speak, “Chen Birui has some background, and it is said that he was once a disciple of Saint Devil Sacred Land. He committed a crime and was expelled from Saint Devil Sacred Land.”

“Oh, an ex-Saint Devil Sacred Land’s disciple?” This stoked Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity.

Although it hadn’t been long since he had arrived in the Divine Tuo Holy World, he had a rough understanding of Saint Devil Sacred Land’s situation.

Within Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, there were at least eighteen thousand sacred lands. Amongst these eighteen thousand sacred lands, the strongest one was none other than Saint Devil Sacred Land!

Saint Devil Heavenly Cave took it’s name after Saint Devil Sacred Land.

Describing Saint Devil Sacred Land as strong was an understatement. Not only Cangqiong Sacred Land, but even stronger holy grounds like Tang Dragon Sacred Land, and Freezing Desert Sacred Land were nothing but bugs in the eyes of the Saint Devil Sacred Land.

Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land, each, had twenty-plus Primal Ancestor experts, but Saint Devil Sacred Land alone had over three thousand and six hundred Primal Ancestor experts!

Over three thousand and six hundred Primal Ancestors! For Cangqiong Sacred Land, this was way out of their reach, and beyond the scope of their imagination. It was simply a fantasy, but in the Divine Tuo Holy World, it was actually very common.

Although Saint Devil Sacred Land had yet to conquer the entire Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, many holy grounds’ masters within Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, referred to the Saint Devil Sacred Land’s master as Lord Saint Devil.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised that Chen Birui was a Saint Devil Sacred Land’s disciple in the past.

“Despite being expelled from Saint Devil Sacred Land, it remains a fact that he was once a Saint Devil Sacred Land’s disciple. As long as he doesn’t go overboard, most of the time, the Master keeps a close eye on him,” said Wang Xueru.

“Senior Brother, when we reach Cangqiong Sacred Land, if Chen Birui offends you, will you…?” Wang Xueru didn’t finish her words.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Wang Xueru, and then looked away and stated briefly, “I know what to do.”

Wang Xueru was worried that he would burst Chen Birui’s body with a punch, indirectly offending the Saint Devil Sacred Land. But Huang Xiaolong’s principle had always been that if others don’t provoke him, he won’t provoke them.

He wouldn’t worry if a conflict were to arise with Saint Devil Sacred Land. At the moment, he was only wary of Dao Sovereign experts, but there was no Dao Sovereign existence in Saint Devil Sacred Land.

Cangqiong Sacred Land was only a stone’s throw away from the Ice Blue Sacred Land. Therefore, it didn’t take Huang Xiaolong’s group long to reach Cangqiong Sacred Land.

Although Cangqiong Old Man had spent several hundred years of efforts to build, expand, and maintain Cangqiong Sacred Land, the sacred land’s spiritual energy was trifling in comparison to the Ice Blue Sacred Land. In truth, the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s spiritual energy was thinner than the Peerless Sacred Land that they had descended on.

Then again, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Which sacred lands at the same level as the Peerless Sacred Land and Ice Blue Sacred Land did not have some foundation? These sacred lands had been established for many, many years, and naturally, the newcomer Cangqiong Sacred Land couldn’t compare to them.

Upon arriving at the Cangqiong Sacred Land, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and the others continued onwards in the direction of Cangqiong Sacred Land’s Cangqiong City.

On the way, they saw that most of the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s land were barren, and cities were a scarce sight. It could almost be described as dismal.

“It hasn’t been long since our Cangqiong Sacred Land was established. There aren’t many trading houses that come to open branches here yet, so the land looks a little empty.” Wang Xueru sounded a little embarrassed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. The Cangqiong Sacred Land had thin spiritual energy, and there were few disciples with not many clans and families. It was normal that not many trading houses would open branches there. But he believed that all of this would change very soon.

At that time, Cangqiong Sacred Land would have a big influx of people coming in from the four major directions.

Before long, they spotted the Cangqiong City’s outline on the horizon.

Although there were many barren lands in the Cangqiong Sacred Land, as Cangqiong Sacred Land’s main city, the Cangqiong City was quite lively where the main manor was located.

In addition to the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s disciples, Huang Xiaolong also saw many other sacred lands’ disciples, some big families’ flying ships, and rare mounts.

Wang Xueru had mentioned that Cangqiong Old Man often entered seclusion in recent years, so Huang Xiaolong did not allow her to contact Cangqiong Old Man to avoid disturbing him. Otherwise, the old man would be over the moon and even come out to welcome him if he knew that Huang Xiaolong had come over from the Cangqiong Holy World.

“Let’s enter the city.” Upon looking at the Cangqiong City, and thinking of his master Cangqiong Old Man, Huang Xiaolong’s spirits rose.
