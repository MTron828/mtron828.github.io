Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Silver Fox Commerce’s headquarters.

The little cow lamented nostalgically as she stepped into the Silver Fox Commerce’s headquarters, shaking her head and swaying her tail, “I have not been here for a long time, but everything is still the same. I wonder how that kid Bei Lengyang is doing?”

Huang Xiaolong knew that ‘Bei Lengyang’ was the Silver Fox Commerce’s President, but Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others didn’t. They assumed Bei Lengyang was just an ordinary disciple of Silver Fox Commerce, thus they did not show any surprise or concern upon hearing his name.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group stepped into the Silver Fox Commerce headquarters’ lobby, there were more than a few Emperor Palaces’ disciples there. There were even disciples from the Crimson Flames Emperor Palace!

“It’s the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord!” Suddenly, Fang Xuanxuan’s restrained exclamation sounded in Huang Xiaolong’s group’s ears when her gaze fell onto one of the young men in the lobby. This young lord was exuding an elegant noble air, clad in an eye-catching silvery white brocade robe.

The Brightness Emperor Palace!

Huang Xiaolong, Peng Xiao, and the rest of the group were surprised by Fang Xuanxuan’s exclamation.

Among the many Emperor Palaces in the Divine World, the Grandmist Emperor Palace was the undisputed number one, and at second was, no doubt, the Brightness Emperor Palace! After the Brightness Emperor Palace was the Fiend God Emperor Palace!

Even though the young man wearing the silver-white brocade robe was not the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple, he carried the identity of the Brightness Emperor Palace’s young lord. This identity carried more than enough weight.

This Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord was surrounded by various Emperor Palaces’ young lords, Emperor’s Disciples, and disciples.

Huang Xiaolong also noticed a young man clad in the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s disciple’s robe. However, the young man’s robe was slightly different compared to the Azure Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Zhao’s robe. A fire dragon’s pattern was embroidered on this young man’s robe.

Based on the fire dragon’s pattern on the young man’s robe, Huang Xiaolong quickly surmised that he was the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Fire Dragon Hall’s disciple, the Fire Dragon Emperor’s Disciple.

As Huang Xiaolong’s group appeared in the lobby, it attracted various Emperor Palaces’ disciples’ attention.

Fang Xuanxuan, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and Peng Xiao were all rare beauties, each having their own temperament. When they stepped into the lobby, eyes lit up instantly.

The Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord also looked over his shoulder towards the entrance. He walked towards Huang Xiaolong’s group upon seeing Fang Xuanxuan. Several Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Fire Dragon Hall’s disciples also followed behind him.

“Miss Fang.” The Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord smiled politely as he greeted, “Miss Fang is also here to participate in the Treasures Assembly?”

Treasures Assembly? There was confusion in Fang Xuanxuan’s eyes. She shook her head, “Greetings, Young Lord Lan, we didn’t come for the Treasures Assembly.”

The Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord Lan Zhifeng’s gaze swept over Peng Xiao, Li Lu, and Yao Chi’s faces, then back to Fang Xuanxuan. The smile on his face remained as he said, “Miss Fang, are these three Misses also disciples of Fortune Emperor Palace?” Finally, his gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong and he continued with doubts in his mind, “And is he your follower? Miss Fang, it seems your follower’s strength is a bit too weak.”

Follower?

Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, Li Lu, and Yao Chi froze in a daze.

Puff! Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao broke into laughter.

The sounds of their merry laughter depressed Huang Xiaolong greatly.

“No, no, he’s not my follower. He’s my Uncle Zhao’s disciple.” With great effort, Fang Xuanxuan controlled her laughter and clarified to Lan Zhifeng.

Uncle Zhao? A thought flashed in Lan Zhifeng’s mind, then his eyes widened slightly in surprise looking at Huang Xiaolong, and he blurted out, “You’re Huang Xiaolong?!”

The several disciples following Lan Zhifeng also showed surprise on their faces. In an instant, the lively lobby quieted down abruptly.

Although Huang Xiaolong had been cultivating in complete seclusion for the last decade, his battle with Wang Yongsen during the Fortune Emperor Palace’s apprenticeship ceremony had long spread through various Emperor Palaces. Even top Emperor Palace’s disciples like the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciples had heard that the Fortune Emperor Palace had a king of supreme godhead disciple!

After all, a king of supreme godhead disciple represented a lot of things. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had shown amazing talent and battle power, therefore, it was hard for these Emperor Palaces’ disciples not to have heard about Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised watching Lan Zhifeng’s surprise expression. He nodded and confirmed, “I am Huang Xiaolong.”

How could he deny his identity in this situation?

“I see, so it’s Brother Huang. I didn’t know your identity earlier, so please excuse my manners.” Lan Zhifeng cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong with a smiling face, and his tone and attitude were completely contrary from moments ago.

Even if Huang Xiaolong was an ordinary disciple, just due to the fact that he had a king of supreme godhead was sufficient reason for Lan Zhifeng to treat him with courtesy.

As Lan Zhifeng had made a proper excuse, it would make Huang Xiaolong look like a narrow-minded person if he showed dissatisfaction towards Lan Zhifeng for his earlier words. Thus Huang Xiaolong cupped his fists and returned Lan Zhifeng’s greeting, “It’s alright, Young Lord Lan is polite.”

At this time, several figures stepped out from the inner hall. One of them was the old man who was always by Bei Xiaomei’s side, protecting her.

When Bei Xiaomei had stayed for a month at the Fortune Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong had learned that Bei Xiaomei called this old man Elder Fu.

When Elder Fu came out, he casually looked around the lobby, and was inwardly surprised when he saw Lan Zhifeng standing together with Huang Xiaolong. Without missing a beat, he approached them.

“Elder Fu!”

The various Emperor Palaces’ young lords, Emperors’ Disciples, and other disciples greeted him respectfully.

Even the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Young Lord Lan Zhifeng respectfully greeted Elder Fu. One could see Elder Fu’s status was sufficiently high within the Silver Fox Commerce. Otherwise, Lan Zhifeng wouldn’t have shown such respect.

“I see Young Warrior Huang has come.” Elder Fu stopped in front of Huang Xiaolong and took the initiative to greet first. A smile softened his usually inexpressive face.

“Elder Fu.” Huang Xiaolong greeted him respectfully. Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others followed him and greeted Elder Fu with courtesy.

Elder Fu nodded at Huang Xiaolong, then said to Fang Xuanxuan, “Miss Fang has come as well.”

“Young Warrior Huang, our Second Miss has been nagging and asking about when you were going to come visit her. She was asking why you haven’t yet visited her, as she was expecting for you to be here more than once, since it’s been a decade since your last meeting. If you wouldn’t have shown up soon, our Second Miss would probably have run to the Fortune Emperor Palace.” Elder Fu complained bitterly to Huang Xiaolong.

When the surrounding Emperor Palaces’ male disciples heard Elder Fu’s words, all of them looked enviously at Huang Xiaolong. What fortune and luck to be able to attract the attention of the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss!

However, Huang Xiaolong also received four deathly gazes from Li Lu, Yao Chi, Peng Xiao, and Fang Xuanxuan, making him feel awkward. Huang Xiaolong tried to cover his embarrassment with a short laugh and said, “I have been in seclusion for over a decade, and exited not long ago. Right after that, I made my way here.”

“Our Second Miss is in the back hall. She will be very happy to know that you are here. If Young Warrior Huang has no other matters, why don’t you go say hello to our Second Miss?” Elder Fu asked Huang Xiaolong.

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong accepted his invitation.

Under Lan Zhifeng and others’ envious gazes, Elder Fu led Huang Xiaolong, Li Lu, Fang Xuanxuan, and the rest of his group into the inner hall.

After Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared into the inner hall, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Fire Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Yuan couldn’t resist from commenting out loud, “This Huang Xiaolong’s got quite the luck with the ladies!”

Lan Zhifeng suddenly asked Chen Yuan, “Isn’t your younger brother Chen Zhao chasing Fang Xuanxuan? But Fang Xuanxuan is now traveling around with Huang Xiaolong, and judging from what I saw, she’s quite close to Huang Xiaolong.”

The Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s Fire Dragon Emperor’s Disciple Chen Yuan frowned at Lan Zhifeng’s words but refuted, “Huang Xiaolong is Zhao Lei’s disciple. Zhao Lei and Fang Gan are good brothers, not to mention, Huang Xiaolong saved Fang Xuanxuan’s life. It’s nothing strange that she’s close to Huang Xiaolong.”

“Oh really?’ Lan Zhifeng smiled mysteriously, and let go of the topic. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

On the other side, Elder Fu led Huang Xiaolong and his group to the inner hall where they saw Bei Xiaomei. Bei Xiaomei was biting unenthusiastically into a spiritual fruit. When she saw Elder Fu, and Huang Xiaolong walking behind him, her face lit up as she shouted ecstatically, “Uncle!”
