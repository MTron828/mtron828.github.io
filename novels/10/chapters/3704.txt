Chapter 3705: Laying Down the Extermination Formation

Huang Xiaolong not only managed to comprehend the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes and break through to the peak of the grand completion stage. He also managed to understand a supreme art! When he finally processed the technique in his mind, he dubbed it the Universe Transformation Art!

The Universe Transformation Art consisted of the transformation and formation of all Thirteen Universes!

Even so, Huang Xiaolong only scraped the tip of the iceberg. The Universe Transformation Art he understood wasn’t complete!

He was confident that in time, he would be able to perfect the technique as his understanding of the mysteries of the universe became more solid!

Moreover, he discovered that the Universe Transformation Art could be used when he circulated all three great worlds.

Regaining his calm, Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave the Universe Boat immediately. Instead, he threw even more spiritual veins into the eye of the formation to produce universe source qi. He absorbed the qi as he circulated the technique.

As he had barely broken through to the peak of the grand completion stage, his foundation wasn’t solid enough. He planned to refine the universe source qi to slowly increase his power!

Even more time passed. This time, several hundred thousand years passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he realized that his strength wasn’t rising as quickly as before.

In the past, he would be able to increase his grand cosmos energy by several hundred million units in a hundred thousand years. Now, he only managed to increase it by a hundred million units in the same amount of time!

The higher his cultivation level went, the slower it became!

He also discovered that the speed at which he devoured universe source qi was tens of times faster when he circulated the Universe Transformation Art than when he used his three great arts previously!

He could refine several dozen strands of universe source qi in the span of a single day!

In the past, he only used a few hundred strands of universe-level spiritual qi when cultivating. Now, he used nearly twenty thousand of them!

Again, several hundred thousand years passed.

Huang Xiaolong eventually opened the third layer of restrictions.

Cultivating in the third level of restrictions, more than three million years passed.

Huang Xiaolong finally stopped as he looked at the universe source qi in the third layer. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he had no idea how many strands of universe-level spiritual veins he used. Most of them were of the peak and high-grade level and that was a monstrous amount of money.

He basically used up every single universe-level spiritual vein in the Unknown Space. The treasuries of the supreme overlords had been plundered by him, and he refined everything he could.

After three million years, he finally broke through to the 29 billion mark.

Of course, he barely crossed it.

As for the comprehension of the Nameless Devil Mirror, he managed to understand the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes to the next level. His understanding of the Universe Transformation Art was no longer as rough as it was in the past.

He understood one-tenth of the secrets behind the Thirteen Universes.

When he broke into the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm previously, he barely understood anything regarding the mysteries of the universe! Now, he knew a lot more!

Stepping out from the third layer of restrictions, Huang Xiaolong discovered that he underwent a terrifying change.

After learning the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes, Huang Xiaolong’s strength reached a whole new level. He was no longer the Huang Xiaolong of the past!

The instant he appeared, he received a message from the Ferocious Devil. He didn’t even have the time to summon the Dragon Overlord and the others when he received it.

The Ferocious Devil didn’t say much in the message. He only said that he wished to discuss matters regarding the Universe First Race with him.

Stepping into the main hall, Huang Xiaolong saw that the Ferocious Devil wasn’t the only one present. The Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen were all present.

The Dragon Overlord and the other two quickly approached Huang Xiaolong to welcome him.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Lord!”

A look of amazement flashed through the Ferocious Devil’s eyes when he saw Huang Xiaolong. Out of those present, he was the strongest individual! He was able to discover that Huang Xiaolong was completely different from before!

“Congratulations Fellow Cultivator Huang for breaking through to the peak of the grand completion stage.” The Ferocious Devil cupped his fists and smiled.

The Green Ghost felt his body trembling when he heard what the Ferocious Devil said.

The Dragon Overlord and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as surprise flashed in their eyes.

Huang Xiaolong’s creation of three great worlds was nothing special to those in the grand hall. The Ferocious Devil and Green Ghost heard of it in the past from Huang Xiaolong himself. Now that he entered the peak of the grand completion stage, wouldn’t it mean that his grand cosmos energy had broken through the 27 billion units mark?

“Congratulations, Lord!” The Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen laughed excitedly.

“Congratulations, Lord Huang Xiaolong.” The Green Ghost hesitated for a moment before changing the way he addressed Huang Xiaolong. In the past, he had always addressed Huang Xiaolong as a ‘fellow cultivator’. Now, it seemed as though he had to call Huang Xiaolong properly.

Huang Xiaolong thanked them as a smile formed on his face. “I was merely lucky when breaking through…”

Even though the Ferocious Devil could see that Huang Xiaolong had entered the peak of the grand completion stage, he couldn’t see that Huang Xiaolong had already broken through the 29 billion mark!

With the Universe Transformation Art, Huang Xiaolong could hide his strength easily!

After he took his seat, the Ferocious Devil spoke about the events that happened in the past millions of years.

None of the members of the Universe First Race entered the Unknown Space since the battle in the Devil Abyss. However, the Ferocious Devil could feel that the Universe First Race was cooking up something huge.

“Brother Devil, do you mean to say that the Universe First Race has already been laying down their grand formation to destroy the Thirteen Universes?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “If they complete their formation, they would be able to destroy the Thirteen Universes once again…”

The Ferocious Devil nodded slightly as a light flashed in his eyes. “That’s right. The moment they complete the formation, they would be able to destroy the Thirteen Universes for a second time! They will harvest the lives of those there like they are nothing! This time, they won’t allow anyone to escape! Even our Unknown Space will be destroyed in the process!”

The hearts of everyone in the hall sank.

“How can we stop them?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Even though I managed to discover that they’re laying down the formation, I am unable to discover which one of the thirteen kings is responsible for it…”
