Chapter 3629 – Someone Barged In

“Oh? Even the Limitless Master came…” Huang Xiaolong was slightly stunned.

Whatever the case, it wasn’t a bad thing for him. He decided to subdue the king of the Ocean Race along with the Limitless Master after he returned. Since the Limitless Master had entered the Sleepless Sea, he would save the trouble of dealing with him after returning.

As such, Huang Xiaolong got Zhou Chi and the others to keep a lookout on the Limitless Master.

“Oh? Sleepless City?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

Was the Limitless Master looking for the king of the Ocean Race?

Were they planning to work together?

That might really be the case. After all, the two of them were the overlords of the region. If they wanted to search for the treasure, the king of the Ocean Race would be the best person to look for it. The Limitless Master was the strongest in the region, and his strength would be indispensable when fighting for the treasure.

Perhaps, the Limitless Master already knew of the presence of the Three Gods Halberd!

“Alright. We’ll head over to the Sleepless City immediately!” Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yu Xiaohong and the others.

Summoning the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, they charged towards the city.

Huang Xiaolong accelerated the ship to its limit.

Along the way, he received countless reports from Zhou Chi and the others.

“The old ancestor of the Cao Family has also entered the Sleepless City!”

“The king of the Ocean Race gathered the old ancestors of the various ancient races. The old ancestors of the Jade Whale Race, Wei Ghost Race, and the other races have gathered in the city!”

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he read the reports.

Nice!

They’re all gathered in one place!

According to the reports, there were more than three thousand Gods of Creation gathered in the city.

As for those who exceeded 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy, there were nearly thirty of them!

That was basically all the top-tier experts in the Limitless Land!

When Yu Xiaohong, Qin Wei, Zheng Shen, and the others heard the number of people gathered in the Sleepless City, complicated emotions filled their hearts.

“Lord, I don’t think we should head to the city…” Zheng Shen muttered. “Even though you’re strong, we’re lacking in manpower! Shouldn’t we wait for them to split up before attacking?”

“That’s right… Lord, we should deal with them when the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race leave!” Qin Wei continued.

Huang Xiaolong might have the four of them who had crossed the 10 billion mark and nearly a dozen over half step Universe Gods, but they were nothing but ants before the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race!

“Relax. I’ll deal with it.”

To reassure them, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Universe Boat.

As soon as it appeared, the power of the universe covered the area. The giant boat filled up the entire sky above them and none of them could believe what they were seeing.

“Universe… Universe Boat?!” Yu Xiaohong gapsed in fright.

They knew that Huang Xiaolong had the Star Dragon Divine Tree, four Universe Origin Fires, and the Three Gods Halberd, but the shock when they discovered that the Universe Boat was also in his possession eclipsed everything they felt in the past.

That was the universe treasure that ranked first!

“That’s right. This isn’t an illusion.” Huang Xiaolong admitted. Keeping the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, he ushered them onto the Universe Boat. Activating the grand formation, they turned into a streak of light that flew towards the Sleepless City.

The Universe Boat traveled ten times faster than the Blue Dragon Flying Ship.

As the space around them started to twist, it took them several days to arrive in the vicinity of the city.

Huang Xiaolong quickly kept the Universe Boat.

“We… We’re here?!” Zheng Shen stared at the city in disbelief.

“Yeah.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and he started to walk towards the city. The city was on a full lockdown, and no one was allowed to enter the city. Experts of the various races patrolled the area, unwilling to let anything go wrong.

Huang Xiaolong waved his arm and deployed the Star Dragon Divine Tree immediately. He sealed off the entire space around the city.

Now that he wanted to deal with them, he wouldn’t allow anyone to escape. The Star Dragon Divine Formation was strong enough to stop anyone from escaping.

With the grand formation sealing off the space around the city, not even the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race would be able to escape. After all, they weren’t stronger than Huang Xiaolong.

With rays of starlight silently covering the area, it formed a giant spider web that stretched into the space around the city. The ray of light grew stronger and stronger as the space became extremely stable.

When Huang Xiaolong was laying down his formation, there was a discussion going on in the main hall of the Sleepless Palace. The Limitless Master, Wu Xin, and the king of the Ocean Race, Ye Ye, were discussing the matter of the treasure among each other.

“We’re nearly done with our preparations.” Wu Xin said, “It’s time for us to head towards the Bewilderment Island.”

“Alright, let’s head over tomorrow! Brother Wu Xin, is that alright with you?”

“Of course.” Wu Xin laughed. “However, let’s be clear about this. The Three Gods Halberd will belong to whichever side who finds it first. We’re not allowed to come to blows over the weapon.”

“Naturally.” Ye Ye chuckled. “I’m afraid that Brother Wu Xin will go against our agreement when the treasure really appears.”

“Nonsense! You’re the master of the Sleepless Sea. I won’t be able to go against our agreement even if I wanted to!”

The two of them laughed casually.

The Three Gods Halberd might be in the Bewilderment Island, but the island itself was terrifying! Neither one of them dared to venture in alone. As such, they came to an agreement to work together in order to find the treasure!

“We must not allow news of the halberd to leave this hall…” Ye Ye warned everyone who was present. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

That was what the two of them were most worried about.

Everyone might know that a treasure appeared in the Sleepless Sea, but no one knew that it was the Three Gods Halberd.

Wu Xin nodded solemnly, “Brother Ye, you can rest assured that none of us will leak the news.”

He knew how serious things were. If the news that a universe treasure had appeared in the Sleepless Sea were to spread, the five supreme overlords would rush over at once! The two of them wouldn’t be left with scraps! Like what happened to the Limitless Master when the Dragon Overlord came to seal his treasure map, the two of them might even be severely injured!

They were about to leave the hall when a massive explosion rang in their ears. The entire city trembled under their geet.

Every single expert in the hall was shocked. There was only one explanation for the shaking. Someone attacked the Sleepless City!

With so many experts stationed in the city, someone was crazy enough to launch an assault!

Did someone leak the news of the Three Gods Halberd?!

Wait a minute, the halberd hasn’t even appeared! Why was someone attacking the city?!

One of the experts from the Sleepless City rushed into the hall. He got to his knees and made a report, “Your Majesty, someone barged into the city and wounded many experts on our side!”
