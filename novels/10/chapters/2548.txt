Chapter 2549: Whoever Blocks Me, Die!

No one noticed the presence of this figure that was approaching them silently at an alarming speed. It was as if this figure was one with heaven and earth, and there was no humming or a ripple.

All eyes and attention were on the fourth high-order Saint Fate that vigilance towards their surroundings had long been thrown to the back of their minds.

As the figure got closer, one more bright light erupted in the Cambrian Pool Star’s sky, another high-order Saint Fate had appeared! This was the fifth high-order Saint Fate!

“Five, there are actually five high-order Saint Fates! This, this, this…!” even the Holy Race’s Patriarch Bai Moyang was dumbfounded.

In the past, the appearance of one high-order Saint Fate was considered as a great blessing from the heavens. The knowledge everyone had taken for granted was shattered to smithereens as the second, third, and fourth high-order Saint Fates appeared this time around, and that was not the end of it! The fifth high-order Saint Fate had descended before them!

“…Five of them?” Mo Cangli muttered dazedly under his breath.

“Five!” A sense of euphoria filled Huai Po that his scalp was tingling like it was about to fly off.

Five high-order Saint Fates. If he could integrate with these high-order Saint Fates, who in the Holy World would be qualified to stand against him after stepping into the Primal Ancestor Realm?

And this confidence was not arrogance.

Before entering True Saint Realm, the rank of one’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique were important, but after entering True Saint Realm, one’s holy soul was more important, and the three saint attributes played a lesser role.

The higher the order and number of Saint Fates a disciple integrated with, the stronger one’s holy soul would be in the future!

In short, his holy soul’s future achievements would be higher!

Then, when he advanced to Primal Ancestor Realm, his dao soul would be much stronger than others!

Although in the Holy World’s history, there had never been anyone with one holy soul integrating with two or more Saint Fates, Huai Po had come across an ancient record, and he had learned that as long as one’s soul was strong enough, he could integrate with two or more Saint Fates!

More importantly, the stronger one’s holy soul was, the more and higher-order Saint Fates one could integrate with.

Hence, ever since reading the information in the ancient record, Huai Po had been persistent in tempering and strengthening his soul, trying every method available to him. He had not breathed a word of this to anyone, and even his Master Mo Cangli did not know about it.

While Huai Po was immersed in his fantasy, there were two consecutive eruptions of light in the sky, and there were the sixth and seventh high-order Saint Fates!

In mere moments, two more high-order Saint Fates had appeared!

The crowd had gone beyond speechless now.

“Seven high-order Saint Fates? … This is not an illusion, is it?” Shen Jiewen stuttered from shock. He was still doubting whether he was hallucinating when the sky lit up once again, as the eighth and ninth high-order Saint Fates appeared simultaneously!

Again, two high-order Saint Fates had appeared at the same time!

All in all, there were nine high-order Saint Fates, floating in high air, emitting the brightest holy light that penetrated the void!

Mo Cangli, Xie Lingyun, Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and others had an expression of disbelief on their faces.

Three low-order, six high-order, and nine high-order?!

Huang Xiaolong, who was rushing from the other end of the horizon, was dumbfounded for a second, looking at the blinding bright sky where nine high-order Saint Fates hung in the sky.

H*ly cow! Huang Xiaolong used one of the little cow’s beloved exclamations.

Could these nine high-order Saint Fates be specifically prepared for me by the Holy World’s heart? The unbelievable idea suddenly flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Others might not be able to do it, but it was not impossible for him. What the general Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint disciples had was a divine soul, but he had already formed his holy soul! More importantly, he had three holy souls!

After Huang Xiaolong had crossed the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth tribulations, even he could not gauge how terrifying his three holy souls had grown, however, he was certain that any one of his three holy souls was stronger than any mid-level True Saint Realm experts’ holy soul!

Huang Xiaolong accelerated in excitement, and soon reached the edge of the Saint Fate’s boundary.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong!”

“How did Huang Xiaolong get here?!! Isn’t he trapped at the Lightning Prison River?”

At this time, some holy gate’s patriarchs were astonished when they finally detected Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

Shock swept over the crowd.

Mo Cangli, Xue Lingyun, Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, Bai Moyang, Jin Nu, Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and other experts, and disciples, including Huai Po and Lin Xiaoying within the Saint Fate’s boundary were shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden arrival.

Huai Po was fantasizing of becoming the Holy World’s number one person in the future after integrating a certain number of high-order Saint Fates, replacing Huang Xiaolong’s title and status. But now, after seeing that Huang Xiaolong had suddenly appeared, he dazed for a second, and then his face turned gloomy.

‘Damn! Isn’t the Holy Heavens’ group still trapped at the Lightning Prison River’s Devil Prison Forest Grand Formation? From the news received just now, Qiao Jinyang and the Heavenly Master are still fighting, how come Huang Xiaolong appear here?!’ Huai Po roared inwardly.

Huang Xiaolong’s appearance completely threw off his plans and fantasies.

‘No! Huang Xiaolong must not be allowed to enter the Saint Fate’s boundary! Absolutely not!’ Huai Po’s heart roared. He secretly signaled the Holy Lands Alliance’s experts.

These experts acted immediately.

However, it was not necessarily for the Holy Lands Alliance’s experts to make a move at all. The Devil Palace’s experts had drawn their sharp blades and pounced on Huang Xiaolong.

The Devil Palace’s experts were the closest to Huang Xiaolong, and most of them were Fourth Heaven True Saints, their speed and action were so quick that others barely reacted.

“Huang Xiaolong, you want to enter the Saint Fate’s boundary? Dream on! You won’t have the chance even in your next life!” A Devil Palace’s expert yelled harshly, “Your Highness Xie Bufan, subordinate will avenge you now!”

The sharp blade in his hand was merely several meters from Huang Xiaolong’s back.

After Xie Bufan had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands during the struggle for Cangqiong Old Man’s inheritance, the Devil Palace’s experts hated Huang Xiaolong to the bones, and they had made killing Huang Xiaolong their ultimate goal.

This Fourth Heaven True Saint Devil Palace’s expert was one of Xie Bufan’s loyal subordinates since long ago.

After seeing that Devil Palace expert’s blade was going to pierce Huang Xiaolong’s back, Huai Po’s face changed greatly. If the blade really stabbed into Huang Xiaolong’s back, his physical body would definitely be destroyed, and Huang Xiaolong could forget about integrating with Saint Fate this time.

Though surprised, Huai Po was happy to see this sight.

Even the heavens are on my side!

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong’s body was a split second from being destroyed by the Devil Palace’s expert, a palace suddenly flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body! Cangqiong Dao Palace!

Weng!

The Devil Palace expert’s blade stabbed onto the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and sparks flew everywhere as the blade in his hand snapped into several pieces!

He was stupefied on the spot.

Huang Xiaolong turned around abruptly, and punched out, “Get out of my way!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

One punch!

The Devil Palace’s Fourth Heaven True Saint expert let out a miserable cry then exploded to his death!

He exploded in one punch!

Golden colored blood spurted in every direction, scattering like raindrops.

This sight shook everyone. A Fourth Heaven True Saint expert was sent to his death with one punch. Moreover, that person was merely a peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint.

After sending the Devil Palace expert to his death, the Cangqiong Blade flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body and split the expert’s holy soul that was going to escape into two!

The Cangqiong Blade drew a sharp glint in the air.

“Whoever blocks me, will die!” Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the astounded crowd.

Whoever blocks me, will die!

This sentence boiled with a murderous aura, and it was overbearing, sending a chill down the spines of Holy Lands Alliance’s experts, who were ready to attack.
