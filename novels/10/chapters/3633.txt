Chapter 3634 – Xiaohong Celestial Empire

As the distance was pretty large, Tao Hang needed several years in order to arrive in the Limitless Celestial Empire. In the years that followed, Huang Xiaolong decided to continue refining the Three Gods Halberd.

With his current strength and the help of the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires refining the Three Gods Halberd was much smoother than before.

Several years later, Huang Xiaolong completely refined the halberd before Tao Hang arrived.

“Tao Hang greets the lord!” Tao Hang bowed the moment he arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

From Lin Qiankun, he learned that Huang Xiaolong has already unified the Limitless Land. The Limitless Master, Wu Xin, and the king of the Ocean Race, Ye Ye, were his subordinates.

As such, he knew that the real person in charge of the Limitless Land was no longer the Limitless Master.

“There’s no need for formalities between us. Please get up.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw Tao Hang again.

Tao Hang was the first person he met when he arrived in the Unknown Space. He didn’t treat them as subordinates as they didn’t do anything to him when they first met.

“Yes, Lord.” Tao Hang thanked as he got to his feet.

“You improved pretty quickly… Looks like you didn’t waste your time.” Huang Xiaolong praised when he noticed Tao Hang’s cultivation level.

It has been more than a million years. Tao Hang has already entered the Dao Venerable Realm since they last met. Even though he barely broken through, a Dao Venerable was still a respectable figure no matter where he went.

Of course, there were four beast kings who gave him pointers during his cultivation, but everything relied on one’s effort.

“Lord is too kind…” Tao Hang smiled and he felt a burst of warmth filling his heart. “I got to where I am today because of Lord’s grace.”

Huang Xiaolong no longer dwelled on the subject and he quickly moved on to the main topic. “I summoned you as I plan to bring you with me over to the Zhu Lan Land.”

“Zhu Lan Land?!”

Along the way, he wondered why Huang Xiaolong wanted to see him. He didn’t expect that the man would bring him to the Zhu Lan Land.

However, he quickly realized the reason.

“That’s right. Tao Han’er was brought away by the members of the Jian Family in the past, and all of us haven't seen her since then. You’re her foster father and I believe that she’ll be more than happy to meet you after so many years!” Huang Xiaolong explained.

With joy filling his heart, Tao Hang bowed once again, “Tao Hang is extremely grateful for the opportunity.”

“There’s no need to thank me!” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Go get ready and we’ll leave first thing tomorrow morning.”

There was nothing for Tao Hang to pack. However, he went straight to the market in the city to get things Tao Han’er would like.

The very next day…

Huang Xiaolong brought Tao Hang as they headed towards the Zhu Lan Land.

Other than the two of them, Yu Xiaohong, Zheng Shen, and the others were present. There were more than eighty Gods of Creation following them.

When Huang Xiaolong saved over 600 experts on the island, he learned that over eighty of them were from the Zhu Lan Land.

That was also the reason Huang Xiaolong brought them along.

In order to hasten his travel, Huang Xiaolong used the Universe Boat.

The Universe Boat tore through the skies as it changed straight towards the Sleepless Sea. No matter how many beasts they ran into, Huang Xiaolong smashed through them all! Naturally, no one could survive a single hit from the speeding ship.

Despite their terrifying speed, half a year passed before Huang Xiaolong arrived at the borders of the Zhu Lan Land.

Standing in the space above, Huang Xiaolong felt the difference in the space laws and the spiritual qi in the air. As one of the five strongest regions, the laws of space in the area was much stronger. The spiritual energy in the air was also much purer than the Limitless Land.

Huang Xiaolong released Zhu Qiming and Hao Jing from the Sun Moon Furnace.

The moment they appeared, wild joy formed on their faces.

“Zhu Lan Land!”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

A sinister smile formed on Zhu Qiming’s face. He sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would dare to step foot in my Zhu Lan Land?! Did you eat the wrong medicine this morning?!”

“Your Zhu Lan Land?” A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Well, it won’t belong to you soon. Take your time to enjoy the sights.”

After taking down the Limitless Land, Huang Xiaolong had long since set his sights on the Zhu Lan Land.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong for a moment, Zhu Qiming roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, you might be unbeatable in the thirteen universe, but you’re nothing in the Zhu Lan Land! With your 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy, the old ancestor of my family will kill you wish a single finger!”

“Are you so sure of it?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I’ll bring you to your old ancestor in a bit.”

After he spoke, he threw them both back into the Sun Moon Furnace.

“Lord, shall we head to the Jian Family or the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire?” Yu Xiaohong asked.

“If we head over to the Jian Family, we should pass by your territory, right?” Huang Xiaolong asked. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes…” Yu Xiaohong was slightly taken aback when she heard the question. Bowing respectfully, she explained, “My celestial empire isn’t located too far away from the Jian Family. We’ll probably need to travel for ten days in order to arrive at the Jian Family from my palace…”

“Alright. We’ll head over to your place for a short rest.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Yes…” Yu Xiaohong was stunned for a moment, but a brilliant smile soon formed on her face. “It’s my honor.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

Zheng Shen and the others felt a wave of envy rising in their hearts.

After more than a month, Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. When they arrived at the border, Huang Xiaolong kept his Universe Boat and they flew over casually.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive.

“Your celestial empire is pretty amazing…” Huang Xiaolong sighed when they entered. The atmosphere in the Xiaohong Celestial Empire was much better compared to the various empires they passed along the way.

“Lord is too kind.” Yu Xiaohong chuckled.

After entering the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, all of them strolled about however they liked. After half a month, they finally arrived in the Xiaohong City.

The city was comparable to the Limitless City back in the Limitless Land.

However, all of them noticed something strange when they entered the city. There were members of the Jian Family everywhere they went.

Yu Xiaohong was naturally able to feel the difference in the air and a frown formed on her face.

“I’ve heard that our celestial empire is about to form an alliance with Jian Wushuang! I wonder if it’s true…” Someone on the street asked.

“It’s probably true. However, instead of an alliance, it’s better to say that our celestial empire is about to submit to the Jian Family!”

“The Jian Family is extremely strong now, and our old ancestor has been missing for some time. It’s said that she’s trapped in the Bewilderment Forest, and she will probably lose her life eventually. It’s nothing strange for the celestial empire to submit to Jian Wushuang…”

With her expression turning extremely unpleasant, Yu Xiaohong grabbed the man who spoke and snapped at him, “What did you just say?! My celestial empire is going to submit to the Jian Family?!”
