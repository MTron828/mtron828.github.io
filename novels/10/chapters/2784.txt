Chapter 2785: Immemorial Immortal Cave

Zhu Yu hesitated for a moment before lowering his head. “Even though we can’t believe these baseless rumors, we can’t ignore them either. This subordinate feels like we should gather more intelligence before we make our move!”

The Saint Devil Prince snickered in response, “Gather more intelligence? What more do you wish to verify? Are you planning to investigate if the Cangqiong Alliance has a god of formations supporting them? Or are you planning to look for the reason Huang Xiaolong managed to take on several hundred Primal Ancestors? If this news starts to spread, what would people think of me? Will they think I’m stupid or cowardly?”

“Are they going to say that as the Saint Devil Prince, I’m afraid of a mere Cangqiong Sacred Land?!”

Zhu Yu still felt that something was wrong, and he tried to persuade the Saint Devil Prince, “However, I feel…”

“Enough!” A frosty light flashed through the Saint Devil Prince’s eyes, and he snapped, “Zhu Yu, you’ve been speaking up for the Cangqiong Sacred Land the whole time! What do you mean by this? If not for the fact that you’ve been serving me for such a long time, I would have thought that you were a spy sent by the Cangqiong Sacred Land!”

Zhu Yu’s expression changed in an instant as he fell to his knees in fright. “Your Highness, I never planned to plead for mercy for the Cangqiong Sacred Land! I was only worried for Your Highness!”

“Enough of this!” The Saint Devil Prince’s chilly voice rang through the air.

Zhu Yu sighed to himself as he felt that the Saint Devil Prince was becoming too arrogant for his own good. In the past, he would have listen to Zhu Yu’s advice no matter how unwilling he was. After becoming the disciple of Yan San of Blue Heaven Creed, he no longer cared about the old steward’s opinion.

All of a sudden, an expert from the Saint Devil Sacred Land flew over and made a report. “Your Highness, we have good news. The Immemorial Rainbow Formation has been broken!”

“Oh! Is that true?!” The Saint Devil Prince revealed an excited expression. “It’s finally broken! Nice! Peng Ge, you’ve done well! When I manage to obtain the Immemorial Immortal Cave, I’ll reward you heavily!”

Peng Ge was one of the hall masters in the Saint Devil Sacred Land. He was also one of the Saint Devil Prince’s trusted aides.

After several dozen years of hard work, they had finally shattered the Immemorial Rainbow Formation!

In the past, the Saint Devil Prince had located an ancient immortal cave, and he had learned that it was left behind by the Immemorial Dao Venerable. However, the Immemorial Rainbow Formation was laid down by the late expert to protect his dwellings. In the past, the Saint Devil Prince had gathered eighty-one Primal Ancestors who were great at dealing with ancient formations to crack it.

After using several dozen years of effort, they had finally manage to shatter the formation.

“This… Your Highness, what should we do about those experts?”

Narrowing his eyes, a chilly light flashed through them as the Saint Devil Prince growled, “Act according to the plan. Get rid of them.”

That was what he had decided on a long time ago. In order to prevent the news of his gains, he would kill all eighty-one of them the moment they shattered the formation!

“Yes, This subordinate knows what to do.” Peng Ge bowed respectfully.

As soon as he left, the Saint Devil Prince spoke to Zhu Yu. “Prepare yourself. We shall head over to the Immemorial Immortal Cave.”

Whispering softly, Zhu Yu asked, “What about the Cangqiong Alliance?”

A frown formed on the Saint Devil Prince’s face and he growled, “Wait till we emerge from the Immemorial Immortal Cave. We’ll crush them then.”

After all, the inheritance of a Dao Venerable was of incomparable value. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Not to mention the fact that the Immemorial Dao Venerable was no ordinary Dao Venerable. He was at the Fourth Creation Dao Venerable Realm.

…

On a very fine day, Huang Xiaolong was cultivating by devouring the holy spiritual energy in the Cangqiong Dao Palace when he received a transmission from his master, the Cangqiong Old Man.

Feeling a little curious, Huang Xiaolong decided to take a look at it. After all, none of them would send him reports when they had to interrupt his cultivation session.

A stunned expression filled his heart after he read the report, and it was soon replaced with joy. He quickly emerged from the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

“Xiaolong!”

“Young Lord!”

The Cangqiong Old Man, Long Jianfei, and the others quickly arrived to greet him.

“Master, is the news of the Immemorial Immortal Cave true?” Huang Xiaolong asked immediately.

In the report sent by the Cangqiong Old Man, he had mentioned that the Immemorial Immortal Cave left behind by the Immemorial Dao Venerable had appeared and Huang Xiaolong was shocked by the discovery.

“One hundred percent! Moreover, the Saint Devil Prince was the one who found it! He invited a group of Primal Ancestors over in order to deal with the Immemorial Rainbow Formation around the immortal cave before sending a group over to slaughter them after they dealt with it.” The Cangqiong Old Man soon spoke of how the news leaked.

Out of the eighty-one Primal Ancestors who took part in breaking the Immemorial Rainbow Formation, two of them managed to escape. In a fit of rage, they started to spread the news of the Immemorial Immortal Cave. As it turns out, the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave wasn’t the only party eyeing the cave. The experts of several other regions had gained the news of the Immemorial Immortal Cave as well.

They hadn’t remained idle as they had sent various experts over to the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave in order to take part in the discovery.

“Xiaolong, what’s your take on this?” The Cangqiong Old Man asked.

“We’re going over to the Immemorial Immortal Cave right now!”

Since the news had already spread through the lands, the Saint Devil Prince and the various experts under him should have already entered the immortal cave. Any delay would cause a huge loss and Huang Xiaolong decided to head over there immediately!

Even though the Immemorial Immortal Cave was located in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, Huang Xiaolong needed half a month in order to get there.

Before he left, he instructed Duan Feng and the others about some matters before bidding farewell to his master and Fei Yanzi.

In the Cangqiong Dao Palace, Huang Xiaolong waved his arms around as the holy spiritual energy contained in the holy spiritual veins descended to fill the formation powering the palace. The entire structure turned into a streak of light as it sped towards the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

Even though he didn’t know what treasures it held, he could be sure that dao pills and dao herbs would be present. When he thought of how the Saint Devil Prince had already entered the Immemorial Immortal Cave, a sense of urgency filled his heart.

Without rest, he pushed the formation to the extreme as he raced over as quickly as he could.

“Let’s hope I’m not too late,” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Along the way, nothing noteworthy happened.

Half a month later, the Cangqiong Dao Palace stopped in one of the deserted sacred lands nearby.

Sweeping his gaze across the lands, Huang Xiaolong realized that the Immemorial Immortal Cave should be located nearby.

However, there were no signs of the Immemorial Immortal Cave anywhere!

Unleashing all three dao souls, Huang Xiaolong discovered the abnormality. As it turned out, someone had laid down countless restrictions around the Immemorial Immortal Cave, hiding it from the world!

The way they had executed it was extremely well thought out. Perhaps even high-level Primal Ancestors wouldn’t be able to discover the abnormality.

Sneering to himself, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the location of the restriction before turning into a ball of golden light. He passed through it without any problems and arrived at the entrance of the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

However, the space twisted around him before he could enter and two figures appeared to stand in his way. He looked closely and saw that they were two early-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm experts!

They were the experts from the Saint Devil Sacred Land sent by the Saint Devil Prince to prevent anyone from entering!

“True Saint?!” The two of them gasped in shock when they discovered that the intruder was only at the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm.

Looking at each other with a puzzled expression they wondered how someone at Huang Xiaolong’s level was able to enter the restrictions they had laid down.
