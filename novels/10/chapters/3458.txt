Chapter 3459: Old Ancestor of the Northern Court

“Absolutely impossible!”

“My master will never betray the Northern Court Celestial Empire!”

Bei Xue yelled hysterically as she paced around the courtyard.

Lu Ting opened her mouth to say something, but she eventually swallowed her words. She didn’t want to believe the outcome of the investigation either, but it seemed as though it was true.

Yang Han actually fell into the hands of the b*stard they ran into in the Dragon Cave! She couldn’t believe that Yang Han would submit to the other party!

After all, Yang Han had served the empire for countless years. He had fought through countless battles, and he was regarded highly by the celestial emperor himself! How could it be possible?!

When Bei Xue finally calmed herself, Lu Ting approached her and muttered, “Princess, should we report this to His Majesty?”

At that moment, not even the celestial emperor knew about the matter.

As a prominent figure in the celestial empire, Yang Han’s defect to the other party’s side had to be reported to the celestial emperor!

Bei Xue’s expression fluctuated between anger and fear, but she nodded her head eventually. “You shall follow me to look for Father Emperor.”

A moment later, Bei Xue and Lu Ting headed straight for the main hall of the imperial palace.

At that moment, Bei Yanrui was currently discussing some matters with the various officials in the main hall.

“Has there been any news on the old ancestor? It’s been some time since he left for the Ice River,” Bei Yanrui asked one of the grand marshals in the hall.

“Your Majesty, the old ancestor entered the Ice Palace yesterday. Moreover, he entered the tenth space in the palace.”

The Ice Palace was located deep within the Ice River, and it was a land full of treasures!

There were a thousand separate spaces in total, and the treasures contained in each of them increased the deeper one went! However, no one had ever been able to enter the one-thousandth space! Those who could enter the nine-hundredth space and above were few…

It was said that even Meng Tian, the strongest existence in the universe, had been to the Ice River twice! He hadn’t been able to enter the one-thousandth space no matter how hard he tried!

“Your Majesty, please rest assured that the old ancestor will definitely be able to enter the nine-hundredth space. He will definitely locate the Heart of Ice!” another grand marshal reassured.

Bei Yanrui nodded slowly.

Bei Xue and Lu Ting barged into the hall all of a sudden.

Frowning slightly, Bei Yanrui felt a little confused. His daughter hardly ever looked for him in the main hall!Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After they bowed to show their respect, he asked them about the reason behind their interruption.

The two of them looked at each other and remained silent.

“Your Majesty, something happened to Lord Yang Han.” Lu Ting broke the silence before Bei Yanrui could say anything.

The experts in the hall stared at Lu Ting in shock.

“What happened to Yang Han?” Bei Yanrui asked. He still had no idea what was going on.

Gritting her teeth, Lu Ting gnashed, “Several days ago, Lord Yang Han went to the Black Flame World and was captured by his enemy!”

“What?!” Bei Yanrui leaped to his feet in shock.

Everyone in the hall stared at Lu Ting, flabbergasted.

All of them knew Yang Han’s strength. How in the world did someone capture him?!

“Who was it? Did the world master of the Black Flame World do it?” Bei Yanrui asked.

The strongest individual in the Black Flame World was the world master, however, he was probably barely as strong as Yang Han!

“It isn’t the Black Flame World Master…” Bei Xue sighed.

Everyone turned to look at her.

After a slight hesitation, she continued, “It’s a youngster with the surname ‘Huang’.”

“Huang?” Bei Yanrui frowned.

“Lu Ting also managed to find out that my master chose to submit to that youngster.” Bei Xue’s voice was low when she revealed the truth.

Bei Yanrui felt his throat going dry when he looked at his daughter.

“What?!”

“How can Lord Yang Han betray the empire?!”

Everyone in the hall went into an uproar.

Sucking in a long breath, Bei Yanrui held his hand up to silence everyone before turning to ask Bei Xue. “Tell me exactly what happened…”

Repeating everything that happened from the time Lu Ting and the others ran into Huang Xiaolong in the Dragon Cave, Bei Xue didn’t dare to hide a thing from her father. She also mentioned the part where Yang Han headed to the Myriad Star Palace alone to look for Huang Xiaolong.

Narrowing his eyes, Bei Yanrui growled, “Someone with the surname ‘Huang’ from the Myriad Star Palace?”

“Your Majesty, can he be related to Lord Huang Muyang?!” a grand marshal in the hall guessed.

“I have already made the necessary investigations. The man isn’t related to Lord Huang Muyang at all. Lord Huang Muyang has six descendants who have comprehended all thirteen elements to perfection level, but he isn’t any one of them,” Lu Ting explained.

“Father, I’m afraid that this isn’t as simple as it seems…” Bei Xue muttered.

Bei Yanrui nodded his head and sighed, “Of course, I’m not doubting Yang Han. I will get to the bottom of this.”

In the blink of an eye, tens of thousands of years passed.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong emerged from his palace and looked at the starry skies above. He heaved a sigh of relief. After so long, he had finally refined the universe-level spiritual vein.

It was time for him to leave the Myriad Star Palace.

According to his estimations, he only needed four more spiritual veins at that level before his third world would reach the peak level under the God of Creation Realm!

“Your Highness, the men from the Northern Court Celestial Empire are here again!” Li Ting made a report.

In the years that passed, countless experts of the celestial empire came over. However, they were easily dealt with by Gu Yuan and Long Yi. Initially, Huang Xiaolong thought that the old ancestor of the Northern Court Celestial Empire would personally appear, but that wasn’t the case. From what he heard, the old ancestor went to the Ice Palace of the Ice River.

“Throw all of them out. Tell them that I’ll head to the Ice River tomorrow and the Myriad Star Palace will be under my protection. If anything happens to you, I’ll personally make a trip down to the celestial empire to look for Bei Yanrui!”

“Your Highness, are you really going to the Ice River?!” Li Ting exclaimed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly. “Everything has to come to an end. If we’re fated to meet, we’ll see each other again.”

Li Ting nodded his head in silence.

The very next day, Huang Xiaolong, Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han left the Myriad Star Palace.

The experts of the Myriad Star Palace sent them off, and Li Wei didn’t budge even after the group had disappeared into the void. Li Ting shook his head when he saw his daughter’s behavior. How could he be unaware of her thoughts? However, he knew that there was no way they could hold someone like Huang Xiaolong back.

The Ice River wasn’t close to the Myriad Star Palace at all, and Huang Xiaolong continued to discuss the way of the dao with Gu Yuan and Long Yi on the way there. Yang Han stood to the side as he listened intently.

A year later, they finally saw the Ice River deep in the void.

“Your Highness, I heard that the little brat, Bei Yanrui, has also come to the Ice River.” Long Yi whispered.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock.

“The old ancestor of the Northern Court Celestial Empire is about to emerge from the Ice Palace, and Bei Yanrui brought the experts of the empire over to welcome the old ancestor,” Gu Yuan continued.

“If we enter the Ice River in a few days, will we be able to run into them?” Huang Xiaolong asked with a mischievous glint in his eyes.

The old ancestor of the Northern Court Celestial Empire, Bei Ting, was a God of Creation who had reached the peak of the small completion stage. He probably had nearly 3.0 billion units of grand cosmos energy.
