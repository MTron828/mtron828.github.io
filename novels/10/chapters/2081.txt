Chapter 2082: Thousand Despair Devil Sect

When Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Chang Mutian entered the Devil Skull Sect’s main hall, they were quickly directed to the main seats. The three ancestors personally brewed the tea that was served to Huang Xiaolong’s group. The three ancestors’ attitude was nothing short of respectful.

If anyone in the Devil World were to look at the scene playing out in the main hall right now, their jaws would drop to the ground. One had to know that the Devil Skull Sect was a super sect ranked among the top five superpowers of the Devil World. The three Skull Ancestors were all Emperors at the peak of the late-Tenth Order. They were merely half a step away from entering the Sovereign Realm, but they were like servants in front of Huang Xiaolong and his party.

Huang Xiaolong held the teacup in his hand as he took a sip. Fragrant and refreshing tea flowed down his throat, and his spirits lifted immediately. The tea leaves came from the Lightning Moon Tree in the Devil World. The effects of the tea didn’t lose out to ordinary grandmist pills in the slightest.

Huang Xiaolong casually asked about the happenings in the past few years.

As soon as they received the question, they told Huang Xiaolong everything they knew. Ever since the Devil Skull Sect had thrown in their lot with Huang Xiaolong, their strength had increased by leaps and bounds. Right now, there were signs of them pushing their way into the top four superpowers in the Devil World.

Despite all their gains, none of the three ancestors had managed to enter the Sovereign Realm. If any single one of them could break into the Sovereign Realm, they would definitely be able to fight for a spot in the top three superpowers in the Devil World.

When Huang Xiaolong asked about the situation in the Devil World, he realized that nothing much had changed. Perhaps it had something to do with the great war in the Radiance World. Everyone was shocked at Huang Xiaolong’s display of strength. Right now, all the experts who were ready to make a move had started to behave themselves as they faded into the background.

“Previously, several old devils wanted to take over the position of the Archdevil Lord of the Devil World. Ever since the battle in the Radiance World, all of them have disappeared after receiving the scare of their lives.” One of the three Skull ancestors chuckled with glee. “Your Majesty has managed to scare them off without lifting a finger!”

It was true. The mere mention of Huang Xiaolong’s name could cause the old monsters to think twice before doing anything.

Right now, there were tons of old monsters who had privately named Huang Xiaolong as ‘Death God Huang.’ In the past one thousand years, Huang Xiaolong had reaped the lives of many after rising to power. He had killed countless ancestor-level figures.

As for the Sovereign Realm experts he had killed, their names were noted down in the annals of history! Everyone knew Huang Xiaolong’s shocking achievements!

At the start, the Sovereigns like Lu Kun, Chiyou, and others, who had barely entered the Sovereign Realm, had fallen at Huang Xiaolong’s hands. However, he had soon progressed to kill the existences like Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, and the others whose reputation had always shaken the world.

The number of Sovereigns who had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands was seventeen!

As for overlord figures at Shi Ming’s level, there were six of them!

If Huang Xiaolong didn’t gain a reputation as a death god, no one else would be able to claim the title!

The little cow turned to Huang Xiaolong and chuckled, “Your reputation has already grown to be larger than mine. No, no, no, this isn’t good. Now that the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia is going to appear, you can’t make a move! Let me do it! I’ll be the one to take care of everything!”

Huang Xiaolong and Cang Mutian burst into laughter when they heard what she said.

Refusing to reply to her, Huang Xiaolong continued asking about the matters that happened in the Devil World before ordering the three Skull Ancestors to take note of the matters related to the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia. He also ordered for them to keep a lookout for the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus and the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele.

After passing down all his instructions, Huang Xiaolong sent the three of them away. Before they left, Huang Xiaolong warned them not to allow news of either the lotus or the devil stele to spread.

When the three of them left, the little cow suggested going out on a stroll. Huang Xiaolong agreed instantly. Even though he had entrusted the three Skull Ancestors with the task of looking for the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia, Green Lotus, and the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele, he couldn’t remain idle.

Not to mention he was the person who had refined the five other devil steles. If the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele was really located in the Saint Devil Region, he would be able to detect it.

It was the same for the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus. When the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had obtained the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus in the past, he had placed it in the Complete Heaven Palace in order to nourish it with the starlight from the Complete Heaven Star Formation. The lotus had long since absorbed energy from the Ancient Heavenly Court. This would enable Huang Xiaolong to locate it if it was nearby.

As long as it was nearby, Huang Xiaolong would feel the presence of the lotus with the help of the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Before long, the three of them left the Devil Skull Sect, and they started to stroll around the streets of Saint Devil City.

As they walked around, Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop searching for the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus and the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele.

Whatever the case, the Saint Devil City was massive, and it didn’t lose out to the Eternal Devil City in size.

After a day, Huang Xiaolong barely managed to look through less than one-ten thousandth of the city.

Luckily for Huang Xiaolong, he had the Ancient Heavenly Court. He had also refined the other five devil steles that would enable him to feel if the treasures were nearby.

Ten days later, Huang Xiaolong finally managed to scan through the Saint Devil City. It was a pity he failed to locate either the lotus or the devil stele. A wave of disappointment swept through Huang Xiaolong.

They quickly expanded their search radius to the outside of the Saint Devil City as they started sweeping outwards.

Eventually, Huang Xiaolong’s party arrived at one of the mountain ranges outside of Saint Devil City.

Right before they could enter the mountain range, they were stopped by a group of disciples from the Devil Race. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hold it right there! This is the restricted region of our Thousand Despair Devil Sect! There will be no messing about here! Outsiders are not permitted entry!” One of the disciples yelled.

Huang Xiaolong and the other two Sovereigns looked at the disciple with a dumbfounded expression on their faces.

“Oh? The Thousand Despair Devil Sect?” A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he continued, “When did the Thousand Despair Devil Sect manage to set up their forbidden region outside the Saint Devil City?”

The Thousand Despair Devil Sect was ranked in the twenties in the Devil World, and Huang Xiaolong knew the strength they possessed.

The Heavenless Devil Legion controlled the region around the Saint Devil City, and it couldn’t belong to the Thousand Despair Devil Sect. The disciples of the sect had probably sealed it off themselves.

A murderous gaze flashed in the disciple’s eyes as a massive blade appeared in his hand. “Brat, you better f*ck off before I cut you down. Our young master has ordered that no one is to step into the area, so you better leave now. If you dare to approach, I’ll chop your head off!”

Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Cang Mutian roared with laughter when they heard what he said.

They had never expected that some God Kings and Heavenly Monarchs would yell and shout in front of them. Neither had they expected to be threatened to have their heads cut off.

When the Thousand Despair Devil Sect’s disciples saw that the group in front of them was laughing instead of leaving, they raised their blades. Just as they were about to make a move, another group of disciples appeared in the distance. When the members of the Thousand Despair Devil Sect saw the newcomers, their expressions changed.

“Wu Qianzhen, you guys sure are bold. How dare you seal off an area ten million miles around the mountain range?” The person who spoke was a pretty lady, and she couldn’t help but sneer at them. “If the members of my Devil Emperor Sect want to go in, are you going to chop our heads off too?”

The Devil Emperor Sect was ranked in the top ten superpowers in the Devil World. Even though they were a little more than ten places in front of the Thousand Despair Devil Sect, they were a power the Thousand Despair Devil Sect could never dream of touching. It was no wonder the expressions of the disciples from the Thousand Despair Devil Sect changed when they saw the newcomers.

The disciple who was called Wu Qianzhen, couldn’t help but stutter, “Zhi Sijia, don’t go too far!”

The pretty girl chuckled in response, “You’re not qualified to block my way. Scram!”

Wu Qianzhen of the Thousand Despair Devil Sect blanched, and he eventually led the members of his sect away. Right before they left, he glared at Huang Xiaolong. Even though he could not dare to report the members of the Devil Emperor Sect, he was more than willing to blame everything on Huang Xiaolong.
