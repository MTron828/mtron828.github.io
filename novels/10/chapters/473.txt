Chapter 474: ‘Little Worm’

Zhu Yu’s face was ash gray from the shock. Although he wasn’t clear of Huang Xiaolong’s identity, being greeted by the elves’ Grand Elder Celine was sufficient to tell Zhu Yu that Huang Xiaolong was not someone he could afford to offend!

Putting himself aside, not even his Zhu Family’s Patriarch could afford to offend him!

Among the group of shocked faces, Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained calm and unaffected.

Several tens of thousands of years ago, the beastmen reigned over the Ten Directions Continent. All other races, from demonic beasts, elves, dwarves, Golden Giants to the skeleton tribes were vassals, submitted under the Beast God.

The Beast God was Ten Direction Continent’s God!

Whether it was the beast king or the elf queen, both were subjects of the Beast God, his servants. And Huang Xiaolong was now the new Beast God, it wouldn’t be deemed too much even if Elf Queen Kelly were to greet him in person.

But then again, the Elf Queen Kelly and Grand Elder Celine didn’t know that he was the new Beast God.

“Young Noble, this way please!” Another wave of shock coursed through everyone present, Grand Elder Celine’s courteous attitude far surpassed their imagination, to the point she even used the word ‘please.’

Huang Xiaolong’s face remained stolid as he nodded.

Before everyone’s shocked expressions, Huang Xiaolong followed behind Grand Elder Celine, disappearing from their view.

The elves’ Grand Elder Celine carefully led Huang Xiaolong to the center of their holy land.

Huang Xiaolong’s keen senses felt the fluctuations of vitality in the air grow stronger as they moved closer to the center of the holy land. The strong life energy in the area seemed to originate from that one massive tree.

The Tree of Life!

Huang Xiaolong studied the towering massive tree in the distance. Spiritual life energy was pouring out in abundance, yet he had an indistinctive feeling from the trunk of the tree, its spiritual life energy was rapidly seeping away.

At this rate, according to Huang Xiaolong’s estimation, in no more than ten years, the Tree of Life would wither completely.

No wonder the Elf Queen was willing to use ten pieces of Life Crystal to attract so many experts over as a reward for healing the Tree of Life.

Not far from the Tree of Life, there was a hall. At this time, six people were sitting on the stage in the hall. Judging from the looks of it, all six were the elves’ honored guests.

All six exuded the strong aura of Saint realm experts.

Huang Xiaolong’s swept across these six people’s faces, two of them belonged to the demonic beasts clan, one from the Golden Giant race, someone from the Green Demon tribe, and the remaining two were experts from the sea tribe with an air of nobility around them.

On Ten Directions Continent, other than the beastmen tribes and demonic beasts clan, the other strong force was the sea tribe.

When they saw Grand Elder Celine lead Huang Xiaolong toward the hall, all six of them couldn’t help looking at Huang Xiaolong, each showing a different expression.

Grand Elder Celine escorted Huang Xiaolong to a seat on the left side. However, just as Huang Xiaolong was about to sit, a voice sounded, “Kiddo, who are you, what’s your identity and background? Do you think you’re qualified to sit with us here?”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the person who spoke, it was one of the middle-aged men from the demonic beasts clan, clad in a deep purple brocade robe embroidered with a sea dragon.

Grand Elder Celine’s face tightened at the baseless provocation, afraid that Huang Xiaolong might be angered, giving rise to an awkward situation, she hurried an introduction to Huang Xiaolong, “Young Noble, this one is Nine Dragons Temple’s Sixth Hall Master.”

‘Oh, so it’s the Nine Dragons Temple. Sixth Hall Master, Ao Shen?’

A cold sneer sounded in Huang Xiaolong’s heart, taking a second look at the other five people. Although these five people did not say anything, the look in their eyes spoke volumes of disdain and scorn. Clearly, these five people held a similar opinion as Ao Shen that a young man of the human race was not qualified to be seated with them.

“So, it’s a little worm from the Nine Dragons Temple.” Huang Xiaolong retorted, sneering at Ao Shen.

The Nine Dragons Temple’s nine hall masters were originally sea dragons. Despite being looked upon as one of the Dragon Clan’s descendants, their bloodline wasn’t pure enough, especially when compared to someone like Huang Xiaolong who had refined eight primordial divine dragons and fused with the Dragon Pearl. Therefore, they could only be considered worms crawling on the ground.

This Nine Dragons Temple knew very well that the ex-Lion Tribe Young Patriarch Jesse was wanted by the beastmen tribes, but the Nine Dragons Temple openly declared that Jesse was under their protection. This was tantamount to slapping the beastmen tribes’ face, not putting the new Beast God Huang Xiaolong in their eyes!

He had planned to make a trip to the Nine Dragons Temple a few days later, after the things here were settled, but he didn’t expect to run into someone from the Nine Dragons Temple here.

Worm?! It was like someone cast a spell over the hall, one could hear the drop of a needle.

Everyone who heard Huang Xiaolong’s words watched with intrigue while the five other people started to gloat. From their perspective, a young’un from the human race only had one predictable end provoking the Nine Dragons Temple’s Sixth Hall Master, Ao Shen.

Grand Elder Celine was dumbstruck looking at Huang Xiaolong. Didn’t she just tell him that this middle-aged man was the Nine Dragons Temple’s Sixth Hall Master? But this young human actually treated her words as passing wind?

Even their Elf Queen treated the Nine Dragons Temple with courtesy.

Ao Shen was stunned, despite quickly regaining his senses, he still wore an obvious expression of disbelief from what he heard. The other side... what did he just say? Little worm?!

Ao Shen jumped to his feet, killing intent soared sky high, laced with surging beastly aura.

“Death seeking punk!” Ao Shen’s eyes narrowed, about to attack.

“Sixth Hall Master, cease your anger!” Grand Elder Celine cried out anxiously. “This Young Noble is an honored guest invited by our Queen, please give our Queen face and don’t take offense.”

She was aware that this Nine Dragons Temple Sixth Hall Master had always admired their Queen, which was why she used the Queen’s name. Just like she expected, hearing that he was invited by the Elf Queen, the monstrous killing intent was gradually repressed.

Ao Shen pointed at Huang Xiaolong, his eyes like a violent undercurrent beneath a calm surface, “Fine, I shall give face to the Elf Queen. If this kid crawls around the hall like a worm, and kneels until this whole thing ends, I will spare his life!”

Since Huang Xiaolong wasn’t qualified to sit with them, he should just kneel.

Celine turned to Huang Xiaolong with a troubled expression, “Young Noble, this, you...?”

Yes, the strength Huang Xiaolong displayed three years ago indeed surprised her, but nonetheless, in Celine’s eyes, this young man was not Ao Shen’s opponent. For a peak late-Ninth Order Saint realm Ao Shen, killing Huang Xiaolong would be an easy matter. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, Huang Xiaolong shook his head smilingly at Ao Shen, “Giving face to the Elf Queen, if you crawl out from the hall like the little worm that you are, I shall consent to spare your life.”

Shock could not describe the look on everyone’s faces staring at Huang Xiaolong.

“You! Even if the Elf Queen pleads on your behalf, you must die!!” Snapping back to his senses, Ao Shen let out an angry roar, his body disappearing in a blur. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong, slamming out a hard fist.

Grand Elder Celine face became ashen, it was already too late for her stop Ao Shen, she could only watch from the side as Ao Shen’s fist came in contact with Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

A muffled blast rang.

Celine closed her eyes, unwilling to watch Huang Xiaolong’s lifeless limp body crash to the ground.

However, she was baffled the next moment. It grew quiet after the initial muffled collision, no miserable screams, no heavy thump of a body thrown to the ground.

Moreover, the hall was filled with an eerie silence that could be felt even with her eyes closed.

‘What happened?’ Bafflement and curiosity rolled into one, and she opened her eyes. Her jaw dropped in astonishment and incredulity at the scene in front of her eyes.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the agape expressions around. His head was lowered, looking at Ao Shen’s fist on his chest with a stoic face, “This is your strength, worm? Are you trying to scratch an itch for me?”
