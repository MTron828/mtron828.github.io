Chapter 3653: How Dare You!

As soon as they did, the experts who were cursing at Huang Xiaolong earlier seemed to have fallen under some sort of curse. They yelped once before rolling about on the floor. Every time they opened their mouths from then on, they would insult the members of the Jian Family.

They roared that the Jian Family was despicable and Jian Weifeng was a hypocrite. The words that came out of their mouths were nasty.

The experts in the outer hall stared at each other in shock.

After scolding Huang Xiaolong, the two of them lost their minds. No one would believe it if Huang Xiaolong said that he had nothing to do with them.

Everyone recognized the two experts who were rolling around the ground. One of them was the old ancestor of the Xu Family of the Zhu Lan Lands, and the other was the old ancestor of the Hao Family. Both of them were Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage.

The Xu Family and Wu Family were vassals of the Jian Family. They were extremely loyal to Jian Weifeng, but now, they were reduced to a crazed mess. Everyone felt goosebumps growing all over their arms.

Jian Weifeng heard the report about the two of them going crazy and his expression sank. “Take the two of them down and throw them out of the outer hall.”

Jian Shengdong acknowledged before leaving to carry out the order.

“Patriarch, the Blue Dragon Young Master definitely has something to do with them going crazy…” Jian Xiyuan growled. “Why don’t I head out and deal with that kid?”

Jian Weifeng shook his head slowly. “The ceremony is about to start. Let’s not mess things up. We’ll wait for the ceremony to end before dealing with the kid. He can thank his lucky stars that I’m allowing him to live for a few more hours.”

Jian Xuyuan sighed and nodded.

All of a sudden, Tao Han’er entered the hall. Shw bowed towards Jian Weifeng and said, “Uncle, I need to speak to Ancestor Wushuang.”

The inner hall was large, and Jian Wushuang sat in the middle of the hall with Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Mei Jie.

The other experts could only sit at the side of the hall.

Seeing that the person who had spoken was Tao Han’er, Jian Weifeng forced a smile, “Han’er, the ancestor is discussing the dao with the other lords. Don’t interrupt them. You can tell me everything you wish to say.”

Tao Han’er hesitated slightly before speaking, “I wish to bring the Blue Dragon Young Master into the hall to apologize to Ancestor Wushuang.”

Jian Weifeng’s expression sank instantly. “Enough. Stop interfering with the matters regarding the Blue Dragon Young Master.”

Looking at her reluctant expression, he added quickly, “We’ll deal with the matter after the ceremony ends. Go to your seat quietly.”

Tao Han’er lowered her head and walked slowly towards a seat in the hall. It was coincidentally located right beside Zhu Jian.

When she sat down, Zhu Jian got up and walked over to her. “Younger Sister Han’er!”

His voice was sickly sweet, but it sounded extremely harsh on her ears. With her mood already dampened from what Jian Weifeng said, she ignored him and sat down sullenly.

Zhu Jian’s body stiffened, but he quickly reacted. He walked towards the center of the hall and kneeled before Jian Wushuang. “Lord Jian Wushuang, I have fallen in love with Younger Sister Han’er the moment I met her. I can’t think of anything but her. Today, I hope Lord Jian Wushuang will agree to my proposal and allow me to marry her!”

He kowtowed once, and a sincere expression stuck to his face.

Due to the sudden interruption, Jian Wushuang was slightly taken aback.

Mei Jie got to his feet all of a sudden. He laughed, “Brother Wushuang, you might not know, but this kid has been talking about her. He’s been pestering me to raise the proposal on his behalf, but who would have thought that he would do it himself? I hope brother Wushuang can agree to the marriage!”

Tao Han’er started to panic. She couldn’t understand the sudden change in the situation!

Jian Wushuang chuckled lightly in response, “Brother Mei Jie, there’s no need to act so awkwardly around me. This is great! Zhu Jian possesses unquestionable talent! His personality is pretty good too! The two kids are a couple made in heaven! However, the two of them are still weak. It’s too early to talk about marriage…”

Tao Han’er heaved a sigh of relief when she heard what he said.

However, Mei Jie didn’t let up. “Their cultivation won’t hamper things. Why don’t we set the engagement now? As soon as they break through to the God of Creation Realm, they can have their wedding ceremony!”

Jian Wushuang stroked his beard and laughed, “That seems alright! Since that’s the case, we’ll set it at that!”

Elder Baixuan Tian laughed at the side, “Today, you’re holding a ceremony to celebrate your breakthrough. Now that the marriage is set, it’s another thing we get to congratulate you on! I give my best wishes to Brother Mei Jie and Brother Wushuang!”

Laughter filled the air.

However, their joy was broken when Tao Han’er got to her feet and yelled, “I don’t agree to this!”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrow and his laughter continued, “Han’er, Young Master Zhu Jian is extremely talented! His status in the Zhu Lan Lands isn’t low either. There’s nothing wrong with marrying him!”

Tears filled her eyes as she continued to argue, “I’m not going to get married!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This brat… You can’t remain single your whole life. Enough. This shall be done.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

Even though she felt extremely wronged, she couldn’t go against Jian Wushuang. She could only cry silently.

All of a sudden, a calm voice boomed in the hall, “Old man Wushuang, you don’t get to make decisions for Han’er.”

The experts in the hall raised their heads with their mouths agape.

Old Man Wushuang?!

They turned to look at the entrance of the inner hall to see the maniac who dared to address Jian Wushuang that way.

They saw a young man strolling into the hall with his hands clasped behind his back.

It was none other than Huang Xiaolong!

When Gui Chi saw who it was, his eyebrows jumped.

“What audacity!” Jian Xiyuan roared. “How dare you show disrespect to our old ancestor?! You deserve death!”

As soon as he spoke, his sword qi surrounded him as rays of light filled the hall.

“Good technique!” Mei Jie praised all of a sudden.

Before Jian Xiyuan’s sword qi could strike Huang Xiaolong, he released his aura. A heaven-shaking pressure filled the hall and the ground shook violently.

Jian Xiyuan’s sword qi exploded. Eminent Elder Jian Xiyuan had 13 billion units of combat strength, but he failed to do a thing to the intruder! Huang Xiaolong didn’t even move to stop Jian Xiyuan’s sword qi!

Jian Weifeng wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Jian Wushuang was also taken aback.

All of a sudden, Wu Xin and Ye Ye started to approach him.
