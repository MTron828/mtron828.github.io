Chapter 3316: At Least You Know What’s Good For You

As soon as the words left his lips, a resounding blast echoed through the air. Everyone in the hall was stunned. 

“What’s going on?!” Lu Dingming frowned.

One of the middle aged bodyguards standing at the door rushed in all of a sudden and yelled in panic, “Chairman, it’s the members of the Yagyu Clan! They… They’re here!”

“Yagyu Clan?!” The faces of everyone in the hall changed.

“Who is the person who came?” Lu Dingming asked. 

“It’s… It’s Eminent Elder Yagyu Motoichi and he brought along more than thirty grand elders and seventy elders!” 

“What?!” Lu Dingming exclaimed in fright. Even Zhang Yu couldn’t help but panic.

How could Zhang Yu not know about Yagyu Motoichi?

The Yagyu Clan might possess Enlightenment Realm experts, but most of them had hidden from the world. Yagyu Motoichi was the odd one out as he controlled the enforcement hall of the Yagyu Clan! He would appear in most events, and his reputation was large!

“It’s him! He’s the reason they’re here! He injured Yagyu Tyrant, and Yagyu Motoichi came to look for him!” Zhang Yu pointed at Huang Xiaolong and yelled, “Hand him over right now!”

Everyone’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong.

With a look of panic on her face, Lu Anan cried out, “You can’t do that! Uncle Huang only did that in order to save me! We cannot hand him over!”

Lu Dingming nodded slowly. “Anan, you can relax. If they really wish to bring Xiaolong away, they will have to do it over my dead body!” Releasing his aura, Lu Dingming growled, “I refuse to believe that the members of the Yagyu Clan will dare to start a massacre here.”

“We’ll go out and greet them!” Lu Dingming declared before whispering to Huang Xiaolong, “Xiaolong, why don’t you hide for now? There is a secret chamber under the building.”

Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “I understand Uncle Dingming’s concern, but Yagyu Motoichi hasn’t entered the God of Creation Realm yet. I won’t be afraid of him… After all, he’s just an eminent elder of a mere Yagyu Clan.”

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, Lu Dingming had no idea what Huang Xiaolong meant. A look of appreciation formed on his face and he spoke again, “Alright. Let’s go meet Yagyu Motoichi!”

The windows of the building opened up as Lu Dingming led the experts of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce over to a platform built in the air.

As soon as they emerged, they saw two flying ships soaring towards them.

The one in the lead had a weird insignia of the Yagyu Clan inscribed on the body of the ship, and they stopped several metres away from the  platform.

A group of people disembarked, and Yagyu Motoichi was in the head. His eyebrows were densely packed and it accentuated his aggressive vibes.

There were groups of grand elders and elders standing behind him.

Looking closely, they could see Yagyu Tyrant standing behind Yagyu Motoichi, and he glared at Huang Xiaolong the moment they disembarked. 

Chen Kerui and the members of the Fierce Tiger Gang leaped off their ship behind the members of the Yagyu Clan. Even though most of them were cultivators in the Golden Core Realm and were unable to remain in the air, a pair of wings sprouted behind every single one of them as they hovered behind Yagyu Motoichi and the others. The wings were made after technology advanced on Earth, and it could allow them to remain in the air for some time.

“Father, that’s the chinese pig who crippled my arm!” Yagyu Tyrant growled as he pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

Turning to Huang Xiaolong, a trace of suspicion could be seen in Yagyu Tyrant’s eyes. He seemed to recall seeing Huang Xiaolong somewhere before.

Before anyone could react, Huang Xiaolong dragged Yagyu Tyrant over to himself by grabbing at the void. With a tiny flick of his wrist, Yagyu Tyrant was sent smashing into the Yagyu Clan’s flying ship. 

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“I’ll kill you if the words ‘chinese pig’ ever come out of your mouth again.” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Roaring in anger, Yagyu Motoichi raged, “Brat, you’re too cocky!” He didn’t think that anyone would dare to harm his son now that he was here. However, Huang Xiaolong was obviously an exception.

“Cocky? Ever since I returned to Earth, I have tried to pardon whoever I can. Otherwise, he would have been dead the moment the words left his lips.” Huang Xiaolong mumbled.

Indeed, the number of people who died in his hands couldn’t be compared to the time he was in the Huang Long World. Even in the Blazing Dragon World, the number of experts who died after pissing him off were uncountable.

Yagyu Motoichi seethed in anger, “Am I supposed to thank you for sparing his life?!”

“Eminent Elder Motoichi, there’s no need to waste your time. I’ll take him down right now and bring him to you. You can deal with the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce after that.” One of the grand elders standing behind Yagyu Motoichi harrumphed. 

The person who spoke was at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm, and he was one of Yagyu Motoichi’s close confidants.

“Alright. Do it! Show no mercy.” 

Nodding in acknowledgement, the grand elder took a step towards Huang Xiaolong and Lu Dingming.

Turning to Zhang Yu, Lu Dingming panicked, “Vice chairman Zhang Yu, please!”

Retreating immediately, Zhang Yu’s expression changed. “His grudge with the Yagyu Clan isn’t something I need to deal with!”

The faces of those from the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce Changed. No one would have thought that Zhang Yu would retreat at the most crucial moment! His actions proved that he wouldn’t help them even if the Yagyu Clan moved against the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce!

The grand elder of the Yagyu Clan sneered, “Zhang Yu, at least you know what’s good for you. Today, the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce will be exterminated! If you remain at the side, we will spare your life!”

Zhang Yu’s expression was sombre as he took several steps back.

Lu Dingming and the others couldn’t help but rage. 

“Chairman Dingming, I’ve said this before when I entered the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce. I will do my best for the company, but I will never risk my life for you all!” Zhang Yu sighed. “As such, you cannot force me to fight to my last breath!”

Lu Dingming sighed when he heard his explanation. “Forget it…” He seemed to have aged by several years in the span of several seconds.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Lu Dingming’s hand and a smile formed on his face. “Uncle Dingming, you can rest assured nothing will happen to all of you.”

Slowly walking forward, he approached the grand elder who was still in mid air.

“At least you have guts!” The grand elder of the Yagyu Clan clapped in amusement. “It’s too bad your guts won’t be able to save you from dying a miserable death today!”

Blinking once, a ray of lightning flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes before shooting into the grand elder’s body. Turning into a block of charcoal at once, vitality drained out from the grand elder as his body hardened. His nascent soul failed to escape as his body started to fall from the skies.

When everyone looked at the corpse falling to the ground, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even move and he managed to kill the grand elder of the Yagyu Clan!
