Chapter 3710: My Men!

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong laid down the Star Dragon Grand Formation. Not content, he reinforced it several times. In total, he managed to strengthen it by three times.

This time, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to allow any mishaps to occur. If he allowed the Heaven Devouring King to notice anything off, Huang Xiaolong could only run away from the Universe Vault with his tails tucked between his legs.

His grand cosmos energy might have broken through the 29 billion mark, but he wasn’t strong enough to fight the entire Universe First Race on his own! In fact, he wasn’t even an opponent for the White Feather King or the Black Nether King.

Thinking about it for some time, Huang Xiaolong used the Golden Sun Circlet to reinforce the Star Dragon Grand Formation. Even though the universe treasure was used to defend himself, it possessed pretty strong restrictive powers.

In the blink of an eye, a month passed.

Several people appeared from the void and traveled towards the city.

“Sister Yin Xue, your Snow City is the prettiest place in our Universe Vault! I never wish to leave after coming here…” A slender lady clad in crimson robes giggled at the side.

“If Little Sister Feng likes it, you can stay here for as long as you like. I’ll finally get some company.”

A young man clad in jade armor chuckled behind her, “Why don’t I stay with you?”

A soft laugh left Yin Xue’s lips. “Brother Bi Qing is too playful!”

The youngster roared with laughter.

“Actually, I miss the Enchanting Wine the most!” another man clad in gold joked.

“Relax. I got my men to prepare the wine to welcome you. Little Brother Jin Long can drink to your heart’s content.” Yin Xue smiled.

Amidst their laughter, they entered the city.

Bi Qing sighed, “The structures here are really amazing..”

“Big Brother Bi Qing, your Jade Sea Palace is the most exquisite building we’ve seen. You can’t compare it to my little Snow City…” Yin Xue giggled.

With a grin on his face, Bi Qing didn’t say anything else.

It was true. His Jade Sea Palace was much better than the Snow City!

It was something he was extremely proud of!

Naturally, his teacher had a part to play in it.

Countless experts emerged from the city in order to welcome Yin Xue and those around her.

When they arrived before Yin Xue, all of them bowed respectfully.

Allowing them to get up, she followed them into the city.

“Did anything happen when I was away?” she asked.

“Nope. Everything remained the same,” someone in the group replied.

After asking several other questions, her trusted attendants replied without allowing her to notice anything wrong with the state of the city.

Yin Xue invited Bi Qing, Chi Feng, and Jin Long into her palace where the banquet had already been prepared.

Jin Long’s eyes lit up when he saw the jars of wine placed along the table. “I’ve been thinking about the Enchanting Wine for such a long time!”

Yin Xue chuckled, “You can’t enjoy good wine without beauties by your side…” Clapping her hands, a group of pretty ladies whose bodies were barely covered in a layer of cloth entered the hall. Every one of them was an absolute beauty and their movements were bewitching.

Bi Qing looked at them and joked, “The Dazzling Flowers in younger sister Yin Xue’s palace are really famous. I finally get to meet them!”

As they took their seats, the banquet quickly reached its peak.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Sister Yin Xue, you should know that I was sent by my master…” Bi Qing placed his cup down and muttered.

“Of course. How can I forget?” Turning to one of her attendants, Yin Xue ordered, “Bring the slaves over. Let Lord Bi Qing pick some of them out.”

Bowing slightly, the attendant left.

It didn’t take long before Huang Xiaolong and the others stood before Yin Xue, Bi Qing, Chi Feng, and Jin Long.

As Huang Xiaolong and Pangu took off their disguises, Huang Xiaolong was like a sore thumb that stood out from the crowd. All of them turned to look at him instantly.

“Huang Long Bloodline?! Big Sister, can I have this slave?” Chi Feng pointed at Huang Xiaolong as she exclaimed. “I require the bloodlines of a bunch of experts from the Dragon Race in order to refine a batch of pills!”

Jin Long chuckled, “You need his bloodline and I need his dao soul. Give me his dao soul when you’re done. I need to refine my Dragon Spear with the dao souls of those from the Dragon Race.”

“Since the two of you like him, you can have him.” Yin Xue smiled. Turning to one of her generals, she exclaimed, “Take him down. Chi Feng and Jin Long will bring him away when they leave.”

Despite giving the order, the general didn’t move.

Narrowing her eyes, Yin Xue snapped at him, “Didn’t you hear what I said?”

Even so, he didn’t respond.

Bi Qing sneered when he saw what was going on. “Looks like someone dares to ignore your order…”

As her arm shot out, she wanted to slap the general across the face. It was too bad a ray of sword light stopped her dead in her tracks.

All four of them stared at the sword light in shock.

Turning to look at the source, they saw Huang Xiaolong walking towards them.

“Did you do that?!” Yin Xue couldn’t believe what was going on.

She knew that there was no way a random slave would be able to stop her attack. Moreover, the person standing before her was an expert at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

Ignoring her, Huang Xiaolong arrived before them. He muttered, “Yin Xue, Bi Qing, Chi Feng, Jin Long… Four of the six geniuses of the Universe First Race are here… What a pity. Heaven Tyrant and the Ninth Void aren’t here. Otherwise, I would have saved my time.”

The six geniuses of the Universe First Race were the most talented disciples of the second generation of those from the Universe First Race.

All six of them were disciples of the thirteen kings!

Yin Xue was the oldest disciple of the Heaven Devouring King, Bi Qing was the only disciple of the Star Refining King. Chi Feng was the second disciple of the Golden Cymbals King, and Jin Long was a hidden disciple of the Golden Qilin King!

Ninth Void was a disciple of the White Feathers King, and Heaven Tyrant was the disciple of the Black Nether King!

Heaven Tyrant ranked first among the six, followed by Ninth Void, Bi Qing, and Yin Xue.

“This guy is pretty interesting… Brat, looks like you managed to sneak your way in here!” Jin Long chuckled. “That’s weird. You’re just a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. Who gave you the confidence to speak to us like that? Do you really think that you’re someone special? Humph. Your sword qi is pretty impressive, I’ll give you that.”

Yin Xue waved her hand and roared at the generals behind her, “Take him down right now!”

It was too bad no one moved.

“There’s no need for you to give them any more orders. They are now my men,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

After he spoke, he looked at the generals beside her and those of the Universe First Race. All of them took a step back at once, and they kneeled to face Huang Xiaolong.
