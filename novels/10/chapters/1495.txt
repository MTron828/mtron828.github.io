The appearance of the giant face above Zhou Chen’s cultivation palace was akin to a pebble sinking into the sea. Neither Fang Gan, other Ancestors, nor Zhao Lei noticed any strangeness.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong was back in the Tiger Dragon Palace and gathered everyone at the hall.

Xiang Xun couldn’t hide his excitement when Huang Xiaolong told him that he was going to resolve his petrification seals. “Master, how confident are you in resolving the petrification seals in my body?”

Hearing Xiang Xun’s question, Huang Xiaolong smiled awkwardly as he explained, “As I have not broken through to the God King Realm, I’m just going to try, there’s only a fifty percent chance.”

Though Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation was at the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, he was confident that he would be fifty percent successful.

Of course, the success rate also depended on Xiang Xun’s actual condition.

“Xiaoniu, Xu Baisheng, and the others stand guard by my side.” Huang Xiaolong turned to the side to instruct the little cow and Xu Baisheng.

Xu Baisheng and the others complied.

The little cow nodded her head. She knew how risky it was to resolve the petrification seals inside Xiang Xun’s body, therefore, Huang Xiaolong could not be disturbed in any way during the process.

As a precaution, Huang Xiaolong had them activate the cultivation palace’s defensive formations.

After preparations were made, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged with Xiang Xun at the center of the hall, adjusting their conditions to the peak. Then, Huang Xiaolong activated the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s formation.

Instantly, streaks of golden dragon lightning carrying destructive power flowed out from Huang Xiaolong’s arms.

Huang Xiaolong pressed his palms against Xiang Xun’s head and carefully maneuvered the chaos golden dragon lightning through the maze in Xiang Xun’s consciousness.

According to Xiaoniu, the essential ‘lock’ to the petrification seals inside Xiang Xun’s body was located in his consciousness. If Huang Xiaolong could resolve the petrification seals in Xiang Xun’s consciousness, then resolving the rest of the petrification seals in other parts of his body would be much easier.

However, upon entering Xiang Xun’s consciousness, Huang Xiaolong’s chaos golden dragon lightning ran into a thick wall, completely hindering Huang Xiaolong from advancing deeper into Xiang Xun’s consciousness.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised by how sturdy the hindrance was.

Through his connection with the chaos Golden dragon lightning, Huang Xiaolong subsequently saw that there were layers upon layers upon layers of ’walls’ in the space of Xiang Xun’s consciousness. These ’walls’ filled the space within Xiang Xun’s consciousness in such a way that nothing else could be seen!

This!

The condition of Xiang Xun’s petrification seals had greatly exceeded his estimation.

It wasn’t as simple as dominating the entire space in Xiang Xun’s consciousness, even Xiang Xun’s godhead was entombed within these walls.

Huang Xiaolong was stupefied ‘looking’ at the situation in front of him.

It was hard to imagine how Xiang Xun even used his godforce from his godhead?

With these dense layers of seals, Xiang Xun was still so powerful, what if these petrification seals were completely resolved, how strong would Xiang Xun be?

The peak of Heavenly Monarch?

Maybe even the Emperor Realm!

Briefly after, Huang Xiaolong’s expression grew solemn as he increased the amount of chaos golden dragon lightning flowing into Xiang Xun’s consciousness at a constant rate.

However, no matter how much Huang Xiaolong increased the intensity of the chaos golden dragon lightning, the first layer of wall didn’t even quiver.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong was not frustrated nor did he give up. He persisted on, repeatedly trying to break the first wall.

Xiaoniu, Xu Baisheng, and the others kept a vigilant watch over Huang Xiaolong and Xiang Xun.

Finally, half a day later, the first wall trembled.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up after seeing this, and he further increased the power of his chaos golden dragon lightning.

By the end of the day, the first wall was shaking intensely.

Two days later, cracking noises came from the first wall as lines appeared on its surface that spread out rapidly like spiderwebs. Huang Xiaolong increased the power of his chaos golden dragon lightning once more. Several hours later, more and bigger cracks had spread out through the whole wall, and it finally crumbled.

Huang Xiaolong sighed in relief as he removed his palms from Xiang Xun’s head. His head was spinning as fatigue and weakness took over.

“Master!” Xu Baisheng and the others cried out in concern, noticing his condition.

“I’m fine, just need to rest for a while.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and said.

“Thank you Master!” Xiang Xun knelt on his knees as he gratefully thanked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Stand up, luckily, one seal down!”

“Only one seal was resolved?” Xu Baisheng exclaimed and exchanged perplexed glances with the others.

“Master, are there a lot of petrification seals?” Xu Baisheng could not resist asking.

“More than a lot.” The little cow interjected from the side. “At least eight hundred, if not a thousand. This petrification seal is one of the more terrifying chaos level sealing techniques. Xiaolong being able to resolve one seal in less than three days is already not bad.”

One thousand? Eight hundred?

This information shocked Xu Baisheng and the rest.

Xiang Xun nodded in agreement at the little cow’s words. “Senior Xiaoniu is right, the petrification seals inside me exceed nine hundred. On top of that, each layer of seal is stronger than the other. Even though our Master has only resolved one petrification seal, my strength has risen slightly.”

Xiang Xun released his pressure, and his cultivation had already reached the late-Seventh Order God King Realm.

Huang Xiaolong threw several chaos spiritual pills into his mouth and meditated to adjust his condition and recovered his godforce.

However, Huang Xiaolong did not continue to resolve Xiang Xun’s petrification seals after he recovered. Instead, he stepped outside to accompany Yao Chi and Li Lu for a stroll.

Huang Xiaolong continued to resolve Xiang Xun’s petrification seals two days later.

In the blink of an eye, one year went by.

To his disappointment, Huang Xiaolong had managed to resolve only fifty-two ‘walls’ inside Xiang Xun’s body in a whole year. He had stopped after seeing that he can’t deal with the fifty-third ‘wall’ with his current strength.

Apart from resolving Xiang Xun’s petrification seals, Huang Xiaolong also went to put up a task at the Supreme Harmony Hall to collect the required materials for repairing the Dragon Shark Flying Ship. The remuneration Huang Xiaolong offered was very high, therefore, he really did receive quite a lot of needed materials.

Now, he merely lacked a dozen precious materials.

For these dozen of precious materials, Huang Xiaolong decided to look for them at Heavens Avenue.

The Heavens Avenue was not that far away from the Fortune Emperor Palace, with the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s current speed limit, it was a little over a month’s travel.

When Huang Xiaolong told Li Lu and Yao Chi that he would be taking them to Heavens Avenue, both were delighted. Yao Chi was screaming with glee at the thought of shopping.

Huang Xiaolong planned to do that, so he could spend more time with them before setting off to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield and the Floating Twilight Land. No one would know when he would return. And due to the dangers of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield and Floating Twilight Land, he won’t be taking the two women with him over there.

When Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan learned that Huang Xiaolong was going to Heavens Avenue, both clamored that they wanted to go too. Huang Xiaolong was rendered helpless by their persistent nagging, and relented.

For five consecutive days before departing to Heavens Avenue, Huang Xiaolong diligently condensed top grade-nine spirit stones day in and day out. Only then he dared to depart to Heavens Avenue with Xiaoniu, the four women, and the others.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
