Chapter 2291: Someone from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground!

“Island Master, why don’t we raze the city to the ground this very instant? We’ll just capture Liu Zhi and that Sovereign Realm brat that way!” Chen Yizhen suggested.

“That’s right! Island Master, we’ll capture them all before saving Gao Songyuan and the others!” Shao Xinpeng suggested. “We’ll just kill everyone else! We can use this chance to remind other islands of the consequences of challenging us!”

All the enforcers nodded their heads in agreement.

Wang Yuan’s eyes lit up. Just as he thought about razing the Mirage Sea Spiritual City to the ground, a group of experts emerged from the city.

Like Gao Songyuan and those who came previously, Wang Yuan, Chen Yizhen, and the various enforcers stared at Huang Xiaolong and Liu Zhi.

“Are you the master acting behind the scenes?” Wang Yuan glared at Huang Xiaolong and asked, “Speak. Which family do you come from? Are you from a supreme sect? You have guts to mess with my Divine Sea Spiritual Island!”

An indifferent expression remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face “Wang Yuan, didn’t I tell you to only bring the enforcers over? What’s the point of bringing so many experts over? Oh? You thought that I wouldn’t find out? Why don’t you call them out now? There is no point in hiding.”

Even though the other experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island were hiding their aura with a type of sealing restriction, how was it possible for them to hide from Huang Xiaolong’s perception? There wasn’t even a need to talk about the four guardians from the Holy Gate.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze over and looked at a spot in the void not too far away from Wang Yuan. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Everyone, who was standing in front of Huang Xiaolong, stared at each other in shock.

“Hehe, since you have already noticed their presence, there is no need to hide it any longer.” Wang Yuan waved his hand and ordered, “Show yourselves. Come take a look at this Sovereign Realm brat!”

Wang Yuan’s mocking tone couldn’t be more obvious.

As soon as the words left his lips, the space behind him started to tremble. Flying ships appeared one after another, and Venerable Realm experts emerged.

There were a total of ten ships, and five hundred Venerables rode in each one. Five thousand Venerables soon showed themselves!

As they formed an orderly formation behind Wang Yuan and the enforcers, they seemed to blot out of the sky.

A look of satisfaction formed on Wang Yuan’s face. In the past hundreds of thousands of years, he had managed to save the lives of many Venerables, allowing him to build up the power of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island to what it was currently.

Even though there wasn’t a single high-level Venerable, five thousand Venerables were a force to be reckoned with!

Even top-tier factions wouldn’t possess five thousand Venerables!

“Brat, what do you think? Now that I have revealed all my forces, aren’t you going to release Gao Songyuan and the others?” Wang Yuan stared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted. “Get those experts behind you to step forward. I wish to see your family leader or whoever the patriarch of your sect is!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response. “Wang Yuan, you seem to have gotten something wrong.”

“What the f*ck are you talking about?” Wang Yuan sneered, “Are you still dreaming of victory at this point?”

The experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island burst into laughter.

Turning to the four guardians, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Seniors, shall we make our move?”

One of the guardians agreed in amusement. “Why don’t we make this a competition?”

“I wouldn’t dare to challenge seniors...” Huang Xiaolong nearly burst out laughing when he heard the suggestion.

Just as Wang Yuan was about to explode with a barrage of curses, Huang Xiaolong and the four guardians moved.

Reaching out with a single arm each, the guardians slapped downwards.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he wasn’t able to act so casually. A thousand arms appeared behind him as holy light enveloped his body.

Even though it looked familiar, it wasn’t the Xumi Godly Art Huang Xiaolong had learned in the lower worlds. Instead, he had managed to develop an upgraded version of it after studying Wan Zhuoyuan’s holy martial arts!

A thousand arms appeared, and none of them were phantom images. Every single one was a corporeal bodies!

It was as though each arm was Huang Xiaolong’s clone, and they were filled with ancient dragon runes, Sanskrit blessings, and devil curses.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hold back.

Boom!

As the thousand arms fell, the space seemed to shudder as the void showed signs of cracking.

Unable to do a thing, Wang Yuan stared in horror as Huang Xiaolong’s attack came crashing down on him. He was the first to be sent flying, and the enforcers soon followed.

Miserable shrieks filled the air.

When the holy light in the air dissipated, the surroundings regained its serenity.

Not a single person from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island was left standing and massive craters filled the land beneath them.

With a single move from each of them, Huang Xiaolong and the four guardians dealt with the combined strength of all the experts in the Divine Sea Spiritual Island!

Liu Zhi, Feng Tianyu, and everyone else who were on Huang Xiaolong’s side, stared at Wang Yuan and the rest with a dumbfounded expression.

Over five thousand Venerable Realm experts were smashed into the ground!

They were defeated with a single move!

Liu Zhi, Feng Tianyu, and the others weren’t the only ones who were surprised. The four guardians stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. They had never imagined that Huang Xiaolong would improve so quickly and demonstrate such terrifying combat abilities.

When Huang Xiaolong unleashed his secret technique, he managed to attack a thousand Venerable Realm experts, including Wang Yuan. None of those he targeted were weak, and Wang Yuan was at the peak of the late-Third Order Venerable Realm. The enforcers were all in the Third Order Venerable Realm but all of them were sent flying!

One had to know that even late-Fourth Order Venerable Realm Holy Princes with terrifying talent wouldn’t be able to do something like that!

Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong’s battle prowess was stronger than late-Fourth Order Venerable Realm Holy Princes?!

When Huang Xiaolong looked at Wang Yuan and the others who were lying on the ground, he turned to the guardians and chuckled, “I am really unable to match up to seniors.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had taken out a thousand of them, the four guardians had taken out a little more than a thousand each.

One of the guardians, Gu Tianxing, couldn’t help but smile, “We merely did a little better. We old men nearly lost to Your Highness, the Holy Prince!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his hand and laughter filled the air.

Your Highness? Holy Prince?!

When Wang Yuan and the others heard how Gu Tianxing addressed Huang Xiaolong, their bodies shook uncontrollably. Terror filled their eyes and they looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Holy Prince of the Holy Gate?!

Huang Xiaolong?!

As complicated thoughts filled their mind, Huang Xiaolong approached them.

Half a day later, nearly all the experts of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island submitted to Huang Xiaolong. As for the handful who refused to submit, Huang Xiaolong killed them without batting an eyelid.

When Huang Xiaolong accepted those from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island as his subordinates, a group of experts from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground were speeding towards the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground. The person in the lead was a young man who donned golden robes. His aura was suffocating, and it was clear that he was several times stronger than Jiang Tian.

Behind him were Holy Prince Tan Hongyi and several others.
