Chapter 2900: Experts from the Qiao Family

In the depths of the marshes, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the souls of Qiao Shuanghe and the rest.

“You… What do you think you’re doing? How dare you attack us and shatter our bodies?! Our Qiao Family will never let you off! Let me tell you right now! Our Qiao Family has sent out four Dao Venerable Realm experts over to the marshes. They will arrive soon, and all of you will die!” Qiao Shuanghe’s dao soul started screaming the moment Huang Xiaolong brought him out.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the dao soul with a placid expression and asked, “Four Dao Venerables?”

That was perfect! He was missing Dao Venerable Realm subordinates anyway.

After he had revealed his possession of eleven high-order Saint Fates, and his ability to wield cosmos energy, he had managed to draw the attention of everyone in the Divine Tuo Holy World! There were tons of people plotting against him in the dark.

If he managed to subdue several Dao Venerables, he would be able to make them think twice before moving against him!

“That’s right! If you release me now and beg for mercy, we might consider letting you off!” Qiao Shuanghe snarled.

“Otherwise, we’ll exterminate your entire faction!”

“Exterminate His Highness’ faction?” Long Jianfei snorted lightly. “Do you even know who His Highness is?”

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand and stopped Long Jianfei from going further. He didn’t bother explaining anything to Qiao Shuanghe, and he immediately conducted a soul search.

Even half-step Dao Venerables couldn’t search Qiao Shuanghe’s soul, but it was a piece of cake for Huang Xiaolong to do so.

With his cosmos energy, he shattered the defenses around the other party’s dao soul. It didn’t take long for him to look through Qiao Shuanghe’s soul.

In the instant his defenses were broken by Huang Xiaolong’s cosmos energy, Qiao Shuanghe stared at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous look. He couldn’t imagine how a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor like Huang Xiaolong could use cosmos energy!

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to stop now. His cosmos energy rampaged around Qiao Shuanghe’s dao souls like a tsunami, and it quickly filled every inch of his dao soul.

Qiao Shuanghe’s memory poured into Huang Xiaolong’s mind like blood.

Ordinarily, a Primal Ancestor had lived for countless years. Their memories were terrifyingly strong, and if an ordinary First Esteem Dao Venerable tried to absorb the memories of a Primal Ancestor, they would have to do so carefully. Of course, that didn’t apply to Huang Xiaolong. He scanned through the other party’s memory in a flash.

Several minutes later, he was done with Qiao Shuanghe. Not only did he hear of Qiao Shuanghe’s past, but he even learned some secrets about the Qiao Family.

With his cultivation realm at the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, Qiao Shuanghe’s position in the Qiao Family wasn’t low. Moreover, he was from the same generation as the patriarch’s grandson, and he learned a ton of secrets related to the family.

From the other party’s memory, Huang Xiaolong learned that the four Dao Venerables sent by the Qiao Family were all low-level Dao Venerables. The strongest among them was a mid-Third Creation Dao Venerable, and the others were Second Esteem Dao Venerables.

It was slightly surprising they would send a Third Esteem Dao Venerable over to lay claim to the immortal cave!

One had to know that the old ancestor of the Qiao Family was a late-Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable! A Third Esteem Dao Venerable should be an extremely important force in the family! With his abilities, he should be only second to the old ancestor!

It seemed as though the Qiao Family was putting extraordinary emphasis on the immortal cave in the marshes…

“Seems like there’s quite a lot of treasures in the immortal cave!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

If that wasn’t the case, there was no way the Qiao Family would be able to send four Dao Venerables over!

Huang Xiaolong might not have known which Dao Venerable had left behind the immortal cave, but he knew that the value of it was definitely comparable to the Immemorial Immortal Cave he obtained in the past!

At the very least, it should have been left behind by a mid-level Dao Venerable!

Initially, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t hoped for too much when he had received the reports from Duan Zhen. He was only interested in the peak-level poison around it, but now, it seemed as though that wasn’t all it contained! There had to be grand dao pills and grand dao spiritual veins in order for the Qiao Family to place such importance on it! There might even be strands of absolute beginning qi or creation spiritual qi contained within!

After tossing Qiao Shuanghe into the Immemorial Immortal Cave, Huang Xiaolong continued to head deeper into the marshes.

The deeper they went, the more they ran into attacks from the venomous creatures. Of course, none of them could even approach the chariot as they were either killed from a single slap or they suffered even worse from the immemorial fire and ice qilin. Most creatures turned into ice sculptures or specks of dust after the qilins were done with them.

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong arrived in the area around the immortal cave.

It went without saying that restrictions filled the area around them, and Huang Xiaolong quickly surmised that the four Dao Venerables were the ones behind them.

Sending a single punch towards the barrier, sounds of cracking could be heard as traces of light filled the skies. Grand dao runes swirled around the skies before shattering to pieces.

The formations might have been laid down by four Dao Venerables, but they were only strong enough to defend against ordinary low-level Dao Venerables. The barrier around the immortal cave was nothing more than a piece of paper to Huang Xiaolong.

“Who!”

The moment the formation was shattered, several figures shot out from inside the immortal cave. More than sixty experts surrounded Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

After sending out four Dao Venerables, the Qiao Family hadn’t sent out too many experts. There were only slightly more than a hundred Primal Ancestor Realm disciples in the immortal cave, and more than sixty of them were stationed at the entrance.

They were shocked when they discovered Huang Xiaolong’s party. They couldn’t imagine how the weaklings before them had managed to shatter the restrictions left behind by the four Dao Venerables.

There was only a single person who reacted differently among them. As soon as he spotted Duan Zheng, his eyes went wide, and he yelled, “Duan Zheng!”

“Qiao Fengjiang!” A furious expression formed on Duan Zheng’s face the moment he noticed the other party.

Qiao Fengjiang was the friend who had backstabbed him when they were exploring the area. He was sent to guide the Dao Venerables after discovering the immortal cave.

Sucking in a cold breath, Qiao Fengjiang was shocked. He hadn’t expected to run into Duan Feng again, especially after the man was hit by the absolute poison. How did he dispel something so strong?

Staring at Duan Zheng, one of the half-step Dao Venerables of the Qiao Family asked, “Fengjiang, is that the Duan Family’s disciple you were talking about?”

“That’s right, Lord Qiao Wu.”

Qiao Wu turned to Duan Zheng and growled, “We were planning to send people over to hunt you down. Who would have thought that you would run straight back into us?” A trace of suspicion flashed through his eyes the next moment. “How did you neutralize the poison?!”

However, he felt something click in his head the next moment. “Don’t tell me you managed to obtain the medicine of creation?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If he had managed to neutralize absolute poison, there would only be one explanation. He definitely managed to obtain a peerless medicine.

By quietly standing behind Huang Xiaolong, Duan Zheng didn’t bother replying to the man from the Qiao Family. With Huang Xiaolong summoning his dao souls, he tried to look for the four Dao Venerables. Unable to locate any one of them, Huang Xiaolong could only assume that they had entered the immortal cave.

Since the time the cave was discovered, it had already been three months. With their speed, they should have already entered the depths of the immortal cave.

No longer in the mood to mess with the disciples guarding the entrance, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand to drag Qiao Wu and the other disciples towards him.

When Qiao Wu was still thinking about whether or not Duan Zheng had obtained the medicine of creation, he realized that a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor was trying to make a move on them. A cold snort escaped his lips. “Dumb*ss!”

As soon as he spoke, he raised his hand to send a slap flying towards Huang Xiaolong.
