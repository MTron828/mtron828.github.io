Chapter 2172: My Turn? Probably Not

“Is that so?’ Huang Xiaolong watched the happily laughing Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng, “A peak late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm is sufficient to kill you!”

Although Huang Xiaolong had not broken through to Seventh Order Sovereign Realm after refining the Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills and Great Treasure Dragon Pill, his cultivation had reached the limit of peak late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm. Huang Xiaolong had absolute certainty that he could kill the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng within the boundary of the Heavenly Saint Country!

“Huang Xiaolong, stop farting here. There is no need for Younger Brother Dong Cheng to take action. I am enough to kill you on my own!” The Heavenly Master’s harsh voice interjected coldly.

The Heavenly Master was flying over rapidly from the distant mountain.

In his arms was Tian Chen, who was already fed with a healing pill. Thus his injuries were under control at the moment. Despite that, the Heavenly Master could see that it would take a hundred thousand years, maybe more, for Tian Chen to heal completely. Even so, his injuries would leave some hidden sequels that would hinder his future cultivation.

This intensified the Heavenly Master’s desire to kill Huang Xiaolong.

The Heavenly Master passed Tian Chen to a Heavenly World’s expert and then came to the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng’s side. “Brother Dong Cheng, let me do it. I want to chop this dog into pieces with my own hands!”

In his opinion, as long as Huang Xiaolong had not stepped into high-level Sovereign Realm, he could easily suppress him since his Great Purity Secret Art had advanced to major completion!

He wanted Huang Xiaolong to die at his hands and use Huang Xiaolong’s blood to appease his killing intent.

After hearing that the Heavenly Master wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong personally, the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng hesitated for a while, then nodded, “Alright, I shall guard the sides for Big Brother Heavenly Master to prevent Huang Xiaolong from escaping!”

“Great! My thanks to Younger Brother Dong Cheng!” The Heavenly Master responded.

The two conversed, ignoring Huang Xiaolong as if he was nothing but a fish on the chopping board, waiting to be killed.

“Lord, how about we join hands?” The Heavenly Saint Ruler approached Huang Xiaolong and asked.

Lord?!!!!

Upon hearing the Heavenly Saint Ruler call Huang Xiaolong as Lord, the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng and Heavenly Master were clearly wide-eyed with astonishment.

“There is no need. You can retreat.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, declining in a flat tone.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler complied respectfully and retreated to the distance.

The Heavenly Master’s cold voice was filled with mockery, “Heavenly Saint Ruler you are still one of the top ten experts in Heavens Path no matter what. Despite that, and being a late-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm expert, you actually recognize a Sixth Order Sovereign junior as your Lord? You really stomped on the faces of all Heavens Path’s experts!”

Huang Xiaolong strode forward leisurely, approaching the Heavenly Master step by step as he spoke, “You have too many last words, but are you done? Since you want to die first, I shall kill you before the Heavenly Terror Ruler!”

With every step Huang Xiaolong took, the radiance behind him became hotter and glaring,

Layers of sacred light rose behind Huang Xiaolong like a chain of radiant suns. Huang Xiaolong was looking like the god of radiance who had created and brought radiance to the world.

Under Huang Xiaolong’s radiant rays, the Heavenly Saint Country’s injured disciples discovered the injuries on their bodies had begun healing at shocking speed. Their wounds closed up in the blink of an eye, and even their internal injuries recovered immediately.

Not only that, but all disciples of the Heavenly Saint Country also felt like they were brimming with vitality. There was an endless energy filling every inch of their bodies.

The Heavenly Master sneered when he noticed this phenomenon, “Merely a small radiance energy trick. Your radiance energy came from the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, but it is only capable of saving a handful of people. Look how my Great Purity Secret Art is going to bury all your radiance!” He took out the God Burying Coffin. The God Burying Coffin rose into the air and grew bigger, becoming a giant coffin. The coffin cover slowly opened, spewing abundant dead qi. The living plants in the Heavenly Saint Country withered rapidly as their vitality was sucked out once again.

The God Burying Coffin’s dead qi soared to the sky, condensing into phantoms of death gods.

“Go!”

The Heavenly Master barked with a wave of his hand.

The God Burying Coffin whistled forward, slamming down on Huang Xiaolong.

The Heavenly Saint Country’s disciples felt extremely uncomfortable, as if their souls were being emptied out. Under the devouring power of the God Burying Coffin, Huang Xiaolong’s layers of radiance light were being sucked into the God Burying Coffin in a frenzy.

The God Burying Coffin plunders everything as it targeted Huang Xiaolong. In the blink of an eye, it crossed the distance of several thousand miles, reaching Huang Xiaolong.

Covering a distance of several hundred miles was merely a matter of a split second for the God Burying Coffin.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s radiance disappear into the God Burying Coffin, the Heavenly Master laughed sonorously, “Huang Xiaolong, my God Burying Coffin will bury all your radiance. It’s your turn now! Be buried inside!” With that said, gloomy gray light burst from his body as he spurred the God Burying Coffin to the limit. The coffin cover flipped open, wanting to swallow Huang Xiaolong into its belly.

In an instant, all vitality within a hundred million miles was sucked into the coffin.

A vortex of death formed at the mouth of the God Burying Coffin. It was a gray death vortex that exuded despair. Everyone had an illusion that they were trapped inside a bottomless death abyss, with no hope of living.

Even the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts outside a hundred million radius were extremely discomfited.

“Xiaolong!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Lord!”

The little cow, King of Grandmist, Heavenly Saint Ruler, Marshal Lan Shifan, and the others cried out anxiously.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the God Burying Coffin swooping down on him from above with a faint, nonchalant smile as he spoke, “My turn? Not necessarily!”

Then, the radiance from his body that was seemingly swallowed by the God Burying Coffin surged out once again. Moreover, it was like a tsunami at the end of the world, a hundred times stronger than before.

The entire Heavenly Saint Country’s people in every corner could see this radiance. Everyone was enveloped by hope, filled with vitality and the desire to survive.

Moreover, the radiance light that the God Burying Coffin had swallowed previously shone brightly from the coffin’s belly, and the boundless dead qi from the coffin was actually suppressed!

Huang Xiaolong roared and punched out with his fist.

A burst of radiance!

It was like the explosion of ten thousand suns.

Boom! Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed accurately on the God Burying Coffin.

The mountain-sized God Burying Coffin was almost knocked to outer space with one punch from Huang Xiaolong. Then it came smashing down above the Heavenly Master’s head. The hundred million dead gods circulating around the God Burying Coffin were shrieking in pain, shattered by Huang Xiaolong’s punch.

The Heavenly Master was out of his mind, looking at the God Burying Coffin right above his head. He raised his hands and turned his wrists in sync, “Qi Swallowing Cosmos!”

Startling sea of qi flooded out from his hands to catch the God Burying Coffin.

“Watch out!” The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng shouted a warning as he prepared to interfere.

However, the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng’s warning was still half a step late. At this time, Huang Xiaolong punched across space, and the fist force reached the Heavenly Master in an instant.

The Heavenly Master panicked for a second, but before he could react, his chest exploded from Huang Xiaolong’s fist force hitting him. His body smashed to the ground like a broken kite, crushing several mountains in between.

The ground trembled when the God Burying Coffin crashed.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you?!” Dong Cheng roared in anger, the Bone Spur of the Crow thrust at Huang Xiaolong. A blinding cold gleam pierced the sky through layers of space, reaching Huang Xiaolong in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t have the time to dodge, and the cold gleam successfully struck Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

A triumphant smile rose to Dong Cheng’s face.
