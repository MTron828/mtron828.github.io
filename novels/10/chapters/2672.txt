Chapter 2673: Leaving the Sky Opening Island

Huang Xiaolong flew forward for a long time, yet he couldn’t see the end of this space.

As he flew, Huang Xiaolong saw many strange phenomena that couldn't be seen outside, such as upside-down rainbows. The normal rainbows arched across the sky like a bow, but here, the rainbows’ ends faced up.

What surprised Huang Xiaolong was the quiet surrounding, and it seemed that the further in he flew, it turned into a thick silence, yet Huang Xiaolong couldn’t detect anything wrong. His three holy souls’ divine sense did not find any abnormality.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say nothing in the world could hide from his three holy souls’ senses. Of course, there was still an exception if the other party was a high-level Primal Ancestor Realm expert.

Huang Xiaolong flew onward for a whole day.

It was a stretch of plains after another.

In the grand dao source spring area was a huge cluster of holy spiritual veins, an array of holy trees and holy fruits that dazzled one’s sight, but here, there was nothing. No holy spiritual veins, no holy trees, no holy herbs, much less a grand dao treasure.

Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be like this.

Even the Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi believed that there were many grand dao treasures in the depths of Sky Opening Island. Therefore, there shouldn’t be only the Tree of Grand Dao and grand dao source spring.

But Huang Xiaolong didn’t see any grand dao treasures except for the said two.

Huang Xiaolong was doubtful.

A day later, Huang Xiaolong reached a stretch of mountainous region, and he sensed a pair of eyes watching him from above.

This kind of feeling made him extremely uncomfortable. Huang Xiaolong’s three holy souls swept over the sky, but that pair of eyes seemed to disappear.

“Who? Come out!” Huang Xiaolong’s expression was stern and sullen as he turned around abruptly, and punched towards the sky in the distance—r-rumble!

The force of Huang Xiaolong’s fist whistled across the air, traversing several hundred million miles, reaching the deep part of the Sky Opening Island.

The world shook as his fist force tore a hole through space.

Chaotic energy spewed out from the torn space as it took a while for the torn space to recover.

Other than that, there was nothing else.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

Even this failed to force it out?!

Huang Xiaolong once again looked around carefully, then continued flying onward after finding nothing. But a short time later, the feeling of being watched surfaced again. Huang Xiaolong continued to punch out with his fist, but apart from smashing out a space hole and spewing out turbulent space energy, he did not find anything else.

Huang Xiaolong frowned suspiciously.

Was it a hallucination? Or was I mistaken?

Probably not.

A high-level Primal Ancestor?

This Sky Opening Island had appeared not long after the Holy World and Alien Lands had come into existence. Hence, it was not strange that there was a high-level Primal Ancestor there. His question was, why was the other side merely observing him, and not taking any other action?

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong stopped attacking, ignoring this person’s observation. Of course, Huang Xiaolong did not lower his guard. As soon as the other party took action, he would capture it at lightning speed.

Several days later.

Huang Xiaolong came upon a huge yellow water river.

This yellow river was naturally not the Xuanhuang Turbid Water river, but an ordinary river. Yet Huang Xiaolong sensed this river’s horror, or more accurately speaking, the horror of the creature hiding inside this river. Under Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls’ senses, within the river, there were at least five mid-level Primal Ancestor Realm sky opening beasts!

Five mid-level Primal Ancestor Realm!

Sky opening beasts!

It was certain that any Primal Ancestor expert, whether from the Holy World or Alien Lands, would feel his scalp go numb in this situation. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong looked at the other side of the river.

On the other side were churning waters of the World River. In other words, as long as he crossed this huge river and reached the other side, he would be able to leave this Sky Opening Island.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated briefly before accelerating forward.

Barely ten meters across the river, five deafening roars thundered simultaneously, and from the bottom of the river, five enormous figures shot into the air.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong harrumphed coldly, and one thousand arms emerged from his back. The Thousand Armed Holy Devil slapped onto the five enormous figures.

“Hmph!”

“Sea of Endless Demons!”

Rumble!

In the blink of an eye, the five enormous sky opening beasts were sent back into the riverbed, raising thousand meters of water splashing everywhere.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong arrived on the other side of the river, exiting the Sky Opening Island.

The moment Huang Xiaolong left the Sky Opening Island, those five Primal Ancestor Realm sky opening beasts that were sent back to the riverbed by Huang Xiaolong flew out from the river again, roaring in a fury. Shocking soundwaves shook the air. The World River’s several million miles of water surface was brought high into the air by the soundwaves. Just these soundwaves could jar many peak late-Ninth True Saints to their deaths.

These five sky opening beasts growled and roared, but kept their movements in the air within the width of the river, glaring ferociously at Huang Xiaolong without attacking.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong mumbled inwardly. ‘My guess is right. The sky opening beasts on the Sky Opening Island seem to be restrained by something. Even Primal Ancestor Realm sky opening beasts cannot leave the Sky Opening Island, and those five sky opening beasts are no exception.’

Huang Xiaolong took one long look at the Sky Opening Island.

Ever since he had left the Sky Opening Island’s boundary, that feeling of being watched had disappeared completely.

A second later, Huang Xiaolong stopped dallying and sped away.

As for the Xuanhuang Water, and this Xuanhuang Stone, he would think of a way in the future. For the moment, with that unknown existence around, he wouldn’t have a chance to take away this Xuanhuang Stone.

Of course, he would return here again after advancing to Ninth Heaven True Saint realm!

At that time, that mysterious, unknown existence, wouldn’t be able to hide from his holy souls.

Huang Xiaolong even suspected all Primal Ancestor Realm and True Saint Realm sky opening beasts were under that unknown existence’s control, forbidding them from leaving the island. Then again, it might also be due to the Sky Opening Island’s restriction that contained these sky opening beasts to the island.

After leaving the Sky Opening Island, Huang Xiaolong’s mood lightened significantly. From jumping into the Death Cave to finding the grand dao source spring, his life and death adventure this time once again strengthened his will and his heart towards dao.

“I wonder how’s Yuan Qianxing’s group doing now.” A cold light gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he thought of his enemies, and he flew in the direction of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had planned to visit the Dragon Fist Race after leaving the Sky Opening Island, as he wanted to inquire about the Creation Records. But after he was besieged by Yuan Qianxing’s group and forced to jump into the Death Cave, no matter what, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t bring himself to swallow this foul breath.

Mo Jincheng! I am here!

Huang Xiaolong turned into a streak of light, passing through the various World River areas, getting close to the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s headquarters.

Although Huang Xiaolong had not broken through to high-level True Saint Realm, at his current strength, in the entire Holy World and Alien Lands, not many people could beat his speed.

Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong reached the border of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s territory.
