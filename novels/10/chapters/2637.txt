Chapter 2638: Have a Taste of This!

“Mother f*cker! Why are you crying? Are you insulted because I touched you?!” Feitian Zhan roared at the woman as a sinister smile formed on his lips. “Humans are such vile creatures!” As soon as he spoke, he sent her flying with a single slap.

Muffled cries escaped her lips as blood streamed down the side of her cheeks.

Everyone around them formed a wide berth, as no one dared to approach the members of the Flying Heaven Race.

“B*tch! Why aren’t you crawling back here?” Feitian Zhan snapped at her, “If you don’t crawl over here immediately, I’ll strip you naked in the streets and let everyone see how much of a slut you are!”

The lady called Rou’er felt the blood draining from her face as she hastily crawled over to Feitian Zhan.

Roaring laughter rang through the skies as he addressed the disciples of the Alien Race around him. “Do you see that? Hahaha! These humans are vile creatures! Look at the women of the human race! They’re worse than sluts!”

The members of the Alien Race laughed along with him when they heard what he said.

In the Alien Lands, scenes like that were aplenty.

The people from human race were lower existences in their eyes, and the female disciples of the human race were treated as playthings.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but frown when he noticed their treatment.

Since everyone in the crowd left when Feitian Zhan slapped Rou’er, Huang Xiaolong’s position became extremely eye-catching as he was the only one left in the middle of the street.

When Feitian Zhan caught sight of Huang Xiaolong, he couldn’t help but sneer, “Brat, are you planning to save the beauty? Get over here now! If you bark several times, I can lend her to you for a few days! Hahaha!”

Roaring laughter filled the air once again.

Since Huang Xiaolong was greeted by Fei Yanzi and the various Eminent Elders, not many people knew of his existence.

With Feitian Zhan’s status, he wouldn’t know that Huang Xiaolong was in the Flying Heaven Domain even if he exhausted all his connections.

“Brat, why are you still standing there? Come over here and bark like a dog! You can have the woman then!” Another disciple of the Flying Heaven Race, Feitian Qingyi, snorted, “Look at her! If you miss this chance, you will never be able to embrace a beauty like her again!”

It was too bad that his mocking laughter turned into a miserable shriek as soon as he completed his sentence. Drawing a beautiful arc across the sky, he slammed into the side of the street, shattering the ground under him.

The laughter stopped instantly as everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong with a look of disbelief on their faces. The members of the Flying Heaven Race couldn’t believe that Feitian Qingqi was sent flying.

Even the lady from the human race, Rou’er, was stunned.

It took quite some time for Feitian Zhan and the others to snap back to reality, but when they did, rage bubbled in their hearts. “Brat, did you do that?”

He had no idea who had made the move earlier, but his suspicion was directed to Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to deny it.

“How dare you?!” Feitian Zhan hadn’t expected Huang Xiaolong to admit it so easily, and a sinister smile soon formed on his face. “Don’t you know that even if the young sect master of the Chen Luo Sect, Chen Muguang, meets me, he will have to lower his head like an obedient dog?”

“Oh? I didn’t know that,” Huang Xiaolong responded casually. However, his hand didn’t remain idle. With a single slap, he sent Feitian Zhan flying.

“Who cares about what Chen Muguang must do when he meets you?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air, and it was rudely interrupted with Feitian Zhan’s shrill cry. Like Feitian Qingyi, he was sent flying too. When he finally landed, he crashed into Feitian Qingqi’s body.

The sound of bones snapping could be heard.

No one could believe what they were seeing. Even the members of the Flying Heaven Race were confused. One had to know that Feitian Zhan was a terrifying existence when compared to Feitian Qingyi! He wasn’t just a core disciple of the Flying Heaven Race, but he was also the son of Eminent Elder Feitian Jin!

Of course, confusion was one thing. They were stunned when Huang Xiaolong revealed his strength. One had to know that Feitian Zhan was a True Saint Realm expert, and he was at the peak of the late-First Heaven True Saint Realm! However, he was sent flying with a single slap from the human!

The lady from the human race, Rou’er, stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock

In her eyes, Feitian Zhan was an indomitable existence! He could walk sideways even if he wanted to in the Flying Heaven Race, and not a single person dared to go against him! However, Huang Xiaolong had sent him flying with a single slap!

Feitian Zhan crawled to his feet when everyone was still stuck in a state of shock. As he held his swollen face, killing intent burst out from his eyes.

He roared, “How dare a slave like you slap me?! How dare you?! Do you even know who I am?!”

Even if Chen Muguang was present, he would have to lower his head before Feitian Zhan. Even so, Huang Xiaolong had the guts to slap him in front of so many people, including his slaves!

He felt extremely humiliated, and the only thought in his mind was to kill the man!

“You’re dead! Your entire clan will be exterminated!” The rage in his heart burned bright as he continued to scream at Huang Xiaolong.

Reaching out with a single finger, Huang Xiaolong lightly flicked it and sent Feitian Zhan flying. After flying away, the man popped like a balloon, and blood rained down from the skies.

Those around him were drenched in sticky red blood, and Feitian Qingyi, who was about to rage at Huang Xiaolong forgot what he wanted to say. He stared at Huang Xiaolong with his mouth open and pieces of flesh rained down from above. They were none other than the remains of Feitian Zhan, and the pieces of flesh slowly slid down his face.

Unprecedented fear gripped his heart as Feitian Zhan’s holy soul tore through the skies to escape.

Ignoring the b*stard, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with the holy soul of a First Heaven True Saint. After all, the holy souls of Chan Wuwo and several other high-level True Saints were stuck in the Cangqiong Dao Palace. He didn’t care if a First Heaven True Saint Realm’s holy soul escaped.

“You!” Feitian Qingyi no longer dared to remain in the plaza as he left with the disciples of the Flying Heaven Race. The women from the human race were left behind as they made their escape.

In Feitian Jin’s cultivation palace, discussions were going on with the other Eminent Elders as a golden light charged into the hall. As he looked at it carefully, Feitian Jin saw his son’s holy soul flying towards him.

“Zhan’er, you!” Feitian Jin jumped in fright when he saw what had happened.

“Father, you have to save me! Take revenge and kill that mongrel of the human race!” Feitian Zhan screamed, “He destroyed my physical body!”

“What?!” Feitian Jin and the other doyens stared at him in fright.

“What’s going on?! Who did this to you?!” Feitian Jin roared in anger.

Going through the entire series of events, Feitian Zhan painted Huang Xiaolong as someone who had destroyed his physical body just because of a slight misunderstanding.

“Could it be the same Huang Xiaolong?!” One of the Eminent Elders asked.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” The other Eminent Elders screamed in fright. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It must be him! Which other human will behave so arrogantly in our Flying Heaven Race?! He even dared to shatter Zhan’er’s physical body…”

A trace of hatred flashed in Feitian Jin’s eyes as he gnashed his teeth in a fury. “Huang Xiaolong, I’ll shatter your physical body with the Flying Heaven Grand Formation! How dare you lay your hands on my son?!”
