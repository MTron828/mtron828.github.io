Huang Xiaolong’s chest slightly tightened with tension, looking at the numerous malevolent giant arms.

This was the notorious Grand Fiend God Formation!

The malevolent giant arms were different from the giant arms condensed from nefarious qi earlier, as each of these giant arms was made out of real flesh and blood.

Rumors had it that every giant arm of the Grand Fiend God Formation used the generations of Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Emperor Realm experts’ arms as materials!

Thus, every malevolent arm within the Grand Fiend God Formation contained the concentrated nefarious qi of a Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert’s lifetime accumulation of nefarious qi. Hence, it was not hard to imagine the astounding amount of nefarious qi.

Every giant arm had been tempered for numerous years by the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts. The hardness of these giant arms was stronger than most grandmist spiritual artifacts.

These arms were linked together like a chain which amplified these numerous Emperor Realm experts’ nefarious qi. Therefore, breaking this Grand Fiend God Formation was akin to breaking a solid defensive wall formed by countless Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts.

Feng Chu’s statement from earlier that only an existence who had surpassed the Emperor Realm could break out from the formation was no exaggeration by any means.

In truth, even an existence that had surpassed the Emperor Realm would be hard-pressed to break out from this Grand Fiend God Formation.

“Huang Xiaolong, looking at the sake of your Master, the King of Grandmist, as long as you hand out all the peerless treasures on you, and offer up your sixteen wings, my Fiend God Emperor Palace can spare your life!” Feng Chu watched Huang Xiaolong intently as he went on coldly, “I’ll give you only one chance. I hope you will seize it. Think it through before answering me.”

Feng Chu was full of confidence since the Grand Fiend God Formation was already activated.

In his opinion, no matter how many secrets Huang Xiaolong had, how many trump cards were up his sleeves, he couldn’t escape the Grand Fiend God Formation.

Moreover, he really planned to spare Huang Xiaolong if he handed out all of his treasures and offered up his sixteen wings.

After all, backing Huang Xiaolong was the King of Grandmist. Even though the Fiend God Emperor Palace was strong with Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s support, Feng Chu had to think of the consequences.

No matter who it was, they couldn’t sneeze at the King of Grandmist’s wrath.

Hearing Feng Chu’s words, Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Looking at the smiling Huang Xiaolong, Feng Chu’s expression clouded in an instant. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As expected, Huang Xiaolong spoke, “Feng Chu, I don’t need to think it through. Looking at the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s face, take out the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s treasury, and offer up your heads. I can consider not annihilating the Fiend God Emperor Palace.” He paused for a second, then added, “I’ll only give you one chance as well. I hope you think it through before answering me.”

“What?!”

“Huang Xiaolong, do you want to die!?”

The Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan was enraged and was the first to blast at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, we pity you. So we gave you a chance to beg for mercy. But you don’t know how to appreciate it. So what if your Master is the King of Grandmist?! So what if your Senior Brother is Jiang Hong? If we want to kill you, it’s as easy as killing a dog!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed dangerously as he asked, “I’ve heard that you have an archdevil bloodline. Am I correct?”

Feng Chan was stumped by the unexpected question but raised his chin and admitted proudly, “That’s right. I have a king of supreme godhead, an archdevil bloodline, and on top of that, the Fiend Spirit Physique!”

King of supreme godhead, archdevil bloodline, and Fiend Spirit Physique!

It had to be said, the Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan’s talent was indeed shocking. No wonder Feng Chan was hailed as the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s greatest genius of all time. This level of talent didn’t lose out much even when compared to the Heavenly Prince Di Jing.

On the contrary, Huang Xiaolong snickered at Feng Chan’s words, “Since you have an archdevil bloodline, I am not so worried anymore. After I devour you and refine your archdevil bloodline, it would help my archdevil bloodline evolve one more time.”

As Huang Xiaolong’s archdevils bloodline evolved and became purer, his cultivation speed increased. This brought the day of advancing to the Emperor Realm closer by each day.

Currently, the devil’s army was in the midst of preparing an attack on the Divine World. With the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe at the helm, Huang Xiaolong needed to break through to Emperor Realm before that.

Only this way would he have enough power to ensure he survived when the time came.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re seeking death!” Feng Chan’s killing intent needled hearing that Huang Xiaolong had the audacity to want to devour his archdevil bloodline. In a flicker, he turned into a huge fiend body. His archdevil bloodline was pushed to the extreme, and he punched out with both fists at Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Chu did not stop Feng Chan’s action.

However, the surrounding Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors’ godforce was locked onto the two odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong to prevent them from interfering with Feng Chan.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent watching Feng Chan’s fists coming at him, even though Feng Chan’s strength had already reached the early Ninth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, Huang Xiaolong had a greater understanding of his own strength.

Feng Chan’s fists were almost right in front of his eyes before Huang Xiaolong raised his hands to meet the attack.

Rum~rumble!

In the next moment, Feng Chan tumbled backward in space like a broken kite. His mouth, nose, ears, eyes, and various places on his body were spurting blood.

"Young Lord!"

Liu Yuan and the others were taken aback and swiftly rushed out to catch Feng Chan.

There were lines all over Feng Chan’s body like cracked porcelain as blood seeped out nonstop. It seemed like Feng Chan’s body would collapse into pieces any second.

Liu Yuan and the other Ancestors hastened to rescue Feng Chan in a fluster.

Cold gleams flickered across Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu’s scarlet eyes, his hostile gaze fixed on Huang Xiaolong. He had intended to have his son Feng Chan test if Huang Xiaolong’s strength was really as amazing as the rumors claimed. But who would’ve thought that even with his son’s strength and talent, Huang Xiaolong could injure him in one move?

Viciousness roiled in his eyes like two sharp blades, enveloping Huang Xiaolong.

However, Feng Chu did not attack impulsively. His attention shifted to the two odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong, and he said, “Both of you were Senior King of Darkness’ invincible gods of war in the past. Why humble yourself to follow an insignificant Heavenly Monarch like Huang Xiaolong? What benefits has he given you? If you’re willing to join our Fiend God Emperor Palace, I am willing to govern the Fiend God Emperor Palace with the both of you. Brothers may take any treasures from our treasury!”

Govern the Fiend God Emperor Palace!

This was nothing less than supreme authority. Anyone would be greatly tempted by this offer. After all, the Fiend God Emperor Palace ranked third among thousands of Emperor Palaces, and its strength was not as simple as it seemed on the surface. Just the several bloodbaths on the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s record spoke volumes of their power and strength.

On top of that, Feng Chu promised the two odd beasts a choice of the treasures from inside the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s treasury.

Huang Xiaolong sneered. If it were someone else, they would have betrayed him on the spot after hearing such conditions, but Feng Chu had chosen the two odd beasts as the wrong targets.

The two odd beasts remained cold and indifferent as if they had not heard Feng Chu’s words.

“If two brothers are not reassured, I can make a heaven oath.” Feng Chu was unwilling to give up despite the two odd beasts’ tepid reaction; thus, he added.

However, just as Feng Chu finished speaking, the two odd beasts roared and reverted to their real size, and their claws struck out.
