Chapter 3664: Breaking the FormationReêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

On the surface, Zhu Qiming of the Zhu Family was the most talented disciple of the Zhu Family’s second generation. He was also said to be the strongest! However, many experts knew that that was false. The one who was the strongest in the second generation of the Zhu Family was Zhu Ji!

The only reason he didn’t stand out was because he hated being in the limelight.

Zhu Ji might not be as strong as Mei Jie, but he wasn’t too far off.

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Come out here if you wish to speak to me!”

He might not be loud, but his words seemed to contain a formless pressure that made everyone submit.

The marshals in the Zhu Lan Palace raged when they heard what he said.

One of them roared with anger, “How dare you speak down to His Majesty? Who do you think you are? If you have the guts, come into our palace!”

The Zhu Lan Palace was created by Zhu Chen and the various experts of the Zhu Family after expanding a huge amount of resources. The marshal who spoke was sure that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to barge his way in! That was the basis of his confidence.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t react too much. He simply reached his hand into the void and stretched into the Zhu Lan Palace.

As soon as he did, the grand formations in the palace reacted. A myriad of lights burst through the void and extended through countless layers of space.

A horrifying pressure shot straight towards Huang Xiaolong and his group.

One had to say that the power contained in the formations caused Jian Wushuang and the rest to be slightly taken aback.

It was indeed strong.

Huang Xiaolong snorted lightly and the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared. Rays of starlight fell and blocked off the shockwaves from the formations.

Next, he clenched his fists tightly after it reached into the palace. The resistance put up by the barrier was crushed by him.

Zhu Ji panicked instantly. “Star Dragon Divine Tree?! Experts of the Zhu Family and subjects of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire, listen to my commands! Assist the formation immediately and resist the enemy attack!”

Everyone in the palace poured their grand cosmos energy into the formation and pillars of light emerged to stop Huang Xiaolong’s palm.

Raising an eyebrow in surprise, Huang Xiaolong finally focused.

The experts in the palace heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that they successfully stopped the enemy.

The marshal who had taunted Huang Xiaolong earlier relaxed instantly.

He continued arrogantly, “Hah! What did I tell you! The grand formation was laid down by Lord Zhu Chen personally! It combines the power of the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire and the surrounding heaven and earth qi! Not even the Dragon Overlord can force his way in here! You’re overestimating yourself!”

“F*ck off back to your mother’s womb and drink your milk!”

“When Lord Zhu Chen returns, you’re dead!”

The marshal who was yelling wasn’t anyone special. Instead, it was Zhu Chen’s second son, Zhu Yao! He was the fifth strongest expert in the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire!

Zhu Yao’s words caused a round of laughter to ring through the palace.

A frown formed on Jian Wushuang’s face and he was just about to join in the assault when he was stopped by Huang Xiaolong. “Stay back.”

Huang Xiaolong turned serious as he looked at the palace and Jian Wushuang and the others quickly retreated behind him.

Rising into the air, Huang Xiaolong hovered above the palace as the Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand. His 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out of his body in a massive tide as a golden glow surrounded his weapon. The world turned completely golden and everyone squinted their eyes to adapt to the sudden dazzle.

“Three… Three Gods Halberd!” Zhu Ji cried.

The young man who appeared out of nowhere actually had the Star Dragon Divine Tree and Three Gods Halberd!

Not a single one of the five overlords had more than one universe treasure!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about Zhu Ji’s surprise. When the rays around the halberd reached its peak intensity, he threw it at the palace.

It turned into a streak of light and it shot towards the Zhu Lan Palace with a terrifying force.

It looked like a massive sun that soared through the air. The space around the halberd crumbled into pieces instantly.

The city shook violently under the might of Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

Zhu Ji’s expression changed once again. He no longer held back and pushed the grand cosmos energy in his body to the limit. He waved the Zhu Lan Blade and roared, “Full power! We have to hold on!”

The blade in his hand swept out and created countless blade lights that shot towards the Three Gods Halberd.

Jian Wushuang was taken aback by Zhu Ji’s blade intent. From the looks of it, Zhu Ji’s blade intent was comparable to his own! In the future, Zhu Ji might just surpass him!

Buzz!

The blade intent crashed into the Three Gods Halberd but it was completely useless! It shattered into pieces and the Three Gods Halberd continued straight for the palace.

Before the halberd could arrive, everyone within felt the horrifying pressure coming from it.

Under their frightened gaze, the halberd smashed into the grand formation.

Boom!

The blast reverberated through the city and cracks started to form on the ground below.

Along with the loud blast, the experts in the Zhu Lan Celestial Empire felt their dao souls leap out of their bodies. They spat out a mouthful of blood and those who were weaker had blood leaking from all their orifices.

Zhu Ji and Zhu Yao were naturally unable to avoid their terrible fate. They vomited blood non-stop.

The Three Gods Halberd stabbed deep into the formation and turned everything around it to dust.

In the blink of an eye, the powerful grand formation dimmed and the faces of everyone in the palace were filled with shock. The grand formation was torn apart!

Chen Bi had long since fainted, but no one knew if it was from fright or from the pressure coming from the halberd.

Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Roots and branches extended all over the city and locked down the entire area. Huang Xiaolong took a single step and entered the palace.
