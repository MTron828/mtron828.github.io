Chapter 2211: Don’t Let Him Escape!

“Yes, father!” Zhang Haochen yelled in excitement, and he quickly passed down his father’s order to gather all the esteemed guest masters and guards in the manor.

It didn’t take long for him to gather all of them.

After the young prince explained the situation with Huang Xiaolong, a solemn expression appeared on his face. “It’s very likely that this person is a person from the Black Devil Sect. We have to capture him in case he makes his escape!”

A middle-aged man clad in yellow robes replied with arrogance, “Prince Qian can rest assured, even if he really is an early-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch, I’ll be able to take him down in an instant!”

This middle-aged man was precisely Master Yin, and he was also one of the strongest guest masters staying in the manor. Even though he was only an early Fourth-Order Heavenly Monarch himself, he had cultivated some sort of secret art passed down by a Sovereign. No one in the same realm was his opponent!

A smile appeared on Prince Qian’s face. “I will have to trouble Master Yin to take care of this. Of course, I won’t be stingy with the rewards when the matter is concluded.”

“You’re too polite. Contributing to the safety of the manor is our duty!!” Master Yin laughed.

In an instant, laughter filled the courtyard.

As soon as the laughter died down, the Prince Qian led the various experts towards the Elegant Courtyard.

At the exact same moment, Zhang Wenyue also received a report from her maid, and a look of shock appeared on her face. She summoned several maids and ran over to the Elegant courtyard as quickly as she could.

...

Upon feeling the murderous intent in the manor, Huang Xiaolong slowly left his room and walked out into the middle of the courtyard.

The moment he arrived in the center of his courtyard, Huang Xiaolong saw Prince Qian leading all the experts in the manor towards him. Guards had already surrounded his courtyard, and there was nowhere he could go.

The bows and arrows held by the guards weren’t ordinary ones, and every single one of them were engraved with ancient runes that allowed the arrows to pierce through the defenses of an early-level Heavenly Monarch expert.

An indifferent expression remained on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he noticed the number of experts rushing towards him.

The Prince Qian frowned when he saw the nonchalant expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Is he the one?” Prince Qian asked Zhang Haochen.

“That’s him.” However, he had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was until this very moment. After all, he had never seen Huang Xiaolong before.

Prince Qian saw the faint bloody scars on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he said coldly, “Are you the person my daughter saved? Speak. What is your intention of pretending to be injured? Are you trying to sneak into my manor?”

“Intention?” Huang Xiaolong smiled with indifference and glanced around, “To me, there’s no difference between your shabby manor, and the slums out there. In fact, there’s nothing here that can catch my eye.”

Even though the Elegant Courtyard was the best courtyard in the manor, the spirit jade and spirit wood decorations were nothing better than trash to him!

Compared to his palace in the Blue Dragon Heavenly Country, this manor was nothing more than a dilapidated shack in the countryside!

Of course, the Prince Qian and the others were not amused by his reply.

“Don’t spout nonsense!” A chilly light emerged from Zhang Haochen’s eyes. “Do you think that we’re stupid? Why is someone from the Black Devil Sect here? Are you the Incense Master or someone else? Did you sneak into our manor to seal the Coiling Dragon Sword?!”

The Coiling Dragon Sword was the most important inherited treasure of the Prince Qian Manor. It was bestowed upon them by the previous king. Even though it wasn’t a grandmist artifact, it was still a high-grade chaos artifact!

“Coiling Dragon Sword?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head involuntarily and smiled.

After reading through the books in the library, he knew that the Coiling Dragon Sword in the manor was indeed a high-grade chaos artifact. However, Huang Xiaolong’s heart wouldn’t even tremble if a supreme spiritual artifact was placed before him, much less a mere chaos artifact!

In his eyes, chaos artifacts were no different from scrap metal.

Zhang Haochen felt rage bubbling in his heart when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s attitude. He raised the sword in his hand, and he prepared to charge at Huang Xiaolong.

Even though his strength was beneath Zhang Wenyue, he was still a mid-Tenth Order God King Realm expert.

“Little Prince, is there a need for you to take action personally? I will be more than enough to deal with these spies from the Black Devil Sect!” Master Yin yelled all of a sudden and stepped forward.

Only then did Zhang Haochen stop himself.

Master Yin and the other esteemed guest masters looked at the Qian Prince and awaited his instructions.

A nod of the head was all they were waiting for.

As soon as the Qian Prince instructed to attack, Master Yin and the rest surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

Just as they were about to attack, Zhang Wenyue made her appearance. “Stop!”

Everyone couldn’t help but stare at the princess.

“Father... Young Master Huang is my guest!” Zhang Wenyue arrived beside Prince Qian and said urgently.

Prince Qian frowned, “Yue’er, we have no idea who this person is. He pretended to be seriously injured in order to sneak into our manor, and he even crippled Housekeeper Wang! He is definitely someone from the Black Devil Sect! I have to deal with him in order to protect everyone in my manor!”

Of course, he had to take a step back now that his daughter was sticking up for the unknown man in the manor. His tone eased up and he reassured her, “Don’t worry, if this person is not from the Black Devil Sect, I will let him go after our investigations.”

Zhang Yue shook her head and stared at her father with unwavering eyes. “There’s no way Young Master Huang is from the Black Devil Sect! I believe him!”

Prince Qian’s face turned cold, and he snorted, “You’re unable to distinguish right from wrong. It looks like this kid has indeed bewitched you!” He turned to Master Yin and commanded, “Take him down!”

Everyone nodded and made their moves.

As panic took over Zhang Wenyue’s heart, she was prepared to stop Master Yin and the rest. However, Prince Qian blocked her way and as a prince of the Jinyuan Kingdom, he was a Heavenly Monarch Realm expert and he was more than enough to stop Zhang Wenyue.

Roar! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As several swords came piercing towards him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother dodging.

“Clang!”

A look of joy appeared on Zhang Haochen’s face when he heard the impact. In stark contrast, Zhang Wenyue’s face turned pale.

In the next instant, the smile was wiped from their faces when they saw that the swords in the hands of the esteemed guest masters had shattered into countless pieces. Master Yin and the others were sent flying backwards by the rebound and they crashed into the walls of the manor.

“This...” Prince Qian and everyone else sucked in a cold breath in disbelief.

Huang Xiaolong brushed the dust off his chest, and he slowly walked towards Prince Qian with a frosty expression on his face.

“Shoot!” Prince Qian screamed when he realized that things were going south.

The archers surrounding the courtyard released their bowstrings and arrows rained down on Huang Xiaolong.

With a slight flick of his wrist, the arrows that were about to land on him exploded into tiny pieces.

Huang Xiaolong arrived before Prince Qian and Zhang Haochen under the shocked gazes of everyone present.
