Sun Shihai’s roar resounded like a ear splitting thunderclap and it echoed through the entire Fortune Secret Region.

When Sun Shihai was vowing to destroy Huang Xiaolong, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship was speeding towards the Fortune Emperor Palace.

In the main hall of the Dragon Shark Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong received a message talisman from his master, Zhao Lei. The contents were obviously what was written in the Brightness summoning signal, about how he ordered Xiang Xun to rob their low-grade demonic spiritual veins.

Looking at the contents of the letter, Huang Xiaolong broke out into cold laughter. The little cow was right. Tian Ziyi and the others were planning to go all the way in their pursuit of the low-grade demonic spiritual veins.

He casually tossed the message to the little cow who was lazily lying on the ground. When she swept her divine sense across it, she laughed as though it didn’t matter. “How are you planning on dealing with this? There will be a lot of trouble waiting for you back at the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Huang Xiaoling replied indifferently, “I don’t think there will be any trouble waiting for me... However, Master said that Sun Shihai’s strength has improved by leaps and bounds after cultivating in the Fortune Secret Region. He is no longer the weakling he once was and there is a hundred percent chance of him passing the selections.”

The little cow frowned in suspicion. “What nonsense. At best, that little brat broke through to the late-Fifth Order God King Realm. Even though he has a Supreme Godhead and can cultivate quickly, there is still a limit as to how fast he can increase his strength. Unless...”

“Unless what?” Huang Xiaolong was puzzled.

“Unless someone unleashed a forbidden ancient chaos art on him. Otherwise, there is no way for him to break through so quickly.” The little cow muttered to herself.

In the past few years, Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain the Tianwu Treasure and he had used it to break into the God King Realm. With the help of the Blood Eye Devil Stele, he had broken through to the Fourth Order God King Realm. He only managed to break through to the Sixth Order God King Realm because he found the purple grandmist aura.

Moreover, he had a King of Supreme Godhead!

For Sun Shihai to be able to even come close to Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation base was suspicious in itself!

“Are the effects of the Demonic Chaos Forbidden Art so shocking?” Huang Xiaolong asked in shock.

The little cow nodded her head. “Despite the stellar effects of the forbidden art, they are essentially drinking poison to quench their thirst. If Sun Shihai has really been cultivating this forbidden art, he will experience unprecedented growth in the Heavenly Monarch Realm. Once he breaks through the Heavenly Monarch Realm, his cultivation speed will start to slow down. In fact, his cultivation speed will start to slowly stagnate, and he might never be able to break into the Emperor Realm in the future! The reason users of the forbidden art can experience rapid growth is due to the fact that it is constantly sucking up their latent potential and talent for cultivation. The more talented the person is, the stronger the effects of the forbidden art.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“However, the Demonic Chaos Forbidden Art is said to be lost in the long rivers of time. Even most of the Emperors in the demonic sects aren’t aware of the forbidden art. How did someone like Zhou Chen in your Fortune Emperor Palace get his hands on such a skill?” The little cow felt that something was off.

If Sun Shihai was cultivating the Demonic Chaos Forbidden Art, Zhou Chen was their only suspect.

After racking his brains, Huang Xiaolong said, “Maybe Zhou Chen managed to obtain some ancient demonic sect’s treasure trove during his adventures...”

It wasn’t impossible for something like that to happen.

“Probably not.” The little cow shot him down.

Huang Xiaolong stared at her with his mouth agape.

Why not?

“Alright. Let’s stop talking about Zhou Chen. Your little girlfriends should already be aware of your return. Wouldn’t they be pretty anxious, considering the situation?” The little cow suddenly broke out into laughter. “Hahaha, in my opinion, you are already thinking about them!”

Huang Xiaolong brushed off the question and asked one of his own. “Do you know what my master, the king of grandmist, looks like?”

The little cow was stunned for a second but a chuckle left her lips eventually. “He’s just an old man... Of course he isn’t as handsome as you. Of course, he doesn’t have your charm...”

Huang Xiaolong was struck speechless.

“Oh right, that little brat, Tianwu, has a pretty good collection of arrays in the Tianwu Array Records. Go study them when you’re free.”

“I will.” Huang Xiaolong replied and nodded his head.

He was extremely clear about the advantages and uses of arrays. It didn’t matter if one was studying the art of refining pills, creating mechanisms, or the art of combat. The use of arrays would be crucial in any one of those aspects. An Array Grandmaster was someone extremely revered in the Divine World.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was too preoccupied with increasing his cultivation base to secure a spot for himself in the selections that he couldn’t dedicate time to his research of arrays.

Since he no longer needed to increase his cultivation base as rapidly as before, he felt that he should find some time to do some proper research on arrays.

Time stopped for no one and before long, a year passed.

Throughout the entire year, other than refining dragon crystals, dragon pearls, and Fortune Divine Fruits, Huang Xiaolong spent the rest of his time studying the Tianwu Array Records.

The more he researched the Tianwu Array Records, the more respect he felt for Tianwu Heavenly King.

Before he ascended to the Divine World, he had once studied the art of arrays. He couldn’t be considered a complete newbie in it, but after studying the Tianwu Array Records, he felt that he had merely touched on a small corner of the art of arrays.

The Tianwu Array Records was profound and encompassed a broad scope of knowledge. The theories contained within were exquisite and it seemed to be written by someone with extensive knowledge in the art of arrays. The more Huang Xiaolong read, the more absorbed he became. There were even some parts where he clapped his hands in amazement.

According to the Tianwu Heavenly King, the art of arrays were broken up into four levels. The first level was to carve the general form of an array onto a divine tool. The user would have to use the divine tool before they could form the array successfully. As for the second level, one would be able to use anything they could get their hands on to form an array. Mastering the third level would allow one to use the godforce in their body to form an array! If using godforce to form an array sounded absurd, the fourth level would be absolutely ridiculous. Tianwu Heavenly King stated that at the fourth level, one would be able to set up an array with their thoughts!

Forming an array with a thought!

By covering an area with their mind, they would be able to form an array!

It was a ridiculous, yet horrifying idea!

Thoughts were something that couldn’t be felt. How could something non-physical be used to form an array?!

However, Huang Xiaolong managed to understand Tianwu Heavenly King’s logic after a bit of thinking.

It didn’t matter if they were using godforce or their thought to form an array, they had to use the energy contained in the heavens and earth. The only difference was the power of the array unleashed and the speed at which it was created. By using their thoughts to form an array, they would be able to catch their enemies off guard and they would even be able to use it to assassinate their opponent!

As for the four different levels, they were split up into three parts again. The early, middle, and late phase.

As for the Tianwu Heavenly King, he had reached the third stage where he could deploy an array with this godforce.

After making an initial estimate of his accomplishments in the art of arrays, Huang Xiaolong felt that he was in the early second stage.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong finally kept the Tianwu Array Records and he stepped into the main hall of the flying ship.

“Master!” Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel greeted in unison.

“We should be arriving at the Fortune Emperor Palace soon, right?”

“With our speed, we should be arriving at the Fortune Emperor Palace on the day after tomorrow.” Xiang Xun replied.

“The day after tomorrow...” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

The day after tomorrow, he will finally be able to see Li Lu and Yao Chi... Once he thought about seeing them again, a warm fuzzy feeling filled his heart. When he thought about seeing Yao Chi again, a fire ignited in his heart.

He wanted to know how they were doing.

In a flash, two days passed.

The instant they left the ship, they saw the magnificent palace floating in midair and the familiar divine planes surrounding it. With the little cow in tow, Huang Xiaolong flew towards the Fortune Emperor Palace.

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong asked Lei Budong and Feng Chen to enter the space in the Tianwu Treasure Trove before entering the palace.
