Chapter 2513: Do You Dare to Challenge Me

Upon seeing that everyone was about to leave, Cao Nan sneered when he caught sight of Huang Xiaolong. “Tyrant Chu, your disciple is really something else. A Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint not only managed to survive, but he also managed to enter the top ten!”

Tyrant Chu roared with laughter. “Many thanks for your compliments. I, too, think that my disciple is outstanding! Since he didn’t die, he will definitely be able to rise in the future! However, I can’t say the same for your disciples. What a pity for them to die in the Ghost Devil City.”

“Several True Saints died in the city… What a tragic end?!”

Tyrant Chu shook his head.

As he heard Tyrant Chu speak about his disciples once again, Cao Nan almost failed to contain his rage. A cold light flashed in his eyes, but he forcefully suppressed the killing intent inside him. Instead, he thought about Huang Xiaolong’s miserable end.

Light shone through the plaza as all the disciples were transported out.

“Li Chen!”

Someone yelled as they spotted Li Chen from the Holy Heavens.

In the end, Li Chen was ranked third on the leaderboard.

Of course, if Huang Xiaolong hadn’t wasted six days devouring the True Saints, Li Chen wouldn’t be sitting in third place.

Even though he was only third, everyone noticed him when he left the city.

However, his expression wasn’t too good. He had entered the trial hoping to get first place. However, he didn’t even manage to obtain second place when the trial ended. Tan Juan and Xie Bufan stole his glory!

His mood was especially bad when he realized that Xie Bufan had taken second place.

As more and more disciples started to leave the city, Tan Juan and Xie Bufan eventually emerged. When they did, the plaza broke out into cheers. It was especially so for Tan Juan, who was part of the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace. Countless suitors screamed and cheered crazily.

After the results in the Trial of Blood, Tan Juan’s image in the hearts of many increased yet again.

This time, the number of disciples who had died in the city wasn’t small. Only eighty percent of the participants remained.

Most of those who were eliminated didn’t die. Instead, they had activated the light ring to leave the city before the trial had ended.

Less than fifty thousand disciples had died in the city, and the survivors were teleported outside.

Huang Xiaolong, Lin Xiaoying, Chen Yi, and the others were among the last to leave the Ghost Devil City.

When Huang Xiaolong emerged, the plaza broke out into chaos. However, everyone was mocking and laughing at him. None of them were cheering like they did for Li Chen and the others.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong was out, Li Chen glared at him with a sunken expression and growled, “Junior Brother Huang, in order to win the bet, you found a way to cheat in the Trial of Blood. Do you know how badly you hurt our Holy Heavens’ reputation? How dare you show your face?!”

Huang Xiaolong stared at Li Chen and sneered, “What are you talking about? Don’t forget, you have to kneel at my Blue Dragon Manor for an entire day after returning. All of you owe me one holy artifact. Hahaha, I wonder who’s the embarrassment…?”

A snort left Li Chen’s lips. “You cheated your way through the trials, and you dare dream about obtaining holy artifacts from me. Wait till the Cangqiong Old Man disqualifies you later.”

“Are you so sure about that?” Huang Xiaolong didn’t seem the least bit affected.

Since they didn’t bother to hide their conversation, everyone in the plaza heard them.

Cao Nan turned to Tyrant Chu, and he sneered, “Tyrant Chu, your disciple really thinks that he managed to pass the trials all by himself. He even believes that he managed to obtain the fifth rank in the trials. Is he still daydreaming?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I wonder, if you have managed to gather all one hundred thousand high-grade holy spiritual jade stones yet?!” Cao Nan continued, “I understand if you can’t do so. After all, even my Devil Palace wouldn’t be able to gather so many.”

Tyrant Chu didn’t rage. Instead, a friendly smile appeared on his face. “I recall that Dou Rui and your other disciples made a bet with my disciple. Can you take out four holy pills? If a Primal Ancestor like you fails to bring out four holy pills, you will really embarrass yourself! However, if you can’t take it out, you can always give me the pants you’re wearing.”

“You!” A chilly light flashed through Cao Nan’s eyes. However, he turned to the Cangqiong Old Man, and he raised his request instead of quareling with Tyrant Chu. “Dao Friend Cangqiong, as a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint, Huang Xiaolong of the Holy Heavens actually made it through the trials. He even managed to obtain a spot in the top ten! He has to be cheating. I hope Dao Friend Cangqiong can disqualify him from the Trial of Blood. According to the rules, the Holy Heavens has to pay up one hundred thousand high-grade holy spiritual jade stones!”

Mo Cangli, Duan Xuan, and the other experts turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

When everyone waited for the Cangqiong Old Man to disqualify Huang Xiaolong, a smile formed on his face. “There’s no hurry.” He turned to Huang Xiaolong and asked, “Little friend, would you like to explain yourself?”

Little friend?!

Everyone felt their jaws dropping in fright when they heard how the Cangqiong Old Man referred to Huang Xiaolong.

In the Holy World, no one had ever seen the Cangqiong Old Man acting so ‘close’ to anyone!

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly to the old man before turning to Cao Nan. “What evidence do you have that I cheated?”

Cao Nan sneered. “Why do I need to prove it? Even Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints failed to qualify, but a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint like you entered the top ten ranks. Isn’t this enough proof? Even First Heaven True Saints failed to enter the top ten, but a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint like you ended up in fifth place.”

“Don’t tell me you’re stronger than a peak late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint! Are you stronger than a First Heaven True Saint?!”

Everyone started heckling and the various experts shook their heads slowly.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them, and he looked at Cao Nan. “You’re just an ignorant fool. Even if you don’t believe that a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint can be stronger than a First Heaven True Saint, it’s because you’re a frog in a well!”

Everyone’s expression turned complicated instantly.

Even Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi frowned when they heard what he said.

Cao Nan felt the rage rushing to his head, but he laughed eventually. “Are you stronger than the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints? Are you stronger than a First Heaven True Saint?” He pointed towards one of the First Heaven True Saint disciples from the Devil Palace. “If you defeat this disciple from my Devil Palace, I’ll believe that you’re stronger than a late-First Heaven True Saint!”

“How about that? Why don’t you accept the challenge?” Cao Nan sneered.

Huang Xiaolong merely glanced at the disciple before speaking. “He’s just a late-First Heaven True Saint. I’ll kill him with a flip of my hand.”
