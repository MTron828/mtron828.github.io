After he decided that he’ll accompany Shi Xiaofei to the Wintry North World, Huang Xiaolong efficiently utilized his time in refining the Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets. After spending the night doing so, he was able to produce another three batches.

Knowing that Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei were about to leave for the Wintry North World, Huang Peng and Su Yan were naturally reluctant to see them go. However, the elderly couple already knew that this son of theirs ‘couldn’t stay still’, hence they could only exhort them to be careful on the way.

Listening to his parents repeatedly telling them to be careful, Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly within. Based on his current strength, the number of people that could kill him now was less than the number of fingers on his two hands. However, he nodded filially at Huang Peng and Su Yan.

Under the Huang Family’s lingering gazes, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei sped off on their beast mounts.

Shortly after, the two of them left Martial Spirit World, arriving in the vast outer space.

Shi Xiaofei rode on a female phoenix, whereas Huang Xiaolong’s beast mount was an ancient fierce beast, a female Dark Hell Tiger. Both demonic beasts’ strength was at perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm.

On the way, noticing that the Dark Hell Tiger Huang Xiaolong was riding was actually a female, Shi Xiaofei pursed her lips and said, “Big brother Huang, you’re to change your mount next time.”

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded, then chuckled, it seems like Shi Xiaofei was jealous of this Dark Hell Tiger. He smiled at her, suggesting, “Then, I’ll ride on that phoenix with you.”

Before she could react, Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a flicker. Before she knew it, a warm, masculine body appeared behind her. Huang Xiaolong was sitting on her phoenix mount behind her.

The faint feminine fragrance from Shi Xiaofei’s body tickled Huang Xiaolong’s nostrils, it was akin to the scent of a blooming orchid.

Shi Xiaofei’s body tensed up.

Although he couldn’t see Shi Xiaofei’s expression, he could see her ears turning bright red.

Huang Xiaolong clearly heard Shi Xiaofei’s breathing slightly quickening and his hands extended forward, embracing her from behind.

A small gasp escaped from Shi Xiaofei’s small cherry lips, her body softened and leaned into Huang Xiaolong’s embrace. Her bashful face faced Huang Xiaolong, “Big brother Huang, you...”

Shi Xiaofei’s bashful expression was capable of making fishes dive to the bottom and birds soar. On an impulse, Huang Xiaolong bend his head down and two pairs of lips pressed together.

Shi Xiaofei’s eyes widened for a second, then she slowly lowered her eyelids.

Heavy breathing sounded in their ears, especially Shi Xiaofei. Despite the layers of clothes between them, Huang Xiaolong felt Shi Xiaofei’s rising body temperature.

His palms ever so slowly cruised over Shi Xiaofei’s curves, drawing soft moans from her.

Shi Xiaofei’s body felt extremely soft under Huang Xiaolong’s palms, a waist so slender and delicate that he could wrap around it with a single arm.

Barely a few seconds into their kiss, a wicked chuckle sounded from afar, “Hehe, even before we reached Martial Spirit World, we’ve already run into a pair of little lovebirds here!”

Shi Xiaofei and Huang Xiaolong separated, looking in the direction of the voice. They both saw several people flying toward them, seemingly coming from the Iron Radix World and going toward Martial Spirit World.

There were more than a dozen people clad in similar blue brocade robes with an emblem of a strange white flower on their chests.

When Shi Xiaofei turned around and this group of people saw her alluring face, their gazes instantly burned with lust.

“Who would have guessed that this chick is such a pre~tty little thing, befitting of the saying ‘beauty that brings calamity to a country and its people.’ Enforce Kong, let’s capture this woman and bring her back for Sect Chief, he’ll definitely be happy.” One of them clucked his tongue, admiring Shi Xiaofei.

“Capture this woman back for Sect Chief? Too troublesome.” Another person grinned, “Us brothers haven’t touched a woman for a long time, let’s enjoy ourselves later.”

“Enforcer Kong is right! I must say, I haven’t tried f*cking in space!”

“I also haven’t tried doing in on top of a beast mount!”

Obscene words sounded one after another from this group’s mouth.

Shi Xiaofei’s face flushed with anger, glaring at the group with fury. Just as she was about to make a move, Huang Xiaolong was one step ahead of her. His hand reached out and made a grasping motion, causing the group of people to halt abruptly as if an invisible giant hand was squeezing them.

The group was startled. They struggled intensely to free themselves, but to their dismay, they realized they couldn’t move an inch.

“You!” That middle-aged Enforcer Kong paled. Fear and astonishment filled his eyes looking at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, holding himself back from killing these people in one strike. Instead, the invisible giant hand’s grip slowly tightened, exerting more strength.

As his grip continued to tighten, those people’s faces distorted from the pressure and pain. Imagine one’s internal organs being squeezed all at once, how painful would that be?

Although Shi Xiaofei felt it was cruel watching this, she didn’t voice out any objection. She understood that, if not for them having higher strength than that group of people, their fates would have been terrible if they fell into these people’s hands.

“We’re Mythical Flower Sect’s Elders and Enforcers, you...!”

“We have eyes but cannot see, Senior, please spare us!”

A few of them began to plead for mercy, writhing in pain. However, Huang Xiaolong’s expression remained cold and detached.

In no time at all, the dozen people exploded into blood mist under the invisible giant hand.

Mythical Flower Sect? Huang Xiaolong’s eyes gleamed with chilling coldness. He was aware of this Mythical Flower Sect. It was one of the most powerful sects in the Iron Radix World, controlling sixth-tenths of the Iron Radix World’s forces. Within the Black Tortoise Galaxy, this Mythical Flower Sect was considered one of the first-rank forces, ten times more powerful than the Peace Emperor World’s Zhao Family.

Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei traveled on after killing this group of people, going to the Iron Radix World. Their initial plan was to use that world’s transmission array, but after what happened earlier, Huang Xiaolong decided to delay for a few hours in the Iron Radix World.

A few hours later, the Mythical Flower Sect discovered that their Sect Chief, both Deputy Chiefs, more than ten Enforcers and Elders were killed in the great hall. Everyone was startled, their expressions filled with disbelief and horror. However, no blood marks were found on any of their bodies, neither were their internal organs injured.

Most baffling of all, there was no sign of a battle in the great hall.

Soon, news spread that the Mythical Flower Sect’s Chief, Deputy Chiefs, Enforcers, Elders, and a large number of their core disciples had been found dead, shocking the entire Iron Radix World.

All the forces under the Mythical Flower Sect started fighting amongst themselves even as they remained clueless and shocked. From top to bottom, the Mythical Flower Sect was in disarray.

By this time, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei had long left the Iron Radix World. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After leaving that world, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei took their own sweet time, both of them riding on Shi Xiaofei’s phoenix mount while the Dark Hell Tiger followed behind them. Naturally, a few racing heartbeats and heavy breathing quickly sounded. To avoid the same troublesome thing with the Mythical Flower Sect from happening again, Huang Xiaolong had the Dark Hell Tiger release its aura.

Hence, they no longer came across any disturbances in their journey.

With a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm demonic beast following them, no one would come looking for death.

Eight days later, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei finally arrived at the Wintry North World.

The two of them rode on the phoenix, flying in the drifting white snow toward Yang Yi’s place.

Watching the snow gently falling, Shi Xiaofei had a dazed expression on her face. The days she spent here flashed before her eyes as if it was yesterday, wondering if her Master was doing well.
