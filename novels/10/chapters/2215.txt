Chapter 2216: Worthless Scraps

The guard who had thrown the holy bill at Huang Xiaolong, shook his head in ridicule as he laughed hysterically. This was the first time he had met someone stupid enough to say something like that.

Qin Yuan and Weng Siqi looked at each other and sneered.

To them, Huang Xiaolong was playing a prank on them.

However, it was indeed pretty hilarious.

“I don’t care if you’re really crazy or just acting foolish. You have to be mentally handicapped to make a scene in my territory!” Qin Shaolong chuckled. In the next moment, he introduced Weng Siqi proudly, “Meet my master from the Big Dipper Sword Sect, Custodian Weng Siqi!”

It was indeed a glorious and honorable achievement to become a disciple of a custodian in the Big Dipper Sword Sect.

“Master? Big Dipper Sword Sect?” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the least bit affected. Instead, he added fuel to the fire, “From what I know, isn’t the Big Dipper Sword Sect recruiting disciples only after six months? Oh, are you going to rely on your connections to enter the sect in advance?”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s sarcastic tone, Qin Shaolong was infuriated as his face turned red.

The guard snickered coldly, “Brat, what do you know? Our young master’s talent is unparalleled in the kingdom, and it’s only a matter of time before he enters the Big Dipper Sword Sect.”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Qin Shaolong and continued, “Divine Earth Physique, Rock Dragon Divine Veins, Flame Emperor Godhead. Do you really consider yourself to be an unparalleled genius with such garbage talent?”

In reality, either one of those was enough to squeeze Qin Shaolong into the top one hundred geniuses in the younger generation of the Falling Jade Dynasty. However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t wrong when he called it garbage talent. After all, everything was close to trash when compared to Huang Xiaolong’s three complete dao saint godheads, three saint bloodlines, and saint physique.

“You’re looking for death!” Qin Shaolong felt rage bubbling in his heart when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s insult.

“Wait!” Just when Qin Shaolong was about to attack, Qin Yuan stopped him.

“Father, this brat...I!” He was so angry that no words could describe his feelings at that instant.

Qin Yuan quickly dismissed his son, “Alright, I know what to do.” He then turned to Huang Xiaolong and asked, “May I know who this Young Master is?”

It should be obvious that no ordinary person knew Qin Shaolong’s natural gifts. Now that Huang Xiaolong had mentioned all of them with a single glance, Qin Yuan knew that the other party wasn’t someone he could simply mess with.

“My identity isn’t important.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I’ve changed my mind. Not only do I want your treasury, I’ll take all the spatial artifacts on you!”

“What?!” Qian Shaolong hollered.

Even Qin Yuan and Weng Siqi couldn’t help but feel a sense of rage building up in their hearts.

“President, who cares about his background? I’ll break his limbs right this instant and we can interrogate him after!” Qin Yuan’s personal guard bellowed.

Qin Yuan nodded and agreed coldly, “That works too!”

Even if the other party came from a strong faction, could it be stronger than the Big Dipper Sword Sect? With Weng Siqi around, Qin Yuan wasn’t afraid of anything!

After getting Qin Yuan’s approval, the personal guard approached Huang Xiaolong and glared at him. He wanted to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson since the moment he had walked in.

“Brat, I’m going to split open your brain now and see if you’re really stupid or just acting crazy!” The personal guard laughed callously as he raised his long sword. A red sword light enveloped his blade and he swung it down at Huang Xiaolong’s head.

When facing an attack of this calibre, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother dodging. He merely raised his palm. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The impressive sword light that was slashing down towards Huang Xiaolong dissipated in an instant.

Despite the guard’s shock, he managed to react in time and he raised his sword to slash at Huang Xiaolong again. However, he was smashed deep into the ground before he could see the other party’s move.

The hall rumbled as cracks started to form in the ground.

As the guard was smashed deep into the ground, his organs exploded and he turned into a pool of blood. His long sword was turned into shards of scrap metal as it flew around the hall.

Qin Yuan and Weng Siqi leaped to their feet as their expressions changed.

Even Qin Shaolong couldn’t believe his eyes as he stared at the hole in the ground.

Qin Yuan’s personal guard was a First Order Emperor, and he was one of the relatively stronger individuals present in the Radiance Chamber of Commerce. However, he was killed by Huang Xiaolong with a single blow!

Struck with disbelief, Qin Shaolong felt his back drenched in a cold sweat. He was glad he wasn’t the one who had attacked. Otherwise, he would be that pool of blood in the ground!

“Who... Who are you?!” Qin Yuan shrieked as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. One had to be in the Fourth Order Emperor Realm to be able to kill his personal guard with a single strike.

“Someone who’s going to kill you!” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Qin Yuan’s face sank and his eyes flickered as he looked towards Weng Siqi.

Weng Siqi finally took a step forward and the long sword on his back started to vibrate. It gleamed with a cold light and he growled, “Very bold of you to say that. I’ll discipline you in place of your elders and give you a taste of your own medicine!”

The long sword on his back flew out of its sheath before anyone could react.

“Seven Sword Art!”

The long sword shook and transformed into seven swords. Each of them emanated the brilliance of sun, moon, fire, water, wood, metal, and earth, respectively. Rays of blinding light filled the room.

Qin Yuan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Weng Siqi was making a move. After all, a Seventh Order Emperor like Weng Siqi would be able to suppress the other party easily!

Huang Xiaolong reached out and grabbed all seven swords in the air. Without exerting much strength at all, he closed his palm and ground the swords into dust.

When he opened his palm, metal dust filled the air.

“What?!” Weng Siqi and Qin Yuan were appalled as the blood drained from their faces. Qin Shaolong trembled in fear as he watched the scene before him.

Weng Siqi had spent a long time collecting the materials, and more than a million years to craft the seven swords. They were his most treasured possessions and they were mid-grade grandmist artifacts. Moreover, he hadn’t stopped the refinement of his swords. After endless years of hard work, the seven swords he possessed were stronger than most of the mid-grade grandmist artifacts out there! Despite that, they were crushed by Huang Xiaolong in an instant!

What kind of concept was it to reduce a mid-grade grandmist artifact into dust?! None of them thought that it was even possible for anyone to do that.

“Worthless scraps!” Huang Xiaolong stared nonchalantly at the pile of iron powder lying on the ground.

Worthless scraps!

Weng Siqi and Qin Yuan felt their world spinning when they heard what he said.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards Qin Yuan.

“You... what do you want from me? I can give you half of the treasury!” Qin Yuan retreated in horror and blurted out in fear.

“Eighty percent!”

“Everything!”

“I’ll even give you everything in my spatial artifact!” Qin Yuan added hastily.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed, and Qin Yuan flew out as he saw Huang Xiaolong’s fist striking his chest.

“Aren’t you the one who sent the incense masters from the Black Devil Sect? ” Huang Xiaolong asked indifferently.

Blood spewed from his wounds and Qin Yuan finally realized who he was dealing with.

Initially, he had his doubts as no one this strong would bother messing with his small chamber of commerce. However, the gaps were filled in when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

...

Ten minutes later, Huang Xiaolong strolled out of the headquarters of the Radiance Chamber of Commerce.

Before long, the bodies of Qin Yuan, Qin Shaolong, and Weng Siqi were discovered by the guards.
