Chapter 2041: Whereabouts of the Ancient Heavenly Court

After a few minutes, Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness saw a giant body of water in front of them.

The sea that lay before them had water that was inky blue. It was dark to the point of despair, but the blue allowed one to catch a glimpse of hope.

There was actually a sea like that located in the Desolate Desert!

Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness gasped in shock. Looking at the boundless sea before their eyes, both of them failed to sense the depth of it. The sea seemed calm, in total contrast to the chaotic winds blowing across the desert.

“There’s something weird about this sea.” The King of Darkness recalled as black light gathered in his eyes. They turned into two dark dragons that shot towards the calm waters.

As soon as they entered the region above the sea, tyrannical lightning started gathering in the skies above, and lightning bolts slammed down one after another until the dark dragons were destroyed.

Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness watched this in shock.

“That’s a terrifying restriction!” The expression on the King of Darkness’s face became solemn.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. It was pure luck that he didn’t go charging headfirst into the region in front of them. If he did, he was afraid he would end up with a sorry outcome even if he had the King of Darkness’s protection.

The strength of the restriction in the skies was no weaker than a Sovereign Realm expert.

It seemed as though the Ancient Heavenly Court was hidden in the sea beneath them.

Was it possible that the Ancient Heavenly Court was hidden at the bottom of the sea? The reason why the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell was unable to detect its presence was probably because it was blocked by the restrictions in the sea!

“What now?” The King of Darkness asked.

“We wait.” Huang Xiaolong thought about it.” We shall wait until we detect it again. Once we confirm that it’s in there, we can think of another plan.”

The King of Darkness nodded. It seemed like there was no other way.

If the Ancient Heavenly Court was really located at the bottom of the sea, would they be able to break the restrictions surrounding it? Even if the King of Darkness joined hands with the little cow, it would be extremely difficult for them to do so.

If there were only several restrictions, it would be a problem. What if there were several thousand restrictions?!

A whole hour later, the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell lit up again, and Huang Xiaolong felt the energy from the Ancient Heavenly Court coming from under the sea.

“Let’s go around it.” Huang Xiaolong muttered as he stared at the inky black sea before his eyes.

The King of Darkness nodded his head as he realized what Huang Xiaolong was thinking.

The two of them stayed at the very edge of the sea as they flew around it. They tested the strength of the restriction at every point. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Despite their attempts, they failed to look for a weakness in the restriction.

The sea was extremely large, and when they finally circled around it, a day had passed.

“Did something happen to the little cow?” Huang Xiaolong stared in the direction they had come from, and he couldn’t help but ask.

It had already been a day, but she had failed to contact Huang Xiaolong. No matter how he tried to contact her, there was no response.

Just as the words left his lips, a figure appeared on the horizon as it slowly flew towards him. It was precisely the little cow.

She looked extremely haggard.

“D*mn it. I’m so tired.” The little cow heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the two of them.

“What about that beast?” The King of Darkness had his suspicions.

“You can relax when this old cow deals with the problem personally.” The little cow declared triumphantly. “I sent it back into the ground. Anyway, what’s going on now? Is the Ancient Heavenly Court under the sea?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and confirmed her guess. “That’s right.”

“There’s a small problem.” The King of Darkness interrupted him and said, “The restrictions are something I’ve never seen before. Try it for yourself.”

The little cow reached her leg out into the sea, but lightning fell instantly, giving her a large fright.

“Does this happen everywhere around the sea?” The little cow asked.

“We’ve already made a round around it.” Huang Xiaolong explained, “There is no other way. We can only break this restriction one layer at a time. Otherwise, it’s going to be impossible for us to enter.”

The little cow stared at the King of Darkness.

He nodded in response. “Xiaolong is right. There is no other way. Even if we join hands, we will need four to five years to break the restriction.”

Four to five years!

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he sighed, “Since that is the case, we shall not waste any more time. I’ll stand guard while you deal with it.”

They knew that time was of the essence, and they tore through the air to slam into the restrictions above the sea. Countless bolts of lightning landed on their bodies as they started breaking the restriction.

Huang Xiaolong retreated into the distance and summoned the Imperial Beast Devil Stele. Countless divine beasts appeared and created a defensive perimeter. At the same time, the Lotus of Darkness appeared.

He summoned the City of Eternity as well, thoroughly defending the surroundings.

With the constant refinement, the City of Eternity had returned to its peak state. The moment he summoned it, all evil creatures started to back away.

Day after day passed.

Even though the restrictions were strong, they slowly crumbled under the combined might of the little cow and the King of Darkness. Despite their speed, the consumption of energy was terrifying.

Every day, Huang Xiaolong would toss out two bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills for the two of them to recover their energy. Only peak grade pills like that would allow them to quickly restore themselves to their peak state. If Huang Xiaolong took out any other ordinary high-grade grandmist spirit pills, its effectiveness wouldn’t be enough.

Of course, there was only one person in the world who could take out two bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills a day. Huang Xiaolong was a rich and imposing young master, alright!

No matter what the price was, Huang Xiaolong was willing to use them to exchange for the Ancient Heavenly Court. As long as he could obtain the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t blink if he needed to take out ten bottles a day!

There was no need to mention that there would also be divine pills stored in the Ancient Heavenly Court. They wouldn’t lose out to the Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills in the slightest.

A year soon passed.

Even though Huang Xiaolong suffered attacks of devil beasts from time to time, they were all in the First Order Sovereign Realm. With the Radiance Divine Scepter and the City of Eternity, Huang Xiaolong sent them all packing.

Under Huang Xiaolong’s protection, the little cow and King of Darkness shattered almost half the restrictions in the sea.
