As the Godly Mt. Xumi pressed closer and closer to Huang Xiaolong, terrifying waves of energy fluctuated in the air. Huang Xiaolong, who had turned into a massive dragon, could feel the weight of a thousand suns pressing down on him as the scales on his body cracked one after the other. Fresh blood dyed his body red.

Everyone present could feel the oppressive might of the Godly Mt. Xumi. However, another bony arm appeared from the void above Huang Xiaolong. When both arms pushed against the Godly Mt. Xumi, it finally stopped the massive structure.

The layers of golden light around the Godly Mt. Xumi exploded one after another in an attempt to push the bony arms away.

“Humph!”

A cold snort echoed through the minds of everyone present. The two bony arms disappeared, but an old man appeared in their place. The old man was extremely skinny, and he looked like he would be blown away by a gust of wind. In front of the Godly Mt. Xumi, he was no larger than a speck of dust.

Despite his tiny appearance, he stretched out both his arms to stop the mountain’s advance. Flipping his palm, the wooden cane that had beaten Lun Zhuan black and blue appeared in his hand.

The old man held onto his cane, and it emitted resplendent rays of light. Just the light alone blinded countless experts present.

Boom!

The cane shot out once again and slammed against the majestic golden mountain.

The heavens and earth shook as an ear-splitting blast resounded through space.

No matter who it was and where they were, they felt their bodies shaking uncontrollably when the explosion happened.

As soon as the cane smashed against the Godly Mt. Xumi, the previously unstoppable golden mountain was sent flying.

The golden light around the mountain scattered, and it eventually dimmed.

“Reverence Moon Old Man!” Dun Ei stared at the old man, who just appeared, and he screamed in fright. A look of fear appeared in his eyes.

The Reverence Moon Old Man’s prestige had long since engraved itself in the hearts of everyone in the various worlds. His strength placed him in the top three individuals under the heavens. In fact, it was possible he was the second-ranked expert among all the Sovereign Realm experts! To everyone in the Radiance World, the Reverence Moon Old Man was a supreme expert! Even the ‘leader of the Radiance World,’ Dun Ei, had to pay his respects when he saw the Reverence Moon Old Man!

The old man ignored everyone, and he glared at the Godly Mt. Xumi coldly. His gaze pierced through the restrictions around the mountain and landed on the Buddhist Ancestor in the heart of the mountain. “Shi Zhen, you refused to peek your head out of your Buddha World when I wanted to seek revenge in the past. You hid for a hundred million years. Who would have thought that you would show up to the Radiance World? Do you really think that I won’t be able to do anything to you if you hide in your Godly Mt. Xumi?”

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they heard what the Reverence Moon Old Man said.

The Buddhist Ancestor had gone into hiding for a hundred million years in order to escape from the Reverence Moon Old Man! That’s juicy news!

A voice slowly emerged from inside the Godly Mt. Xumi. “Reverence Moon Old Man, do you really think that you’re the strongest expert under the heavens? Stop bragging. Who says that our Buddhist Ancestor was afraid of you? He disdained dealing with you in order to avoid causing a war between the worlds!”

The person who spoke was Nan Ran and not the Buddhist Ancestor himself.

As the strongest Ancient Buddha in the Buddhist World, Nan Ran’s seniority was comparable to the Reverence Moon Old Man even if his strength wasn’t comparable to the Buddhist Ancestor. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Reverence Moon Old Man broke into laughter. “Nan Ran, all you can rely on is your Godly Mt. Xumi. Without it, I’ll beat all the teeth out of your mouth with a single slap!”

“Reverence Moon Old Man, actions speak louder than words!” Ancient Buddha Wu Liang’s voice came from inside the mountain. “Let our fists do the talking. Right now, we have mobilized the troops of the Buddha World to deal with you. Even if you support Huang Xiaolong, he will never be able to unify the Radiance World!”

As soon as he spoke, the Godly Mt. Xumi charged towards the Reverence Moon Old Man.

With a swing of his cane, the Reverence Moon Old Man forced the Godly Mt. Xumi back once again. However, it returned again and again.

Everyone couldn’t help but gasp at the Reverence Moon Old Man’s combat ability. At the same time, they realized the strength of the Godly Mt. Xumi. One had to know that the Godly Mt. Xumi was controlled by the Buddhist Ancestor and all the experts under him. However, it was forced back by the Reverence Moon Old Man time after time. One could easily imagine the Reverence Moon Old Man’s strength.

It was too bad no matter how the Reverence Moon Old Man smashed at the mountain with his cane, he couldn’t break through its defense.

Huang Xiaolong had already retreated far away from the Godly Mt. Xumi. The sixteen wings behind him unfurled, and his wounds healed at a shocking speed.

If any ordinary emperor were to face the Godly Mt. Xumi’s attack, their souls would have long since scattered. However, Huang Xiaolong had only suffered some superficial injuries.

Before his wounds could heal completely, a terrifying killing intent erupted and charged towards him. Lun Zhuan had finally escaped from his miserable fate as he charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, now that the Reverence Moon Old Man isn’t here to protect you from me, let’s see how you escape!” Lun Zhuan roared with laughter.

“Old Monster Lun Zhuan, you’re too cocky!” The King of Grandmist turned around and sent his grandmist qi flying towards Lun Zhuan.

“Grandmist, I’m your opponent!” Shi Ming slashed out with his Blade of Death and stopped the old man from protecting Huang Xiaolong.

Cang Mutian roared as he sent his fists towards Lun Zhuan.

“Cang Mutian, what do you think you’re doing?! Fight me!” The King of Shadows roared with laughter, and he blocked Cang Mutian’s way with his bone spike.

Cang Mutian had no choice but to block the King of Shadows’ sudden attack.

With no one to stop him, Lun Zhuan appeared in the space above Huang Xiaolong. He shot downwards towards his target. Previously, Huang Xiaolong had used everything he could and failed to block Shi Ming’s attack. With Lun Zhuan’s strength surpassing Shi Ming by more than a single-fold, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t escape from his gruesome fate of being sliced in half.

Lun Zhuan’s giant wheel slashed towards Huang Xiaolong. With the corrosive qi it was emitting, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to heal himself in a short amount of time if the wheel hit him.

The faces of the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others changed.

A look of joy flashed through Dun Ei’s eyes.

However, a loud moo resounded through the air, and it was like a bolt of divine lightning smashing into the minds of everyone present.

Everyone stared at the source of the voice in shock.

This... Where is the mooing coming from?!”

Wait a minute, is there a cow strong enough to affect all of us?!

When everyone was racking their brains to think of the face behind the voice, a massive azure cow appeared above Huang Xiaolong. The cow’s body was massive, and it was comparable to the size of the Godly Mt. Xumi! Two golden horns poked out from the azure cow’s head, and it emitted dazzling golden light.

When the King of Grandmist saw the figure, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. She’s finally here!

The azure cow released a loud moo as it slammed its mountain-like hoofs towards Lun Zhuan’s wheel.
