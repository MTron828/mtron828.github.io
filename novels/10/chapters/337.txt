Chapter 338: Begin, Refining the Ghost King Ring

“Let’s go back to the manor.” Huang Xiaolong said to the present people.

Thus, his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, as well as the others, walked back inside. Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu followed behind, whereas Feng Yang trailed close to Huang Xiaolong.

It was only at this moment that Huang Peng, Su Yan, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu became aware of Feng Yang’s presence among them.

When everyone was seated in the grand hall, Su Yan was the first to ask, “Long’er, this is?” looking at the giant ‘man’ standing behind Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Yang’s four-meter-tall stature roused their curiosity.

Huang Xiaolong smiled at them, explaining simply: “This is a ghost I took in from the Bedlam Lands.”

“Ghost!” Everyone was aghast hearing that.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, emphasizing: “A Saint realm ghost.”

“Saint realm ghost!!” Another wave of shock.

Huang Xiaolong taking in a ghost entity was shocking enough for them, it would never have crossed their mind that this ghost could be a Saint realm cultivator!

What a Saint realm expert represent, everyone present was well aware. In the current Duaren Empire, how many Saint realm experts were there, they could be counted on one hand.

Huang Xiaolong went on to add: “He’s called Feng Yang.” Then he turned to Feng Yang, “Feng Yang, greet House Master and Mistress.” Introducing Huang Peng and Su Yan both to him.

Entirely covered in a large black cloak, Feng Yang nodded in understanding, then he stepped forward to give Huang Peng and Su Yan a proper salute. Panicking slightly, not knowing what to do, Huang Peng and Su Yan quickly told him to rise.

Although in recent years both Huang Peng and Su Yan had seen quite a few large occasions, this was still the first time either of them received a salute from a Saint realm ghost.

Getting up, Feng Yang once again returned, standing in the same spot behind Huang Xiaolong in a respectful manner. Everyone was amazed watching this, wondering how Huang Xiaolong had managed to take in a Saint realm ghost as a slave.

“Long’er, have you been well these two years in the Bedlam Lands?” A while later, Su Yan asked.

Huang Xiaolong did not conceal the events in the Bedlam Lands, roughly describing the situation of the two years he spent there. Hearing how Huang Xiaolong managed to take control of the Sky Magi Sect, Blood Swallow School, and finally, Black Demon City, Huang Peng and Su Yan’s hearts tensed up, yet they were happy for their son at the same time.

Then, it came to the part in the City of Myriad Gods, where he had a conflict with Zhao Chen, where Zhao Chen’s subordinates tried to attack Huang Xiaolong. Everyone listening had their hearts hanging in the air. At the mention of how He Yunxiong, one of the top ten Bedlam Lands’ experts helped him solve the immediate crisis, everyone sighed in relief, happy that Huang Xiaolong managed to avoid unnecessary problems.

Another burst of joy spread over the small group at Huang Xiaolong’s adventures down the Broken Tiger Rift, listening to how he refined the spiritual energy fish, swallowing the nameless fire fruit, and divine grade spirit pellets, greatly enhancing his strength.

However, when it came to the Ghost City and Ghost King Palace, Huang Xiaolong glazed over the details, without recounting the matter of his second battle with Zhao Chen. Merely saying that he entered the Ghost King cultivation cave and managed to find the Ghost King’s Ring. Everyone in the hall were people that Huang Xiaolong trusted, thus he did not conceal the fact that he got the Ghost King Ring from them, and wasn’t worried that the matter would leak out.

After recounting his experience in the Bedlam Lands, Huang Xiaolong asked his parents about their lives, the Southern Hill Estate’s current situation, and also about his younger sister, Huang Min’s well-being.

Huang Xiaolong breathed in relief knowing that nothing much happened to the Southern Hill Estate for the past two years. His sister Huang Min was doing well after marrying over to the Guo Family, and would frequently come back to visit them. His parents also told him that his sister Huang Min gave birth to a chubby baby boy, which already knew how to walk.

Huang Xiaolong was very happy for his sister.

Then Huang Xiaolong took out the rare elixirs he found at the bottom of Broken Tiger Rift, dividing them between his parents, younger brother, even Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, Yu Ming, Haotian, and Fei Hou.

Though his parent’s talent was limited, the chances of them stepping into Xiantian realm being slim, these elixirs could change a person’s flesh and body. At the very least, for the time being, his parents could live up to a hundred, maybe even surpassing a century.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong believed that within a hundred year’s time he could break through to God Realm. As long as his parents were still alive at that time, he would have a way to let his parents breakthrough to Xiantian realm.

Soon, everyone dispersed from the grand hall and Huang Xiaolong returned to his own yard. There, he called for Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu to assist him in refining the Ghost King Ring. When both of them arrived, Huang Xiaolong brought them into the Godly Mt. Xumi’s space and took out the Ghost King Ring.

Looking at the translucent ring, emitting a soft purplish glow, both Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu had a dignified expression on their faces. With their high-level Saint realm strength, both could tell with a glance that the ban on this Ghost King Ring was not simple.

“Let’s begin.” Huang Xiaolong said while running the battle qi in his Qi Sea, at the same time, directing the true essence fire inside his dantian.

Seeing this, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu both pushed their battle qi with every effort, each placed a palm against Huang Xiaolong’s back, transferring the battle qi from their bodies into Huang Xiaolong. Instantly, Huang Xiaolong’s brocade robe fluttered, rising at the hems as he crazily channeled battle qi and true essence fire into the Ghost King Ring.

The Ghost King Ring shook and a purple light beam shot skyward, at the same time, the cries and howls of thousands of evils spirits sounded in the trio’s ears, echoing throughout the entire temple hall.

If they weren’t inside the Godly Mt. Xumi at this time, perhaps they would be alarming all the experts in the vicinity of the Duanren Imperial City.

Following the deafening cries of thousands of evil spirits, a surging powerful energy seemed to be breaking out from within the Ghost King Ring. Sensing this, Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s expressions became heavy, fully focusing on transferring battle qi into Huang Xiaolong’s body, not daring to risk the slightest negligence.

Huang Xiaolong too wore a grim face, borrowing Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu’s battle qi to suppress the unknown power from breaking out.

However, as time passed, this scary powerful energy became stronger and more violent, showing signs of overpowering the three people’s combined suppression, so much that Huang Xiaolong was forced to summon the twin dragon martial spirits and soul transforming.

Behind him Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu followed, summoning their martial spirits and soul transformed.

Their battle qi was enhanced after the soul transformation, successfully containing the potential outbreak. Seconds later, humming noises came from the Ghost King Ring.

Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic hearing it, it meant the first ban placed on the ring was broken!

Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu also had joyous expressions on their faces.

Riding on the first success, the three of them soldiered on, breaking the second, third, and the fourth ban on the ring. But, the further down they went, the harder it was to break the next ban. By the time they successfully broke the sixth ban, three long hours had passed. Huang Xiaolong noticed that the two evil dragons carving on the Ghost King Ring had turned bright red as if it was dipped in blood. Not only that, their eyes were glowing red, giving an extremely eerie feeling.

Ten hours passed. When Huang Xiaolong broke the tenth ban, the two evil dragons on the Ghost King Ring transformed into ethereal entities, flying away from the ring. Before Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu understood what was happening, the two evil dragons disappeared between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows, entering his body.

Huang Xiaolong stiffened, his eyes turned glowing red like the evil dragons’ in an instant. An overwhelming power took over Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness in the blink of an eye while destroying every part of his meridians.

Pain, so painful!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t endure any more, his head threw back roaring in pain.

“Sovereign!!” Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu were aghast at the sudden turn of event. Just as they came close to Huang Xiaolong, the terrifying energy possessing Huang Xiaolong’s body released a bout of energy, sending them flying back, spurting blood from their mouths.
