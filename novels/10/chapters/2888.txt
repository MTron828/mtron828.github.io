Chapter 2889: Kneel and Apologize!

When Huang Xiaolong shattered his sword intent, the sword qi that ravaged his body from the backlash wasn’t fully dispelled. He was desperately suppressing it with his cosmos energy, and now that Huang Xiaolong had initiated a full counterattack, if he was struck, would he….

In a fit of panic, Yong Luosheng pushed himself past his limit as he staked everything on his final strike.

With everything he had, he slapped outwards!

It was too bad he was too damn weak compared to Huang Xiaolong.

As the wall of cosmos energy formed by Huang Xiaolong pressed closer, the barrier he tried to put up shattered to pieces.

“No… No… No!”

He screamed in terror as unprecedented fear overwhelmed him. Everyone could hear the desperation in his voice.

No matter how hard he tried to escape, there was no way out.

Everyone watched on in shock as Yong Luosheng, the leader of the ten swords, the brightest star of the Ten Swords Creed, the genius with nine high-order Saint Fates, dual dao souls, and two peak bloodlines, was frightened to the point of running away with his tail tucked between his legs from a Primal Ancestor.

As he turned his body, the shattered remains of the sword qi dragon caught up to him.

Boom!

With a miserable shriek, Yong Luosheng shot off into the stars.

Everyone felt an earthquake running through their hearts as his screams entered their ears.

“This… This… Is he flying out of Monarch Yu Sacred Land again?” one of the late-First Esteem Dao Venerable muttered.

“He might even be sent further away this time…”

“He’s probably blasted out of the entire region!”

Making a short pulling motion in the skies, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Yong Luosheng as everyone was speculating how far away he had flown. As he dragged Yong Lousheng’se body like a broken doll towards him, everyone saw how the armor and battle robes on Yong Luosheng’s body were torn to shreds. Scars lined his body, and it was a gruesome sight to say the least.

No one could hold back their shock.

That was a Dao Venerable’s grand dao physique they were talking about! It was said to possess the strongest defence after being tempered by one’s cosmos energy, but Huang Xiaolong had managed to beat Yong Luosheng up with a single action!

One could only wonder how strong Huang Xiaolong’s last strike was!

“You… Who are you?!” Yong Luosheng’s voice trembled, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong like he was looking at a monster. He had never been so afraid of anyone, and not even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables could cause him so much fear.

“Huang Xiaolong.”

Huang Xiaolong!

At that instant, everyone present carved his name into their minds.

As long as they lived, they would never forget the legends of Huang Xiaolong, who defeated a Dao Venerable at the Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

“How… How can you…” Before he could continue, Huang Xiaolong pointed at several points around his body and sealed off his energy. By casually swinging his hand, he tossed Yong Luosheng into the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

Everyone turned to stare at him and the looks on their faces turned extremely colorful.

There were those who looked at him with an envious gaze, and there were some who were extremely suspicious.

As for the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World, they didn’t know what to feel when they looked at the youngster before them.

They wanted to speak, but didn’t know how to start. In the end, they could only swallow their words for the time being.

“Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong is really a freak! He can wield cosmos energy as a Primal Ancestor, and this is something extremely suspicious! We should return to make a report to the patriarch immediately!” The Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable beside Xuanyuan Potian advised.

Xuanyuan Potian suppressed the waves in his heart and asked a simple question, “Is it possible for him to be a Dao Venerable hiding his cultivation realm?”

The mid-level Dao Venerable shook his head and sighed, “There is no way of doing that. He is most definitely a Primal Ancestor. I checked several times with the Xuanyuan Divine Eye. There is no mistake.”

The Xuanyuan Divine Eye was a pinnacle grand dao art from the Xuanyuan Creed. They could see through all darkness and lies as long as they trained in the secret technique.

“But… what about the blue lotus nectar and Qilin Chariot?” Xuanyuan Potian couldn’t bear to leave without the treasures.

The only reason he had come was because of the blue lotus nectar! Now, they were telling him to return empty-handed!

“Your Highness, we have no way of holding him down…” The mid-level Dao Venerable sighed.

A look of shock found its way onto Xuanyuan Potian’s face. “What?! Even you can’t take him down?”

Nodding slowly, a look of embarrassment appeared on his face.

“Fine!” Xuanyuan Potian nodded reluctantly. “We’re leaving!”

When he conversed with the mid-level Dao Venerable, they spoke through voice transmissions. He only spoke out loud when ordering the retreat. Yang Jia and the others turn to stare at him in shock the moment the order to leave left his lips.

The three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World couldn’t understand his sudden change in the decision and stared at him blankly.

Just as they were about to turn to leave, a chilly voice rang through the air. “Did I allow you to leave?”

Huang Xiaolong! He did it again!

Everyone stared at him in shock. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When his words reached Xuanyuan Potian’s ears, he turned around in an instant as lightning flashed through his eyes, “Little f*cker! Who do you think you are? Do you think you can stop me from leaving?”

A chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes in return. “Weren’t you barking about killing me off previously? Are you scared now? Why are you being such a wimp? Did your balls go soft or did you lose your manhood?”

“Lightning Tiger? You should probably change your name after today. Why don’t I give you a name? Since you’re such a wuss, just change your title to Soft Balls instead.”

Everyone stared at Xuanyuan Potian with their mouths agape.

Soft Balls?

Their expressions instantly lit up, but none of them dared to laugh.

Of course, as the person in question, Xuanyuan Potian raised his head to the skies, and a massive Lightning Tiger covered the heavens. A terrifying wave of killing intent rushed out of his body.

“Little Doggy Huang, do you really think I’m afraid of you now that you defeated Yong Luosheng?!” Ferocious laughter left Xuanyuan Potian’s lips. “I’ll kill you right now! No! I’ll smash you apart like the little sh*tsack you are!”

Only if he tore Huang Xiaolong limb from limb would he be able to appease the anger in his heart.

The moment Xuanyuan Potian moved, the mid-level Dao Venerable reached out to stop him. It was true that Xuanyuan Potian was stronger than Yong Luosheng, but they were extremely clear that he wouldn’t be able to defeat someone who crushed Yong Luosheng with a single move.

Even someone at his level wasn’t confident of taking Huang Xiaolong down, much less Xuanyuan Potian!

“Is that so?” After getting up from the Qilin Chariot, Huang Xiaolong made his way towards them.

In an instant, the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable locked his attention on Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, you had better kneel down and apologize to His Highness! Otherwise, even if you manage to escape today, my Xuanyuan Creed will hunt you down to the ends of the world!”

“There will be nowhere for you to hide in the Divine Tuo Holy World!”

Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong instantly.

The high-level Dao Venerable beside Feng Yue spoke up all of a sudden. “Young Master Huang, why don’t I act as the mediator here. Apologize to the Lightning Tiger Prince, and we’ll call off all grudges. How about that?”

She was trying to help Huang Xiaolong out here. Even if Huang Xiaolong’s talent was the highest of everyone she had seen so far, she felt that it wasn’t wise for him to go against a behemoth like the Xuanyuan Creed.

“Elder Tong, you better stay in your place. If you overstep your boundaries, you can’t blame me for acting out of line.” Xuanyuan Potian sneered, “Little Doggy Huang, this won’t end until you kneel before me to beg for mercy!”
