The Horizon Church was one of the top five superpowers in the Radiance World. As soon as the Horizon church opened their mouth, many of the churches who had sided with the Radiance Knight Corp expressed their dissatisfaction.

“If we knew this was going to happen, we wouldn’t have come to the Myriad Spirits Divine City!”

“That’s right! Even though two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones are a huge temptation, we need to be alive to spend it!”

A frown formed on Elan’s face as she sat in the main seat in the hall.

These pontiffs had never been under her command. Even though they threw in their lot with the Radiance Knight Corp because of two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones, none of them were actually willing to listen to her orders. If not for the fact that they had sworn an oath when they took the spirit stones in the past, she was afraid that a few of them would have already left.

Just as the pontiffs in the hall were venting their anger and causing a ruckus, a brilliant light shot out from the space above the hall. A figure slowly appeared in the air.

When Elan saw who this person was, a look of joy appeared on her face. “Your Majesty!”

This person was precisely Huang Xiaolong, who had disappeared for half a year.

The bishops from the Radiance Knight Corp got to their feet as they greeted Huang Xiaolong. “Greetings, World Lord.”

As for the pontiffs from the church, they hastily got to their feet as they greeted Huang Xiaolong.

A sharp light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. He swept his gaze over the pontiffs who were complaining just a moment ago and sneered, “Since all of you have no faith in me and the Radiance Knight Corp, you can choose to leave. If you choose to leave, I will not stop you!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Awkward looks appeared on the faces of the pontiffs. However, no one took up Huang Xiaolong’s offer to leave.

“Alright, since all of you have decided to remain on our side, I hope that all of us will be able to work together. When we attack Radiance Divine City, listen to our orders. If anyone dares to disobey our orders, you can’t blame me for killing you!” Huang Xiaolong warned in a cold voice as the killing intent around him became extremely dense.

The Radiance World Leader’s mark slowly appeared in the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows, and rays of resplendent light swirled around him.

All the pontiffs in the hall felt their hearts constricting.

“World Lord, you don’t have to worry. Since we have already chosen to stand on the side of the Radiance Knight Corp, we will do our best to kill our enemies!” The pontiff of the Crossing Flame Church was the first to break the silence in the hall.

Seeing the Crossing Flame Pontiff making his stand, the other pontiffs in the hall hastily swore their allegiance once again.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and stared at them. “Relax. I have already promised all of you that we will split the treasures of Radiance Divine City the moment we take them down. In fact, I will give all of you another two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones after this is all over.”

“We thank World Lord!”

Looks of joy appeared on the faces of every pontiff in the room when they heard that Huang Xiaolong was ready to give them additional rewards.

“Elan, pass down my order. Gather the army. We will attack Radiance Divine City tomorrow!” Huang Xiaolong turned around and stared at Elan before barking out his order.

“Yes, Your Majesty!”

A peaceful night passed as everything seemed to come to a standstill.

Huang Xiaolong stared into the sky as he stood in the middle of the Myriad Spirits Manor.

The trip to the Devil World was extremely successful. He had dealt with the black copper ghosts and helped Cang Mutian to return to his peak strength. Cang Mutian and the current leader of the Dragon Bear Race, Cang Yuanzong had accompanied him to the Radiance World after that.

This time, Huang Xiaolong had absolute confidence in crushing Radiance Divine City.

There was no doubt about it. Other than Cang Mutian, Cang Yuanzong, and the Reverence Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong had also requested backup from his senior brother, Jiang Hong!

When he was making his way back from the Devil World, he had made a trip to the Grandmist Emperor Palace. Jiang Hong had gathered a good half of the Emperor Realm ancestors, and they had followed Huang Xiaolong to the Radiance World.

There were also the three ancestors of the Skull Devil Sect. Since Huang Xiaolong was planning to assemble the strongest lineup he could, the three ancestors who had submitted to him in the Devil World couldn’t be absent. They had brought a large group of Emperor Realm ancestors along with them as well.

Even if Dun Ei had the support of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Chu Han, Archdevil Ancestor Chiyou, the ex-Netherworld King’s Organization’s Lu Kun, the King of Shadows, and the world leader of the Fire World, he wouldn’t be able to change the outcome of the battle! There was only one way this battle would end, and Dun Ei was going to die!

There was also the issue of the Heavenly Court’s assistance. No matter how secretive Di Jun thought himself to be, how would Huang Xiaolong not know?!

When Huang Xiaolong thought about Di Jun and his son, Di Jing, a cold light flashed through his eyes.

There was also Lu Kun, the traitor of the Netherworld King’s Organization. Now that they had gathered, Huang Xiaolong was planning to deal with them in one fell swoop.

“Junior Brother, what are you thinking about?” Jiang Hong’s voice sounded from behind Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden.

“Are you afraid that Dun Ei is going to run away?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he shook his head, “With senior brother’s assistance along with the others, there is no need to fear Dun Ei running away.” A question suddenly rose in Huang Xiaolong’s mind. “Senior brother, do you think that there is another world above the likes of Hell and the other Greater Worlds?”

Jiang Hong was stunned for a second. However, he replied in a low voice, “That’s hard to say. Even Master is unable to confirm if there is a higher realm. There might only be one person in the world who has an answer to that question...”

Huang Xiaolong stared at Jiang Hong in shock. “Someone knows?”

Jiang Hong nodded his head and replied, “Yes.”

“Who?”

Jiang Hong hesitated for a moment before replying, “It’s the lord who is at the high-level Sovereign Realm!”

“Him...” Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath. Indeed, if anyone were to know about the existence of a higher realm, it could only be the only high-level Sovereign!

“Who is he?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

He had always been extremely curious as to the identity of the mysterious presence. After all, even his master, the King of Grandmist, and Cang Mutian held the expert in high regard.

Jiang Hong hesitated once again. However, he eventually replied, “Actually, the master doesn’t know much about him either. The only thing we know is that he is the city lord of the City of All-Heavens, Lord Wan Shi!”

“Wan Shi? City of All-Heavens?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned. This was the first time he had heard of City of All-Heavens. As for Wan Shi’s name, Huang Xiaolong could feel the tyrannical meaning behind it.

Jiang Hong nodded. “That’s right. City of All-Heavens, Lord Wan Shi! Even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, the Buddhist Ancestor, our master, and the Reverence Moon Old Man agreed that City of All-Heavens is the number one city under the Heavens!”

“City of All-Heavens... It’s not part of our myriad of worlds. In fact, it’s located somewhere far away. It doesn’t belong to any of the Greater Worlds.”

Huang Xiaolong stared at Jiang Hong in shock. “No part of our myriad of worlds? Could it be that City of All-Heavens is located in space itself?”

“That’s right. Other than City of All-Heavens, there are several small worlds located in space. City of All-Heavens is located in one of those small worlds. Moreover, the City of All-Heavens is located in the extremity of the space outside our worlds!” Jiang Hong seemed to have thought of something as he continued, “Right, I’ve received news that when Di Jing disappeared from the Divine World, he left for the City of All-Heavens!”

“Di Jing went to the City of All-Heavens?!” Huang Xiaolong felt a little surprised.

“Yes, he probably went there to challenge the Heavens Road. If he manages to succeed, he might be able to receive incredible gains! He might even become a threat to you!” A solemn expression appeared on Jiang Hong’s face. “Moreover, he might be aiming to receive Lord Wan Shi’s favor by heading there now. As long as he has Lord Wan Shi’s backing, no one will be able to do anything to him!”

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils constricted.

“You don’t have to worry too much about it now. Lord Wan Shi hasn’t appeared in the world for several billion years now. He probably won’t get to see Lord Wan Shi.” Jiang Hong hastily reassured Huang Xiaolong. “Moreover, I’ve heard that Senior Reverence Moon has already entered the high-level Sovereign Realm!”
