Chapter 3137: Kneel and Thank Young Patriarch Ao Bi

“That little lady has pretty respectable talent…” Lei Yu muttered.

“Even though she isn’t comparable to Xiao Yuncheng, she’s not too far behind.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. He could see that the other party hadn’t cultivated for a million years and her strength was only slightly weaker than Xiao Yuncheng and the others of his level. WIth her talent and power, she could definitely rank in the top fifties of the Mystical List.

That was a pretty good ranking if Huang Xiaolong had to say so himself. There were countless geniuses in the Origin Holy World, and even the top tiered genius of the Golden Fox Heavenly Cave, Fan Luo, couldn’t rank in the top fifty!

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate.

The night passed uneventfully, and the first rays of dawn soon shone upon the lands.

Huang Xiaoong stopped cultivating and he continued on his way deeper into the Origin Sea.

When they set off, the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed were stopped by the experts of the Silver Winged Creed.

Their creeds had been at odds since god knew when, and the Silver Winged Creed was the main culprit when it came to poisoning their patriarch.

The members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed didn’t expect the members of the Silver Winged Creed to chase them all the way to the Origin Sea.

In stark contrast to the ugly expressions on the faces of those of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed, Liu Ang, the young patriarch of the Silver Winged Creed was laughing in glee. He looked at the pretty lady from the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed and sneered, “Cheng Xiaoyuan, I bet you didn’t expect to meet us here.”

The lady immediately lashed out at them, “Liu Ang, you despicable being! You poisoned my master! Today, we’ll settle things once and for all!”

Liu Ang roared with laughter, “Hahaha! There’s no need to rush to your deaths! Let me introduce you to someone!” He pointed at a young man standing behind him and he said, “This is the young patriarch of the Azure Dragon Race, Ao Bi!”

Cheng Xiaoyuan’s expression changed.

The Azure Dragon Race was one of the super races in the Origin Lands! They ranked in the top thirties, and it was said that they possessed some sort of special relationship with the Nine Eyed Black Tiger Race.

Soon after, Liu Ang introduced several others and all of them were eminent elder-level characters of the Azure Dragon Race!

Every single one of them possessed an extremely high status in the Origin Lands. Even if the patriarch of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed met them, he would have to lower his head.

The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed might be a superpower in the Origin Lands, but they were far too lacking when compared to the Azure Dragon Race.

Liu Ang felt a trace of delight sprouting in his heart when he looked at the reactions on the faces of those from the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed.

“Young Patriarch Ao Bi…” Cheng Xiaoyuan greeted. “Our Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed has no enmity with your Azure Dragon Race. I wonder what Young Master Ao Bi is here for…”

A look of arrogance appeared on Ao Bi’s face. “I’ve heard about Young Lady Cheng’s beauty from Liu Ang. You also have an innate Golden Dragon Bloodline. I’m here to take a look for myself.” After he spoke, he sized her up. “You’re really pretty. Hahaha. I’m looking for my one hundredth wife, and you’re perfect to take the position!”

The faces of Cheng Xiaoyuan and the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed changed.

“Many thanks to Young Master Ao Bi for your admiration. However, I’m not planning to get married anytime soon.”

“Cheng Xiaoyuan, you’re too full of yourself. Young Master Ao Bi took a liking to you, and it’s an honor for your Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed. Do you really think that you’re special? If Young Master Ao Bi is not planning to look for a lady with a dragon bloodline, you won’t even catch his eye!” Liu Ang sneered.

As the most talented cultivator in the younger generation of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed, Cheng Xiaoyuan’s talent was too scary for the Silver Winged Creed to allow her to run free. If they allowed her to mature, she might turn into a threat that brought an end to their creed in the future. As such, they had always been thinking of ways to get rid of her.

With Ao Bi’s special technique, he would be able to suck her dry after they were married! He could absorb her bloodline, and get rid of her talent!

Moreover, the Silver Winged Race could use the chance to get closer to the Azure Dragon Race by throwing Cheng Xiaoyuan under the bus! That was a perfect combo for Liu Ang, and he wouldn’t give up on the chance!

Cheng Xiaoyuan glared at Liu Ang and her face turned as red as a tomato.

“Since our Young Master has already spoken, you can come with us now.” One of the eminent elders spoke to Cheng Xiaoyuan. “We will inform your patriarch about the time of the wedding soon. When everything is settled, we will send you some gifts.”

His tone was firm, and it seemed as though everything had already been set in stone.

The members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed revealed ugly expressions. The Azure Dragon Race was kidnapping their young lady in broad daylight!

Moreover, they were only getting the invitation to attend the wedding, and they had no say in the details! What the f*ck was that?!

It was clear as day that they didn’t respect the wishes of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed at all!

“Cheng Xiaoyuan is the young patriarch of our Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed, and she will not be leaving with you!” One of the eminent elders of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed roared in anger.

When the eminent elder of the Azure Dragon Race heard what he said, he started to release his aura to suppress those of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed. The members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed retreated repeatedly, and even Cheng Xiaoyuan failed to stand her ground. The strength of the eminent elder from the Azure Dragon Race exceeded their expectations.

They were only going up against a single eminent elder of the Azure Dragon Race, but they felt as though they couldn’t even put up a fight!

The eminent elder of the Azure Dragon Race sneered, “Cheng Xiaoyuan, follow us obediently. If you force us to make a move, everyone around you will die here.”

His threat couldn’t be more obvious.

A trace of delight bloomed in Liu Ang’s heart. He really wanted to see what Cheng Xiaoyuan would choose.

“Xiaoyuan, there’s no need to bother about us!” An eminent elder from the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed roared. He glared at Liu Ang and the others. “Even if we die today, they won’t be able to bring you away!”

“Leave!”

As soon as he spoke, the members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed sprung into action. They lunged at the members of the Azure Dragon Race.

Ao Bi’s expression turned cold and he harrumphed, “Kill them all! Leave the woman alive.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Just as the members of the Azure Dragon Race were about to make their move, a lightning dragon tore through the skies and sent every single expert from the Azure Dragon Race flying.

Everything happened too quickly and no one could react in time. The members of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Creed and the Silver Winged Creed stared at the scene before them in shock as their bodies froze.

When everyone turned around, they saw a young man riding on a three-headed beast approaching them, and there were twelve experts standing behind him.
