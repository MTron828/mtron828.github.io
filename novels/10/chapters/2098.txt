Chapter 2099: Break Through!

“Late-Seventh Order Sovereign?! I think he would have broken into the Eighth Order!”

“That’s what I think too. He might even be a mid-Eighth Order Sovereign...”

Everyone broke out into spirited discussions about Lord Wan Shi’s strength when they heard that he was about to leave seclusion.

Some of them were sure that he would be a late-Seventh Order Sovereign while others felt that he would already be in the mid-Eighth Order Sovereign Realm!

In the Divine World, everyone heard the news about Wan Shi leaving seclusion, and a layer of gloom descended on them. The Reverence Moon Old Man, the King of Grandmist, the King of Darkness, Du Hai of the Six-Winged Green Mosquito Race, and the others stared at each other in dismay.

Wan Shi leaving seclusion wasn’t good news for any of them.

“Within ten years...” The King of Grandmist frowned, “Why is he leaving seclusion so early?!” A trace of worry flashed in his eyes.

Du Hai asked with a trace of suspicion in his eyes, “Could it be a rumor started by those in the City of All-Heavens?”

The Reverence Moon Old Man shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s real. If they were spreading rumors, they would simply say that Lord Wan Shi would be emerging from his secluded cultivation in a year or two!”

The King of Darkness looked at everyone present, and he nodded in agreement. “I’m afraid it’s true...”

The hall fell into silence as the air turned still.

The name, ‘Wan Shi,’ was like a massive mountain pressing down on their chest. Even someone at the level of the Reverence Moon Old Man found it hard to breathe.

Everyone also knew that other than Wan Shi, there was also another troublesome individual to deal with!

“I wonder how strong Wan Shi is right now...” The King of Darkness finally broke the silence after some time.

Those present in the hall stared at each other as they felt tongue-tied.

“He might have broken into the late-Seventh Order Sovereign Realm...” Du Hai guessed.

The Reverence Moon Old Man shook his head, “I’m afraid that might not be the case!”

Once again, the mood in the hall turned solemn.

That was the worst thing that could have happened. If Wan Shi was only at the late-Seventh Order Sovereign Realm, they would still have a trace of hope. After all, Huang Xiaolong had already obtained the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus. The moment he enters the mid-level Sovereign Realm, he would be able to stand against Wan Shi.

However, the same couldn’t be said if Wan Shi had broken through...

Even if Huang Xiaolong enters the mid-level Sovereign Realm, he would be no match for an Eighth Order Sovereign!

The moment Huang Xiaolong fails to hold Wan Shi back, everything would be over!

“We can only hope that Wan Shi is at the late-Seventh Order Sovereign Realm when he leaves seclusion...” The King of Grandmist sighed.

“I wonder how Xiaolong is now...” The Reverence Moon Old Man changed the topic when he noticed the depressing atmosphere in the hall.

“I have no idea... I contacted Azure Cow several days ago, but even she doesn’t know anything about Huang Xiaolong’s situation.” The King of Grandmist shook his head and continued, “From what she said, Xiaolong is currently isolated in a space he carved out. None of them can enter due to the overwhelming origin energy...”

“Let’s just hope that Xiaolong will be able to enter the mid-level Sovereign Realm in ten years...” A bitter smile appeared on the King of Darkness’s face.

“We can only hope...”

...

As the rumors of Wan Shi leaving seclusion spread like wildfire throughout the lands, Huang Xiaolong was busy devouring the origin energy around him. Like what the King of Grandmist said, the space he was in was surrounded by astounding amounts of origin energy. The energy was so concentrated that it formed a storm strong enough to crush worlds. Even existences like the little cow and Cang Mutian couldn’t enter the space due to the origin energy storm.

They could do nothing but wait for Huang Xiaolong to emerge.

As for the Four Spirit Jade Zoysia, the two of them had long since refined it.

“Will anything happen to Xiaolong?” The little cow stared at the tyrannical storm of origin energy surrounding the space he was in, and she pondered. There was a look of terror that flashed in her eyes from time to time.

“Probably not...” Cang Mutian replied. Despite his response, he wasn’t sure that Huang Xiaolong was safe. After all, even the two of them wouldn’t be able to withstand the origin energy storm in the space around him. Who would know if Huang Xiaolong had already been torn to shreds by the tyrannical storm of origin energy...

“This kid is really something... He caused such a huge commotion just by entering seclusion...” The little cow grumbled, “Wan Shi is about to emerge from his seclusion... If Xiaolong can’t complete his refinement, we’re all going to die!”

Cang Mutian laughed, “I never thought that Old Ancestor Azure Cow, the lofty Lord Demon, would be afraid of death!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Rolling her eyes, the little cow snapped at him, “Don’t tell me you’re not afraid of Wan Shi?!”

Cang Mutian snickered under his breath, but he refused to reply to her.

All of a sudden, the tyrannical storm stopped. The origin energy in the space around Huang Xiaolong seemed to come to a standstill. In an instant, the heavens and earth fell silent, and it was as though time stopped.

When the two of them looked at the scene before them, they sucked in a cold breath. However, their hearts lurched in the next second as they felt an unprecedented sense of fear.

“Retreat!” The little cow exclaimed in shock.

In the next instant, the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python shot backwards.

The instant they left, a heaven-shaking explosion rang out, and the space around the desolate region they had chosen started to tremble.

A terrifying wave of energy emerged from the space Huang Xiaolong was in.

The horrifying blast caused the lands to crumble and the skies to shake. The little cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python were sent flying, and they only managed to stabilize themselves after flying several million miles away.

As they looked at each other, the little cow and Cang Mutian saw the look of joy in each other’s eyes.

This...

A burst of tyrannical energy emerged from inside the space Huang Xiaolong was in. When the three of them felt the sense of suppression from the majestic aura that emerged, they couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

Pillars of golden light emerged as they shot towards the skies. As it dyed the sky with an impressive hue of gold, the earth continued to collapse above them.

Under the gazes of the three overlords present, a bottomless chasm formed where the desolate land once stood. All it took was thirty breaths of time for the barren land they had chosen to turn into a bottomless abyss...

As the tyrannical aura rose, the origin energy surrounding them slowly started to dissipate. After several minutes, all the origin energy around them disappeared as the land slowly became peaceful again.

“Did that kid break through?” A trace of suspicion appeared on the little cow’s face, and she stared at the space Huang Xiaolong was located in. Her heartbeat sped up, and she breathed a little quicker.

Cang Mutian was no different as a trace of anxiousness appeared in his eyes. He tightened his fist as that was the moment that would determine his fate.

As a minute slowly passed, there was no trace of Huang Xiaolong.

Just as the three of them were getting a little anxious, a figure emerged from the abyss. When they saw the familiar face, a look of joy appeared on the little cow’s face.

“Xiaolong!” The three overlords rushed towards him.

It went without saying that the person who just emerged was Huang Xiaolong.

When they finally arrived before him, the little cow and Cang Mutian both realized that they were unable to detect Huang Xiaolong’s true strength. Even though Huang Xiaolong was standing in front of them, they failed to detect his presence.

“Kid, you... you broke through?” The little cow muttered in a low voice as she stared at Huang Xiaolong with a trace of uncertainty.

Cang Mutian looked at him with a trace of suspicion.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in response. “It was all by luck! I barely managed to break through...”

He knew that the little cow was a Fourth Order Sovereign. He had barely managed to enter the Fourth Order Sovereign Realm, but it wasn’t because of the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus. Before going into seclusion, he had felt that the lotus would be enough to bring him all the way into the mid-level Sovereign Realm. However, reality proved otherwise, and he was lucky he still had the Darkness Gold Fruit and the high-level two Nine Paths Grass!

After refining both of them, Huang Xiaolong had finally managed to enter the Fourth Order Sovereign Realm!
