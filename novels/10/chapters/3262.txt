Chapter 3263: Are You Sure You Want to Dig Them Out One by One?

As they drove to the barren land, Huang Xiaolong told everyone that he had planted those seeds he had bought last night. Huang Jiyuan’s reaction was very big. He widened his eyes and stared at Huang Xiaolong. “Silly boy! You, you started the work last night?! Why won’t you listen to my advice, I told you, it’s impossible for you to succeed without the required agricultural skills and methods. This is irrelevant to cultivation. Although you’re a Nascent Soul expert, you can’t make those spiritual herbs’ and spiritual fruit trees’ seeds sprout!”

His indescribable expression of heartache nearly made Huang Xiaolong laugh!

His heart ached for those several hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones Huang Xiaolong had spent buying those seeds.

Several hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones, ah!

In the past, he couldn’t spend this amount in a lifetime.

Yet Huang Xiaolong, this prodigal son, squandered it overnight.

Wang Meilan too was extremely anxious when she heard that. “Xiaolong, drive faster. Dig out those seeds one by one, and we should be able to save them still!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly. “Mom, are you sure you want to dig them all out one by one?”

Wang Meilan looked very serious as she nodded her head. “Correct!” She softened her voice, and persuaded, “Mom knows that you have money now. Even so, you shouldn’t throw money away like that! Even one billion won’t last you a year with the way you spend.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled slightly. It’s fine to not explain. They’ll decide later if they still want to dig those seeds out…

Before long, the others saw the acres of barren land Huang Xialong had bought.

However, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou were speechless upon seeing the great wall over ten meters tall that seemed to go on endlessly.

“Xiaolong, didn’t you say the land you bought is a barren land? What’s going on with this wall?” Wang Meilan was utterly dumbfounded.

Not only her, but others looked just as baffled.

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “After I planted those seeds, I was worried others would come in and steal them, so I erected a wall around the entire place.”

Huang Chenfei almost did not find his voice. “Brother, this ten meters tall wall, you built this entirely alone?!” The disbelief on his face was quite funny.

Even with advanced technology at its fastest speed, coupled with maximum manpower, it was still impossible to build this wall overnight.

Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and Huang Datou stood woodenly on the spot, looking like they were listening to profound scriptures.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled watching their expressions. “I know some earth-element techniques, so building these didn’t take much time for me.”

In the meantime, the five of them had reached the main gate, and the wooden main gate automatically opened upon their arrival, revealing a ten-meter wide stone walkway before them. Huang Xiaolong drove in, and the others also drove in after Huang Xiaolong in marveling gazes.

On the sides of the ten-meter wide stone walkway, were the spiritual herbs’ seeds that Huang Xiaolong had planted the night before!

These spiritual herbs had sprouted and grown tremendously, reaching half the height of an adult man. They were enshrouded in spiritual energy that resembled resplendent halos. Fragrant scents of herbs refreshed everyone in a whiff! Just a little bit further down were rows and rows of spiritual fruit trees!

These spiritual fruit trees had grown over ten meters tall!

And hanging off their branches were glistening spiritual fruits! From white spiritual fruits with a hint of bright red within, to spiritual fruits with glistening golden flames within, or emitted a purple gem-like luster, and there were many more varieties.

The wide array of spiritual fruits made any one of them reluctant to look away.

“Xia-Xiaolong, those spiritual herbs, and spiritual fruit trees?!” Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan were tongue-tied.

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled. “They are the ones I planted last night.”

“What?!” Although they had guessed it, hearing it from the horse’s mouth still gave Huang Jiyuan and the others a great shock. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“No, Xiaolong, didn’t. Am I hallucinating?!” Wang Meilan shook Huang Jiyuan’s arm as she said.

Huang Jiyuan’s eyes were a little out of focus as he replied dazedly, “You’re not the only one hallucinating, all of us are hallucinating!”

How else can one explain how these spiritual herbs and spiritual fruits had ripened overnight?!

On top of that, these herbs and fruits seemed richer with spiritual energy than those sold outside!

It was as if these herbs and spiritual fruits had a life of their own.

The smile never left Huang Xiaolong’s face. He had expected his parents’ reactions and did not explain too much. He understood they needed time to digest what their eyes were seeing.

Ten minutes later, Huang Jiyuan and the others finally reacted and asked Huang Xiaolong about what was going on. They were curious to know how these spiritual herbs and spiritual fruit trees had grown and ripened overnight?

Huang Xiaolong briefly recounted what he had done last night to them.

Listening to Huang Xiaolong explaining he had transformed the land’s soil quality, added a spiritual vein underground, and even arranged a spiritual energy gathering formation, Huang Jiyuan and the others felt their brain cells weren’t working fast enough.

In truth, this piece of barren land had turned into a piece of immortal land last night, however, Huang Xiaolong did not want to frighten his family, so he merely said it was spirit soil.

Even this sent waves of shock in his family’s heart. They had heard of spirit soil, the number one cultivation family in Huaxia, the Ying Family, had a piece of spirit soil, specifically used to grow and nurture rare spiritual herbs. And those spiritual herbs were treated as inheritance treasure.

Not even the Ying Family possessed a spiritual vein, only the six top-tier sects on Earth have spiritual veins.

Furthermore, the Ying Family’s old ancestor had spent several years to succeed, investing in a huge amount of resources. Even so, Ying Family’s formation’s coverage was several hundred square meters at most, much smaller than this land.

But Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual energy gathering formation covered more than a million square meters!

While Huang Jiyuan and the others looked around in shock, they arrived at the center where the residential palace was located.

Looking at the building that seemed to come out from a mythical move, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and the others had forgotten where they were.

“I forged these palace buildings. The craftsmanship is a little rough, and the iron ore nearby isn't enough, so I’ve only made a few of them. I’ll look for more iron and ores in the next few days and expand the place.”

Huang Jiyuan and the others were completely at a loss for words.

The beautiful, flawless, and surreal palace before their eyes was a little rough to Huang Xiaolong? Moreover, this palace was at least six to seven thousand square meters, merely a small part of it? How big would it be if the construction was finished?

“Dad, Mom, I’ve arranged a small Complete Heaven Formation inside. In the future, all of you will stay here and cultivate.” Huang Xiaolong went on, “I’ll activate the formation and show you.”

With that said, he waved his hand and the palace building’s dozen runes glimmered. Then, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and the others saw starlight gathered like a river in the sky, then rained down softly, looking picturesque like a fairyland.

Enshrouded by this star power, Huang Jiyuan and the others felt comfortable all over like never before.
