Just as the Zhu Family’s Grand Elders were expressing their anger, the Zhu Family Patriarch who had yet to express a word suddenly spoke in a heavy tone, “Surely, we’re not letting this matter end like this, our Zhu Family is not soft persimmons like the Jiang Family or the Gudu Family! But, today’s Huang Xiaolong has already soared to a high place. Even if we disregard his Master Feng Yang, there is still the Ascending Moon Old Man behind him, killing Huang Xiaolong will not be an easy task.”

Everyone in the great hall fell into silence.

“Patriarch, in my opinion, the people are exaggerating.” The first Zhu Family Grand Elder commented nonchalantly, “Even if that Huang Xiaolong is really a late-Tenth Order God Realm, with rumors everywhere trumpeting his might, how strong can he be? I don’t believe that a mere God Realm has the power of a Highgod Realm master!”

“I agree, that Huang Xiaolong has only cultivated for slightly over a hundred years!” Another Zhu Family Grand Elder chimed in, “As monstrous as his talent might be, there’s a limit to how strong he can be!”

“That Azure Dragon Institute’s Lu Cong only had an inflated reputation, that’s why he was easily killed by Huang Xiaolong.”

Following that, more and more Grand Elders spoke their opinions, belittling Huang Xiaolong.

Right at this time, a Zhu Family Elder ran into the great hall, reporting in a hurried manner, “Reporting to Patriarch, Huang Xiaolong is here!”

In an instant, all clamors died down, one could hear a pin drop in the silence.

Huang Xiaolong is here!

Those Grand Elders that were mocking and belittling Huang Xiaolong had various interesting expressions on their faces, from frozen smiles to wide-eyed astonishment.

Huang Xiaolong and Liu Yun did not conceal their movements upon arriving at the New Stone City, thus, the moment they stepped out from the transmission array, they were recognized by Zhu Family disciples.

“I didn’t expect that Huang Xiaolong would dare to show his face here!” One of Zhu Family Grand Elders said, regaining his composure. He sneered and added, “Sending himself up to die, we shall fulfill his wish!”

A Grand Elder got to his feet, saying, “Patriarch, we must seize this opportunity, we absolutely cannot allow Huang Xiaolong to escape!”

Zhu Family’s Patriarch Zhu Chu solemnly ordered, “All of you follow me outside, but don’t kill him yet. Capture him and we’ll see what Feng Yang has to say.”

“Yes, Patriarch!”

Zhu Chu abruptly stood up from his seat, leading all Zhu Family’s Grand Elders marching out from the great hall to Huang Xiaolong and Liu Yun’s location.

Zhu Chenyi followed behind the large group, looking like he had something to say, but gave up in the end.

Although the strength Huang Xiaolong had shown in the Black Warrior City surprised him, Zhu Chenyi didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong was a match for their Zhu Family Patriarch, Zhu Chu.

Their Zhu Family Patriarch was a peak mid-First Order Highgod Realm master!

He was close to breaking through to late-First Order Highgod Realm.

On another side, Huang Xiaolong and Liu Yun finally arrived at the New Stone City. However, when they passed through the city gates, they discovered that every corner had Zhu Family disciples on guard.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind, his actions and demeanour were relaxed as he and Liu Yun headed in the direction of the Zhu Family manor.

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong stopped moving.

Liu Yun was baffled by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden halt, but immediately understood when he saw the Zhu Family Patriarch leading his family’s Grand Elders in all grandeur, flying from the other end of the street. Liu Yun’s face tightened nervously seeing this. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong calmly waited.

Very soon, Zhu Chu and the Grand Elders arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong and Liu Yun.

Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense spread out, seeing that the Zhu Family Elders and disciples had already surrounded them in several layers of encirclement, not even a fly could escape.

“Huang Xiaolong, you killed a disciple our Zhu Family, have you come to admit your crime and receive punishment?” A Zhu Family Grand Elder sneered coldly, “However, a life for a life, even if you beg on your knees, the result will be the same.”

Admit your crime and receive punishment?

Beg on your knees?

Huang Xiaolong was stumped. He then quickly realized the said Zhu Family disciple was referring to Zhu Wuhou. Huang Xiaolong shook his head while smiling, wondering if Zhu Family Grand Elder thought too highly of their Zhu Family.

From the beginning, Huang Xiaolong had never given a second thought about Zhu Wuhou’s death.

“What are you laughing at?” The same Zhu Family Grand Elder’s expression sank, glaring at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong shrugged, “I am laughing because you’re too idiotic.”

“What?!” That Zhu Family Grand Elder was enraged and was about to attack Huang Xiaolong when Zhu Chu snapped at him: “Enough!”

That Grand Elder dispersed his attack, but was still glaring at Huang Xiaolong.

Patriarch Zhu Chu slowly turned to face Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, you killed my Zhu Family’s core disciple Zhu Wuhou, how do you want to solve this matter?”

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent, “I came here to see your Zhu Family Ancestor, tell him to come out to talk.”

The Zhu Family members were stunned. Even more so, they were outraged by Huang Xiaolong’s disrespect toward their Ancestor.

Huang Xiaolong was saying that all of them here weren’t qualified to speak to him? Not even their Patriarch?

Zhu Chu’s expression darkened, his gaze cold and frightening.

“Presumptuous!” A different Grand Elder shouted. “Huang Xiaolong, don’t assume that just because you killed the Azure Dragon Institute’s Lu Cong you’re really invincible! Below the Highgod Realm, all are mere ants. Our Ancestor is not someone that a lowly person like you can meet just because you say so. Even in front of our Patriarch, you are merely qualified to carry his shoes!”

“Patriarch, let me go detain this Huang Xiaolong!” Another Grand Elder requested, his tone hoarse with anger.

Zhu Chu waved his hand, stopping them from doing anything.

His chilling gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong before shifting to Liu Yun beside him. “Huang Xiaolong, the reason you want to see our Ancestor is to request him to dissolve the engagement between our Zhu and Qi Families? Fine, I’ll let you see him if you can take one palm strike from me!”

But Huang Xiaolong shook his head again, “If you can take one palm strike me, then these twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones are yours. However, if you fail, then take out the blood contract and dissolve the betrothal with the Qi Family.” With a wave of his hand, a rain of spirit stones fell from the air.

The street beneath their feet quaked as spirit stones continued to fall.

A giant pile of spirit stones appeared in front of the Zhu Family elders and disciples. Looking at the twenty thousand high divine grade spirit stones, gulping sounds of could be heard as the large group of Zhu Family’s eyes shone with greed.

Zhu Chu was no different, but in the next second his complexion didn’t look so good.

What did Huang Xiaolong say just now? Turning his words back at him, daring him to take his palm strike? From Huang Xiaolong’s tone, he was implying that Zhu Chu wouldn’t be able to withstand it?!

Zhu Chu was red with fury, killing intent boiling in his blood as he gritted his teeth through every word, “Fine! Huang Xiaolong, this is the blood contract, if I fail to take one hit from you, I’ll rescind the marriage agreement with the Qi Family!” Zhu Chu agreed, taking out a blood-red contract.

“Patriarch!” The surrounding Zhu Family Grand Elders wanted to persuade Zhu Chu otherwise.

“All of you retreat!” Zhu Chu coldly ordered.

All the Grand Elders, Elders, and disciples could only acknowledge and retreat some distance away.

“Junior Apprentice-brother, the Zhu Family’s Patriarch is a peak mid-First Order Highgod Realm master, you...?” Liu Yun was nervous, looking anxiously at Huang Xiaolong.

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.” Huang Xiaolong gave Liu Yun an assured look.

Liu Yun wanted to say more, but Huang Xiaolong already made up his mind. He could only retreat to the back.
