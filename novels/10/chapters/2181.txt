Chapter 2182: Clashing with the Members of the 33 Heavens Race?

The experts of the 33 Heavens Race were searching for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool with some sort of secret method. When they heard whistling in the air, they turned their heads to stare at the newcomers. The moment they laid eyes on Huang Xiaolong, a stunned expression filled their faces.

It was extremely difficult to travel through space outside the 33 heavens, and they only managed to do so with a secret technique. When they had finally arrived, they had managed to learn that the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool was located around them.

Are they here for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool?!

How would they know where the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool is?

Did they follow our tracks?!

The expression on the faces of the experts of the 33 Heavens Race sank.

Several experts flew towards Huang Xiaolong and blocked his way.

“This is a forbidden area marked out by our 33 Heavens Race. Please leave this place!” They didn’t bother speaking nicely to Huang Xiaolong and the others as they tried to chase everyone away. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

They weren’t rude to Huang Xiaolong alone. Even if they were to meet the members of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, they would behave the same way. After all, they had the ability to do so.

“What if I refuse?” A look of indifference appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

The members of the 33 Heavens Race looked at each other and a frown formed on their faces.

“Huang Xiaolong, I know that you aren’t weak. However, you better not offend our 33 Heavens Race. Even the Giant Kun Heavenly Country cannot afford to go against us.” One of the experts from the 33 Heavens Race growled.

According to him, he had shown Huang Xiaolong the respect he deserved. If they weren’t talking to Huang Xiaolong, they would have already made a move to kill every single person present.

This time, the goal of the 33 Heavens Race was to obtain the Lightning Origin Divine Tree. Other than the divine tree, they also wanted to obtain the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool.

In the space outside the 33 Heavens, the experts of the 33 Heavens Race had split into two groups. Half of them were led by the deputy patriarch of the 33 Heavens Race to locate the Lightning Origin Divine Tree, and the other half was led by their grand elder to look for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool.

The person who was speaking to Huang Xiaolong was precisely Hao Wei, the grand elder of the 33 Heavens Race.

Staring at Hao Wei, a chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “The Giant Kun Heavenly Country can do what they want. I’m Huang Xiaolong and I do what I want.”

With the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool right in front of him, there was no way he would leave now. It didn’t matter if the 33 Heavens Race was trying to stop him. Even if the Giant Kun Heavenly Country were to gather the forces of all the Heavenly Countries in the Heavens Path, they wouldn’t be able to stop Huang Xiaolong.

Hearing what Huang Xiaolong said, the grand elder’s face sank. He stared at Huang Xiaolong and the rest of the members in his party.

All of a sudden, every single member of the 33 Heavens Race who were searching for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool stopped as they gathered behind the grand elder.

“Huang Xiaolong, going against the 33 Heavens Race can only mean one thing, and that means death!” A lightning blade appeared in one of the elder’s hands as he pointed the tip at Huang Xiaolong.

The elder who spoke was called Li Haifeng and his strength was only second to the grand elder, Hao Wei. Even though he wasn’t a Tenth Order Sovereign, his cultivation had reached the peak of the late-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm. He was also ranked in the top ten among the experts of the 33 Heavens Race.

Without giving a response, the God Burying Coffin appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. Slapping its surface, the coffin started to grow bigger as it smashed towards Li Haifeng.

Li Haifeng’s expression finally changed as he felt the destructive force flying towards him. A grunt left his lips as he slashed towards the massive coffin. Lighting in the form of dragons shot out from his blade the moment he swung it.

Before the eyes of everyone present, the lightning dragons dissipated the moment it came into contact with the coffin. It didn’t even slow the coffin down for a fraction of a second and it continued on its trajectory towards Li Haifeng.

Hao Wei snorted when he saw the scene before him as lightning gathered in his palms. Sending both palms forward, he slapped at the God Burying Coffin.

“Boom!”

Two massive palms formed from lightning clashed with the gigantic coffin in mid air.

The death qi around the coffin quickly dissipated under the terrifying might of the lightning energy coming from Hao Wei’s attack and the members of the 33 Heavens Race rejoiced. Before they could start celebrating, the coffin started emitting copious amounts of death qi once again and sucked away the vitality of any living creatures billions of miles around them. Restoring the strength it had lost, the God Burying Coffin smashed through Hao Wei’s lightning palms as it continued to shoot towards Li Haifeng.

“Everyone, attack!” Hao Wei’s expression changed and he roared with rage.

All the members of the 33 Heavens Race moved in unison as lightning bolts filled the area. As bolts of divine lightning flashed about around them, a world of lightning was formed as it surged towards the God Burying Coffin.

The combined strength of everyone from the 33 Heavens Race finally managed to stop the God Burying Coffin. As it stopped in the space within the world of lightning, the boundless death qi it emitted was slowly suppressed by the energy contained in the lightning world.

Even though they managed to barely stop Huang Xiaolong’s God Burying Coffin, Hao Wei and Li Haifeng realized that their backs were drenched in cold sweat.

Before they could gain a second of reprieve, a tiny chaos axe appeared in the space above the lightning world. As it slammed downwards, the world of lightning formed from the combined strength of all the members of the 33 Heavens Race present started to fluctuate. The world trembled non-stop under the impact of the tiny chaos axe.

As though the axe slammed into them, everyone felt their bodies shaking from the blow.

Wearing an expression of indifference, Huang Xiaolong activated his three complete dao saint godheads at the same time as the tiny chaos axe rose into the air once again.

He showed no mercy as the tiny chaos axe fell towards the world of lightning once again!

Boom!

An ear-shattering explosion resounded through the air. The world of lightning started to crack as a massive valley appeared where Huang Xiaolong’s axe landed.

Everyone from the 33 Heavens Race spat out mouthfuls after mouthfuls of blood.

All of a sudden, the tiny chaos axe rose into the air once again.

With his final attack, the world of lightning was smashed into smithereens as everyone from the 33 Heavens Race was sent flying.

“Kill!” Huang Xiaolong’s frosty voice rang through the space around him.

The moment his order left his lips, the well-prepared Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler led everyone towards the members of the 33 Heavens Race.

Miserable cries filled the skies in an instant.

...

After half an hour, the corpses of the members of the 33 Heavens Race lined the mountain range around them.

Huang Xiaolong swept a cold gaze over their corpses before laying down another order. “Clean up the battlefield.”

Sounds of acknowledgements could be heard as the experts of both heavenly countries started to raid the battlefield.

There was only a single survivor out of the forty experts the 33 Heavens Race had sent to the depths of the space outside the 33 heavens, and he was Hao Wei. Everyone else was killed, including Li Haifeng. He was killed by a single punch from Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Hao Wei escaped with the help of a secret treasure the 33 Heavens Race possessed, he wasn’t exactly in the best of state when he left. His injuries were serious and he was close to death.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother chasing down Hao Wei as he had more important matters to take care of. Using all eight great lightning pools in his body, he located the general location of the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool. Setting up countless restrictions around him, Huang Xiaolong prevented the lightning pool from escaping.

As he prepared to hunt down the final lightning pool, the news of Huang Xiaolong killing several dozen experts from the 33 Heavens Race started to spread. The news shocked many experts from the world outside the 33 heavens.

“What?! There were forty-four experts from the 33 Heavens Race and only the grand elder managed to escape?!”

“Hao Wei is a peak early-Tenth Order Sovereign! He’s stronger than the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng! How can he lose to Huang Xiaolong?”

Very quickly, the news reached the ears of the experts from the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and the Heavenly Terror Country.

Dong Cheng’s eyes widened and his jaws dropped when he heard the news. He sank into silence for a long time.
