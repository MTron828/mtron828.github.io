Chapter 2282: Get Up Here and Face Your Death!

“Get people to spread the news.” Forefather Jiang turned and spoke to the patriarch of the Jiang Family.

He wanted the experts of every single superpower to witness the battle that spelled certain death for Huang Xiaolong. He wanted them to see Huang Xiaolong’s death with their eyes.

With the various experts of the Central Holy Dynasty as his witnesses, even Li Wen wouldn’t be able to do a thing to him.

“Yes, forefather!” The Jiang Family Patriarch replied and started to lay down his orders.

In a flash, even those random sects that no one cared about received news about the life and death challenge going down between Huang Xiaolong and Yang Rong the next day.

The Central Holy Dynasty’s capital city erupted in an instant.

“Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong is going to battle Holy Prince Yang Rong to the death?! Even though he is the Holy Prince of our Holy Gate, rumor has it that his talent is trash! His complete dao saint godhead ranks in the four thousand, and he is the second weakest individual in the Holy Gate!”

“How can a useless b*stard like him agree to battle the Holy Prince of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground to the death? If he loses, wouldn’t he be dragging our reputation through the mud?”

“If I were him, I would hide myself from the world! He’s a fool for keeping such a high profile!”

Experts from super sects or families started to discuss fervently when they heard the news of the battle. Many shook their heads at Huang Xiaolong’s foolishness.

Since the news of Huang Xiaolong’s duel with Huang Zhouping was sealed off by the Holy Gate, only several Venerable-level sects and top tier families had managed to obtain information on the battle. Those first-rate and second-rate sects had no idea how strong Huang Xiaolong really was.

Because of that, many people felt that Huang Xiaolong was a weakling with a rank of four thousand saint godhead.

Adding to the fact that the Jiang Family was fanning the flames in the dark, everyone was mocking Huang Xiaolong on the streets.

While the flames of battle were burning bright in the city, Feng Tianyu revealed bitter laughter when he looked at Huang Xiaolong in a luxuriously built courtyard. “Brother Huang, you hid yourself real deep....”

He would have never thought that Huang Xiaolong would be a Holy Prince of the Holy Gate.

When the members of the Jiang Family referred to Huang Xiaolong as the Holy Prince, he couldn’t believe his ears. Even now, he hadn’t gotten over his shock.

Huang Xiaolong laughed in response, “Brother Tianyu, I didn’t hide anything from you. You didn’t ask!”

Feng Tianyu scratched his head awkwardly, “That’s true...” However, a trace of worry appeared in his eyes in the next instant. “Brother Huang, are you really going to battle to the death tomorrow?!”

Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms as he straightened his back. “Don’t worry about me. I never do things I’m not confident about.”

Feng Tianyu finally managed to calm down when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

In the lower worlds, he had sparred with Huang Xiaolong for a thousand years, and he was extremely clear on Huang Xiaolong’s personality.

The night passed uneventfully, and sunlight quickly fell on the lands.

Under the brilliant rays of the sun, the city seemed to be painted in a resplendent golden hue.

In the morning, Jiang Wuji and the others appeared to ‘greet’ Huang Xiaolong.

“Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong, are you ready for the battle?” Jiang Wuji revealed a thousand-watt smile when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “If you’re ready, we can head over to the central arena now.”

Huang Xiaolong stared indifferently at Jiang Wuji’s smiling face. “Was Forefather Jiang afraid that I would choose to run away? Is there a need to summon so many experts to surround my residence?”

Shaking his hand hastily, Jiang Wuji chuckled, “There’s no such thing! Your Highness’s safety is of the utmost priority, and I was afraid some people would carry out a sneak attack on you. I only deployed my men to protect Your Highness, and I never thought that you would misunderstand... This old man didn’t think things through....”

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to bother with Jiang Wuji, and he quickly dismissed the matter. With Feng Tianyu and four guardians, he left the courtyard.

The smile on Jiang Wuji’s face stiffened, and he turned to follow behind Huang Xiaolong. They left the Jiang Family’s headquarters as they headed towards the central arena.

A never-ending crowd filled the streets as they made their way to the arena, and soldiers of the Central Holy Dynasty lined the streets along with experts of various sects.

Due to the presence of the guardians, no one dared to behave out of line, and everyone moved about in an orderly manner.

The moment Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Wuji appeared, chaos broke out along the streets.

Various experts pointed at Huang Xiaolong and cussed him out while they mocked him for being unaware of his own strength.

Looking at the crowd before him, Huang Xiaolong turned to Jiang Wuji and said, “Your Jiang Family is pretty good at broadcasting information....” Huang Xiaolong would rather be beaten to death than to believe that the Jiang Family had nothing to do with this.

Jiang Wuji chuckled, “The head of the families present should be the ones to leak the news. I had nothing to do with it.”

Huang Xiaolong laughed coldly in his mind when he saw how Jiang Wuji was trying to push all the responsibilities away. Soon, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the central arena as he rode on the back of the Golden Pig Treasure.

The central arena wasn’t too far away from the Central Holy Dynasty’s imperial palace, it was erected in the middle of massive training grounds. Stone plaques lined the training grounds, and every single one of them recorded down legendary battles that had taken place in the central arena.

In order to battle in the central arena, one had to obtain permission from the emperor of the Central Holy Dynasty. Due to the importance of the arena and the legacies it laid down, it was a sacred land. Of course, that only applied to ordinary warriors. With the identities of Huang Xiaolong and Yang Rong, they didn’t need to apply for permission.

No matter the outcome, a battle in the central arena was an honor one could wear for a lifetime. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A golden plaque lay close to the central arena, and it was several tens of thousands of feet tall. It was crafted with spiritual jade stone and metal essence where the names of the winners would be carved onto.

Anyone who won would have their name carved into the golden plaque by the emperor himself, giving them endless glory. Of course, that only applied to ordinary cultivators. As Holy Princes, Huang Xiaolong and Yang Rong could care less.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, Jiang Tian, Tan Hongyi, Yang Rong, and the rest were already present.

“Brother Huang Xiaolong, did you sleep well?” Yang Rong snickered, and those who didn’t know would mistake them for best friends.

“Of course not. I was thinking of different ways to kill you today. I wonder what’s the most enjoyable way to end your life.... No matter how I think about it, I can’t seem to think of a good one. Why don’t you give me a suggestion on how you want to die?”

Yang Rong’s expression sank when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. Killing intent burst out from his eyes, and he raged, “Hehe! Huang Xiaolong, there is no need to trouble yourself. In fact, you’ll soon learn of the most enjoyable way to die!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly.

Staring at the four guardians behind Huang Xiaolong, Yang Rong stepped into the void before him and leaped onto the arena. “Huang Xiaolong, get up here and face your death!”

Unlike Yang Rong’s flashy way of jumping onto the arena, Huang Xiaolong walked up without much fanfare.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had entered the arena, Jiang Tian, Jiang Wuji, and the others heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts as a sinister smile formed on their faces.

“Huang Xiaolong, die!” Yang Rong didn’t waste any time as his figure blurred the moment Huang Xiaolong appeared. He was itching to attack as he sent a punch flying towards Huang Xiaolong in an instant.
