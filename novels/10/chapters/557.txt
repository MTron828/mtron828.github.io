In the end, no one was brave enough to challenge Huang Xiaolong again.

Huang Xiaolong’s place within the top ten ranks was set in stone.

However, the fact that no one dared to challenge Huang Xiaolong did not mean that no one dared to challenge the other nine of the top ten disciples.

“Deng Lei wishes to challenge Yang Yue!”

A challenger disciple named Deng Lei stepped up to the stage, challenging one of the top ten, Yang Yue. This new challenge roused quite a reaction from the spectating crowd of disciples, for Deng Lei had some reputation due to his strength, despite being a late-First Order God Realm. Also, he came in second after Xie Ning in the term before the previous new disciple selection assessment.

Unexpected for everyone, Deng Lei too failed in his challenge against Yang Yue.

Needless to say, although Yang Yue managed to fend off Deng Lei, his win did not come as easy as Huang Xiaolong’s did. His was a bitter battle over his challenger before coming out on top.

After Deng Lei, many more challengers appeared for the top ten ranking disciples in succession. Such as Long Junfei, Su Guo, Xu Shaoqing, Wu Xiaoshi, and the rest. Xu Shaoqing’s challenger succeeded, throwing Xu Shaoqing out of the top ten ranks. She was replaced by a disciple named Fang Qun. Though challenges were issued one after another, none dared to point the spear at Gudu Leng or Wang Biaoyuan.

More than an hour later, the top ten name list was finally determined. According to the rules, once the top ten were determined, next came the battle for the first place.

These ten names weren’t named like it was previously done. Instead, Gudu Leng, Wang Biaoyuan, Huang Xiaolong, and the rest of the top ten who felt that they had the qualifications to take the first place were to walk up the stage and accept the challenge from the remaining nine people.

But, no one made a move after Zhang Tianchuan finished speaking, surrounded by silence. Everyone knew that being the first one to go up was a thankless job, having to accept all nine people’s challenges.

A light flickered in Gudu Leng’s eyes just as he prepared to go up the arena stage when a shadow flashed before his eyes, landing on the stage center.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

Gasps were heard all around.

Yes, the first person who went up the Hidden Dragon Arena stage was Huang Xiaolong. Watching that figure standing at the center of the stage, most people were momentarily stunned. Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan both were no exception.

No one expected Huang Xiaolong to act so decisively, showing his edge—being the first person up, challenging all nine others.

‘This punk thinks he’s number one just because he won over Xie Ning!’ Wang Biaoyuan sneered inwardly, although it was out of his and most people’s expectations that Huang Xiaolong was able to defeat Xie Ning, that victory didn’t mean anything in Wang Biaoyuan’s eyes. With his current strength, he could easily crush a peak late-First Order God Realm like Xie Ning to death with half a move.

The gap between a Second Order and a First Order were poles apart.

Landing on the Hidden Dragon Arena stage while ignoring the whispers and astounded expressions, Huang Xiaolong’s swept over Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan, speaking as if he was talking about the fine weather, “I proclaim myself as the first place holder, who wants to challenge me?”

The noisy crowd quieted at his words and the focus fell on the nine remaining top ten rankers, especially Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan.

“How is it? No one dares to come up?” After a while, seeing no one make any move, Huang Xiaolong casually ‘nudged’ them.

A sharp glint exploded in Wang Biaoyuan’s eyes, but when he was about to leap out, a silhouette had already landed in front of Huang Xiaolong.

“Luo Kai!” When everyone saw the challenger’s face, the crowd clamored.

Luo Kai—first place in the new disciple selection assessment three terms ago, it was acknowledged that his strength qualified him a spot within the top five, but the majority secretly felt that only Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan could be Huang Xiaolong’s opponents.

Luo Kai going up to challenge Huang Xiaolong, wasn’t that the same as seeking death?

Seeing that it was Luo Kai who came to challenge him, Huang Xiaolong was also surprised.

Luo Kai remained calm despite the less than encouraging words coming from below the stage, his eyes were ablaze with fighting spirit as he said, “Huang Xiaolong, I admit you are indeed very strong, even Xie Ning is not your opponent. But today, I will fight you, and defeat you!” A powerful momentum exploded from Luo Kai’s body, matching the flames in his eyes.

As Luo Kai’s momentum rose, the entire stage seemed to quake under pressure. This brought another wave of shock, because...

“Second Order God Realm!”

“Oh heavens, Luo Kai has actually broke through Second Order God Realm!”

Shock, disbelief, and surprise filled the arena.

Those who had thought that Luo Kai was merely seeking death in challenging Huang Xiaolong were forced to swallow their words.

Upon reaching the God Realm, each small advance was difficult. With each advance one’s strength would double, and from peak late-First Order to Second Order it was much more than a simple strength enhancement.

A peak late-First Order God Realm was still a First Order, whereas a Second Order, even a mere early Second Order, had left any First Order God Realm in the dust. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong was able to defeat the peak late-First Order Xie Ning, but could he defeat the Second Order Luo Kai?

No one could say for sure.

Gudu Leng, Wang Biaoyuan, and the others were also blindsided by Luo Kai, none of them expected that in this outer disciples assessment there would be another Second Order God Realm other than the two of them. This Luo Kai really hid too deeply, pulling the wool over everyone’s eyes. No wonder he dared to challenge Huang Xiaolong.

On the platform, surprise flickered in Zhang Tianchuan’s eyes, this Luo Kai had broken through to Second Order!

Standing opposite of Luo Kai, Huang Xiaolong looked unperturbed by the surge of momentum released by Luo Kai. Second Order God Realm? No wonder he was so confident, declaring that he would defeat Huang Xiaolong.

When Luo Kai’s aura rose to the peak, it stopped. Feeling the changes in the surrounding disciples, he looked across at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Huang Xiaolong, make your move. To show my respect for the Institute Principal, I’ll let you make the first move.” A hint of conceit flitted in his eyes.

To show my respect for the Institute Principal, I’ll let you make the first move? The surrounding disciples gasped in shock, then became excited! Luo Kai was arrogant, but they liked it!

Some disciples even began to cheer Luo Kai on loudly.

“Are you sure you want to let me go first?” Huang Xiaolong asked with a hint of ambiguous smile hanging on his lips.

“That’s right.” Luo Kai nodded with confidence.

The instant Luo Kai said so, Huang Xiaolong made his move. In a flicker, he already narrowed the distance between him and Luo Kai, then a fist punched out. No superfluous movements, not even a tiny energy fluctuation was detected.

Luo Kai was startled. In a panic, he raised his own fist to meet Huang Xiaolong’s fist resulting in two fists collision. At that precise moment, Luo Kai went deathly pale. His conceit, pride, and arrogance from earlier were shattered by Huang Xiaolong’s fist, giving birth to indescribable fear and horror.

A thunderous blast resounded, followed by a tragic wail as the silhouette of a person was sent flying in the air, slamming down below the Hidden Dragon Arena. A loud thud was heard, raising a curtain of dust in the air.

The disciples cheering on Luo Kai stiffened, the excitement vanished from their faces, replaced with bewilderment and daze.

Did Luo Kai really broke through to Second Order God Realm?

A Second Order God Realm’s battle ended just like that?

It still ended with one move!

Gazes moved to the figure lying below the Hidden Dragon Arena stage, unsure if Luo Kai was still alive or otherwise. Sharps gasps could be heard, the disciples that were cheering for Luo Kai moments ago were trembling uncontrollably.

Both Gudu Leng and Wang Biaoyuan’s faces twitched.
