Chapter 2145: One Person Shakes One Country

“Form the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array!” The Heavenly Saint Country’s Marshal Lan Shifan immediately hollered an order, directing the Heavenly Saint Country’s generals and experts.

Zhu Xinyi and the others acted swiftly at the drop of Marshal Lan Shifan’s order. In the blink of an eye, the generals and experts got into positions, forming the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array. Their powers synchronized with each other. At the center of the grand array, a surreal golden phantom emerged. Though the phantom was slightly vague, it exuded a majestic might.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely astonished.

...This is?

The Heavenly Saint Ruler spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, I obtained this Grand Heavenly Venerable Array years ago. It is a grand array created by a Venerable Realm master. This grand array formed by my Heavenly Saint Country’s experts is more than sufficient to kill an ordinary early Tenth Order Sovereign. There’s still time for you to retreat now!”

It’s sufficient to kill an ordinary early Tenth Order Sovereign!

The little cow, King of Grandmist, and the others also showed astonished expressions on their faces.

Despite his astonishment, Huang Xiaolong watched curiously. An array formation created by a Venerable Realm master? Was this the trump card the Heavenly Saint Country relied on? No wonder the Heavenly Saint Ruler dared to say that he would behead him.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed. “I am looking forward to experiencing how powerful an array formation created by a Venerable Realm master is.”

Huang Xiaolong admitted the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array seemed potent. However, it did not escape his eyes that it was extremely taxing for the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts to maintain the array formation, not to mention that it consumed these people’s Sovereign force at a rapid pace. At one point, this consumption would even affect their cultivation foundation.

Therefore, the Heavenly Saint Ruler was still a little worried using the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have tried to reason with Huang Xiaolong to persuade him to leave.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler’s face sank immediately, hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words. A frigid cold light exploded from his eyes as he spoke through gritted teeth, “Very good, Huang Xiaolong, you asked for it!” After throwing that sentence, he leaped into the center position of the array.

Blinding rays exploded from the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s body, and waves of golden scarlet rays rushed into the array. With the addition of the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s power, the entire array shone even brighter, emitting rings of golden light. These golden rings of light rose to the sky above, stirring the chaos qi in the highest part of the atmosphere. The surrounding chaos qi turned turbulent, whistling loudly.

The little cow, King of Grandmist, and the others were forced back over ten billion miles by the overwhelming power coming from the array formation, yet they could still feel tremendous pressure descending on them.

Huang Xiaolong stood tall like an eternal divine mountain, not budging an inch. He was entirely shrouded in intertwining black light and radiance white light. No matter how overwhelming the pressure from the array was, Huang Xiaolong remained steadfast akin to an imperishable existence.

His three saint bloodlines’ power emerged on the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s skin, expanding into three different protective boundaries.

Archdevils, divine dragons, and golden Buddhas swirled.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler and Marshal Lan Shifan both narrowed their eyes at Huang Xiaolong’s rising momentum.

“Attack—!!”

“Immortal Venerable!” The Heavenly Saint Ruler, Marshal Lan Shifan, and the others shouted in unison.

The surrounding origin energy rushed frantically towards the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array, gathering at its center. The golden phantom became more solid and bigger, exuding a world-shaking might.

“Extinguish the Mundane World!” Following the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s thunderous bellow, energy burst out from his body. The golden phantom’s palms slapped down on Huang Xiaolong. Sacred light glowed from the golden phantom’s palms, distinguishing him from the mundane world.

The world seemed smaller under the golden phantom’s palms, and Huang Xiaolong was nothing but a speck of dust.

Looking at the two giant golden palms falling down on him, Huang Xiaolong bellowed. Thousands of archdevils, divine dragons, golden Buddhas flew upwards as the heart of hell emitted glaring blacklight. Darkness roiled up as the blacklight from Huang Xiaolong’s body rose to the ninth heavens. Vigorous chaos qi swirled turbulently as the wind whistled in everyone’s ears.

Huang Xiaolong punched towards the giant golden palms with his fists, countering the attack head-on.

Fist force tore space, whizzing through time and everything in the world seemed to slow down. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A prism of colors representing elements of wind, earth, water, fire, wood, white radiance, black darkness, and golden luminance intensified.

Rumble~!

A world-shaking blast thundered the instant Huang Xiaolong’s fists collided with the golden palms. The ground below shifted, abyssal cracks appeared, while some part of the ground rose high like tidal waves. Horrifying destructive power mutilated everything within a one million miles radius of the Heavens Path. The ground over a million miles away was rumbling with violent winds howling past it.

Ten million miles away, the King of Grandmist, and the others retreated in a panic upon seeing billowing clouds of destructive aftershock racing towards them. The destructive aftershock quickly caught up with them, jostling them back over and over again.

Fortunately, Huang Xiaolong directed a large amount of the aftershock waves elsewhere. Hence, despite being roughly jostled around, the King of Grandmist and the others weren’t injured.

Huang Xiaolong himself retreated more than ten thousand li from the impact.

The colorful lights enshrouding Huang Xiaolong flickered unsteadily as streaks of lightning whipped across the air, dragons roared and, radiance and darkness energy expanded outwards rapidly.

Huang Xiaolong seemed to be the reincarnation of the ancient lightning god, hell’s supreme devil, the lord of radiance, the sovereign of dragons.

The Heavenly Saint Country’s group, too, was thrown far back.

After the collision, Huang Xiaolong chuckled and disappeared into a blur. In the next second, he appeared right above the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts, and his fists punched down like a meteor shower without a word.

Huang Xiaolong’s fists force also contained the power of seven chaos lightnings that condensed into two swirling pillars that slammed onto the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array.

Both the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Marshal Lan Shifan were shocked.

“The Venerable Holding Up the Heavens!” Both yelled at the same time. The Heavenly Saint Ruler exerted his full force, slapping his palms towards Huang Xiaolong’s seven-colored chaos lightning pillars.

Rumble—!

Upon impact, Huang Xiaolong staggered back, but he immediately leaped forth in attack once again.

Under Huang Xiaolong’s relentless attacks, the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array formed by the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts began to crack. The golden phantom at the center begun to dim, threatening to vanish.

In the far distance, the little cow, King of Grandmist, and the others were awestruck watching Huang Xiaolong’s actions. This was literally one person shaking one country ah!

One person was suppressing one of the top five heavenly countries in the Heavens Path!

There were terror and fear written on the Heavenly Saint Ruler’s face. How is this possible?!

How can Huang Xiaolong be so strong? Someone who hasn’t stepped into the high-level Sovereign Realm is actually undermining the force of the entire Heavenly Saint Country!

When he had fought Huang Xiaolong earlier, had Huang Xiaolong not used his full force?

Is this Huang Xiaolong’s true combat power?!

The heart of hell! Five devil steles! Sixteen radiance wings! Seven chaos lightning pools!

Huang Xiaolong actually has seven chaos lightning pools! This...!

The Heavenly Saint Ruler was beyond shocked.

This truth was a great blow to Lan Shifan and the other experts as well.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong suddenly stopped attacking.

Heavenly Saint Country’s group heaved in relief when they saw that Huang Xiaolong, who had been attacking them like a madman, had finally stopped attacking. But precisely at this point, they noticed a lightning bead hovering above Huang Xiaolong’s head!

It contained earth-colored lightning.

Sensing the terrifying energy swirling inside the lightning bead, the Heavenly Saint Country’s people all turned deathly pale. However, before any of them had time to utter a word, Huang Xiaolong threw out the lightning bead and shouted, “Go!”

The lightning bead immediately released a sea of lightning, falling down on the Heavenly Saint Country’s group.

Boom!

When the lightning bead’s sea of lightning hit the Grand Heavenly Venerable Array light barrier, the Array completely shattered, and the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts forming the array were sent flying in various directions. The Heavenly Saint Ruler and Lan Shifan crashed heavily to the ground.
