Chapter 3640 – Mei Jie’s Son

“Mei Jie’s son?!” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

He asked them to take note of matters regarding the Zhu Family and Mei Jie, but he didn’t expect them to be so efficient.

It had only been several million years, and Mei Jie got himself a son!

“Yes… Mei Jie’s son.” Zheng Shen continued, “We also learned that Mei Jie got married to Zhu Xinyi after he went to the Zhu Family. Their son is called Zhu Jian.”

“Zhu Jian?!” Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted. Wouldn’t that mean that Mei Jie had married into the Zhu Family?! What the f…

Yu Xiaohong continued, “Zhu Jian has exceptional talent. He inherited supreme bloodlines from both Mei Jie and the Zhu Family. He has already reached the high-level Dao Venerable Realm after several million years of cultivation! Moreover, Mei Jie broke through to the peak of the grand completion stage. He’s the second strongest experty after Zhu Chen now! From what it seems, he’s as important as Zhu Ji in the Zhu Family!”

“Mei Jie, Zhu Xinyi, Zhu Jian…” Huang Xiaolong slowly got to his feet. After some time, a smile formed on his face and he asked, “When will the Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce be auctioning off the items?”

“Three days later.” Yu Xiaohong replied.

Next, he asked about several matters regarding the auction.

“Alright, all of you can return now.” Huang Xiaolong said after he learned what he wanted to know. Picking up the sword manual, he sent them away.

At dawn the very next day, Yu Xiaohong handed over an invitation to the auction.

Huang Xiaolong brought Tao Hang along with him and they quickly left for the auction.

The Green Spiritual Chamber of Commerce chose to hold their auction in the Stoneless Celestial Empire, and it was pretty close to the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. Even so, that was relative to Huang Xiaolong. He needed a single day to arrive and he chose to leave Yu Xiaohong and the others behind. Whatever the case, she needed to deal with matters regarding the celestial empire.

There were several God of Creation Realm experts who were familiar with the area in the group on board the Universe Boat.

When they finally arrived, the entire venue had already been prepared. The Stoneless Celestial Empire might be weaker than the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, but their ancestor was a half step Universe God. He was quite the figure in the Zhu Lan Land and his celestial empire wasn’t too shabby.

“Lord, should I look for a place to stay? After all, the auction is tomorrow.” Cao Dehong asked. He was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, and his Cao Family was located in the Stoneless City.

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

A look of joy formed on his face when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s response. He quickly led the way over to his residence.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, he noticed that the Cao Family seemed to be celebrating something. The decorations weren't there to welcome Cao Dehong. When he asked around, he realized that the patriarch of the Cao Family, Cao Kezhang, was preparing to welcome a very important guest!

With Mei Jie’s status in the Zhu Family, Zhu Jian’s importance in the Zhu Lan Land couldn’t be underestimated.

When Cai Kezhang learned that Zhu Jian was going to attend the auction, he quickly spoke to the God of Creation Realm experts around Zhu Jian to invite him to stay in the Cao Family Manor for a single day.

Who would have thought that Zhu Jian would agree?!

Cao Kezhang was so happy that almost personally went out to buy the decorations for the manor.

The members of the Cao Family were waiting outside the manor to welcome Zhu Jian, but they were nowhere to be seen.

All of a sudden, several dozen figures appeared on the streets. Jumping with joy, Cao Kezhang yelled, “Young Master Zhu Jian is here!”

The experts of the Cao Family quickly went up to the group.

“Brother Zhu Yun!” Cao Kezhang noticed his friend the moment he went up. When he greeted everyone he knew, he turned to Zhu Jian and started kissing his ass. “Young Master Zhu Jian’s arrival brightens up my Cao Family Manor! I heard that Brother Zhu Jian likes the Mei Zi Wine, and I got my men to prepare them.”

The wine was specially made by a half step Universe God called Mei Zi. Her strength was comparable to Yu Xiaohong and she was also a top beauty in the Unknown Space. A single jar would cost a billion dao coins, and one might not be able to buy it even if they had the money! In order to get a single jar, Cao Kezhang used quite a bit of effort.

Casually glancing at Cao Kezhang, Zhu Jian asked, “How many jars did you manage to get?”

An embarrassed expression appeared on his face and he stuttered, “This… Young Master Zhu Jian knows how precious the wine is. I only managed to get a single jar…”

Before he could finish, he was interrupted. “Heh, I won’t even be able to fill the gaps of my teeth with a single jar. Do you really think that I’ll appreciate your gesture when you can only get a single jar of wine?”

Cao Kezhang’s expression changed and he explained hastily, “Young Master Zhu Jian, that’s not what I meant!” He quickly looked at Zhu Yun to ask for assistance.

Zhu Yun turned to Zhu Jian and muttered, “Young Master, it’s extremely difficult to get a single jar of Mei Zi Wine. Cao Kezhang is only trying to show his appreciation for you and there’s nothing to fuss over.”

Ignoring Cao Kezhang, Zhu Lan entered the manor. However, a pretty lady in the crowd caught his eye when he was walking through the entrance. He turned to Cao Kezhang and sneered, “She shall pour my wine.”

Cao Kezhang’s expression sank slightly. The lady he pointed at was his daughter, Cao Ying. He would celebrate if his daughter caught Zhu Jian’s eye previously, but she was already engaged to the young master of the Chen Family in the Stoneless Celestial Empire. The reputation of the Cao Family would be dragged through the mud if they allowed her to serve another man.

The Chen Family might not dare to do a thing to the Zhu Family, but they were more than capable of smashing the Cao Family to bits! It wasn’t as though Zhu Jian wanted her as his bride, and there was nothing in it for the Cao Family!

Cao Ying’s expression changed when she heard what Zhu Jian said,

Noticing Cao Kezhang’s face, Zhu Jian sneered, “What’s the problem? Are you not willing to let her do it?”

Explaining in haste, Cao Kezhang tried to diffuse the situation. “No… No. That’s not it. Young Master Zhu Jian, she got engaged with the young master of the Chen Family several days ago. There are other beauties in my Cao Family, and I’ll get them to serve you!”

A slap landed on Cao Kezhang’s face when Zhu Jian heard what he said. The resounding clap rang through the skies and it was followed by a snort from Zhu Jian. “What are you trying to say?! Do I look like a pervert to you?!”

“No… No…”

“She’ll serve me later. That’s it.” Zhu Jian declared before walking into the manor.
