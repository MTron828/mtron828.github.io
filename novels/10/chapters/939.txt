“That’s true, this is a great chance to kill him, we must not let him escape. If he manages to flee, where would we find him then? Killing him would be a thousand times harder!”

“Based on his devilish talent, he would be unmatched in a short few decades!”

All Grand Elders clamored to get rid of Huang Xiaolong as soon as possible.

The extent of Huang Xiaolong’ talent had planted a seed of fear in these Grand Elders’ hearts, and it was germinating at a rapid speed.

The Fortune Gate Chief Wang Yu stood up, a frenzied murderous aura bursting out from his body as he issued an immediate order, all Fortune Gate Grand Elders were to depart to the Divine Dan City with him.

...

Silvery moonlight shone down on the calm and quiet night.

Huang Xiaolong was standing in his yard, pondering about the Sacred Dan Temple.

Initially, he planned to challenge the Sacred Dan Temple tomorrow but changed his mind afterwards.

According to what his Master the Ascending Moon Old Man told him before, a Seventh Order Highgod Realm could merely pass the first section of the Sacred Dan Temple trial. Even though Huang Xiaolong was confident in his strength, he wasn’t so sure about the fifth section of the trial.

The last section of the Sacred Dan Temple most likely required the strength of a late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm to clear, which was why Huang Xiaolong decided to cultivate in the Dan River first, starting tomorrow.

With his current peak early-Seventh Order Highgod Realm cultivation, borrowing the accumulated medicinal energy in the Dan River would help him to break through to mid-Seventh Order Highgod Realm at the very least, which would give him a higher chance of passing the trial.

However, the reason for the frown on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead right now was Li Lu.

It had been over ten hours since the Grand Competition ended. During this time, he found out that Li Lu was the Fortune Gate Ancestor’s personal disciple!

Whilst Huang Xiaolong was contemplating about Li Lu, all of a sudden, in a certain corner, space rippled as a young woman clad fully in white appeared.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned, then joy rushed to his face: “Li Lu!”

The night visitor was naturally Li Lu!

Because the Sun Moon Residence was blasted into dust in his fight with the Ghost Refining Sect young man, Huang Xiaolong was currently staying in an independent courtyard inside a large inn.

He didn’t expect she would be able to find him, nor that would come to find him. Overexcited, Huang Xiaolong crossed the distance between them in a few large strides, reached out and held Li Lu’s hands.

Li Lu struggled for a while to pull her hands out of Huang Xiaolong’s grip to no avail.

He let out a low chuckle at her effort, looking a little silly, “I was right, your memories already came back, you do recognize me!”

Looking at the silly smiling face in front of her, the cold and tightly sealed door in Li Lu’s heart loosened, sighing, “The reason I came today is because of the matter between you and the Fortune Gate.”

Huang Xiaolong did not interrupt her, waiting for her to continue.

Li Lu hesitated then said, “I only just found out what happened between you and Fortune Gate. Can you put this matter down and spare the Fortune Gate?”

Spare the Fortune Gate?

Huang Xiaolong heavily sighed in his heart, his voice solemn, “Others, I can spare, but Sun Yi and Wang Yu, these two must die!” Huang Xiaolong somehow felt he owed Li Lu a lot in the past years, however, this was also his biggest concession.

After all, his original plan was to kill Sun Yi first, then exterminate the Fortune Gate.

Li Lu fell into silence, knowing this was Huang Xiaolong’s bottom line. After a minute or so of silence, her cherry lips moved, “Thank you.” With that said, she turned to leave.

Huang Xiaolong tightened his grip, looking at Li Lu with deep affection, “You really can’t stay? In fact, Xiaofei knows about you and hopes I could find you. She hopes to be good sisters with you.”

Good sisters!

The meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words was obvious enough.

A trace of panic flashed across Li Lu’s eyes, shyness and inexplicable happiness mingled together. Still, she shook her head, “I only want to concentrate on my cultivation right now, other matters can be discussed later.”

Discussed later?

Needless to say, Huang Xiaolong was dejected, but the latter part of Li Lu’s words meant that there would be a chance in the future.

“I haven’t seen you in so many years, I want to see what you look like now.” Huang Xiaolong no longer insisted, changing the subject.

Even now, she was wearing a thin veil that covered her entire face. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Lu was reluctant. She hesitated briefly before taking off her veil, revealing an alluring face that could bring ruin upon a kingdom.

Compared to the time she was still in Martial Spirit World, Li Lu’s features actually didn’t change much. But now, there was a hint of maturity on her beautiful face, a tranquil quality, and also a hint of sorrow in her eyes that aroused others’ pity.

At the receiving end of Huang Xiaolong’s feverish gaze, a touch of red colored her cheeks. Unable to bear it any more, Li Lu turned her face to the side, putting her veil on again. In a flicker, she disappeared right before Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong stood dazed on the spot, feeling lost.

A while later, he let out a sigh.

As moonlight dimmed, the morning light peeked out from the east.

Huang Xiaolong sat all night in his yard. When morning came, he left the inn, walking towards the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

Because the inn he stayed at was on the same street at the union headquarters, he was already walking through the entrance in a short few minutes.

Waiting for Huang Xiaolong were two Eminent Elders, Chen Man and Zhang Xinchen.

Huang Xiaolong’s arrival was warmly welcomed by the two Eminent Elders.

“Young hero Huang wants to enter the Dan River to cultivate?” It was a little unexpected for Chen Man and Zhang Xinchen that to hear that Huang Xiaolong planned to cultivate in the Dan River before taking on the Sacred Dan Temple trial.

Everyone assumed he would be taking the trial today.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “May I enter the Dan River to cultivate now?”

Chen Man was quick to compose himself, smiling as he said, “Young hero Huang is joking, you’ve won the first place in the grand competition, you can enter the Dan River anytime you like. We’ll lead you over to the back mountain now.”

With that said, Chen Man and Zhang Xinchen led Huang Xiaolong through the Union’s corridors and buildings, arriving at the back mountain a while later.

Upon arriving at their destination, Huang Xiaolong saw a river several hundred li in length and a few hundred meters wide. Right above the water surface, the medicinal energy accumulated within actually formed qi dragons!

Each of these dragons had obviously given birth to their own intelligence!

Not to mention the fact that they were no soft persimmons. The weakest one had strength equivalent to a First Order Highgod Realm master, and there were also dragons with Fourth Order, Fifth Order, Sixth Order, even Seventh Order Highgod Realm strength!

Huang Xiaolong was secretly smacking his lips.

Such splendiferous amount of pill qi, how long of an accumulation did it take to form these qi dragons?

Zhang Xinchen pointed at the river in front of them, explaining to Huang Xiaolong, “This is the Dan River. After young hero Huang enters the river, you must be careful. Although with young hero Huang’s strength you might not be wary of these qi dragons, they have given birth to intelligence after all. They can form a battle array to attack. Moreover, their intelligence has begun merging with the Dan River itself, hence being extremely hard to kill.”

Chen Man and Zhang Xinchen subsequently informed Huang Xiaolong about things he needed to look out for in detail.

Although winning the grand competition gave Huang Xiaolong a chance to cultivate in the Dan River, it was limited to a one-time entry. Therefore, Chen Man and Zhang Xinchen advised him to use this chance to the fullest.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, indicating he had remembered everything, then the two Elders simultaneously opened a door through the restrictions. In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong flew in, arriving above the river water.

He had just appeared, but those qi dragons flew towards him like a moth to a flame, attacking Huang Xiaolong from every angle.
