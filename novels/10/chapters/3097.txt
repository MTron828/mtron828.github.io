Chapter 3098: Cripple Yourself.

As they made their way over, a couple sat in the main palace of the Limitless City as they chatted happily with each other.

The young man was handsome, and the young lady’s appearance wasn’t lesser than Feng Yuxuan.

“It’s been so long! Junior Sister Wangu grew even more beautiful.” The young man chuckled. “If it were up to me, Junior Sister Wangu would be the prettiest lady in the Origin Holy World!”

The young lady in question was one of the five greatest beauties in the Origin Holy World, Wangu Qinger!

She was the daughter of Wangu Xu, and she was pampered by everyone around her. She was even more famous than the Wind Rain Princess, Feng Yuxuan!

The number of suitors she had could probably circle around several regions.

Hearing the young man’s praise, Wangu Qinger couldn’t help but pout coyly, “Senior Brother Xu Minghua, please stop making fun of me! After so many years, you should be even stronger than before, right?”

Xu Minghua chuckled, “I’ve comprehended the power of absolute frost during my seclusion…” Even though he tried to play it down, anyone could see the haughty look on his face.

Wangu Qinger gasped in shock before revealing a pleasant smile, “Congratulations, Senior Brother Xu. Now that you have comprehended the power of absolute frost, you can control three absolute powers. With Senior Brother Xu’s talent, you will definitely be able to rank in the top three spots in the Heaven Fate List!

“Xiao Yuncheng is far from your match!”

Xu Minghua burst into laughter when he heard what Wangu Qinger said.

Xu Minghua was the personal disciple of San Song of the Mystical Pavilion, and he was the only disciple of the old man! Now that Lord San Song had left seclusion, Xu Minghua had followed him out of the faction to gain some experience.

As the two of them enjoyed their chat, two female disciples of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch approached and kneeled on the ground before Wangu Qinger. “Young lady, the Ice Spirit Fortune Fox has escaped!”

“What?!” Wangu Qinger flew into a rage the moment she heard the report. “How dare you allow it to escape? I allowed you to look after it, and you couldn’t even take care of something so simple! Useless fools!” Waving her hand once, a burst of ice energy emerged and sent the two female disciples flying. Fresh blood leaked from their lips.

Despite their injuries, the disciples didn’t dare to get to their feet. They remained where they landed and kneeled with their faces to the ground.

It was no wonder Wangu Qinger would be angry. She had always been searching for a suitable mount, and the Ice Spirit Fortune Fox was something she had managed to locate after spending a large amount of effort!

It was a beast of creation, and it had a special type of bloodline that allowed it to comprehend the power of absolute frost easily. With her ice-attributed dao physique, the beast was perfect as her mount!

After obtaining the beast as her mount, she had been treating it extremely well!

However, beasts of creation were creatures that were extremely hard to tame. At the end of the day, Wangu Qinger was unable to gain its recognition, and she had no choice but to trap it in a special space made for it. After leaving it alone for some time, the disciples who were in charge of guarding the space had the gall to allow it to escape!

Xu Minghua couldn't help but widen his eyes in shock when he heard the news. The Ice Spirit Fortune Fox was a beast that was extremely rarely seen. He knew that since the start of time, only two Ice Spirit Fortune Foxes had appeared in the Origin Holy World!

“Junior Sister Qinger, what’s going on?”

Wangu Qinger explained everything to him before turning to the two disciples. “Do you know which direction it ran in?”

“It ran in the southeastern direction!” They didn’t dare to hide anything from their young lady, and they quickly told her everything they knew.

Wangu Qinger turned to look at Xu Minghua all of a sudden, “Senior Brother Minghua, I’ll have to bring some disciples to hunt down my mount again. Do you…”

“I’ll tag along. After all, anything that concerns you is my problem too.”

A smile appeared on Wangu Qinger’s face. If an expert at Xu Minghua’s level was willing to help her, things would go much smoother.

It didn’t take long for the two of them to lead a bunch of experts in the southeastern direction.

They left the Limitless City and flew towards the Limitless Mountain Range in the distance.

When they left, Huang Xiaolong and his party were heading straight towards the city. Amidst their laughter, they saw an icy blue light shooting towards them.

At their level, a creature like the Ice Spirit Fortune Fox wasn’t capable of eluding their senses.

When they focused on it, they saw an adorable-looking twelve-tailed fox flying towards them. Icy qi would emerge from its body, and it left behind a frosty blue trail wherever it went.

“That’s an Ice Spirit Fortune Fox!” Lei Yu exclaimed in shock. “It has a fully awakened bloodline, and it had even managed to comprehend the power of absolute frost!”

All of them there were peak-level experts, and they noticed as much.

“This little fox is pretty cute.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Even though the Ice Spirit Fortune Fox was a rare creature, Huang Xiaolong didn’t really care about it. After all, he was the master of the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin in the Divine Tuo Holy World. The fox couldn’t even compare to them, much less the terrifying three-headed beast he was riding on.

When the fox noticed a group of people in its way, it opened its mouth to send out a beam of icy qi.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chortle in amusement, “It’s so cute, but its temper could be better…”

All of them snickered under their breath when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Raising his feet, Lei Yu summoned a bunch of lightning qi that shattered the icy beam.

Jumping in fright when it felt the power of Lei Yu’s lightning qi, the little fox quickly turned around and fled in the other direction. However, Lei Yu’s strength wasn’t something it could shake off as it pleased. After all, the beast was still an existence who once ranked fifteenth on the Extermination List!

A miserable shriek left the lips of the little fox as it fell towards the ground.

Lei Yu had controlled his strength well. If he was a little careless, the fox would have been dead.

“Little Fortune!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A crisp voice rang through the air when the fox fell.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the source of the voice, and he saw Wangu Qinger’s group rushing towards them.

They arrived before the fox in an instant, and when she saw the sorry state the fox was in, a frosty expression formed on her face. She glared at Huang Xiaolong and snarled, “How dare you harm my mount?”

Lei Yu sneered in response, “Little lass, do you think we’re stupid? That little fox ran away from you! She attacked us first, and we only moved to protect ourselves.”

Wangu Qinger’s expression sank once again as she glared at Huang Xiaolong and friends. “I’m not going to waste my time with you. Whoever did it, cripple yourself.” It was clear she hadn’t seen Lei Yu striking the beast.

Lei Yu’s eyes widened in shock when he heard what she said. An expert on the Extermination List was being threatened by someone he could kill a million times over with a single stomp!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Old man, did you hear that? She wants you to cripple yourself!”

“I f*cking knew it! I should have let you guys do the dirty work!” Lei Yu ‘sighed’ in response.

“Were you the one who did it?!” Wangu Qinger glared at Lei Yu and growled.

“That’s right!” Lei Yu revealed a brilliant smile and continued, “So what if I did?”

Wangu Qinger looked at him and harrumphed in response, “You don’t have to cripple all four limbs. Just two will do.”
