Chapter 3222: Four Origin Divine Fires

“Master, do you know the reason why no one will ever be able to?”

“That’s because no one has the ability to refine the origin of the World of Departed Souls. Even someone who reached the peak of grand perfection level and has one foot in the God of Creation Realm will fail to do so! Even if they had several hundreds of millions of years, they would be unable to refine the world origin!”

“Did you forget that the restrictions will only remain open for several dozen years?!”

However, the old dragon seemed to have thought of something. “Unless…” He trailed off and he shook his head silently.

“Unless what?!” Huang Xiaolong asked eagerly.

“Unless one manages to obtain the four Origin Divine Fires in the universe.” The old dragon continued, “The divine fires went missing a long time ago, and it won’t be easy if anyone wishes to obtain them.”

“Four Origin Divine Fires?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“That’s right! The four Origin Divine Fires are born during the creation of the universe, and they seem to contain extraordinary power. With them, you will be able to refine anything in the universe! With the assistance of all four Origin Divine Fires, refining the world origin would be a lot easier!”

Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock, “The four Origin Divine Fires contain extraordinary power?” Could the fires in his body be the ones his master was talking about? If that was the case, why didn’t he notice their splendor in the past?

“That’s right! The four Origin Divine Fires are the strongest fire produced by the universe!”

“Master, have you seen them before in your life?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Shaking his head, the old dragon laughed, “How is that even possible? However, I know about them even without seeing it. The four Origin Divine Fires are called the White Tiger Divine Fire, Vermillion Bird Divine Fire, Black Tortoise Divine Fire, and the Azure Dragon Divine Fire.”

Huang Xiaolong nearly jumped in joy when he heard what the old man said.

THat would mean that the four fires burning in his body right now were most likely the four Origin Divine Fires!

However, why did they seem so damn weak?

Moreover, the four of them didn’t seem controllable. How would he be able to refine the world origin if he couldn’t even use them?

Huang Xiaolong continued to ask about the four Origin Divine Flame, and the old dragon told him everything he knew. Even though the old dragon found it funny that Huang Xiaolong was so concerned about the four Origin Divine Flame, he didn’t think too much about it. After all, he was the same when he first heard about them.

“Whatever the case, I hope that you will be able to locate Pangu’s axe in the future.” The old dragon turned serious all of a sudden.

“Pangu’s Axe?!” Huagn Xiaolong frowned.

“That’s right. Even though you have the Huang Long Armor Set left behind by your father, their strength can only be considered mid-tier at best among all the creation artifacts. It’s far too lacking when compared to Huang Sheng’s Dragon Blade. However, the Pangu Axe is different. It’s crafted using a piece of origin metal from the birth of the world. In terms of attacking prowess, it’s ranked at the top of the creation artifacts in the universe!”

Rank number one!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

He didn’t realize that the Pangu Axe in the legends he heard of on Earth to be the number one creation artifact in the entire universe!

The old dragon continued, “Right now, you’re not even close to the God of Creation Realm. Huang Sheng wouldn’t dirty his hands by coming for you. However, things will definitely get messy when you enter the God of Creation Realm. Like your father, he will definitely want to devour you and your bloodline. Even with three different types of cosmos energy, you won’t be Huang Sheng’s opponent when you just enter the God of Creation Realm.”

“Of course, everything will change if you obtain the Pangu Axe. When you enter the God of Creation Realm in the future, you will possess three different types of grand cosmos energy. With the assistance of the Pangu Axe, you might be able to survive getting hunted down by Huang Sheng.”

Huang Xiaolong growled, “Master, do you mean that the Pangu Axe is no longer with Pangu himself?”

“That’s right. When Pangu headed for the edge of the universe in the past, he left behind his axe. He inscribed his Pangu World Creation Art on it. Whoever obtains the axe will be able to inherit his mantle and control the Pangu World!”

“That’s also why I hope you can obtain the axe.”

Huang Xiaolong felt a storm raging in his heart.

He didn’t expect for there to be such a huge secret contained in the Pangu Axe.

Huang Xiaolong would be lying to himself if he said that he wasn’t tempted by the strongest creation artifact in the universe.

“However, the universe is large and no one knows the location of the Pangu Axe.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“No sh*t! However, I, your master, knows where the Pangu Axe might be located.” the old dragon snickered happily.

“What?!” A trace of excitement flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“When he left for the edge of the universe, he left it back in the Pangu World!”

No matter how excited Huang Xiaolong was, he could only shake his head helplessly. “Even if I know it’s in the Pangu World, it would be extremely hard to find!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Like the Blazing Dragon World, the Pangu World was extremely vast. Locating the Pangu Axe in the Pangu World would be like looking for a grain of sand in the ocean. However, the ocean was probably a quadrillion times bigger than any ocean he had stepped foot in before.

A smile formed on the old dragon’s face when he realized what Huang Xiaolong was thinking of. “In the past, your father was born in the Pangu World. He had been looking for it since a very long time ago, and he probably has some idea on where it could be.”

Huang Xiaolong felt his heart leaping in his chest.

However, his father was currently in Huang Sheng’s hand, and he wouldn't be able to meet the man anyway! How was he supposed to learn of the location of the Pangu Axe?

“Your father is trapped in a mysterious space. The old dragon spoke up all of a sudden. :”I am able to use some sort of secret art for you to speak to your father once. However, now is not the time. You are still too weak, and if you enter the space with your current strength, Huang Sheng will definitely find out!”

“Master, what are you suggesting?”

“When you reach the grand perfection level, we’ll talk.” The old dragon sighed. “There’s a universe treasure in the World of Departed Souls, and it’s called the Soul Burying Orb. It is able to hide the presence of anyone, and with it, you will be able to hide from Huang Sheng for a few minutes when you reach the grand perfection level.”

Soul Burying Orb!

Nodding solemnly, Huang Xiaolong made up his mind to look for the orb.

With the four Origin Divine Fires burning bright in him, Huang Xiaolong knew that looking for the orb would be a cakewalk if he managed to refine the world origin.

Several days later, the old dragon started to formally teach Huang Xiaolong the Blazing Dragon Grand Art.

As a grand art created by a God of Creation, it contained profound mysteries of the world. Even with Huang Xiaolong’s talent, he would need several hundred years to understand the basics! Only then would he be able to connect with the world origin of the Blazing Dragon World.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was starting to comprehend the grand art, the old dragon left him to his own devices. He sent Huang Xiaolong into secluded cultivation after reminding him to refine all the Flowers of Time he obtained.
