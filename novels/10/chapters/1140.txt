“A galaxy river that births chaos spiritual herbs?!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened in amazement.

If he could find such a river, wouldn’t that be like hitting the jackpot?

The little cow curled its lips, “That’s nothing, there are some rivers that give birth to chaos spiritual artifacts. Low-grade artifacts are common, and there’s a chance top-grade chaos spiritual artifacts will appear.”

Huang Xiaolong was stupefied, ‘Aren’t those galaxy rivers too heaven-defying?!’

“However, galaxy rivers rarely appear in the Divine World, I didn’t expect one to be sealed under this Great formation. It’s a pity that your strength is too low to take it out; that galaxy river is a priceless treasure, equivalent to one thousand, even ten thousand world surfaces!” The little cow spoke with a longing expression.

Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders, wanting to take that galaxy river was easier said than done. At his current strength, just taking out a single grain of Chaos Star Sand was already difficult, who knows how many grains there were inside the entire river.

He estimated that, even if all the Fortune Gate’s several ancestor level characters joined forces, they still wouldn’t be able to make that galaxy river budge a single inch.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s crestfallen face, the little cow comforted, “Don’t be disheartened, based on your current cultivation speed, you will have the strength to take out that galaxy river in a thousand years. With the Four Unlikes sealed in the outer hall of this Great Abyss of Ghosts, Gods, and Devils Formation, I suspect that Archdevil’s cultivation palace should be in the deepest part of the temple. A thousand years later when you’re strong enough to take away that galaxy river, we can explore further in.”

Huang Xiaolong sighed helplessly —one thousand years!

Clearly, his current strength was still too low. Even when there were treasures shining right in front of him, he was unable to take possession of them. There were just too many examples: the Nefarious Devil Tribe’s ancestral burial ground, the Ancestral Dragon Fruit on the Hundred Beasts Summit of the Blood Phoenix Forest, the sealed item in the belly of the Soul Islands’ Shredding Wind Mountain, and lastly, this Great Abyss of Ghosts, Gods, and Devils Formation.

Flying out from the valley, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow continued onward to the Blood Yang Mainland.

However, before leaving, he asked Xiaoniū to put up a formation that completely hid the valley from sight.

Three months later, the two of them arrived at the Blood Yang Mainland.

Faint blood-colored clouds loomed over the Blood Yang Mainland, seemingly blood yet not. During the day, these clouds emitted a faint crimson glow, precisely how this place got its name.

It was night time when Huang Xiaolong and the little cow arrived. The blood clouds above were glowing a deep red and a fetid smell unrelated to blood pervaded the air.

Huang Xiaolong was scowling in displeasure.

“I’ve been to this Blood Yang Mainland in the past. There are some places with ancient grand formations. If we accidentally get trapped inside, it’d be troublesome, so we must be careful.” The little cow reminded Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows rose in surprise, the little cow had been here before?

Although he felt doubtful, Huang Xiaolong did not ask any questions.

Since it was night time, Huang Xiaolong and Xiaoniū searched in the surroundings and found a naturally formed cave nearby to rest, deciding to continue tomorrow.

He then sat cross-legged inside the cave, refining one of the grade five spiritual veins.

Compared to the time he left the valley three months ago, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation took another step forward to peak mid-Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm by devouring countless Ancient God Realm magic beasts, ghouls, and evil spirits along the way, but he was still a long way from touching the border to late-Seventh Order.

Xiaoniū sat comfortably on the side, crunching on an Ancient God Realm godhead, whereas the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts were dutifully guarding at the cave entrance.

Outside, cold winds howled like ghosts weeping through the night.

In the middle of the night, a loud explosion shook the air. Violent shockwaves swept out in all directions before several silhouettes arrived from afar with the sound of whistling wind.

Disrupted, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow stopped cultivating and walked towards the cave entrance, looking out.

In the far distance, waves of powerful sword qi tore apart the blood-red clouds looming over the Blood Yang Mainland, followed by furious booming roars.

Other than the sword qi, there was an opposing blade qi that was just as alarming, each slash was earth-shattering as they blocked the waves of sword qi.

Moments later, a group of people appeared in Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s line of sight.

The first person who appeared in their sight was a young man holding a big blade, clad in a crimson brocade robe and a cloak of vigorous divine flames. The young man’s aura was akin to a rainbow that traversed ten thousand li.

Right behind him was a group of disciples in purple robes, each of them gripping a long sword. Sword qi criss-crossed in the air, forming a great net, sharp and intimidating. Each line of sword qi burned with purple flames.

Despite the distance, Huang Xiaolong could still feel the extreme yin and cold energy coming from the purple flames.

“I didn’t expect the Bladeless Gate and Purple Flames Sword Sect to be fighting again.” The little cow muttered, its brows scrunched together.

Huang Xiaolong was quick to ask, “This Bladeless Gate and the Purple Flames Sword Sect, are they famous?”

“Very famous.” The little cow confirmed, nodding its head, “These two sects are among the Divine World’s super forces. Their disciples rarely appear in the outside world. Sometimes it takes as long as a million years, but every time they appear, it’s never a good thing, each of them is the other’s nemesis. Lately, when I try to observe the heavens, I have an ominous feeling that, not too far in the future, the Divine World will face a calamity.” The little cow’s face was extremely somber saying this.

“Is the Devil World’s great army attacking?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow shook its head, “No, the devils’ great army attacking won’t affect the Divine World to this degree. The calamity this time is probably the biggest one ever since the Divine World’s birth. Before that, you must raise your strength as much as you can.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened at the little cow’s words.

The biggest calamity since the Divine World’s birth?

But Huang Xiaolong believed the little cow. If it said so, it was probably true.

“How long do I have?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Not more than three thousand years.” The little cow answered.

Three thousand years! Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply.

At this time, the intense battle in the air moved away in another direction.

“That Bladeless Gate disciple isn’t simple, he’s using the Bladeless Gate’s supreme technique, the Heaven’s Cycle Blade Qi. His status in the sect should be quite high, perhaps he’s Young Lord. If you run into him in the future, be wary of his Heaven’s Cycle Blade Qi.” The little cow commented, its gaze following the Bladeless Gate disciple’s back as he disappeared from sight.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the little cow, stunned. He knew that it more or less guessed his talent, about him having supreme godhead for instance, and also the True Divine Dragon Physique, yet it still advised him to be careful of that Bladeless Gate disciple. It seems that the young man’s talent was quite high as well.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, indicating that he had heard the little cow’s words.

At dawn the next day, Huang Xiaolong’s group continued onward to the mountain where the Soul Tribe’s Young Lord Hun Dishan found the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beast corpses.

From the air, this mountain resembled a resting savage beast. It exuded a savage aura, and occasional beast roars could be heard ringing through the mountain. It was an environment of constant killing and bloodshed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong immediately raised his vigilance.

Xiaoniū’s tail pointed up as the lightning symbol on its forehead glimmered. Its eyes then glimmered with similar light as if it could see through space.

A while later, joy rose up the little cow’s face.
