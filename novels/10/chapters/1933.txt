The plaza fell into silence, and no one dared to speak. The only sound heard was the sound of Wangu Wudi’s miserable howls.

With every fist Huang Xiaolong landed, Wangu Wudi cried out in pain. The cries only became more miserable when Huang Xiaolong circulated asura qi in his attacks.

Every time Wangu Wudi screamed, the hearts of the family patriarchs, who had come with him into the battle, trembled.

Very quickly, blood covered Wangu Wudi’s body. Not a single bone in him was left intact.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to shatter Wangu Wudi’s heart, the experts from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union arrived.

When they saw the scene playing out in front of them, all the experts from the Alchemist Alliance sucked in a cold breath.

When everyone focused their sights on the blood ridden Wangu Wudi, Sun Man’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong. When he saw the features on Huang Xiaolong’s face, his heart shook. It was as though he had seen a terrifying being, and a look of astonishment filled his face.

Even though he hadn’t seen Huang Xiaolong in thousands of years, he couldn’t forget his familiar figure. The image of Huang Xiaolong was already branded into his soul.

He recognized Huang Xiaolong with a single glance.

“It’s... it’s... it’s... Huang... Huang... It’s Huang...”

Before he could complete his sentence, Wangu Ruochen glared at Huang Xiaolong with bloodshot eyes. “Brat, you’re asking to die! How dare you injure our president?! Release him immediately! Men, hurry up and kill this brat for me! Save our president!”

Even though Wangu Wudi hadn’t officially accepted the Alchemist Grandmaster Union’s president’s position, everyone had already started addressing him as President Wudi.

Wangu Ruochen’s voice woke all the experts from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

In an instant, countless experts attacked Huang Xiaolong in a crazed fashion.

When Sun Man saw what was going down, his expression changed. Fear blossomed in his eyes, and he wanted to stop all of them. However, it was too late. Wangu Ruochen had already started his attack.

Looking at Wangu Ruochen throwing himself at him, a mesmerizing smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. This person wanted him to release their president?!

The moment Sun Man saw the smile appearing on Huang Xiaolong’s lips, his heart nearly stopped beating.

Huang Xiaolong raised his fist and punched towards Wangu Wudi’s heart.

Bang!

The moment Huang Xiaolong’s fist landed, a bloody hole formed on Wangu Wudi’s chest. His heart emerged from his back.

Wangu Wudi was sent flying towards Wangu Ruochen at an insane speed. Wangu Ruochen’s expression changed, and he hastily reached out to grab Wangu Wudi’s body. When the body arrived in his arms, he realized that it contained a horrifying amount of force behind it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A howl left Wangu Ruochen’s lips as he circulated all his godforce to block the impact from shaking his soil. Even so, he felt as though the blood in his body was flowing in the reverse direction after grabbing Wangu Wudi’s body. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Before he could react, a figure appeared before him. When he looked up, Huang Xiaolong was already standing in front of him, and a look of shock appeared on his face.

Huang Xiaolong sent out another punch, and it landed on Wangu Wudi’s body. A fist pierced through Wangu Wudi’s body and landed on Wangu Ruochen.

Wangu Ruochen felt as though he had slammed into an ancient star, and he was sent flying into the distance. Tyrannical energy wreaked havoc in his body.

“Pop!”

An ear-shattering pop sounded in the air, and everyone saw how Wangu Ruochen exploded into a mist of blood above their heads.

A burst of crimson filled their vision.

Everyone could only stare at the scene before them in shock.

Wangu Ruochen was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm! He was the third strongest individual in the Wangu Race, and he was also the third strongest expert in the Alchemist Grandmaster Union! Someone like him was killed with a single punch!

Everyone who was about to fight Huang Xiaolong felt their hearts stop. They screeched to a halt in mid-air.

When the experts from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union finally stopped, Sun Man rushed over in a frenzy. He screamed at the top of his lungs. “Stop! All of you, stop right there!”

When they saw how Sun Man was out of breath from screaming at them, all the experts felt as though something was wrong.

Sun Man ignored everyone as he approached Huang Xiaolong. Before the gazes of everyone present, he fell to his knees. As his face touched the ground, a voice full of reverence resounded in the air. “President Huang, you’re finally back!”

President Huang!

You’re finally back!

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong with their mouths agape.

As for the various experts from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, they stared at Sun Man trembling on the ground. They failed to react. President Huang?! Wait a minute... PRESIDENT HUANG?!

Could it be?!

When they thought of the possibility, the feeling of dread overwhelmed them. They stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

As the elders from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, the family patriarchs who had accompanied Wangu Wudi felt the blood draining from their faces. They finally realized who the man standing in front of them was!

“Huang... President Huang!” The Leng Family Patriarch forced his mouth open and greeted Huang Xiaolong. He felt that his teeth were about to drop off from how hard he was grinding them.

Everyone felt their legs going soft.

They realized how Huang Xiaolong had addressed the Ascending Moon Old Man as his master. They had thought nothing of it earlier, but now, they realized that disaster might have fallen on their heads. Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong the Ascending Moon Old Man’s disciple?!

Huang Xiaolong stared at Sun Man whose face was on the ground, and he laughed. “Ah, Sun Man. I had never expected that you would recognize me after so many years.”

His smile was warm, and his voice was crisp. It was like a ray of warm sunlight on a cold, snowy day. However, Sun Man felt even colder than before. His body couldn’t stop trembling, and his eyes betrayed his fear. He heard the displeasure in Huang Xiaolong’s voice. All these old men knew that Wangu Wudi had wanted to destroy the Huang Family, but instead of speaking up or stopping him, they had done nothing.

“President Huang, I... I... I...” Sun Man failed to complete his sentence no matter how hard he tried.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the seven elders from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, and a sneer formed on his lips. “According to the rules of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, one has to pass all five tests before one can become the president. Did Wangu Wudi accomplish the fear? He hasn’t even completed a single test! I don’t understand how he managed to become the chairman of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union...?”

The plaza fell into complete silence.

Yan Jinwen, an elder of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, tried to reason with Huang Xiaolong. “Lord Wangu Wudi has unparalleled talent when it comes to pill refinement. It’s a matter of time before he completes the test. It’s normal for us to address him as ‘president’...”

“Normal?” Huang Xiaolong laughed when he heard the excuse Yan Jinwen gave.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong, you might be strong, but you can’t change the current situation alone!” One of the other elders, You Wuguang, hesitated for a moment before saying, “Release President Wangu Wudi right now, and we can plead on your behalf. We can ask him to forgive your Huang Family.”
