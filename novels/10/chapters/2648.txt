Chapter 2649: True Identity?

Although the news that Mo Wunian had entered Primal Ancestor Realm came as a surprise, Yuan Qianxing wasn’t overly concerned about it. In other people’s eyes, a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor might have been a supreme existence, but in his eyes, that realm was an ant, and that would never change!

After he stepped into Primal Ancestor Realm, all low-level Primal Ancestors would reduce to ants in his eyes.

At the moment, Huang Xiaolong was the biggest threat to him.

When Huang Xiaolong was besieged on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak, Huang Xiaolong had shown astounding combat power. The moment Huang Xiaolong had comprehended all the dao laws at Dao Gate, Huang Xiaolong’s existence had been elevated to the highest threat and danger to him.

Huang Xiaolong must die!

A cruel light glimmered in Yuan Qianxing’s eyes, as the battle stage competition was just around the corner, which was less than a year.

“Just thinking about it fills me with anticipation.” At the bottom of Yuan Qianxing’s heart, strong bloodthirst and killing intent surged quietly.

Several months went by.

Inside the Flying Heaven Race’s Flying Heaven Grand Formation, Huang Xiaolong, who had been inside absorbing grand dao energy and grand dao laws all this time, opened his eyes. The golden dragon phantom, hovering behind him, slowly disappeared.

Fei Yanzi, who had been guarding Huang Xiaolong from outside the formation, exhaled lazily when she noticed Huang Xiaolong had awakened. This fella is finally awake, he wouldn’t have made it in time for the stage battle competition if he hadn’t.

Both Fei Yanzi and Hei Luo flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

“You’ve finally awakened.” As she descended in front of Huang Xiaolong, Fei Yanzi teased with her pleasant, soothing voice.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Fei Yanzi’s beautiful eyes, and he nodded and smiled as he sincerely thanked her, “Thank you.”

A Primal Ancestor Realm like Fei Yanzi had willingly stayed to protect him for more than a decade. Due to this, Huang Xiaolong felt a little embarrassed.

“If you really want to thank me, treat me with some dragon dates,” Fei Yanzi responded cheerfully.

“Dragon dates?” This was the first time Huang Xiaolong heard of dragon dates.

“From your face, I can already tell that you have not heard of it.” Fei Yanzi smiled charmingly as she explained, “The dragon date is a holy fruit found in the World River, but the rate of their output is very low. Only a dozen or so grow every few hundred million years. Even the World River’s Primal Ancestors don't have dragon dates in their possession. I got a chance to taste it once long ago, and their taste is truly unforgettable.”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised that the dragon dates had left such a deep impression on Fei Yanzi even after she had eaten the fruit once. Is there really something so tasty in the world?

“Dragon dates are the most delicious food in the world,” Fei Yanzi stressed when she noticed the doubt on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Everyone, who has eaten it, thinks so. If you’re lucky enough to taste it in the future, you won’t be able to forget it’s taste.”

“Deal! When I go to the World River, I will save you some dragon dates if I find them,” Huang Xiaolong promised generously.

Fei Yanzi giggled charmingly and reminded, “Dragon dates are not easy to find.”

The two of them chatted as they walked out from the forbidden land with Hei Luo following behind them. Their topic shifted from the dragon dates to the various big clans and forces along the World River, to Yuan Qianxing and the Otherworldly Mansion, Golden Buddha Race, and even the looming war between the Holy World and Alien Lands.

The two walked side by side, talking merrily like they were old friends.

There was a delicate, fresh fragrance coming from Fei Yanzi’s body that was pleasing to the senses.

Fei Yanzi stopped abruptly and looked at Huang Xiaolong with a strangely serious expression, “Your Highness, I have a question that I have been wanting to ask, but I don’t know if it is alright to ask.”

Huang Xiaolong was baffled by the seriousness on Fei Yanzi’s face, and he asked what question she had.

“Are you really a human from our Alien Lands?” Fei Yanzi hesitated for a second before asking. “Or what I want to ask is, which alien race are you from?”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised.

Just this? He thought she had something important to ask.

In fact, the Alien Lands’ various forces were guessing his identity. They were wondering if he was really a human native to the Alien Lands, or if he came from the Holy World. Fen Yanzi wanted to confirm this point?

“No, I am not asking if you’re from the Holy World,” Fei Yanzi quickly explained when she noticed Huang Xiaolong’s expression and shook her head. She went on to recount Huang Xiaolong’s situation during the sacrificial ritual, and then briefly told Huang Xiaolong about their Flying Heaven Race’s ancient records regarding the God of Creation and Son of Creation.

“God of Creation? Son of Creation?” Huang Xiaolong was piqued.

There is something like the God of Creation Yellow Dragon’s bloodline?

Huang Xiaolong felt as if he was handed pieces of puzzles, and he didn't know where to start.

Is Fei Yanzi asking if I am the Son of Creation? How is that possible? These were the first thoughts that crossed Huang Xiaolong’s mind, and he found it funny. How can I be the Son of Creation? I am but the most ordinary mortal from the lower worlds, the most ordinary of Huang Clan Manor’s disciples. I have persisted with my cultivation path and achieved what I have today, step by step.

Although he had suspected his true identity, Huang Xiaolong thought that saying that he was the Son of Creation was the furthest thing from the truth.

“Patriarch Fei Yanzi, you’re probably mistaken. My bloodline shouldn’t be the God of Creation’s bloodline.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. “How could I be the Son of Creation? In truth, I am nothing more than an ordinary mortal family’s disciple.”

Fei Yanzi looked like the cat had got her tongue, “Mortal world?”

Huang Xiaolong had nothing to conceal and briefly told Fei Yanzi that he was a small clan’s disciple from the mortal world.

Fei Yanzi’s eyes widened in disbelief, as she had thought of many possibilities but never had it occurred to her that Huang Xiaolong was actually a disciple from the lower worlds’ mortal world.

This idea was simply unbelievable.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A mortal world’s disciple came this far? He grew strong to the point that the Primal Ancestors are wary of him? This, how is this possible? Fei Yanzi had a hard time believing that.

“In truth, not only you, I myself can't believe it.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head self-deprecatingly and added, “Sometimes, even I have doubted my true identity, thinking if I am some big shot’s reincarnation. However, saying that I am the Son of Creation is really impossible. How could I be the Son of Creation?”

“Why impossible?” Fei Yanzi suddenly retorted sonorously.

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a second.

Why impossible? This…

“Just because you were born in the mortal world, why is it not possible for you to be the Son of Creation?” Fei Yanzi pressed on.

Huang Xiaolong looked dazedly at Fei Yanzi. She’s right, ah. Just because I was born in the lower worlds’ mortal world, why can’t I be the Son of Creation? Huang Xiaolong fell into contemplation.

“If you are not the Son of Creation, and you don’t have the God of Creation’s bloodline, then how come you have achieved what you have achieved so far by being a mere mortal?” Fei Yanzi argued. “Moreover, if you are not the Son of Creation, how can you possess such frightening combat power?”

Huang Xiaolong continued to remain silent.

An hour later, Huang Xiaolong and Fei Yanzi arrived at the highest floor of the Flying Heaven Race's bibliotheca and found the ancient record describing the God of Creation at the deepest area.

There was a kind of mysterious energy around the ancient record that one couldn’t read with their divine sense. Instead, they had to flip through the pages one by one. When Huang Xiaolong opened the cover and turned to the first page, his hand was trembling. Although he had never seen this ancient record before, inexplicably, there was a familiar feeling, as if he had seen it in his dream?

When he flipped to the first page, suddenly, a light flew out from the ancient record.
