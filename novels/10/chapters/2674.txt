Chapter 2675: Suppressed So Fast?

Based on his early Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm strength and the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation, Mo Jincheng had been able to suppress and injure Fang Ding who was a late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor in the past. This was an attestment of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation’s power.

Under the spurring from Mo Jincheng’s energy, the entire Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation emitted a burst of blinding light, originating from the devilish pupils. Soon after, everything under the scope of these pupils actually started to shrink and die as if they had been sucked dry in an instant.

The blood runes’ light from these devil pupils all targeted Huang Xiaolong.

“Insignificant tricks,” Huang Xiaolong commented in an indifferent tone. Strong dao light surged from his body and formed a grand dao energy boundary around him.

When the blood runes’ glow fell on the grand dao energy barrier, the barrier actually started shrinking in size. A second later, it would expand again, supported by Huang Xiaolong’s vigorous grand dao energy.

No matter how shocking the devil pupils’ blood runes were, they were unable to collapse Huang Xiaolong’s grand dao energy barrier.

After seeing this, Mo Jincheng was furious and anxious at the same time. He let out a bellow, and the devilish pupil once again appeared on his forehead. This devil eye flew into the air and entered the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation’s center, integrating into the formation seamlessly.

“Huang Xiaolong, I refuse to believe that the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation can’t suppress you!” Mo Jincheng screamed.

“All Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s disciples listen to my order, and send out your devil eyes, and all of your power into the Eight Claw Devil Race Grand Formation!” Mo Jincheng’s voice reverberated through the city.

Immediately, the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s Patriarch Mo Rui, Young Patriarch Mo Jun, and the others all sent out their devil eyes into the grand formation.

This was the terror of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation, as it could integrate with every single Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s disciples’ bloodline power as one entity.

After Mo Rui, Mo Jun, and the others’ devil eye had integrated with the grand formation, the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation’s power rose sharply, and the devilish right soared to the sky. Every expert within the Eight Claw Devil Race’s territory could see the light.

In a big city far away from the Devil Eye City, various World River’s races were discussing something when their attention was suddenly attracted by the soaring devilish light.

“Isn’t that the devil eye’s devil light?! It’s the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race grand formation’s light! The Eight Claw Devil Eye Race has activated the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation! Who is so capable to trigger the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race to activate the grand formation?!”

“Other World River’s race’s old ancestor?! Could it be the Dragon Fish ‘s old ancestor? Or the Thunder Serpent Race’s Old Ancestor? It has been a long time since the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race has activated their grand formation, and so far, it has only been activated once. Could it be Fang Ding again? He could have come back to avenge that grudge of losing one arm that year!”

“There is this possibility! But no matter who it is, it’s definitely a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert or stronger since they are able to make the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race to activate the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation!”

The Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation’s activation immediately became a hot topic.

A wave of shock rippled past everyone.

The Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation had once dealt heavy injuries to Fang Ding, creating a deterrent to many World River’s many experts. Now that the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation is activated for the second time, is the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race showing off their majesty and raising their deterrence power?!

The domain’s experts whispered in shock. At the same time, within the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation, Huang Xiaolong watched the soaring devil light with an indifferent expression.

“The Devil Eye’s Annihilation!”

Mo Jincheng’s bellow reverberated in the air.

All the devil eyes on the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation rotated at rapid speed, and the blood runes’ devilish light gathered into a sea of blood light that slammed towards Huang Xiaolong.

A golden light glimmered from Huang Xiaolong’s hand as he took out the Flying Heaven Spear and stabbed it towards the formation. However, he did not use any dao art, it was merely a very ordinary attack. Even so, in one strike, the force from the Flying Heaven Spear sent out rolling grand dao energy.

Mo Jincheng’s face turned slightly ugly. Mo Rui, Mo Jun, and other Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s experts couldn’t see the terror of Huang Xiaolong’s seemingly ordinary attack, but he, an early Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor saw through the essence in a glance.

Just as his expression turned ugly, r-r-rum~bl-le!

The spear rays collided with the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation, and the seemingly frightening devilish blood light sea disintegrated under Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

The terrifying sea of blood light dissipated just like that.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Overwhelming repelling power from the collision sent Mo Jincheng, Mo Rui, and the rest staggering unsteadily. Mo Jincheng merely staggered a little bit, but Patriarch Mo Rui and the rest were coughing up blood almost uncontrollably.

“You!” Mo Jincheng was shocked, and he looked at Huang Xiaolong with dread, “How could you be so strong!” More than a decade ago, when the six of them had besieged Huang Xiaolong, he hadn’t been this strong. At that time, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t have been a match against him even if they had battled one-on-one.

But now, even with the entire race’s power integrated into the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation, he failed to suppress Huang Xiaolong!

Suddenly, Mo Jincheng’s face became distorted as he shouted, “You got the Sky Opening Island’s grand dao treasure?!”

Since Huang Xiaolong’s strength had grown to such a terrifying degree that it could only have one explanation—he had gotten the grand dao treasure in the deepest part of Sky Opening Island.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent, and he ignored Mo Jincheng’s words. Instead, he gave a warning, “Mo Jincheng, it’s my turn to attack now.”

With that said, before Mo Jincheng understood what Huang Xiaolong meant, the Flying Heaven Spear in Huang Xiaolong’s hand burst out in ten thousand bright rays in an instant.

Every ray of spear light resembled a meteor across the sky, looking beautiful from a distance, but in Mo Jincheng and the others’ eyes, it was utmost horror.

“Quick! Activate the Devil Eye Firmament!” Mo Jincheng bellowed anxiously.

Urged by Mo Jincheng’s anxious bellow, all the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s disciples desperately spurred their own devil eye. Once again the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation burst out in intense light, turning into a dome, the devil’s firmament.

A devil sovereign’s momentum rose from the grand formation that all other living creatures seemed so insignificant, including Huang Xiaolong’s ten thousand rays of spear light.

But those seemingly feeble ten thousand rays of spear light passed through the Devil Eye Firmament as if it was nothing, stabbing onto the many devil pupils.

And these devil pupils with blood runes over them burst like bubbles.

At the same time, all Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s disciples were knocked into the air, screaming in pain as blood flowed out from the hole in their forehead where the devil pupils should have been. Their innate devil eyes were destroyed. That included their Patriarch Mo Rui’s innate devil pupil.

Mo Jincheng fared slightly better, but blood was flowing endlessly down his forehead.

The Flying Heaven Spear in Huang Xiaolong’s hand stabbed out once again. The Flying Heaven Spear’s bird beak pierced into Mo Jincheng’s chest, and brought out a spurt of blood.

……

One hour later.

The dust has settled.

Other experts watching from afar saw the Eight Claw Devil Eye Grand Formation’s bloody red light dissipate, which meant the grand formation was deactivated. Some experts carefully braved towards the Devil Eye City, wanting to check out the situation.

“That trespasser into the Devil Eye City is already suppressed by the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s experts? So fast! At least that Fang Ding lasted for more than a day, it has merely been an hour.”

Some experts shook their heads as they approached the Devil Eye City.
