In a split second, the entire sea tribe turned hostile, and heavy tension filled the air.

Feng Family’s Patriarch Feng Kaiyun, who was also the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony’s master of ceremonies, looked coldly at Golden Brow Ancestor. His voice turned icy as he said, "Golden Brow, you are interfering in our sea tribe’s God of the Sea Grand Ceremony’s battle competition. Is it because you think your strength is superior, and therefore you can disregard our sea tribe’s rules?!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, it was really surprising that Feng Family’s Patriarch Feng Kaiyun had actually turned around to bite them, and was accusing them of interfering with the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

The sea tribe’s shamelessness was truly eye-opening.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the crowd. Not one person spoke a word on their behalf. Human forces such as the Wangu Clan and Dark Elf Tribe sat silently without moving.

Golden Brow Ancestor looked disdainfully at Feng Kaiyun, and said, "Junior Kaiyun, your face must have been arched over by a boar, the more I see, the more disgusted I feel. The rules are made by the sea tribe, yet your sea tribe violated the rules to begin with and interfered in the battle competition. What? Only the sea tribe is allowed to be the winner? Can’t afford to lose? If you can’t afford to lose, then don’t come out to make a fool of yourself? You really think that my Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate is made of mud, to be molded as you like?!”

A cold golden light glimmered in Golden Brow Ancestor’s eyes as he went on, “Believe it or not, I’ll smash your Sea God City right now!”

Smash Sea God City!

Golden Brow Ancestor’s supremacy soared in the air.

In a short second, Blood Knife Ancestor appeared by Golden Brow Ancestor’s side. His hostile gaze swept over the sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs, and he questioned domineeringly, “You all want to come one by one or all together?”

His questioned was like oil over fire, as it instantly enraged the sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs.

“Enough!”Feng Yingying ordered from her Sea God’s throne. She had been quiet the entire time. She then announced, “Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate wins this battle. All retreat, right now.”

Feng Yingying’s Sea God’s bloodline exuded pressure that reached the four corners of the square.

“Yes, Lord Sea God!”

The sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs respectfully acknowledged her order. They threw an unwilling look at Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor before returning to their seats.

Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi both glared hatefully at Golden Brow Ancestor and Huang Xiaolong, but they had no other choice except to return to their seats. Guo Jun was soon carried off the stage by other Guo Family’s Elders to heal at some other place.

Various experts were left wondering inwardly about the severity of Guo Jun’s injuries. But it was clear to everyone that it would take more than a few days for Guo Jun to heal completely.

At the same time, everyone looked strangely at Huang Xiaolong, who had already reverted to his original human form. His upper body was naked, revealing chiseled muscles, and his long black hair fluttered in the wind; there was an air of unruly dominance, and also arrogance in his appearance.

“Give Young Warrior Huang the stated rewards." Feng Yingying retrieved her gaze from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and ordered the Feng Family’s Grand Elder who was in charge of handing out the rewards.

The Feng Family’s Grand Elder acknowledged respectfully, and started going towards the stage to give the rewards to Huang Xiaolong. But Huang Xiaolong said indifferently, "There is no need for you to give me the sea tribe’s rubbish. It doesn’t matter if I don’t get the useless reward. Master, this God of the Sea Grand Ceremony is boring and meaningless. Let’s head back to the Fortune Gate earlier than we had originally planned."

’The sea tribe’s rewards are rubbish?!’

The God of the Sea Grand Ceremony is boring and meaningless!

The various sects’ experts blanked momentarily when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s words. No one had expected that he would have the guts to say that the sea tribe’s rewards were rubbish in front of Feng Yingying and other sea tribe’s experts, and pour scorn on the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony by calling it boring!

Wasn’t that the same as saying the sea tribe was rubbish?!

The sea tribe’s experts were immediately enraged.

"Punk, what did you say?!"

"Kill Huang Xiaolong!" Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Some impulsive sea tribe’s disciples began shouting angrily.

But Golden Brow Ancestor laughed loudly, "You are right, these rubbish things don’t hold any value for us. We’re leaving!" After saying this, he and Blood Knife Ancestor flickered, and brought Huang Xiaolong back to where Zhu Yi was.

"Gate Chief, what do you say?" Golden Brow Ancestor asked Zhu Yi. After all, Zhu Yi was the current Fortune Gate Chief, it was only appropriate that he asked for Zhu Yi’s opinion.

Zhu Yi frowned as his gaze swept around the square. The sea tribe’s experts’ angry faces entered his sight, therefore, he could only answer, “Alright.” Frankly, he was also dissatisfied with the sea tribe.

“Farewell.” Zhu Yi crisply greeted Feng Yingying, sea tribe’s Ancestors, Patriarchs, and experts from the neighboring surfaces, and then turned and whistled away in the air.

Zhu Feng and Wang Wei quickly followed.

During this entire episode, the little cow that was dozing off on the floor. Huang Xiaolong kicked and scolded the little cow angrily, “Wake up, we’re leaving!”

The little cow rubbed her eyes, and yawned, “Finished fighting already? Such a fast wrap up?"

"Not finished yet. You can stay here and sleep." Huang Xiaolong replied to the little cow angrily before leaving.

The little cow blinked a few times and looked around. She saw the murderous faces of the sea tribe’s disciples, and her hair stood up on the end of her tail as she jumped up. In the next second, she turned into a streak of light, and chased after Huang Xiaolong as fast as she could.

Feng Yingying’s eyes were frosty as she watched Huang Xiaolong’s back.

Did Huang Xiaolong actually reject the rewards from her?! And did he say they were rubbish?!

This not only insulted the sea tribe, but also her authority!

"Lord Sea God!" Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi cried out anxiously as he watched Huang Xiaolong leaving with Golden Brow Ancestor and the others, "They cannot leave!"

Feng Yingying asked without any expression, "Reason?"

Guo Shi stammered as he tried to come up with a good reason, “Huang Xiaolong injured my Guo Family’s disciple Guo Gang in Sea God City some days back.” but his voice weakened at the end.

Guo Shi very well knew the details of that incident.

By this time, the Fortune Gate group had arrived at the Sea God’s transmission array. When they stepped into the transmission array, the sea tribe’s guards did not stop them. Feng Yingying did not order them to.

This time the group traveled without stopping, hence they were able to reach the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall’s Wu Island in as short as half a month’s time. At Wu Island, all of them breathed a sigh of relief inwardly, as they could be considered safe on Wu Island.

If they were forcefully made to stay at the Sea God City, even though Golden Brow Ancestor was very powerful, there was no guarantee that he could rescue Huang Xiaolong unharmed.

The group rested for a day on Wu Island.

Inside a courtyard, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor summoned Huang Xiaolong. Both of them scrutinized him from top to bottom without saying a word as he stood in front of them. Goosebumps ran down Huang Xiaolong’s neck due to their gazes.

After a long time, Blood Knife suddenly let out a hearty laughter, “Kid, are you worried that we might smack your bottom?”

Golden Brow Ancestor chuckled amiably.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his two Masters’ courtyard. He felt like he had survived an ordeal. After that he headed to the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall to look for Head Supervisor Meng Yuan.

The result of this trip to the Infinite Circles Commerce Hall delighted Huang Xiaolong. About three to four hundred herbs out of two thousand items from his list were already found. And a dozen of them were the items he needed urgently.

Early the next day, the group departed from Wu Island.

A few days of travelling and Huang Xiaolong was back in the Fortune Divine Kingdom. With nothing to do, Huang Xiaolong headed to Li Chaosheng’s cultivation palace to see Yao Chi. A few months of separation had made Yao Chi even more mesmerizing, as she was exuding an alluring charm all over.

Once he met Yao Chi, rekindling of feelings was unavoidable, thus, Huang Xiaolong leaned in and whispered into her ear, “I won’t be leaving for the next three months.” The last time, he had accompanied her only for ten days, before he was called away by his two Masters. But this time, he planned to stay with Yao Chi for a few months, now that the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony was out of the way, and he didn’t need to do anything specific urgently.

Yao Chi actually trembled slightly, as she head that Huang Xiaolong was planning to stay for three months.

Even though she has a unique physique, it was nothing compared to Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique.
