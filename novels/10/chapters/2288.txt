Chapter 2289: This is the First Time I’m Hearing This!

Seeing as the members of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island were finally there, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on Wu Chengkun, and he asked, “Are you the special envoy sent by the Divine Sea Spiritual Island?”

“Preposterous!” An expert standing behind Wu Chengkun roared when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Why aren’t you calling him Lord Envoy! What audacity...?”

As soon as the words left his lips, the guardian behind Huang Xiaolong flicked his finger and a hole appeared in the space between the expert’s eyebrows. Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, the expert turned into dust and was blown away in the wind.

“What?!”

Wu Chengkun and the other experts, who had come along with him, widened their eyes in shock.

The person who was killed was at the peak of the early-Second Order Venerable Realm! His strength was ranked in the top ten of the group sent by the Divine Sea Spiritual Island! Even someone like that was killed with a flick of the finger by the other party!

A single flick was enough to reduce him to dust!

After they got over their shock, rage welled up in their heart. Wu Chengkun glared at Huang Xiaolong and Liu Zhi, “Liu Zhi, what’s the meaning of this?! How dare you kill someone from our Divine Sea Spiritual Island?! I was planning to take you under my wing. However, there is no longer a chance of that happening now!”

The experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island drew their weapons and their auras locked onto everyone from the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island.

The moment Wu Chengkun gave his order, they were prepared to attack.

Even though the other party had used a single flick to kill a peak early-Second Order Venerable on their side, Wu Chengkun and the others felt that taking down the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island with their combined strength was possible.

“Hahah! Envoy from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island, are you stupid? My master is a Holy Prince from the Holy Gate! Why aren’t you guys on your knees?!”

Holy Prince from the Holy Gate?!

Wu Chengkun and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong with a look of disbelief in their eyes.

However, one Gao Songyuan started to roar with laughter. “Liu Zhi, why don’t you call him the Holy Gate’s Patriarch instead?! Anyone can b*llshit!”

Laughter soon filled the air when the members of the Divine Sea Spiritual Island heard what he said.

“How can an early-Tenth Order Sovereign be a Holy Prince?!” Wu Chengkun continued, “This is the first time I’ve heard that there’s a Sovereign Realm Holy Prince in the Holy Gate! Hahaha!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was clear that none of them believed that Huang Xiaolong was a Holy Prince.

Even though many top-tier families and clans knew of Huang Xiaolong’s ascension as the newest Holy Prince and his battle with Huang Zhouping on the Holy Stage, there were many other powers that had no idea of his existence.

People like Wu Chengkun were naturally ignorant about Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

Of course, as a Sovereign, it was really hard to convince anyone that he was actually a Holy Prince of the Holy Gate.

Li Zhi couldn’t help but rage when he heard how Wu Chengkun and the rest were mocking his master. However, Huang Xiaolong stopped him before he could say anything.

Glancing at Wu Chengkun and the rest, Huang Xiaolong said, “How about this. I’ll allow you to leave if you manage to block a single punch.”

Everyone stared at him like they were looking at a retard.

Wu Chengkun was the first to laugh. “You will allow me to leave if I manage to take a single punch? Aren’t you missing something here?”

Gao Songyuan chuckled, “Brat, don’t you know that our Lord Envoy is at a late-Second Order Venerable?! How about this? I’ll let you leave if you manage to take on my punch?!”

Even though Gao Songyuan wasn’t a late-Second Order Venerable, he was at the peak of the mid-Second Order Venerable Realm.

“Enough of your nonsense. All of you, come at me!” Huang Xiaolong’s body shook as he punched towards Wu Chengkun and Gao Songyuan.

“You’re looking to die!” Wu Chengkun felt a trace of anger boiling in his heart when he saw that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to launch the first attack. A sneer soon formed on his face. “Brat, regardless of your identity, I’ll kill....” Before he could complete his sentence, a terrifying force emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s fist, causing his expression to change drastically.

“Divine Sea Spiritual Turtle!”

Wu Chengkun screamed as an icy light covered his body. The image of a turtle shell soon appeared to protect him.

The Divine Sea Spiritual Turtle was a technique left behind by an ancient expert and even though it wasn’t comparable to Half-True Saint techniques, it was a high-level Venerable secret art. The defensive properties of the Divine Sea Spiritual Turtle technique was shocking.

A turtle shell covered Gao Songyuan’s body in the next instant. Only those who were valued by the Divine Sea Island Master would be able to cultivate the Divine Sea Spiritual Turtle technique!

With Wu Chengkun’s strength, even peak late-Second Order Venerables would find it difficult to shatter his defense!

By the time the shell was fully formed, Huang Xiaolong’s fists arrived. It slammed into their bodies without the slightest sign of weakening.

Boom!

An explosion rang through the skies.

The turtle shells around the two of them shattered in an instant and blinding rays of light filled the space around them. Wu Chengkun and Gao Songyuan raised their arms hastily as they tried to block the punch.

However, the two of them were simply too weak. When the punch connected, their arms shattered like dried up branches of a tree. Unable to stop Huang Xiaolong’s attack, they were sent flying.

After slamming into a random rock on the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island, two massive craters were formed in the land.

Pfff!

The two of them vomited mouthful after mouthful of fresh blood as their vision went dark.

Everyone from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island stared at them in shock.

“Lord Envoy!”

When they rushed over to Wu Chengkun’s side, they saw that the divine armor on his body had long been shattered. They couldn’t move as their breaths slowly became shallower and shallower.

“Kill that brat!”

Someone in the Divine Sea Spiritual Island’s party screamed.

In an instant, everyone pounced at Huang Xiaolong.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong indicated for everyone to stay back. As light enveloped his body, Huang Xiaolong charged into the battle. His figure flashed non-stop as he flittered around the battlefield. Every time he appeared, he sent an expert from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island flying.

In the blink of an eye, nearly a hundred experts from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island were left sprawled on the ground.

Amongst them, Wu Chengkun and Gao Songyuan were the strongest. Since Huang Xiaolong could finish them off with a single punch, there wasn’t much suspense when he was dealing with the rest.

Soon, Liu Zhi and the other experts from the Mirage Sea Spiritual Island dragged the bodies of Wu Chengkun, and the others to Huang Xiaolong.

“You... Who are you?!” Wu Chengkun gasped for air as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. However, blood sprayed out from his mouth the moment he parted his lips.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved a golden token and waved it in front of Wu Chengkun’s face.

“Holy... Holy Prince Token!” Everyone from the Divine Sea Spiritual Island felt a tremor run through their hearts.

The youngster they were planning to kill was really a Holy Prince from the Holy Gate!

Fear took over Wu Chengkun’s mind and the anger he had felt previously disappeared. “This... Your Highness... We didn’t know....”
