Chapter 3565 – Dragon Overlord

“Be careful!” Ao Xing, Huang Long, and the others yelled.

In stark contrast to the expressions on the faces of those below, Tao Shi and the others stared at Meng Tian and Huang Sheng pitifully.

Without much suspense, they were sent flying by a single kick from Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t pull his punches when dealing with the two of them. He used ninety percent of his strength in those kicks.

Since his foot landed directly on their faces, their skulls shattered to bits.

As their miserable shrieks pierced through the air, they were sent flying to a random corner of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire.

The Star Dragon Couple, the old dragon, and Huang Long stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“This…” The old dragon looked at Huang Sheng and Meng Tian who were beaten into the ground. Even with his strength, he couldn’t match up to Huang Sheng! Much less Meng Tian who was stronger than that!

Despite that, the two of them were defeated by Huang Xiaolong with a single strike!

Questioning looks were thrown towards Huang Xiaolong.

Noticing the look on their faces, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “While staying in the First Universe, I managed to accumulate more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy.” Pointing towards Zhu Yaowen, Yang Gang, and those who appeared in mid alr, he continued, “These are my subordinates.”

10 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Three subordinates at the God of Creation Realm!

Huang Long and the rest were at a loss for words after hearing what he said.

If they knew that the three of them were only a small part of Huang Xiaolong’s faction, who knew what they would think?!

The experts who came over with Meng Tian and Huang Sheng didn’t dare to make rash movements as they stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Taking a single step, Huang Xiaolong arrived above Meng Tian and Huang Sheng. As they were sent crashing deep into the earth, Huang Xiaolong casually waited for them to emerge. Their faces were completely disfigured. Even though he only used ninety percent of power in his kick, the two of them were far from able to resist it.

Even half step Universe Gods would be beaten to a pulp by Huang Xiaolong, much less the two of them.

However, Huang Sheng leaped into the air suddenly as a giant axe appeared in his hand. It was the top-grade creation artifact he had been nurturing and it came slashing down towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, go to hell!”

Raising his hand casually, Huang Xiaolong blocked the axe with his bare hands.

Bang!

Huang Xiaolong’s arm was completely fine, but a nick appeared on Huang Sheng’s axe! His eyes bulged when he saw the outcome of the exchange.

He had nurtured his Dragon Axe for countless years, and he used an extraordinary amount of treasure to do so! Even if he fought with Pangu who had the Pangu Axe, there was no way his weapon would be damaged!

The Star Dragon Couple, the old dragon, and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as though they were looking at a monster.

If he could stop a top-grade creation artifact with his own body, wouldn’t that make his physique comparable to universe treasures?! Even if it couldn’t, it wouldn’t be that far off!

When Huang Sheng was still stuck in a daze, Huang Xiaolong’s fist arrived. It pierced through Huang Sheng’s chest and blew a hole through the man’s dao heart!

Meng Tian, who had barely crawled out from his hole, was about to rush up to give Huang Xiaolong a piece of his mind too. He stopped dead in his tracks when he saw what happened to Huang Sheng.

Turning around slowly, Huang Xiaolong revealed a smile when he looked at Meng Tian.

“Why aren’t you guys doing anything?! Take him down right now!” Meng Tian roared at the experts who came along with him.

Snapping back to reality, they charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Open the formation! Capture them all!” Huang Xiaolong said to Zhu Yaowen.

They were busy setting up a grand formation earlier, and that was the reason they didn’t appear together with Huang Xiaolong. Even though the formation was hastily arranged, they were still able to stop Meng Tian and the others from escaping immediately. The short delay was more than enough for Huang Xiaolong to deal with them.

The moment he gave the order, the grand formation was revealed to the world. A massive barrier of light formed in the skies above, blocking off all connection to the outside world. Zhu Yaowen and the others charged at the experts Meng Tian and Huang Sheng brought. The battle reached its climax immediately.

The Star Dragon Couple, the old dragon, Huang Long, and the others charged into the fray too.

With the support Huang Xiaolong brought back with him, they could finally release all their pent up rage!

“This is amazing!” Ao Xing roared with laughter while attacking the original assailants.

After many months of living under the pressure of being attacked every day, Ao Xing could finally release all the resentment in his heart!

Huang Xiaolong was in charge of suppressing Meng Tian and Huang Sheng. Even though he could take them down instantly, he chose to play around with them. Even though he didn’t use his full strength, they were still beaten black and blue.

The two of them were experts who stood at the peak of the power pyramid in their respective universes, and they had never been humiliated their entire lives! In a fit of rage, they thought of sacrificing a part of their power to bring Huang Xiaolong down with them!

Unfortunately, they were too weak to cause any serious damage to Huang Xiaolong.

Boom!

As the battle dragged on for half an hour, they were sent crashing into the ground countless times.

Crawling to their feet, they were in a terrible state. The divine armor around their bodies were in shambles, and bloodstains were everywhere.

“Huang Xiaolong, enough! We’re the Dragon Overlord’s subordinates!” Meng Tian glared at Huang Xiaolong and snorted, “If we fail to return, he will never forgive you! With his strength, he can eliminate half step Universe Gods as he pleases!”

Huang Sheng continued, “That’s right! So what if you have 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy?! You’re nothing but a speck of dust before Lord Dragon!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned and he looked at the experts who came along with them. “Are all of them subordinates of the Dragon Overlord too?”

“That’s right! Humph! You can’t possibly imagine how strong the Dragon Overlord is!” Huang Sheng sneered. “Huang Xiaolong, you better think twice.”

The Star Dragon Couple and the rest were flabbergasted when they heard what Meng Tian said.

Dragon Overlord?!

Exterminate half step Universe Gods?!

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong stared at Huang Sheng with a glint of anger in his eyes. “Who the hell cares if he’s the Dragon Overlord?! He can be the Chicken Overlord for all I care! Today, none of you shall escape!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Alright. I had enough fun messing with you guys. It’s time to end this.” Huang Xiaolong said before appearing before the two of them once again. With a simple palm strike, he crushed them into the ground.
