Chapter 2397: Accepting the Inheritance

“That’s right! This is the Four Seas Holy Symbol!” Huang Xiaolong revealed the plaque in his hands to everyone. “I believe all of you know the meaning of the Four Seas Holy Symbol. The one who possesses the symbol is the true successor of the Four Seas Holy Emperor!”

“The symbol represents the Four Seas Holy Emperor! Why aren’t you kneeling!”

Huang Xiaolong growled.

Staring at each other, the Eminent Elders and grand elders revealed a look of hesitation.

“What’s going on? Are you planning to go against the Holy Emperor’s teachings?” Huang Xiaolong snorted. His three saint godheads started to spin as he poured energy into the Four Seas Holy Symbol. In an instant, brilliant rays of light emerged and the phantom of a supreme expert descended.

The phantom was precisely the thread of consciousness the Four Seas Holy Emperor had left in the holy symbol.

When he appeared, the prestige of a True Saint descended and pressed down on everyone present. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s the ancestor!”

Yu Jingjian and the others didn’t hesitate as they got to their knees instantly.

Waving his hand, Huang Xiaolong sent out hundred strands of grandmist holy aura. The moment they entered the bodies of the upper echelons of the holy gate, they reacted instantaneously.

“You... what did you just do to us?!” Bi Cheng stared at Huang Xiaolong as fire spewed from his eyes.

“It’s nothing. I merely laid down a single set of restriction in your bodies.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “With just a thought, I will be able to make you disappear from existence.”

The faces of Yu Jingjian and the others turned ashen the moment they heard what he said.

“You!” Bi Cheng roared and prepared to lunge at Huang Xiaolong, but Huang Xiaolong was a little bit faster. He activated the strand of grandmist holy aura in Bi Cheng’s body and a miserable shriek rang through the air. It didn’t take long for him to be reduced into nothing but strands of grandmist aura.

In the next instant, Huang Xiaolong devoured the aura Bi Cheng had turned into.

Yu Jingjian and the other Eminent Elders couldn’t help but reveal a face of despair when they noticed what happened to Eminent Elder Bi Cheng.

“Is there anyone else who doesn’t believe me?” Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across everyone present and asked.

He knew that none of them would accept him as the new patriarch of the Four Seas Holy Gate even if he had the Four Seas Holy Symbol. As such, he had decided to send a strand of grandmist holy aura into their bodies.

Killing Bi Cheng seemed to have frightened everyone else.

The look in his eyes caused the Eminent Elders of the Four Seas Holy Gate to tremble as they quickly swore their allegiance to him. Those who wanted to be like Bi Cheng and go against Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but dispel all thoughts of resistance.

If Huang Xiaolong would have shown up with the symbol without the strength to back himself up, there was no way for him to take control of the entire Holy Gate. However, everything was different now that he had the lives of the upper echelons of the Four Seas Holy Gate in his hands.

After controlling Yu Jingjian and the others, Huang Xiaolong felt that controlling anyone under them would be a waste of time.

Passing down his first order after gaining control of the Four Seas Holy Gate, Huang Xiaolong ordered for them to repair the grand formation. That wasn’t all. As soon as it was rebuilt, they were to fully open the grand formation in case anything happened to him during the time he spent receiving the inheritance. Moreover, all the disciples were prohibited from leaving the Holy Gate. At the same time, he ordered for all the transmission symbols to be confiscated.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be at ease. He arranged for all one thousand four hundred and thirty-two profound beasts to guard the surroundings.

With the grand formation they laid out, even if the hall masters and disciples from the Four Seas Holy Gate wanted to send out a warning to Lu Ding, they wouldn’t be able to do so.

After all, Lu Ding was working with the Beast Tamer Holy Gate. If he got wind of what Huang Xiaolong wanted to do, he would request for the experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate to return with him and that would cause a lot of uncertainties. Accepting the inheritance in peace would be impossible.

Of course, there was always the choice of revealing his identity.

However, if he did that, the Devil Palace would probably lay down the order to hunt him down immediately.

From what Yu Jingjian and the others had reported, Lu Ding seemed to have left for the Profound River with the experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate. It seemed as though the black corpse had truly attracted all sorts of powers.

“I wonder how Lin Xiaoying is doing...?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but wonder.

The Black Corpse Devil Cave was terrifying, and Huang Xiaolong was extremely clear about the dangers they possessed. Even Third Heaven True Saint Realm experts wouldn’t be able to leave if they were a little careless. If not for the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, the Darkness Holy Ring, and the support of countless high-grade holy spiritual jade stones, Huang Xiaolong might still have been trapped in there.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong learned more about what Lu Ding wanted to do. According to the Eminent Elders, he had planned to head over to the Ghost Devil City after going to the Profound River and he was going be back in several tens of years.

A trace of joy appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

It was entirely possible for him to complete the inheritance process before Lu Ding returned.

After arranging the daily affairs of the Holy Gate, Huang Xiaolong left for the forbidden region of the Four Seas Holy Gate with Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage.

As for the rest of the profound beats, Huang Xiaolong left them in the main hall of the Holy Gate in case anything happened.

An hour quickly passed and Huang Xiaolong arrived in the deepest part of the forbidden region.

Stopping right outside the land of inheritance, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Four Seas Holy Symbol and used the secret method he had learned in the past to activate it. As the phantom of the Four Seas Holy Emperor appeared behind him, dense runes appeared in the space before him.

The restrictions that appeared out of nowhere were precisely those the Four Seas Holy Emperor had set up in the past.

When the restrictions became visible, Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread. Even with their strength, they knew that they wouldn’t be able to force their way through. Luckily for them, they didn’t act recklessly. Otherwise, their bodies would have already been torn to shreds.

A formation arranged by a mid-level True Saint wasn’t something they could mess around with.

With the appearance of the phantom, the restrictions were broken one by one and eventually, a clear path into the forbidden region could be seen.

One would only be able to shatter the restrictions with the Four Seas Holy Symbol. That was also the reason Lu Ding was unable to receive the Four Seas Holy Emperor’s inheritance even after so many years. That wasn’t all. Without the symbol, even if a high-level True Saint shattered the restrictions at the entrance, they wouldn’t be able to receive the inheritance.

As soon as he shattered the restrictions, Huang Xiaolong led the two of them deeper into the forbidden region. Stepping past the entrance, the restrictions outside reactivated. Even if Lu Ding decided to return early, he would need to shatter the restriction if he wanted to stop Huang Xiaolong.

Not too long after he entered the forbidden region, Huang Xiaolong saw the Four Seas Holy Manor located on a nearby mountain peak.

That was the location of the inheritance!

“You guys should wait outside.” Huang Xiaolong turned and spoke to the two of them. “Without my order, no one is allowed to enter.”

“Yes, Young Master!” They replied in unison as a solemn expression appeared on their faces. With their experience, they knew that one shouldn’t be disturbed when accepting an inheritance.

If anyone were to break his concentration during the process, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t just fail to receive the inheritance, but it was more than likely that he would be devoured by the power of the inheritance.
