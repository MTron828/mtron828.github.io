Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s decision to return two months later if they didn’t find anything, the little cow nodded in agreement, “That’s a feasible plan, return earlier to make the necessary preparations. You’ll soon be able to see your Li Lu after the All-Islands Great War.”

At the mentioned of Li Lu, her dainty face appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

“Also, the thing sealed under the Hundred Beasts Summit is very likely the Ancestral Dragon Fruit,” The little cow reminded and continued, “If we return earlier, we can go to the Hundred Beasts Summit and take the Ancestral Dragon Fruit. With it, you can break through to Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm"

Huang Xiaolong nodded, what the little cow said was precisely his plan.

This was also the reason why he wished to go back earlier.

At that time, he failed to break the seal on the Hundred Beasts Summit, now he had the Black Baboon, the seal would no longer be a hindrance.

Night arrived in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, and the surrounding devil qi became denser still.

On this night, Huang Xiaolong was standing on flat ground on a mountain slope, staring at boundless space. From time to time, the mundane night would be broken by magic beasts, ghouls, and evil spirits’ cries.

As Huang Xiaolong was contemplating, the mountain he was on shook violently all of a sudden. In the second after, the whole mountain broke apart, shattered rocks shooting out in all directions.

Huang Xiaolong saw the little cow rush out from the cave to his side, both looked tense and wary.

They immediately saw a giant insect resembling a centipede drill out from the ground.

The centipede was over a hundred thousand meters long and had numerous long legs extending a few hundred meters, glistening with chilling coldness. Its eyes were akin to twins lakes, it’s aura earth-shattering.

“Ancient variant Thousand Legs Worm!” The little cow shouted in astonishment, quickly adding, “Its entire body is toxic.”

On top of that, this Thousand Legs Worm’s strength was likely to be Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, even late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm!

“Run!” Huang Xiaolong shouted.

Huang Xiaolong summoned the Black Baboon from the Xumi Temple, bringing him and the little cow, away from the mountain in a flicker through teleportation.

When the Thousand Legs Worm saw that its attack did not injure Huang Xiaolong, a sharp shrill roar reverberated through the air, traveling thousands of miles. With a swing of its tail, it chased up to Huang Xiaolong.

Its blade-sharp pointed leg slashed at him.

The Black Baboon teleported once more with Huang Xiaolong and the little cow, barely dodging the Thousand Legs Worm’s lethal attack as the sharp edge of its leg brushed past Huang Xiaolong right cheek.

The previous mountain below ceased to exist, split and shattered by the Thousand Legs Worm, crumbling to the ground.

Huang Xiaolong reached up to touch his cheek, feeling his palm wet with blood flowing out from a long blade cut. But the cut soon disappeared, healed without any scarring.

Ever since he broke through to peak late-Ninth Order Heavenly God Realm, his True Divine Dragon Physique’s healing ability had reached a shocking degree.

Seeing that the tiny human once again dodged its attack, the Thousand Legs Worm let out an angry roar. Its eyes turned a creepy red, glinting with malice. Its speed increased several times, catching up to Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong looked up at the Thousand Legs Worm’s leg cutting down on him, looking unexpectedly calm. In the next second, a bright light burst out from his body, causing a majestic dragon might to sweep out like a tempest as a resounding dragon roar filled the air, as if coming from the primordial times.

Huang Xiaolong transformed into a primordial divine dragon. His tail flicked and the Thousand Legs Worm’s attack missed his vital organs, but made a long cut across Huang Xiaolong’s dragon body.

Dragon scales splintered, blood spurting out like arrows.

“Master, are you alright?!” The little cow shouted.

“I’m fine!” Huang Xiaolong shook his head.

At this time, the Thousand Legs Worm’s front blades once again struck down, drawing several thousand long blades light in the dark sky. In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow and the Black Baboon were about to be split into two, when suddenly, the blade light shattered as a giant black hole appeared where they were.

An irresistible suction force came from the black hole, pulling the Thousand Legs Worm into it in an instant, followed by Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the Black Baboon.

Against the terrifying suction force, Huang Xiaolong and the others were powerless to resist. The world swirled upside down in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, arriving in a foggy gray space.

That ferocious Thousand Legs Worm was nowhere in sight. Huang Xiaolong frowned as he surveyed the unfamiliar surroundings, ‘Where is this exactly?’

He had a feeling they were no longer in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

“This space should a naturally formed independent space.” The little cow was also bewildered as it looked around. A naturally formed independent space was rarer than rare. Never had it imagined they would be sucked into an independent space in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!

“How do we get out of here?” A very crucial question came to Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

If they couldn’t leave, did that mean they would die in entrapment?

The little cow replied, “A naturally formed independent space like this has no exit, but there is a way to get out of any independent space.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. It seems they had no choice but to look for the exit slowly.

The All-Islands Great War was always on Huang Xiaolong’s mind, and he didn’t have much time. He had find a way to leave this space within a year.

After deciding on a direction, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow flew forward with the Black Baboon following closely behind them.

Huang Xiaolong was soon astounded at the vastness of this place, far surpassing his and the little cow’s imagination. One month later, they still hadn’t seen the edge of the independent space!

At their speed, they could have circled the Green Cloud Mountain in one month.

As time passed, Huang Xiaolong began to feel anxious.

A few more days passed when Huang Xiaolong stopped abruptly, looking at the vast space in front of him where a ten thousand zhang long bright purple dragon was hovering.

Purple dragon!

How could there be a purple dragon in this independent space?

‘No, not right, not a purple dragon!’ Having the twin dragons martial spirits, and having refined several pieces of Ancestral Dragon Tree bark that contained the Ancestral Dragon aura, Huang Xiaolong was extremely sensitive toward the Dragon Clan’s presence. But the ‘dragon’ in front of him had no dragon aura whatsoever.

“That, that—that’s purple grandmist aura!” The little cow’s sharp excited shriek sounded in Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

Purple grandmist aura!!

Huang Xiaolong’s body shook slightly. They had set out to find the grandmist aura, but what was this purple grandmist aura?

“The quality of grandmist aura is also divided into high and low, the highest quality is precisely this purple grandmist aura, exuding a bright purple light. The purple grandmist aura in front of us is close to evolution, the dragon you see is the form taken by the purple grandmist aura. “Master, if you refine this purple grandmist aura, then...!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The latter part needed no explanation.

Huang Xiaolong was close to whooping with joy and excitement. Who would have thought purple grandmist aura would be inside this independent space!

Huang Xiaolong was unable to calm down for a long time.

Right at this time, the purple grandmist aura dragon flew toward Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden.
