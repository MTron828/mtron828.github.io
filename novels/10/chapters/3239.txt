Chapter 3240: Injured Qi Veins

Even the kid they called Huang Datou was stunned. Huang Xiaolong was too damn handsome! It was so much so that they couldn’t even describe it in words! The aura he emitted made them feel extremely attracted to him.

Huang Bo was handsome, and he could stand out from the crowd. Even among the thousands of disciples in the Huang Family, he was someone who had extraordinary looks. However, he was as ugly as a toad when compared to Huang Xiaolong.

“How can someone be so handsome?!” The female disciple of the Huang Family stared at Huang Xiaolong and screamed in infatuation.

“Who are you?! How dare you mess about with matters of our Donglin’s Huang Family?!” Huang Bo quickly snapped back to reality and he glared at Huang Xiaolong with anger in his eyes. He couldn’t control the envy towards Huang Xiaolong’s looks, and jealousy burned in his heart.

It was especially so when he saw the way the female disciple stared at Huang Xiaolong.

The Huang Family was the strongest cultivation family in the DongLin Province, and disciples of the family would use the name of the Huang Family every time they saw other cultivators.

After all, everyone in the Huaxia Alliance knew about them!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t give half a shit about Huang Bo. Turning to the kid they called Huang Datou, he asked, “Did he steal your Snow Jade Rabbit?”

It was evident the kid didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would speak to him, and he nodded in haste. “Yeah! I captured the Jade Snow Rabbit myself in order to use its blood essence to help my father’s injured qi veins!”

Turning to Huang Bo, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Return the rabbit.”

Laughing in rage, Huang Bo sneered in anger, “Brat, are you trying to command me?! Who the f*ck do you think you are? Do you really think you’re unstoppable because you look like a damn sissy? F*ck off right now! If you butt into my matters, you won’t live to see tomorrow!”

The Huang Family was a supreme existence in the Donglin Province. With Huang Bo’s identity, not too many people dared to mess with him. Even Golden Core Realm cultivators would have to greet him respectfully as Young Master Huang Bo when they ran into him!

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a Golden Core Realm cultivator. As soon as the words left his lips, a slap landed on his face. A miserable shriek came soon after, and Huang Bo was sent flying into a random ditch on the street. Mud smeared all over his face, and his appearance was wretched to the extreme.

Everyone on the street stared at the scene in shock.

They looked at Huang Bo like it was the first time they had seen him.

Even though his body was covered in filth, the giant palm print on his face was clear for all to see. His cheek was several times the size it was, and Huang Bo turned into an actual pig head!

“You!” Huang Bo raged and he pointed at Huang Xiaolong. However, a tooth popped out from his mouth the moment he opened it.

At least half the teeth in his mouth were dislodged from his gums with that slap from Huang Xiaolong.

“If you speak another word, I’ll make sure you no longer have teeth.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

The Snow Jade Rabbit that was in Huang Bo’s arms made its move the moment Huang Bo was distracted. Leaping out of Huang Bo’s grasp, it fled with extreme speed. It moved more than a thousand feet in the blink of an eye, and Huang Datou started to panic. Right before he could give chase, Huang Xiaolong reached out and the rabbit appeared in his hands.

Everyone who saw what happened felt their jaws dropping in shock.

“Using qi externally!” Huang Bo, Huang Susu, and the other member of the Huang Family felt a bomb going off in their heads.

Only experts who had surpassed the Xiantian Realm could do something like that. The man before them was at the very least an expert who had surpassed the Xiantian Realm!

However, even Ninth Level Xiantian Realm experts wouldn’t be able to use their qi more than a thousand meters away. One definitely had to be in the Foundation Building Realm to do so!

“Lord…” Huang Datou stared at Huang Xiaolong and uttered.

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he handed the rabbit over.

“Many thanks to Lord for the generous gift!”

“Heh. You’re just a cultivator in the Foundation Building Realm.” Huang Bo sneered.

Foundation Building Realm cultivators might be an expert in the eyes of commoners, but they were nothing in the eyes of members of the Huang Family.

After all, the guest elders in the Huang Family could crush Foundation Building Realm cultivators with ease.

Ignoring Huang Bo, Huang Xiaolong turned to Huang Datou and laughed, “Is your grandfather really Huang Jiyuan?”

“Lord, do you know my grandfather?!” The kid was stunned for a second before yelling in shock.

“Of course! I’m extremely familiar with him.”

Familiar… Being the other party’s son would count, right?

Huang Bo and the others were stunned.

The youngster before them knew Huang Jiyuan!

“Let’s go meet your grandfather!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily.

Huang Datou snapped back to reality and a look of excitement could be seen on his face. “Lord, are you my grandfather’s friend?!”

Black lines formed on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, but a cheeky smile soon formed on his face. Nodding slightly, he didn’t bother explaining himself.

Huang Bo’s expression fell when he saw Huang Xiaolong leaving with the kid.

“Big Brother Huang Bo, what do we do now?” The other male disciple of the Huang Family asked.

“We’ll head on back! When we do, we shall get Guest Elder Chen Yu to make a move. Get some people to keep an eye on that kid in case he leaves the Donglin Province!”

“Big Brother Huang Bo, you can rest assured. Even if the kid is in the Golden Core Realm, he won’t be able to escape!” Huang Cheng laughed.

Huang Susu stared at Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure with hearts in her eyes.

When Huang Bo saw the look on her face, the anger in his heart reignited with even more passion. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Susu, let’s go.”

Nodding her head, she turned to look at Huang Bo whose head was swollen. Laughing uncontrollably, she couldn’t describe the look on Huang Bo’s face.

A tinge of red crept up Huang Bo’s face as his expression sank.

…

As Huang Xiaolong followed the kid along the streets, he could tell that the little brat was extremely happy from the way he was chattering.

“Are you really called Huang Datou?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask. After all, the kid should be his nephew.

However, when he left earth in the past, he only had a single sister… Could his parents have given birth to another son after he left?

“No!” Huang Datou sighed in embarrassment and he explained, “I’m called Huang Bisheng, but everyone called me Huang Datou because of my head…”

“However, Lord can call me Huang Datou like everyone else.” The kid laughed.

“Hehe, that sounds pretty good.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Rubbing his head, Huang Bisheng chuckled helplessly.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about Huang Jiyuan and his mother, Wang Meilan. He also asked about Huang Bisheng’s father.

When Huang Xiaolong heard that Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan were reaching the end of their lifespans, his heart sank. From what Huang Bisheng said, they would only be able to hold out for two more years at best. From his estimations, his mother would only live for another year, a feeling of fear swept through his heart before he heaved a sigh of relief.

He was relieved that he made it back in time. With his abilities, there was no way they could die. Luckily for him, he returned in time…

“What happened to your father’s qi veins?” Huang Xiaolong asked.
