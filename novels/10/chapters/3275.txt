Chapter 3276: Zhang Rui

Huang Xiaolong’s group of three drove over.

The three of them got into the car with Huang Datou in the driver’s seat, while Huang Xiaolong and Huang Chenfei sat in the back.

"Brother, I’ve heard that the Longxing Commerce is auctioning a lot of Sun Moon Spiritual Fruit Tree’s seeds, as many as three hundred. Other than the Sun Moon Spiritual Fruit Tree’s seeds, there are also other rare spiritual fruit trees’ seeds. There is also going to be the Bodhi Blessing Fruit and Golden Glazed Jade Fruit!" Huang Chenfei happily shared with Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded. "That’s even better. We’ll buy them all since there is plenty of land anyway."

The Sun Moon Spiritual Fruit was one of the rarer high-grade spiritual fruits on Earth. The Dralephant Fruit, Bodhi Blessing Fruits, and Golden Glazed Jade Fruit were just as precious.

Huang Datou looked over his shoulder and chimed in, "But, Uncle, there are a lot of people vying for the Longxing Commerce’s Sun Moon Spiritual Fruit Tree. Many of the Sun Family’s and Tan Family’s elders are coming. I’ve heard even the Tan Family’s Grand Elder Tan Jian has come!"

Hearing Huang Datou bring up the Tan Family’s grand elder, Tan Jian, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, "The same Tan Jian we ran into at the bank the last time?"

A momentary awkwardness flitted across Huang Datou’s face as he nodded. "Yes Uncle, in truth, he’s Tan Wei’s second great-granduncle!"

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know that. "He’s Tan Wei’s second great-granduncle? Why didn’t you say so at that time?"

Huang Datou seemed even more awkward, and his words were almost inaudible. " Tan Wei and I are just normal friends, so…" So, he hadn’t told Huang Xiaolong about Tan Jian’s relationship with Tan Wei.

Huang Chenfei failed to follow Huang Datou and Huang Xiaolong’s conversation. "Tan Wei? Who is Tan Wei?"

Hearing his father’s question, Huang Datou blushed down to his neck. In truth, he had never told his father about Tan Wei. Neither Huang Jiyuan nor Wang Meilan knew about it. Huang Xiaolong was the only person to know.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Huang Datou and grinned at Huang Chenfei. "This brat likes a girl called Tan Wei, and she’s a Tan Family disciple." He then briefly recounted what had happened between Huang Datou and Tan Wei ten years ago.

Huang Chenfei’s eyes widened the more he listened. My son has been crushing on someone for a decade?! Ten years, and I only learned about it today?

He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he shot a strong glare at his son, "Smelly brat, how many more things are you hiding from me?"

The subsequent time in the car, Huang Datou faced "interrogation" from his father down to Tan Wei’s hip measurement.

Huang Datou looked speechlessly at his father through the rearview mirror, and complained, "Dad, what has it got to do with you how big other people’s people butt is!"

But Huang Chenfei raised his voice righteously, "Of course it’s important to have a big butt because a woman with a big butt bears children well. Our family doesn’t have many offspring."

Indeed, counting Huang Xiaolong, Huang Jiyuan’s descendants only consisted of five people!

Huang Datou did not retort and looked helplessly at his uncle. Huang Xiaolong’s lips were pressed together as he tried to stifle his smile, agreeing with a serious expression, "The size of the rear is very important, the future of our line lies with you."

Huang Datou was agape with disbelief that he would hear such a statement from his uncle.

"Smelly brat, did you hear that? Even your Uncle agrees with me!" Huang Chenfei was even more confident with Huang Xiaolong siding with him. He lectured Huang Datou righteously.

Huang Datou’s expression crumbled.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, watching this warm scene. Coming back to Earth this time, it was not bad to experience a mortal life again. Although it had only been five days, Huang Xiaolong could feel the changes in his dao heart, a change for the better.

Huang Xiaolong’s family on Earth had always been a regret in his heart. If he didn’t have a chance to make up for this regret, it would certainly affect Huang Xiaolong’s advancement into the God of Creation Realm, because this regret was big enough to give birth to a devil heart when he crossed tribulation to the God of Creation Realm. Although Huang Xiaolong could have forcefully suppressed this heart devil, it would be a seed waiting to sprout at the opportune time.

A while later, the three of them arrived at Longxing Commerce, located in Huazhou City’s trading market area.

There was a fleet of luxurious cars parked in front of the Longxing Commerce’s main entrance, from BMW, Mercedes, Rolls Royce, and even cars with a price tag of several hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones.

Huang Datou’s BMW was merely considered medium-range amongst these cars.

After the car was parked, Huang Datou suddenly exclaimed, "Uncle, look, it’s that BMW!"

This time, they took Huang Datou’s yellow BMW and parked it not far away from a similar yellow-colored BMW. It was the same latest model. Huang Xiaolong smiled as he took a glance at the car plate. "What a coincidence."

This same model BMW was the car they had seen outside of the Swiss Bank branch. It looked like the Zou Family disciple who had mocked them for not being able to afford to buy a car was also there.

He remembered that Zou Family’s disciple had threatened to send him to prison.

Noticing Huang Datou and Huang Xiaolong’s expressions, Huang Chenfei asked them about it, and Huang Datou told him about the incident at the Swiss Bank branch.

"Zou Family!" Huang Chenfei didn’t look very good.

The Zou Family was a giant within the Huaxia Alliance, and even the previous Huang Family's status was a head shorter when facing the Zou Family.

"Brother, the Zou Family’s old ancestor is someone who has advanced to high-level Enlightenment Realm!" Huang Chenfei reminded Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong merely nodded nonchalantly as the three of them entered the Longxing Commerce Building.

After learning that Huang Xiaolong’s group had come to participate in the auction, the Longxing Commerce’s welcoming disciple led them to the auction hall while introducing, "Because of overwhelming response to the Sun Moon Spiritual Fruit Tree’s seeds, the management has decided to offer the seeds through an auction. Other seeds will also be auctioned."

Huang Xiaolong nodded. In his opinion, the auction method was even better. The highest bidder would win, which saved him the time and trouble of negotiating. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When Huang Xiaolong’s group of three entered the auction hall, there were already many people waiting for the auction to begin inside. Amongst the one thousand seats prepared, about three hundred to four hundred of them were taken.

Huang Chenfei’s gaze scanned the place, but when he saw the person on a certain seat in the third row, his face tightened with embarrassment, shame, anger, and coldness. Hatred flashed across his face, but there was also a trace of nostalgia.

This silhouette was so familiar to him!

Deeply imprinted on his bones and soul.

The person seemed to sense Huang Chenfei’s gaze and turned around. She was a beautiful lady in her fifties, and when she saw Huang Chenfei’s face, she was just as shocked, seemingly a little flustered.

Huang Xiaolong noticed his younger brother’s abnormality and asked, "Who is it?"

"Zhang Rui!" Huang Chenfei answered through gritted teeth. His voice was extremely low and hoarse, and filled with clear anger and hatred.

Huang Datou trembled—Zhang Rui!

It was the woman who had abandoned him and his father and remarried an elder from the Sun Family.

Zhang Rui had remarried when he was thirteen. Since then, he had not seen her even once. After so many years, though Zhang Rui’s appearance had changed slightly with age, had it not been for his father pointing her out, Huang Datou wouldn’t have recognised that the fifty-plus woman was his mother.

At this time, Zhang Rui saw Huang Chenfei. While shocked, she was baffled. Clearly, she was baffled as to why Huang Chenfei could get out of bed? Didn’t they say Huang Chenfei had been bedridden for a long time?
