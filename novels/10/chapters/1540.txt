When Tian Ziyi heard the mocking laughter of those below him, he became completely enraged.

With his identity as an elder of the Brightness Emperor Palace, he would have been revered and respected wherever he went. Even those hall masters who were from the top hundred Emperor Palaces wouldn’t disrespect him like this.

Just as Tian Ziyi was about to strike out, another elder from the Brightness Emperor Palace, Bai Yunxiang, spoke, “Are you Huang Xiaolong from the Fortune Emperor Palace?”

His gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone was shocked.

Since someone had already guessed his identity, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to hide it any longer. He nodded his head and said, “You’re right, I’m Huang Xiaolong.”

The disciples from the Brightness Emperor Palace were startled.

King of supreme godhead, Huang Xiaolong!

Even the elders from Brightness Emperor Palace were shocked at his revelation.

“It turns out that you’re actually Huang Xiaolong from the Fortune Emperor Palace.” Tian Zi immediately frowned, “Huang Xiaolong, even though you have a king of supreme godhead, at the end of the day, you are just a disciple from Fortune Emperor Palace. Even if your master, Zhao Lei, was here, he would still have to be polite to us.”

Even though he didn’t state it explicitly, it was clear that he expected Huang Xiaolong to know his place and grovel beneath their feet.

There was a hint of arrogance in his voice, as though he was teaching a junior a lesson!

A cold smile revealed itself on Huang Xiaolong’s face, “What do you mean? Even my master has to be polite when he sees you? I don’t even know who you are. In fact, I don’t even want to know who you are. If you’re done here, you can get lost. Can’t you see we’re trying to have dinner?”

If it wasn’t because they were from the Brightness Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong would have already allowed Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel to trample these guys into the ground.

Tian Ziyi’s face turned unsightly after the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

What does he mean he doesn’t know who we are? The clothes on our body are a dead giveaway!

Even Bai Yunxiang frowned as he felt that Huang Xiaolong was simply too proud and arrogant. Even if he had a king of supreme godhead, he was still a disciple of the Fortune Emperor Palace at the end of the day. Moreover, he was just a God King Realm disciple... Whether or not he would be able to mature smoothly to become a powerhouse would be another story.

Not to mention the fact that even if he was able to mature in the next several tens of millions of years, with the status and strength of the Brightness Emperor Palace, they still didn’t need to show him respect.

Even an Emperor didn’t dare to offend the Brightness Emperor Palace.

“Huang Xiaolong, to tell you the truth, we received news that there are a few low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins in the vicinity of Heaven Eye Mountain Range. We have a reason to suspect that you have found them and kept them for yourself. On the account of your Master, Zhao Lei, if you hand over your spatial ring, and we don’t find any spiritual veins, we won’t make things difficult for you.” Bai Yunxiang demanded.

Huang Xiaolong sneered in response, “Even if I found the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins, why should I hand it over to you? Why would I even dream of handing my spatial ring over? Did you carve your name into the spiritual veins?!”

It was true. Even if Huang Xiaolong came into possession of the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins, they had no rights to force him to hand it over. They didn’t belong to the Brightness Emperor Palace anyway.

When those from the Brightness Emperor Palace heard Huang Xiaolong’s reply, their expression turned gloomy.

Tian Ziyi sneered, “I guess you really obtained those low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins...”

After hearing what Huang Xiaolong had said, Tian Ziyi mistakenly thought that Huang Xiaolong had found the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins.

All of a sudden, Bai Yunxiang spoke out, “Huang Xiaolong, how about this... Taking into account Zhao Lei and Fang Gan, we won’t inspect your spirit rings. I heard that you defeated Wang Yongsen during your welcoming ceremony in the Fortune Emperor Palace and won a few low-grade chaos spiritual veins. You definitely have them on you right now.”

He paused for a while before continuing, “In fact, you can keep the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins that you found. We want two of the ones you obtained from Wang Yongsen.

From Bai Yunxiang’s point of view, this was a fair trade. He felt that the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins in the Heaven Eye Mountain Range were the Brightness Emperor Palace’s to begin with. Since he had already found the demonic chaos spiritual veins, can’t he hand over two random low-grade chaos spiritual veins?!

The little cow was no longer able to control her laughter. “I never thought you two elders from the Brightness Emperor Palace would be clowns...”

The low-grade chaos spiritual veins that Huang Xiaolong won from Wang Yongsen contained pure spirit qi, whereas the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins in the wilderness were polluted with devil qi. Be it the price or quality, the difference between the two was too huge.

Who would have thought that the Brightness Emperor Palace would behave so outrageously to set their sights on Huang Xiaolong’s low-grade chaos spiritual veins!

“So, you are not going to pay up?” Tian Ziyi’s eyes flashed coldly and a vicious smile appeared on his face. “Since you can’t seem to cherish your chance at living, you can’t blame us for taking everything you have!”

All of it!

Before allowing the disciples of the Brightness Emperor Palace to make a move, Tian Ziyi shot towards Huang Xiaolong, planning to capture him before he could react.

“Demon Sealing Spirit Claw!”

An invisible giant hand of light materialized above Huang Xiaolong and pressed downwards.

The entire sky seemed to be blotted out by the humongous hand made of light and the devil qi in the atmosphere dissipated. It was as though the claw had the ability to purify all sorts of devil qi.

Seeing the giant claw was about to reach Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel shot into action at the same time.

Xiang Yun opened his mouth and generated a rolling ball of hellfire before launching it towards the claw. After smashing apart the claw, it flew towards Tian Ziyi at shocking speed.

Meanwhile, the Chaos Black Camel unleashed the Nine Demonic Howl at full strength.

In the next instant, everyone from the Brightness Emperor Palace was sent flying and copious amounts of blood came spurting out of their mouths. Their silver white gowns became a bloody mess.

A terrified look flashed in his eyes and Tian Ziyi’s arrogance evaporated. He didn’t dare to believe his eyes as his gaze fell onto Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel.

Who are they?! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

To be able to injure a late-Third Order Heavenly Monarch like him with several casual attacks wasn’t something ordinary Heavenly Monarchs could do. Only demonic beasts above the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm could do something like that.

Who would have thought that this ordinary elephant and black camel were actually Tenth Order Heavenly Monarchs?!

Now the only thing he wanted to know was their cultivation level. Are they in the early, middle, or late stage of the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?!

Of course, he didn’t consider the possibility of them being in the Emperor Realm. Afterall, no one would ever expect a mere God King Ream disciple from the Fortune Emperor Palace to have Emperor Realm experts guarding him.

That was Bai Yunxiang’s thought as well.

“Huang Xiaolong, was it Fang Gan and Zhao Lei who gave you these two demonic beasts? It seems like the Fortune Emperor Palace is pulling out all the stops to protect the King of Supreme Godhead... They even sent two Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm demonic beasts to protect you. In that case we will admit defeat today! Let’s go!” Bai Yunxiang stood up and prepared to leave.

Seeing that stealing the low-grade chaos spiritual veins from Huang Xiaolong was a lost cause, he planned to return another day to settle the debt.

“Leave? Who let you leave?!” The little cow piped up all of a sudden.
