“Do you know what Master wants to talk to me about?” Huang Xiaolong casually asked his Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun.

Liu Yun shook his head, “About this, Master did not mention it at all.”

“I guess it might be related to Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday banquet.” said Qi Wen.

Huang Xiaolong was baffled, “Saint Mother Yao chi?”

Qi Wen laughed at Huang Xiaolong’s expression, “In the last God Ranking Battle, in the first place was the Azure Dragon Institute’s Principal Qin Yi, while our Master Feng Yang was second, but Junior Apprentice-brother doesn’t know who the first place holder was in the battle before the last one, right? It was Saint Mother Yao Chi.”

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised, he didn’t expect this Saint Mother Yao Chi to be the first place winner of the second last term of the God Ranking Battle!

Regardless of which term of the God Ranking Battle it was, the winners undeniably stood at the top amongst Highgod Realm masters.

Liu Yun added, “Although Saint Mother Yao Chi is the winner of the second last term, she went into seclusion right after she won, rarely appearing. Furthermore, the place where she cultivates is located in the Azure Dragon Galaxy, a world surface called Great Lake World. Therefore, it isn’t strange that Junior Apprentice-brother has never heard of her.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, so this Saint Mother Yao Chi comes from the Azure Dragon Galaxy.

“In a few weeks, it will be Saint Mother Yao Chi’s fifty thousandth birthday and she’s holding a celebration banquet, inviting various masters from all over.” Liu Yun went on, “But I’m not sure if this is related to why Master wanted to see you. He didn’t reveal anything to me, he only told us to come here and have you make a trip back to the Black Warrior Institute.”

Generally, a Highgod Realm master would hold a birthday celebration every ten thousand years, just like mortals holding celebration banquets when they reached sixty, seventy, eighty, or even ninety years old.

This made Huang Xiaolong think that his Master Feng Yang telling him to return was probably related to this Saint Mother Yao Chi’s banquet.

However, his instinct told Huang Xiaolong that things weren’t so simple.

His Master Feng Yang had been in death seclusion these years, cultivating earnestly. Now that he suddenly exited, it must somehow be related to Saint Mother Yao Chi ’s birthday celebration banquet. Looks like there were undercurrents running behind Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday celebration banquet.

“Junior Apprentice-brother, your Huang Clan Manor’s spiritual energy has become so rich!” While Huang Xiaolong was pondering the reason why his Master wanted to see him, both Liu Yun and Qi Wen were exclaiming as they looked around the Huang Clan Manor. “It’s almost as strong as the Cloudsea Mainland!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I only arranged a grand scale Spirit Amplifying Array in the Huang Clan Manor.”

“Spirit Amplifying Array?” Neither Liu Yun nor Qi Wen ever heard of it. They knew of the common spiritual energy gathering arrays, but not this Spirit Amplifying Array that Huang Xiaolong mentioned. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong openly described to Liu Yun and Qi Wen the Spirit Amplifying Array’s origin and its advantages compared to the general spiritual energy gathering arrays.

At the end, Huang Xiaolong humbly offered, “If Senior Apprentice-brother and Third Apprentice-sister don’t dislike it, I can help arrange one at your peaks when we’re back in the Black Warrior Institute.

“Truly?!” Liu Yun and Qi Wen exclaimed in excitement.

“No, no, of course not!” Liu Yun laughed, then slightly embarrassed as he said, “However, the divine grade spirits stones that are needed...? We...” Even though Liu Yun was one of the Black Warrior Institute’s Grand Elders, he still couldn’t afford to take out the amount of divine grade spirit stones required to arrange a Spirit Amplifying Array. Even if it was a small scale array.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, “Divine grade spirit stones, I have more than enough, of course I’ll take care of the divine grade spirits stones needed for the two Spirit Amplifying Arrays.”

Liu Yun and Qi Wen thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely. Though Huang Xiaolong and the two of them were friendly with each other, this was too big a gift.

Seeing Liu Yun and Qi Wen, the Huang Family and the others were extremely happy, warmly welcoming them.

Many years ago, when the Ying Family Elders attacked the Huang Clan Manor, if it weren’t for Liu Yun and Qi Wen rushing back to Martial Spirit World with Huang Xiaolong at that time, the Huang Clan Manor’s people would have already been one with the great earth by now.

Moreover, during the years they spent in the Black Warrior Institute, Liu Yu and Qi Wen constantly checked on them.

Before the Huang Family’s warm insistence, Liu Yun and Qi Wen stayed for two days in the Huang Clan Manor. On the third morning, they left Martial Spirit World together with Huang Xiaolong, heading back to the Black Warrior Institute.

This time around, they came bearing an order from their Master, so they naturally wouldn’t dare delay for too long.

Before leaving, Huang Xiaolong assured Shi Xiaofei and his family to stay and cultivate at ease in the Huang Clan Manor and await his return.

Considering there was a possibility that he’d be participating in Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday celebration banquet, Huang Xiaolong left the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Huang Hongtian, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, and the other Highgod Realm masters in the Huang Clan Manor.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong, Liu Yun, and Qi Wen arrived back in the Black Warrior Institute, meeting with their Master Feng Yang.

Feng Yang was in good spirits seeing his youngest disciple again.

Telling Huang Xiaolong to come up to him, Feng Yang observed Huang Xiaolong in detail, smiling contently, “I’ve already heard from your Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother and Third Apprentice-sister that you won the first place in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, well done!” then he jokingly added, “Now, even Master needs to dip in your limelight.”

All these years, he had been in seclusion, thus he didn’t know about this until Liu Yun and Qi Wen told him about it a few days ago when he exited seclusion.

Huang Xiaolong grinned good-naturedly, “The fact that disciple can have today’s achievements is all Master’s credit.”

Feng Yang waved his hand, a chuckle sounding from his throat, “You brat, stop flattering me, your success today is the fruit of your own effort and hard work.” Feng Yang was slightly embarrassed as he added, “Master hasn’t been a reliable teacher to you all this time, I barely taught you anything.”

Feng Yang was speaking the truth, Huang Xiaolong’s achievements were largely attributed to his own effort. Most of the time, Feng Yang’s time was divided between his own cultivation and handling mundane tasks for the institute, rarely has any time to teach Huang Xiaolong.

Then again, one of the reasons was also Huang Xiaolong’s monstrous talent, making Feng Yang feel there wasn’t much that he could teach this disciple.

Moments later, the subject changed, with Feng Yang inquiring about the Ascending Moon Old Man and the Huang Family’s well being.

Huang Xiaolong answered all that was asked.

Feng Yang had a strange expression on his face when he heard that the Ascending Moon Old Man went to Vermilion Bird Galaxy’s Fire World.

“Master,” Huang Xiaolong called out, breaking Feng Yang’s thoughts.

“It’s nothing.” Feng Yang changed the subject, looking at Huang Xiaolong, “I also heard from your Senior Apprentice-brother that you’re already a peak late-Eighth Order God Realm?” Feng Yang went on happily, “At this speed, you can probably breakthrough to Tenth Order God Realm by the time the Highgod Advancement Tournament begins!”

Liu Yun chimed in from the side, “With Junior Apprentice-brother’s talent, it’s definitely not an issue to reach Tenth Order God Realm by that time. At that time, a place in the top one hundred spots is within his grasp!”

Huang Xiaolong was dazed and speechless hearing his Master Feng Yang and Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun’s words.

Peak late-Eighth Order God Realm? How many years ago was that?

Breakthrough to Tenth Order God Realm before the Highgod Advancement Tournament begins?

“Kid, what is it? Could it be, you’ve already broken through to Ninth Order God Realm?” Noticing Huang Xiaolong’s odd expression, Feng Yang teased.

Liu Yun and Qi Wen also turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong braced himself and stopped concealing his cultivation. An alarming aura surged around his body.

Before this momentum, both Liu Yun and Qi Wen retreated in panic.

Three people looked at Huang Xiaolong with shock, no, with astonishment.

“Late-Tenth Order God Realm!!” Feng Yang blurted out, unable to control the astonishment, shock, and elation he felt, jumping to his feet and staring at Huang Xiaolong with bright eyes.

Liu Yun and Qi Wen sucked in a breath of cold air.

He wasn’t a peak late-Eighth Order God Realm, nor was he a Ninth Order God Realm! Huang Xiaolong was already a late-Tenth Order God Realm!!
