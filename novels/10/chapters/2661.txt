Chapter 2662: Rising Clouds Commerce

The Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s patriarch, Mo Rui smiled confidently, “That’s right, when Fang Ding trespassed into our Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s headquarters, he almost left his life here. By the time he managed to escape, we had cut off one of his arms, and made him as miserable as could be. Speaking about that, I wonder if his arm has regrown!”

Fang Ding was a Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert from the Alien Lands.

Fang Ding was once a legend in the Alien Lands. There was a time when feeling confident of his strength, Fang Ding had wanted to ransack the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s treasury. In the end, not only Fang Ding had failed to enter their treasury, but he was trapped by the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race. Fang Ding had managed to escape several days later after paying a hefty price.

Hitherto, there was no news of Fang Ding.

Some said that Fang Ding was traumatized by the experience and had gone into hiding. However, regardless of the rumors, the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s prestige had risen to a new height ever since then.

Hearing that, Yuan Qianxing nodded his head, “The power of Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s grand formation is not a secret. If Huang Xiaolong really dares to come, I would have to trouble you all to take action.”

Old Ancestor Mo Jincheng chuckled good-naturedly, “It’s just a small matter, and even if you don’t ask, we would still take action. When we have Huang Xiaolong trapped, we’ll destroy his physical body first, then annihilate his holy soul, and lastly, suppress his Inextinguishable Dao Heart!”

At this time, the communication symbol Mo Jun hung at his waist shook. He brought it up, and when he read the content, his expression turned solemn immediately.

“What’s the matter?” Mo Rui frowned slightly as he asked.

“Father, something happened to Mo Shuo!” Mo Jun quickly passed the communication symbol in his hand to Mo Rui.

Mo Rui’s face changed for the worse after reading the content.

Although Mo Shuo was not the most talented amongst his sons, and this son didn’t please him, Mo Shuo was still his son. Someone killed my son?

Mo Rui passed the communication symbol to Mo Jincheng and Yuan Qianxing. Mo Jincheng’s face sank the moment he read the content.

“Have you found out who did it?” Mo Jincheng asked sternly.

“Not yet,” Mo Jun stood up in a hurry. “But Grand Elder Mo Guang and others who were together with Mo Shuo were killed too. Not one person survived. For now, we only know they were killed at the river mouth.”

Mo Jincheng and Mo Rui were clearly shocked.

“Killed at the river mouth? Then, ninety percent, this person is someone from the Alien Lands.” Yuan Qianxing contemplated, and suddenly blurted out, “Huang Xiaolong?!”

It wasn’t strange that Huang Xiaolong was the first person that popped into Yuan Qianxing’s mind. There weren’t many people that could kill so many Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s experts in such a short time, and that person didn’t seem to be a Primal Ancestor expert.

Therefore, the conclusion was, it could only be Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Mo Jincheng and Mo Rui repeated in unison.

Although they had been talking confidently that they would be able to suppress Huang Xiaolong if he dared to step into the Eight Claw Devil Eye City, it would be a lie to say that they weren’t worried at all. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Even someone like Yuan Qianxing, the Son of Origin, was no match against Huang Xiaolong, then who would dare to look down upon Huang Xiaolong?

“It probably isn’t Huang Xiaolong…?” The Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s young patriarch Mo Jun denied it by reflex.

Yuan Qianxing shook his head and said, “Although this is only my guess, it isn’t impossible. Someone capable of killing so many of Eight Claw Devil Eye Race’s True Saint experts, that person at least has the strength of a peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint and above. However, such an expert would not offend the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race in this manner.”

“Thus, it is very likely to be Huanhg Xiaolong.” Mo Jincheng’s eyes exuded coldness. “I don’t care whether it’s Huang Xiaolong or not, but someone who dares to kill my grandson and so many experts of my Eight Claw Devil Eye Race, I, Mo Jincheng, will kill him!”

“He will die miserably!”

“Pass my order to use all our resources to find the murderer!”

……

After entering the World River, Huang Xiaolong rarely stopped to rest. He almost sprinted all the way to his destination.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong came across more than a few human race groups battling alien races’ disciples.

Even though the World River and Alien Lands couldn’t be considered as harmonious, there were rich mineral resources and jade stones within the World River area, as well as spiritual pearls, and various rare spiritual herbs. Hence, many human and alien races’ experts ventured to the World River to collect these resources for trading.

These human and alien races’ experts were surprised to see Huang Xiaolong traveling alone, and many of them kindly invited Huang Xiaolong to join their teams for safety.

Huang Xiaolong refused with a smile.

When Huang Xiaolong was passing by the World River’s Bright Thunder Basin, he encountered another caravan team that invited him to join them. This caravan team was led by the Rising Clouds Commerce’s Second Miss, Yun Fanger.

Huang Xiaolong had heard that the Rising Clouds Commerce was one of the big trading houses in the Alien Lands. Despite not having any Primal Ancestor Realm experts within the organization, they had a huge number of True Saint experts. The Rising Clouds Commerce had as many branches across the Alien Lands as mushrooms after the rain. Hence, they had astonishing wealth.

But Huang Xiaolong declined Yun Fanger’s invitation just the same. Though there were conveniences in traveling with a caravan, there were also many inconveniences from Huang Xiaolong’s opinion; first of all, a caravan’s speed was too slow, and Huang Xiaolong was in a hurry to reach the Sky Opening Island.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong had declined Yun Fanger’s invitation before turning and flying away without any delay, a crimson-haired young man in Yun Fanger’s team harrumphed coldly, “Really ignorant!”

“Second Miss, if it’s up to me, you don’t need to pity this kind of human!”

Yun Fanger shook her head, “Don’t look down on him because he’s alone. Since he dares to traverse alone in the World River, there must be a reason for it. For us, extending a hand whenever possible means forging a connection that might be useful in the future.”

“Second Miss is right, if I am not mistaken, that young man is not as simple as he looks on the surface. He’s an early Fourth Heaven True Saint,” an old man by Yun Fanger’s side commented.

“Early Fourth Heaven True Saint!” Many of the Rising Clouds Commerce’s experts were astonished hearing the old man’s words.

An early Fourth Heaven True Saint expert was worthy of the commerce’s goodwill. After all, there were not many high-level True Saint experts.

But the crimson-haired young man snorted, “Merely an early Fourth Heaven True Saint. Fourth Heaven True Saint human race experts defeated by me are too many to count. The human race has a weak bloodline, and less than average combat power.”

The crimson-haired young man was one of the Alien Lands’ big families’ disciples. an honorary elder recruited by the Rising Clouds Commerce. He was a late-Third Heaven True Saint Realm expert. His strength was higher than average, and he had records of defeating several early Fourth Heaven True Saint human experts. This was why he was disdainful towards these so-called human race experts.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t aware that he had become a topic of discussion amongst the Rising Clouds Commerce’s caravan team. He continued speeding ahead for an hour, and after seeing that it was getting dark, he stopped on the small island up ahead. After surveying his surroundings, he decided to rest there for the night. He headed to the empty space on the island’s center and built a bonfire.

Huang Xiaolong took out a holy pill and popped it into his mouth. Feeling the weak energy dispersed by the holy pill internally, he shook his head wryly. Ever since his three saint godheads had evolved into the top ten ranks, and his cultivation had advanced to the Fourth Heaven True Saint, the effect of a holy pill on him was negligible. He didn’t even need to refine the holy pill, as his three saint godheads would absorb the holy pill’s energy themselves.

Staring at the bonfire, Huang Xiaolong remembered the days he had spent camping in the wild with the little cow in the lower worlds.

Thinking of the little cow, a chuckle escaped his lips as he wondered how the little cow was doing now.

While Huang Xiaolong was reminiscing of the days in the lower worlds with the little cow, a group of people was flying in his direction from afar. What Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect was, they were the Rising Clouds Commerce’s caravan team.
