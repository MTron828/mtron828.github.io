Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed again, and he arrived at the eye of the formation.

Looking at the Demonic Ghost Pool before him, Huang Xiaolong contemplated for a moment before deciding that it was too annoying to break apart the formation step by step. Without hesitation, he brought out the City of Eternity. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

With the assistance of the one hundred Undead Race Netherguard captains, the City of Eternity seemed to emit a pressure akin to Mt. Tai on the Demonic Ghost Pool. A massive explosion filled the valley as the City of Eternity smashed into the formation.

In an instant, the Demonic Ghost Pool emitted blinding radiance as a horrifying pressure rolled off it.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned and he quickly retreated.

Right before his eyes, the mountain valley, trees, and even the peaks of the mountains all around the formation turned to dust with the shockwave emitted by the Demonic Ghost Pool.

“It didn’t break?!” Huang Xiaolong stared at the formation on the ground in shock.

That was truly out of his expectations.

The might of the City of Eternity was something as clear as day in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Since the Demonic Ghost Pool was a formation laid down by the owner of the four odd beasts, the Archdevil Master, Huang Xiaolong felt that he had finally caught a glimpse into the Archdevil Master’s strength.

It seemed as though he had underestimated the might of the Archdevil Master.

He was afraid that the Archdevil Master was someone way more terrifying than Chu Han.

After hesitating for a moment, Huang Xiaolong brought out the Heavenly Hall as well.

With the City of Eternity and Heavenly Hall slamming into the formation at once, an ear-shattering blast resounded through the lands. The ground around the valley showed signs of cracking, and a massive rift extended throughout the lands.

With the combination of the City of Eternity and the Heavenly Hall, the formation finally started to break.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to let it rest. He continued his bombardment of the Demonic Ghost Pool in the very next instant.

After the fourth time, the formation that was emitting blinding light suddenly stopped. The Demonic Ghost Pool shattered.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. He flew inside the exposed entrance without the slightest hesitation. Soon, he arrived before the divine palace and pushed its doors open.

When he entered the palace, the four odd beasts chained to the massive pillars opened their eyes in unison. These chains were made with an unknown metal.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived before them, he felt as though he had learned something new about them.

They are very powerful!

That was Huang Xiaolong’s first thought when he looked at them.

With the Heart of Hell, Huang Xiaolong was able to feel the horrifying amount of darkness energy surrounding the four beasts.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong had tried to guess their strength. But he was finally able to tell their real strength right now. Each one of them was stronger than the Undead Race’s Netherguard captains in the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

They were definitely terrifying existences at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm! Moreover, they weren’t ordinary experts at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Any single one of them was comparable to the two peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Radiance Angels.

It was no wonder the four odd beasts were revered existences in the Desolate Era.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath, and he looked at the four beasts with a burning gaze.

It was time for him to subdue all four of them!

Even though they were chained to the stone pillars by the metal chains, Huang Xiaolong was cautious enough to release the one hundred Undead Race Netherguard puppets to protect him if anything went wrong.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Heavenly Hall. Under the combined might of the fourteen Radiance Angels, they activated the main formation in the Heavenly Hall to suppress the four odd beasts.

As the Heavenly Hall emitted rays of resplendent light in mid-air, the light formed a cage to trap all four beasts. The initially ferocious beasts with glaring, bloodshot eyes calmed down.

Seeing that they were no longer out for blood, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. As the purple light in his hand grew brighter and brighter, a single grandmist worm flew out and drilled into one of the beasts’ bodies.

As soon as the grandmist worm entered its body, Huang Xiaolong was met with a wave of tyrannical energy full of bloodlust.

His Heart of Hell started to fluctuate, and waves of superior energy from Hell protected his body. Huang Xiaolong suppressed the tyrannical energy that was trying to overwhelm him.

With no other resistance, the grandmist worm pierced straight through the beast and entered the space in its mind.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to subdue the four odd beasts, a different scene played out in some desolate space in the Divine World. Fang Gan was looking at several black-clothed men with an ugly expression on his face.

Every single black-clothed man who surrounded him exuded an overbearing aura. Even if they were weaker than him, they couldn’t be considered to be too much weaker. Out of all of those black-clothed men, there were also two whose aurae surpassed him by a whole lot.

Late-Tenth Order Emperor?!

Fang Gan’s eyes landed on one of the black-clothed men, and a cold light flashed through them. “Zhou Chen, I never thought that you would betray the Fortune Emperor Palace! How dare you collude with the Fiend God Emperor Palace!”

The clothed black man trembled a little before tearing off the cloth covering his face. He revealed his face, and he was precisely Zhou Chen.

Zhou Chen roared with laughter and seemed extremely pleased with himself. “Fang Gan, have you ever thought that something like this could happen to you? What do you mean ‘betray the Fortune Emperor Palace’? From the start, I had never been a member of your Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Fang Gan felt his pupils constrict. What does he mean by that?!

“Did the Fiend God Emperor send you to my Fortune Emperor Palace in the past?” Fang Gan’s gaze turned chilly. He couldn’t imagine that Zhou Chen had hidden so well. In the billions of years that had passed, Fang Gan never managed to uncover his identity.

Zhou Chen didn’t bother replying, and he mocked in a cold voice, “Fang Gan, Hand over the Fortune’s Gate. I will leave you with a whole corpse as long as you hand it over. We know that you aren’t a weakling. However, don’t bother thinking of a way to escape. We have already sealed the space around us with a supreme formation.”

Fang Gan’s face sank. It seemed as though their real motive was the divine artifact in his possession.

The Fortune’s Gate was a grandmist artifact back from the Desolate Era. However, it had been severely damaged since then.

Even though it was a damaged grandmist artifact, it still possessed a terrifying might.

All of a sudden, a massive gate formed above Fang Gan’s head.

The gate was formless. It seemed to be squarish at times, and round at others. It was formed by countless symbols which emitted terrifying fortune energy.

There was an obvious crack on the gate, and even though it wasn’t too large, it weakened the grandmist artifact’s power. Another massive crack on the gate’s upper left side blocked the flow of fortune energy around it.

Fang Gan’s energy grew by several folds the moment he summoned the Fortune’s Gate. With a roar, he threw a punch at Zhou Chen. Simultaneously, the Fortune’s Gate smashed towards a distant space, as though it wanted to break through the formation they had set up.

Boom!

Under the impact of the collision, the void seemed to tremble. The horrifying flow of energy turned into mini dragons that roared in rage.

In the space above them, brilliant rays of blinding light filled the area.

“Humph!”

The two experts at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm made their move when they witnessed the scene before them.

...

In the space under the Demonic Ghost Pool, beads of sweat dripped to the ground from Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. Even though he had broken through to the Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, had the Heart of Hell, and had already reached the fourth level of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, subduing the four odd beasts wasn’t as easy as he had thought; the difficulty far exceeded his imaginations.
