Chapter 2819: I Have No Idea What You Are If You’re Not Trash

The members of the Saint Devil Sacred Land were equally shocked when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Even Fu Daosheng, a peak-level half-step Dao Venerable, wouldn’t be able to take on the Saint Devil Prince’s punch unharmed.

The only way one would be able to take it on without flinching would be if they were actual Dao Venerables!

In fact, even First Esteem Dao Venerables might be slightly affected if they had to take the punch head-on without any defenses. Yet, Huang Xiaolong remained unmoving like a massive chaos rock mountain.

“I told you that you’re trash.” Huang Xiaolong looked at Xu Jian who was wearing an expression of disbelief, and he continued, “Even after letting you gather your strength, you couldn’t even scratch my skin! I have no idea what you are if you’re not trash…”

Couldn’t even scratch the skin on Huang Xiaolong’s body when he stood still to take the attack!

Absolute garbage!

Huang Xiaolong’s voice boomed in Xu Jian’s mind.

As rage finally overwhelmed him, Xu Jian roared, “This is not possible! You can’t possibly be stronger than Dao Venerables! Huang Xiaolong, f*ck you! Go to hell!” Once again, his palms slammed towards Huang Xiaolong.

This time, he didn’t aim for the arms. He was no longer trying to cripple the other party as he wanted nothing more than for Huang Xiaolong to die!

After pushing himself past his limit, it was clear that his current strike was stronger than his last!

Boom!

A massive explosion rang through the skies when his palms slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s solid chest.

Yi Xiaotang watched on with an incredulous gaze as Huang Xiaolong didn’t even flinch.

“This… How can this be?” Aunt Qing muttered under her breath.

That isn’t possible!

She couldn’t think of a reason how Huang Xiaolong could withstand the Saint Devil Prince’s attacks. In her eyes, he was nothing more than a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

She expected him to be an existence weaker than an ant compared to Xu Jian, but looking at how things were playing out, Xu Jian seemed to be the ant!

As the person in question, Xu Jian felt the world spin around him as he couldn’t understand what was going on. He knew how strong he was, and his full-powered strike had seemed like it had landed on the Divine Tuo Holy World when it had come into contact with Huang Xiaolong’s body.

That was right. He felt as though his attack had slammed into the Divine Tuo Holy World.

As an upper-level world, the Divine Tuo Holy World could take on the attacks of Dao Venerables for several quadrillion years without suffering the slightest bit of damage! Even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables were nothing before the Divine Tuo Holy World.

At that moment, the Saint Devil Prince was comparable to a speck of dust before Huang Xiaolong. Even though it might sound exaggerated, that was truly the case!

No longer planning to mess around, a terrifying surge of energy came from within Huang Xiaolong’s body. The moment it emerged, he forced the Saint Devil Prince back and sent him crashing into the islands several dozen thousand miles away.

As dust and debris filled the air, the members of the Saint Devil Sacred Land rushed over to check on him.

“Your Highness!”

Frightened cries came from them.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on showing mercy. With a single step to cross the massive distance between them, Huang Xiaolong punched downwards. The Saint Devil Prince went smashing through several layers of earth, and he finally slammed into the bottom of the river several dozen thousand feet below.

The uninhabited island was shattered by Huang Xiaolong just like that, and massive waves rose to crash against the other structures around.

“Didn’t I say that I wouldn’t need the Immemorial Grand Formation to kill you?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Yi Xiaotang and the rest stared at him with their mouths agape.

“Don’t tell me that he hadn’t used the power of the Immemorial Grand Formation when he had dealt with the Saint Devil Prince previously…” Yi Xiaotang muttered to herself.

“No! This is not possible! He was clearly borrowing the strength of the immemorial grand dao energy in the immortal cave!”

“How can a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor be so strong?!”

Yi Xiaotang was unable to accept the fact that Huang Xiaolong alone possessed the strength to end the Saint Devil Prince. She stared at the scene before her in a daze as her mind started to wander.

She wasn’t the only one who couldn’t accept the fact. Aunt Qing was also lost in her thoughts. Even the strongest geniuses in the Divine Tuo Holy World wouldn’t be able to defeat a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor when they were only Second Resurrection Primal Ancestors!

No to mention the fact that the Saint Devil Prince had one of the strongest bloodlines in the Divine Tuo Holy World! He had the Limitless Sun Dao Soul and endless potential!

As silence descended on the lands, only the sound of waves crashing into nearby structures could be heard.

The two hundred plus experts brought over by the Saint Devil Prince didn’t dare to move a muscle as they stared at the freak standing before them. They were scared silly by the strength he had displayed!

When Huang Xiaolong was planning to drag Xu Jian up from the depths of the river, a figure broke through the surface and appeared before him.

A massive hole could be seen on the figure’s chest, and he was none other than the Saint Devil Prince who was beaten into a sorry state by Huang Xiaolong.

His armor was in tatters, but he was lucky Huang Xiaolong’s fist hadn't blown a hole through his body.

With a disheveled look, the Saint Devil Prince was covered in blood.

“Your Highness!” The experts of the Saint Devil Sacred Land wanted to rush over, but they were stopped by him.

“F*ck off!” Xu Jian’s voice rang loud and clear above the water.

Upon hearing his enraged cries, no one dared to approach him.

Tossing a pill into his mouth, a light flashed in his arms as Xu Jian summoned the Saint Devil Sword. Countless saints and devils gathered, and it was clear that he had activated his Saint Devil Bloodline to the fullest.

That wasn’t all as the Limitless Sun Dao Soul and his six high-order Saint Fates emerged from his body. The brilliant rays of light they emitted illuminated the area around him.

His aura started to rise once again as the sword in his hand started to buzz.

As the hole in his chest recovered, an anguished growl escaped his lips, “Huang Xiaolong, I refuse to believe that a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor can survive this!”

The sword in his hands tore through space as it slashed towards Huang Xiaolong.

Sword light from the Saint Devil Sword formed a river as it charged at Huang Xiaolong’s head.

“Sword River Sundering the Heavens!”

Roaring with all his might, the Saint Devil Prince revealed Yan San’s special sword technique!

The power behind his grand dao art was something never seen before, and it was several times stronger than his previous attacks.

Before the river of sword light could land on Huang Xiaolong, the water under him had evaporated. Not a single trace of it remained as the sword light sliced through the moisture in the air.

“Die!” A malevolent smile could be seen on his face.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong slowly brought his hands up. Since his previous punch had only used the power of a single dao soul, he felt that it was time to use the power of all three dao souls. There was no point in dragging things on, and he wanted to end the Saint Devil Prince once and for all. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Also, he could feel that there were many people who were alarmed by the battle that was taking place. They were all heading over, and he needed to deal with Xu Jian before turning his attention to them.

By ignoring the river of sword light that was directed at his head, Huang Xiaolong charged forward and punched the Saint Devil Prince.

A trace of icy blue and fiery red emerged from his fists and entered Xu Jian’s body in an instant before emerging from his back.
