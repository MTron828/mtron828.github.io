Chapter 3731: Huang Ren Destroyed!

 

As soon as Huang Ren appeared, he stared at the puddle of blood that was once the crown prince of his race as his expression fell. 

The crown prince’s soul had long since been tossed into the Universe Boat by Huang Xiaolong.

Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, killing intent spewed out from his eyes. Huang Ren growled, “Originally, we would have allowed you to live after you handed over the Universe Source Stone, but now, you’ll die a horrible death! You will wish you hadn't been born!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Do you think you clowns are enough to back that claim up?”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Anger filled the hearts of everyone present.

Huang Ren and the others flew into a fit of rage.

“Preposterous!”

“Hand over the Universe Source Stone!” 

“Why are we wasting our breath with him? Kill him and search his soul! We’ll throw him into the eye of the Fortune Furnace and we’ll torture his soul for eternity!”

Several experts roared in anger.

Huang Xiaolong sneered as his figure started to blur. When he reappeared, he punched out with 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

The skies changed color as a boundless energy swept towards the various experts present. 

When they felt the strength behind the punch, everyone felt their expressions changing. “Hurry up and flee!” 

Boom!

Several ancient ancestors and patriarchs clashed with Huang Xiaolong’s phantom fist.

Miserable howls filled the air.

Huang Ren and the others wanted to make their move, but they were a tad bit too late. The experts who were struck were sent flying in an instant and their faces changed.

Was that?!

“Your combat strength reached the 29 billion units mark!” Zhou Fu gasped in surprise.

Combat strength? 

Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

That was pure grand cosmos energy.

However, he didn’t wish to explain himself to this bunch of fools. Once again, a giant fist formed in the air as he circulated the Universe Transformation Art.

This time, the punch was much stronger than before.

Huang Ren yelled as golden flames surrounded his body. A burning knife appeared in his hand.

The blade was massive, and it was three times bigger than any ordinary blade. It had the power to sunder the world!

That was the inheritance treasure of the Golden Phoenix Race, a pseudo-universe treasure, the Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade!

Even though it wasn’t a universe treasure, it was comparable to one!

“Phoenix Blade Sunders the Earth!” 

Huang Ren circulated his energy to the limit as he greeted Huang Xiaolong’s fist.

Buzz…

A terrifying blade light came slashing down towards the fist.

The blade light was god knows how many miles in length, and it was like a golden star river that came crashing down on Huang Xiaolong.

Clang!

As the two attacks clashed, a massive explosion rang through the air. 

Huang Xiaolong’s fist smashed through the blade completely.

The Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade let out a terrifying screech as it was flung out of Huang Ren’s hand. Huang Xiaolong’s fist continued on towards Huang Ren’s chest.

The golden armor around Huang Ren’s body was shattered immediately. He was sent tumbling through the air.

“What?!” 

Zhou Fu and Shi Jian were stunned. They acted in unison as they rushed to block Huang Xiaolong’s strike. 

A thunderous roar could be heard as they slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

Huang Xiaolong remained firmly in place as the other two were forced to retreat several thousand miles. They crashed through countless structures in the city before coming to a stop.

Silence fell upon the land.

Every single expert who came to snatch Huang Xiaolong’s treasure felt their limbs going cold.

Even the White Deer and Yang Dingsheng couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

Shock filled the White Deer’s heart. Did Huang Xiaolong hold back against the White Feather King back in the White Deer Cave?!

That was his true strength!

From what the White Deer could tell, Huang Xiaolong was far stronger than Old Man Fortune!

“You?!” Huang Ren tore through the skies and he glared at Huang Xiaolong in equal parts terror and rage.

“I told you. You, clowns, aren’t capable of making me regret being born,” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly.

Raising his arm, Huang Ren summoned the Golden Phoenix Flaming Blade that was flung far away. When it returned to his palm, he could see a giant mark smashed into its body. The strike from Huang Xiaolong basically deformed his blade.

Even though golden light spewed out from the blade, it had lost its overbearing presence! It was no longer the magnificent pseudo-universe treasure it once was! In fact, it looked like some golden garbage someone picked up from the side of the street!

Zhou Fu and Shi Jian appeared beside Huang Ren and their gaze revealed the shock in their hearts.

No one dared to make a move.

Initially, the plan was to bring Huang Xiaolong to the three supreme experts before forcing him to hand over the Universe Source Stone. When he handed it over, the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince would be able to do as he wished.

Who would have thought that things would go in the completely opposite direction?

No one knew what to do.

“Huang Xiaolong, no matter how strong you are, you’re going against all of us alone! I refuse to believe that you can stand against the experts of the Fortune Space all by yourself!” Huang Ren suppressed the shock in his heart and he roared.

“Brother Huang Ren is right!” Shi Jian continued, “Everyone, listen to my order! We’ll join hands and kill Huang Xiaolong!”

“We’ll split the Universe Source Stone equally!” 

“With the Universe Source Stone, everyone can break through!”

“When that happens, we won’t be afraid of the Universe First Race any longer!” 

Naturally, he was full of sh*t.

However, his voice rang through the city and the experts of the various races looked at each other hesitantly.

“Heed my order! Kill Huang Xiaolong right now!” 

Under Huang Ren’s instructions, the various experts surrounded Huang Xiaolong in an attempt to take his life.

A snort left Huang Xiaolong’s lips as the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Blade of Death, and the Three Gods Halberd appeared. The Golden Sun Circlet appeared to protect his body as the Universe Origin Fires submerged the land in a sea of flames.

Even though he only revealed five treasures, the horrifying pressure that came along with it made it hard for anyone present to breathe.
