Chapter 3311: Japanese Alliance

As the Huaxia Alliance was located inland, they were pretty far away from the East Sea. With the speed of the flying ship provided by the school, they needed three days to arrive.

The flying ship was massive, and it was specially commissioned by the university. More than a thousand people could fit comfortably in the ship, and there were even several hundred rooms where one could relax.

Of course, the flying ship provided by the school couldn’t compare to the Sky Seeker Huang Xiaolong messed with several days ago.

As Huang Xiaolong and Zhang Yuhan were assigned to the first and second class cabins, Lin Kai was assigned to the third class due to his relationship with Huang Xiaolong.

Like the difference between first class and economy, there were differences between the rooms on board. The first ten rooms were the best, and the facilities in them were top notch!

Huang Xiaolong taught Zhang Yuhan the Asura Sword Art and the Dragon Fist while they were on their way to the East Sea.

Even though the rooms weren’t large, Huang Xiaolong was a grandmaster when it came to basic techniques at that level. With his arms as a sword, Huang Xiaolong managed to impart his skills on to her in the not-so-large room.

In the past, Zhang Yuhan’s talent was comparable to Huang Xiaolong! She managed to grasp the technique very quickly, and she was even faster than Lin Kai who had amazing comprehension abilities.

By the time they arrived, Zhang Yuhan had already learned quite a bit of the Asura Sword Art and the Dragon Fist.

Even though they only had two short days, Zhang Yuhan had the assistance of a monstrous expert like Huang Xiaolong! Her abilities increased by several folds, and she could take on a late-First Level Enlightenment Realm expert if she gave it her all.

That was before she fully grasp everything Huang Xiaolong taught her.

When they arrived in the coastal city along the East Sea, the military, who had long since prepared for their arrival, brought them into their barracks. Other than the students of the Eastern University, there were students of other universities and their teachers in charge of protecting them. All in all, there were more than ten thousand experts present.

Huang Xiaolong and Zhang Yuhan stood on the city walls as they stared into the distance. They were greeted with the sight of an endless blue sea.

The stench of blood drifted into their noses as the sea breeze swept inwards.

Looking at the giant plains before them, Huang Xiaolong saw that it was stained red with blood. The blood belonged to a mix of sea beasts and the humans, and one could only imagine how terrifying the battle was. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“There was another wave of attacks two days before we arrived. There were tens of thousands of beasts, and the defending troops were nearly overrun. Even though they managed to kill a lot of beasts to beat them back, more than a hundred soldiers died.” Zhang Yuhan sighed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He read the reports, and he learned that the beast tide had been going on for a whole month. The strongest beast that appeared was in the Nascent Soul Realm, and no Enlightenment Realm beast had been spotted yet.

“Xiaolong, if you have something to do, you should finish it. There’s no need to stay here with me.” Zhang Yuhan muttered. She knew that Huang Xiaolong was there to look for something.

“Alright. Please take care of Lin Kai.”

“Relax. If the beast tide comes, I’ll ensure that he doesn’t leave my side.” Zhang Yuhan promised.

“If anything suspicious happens, inform me using the transmission symbol. I’ll rush back immediately.” Huang Xiaolong reminded her.

Even though she was strong enough to deal with anything that might happen, Huang Xiaolong still refined a protective talisman for her. He refined it on the spot, and when Zhang Yuhan saw what he did, she was too stunned to speak.

He retrieved a piece of white jade and he pointed at it before handing it to her.

“You have to carry this on you at all times.” Huang Xiaolong exhorted.

When she saw the serious expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face, she couldn’t help but laugh, “Alright, alright! I will bring it with me everywhere I go! Can you please relax?!”

When she thought about how it was a gift from Huang Xiaolong, she hung it on her chest like a necklace and her face turned as red as a tomato.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t think too much about it as he told her to take care of herself before soaring into the air.

Looking at his departing figure, she felt a trace of contentment among the dissatisfaction in her heart.

She held onto the piece of jade as she felt the cooling sensation flow through her body.

After Huang Xiaolong left, he flew straight towards the shore of the East Sea.

It was large, and it spanned nearly the entire border of the Huaxia Alliance and the Korean Border. There were more than a hundred coastal towns around the shore, and if Huang Xiaolong ventured further east, he would enter the islands owned by the Japanese Alliance.

With Huang Xiaolong’s speed at the Void Immortal Realm, he was able to travel across the entire region in less than a month!

As Huang Xiaolong combed through the side of the Huaxia Alliance, he arrived at one of the southernmost cities.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived along the Malaysian Straits.

As it was one of the most important battlefields with the seabeasts, Huang Xiaolong was mistaken for an intruder when he approached. The cannons opened fire immediately, and they had the power to blow a Nascent Soul Realm expert into dust. Naturally, none of them could do a thing to Huang Xiaolong as he crossed the strait easily to enter the Territory of the Japanese Alliance.

As the Japanese Alliance was one of the eight alliances on Earth, they weren’t too much weaker than the Huaxia Alliance. The power of their economy was massive, and the three strongest cultivation families in the Japanese Alliance, the Murasakigawa Clan, Iga Clan, and Mitsui Clan were part of the strongest families on Earth. None of them were weaker than the Ying Family of the Huaxia Alliance.

Moreover, one of the six strongest factions on Earth, the Ice Palace, had most of their power stationed in the Japanese Alliance.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at one of the cities in the Japanese Alliance, he descended.

“Is this Tokyo?!” Huang Xiaolong looked all around him and gasped.

Tokyo was the capital city of the Japanese Alliance, and it was one of the strongholds of Earth.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong followed his father, Huang Jiyuan, for a trip to Tokyo. He recalled the fun times he had, and he remembered the fact that they were framed for a crime they didn’t commit there. They stayed in jail for an entire day, and they were only released after the police completed their investigation.

He would never forget the Murasakigawa Clan as they were the ones who framed him.

When he thought about the things that happened in the past, a voice boomed in his ears. “Chinese pig, get out of the way or I’ll crush you!”

Turning around, Huang Xiaolong saw a luxury car speeding towards him. Even though he was standing on the pavement, the car didn’t seem to care. It thundered towards him without so much as slowing down.
