When Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling ‘discovered’ that Huang Xiaolong’s godhead was actually top grade king rank, the two powerful characters of Barbarian God Sect started trembling with excitement. Lu Zhuo was holding Huang Xiaolong in a tight bear hug, one hand patting Huang Xiaolong’s back with strength that corresponded to his excitement while he laughed heartily, “Truly, this is Heaven’s blessing on our Barbarian God Sect, Heaven’s favor ah!”

They knew very well what a genius disciple with a top grade king rank godhead represented.

Someone like this was a rare gem even in a super force like the Fortune Gate of the Vientiane Mainland!

Huang Xiaolong had a bitter smile on his face feeling the dull pain coming from his back.

Fortunately, he decided against disguising his godhead to that of Devil Son Mo Su’s Five Elements Godhead, which was a high grade emperor rank godhead. Otherwise he would have probably frightened Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling to death!

Some time later, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling finally managed to calm the excitement in their heart, but even so, their excitement still shone from their eyes, and the way they look at Huang Xiaolong had completely changed. It seemed like they were looking at the world’s most precious treasure.

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s self-admitted thick face, he couldn’t help feeling ‘shy’ being stared at by these two men.

After their excitement subsided, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s doubt return. Previously, Lu Zhuo had personally examined Huang Xiaolong’s godhead and was certain it was the low grade king rank Three Furnace Godhead. This time, however, it became the Blue Shadow Godhead!

Just by looking at these two people’s expressions, Huang Xiaolong already guessed their doubts.

A majestic dragon might spread out all of a sudden from his body, causing the surging aura of a true dragon to fill the four corners of the hall.

“This is...!” Another wave of shock washed over Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling.

“One of the unique physiques, True Divine Dragon Physique!” Lu Zhuo’s voice quivered as he spoke.

True Divine Dragon Physique!

Another bolt of lightning struck Gu Ling’s mind, then his eyeballs protruded in amazement and his limbs started shaking, “Ranked fourth amongst the three thousand unique physiques, the True Divine Dragon Physique!”

Although one’s godhead ranking was the essential ruler for measuring one’s talent in cultivation after advancing to the Highgod Realm, one’s physique was just as important. The more powerful one’s physique was, the better it could support one’s godhead abilities.

However, in the vast Divine World, there were even less than one in a hundred people born with a unique physique. What’s more, the fourth ranked True Divine Dragon Physique that Huang Xiaolong had!

Knowing that Huang Xiaolong had a unique physique, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were once again filled with excitement.

‘The True Divine Dragon Physique ah!’

Huang Xiaolong had a top king rank godhead, which, supported by his fourth ranked True Divine Dragon Physique, gave him the highest talent below low grade emperor rank godheads!

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were still doubtful earlier. Even taking into consideration Huang Xiaolong’s top grade king rank Blue Shadow Godhead, his growth speed was too astonishing, but now they understood the reason; his True Divine Dragon Physique!

“No wonder, no wonder!” Lu Zhuo’s chin quivered as he mumbled to himself.

Huang Xiaolong solemnly added, “My True Divine Dragon Physique can transform and evolve.”

“Can transform and evolve!” Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling swayed from the shock hitting their minds.

Did that mean... Huang Xiaolong’s True Divine Dragon Physique was comparable to the top three unique physiques?!

Thinking of this, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling felt their blood-flow quicken in their veins.

The top three unique physiques were truly heaven-defying, they were said to possess unfathomable power.

Huang Xiaolong went on, “After transforming and evolving, my True Divine Dragon Physique showed some special traits, hence when Ancestor examined by godhead the last time, he mistook it for the Three Furnace Godheads.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At last, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s doubts were explained.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had prepared these excuses in advance. If Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were ever doubtful of his cultivation growth, he would push everything onto his True Divine Dragon Physique.

After finding out about Huang Xiaolong’s unique physique, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling became even more ‘affectionate’ towards him. Each of them was pulling one of Huang Xiaolong’s hands, showing their concern and kindness, to the extent of worrying if Huang Xiaolong had a girlfriend.

Cold goosebumps ran down Huang Xiaolong’s back.

It was one hour later when Huang Xiaolong left Lu Zhuo’s cultivation dwelling. Doting love filled Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling’s eyes as they watched Huang Xiaolong leave.

“Ancestor, about Chen Hao and Huang Xiaolong’s challenge, I think I should pass down an order for Chen Hao to revoke it.” Gu Ling suggested.

Lu Zhuo shook his head, sounding a little solemn, “That won’t be necessary. The challenge may not be a bad thing, this gives Huang Xiaolong a purpose, a motivation for him to become stronger, which is good for his growth. With Huang Xiaolong’s two main advantages, he might really have the strength to battle Chen Hao in a decade’s time! Even if he isn’t not a match for Chen Hao, it is sufficient to protect himself.”

Gu Ling nodded in agreement, then blurted out suddenly, “Ancestor, say, if Huang Xiaolong’s True Divine Dragon Physique has such an ability, would this top grade king rank godhead...?”

Lu Zhuo’s breathing quickened and his eyes sparkled brightly, “You mean, emperor rank?!”

Gu Ling’s breathing quickened as well, nodding his head.

A moment passed and Lu Zhuo shook his head, an inexplicable smile on his face, “There are millions of geniuses in our Vientiane World, but even so, it is hard for a startling genius with an emperor rank godhead to appear in ten million years, this is like chasing an illusion. Don’t think about it too much.”

Gu Ling was dazed for a moment, then his breathing eventually calmed down. Laughing wryly, he said “What Ancestor said is right, I am overthinking things. How could Huang Xiaolong have an emperor rank godhead? As it is, even a top grade king rank godhead is hard to believe!”

Lu Zhuo added, “Since Huang Xiaolong has already broken through to Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm, arrange for his promotion to a core disciple. No need for an assessment.”

Originally, according to the established rules, inner sect disciples who wished to be promoted to a core disciple had to reach Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm and complete an assessment. But now, Huang Xiaolong was promoted without having to go through an assessment with just an order from Lu Zhuo.

Gu Ling nodded, indicating he understood.

“After Huang Xiaolong’s promotion to core disciple is completed, give him the same authority and treatment of a Grand Elder.” Lu Zhuo added another sentence.

A core disciple with the authority and treatment of a Grand Elder! This was unprecedented in the history of the Barbarian God Sect.

Gu Ling himself was dumbfounded, “Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, Huang Junfei, those three will certainly object.” After all, even Chen Hao only had the authority and treatment of an Elder.

Lu Zhuo waved his hand, “No need to say more, I will announce it personally tomorrow during the reward ceremony.” As the Barbarian God Sect’s Ancestor, Cao Yang’s group wouldn’t dare to defy his words.

The next morning, the joint training’s reward ceremony was held in the square in front of the Soaring Sky Hall.

Inner sect disciples who successfully entered the top one hundred would be given a reward by Grand Elder Lin Shen, while disciples within the top ten would be rewarded by Sect Chief Gu Ling himself. Only the first ranked disciple’s reward would be personally given out by Ancestor Lu Zhuo.

From inner disciples to Elders, to Grand Elders, all eyes were on Huang Xiaolong as he received the Blood Phoenix’s blood essence, a feverish light shining in their eyes.

That was a drop of Blood Phoenix blood essence ah, even someone like Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and other Grand Elders didn’t have the good fortune to consume something so valuable.

However, when Lu Zhuo announced Huang Xiaolong’s promotion to a core disciple on the spot and the fact that he would have the same authority and treatment as a Grand Elder, everyone was taken aback.

“Ancestor, absolutely not!” Cao Yang took several steps forward in agitation, blurting out, “There is no such precedence in our Barbarian God Sect, we cannot break the rules just for a mere Huang Xiaolong!”
