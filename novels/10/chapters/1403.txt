Gudu Yue and Song Rui were confused by the subordinate’s reaction. They also turned to look across the street, and were shocked to see the giant flying ship in the airspace above Huang Xiaolong’s residence that had appeared out of nowhere.

The giant flying ship was resembling an ancient Giant Shark, and the long sharp fin was reflecting a cold light under the sunlight.

In the next second, right in front of Gudu Yue and Song Rui’s shocked faces, that giant shark flying ship emitted a blue water-like rippling light and shot forwards, tearing through space and disappearing from the Martial Dragon City.

Gudu Yue blanked momentarily, but he reacted quickly. He jumped in anger while bellowing, “That kid’s fleeing! Chase—! Block him!”

At the same time, he and Song Rui tore space and went after Huang Xiaolong’s flying ship.

Song Rui also reacted quickly, and threw out his Blood Wolf Flying Ship almost immediately. He and Gudu Yue jumped aboard the ship and began chasing after Huang Xiaolong. Meanwhile, Gudu Yue took out his communication talisman and contacted four of the Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders.

Gudu Yue had already paved the road with these four Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders earlier. Moreover, these four Grand Elders were quite close to Gudu Yue, as they were Gudu Yue’s elders.

Of course, they had agreed to help Gudu Yue by making a deal with him. He had promised to give them all the spirit stones on Huang Xiaolong’s body, whereas Gudu Yue could keep the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.

Soon after receiving Gudu Yue’s message, the four Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders tore space and entered the void. They were directly headed towards Huang Xiaolong’s flying ship. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The moment Huang Xiaolong’s flying ship had departed from the Martial Dragon City, other families’ forces had also been on his trail along with Gudu Yue’s group. A total of several hundred experts were chasing after Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was well aware of his pursuers as he stood inside the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s hall. A cold sneer rose at the corner of his lips as he thought, ‘looks like more than a few people were yearning for his Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits and high grade-seven spirit stones.’

Then, they would have to bear the consequences! They can’t blame him!

People die for wealth, so these people must be prepared to die!

“Decrease speed, and turn around!” Huang Xiaolong commanded Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the others were taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s order. But on second thought, they seemed to understand Huang Xiaolong’s intention and complied respectfully.

Gudu Yue and Song Rui who were at the front of the pack dazed for a moment when they saw that Huang Xiaolong’s Giant Shark Flying Ship was turned around to face them. In the next moment, they saw giant sword wings extending out from the sides of Huang Xiaolong’s flying ship. There was a low humming noise as the flying ship flew towards them like a ferocious water beast.

Gudu Yue and Song Rui’s expressions froze.

“Out of the way!” Song Rui literally roared the words. He grabbed Gudu Yue and leaped off the Blood Wolf Flying Ship. Almost at the same instant the two of them leaped off the Blood Wolf Flying Ship, and a space-shaking boom thundered as the Giant Shark Flying Ship rammed into the Blood Wolf Flying Ship.

The Giant Shark Flying Ship’s head pierced into the high chaos-grade Blood Wolf Flying Ship like knife cutting through butter, but it did not stop there. It smashed the Blood Wolf Flying Ship down from high air into the mountain range below.

Gudu Yue and Song Rui had just leaped off but were immediately struck in the back by the Blood Wolf Flying Ship’s body. The two plummeted from high up in the air, uncontrollably vomiting blood.

After ramming the Blood Wolf Flying Ship into the mountain range, the Giant Shark Flying Ship rushed onwards to the hundred experts at the back.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

These forces’ experts were knocked away like flies by the Giant Shark Flying Ship. Those below God King Realm cultivation exploded to their deaths from the impact, and their blood splattered to the ground.

Even low-level God King Realm masters’ physique couldn’t withstand the collision with the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

After all, the Giant Shark Flying Ship was a top grade-chaos spiritual artifact, and it regained its ferocious beast nature after it was repaired.

Among the group of pursuers, there were only two mid-level God Realm masters, who managed to dodge the Giant Shark Flying Ship, but their backs were dampened from cold sweat.

“Top, top-grade chaos flying ship!” One of them stammered.

Top grade-chaos flying ships were rare in the Divine World, this grade of flying ship has not appeared in the High Martial World for more than ten thousand years. But they had just seen one, moreover, that top grade-chaos flying ship belonged to the same fat-sheep who had bought the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits!

“Stop, how dare you...!”

Right at this time, four figures accelerated forward while attacking Huang Xiaolong. Four giant palm prints landed on the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

The four people were none other than the Gudu Clan’s four Grand Elders.

Inside the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s control hall, Xiang Xun harrumphed with disdain. He then let out a bellow, and his godforce surged outwards and his trunk swept at the four incoming palm prints.

Rumble~!

A resounding boom ensued. The four Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders wailed in pain as their bodies staggered backwards as they lost their balance and smashed into the land below.

The land cracked open with the impact.

It was one against four, but still all four of the Gudu Clan’s Grand Elders were repelled by Xiang Xun.

Xiang Xun was a powerful existence that had lived for more several billion years, although his current strength was suppressed to God King Realm by the petrification seals, still, his strength was far above the Gudu Clan’s four Grand Elders who had advanced to God King Realm for merely tens of thousands of years.

The two God King Realm masters who had dodged the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s attack were deathly pale after witnessing this scene, and their horror-struck eyes were fixed in the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

Xiang Xun looked towards the two God King Realm masters, as he raised his leg and kicked at them from across the space.

The two God King Realm masters crashed to the ground like meteors, as if they were hit by the weight of a divine mountain.

“Let’s go!”

Huang Xiaolong ordered and manipulated the core formation. The Giant Shark Flying Ship burst forth at full speed and vanished in the blink of an eye.

As Huang Xiaolong took over the flying ship’s control and sped away, numerous figures flew up to the sky from the Martial Dragon City and its neighboring cities. Among them were Longwu Ling Er and Gudu Man.

They saw the numerous corpses scattered on the ground as well as the miserable remnants of the Blood Wolf Flying Ship, and paled.

"Second Brother!’ Gudu Man screamed and hastened to Gudu Yue’s side.

“What happened?!” Longwu Ling Er couldn’t help asking after seeing the blood-stained Gudu Yue.

Gudu Yue couldn’t speak due to his severe injuries. It was Song Rui who answered, “It’s that kid who bid the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits! He suddenly went amok and hit the Martial Dragon City’s experts. Brother Gudu and I were affected by his attack!”

He naturally glazed over the fact that he and Gudu Yue had planned to rob Huang Xiaolong’s Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits, and turned the story to make it look like Huang Xiaolong had gone amok and attacked them instead.

Longwu Ling Er and Gudu Man’s faces were clearly full of shock.

“Top grade-chaos flying ship!”

“Him!”

Longwu Ling Er remembered the face of the young man who had won the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits from the auction.

Gudu Man was shrieking, “That person is simply abhorrent. He attacked the people of Martial Dragon City indiscriminately because he has a top grade-chaos flying ship! Sister Ling Er, your Longwu Clan absolutely must not let him escape!”
