Chapter 3120: Are You Dead?

Boom!

Eighteen fists landed on Huang Xiaolong at the same time, and he was sent flying even further than before.

And again, the nine beast kings appeared above Huang Xiaolong as they punched a third time.

Everyone gasped in shock as they looked at Huang Xiaolong, who was piercing through sacred land after another like a shooting star.

The experts of the various dao venerables felt their hearts trembling in fear. That was the might of nine beast kings working together! Every single one of them had the ability to challenge the third-ranked expert on the Extermination List, and their strength was more than enough to smash a mere Huang Xiaolong into bits!

Every single combined strike they made seemed to possess the ability to smash through a Creed!

What was a mere body to them?

Xiao Tianqi was stunned. He didn’t expect the nine of them to be so strong, either. Out of the nine of them, three were slightly weaker than him. Three of the six left were comparable to him in strength, and the final three were stronger than him if he didn’t use the power of the Origin Holy World! When they worked together, they were able to seal off the grand dao and shatter the river of reincarnation!

Their strength reached the peak, and they seemed to possess the ability to change the laws of the world!

If he had to use a single word to describe them, it would have to be the word, ‘strong’! They were too damn strong!

Even with his full strength, he was afraid he would be defeated if all of them worked hand in hand!

In the blink of an eye, the nine beast kings made more than a hundred strikes!

Every single attack sent Huang Xiaolong flying even faster, and by the time they were done, Huang Xiaolong had reached the edge of the Origin Heavenly Cave.

The nine beast kings finally stopped for a moment.

Huang Xiaolong remained motionless as he lay in a random crater in the final sacred land he crashed into.

‘Is… Is he dead?” someone asked.

“He has to be! No matter how strong his physical body is, he won’t be able to take on the strikes from all nine beast kings!” Xuan Kong sighed.

His expression was ugly as he spoke. A hint of panic could be seen in his eyes. If Huang Xiaolong was defeated, who in the world would be able to stop the nine beast kings?!

The Origin Heavenly Cave was doomed!

Xiao Yuncheng and the others seemed to have thought of the same problem and panic started to set into their hearts.

As the nine beast kings looked at the man buried in the ground, a sigh of relief escaped their lips. They looked at each other quietly, and they knew that even someone like the Myriad Formation Devil would be killed by the time they were done. No matter how Huang Xiaolong was, he couldn’t be fine after all the beating he endured.

Even if Huang Xiaolong was beaten to death, he was close to the gates of hell!

Just as they were about to celebrate, their eyebrows started to twitch. As they stared at the hole in the ground, a figure rose from the dust.

A figure appeared before them, and they could see that the armor around his body was shattered beyond belief. Even his chest was punched inwards! He was like a piece of metal that was hammered beyond belief, but his entire body was still in one piece!

No one could believe what they were seeing.

.

Xiao Yuncheng, Xuan Kong, Yang Yuyuan, and the others were shocked, but so was Xiao Tianqi!

The nine beast kings widened their eyes when they looked at him.

“Looks like there’s some sort of secret contained in your body…” One of the beast kings gasped in shock.

He could see that Huang Xiaolong’s body was hiding another terrifying secret. After all, even if his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth was at perfection level, he wouldn’t be able to survive their previous onslaught.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong wiped off the bloodstained around his lips.

If he said that he wasn’t injured after the beating, he would be lying.

However, the power of nirvana poured out from his body all of a sudden, and his body started to reform! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“We cannot allow him to recover!” a beast king growled.

If an ordinary expert at the level of He Zhen took the previous beating, they would be injured beyond the point of restoration. They might only be able to recover after several million years, but Huang Xiaolong was different! His recovery speed was something unimaginable.

The nine beast kings looked at each other in shock.

Kill!

Once again, they appeared above Huang Xiaolong.

Before their fists could come crashing down, a horrifying amount of cosmos energy charged into the skies. The power of three small worlds emerged, and the space around him trembled.

“Three… Three small worlds?!” Xiao Yuncheng screamed in disbelief. Every single person present felt their brain buzzing in shock.

Previously, they were amazed at the fact that Huang Xiaolong could control the power of two small worlds! Now, they discovered that there was another one! That wasn’t something they could describe in words!

The nine beast kings jumped in fright when they saw the power leaking out of Huang Xiaolong, and their hands paused.

The power of nirvana, poison, absolute lightning, and absolute frost emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body along with the other powers he controlled. The power of radiance, darkness, absolute blaze, and wood emerged.

With eight elements of absolute power swirling around him, they formed an indestructible mini world that surrounded Huang Xiaolong. The power of nirvana brought everything back to life, and the power of poison corroded everything around it. The power of lightning exterminated everything in its way, and the power of absolute frost froze the space around him. The power of radiance and darkness complemented each other, and the power of absolute blaze burned bright. The power of wood contained endless vitality.

The eight elements intertwined, and a horrifying pressure descended on the creeds around.

Even the nine beast kings felt their hearts skipping a beat when they were struck by the sudden surge in energy. The Death Beast Army was sent flying.

When their fists reached Huang Xiaolong, the cosmos energy of three small worlds and power of eight absolute powers stopped them dead in their tracks.

“Eight elements of absolute power!” Jiang Meng screamed.

Many patriarchs were too shocked to speak.

Those who were there to kill Huang Xiaolong no longer moved as the killing intent in their hearts died down nearly instantly.

Xiao Tianqi felt his jaws dropping, and his mind went blank.

When Huang Xiaolong stopped them, he retreated several dozen thousand miles. The power of nirvana, radiance, and absolute wood filled Huang Xiaolong, and he recovered instantly.
