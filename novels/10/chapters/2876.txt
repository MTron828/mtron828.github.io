Chapter 2877: Shocking the World With One Battle

“Absolute blaze!”

The Dragon Fish Creed’s several half-step Dao Venerables cried out in shock once again.

Absolute blaze!

Something exploded in the minds of Dragon Fish Creed’s and Ten Swords Creed’s experts as they looked at Huang Xiaolong. Only, shock was left on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong possessed the power of absolute frost and absolute blaze at the same time!

This!

They had yet to hear of anyone possessing absolute frost and absolute blaze powers simultaneously in the Divine Tuo Holy World. As a matter of fact, not one amongst the many Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables had two absolute powers.

Being able to comprehend one kind of absolute power was rare in the world. A Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert needed to spend a lifetime to comprehend one kind of absolute power.

But Huang Xiaolong, a mere Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, had comprehended two kinds of absolute powers!

Moreover, absolute frost and absolute blaze were contradictory powers that couldn’t merge together!

Suddenly, an uncontrollable fear came from the depths of their souls.

It was unadulterated fear.

Huang Xiaolong ignored these fearful gazes. After incinerating the half-step Dao Venerable’s dao physique, Huang Xiaolong captured his dao soul like he had done with the others, and threw it into the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

“Now, it’s your turn!” Huang Xiaolong turned around, looking at the remaining Ten Swords Creed’s several half-step Dao Venerable experts and Primal Ancestor Realm disciples.

The Ten Swords Creed’s remaining half-step Dao Venerables and Primal Ancestor disciples all turned deathly pale.

“You really want to make an enemy out of the Ten Swords Creed?” One of the Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerables’ heart tightened in fear as he spoke, “Your combat power might be amazing, but you’re only still a Primal Ancestor. If you release Grand Elder Chen Dingtian and the others’ dao souls, we will plead to the Creed Patriarch on your behalf to exempt your punishment upon our return!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted unapologetically at their words, “Plead to your patriarch to exempt my punishment?”

“You’re saying that I’ve done wrong?” Huang Xiaolong questioned the other side icily.

He was the Son of Creation, and a small creed had the cheek to say that they would exempt his punishment?!

Catching the ridicule in Huang Xiaolong’s words, the Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable’s face turned sullen.

“You!” The Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable wanted to say more, but Huang Xiaolong made his move. In a flicker, he was right in front of the half-step Dao Venerable and said, “I’ve already said that if anyone from the Ten Swords Creed troubles me, I will destroy his dao physique and abolish him!”

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong’s absolute blaze power struck the Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable, who had spoken. His body blurred into a flicker as he zig-zagged through the remaining disciples.

With every flash of a shadow, one of them would be either incinerated by fire, or get frozen into a statue.

In less than ten breaths, no one from the Ten Swords Creed was still standing.

Huang Xiaolong collected their dao souls into the Immemorial Immortal Cave. After that, he turned and looked at the Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples with a chillingly indifferent gaze.

The Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples had seized the chance to rescue Yu Zhou while Huang Xiaolong was dealing with the Ten Swords Creed’s disciples.

The pale-faced Yu Zhou stood amidst the Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples and fear was clearly written in his four crimson pupils, intermingled with complex emotions of doubt, shock, fury, killing intent, and disbelief.

I can’t understand how Huang Xiaolong could master two contradicting absolute powers!

Huang Xiaolong is merely a puny Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

How can this ant-like existence possess this terrifyingly powerful combat prowess?!

Even the One Dragon, Two Tigers, and Three Moons geniuses with ten high-order Saint Fates couldn’t possibly have such terrifying combat prowess. None of these geniuses could defeat so many half-step Dao Venerables at one time while only a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

In this world, how could there be anyone with higher combat prowess than the One Dragon, Two Tigers, and Three Moons!

He didn’t believe it!

He was unable to believe that this was real.

“If you leave Yu Zhou here, I will let others leave,” Huang Xiaolong stated.

The faces of Dragon Fish Creed’s experts turned unsightly.

Leave Yu Zhou here?!

Yu Zhou was the Enforcement Hall Master Zhu Hui’s personal disciple. His status and identity were the highest ones amongst them.

“Grand Elder Yu Zhou is our Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall’s grand elder, and he is also Hall Master Zhu Hui’s personal disciple. Are you sure you want to do this?” one of the Dragon Fish Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable warned sullenly, and he even added, “Your action will only make an enemy out of the Dragon Fish Creed, and when that happens, no one in the entire Divine Tuo Holy World would dare to protect you, not even the Divination Creed!”

But just as he finished his words, a force shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s finger and pierced through the half-step Dao Venerable’s forehead. A ray of icy blue power spread, starting from the half-step Dao Venerable’s forehead to his whole body, and then he disintegrated into ice-dust, drifting away.

All the Dragon Fish Creed’s experts were enraged to the extreme.

“If you leave now, you can still leave alive. I will give you three breaths time. Three breaths later, if you’re still here, then there will be no need to leave anymore.” Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the remaining Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples. “When you go back, tell Zhu Hui and the Dragon Fish Creed’s higher echelons that if you come provoking me again, I’ll destroy as many as Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples that come looking for me!”

I’ll destroy as many as they come!

Huang Xiaolong’s sharp voice seemed to come from the deepest of hell.

The faces of these remaining Dragon Fish Creed’s experts turned uglier still.

Is he threatening the Dragon Fish Creed?! There had never been anyone with the guts to threaten the Dragon Fish Creed.

Not to mention, the one threatening the Dragon Fish Creed was only a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

In the end, a half-step Dao Venerable whistled away, choosing to leave.

This half-step Dao Venerable expert was a Dragon Fish Creed Foreign Affairs Hall’s grand elder.

Seeing this, several other experts also sped away. After all, no one was willing to die. Although after going back, they would be punished by the Dragon Fish Creed and Zhu Hui, they would take their chances, rather than having their bodies destroyed and dao souls imprisoned by Huang Xiaolong here and now.

“You, all of you, come back here for me!” After watching the Dragon Fish Creed’s experts leaving one after another, Yu Zhou berated in fear and despair crept up his face.

As Yu Zhou was screaming madly, violent grand dao energy surged from his body, and his body rapidly blurring into a streak of light as he tore a hole in space in an attempt to escape into the void.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, his feet barely left the ground, when an overwhelming force slammed into him, knocking him out.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold sneer sounded behind him, and in the next second, a force dragged him towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Y-you, you cannot destroy my body, you cannot!” Yu Zhou shrieked intelligible, petrified as he came face to face with Huang Xiaolong, “I am the Dragon Fish Creed…!”

But Huang Xiaolong cut him off before he could finish, “I know, I know, you are Zhu Hui’s personal disciple, and also a grand elder of the Dragon Fish Creed’s Enforcement Hall!”

“Today, even if you were Huang Shuai, your ending would be the same!” With that said, a dark green flame flowed out from Huang Xiaolong’s palm—it was the power of nirvana!

The power of nirvana enveloped Yu Zhou, and his eyes protruded in excruciating pain. Bloodcurdling screams echoed still long after everything ended.

……

A few days later…

News spread throughout the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave that Huang Xiaolong had killed Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, seven Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerables, and one Dragon Fish Creed’s expert with his early Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm strength.

The Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave was shaken from top to bottom!

The news soon shook the neighboring heavenly caves as well!

When Yu Yue heard the news on her way back to the Misty Rain Heavenly Cave, it rendered her dazed for a long time before shock took over her delicate face.

“He, alone, destroyed Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, seven Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerables, and one Dragon Fish Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable?!” Yu Yue was still in disbelief as she uttered the question.

“Young Lady, it is said that he possesses the power of absolute frost and absolute blaze!” Tan Meiqin’s expression of disbelief mirrored her young lady’s.

No one would believe such a tall tale, yet this news was brought back by those Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples, who had escaped!

With this one battle, Huang Xiaolong’s reputation rang through the entire Divine Tuo Holy World!

And this battle attracted the attention of many Divine Tuo Holy World’s top-tier creeds!
