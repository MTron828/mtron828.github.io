Chapter 2458: Jin Taiji

Wu Ge was dazed as he stared at the four divine fire spirits, Azure Dragon, Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, and White Tiger, flying around Huang Xiaolong.

One didn’t need to explain how toxic the poisons from these fifty disciples with innate poisonous physiques were, and even a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint expert would have a hard time expelling the poisons out from his body. But now, the moment the four divine fires appeared, they burned away every last trace of poison from Huang Xiaolong’s body faster than the eye could blink!

It was burned clean, as if Huang Xiaolong had never been poisoned!

It went without saying that everyone could see these were special divine fires.

Could it be fire of origin?

Thoughts raced through Wu Ge’s mind.

When the Holy World had come into being, the Holy World’s heart had given birth to many things, such as, Xuanhuang Holy Aura, grandmist holy spiritual aura, some Primal Ancestor level holy beasts, some fires of origin, many ancestral trees, as well as innate spiritual beings, etcetera, etcetera.

But no one had ever seen treasures like the fire of origin, hence Wu Ge did not dare to say for certain that the four fire spirits around Huang Xiaolong were the spirits of fire of origin.

But Wu Ge could determine with absolute certainty that these four divine fires were exceptionally powerful!

Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Li Chen, Xie Bufan, Lin Xiaoying, Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and the rest were also staring at the four divine fires’ spirits, flying around Huang Xiaolong, in shocked dazedness.

Each had their own thoughts.

Xie Yao said to Li Chen, “Senior Brother Li Chen, that can’t really be a fire of origin, right? How did Huang Xiaolong get it? Could it be that the four Primal Ancestors gave it to Huang Xiaolong? In that case, the four Lord Primal Ancestors are too biased, aren’t they? Senior Brother Li Chen, you’re Lord Long’s personal disciple, ah. On top of that, you’re the Holy Heavens’ chief disciple!”

Undeniably, Xie Yao had some vivid imaginations.

After hearing Xie Yao’s words, Li Chen’s heart was clouded with a burst of hatred towards Huang Xiaolong. Never before had he felt a hatred so intense towards anyone.

Although Li Chen couldn’t be certain whether four divine fires were given to Huang Xiaolong by the four Primal Ancestors or not, he had similar thoughts as Xie Yao, as he felt that Lord Long was biased towards Huang Xiaolong. He was the Holy Heavens’ Chief Holy Prince! In so many years, the four Primal Ancestors had never given him any real good stuff!

What he had gotten was a saint artifact given by his Master, Lord Long.

Except for this one saint artifact, there was given nothing else.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Li Chen looked at Huang Xiaolong with hatred and resentment flickering in his eyes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In all honesty, not only Wu Ge, Duan Xuan, Xie Bufan, and the others were astonished by this sight, but Huang Xiaolong himself was surprised. Originally, he had wanted to use the Golden Buddha Saint Godhead’s power of light to disperse the poisons from his body. The strength of his current Golden Buddha Saint Godhead was more than sufficient to do so.

But he hadn’t expected, the four divine fires’ spirits that had been obediently slumbering inside his body to actually jump out and scattered off the poisons from his body in the blink of an eye.

Feeling the vigorous auras from the four divine fires, Huang Xiaolong noticed as his own strength improved, and the four divine fires’ spirits had also grown much stronger compared to the past. It seems, the four divine fires’ spirits can also become stronger continuously?!

The masked man also was surprised by this result. Upon staring at Huang Xiaolong’s four divine fires, an obscured light glimmered in the depth of his eyes.

At this point, one could already guess the endings of the fifty innate poisonous physiqued Third Tribulation half-True Saints on the battle stage.

All of them became Huang Xiaolong’s supplements.

Though these innate poisonous physiqued Third Tribulation half-True Saint disciples’ talents were incomparable to Fang Xing, Gu Xuanxu, Sui Yunfeng, and others, their complete dao saint godheads ranks averaged in the one hundreds, adhering to the concept of something was better than nothing, and even a mosquito was meat.

After listening to the fifty disciples’ tragic screams, the masked man’s expression was ugly to the extreme. Having traveled across the Holy World for so many years, it was not easy for him to find these three to four hundred disciples born with innate poisonous physiques. Furthermore, in the last several hundred thousand years, he had spent a lot of effort and resources to cultivate these disciples. Merely the various poisonous and toxic materials these disciples had needed to cultivate, had cost him several mountains of holy spiritual jade stones.

Now, in less than half an hour, he had lost fifty disciples!

After killing the fifty disciples with innate poisonous physiques, Huang Xiaolong faced the masked man, and wore a casual smile on his face as he spoke, “Will the disciples under you be continuing the challenge me? They are more than welcome to do so.”

Because his face was concealed by the mask, others could not see his expression.

The masked man chuckled, “Huang Xiaolong, the treasures on your body are really a lot, ah. Well, let’s forget about my disciples for now, and give a chance to the Ghost Talisman Holy Ground and Holy Race, but we will meet again.” With that said, his figure blurred and disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the spot from where the masked man had disappeared, and a light flickered in his eyes. That man had said there were quite a lot of treasures on him, and it clearly meant that if it wasn’t for the four divine fires, he would have lost just now.

Huang Xiaolong’s instinct told him that he and the masked man would meet again.

The subsequent four days passed without event as no one challenged Huang Xiaolong after he killed the fifty Third Tribulation half-True Saint disciples with innate poisonous physiques.

Huang Xiaolong spent four leisurely days, sitting cross-legged in meditation.

A new challenger appeared after the fourth day.

The party who challenged came from a big ancient race called the Vajra Race.

This big ancient race too had been keeping themselves away from the world for a long time, and they were born with innate Vajra Bloodline. Each direct descendent possessed herculean strength, and they were nicknamed as the Holy World’s warrior race.

Rumors had it that before the Clear Snow Palace Hall Master Xue Lingyun had broken through to Primal Ancestor Realm, she had once fought a fierce battle against the first Vajra Race Patriarch. The Vajra Race’s first Patriarch, Jin Bushi, could tear a holy ground into half with his bare hands, and no one knew how many holy grounds were torn apart by the end of the battle between them.

Who won remained a mystery to this day. All one could say was that both Xue Lingyun and Jin Bushi were still alive, and after that battle, Xue Lingyun had entered seclusion for several hundred thousand years and then broke through to Primal Ancestor in one go. As for the Vajra Race’s first Patriarch, Jin Bushi, he too had gone into seclusion upon returning to the clan and had never appeared again.

“Patriarch Jin Nu, are you certain you’re sending your disciple up to challenge me?” Huang Xiaolong frowned as he asked, looking at the Vajra Race’s current Patriarch, Jin Nu.

Huang Xiaolong knew that his Master, Tyrant Chu, had some association with the first Vajra Race’s Patriarch Jin Bushi.

Before Tyrant Chu had stepped into Primal Ancestor Realm, he had received much help from Jin Bushi.

Jin Nu nodded his head, “Yes, I have heard that Your Highness’ talent is unparalleled, and you are invincible in battles. The untalented disciple of mine would like to exchange some pointers with Your Highness.”

From the strength and battle prowess Huang Xiaolong had shown, thus far, had taught the Holy World’s various forces’ patriarchs, and True Saints to not underestimate Huang Xiaolong. This was why many of them used Your Highness when speaking to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, inwardly shaking his head. It looks like my open challenge to all Holy World’s disciples under Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint has stimulated the competitiveness in Jin Nu’s bone?!

“Alright then, where are the fifty Vajra Race disciples for the challenge?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Jin Nu shook his head, “With fifty people besieging, there is no glory in winning that way. I do not want an inglorious victory.” He then pointed at a big-faced disciple behind him and introduced, “My clan’s disciple, Jin Taiji will be challenging you alone!”

The moment Jin Nu finished, the surrounding crowd was buzzing.

He’s challenging Huang Xiaolong alone!

From the first day of Huang Xiaolong’s battle stage challenge until now, everyone had witnessed his frightening battle power, and even the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s disciple with the Life Reversing Saint Godhead, Sui Yunfeng, was not a match against him. Despite this, the Vajra Race had the guts to send up a sole disciple to challenge Huang Xiaolong?!
