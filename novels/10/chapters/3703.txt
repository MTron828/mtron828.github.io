Chapter 3704: Secret of the Nameless Devil Mirror

When it landed on his hand, everyone in the surrounding stared at him in shock.

The Ferocious Devil who received the news in the imperial palace stared at the messenger for quite some time in shock.

He knew that Huang Xiaolong had been trying to comprehend the secrets regarding the mirror, but he felt that it wasn’t possible.

Now, the kid actually brought away the Nameless Devil Mirror!

Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong managed to do what he couldn’t?

“Did Huang Xiaolong comprehend the mysteries behind the mirror?” The Green Ghost asked.

He tried to understand the mysteries behind the mirror, but like the Ferocious Devil, he didn’t understand a thing!

The Ferocious Devil hesitated for a moment and muttered, “Probably…”

He wasn’t too sure what was going on.

However, if Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain the mirror, he probably understood the secrets behind it.

A light flashed in The Green Ghost’s eyes.

He might not know what the Nameless Devil Mirror represented, but he knew that it wasn’t ordinary! In fact, it should be an extremely special existence!

He even thought that he would be able to comprehend the mysteries of the universe the moment he understood the secrets behind the mirror!

The Ferocious Devil chuckled softly when he noticed the look in The Green Ghost’s eyes. “Huang Xiaolong isn’t as simple as he seems. Even I might not be able to suppress him if I made a move personally, much less you…”

The Green Ghost gasped in fright. “What?!”

He clearly didn’t believe that the Ferocious Devil wasn’t enough to suppress Huang Xiaolong.

The Ferocious Devil stood up and looked in the direction where the mirror once was. “He has a lot of secrets on him. Not even I can see through him. In the Thirteen Universes we lived in previously, there were only two people who gave me the same feeling.”

The Green Ghost fell silent.

He knew exactly what the Ferocious Devil meant.

“In fact, it’s a good thing that he managed to understand the secrets behind the mirror. After all, we’re facing the same enemy!”

That was the reason behind the Ferocious Devil’s generosity in handing over the mirror to the city. He wanted to find a powerful ally to fight against the Universe First Race!

The Green Ghost sucked in a cold breath and suppressed his greedy desires. “Lord Devil is right. I didn’t think things through.”

“Not to worry. You were merely deluded for a moment.” Chuckling slightly, the Ferocious Devil continued, “Let’s go. Huang Xiaolong is back. Let’s congratulate him.”

…

As the silvery moonlight fell on the lands, Huang Xiaolong sat in the middle of the second layer of formations on the Universe Boat and absorbed an endless amount of universe source qi.

There was an object floating in the air above him, and it was precisely the Nameless Devil Mirror he obtained that morning.

Every time it turned a single round above his head, the images that Huang Xiaolong comprehended would appear around him.

The images became clearer and clearer, as though they were corporeal.

The one hundred thirty thousand images depicted the changes of the Thirteen Universes since the start of time.

Eventually, the universes were created.

As the images of the thirteen universes revolved around him, they were like thirteen balls of light that emitted multi-colored lights.

The Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, Reversal Sword, Three Gods Halberd, Golden Sun Circlet, Blade of Death, and the Yin Yang Flame Wheels emerged from his body without warning. They started to spin around with the universes.

The three great worlds in his body appeared above his head, and they mirrored the movement of the universes.

As time trickled on, the grand cosmos energy produced by his three great worlds started to transform. They turned completely golden in color and so did the three great worlds.

Hundreds of thousands of years passed in the blink of an eye.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

On one fateful day, the transformation was complete and the three great worlds produced by Huang Xiaolong, including the grand cosmos energy they produced, became completely golden in color.

Buzz…

The sounds of shattering could be heard as something in Huang Xiaolong seemed to split apart.

His body started to turn gold in color.

A terrifying might emerged from his body and the pressure collided with the might of the universe that governed the lands. His grand cosmos energy expanded like the sea and it soon filled every crevice of the second layer of restrictions.

Several years later…

The pressure that came from Huang Xiaolong’s body receded like a tide and the grand cosmos energy slowly disappeared. He opened his eyes slowly as he finally broke through to the peak of the grand completion stage!

In the past, he was stuck at the limit of the grand completion stage. Now, his grand cosmos energy finally crossed the 27 billion mark!

He stretched his hand out slightly and the devil mirror fell onto it. Looking at the mirror in his hand, Huang Xiaolong fell deep into his thoughts. Even though he had no idea what the mirror was, he knew that it was an object that existed long before the creation of the Thirteen Universes.

That was because it recorded the formation of the universes!

The Nameless Devil Mirror might not be a universe treasure, but it was definitely a treasure that surpassed that grade! Universe treasures were only born by the universes long after the mirror came into existence.

It was even older than the Universe Boat!

Huang Xiaolong might be a little hesitant when breaking through to the Universe God Realm in the past. However, he gained a huge boost in confidence now that he obtained the mirror.

He comprehended the mysteries of the universe when he was cultivating, but he knew that it was merely the tip of the iceberg. When he truly comprehended the secret and mysteries of the universe, he would finally turn into a Universe God!

As the strongest universe treasure, the Universe Boat also contained the intricacies of the universe. However, it only contained the secret of the First Universe! The Nameless Devil Mirror contained the secret of all thirteen!
