Chapter 2723: Where Did You Find This Little Cutie?

The terrifying waves of energy swept through the World River, and the various islands around it trembled non-stop as they eventually faded from existence.

Even those who were located quite a fair distance away from the Sky Opening Island, like Long JIanfei and the others, were shocked at the sudden change.

“This… Is that still the power of a Primal Ancestor?!” Mo Zhi felt his throat going dry when he felt the energy wave that swept past them.

He had never thought that a Primal Ancestor would be able to unleash such a terrifying amount of power.

If the previous shockwave were only the first clash of the battle, the epic clash between Huang Xiaolong and the Sky Opening Island’s spirit would be enough to destroy the World River several times over!

“Will anything happen to the Mansion Master?” Long Shengtian frowned. Even though Huang Xiaolong had managed to enter the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm and reached a new level of strength, he couldn’t help but worry when he felt the frighteningly powerful shockwaves that came from the Sky Opening Island.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“He should be fine.” Even though Long Jianfei seemed confident, he questioned himself in his heart. He could vaguely feel two different energy sources that came from the island, and if he wasn’t mistaken, the spirit of the Sky Opening Island seemed to be a little stronger than Huang Xiaolong!

They were right. The Sky Opening Island Spirit was indeed stronger than Huang Xiaolong. No matter how much he had tried to overestimate the spirit’s strength, Huang Xiaolong realized that he had misjudged his opponent.

He knew that he was able to suppress the Chi Dao trio before he broke through, but he actually fell to a disadvantage when facing the Sky Opening Island’s spirit!

After being forced to retreat, Huang Xiaolong smashed through several mountain ranges before stopping.

Finally steadying himself, Huang Xiaolong shook his body once before chuckling at the island spirit, “Who would have thought that a little guy like you would be so strong?”

“No sh*t!” The spirit chuckled and it appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the next instant. A punch was sent flying towards the annoying human’s face.

With the Cangqiong Blade and the Flying Heaven Spear in hand, Huang Xiaolong defended himself hastily.

Bang!

Once again, he was forced to retreat.

This time, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t able to stabilize himself before the next punch arrived.

He could only raise his weapons in haste to defend himself.

And again!

“F*ck! Little guy, stop hitting my face!” Huang Xiaolong could no longer contain his rage after the Sky Opening Island Spirit punched his face the third time.

He didn’t know if the spirit had some sadistic tendencies, but all the spirit did was punch him in the face. Even though he was able to defend himself successfully every time, he still felt annoyed by the little spirit’s actions.

A sinister smile appeared on the island spirit’s face as it continued to rain blows on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong messed up and failed to block one of the blows. He was instantly sent straight into the depths of the Sky Opening Island.

However, he managed to free himself quickly. Touching his face, he discovered that it was a long time since he had last felt so defeated.

Staring at the ball of seven-colored light, Huang Xiaolong no longer held back as he summoned his dao souls and twelve high-order Saint Fates.

The Huang Long Bloodline in his body awakened at the same time as the golden dragon materialized behind him.

The might of a dragon descended on the lands, and he finally decided to get a little serious.

Just before he could make his move on the little island spirit, he discovered that the look on its face had changed completely. It stared at the golden dragon behind him and stuttered, “Master…”

Master?!

Huang Xiaolong felt his heart trembling. Could it be…?

…

When Long Jianfei and the others realized that the entire island had gone quiet, they couldn’t help but stare at each other in suspicion.

“What’s going on?” Mo Zhi asked. “Did it… Did it end already?”

From the energy fluctuations they had felt earlier, the two of them were like oil and water. The battle didn’t seem like it would end so quickly.

Could an accident have occurred?

The more Long Jianfei thought about it, the uglier his expression became.

Mo Zhi and the others seemed to have thought of the same possibility, and their faces quickly contorted.

“Did something happen to the Mansion Master?!” Mo Zhi’s face sank. “Should we head over to take a look?”

Everyone nodded in unison as they quickly headed over to the Sky Opening Island.

By the time they arrived, they could see that the surroundings were destroyed, and they quickly managed to piece together the battle that went down. Luckily for them, they managed to spot a figure flying towards them.

They could see that there was a weird ball of light beside Huang Xiaolong, and it was a ball of light with distinct facial features and limbs of its own.

Everyone was shocked.

“Young Lord!” “Mansion Master!”

Everyone rushed over to celebrate his return, and Long Jianfei couldn’t help but ask, “Young Lord, are you alright?”

“What can possibly happen to me? Do you really think that I’ll be done in by the island spirit?” Huang Xiaolong joked when he saw their anxious expressions.

Everyone couldn’t help but snicker softly.

“Mansion Master, this… Where did you find this little cutie?” Long Shengtian looked at the seven-colored ball of light and he chuckled. “Where’s the island spirit?”

A burst of air emerged from the little ball’s nose, and it waved its arm at Long Shengtian’s face in greetings.

Before Huang Xiaolong could stop it, the sound of bones breaking filled the skies as Long Shengtian was sent flying backwards at a horrifying speed. In the blink of an eye, he was lying on the ground, far away from where he once stood.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sigh when he thought of Long Shengtian’s fate. He didn’t even need to use his brain to know that Long Shengtian’s face was already unrecognizable.

With a stronger grand dao physique than Long Shengtian, Huang Xiaolong was barely able to withstand a blow to the face by the little spirit. One could only imagine Long Shengtian’s fate.

Seeing as Long Shengtian was sent flying with a single blow from the cute little ball of light, everyone couldn’t help but change the way they looked at it.

They immediately recognized the energy fluctuations coming off the tiny rainbow ball as they had felt the shockwaves during Huang Xiaolong’s battle with the Sky Opening Island Spirit.

Mo Zhi stuttered in denial, “Is this the Sky Opening Island’s spirit?”

He might not know the reason why the cute little rainbow ball was the island spirit, and he might not know the reason why it was following Huang Xiaolong. All he knew was that he had to take a step backwards.

Luckily for all of them, the Sky Opening Island’s spirit returned to Huang Xiaolong’s side and returned to its original silly appearance.

When Long Shengtian finally crawled out from the rubble, he sucked in a cold breath. His face was deformed, and he looked like the definition of a ‘pig head’.

It would be a little too embarrassing to mention that one side of his face swelled more than the other.

Turning to everyone present, Huang Xiaolong finally spoke, “Let me introduce you guys. This is Skylet.” He pointed at the little rainbow ball.
