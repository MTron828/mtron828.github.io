Chapter 3039: Not Selling!

The Stone Ancestor couldn’t help but turn to Huang Xiaolong once again. He tried estimating their strength, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t sense anything. However, he felt that the three headed beast sitting beside Huang Xiaolong was getting more and more familiar.

They seemed to have met in the past, but he couldn't recall where.

A frown formed on his face. After all, he had been in seclusion for quite some time. There was no way he would recognize anyone from the younger generation.

In another private room, Jin Xiaoxiao’s face was too ugly to behold. She needed the Lightning Flame Pills badly, as she needed to stabilize her foundations after entering the Dao Venerable Realm. However, she was frustrated that the b*stard bought it for three billion dao coins as rewards for his slaves!

Wouldn’t that mean that her status was even lower than Peng Fei and Jia Zhen?! She was the Golden Fox Princess for god’s sake!

As for Peng Fei and Jia Zhen, their hands couldn’t stop trembling when they thought about how much money Huang Xiaolong had spent in order to obtain the pills.

Three billion dao coins was something even Zhou Hong and the others couldn’t raise if they sold off everything they had!

The both of them finally realized the reason behind the look of jealousy they got from Zhou Hong and the others when they left.

“The next item is a batch of Vigorous Coiling Dragon Pill! They also came from the Tai Ji Creed, and Eminent Elder Hu Bo personally refined them! The main ingredient is the blood of Dao Venerable Realm coiling dragons, and the other ingredients consist of the Crow Fruit and several hundred other grand dao spiritual fruits!” The pretty auctioneer’s voice rang through the skies.

The Vigorous Coiling Dragon Pill was extremely useful for tempering the body. However, Huang Xiaolong’s previous bid of three billion dimmed the shine of these pills. In the end, they were sold for two hundred million dao coins.

Soon after, bottles after bottles of grand dao herbs were auctioned off. Even though they were pretty valuable, they couldn’t compare to the Lightning Flame Pills Huang Xiaolong had bought earlier. In the end, Jin Xiaoxiao had to settle for a bottle of Heaven Seizing Nature Pills. It was effective for Dao Venerables who just entered the cultivation realm. Of course, they couldn’t compare to the Lightning Flame Pills, but she had no other choice.

Huang Xiaolong might not have raised a bid for the Vigorous Coiling Dragon Pill, but Jin Xiaoxiao was still irritated. During the entire time she was trying to obtain the pills, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even spare them a gaze. It was as though the Vigorous Coiling Dragon Pills were nothing but trash in his eyes.

As someone who was desperately trying to obtain them, she felt as though she was a garbage collector!

Soon after, the forty-first item was up for auction. As the auction neared the end, all the items that came out were items that could tempt experts at the peak-level Dao Venerable Realm. The starting prices of the items started at upwards of a billion dao coins.

Even people like Li Dongjun were unable to meet the starting price for the item.

The auctioneer didn’t waste time, and she started to introduce all five items that would be up for grabs.

First was Jin Xiaoxiao’s Phoenix Fire Crystal, and then a high-grade cosmos artifact-level flying ship was next. A high-grade cosmos artifact level sword would follow, and the last two items would be a strand of origin qi and a piece of mysterious rock.

Out of the five items, everyone knew that the Phoenix Fire Crystal came from Jin Xiaoxiao. After the introduction of the items were over, the crowd went wild.

Even Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu were shocked by the level of items put up for the auction.

They even had a strand of origin qi!

“Holy sh*t! Someone dares to sell a strand of origin qi… Did the Mystical Pavilion put it up for auction? There’s no way anyone else can do something like this…” Lei Yu muttered.

“Too bad it’s not the Tree of Origin!” Huang Xiaolong joked.

Widening his eyes in shock, Lei Yu continued, “If he really has the tree, the main pavilion master of the Mystical Pavilion will definitely keep it somewhere safe. Do you think he’s stupid?”

“I want the strand of origin qi!” Jin Xiaoxiao spoke the moment the items were announced. Even though she didn’t tell, everyone could hear the determination in her voice.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. It was possible the Stone Ancestor and the others had come for the last five items. Otherwise, experts ranked on the Extermination List would never show up to a lowly auction at this level!

“Mysterious rock?” Huang Xiaolong turned his attention to the final item on the list. If the rock could be placed after the origin qi, it had to be something special.

Ordinarily speaking, the last item of an auction would be the most valuable, and the one that sold for the highest price!

Out of the five items, Jin Xiaoxiao’s Phoenix Fire Crystal was placed first. The auctioneer started the bidding off at four billion dao coins. When the starting price was called, Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

“Hehe, this little lass is really cocky. Does she really think the Phoenix Fire Crystal is very desirable?” Lei Yu sneered. After all, the starting price was something set by the person selling the item. For a piece of Phoenix Fire Crystal at this level, it would probably start at three billion dao coins.

Indeed, everyone who planned to bid on the crystal had second thoughts the moment the starting bid was announced.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to start calling out bids either.

“Four billion one hundred million.” Ren Fengyuan broke the silence, and everyone turned to look at him. It seemed as though the Heaven Seizing Chamber of Commerce’s concept of money ws different from the others!”

“Four billion two hundred million.” Stone Ancestor, who had remained silent from the start of the auction, spoke.

Everyone turned to look at him as soon as he spoke.

Ren Fengyuan revealed a bitter expression when he realized that the Stone Ancestor had his eyes on the crystal. If the Stone Ancestor wanted it, he wouldn’t be able to get it no matter how hard he tried.

“Four billion three hundred million.” When everyone thought that the Stone Ancestor was going to obtain the item, someone else raised the price. When the others turned to look at the person who made the bid, they discovered that he was a mysterious-looking man who was clad in black. Traces of black light swirled around his face, and no one managed to see his appearance.

The Stone Ancestor causally called out another bid, unaffected by the mysterious man. “Four billion four hundred million.”

“Four billion five hundred million!” The mysterious black-clothed man raised the bid immediately.

The price soon got to five billion, and the Stone Ancestor frowned and decided to give it up. The reason he had come for the auction wasn’t for the crystal anyway.

“Six billion.” When the black-clothed man thought that he would be able to obtain the crystal, Huang Xiaolong made his move.

Six billion!

Those seated in the venue nearly jumped out of their seats in fright.

Since Huang Xiaolong had stopped bidding for anything else after obtaining the Lightning Flame Pills, everyone had forgotten about him. His bid of six million rang like a thunder in the skies, bringing all the attention back onto him.

Even the Stone Ancestor and Fan Luo couldn’t help but do a double-take.

Dao Jianchou’s gaze burned even brighter. It seemed as though he was going to get rich after the auction ended.

“I’m not selling the crystal to him,” Jin Xiaoxiao’s voice rang through the air all of a sudden. Everyone thought they had heard wrong, but it didn’t seem like she was kidding.
