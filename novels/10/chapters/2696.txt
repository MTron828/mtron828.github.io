Chapter 2697: Divination Creed

“Related to the Yin Borer Race?!” Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Since Long Jianfei could speak about it, the news had to be true. Otherwise, there was no way Long Jianfei would dare to make the report.

“What a troublesome matter… Yuan Wanfei and Elder Ming are there too…” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

The Yin Borer Race wasn’t just the strongest race in the World River! In fact, it was publicly acknowledged as the strongest superpower in all the lands! The World River, the Alien Lands, and the Holy World were in consensus that the Yin Borer Race was the power standing high above the rest. The reason it wasn’t ranked within their domains was because they were a power hiding in the World River.

The Yin Borer King, the ancestor of the Yin Borer Race, was an existence at the peak of the late-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. He was also the only person the Cangqiong Old Man was wary of when adventuring in the World River several billion years ago.

The reason the Yin Borer Race was known as the strongest race was because of the number of Primal Ancestors they had. With four Primal Ancestors holding the fort, the Holy Heavens was the strongest power in the Holy World. There were three Primal Ancestors in the Otherworldly Mansion, but there were seven Primal Ancestors in the Yin Borer Race alone!

Seven!

With seven Primal Ancestors, they could be considered a terrifying power even if their base of operations was in the World River!

“No one knows if the Yin Borer King has entered the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. If he has, then things would get extremely troublesome,” Long Shengtian muttered. “Other than the Cangqiong Old Man, the Yin Borer King is the next in line to break through to the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. Rumor has it that the Yin Borer King’s strength would surpass the Cangqiong Old Man’s the moment he enters the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm. When that happens, he will become the strongest individual in all three regions!”

Everyone felt their hearts sinking when they heard Long Shengtian’s explanation.

An ominous air filled the main hall of the Otherworldly Mansion.

He wasn’t bullsh*tting. The Yin Borer King had fought with the Cangqiong Old Man in the past. Even though the old man was already in the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, he had barely managed to gain the upper hand!

As such, it went without saying that the Yin Borer King would surpass the Cangqiong Old Man the moment he advanced!

As he looked at everyone in the hall with sunken expressions, Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “It’s just the Yin Borer King. Even if he enters the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, he won’t be able to do a thing to us. If he refuses to hand over Yuan Wanfei and Elder Ming, we’ll exterminate his race all the same!”

Before entering the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong would have been a little careful if he had to deal with the Yin Borer King. In fact, he wouldn’t have been confident of taking the other party down. However, everything changed when he entered the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm. Moreover, his cultivation level wasn’t merely at the early or mid-Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm. He had reached the peak of the late-Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm, and he no longer felt intimidated by the Yin Borer King’s strength.

When Mo Zhi and the others heard what he said, they couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile. Exterminate the Yin Borer Race?! Huang Xiaolong should be the only one who could utter such words. Even the Cangqiong Old Man wouldn’t dare to proclaim that he could exterminate the Yin Borer Race with his strength!

“Xiaolong, if the Yin Borer King entered the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, the power he wields is something you cannot imagine. Even with your cultivation at the peak of the late-Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm, you can’t look down on him!” Mo Zhi exclaimed. “According to my estimates, you might not be his opponent unless you enter the Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm!”

Long Shengtian sighed at the side, “Let’s just hope he hasn’t entered the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled when he heard their warnings.

Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor? Haha…

“Get ready. We’ll depart for the World River tomorrow!” Huang Xiaolong declared before dismissing everyone in the hall.

Confused expressions appeared on the faces of everyone present.

…

Half an hour later, everyone finally left the hall and Huang Xiaolong emerged with Long Jianfei following behind him.

“Young Lord, Elder Ming should be closely related to the Yin Borer Race…” Long Jianfei mentioned.

Long Shengtian and the others might have been skeptical of Huang Xiaolong’s strength, but Long Jianfei no longer doubted him. Ever since learning that Huang Xiaolong had the Huang Long Bloodline, his belief in Huang Xiaolong had turned into blind reverence.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have suggested Huang Xiaolong to take the chance to conquer the World River!

After all, he knew of the existence of the Yin Borer Race. The Dragon Fish Race was also a terrifying existence in the World River, and he was extremely clear on the power the Yin Borer Race possessed.

Of course, there was not denying that the Yin Borer Race was pretty damn strong. The Yin Borer King was probably the strongest Primal Ancestor right after the Cangqiong Old Man.

“Oh? Why would you say so?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

Even though Yuan Wanfei and Elder Ming seeked refuge there, it didn’t mean that they had a relationship with the Yin Borer Race.

Moreover, the relationship didn’t seem to be a simple one.

“In the past, I’ve seen the Yin Borer King in action once. The secret art he used might be different from Elder Ming, but the aura they emitted was extremely close. The two of them probably received the same inheritance.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened slightly. “The same inheritance? Could they be from the same power?”

“Elder Ming’s origins are extremely mysterious, and no one knows where he came from. As for the Yin Borer King, his origins are equally mysterious,” Long Jianfei continued, “From the techniques Elder Ming executed in the past, he might be from the Divination Creed in the Divine Tuo Holy World. I found some similarities in the techniques used by Elder Ming and one of their secret arts.”

“Divine Tuo Holy World? Divination Creed?” Huang Xiaolong was shocked. “Are you telling me that Elder Ming and the Yin Borer Race are connected to the Divination Creed in the Divine Tuo Holy World?!”

Long Jianfei nodded slowly. “I’m afraid that is a possibility. I might not be able to confirm the connection as I have no idea how they managed to enter the Cangqiong Holy World.”

Huang Xiaolong felt his heart trembling.

Could it be that the two of them entered a crack in space like Long Jianfei?

Since it was possible for Long Jianfei to enter the Cangqiong Holy World, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t deny the possibility of others entering.

No longer wasting time, Huang Xiaolong inquired about the matters with the Divination Creed.

From Long Jianfei explanation, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Divination Creed was one of the strongest Creeds in the Divine Tuo Holy World. They were considered to be a hegemon who controlled a region of land, and they weren’t weaker than the Dragon Fish Creed.

He also learned that the regions controlled by the Dragon Fish Creed and the Divination Creed were extremely far apart. Ordinarily, the two powers wouldn’t interact with each other.

“Who are those people?” When they were speaking about the matters of the Divination Creed, they ran into a group of people kneeling before the gates of the Otherworldly Royal City.

Slapping his forehead, Long Jianfei exclaimed, “That’s what I forgot! They are the members of the Chen Luo Sect! That’s Sect Master Chen Luo!” He pointed at the middle-aged man who was kneeling in front of the others.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on the man. Was that the strongest human in the Alien Lands?

“Chen Muguang killed plenty of disciples from the Purple Spider Race. According to your orders, I crippled the kid. We threw him into the prison in the Otherworldly Mansion, and the disciples of the enforcement hall have been ordered to punish him according to the laws of the mansion.” Long Jianfei paused for a moment before continuing, “The experts of the Chen Luo Sect kneeled before the gates of the city and begged to meet you. They hope Young Lord can show some mercy to Chen Muguang, and Chen Luo said that he is willing to take on any punishment for his son!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head silently.

That was the care a parent had for their children…

Huang Xiaolong walked towards the members of the Chen Luo Sect, and Chen Luo trembled when he saw that Long Jianfei had arrived. He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, and despite not meeting before, he recognized him instantly. He crawled forward and bawled his eyes out.
