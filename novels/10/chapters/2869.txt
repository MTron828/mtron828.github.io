Chapter 2870: Chen Dingtian

Huang Xiaolong ignored the disturbance taking place outside. Inside the rented courtyard, he was attempting to dispel the absolute poison in Duan Zheng’s dao soul with the cosmos energy of his small worlds.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong did not waste the absolute poison plaguing Duan Zheng’s dao soul, and he absorbed and refined it into his body as he extracted it out of Duan Zheng’s dao soul. Others couldn’t absorb or refine the absolute poison’s power, but Huang Xiaolong with his God of Creation Huang Long Bloodline, could turn it into his own use.

If he successfully refined this absolute poison, Huang Xiaolong would add another absolute power, the power of absolute poison on top of his power of nirvana, absolute frost, and absolute blaze!

Four kinds of absolute powers!

Since Huang Xiaolong absorbed and refined the absolute poison while he expelled it out of Duan Zheng’s body, it slowed down his detoxification speed.

With one night’s effort, he only removed ten percent of poison from Duan Zheng’s body.

The process went on for five consecutive days.

By the end of the fifth day, Huang Xiaolong successfully swept clean the poison from Duan Zheng’s dao soul.

Naturally, during the process, Huang Xiaolong continued to absorb and refine the power of absolute poison from Duan Zheng’s dao soul.

With a wave of his hand, terrifying black gas condensed in the air, and this black gas was darker than any black color in the world. It was even darker than Zhou Hong’s Ink Sword. Just looking at the black gas could give one a hair-raising creepy feeling.

This was the power of absolute poison.

“Pity though… The amount is a little worse.” Huang Xiaolong judged as he looked at the black gas in front of him.

The amount of absolute poison in Duan Zheng’s dao soul wasn’t much. Thus, even though Huang Xiaolong had absorbed the poison from Duan Zheng, the power of absolute poison was a little weak for Huang Xiaolong’s liking. Especially when compared to the power of nirvana, absolute blaze, and absolute frost, the power of absolute poison was definitely the weakest one.

This amount of absolute poison could deal with those below Dao Venerable Realm, but against Dao Venerable experts, expelling this poison was not a big problem for them.

Half a day later, when Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the room, he saw Duan Zheng standing respectfully in the yard with Duan Feng and Long Jianfei. It was clear that Duan Zheng was sober now, and Duan Feng had recounted what had happened to him, as well as told him about Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

“Duan Zheng is grateful for Your Highness’ saving grace!”

When he saw Huang Xiaolong coming out from the room, Duan Zheng hurriedly fell to his knees and respectfully kowtowed to Huang Xiaolong.

Duan Feng also knelt and bowed to Huang Xiaolong.

Duan Zheng was a member of his Duan Family, and on top of that, Duan Zheng was his sibling, his second brother.

Huang Xiaolong had them rise from the ground, and then, he asked Duan Zheng how he had got toxicated by absolute poison.

A few months ago, Duan Zheng’s good friend had found him and revealed to him that he had found a certain Dao Venerable experts’ hidden treasury. The friend had proposed a cooperation to explore the Dao Venerable’s hidden treasury, but they were poisoned just as they had entered the Dao Venerable’s immortal cave. The Dao Venerable expert’s immortal cave was in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave.

After hearing that Dao Venerable expert’s immortal cave was within the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, excitement rose to Duan Feng and Long Jianfei’s faces.

Others were afraid of this absolute poison, but His Highness wasn’t one of them.

“What about your friend?” Duan Feng asked.

Duan Zheng looked indignant. “I entered the immortal cave ahead of him, and after seeing that I was poisoned by absolute poison, he abandoned me and fled!”

And his good friend was a Qiao Family’s disciple from the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Cave.

The Scarlet Blood Heavenly Cave was adjacent to the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and the Qiao Family was one of the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Cave’s top powerhouses.

Duan Feng too was indignant upon hearing that.

Huang Xiaolong asked about the immortal cave’s location, and he learned that it was within the Boundary Emperor Creed’s territory.

The Boundary Emperor Creed was one of the twelve creeds in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, and it was quite a far distance away from the Blue Lotus Creed. From the Blue Lotus Creed, they need to traverse through another creed’s territory to reach the Boundary Emperor Creed.

In a short moment, thoughts raced through Huang Xiaolong’s mind, and he swiftly decided to go to the said immortal cave after coming out from the Blue Lotus Pond.

Regardless of whether there were any grand dao pills or grand dao herbs inside that immortal cave, Huang Xiaolong was bound to make the trip just for the absolute poison. According to Duan Zheng, every corner of the immortal cave was layered with absolute poison. If he could absorb and refine all of the absolute poison, his power of absolute poison would not be weaker than the power of absolute frost and absolute blaze.

At that time, even Dao Venerables won’t be able to cure themselves easily after being exposed to his absolute poison.

Although Huang Xiaolong was interested in that immortal cave’s absolute poison, he wasn’t overly concerned about it. The more important matter was the Huang Long Armor.

It remained a question, when exactly would Huang Shuai advance to Dao Venerable Realm? Before that, he was unable to enter the Dragon Fish Creed. He couldn’t really be waiting until Huang Shuai advanced to Dao Venerable Realm before he could go looking for the Huang Long Armor, right?

However, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t think of any method to enter.

Breaking in by force would only end up in failure. Forget his current strength, even if he was a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, he still wouldn’t be able to break into the Dragon Fish Creed. He would need to advance to Dao Venerable Realm, and he might have a little bit of a chance to succeed.

After all, the Dragon Fish Creed was not some ordinary small creed.

‘Forget it, let’s focus on the Blue Lotus Pond first,’ Huang Xiaolong muttered, shaking his head as if trying to shake away non urgent things.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group of four made their way to the Blue Lotus Pond.

When Huang Xiaolong appeared, many people instantly recognized him. Surprise and astonishment rippled through the crowd.

“He’s that young man who sent Zhou Hong flying out of White Feather City with one punch!”

“What? Is it him?! It’s really an early Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor as they said, but is his combat prowess that shocking? Maybe it’s only a rumor that people exaggerated?”

“It’s no exaggeration. I was on scene at that time! You really can’t imagine that sight. It’s soul shocking! He simply punched out one time… One punch, and he sent Zhou Hong flying out of the White Feather City! At that time, Zhou Hong summoned his Ink Sword and sword spirit!”

“But I’ve heard that after the Ten Swords Creed’s Chen Dingtian heard this news, he left for the Blue Lotus Pond right away. He has sworn to kill this person to avenge his Junior Brother Zhou Hong suffered!”

“What? Chen Dingtian is on his way here? Chen Dingtian is a half-step Dao Venerable! He’s the person chosen by the Ten Swords’ Blood Sword! A Dao Rankings List expert! If Chen Dingtian is really coming here, this young man’s dead for sure! If I were him, I would be running for my life now!”

“Run? Where can he run to? With the Ten Swords Creed’s power, who can run? Unless the Dragon Fish Creed is willing to step out and protect him, this young man’s bound to fall!”

Discussions of the surrounding experts were caught by Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

“The Blood Sword’s chosen one, Chen Dingtian, is coming here?” Long Jianfei scoffed coldly, “Looks like they didn’t put what Your Highness said to heart.”

Huang Xiaolong had previously warned the Ten Swords Creed’s disciples that he would destroy the dao physique and completely abolish the cultivation of anyone pursuing him!

However, Chen Dingtian was rushing over!

Clearly, they had chosen to disregard Huang Xiaolong’s warning.

“Your Highness, if Chen Dingtian’s really here for you, then…?” Duan Feng asked.

“Destroy!” Huang Xiaolong spoke the words unhurriedly, looking indifferent.

Since the Ten Swords Creed took his words as a passing breeze, he would make them remember that his words were never a bluff.

“It is said that Chen Dingtian has entered half-step Dao Venerable for many years, and he has completely merged into one with the Blood Sword. He is a very powerful person. Hearsay is that the average First Esteem Dao Venerables can’t even take one sword from him!” Duan Zheng shared what he knew.

Although he had some understanding of Huang Xiaolong’s strength from Duan Feng, Duan Zheng didn’t know how strong Huang Xiaolong really was. Hence, he couldn’t help but worry when he heard Chen Dingtian was coming for them.
