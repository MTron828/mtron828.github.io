“You, you, what did you say?! That son of a d*g cleared the twelfth floor!” The news sounded like a thunderclap in Song Litao’s mind. His eyes lost a little luster, then his neck jerked up, looking at the peak of the Holy Mountain.

Song Litao finally noticed that there was a gigantic ancient building above the Holy Mountain, silently hovering, enshrouded in resplendent halos.

There was no need to think as it was obvious that this building was ‘Heaven,’ which had never appeared before!

After a wave of shock and disbelief, Song Litao’s face was even more distorted. He hollered in fury, “It was this bast*rd, it’s this bast*ard, no wonder I didn’t even get one holy fruit!”

“No wonder I didn’t even get one holy fruit after clearing ten floors!”

Murderous aura surged from Song Litao’s body, and his eyes had turned scarlet.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors were stunned at the information in Song Litao’s enraged bellow. Not even one holy fruit! At this moment, they finally realized why their Young Lord’s face was so dark and gloomy when he came out.

Song Litao looked at ‘Heaven’ hovering in the ninth heaven. He pictured the Asura noble smiling complacently looking at the grandmist treasures inside ‘Heaven’ while he didn’t even get one holy fruit. Not to mention, his bone-age would exceed the Holy Mountain’s limit by the Holy Mountain’s next appearance, and he would no longer be able to enter the Holy Mountain!

These chains of negative results further stimulated Song Litao’s outrage.

“Everyone attack, and destroy this fart of a ‘Heaven’ for me!” Song Litao suddenly shrieked as he pointed at the ‘Heaven’ that was hovering above the Holy Mountain. And he was the first one to draw out his divine blade, swinging out in attack.

Seeing his series of actions, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors broke out in cold sweat and swiftly pulled Song Litao back.

Looking at Song Litao’s murderous face, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors quickly recounted the incident, where ‘Heaven’ had killed several hundred Ancestors in a second.

Song Litao’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest listening to the Ancestors recount, and his eyelids twitched uncontrollably like a belated ominous feeling.

Right at this time, there was a flash of light at the Holy Mountain’s first floor entryway. Everyone saw Shi Yinyu and Qin Huangzhong flying out together.

The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe and Fengdu City’s experts hurried towards them.

Shi Yinyu couldn’t hide his shock hearing the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts report that Huang Xiaolong had cleared all the way to the twelfth floor, and had entered ‘Heaven.’

Although Shi Yinyu’s reaction was ‘milder’ than Song Litao’s, his expression wasn’t too good either.

Subsequently, the Misty Palace’s He Jingyi, Dark Roc Race’s Wu Kun, Peng Zhengfei, Ji Chen, and the others also exited the Holy Mountain.

He Jingyi was in a dumbfounded daze when her subordinates reported to her that the Asura noble who sat from across her in the Yin Yang Restaurant had cleared all the way to the Holy Mountain’s twelfth floor and was currently inside ‘Heaven.’ Her cherry lips were slightly agape for a long time.

“He, when did he clear the twelfth floor?” A long time later, He Jingyi asked one of the Misty Palace’s Ancestors as she came back to her senses.

The Ancestor replied honestly, “He cleared the twelfth floor a little over five years ago, and has been inside ‘Heaven’ for five years now. The strange thing is that he hasn’t come out yet.”

“You, you mean, he, he cleared all the twelve floors in less than seven years?!” He Jingyi’s delicate face was filled with astonishment.

“It is so, Young Palace Lord. He cleared the first two floors in less than an hour! Three floors in half a day, and he ascended to the fourth floor in less than three days!...” The Misty Palace’s Ancestor reported the duration Huang Xiaolong had spent on each floor.

Despite witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s progress on the Holy Mountain with his own eyes, his voice quivered and he felt surreal as he reported the matter to He Jingyi.

He Jingyi’s heart raced listening to the record breaking speed.

Hailed as the Misty Palace’s new generation of genius, and acknowledged as one of Asura World’s three elite geniuses, He Jingyi had always been proud of her peerlessness, but now...!

She looked up at ancient ‘Heaven’ with a complicated expression.

The geniuses, who came out from the Holy Mountain after He Jingyi, also learned that someone had passed the twelfth floor from their subordinates or elders. To their surprise it was the Asura noble who had bought the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin at the auction!

For a moment, the crowd above the Nethersea was in a furor.

Suddenly, someone exclaimed, “It’s the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch! The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch personally came to the Nethersea!”

Several people followed that man’s line of sight and others followed them. In the distance, a group of giant experts with dense death qi accelerated in their direction. The person at the front of the group was none other than the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang!

Behind Shi Wushuang were the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s thirty high-level Emperor Realm Ancestors!

Shi Wushuang’s group arrived in an overwhelming momentum making the others feel suffocated.

There were apprehensions on other forces’ Ancestors’ faces, as they watched the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s group.

Shi Wushuang was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s second strongest person! His strength shook heaven and earth. He ranked right below the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming. According to rumors, although Shi Wushuang’s cultivation had yet to surpass the Emperor Realm, his strength was comparable to those that had surpassed the Emperor Realm.

Shi Yinyu was delighted seeing his father’s arrival. Together with the experts by his side, Shi Yinyu flew towards Shi Wushuang.

“Lord Father!” Shi Yinyu greeted him respectfully as he arrived in front of Shi Wushuang.

Shi Wushuang nodded his head at his son, with a small smile on his face as he asked, “How is your result through the Holy Mountain?”

Shi Yinyu smiled and replied respectfully, “I passed the eleventh floor.” He lowered his voice before adding, “However, I was in second place from the first to the fifth floor, and in third place from the sixth floor and above.”

Shi Wushuang’s smile widened, “Very good! When we return to the Nine Yin Divine Mountain, your Old Ancestor and I will assist you in refining the holy fruits, and breaking through to Emperor Realm!”

Shi Yinyu was thrilled. “Many thanks, Lord Father!”

At this time, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Song Litao and Howling Moon Wolf Race’s Yi Qing flew towards Shi Wushuang with their group of people. When they were within a respectful distance from Shi Wushuang, both stopped and saluted respectfully, “Greetings Senior Wushuang.”

Shi Wushuang nodded smilingly, then said, “My two nephews look spirited. It seems like both of you have comprehended the chaos law, and advancing to Emperor Realm is only a matter of time.”

“Senior Wushuang is overpraising us.” Song Litao and Yi Qing responded politely.

Compared to the time at Nirvana City more than a decade ago, the Howling Moon Wolf Race’s Yi Qing’s strength had indeed risen significantly, but because he was injured by Huang Xiaolong, his performance in the Holy Mountain had been less than ideal. Although his injuries had more or less healed, the benefits he had obtained within the Holy Mountain were less than Song Litao.

Shi Wushuang turned around and looked at the surrounding experts of various forces. He began nonchalantly, “I believe everyone here already knows the reason why I, Shi Wushuang, is here today. Thus, I request all of you to retreat ten million miles radius away and not interfere in the affairs of my Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, and Howling Moon Wolf Race, or else, don’t blame me for being rude.”

An overpowering killing intent surged out from Shi Wushuang’s body, frightening the surrounding experts several steps back.

The Misty Palace’s He Jingyi, Qin Huangzhong, Wu Deng, and the others also quickly led their forces’ experts to retreat outside of ten million li radius.

At this time, no one dared to throw themselves at the spear tip of the triad forces’ alliance.

In just a few moments, within ten million li radius from the Holy Mountain, only Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Wan Yutian, and also the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin Hao Ren were left standing, apart from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s triad alliance force.

Standing ten million li radius away, all the experts watched holding their breaths. Never had they felt so nervous before. There was a heavy tension in the air as a battle was about to breakout.

This was going to be an epic battle! A battle that could be seen only in a billion years!
