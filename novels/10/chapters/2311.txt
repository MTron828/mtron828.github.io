Chapter 2312: Arriving at the Holy Heavens!

Transcending the six dao paths and reincarnation would render his soul inextinguishable!

Even True Saint Realm experts wouldn’t be able to kill him when that happened!

“Senior Di Huai, will the Holy River in the Emperor Yu Holy Grounds only be open every million years?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Di Huai and asked.

A stunned expression appeared on Di Huai’s face. “What? Are you planning to enter again?” He knew that Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain a whole ton of benefits when cultivating in the Holy River. As such, he joked, “The gaze Emperor Yu had in his eyes caused my head to go numb when you left the Holy River! Don’t tell me you didn’t see it....”

“If you took the chance to enter again, he will probably duke it out with me!”

The energy in the Holy River was something they had to accumulate for a long period of time. They had only managed to gather a little bit of energy in a million years, and Huang Xiaolong had practically sucked it dry the moment he had entered. It was no wonder Emperor Yu was devastated when Huang Xiaolong had emerged.

“Even though it’s only open once every million years, the effects of going in a second time will never match up to the first.”

Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of disappointment in his heart.

He wanted to transform his divine soul completely, but it seemed as though his plan was toast.

A bitter smile appeared on his face. If he had known that his divine soul would evolve in the Holy River, he would have waited for a better time!

“I know of another place with a place like the Holy River...” Di Huai said all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes slowly widened, and a look of joy appeared in them. “Where?!”

“It’s in the headquarters of the Holy Heavens!”

?!

Di Huai nodded slowly. “That’s right. There’s a massive lake in the headquarters of the Holy Heavens. It’s a fire and ice dual attributed lake and the effects of cultivating in it are several times better than the Holy River of the Emperor Yu Holy Grounds! Every few years, the Holy Heavens holds a massive competition among the Holy Princes. The top three will be allowed to cultivate in the Ice and Fire Lake!

“Holy Princes’ competition....” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

“That’s right! However, you need to be in the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm to even think of fighting for the top three spots! The disciples who managed to obtain a slot in the past have godheads ranking in the top ten!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

With his terrifying cultivation speed, he would be able to enter the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm in two to three thousand years! The only problem was the advancement of his saint attributes!

Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong would be trashed by the disciples fighting for the top three slots even if he arrived at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

...

In the blink of an eye, six years passed.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave the ship, and he cultivated non-stop for the entirety of the six years they spent on the journey.

Occasionally, he would look for Di Huai to chat about the matters of the Holy World. There were also times when he would ask about the happenings in the other holy grounds.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong learned that there were four peak powers in the Holy World.

The Holy Heavens, the Devil Palace, the Holy Lands Alliance, and the Clear Snow Palace made up the four pillars of the Holy World.

Out of the four of them, the Holy Heavens was the strongest organization, followed by the Devil Palace, the Holy Lands Alliance, and the Clear Snow Palace, in that order.

The Holy Lands Alliance was headed by the strongest holy ground in the Holy World, the Levitation Holy Grounds! They formed an alliance with various super holy grounds and held considerable strength.

Even though they had no experts who surpassed the True Saint Realm to hold the fort, they were the ones with the most number of peak-level True Saint Realm experts.

As for the Clear Snow Palace, it was founded by a senior who transcended the True Saint Realm going by the name of Chen Qingxue. As a female cultivator herself, she only accepted female disciples into the palace.

Of the four superpowers, the Holy Heavens and the Clear Snow Palace were the strictest when it came to their disciple selection process.

The Devil Palace was a very big exception. As the power structure of the palace was too complicated, they didn’t restrict their disciples nor did they follow strict criteria when accepting disciples.

One fine day, the flying ship stopped.

As they disembarked, the sight of a massive holy ground appeared before Huang XIaolong and the others, causing them no small amount of shock.

“Is this the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds?!”

The headquarters of the Holy Heavens was located in the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds!

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong, and the others had passed by countless holy grounds, and none of them could compare to the massive continent before them.

There wasn’t a need to compare the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground to it as it was merely a speck of dust when compared to it!

“You’re right!” Di Huai stared at the Holy Grounds before him, and a look of awe appeared in his eyes.

After stopping for a moment, the group of them flew towards the core of the holy grounds.

Even though it looked closer, they took half a day before they managed to enter the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds. After entering, they found their way towards the Heavenly Master Holy City.

The sight before them caused their minds to shake when they entered the city.

Flying ships lined the air and divine beasts lined the streets. Groups and groups of experts made their way about the bustling city.

In any holy ground, a half-True Saint was someone who stood at the peak of the power chain. They would appear occasionally during special events, but half-True Saints could be seen in nearly every group that appeared on the streets in the holy city!

Of course, those that Huang Xiaolong noticed were only low-level half-True Saints. Fourth Tribulation half-True Saints were still rarely seen on the streets.

Golden light surrounded the holy city, and it stood high in the air above countless mountain ranges, oceans, and several massive ancient forests.

People streamed about the streets, and not a single location was neglected.

“The land here can be said to be worth its weight in gold. One might not even be able to buy residences in the cities around the Holy City, much less in the city itself.” Di Huai looked at Huang Xiaolong before explaining. “Only inner disciples are allowed to purchase a manor in the Holy City itself. If you wish to buy a piece of land, you will need to enter the core of the Holy Heavens!”

“Only core disciples can obtain a piece of land in the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds to build their strength!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He knew everything that Di Huai was saying. However, he also knew that in order to become a core disciple, he would need to enter the half-True Saint Realm. Moreover, not every half-True Saint had the chance to become a core disciple. They had to pass through tons of tests and contribute heavily to the Holy Heavens in order to do so!

Half a month later, they crossed countless cities and arrived in the Holy Heavens City!
