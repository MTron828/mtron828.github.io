Chapter 3708: Entering the Universe Space

As Huang Xiaolong had changed his appearance before entering the ship, Pangu couldn’t recognize him immediately.

Pangu wasn’t the only one who was shocked. Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect to meet Pangu there either.

“Xiaolong, were you captured too?” That was Pangu’s first reaction when he saw Huang Xiaolong.

Despair filled his heart, and he sighed in resignation, “It’s over. If you were captured, no one would be able to save me from this place!”

Huang Xiaolong was shocked. He didn’t think that Pangu would worry about the person who would save him the moment they met.

“Master, even if I was captured, I’ll think of a way to get you out!” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Pangu shook his head and sighed. “You have no idea. This group of people claims to be the first race born with the universes. They have several thousand half-step Universe Gods in their ranks!”

“As long as one is captured by them, we will never be able to escape!”

“They even have several experts who broke through the 20 billion units mark. Not even experts who have several hundred million units of grand cosmos energy can stand against them!”

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Is that what they told you?”

“Yeah. We were frequently beaten up on our way here. The person in charge of the ship told us everything. No one knows if it's true. However, we are pretty sure he’s not lying from how he said it.”

Huang Xiaolong continued to ask, “Did they say how strong their Lord Yin Xue is?”

Pangu shook his head and sighed, “They didn’t say anything about him.”

“Lord Pangu, who is this?” a God of Creation at the grand completion stage asked.

All of them might come from different places, but they were prisoners who were about to suffer the same fate. As such, they formed pretty good relationships with each other.

“This is my disciple!” A proud expression could be seen on Pangu’s face when he introduced Huang Xiaolong.

“Your disciples?! Is he also a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage?!” someone else asked.

Pangu finally realized the fact that Huang Xiaolong had already reached the peak of the grand completion stage. With shock in his eyes, he turned to Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone there might not know that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds, but he knew!

How in the world could they capture him with his strength?

At the very best, the person in charge of the operation should possess 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Seeing how Huang Xiaolong was winking his eyes, Pangu realized what was going on.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand casually and laid down a brand on their souls. He controlled every single God of Creation instantly.

He discovered that the Universe First Race also laid down a brand on their souls. It was too bad their restriction was no match for Huang Xiaolong. He was able to quickly take over.

As for Pangu, Huang Xiaolong erased the soul brand completely. With his strength, the members of the Universe First Race would never be able to discover his methods.

After he was done, he controlled the members of the Universe First Race driving the boat.

The captain of the experts on the ship was an expert in his own right, but he only had 11 billion units of grand cosmos energy. No one could put up any resistance against Huang Xiaolong.

Very quickly, the flying ship arrived at the entrance of the ship. After flashing Yin Xue’s plaque, they were allowed to enter. Along their way, they were checked multiple times.

When they finally entered the Universe Vault, Huang Xiaolong stood on top of the ship as he took in the sights. Pangu was beside him and the master-and-disciple duo gasped in shock.

“Is this actually real?!” Pangu muttered when he looked all around him.

There were countless stars surrounding them as fluffy clouds drifted all about. Starlight fell onto the clouds and a picturesque scene was painted.

Even though there wasn’t a sun, it was bright enough. The entire space gave off a refreshing vibe, unlike anything Huang Xiaolong had seen.

“The spiritual energy here is too pure!” Pangu wiggled his nose like a husky as he cried out.

Turning to Huang Xiaolong he asked, “Why don’t we stay here for some time before leaving?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Weren’t you praying for me to get you out when you were captured?”

“I didn’t think this would be such a nice place…”

“Alright. Just let me know when you wish to leave. I’ll pick you up then.”

The flying ship continued on its way deeper into the Universe Vault.

Huang Xiaolong and Pangu didn’t return to the interior of the ship as they discussed the dao on the deck. He asked Pangu about everything that happened in recent years.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t been gone for long when Pangu decided to tour the universes. He had no idea how the members of the Huang Family were doing.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the past millions of years, Pangu managed to increase his strength a little. Of course, it was far from Huang Xiaolong.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

Pangu sighed when he spoke to Huang Xiaolong. “Right now, I can’t even qualify to be your student…”

After discussing the dao with Huang Xiaolong, he discovered that his disciple’s understanding of the grand dao had far surpassed his.

“Nonsense. You will always be my teacher.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

When Pangu saw the serious look on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he laughed, “Brat, of course, I’m your teacher! I won’t accept it if you try to take me in as your disciple!”

Laughter filled the air.

After several more months, they finally arrived in Yin Xue’s city.

The moment the flying ship stopped, the members of the Universe First Race escorted Huang Xiaolong and the others out. They caught sight of a massive city sitting in a snowy plains. The entire city was refined from a special type of frosted metal essence and it spanned countless miles.

Huang Xiaolong summoned his dao souls instantly.

From the memories of those from the Universe First Race, Yin Xue was an expert whose combat strength passed the 20 billion mark. He was the oldest disciple of the Heaven Devouring King!

Also, she was a lady!

When they arrived, they went through another round of stringent checks before they were escorted to the dungeons.

Huang Xiaolong looked around only to discover that the entire structure was made from a special type of icy metal. There were complicated formations around the area and the moment they were activated, not even someone like the Limitless Master would be able to escape.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong could leave anytime he wanted. Now, not even the Heaven Devouring King could stop him, much less his disciple.

Other than those who just arrived, there were more than a hundred people there. From the looks of it, they were captured in the past.

When they were still looking around, the prisoners started to gather around them with weird looks in their eyes.
