“Though the rumors may not be entirely true, what do we do if he’s really Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son?” The Desolate Giant Tai Yue frowned deeply as he asked the others.

The Asura King Jin Yuan let out a hearty laughter hearing Tai Yue’s question, “If our new master is really Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son, all the more better! At that time, we’ll have Jiang Hong’s support, and even if Lu Kun’s cultivation breaks through, surpassing the Emperor Realm, and he joins hands with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Ancestor, we don’t need to be afraid of them! Don’t forget, there’s King of Grandmist behind Jiang Hong!”

“That’s right, that’s right, if our new master is Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son, then we would have Jiang Hong and the King of Grandmist’s assistance. In that case, why would we need to be afraid of Lu Kun, that egg of a bird?” The Demon King Fan Hui laughed wantonly. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Desolate Giant Tai Yue was stunned, looking stupefied, then laughed loudly as he agreed, “Haha, why didn’t I think of these? Correct, correct, if that is the case, then we have nothing to be afraid of Lu Kun joining hands with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Ancestor. The new master would be able to inherit the master’s heritage without a glitch, take over master’s reign over Hell, and the three worlds!”

“But we aren’t certain if this Duwei is Huang Xiaolong or not, much less determine if he’s our future new master!” The Asura King Jin Yuan added, “It’s too early to speak of these things right now!”

“We, old guys haven’t gone out in a long time.” The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian swung his arms around, loosening his muscles as he spoke.

“Go out?” The Demon King Fan Hui repeated dazedly, but his eyes brightened in the next moment as he gushed excitedly, “Old Wan, you’re suggesting...?”

The Golden Lionman Wan Yutian laughed readily, “That Duwei will be taking part in the assessment in five days, don’t you guys want to watch his performance?”

The corners of the Asura King Jin Yuan’s mouth curved into a meaningful smile as he said, “What a suggestion! The four of us should make a trip to that Brookspring Plane and watch Duwei’s performance in the assessment, we can see if he has a darkness element supreme godhead. If he does have a darkness element godhead, it’s fifty percent certain that he’s our new master!”

“Good, then let the four of us antiques take a walk outside!”

“But we won’t be able to reach the Brookspring Plane on time even if we fly at our fastest speed, unless we use the Netherking Flying Ship the old master left us.”

In the vast universe, there were less than ten top-grade grandmist flying ships. The lord of Hell had one, named the Netherking Flying Ship.

Moreover, the Netherking Flying Ship was infinitely close to a grandmist treasure.

Without delay, the four tore a hole in space and disappeared into the void. A radiant black light flashed and an enormous giant ship appeared in front of them.

This enormous flying ship was anchored in space, exuding a palpitating aura like a majestic king overlooking its subjects—domineering, distinguished, and reclusive.

Looking at the Netherworld King’s Jade, there was a complicated expression on their faces, remembering many memories of the past where their old master, the Lord of Hell, had slaughtered through the ten directions on the Netherking Flying Ship. That sight made their blood run wild.

In the past, even peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts could not withstand one hit from the Netherking Flying Ship. No one knew how many late-Tenth Order, and peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts’ blood had soaked into the body of this Netherking Flying Ship!

The four stared at the Netherking Flying Ship in silence.

“Let’s go up!” A while later, the Asura King Jin Yuan broke the glum atmosphere and boarded the Netherking Flying Ship in a flicker, appearing in the control hall.

Tai Yue, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian also appeared inside the control hall in a flicker.

“I really miss following the old master, slaughtering in the four directions on this Netherking Flying Ship ah.” Fan Hui sighed with melancholy.

“If this Duwei is really the successor the old master has chosen, we won’t have to wait for long!" Tai Yue followed. A strong momentum rose from his body, raising a tempest in the surrounding space.

"It was the most thrilling of times, the ten of us battling the Devil World’s twelve Archdevils.” Asura King Jin Yuan said nostalgically.

“The Devil World’s Archdevil Lord Wu Tian has also been missing for many years, even the three of the Twelve Archdevils under him are missing!” Tai Yue shook his head and went on, “All forces are waiting to see the birth of a new Archdevil Lord, but I wonder who could it be!”

“Even though Hell and the Devil World have fought a lot of battles against each other, we don’t really have any deep grudges. On the contrary, remembering the scenes of those battles makes it feel like we’re meeting with old friends.”

“Let’s go! The four of us will work together to drive this flying ship to the Brookspring Plane.” Asura King Jin Yuan immediately circulated his chaos godforce and channeled it into the Netherking Flying Ship’s core array.

The Netherking Flying Ship rumbled then disappeared in space in a streak of light. In the next second, the flying ship was several hundred million miles away.

While the four of them headed towards the Brookspring Plane on the Netherking Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong was pacing around his newly-purchased residence in Mongolia City. Although this residence was not big, the decorations were quite tasteful, with spiritual flowers planted all around which were pleasing to the eyes.

Standing in the yard, two black glistening blades appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hands in the flash of a light. They were the Blades of Asura.

Despite several times of reforging, he had maintained the Blades of Asura’s original shapes as they were in the lower realm.

The blades’ surface reflected black rays of light and exuded a familiar slaughter qi. Huang Xiaolong traced his finger along the blade’s body, muttering absent-mindedly to himself, "Master, where could you be?’

After arriving in this universe, he had worshipped several others as Master. Each of these Masters had treated him well but he had an unexplainable feelings and a longing for Ren Wokuang, the Master he had never seen before.

Then, Huang Xiaolong’s figure turned blurry as he swung the Blades of Asura in his hands.

Countless wind blades appeared in the yard, like hell tempest, spinning in the yard.

This was the first move from the Asura Sword Skills, the Tempest of Hell.

Huang Xiaolong leaped into the air in the next moment and the numerous blade lights from the Blades of Asura in his hands turned into drops of rain, covering the whole yard.

The second move from the Asura Sword Skills was the Tears of Asura.

The third move, the fourth move....

Soon, Huang Xiaolong had executed all of the Asura Sword Skills’ eighteen moves once over.

Even though Huang Xiaolong hadn’t practiced the Asura Sword Skills for a long time, every move seemed to have imprinted in his soul that he could execute them easily.

Huang Xiaolong’s movements became faster, filling the residence with vigorous blade qi, however, these blade qi did not harm any wood, or walls, nor a petal in the residence.

Soon, four days went by.

In these four days, Huang Xiaolong studied the Tianwu Array Records during the days, occasionally practicing his Asura Sword Skills, while during the night, he would consume grandmist spiritual pills and cultivate.

When cultivating at night, the Black Dragon Divine Armor inside his body would surface by itself in the form of nine black dragons, swallowing dragon qi from the Dragon World that tempered Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique and godheads.

With the Black Dragon Divine Armor, Huang Xiaolong discovered that his cultivation speed had increased significantly compared to before.

On the fourth day, while Huang Xiaolong spent his days immersed in comprehending the Tianwu Array Records and practicing Asura Sword Skills, the Mongolia City’s transmission array lit up and a group of people stepped out.

The person leading this group was the Gu Family’s Inspector Gu Zheng and Gu Family’s branch family’s Ancestor Gu Fei.
