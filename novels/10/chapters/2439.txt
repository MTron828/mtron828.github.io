Chapter 2440: Yang Bone Tree

Shen Jiewen wasn’t the only one who passed down the order. In the main hall of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate, Duan Xuan ordered Fang Xing to do the exact same thing.

Eventually, the leaders of the various superpowers laid down the same order.

Huang Xiaolong had no idea what was going down, but he knew that the various origin herbs he could find in the market were his.

During the apprenticeship ceremony in the past, Huang Xiaolong had accepted the gifts of the various superpowers, and he could be said to be extremely rich. When he had obtained the Four Seas Treasury and killed various True Saints along the way, his wealth had grown to an unimaginable size.

Even if Huang Xiaolong lacked something, it certainly wouldn’t be money!

The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared on the streets, he was recognized by the various disciples from the superpowers. They discussed the matters of the challenge in hushed voices, and they shook their heads from time to time. It was clear that they were not optimistic about Huang Xiaolong’s chances.

Words like ‘loser’ and ‘shameless’ entered his ears from time to time.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel like messing with them. After all, one couldn’t kill someone on the streets because they spoke ill of you.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the largest merchant house in the Mirage Pavilion, he discovered that it was a branch of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce.

The Eternal Chamber of Commerce was the behemoth in the Holy World, and it was the number one financial power.

“Their name is pretty unique....” Yu Ming laughed. “Wouldn’t it be funnier if they changed their name to Eternal Memory Chamber of Commerce?”

Everyone laughed as Huang Xiaolong led the way into the main hall.

As the branch of the largest chamber of commerce in the Holy World, the number of people that came to shop around couldn’t be counted. There were tons of people in the hall and the attendants were fully occupied.

When Huang Xiaolong entered, the noisy hall fell silent as everyone stared at him. Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the various experts and discovered a group of people surrounding the heart of the hall. Even people like Xie Bufan and Dou Rui were present along with the experts of the various superpowers.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second when he saw such a luxurious lineup.

Question marks popped up in his mind as he had no idea why all of them were present.

“I see that Junior Brother Huang has the time to shop around when the battle is just around the corner...,” Xie Bufan couldn’t help but snicker when he saw Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong responded placidly when he heard the mocking tone in Xie Bufan’s voice. “If you’re free enough to mess about in the city, can’t I do the same?”

Xie Bufan couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

As he slowly made his way towards the center of the hall, everyone shoved each other to move out of his way.

As soon as he arrived, he saw a delicate tree growing in the middle of the hall. Even though it was only half a meter tall, the trunk of the tree was the size of an adult male’s arm.

However, the tree had already withered and burned marks could be seen on the branches. The tree seemed devoid of life as death qi swirled around it.

“Yang Bone Tree?!” Huang Xiaolong was taken aback. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Good eye. You managed to recognize it instantly.” Xie Bufan laughed. “The Eternal Chamber of Commerce took this out several days ago. They even said that they would give the tree away to whoever manages to revive it.”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled in excitement.

The Yang Bone Tree was one of the most mysterious trees in the Holy World. A branch resembling a human’s bone would grow from the tree, and that was also the reason it gained its name. The branch of the Yang Bone Tree was extremely useful, and it was something more precious than a pile of holy herbs combined! Of course, the leaves of the tree were extremely useful, and one could choose to refine them directly. Even though the leaves couldn’t compare to ordinary holy herbs, they were much better than level-ten origin spiritual pills.

If Huang Xiaolong could bring the tree back to life, he wouldn’t have to worry about depleting his inventory of level-ten origin spiritual pills.

Cultivators in the Half-True Saint Realm needed to undergo holy tribulation and cultivators in the True Saint Realm needed to undergo dao tribulation. Similar to cultivators, spiritual objects like the Yang Bone Tree had to undergo tribulation in order to grow. It seemed as though the Yang Bone Tree in the middle of the hall had failed to cross its tribulation.

“Does Junior Brother Huang Xiaolong plan on reviving the tree?” Xie Bufan saw the look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he guessed. “Ever since they took it out, there were more than a thousand experts who tried to revive it. I even used a secret art from my Devil Palace, but I failed to give it life.”

Even Second Heaven True Saints like him had failed. Hence, he was confident that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to do anything to the tree.

Ignoring the mockery in Xie Bufan’s words, Huang Xiaolong called the manager of the branch over. “Will the tree be mine if I succeed in reviving it?”

A smile appeared on the manager’s face, and he confirmed, “That’s right! If Your Highness manages to return life to the Yang Bone Tree, it will belong to Your Highness! Of course, we only wish for you to give us two branches and twenty leaves as compensation.”

It was clear that the Eternal Chamber of Commerce wasn’t planning to make a loss.

Since they knew that the tree would wither in their hands, they might as well give it away to someone who could revive the tree. In the process, they would even be able to obtain two branches and twenty leaves.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly, and he started moving towards the tree.

However, Xie Bufan’s irritating voice rang through the hall before he could do anything, “Junior Brother Huang, are you sure you wish to try? Why don’t we make a little bet?”

Huang Xiaolong’s interest was finally piqued. This was the only useful thing Xie Bufan had said the entire day.... “What do you want to bet on?”

“If Junior Brother Huang manages to revive the tree in an hour, I will give you my jade fan. If you fail, I want your Dual-Pupiled Profound Beast!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he heard the conditions. “Alright. I’ll make the bet with you.”

The jade fan in Xie Bufan’s hand was no ordinary item. At the very least, it was a holy artifact, and it was indeed enough for Huang Xiaolong to agree to place the bet.

When he finally arrived before the withered tree, Huang Xiaolong gathered a ball of light in his hands before pushing it towards the trunk of the tree. In an instant, the scars started to fade and the burned marks dissipated.

“This?!” Xie Bufan widened his eyes in shock. No matter how hard he had tried, the tree had failed to show signs of recovery! However, Huang Xiaolong merely touched it, and the scars on the tree disappeared!

Dou Rui and the other experts couldn’t believe their eyes.

The main hall exploded instantly as everyone expressed their shock.

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he knew that it wasn’t too difficult to save the tree. As long as someone had an all attributed saint godhead, they would be able to use the various attributes to bring life back to the tree. After all, the water attribute was extremely useful when it came to curing wounds. The earth attributes could solidify the foundation of the tree and not much needs to be said for the wood attribute. The fire attribute countered the injuries the tree suffered during its tribulation and the lightning attribute soothed the hidden threat left behind by the Yang Bone Tree’s tribulation.

With the assistance of the various attributes, the Yang Bone Tree came back to life.

Of course, it only managed to revive so quickly because of Huang Xiaolong’s terrifyingly strong saint attributes. If Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes were ranked in the hundreds, he wouldn’t be able to save the tree in an hour. He would have taken several days to return life to the tree, and if his saint attributes ranked in the thousands, he would have probably been able to save the tree if he took several years.

As Xie Bufan stared at the disappearing wounds on the tree, his expression started to sink.
