Chapter 2490: I'll Enter the Top 10!

Various disciples spoke up after hearing what Chen Yi said.

“Alright! Let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled as that was his intention all along.

It was true that the City of Light sold precious treasures not found in the outside world. All of them were found by experts who entered the Ghost Devil City.

Since there was only a single Ghost Devil City, the treasures found inside wouldn’t be found anywhere else.

After leaving the Holy Heavens’ branch in the City of Light, Huang Xiaolong led a group of disciples to the market in the center of the city.

Even though more than sixty disciples had signed up for the Trial of Blood, nearly fifty of them followed behind Huang Xiaolong as they made their way towards the market.

A pitiful number of disciples crowded around Li Chen, forming a stark contrast.

The expressions on the faces of Li Chen, Xie Yao, and the others were unsightly when they saw the group following behind Huang Xiaolong.

Ever since the battle in the Mirage Pavilion, Li Chen’s prestige had taken a big hit. Several holy princes who were close to him started to distance themselves. Right now, the only ones who stood by him were Xie Yao, Chen Kaiping, Lin Yijia, and several others. No, it was more appropriate to say that only those who could benefit from being by Li Chen’s side or those who had no other choice remained.

“Pei! Huang Xiaolong has finally shown his true colors. After looking at that smug look on his face, I can’t wait to crush his head into the ground. I’ll trample on his corpse and spit on his grave!” Xie Yao glared at Huang Xiaolong’s departing figure and spat hatefully.

Lin Yijia continued, “Let’s see what happens to that arrogant b*stard when we enter the Ghost Devil City in three days. As soon as we enter, Tyrant Chu will no longer be able to protect him. Even if he begs for mercy, no one will be able to save him!”

“Let’s go. We’re heading to the market too,” Li Chen spoke all of a sudden.

Xie Yao and the others stared at him in shock.

However, they soon broke into laughter. “Alright! We’ll buy whatever he sets his eyes on later! Isn’t he acting all high and mighty? We’ll just outdo him!” Xie Yao sneered.

“There’s no need for that. We’ll only be lowering ourselves if we compete with a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint.”

“Senior Brother Li Chen is right.” Lin Yijia laughed in amusement.

Soon, the other group of holy princes from the Holy Heavens headed over to the market. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As the Holy Heavens’ branch wasn’t located too far away, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived in less than half an hour.

Since none of them had anything in mind, they shopped about.

Many experts had watched the battles in the Mirage Pavilion, and all of them recognized Huang Xiaolong. As soon as they saw him, they rushed over to greet him. There were even some who tried to make deals with him.

The original bet between Huang Xiaolong and Li Chen had already spread through the lands. The loser would kneel for a day, and if Huang Xiaolong didn’t qualify, he would kneel at the city gates of the Holy Heavens City for a day. In the past, everyone had waited for the day that he would embarrass himself, but their mockery had stopped after he had completed the challenge in the Mirage Pavilion.

Huang Xiaolong repeatedly nodded as he returned the greetings of everyone along the street.

“The Knowledge Singularity Chamber of Commerce managed to obtain a piece of Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone from the Furtive Lands in the Ghost Devil City several days ago,” Someone revealed the information to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, are you headed there now?”

“Oh? That’s interesting.” Huang Xiaolong’s interest was piqued.

The Furtive Lands was one of the forbidden regions of the Ghost Devil City. It was said that even True Saint Realm experts couldn’t leave the region easily. No one knew where they went after they entered.

“That’s right! The Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone is said to be several tens of billions of years old.” Ye Wufeng laughed. “It’s said that the stone has already birthed its consciousness. It’s an extremely potent ingredient if refined into a pill.”

“Let’s go and take a look.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Since there wasn’t anything he was looking for, the Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone was pretty interesting.

Under Ye Wufeng’s lead, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the Knowledge Singularity Chamber of Commerce soon after.

When he arrived, Huang Xiaolong was shocked to notice the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace walking towards him. There were tons of ‘followers’ behind them, and there were even some people he knew. Zhang Yihui of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate was one of them, and he seemed to be speaking to them about something from time to time.

“Thirteen!” Lin Xiaoying jumped in joy when she noticed Huang Xiaolong. With quick steps, she ran towards him.

Huang Xiaolong could only stop as he turned to look at her. A smile formed on his face. “Senior Sister Lin…”

After looking at the other two beauties behind her, he greeted them both.

They nodded with a friendly smile on their faces and returned the greeting.

Since the Devil Palace and the Clear Snow Palace were situated closer to the Ghost Devil City, they had arrived the day before.

“Thirteen, are you here for the Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone too?” Lin Xiaoying ran up to Huang Xiaolong and felt a sense of joy in her heart.

Ever since she had entered the city, she had been waiting for this moment.

“Yup!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly.

When Zhang Yuhui saw the scene playing out in front of him, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of inferiority. However, that soon turned to rage when he realized that the ladies, who weren’t paying attention to him a moment ago, were greeting Huang Xiaolong happily. “Junior Brother Huang, it has already been ten years since the battle in the Mirage Pavilion. It’s an honor to meet you again. However, are you sure you would like to take part in the Trial of Blood with your cultivation level?”

The various disciples behind him roared with laughter.

A sneer rang through the air all of a sudden, “That’s not all. He even wants to enter the top hundred!”

Xie Bufan, Dou Rui, and several members of the Devil Palace appeared in the distance. Beside Xie Bufan and Dou Rui, stood a middle-aged man wearing blood-red robes.

Xiao Lengxue!

He was one of the princes of the Devil Palace, and he was second only to Xie Bufan.

This time, four out of the six princes from the Devil Palace had signed up for the Trial of Blood. The last prince was Su Biqing.

As they slowly approached the chamber of commerce, Dou Rui noticed the commotion, and he was the first to mock Huang Xiaolong.

Previously, Li Chen had allowed Fu Yunjie to spread the news of Huang Xiaolong’s claim to enter the top hundred and many powers had already received the news.

When everyone felt that Huang Xiaolong would refute Dou Rui’s claim, a simple sentence stunned all of them into silence. “Isn’t it just the top hundred? That’s too easy. In the Trial of Blood, I, Huang Xiaolong, will obtain a position in the top ten.”
