Chapter 2788: Subduing the Chariot

Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Seeing as his Huang Long Bloodline was effective in controlling the Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilins, Huang Xiaolong rejoiced in his heart. Since his bloodline was useful in taming them, the next step would be even easier.

Requesting for the beasts to lower their soul defenses, he waved his arm, and two strands of purple grandmist aura entered the space between their eyebrows. A seal was formed on their dao souls just like that.

He instantly felt the connection between the two qilins, and he didn’t waste any time as he flicked his finger to send a drop of golden blood towards the chariot behind them. As soon as the blood landed on the eye of the formation, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

What he experienced was basically a pot of gold dropping from the skies. Since his increase in strength, the Cangqiong Dao Palace was getting a little too slow for his liking. He hadn’t thought that he would chance upon a new mode of transport in the Immemorial Immortal Cave! Regardless of the defensive or offensive capabilities, the Qilin Chariot was several times better than the Cangqiong Dao Palace. The speed was also a major upgrade.

After jumping into the chariot, Huang Xiaolong discovered that the seats were extremely comfortable. It was slightly warm when he sat down, and streams of grand dao energy poured out from a formation on the chariot into his body. It continuously refined his physical body and his twelve Saint Fates.

With his three dao souls, twelve Saint Fates, his dao heart, and the small world in his body, he sucked up the immemorial grand dao energy greedily.

If he could summarise his experience in the chariot with a single word, it would have to be ‘comfortable’! Sitting in the chariot was great!

The sense of comfort was something that enveloped his entire body, and he felt extremely relaxed.

Since he had only started the initial refinement of the Qilin Chariot, he was only able to enjoy the superficial benefits provided by the structure. After managing to refine the chariot for real in the future, he would be able to open the space within the grand formation. Entering this space to cultivate would be several times better than sitting on it.

Even though it seemed like a long time had passed since Huang Xiaolong had subdued the qilins, it took less than a breath of time. The look of disbelief hadn’t even started to fade from the faces of the six Primal Ancestors.

The expressions on their faces turned extremely ugly when they realized that he had already refined the chariot.

The feeling of jealousy in their hearts reached the limit in an instant.

After all, that was a pair of Immemorial Fire and Ice Qilin! They were comparable to First Esteem Dao Venerables, and the six of them could also see that the chariot was no ordinary treasure!

If they managed to subdue the qilins, they would be able to possess a guard with the power of a Dao Venerable! Moreover, the chariot would make their travels much more convenient than before!

As such, they stopped Huang Xiaolong from leaving.

After looking at each other, one of them finally made the decision to walk up to Huang Xiaolong. “I am Yang Jia, the grand hall master of Twin Ape Sacred Land. May I know how I should address you?”

Twin Ape Sacred Land was one of the top-ten ranked superpowers in Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. In fact, it was ranked third among them all, and it was stronger than Golden Snake Sacred Land and Ice Lion Sacred Land by several times.

Of course, Yang Jia was a late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and his name resounded far and wide through the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, staring at the six individuals blocking his way. How could he be unaware of their thoughts?

He didn’t plan to hide anything, and he said placidly, “You can call me Huang Xiaolong. I’m from Cangqiong Sacred Land.”

“What?! Huang Xiaolong?!”

The six of them revealed a surprised expression.

Huang Xiaolong might be a True Saint, but the battle between him and the experts of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land had already spread through Saint Devil Heavenly Paradise. Everyone knew of his feats.

In the past few years, Huang Xiaolong haddn’t shown his face to the world due to his seclusion. However, everyone was still talking about his great battle with Chen Sen and the others.

Moreover, the more the rumors spread, the more exaggerated the battle became.

“As it turns out, you’re little brother Huang Xiaolong…” Yang Jia chuckled softly. “Your name has caused quite the stir out there.”

As he spoke, he pushed his dao soul to the extreme as he scanned the area around Huang Xiaolong. Even though he didn’t believe that there was a formations master backing Cangqiong Sacred Land, it didn’t pay to be careful.

The others did the same.

“If you have nothing else, I shall take my leave,” Huang Xiaolong spoke as he pretended to take his leave.

“Hold it!” they spoke in unison to stop him from leaving.

“Little Nrother Huang, fate has brought us together. I’ve heard that the Saint Devil Prince is planning to exterminate your Cangqiong Sacred Land after his expedition. I wonder if you know about that…” Yang Jia spoke up all of a sudden.

“So what about it?”

The six of them stared at Huang Xiaolong blankly as they didn’t expect him to respond so casually.

“He has ten thousand Primal Ancestors under him, and they are planning to use the Sacred Devil Grand Formation to attack your sacred land… When that happens, the Cangqiong Alliance will crumble! However, if my Twin Ape Sacred Land pleads for mercy on your behalf, he will definitely take my words into account…” Yang Jia explained.

Instead of replying to the other party, Huang Xiaolong stared at him with an expressionless face.

Yang Jia quickly continued, “Of course, we only wish to obtain the Qilin Chariot in return. Compared to the destruction of your Cangqiong Alliance, isn’t using the chariot to trade for your life a better deal?”

Everyone started speaking up all of a sudden.

“As long as you hand it over, my Eight Desolate Sacred Land will also plead on behalf of your Cangqiong Alliance!”

“My Dark Lightning Sacred Land is also willing to plead on your behalf!”

Every single one of them was a power ranked in the top ten, and even though they were not comparable to Twin Ape Scared Land, they were existences stronger than Ice Lion Sacred Land.

Huang Xiaolong stared at all of them as though he was looking at fools. “Do you really think the Saint Devil Prince can exterminate my Cangqiong Alliance?”

The six of them couldn’t help but stare at him in stunned silence.

“I am well aware of your plans. If you scram now, I’ll allow you to live.” A cold light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Their expressions changed in an instant.

As Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors, they were existences who stood high above the masses. Moreover, they were the grand hall masters or hall masters of sacred lands ranked in the top ten. Their statuses were lofty, and this was the first time they heard a True Saint asking them to get lost!

Before anyone could move against Huang Xiaolong, Yang Jia stopped them. Glaring at Huang Xiaolong, he snorted, “Fine. We shall take our leave.” As soon as he spoke, he signaled the others with his eyes before tearing through the skies.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop them from leaving, and he sneered coldly in response. He knew that the six of them would start to spread the news of his gains in order to attract the Saint Devil Prince over. What they didn’t know was that that was Huang Xiaolong’s plan all along. They were doing him a massive favor!

Huang Xiaolong left, riding on the chariot.

With the Immemorial Qilins pulling the chariot, two streaks of light formed in the skies and they didn’t dissipate even after a long time.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong had really left, the six of them returned as killing intent filled their hearts.

“Brother Yang Jia, why did you stop me?!” someone growled in rage.

“Do you think you can defeat the two qilins he subdued?!”

Silence filled the surroundings instantly.

“Are we going to let him leave?! This is bullsh*t!” someone yelled when he saw the tiny dot in the distance.

“We might not be able to deal with him, but the Sacred Devil Prince can. The thousands of Primal Ancestors in the Immemorial Immortal Cave will definitely be able to do something to him!” Yang Jia sneered. “If we can’t obtain the chariot, neither can Huang Xiaolong!”

“I’ll make him regret his decision!”
