Chapter 2124: Heavenly Master’s Appointment for Battle

Despite seeing all the origin treasures before him, Huang Xiaolong was unable to enjoy any of them for now!

Staring at more than fifty origin treasures before him that had yet to mature, Huang Xiaolong’s desire to gather all the nine great lightning pools increased.

Adding these more than fifty origin treasures from the All-Heavens Treasury to the ones from the Nine Yin Treasury, Huang Xiaolong now had more than eighty stalks of origin treasures that weren’t mature. If he managed to gather all nine great lightning pools to form the Grandmist Lightning Pool, he would be able to hasten their growth. He would possess an astounding amount of resources as soon as they matured!

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong and the others managed to locate Jiang Hong’s godhead among all the treasures. He only relaxed when he retrieved his senior brother’s godhead.

Other than the origin treasures, everyone saw countless amounts of priceless divine pills located inside the treasury.

All of these pills were a level higher than that of top-grade grandmist spiritual pills. They were comparable to level one origin treasures, but to Huang Xiaolong, none of them could be of use. He quickly distributed all the pills to his master, the little cow, and the others.

The King of Grandmist and the rest received the pills and felt a wave of appreciation in their hearts. They failed to regain their calm even after a long time.

After emptying out the treasury, Huang Xiaolong and the others didn’t waste any more time. They left the heavenly country.

Before they could leave, Huang Xiaolong’s transmission symbol trembled. When he took it out and scanned his divine sense over it, a frown formed on his face.

“What’s wrong?” The little cow asked.

“It’s an announcement from the Heavenly World...” Huang Xiaolong passed the transmission symbol over to the others after speaking.

There were messages sent by both the Netherworld King’s Organization and the Radiance Knight Corp. Despite the multitude of messages, the contents were the same. According to an announcement from the Heavenly World, Wan Xiaorong and Tian Chen would be marrying three years later.

All the experts were welcomed to make their way over to the Heavenly World in order to take part in the festivities.

At the same time, the Heavenly Master had challenged Huang Xiaolong. It was set for the day after the ceremony!

There was also something about Tian Chen breaking into the high-level Sovereign Realm, and he was going to celebrate his breakthrough at the same time!

Since the news had already spread across the lands, almost everyone learned about the wedding ceremony and the Heavenly Master’s challenge.

When the King of Darkness saw the news about Wan Xiaorong and Tian Chen’s marriage, his expression turned ugly.

Wan Xiaorong!

She was the goddess he couldn’t forget no matter how hard he tried!

“Tian Chen!” The little cow piped up all of a sudden. “He’s the younger brother of the Heavenly Master... I never expected him to enter the high-level Sovereign so quickly...”

The King of Grandmist continued, “Tian Chen hid himself from the world, and there is an air of mystery surrounding him. Moreover, there have been rumors going around that he had accepted the Ancient Heavenly Emperor as his disciple.”

Cang Mutian sucked in a cold breath. “If he really is the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s master, how could he have remained on the sideline when Wan Shi moved against the old man in the past?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The King of Grandmist quickly explained the situation, “The Ancient Heavenly Emperor had thoughts of escaping from the control of the Heavenly World. That should be the reason why the Heavenly World decided to get rid of him...”

“Wan Shi killed the Ancient Heavenly Emperor because of orders from the Heavenly World?!” The little cow widened her eyes in shock.

The King of Grandmist nodded his head. “There is such a possibility...”

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on the King of Darkness, and he stated with absolute certainty, “We shall head over to the Heavenly World in three years.”

The King of Darkness felt his heart shake, and a complicated emotion clouded his heart. “If it isn’t meant to be, it isn’t meant to be. If we were to compare me, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, and Shi Zhen with Tian Chen, Tian Chen is much more suited to be with her!”

“Xiaolong, are you really planning on accepting the challenge?!” The King of Grandmist stared at Huang Xiaolong with a worried look flashing in his eyes.

“The Heavenly Master possesses unfathomable strength. Even if you have the lightning bead, you might not be able to win.” The little cow frowned. “Since he dares to challenge you in front of everyone, he should be confident about killing you!”

Cang Mutian couldn’t help but add, “That’s right... Even if you refuse to take him up on his challenge, no one will say a thing about it. The Heavenly Master has already made a name for himself for several tens of billions of years. You have barely cultivated for more than a thousand years! Who would dare to mock you...? The only person to feel embarrassed should be the Heavenly Master. Without considering his seniority, he challenged a little junior in the cultivation world to a battle!”

Lightning flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Relax. I’m confident in taking him on.”

He was not the Heavenly Master’s opponent with his current strength, but things could change in three years!

He knew that Wan Shi’s ‘revenge’ was not the only reason for the Heavenly Master to lower himself and issue his challenge. He had to be interested in the lightning bead Huang Xiaolong had revealed in the battle with Wan Shi.

No one would be able to keep their calm in the face of a saint artifact!

Even if the Heavenly Master wasn’t sure if the lightning bead was a saint artifact, the strength it had demonstrated was enough for him to disregard his reputation as a senior to challenge Huang Xiaolong.

When everyone saw how adamant Huang Xiaolong was, they knew that nothing they said would be able to change his mind. They could only tell him everything they knew about the Heavenly Master in order to prepare Huang Xiaolong for the upcoming battle.

What they didn’t know was that Huang Xiaolong had already dug out what he needed to know about the Heavenly Master from Wan Yue’s and Wan Zhuoyuan’s memory. His understanding of the Heavenly Master was at par with the little cow and the others’ knowledge.

“What should we do now?” The King of Darkness asked all of a sudden.

“There is nothing for us to do.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head, and a brilliant light flashed in his eyes. “The only thing we can do now is to look for a place for me to enter seclusion.”

When Huang Xiaolong had refined the lightning bead in the past, he had barely managed to absorb one-tenth of the energy stored in it. Since the World Leaders Conference had begun, he had no choice but to stop in order to save his master and the King of Darkness.

In the next three years, there was nothing left for Huang Xiaolong to do but to refine the lightning bead with everything he had. The stronger he became, the better it would be.

As for the other lightning pools, it wouldn’t be too late to locate them after the fight with the Heavenly Master.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at a secret region with a massive mountain range standing tall behind them as a vast sea filled the entirety of the space in front of them. With chaos spiritual energy concentrated in the air, it was a pretty good location for Huang Xiaolong to enter seclusion.

After placing down a ton of restrictions around them, Huang Xiaolong and the others opened up independent spaces as they entered seclusion.

Sitting in the Complete Heaven Palace, concentrated beams of starlight fell on Huang Xiaolong’s head as he used a secret method to activate the lightning bead. Streams of lightning energy poured into his body.

Circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, Huang Xiaolong swallowed the endless amounts of lightning energy flowing into his body.
