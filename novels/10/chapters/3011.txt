Chapter 3012: Mysterious Purple Peak

As terrifying lightning qi drifted in the air around the Bright Lightning Abyss, Huang Xiaolong charged forward without a care in the world. When the lightning qi touched his body, Huang Xiaolong felt a pleasant breeze washing over him.

Similarly, the lightning qi failed to do a thing to the Tortoise Ancestor.

This time, his goal wasn’t just to locate the genesis lightning liquid. He was also there to look for Chen Xi, and Huang Xiaolong allowed the Tortoise Ancestor to travel slowly through the skies.

Of course, the speed was relative to Huang Xiaolong and the Tortoise Ancestor. They were still tearing through the skies at a terrifying pace.

Ordinary high-level Dao Venerables would only be able to see a streak of black light brushing across the skies if they noticed the Tortoise Ancestor.

“Your Highness, Chen Xi might already be dead after being trapped here for so many years! The Bright Lightning Abyss is boundless, and looking for someone is like looking for a needle in a haystack! Even if we search for a hundred years, we won’t be able to find him!” Liang Xiao sighed.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong was more than aware of the concerns. However, he had to look for Chen Xi with all his might! He promised Long Jianfei that he would locate his teacher, and he was going to keep his promise!

Using all three dao souls, Huang Xiaolong tried to look for Chen Xi.

With his current abilities, the area he could cover was terrifyingly large. Even the restrictions located in the Bright Lightning Abyss couldn’t stop him. He could see everything in the hundred million miles radius around him.

Several days passed, and Huang Xiaolong noticed a ton of lightning attributed spiritual herbs. There were a lot of them at the dao level herb, but he was too lazy to pick them up.

The only herbs he would go out of his way to retrieve were genesis-level herbs.

When the Tortoise Ancestor noticed the goodies they were passing up, he felt an ache in his heart. However, he couldn’t say a word since Huang Xiaolong wasn’t planning to go after the treasures.

His reaction naturally fell into Huang Xiaolong’s considerations. A chuckle left his lips as he spoke to the Tortoise Ancestor, “If you want them, go pick them yourself. However, you can’t take more than ten breaths of time.”

Liang Xiao’s face lit up when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Many thanks to Your Highness!”

The dao herbs might be protected by several layers of restrictions, but Liang Xiao was the Tortoise Ancestor! He was an existence whose strength stood firmly at the top layers of the Divine Tuo Holy World, and he shattered the restrictions in a single breath of time! It took him less than ten breaths of time to retrieve several herbs.

Along the way, he collected dao herbs to his heart’s content. Of course, he was smart enough to remember what Huang Xiaolong said. He took less than ten breaths of time.

Sitting on Liang Xiao’s tortoise shell, Huang Xiaolong used his dao souls to search for Chen Xi while trying to comprehend the power of absolute lightning.

A month passed in the blink of an eye, and lightning bolts flashed unsteadily around Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The deeper they went, the stronger the lightning qi became. The power of destruction contained in them increased, and the lightning bolts grew a little stronger.

During their exploration, Huang Xiaolong and Liang Xiao ran into countless lightning beasts born from the lightning qi. There were even several beasts at the mid-level Dao Venerable Realm. Other than lightning beasts, they ran into several experts from the dao convergences of the Divine Tuo Holy World. The only weird thing was that they didn’t discover any traces of the demons from the Outer World!

Huang Xiaolong turned a little suspicious.

There was no way Zeng Lei lied about their arrival, but he couldn’t explain the fact that he saw no demons after stepping into the Bright Lightning Abyss. Could they have headed straight for the deepest region of the Bright Lightning Abyss the moment they arrived?

When he was thinking of the different possibilities, a whistling sound tore through the air, and Huang Xiaolong turned to look in the direction of the noise.

“Your Highness...” Liang Xiao muttered.

Ordering the Tortoise Ancestor to stop in mid air, they noticed more than thirty experts flying towards them.

A massive group of demons from the Outer World flew towards them, and the weakest among them were mid-level Dao Venerables.

The only problem was that there were experts of the Misty Rain Dao Venerable among the demons. Huang Xiaolong recognized two of them instantly, and they were Yu Yue and Tan Meiqin.

In the past, Yu Yue tried to pay him a visit in the Boundary Emperor Creed. However, he didn’t manage to meet them.

When Yu Yue and Tan Meiqin saw Huang Xiaolong, a look of excitement appeared on their desperate faces.

“Xiaolong!” Yu Yue exclaimed in a fit of joy.

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. When no one else was around, Feng Yue and Yin Yue would address him by his name, but he wasn’t close enough for Yu Yue to do the same.

The group of demons were clearly not expecting to run into another human after capturing the bunch from the Misty Rain Creed.

“So you guys know each other…” A demon with a white horn sneered when he heard how Yu Yue called out to Huang Xiaolong. Those around him moved after the words left his lips, and they reached out to grab Huang Xiaolong and the Tortoise Ancestor.

A massive palm descended from the skies towards the duo, but Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to move.

As a burst of light emerged from Liang Xiao’s tortoise shell, the palm in the air was shattered and the expert who tried to make his move was sent shooting through the skies. He spat out black colored blood uncontrollably.

Since the bodies of the demons were made out of darkness, their blood couldn’t be any other color.

“What?!” The group of demons screamed in shock. The person who was sent flying was an Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable!

When they were still stuck in a state of shock, an expert whose eyes glowed a sinister green stepped forward. He spoke to the expert with a white horn on his head. “Young Master, that tortoise is a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“What?!” The demon who was addressed as the young master yelled in shock. He stared at Liang Xiao with a look of disbelief before turning to Huang Xiaolong. “Who the hell are you?!”

Without responding, Huang Xiaolong casually stretched out his right hand to grab at the demons.

“You’re asking to die!” The expert whose eyes were flickering green sneered. He nearly burst into laughter when he realized that Huang Xiaolong was a mere Eighth Esteem Dao Venerable. How dare a weakling at that level disrespect him?! One had to know that he was a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable!

His train of thought was stopped short when he realized that he couldn’t move his body at all. His connection with the small world in his body was severed, and he couldn’t use the slightest bit of cosmos energy!

Suppressing more than thirty Dao Venerables, Huang Xiaolong shattered the restrictions around the bodies of those from the Misty Rain Dao Convergence.

Yu Yue and the others rejoiced, and they quickly said their thanks to Huang Xiaolong. “Many thanks to Your Highness!”

“There’s no need to thank me. I didn’t do it to save you specifically. You can leave now.”

It was true. The only reason he saved them was because he wanted to retrieve some information from those of the Demon Race. He wanted to understand their reason for coming to the Bright Lightning Abyss.

As her expression dimmed, Yu Yue could only lead the others away.

When their figures disappeared in the horizon, Huang Xiaolong started to search through the souls of the demons.

“Mysterious Purple Peak?”

Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself after looking through the other party’s memories. The demons from the Outer World entered the Bright Lightning Abyss because a mysterious purple mountain appeared in the depths of the Bright Lightning Abyss… It seemed as though there was a secret hiding behind the existence of the purple mountain and Huang Xiaolong was determined to get to the bottom of it.
