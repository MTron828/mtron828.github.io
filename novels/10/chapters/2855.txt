Chapter 2856: Encountering Fools Is Inevitable

As the sixth-ranked creed in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave, it wasn’t enough to describe the prosperity of its trading market as bustling, and various noises came from all directions.

Numerous visitors came from various sacred lands, and these sacred lands’ disciples and also creeds’ disciples crowded the streets. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

When Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng arrived at the trading market, they did not enter any of the small shops, instead, they went straight to the several biggest shops in the trading market that sold grand dao pills and grand dao herbs.

However, Huang Xiaolong was served with a wave of disappointment. After going through these several shops, he did not find any grand dao pills, except for a few grand dao herbs, and the low-grade ones. Then again, it was better than nothing, thus Huang Xiaolong also purchased these low-grade grand dao herbs.

Although these grand dao herbs’ efficacies couldn’t compare to grand dao pills, they were still effective to some extent.

When they were passing by the jade area of the trading market, Duan Feng was attracted to it and said to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, are you interested to go and play a round of stone guessing?”

“Stone guessing?” Huang Xiaolong repeated in confusion.

“Yes, it’s stone guessing,” Duan Feng went on to explain, “Inside many raw jadestones, there might be one or two innate embryo jadestones that are even better than grand dao pills.”

Long Jianfei joined in, “That’s right! I’ve heard that this stone guessing mainly relies on one’s bloodline, and the higher your bloodline is, the more accurately you can sense the innate embryo inside the raw jadestones!”

Both their meanings were already clearly portrayed. With Huang Xiaolong’s Creation Huang Long Bloodline, his guess would be absolutely accurate.

“The higher your bloodline power is, the more accurately you can sense the innate embryo inside, is that so?” Huang Xiaolong asked, “In that case, can the disciples with highly ranked bloodlines run here every day and strike a jackpot daily?”

Duan Feng shook his head. “Although it is said that the higher the bloodline is, the more accurately one can sense the innate embryo inside, it is not guaranteed a hundred percent. It is merely that the judgment is more accurate. Even someone like the Saint Devil Prince with a supreme bloodline would have ten percent or so accuracy.”

“Genius disciples like one dragon, two tigers, and three moons would probably have twenty percent accuracy,” Duan Feng explained.

Huang Xiaolong showed an expression of understanding.

“On the other hand, it’s hard to say how accurate Your Highness’ bloodline will be.” Long Jianfei voiced his opinion, “I believe, it will be at least thirty percent and above.”

Thirty percent! This was already a very high accuracy probability.

Then again, Long Jianfei did not dare to say for certain how much higher the accuracy probability would be. Thus he could only give a rough estimation.

“Let’s go take a look,” Huang Xiaolong said as his interest was stirred. He was very much interested to see how powerful his Huang Long Bloodline was in determining the innate embryo inside these raw jadestones.

If he really could get a few grand dao level innate embryos, that won’t be a bad harvest.

In the jade trading area, the entire street was lined with shops offering all sizes and kinds of jades, from stone guessing to selling and buying jades. This street was livelier than the street selling grand dao pills and grand dao herbs. This was the part where various sacred lands’ experts were gathered. Occasional sighs sounded amongst the loud cheers, most likely due to failure from stone guessing.

Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng stopped at one of the biggest stone guessing shops.

When the owner understood that Huang Xiaolong wanted to play stone guessing, the owner explained some of the rules to Huang Xiaolong before leading him to the stone guessing field.

The stone guessing field was crowded with disciples guessing the potential of the many stones, and all around were raw jadestones of various sizes and shapes. Some were casually placed on the ground, some were placed on shelves, and there were also jadestones that were floating in high air. There were jadestones all around.

Surrounded by the colorful selection of jadestones was a novel experience for Huang Xiaolong. He had never thought that there would be so many varieties of jadestones, and the prism of colors they came in.

Huang Xiaolong secretly evoked his Huang Long Bloodline as he strolled through the stone guessing field, trying to get a sense of the jadestones around him.

Originally, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t certain if he could really sense something special from these jadestones, but the result stupefied him!

This is?!

He could clearly sense breathing from many of these jadestones as there was a rhythm resembling heartbeat?!

Did these jadestones that nurtured innate embryos actually have a feeling of blood connection with his Huang Long Bloodline?

Yes, a kind of blood connection.

Could it be?! Ecstasy filled Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Jade stones with breathing and pulses that resembled heartbeats were definitely jadestones with innate embryos!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong discovered that some of these rhythms followed certain patterns, as if these sounds contained grand dao laws, and they were extremely pleasant to the ears. There were also other rhythms that are chaotic and messy, or like surging waves. On the other hand, quite a few sounds were weak and feeble.

Huang Xiaolong immediately understood the meaning behind these different rhythmic patterns. The more vigorous and pleasant these sounds were, the higher the grade dao laws of these innate embryos were.

Thinking of this, Huang Xiaolong quickened his steps towards casually piled-up jadestones.

He did this because there were several stones in this pile that had the strongest sounds.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng were dumbfounded for a moment after seeing Huang Xiaolong’s sudden action.

“Your Highness, you…?” Long Jianfei couldn’t help saying, “Stones placed here have a low…” Duan Feng agreed with Long Jianfei, “He’s right, Your Highness. If you want to choose, it’s better to select those.” He pointed at the stones hanging high in the air.

Before an owner sold their goods, each item would be inspected by an expert one by one before being displayed for sale according to the probability of an innate embryo inside the jadestonnes. The stones simply piled up on one side were jadestones determined to be without innate embryos.

“There is no need.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head.

After arriving in front of the pile of jadestones, Huang Xiaolong personally selected six stones out of them, and then, he went to another pile of stones and selected four stones. From the third pile of stones, Huang Xiaolong picked out five. It went on until Huang Xiaolong collected thirty to forty stones.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng were flabbergasted.

Huang Xiaolong’s action had long attracted many disciples and experts’ attention. Not many people chose stones like Huang Xiaolong did, especially several tens of stones at one go.

“Which sacred land has this brat come from? Is it his first time here? I’ve seen many prodigal sons, but never one so wasteful!” a sacred land’s expert commented laughingly.

“Stone guessing right. Encountering fools here is inevitable!” A sonorous voice traveled to everyone’s ears from a distance away. A young man walked over, accompanied by a large entourage from the direction of the voice.

Many experts looked solemn after seeing this young man.

“It’s the Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple Wang Xin! It’s said this Wang Xin is from the Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall, and he came with the Enforcement Hall Master to our Blue Lotus Creed!”

“That’s right! He’s also Hall Master Zhu Hui’s named disciple!”

Many experts approached Wang Xin with fawning expressions.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent. The Enforcement Hall Master’s named disciple. That means he’s Zhu Hui’s named disciple, is he?
