Chapter 2227: Might be a Supreme Expert

The initially dim lighting bead finally started to emit a faint glow after absorbing the lightning qi in the air. Even though the light surrounding it was extremely faint, Huang Xiaolong could feel that the main formation in the lightning bead was coming back to life.

A trace of joy flashed across his heart as he continued to soar deeper into the lightning grounds.

The deeper he went, the purer and denser the lightning qi in the air became. The lightning bead’s recovery speed increased accordingly.

The higher the number of lightning threads entered the bead, the deeper he went.

At the borders of the lightning grounds, the lightning qi that entered the bead was as thin as a thread of silk. The deeper he went, the thicker it became. When he traveled for an entire day, the thickness of the lightning qi was comparable to a thick rope!

The sky started to darken, but Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to stop for a break. He urged the Six Eyed Ice Lion to continue flying towards the depths of the lightning grounds.

Even though he wasn’t sure of the Lightning Dragon Divine Fruit’s location, he was pretty certain that it wouldn’t be located anywhere near the borders of the lightning grounds. Without sufficient lightning qi, there was no chance of the fruits maturing at all.

As Huang Xiaolong made his way towards the depths of the lighting grounds, cries of help entered his ears.

“This voice...” The figure of a certain person flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he heard the voice.

“Zhang Wenyue!”

Jumping off the Six Eyed Ice Lion, Huang Xiaolong tore through the dense lightning qi in the air to charge towards the source of the voice.

Before long, he saw several figures rushing towards him. They cut a sorry sight, and it was precisely Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and their father, Prince Qian. There was a group of experts chasing behind them with sinister expressions on their faces.

Among the bunch of experts, there were members of the Jinyuan Kingdom, Lightning Soaring Kingdom, and even people from the Beast Emperor Sect!

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock.

Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that there would be so many experts after Zhang Wenyue and the others!

Since the chase had started, various experts from the Prince Qian Manor were already killed, and only the three of them had remained.

Upon seeing that they were about to land into the hands of their pursuers, a look of despair filled their faces.

“Yue’er, Chen’er, I was wrong! I caused this to happen...” The Prince Qian’s grievous voice rang through the air.

Zhang Wanyue shook her head, but she didn’t utter a word. Sadness flashed through her eyes.

All of a sudden, the somber look in her eyes changed as it was replaced by an incredulous expression. She opened her eyes wide as she stared into the distance.

Prince Qian and her brother couldn’t help but look in the same direction.

“Young Master Huang!” Zhang Wanyue exclaimed in shock when she noticed his presence.

A complicated look appeared on the faces of the father and son duo when they realized that it was Huang Xiaolong.

“Young Master Huang, hurry up and leave!” Zhang Wenyue screamed as she was afraid he wouldn’t be able to hear her warning! “Young Master Huang, you have to leave now!”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. He swept his gaze across everyone who was chasing them and he realized that she was afraid he would be dragged down along with them.

When he realized that she was concerned for him, a smile couldn’t help but form on his face. Out of the several odd hundred people chasing them down, the strongest was only at the Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

If this was before he left the Prince Qian Manor, he might not have been able to challenge a Tenth Order Emperor. However, things had changed since then. After recovering a part of his strength, he was no longer the injured man he once was.

Zhang Wenyue couldn’t help but feel a trace of anxiousness rising in her heart when she saw that Huang Xiaolong was staring at them without any intentions of running away. “Young Master Huang, leave now! If they catch up with you, it’s all over!”

Huang Xiaolong shook her head as he stared at her.

By this time, the experts who were on the hunt had already surrounded all of them. Huang Xiaolong was trapped alongside the three others, and his only route of escape was sealed.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had voluntarily walked into a trap, Zhang Wenyue didn’t know if she should rage at him.

“Why did you...?” Zhang Wenyue quickly rushed towards Huang Xiaolong. But before she could complete her sentence, she realized that all the scars on his face had disappeared. She couldn’t help but stare at him with a dumbfounded expression. When he had left the Prince Qian Manor, there were still faint scars on his face. However, none of those scars remained presently.

Just a moment ago, she was too far to see the changes that had happened to him. Now that she was right in front of him, she noticed that a lot had changed about him.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s face without any scars, she noticed that he was actually pretty handsome! He even exuded an aura of assertive dominance!

Zhang Haochen and Prince Qian also noticed the transformation on Huang Xiaolong’s face and they couldn’t help but stare at him in shock.

“Hehe! It looks like there’s someone else.” A sinister cackle rang through the air. “Zhang Wenyue, is this your lover? He looks pretty handsome. Too bad he’s about to die!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The person who spoke was a youngster clad in a purple dragon robe. He was one of the young princes of the Prince Long Manor in the Jinyuan Kingdom. Along with Zhang Wenyue, and Qin Shaolong, whom Huang Xiaolong had killed previously, they made up the three geniuses of the Jinyuan Kingdom!

Of course, he was a mortal enemy of the Prince Qian Manor.

“There is need to waste your breath. Hand over the Treasure Tome and I’ll allow you to die a quick death!” One of the experts from the Beast Emperor Sect chimed in from the side.

The person who had just spoken was at the mid-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, and he was the strongest expert present in the group of pursuers. With his strength, he was also part of the upper echelons in the Beast Emperor Sect.

The expressions of Zhang Wenyue, Zhang Haochen, and Prince Qian sank.

Ever since the initial selections of the Big Dipper Sword Sect, the three of them had left for the lightning grounds.

They had managed to locate a deserted mountain cave with a Treasure Tome. It had inscription of the techniques of a Venerable. They had never thought that one of their bodyguards would be a spy for the Prince Long Manor and the news of their sudden windfall had quickly started to spread. Before they knew it, they were surrounded by a ton of experts!

The legacy of a Venerable was something even the Beast Emperor Sect couldn’t give up, much less a random kingdom in the Falling Jade Dynasty.

Zhang Wenyue unintentionally shuffled closer to Huang Xiaolong when she realized her impending fate. She didn’t know why, but she felt safer when she was standing by his side.

When Huang Xiaolong felt her trembling body, a desire to protect her spouted in his heart. “Relax. Nothing bad will happen to you with me around.”

The moment the words left his lips, everyone stared at him in shock. However, they soon burst into laughter.

“Did you hear that? This brat said that with him around, nothing untoward will befall her!” Dong Zening roared with laughter. “We better look out! He might be a supreme expert! Hahaha!”

If it wasn’t obvious enough, his sarcastic laughter rang through the air and entered the ears of everyone present.

The mid-Tenth Order Emperor from the Beast Emperor Sect decided to play along, and he continued, “Hahaha! He might even be a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor! He’s going to crush us all! Hahaha!”

Not a single person managed to control their laughter and mockery ran through the crowd.

It was clear that they didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong could be an expert at the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Even as a genius of the Jinyuan Kingdom, Zhang Wenyue was merely a peak late-Tenth Order God King! How could a God King have an Emperor as a lover?

Even if they gave him all the benefit of doubt in the world, he would at the very most be in the Heavenly Monarch Realm!
