Several days later, after an intense bitter battle with help from the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, Huang Xiaolong finally succeeded in breaking that Hundred Spirits Beast King’s body by destroying the remnant will contained in its head.

The moment Huang Xiaolong relaxed after destroying the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s remnant will, a strong fatigue washed over him, panting heavily out of breath.

This was the hardest battle he fought ever since he was reborn into this world.

If it weren’t for the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s help, regardless of Huang Xiaolong’s own strength and his True Dragon Physique or even his true immortal essence fire, he would have most likely ended up being devoured by the enemy.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi still felt apprehensive despite the battle having ended, never had he imagined that a mere body condensed out of demonic qi by the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s remnant will would be so horrendously powerful. One could imagine how terrifying the Hundred Spirits Beast King actually was in the past.

No wonder the first Black Warrior Institute Principal and those great masters couldn’t truly kill it.

Huang Xiaolong dragged his heavy body into a meditative position, swallowed a Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellet and employed his martial spirits’ Instant Recovery ability to replenish his true immortal essence and god battle qi.

One hour later, Huang Xiaolong was back in peak form.

Standing up, Huang Xiaolong leaped onto the grand altar.

After the bitter battle, it was now time to reap the harvest—refining the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s giant arms.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong dared not proceed carelessly. He carefully studied the mysterious sealing symbols on the altar

Since these symbols were able to suppress the Hundred Spirits Beast King, then they were also a treasure hard to come by.

Studying the sealing symbols greatly benefited Huang Xiaolong. To his embarrassment, Huang Xiaolong spent four months to understand the profound symbols despite his strong comprehension ability and his Etheric Physique.

After he was done studying the sealing symbols, Huang Xiaolong approached the center of the altar, stepping closer to the Hundred Spirits Beast king’s giant arms.

Just as Huang Xiaolong took a step toward the center, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s arms suddenly twitched, the sealing symbols around them glimmered brightly. The giant arms were trying to forcefully break free from the seal.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong’s hands moved and the seal shone even brighter, completely suppressing the arms, so that they couldn’t even move an inch.

Following that, a light flashed from Huang Xiaolong’s hands, revealing two fiery longswords. With a wave, the two longswords pierced through the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s arms.

Consecutive muffled bangs rang as grey demonic qi surged out from the arms in retaliation.

But this grey demonic qi was quickly burned into nothing by the Black Tortoise Divine Fire.

The sealing symbols once again shook as Huang Xiaolong manipulated the formation to tighten the suppression on the demonic beast arms.

This repeated for an entire month before the strength of the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s arms gradually reduced and weakened.

Huang Xiaolong was happy watching this, just a little bit more time and he’d be able to expel all the demonic qi. As Huang Xiaolong expected, ten days later, there was no more resistance from the giant arms, lying quietly at the center of the sealing symbols.

‘At last!’ Huang Xiaolong breathed in relief.

Finally, it was time to harvest the fruit of his hard work from these months.

Standing in the air right above the giant arms, Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath and sat in a cross-legged position. Then he began running the Asura Tactics, refining and absorbing the energy from the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s arms.

From the upper side of the two giant arms, gaseous strands that shimmered like red agate flew out, entering Huang Xiaolong’s body, refined and absorbed.

This was the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence.

There was a shocking degree of energy contained in its blood essence, moreover, this energy was extremely violent in nature.

Inside Huang Xiaolong’s body, the Treasure Dragon diagram was devouring this energy at an increasingly frantic speed, yet it still wasn’t fast enough. Some of this violent blood essence energy escaped out from his body, forming into blood-colored demonic beast figures. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

From afar, Huang Xiaolong appeared to be a majestic Beast King that sat crossed-legged in the middle of a sea of demonic beasts.

As his physique was continuously tempered by the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence, Huang Xiaolong could clearly feel the changes happening to his body.

His internal organs that shimmered like a galaxy were strengthened once more, becoming studier, with a sheen surface.

At the same time, the Black Tortoise Divine Fire in the shape of a tortoise inside Huang Xiaolong opened its mouth, absorbing all the blood essence that floated out of Huang Xiaolong’s body.

After a while, the Black Tortoise Divine Fire appeared to have grown bigger. Although it wasn’t obvious, Huang Xiaolong sensed the changes happening to the Black Tortoise Divine Fire.

Day after day passed, year after year.

Five years had gone by, spent in refining and absorbing the blood essence inside those giant arms. At the end of the five years, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence gradually grew paler in color.

Huang Xiaolong, who was an early Tenth Order God Realm cultivator, advanced into mid-Tenth Order God Realm.

Another year later, the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s blood essence was fully refined and the two giant arms on the altar turned into gray ash, disappeared from the altar.

Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes, a dignified aura shone from within.

The whole gray space shook, wind cyclones blew out with Huang Xiaolong as the center, swallowing everything in their path.

Only when Huang Xiaolong stood up did the wind cyclones stop.

“Mid-Tenth Order God Realm.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

After this breakthrough to mid-Tenth Order, Huang Xiaolong was different from how he used to be, happy with every breakthrough. He didn’t feel anything in the slightest, neither joy nor sadness.

He made a grasping motion in the air, and in the space above, spiritual energy rushed toward his hand, condensing into a piece of mid-divine grade spirit stone.

A divine grade spirit stone in certain first rank forces was something placed in the deeper section of the treasury. Unless it was absolutely necessary, that spirit stone would not be taken out.

However, Huang Xiaolong was able to condense the same grade of spirit stones from the air.

“Mid-divine grade!” A small ripple flickered past his eyes. “According to this, once I break through to the Highgod Realm, I’d be able to condense sacred grade immortal spirit stones.”

Sacred grade immortal spirit stones, that was something even super forces and Highgod Realm masters went crazy over.

“It’s been over six years, I wonder how the situation is outside.” Thinking of this, Huang Xiaolong’s figure vanished from the spot. In a short time, he returned to the ground surface.

Even so, he did not head to the Alliance headquarters. Standing there, his divine sense spread out, searching for the demonic beast clans.

Of course, he had not forgotten his other purpose in coming to the Golden Mountain World—kill ten Seventh Order God Realm demonic beasts for his Elder promotion.

If those demonic beast clans’ masters hadn’t left the Golden Mountain World, Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense would be able to locate them easily.

After some searching, he soon found a group of demonic beast clans’ masters inside a small cave in a poison valley.

There were more than thirty of them, and as luck would have it, the majority were of Seventh Order God Realm cultivation.

A smile spread over Huang Xiaolong’s face. Without a warning, he ‘served’ each of these demonic beast clans’ masters a fist, obliterating the entire group. He then collected more than twenty corpses of Seventh Order God Realms into his spatial ring and left the Golden Mountain World for the Vermilion Bird Institute.

He had already found the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s body part, and on top of that, he killed more than a dozen Seventh Order God Realm demonic beast clans’ masters, therefore there was no need for him to stay in the Golden Mountain World any longer.

Coming up, Huang Xiaolong would continue searching for information related to the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire in the underground floors of the library.

As for the other sealed body parts of the Hundred Spirits Beast King, he decided to look for them after integrating with the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire.

This way was much safer.

Just the demonic qi from the Hundred Spirits Beast King’ arms was already that scary, what if he found the torso next? With Huang Xiaolong ‘s current strength, he wasn’t strong enough yet.
