Chapter 2573: The Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s Inheritance

“Who dares to hurt my Huang’er!” Jiang Heng bellowed. His voice thundered through the dao palace, shaking the whole Suoluo Domain. At this moment, all experts in the Suoluo Domain felt the terrifying might of a Primal Ancestor.

This sudden wave of overwhelming pressure frightened them.

“That’s Lord Jiang Heng’s voice! What happened?! Did something happen to the Suoluo Race’s young patriarch?!”

“I heard the Suoluo Race’s Young Patriarch went to the ancient battlefield. Could something really have happened?”

A holy ground’s patriarch quickly guessed the reason despite his apprehension.

In the Suoluo Domain, Jiang Heng was the supreme existence. At the same time, he was also the Suoluo Domain’s Domain Master. Once Jiang Heng was furious, the entire Suoluo Domain trembled.

Following Jiang Henng’s furious bellow, his figure rushed out from the dao palace into the sky, and disappeared above the Central Headquarters in the blink of an eye. He traversed across various holy grounds and space as he hurried to the ancient battlefield.

Although Jiang Heng was in too much of a hurry to inform any of the Suoluo Race’s experts, every one had heard his furious bellow. How could they be unaware that something had happened?

Shortly, the various holy grounds’ experts saw the Suoluo Race’s experts marching out like a great army over one holy ground after another, traversing across domains, speeding straight towards the ancient battlefield.

Leading a mighty great army that resembled a mountain was none other than the Suoluo Race’s current patriarch, Jiang Yuan, who was a peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint. He was very likely to step into Primal Ancestor Realm within several hundred thousand years.

At this time on the ancient battlefield, Huang Xiaolong was still unaware that Jiang Heng and a Suoluo Race army were desperately rushing towards the ancient battlefield.

Several hours passed…

On a certain bloody peak in the ancient battlefield, Jiang Shaohuang and Jiang Long were lying half-dead on the ground. Other Suoluo Race’s experts’ corpses were strewn around them.

Despite having activated his dao talisman, Jiang Shaohuang’s body was contaminated by Hei Luo’s devil qi and corpse qi. Then, how could he escape out of Hei Luo’s senses? Thus, it didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo to catch up.

Half a day later…

In the end, Jiang Shaohuang, Jiang Long, and the few remaining Suoluo Race experts chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong. Those that stubbornly resisted were all devoured by Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong had Jiang Shaohuang, Jiang Long, and the rest swallow holy healing pills to recover and their injuries were more or less healed a day later. He then sent them away, ordering them to return to the Alien Lands and await his order.

Like he had planned earlier, he was going to visit the Alien Lands after obtaining the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance.

Jiang Shaohuang, Jiang Long, and the rest respected Huang Xiaolong’s order and made their way back to the Alien Lands.

Looking at Jiang Shaohuang’s group leave, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered with ambition. He was going to enter the Alien Lands with the purpose of conquering the various alien races.

Having conquered Jiang Shaohuang, Jiang Long, and those few Suoluo Race’s experts could be considered as setting his foundation for his purpose in the Alien Lands.

With the influence of Jiang Shaohuang’s group, it would be smoother when the time came for him to conquer the Suoluo Race.

The Suoluo Race was a royal family. In the entire Alien Lands, the Suoluo Race was a big clan and one of the superpowers. Once Huang Xiaolong took over the Suoluo Race, he would slowly reach out to other royal families in the Alien Lands.

Once he had these royal families in his pocket, there would be a little difference from ruling the whole Alien Lands.

Jiang Shaohuang had set off with thirty-plus experts this time, however, half of them had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Huang Xiaolong had helped Jiang Shaohuang, Jiang Long, and the others to come up with a reason as to why they had activated the escape talisman, when explaining to Jiang Heng about what had happened…

Only after Jiang Shaohuang’s group disappeared from view did Huang Xiaolong bring Hei Luo back the way they had come, returning to the dense forest.

The trees in the ancient battlefield’s forest resembled white bones, mostly white or gray, unlike the green foliage outside. There was not a single leaf on these bone-trees, and they were completely bare. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

These trees were nicknamed as ghost trees or shadow trees, and one rarely saw these kinds of trees outside the ancient battlefield.

Back at the forest, Huang Xiaolong activated the Black Corpse Holy Symbol, and carefully sensed the location of the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong stopped above a small river at the edge of the forest that wound through the forest like an agile black snake.

“It should be here!” Huang Xiaolong said, and then activated formation on the Black Corpse Holy Symbol. Immediately, black rays of light shone from the Black Corpse Holy Symbol, covering the black river area.

Under the black light’s coverage, the black river’s calm waters started to gurgle loudly, raising great waves across the surface. Then, rays of light shone from the river as an enormous black hole appeared.

Huang Xiaolong did not hesitate, and jumped into the black hole with Hei Luo.

The moment Huang Xiaolong passed through the black hole, all rays of light vanished. It took a moment before Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo’s feet touched the ground, and all around them was nothing but darkness. It was as if Huang Xiaolong had arrived at the bottom of an abyss of darkness.

Huang Xiaolong’s Golden Buddha Saint Godhead spun, sending out waves of golden Buddha holy energy, lightning up his immediate surroundings. The darkness receded and every last strand of corpse qi receded.

A palace came into sight, and it looked exactly the same as the Black Corpse Holy Palace at the Ghost Devil City.

However, the palace doors were tightly shut, and their surface glimmered with the restrictions placed by the Black Corpse Holy Emperor. Perhaps, it could also be seen as a test the Black Corpse Holy Emperor had set for the probable successor to his inheritance. Only by resolving the restrictions could the person obtain the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance.

A test set up by the Black Corpse Holy Emperor was naturally not simple. Most likely even True Saint Realm experts would have to spend several years, or several decades to open the restrictions. However, Huang Xiaolong merely spent half a day’s time to successfully open the restrictions.

Looking at the palace opening slowly, Huang Xiaolong ordered Hei Luo to stand guard outside before striding into the palace hall.

It bore some similarities to the Four Seas Holy Emperor’s inheritance. There was only one great statue in the main hall of the palace. Although the spiritual transparent stone’s quality, that was used for carving this statue, was not as good as Cangqiong Old Man’s statue, the quality was much better compared to the Four Seas Holy Emperor’s statue.

Other than the statue, there was nothing else in the hall. It was almost bare.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong did not lack ‘things’ at this point, except for strength.

Huang Xiaolong walked over to the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s statue to observe the intricate runes on the statue, and he was suddenly excited. It was an excitement stemming from obtaining the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, and his impending breakthrough to Second Heaven True Saint Realm.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong took a moment to calm down, and then he rose to midair and sat cross-legged facing the statue. He circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as he began accepting the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance.

The holy light enshrouding Huang Xiaolong doubled in size.

More than a decade passed in the blink of an eye.

On this day, tribulation clouds gathered above the ancient battlefield, and the dao tribulation’s lightning dragon was condensing at rapid speed.

Under the pressure of a dao tribulation, the surroundings’ undead spirits and nethersouls were trembling as they moved away.

“This is someone crossing dao tribulation?!”

“This person must be crazy to attempt crossing the dao tribulation in the ancient battlefield! He is looking to die!”

In the far distance, some high-level True Saint Realm experts, who were entering the ancient battlefield, exclaimed when they sensed the gathering dao tribulation.

In general, after surviving a tribulation and dao tribulation, there would be a period of temporary weakness. Moreover, time was needed to absorb the dao tribulation’s energy. Therefore, whenever someone was going to cross their tribulation, they would choose a safe location. Probably Huang Xiaolong was the only person who dared to cross his dao tribulation at a place like the ancient battlefield.
