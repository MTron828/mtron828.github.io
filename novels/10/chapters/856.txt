Huang Xiaolong wore an amiable smile on his face, “Yes, it’s me.” As if the two of them were best friends that hadn’t met up for a long time.

After a brief surprise, Xiang Mingzhi’s mouth widened into a smile, “Huang Xiaolong, you actually dared to come looking for me?” He shook his head as he said this, “Should I say you’re tired of living or that you’re a pig brain?”

Huang Xiaolong continued to approach Xiang Mingzhi with slow steps, a relaxed air about him, “You broke through to late-Second Order Highgod Realm in such a short time... Initially, if you weren’t heavily injured to this point, it would have taken quite a lot of effort for me to kill you, but now there’s no difficulty.”

Xiang Mingzhi laughed out loud hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, “A measly God Realm ant like you wants my life? No difficulty? Huang Xiaolong, you think can kill me?” Xiang Mingzhi’s expression was chilling as his killing intent surged madly, “I’m going to let you know that, even if I’m heavily injured, killing you takes no more than the effort of lifting a finger!” As Xiang Mingzhi said this, he lifted his hand and pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong.

“Lightning Dragon Finger!”

A myriad of lightning streaks flew out from Xiang Mingzhi’s finger, forming a lightning dragon that spiraled in the air, arriving before Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

The surrounding temperature shot up and the air currents became turbulent.

Lightning force struck like an angry hurricane.

Watching the loud and violent lightning dragon from Xiang Mingzhi’s finger, Huang Xiaolong also lifted his arm and countered with a finger attack. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Shrill shrieks of strange creatures rang out, a thick fog rolled and expanded as an overwhelming force came from Huang Xiaolong’s finger.

The Absolute Soul Finger!

A thunderous collision shook the heavens.

The lightning dragon formed from Xiang Mingzhi’s finger force exploded in midair, but Huang Xiaolong’s Absolute Soul Finger force also turned invisible.

Shaken by the Absolute Soul Finger’s force, Xiang Mingzhi swayed and staggered back two steps.

“This!” Xiang Mingzhi was shocked, stared at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief. He was extremely confident that his Lightning Dragon Finger could knock Huang Xiaolong into the air, gravely injuring him to the extent of hanging by a breath, yet he himself was forced to retreat two steps!

When Xiang Mingzhi’s shock subsided, he tensed up. When he looked at Huang Xiaolong once more, there was a heaviness in his eyes. Even though he did not use his full force in that attack, the fact that Huang Xiaolong was able to force him to retreat showed that Huang Xiaolong’s strength was not any weaker than his.

But, didn’t that mean the current Huang Xiaolong’s strength was comparable to a late-Second Order Highgod Realm master.

Astonishment and shock struck Xiang Mingzhi’s heart; Huang Xiaolong, a God Realm cultivator, actually had strength comparable to himself?! Although his cultivation was at late-Second Order Highgod Realm, his battle strength actually rivaled a late-Third Order Highgod Realm master.

Didn’t this mean that Huang Xiaolong also had battle strength equivalent to a late-Third Order Highgod Realm master?!

“Huang Xiaolong, no wonder you dared to come looking for me.” Xiang Mingzhi took a deep breath before saying, “I didn’t expect you to come so far. I admit that you’re indeed a rare genius, and I did underestimate you before, but today, you won’t be able to leave here alive! I will kill you, with all of my strength, I will kill you!” Xiang Mingzhi roared. If he let Huang Xiaolong go again today, then he would never be able to kill him! Especially after Huang Xiaolong broke through to the Highgod Realm, the one dying would be himself!

Huang Xiaolong had become too terrifying!

If he already had strength equivalent to a late-Third Order Highgod Realm at perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm, then what would happen when Huang Xiaolong stepped into the Highgod Realm? How overwhelming would his strength be?

Maybe, at that time, all the disciples in this Overflowing Lightning World would be no match for him!

Huang Xiaolong detected the sharp killing intent from Xiang Mingzhi, but he remained calm, “Is that so? Just as well, I also decided not to let you leave here alive, I will kill you and take away your Azure Dragon Divine Fire.”

Xiang Mingzhi snickered, “Since it’s like that, I’ll let you die under my Azure Dragon Divine Fire, you should be honored.”

An azure fire dragon flew out from Xiang Mingzhi’s body, and the roar of a dragon resounded in the heavens. When the Azure Dragon Divine Fire appeared, the surrounding lightning was reduced into a fog, scattering in the wind.

Even the lightning in this Overflowing Lightning World could not contend with the power of the Azure Dragon Divine Fire.

The temperature within ten thousand li soared to a burning heat. Especially the temperature in the valley, it was as if it had fallen into a magma chamber in the middle of the earth.

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong summoned his Black Tortoise Divine Fire. An icy-blue pillar of light rose to the sky from his body as an icy-blue fire rushed out from the Black Tortoise Divine Fire spirit.

Hindered by this icy-blue fire, the Azure Dragon Divine Fire wasn’t able to reach within a hundred zhang of Huang Xiaolong, not to mention injuring him.

The Black Tortoise and Azure Dragon Divine Fires collided again and again, forming two opposing and attacking sides, one blue and one azure.

Xiang Mingzhi watched in shock as the icy-blue fire Huang Xiaolong summoned could actually fight toe to toe against his Azure Dragon Divine Fire. Staring at the Black Tortoise Divine Fire spirit, a thought flashed in his mind, blurting out: “The Black Tortoise Divine Fire?! I must be right, that’s the Black Tortoise Divine Fire!” Feverish greed shone from Xiang Mingzhi’s eyes, “It’s the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, hahahaha! Huang Xiaolong, you really gave me a great surprise, as long as I kill you and integrate with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, I can flatten all the disciples in this Overflowing Lightning World, not even that Wangu Yanhui would be my opponent!”

“This tournament’s first place is mine!” Xiang Mingzhi was ecstatic.

Huang Xiaolong did not respond to Xiang Mingzhi’s self-righteous babbling. A crisp cry of a phoenix originating from the ancient world rang in the air as a brilliant crimson red light entered the fray, lighting up the sky. The Vermilion Bird Divine Fire spirit flew around Huang Xiaolong, flapping out waves of crimson fire.

When the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire merged with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, their forces multiplied. The Black Tortoise Divine Fire that was previously in equilibrium against the Azure Dragon Divine Fire gained the upper hand, pushing back the Azure Dragon Divine Fire. Although it wasn’t very obvious, it was detectable with the naked eye.

The ecstatic expression on Xiang Mingzhi’s face cracked, “T-this, this is the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire?!”

“You even obtained the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!”

Huang Xiaolong actually had two of the four great divine fires! Moreover, both divine fires had merged, resulting in his Azure Dragon Divine Fire being suppressed!

While Xiang Mingzhi was still in shock, a powerful tiger roar reverberated in the valley and a white tiger formed from metallic white fire appeared at Huang Xiaolong’s side. With three divine fires present, Xiang Mingzhi’s Azure Dragon Divine Fire was ebbing like a low tide, shrinking smaller, totally and completely suppressed!

“The White Tiger Divine Fire?! It really is the White Tiger Divine Fire!!” Xiang Mingzhi’s voice was shaking, his face horribly pale. The elation he felt earlier had completely disappeared.

Huang Xiaolong actually obtained three divine fires!

As long as Huang Xiaolong got his Azure Dragon Divine Fire, he would have the complete four great divine fires! The four divine fires together possessed heaven-defying power!

Then, a possibility flashed in Xiang Mingzhi’s mind. Until now, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had stagnated at perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm instead of advancing further. Could Huang Xiaolong have planned to obtain all four divine fires before making his attempt to break through to Highgod Realm?!

He himself was able to condense a top rank godhead just by having the Azure Dragon Divine Fire. If Huang Xiaolong obtained all four divine fires, the godhead he condensed would be...?!

Thinking of this, Xiang Mingzhi’s face was bloodlessly pale. At this moment, he felt death breathing down on him, closing in on him!

After the three divine fires emerged, Huang Xiaolong summoned his black and blue twin dragon martial spirits and soul transformed. A thousand arms fanned out from his back, ready to attack!

The Fifteenth Move of the Dragon God, Unrivaled Myriad Dragons!

Undulating roars of countless dragons resounded in the valley.

In order to avoid an unnecessary nightmare, Huang Xiaolong decided to finish Xiang Mingzhi in the shortest time possible.
