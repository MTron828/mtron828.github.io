Chapter 3598 – Sleepless Sea

Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were stunned by the sudden question.

“There’s somewhere you can try.” Jin Hai muttered, “It’s called the Sleepless Sea, but it’s located in the extreme north. The Sleepless Sea is too far away from us, and we’ll have to cross half the Limitless Land in order to get there! We’ll even have to pass through the Limitless Capital!”

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.

“That’s right. It’s the Sleepless Sea!” Wei Zhi nodded. “There are said to be several universe-level spiritual veins in the Sleepless Sea, but it’s not a good place to go adventuring. It’s difficult to enter the Sleepless Sea, and even more so if you wish to explore its depths.”

Jin Hai continued, “The Sleepless Sea is a place populated by the members of the Ocean Race. You won’t be able to avoid them if you wish to enter, and they’re no Sentient Mountain or Sea of Burial. Not even the Limitless Celestial Empire dares to piss them off!”

“The Ocean King is terrifyingly strong, and even if he’s not as strong as the Limitless Master, he’s close! Moreover, he will be able to draw upon the power of the Sleepless Sea if a fight ever happens in there, and the Limitless Master wouldn't be able to do a thing to him!”

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly.

“Other than the Ocean Race, there are countless ocean beasts in there. Weird universal storms sweep across the depth of the Limitless Sea, and it contains extremely powerful elements! Not even the Ocean King dares to travel around to the dangerous regions.” Jin Hai explained.

Universal storms containing elements of the Jade Flame and Limitless Water was something feared by God of Creation Realm experts!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t really care too much about them since he had the number one treasure in the thirteen universes, the Universe Boat.

The only problem he might run into was the Ocean King. If the Limitless Master couldn’t do a thing to him, the man might prove to be troublesome.

“Other than the Sleepless Sea, is there anywhere else with universe-level spiritual veins?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The two of them thought about it for some time before Wei Zhi spoke up, “I’ve heard that Lord Lin Qiankun of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire is looking to trade away a batch of universe-level spiritual veins.”

“A batch?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

Wei Zhi nodded, “Lin Qiankun is a half step Universe God, and he’s the oldest half step Universe God in the Limitless Land. His strength ranks among the top, and I’m not surprised he has a batch of universe-level spiritual veins for sale. There seems to be more than twenty spiritual veins in the batch, and two of them are top-grade spiritual veins. There are six at the mid-grade, and the others are all high-grade universe-level spiritual veins.” Wei Zhi shook his head and sighed all of a sudden, “It’s impossible to obtain the spiritual veins. He’s asking for a top-grade creation artifact, and there’s no way anyone will trade it with him!”

Universe-level spiritual veins might be special, but they were useless to God of Creation Realm experts who had crossed the 10 billion units mark. A top-grade creation artifact was different. It was useful no matter how strong one became!

After all, it was extremely useful to increase one’s combat prowess.

That was also the reason why no one wanted to trade with Lin Qiankun.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock when he heard the condition. “Is that all he wants?”

Jin Hai and Wei Zhi were shocked to see the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Did he actually possess a top-grade creation artifact?! No… The real question was if he was planning to make the trade!

“Lord, that’s right. Any top-grade creation artifact will do.” Jin Hai replied.

“Lord, are you really planning to trade with him?” Wei Zhi asked. “It’s not worth it to trade a top-grade creation artifact for spiritual veins!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, but he didn’t answer the question. “Do you know of anyone else who has universe-level spiritual veins? It would be great if they’re as generous as Lin Qiankun.”

?!

A weird feeling appeared in their hearts when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Lord Zhou Chi from the Ice Mountain seems to have a lot of spiritual veins…” Jin Hai thought for a little before answering the question. “Lord Zhou Chi entered the depths of the Land of Death many times, and he obtained a ton of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins. However, his temper is extremely eccentric and he’s extremely violent. He’s even stronger than Lin Qiankun, and it won’t be easy to convince him to do a trade.”

There weren’t too many experts in the Limitless Land who managed to exceed 10 billion units of cosmos energy, but Zhou Chi was one of them.

“How strong is he?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“He probably has 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy…” Wei Zhi frowned.

As experts of their level would rarely reveal their cultivation base, not too many people knew how strong they were! However, Wei Zhi’s estimation should be pretty much accurate.

“What about the Limitless Celestial Empire’s treasury?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jin Hai and Wei Zhi stared at Huang Xiaolong as their jaws dropped in fright.

“Limitless Celestial Empire?!” Jin Hai gasped.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the two of them and continued, “There should be quite a few spiritual veins in their treasury, right?”

If Lin Qiankun could bring out twenty spiritual veins, the master of the Limitless Land should possess more than that!

“We have no idea how many universe-level spiritual veins they have in the treasury… However, we can be sure they have quite a few.” Jin Hai shook his head and sighed.

The two of them weren’t willing to reveal too much information about the celestial empire.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the looks on their faces. It seemed as though the influence the Limitless Master had on them was quite large.

Soon after, he asked about the situation in the surrounding regions, especially the Land of Death.

The Land of Death was located close to the Limitless Land, and in the past, the two God of Creation Realm experts of the Sentient Mountain traveled there together. Jin Hai and Wei Zhi said that Zhou Chi had entered the Land of Death in the past to obtain universe-level spiritual veins, and he became extremely curious.

When they heard his question, looks of fear formed on their faces. The expert who owned the Land of Death was the God of Death himself, one of the five strongest experts in the Unknown Space!

Not a single God of Creation dared to create a city in the Land of Death as it was shrouded in death qi. As such, there was little to no information on the region. Not many experts dared to cultivate in the Land of Death too.

Despite the absence of life in the Land of Death, the God of Death managed to nurture a giant army. They were called the Death God Army, and the weakest members were experts who had comprehended the elements! The Death God Army was the strongest force in the Unknown Space!
