Chapter 2181: Looking for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool

“Lord!” The rulers of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country stared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Enter! Locate the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool!” Huang Xiaolong stared at Dong Cheng, the Heavenly Terror Ruler, and he ordered coldly. The most important thing he had to do was to obtain the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool to gather all nine great lightning pools!

As long as he gathered all of them, his Senior Brother Jiang Hong would be able to come back to life! Moreover, he would be able to form the Grandmist Lightning Pool! By controlling the Grandmist Lightning, he would be able to do whatever he wanted in the Heavens Path! No one would be able to stop him!

Also, he would no longer need to fear the lightning restrictions protecting the gates leading out of the 33 heavens! He would be able to stay in the outside world for as long as he wanted!

Huang Xiaolong quickly brought the experts from the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country to the lightning space.

The lightning energy in the heaven beyond heavens space was much calmer than before, and it was no longer raging like it was in the past. Even so, this space was filled with terrifying bolts of lightning that could fry even the late-Tenth Order Emperors. Every single individual who had come over were at the very least peak late-Tenth Order Emperors.

As for Huang Xiaolong’s party, all of them were existences who were in the Sovereign Realm. The weakest one out of them all were overlords and the lightning energy did nothing more than tickle them.

Riding on the back of the Golden Pig Treasure, Huang Xiaolong activated the eight great lightning pools to locate the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool. As the eight chaos lightning pools gathered, they swallowed the lightning energy around Huang Xiaolong endlessly.

Huang Xiaolong’s goal was as simple as it could get. All he had to do was to locate the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool before anyone else! Without the slightest delay, he rushed straight towards the depths of the space outside the 33 heavens.

From the investigations done by the Heavenly Saint Ruler, the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool was located in the depths of the space outside the 33 heavens.

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong and the others entered the lightning space, they were assaulted by a group of lightning beasts.

There were two great dangers the space outside the 33 heavens posed. One was the lightning restrictions, and the other was the lightning beasts.

These lightning beasts had an innate lightning body and they devoured the lightning energy contained in the space outside the 33 heavens since they were born. They had a horrifyingly strong defense and they were virtually unkillable.

A single lightning beast wasn’t too much of a threat as stronger experts could just run away, but the headache inducing fact was that the lightning beasts traveled in groups of hundreds. Larger groups were counted in the thousands and even tens of thousands!

The moment anyone ran into a herd of lightning beasts, even existences like the ruler of the Heavenly Saint Country, and the Mighty God Heavenly Country would be in trouble.

One had to know that the weakest of the lightning beasts were at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. Most of them were Sovereigns, and several tens of thousands of them would mean a terrifying force!

Luckily, the group of the lightning beasts Huang Xiaolong ran into had dozens of these beasts at best.

There wasn’t a need for Huang Xiaolong to make a move as the rulers of both heavenly countries along with the various experts around them took care of the beasts in an instant.

With the combined might of so many overlord level experts, the lightning beasts were turned into a mist of blood in an instant. Lightning qi filled the area, and the eight great lightning pools in Huang Xiaolong’s body devoured them in an instant.

Without slowing down, they sped towards the deeper regions of the space.

“It’s a Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruit!”

Someone pointed towards one of the mountain ranges along the way and yelled.

As everyone turned to look at the peak of the mountain range, they saw a lightning attributed tree. Several deep blue fruits were growing on it!

Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruit!

Origin treasure!

Even though it was a mid-grade level one origin treasure, it was considered a priceless treasure in the outside world! Moreover, there were more than twenty fruits growing on the tree and they seemed to have just ripened...

Everyone from the two heavenly countries turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong agreed to whatever they were thinking of. Even though level one origin treasures were useless to him, they were precious treasures for the various experts from the two heavenly countries.

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong had agreed to allow them to do as they wished, everyone shot towards the mountain peak to snatch the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruits.

It went without saying that it wouldn’t be easy for anyone to obtain origin treasures. The Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Tree spat out dense lightning qi that stopped all the experts in their tracks.

Seeing as the tree was slowing him down, Huang Xiaolong’s Sovereign’s will turned into a tiny chaos axe that slammed into the lightning qi protecting the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Tree. A path was cleaved out in an instant.

All of a sudden, a scream came from afar, “Everyone, hurry up and make your move! It’s the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruit!” A huge net formed with lightning energy appeared in the air as it covered the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Tree. It was clear that the other party wanted to grab all twenty Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruits.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he waved his right hand. The God Burying Coffin shot outwards, and miserable shrieks filled the air. The simple act of throwing out the God Burying Coffin killed more than half of the strength from the other side.

As he flicked his finger, the lightning net changed its trajectory as it flew towards him.

“You... Huang Xiaolong, you... How dare you kill so many experts from my Massacring God Heavenly Country?!” The other party pointed at Huang Xiaolong and raged. A trace of surprise was mixed with a tinge of hatred as this person glared at Huang Xiaolong.

The Massacring God Heavenly Country was ranked in the top ten and even though they weren’t as strong as the Heavenly Saint Country, they were ranked higher than the Mighty God Heavenly Country. In fact, they were ranked sixth among all the heavenly countries.

The person who had screamed was precisely the ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country. He wanted to snatch all the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruits the moment Huang Xiaolong broke through its defense before escaping. If he succeeded, there was nothing Huang Xiaolong and the others could do.

He had never expected Huang Xiaolong’s reactions to be so quick! As soon as he had made a move, Huang Xiaolong had killed more than half of the experts he had brought with him. Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong was such a ruthless character. After all, in his mind, Huang Xiaolong had already offended the Heavenly Terror Country and he wouldn’t dare to offend another superpower in the Heavens Path.

Too bad Huang Xiaolong was never one to restrain himself. If he wanted to kill someone, there was no stopping him.

A frosty glare landed on the ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country. “You should be prepared to give up your life if you plan on stealing from me. If you don’t get lost right now, I’ll exterminate your Massacring God Heavenly Country!”

The expression on the face of the Massacring God Heavenly Country’s Ruler sank and it became extremely ugly. After shooting a final glare at Huang Xiaolong, he turned to leave.

“Lord, the Massacring God Ruler won’t let this pass...” The Heavenly Saint Ruler turned to Huang Xiaolong and said.

“Whatever.” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

The most important thing was to locate the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool. The killings would only truly start after he obtained it!

“Keep going!” Huang Xiaolong led the experts of the two heavenly countries deeper into the space after they grabbed the Heaven Longevity Lightning Spiritual Fruits.

Along the way, they were attacked by tons of lightning beasts. Of course, misfortune and fortune came hand in hand. They saw many precious treasures along the way. The space outside the 33 heavens had treasures growing all around and there were some items that moved Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad for him that obtaining all of them was impossible. There were some treasures that were too difficult to obtain and Huang Xiaolong could only give up on them in order to quicken his search for the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool.

Finally, they arrived at the deepest part of the space outside the 33 heavens.

The eight great lightning pools started to fluctuate and they seemed to be rejoicing about being reunited.

“This...” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Spatial Domain Lightning Pool!

He had finally located it!

Without the slightest hesitation, Huang Xiaolong led everyone towards the final lightning pool.

Just as they were about to start their search, Huang Xiaolong and the others bumped into a group of men wearing robes made from lightning defending the area. There were others searching for something with some sort of secret method.
