“This Huang Xiaolong, could it be he wasn’t heavily injured after killing Xiang Mingzhi?” Wangu Shuo finally muttered after a long silence looking at the 8th place on the ranking list, where the three characters ‘Huang Xiao Long’ were radiating light like the midday sun.

He then exhaled heavily, “Not only was he not injured, he also broke through!”

This was the only reasonable explanation.

“Yelu Tianfeng, Beitang Wuji, these two disciples’ cultivation was at peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm, but they still died in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.” Wangu Zhi’s eyes glimmered, “This Huang Xiaolong, is he a Fourth Order Highgod Realm now? Could it be that he was a peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm when he killed Xiang Mingzhi, and then he broke through to Fourth Order later?”

“Peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm?” Wangu Shuo shook his head, “It can’t be. If he really was a peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm before, it’s impossible for this matter to not found out when he was being tested during the registration process.”

Wangu Yuan subconsciously frowned, “If he isn’t a Fourth Order Highgod Realm, how could he kill Yelu Tianfeng and Beitang Wuji?”

Wangu Shuo choked, not knowing the answer to that question. The other Elders were also silent.

“This Huang Xiaolong really gave everyone an unexpected surprise.” A while later, Wangu Changqing spoke, breaking the silence, “There’s a little over a month left to the tournament, I wonder what his final result will be.”

Wangu Zhi stated solemnly, “In my opinion, the highest he can achieve is his current ranking, the 8th place. In fact, there’s still a chance he might be kicked down again by the 9th place Jiang Xiaosu, or the 10th place’s Jian Shiyi. Let’s not forget that the 11th ranked Lu Dongwei could climb back up into the top ten.”

“There is that possibility. Jiang Xiaosu, Jian Shiyi, and Lu Dongwei have reached Fourth Order Highgod Realm for a long time, whereas this Huang Xiaolong has just broken through to Fourth Order, barely consolidating his new cultivation level. Maintaining a position within the top ten would be difficult for him.” Wangu Yuan agreed, nodding his head.

The other Wangu Clan Elders also nodded in agreement with Wangu Yuan’s analysis.

Both Wangu Shuo and Wangu Changqing kept silent. Personally, the two of them had a feeling that the 8th place was not Huang Xiaolong’s best achievement, there was a chance this little guy would enter the top five!

Not knowing why, the scene of a black-haired young man sending a late-First Order Highgod Realm flying with one move during the registration suddenly flashed in Wangu Shuo’s mind.

‘Is that black-haired kid the same Huang Xiaolong on the list?’ As the thought flashed in his mind, Wangu Shuo shook his head, disputing himself, the two couldn’t be the same person. How could it be possible for a perfection peak late-Tenth Order God Realm to kill Xiang Mingzhi, Yelu Tianfeng, Beitang Wuji, and the high level other disciples?

While the large crowd on Aeon Square was filled with talks about Huang Xiaolong, the disciples in the Overflowing Lightning World finally noticed the great chances in the ranking and were undoubtedly startled.

From the beginning of the tournament until now, with a little less than two months left, the top ten rankings had always been monopolized by disciples of Fourth Order Highgod Realm. But now, all of a sudden, this Huang Xiaolong jumped out of nowhere, making his way into the top ten! How did he do this, suddenly appearing at the 8th spot?! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The disciples who did not pay attention to the ranking list in the last two days even suspected that something went wrong with the ranking list.

Two days ago, Huang Xiaolong’s ranking was in the nine-hundreds, but now, he suddenly killed his way into the top ten, taking the number eight spot. These disciples could hardly be blamed for suspecting that something was wrong with the ranking list.

At this time, on a flat plain not far from the mountain range where the Lightning God’s cultivation dwelling was located, a young woman clad in a green dress, who appeared to be pretty despite the semi-transparent veil on her face, retrieved her divine sense from the jade token. Her willowy eyebrows creased in a furrow, “Huang Xiaolong? He actually took this young mistress’ place? How interesting.”

This pretty woman was none other than the Tempest Academy disciple that Huang Xiaolong squeezed out from the 8th place, Jiang Xiaosu.

“According to the message passed by other Tempest Academy disciples through the communication talisman, not far up ahead is the Lightning God Palace.” Jiang Xiaosu said to herself as she blurred in a flicker, disappearing in the direction of the mountain range.

Her speed was alarmingly fast. Watching her from the distance, her figure seemed like a whirl of unpredictable breeze.

There was no place where the winds didn’t blow, traversing thousands of li in an instant.

While Jiang Xiaosu made her way to the Lightning God Palace, other disciples also received a similar message through the communication talisman from their sect brothers and hurried over to the Lightning God Palace.

Among them was a giant fireball, flying across the sky at a horrifying speed toward the Lightning God Palace. This giant fireball was the transformation of a stalwart young man; on this young man’s forehead was a flame mark resembling the ancient character for fire. As this young man flew, this flame mark glimmered like burning embers.

This young man was originally ranked at the 10th place until Huang Xiaolong’s appearance forced him out, pushing him to he 11th place. He was the Orthodox Yang Sect’s Lu Dongwei. This also gave birth to Lu Dongwei’s hate toward Huang Xiaolong.

“Hmph, Huang Xiaolong? I really want to see how capable you are to take the 8th spot! Hopefully, when we meet, you can withstand my Pure Yang Fire, otherwise, hehe...” Lu Dongwei sneered.

In one of the Lightning God’s Palace buildings, a young man clad in a white brocade robe exuded an everlasting aura of old, looking at the name that appeared at the 8th place, a strong killing intent flickered in his eyes.

“The central formation should be somewhere nearby.” The white brocade robe young man looked around intently, inhaling deeply, ‘As long as I find the central formation, this Lightning God’s cultivation dwelling is mine!’

In a flicker, the young man was already gone.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t aware that he had become the common target of the disciples in the top ten. After entering the palace grounds he discovered that, in here, his divine sense was being suppressed. With his current strength, his divine sense could only extend for a hundred zhang.

Any other peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm disciples, more likely than not, wouldn’t be able to spread out their divine sense at all.

This finding resulted in the frown between Huang Xiaolong’s brows, there were hundreds of palace buildings in this Lightning God Palace, and if he had to search all of those buildings one by one until the tournament ended, he still wouldn’t be able to find the central formation.

But, Huang Xiaolong did not have a better plan, he could only search the buildings one by one.

About an hour later, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of an inconspicuous palace building. Looking at this building, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes gradually lit up. Although this particular palace building was inconspicuous and others might easily overlook it, Huang Xiaolong detected the difference between this place and the other ones he had searched through.

He went in, arriving at the main palace hall, then looked at the pillar erected at the center. This pillar was decorated with the carving of a lightning dragon.

Prompted by his suspicions, Huang Xiaolong created a few seal imprints with his hands and sent them into the eyes of the lightning dragon.

Immediately, the lighting dragon came to life, causing streaks of lightning to appear around the pillar and thunder to rumble in the hall. Lightning force spread out like waves crashing the shore, bathing the palace hall in a glaring light and causing the surroundings to change. The inconspicuous hall reflected a crystalline light and an unknown fragrance filled every corner of the space.

Looking up, Huang Xiaolong saw pieces of bone that resembled translucent crystal stone floating above the hall. The crystallite light and the fragrance came precisely from these bones.

“These are, the bones of a lightning dragon?!” A voice sounded from afar, followed by the sound of rushing wind, then a figure appeared right outside the palace building.

It was the figure of a thin young man. His fingers were very long, exuding a whelming pressure; he was far stronger than Yelu Tianfeng and Beitang Wuji.

A Fourth Order Highgod Realm disciple!
