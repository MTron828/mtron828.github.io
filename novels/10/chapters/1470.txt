“The Battle of the Heavenly Court being brought forward is not a good sign.” Chen Yirong’s furrows deepened as he added, “In the past, one could hardly find a supreme godhead genius in ten million years, but now, there’s suddenly a boom of supreme godhead geniuses—this is a sign ah!”

Li Shan also looked worried as he sighed. “Every time before the Divine World faces turmoil, supreme godhead geniuses appear. Does that mean that the Divine World is going to fall into chaos in the near future?”

The four of them had experienced the last Divine World’s catastrophe, and apprehension gripped their hearts every time they remembered the situation from that time.

During the last Divine World’s catastrophe, rivers of blood had flowed in all directions. Not to mention, the number of God King Realm cultivators’ corpses, even corpses of Heavenly Monarch Realm masters were piled high as a mountain, and even a number of Emperors had not been able to escape that catastrophe.

At that time, two of Fortune Emperor Palace’s Ancestors had fallen as well.

Fang Gan, Zhou Chen, and Chen Yirong also fell into reminiscence thinking of the catastrophe.

“If the Divine World is about to face another catastrophe, we can only strive to become stronger, improve the Fortune Emperor Palace’s grand defensive formations, and prepare well in order to come out with the least loss.” Fang Gan sighed and went on, “The last time when the Hell’s Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had led the Spirit World’s masters to attack our Divine World, the Hell’s Asura World, Ghost World, and the Demon World had also joined in, wanting a share, and causing great damage to the Divine World. Could the coming catastrophe be related to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe?”

“There is such a possibility indeed.” Li Shan nodded in agreement. “At that time, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor was severely injured by the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, rendering the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe to flee in defeat, but the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor was unwilling to give up. He secretly gathered power, and all these years, he not only has healed his injuries but his strength has risen as well. From the information I’ve received, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor has broken through that realm!”

That ‘realm!’

Fang Gan, Zhou Chen, and Chen Yirong’s expressions showed the shock in their hearts.

“Now that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor is not around, could the Divine World fend off the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor?” Fang Gan sighed.

“I’ve heard that the venerable King of Grandmist has reached the peak of stage nine in the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, and he is likely to break through to stage ten at any time. If he is willing to help us, we won’t need to fear the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Ancestor.” Zhou Chen said suddenly.

Chen Yirong shook his head, “The venerable King of Grandmist has withdrawn from worldly affairs for billions of years. He didn’t even show up in the last Divine World’s catastrophe, so I don’t think he will show up this time either.”

“Unless, the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Grandmist Emperor is willing to plead to the King of Grandmist,” Li Shan elaborated on his idea, “Moreover, only the Grandmist Emperor knows the location of the venerable King of Grandmist.”

The Grandmist Emperor was the King of Grandmist’s disciple!

And the Grandmist Emperor Palace was the Divine World’s number one Emperor Palace force!

A true hegemon of the Divine World.

Although the Fortune Emperor Palace ranked among the top one hundred Emperor Palaces in the Divine World, it was also considered as a ‘giant force,’ and they were more than one or two levels below the Grandmist Emperor Palace. This difference was almost insurmountable.

Fang Gan chuckled wryly and said, “The Grandmist Emperor has not appeared for a long time as well, it is said that he has been in seclusion, practicing the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. It’s almost an impossible feat to have him plead with the King of Grandmist, unless the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe attacks the Grandmist Emperor Palace.”

“In the whole Divine World, only the Grandmist Emperor has successfully practiced the King of Grandmist’s Grandmist Parasitic Medium.” Zhou Chen sighed.

Li Shan laughed at his words, “The Grandmist Parasitic Medium is an extremely profound technique, one needs to comprehend the grandmist esoterics to practice it, it’s not something people like us can think of.”

The four continued to converse about the Divine World, the Heavenly Court, and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and their conversations went on for a long time.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong informed the little cow and the others through his communication talisman that he would return to the Edge of the World Manor after the conclusion of the grand apprenticeship ceremony in half a year.

Huang Xiaolong then sat cross-legged inside his room and summoned out his three avatars. He took out two Fortune Divine Fruits as he began to cultivate.

His cultivation had reached the peak of early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. Could he break through to the mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm in half a year?

....

Time trickled away.

One after another Fortune Divine Fruits disappeared as Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars continued to refine and absorb the Fortune Divine Fruits’ fortune energy.

At first, it was two Fortune Divine Fruits in a day; two months later, it was three Fortune Divine Fruits, and by the fourth month, it was five fruits in a day!

The fifth month arrived.

Suddenly, a bright light broke out from Huang Xiaolong’s body and his momentum soared.

At the same time, bright lights also shone out from his three avatars’ bodies.

An hour later, the light around Huang Xiaolong gradually diminished, and converged internally. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes happily, as he had finally broken through to mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm!

His breakthrough process this time was especially smooth and fast.

The thirty thousand Fortune Divine Fruits that Zhao Lei had given him contained more concentrated fortune energy, as compared to the Fortune Divine Fruits rewarded at the rankings competition.

Of course, the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s continuous tempering of his body and godhead also contributed to his smooth breakthrough to mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

In these five months, through the Fortune Divine Fruits’ fortune energy, his comprehension towards the fortune and creation esoterics, and life and death esoterics had improved even further.

Although, there was one thing that bothered and depressed Huang Xiaolong—his Grandmist Parasitic Medium cultivation had no significant improvement.

He had clearly realized the many wonderful benefits the Grandmist Parasitic Medium had brought him over the years.

If it wasn’t for the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, it would have been impossible for his cultivation to rise so rapidly.

If it wasn’t for the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, it would have been impossible for him to resurrect Xiang Xun.

Currently, the grandmist worms condensed through his Grandmist Parasitic Medium could control some Second Order God King Realm masters, and with Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng’s assistance, he could even control the average Third Order God King Realm masters.

Moreover, whenever he circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he could vaguely feel a kind of spiritual energy entering his body, tempering his True Dragon Physique and godheads, significantly strengthening them.

“I heard that during the apprenticeship ceremony, some big trading houses are also going to send people over to attend the ceremony along with the nearby Emperor Palaces’ Emperors and their disciples.”

“Yes, and it seems even the Silver Fox Commerce is sending someone; there’s a rumor that it would be the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss, is it? It’s said that this Second Miss is beautiful and generous, an absolute beauty inside and out.”

“Some of the supreme godhead geniuses will also be challenging each other. It is surely going to be exciting.”

Huang Xiaolong overheard conversations of the disciples some distance away from him.
