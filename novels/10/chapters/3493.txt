Chapter 3494: Entering the Submerged Dragon Institution

 

“How many eyes are there on the Dragon Eye Cliff?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“There are a total of one hundred twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine eyes located on the Dragon Eye Cliff!” Pangu replied.

One hundred twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine!

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

“However, there are some who say that there are one hundred and thirty thousand dragon eyes in the cliff face.” Pangu continued, “The final one is said to be the key to comprehending all the mysteries. It’s said that the last eye isn’t located on the cliff, and one can only see the final eye after all one hundred twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine eyes open up!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “This seems interesting. Since you mentioned it, I should take a look at the Dragon Eye Cliff.”

Pangu laughed, “Everyone who enters the Star Dragon Universe wishes to take a look at the Dragon Eye Cliff. However, the old man, Yu Long, laid down countless formations around the cliff. One has to obtain his permission before they are able to approach it. According to the rules, one can also try to comprehend the mysteries behind the Dragon Eye Cliff after completing a high-level task at the institution. Of course, that is also a rule set by Yu Long.”

“Master, do you know the old dragon Yu Long?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Well, we know each other, but we’re not exactly friends. The old foggy’s reputation of being stubborn is universally famous. He’s extremely hard to get along with. Moreover, he’s someone who refuses to bend the rules. No one is an exception to the rules he set, and he won’t even make an exception for Xu Long! In the past, Xu Long had to complete a task for the institution before he was allowed to sit before the Dragon Eye Cliff.”

Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long sucked in a cold breath.

“Is it difficult to accomplish the task?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“It’s extremely difficult!” Pangu sighed. “When you enter the Submerged Dragon Institution, you will understand.” 

Huang Xiaolong felt his head hurt.

“However, I heard that it won’t be easy for us to enter the institution,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “There seems to be an extremely strict selection process.”

Pangu smiled in response, “You can leave that to me.”

In the following days, Huang Xiaolong was in no rush to head over to the Submerged Dragon Institution. Instead, he got Gu Yuan and Long Yi to look for information on the institution. He also got them to look for peak-grade dragon marrow.

He might still have some left, but it wasn’t as much as he liked.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong was discussing the dao with Pangu and his father when Pangu turned to stare at the void. “We have guests…”

Huang Long soon noticed the newcomer.

“He’s at the large completion stage. He should possess 5 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Is he from the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire?” Huang Long frowned.

“He’s called Ao Yu, and he’s one of Xu Long’s close confidants. He might not be strong, but he’s quite the important figure in the celestial empire,” Pangu explained.

Soon after, Pangu introduced the other three Gods of Creation to Huang Xiaolong.

“Master, should we get Wang Meiqi to meet with him?” Huang Xiaolong asked Pangu.

“Alright.” 

Ao Yu was rushing towards Huang Xiaolong’s manor when a figure appeared before him.

He stopped in his tracks and looked at the devastating beauty before him and asked, “You are?” 

“Wang Meiqi.” 

“It’s you!” Ao Yu sucked in a cold breath and took a step back in retreat.

“Are you here because of Ao Guang’s matter?” Wang Meiqi asked.

“Not entirely.” 

Wang Meiqi didn’t bother asking anymore as she stretched out her hand into the void. The space around the city started to crumble, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on Ao Yu. In a state of panic, Ao Yu retreated and a Dragon Shield appeared in his hand. He sent out countless strikes in order to stop Wang Meiqi.

As the city trembled under the might of two Gods of Creation, the formations laid down by Xu Long managed to hold them off temporarily. However, the same couldn’t be said for the space outside the city. Cracks started to form under the pressure of the two supreme experts. 

Celestial Emperor Ao Wen, Third Princess Ao Wen, Ao Guang, and the various experts in the imperial palace were shocked by the sudden change.

“This… Senior Ao Yu?!” 

Who in the world has the ability to challenge Ao Yu?

When everyone in the hall was still stuck in a state of shock, peace returned to the land.

They looked at each other doubtfully.

“Is it over?” Ao Chengyu released his dao soul, but he failed to discover anything. It came as no surprise as he hadn’t entered the God of Creation Realm yet. He wasn’t strong enough to discover experts like Wang Meiqi and Ao Yu if they wished to hide the outcome of the battle.

A figure shot into the hall when all of them were still guessing the outcome of the battle.

Ao Yu’s figure could be seen standing in the middle of the hall.

“Senior Ao Yu!” Celestial Emperor Ao Wen jumped in joy when he saw that Ao Yu was back. However, blood soon spewed from Ao Yu’s mouth.

Everyone in the hall froze in place as they looked at the puddle of blood forming under Ao Yu. The excitement to see him dissipated.

“Senior Ao Yu, are you alright?!” Celestial Emperor Ao Wen quickly went over to help him.

Everyone looked at Ao Yu in shock, but he shook his hands and sighed, “I’m alright, they held back.”

They heaved a sigh of relief when he said that he was fine.

“That…” Celestial Emperor Ao Wen couldn’t help but ask.

“It was Wang Meiqi,” Ao Yu replied.

“Wang Meiqi?!” Ao Guang and Third Princess Ao Wen yelled in shock. Ao Guang felt the blood draining from his body as he thought about his actions the day before.

“That’s right. She might be at the grand completion stage, but even if she isn’t, she’s not too far from it,” Ao Yu muttered.

Grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm?!

The experts in the hall sucked in a cold breath.

When Celestial Emperor Ao Wen heard what he said, question marks started forming in his head. Wasn’t she just a follower?!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Who in the world are Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long?!

Ao Yu coughed and spoke, “None of you are allowed to mess with Huang Xiaolong anymore. At least until Brother Xu Long’s return.”

Celestial Emperor Ao Wen and the others nodded obediently. Even if Ao Yu didn’t warn them, they wouldn’t provoke Huang Xiaolong any longer.

Without delay, a piece of news swept through the city. Second Prince Ao Guang was thrown into prison, and when everyone in the city learned that Celestial Emperor Ao Wen was the person who called for Ao Guang’s punishment, they were stunned.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised to hear as much, and he left the city that day itself. They left for the Submerged Dragon Institution when the news shocked many.

As soon as Celestial Emperor Ao Wen and the others received the news that Huang Xiaolong had left the city, they heaved a sigh of relief.

The institution was located quite some distance away from the Bearded Dragon City, and it was three months later when Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived. The gates of the Submerged Dragon Institution were tens of thousands of feet tall, and the dragon qi that surrounded it was dense. Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover that the gates were made out of peak-grade dragon soul crystals.
