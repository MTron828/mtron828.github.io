Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the Black Baboon entered into the three hundred and twentieth tomb. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After reaching the large coffin within the tomb, Huang Xiaolong flung away the coffin cover with a wave of his hand revealing the situation inside.

This coffin actually held two people!

It was a man and a woman— two of the Nefarious Devil Tribe experts’ corpses!

Judging from the way they were buried, these two were likely to be each other’s life companions.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze shifted to the two glowing Nefarious Devil Gold Cores; he had no intention to be polite. Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and swallowed them into his body.

These two Nefarious Devil Gold Cores contained a greater amount of energy as compared to any others gold cores Huang Xiaolong had refined so far.

The moment the two gold cores entered Huang Xiaolong’s body, golden streams of energy rushed out like tidal waves.

Shocked, Huang Xiaolong quickly sat down cross-legged. His three supreme godheads started spinning and began refining the energy.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong was entirely bathed in a golden halo.

This went on for a day before the golden halo gradually dimmed and then disappeared. Only then did Huang Xiaolong stop and opened his eyes.

Subsequently, a wry smile appeared on his face. ‘Two Nefarious Devil Gold Cores from Eighth Order Ancient God Realm and above apparently did not bring much improvement in his strength ah!’

After he had stepped into Ancient God Realm, his three supreme godheads’ bottomless pits had become super bottomless pits. No matter how much energy he threw inside the pits, there was always this feeling that they would never get full.

Until now, in these ancestral burial grounds, Huang Xiaolong had refined at least forty ancestral Nefarious Devil Gold Cores, probably even fifty. But yet, he had only risen to late-Second Order Ancient God Realm from peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm!

Further down this road, how much terrifying amount of energy would he need in order to breakthrough to Seventh Order Ancient God Realm?!

Huang Xiaolong’s head hurt as he thought about the Ancestor God Realm, ’Don’t think about it now.’

He got up from the ground and flew towards the coffin and stopped above it. Then he began spinning the Grandmist Puppetry Technique to refine the Nefarious Devil corpse into a puppet. However, as a precaution, Huang Xiaolong had the little cow and Black Baboon to help him.

The Eighth Order Ancient God Realm Nefarious Devil master whom he had refined earlier, had a powerful remnant will that nearly resulted in Huang Xiaolong getting injured if things had gone wrong and out of control.

While Huang Xiaolong was refining Nefarious Devil puppets at the ancestral burial grounds, Wangu Bifei and several Wangu Clan disciples had brought the injured Wangu Dongchen back to Eternal Mainland.

All of the Wangu Clan experts were assembled at the Wangu Clan headquarters great hall.

A middle-aged man was sitting on the great hall center main seat with a domineering aura. He had thick brows and fleshy ears, and was clad in a purple robe with a qilin emblem.This middle-aged man was none other than the current Wangu Clan Patriarch, Wangu Rui!

In his seat, Wangu Rui was akin to an unsheathed sharp chaos grade blade and no one dared to look at him.

Wangu Dongchen, Wangu Bifei, and several other disciples stood nervously in the hall.

Although Wangu Bifei was Wangu Clan’s core disciple, he rarely had any chance to be in the same room as Wangu Rui. It was not only just Patriarch Wangu Rui, but he also didn’t qualify to meet Wangu Clan’s Grand Elders up until now.

Wangu Bifei felt his legs turning into jelly, as he stood there facing Wangu Rui and all of the Grand Elders of Wangu Clan.

"You are Wangu Bifei?" Wangu Rui asked.

"Y-yes, Patriarch, I am Wangu Bifei." Wangu Bifei answered at once, quivering slightly.

"Tell me in detail about what took place— remember, do not conceal anything." Wangu Rui said. Although he had already heard everything about the incident from the Grand Elders, he wanted to hear Wangu Bifei speak about it personally.

Wangu Bifei shuddered as he complied and nervously recounted the event in detail, not daring to lie or conceal anything.

After listening to what had transpired directly from Wangu Bifei’s mouth, Wangu Rui’s fingers drummed the arm of the chair he was sitting on.

Wangu Dongchen remained standing, his head lowered as he was trying to reduce his presence.

None of the Grand Elders dared to utter a word.

"Ziyi, what are your thoughts about Huang Xiaolong?" Wangu Rui suddenly tilted his head to look at a scarlet-haired young man sitting on the first seat on his left.

Strands of hair fell loosely over the young man’s shoulders. He wore a faint smile on his lips. He did not carry any sense of urgency, but he was confident and amiable. Nonetheless, no one could simply ignore the determination in his eyes.

This young man was Vientiane World Wangu Clan’s number of peerless genius, Wangu Ziyi.

Wangu Ziyi stood up and answered respectfully, “Huang Xiaolong is stronger than You Wuxin,” Then his tone changed, filled with confidence, “But I am confident to defeat him in three strikes, even without resorting to white qilin flames!”

Huang Xiaolong had defeated Wangu Dongchen in one strike, but Wangu Ziyi was extremely confident that he could defeat Huang Xiaolong in three strikes! Even without resorting to white qilin flames!

However, no one in the great hall felt Wangu Ziyi was boasting, including Wangu Rui.

Wangu Rui nodded his head in satisfaction at Wangu Ziyi’s answer, “Still, you should not underestimate Huang Xiaolong. In the coming two years before the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle, you can cultivate at the Godly Qilin Furnace. I will have several Grand Elders help you. Seize the time to breakthrough to Sixth Order Ancient God Realm before the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle starts!”

The Godly Qilin Furnace was one of Wangu Clan’s most precious treasures passed down through generations. Inside the Godly Qilin Furnace was the soul of a divine qilin. Cultivating inside the furnace had unimaginable benefits to Wangu Clan disciples who possessed qilin bloodline.

However, even Wangu Clan Grand Elders were rarely granted permission to cultivate inside the Godly Qilin Furnace. Hence, it was inevitable that Wangu Dongchen, Wangu Bifei, and others were envious after hearing that.

“Thank you, Patriarch!” Wangu Ziyi beamed with joy.

Wangu Rui turned his head in Wangu Dongchen’s direction and dismissed them “All of you, go back.”

Upon finding that Patriarch Wangu Rui had no intention to punish them, Wangu Bifei and several other Wangu Clan disciples’ were inwardly feeling relieved. On the surface though, all of them respectfully complied and retreated from the great hall.

......

In a blink of an eye, another two passed.

Huang Xiaolong was refining a Nefarious Devil Gold Core he had just obtained inside a tomb at the Nefarious Devil Tribe’s ancestral burial ground.

Surging energy from the gold core rushed into every corner of Huang Xiaolong’s body. The little cow could see Huang Xiaolong’s body become bloated due to it.

Huang Xiaolong pushed his three supreme godheads to their limits, frenziedly absorbing the seemingly boundless energy rushing out from the Nefarious Devil God Core. Above Huang Xiaolong’s head was the little cow’s purple lightning cloud that was raining down lightning liquid, guarding him..

Three days and three nights later, Huang Xiaolong breathed out a sigh of relief.

He had finally reached peak late-Second Order Ancient God Realm!

Just a little bit more and he could advance to Third Order Ancient God Realm!

Huang Xiaolong got to his feet. His heart was beating with joy as he looked at the row of Nefarious Devil puppets experts.

During these two months, he had gone inside more than sixty tombs, increasing his number of Nefarious Devil puppets from twenty-three to thirty-three! Not to mention the strongest of his puppets had the strength of peak early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm!

Counting the other early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm puppet, Huang Xiaolong now had two Tenth Order and above Ancient God Realm subordinates.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong’s group flew out of the tomb and was soon standing in front of the next tomb. This was their four hundred and fifty-first tomb.

Looking at the thick death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy roiling at the entrance of this tomb, both he and the little cow felt their scalps go numb.

The thick death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy had surpassed the level of Huang Xiaolong’s current strength to absorb them, even by force. Huang Xiaolong felt pity. But there was nothing he could do about it, except order the Nefarious Devil puppets to disperse them.

Nevertheless, even after four days, the Nefarious Devil puppets were unable to completely disperse the thick death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy.

However, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were in no hurry as they stayed outside and cultivated while they waited.

After half a month had passed; the death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy that were accumulating at the tomb were finally cleared out.
