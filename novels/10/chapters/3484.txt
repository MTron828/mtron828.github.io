Chapter 3485: Choosing Who to Protect

“Oh, Huang Xiaolong is back!” Huang Sheng rejoiced the moment he felt Huang Xiaolong’s return.

“Yes, Old Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong is currently in the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire.” Huang Dinghai chuckled.

“Looks like he couldn’t control himself and chose to return after so many years…” Huang Sheng sneered.

“Should we send our army over? We’ll get the Excessive Darkness Old Ancestor and Extreme Bliss Old Ancestor over to capture him!” Huang Dinghai suggested.

It went without saying who they were.

In the millions of years that Huang Xiaolong was away, Huang Sheng constructed his own world and many celestial empires joined his banner.

There were more than twenty Gods of Creation working under Huang Sheng now.

The Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire had already been suppressed by the True Dragon Celestial Empire, and if not for the old dragon, the entire empire would have already fallen.

Of course, the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire wasn’t having a great time.

“Alright. Bring the Excessive Darkness Old Ancestor and the Extreme Bliss Old Ancestor. Get the old man to hand Huang Xiaolong over,” Huang Sheng muttered. “I’ll get the Great Myriad Old Ancestor and the Buddhist Yang Old Ancestor to head over with you guys too.”

With four great Gods of Creation to apprehend Huang Xiaolong, Huang Sheng was confident that they couldn’t fail. The old dragon would definitely hand over the kid.

All four of them were in the grand completion stage, and the Excessive Darkness Old Ancestor was at the peak of the grand completion stage. They wouldn’t be afraid of the old dragon even if things got sour!

“Old Ancestor, what if the old dragon refuses?” Huang Dinghai asked.

Narrowing his eyes, Huang Sheng snorted, “If he refuses, tell him I’ll personally lead the troops over! I’ll exterminate his celestial empire down to the last dog!”

“Let’s see who he chooses to protect!”

Huang Sheng’s voice boomed in the hall.

“Yes, Old Ancestor!” Huang Dinghai bowed respectfully.

A moment later, he left the hall and met up with the four great Gods of Creation. They brought the troops of the True Dragon Celestial Empire over to the Blazing Dragon World.

In the main hall of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, the old dragon stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

He could tell that the kid had already broken through to the God of Creation Realm, and it came as a surprise.

“Little brat, you finally broke through!” the old dragon grabbed Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders and gasped.

In the years that Huang Xiaolong had been absent, he had been hoping day and night for the day to come.

Initially, he thought that Huang Xiaolong would only break through after thirty million years. It was a lot earlier than expected.

“But you shouldn’t have returned…” The old dragon’s expression sank. “Huang Sheng has already laid down countless spies around the Blazing Dragon World. He will definitely discover your presence!”

Huang Xiaolong knew what the old dragon was worried about, and he chuckled, “When else should I have appeared?”

A frown formed on the old dragon’s face, and he slapped Huang Xiaolong on the head. “How are you still in the mood to joke around? At the very least, you should be in the large completion realm before coming back.”

“When you enter the large completion stage, you won't be afraid of Huang Sheng any longer!”

“Hurry up and leave!”

The old dragon couldn’t help but sigh.

Pushing the old dragon out of the hall, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “I didn’t come back alone.”

The old dragon stared at him in shock.

However, a possibility soon flashed through his mind.

“I returned with my other master, Pangu,” Huang Xiaolong explained. “In order not to alert Huang Sheng, he hid in the cracks of space.”

A flash of joy crossed the old dragon’s heart. However, he shook his head slowly. “Huang Sheng has a ton of subordinates in the God of Creation Realm. Even if I join hands with Pangu, we won’t be able to deal with him.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Master, you can rest assured. Since I dared to return, I have my way to deal with Huang Sheng.”

The old dragon looked at Huang Xiaolong as he raised an eyebrow in surprise. He didn’t understand where he got his confidence from.

“Huang Sheng’s power has been growing exponentially. His subordinates gathered tons of universe-level treasures for him, and his speed of absorption increased. I’m afraid he will only need three hundred million years to surpass the God of Creation Realm!” the old dragon suppressed his doubt and explained.

“Three hundred million years?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart skipped a beat.

Even though he had already entered the God of Creation Realm, he needed a lot of time if he wanted to reach the large completion realm. Three hundred million years were too short.

Not many experts were able to accumulate so much grand cosmos energy so quickly.

“Yes.” The old dragon sighed.

To a God of Creation, three hundred million years was a short amount of time. It was enough for a period of seclusion.

All of a sudden, Di Cangtian entered the hall and panicked, “Old ancestor, Huang Dinghai is here with the Excessive Darkness Old Ancestor, Extreme Bliss Old Ancestor, Great Myriad Old Ancestor, and the Buddhist Yang Old Ancestor!”

The old dragon’s expression sank when he heard their names.

“Huang Dinghai and the others are demanding that you hand Huang Xiaolong over.” Di Cangtian stuttered, “They have already sealed off the entire space!”

The old dragon turned to Huang Xiaolong and sighed, “I’ll kill our way out. Get Pangu to escort you away.”

Di Cangtian hesitated for a moment, but he quickly continued, “Huang Dinghai said that if you refuse to hand Huang Xiaolong over, Huang Sheng will personally lead his army over to exterminate our celestial empire!”

“According to them, you will have to choose between the empire and Huang Xiaolong!”

The old dragon’s expression turned ugly to the extreme. Killing intent flashed through his eyes, and everyone could tell that murder was on his mind.

Very quickly, the old dragon formed another plan. “Alright. I’ll hold them back and you can grab Huang Dinghai as your hostage before leaving.”

Di Cangtian’s face changed. “Old Ancestor, wouldn’t that mean that the empire…”

“Do you think that things will end once we hand Xiaolong over? He will definitely move against us in the future!” The old dragon roared, “Xiaolong is our only hope! As long as he escapes he will be able to avenge us!”

Di Cangtian started to turn serious, and he nodded silently.

Huang Xiaolong left the hall with the old dragon behind him.

Huang Dinghai revealed a smile, and he chuckled in amusement when he saw Huang Xiaolong, “It’s been several million years, Huang Xiaolong. You’ve been in hiding for a long time.”

“Are you finally planning to take it like a man?”

The four Gods of Creation locked onto Huang Xiaolong instantly.
