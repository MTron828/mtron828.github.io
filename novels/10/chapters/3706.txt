Chapter 3707: Meeting Pangu Again

The Ghost Devil King stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

He might not have a physical body, but that didn’t affect his strength. His strength was said to be unmatched. Only the Ferocious Devil had the ability to force him back! How can Huang Xiaolong be as strong as the Ferocious Devil?!

When he was still stuck in a state of shock, flames covered Huang Xiaolong’s body as he summoned the four Universe Origin Fires. The blood qi at the end of the Naihe Bridge was incinerated in an instant.

With the power of the Universe Origin Fires, the Ghost Devil King retreated once again. However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t let up as he appeared before the Ghost Devil King before stabbing out with the Three Gods Halberd.

This time, he circulated the Universe Transformation Art. As grand cosmos energy gushed out from his body, the Three Gods Halbers seemed to transform into a streak of light as it shot straight for the Ghost Devil King’s chest.

The Blood Axe in the Ghost Devil King’s hand slammed into the Three Gods Halberd. Even though he managed to stop the halberd, he was sent flying as the axe soared through the skies to land in some random place.

With the power of the Universe Transformation Art, Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy became stronger by nearly forty percent! There was no way the Ghost Devil King who hadn’t broken through the 29 billion units mark could stop him!

After he sent the Ghost Devil King flying, Huang Xiaolong appeared above his head with no hesitation. He was in a rush to head over to the Universe First Race, and he didn’t wish to waste any more time.

Right before he could say anything, the Ghost Devil King turned into a puff of black gas and flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s body. His speed was shockingly fast, and he was about to fuse with Huang Xiaolong before the man could react.

The Blood Tentacle King was able to control others by controlling their dao souls and dao heart. The Ghost Devil King possessed an ability stronger than that! Even the Ferocious Devil would be hard-pressed to chase the Ghost Devil King out of his body if he succeeded.

The instant the Ghost Devil King was about to invade Huang Xiaolong’s body, the Universe Origin Fires activated. It turned into a world of fire and protected Huang Xiaolong’s body from any sinister attacks.

A miserable scream came from the lips of the Ghost Devil King.

There was nearly no flame in the universes that could hurt an existence at his level, but it was too bad he was up against the Universe Origin Fires!

It was a perfect counter to existences like himself!

Half a day later…

Huang Xiaolong subdued the Ghost Devil King without much fanfare.

The Ghost Devil King could have escaped after turning into the black smog. Not even the Ferocious Devil could trap him there if he wanted to leave. However, Huang Xiaolong had both the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the four Universe Origin Fires. With the combination, he managed to stop the Ghost Devil King from running.

Kneeling before Huang Xiaolong, the Ghost Devil King presented the Blood Axe to Huang Xiaolong.

Finally, he gathered eleven universe treasures.

Now, there were only those in the hands of the Universe First Race.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain in the Netherworld after he was done. With the six monster kings following behind him, he ran straight for the Universe First Race.

Along the way, he entered the third layer of restrictions of the Universe Boat and refined the Blood Axe.

As for the Crow Devil Spear and the Ghost Staff, he had long since refined them when he traveled to the Netherworld.

Several months later, he left the Unknown Space.

The Universe First Race lived in a place called the Universe Vault.

It was the highest location in the Thirteen Universes.

Even with the speed of his Universe Boat, he needed countless years in order to arrive.

Huang Xiaolong remained in the formation as he tried to comprehend the mysteries of the Thirteen Universes from the Nameless Devil Mirror.

Even though he was no longer able to convert universe source qi, he could still use the source energy that was in the universe. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was much faster than the Ferocious Devil.

Several years later…

As he approached the Universe Vault, Huang Xiaolong kept the Universe Boat away and hid his aura completely. His facial muscles started to constrict and his appearance changed. Huang Xiaolong ensured that not even the Golden Cymbals King would recognize him before stopping.

Soon after, he started to imitate the aura given off by the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Cymbals King.

The Universe First Race gave off a different aura. Even their bodies were different from those of ancient races. As such, he needed to disguise himself completely.

However hard he tried, he could only imitate ninety percent of their aura.

He eventually gave up trying.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It might only be ninety percent, but not even God of Creation Realm experts in the Universe First Race would be able to tell that he wasn’t one of them.

After entering the Universe Vault, Huang Xiaolong grabbed several God of Creation Realm experts, and he experimented with changing his aura to become like them.

When he was finally done, he flew deeper into the Universe Vault.

Experts of the Universe First Race stood guard near the entrance of the region. Entering would be a serious problem. They might not notice that Huang Xiaolong was not part of them, but existences who guarded the stronghold of a race like that would be existences at the level of Gui Chi or Jian Wushuang. He wouldn’t be able to hide his tracks the moment they saw a new face like him.

When he thought of a way to enter the Universe Vault, his eyes drifted over and caught sight of a massive ship flying towards the entrance. From the looks of it, it was a ship that belonged to the Universe First Race.

He didn’t think anymore as he flew towards the ship. Breaking through the restrictions as though they weren’t there, to begin with, Huang Xiaolong hid on the ship.

“This batch of slaves are pretty good… Lord Yin Xue will definitely be satisfied with them!” A voice came from inside the shop.

“I wonder if the rumors of Lord Yin Xue’s special habits are true…”

“We’re not allowed to talk about that!”

Huang Xiaolong pretty much guessed what was going on after hearing their conversation. There was a batch of experts from the Thirteen Universes trapped in the ship as slaves.

They should be for someone called Yin Xue of the Universe First Race.

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong entered the place where the prisoners were kept. He discovered that there were more than a hundred experts on the ship, and several of them were at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked to see Pangu among them.

“Master!”

Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, shock filled Pangu’s heart as he muttered, “Xiao… Xiaolong?!”
