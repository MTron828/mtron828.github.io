Chapter 3623 – Jade Whale Race

“Three Gods Halberd!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

He might have the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires, he was missing an offensive treasure!

Now, Huang Xiaolong was no longer interested in top-tier creation artifacts or pseudo universe treasures.

The Three Gods Halberd was something Huang Xiaolong had his eyes on since learning of its power.

“Do you know the exact location of the weapon?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Shaking his head, Zhou Chi sighed, “The Three Gods Halberd has its own spirituality. It’s able to hide itself in the endless sea. From what we uncovered, the halberd might be in the vicinity of the Bewilderment Island.

“Bewilderment Island?!” A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

…

The Bewilderment Island was the most mysterious region in the Sleepless Sea and it was one of the ten most secretive areas in the Limitless Land.

No matter who it was, they would enter a land of illusion the moment they entered the island. Those with extremely strong willpower might be able to emerge after several years, but those who were weaker might be trapped for billions of years! There were at least ten thousand God of Creation Realm experts who tried to explore the island and more than three thousand of them had yet to emerge! There were even half step Universe Gods who had lost themselves within the island!

As such, the Bewilderment Island was a troublesome place…

Huang Xiaolong was confident in his strength, but he wasn’t certain that his willpower and dao heart was as sturdy as half step Universe Gods.

Since a long time ago, Huang Xiaolong increased his strength by devouring the bloodline of other experts. The time he cultivated was too short compared to the top experts in the Limitless Land and he had to admit that he experienced far less compared to half step Universe Gods.

Whatever the case, he knew that he had to enter the island since the Three Gods Halberd made its appearance.

As the Bewilderment Island was located in the Sleepless Sea, Huang Xiaolong wanted to take the chance to look for universe-level spiritual veins. Even if he failed to obtain the halberd in the end, he would be able to get something out of it.

…

“Lord, that’s right.” Zhou Chi replied.

“Did the Limitless Master head over?” Another question left Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

With his dao souls, he quickly discovered that the Limitless Master wasn’t in the city.

“What?! The Limitless Master has already left?!” Zhou Chi and the other two exclaimed. It was obvious that they didn’t discover the departure of the man.

After all, the Limitless Master was much stronger than either three of them. It wasn’t surprising that they couldn’t feel his presence.

“I’ll enter the Sleepless Sea tomorrow.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“Should we head over with you?” Lin Qiankun asked.

“No. The fewer people the better. The Bewilderment Island is nowhere to mess around. I’ll go alone. You three can remain here to see if the Limitless Master returns.”

When he emerged from the Bewilderment Island, he would decide whether or not to subdue the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race.

When that happened, he would unify the Limitless Land!

The Limitless Master might be said to be the master of the Limitless Land, but he hadn’t unified the region. If Huang Xiaolong gained control over the Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race, he would be able to create a sturdy foundation for himself in the Unknown Space!

Zhou Chi and the other two bowed respectfully.

The very next day, Huang Xiaolong left the city alone.

As soon as he couldn’t be seen, he charged straight towards the Sleepless Sea.

The Sleepless Sea was in the easternmost part of the Limitless Land and he took three months to arrive. If one were to cross the Limitless Sea, they would be close to the Zhu Lan, Jin Xing, and One Essence Land.

Standing above the Sleepless Sea, Huang Xiaolong saw faint rays of jade light covering the ocean. The surface of the Sleepless Sea was still, but the calmer it was, the more mysterious it seemed.

Tearing through the surface of the Sleepless Sea, Huang Xiaolong entered its endless depths.

As soon as he did, Huang Xiaolong felt a cool sensation covering his entire body. He felt a weird energy contained in every drop of water. Due to the influence of the weird energy, those who weren’t of the Ocean Race would have their strength slightly limited.

Of course, members of the Ocean Race would be assisted by the mysterious energy.

It was no wonder the Limitless Master wouldn’t be able to do a thing to the king of the Ocean Race in the Sleepless Sea!

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to arrive in the largest city in the Sleepless Sea. The structures were vastly different from the cities in the human world as all the materials used were found deep in the ocean. Corals and chunks of reef were used all along the street. No matter how Huang Xiaolong looked at it, he found it a little strange.

Of course, spiritual rock and essence ores found at the bottom of the ocean was used in most of the builds. Manors and palaces found in the underwater ocean didn’t lose out to those in mega cities above the surface.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother staying as he made his way towards the Bewilderment Island immediately.

The Sleepless Sea might not be as large as the main continent of the Limitless Land, but it was nearly three quarters as large. As such, Huang Xiaolong needed some time if he wished to arrive at the Bewilderment Island.

Huang Xiaolong chose to avoid most of the islands as he traveled in the Universe Boat. In a little more than a month, he arrived in the vicinity of the island.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Universe Boat before heading into a nearby city.

“Jade Whale City!” The Jade Whale City belonged to the Jade Whale Race and they were the most ancient race in the Sleepless Sea. They were one of the strongest races present and their patriarch was the second strongest expert in the region! Only the king of the Ocean Race was able to suppress the Jade Whale Patriarch! Their position in the Sleepless Sea was akin to the Cao Family in the Limitless Land!

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Jade Whale Race could cause the Sleepless Sea to tremble with a stomp of their feet!

After crossing the Jade Whale Race’s territory, Huang Xiaolong would be able to arrive on the island in three to four days!

When he tried to enter the city, he noticed that the security in the area was extremely tight. Everyone who wished to enter was forced into a round of stringent checks.

“Do they do this normally?” One of the merchants trying to enter the city asked an expert beside him.

“Nope. I’ve heard that someone went on a rampage in the city recently, killing a lot of disciples from the Jade Whale Race. That’s the reason behind the increased security.” Someone else said.

“Are they crazy?! Who would kill members of the Jade Whale Race?! Are they tired of living?!” Someone exclaimed in shock.

“No sh*t! It’s said that the members of the Wei Ghost Race did it.”

“Wei Ghost Race?!”

Those who heard the name of the culprits felt their expressions changing.

The Wei Ghost Race might not be the most ancient race in the Sleepless Sea, but they were close. They were one of the oldest races and they were part of the ten strongest races among the Ocean Race! Their grudge with the Jade Whale Race went way back. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When Huang Xiaolong was about to be checked, he casually retrieved Jin Hai’s golden plaque. They allowed him to enter after ensuring that it represented the God of Creation, Jin Hai, of the Human Race.

As the Human Race and Ocean Race were no longer at war, their relationship could be said to have recovered to a certain extent. The disciples from either side would definitely respect great beings from the opposing race.
