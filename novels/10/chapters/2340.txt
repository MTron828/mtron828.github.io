Chapter 2341: Heavenly MonarChapter Realm Slaves

Huang Xiaolong practiced the Eight Desolate Holy Palm, Final Boundless Sword Art, and Thousand Armed Holy Devil for several hours before stopping.

He looked at the sky that had begun to darken and muttered, “Why hasn’t Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and the others returned?”

A frown creased his smooth forehead.

......

The Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse.

After Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi had walked around the city for a full day, they stepped into the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse. The three chose a table next to the window. They ordered tea as well as various types of snacks.

Not long after Feng Tianyu’s group of three sat down, the Beast Tamer Holy Prince Yu Fujiang was striding towards the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse with several other Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Princes.

His injuries had completely healed after consuming the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s level-ten healing origin spiritual Taiji Pill, in addition to his master, True Saint Shen Jiewen’s, and others’ efforts.

In truth, although Du Zhenjun had left him half-dead, his strike was well-measured, or Yu Fujiang couldn’t have healed so quickly.

“Eldest Senior Brother, rest assured. The Patriarch has ordered Junior Brother Liang Qin, to trash Huang Xiaolong until he’s begging for mercy on his knees to vent your anger.” A Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Prince, Chen Chunlai comforted.

At the mention of Huang Xiaolong, Yu Fujiang’s aura was filled with sharpness, and cruel glints flashed across his eyes, “It’s a pity I could not represent the Holy Lands Alliance to participate, as I would like nothing better to make him kneel before me in public!”

He current cultivation was at the peak Ninth Tribulation Half-True Saint Realm, and according to the rules determined by the Clear Snow Palace and Holy Lands Alliance, all participating disciples’ cultivation needed to be at the same or lower level than Huang Xiaolong.

Therefore, he could not participate.

Another Holy Prince, Xu Dan chimed in, “Why don’t we ask Junior Brother Liang Qian to be a little more brutal, and leave Huang Xiaolong half a life? If Eldest Senior Brother exhorts Junior Brother Liang Qian, he won’t dare to refuse.”

After hearing that, Yu Fujiang hesitated briefly, but he recalled the humiliating scene where Du Zhenjun had buried him into the ground with a slap, and he nodded, “When we get back, I’ll meet with Junior Brother Liang Qin.”

The group entered the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse as they talked.

A moment later, Yu Fujiang frowned in displeasure as he looked around, “So many people!”

When Feng Tianyu’s group had arrived, there were still a few empty tables, but in a short while, all the tables were already filled.

“Eldest Senior Brother, the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse have private rooms. Maybe there are one or two empty rooms.” Chen Chunlai suggested.

Yi Fujiang nodded his head, agreeing to the suggestion. A waiter was called over. However, the waiter told them that all private rooms were occupied. When Yu Fujiang heard that no private rooms were available, he was extremely annoyed.

Was his trip going to be in vain?

He was quite obsessed with the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse’s Heavenly Fragrance Tea. In the past, every time he had come to the Holy Heavens’ City, he had spent a good deal of time in the teahouse, enjoying tea.

“Several Lords, mind you wait for a moment, maybe, some guests would be leaving soon.” The waiter encouraged politely.

“Eldest Senior Brother, look over there! There are actually Heavenly Monarch Realm slaves drinking tea here in the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse!” Suddenly, Chen Chunlai pointed at a table close to the window. Yu Fujiang and the others turned to look in the direction Chen Chunlai’s finger was pointing at.

More accurately, Yu Fujiang’s group was looking at Zhang Wenyue and Xue Qi. These two women’s cultivation was at Heavenly Monarch Realm.

He saw that these two Heavenly Monarch Realm slaves occupied a table in the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse, and enjoyed tea while chatting and laughing. But on the other hand, he, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Prince, the chief disciple, had to stand and wait for others to leave before he could get a table. As he realized this, anger erupted in Yu Fujiang’s chest.

Yu Fujaing pointed at the table Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi were at, and he almost snapped at the waiter, “The Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse admits Heavenly Monarch Realm slaves nowadays?”

The waiter smiled bitterly and said, “Lord, our Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse does not have any rules that prohibit Heavenly Monarch Realm cultivators from enjoying tea here.”

This time, Holy Prince Xu Dan cut in, “Do you know who we are? We are Holy Princes of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and he is the chief disciple of our Beast Tamer Holy Gate, Eldest Senior Brother Yu Fujiang. These two Heavenly Monarch Realm slaves have a place to sit while we have to stand and wait?”

The waiter was jarred to his core, hearing that this group of young masters were actually the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Princes. On top of that, even the chief disciple Holy Prince Yu Fujiang was here.

“Go, drive away those Heavenly Monarch Realm slaves.” Holy Prince Xu Dan ordered.

But the waiter showed a troubled face at Xu Dan’s order and replied cautiously, “Your Highnesses, our teahouse’s rule is that as long as the guests do not leave voluntarily, we cannot force them out from the establishment. Your Highnesses, thank you for your consideration.”

“You!” Xu Dan was infuriated.

“Alright, in that case, we will ‘invite’ them to leave. This works, right?” Yu Fujiang asked. He knew that the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse had a strong backing. Thus he did not want to cause a commotion here.

The waiter struggled internally before mustering an answer, “Yes, but the point is that they will have to leave willingly. Your Highnesses cannot force them.”

Yu Fujiang nodded his head, indicating that he understood, and then strode towards Feng Tianyu’s table with the rest.

Yu Fujiang did not waste time with any nonsense when he reached Feng Tianyu’s table. He took out a holy spiritual jadestone and threw it onto the table with a sentence, “You can have this holy spiritual jadestone. I want this table, so you three can leave now.”

The moment the holy spiritual jadestone appeared, rich holy spiritual aura filled the teahouse, attracting the attention of guests at other tables.

“It’s grade three holy spiritual jadestone!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The guests all around exclaimed in surprised whispers.

Holy spiritual jadestones were graded differently, and grade-three holy spiritual jadestone was already a good grade. For example, the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground’s Jiang Family would definitely hide the grade-three holy spiritual jadestone in the deepest part of the treasury.

Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi were completely dumbfounded by the situation.

Feng Tianyu reacted the fastest. He smiled and said, “I say, this brother, please take back your holy spiritual jadestone. How about this? There are only the three of us, and there is plenty of space still. If you don’t mind, we can share the table. What do you think?”

Feng Tianyu’s intention was to avoid any trouble if he could, and he didn’t mind sharing the table since there were only five people in the other group. There was enough space to fit them.

Hearing Feng Tianyu’s suggestion, Chen Chunlai jumped out and scoffed, “Sit with us? What is your identity, and what are our identities, don’t tell me that you are qualified to sit with us with your lowly status? What a joke! Let me tell you, we are Holy Princes from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and this, here is our Eldest Senior Brother Yu Fujiang. So, if you know what’s good for you, take the holy spiritual jadestone and scram far away!”

Both Zhang Wenyue and Xue Qi were flaring with anger at Chen Chunlai’s words. This group of people not only were unappreciative of their offer, but they had turned around and mocked them, saying that they were not qualified to sit at the same table with them.

Feng Tianyu’s expression darkened the moment he heard Chen Chunlai state that they were from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and the person who had thrown the holy spiritual jadestone was Yu Fujiang. He had heard about Yu Fujiang from Huang Xiaolong the previous day.

“Since we are not qualified to share the same table, please take back your holy spiritual jadestone and leave us!” Feng Tianyu said with a frosty expression. “We will not yield this table to you, and we are no longer interested in sharing a table with you!”

“What!” The several Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Princes snapped, and their brows furrowed, exuding an overwhelming pressure.
