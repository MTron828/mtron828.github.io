Chapter 3112: Turtle In an Urn

In the World Master’s Manor…

Xiao Yuncheng, Xuan Kong, and the four marshals stood at the front of the hall while all the senior commanders and commanders lined the walls.

The atmosphere was extremely oppressive, and no one dared to breathe loudly.

The rumors of the death beast invasion placed everyone on edge, and many patriarchs led their disciples out of the Origin Heavenly Cave. The World Master’s Manor wasn’t panicking as much, but they were close.

All of them knew that the invasion wasn’t a joke, and if they were even a little careless, the World Master’s Manor might be completely destroyed!

“Have we recalled all our troops?” Xiao Yuncheng asked Yang Yuyuan and the other marshals.

“Every single one of them has been called back, but they will only be able to arrive after several days,” Jiang Meng and the others replied respectfully.

Xuan Kong hesitated for a moment, and he muttered, “Only four hundred region lords brought their troops over to reinforce us.”

Xiao Yuncheng’s expression changed. The Origin Holy World had countless regions, and there were tons of region lords. Yet, only four hundred of them came over with their army to reinforce the World Master’s Manor! That was less than one ten-thousandth of the power the Origin Holy World had, and even though the number of experts they had weren’t considered little, they were nothing more than a slightly larger grain of sand in the eyes of the Death Beast Army.

“Your Highness, should we just retreat?” Yang Yuyuan growled.

Shaking his head, a look of determination appeared on Xiao Yuncheng’s face. “We will never retreat.”

How could the World Master’s Manor abandon their home ground?! Even if they had to die, they would die with their pride intact!

“Lord Father is rushing back as we speak. He should be back in half a month at most.” Xiao Yuncheng sighed.

Everyone was taken aback by the news, but their hearts soon sank. Nine beast kings were working together, and even if the World Master returned, he wouldn’t be able to change the outcome of the battle!

“Their goal is to take down the Myriad Formation Devil. As long as the old devil leaves the Origin Holy World, the Death Beast Army won't go all out and invade the Origin Heavenly Cave,” Jiang Meng said all of a sudden.

“That’s right! As long as the Myriad Formation Devil leaves, the crisis will be lifted!” Murong Xiang nodded.

Xiao Yuncheng shook his head slowly. Any idiot would know that that was the case, but who had the guts to chase the old devil out of the Origin Heavenly Cave?! No… It was more suitable to ask the question, ‘who had the power to chase the old devil away’?

Even if his father personally moved, he wouldn’t be able to chase the old devil away for sure! Not to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong was standing behind the old devil! That was a madman who dared to antagonize the Mystical Pavilion, and he had the power to back himself up!

“I wonder what Lord Huang thinks about this matter…” Xuan Kong turned to look in the direction of the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce. Everyone’s heart would jump whenever they thought about the crazy man called Huang Xiaolong.

“I’ve already contacted the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable. However, he said that Lord Huang has been in seclusion this whole time. His instructions were to not disturb Lord Huang unless the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion arrives.”

Everyone felt their hearts trembling.

Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong didn’t see anyone else as his opponent?! Was the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion the only one who had the ability to cause him to be serious?

“With the advent of the nine beast kings, the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable should make the report, right?” Yang Yuyuan asked.

“Even if Huang Xiaolong leaves seclusion, he wouldn’t be a match for all nine of them.” Jiang Meng sighed.

Everyone felt their hearts sinking once again.

“I’m afraid the Mystical Pavilion is the one behind the news of He Zhen’s identity leak.” Xuan Kong sighed.

The only ones who had the guts to leak He Zhen’s identity were the members of the Mystical Pavilion.

Moreover, they were the only ones with the ability to uncover his identity. Even Xiao Yuncheng and the others couldn’t be one hundred percent sure that was the old devil himself.

When everyone in the Origin Heavenly Cave were fearing for their lives, the last of the genesis lightning water around Huang Xiaolong disappeared in the Sun Moon Furnace. Flashes of purple light swept out from his body, and when they reached their peak, they started to dissipate. Bolts of lightning hovered around him as they emitted dense lightning qi.

The lightning qi were like flowers blooming in summer. It filled the entire furnace, and the space turned into a world of lightning. The lightning qi contained a huge amount of power, and it occasionally turned into raging hurricanes that had the ability to tear worlds apart.

After a long time, it turned into puddles of lightning water.

The puddles combined to form a small river, and every single drop of lightning water glistened like pearls.

The tiny river shone a jade-like purple, and it eventually turned into a large river. As it rolled about the space around the furnace, spatial cracks formed.

Every drop of lightning water contained the power to destroy a star, and it was strong enough to suppress an expert on the Extermination List.

They expanded slowly, and every drop turned into a genesis-level lightning beast.

As the beasts raised their heads to the skies, they unleashed a feral roar that caused the heavens to tremble. If any expert from the Extermination List were to see the scene right now, they wouldn’t believe that the genesis-level lightning beasts were creatures with no sentience.

Several months passed once again.

The Death Beast Army gathered outside the Origin Heavenly Cave, and they were so closely packed that not even a single drop of water would be able to get past them.

No one knew how many death beasts there were, but they came from dozens of regions around the Origin Heavenly Cave. They completely demolished the surrounding regions around the Origin Heavenly Cave, and they were the only living beings left!

As death beasts continued to gather in the area, the number kept on increasing.

Even though they hadn’t invaded the Origin Heavenly Cave, the experts trapped inside the region felt the weight of a mountain pressing down on their hearts. Based on the auras of the death beasts outside the region, the experts located inside felt the hopes in their hearts vanishing.

Goosebumps filled their bodies, and even the patriarchs of the top ten creeds felt fear in their hearts.

Countless experts on the Extermination List opened their dao eyes to look at the situation outside the Heavenly Cave, but their view was obstructed the moment it left the region.

The faces of everyone changed.

“This isn’t good. The Death Beast Army has arranged a lot of formations outside the Origin Heavenly Cave. We’re like turtles trapped in an urn right now!”

No one would have expected for the Death Beast Army to be so adamant about getting the Myriad Formation Devil. One had to know that a lot of resources needed to be wasted if they wanted to surround the entire Origin Heavenly Cave with formations!

The Death Beast Army was actually crazy enough to do it!

Fear and terror filled the hearts of everyone in the Origin Heavenly Cave when they realized the Death Beast Army’s determination.
