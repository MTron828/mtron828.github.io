Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed slightly as he could sense that Tie Qianyuan was refusing to tell the truth, but he decided to not pursue the matter any further. He turned to the little cow instead, and asked, “Xiaoniu, do you have a solution?” He was referring to Tie Qianyuan’s injuries.

With Huang Xiaolong’s eyesight, Tie Qianyuan’s shattered internal organs, and his cracked godhead hadn’t escaped his notice, and he could tell that Tie Qianyuan wasn’t going to last more than four days.

Huang Xiaolong could heal Tie Qianyuan’s shattered internal organs and other injuries, however, he was powerless to deal with a cracked godhead.

The little cow said solemnly, “I have a technique, but it would take several days, and it would be very tiring.”

Would be very tiring?

Huang Xiaolong choked, then promised, “You can have as many godheads as you want.”

The little cow’s face split into a wide grin, and agreed decisively, “As long as I have your word.”

The little cow smiled treacherously, giving Huang Xiaolong a feeling of being a sheep who had wandered into a circle of a wolf pack.

Tie Xinlan, Tie Mu, and Tie Qianyuan were baffled listening to Huang Xiaolong, and the little cow’s conversations.

What solution? What’s tiring?

“Big brother Huang, you two are...?” Tie Xinlan was in the middle of asking a question, when she was interrupted by Huang Xiaolong, “Go find a room, Xiaoniu will help Fort Lord Tie to heal his injuries.”

Tie Xinlan, Tie Mu, and Tie Qianyuan were all dazed.

Heal injuries...?

“Young, Young Warrior Huang, you-you’re saying, m-my injuries can still be healed?!” Tie Qianyuan couldn’t believe his ears.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “Since Xiaoniu says she can heal you, I believe her.”

Xiaoniu?

Tie Qianyuan, Tie Xinlan, and Tie Mu’s gazes were fixed on the little cow Xiaoniu with doubt.

They couldn’t be blamed for being dubious, as they had never heard of anyone who could heal a cracked godhead, not to mention that ‘anyone’ was a cow! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Big brother, this...!” Tie Mu wanted to ask more, but Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and said, “Go and arrange a room immediately.”

Tie Mu was at a loss. In the end, he hurried to prepare a room, and then watched the little cow bringing his father into the room. Looking at the closed door, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu had a surreal feeling.

Huang Xiaolong took a seat inside a small side-hall, then asked the siblings about what had happened.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu exchanged a glance, but neither of them spoke.

“Since neither of you believes in me, forget it.” Huang Xiaolong said to both of them.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, the two hastily shook their heads in denial.

“No, Big brother Huang, it’s not like that. The other side’s more powerful than us, and we’re afraid we might bring you trouble.” Tie Xinlan explained. “We didn’t tell you because we don’t want to implicate you.”

Even though both of them knew that their father and the Green Sun City’s He Family, Su Family, Deng Family, and Zhuang Family were Huang Xiaolong’s lieges, this amount of force was meager against Prince Chen.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Ying, Feng Er, and the others had strange expressions on their faces as Tie Xinlan claimed that the other side was a powerful force. What force in the Vientiane World was more powerful than Huang Xiaolong?

Then, they realized that Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were ignorant of Huang Xiaolong’s current identity.

Huang Xiaolong smiled comfortingly and reassured them, “I’m not afraid of provoking trouble. I have some influence in Green Cloud Island now, so tell me, and let me see if I can resolve it for you.”

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were surprised by Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Tie Mu exclaimed optimistically, “Big brother Huang, did a Barbarian God Sect’s Elder or Grand Elder accept you as his personal disciple?”

Since Huang Xiaolong had said that he had some influence in Green Cloud Island, the siblings thought that a Barbarian God Sect’s Elder or Grand Elder had accepted Huang Xiaolong as his personal disciple. The identity of a Barbarian God Sect’s Elder or Grand Elder’s personal disciple was akin to a nobility for them.

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others couldn’t contain their laughter at Tie Mu’s silly question.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu both looked at them, and Tie Mu scratched his head in confusion. He felt embarrassed as he asked, “Could it be, Big brother Huang is merely a Barbarian God Sect Elder’s disciple in name only? I thought Big brother Huang would be a personal disciple, I’ve made a joke of myself.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled sincerely and waved his hand to reassure Tie Mu. “No, you’re right, a Barbarian God Sect Grand Elder accepted me as his personal disciple.” He could only say so, in order for Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu to feel at ease.

Had he said that the entire Barbarian God Sect belonged to him, Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu wouldn’t have been able to believe it.

A rush of joy rose to Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu’s faces hearing this..

“Big brother Huang has really been accepted as a personal disciple by a Barbarian God Sect’s Grand Elder!” Tie Xinlan was sincerely happy for Huang Xiaolong.

“Okay, now, can you two tell me what’s the matter?” Huang Xiaolong smiled and asked.

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu nodded heavily, full of trust.

“Some days back, Father took both of us shopping in the capital city. We and that Prince Chen wanted the same demonic beast egg. At first, we didn’t know that he was Prince Chen, and a conflict ensued between us because of the demonic beast egg. Later on, his subordinate attacked us... and Father... in order to protect us... thus...” Tie Xinlan’s eyes were red-rimmed as she recalled the event in a broken sentence.

Everyone could guess what had happened after that—Tie Qianyuan must have gotten injured by Prince Chen’s subordinate when protecting the siblings.

“We saw that demonic beast egg first.” Tie Mu claimed angrily, “It’s Prince Chen who was being unreasonable!”

Tie Xinlan went on with teary eyes, “Though Father managed to escape with us, I’m afraid Prince Chen would soon find us here, using his power and influence. Moreover, we’ve heard that Prince Chen has some connections with some of the Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciples, so even if we flee to the neighboring countries, we won’t be able to escape!”

So, that’s what happened.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in question. “Prince Chen?”

“He is a prince of our country, though his talent is not high, and his individual strength is only so-so, the issue is, the Emperor likes him very much. He also friends with various forces’ experts, and extremely lecherous by nature!” Tie Mu gritted his teeth in anger as he added, “He even wants my sister to be his maid!”

Right at this time, a Tie Family Fort’s disciple ran in flustered, panting heavily as he reported, “Miss, Young Lord, that Prince Chen is outside, he has brought people and surrounded our Tie Family Fort!”

Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu paled and panicked.

But Huang Xiaolong turned to Xiang Xun and the rest, saying nonchalantly, “Let’s go out, Gui Yi, Gui Er, both of you stay guard here, and don’t let anyone disturb Xiaoniu.”

“Yes, manor Lord.” Gui Yi and Gui Er adhered respectfully.

Manor Lord? Though Tie Xinlan and Tie Mu were baffled as to why Gui Yi and Gui Er would call Huang Xiaolong as Manor Lord, they didn’t think too deeply about it. At that moment they were more worried about Prince Chen, and if he would spare them after becoming aware of Huang Xiaolong’s identity as Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple? And if he would spare the Tie Family Fort?

The siblings followed as Huang Xiaolong’s group headed to the Tie Family Fort’s entrance.

“Big brother Huang, if Prince Chen still won’t spare us even after knowing your identity, what do we do then?” Tie Xinlan couldn’t help asking Huang Xiaolong this burning question that was bothering her.

Her question caught Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and the others by surprise.

“He would.” Huang Xiaolong smiled meaningfully.
