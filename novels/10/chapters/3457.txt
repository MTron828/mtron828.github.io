Chapter 3458: Seems to have Surrendered

Yang Han had no idea that Huang Xiaolong, Gu Yuan, and Long Yi had long since detected his presence. He didn’t think too much about his disciple’s request as he felt as though their strength had been exaggerated.

With the number of treasures she promised, he decided to make the trip over.

Easily breaking through the grand formation around the Myriad Star Palace, he entered the area. The formation might be strong, but it was nothing before an expert like him.

The moment he entered the Myriad Star Palace, he felt all his hair standing on end. It was as though he had entered the most dangerous region of a forbidden area.

Yang Han stopped dead in his tracks.

“Who?!” Circulating his grand cosmos energy, he got on high alert.

As the word left his lips, several figures emerged from the main palace.

With a look of suspicion in his eyes, he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

According to Bei Xue’s description, the youngster was his target.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, other than Huang Xiaolong’s handsome appearance, he couldn’t detect the slightest trace of strength coming from the kid.

When he saw the two figures following behind Huang Xiaolong, his pupils constricted.

The feeling he got from them was the same when he met with the Northern Court Celestial Emperor!

No… It seemed as though they were even stronger than the celestial emperor!

How is that possible?!

The Northern Court Celestial Emperor was an expert who had 1.2 billion units of grand cosmos energy. In fact, he had 1.26 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

He completely ignored Li Ting and the others behind Long Yi and Gu Yuan.

When Yang Han was thinking about the identities of Long Yi and Gu Yuan, Huang Xiaolong broke the silence. “Are you the person the fourth princess invited over to obtain the eggs?”

Yang Han’s expression sank when he stared at Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t ask about the eggs. Instead, he asked, “Who are you?”

“Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang Xiaolong?” A frown formed on Yang Han’s face. It was clear that he hadn’t heard his name before, and he started to introduce himself. “I am Yang Han of the Northern Court Celestial Empire.”

“What?! You’re Lord Yang Han?! The Fourth Princess’ master?” Li Ting gasped in fright.

Yang Han’s reputation in the celestial empire was great! He was an expert who had comprehended thirteen elements to the grand completion stage, and he had accumulated 1 billion units of grand cosmos energy! He was also the Fourth Princess’ master!

Even though there were many experts in the Shi Li World who were comparable to him in strength, they weren’t as famous as him!

Yang Han wasn’t surprised by their reaction. However, his gaze didn’t shift from Huang Xiaolong and he continued, “Indeed, I’m here for the eggs. They are extremely important to Bei Xue, and if you’re willing to give them to me, the Northern Court Celestial Empire will be eternally grateful to you. We will be willing to give you treasures in return.”

“Oh? What can you offer me in return?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

How could Huang Xiaolong be unaware of Yang Han’s intentions? He was definitely planning on snatching the eggs when he came. However, he changed his mind after seeing Gu Yuan and Long Yi.

Yang Han stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock, but he soon gave a reply. “We’ll give you a trillion dao coins in return!”

A trillion dao coins!

The price might not be low, but it was definitely far from what the eggs were worth!

Gu Yuan sneered, “A trillion dao coins for two Chaos Essence Dragon Phoenix Eggs… Brat, are you mentally challenged?”

Li Ting and the others felt their legs going soft when they heard what Gu Yuan said.

That was Yang Han, a supreme expert of the Northern Court Celestial Empire with more than a billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Strictly speaking, Long Yi and Gu Yuan were existences who were born during the creation of the universe. It wasn’t wrong for them to address Yang Han as a brat.

However, a trace of anger flashed through his eyes when he heard how they addressed him.

“Hehe, do you expect me to believe that you brought a trillion dao coins with you?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Yang Han shook his head. “No. However, as long as I bring the eggs back, I’ll get someone to bring the dao coins over.”

“Brat, Gu Yuan wasn’t wrong when he said that you were mentally challenged…” Long Yi snorted.

Anger burned in Yang Han’s heart, and he raged, “What do you mean by this?”

“Don’t give me that sh*t. You were planning to snatch the eggs before you came. You only changed your mind when you met us,” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

“Since you’re not sincere at all, I’ll leave right now,” Yang Han muttered after glancing at Gu Yuan and Long Yi.

It was too bad he couldn’t move before a giant fist came crashing down on his head.

As he tumbled through the air, he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Turning to look at his assailant, he was shocked to discover that Long Yi had made the first move.

Li Ting and the others were equally as shocked to see that Yang Han was sent flying with a single punch from Long Yi.

Previously, they had guessed that Long Yi was an expert who had comprehended thirteen elements to the grand completion stage when Shi Potian came. They felt that it would be slightly exaggerated to say that he was an expert who had accumulated 1 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Now, it was clear that they were mistaken.

Is Long Yi an existence close to the God of Creation Realm?!

“Who… Who in the world are you?!” Yang Han roared. Long Yi’s punch revealed his strength, and Yang Han realized that Long Yi was far stronger than the Northern Court Celestial Emperor.

“Who?” Long Yi chuckled. However, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong before he said anything else.

After seeing the slight nod from Huang Xiaolong, a sinister grin appeared on Long Yi’s face as he strolled over to Yang Han. It was as though he had finally found a good prey.

Chills ran down Yang Han’s spine…

Tens of minutes later, Li Ting and the others saw that Yang Han was beaten up so badly that they nearly failed to recognize him.

Huang Xiaolong slowly raised his hand, and he sent a ray of purple light into Yang Han’s body.

Several days later…

In the Northern Court Celestial Empire.

Bei Xue paced up and down as a solemn expression could be seen on her face.

Lu Ting entered the hall, and Bei Xue asked, “Have you received any news on my master?”

Since a few days ago, they had lost all contact with Yang Han.

After a slight hesitation, Lu Ting replied, “Lord Yang Han seems to have been captured by that man…”

“Captured?!” Bei Xue exclaimed in fright.

My master, who has 1 billion units of grand cosmos energy, was captured by the enemy?! Can they be mistaken?!

“Lord Yang Han seems to have submitted to the guy…” Lu Ting whispered.

“That’s not possible!” Bei Xue cried out in disbelief.
