Found me at last? What does that mean? Have these disciples been trying to find him all this while? While these doubts passed through Liu Qin’s mind, the group of disciples reached him.

“Senior Brother Liu Qin!” The disciples called out to Liu Qin enthusiastically.

“...You’ve been looking for me?” Liu Qin looked warily at them as he asked.

“Senior Brother Liu Qin, we ran into Huang Xiaolong!” One of the disciples said hurriedly as if afraid that the credit of relaying this information would be snatched away by someone else.

“What?! Huang Xiaolong!!” Liu Qin was elated, even his voice was several pitches higher as he urged, “Speak, where is Huang Xiaolong? Why didn’t you guys capture him?”

Why didn’t you guys capture him? The disciples looked a little awkward hearing the last question.

One of the disciples hesitated before he ventured, “Senior Brother Liu Qin, we, we’re no match against him. Huang Xiaolong seemed like a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm on the surface, but his real battle power was no less than a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple.”

This disciple hadn’t been able to view Huang Xiaolong’s progress throughout the rankings competition, therefore, he could only estimate Huang Xiaolong’s strength according to the situation they had experienced.

“Rivals a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm!” That was enough to astonish Liu Qin, mostly because it was unexpected.

“It’s true ah, Senior Brother Liu Qin. When we came across him, we were planning to capture him, in order to bring him to you. But it turned out that Huang Xiaolong’s battle power was really strong, and none of us could defeat him, losing to him after thirty moves!” Another disciple chimed in.

Other disciples secretly exchanged a glance but kept mum tactfully.

They knew very well in their hearts that they had lasted way less than thirty moves against Huang Xiaolong.

In truth, if they counted honestly, they couldn’t withstand even one full strike from him.

“Thirty moves.” Hearing that, Liu Qin sneered coldly, “Didn’t expect for that kid to have some tricks up his sleeves.”

The same disciple smiled flatteringly, “Even though this Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength is unexpected, he’s less than dregs in front of Senior Brother Liu Quin. Senior Brother Liu Qin can easily crush him to his death just using his pinky!”

“That’s right, that punk cannot be compared to Senior Brother Liu Qin!” Another disciple joined in, smiling flatteringly.

“Alright, no need to blabber these words of flattery. You guys were looking for me just to tell this to me?” Liu Qin waved his hand impatiently at them.

The disciples’ hearts tightened nervously.

“We were looking for Senior Brother Liu Qin because we have good news to tell Senior Brother Liu Qin!” One of the disciples hastened and explained, “Before Huang Xiaolong left, he gave us his communication talisman!” He paused slightly then added, “He also said... he said...”

Liu Qin’s impatience was swept away, replaced by delight upon hearing Huang Xiaolong had left these disciples his communication talismans. Hearing the disciple’s mumbles, Liu Qin demanded, “What did he say?”

“He said to contact him if we encounter Senior Brother Liu Qin, he wants to challenge Senior Brother Liu Qin!” Another disciple shouted indignantly. “There’s no limit to Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance, he was so brazen as to challenge Senior Brother Liu Qin!”

A cold gleam flickered across Liu Qin’s eyes after hearing that.

Huang Xiaolong! He had actually dared to leave communication talismans in order to challenge him!

What’s with that? Was he discounting him?! A measly Ancestor God Realm punk was actually fantasizing of challenging him! The more Liu Qin thought about it, the angrier he felt.

‘Senior Brother Liu Qin, you think we...?” The Same disciple ventured cautiously after sensing the chilling air and killing intent surging around Liu Qin’s body, the same disciple ventured cautiously.

Liu Qin raised his head and looked at the group of disciples as he said coldly, “Since he has the guts to leave his communication talismans to challenge me, we should definitely fulfill his wish!”

The several disciples hurried to comply while feeling gleeful inwardly.

Huang Xiaolong, it’s time for payback!

The several disciples immediately took out the communication talismans Huang Xiaolong had given them and contacted him.

After the disciples contacted Huang Xiaolong, Liu Qin said to them, “You guys also wait here with me until Huang Xiaolong comes. I’ll let you watch how I’m going to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson!”

The disciples complied respectfully.

Even if Liu Qin wouldn’t have told them to wait, these disciples would have stayed behind anyways to see how Huang Xiaolong would suffer at Liu Qin’s hands.

“Senior Brother Liu Qin, after you defeat Huang Xiaolong, the Fortune Divine Fruits on him... can you?” One of the disciples cautiously asked Liu Qin.

So far, Huang Xiaolong had accumulated over six hundred Fortune Divine Fruits.

Liu Qin generously waved his hand as he said, “Don’t worry, your benefits won’t be discounted. If Huang Xiaolong really dares to show up, I’ll give each of you ten Fortune Divine Fruits after I deal with him!”

Only ten!

The group of disciples was inwardly dissatisfied with Liu Qin’s promise, however, they didn’t dare to show it in front of him. All of them forced a smile as they repeatedly thanked Liu Qin.

Huang Xiaolong received their message. At this time he was above a mountain peak not far from Liu Qin and the disciples’ location.

“Liu Qin.” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath. A moment later, there was a cold sneer on his face as he replied to the disciples, and whistled away in their direction.

Zhao Lei, Gongsun Chi, Xu Wen, Zhang Dong, and the others inside the examination hall were surprised watching Huang Xiaolong flying towards Liu Qin’s location.

“This kid, although his battle power is startling, his cultivation realm is merely at the peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. He’s too far off compared to Liu Qin!” Xu Wen shook his head. “How could he match Liu Qin’s strength!”

Gongsun Chi, Zhang Dong, and the rest also shook their heads, as they were also of the same opinion apparently. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhao Lei raised an eyebrow as he watched with interest. A second later, he commented, “Since Huang Xiaolong still dares to face Liu Qin, he probably has some tricks up his sleeve. Even if he can’t defeat Liu Qin, he probably has no problem escaping.”

Gongsun Chi joined in, “Still, if a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm like him could run away from an early First Order God King Realm master, it would be amazing indeed!”

Everyone nodded their heads in agreement.

...

Back on the giant island.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong saw Liu Qin and the other disciples waiting for him in the distance.

Now that he had seen Liu Qin, Huang Xiaolong was no longer in a hurry. He even slowed down his flying speed.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong in the distance, Liu Qin and the other disciples were ecstatic. Especially Liu Qin, his pupils dilated and a green light flickered across his eyes.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong stopped some distance away from Liu Qin’s group.

Liu Qin looked at Huang Xiaolong, and the corners of his mouth curved into an alluring smile as he said, “Huang Xiaolong, honestly, I admire you, admire you for having the courage to come here.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Liu Qin nonchalantly as he responded, “Honestly, I also admire you quite a bit.’

“Admire me?” Liu Qin repeated in confusion.

“Admire you for having the courage to wait for me over here.” Huang Xiaolong generously explained.

Liu Qin choked, then bent over with laughter with the other disciples.

Speechlessness washed over Zhao Lei, Gongsun Chi, Zhang Dong, and those in the examination hall. Though it was undeniable that Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength was amazing, speaking such arrogant words in front of a God King Realm master didn’t sound right.

After Liu Qin’s group had laughed enough, Huang Xiaolong said indifferently, “Laughed enough? Then, I’ll make my move.”

Liu Qin let out another whoop of laughter, then said, “Go on, make your move. You can attack at any time, but you should use your full force, don’t say I didn’t give you a chance.”

Full force?

“No need.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. His figure disappeared in a blur, and he reappeared with his fist punched out.
