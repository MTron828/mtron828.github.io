The nine dragon souls connected like a ring in the sky, head to tail, exuding waves of overwhelming dragon qi like golden drops of rain fluttering down the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple below.

Sitting cross-legged inside the temple, those golden raindrops made from dragon qi were spinning around Huang Xiaolong as if he was the center of the universe.

...

In the blink of an eye, another ten days passed.

On the day a full month passed since Huang Xiaolong had entered the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple, some changes were finally appearing. The nine dragon souls hovering above the temple began to shrink before returning to temple below, drilling into the dragon pearl and disappearing from sight.

The radiant light occupying the sky above the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple retreated like a rapid low tide back into the temple.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyelids trembled and gradually opened. The first thing he did was to check his internal condition, and the result made him nod his head in satisfaction.

This time, even after comprehending the golden dragon pearl, coupled with the infusion of soul force, he only made a small advancement from mid-Fifth Order to late-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm, yet Huang Xiaolong was content. In comparison, the regular mid-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm cultivators still couldn’t be certain they could breakthrough to late-Fifth Order even after thirty years of painstaking cultivation.

Huang Xiaolong got up and walked toward the entrance.

When he stepped out, he saw Song Chengli, Liu Zhuo, and Li Yangmin who had been waiting outside for the past month.

Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo were pacing back and forth in the air, looking extremely anxious.

The moment they saw Huang Xiaolong stepping out, the three of them were dazed for a second, but they quickly recovered their senses and hurried toward him. Song Chengli was the first one to speak, “Song Chengli greets the Martial Ancestor.”

After awakening the nine dragon souls, Huang Xiaolong had been recognized as the personal disciple of their Golden Dragon Gate’s First Ancestor, thus Song Chengli greeting Huang Xiaolong as ’Martial Ancestor’ was nothing out of the ordinary.

Martial Ancestor!

Hearing Song Chengli addressing Huang Xiaolong as Martial Ancestor, a shiver ran down Liu Zhuo’s back. When he remembered this disciple’s current identity, he quickly took half a step forward, saluting, “Liu Zhuo greets the Martial Ancestor.”

Li Yangmin was quivering visibly when it was his turn. In front of Huang Xiaolong, he fell to his knees with utmost respect, head bowed as he greeted Huang Xiaolong.

In a sect like the Golden Dragon Gate, the hierarchy of seniority was heavily emphasized. Addressing Huang Xiaolong that way was not perfunctory but was done with sincerity and respect from their hearts.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, accepting their salute without feeling burdened.

“I’m sure all of you are very curious why I, Tang Hong, with a mere high rank ten godhead could awaken the nine dragon souls.” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were sharp as an eagle, sweeping over the three people’s faces.

“Chengli dares not.” Song Chengli tensed but quickly replied.

“It’s understandable you would have this doubts. The truth is, I’m not the original Tang Hong who was a core disciple of your Golden Dragon Gate.” Huang Xiaolong suddenly said.

Song Chengli, Liu Zhuo, and Li Yangmin stiffened. He was not? But they could see that this ‘Tang Hong’ in front of them did not eat any pill that could change one’s features, they still had the eyesight to determine this.

Right in front of everyone, Huang Xiaolong’s face muscles and bones slowly contorted and changed into an unfamiliar black-haired young man with deep bright eyes, tall nose, and sharp eyebrows, exuding a domineering air.

This was Huang Xiaolong’s own face.

The three people were flabbergasted watching the way Huang Xiaolong’s face changed before their eyes. ‘There is such a level of disguise technique in this world?’

As far as they knew, even a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm master couldn’t change their physical features in this manner. Not even those Ancient God Realm legendary characters would be able to do it.

Huang Xiaolong had long thought about revealing his real face.

Backed by the fact that he had awakened the nine dragon souls, not to mention having Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du on his side, Huang Xiaolong saw no need to continue using Tang Hong’s identity.

“I am Huang Xiaolong, a disciple of the Green Cloud Island’s Barbarian God Sect.” Huang Xiaolong paid close attention to three people’s reactions as he spoke.

“The Barbarian God Sect’s Huang Xiaolong!” Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo exclaimed in surprise. They had heard of this name more than a couple of times in recent days.

“Also, the Green Ice Hail Devil who snatched the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus and the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast is my subordinate.” He summoned Bing Jiuyi out as he said this.

The instant Bing Jiuyi appeared, the surrounding airflow turned frigid cold like ice cavern.

“This...!”

Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo were at a loss for words due to shock. There was also an unknown feeling of excitement as their gazes fell on Bing Jiuyi despite the ringing in their heads. That peak early Second Order Ancient God Realm Green Ice Hail Devil was actually Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate?!

Li Yangmin’s brain had gone completely blank from the weight of the information he had heard.

Huang Xiaolong carefully observed all three people’s expressions. A few minutes later, when the three of them recovered slightly, he spoke directly to Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo, “I wish to refine a kind of ancient divine pill that needs the Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast’s blood and the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus, which is why I asked Bing Jiuyi to act. You won’t mind, right?”

Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo were jolted back to the present.

“Martial Ancestor is joking. Had we known that Martial Ancestor needed the two items to refine pills, we would have taken the initiative to offer the items up, how could we dare to blame Martial Ancestor.” Song Chengli hastened to reassure, the awe and respect in his eyes when looking at Huang Xiaolong deepened further.

Liu Zhuo smiled helplessly in his heart while claiming he dared not blame Huang Xiaolong on the surface. Don’t joke, even a peak early Second Order Ancient God Realm master was Huang Xiaolong’s subordinate, how would he have the courage to feel any dissatisfaction?

Not to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong was now the successor of their First Ancestor. Whether it be his identity or status, both were higher than Liu Zhuo’s. Dare they blame Huang Xiaolong? That would be rebelling against the sect!

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong’s communication talisman inside the Asura Ring shook. He took it out, sweeping it over with his divine sense. The message contained within was sent by Wei Chao and the Three Evils, saying that although they had yet to find the exact location of the Ancestral Dragon Fruit, they were certain it was inside the Hundred Beasts Summit area of the Blood Phoenix Forest.

Also, perhaps the Berserk Lion Sect Chief was suspicious or maybe it was due to other reasons, but he had abruptly decided to make a trip to the Blood Phoenix Forest for the Ancestral Dragon Fruit!

Right now, the Berserk Lion Sect Chief had already reached the Blood Phoenix Forest.

A frown appeared between Huang Xiaolong’s brows, he didn’t expect the Berserk Lion Sect Chief would suddenly travel to the Blood Phoenix Forest at this point. He had no choice but to hurry back to the Green Cloud Island as fast as possible.

“I have an urgent matter right now and need to rush back to the Green Cloud Island, I hope the three of you will keep my identity hidden, I do not want others to know about me for the time being.” Huang Xiaolong reminded Song Chengli and the other two, adding, “I’ll be back .”

Song Chengli, Liu Zhuo, and Li Yangmin were quick to comply.

However, before leaving, Huang Xiaolong inscribed the names of the remaining medicinal herbs and chaos spiritual herbs that he needed into a jade token so that Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo could help him search for them.

A while later, he was respectfully sent off by the three people.

“Sigh, I didn’t expect that Green Ice Hail Devil to be Martial Ancestor’s subordinate.” Liu Zhuo lamented, “I wonder how Martial Ancestor managed to subdue it.”

Song Chengli glared fiercely at Liu Zhuo, “Do not arbitrarily discuss Martial Ancestor’s matter.”

Liu Zhuo and Li Yangmin immediately shut up.

Song Chengli and Liu Zhuo then sped off, but before that they once again reminded Li Yangmin not to speak a word of Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

...

“The restriction around the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple has been taken down? The Ancestor ordered it?” Liu Qingyang sat on the main seat and his eyes flickered hearing the latest report. He questioned the disciple who came to report, “Has Tang Hong come out?”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
