Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Feng Yingying’s eyes glimmered with anticipation. If they could kill these few high-level Ancestor God Realm devils, and absorbed their Infernal Devil’s bloodline, it could surely raise the power of her Sea God’s bloodline.

She had learned a secret that the Divine World would face a great change in the near future, and before that happened, she needed to grow stronger as fast as possible, make the whole sea tribe stronger.

“Lord Sea God, Huang Xiaolong is also here in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield." One of the sea tribe’s family Patriarch informed Feng Yingying.

Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da snorted, "That kid better not run into me over here, or else, I’d extract his soul and refine his soul into a soul-ghost stone!”

Feng Yingying responded calmly, “Even though Huang Xiaolong’s godhead rank is not as high as Guo Jun’s, nor comparable to his same sect’s Li Lu and Wang Wei, his overall talent is actually higher than Guo Jun. It would be quite a pity to kill such a genius, therefore, the other option is to subjugate him, to serve us!”

She paused for a second before continuing, “And I lack a male slave by my side; Huang Xiaolong meets the requirements.”

Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da could only laugh and agree, “Lord Sea God is right, it is I, your subordinate who was lacking in thought.”

Feng Yingying nodded.

“Now, various Divine World’s top forces’ movements are becoming frequent, offering tempting benefits to recruit talented disciples, and if Huang Xiaolong gets selected by the Fortune Gate’s headquarters, it would be difficult for us to tame him!” Feng Family’s Ancestor Feng Jingxi said.

Sea Tribe wasn’t afraid of the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate. However, even if the sea tribe was ten times stronger than the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, they did not dare to provoke the Fortune Gate’s headquarters.

“Even if the Fortune Gate’s headquarters were to recruit disciples with emperor rank godhead, wouldn’t they find those that are mid or high-level Ancestor God Realm disciples, or even above that rank? Although Huang Xiaolong’s talent is not bad, his current strength is still too low. In short, Huang Xiaolong does not stand a chance.” Guo Da disagreed.

Feng Yingying did not refute Guo Da’s words. The group continued to fly onwards.

A few minutes later, the sea tribe’s group reached the Lightning Pool Mainland.

They could see the roiling lightning clouds above the Lightning Pool Mainland. A burst of light shrouded Feng Yingying’s body as her group rapidly flew towards the Lightning Pool Mainland, whistled through layers of lightning clouds. Upon contact with the light around Feng Yingying’s body, the lightning clouds bounced away, as if they had come across a kryptonite.

“Ei, what are these energy fluctuations?!”

“There are high-level Ancestor God Realm masters fighting ahead of us. Could it be those devils?!”

The group of sea tribe’s Ancestors immediately discovered the energy fluctuations from far away. Even though the energy fluctuations they sensed were quite weak due to the long distance, they could immediately judge that these energy fluctuations were generated from the fighting between the high-level Ancestor God Realm masters.

“Find out what’s going on!” Feng Yingying had already turned into a streak of light before her words sounded, as she sped towards the source of the energy fluctuations.

The rest of sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs hastened behind her.

Far ahead, above a mountain range, Huang Xiaolong’s group and the Sand Waves Sect’s group were battling one another.

Feng Er against Liang Luwen, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and Gui Er were holding back the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders and Elders, while Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were one-sidedly butchering the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples.

The more he fought Feng Er, the more dread and anger rose inside Liang Luwen’s heart. He was finding it difficult to accept that this young woman was powerful. No matter how hard he tried, she easily dispersed his attacks, putting him at a disadvantage.

He looked around. Several Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders and Elders were staggering back repeatedly, from void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and Gui Er’s attacks. Each of them had suffered different degrees of injuries.

His sect’s disciples were even more miserable. In just a short moment, almost all of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples were killed by Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

“Who are you all?!” Liang Luwen shouted angrily at Feng Er.

Feng Er didn’t answer him. Her slender palm lightly struck out, and the surroundings’ ghost fog attacked once again. Liang Luwen kept dodging repeatedly. He had tasted the pain of being touched by this ghost fog earlier. It had felt like being bitten by a million poisonous creatures.

Feng Er cornered the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief Liang Luwen, but as she was about to chase after him, her expression tightened suddenly as she turned to look towards the horizon.

Almost at the same time, the Sand Waves Sect Chief Liang Luwen also looked towards the horizon with a terrified expression.

Such powerful momentums!

Late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm? Or peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm?!

Why had so many masters appeared suddenly?!

A moment later, everyone else including void devil battle Xu Baisheng, Gui Yui, Gui Er, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Wang Lou, and the remaining Sand Waves Sect’s also sensed the powerful momentums coming towards them.

Affected by this overwhelming pressure, the space shook and the dark lightning clouds froze in their place. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s the sea tribe!” Huang Xiaolong and the little cow blurted out in unison, as their faces darkened.

During the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, the Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da and Patriarch Guo Shi had wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong, therefore, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were very familiar with their auras.

“Go!” Feng Er exclaimed when she heard Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s words. At that moment, she did not have any energy to deal with the Sand Waves Sect Chief. Darkness element godforce spread outwards to wrap around Huang Xiaolong and the little cow, and soon their world spun upside down as a black light streaked away.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and Gui Er hastened to follow behind them at their fastest speed.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group left, more than a dozen figures arrived. Space twisted as if it would shatter into pieces, with a little more pressure.

"It’s Huang Xiaolong’s aura! One of the sea tribe’s Ancestors exclaimed, the moment they stopped. The sea tribe was extremely sensitive to auras. Since Huang Xiaolong had left moments ago, some traces of him were still left behind. Therefore, the sea tribe’s Ancestor could recognize it immediately.

“Guo Da, Guo Shi, Teng Fei, Lu Yijiang, the four of you go chase after Huang Xiaolong. Remember, I want him alive!” Feng Yingying reminded them, and her tone carried an unquestionable authority.

Guo Da and the other three respectfully answered ‘yes,’ then disappeared from the spot.

Feng Yingying then turned around to look at the remaining group of Sand Waves Sect, and he gaze finally fell on Wang Luo.

......

Huang Xiaolong had barely left, when he immediately sensed four powerful auras chasing behind them.

Feng Er, Gui Yi, and others’ faces grew sullen.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Suddenly, Guo Family’s Ancestor Guo Da’s voice bellowed like thunder, and soundwaves jarred Huang Xiaolong’s and the others minds.

“I want to see how you’re going to escape this time!”

A giant hand tore through space, casting a shadow over Huang Xiaolong’s group as if there was a mountain falling down on them. The lightning clouds all around them were blown away.

As she saw the giant hand attacking them, Feng Er quickly pushed Huang Xiaolong away and ordered, “Gui Yi, help Manor Lord leave first!” At the same time, her palm struck upwards with all her might.

Rumble~! Fissures appeared in the surrounding space. And the earth quaked, raising a curtain of dust in the air.

Gui Yi didn’t even have enough time to help Huang Xiaolong escape, as they were hit by a surging force. Both he and Huang Xiaolong, as well as Gui Er, Xu Baisheng, and the little cow were smashed into a mountain in the distance.

However, when they were rolling down, they all suddenly disappeared.

“Manor Lord!” Feng Er immediately rushed to the spot from where Huang Xiaolong and the others had disappeared. Out of nowhere, a suction force pulled her, and she too disappeared.

In the next moment, Guo Da, Guo Shi, and the other two also reached the spot where Huang Xiaolong and his group had just disappeared. They searched up and down, but couldn’t find anything peculiar. The four of them looked at each other in confusion.

Guo Da and Guo Shi’s expressions were extremely ugly.
