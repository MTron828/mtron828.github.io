“That is hard to say.” Elder Fu pondered cautiously before answering Bei Xiaomei.

Bei Xiaomei’s eyebrows furrowed as she said, “If Uncle really loses, then you must save him immediately, even if you have to violate the Heavenly Court’s rules.”

A wry smile rose in Elder Fu’s heart, looking at Bei Xiaomei’s solemn expression. He could only nod and reassure her, “Don’t worry, Miss!”

In reality, Elder Fu wanted to highlight to his Miss that Huang Xiaolong’s two monsters would protect him if he were to face danger. The two monsters were more powerful than him.

“Huang Xiaolong, aren’t you preparing for battle?” On the battle stage, Lan Tailong nonchalantly shook his ten radiance wings as he went on coldly, “After losing, don’t say that I didn’t give you a chance to prepare.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At that point, the battle on the stage had yet to start officially.

The referee was giving the two participants some time to get ready.

Huang Xiaolong remained blase. “I believe that my strength is still sufficient to defeat you, so there is no need for me to prepare.”

The crowd below was stupefied after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Lan Tailong chuckled coldly. As he responded, there was a sharp glint in his eyes that was akin to rotating needles emitting glaring light, “Good, in that case, I do not need to worry about anything.”

Lan Tailong had decided to use the founder’s divine soul will’s power to suppress Huang Xiaolong until he could not move, and then behead him!

No, first, he would slice off two hundred and forty-five pieces from Huang Xiaolong’s flesh as sacrificial offerings to the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples he had murdered inside the Heavenly Court Secret Region. After that, he would kill Huang Xiaolong!

A golden light flashed as a long radiant sword appeared in Lan Tailong’s hand.

“Radiance Flames Divine Sword!”

In the distance, Zhao Lei’s face tightened in tension.

Other Emperor Palaces’ experts watched nervously.

The instant the long sword in Lan Tailong’s hand appeared, the surrounding temperatures rose sharply. Faint wisps of white flames dominated the entire battle stage environment.

Yet these faint white flames were akin to piercing swords that penetrated one’s soul.

Even though the long sword’s sharpness was not directed at the crowd, they could still feel prickling pain in their souls.

The Radiance Flames Divine Sword was the Brightness Emperor Palace’s ultimate treasure sword with earth-shattering power. It was a top-grade grandmist spiritual weapon, and it was needless to explain the divine sword’s sharpness. It was said that it could slash and pierce through anything.

On top of that, the Radiance Flames Divine Sword contained incredible radiance energy. After cutting its victims, the divine sword’s radiance energy would invade the victim’s body, destroying it from within, down to the godhead.

The Radiance Flames Divine Sword was the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s weapon. Who would’ve thought that Lan Tailong would bring it to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court?

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed when the Radiance Flames Divine Sword appeared.

“Start!”

Right at this time, referees on numerous battle stages shouted simultaneously.

In a split second, figures on various battle stages lunged towards their opponents. Lan Tailong was the same. He turned into a streak of white light, accelerating forward. He was so fast that even some Tenth Order Heavenly Monarchs couldn’t capture his movements.

The instant Lan Tailong moved, he employed the Brightness Founder’s divine soul will behind him. The white light enshrouding the shadow intensified, as it’s majestic momentum enveloped the whole battle stage. Under the Brightness Founder’s divine soul will’s pressure, even the experts in the crowd were pinned in place by an invisible pressure. They were astounded to discover that they could not move at all.

Even the peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm experts weren’t spared.

Moreover, the Brightness Founder’s divine soul will’s power was not actually aimed at them, but at Huang Xiaolong. One could only imagine the amount of pressure Huang Xiaolong was experiencing.

Lan Tailong aimed the Radiance Flames Divine Sword’s tip at Huang Xiaolong’s head and slashing down.

Huang Xiaolong stood motionless on the battle stage as if welcoming the attack. It looked like he had turned silly, as the Radiance Flames Divine Sword’s tip was ten meters away from his head.

“An Emperor’s might is indeed, terrifying! Under the Brightness Founder’s divine soul will’s pressure, one can only be fish on the chopping board! Huang Xiaolong’s dead for sure!”

“I thought it would be the battle of the millennium, but who could have guessed that Huang Xiaolong would die so fast!”

Experts in the crowd shook their heads.

“It looks like Huang Xiaolong overestimated his own strength. If he would’ve made some preparations earlier, he wouldn’t have got defeated in one strike!”

“He just wasted those forty million low-grade chaos spirit stones!”

At this point, some people were still obsessed with Huang Xiaolong’s bet of forty million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

Finally, before the crowd’s eyes, Lan Tailong’s Radiance Flames Divine Sword pierced Huang Xiaolong’s head!

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Bei Xiaomei, and the others turned deathly pale at this sight.

On the other hand, Lan Tailong’s face twisted in an insane smile.

But in the next second, his expression stiffened as his Radiance Flames Divine Sword felt no resistance at all like he was cutting through the air.

This!

An afterimage!

Lan Tailong was dumbfounded.

The Radiance Flames Divine Sword cut through the air and slashed the battle stage floor, leaving a long cut across the surface.

The crowd was stunned. What happened?

“It is a good sword, but your speed is too slow!” Right at this time, a voice sounded behind Lan Tailong. Lan Tailong’s eyes widened in astonishment as he spun around to see that Huang Xiaolong was standing behind him.

Lan Tailong’s breathing became a little heavy as he looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, “You, how could you...?!”

Huang Xiaolong was unaffected by the Brightness Founder’s divine soul will’s suppression?!

Those under the stage were just as flabbergasted.

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, and Bei Xiaomei were at a loss for words.

“Did you two understand what happened?” Heavenly Emperor Di Jun asked in a casual tone, but his eyes glimmered as he looked at Huang Xiaolong on the battle stage.

Yan Tianchen came to his senses and shared his thoughts, “Huang Xiaolong has a grandmist grade soul defense artifact!”

Xiao Yi, who was standing by his side, nodded in agreement.

Heavenly Emperor Di Jun fell silent. Yan Tianchen’s judgment that Huang Xiaolong had a grandmist grade soul defense artifact was accurate, but it was more complicated than that. One could not remain unaffected by an Emperor divine soul will by merely relying on a grandmist soul defense artifact.

But that was the Brightness Founder’s Emperor divine soul will! Even if it was only a tiny portion!

Lan Tailong bellowed loudly on the stage, and he once again aimed the Radiance Flames Divine Sword at Huang Xiaolong. This time, the Radiance Flames Divine Sword emitted rays of great sword light, and the burning white flames sizzled the air.

Lan Tailong refused to believe he could miss again. He employed the Brightness Founder’s Emperor divine soul will once more, and a mammoth of pressure slammed down on Huang Xiaolong.

Lan Tailong’s ten radiance wings flapped as he accelerated forward.

“Die!”

Lan Tailong bellowed as white light shot out from his eyes.

The Radiance Flames Divine Sword in Lan Tailong’s hand once again advanced towards Huang Xiaolong’s head, but this time, Huang Xiaolong did not dodge. Instead, he reached out with two of his fingers and clipped the sword’s tip, as if that was Lan Tailong’s intention all along.

Sword rays disappeared, and time froze.
