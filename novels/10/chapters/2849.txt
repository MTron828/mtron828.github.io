Chapter 2850: Dog of a slave!

After seeing that a mere outer disciple had dared to bark at him, Long Jianfei’s sullen face turned colder. Had this been in the past, he would have slapped this outer disciple into the ground, head-first.

Long Jianfei ordered coldly, “Call out the elder of Blue Rainbow Branch. I want to see him.”

The outer disciple Zhou Xing, Tai Cheng, and everyone else momentarily froze in shock.

When Zhou Xing reacted, he laughed in anger. The servant of a punk that god knew which remote sacred land he had climbed out from had not only ignored his question, but the moment his slave had opened his mouth, he had demanded to see their elder!

Huang Xiaolong and Duan Feng didn’t even give Zhou Xing a glance, and it was blatant disregard.

Zhou Xing’s temper flared. “Dog slave, do you think a lowly slave like you is qualified to see our elder? Can anyone meet our Elder whenever they want?!”

“You better…” Before Zhou Xing could finish his words, a cold gleam flickered across Long Jianfei’s eyes and in the next moment, his palm was clutching Zhou Xing’s neck. Zhou Xing was lifted off the floor by the neck.

Everyone was startled.

Tai Cheng, Tai Family’s other disciples, the disciples registering from various sacred lands, as well as the present Dragon Fish Creed branch’s outer disciples were all watching Zhou Xing being lifted off the ground by his neck dazedly.

As far as they knew, no one had the guts to fight within the Blue Rainbow City, much less fight inside the front hall of the Dragon Fish Creed branchl!

Moreover, attacking a Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple!

Something like this had never happened before!

The noisy front hall turned deathly quiet faster than a needle drop.

“Dog slave?” Long Jianfei’s gaze hardened.

Zhou Xing’s face was maroon from suffocation. He too was in a state of disbelief. It had never occurred to him that a small character’s slave from an unknown sacred land would have the guts to attack him and hold him off the floor by his neck!

This was an unforgivable insult!

“Dog-slave, I don’t care who you are, but you are going to die today. You’re so dead!” Zhou Xing roared, and his face turned a deeper shade of red.

As a Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple, he was enthusiastically welcomed by various forces wherever he went and no one dared to slight him.

The rage burning inside his chest, and his volatile killing intent, surged from his soul like never before. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

His furious bellow reverberated through the spacious front hall, fully displaying his roiling fury.

The various sacred lands’ disciples trembled.

Tai Cheng recovered from his shock and looked at Huang Xiaolong with a gloating expression. In his opinion, this group of three, a master and his two slaves, were going to die today, and there was no doubt about it! Zhou Xing was not a simple Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciple. He was the Dragon Fish Creed’s Blue Rainbow branch’s Deacon Liu Ansheng’s nephew!

By this time, other Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciples also reacted and rushed towards Long Jianfei.

“Mongrel, let Senior Brother Zhou Xing down right now! Then beg for mercy on your knees!”

“Do you hear me?! Or else, I’ll kill you first then annihilate your clan later!”

Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze was full of frost at these disciples’ threats.

It seemed as though these Dragon Fish Creed outer disciples were too used to their high statuses that they could easily utter ‘annihilating a person’s entire clan’ every time they opened their mouths.

Huang Xiaolong signaled Long Jianfei with a slight nod of his head. Long Jianfei understood his intention immediately, and in the next second, a loud smack rang as his palm struck across Zhou Xing’s cheek. Zhou Xing screamed as he was sent flying out of the hall, and rolled all the way out to the square upon landing on the ground. Shrieks and shouts of chaos from outside traveled into the hall.

Long Jianfei’s palm struck out a second time, sending the several outer disciples, who had yelled at him to kneel and beg for his life, threatening to annihilate his clan.

Like Zhou Xing, these several Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciples also crashed to the ground and rolled all the way to the outside square.

Although the Dragon Fish Creed had strict requirements when recruiting outer disciples, the requirement on cultivation realm wasn’t set very high, which was the True Saint Realm and above. When a disciple passed through a series of assessments, they would be accepted as outer disciples by the Dragon Fish Creed. Hence, Zhou Xing and these few outer disciples’ strength wasn’t something to shout about, and they were merely at the mid-level of True Saint Realm.

Tai Cheng watched Long Jianfei as he not only attacked Zhou Xing, but also other Dragon Fish Creed’s outer disciples. Instead of being apprehensive, Tai Cheng watched on with schadenfreude, and felt excited.

The more aggressively Long Jianfei attacked, the more miserable Long Jianfei would be when the Dragon Fish Creed’s experts arrived!

“Young Lord, that guy is a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor,” a guard behind Tai Cheng informed him.

Tai Chen chuckled maliciously and responded, “He is merely a Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, but he dares to cause trouble at the Dragon Fish Creed’s Blue Rainbow branch by attacking the outer disciples. I wonder if they are fools or simply fearless? Perhaps, people from remote sacred lands are ignorant that the Dragon Fish Creed’s experts would arrive soon. Therefore, we just need to wait to see a good show!”

“Young Lord, do you think we should lend a hand to the Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples in capturing these three? Maybe, the branch’s Elder Li Yuan would view the Young Lord in a new light.” The guard suggested in a fawning manner.

He was a late-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, while the Tai Family guards’ strengths ranged between Fifth and Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestors. With this amount of power, suppressing those three was more than enough in their opinions.

After hearing that, Tai Cheng’s eyes lit up and he nodded. However, just as he was about to agree, a dozen figures arrived with the whistling winds, and a thunderous bellow rang, “Who’s so preposterous, making trouble at the Dragon Fish Creed’s Blue Rainbow branch!”

A burst of light flickered in the front hall as a dozen people appeared in everyone’s sight.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the new faces, and his eyes finally stopped on the leading old man. This person should be the Dragon Fish Creed’s Blue Rainbow branch’s elder, a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

For a top creed powerhouse like the Dragon Fish Creed, the highest authority in a branch was the branch elder. Although merely a branch elder, this position’s status was higher than that of an inner disciple because a branch elder was usually selected from the inner disciples through a series of assessments.

Even though this old man was only a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, his combat power was definitely very high, surpassing many perfection half-step Dao Venerables, perhaps even First Esteem Dao Venerables.

In the next moment, countless figures moved in the surroundings as other disciples in the branch and guards encircled the front hall.

“Elder Li Yuan, Deacons!”

Zhou Xing and other outer disciples, who were sent flying earlier, hurried back into the front hall in a sorry state and saluted Elder Li Yuan and present deacons.

Deacon Liu Ansheng behind Elder Li Yuan was enraged when he saw Zhou Xing’s face that was no different than a pig’s head. His murderous glare was deathly fixed on Long Jianfei. “Are you the b*stard who did that? You’ve got guts to run rampant in the Dragon Fish Creed’s branch. I tell you how you will die!”

Long Jianfei did not spare Liu Ansheng even a side glance, he looked at Li Yuan and spoke, “Are you the Elder of Blue Rainbow branch?”

Lin Yuan frowned but affirmed when he noticed that instead of being flustered Lang Jianfei was asking him if he was the branch elder, “That’s right, I am!”
