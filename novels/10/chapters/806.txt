That night, a lively banquet lit up the Huang Clan Manor.

Huang Xiaolong and his parents sat at the head of the banquet table. His family was on the left, whereas on the right side were Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, Phoenix Clan Ancestor, and the other Highgod Realm masters.

As per the norm, Huang Xiaolong asked about matters related to Martial Spirit World while he was away.

In that period, Martial Spirit World was mostly peaceful except for quite a few small incidents; such as many cultivators migrating over to Martial Spirit World and setting up residences there as the spiritual energy became more abundant. It was those outsiders who had many conflicts with the native families.

Those outside cultivators wanted to take over some kingdoms’ royal cities, and even imperial cities. That was because Spirit Amplifying Arrays were built in each royal and imperial city, resulting in these places having a richer spiritual energy compared to other places.

The Martial Spirit World’s royal and imperial families all sought aid from the Huang Clan Manor.

Huang Peng made the decision and had the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, Phoenix Clan Patriarch, and the several other Highgod Realm masters lend a hand to these royal and imperial cities, hence the situation didn’t worsen. Huang Peng had those outside cultivators who tried to occupy the royal and imperial cities be captured and not killed, locking them up in the secret chamber in the mountain behind Huang Clan Manor and await Huang Xiaolong’s decision after his return.

Hearing the details of these events, Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into furrows.

Outside cultivators wanting to reside in Martial Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong won’t stop them. In fact, he welcomed them, only this would help bring more prosperity to Martial Spirit World.

But these cultivators, after arriving here, actually wanted to forcefully occupy the royal and imperial cities, this meant they didn’t put the Huang Clan Manor in their eyes.

No doubt, upon arriving here, they could ask any random person on the street and know that Martial Spirit World was under the Huang Clan Manor’s governance. The whole Martial Spirit World was their territory.

But even after knowing this, those people still dared to forcefully occupy some cities?

The look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned cold, it seems like he needed to kill a few chickens to scare the monkeys.

Huang Xiaolong asked about the identities those outside cultivators. Most of them were disciples of super forces from the four galaxies, but there was a small number of evil cultivators, and even demonic beast clan masters.

“Right, Little Huang brat, there’s one more thing.” Suddenly remembering something, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi said, “About a decade ago, not too long after you left the Huang Clan Manor, although indistinct, I sensed some prying eyes over the Huang Clan Manor. That person’s strength is definitely above mine.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Strength above Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s?

By now, Huang Xiaolong already knew the old dragon’s strength, he was a peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm master with half a step into the next level. Moreover, with his ancient golden-dragon true form, his strength was comparable to an early Third Order Highgod Realm master.

Yet, that person’s strength was above his? Didn’t that mean that person’s strength was at least a mid-Third Order Highgod Realm master, or even higher?!

“Did you get a clear look at that person’s face?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi replied, “No, I could only sense that person’s presence, but every time I rushed over, that person was already gone. Two months later, that person finally left and has never appeared again.”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned somber.

Then, a thought struck him; could it be that mysterious Great Lord?! Or someone that mysterious Great Lord sent?

It was still better if that person was the mysterious Great Lord, this meant that Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi could estimate that person’s strength to be between mid to late-Third Order Highgod Realm. However, if that person was only sent here by the mysterious Great Lord, this was an alarming fact.

If merely a subordinate possessed the strength of a mid-Third Order Highgod Realm and above, then what about that mysterious Great Lord himself? How powerful was he?!

Being able to direct a Third Order Highgod Realm master, this mysterious Great Lord was likely to be a Fourth Order, perhaps even a Fifth Order Highgod Realm master!

With the thought of this unfamiliar mysterious enemy hanging over his head, Huang Xiaolong had everyone end the banquet early.

After the banquet ended, Huang Xiaolong went back to his courtyard.

‘Looks like I need to hurry and find the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s last sealed body part.’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

As long as he found the last sealed part of the Hundred Spirits Beast King, he would be able to have a complete Soul Devouring Physique, which would grant him the ability to swallow souls to increase the clarity of his own soul. As long as his soul clarity reached a certain degree of clarity, even if his cultivation didn’t break through to the Highgod Realm, that mysterious Great Lord wouldn’t be able to harm him.

When the Highgod Advancement Tournament began, he would kill Xiang Mingzhi and obtain the Azure Dragon Divine Fire. At that time, with the four great divine fires merged into one body, he would take the next step, advancing into Highgod Realm and forming the lord of godheads! He need not worry about that mysterious Great Lord then.

Huang Xiaolong was calmer after he made his decision.

The next day, Huang Xiaolong had the Phoenix Clan Ancestor bring out all the cultivators who were locked up in the Huang Clan Manor’s back mountain and bring them to the great hall. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There were more than thirty people.

When all the captives were brought before Huang Xiaolong, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor briefly explained Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

“Huang Xiaolong, what right do you have to capture us? We brothers are personal disciples of the White Tiger Galaxy’s Broken Sword Sect Leader, let us go immediately!” Almost instantly, one of the captives started screaming.

“That’s right, who stipulated that this Martial Spirit World belongs to your Huang Clan Manor? Does it belong to Huang Clan Manor just because you say so? Then I say that the whole Black Tortoise Galaxy belongs to my demonic beast clan!” A demonic beast clan master barked, “Don’t assume you can do as you like lawlessly, capturing whoever you want simply because have the Black Warrior Institute Principal and the Ascending Moon Old Man backing you and recruited a bunch of Highgod Realm masters! Immediately release this lord, else, this lord’s demonic beast army will come and raze this Martial Spirit World to the ground!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he shook his head, “Is that so?”

Seeing the indifferent expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face, the demonic beast clan master clamored even harder, “My father is the Piercing Sky Beast King! Harm one hair on my body and your Martial Spirit World will accompany me into the grave.”

“Oh, so it’s the Piercing Sky Beast King’s son.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. No wonder he was so arrogant.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked at the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, “Drag all of them out of the Huang Clan Manor, kill them all.”

Those who were clamoring haughtily suddenly fell into silence.

“Yes, Master.” Phoenix Clan Ancestor acknowledged.

“Huang Xiaolong, you dare!! You dare to kill us?!!”

“You cannot kill us! I’m of one Nefarious King’s six guardian deities! If you kill me, the Nefarious King won’t spare you!”

Following that, the other captives began to shout and yell too.

They had thought of a lot of ways Huang Xiaolong would deal with them, but it never crossed their minds even once that Huang Xiaolong would dare to kill them!

Ignoring these noises, Huang Xiaolong nodded at the Phoenix Clan Ancestor, hence he and the others no longer hesitated, dragging all the captives out.

A while later, the Phoenix Clan Ancestor returned, reporting his completion of the task, all captives were killed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, ordering him and the others to pay close attention to the situation in the Martial Spirit World and increase the Huang Clan Manor’s defenses.

After the Phoenix Clan Ancestor withdrew from the hall, Huang Xiaolong took out the Thousand Worlds Furnace. He was planning to refine a big batch of Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets in preparation for his trip to the Devil Domain Mainland, lest he runs into danger.

Just as he was done with the first round, he noticed Shi Xiaofei coming into the hall, saying, “Big brother Huang, I haven’t seen Master for a long time and I’d like to go to the Wintry North World tomorrow. You, can you go with me?”

Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised. However, looking at Shi Xiaofei’s eyes that were full of anticipation, he nodded, “Alright.” Even though Shi Xiaofei was already a Fifth Order God Realm master now, he couldn’t be at ease letting her go alone.

In fact, he hadn’t seen the Ascending Moon Old Man for a long time as well.

Yesterday, his family said that the old man returned ten years ago from Vermilion Bird Galaxy’s Fire World. After staying for some time in the Huang Clan Manor, he went back to his cultivation dwelling in the Wintry North World. The old man left word with his family, saying that if Xiaolong returned, he could look for him in the Wintry North World.

He could take this opportunity to speak with the old man about the mysterious Great Lord.

As for the Devil Domain Mainland, it could only be postponed.
