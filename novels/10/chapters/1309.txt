Zhu Feng’s liver was close to exploding, as a merely common Guo Family’s disciple had dared to treat him in such an insulting manner. His fists clenched tightly, and he was excluding a strong urge to kill this Guo Family’s disciple! Kill this dog of a disciple! Kill this lowly scum!

Zhu Feng almost gave into his impulse to kill the Guo Family’s disciple, but Zhu Yi blocked him from making a rash move.

“Father!” Zhu Feng cried out, as his father had stopped him, and his anger was boiling in his heart.

Zhu Yi’s expression was sullen as he reminded, “We’re in Sea God City.”

Zhu Feng was furious, and so was he. As the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s Chief, this was the first time he was humiliated like this since he had risen to the Fortune Gate Chief position for almost thirty thousand years.

It was obvious that this Guo Family’s disciple had received instructions from Guo Family’s higher echelon, otherwise, this disciple wouldn’t have dared to act this way.

Guo Family! Huang Xiaolong, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Wang Wei, and the rest stood with sullen expressions.

In the end, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, and Zhu Yi sat down. However, Guo Family had only arranged three seats for the Fortune Gate, therefore, Huang Xiaolong, Zhu Feng, and Wang Wei could only stand.

This further infuriated Zhu Feng! He, as the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s Young Lord, who was a peak late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm master, actually had to stand!

Furthermore, other forces’ experts as well as even the Ancient God Realm disciples were offered seats!

Zhu Feng glared angrily at Huang Xiaolong. In his opinion, the Guo Family was targeting them because Huang Xiaolong had heavily injured Guo Gang in Sea God City.

He was being targeted simply because he was in the same group as Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong looked to the front where the Wangu Clan’s group was seated, and completely ignored Zhu Feng’s fierce glare. Wangu Ziyi was looking at the Fortune Gate smugly, and obviously gloating at their situation. Clearly, he was over the moon at the sea tribe’s treatment towards the Fortune Gate.

Huang Xiaolong saw the Dark Elf Tribe’s group seated beside the Wangu Clan’s group, amongst them was You Wuxin. The Dark Elf Tribe was also arranged in the first row seats. Among the Vientiane World’s human forces, only the Fortune Gate’s group was arranged in a far away corner.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong saw the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s group, and the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s group. Both forces’ seats were also arranged in the first row. Li Zhi sat not far from Wangu Ziyi, however, the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s Wang Yu was nowhere to be seen.

Wang Yu did not appear because he was probably still lying in bed in a residence somewhere in the Sea God City. Huang Xiaolong hadn’t shown any restraints when he punched Wang Yu. Therefore, there was a high possibility that Wang Yu would stay in bed for a few years.

While Huang Xiaolong surveyed the crowd as he stood behind Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, various forces’ experts were also observing Huang Xiaolong. Many of them were snickering and laughing with their companions.

“That’s Huang Xiaolong of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate? Is he really that strong?” A disciple questioned doubtfully.

“Absolutely true! There were a lot of experts present, when Huang Xiaolong sent an early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm sea tribe’s patrol guard flying with just one punch. A peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm sent an early Tenth Order Ancient God Realm disciple flying with a punch... That’s too monstrous!”

“Monstrous? What’s the use of being a monstrous genius? The sea tribe absolutely won’t let him off today, the Guo Family is probably planning to chop his flesh and bones into a minced meat. Mark my words, when the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony begins, the Guo Family’s number one genius Guo Jun would surely challenge Huang Xiaolong. He’s dead for sure!”

“That’s a pity. It’s a total waste of such a monstrous battle power. If he were to live to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm, he surely would deter the neighboring world surfaces’ forces!”

Huang Xiaolong remained unaffected as he listened to these people’s whispers.

As time passed, experts from neighboring forces arrived consecutively. Gradually, all the empty seats were filled.

Zhu Feng’s expression grew uglier by the second because he could notice that the various forces’ experts had seats, including their disciples. Only he, Huang Xiaolong, and Wang Wei were standing.

Even though they were standing at the edge of the square, it still felt like they were standing at its center.

Every group that was arriving couldn’t help but looked in their direction. There were even female disciples that pointed at them, then covered their mouths and giggled.

Zhu Feng was on the verge of going berserk.

Li Zhi looked at Huang Xiaolong from where he sat, not bothering to disguise his hatred towards him. Although his injuries were not as severe as Wang Yu’s, Huang Xiaolong had almost crippled him.

"Huang Xiaolong won’t be proud for too long. I met with Guo Jun yesterday, and Guo Jun said that Huang Xiaolong’s blood would be used as an offering on the Sea God’s Sacrificial Altar to the ancient Sea God’s souls.” A Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple seated next to Li Zhi assured him.

Li Zhi nodded. He looked at Huang Xiaolong and said through gritted teeth, “Pity that I won’t be able to kill him myself.”

...

One hour passed as the seats on the square were filled.

Once everyone was seated,the sea tribe’s disciples surrounding the arena blew into a long conch like shell. A deep sound resembling rolling waves, or a flute reverberated in the air.

The undulating melody quieted the noisy crowd at the square.

Subsequently, the sea tribe’s twelve prominent families’ experts stepped out from a large black hole in the void above the square. The first in line was the Feng Family.

The Feng Family’s Ancestor was acknowledged as the sea tribe’s strongest person. Not to mention Feng Yingying’s appearance was considered with high regards amongst Sea tribe, therefore, the Feng Family had gradually became the leader of the twelve prominent families.

Feng Family’s Ancestor was the first person to step out from the void, followed by Feng Family’s Patriarch. But the third person to step out was not a Feng Family’s Grand Elder, instead, it was a tall, slender, peerless beautiful young woman clad in a blue battle armor who was exuding a cold, noble air.

It looked like this woman was born with an innate charm, as she was mesmerizing everyone. This charm was originating from her blood, and from her soul.

Even more startling thing was that the blue battle armor was full of holes; tiny holes that led straight to the jade-smooth skin beneath. They could even see the pinkish tenderness of her skin.

The upper part of the battle armor was barely covering up her voluptuous bosom. This sight jarred the minds of the forces’ experts and disciples on the square. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She is Feng Yingying!

The sea tribe’s number one genius!

Peerless as the rumors!

Huang Xiaolong noticed that Wang Wei and Zhu Feng’s breathing had become a little chaotic. Naturally, other sects’ disciples were even more obvious.

“This female has cultivated the Enchantress Tribe’s technique.” The little cow said suddenly.

“Enchantress Tribe?” There was confusion in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The little cow explained, “The Enchantress is one of the ancient tribes, and one of the more powerful ones too. Males as well as females of this tribe were perceived to be extremely enchanting and charming because they cultivated an enchanting technique. The Enchantress Tribe’s enchanting technique was famous even in the ancient times, but this female is just a beginner.”

Huang Xiaolong was astonished. ‘The effect is already shocking, even though Feng Yingying is a beginner. If she were to fully grasped the essence of this technique, would that mean she could make anyone succumb to her charm and beauty with a snap of her finger?

“That female is looking at you.” The little cow’s voice broke Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts.
