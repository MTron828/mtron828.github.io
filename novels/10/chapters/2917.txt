Chapter 2918: Locating the Sealed Space

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject the other party’s invitation to join them.

With his strength, he could deal with all of them with a wave of his hand. There was no need for him to worry that they would stand in his way of obtaining the treasure.

Soon after, all of them entered the Golden Sun Forest.

“Senior Brother Han Tong, have your injuries healed?” a disciple of the Dragon Fish Creed asked.

When his injury was brought up, a flash of rage could be seen on Han Tong’s face. However, his rage wasn’t directed at the disciple who brought up the question, and he gritted his teeth in response. “Close enough.”

The kick that had landed on him in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land wasn’t light, but he was pretty much fine after so many years of recovery.

He hated it when anyone brought up his experience there as it was one of his deepest humiliations. Whenever they spoke of the incident, his expression would be one of utter rage.

Every time he thought about the incident, his hatred for Huang Xiaolong would increase by a notch or two.

“Word from the outside world has it that Young Lady Yin Yue invited Huang Xiaolong over the Silver Shadow Creed to deal with the poison plaguing her mother! He’s said to be spending every day in her company!” Another disciple from the Dragon Fish Creed spat.

With his expression sinking once again, Han Tong felt a trace of rage boiling in his heart. Yin Yue had many suitors, and he was one of them.

“Humph, Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to live for long.” A sneer left Han Tong’s lips all of a sudden. “My master said that the day His Highness Huang Shuai enters the Dao Venerable Realm is the day Huang Xiaolong dies.”

The core disciples of the Dragon Fish Creed were shocked at his sudden revelation.

“Senior Brother Han, what do you mean?” someone in the crowd asked.

With a gleeful smile, Han Tong continued, “Since he’s going to die anyway, there’s nothing I can’t say. When His Highness Huang Shuai enters the Dao Venerable Realm, the patriarch might move against Huang Xiaolong with several others. The Divination Dao Venerable and the others are all involved in this, and if they make a move, they’ll kill Huang Xiaolong once and for all!”

“The patriarch and several other peak-level Dao Venerables are planning to kill Huang Xiaolong?!” They couldn’t believe what they just heard.

“There’s no way… With his monstrous talent, Huang Xiaolong has three dao souls and eleven high-order Saint Fates… He has even managed to wield cosmos energy before entering the Dao Venerable Realm, and there should be a lot of creeds waiting to suck up to him. I’ve heard that the Silver Shadow Dao Venerable personally met with Huang Xiaolong when he went over, and she even set up a banquet to welcome him!”

Han Tong snorted. “What do you know? Huang Xiaolong might be talented, but he’s too f*cking talented! He even managed to outshine His Highness, and there’s no way our patriarch will allow that! Our patriarch made plans with the other peak-level Dao Venerables to take over the Divine Tuo Holy World for His Highness, and Huang Xiaolong’s appearance threw a wrench in their plans!”

Han Tong paused for a second as the eyes of the disciples around him lit up.

After living for so many years, they were extremely clear about what he meant.

“When that happens, our patriarch will call for a ceremony to celebrate His Highness’ ascension! He would become the sole patriarch of the top ten creeds, and he would use present Huang Xiaolong’s head as a tribute to scare the others into surrendering!” Han Tong laughed.

“When our patriarch works with the others, no one in the world will be able to protect Huang Xiaolong. Not even the Silver Shadow Creed! I can’t wait to see the reactions of the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World when they see Huang Xiaolong’s head presented on a platter.”

“Hahaha! They will definitely be shocked!”

They roared with laughter when they thought about the possibility. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong’s initial plan was to punish them a little when he was done. However, the more he heard, the colder the look in his eyes became.

“Junior Brother Zhang, aren’t you happy to learn that Huang Xiaolong will soon be killed? Your admiration for Young Lady Yin Yue isn’t something you can hide from all of us. Just wait for little doggy Huang to be slain!” Han Tong roared with laughter when he saw the frosty look on ‘Zhang Tianhong’s’ face.

Huang Xiaolong turned to glare at them, and he growled, “I wasn’t planning to kill you guys. However, I changed my mind! All of you must be tired of living!”

Han Tong and the others were taken aback when they heard what he said.

“Junior Brother Zhang, what do you think you’re doing?” Han Tong’s expression sank.

They might have been students under the same master, but their relationship was nothing to go off about. When Han Tong heard what his ‘junior brother’ said, rage boiled in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong’s facial features started to change before Han Tong could react, and he revealed his original appearance before them.

The disciples behind Han Tong might not have been able to recognize him, but Han Tong would never forget Huang Xiaolong’s face as long as he lived. A terrified expression formed on his face, and he stammered, “Huang… Huang… Huang Xiaolong?!”

Even though he hated the other party and wanted nothing more than to kill the b*stard personally, he knew that he would never be able to! Standing in front of the devil himself, he nearly peed his pants.

When the others learned of Huang Xiaolong’s identity, their legs went soft.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you want?!” Han Tong’s body started to convulse, and he stammered, “This… This is the Dragon Fish Creed. If you dare to move against me…” He shattered a transmission symbol in his hands all of a sudden.

A mocking smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he noticed Han Tong’s sneaky actions. He had long expected Han Tong to attempt something like that. Before he had revealed himself, he had covered the entire area with his three dao souls, and there was no way he would allow his whereabouts to be revealed.

Realizing that he wasn’t getting a reply after shattering his transmission symbol, Han Tong stared at Huang Xiaolong with a face full of despair.

“Huang Xiaolong, I…” Before Han Tong could explain himself, Huang Xiaolong’s plan had already shattered his body. He grabbed Han Tong’s dao soul and threw him into the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

The other disciples felt endless despair, and none of them had the notion of resisting.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to shatter all their physical bodies. With no exceptions, all of their dao souls were thrown into the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

After he was done, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t bothered in the slightest. As long as Han Tong’s dao soul was still alive, the experts of the Dragon Fish Creed wouldn’t be able to notice his disappearance.

Of course, he didn’t dare to let down his guard either. He changed his appearance back to that of Zhang Tianhong, and he continued to look for the armor.

Avoiding the broken space and fierce beasts in the forest, Huang Xiaolong proceeded cautiously towards his destination.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t fear the beasts, but he knew that running into a region of broken space would waste a lot of time. They wouldn’t be a threat to his life, but they would slow him down considerably.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at the foot of a mountain peak in the depths of the forest.

“There it is…” Turning to look at the body of the mountain, Huang Xiaolong could feel that the Huang Long Armor was hidden in the space in the core of the mountain.

With no hesitation, he tore a hole through the face of the mountain and went straight to the core.

On his way, he ran into a formless barrier. Instead of feeling annoyed, a brilliant smile crept up his face. Huang Xiaolong knew that the formless barrier was the sealed space containing the Huang Long Armor!

Retrieving the dragon scale, he activated the Huang Long Bloodline flowing in his veins. As golden light emerged from the scale, a gap formed in the barrier protecting the sealed space.

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong held the scale in his hand as he entered the gap in the barrier.
