“Old man, you are leaving?” This was unexpected for Huang Xiaolong. He had been coming here daily for the last ten years, learning alchemy every day from the old man. Suddenly hearing that the old man was leaving, he did feel reluctant and out of sorts.

Seeing this, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s wrinkled of face split into a wide grin, “What is it, little disciple, are you reluctant to see this old man leave?”

Huang Xiaolong decisively rolled his eyes at the old man.

The Ascending Moon Old Man chuckled proudly, “Actually, this old man is also very reluctant to leave you brat, your parents, and everyone else, but every banquet must come to an end. I know you’re prone to troublemaking, but I’ve already had a word with that Feng Yang boy. If something happens to you while I’m gone, I’ll peel off a layer of his skin when I come back!”

A surge of warmth filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

On the same day, Huang Xiaolong had everyone gathered over a bonfire party as a farewell for the Ascending Moon Old Man.

It was obvious that the Ascending Moon Old Man was extremely happy during the bonfire party. Of course, according to the old man’s childish behavior, many times throughout the night his little disciple Huang Xiaolong was the target of his jokes. Taking advantage of his ‘drunkenness’ the old man announced loudly that he hoped Huang Xiaolong and Shi Xiaofei would give birth to a hundred little grand-disciples.

A hundred? Huang Xiaolong’s pulled a bitter face.

Even if he was willing, who knows if Shi Xiaofei would agree. Even then, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t sure they could achieve that figure. A person wasn’t a Tyrant Boar, able to birth more than a dozen in one go...

Furthermore, to Huang Xiaolong’s knowledge, the more a powerful a person was, the more their reproduction rate was reduced. This was also the reason why some God Realm cultivators, and even Highgod Realm masters only had one child even after ten thousand years or more.

God Realm and Highgod Realm masters’ lifespans were much longer. They lived several thousand years to several tens of thousands of years, thus they couldn’t be like mortals, giving birth every few years.

The night came to an end.

At the break of dawn, the Ascending Moon Old Man left the Golden Dragon Peak. Before leaving, the old man did not forget to take away some of the wine that Huang Xiaolong brew, but he did not want Huang Xiaolong to send him off. With an instant Great Space Shift, he was thousands of miles away from the Black Warrior Institute. As for where he teleported to, which world surface, Huang Xiaolong was left wondering to himself.

Huang Xiaolong stood where he was for a long time even after the Ascending Moon Old Man left before walking back to his own yard.

Days continued to pass as seasons changed. Just like that, another year went by.

Despite knowing the several thousand pill formulas of the Thousand Worlds Sect like the back of his hand, in the past one year, Huang Xiaolong religiously dedicated the morning of every day to alchemy.

Huang Xiaolong would spend the latter part of the day cultivating his battle skills. In over a decade’s time, he had started practicing the other moves of the Asura Sword Skill, and although he had yet to reach major completion, their attack power could not be underestimated.

At night, Huang Xiaolong continued to refine the godforce and God’s Law contained within the godhead.

In this one year, Huang Xiaolong, who was already a peak mid-Sixth Order God Realm finally broke into late-Sixth Order God Realm!

Having godforce from the godhead continuously tempering Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique over the years, his originally freakish True Dragon Physique was now even more monstrous, causing his power and defense to reach a shocking level.

To test his physique, Huang Xiaolong tried to draw blood from his finger using the Mulberry Sword, but his skin withstood it. Only when he exerted full force to penetrate the layer of skin did it leave a tiny wound. Striking a punch at a palm-sized lump of Divine World ore, he could shatter it into over a hundred smaller pieces.

From time to time, Huang Xiaolong would visit his parents and others.

In these years, Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Xiaohai, Huang Min, and the others’ strength had increased at a shocking pace. Eleven years ago, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and most of the others had just broken into the Saint realm, and now, eleven years later, most of them had reached Third Order Saint realm!

Though their rapid improvement was due to consuming Hailstone Divine Pellets every day when cultivating, as well as the abundant spiritual energy gathered by the Five-colored Divine Banner, it was still an amazing progress.

As for Xie Puti, he spent his days and nights cultivating inside his own yard, hence his strength enhancement exceeded Huang Peng and the others, reaching late-Third Order Saint realm.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong was practicing his pill refining skills when his Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun and Third Apprentice-sister Qi Wen came to visit him. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Over the years, both of them had made several visits to the Golden Dragon Peak, however, worried that they might be disturbing the Ascending Moon Old Man when he was guiding Huang Xiaolong in alchemy, they would always leave after a brief stay.

Huang Xiaolong was extremely happy as he welcomed them.

Meeting again after a long time, it was inevitable to exchange some perfunctory greetings. While they were talking, Liu Yun suddenly asked, “Fourth Junior Apprentice-brother, I heard from Master that Senior Ascending Moon wants you to participate in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and admitted, “Yes, I heard from the old man that this time’s Alchemist Grandmaster Competition will very likely have an additional reward for the first place winner, a godhead.”

Liu Yun and QiWen exchanged a smile, probably only Huang Xiaolong dared to call Senior Ascending Moon ‘old man’, if any other person dared to do so, that was like lamenting they had lived for too long.

“Fourth Junior Apprentice-brother, I heard that Xiang Mingzhi is also participating in this Alchemist Grandmaster Competition.” Qi Wen spoke.

“Oh, Xiang Mingzhi that guy is also participating?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.

Liu Yun nodded, “Yes. Xiang Mingzhi is the Azure Dragon Institute Principal’s personal disciple, not only is his cultivation talent is amazing, even his alchemy talent is astonishing. From the rumors going around, it is said that his alchemy talent is by no means weaker than his cultivation talent. He also stated confidently that he will win the first place of this term’s Alchemist Grandmaster Competition.”

The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved into a sly devious smile, “Is that so? It’s been some years since I last saw him, I still remember how I burst his little birdie with one kick. I think he wouldn’t forget either.”

Qi Wen couldn’t resist bursting into laughter hearing that.

That year, Huang Xiaolong directed a merciless kick at Xiang Mingzhi’s lower part before the audience during the inner disciples’ assessment. Qi Wen remembered that scene clearly.

Liu Yun also couldn’t help laughing, “I’m sure he did not forget, and he also knows that you learned alchemy from Senior Ascending Moon. This time, he let out word that he will win the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition’s first place, it is obvious that he’s aiming to defeat you. But, other than the Azure Dragon Institute’s Xiang Mingzhi, there’s also the Vermillion Bird Institute Principal’s personal disciple He Feifan, and the White Tiger Institute Principal’s personal disciple Wan Zhengxing, all of them will be participating in the competition. The latter two people are also skilled in alchemy.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, he had met that Vermillion Bird Institute Principal’s personal disciple He Feifan once before when he went to visit Shi Xiaofei in the land of new moon. At that time, He Feifan was visiting Shi Xiaofei’s Master, Yang Yi.

But Huang Xiaolong did not expect He Feifan to be participating in the competition as well. Despite having seen He Feifan only once, Huang Xiaolong did not have a good impression of him. He remembered clearly that He Feifan unknowingly exposed his killing intent at that time.

“That He Feifan is a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm. In the last Highgod Advancement Tournament, I exchanged a few moves with him, he’s slightly stronger than me.” Afraid that Huang Xiaolong might have a misconception about these people’s strength, Liu Yun explained, “As for that Wan Zhenxing, he is also a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm with unfathomable strength, if Fourth Junior Apprentice-brother runs into them, act with caution, especially when facing that He Feifan.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded seriously, “Eldest Apprentice-brother, rest assured, I will pay attention.”

“Is younger sister-in-law still in the land of new moon?” Qi Wen suddenly asked. “When will we get to attend your wedding banquet?”

Huang Xiaolong was dazed for a moment before smiling, “Third Apprentice-sister is talking about me, but what about you and Eldest Apprentice-brother? I’ve been waiting for a long time to drink at your banquet.”

The subtle relationship between Liu Yun and Qi Wen did not escape Huang Xiaolong’s notice.

Teased by Huang Xiaolong, a tinge of blush colored Qi Wen’s delicate face, but Liu Yun seemed a little dispirited as if there was something difficult to talk about.
