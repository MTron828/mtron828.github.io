Chapter 3080: Ice Orchid Banquet

It wasn’t strange that Wang Yuanhai and Wen Zeming’s faces worsened when they heard that the death beasts were going to attack Origin Heavenly Cave in the end. By now, they had seen the horror of these death beasts. Honestly, at this point, anyone would ashen at the mention of these death beasts. If one of the beast kings were to personally lead an attack on the Origin Heavenly Cave, there could only be one tragic ending.

Despite the Origin Heavenly Cave having the World Master, and being guarded by the great Origin Army, more than a handful of super creeds, powerful chamber of commerce, and genesis races, it was hard to say if the Origin Heavenly Cave could fend off the death beasts!

“Lord, should we move the headquarters out of the Origin Heavenly Cave?” Wen Zeming asked without a second of hesitation.

Zhou Shu shook his head when he heard that. “This headquarters has stood for a long time. How can it be moved so simply? Moreover, if we flee before a fight, how will other creeds, chambers of commerce, and the World Master see us?”

“Even if a death beast king really comes, our Origin Heavenly Cave’s human race experts might not necessarily be worse than them,” Zhou Shu pointed out unhurriedly.

One-third of the human race’s Extermination List’s top ten experts were in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

……

In the quiet and tranquil deep night…

Huang Xiaolong stood in the center yard of the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce’s main building, and Lei Yu, Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, Old Monster Flame, and other experts stood behind him.

“Is Xiao Tianqi at the World Manor?” Hunag Xiaolong asked Wind Cloud Dao Venerable.

Xiao Tianqi was the Origin Holy World Master’s given name.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable shook his head as he answered, “It is said that the World Master left the Origin Holy World some time back. No one is clear where he went. Some say that he went to the Death Beasts Peril Land, while some claim that the World Master entered the Heavens Burial Lands. There are also a few that say that the World Master has gone to the Origin Lands.”

The Origin Lands were as famous as the Death Beasts Peril Land and Heavens Burial Lands, and it was one of the dangerous places of Origin Holy World.

It was said that the Origin Lands was the oldest place in the Origin Holy World, and it hadOrigin Lands existed before the Origin Holy World had come to be.

“The Origin Lands,” Huang Xiaolong repeated under his breath. Legend has it that all origin qi in the Huang Long World originated from the Origin Lands.

Once in a blue moon, the Mystical Pavilion would auction a few strands of origin qi that were obtained by their experts through expeditions into the Origin Lands. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Further to this myth, some believed that the Origin Holy World’s number one genesis treasure, the Tree of Origin was in the Origin Lands.

These kinds of rumors might not have been completely baseless. A large part of origin qi was found in the Land of origin. Hence, there was a very high chance that the Tree of Origin was indeed in the Origin Lands.

Still, this remained an unproven conjecture as no one had seen the Tree of Origin from the beginning of the world until now.

“Who’s managing the World Manor’s affairs now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable answered respectfully, “The smaller matters are handled by the Prince of Origin, His Highness Xiao Yuncheng, but the more important matters are overseen by Yang Yuyuan.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. Yang Yuyuan was an existence in the top twenty ranks of the Extermination List. He ranked sixteenth and was the strongest of Xiao Tianqi’s subordinates, and he was the person on whom Xiao Tianqi relied the most. Ninety percent of the Origin Army was under Yang Yuyuan’s command, and in the World Manor, Yang Yuyuan’s authority was only second to World Master Xiao Tianqi. Giving Yang Yuyuan command of ninety percent of the Origin Army was a statement of how much Xiao Tianqi trusted Yang Yuyuan.

“The World Manor’s treasury, can Yang Yuyuan access it?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked.

He had traveled so far to the Origin Heavenly Cave for the Mystical Pavilion Branch’s Liquid of Life, Genesis Lightning Water, Dazzling Golden Stone, peak-grade Phoenix Fire Crystal, and also the Green Wind Wings and Profound Concentrated Earth inside the World Manor’s treasury.

Wind Cloud Dao Venerable was too stunned to react for a moment, then shook his head and said, “The World Manor’s treasury is guarded by ten great experts. Only the person holding the World Master’s token or the World Master himself can open the treasury. The World Master has always carried his token on him.”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows furrowed as he listened, thinking inwardly, ‘Do I have to wait until Xiao Tianqi returns?’

Huang Xiaolong also asked about the situations of other chambers of commerce and creeds located in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

A while later, Wind Cloud Dao Venerable took his leave.

“Your Highness, are we going to the World Manor tomorrow?” Lei Yu asked. “With Xiao Tianqi absent, we can break into the treasury and take away the Greed Wind Wings and Profound Concentrate Earth.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “We’ll talk about it later.”

He wasn’t afraid of Xiao Tianqi but it was unnecessary to cause a grudge just to get his hands on the Green Wind Wings and Profound Concentrate Earth When Xiao Tianqi returned. Instead, he could make a transaction with Xiao Tianqi with other items.

“Tomorrow, we’ll go to the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce,” Huang Xiaolong stated.

According to Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce’s treasury could have the Liquid of Life, and Dazzling Golden Stone, and the amount of Liquid of Life was probably not little. Still, this was merely Wind Cloud Dao Venerable’s estimation, not a hundred percent certainty.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong decided to take a look at the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce. Not to mention, the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce’s Ice Orchid Pill was renowned throughout the Origin Holy World, being one of the top ten genesis level pills, and he had long wanted to replenish his stock of genesis pills.

The night passed peacefully.

Early the next day, Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, Old Monster Flame, and the others left Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce Headquarters, and headed to the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce.

The Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce’s location was not far away. Based on the speed of Huang Xiaolong’s group, it would only take five or six days for them to reach there.

“Young Lady, that Highness has already left,” Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, a maid went to report to Feng Yuxuan.

“He left?” Feng Yuxuan had not expected that Huang Xiaolong would leave after only staying one night at the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce.

“Do you know where he’s going?” Feng Yuxuan asked her maid.

“I’ve heard they are headed to the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce Headquarters,” the maid answered. Huang Xiaolong had mentioned his destination to Wind Cloud Dao Venerable before departing, deliberately not hiding his whereabouts. Therefore, the maid had easily found out after some simple inquiring.

“What is he doing at the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce?” Feng Yuxuan’s brows creased in confusion.

“Is he going to attend the Ice Orchid Banquet?” The maid made a guess.

Every ten thousand years, the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce would hold an event called the Ice Orchid Banquet, and top experts were invited as guests. Of course, those that were not invited also could join the merriment as long as one had entered Dao Venerable Realm. The coming Ice Orchid Banquet was only a few days away.

The Ice Orchid Banquet was a major event for the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce, and in every banquet, the President would appear. Hence, there were many experts who were willing to attend the banquet.

“Ice Orchid Banquet…” Feng Yuxuan’s eyes glimmered and she abruptly rose from her seat, “Go prepare, we’re going there as well!”

“Young Lady, you want to go?” The maid was surprised. The Ice Orchid Banquet had taken place many times and her young lady had been invited every time, but her young lady had never once attended the event.

……

Five days later, Huang Xiaolong, Lei Yu, and the others arrived at the Ice Orchid City where the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce Headquarters was located.

“This Ice Orchid City is really pretty,” Huang Xiaolong commented as he looked at the Ice Orchid City that seemed to be carved out of a large piece of ice jade, sighing in admiration.

Lei Yu nodded in agreement, “Binglan that old woman is prettier still.” He was talking about the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce’s president, and so rarely, there was a lecherous expression on Lei Yu’s face.
