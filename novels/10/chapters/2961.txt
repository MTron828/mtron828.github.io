Chapter 2962: Alarming Many Old Monsters

Though the black-eyed poisonous spiders had amazing speed, it was still slightly slower compared to the speed of a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert fleeing. Huang Xiaolong could only watch Ancestor Xuan grab Bing Jun and flee.

However, when the other Frost Eye Race’s experts wanted to escape through the entrance, Huang Xiaolong knocked them with one absolute frost power punch, sealing all of them under a thick layer of icefrost.

Huang Xiaolong did away the restraints placed on Feng Yue and her group. Feng Yue stared worriedly at the closing entrance and urged anxiously, “Xiaolong, we should leave this place quickly, my Eye of Frost was taken away by that Bing Jun!”

If the entrance were to close and disappear without the Eye of Frost to open it again, they would be stuck there.

Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong acted swiftly. He recalled all the black-eyed poisonous spiders, and with a wave of his hands, Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the rest were brought out through the shrinking icy blue hole. But in the last moments, Huang Xiaolong paused briefly in the air, and grabbed the remaining Frost Eye Race’s experts as well.

These Frost Eye Race’s experts were useful to Huang Xiaolong. He could learn where the Frost Eye Race currently lived, and at the same time, he needed high-level Dao Venerable Realm experts to supply the Sun Moon Furnace with cosmos energy for his cultivation, it was a good thing that amongst these Frost Eye Race’s experts, there were four Seventh Esteem Dao Venerables.

Feng Yue watched the entrance disappear with relief in her eyes, and her back was dampened with cold sweat.

Huang Xiaolong sealed the several Frost Eye Race’s experts’ strength and threw them into the dragon pearl, then flew off with Feng Yue’s group.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yue, and the others stopped above an uninhabited land.

“Xiaolong, Bing Jun and Ancestor Xuan escaped, so the news that you’ve gotten the Tree of Beginning would spread quickly. Numerous experts would rush to the Immortal Creed, so we’d better leave here as soon as possible,” Feng Yue said, worrying for Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, shaking his head. “It’ll be fine, we’ll deal with your injuries here and leave when everyone’s okay.” He could see that Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the others had quite a few injuries on them. It would be best to deal with these wounds soon.

His words warmed Feng Yue’s heart.

“Don’t worry because except for some old monsters, others are not my opponents,” Huang Xiaolong said reassuringly.

Feng Yue froze and nodded her head stiffly. With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength and those scary black-eyed poisonous spiders, there weren’t many people that could deter Huang Xiaolong, and thinking of this, Feng Yue no longer insisted.

When Feng Yue was going to take out healing pellets, Huang Xiaolong took out some blue lotus nectar and said, “Take this, for you guys.”

“Blue lotus nectar!” Feng Yue was surprised by Huang Xiaolong’s generosity, and she waved her hands adamantly. “No, it’s too precious, we…”

“Listen to me, I still have a lot,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Moreover, this blue lotus nectar isn’t very useful to me.”

Feng Yue was flabbergasted, a wry smile tugged at the corners of her lips. There was actually someone that disdained the blue lotus nectar’s efficacy.

In the end, Feng Yue accepted Huang Xiaolong’s blue lotus nectar, and her gaze on Huang Xiaolong was much softer than before.

Huang Xiaolong gave Elder Tong and the others a drop of blue lotus nectar each, but they dared not accept it. They looked at Feng Yue. Only after Feng Yue nodded her head did they thank Huang Xiaolong and accept Huang Xiaolong’s blue lotus nectar.

With the blue lotus nectar and Huang Xiaolong’s assistance, their injuries healed faster than usual, and they almost returned to their peak conditions in several days.

When Feng Yue’s group had recovered, they no longer lingered around and hurried away from the Immortal Creed nonstop.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group left the Immortal Creed, the news began to circulate.

“The Tree of Beginning has appeared! It’s in the Son of Creation Huang Xiaolong’s hands!”

“For real, the Tree of Beginning? It won't be a fake rumor, right?!”

“It’s one hundred percent true! Straight from the horse’s mouth, Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yue entered the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, and Huang Xiaolong got the Tree of Beginning there! Ancestor Xuan said that Huang Xiaolong admitted it!”

The news hit the Divine Tuo Holy World like a bomb.

Not long after, many hidden Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts began to surface, and some very ancient peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable old monsters.

Even events like the Creation Ceremony held by ten top-tier creeds like the Dragon Fish Creed couldn’t pique their interests, but with the Tree of Beginning thrown into the equation, these old monsters were more than eager to come out from their nests.

Another storm was brewing in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

At the Dragon Fish Creed headquarters, the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng was dazed for a long time after hearing the news. A bitter smile gradually formed on his face as he muttered, “His Highness’ luck is a bit too good, as he even got a treasure like the Tree of Beginning.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Red Fox Creed Patriarch Hu Qingye, Divination Creed Patriarch Wu Kun, and the others also had complicated expressions on their faces.

It would be a lie to say they were not tempted by the Tree of Beginning.

“I’ve heard the Poison Bodach is preparing to make a move!” Wu Kun stated, and at the mention of Poison Bodach, these peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables involuntarily revealed a trace of trepidation.

“Not only the Poison Bodach, but the Nine-headed Tree Demon, and Sword Venerable are also coming out!” Hu Qingye’s thin brows were tightly locked together, “It’s too dangerous for His Highness to be out there alone!”

Bi Cheng let out a heavy sigh. “Yes ah, I’ve already released the word, persuading His Highness to come back, but with His Highness’ temper, it’s unlikely that he’ll accept the protection from our ten creeds. If something happens to His Highness, I won’t be able to face Lord Huang Long, and at that point, I can only use my life to atone for my sins.”

He was one of the vassals under the God of Creation, and what he was today was built on the God of Creation’s grace. If a mishap were to fall on Huang Xiaolong, he would really use his life for atonement.

In truth, the God of Creation also had grace for the other nine creeds’ patriarchs.

“It is imperative that we find His Highness as soon as possible.” Wu Kun said utmost solemnly, “Even if His Highness is unwilling to accept our protection, we as vassals have an obligation to ensure that His Highness is safe!”

Bi Cheng and the others nodded, agreeing to Wu Kun’s words.

Xuanyuan Potian, who had been abolished from his Xuanyuan Creed young patriarch’s position and was currently imprisoned in the Xuanyuan Creed’s forbidden land, laughed hysterically when he heard the news. “Huang Xiaolong, death’s coming for you! When those old monsters come for you, you will end up worse than me. Those old monsters don’t give a d*mn about your Son of Creation identity!”

Huang Xiaolong had no idea of the furor going on outside.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was somewhere in an uninhabited land within the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave.

After leaving the Immortal Creed, Huang Xiaolong had separated from Feng Yue’s group. Feng Yue’s group had headed back to the Traversing Wind Creed, and Huang Xiaolong had given Feng Yue a Fruit of Beginning and a big pond of Frost Jade Cold Water before she left.

Feng Yue had the Wind Awn Dao Physique, and the Frost Jade Cold Water would be extremely beneficial to her. Moreover, with her talent of ten high-order Saint Fates, who knew, maybe she would have the ability to wield the power of absolute frost in the future. The benefit of the Fruit of Beginning needed no explanation.

However, after accepting the Fruit of Beginning and Frost Jade Cold Water from Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yue gave him a quick peck on his face, sending Huang Xiaolong’s heart topsy-turvy.

He had no other meaning in giving the two items to Feng Yue. Feng Yue had invited him to open the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, and because of that he had gained the Tree of Beginning and Frost Jade Cold Water to her. Whereas, Feng Yue and her group’s harvest was robbed clean by Ancestor Xuan, so Huang Xiaolong thought of giving her some compensation.

Before leaving, Feng Yue also said a sentence, “I’ll wait for you at the Traversing Wind Creed! Forever!”

Huang Xiaolong’s little liver quivered in fright at this sentence.

Huang Xiaolong had come to this uninhabited land after separating from Feng Yue. This is the place he had chosen for his seclusion to refine the two hundred plus Fruits of Beginning. It was enough for him to advance to Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, maybe even to Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!
