Chapter 3698 – Secret

No matter how hard Wu Fu racked his brains, he couldn’t remember an expert in the Unknown Space called Huang Xiaolong.

From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong was pretty strong. He should be a pretty famous figure in the Unknown Space, and he should have heard of Huang Xiaolong’s name! However, that wasn’t the case!

Mo Ren’s expression sank and he growled, “Why are you still standing there?!”

As the patriarch of a race, no one dared to speak to him with such disrespect. Moreover, he didn’t recognize Mo Ren. “Who do you think you are to order me around?!”

Whatever the case, he knew that he couldn’t afford to fight Mo Ren. Waving his hand, he ordered the members of the Wavering Light Devil Race, “Let’s go!”

A ray of cold light flashed through Mo Ren’s eyes. Right before he could take care of them, Huang Xiaolong stopped him. “It’s alright. We’ll deal with this after we get back.”

If Mo Ren attacked, they would have to deal with a lot more random matters.

He was there for the Nameless Devil Mirror.

Mo Ren eventually nodded and he stood behind Huang Xiaolong silently.

Even though the Wavering Light Devil Race was there to mess around, Huang Xiaolong’s mood wasn’t dampened in the slightest.

He looked at the mirror and he discovered that it looked exactly like any other mirror. However, something changed when he looked at it for a long time. Weird visions appeared in his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong paused for a second as he closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them again, he saw the same visions.

There was no way he could be mistaken!

After watching it for some time, he closed his eyes only to discover that the image had appeared in his mind.

The image was too blurry and he couldn’t make out anything specific.

After some time, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes to observe the mirror.

It didn’t take long before another image appeared.

Mo Ren stood beside Huang Xiaolong and he noticed that Huang Xiaolong would close his eyes occasionally. A confused expression soon appeared on his face.

No matter how he tried to observe the mirror, he couldn’t make out anything!

There was nothing special on the mirror, and the only thing special about it was that it was floating in mid air!

Mo Ren wasn’t the only one. No one else could see anything in the mirror. No matter who it was, the images didn’t appear no matter how hard they looked.

Just like that, Huang Xiaolong spent an entire day.

After so long, the images finally started to turn a little clearer.

In the past, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see anything in the image. However, he finally understood what it held after an entire day of comprehension.

The image seemed to depict something in the Thirteen Universes.

Of course, he wasn’t able to see the entire image properly.

As night fell, the image turned completely dark and Huang Xiaolong could no longer see the half blurry image.

No matter how hard he tried, nothing happened.

Huang Xiaolong could only choose to give up and return to the palace.

When he did, he entered his courtyard to think about the image that he saw in the mirror.

He could feel that there was something special about the image.

It seemed to contain a secret of the Thirteen Universes.

As for Mo Ren, he sent down an order to summon Wu Xin, the old ancestor of the Wavering Light Devil Race, to enter the palace. In his summons, Wu Xin was to bring Wu Fu and the Wavering Light Prince along.

When the old ancestor of the Wavering Light Devil Race saw the messenger from the imperial palace, he was shocked.

“Lord… Lord Mo Ren requested my presence?!” Wu Xin couldn't believe his ears.

He might be the old ancestor of the Wavering Light Devil Race, but their race was too weak to catch the eye of the celestial empire.

The envoy sent by the celestial empire was an official in the imperial palace, and he replied, “That’s right. Please enter the palace with me in order to not keep Lord Mo Ren waiting. Lord Mo Ren has also requested for you to bring Wu Fu and Wu He.”

Wu Xin felt that something bad was going to happen when he heard what the official said. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Ren’s summons might make sense if he was to go alone. However, now that he wanted to see Wu Fu and Wu He, something might go wrong.

He couldn’t understand why Mo Ren would want to meet them!

“Why would Lord Mo Ren want to meet them?” Wu Xin asked cautiously while handing over a spatial ring.

After accepting it, the official remained impassive. “I have no idea. Why would a subordinate like myself know what Lord Mo Ren thinks?”

“You’ll know when you meet him later.”

Wu Xin suppressed the worry in his heart and he chuckled, “Right…”

Soon after, Wu Fu and Wu He were summoned.

“Lord Father, why would Lord Mo Ren ask for us?” Wu Fu asked.

Wu Xin’s expression was dark as he growled, “Did you clash with a prince or princess of the royal family?!”

Wu Fu thought of what happened recently and he frowned. “No, we didn’t.”

Wu Xin’s frown became deeper. Even if they messed with a prince or princess of the celestial empire, Lord Mo Ren wouldn’t look for them personally!

When they were thinking hard about the reason behind the summon, they entered the main hall.

That was the first time they were entering the imperial palace, and they found it hard to breathe when faced with the suffocating aura coming from the pillars.

They lowered their heads the moment they entered.

“You should be curious as to the reason behind my summons.” Mo Ren said as he sat on the throne. “Raise your heads and look at me.”

The three of them slowly raised their heads when they heard him.

The instant they saw his face, Wu Fu and Wu He felt a bomb going off in their minds. They felt as though the world was turning dark around them.

Wu Xin felt his heart coming to a stop when he saw their reactions.

“What’s wrong? Don’t you recognize me?” Mo Ren growled.

“We… We do…” Wu Fu stuttered and Wu He felt his legs going soft.

“Who do you think I am?” A snort left Mo Ren’s lips.

Wu Fu fell to his knees and started kowtowing profusely. “Lord… Lord Mo Ren, we didn’t know that it’s you! We were wrong! Please spare our lives.”
