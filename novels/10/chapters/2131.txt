Chapter 2132: Do You Really Think That The Heavenly World Can’t Do Anything To You?!

Tian Chen revealed a shocked expression as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. According to what Wan Shi had said, all they had to do was to work together in order to suppress Huang Xiaolong. After all, the only reason Huang Xiaolong had managed to gain the upper hand in the past was because of his lightning bead!

His previous attack was no weaker than when Wan Shi had used the full strength of his Great Purity Secret Art. However, Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi had blocked off his attack. That wasn’t all. The residual of his sword qi had managed to force the both of them back!

Wan Shi looked at Tian Chen as their expressions sank.

It was clear that they had never expected Huang Xiaolong’s strength to rise so dramatically in the past three years.

When the Dark Curses Old Ancestor and the others saw what happened, their bodies trembled.

The scene of Wan Shi and Tian Chen being beaten back even after joining forces caused their tiny little souls to shake.

When they were still stuck in a state of shock, several figures shot into the skies. The person in the lead was none other than Huang Xiaolong as the little cow and the others trailed behind him.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong’s sudden appearance, everyone who wanted to assist Tian Chen in getting rid of him, took a step back subconsciously.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with them as he stared at Tian Chen’s blade. “Good blade!”

No sh*t!

With his experience, he could easily tell that the blade in Tian Chen’s hand was a peak grade supreme spiritual treasure!

The only reason Tian Chen could unleash such overwhelming strength was because of that blade of his! A single weapon allowed him to be as strong as Wan Shi, who executed the highest level of his Grand Purity Secret Art!

It also went without saying that the blade in Tian Chen’s hand wasn’t an ordinary supreme spiritual treasure.

A fire ignited in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

The Radiance Divine Scepter, City of Eternity, and even the Ancient Heavenly Court were a little lacking when it came to firepower. He was still looking for ways to upgrade the Ancient Heavenly Court to a supreme spiritual treasure. Now that there was one sitting in front of him, there wasn’t a need to think about it.

The giant blade in Tian Chen’s arm was perfectly suited for Huang Xiaolong’s use.

Diagrams of angels and devils were etched onto the blade, and a combination of darkness energy and radiance energy swirled about on it. It was clear that the blade possessed both attributes.

When Tian Chen looked at Huang Xiaolong, eyeing his treasured blade, realization dawned in his heart. He would be mentally handicapped if he didn’t understand the look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. His face turned red in anger when he thought about how the other party raided his treasury, and now, they had their sights on his treasured blade!

The blade was the thing he cherished the most in his life! Ever since obtaining the blade, he had devoted his life to it. Right now, Huang Xiaolong dared to set his sights on the one thing Tian Chen treasured the most!

“Huang Xiaolong!” Tian Chen growled as his expression sank below the freezing point. “Today, you ignored the rules of the Heavenly World. You dared to kill Di Jing from our law enforcement faction, and you dared to barge into my personal palace! You killed several hundred thousand of my personal guards before raiding my treasury! You stole my chaos lightning pool and all my origin treasures! Do you really think that my Heavenly World can’t do anything to you?!”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape.

Chaos lightning pool?! All the origin treasures?!

“You had better hand them all over to me now.” Tian Chen sneered. ”I can pretend as though nothing happened as long as you give me all my treasures back.”

All the experts who were watching the battle stared at Tian Chen in shock.

Pretend as though nothing happened?!

When they thought about Huang Xiaolong’s terrifying show of strength, they realized the reason behind Tian Chen’s words.

Tian Chen, who was ready to kill, had no choice but to back down after experiencing Huang Xiaolong’s strength. This was probably the furthest he would be willing to go.

It was an utter humiliation for them to force Huang Xiaolong to hand over everything before letting him go after he killed a disciple of the law enforcement faction of the Heavenly World. There was no need to mention how he killed hundreds of thousands of Tian Chen’s personal guards before raiding his treasury.

From what they knew, Tian Chen had no choice but to back down. After all, the Heavenly Master was still in seclusion.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed when he heard Tian Chen’s threat, “There is no way I’ll hand over the chaos lightning pool.” Since the chaos lightning pools concerned the fate of his senior brother, there was no room for negotiation.

He turned to look at the little cow as the corner of his lips curled upwards. “Neither will we hand over the origin treasures...”

Huang Xiaolong’s words caused Tian Chen’s expression to change once again. Rage burned in his heart, and the killing intent that he tried so hard to suppress erupted.

“Huang Xiaolong, you better watch yourself! It seems like you’re planning to go against my Heavenly World! Even if my brother hasn’t left seclusion, I can still kill you!” No longer holding back his rage, Tian Chen raised his head and roaded at the sky. The blade in his hand emitted terrifying rays of light that seemed to respond to his fearsome intent to slay Huang Xiaolong.

“Brother Wan Shi, assist me!”

“Sure!” The aura around Wan Shi’s body started to rise as battle intent rolled off him.

He had long since known what Tian Chen wanted to do.

Slowly approaching Tian Chen, he placed his hands on his back before transferring copious amounts of energy into Tian Chen’s body. A surge of strength burst out from Tian Chen as a cracking sound filled the Heavenly World. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The sound came from inside Tian Chen’s body, and it rang loud and clear through the Heavenly World. It even entered the ears of those hiding in a secluded corner somewhere in the world.

It was as though a giant egg had finally hatched.

Along with the intense cracking sound, the world seemed to crack. Boundless golden light poured into Tian Chen’s body from the depths of the Heavenly World.

The aura around his body started to soar and the aura he emitted soon surpassed Wan Shi!

One had to know that Wan Shi was an early-Eighth Order Sovereign! Tian Chen, who had barely broken into the high-level Sovereign Realm, was actually able to transform into an existence whose strength surpassed Wan Shi. It caused no small amount of shock to the Dark Curses Old Ancestor and the others.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but take him seriously.

“Xiaolong, watch out!” The little cow and the others yelled in shock.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He had never expected Tian Chen to be able to call upon the power of the Heavenly World in order to increase his strength. As the Heavenly World stood above the myriad of worlds, the source energy wasn’t something the five greater worlds could match. The source energy of the Divine World was less than half of that of the Heavenly World, and it was clear how terrifying the source energy of the Heavenly World was.

Even so, Tian Chen was only able to call upon a small part of the source energy. Despite that, it was scary enough.

Tian Chen’s strength only stopped when it rose to the mid-Eighth Order Sovereign Realm.

“Huang Xiaolong, I have already fused with the source energy of the Heavenly World. Unless you’re stronger than the entirety of the Heavenly World, you’re going to die here today!” Tian Chen glared at Huang Xiaolong as the killing intent around him turned solid. He pointed his blade at Huang Xiaolong as he officially declared war!
