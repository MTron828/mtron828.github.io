Half an hour later, a booming crash reverberated through the air. Finally, the little cow had broken the Spirit World’s Great Dead Souls’ Formation with void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s assistance. The antique mirror was finally exposed in front of them.

Huang Xiaolong and the others walked towards it.

Standing right in front of the mirror, Huang Xiaolong reached out to hold it; strangely, the antique mirror felt weightless like a feather in his hand.

There were dense green-colored lines on the front side of the mirror. These lines looked like some kind of ancient symbols that formed an ancient formation. The back of the mirror had faint black stripes that corresponds with the ancient symbols on the front side; it was another ancient formation. The only difference between them was the color.

Other than these ancient formations, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see anything special about the antique mirror.

Huang Xiaolong carefully inspected the mirror from all angles, but still couldn’t find any clues, hence, he handed it over to the little cow and said, “Do you recognize this ancient artifact?”

The little cow studied the antique mirror for some time, and doubt appeared in her eyes, but she refrained from speaking.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest came over, each looked curiously at the antique mirror, but none of them could recognize what it was.

“The ancient Heavenly Court had a magic mirror named Nine Yin Magic Mirror that could restrain the soul of the person reflected in the mirror. It was extremely powerful. This antique mirror slightly resembles that it, but it is also different." The little cow said.

The Nine Yin Magic Mirror could restrain a person’s soul!

Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, and others were astounded by this information.

"What’s the difference?" Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow pointed at the backside of the mirror, "The Nine Yin Magic Mirror is the same on both sides, but this antique mirror’s front and back is different. However, the strange thing is, half of this antique mirror has the same aura as the Nine Yin Magic Mirror and its one side looks exactly the same as the Nine Yin Magic Mirror!"

Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity was stoked. He asked, “Could it be that a peerless master reforged the Nine Yin Magic Mirror that might have given this mirror its current shape?"

The little cow said, "Maybe, but this Nine Yin Magic Mirror is an evil object. If you want to refine it as yours, you must be cautious. The Nine Yin Magic Mirror is the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s sacred item from Hell’s Spirit World. So, you better not expose this mirror in front of others. If the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe were to find out about it, they will come to snatch it away from you!"

"The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe!" Void devil beast Xu Baisheng exclaimed with an ashen face.

Huang Xiaolong asked, “Is this Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe very strong?"

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng explained with a serious expression, “They are not just strong, but they are the Spirit World’s hegemon. The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had once united the entire Spirit World, and had even lead an army of one trillion Spirit World’s experts to attack the Divine World!"

Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er sucked in an air of cold breath.

"What happened after that?" Huang Xiaolong urged.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng continued, "The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe fought the whole of the ancient Heavenly God Realm, but they lost because the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had the Heavenly Court artifact. The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor suffered serious injuries, thus they were left with no choice but to retreat back to the Spirit World!"

"Even so, half of the Divine World were destroyed when the Spirit World had attacked. Countless world surfaces’ were bathed in blood, with countless experts and living beings slaughtered! Families and sects’ Ancestors were killed, leaving piles of corpses that were as high as mountain!"

Everyone’s hearts were shaken imagining these scenes.

Half of the Divine World was destroyed!

What kind of strength did the Spirit World have to do that!

If the Vientiane World’s human forces and the sea tribe were to be united, how powerful would that be? Yet the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield has more than ten thousand world surfaces similar to the Vientiane World, and some of these world surfaces’ overall forces were many times stronger than the Vientiane World. However, these world surfaces could only be considered as rural villages, perhaps, even lower than that.

How powerful was half of the Divine World, and how vast was it?!

While these thoughts emerged in Huang Xiaolong’s mind, the little cow gave Xu Baisheng’s head a big knuckle, and chided, “Don’t frighten everyone! Although the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe is strong, they could destroy half of the Divine World only because they had help from the whole of the Spirit World’s forces, Hell’s Asura World and Ghost World!”

Hell’s Asura World and Ghost World, on top of that, the Spirit World, that was the entire underworld’s forces!

The little cow then said, “Close to the end, the Devil World also joined in the raid. Unfortunately, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor was in seclusion at that time, as he was in the middle of comprehending a cultivation technique. The Divine World was completely caught off guard, which resulted in such a tragedy!”

Huang Xiaolong’s tension loosened.

The little cow went on, “In that year, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor killed countless of Ancestor generation masters with the help of Nine Yin Magic Mirror. In the end, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor was heavily injured by the Ancient Heavenly Emperor. At that time,the Ancient Heavenly Emperor also confiscated the Nine Yin Magic Mirror.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Huang Xiaolong fell into contemplation, ‘if the Nine Yin Magic Mirror had fallen into the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s hands, why is it sealed here? Did the Ancient Heavenly Emperor come here in the past?’

Another question was, did the Ancient Heavenly Emperor feel that the Nine Yin Magic Mirror was too nefarious that he reforged it into its current shape?

Huang Xiaolong still couldn’t determine whether the mirror in his hand was the Nine Yin Magic Mirror or not. But since the little cow had said that the backside of this mirror was similar to the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, he believed that nine out of ten, this antique mirror was a reduced version of the Nine Yin Magic Mirror.

Huang Xiaolong circulated his supreme godforce as he tried to activate the antique mirror, but he soon found out that his godforce couldn’t enter the antique mirror. Subsequently, he squeezed a drop of blood essence on the antique mirror, however, the antique mirror did not absorb his blood essence at all; the drop of his blood simply slid off the mirror to the ground.

He tried other methods that he could think of to own the antique mirror, but none worked.

Huang Xiaolong looked dejectedly at the little cow.

The little cow explained with serious tone, “There are some ancient divine artifacts that could only be refined with unique methods.” She paused, then added, “Most likely, only the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor or Patriarch knows of the method to refine this Nine Yin Magic Mirror.”

Huang Xiaolong truly felt depressed.

“Maybe, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor would have been aware of the method.” The little cow supplemented.

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless by the little cow’s additional words as they carried the same meaning that he would be unable to refine the mirror!

Since the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had died long ago, where was he going to find him to inquire of the right method?

In the next second, Huang Xiaolong saw a ray of light. Maybe, if he could find the Ancient Heavenly Court artifact, and refined it. Who knows, maybe he could find out the method to refine the Nine Yin Magic Mirror from the Ancient Heavenly Emperor’s remnant memories.

But, for now, Huang Xiaolong could only put the antique mirror into his Ghost Buddha Ring. He would study it later.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said as he started flying towards the center of the Soulless Star.

A few hours later, the group reached the mainland at the center of Soulless Star.

“There’s a ghost cave up ahead. The Nine Turns Hundred Leaves Grass and Black Shadow Illusionary Soul Fruits are inside that ghost cave. I have been in that ghost cave in the past to look for chaos spiritual herbs.” The little cow grinned, “There are a lot of chaos spiritual herbs in there, but the problem is that the ghosts inside that cave move in fright. Needless to say, the ghost cave is very dangerous, even a Tenth Order Ancient God Realm has a high mortal risk of ninety percent.”

Everyone tensed slightly.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards the ghost cave, a group of people were flying in their direction.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised when he saw who it was.

“It’s the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief!” Feng Er blurted.

The opposite group was none other than the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief Liang Luwen, as well as other Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders. This time, there was obvious joy on their faces; it seemed like they had collected a big harvest after breaking the ancient formation.
