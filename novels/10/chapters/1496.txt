Fueled by top grade-nine spirit stones, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship cruised through the dark vast space at high speed.

Huang Xiaolong was in the control hall of the flying ship. From time to time, he would glance at the four women who had been busy chatting nonstop since several days. He couldn’t find a good time to ‘prey’ on Yao Chi.

He genuinely could not understand why women talked so much.

Even the Li Lu who usually had cold temperament, or lofty Peng Xiao seemed to have endless things to talk about!

Huang Xiaolong noticed that the four women were huddled together, whispering into each others’ ears as if they were talking about some secret.

On top of that, they would peek at Huang Xiaolong from time to time.

Huang Xiaolong noticed the blush on Yao Chi’s face which baffled him further. Could the four women be talking about him? Why else would they act so secretively? They were even using sound transmission, were they?

Though it was hard for him to believe Li Lu and Peng Xiao were taking part in this kind of conversation, there was a saying that anything is possible.

Huang Xiaolong focused as he tried to listen in on the four women’s conversation, but he failed to make out anything.

After failing in his attempt to eavesdrop on what the four women were talking about, Huang Xiaolong felt depressed. So he went to cultivation room number one to cultivate instead.

The journey was a see-saw between pain and pleasure for Huang Xiaolong.

Even though he had four beautiful women with him, he could only see them without being able to touch any of them!

As time passed, there was a hint of grievance in his eyes when he looked at the four women.

Powerless to stand up against the four, Huang Xiaolong ended up instructing Xiang Xun to drive the flying ship at its fastest speed, so they could reach the Heaven World faster.

With fifty-two of his petrification seals resolved, Xiang Xun’s strength had surpassed the God King Realm, recovering to the peak late-First Order of Heavenly Monarch Realm. Thus, propelled by Xiang Xun’s godforce, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship was a tiny bit faster.

Even so, it took them more than a month’s time to reach the Heaven World.

When the Dragon Shark Flying Ship arrived at the Heaven World, Huang Xiaolong sighed secretly. He felt relieved, similar to what he would feel after a great battle.

Huang Xiaolong and the four women, the little cow, Xiang Xuan, and the rest exited the Dragon Shark Flying Ship. In front of them, they saw a criss-cross of spacious streets hanging in the Divine World’s vast space, forming a square-shaped diagram that seemed to be a grand ancient formation. At the same time, it seemed to be just an ancient diagram...

Huang Xiaolong could barely begin to guess what materials were used to construct each of these enormous streets as it gave him a sturdy and awe-inspiring feeling. Different soft halos were enveloping each of these streets, yet there was a harmony in its entirety.

With his divine sense, Huang Xiaolong counted there were exactly one hundred and eight of these spacious streets, and each street was precisely a hundred and eight thousand kilometers long.

There was a two-way traffic of the horse-carriages along these streets, and all of these horses had a desolate era beasts’ bloodline—from barren sky horse, dragon flames horse, blue radiance horse, to the single-horned horse, among others.

No other form of transportation could be seen on the streets other than these horse carriages. But there were various families’ disciples and Emperor Palaces’ disciples walking on these streets, either leisurely or in a brisk hurry.

Huang Xiaolong even spotted quite a few disciples from the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace, as well as the Fortune Emperor Palace.

This was Li Lu, Yao Chi, and Peng Xiao’s first time visiting Heaven World, hence, all three of them were amazed by this sight.

“Are those people heavenly soldiers?” Yao Chi asked as she pointed at a group of patrolling soldiers clad in golden armors.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look and saw that the soldiers were wearing golden armors that were forged with a secret method that enabled these armors to exude a golden halo and majestic pressure, giving an impression that they were inviolable.

“Yes, they are the Heavenly Court’s heavenly soldiers.” Fang Xuanxuan joined in the conversation. “These heavenly soldiers were carefully selected by the Heavenly Court and have undergone strict training for many years. Each individual is highly talented and strong. These are the common heavenly soldiers, above them are heavenly generals, then heavenly marshals, and finally, the grand marshal.”

“The heavenly soldiers are graded as low-rank, intermediate-rank, and top-rank; so are the heavenly generals. The patrol team usually consists of low-rank and intermediate-rank heavenly soldiers.”

Others listened to Fang Xuanxuan’s explanation attentively.

“On these one hundred and eight Heavens’ Avenues, people are prohibited from riding their own mounts. People can only use the Heavenly Court appointed horse carriages.” Fang Xuanxuan pointed at the horse carriages around them to make her point.

“You can rent these horse carriages as long as you have spirit stones. According to the Heavenly court’s laws, only Emperor Realm masters are allowed to fly in the Heaven World.” Fang Xuanxuan elaborated. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Li Lu and the others finally understood why there were many various Emperor Palaces’ disciples traveling on foot on the Heavens Avenue.

“The Heavenly Court really has a lot of rules.” Peng Xiao chuckled.

Fang Xuanxuan went on, “The whole Divine World is under the Heavenly Court’s jurisdiction, so law and order are essential. Not even the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciples dare to violate the laws established by the Heavenly Court. However, there are still differences in the treatment towards us and the top ten Emperor Palaces in this Divine World.”

“Elder Sister Xuanxuan, the number one Grandmist Emperor Palace, is it very strong?” Yao Chi asked curiously.

Fang Xuanxuan nodded and smiled as she explained, “The Grandmist Emperor Palace is very strong. The whole Divine World acknowledges the strength of the Grandmist Emperor Palace, but how strong is it exactly, that I don’t know.”

“Is the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Grandmist Emperor the number one master of the Divine World?” Li Lu asked.

“No.” Fang Xuanxuan shook her head as she said so. “Though the Grandmist Emperor is powerful, he is not the number one master of the Divine World. Well, at least to my knowledge, his Master, the King of Grandmist, is stronger than him. Other than the King of Grandmist, it would be old monsters of the same generation. If we don’t consider these two aspects, then, the Grandmist Emperor can be considered as the most powerful master.”

“Even compared to the Heavenly Emperor?” Yao Chi asked another question.

Fang Xuanxuan stilled for a moment. “Erm, that is hard to say. Some say that the Heavenly Emperor’s strength is equivalent to the Grandmist Emperor, and he is the Divine World’s rightful number one master. On the other hand, there are others who think that the Grandmist Emperor is slightly stronger than the Heavenly Emperor. However, the two have never competed, so, no one really knows.”

The group flew towards Heaven World as they chatted.

Huang Xiaolong had already put his Dragon Shark Flying Ship back into the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group crossed the world surface barrier and entered the Heaven World, they were stopped by a patrol team. Their identities were checked and verified before they were allowed to go.

“Xiaolong, should we go rent a couple of horse carriages?” When passing by a horse carriage, Yao Chi asked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong turned to the other three women. All three nodded happily in agreement, rendering him helpless to say otherwise.

“Your Younger Sister Bei Xiaomei’s Silver Fox Commerce headquarters is just right ahead, and they have horse carriages for rent. As the Uncle, you can pay a visit to her.” Fang Xuanxuan smirked teasingly.

Uncle? Huang Xiaolong’s scalp tingled, but he nodded his head.

Well, he had promised Bei Xiaomei to visit her after exiting from his seclusion.

Remembering Bei Xiaomei’s ‘the liar is a piggy’ promise, Huang Xiaolong shook his head helplessly.
