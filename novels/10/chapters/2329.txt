Chapter 2330: Entering the Devil Cave

Fu Yunjie and Feng Yuanyuan looked troubled as they walked out of the store. They didn’t notice Huang Xiaolong before them.

At that point in time, Fu Yunjie was also clad in the Holy Heavens inner disciple’s robe. His jade plaque hung from his waist.

It was clear that he had already gone to the examination hall to retrieve his clothes and jade plaque.

“Don’t worry Brother Yunjie, even if Huang Xiaolong becomes the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, he wouldn’t dare to move against you. He isn’t strong enough to expel you from the Holy Heavens! Not to mention the fact that he doesn’t have the authority to do so!” Feng Yuanyuan comforted.

Fu Yunjie’s eyebrows were tightly locked together when he heard what she said.

“To think that loser was able to comprehend twelve sacred steles....” Feng Yuanyuan scoffed.

Fu Yunjie disagreed, “His talent isn’t as simple as we thought. Otherwise, the four Primal Ancestors wouldn’t have accepted him as their disciple.”

Feng Yuanyuan retorted, “He’s just someone with a rank nine hundreds saint godhead! How talented can he be?! It has to be pure luck that he managed to comprehend all twelve sacred steles. Even Holy Prince Li Chen took two hours to comprehend the eleventh stele! Trash like him won’t be able to match up to Senior Brother Li Chen! The four Primal Ancestors had no choice but to accept him because of the old law!”

Fu Yunjie smiled bitterly, “There’s no need to comfort me. Rumors have been going around that Huang Xiaolong is able to evolve his saint attributes.”

Speaking of which, he let out a loud sigh, “Even if he doesn’t have the rights to expel me from the Holy Heavens, all the hall masters are currently fawning over him. Do you know what happened when I retrieved my robes and jade plaque the day before? Zhou Ruo was sarcastic and harsh when I went over to pick them up.”

Fu Yunjie felt a surge of humiliation coursing through him as he recalled the events that had happened the day before. “That b*tch is definitely trying to get on Huang Xiaolong’s good side!”

Feng Yuanyuan tried to pacify him, “Maybe Huang Xiaolong was the one who ordered her to make things difficult for you.”

“One day, I’ll return all these humiliations back to him tenfold!!” Fu Yunjie seethed as his eyes flashed with a hint of hostility and anger.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant voice rang from behind. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The two of them stared at each other in shock as they turned around slowly.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong!” Fu Yunjie was stunned.

Feng Yuanyuan turned ash-pale.

“What do you want?!” Fu Yunjie appeared tough, but his voice was weak, and his previous vigour had evaporated.

“What do I want? I’ll let you know in the future.” Huang Xiaolong replied coldly. He didn’t spare them a glance as he walked away.

The blood drained from Fu Yunjie’s face as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s disappearing back view. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you want? I can give anything to you as long as you let me off!”

Huang Xiaolong turned slightly, but an indifferent expression hung on his face, “You can’t give me what I want!”

Even after Huang Xiaolong disappeared from his sight, Fu Yunjie stood rooted on the spot with soulless eyes.

Feng Yuanyuan stared hatefully towards the direction Huang Xiaolong left, and she spat, “Brother Yunjie, you don’t have to beg him! If we can’t stay in the Holy Heavens, we’ll just join the Holy Lands Alliance. I don’t believe that Huang Xiaolong will be able to do anything to you after you’ve joined them!”

......

Half a day later...

Huang Xiaolong stared at the so-called legendary Devil Cave and was astounded.

The Devil Cave didn’t look anything like Huang Xiaolong had imagined. According to what he knew about the devil factions, he had assumed that the Devil Cave to be filled with a dark and cold devilish aura. However, the entrance before him didn’t have the slightest trace of evil aura surrounding it.

The entrance was built on a giant mountain range and tons of Holy Heavens disciples were guarding the area.

Before he could even step into the Devil Cave, he was intercepted by a group of guards. However, the look on their faces changed when they noticed his jade identity plaque. When they learned that he was the Huang Xiaolong, a polite smile appeared on their faces.

Elder Zhang Sijin, who was in charge of the safety of the Devil Cave rushed over immediately after the head of the security team notified him, and he personally escorted Huang Xiaolong into the Devil Cave.

Taking a glance around the Devil Cave, Huang Xiaolong noticed individual platforms that imprisoned disciples of the Devil Palace and countless light rune arrays suppressing their strength mercilessly.

As he stared at the surroundings, Huang Xiaolong realized that the streets were wide and there were even buildings and shops around the platforms!

Even though the Devil Cave was built within the mountain ridge, it wasn’t humid nor dark. Instead, holy light illuminated the area and gave off a warm fuzzy feeling.

The streets were packed with Holy Heavens disciples, and there were even some sparring with imprisoned Devil Palace disciples on the holy arena. Spirited cheers came from under the arena, and it was clear they were all fired up.

After bringing Huang Xiaolong into the Devil Cave, Elder Zhang Sijin carefully inquired about the purpose of his visit.

Not everyone who was there wanted to spar with the disciples of the Devil Palace. After all, the streets were bustling and tons of shops sold elixirs and artifacts owned by the Holy Heavens. It could be considered a shopping street of sorts.

“The Devil Cave is pretty boisterous.” Huang Xiaolong smirked.

Zhang Sijin paused and agreed, “Yes indeed....”

Huang Xiaolong saw no point in delaying the conversation, and he quickly stated his purpose. In the next instant, he inquired about the information of all the prisoners in the mid-Third Order Venerable Realm to the Seventh Order Venerable Realm.

According to the rules, disciples of the Holy Heavens could only challenge disciples of the Devil Palace with higher cultivation realms.

Zhang Sijin hesitated the moment he heard what he said. After all, Huang Xiaolong would soon become a disciple of all four Primal Ancestors. His status in the organization could be said to be higher than Grand Hall Master Wu Ge himself! If anything happened to their precious disciple, Zhang Sijin knew that he wouldn’t be able to make up for his mistake even if he died a hundred times.

A tinge of worry appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. “Elder Zhang, you don’t have to worry about me. No one will blame you if anything untoward happens to me. Since you can’t make the decision, let’s ask your Hall Master. If he can’t make the decision, we shall ask Grand Hall Master Wu Ge.”

It didn’t take long for them to receive an answer.

A weird smile formed on Zhang Sijin’s face, and he hastily ordered the disciples under him to bring Huang Xiaolong all the information he wanted.
