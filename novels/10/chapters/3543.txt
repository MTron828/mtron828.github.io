Chapter 3544: They’re Here!

 

“When Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong established the Eternal Heaven Alliance in the past, they were adamant about going against the Creation Palace. There was no way they would give in to the threats by them. However…” Ao Shenghai paused for a second after speaking up to that point.

“What?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Even though the two of them are unwilling to hand you over, there are many Gods of Creation in the alliance who have been complaining. Quite a number of them have been petitioning to kick you out from the Eternal Heaven Alliance. They are afraid that your existence will bring trouble to the alliance.” Ao Shenghai continued, “Feng Tianquan has been exceptionally adamant about the matter. He’s messing about with everyone’s mind, and he plans to get a group of experts to capture you to send you over to the Creation Palace.”

“Oh? Feng Tianquan?!” Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes.

Because of Wang Meiqi, Huang Xiaolong decided to let Feng Tianquan off previously. Now, it seemed as though the man was going overboard. No one could blame him for what he was about to do.

“Your Highness, sorry for dragging you into this…” Wang Meiqi apologized.

A huge part of Feng Tianquan’s beef with Huang Xiaolong had to do with Wang Meiqi, and she couldn’t help but feel embarrassed.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and sighed, “This has nothing to do with you. Feng Tianquan is just tired of living.”

Soon after, Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang reported everything that happened during the time he was away.

Under Feng Tianquan’s influence, there had been more than a hundred experts who were clamoring to hand Huang Xiaolong over.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive after hearing the reports. After all, he was no longer the Huang Xiaolong of the past. He was much stronger than before. Even without the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s protection, he would be able to run rampant in the First Universe.

On the afternoon that he returned, Feng Tianquan brought eighty experts over to pay Huang Xiaolong a visit.

Naturally, all of them were those who planned to hand him over.

“Huang Xiaolong, speak! How did Ao Yan and the others disappear?!” Feng Tianquan barked the moment he arrived. “Do you know how much trouble you have brought to the Eternal Heaven Alliance by doing so?! The army of the Creation Palace has already set their sights on us!” 

A God of Creation at the grand completion stage beside Feng Tianquan piped up, “Head over to the Creation Palace by yourself and explain yourself to them. Beg for their forgiveness.”

Wang Meiqi glared at Feng Tianquan while standing behind Huang Xiaolong, “Feng Tianquan, you’re not qualified to tell His Highness what to do! Lord Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong are the masters of the Eternal Heaven Alliance, not you!” 

Feng Tianquan was at a loss for words now that Wang Meiqi spoke up.

However, Qian Shaolin, another God of Creation at the grand completion stage snapped, “We might not be the alliance leaders, but this matter has already threatened the safety of our alliance! As members of the Eternal Heaven Alliance, we have a responsibility to keep everyone else safe!” 

“That’s right! Huang Xiaolong, since you entered our alliance, you can’t put all of us in danger because of your foolish actions!” Feng Tianquan sneered at the side.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “If I remember correctly, the purpose of our alliance was to go against the Creation Palace. Which part of our rules state that we are not allowed to clash with experts of the Creation Palace?!” 

Feng Tianquan and the others recoiled in shock.

“Did all of you receive benefits from the Creation Palace? Are you trying to mess up our alliance?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

The faces of Tao Shi, Qian Shaolin, and others changed.

“Huang Xiaolong, what the f*ck are you saying?!” Tao Shi’s expression sank. “You can’t accuse us without evidence!” 

As soon as he spoke, he released his aura completely to suppress Huang Xiaolong.

“Are you trying to make a move on a fellow alliance member?” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

“Brother Tao Shi!” Qian Shaolin shook his head slightly as he warned his fellow cultivator.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that I’m afraid of you with the Star Dragon Couple backing you up? Humph! I’m not afraid of them at all!” Tao Shi growled before retracting his aura.

As the fourth strongest expert in the Eternal Heaven Alliance, Tao Shi was indeed capable of sprouting such words.

“Let’s go!” Tao Shi waved his sleeve in annoyance.

Feng Tianquan and the others followed behind him as they left Huang Xiaolong’s residence.

Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang grimaced as rage filled their hearts. 

“Your Highness, do you want me to deal with that cocky b*stard?” Ao Shenghai failed to control his anger, and he muttered ominously.

“There’s no need. We’ll have our chances in the future.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and chuckled.

Several days later, the Creation Palace sent over an envoy to threaten them once again. The person they sent was Ao Ying, Ao Yan’s father! There were dozens of experts to back him up in case anything happened.

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong hosted the group in the main hall of the Eternal Heaven Alliance. Even though the two organizations were at loggerheads, they wouldn’t kill wantonly. 

Huang Xiaolong and his group were also summoned to the banquet.

“Huang Xiaolong, where are my son and the others?!” Ao Ying roared the moment Huang Xiaolong arrived. “How did they go missing?! Hand them over right now! Otherwise, you know how this will end!” 

“I have no idea where they are. Oh, but I do know where someone from your Creation Palace is. Do you remember Duan Jun? I captured him along my way,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

There was no way Huang Xiaolong would hand the five of them over. After all, they knew his secret about the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Duan Jun was oblivious to the fact that there was a chance he would be released.

“What?!” Ao Ying and the experts of the Creation Palace jumped in fright. A few months ago, Duan Jun went missing! Nearly everyone from the Creation Palace was sent out to look for him. Who would have thought that Duan Jun would be in Huang Xiaolong’s hands?

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong were equally as shocked.

Getting to his feet, Ao Ying glared at Huang Xiaolong as killing intent spewed out from his eyes. “Where is he?!”

Ignoring the murderous intent coming from Ao Ying, Huang Xiaolong released the restriction in the Sun Moon Furnace. Ao Ying and the others managed to see Duan Jun who was beaten up to a pig head and rage instantly filled their hearts.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I’ll give him back for ten high-grade universe spiritual veins.” Huang Xiaolong grinned.

With ten high-grade universe spiritual veins, Huang Xiaolong would be able to break through the 10 billion units mark! Not even half-step Universe Gods would be able to threaten him then!

Ao Ying and the others blurted a string of obscenities when they heard his request.

“Huang Xiaolong no one has ever tried to threaten my Creation Palace!” The killing intent overflowing from Ao Ying reached a whole new level.

“Oh? Looks like I’ll be the first. It’s my honor,” Huang Xiaolong snickered amusedly.

Ao Ying glared at Huang Xiaolong for a long time without backing down. Finally, he gave in. “I’ll report this to Palace Master Kai Dong.” 

Crushing his transmission symbol, he reported the matter.

It didn’t take long for him to receive a reply. Kai Dong agreed immediately, and he sent experts over to the Eternal Heaven Alliance with Huang Xiaolong’s spiritual veins.

After the deal was done, Huang Xiaolong didn’t go back on his words. He handed Duan Jun over to them.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’ll die a horrible death!” Ao Ying growled.

“Well, I should be the one saying that,” Huang Xiaolong replied.
