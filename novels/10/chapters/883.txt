Hearing the sudden change in the Patriarch’s tone when mentioning Huang Xiaolong, the Wangu Clan Elders had nothing to say.

Huang Xiaolong’s talent had gone way beyond the scope of their imagination, giving birth to a silent fear that slithered up their hearts and only grew stronger.

Wangu Yanhui spoke again, breaking the oppressive atmosphere, “Patriarch, this disciple thinks that Huang Xiaolong can only be befriended, and even if we cannot do that, we must absolutely not make an enemy out of him. A monster like Huang Xiaolong will definitely become a Tenth Order Highgod Realm master in a few thousand years. Based on his battle strength, upon reaching Tenth Order Highgod Realm, no one from countless galaxies will be his opponent.”

“Yanhui is right. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong did save his life once before, and could be considered our Wangu Clan’s benefactor in this matter.” Wangu Shuo supported Wangu Yanhui’s opinion.

Wangu Yutai nodded his head, “Although this Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm is a little low, his talent is still worthwhile for us to show some goodwill, I plan to give him a drop of sacred qilin whelp blood.”

The Wangu Clan Elders were stunned hearing this, some of them even looked tempted.

“Patriarch, this sacred qilin blood is our clan’s sacred relic, harvesting a small drop every thousand years, isn’t that...?” Wangu Yuan hesitated.

“Yes, Patriarch, not to mention that Huang Xiaolong isn’t a disciple of our Wangu Clan. Even if we give him a drop of qilin blood, it doesn’t mean he can absorb it.” Wangu Zhi added, “We can give him some other things, such as sacred grade immortal spirit stones, or maybe Undying God Pills.”

Wangu Yutai shook his head, “From the result of my checking, before the tournament started, this Huang Xiaolong had spent more than three trillion to purchase the Surging Waves Mansion located at the center of Eternal City. Later, he bought more than a hundred bottles of Undying God Pills, Extraordinary Divine Pellets, and Myriad Cure Holy Pills. This shows that he’s not lacking in money or sacred grade spirit stones.”

Wangu Clan Elders felt as if a large boulder struck the back of their heads. Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong was also a super wealthy tycoon.

Several Wangu Clan Elders still wanted to dissuade him further, but Wangu Yutai merely waved his hand, cutting them off, “This matter is decided. Wangu Shuo, you will personally send the sacred qilin blood over to the Surging Waves Mansion.”

“Yes, Patriarch!” Wangu Shuo stood up, bowing respectfully in compliance.

The other Wangu Elders exchanged glances amongst themselves in silence.

Thus, not long after Huang Xiaolong returned to the Surging Waves Mansion from the Wangu Clan’s main residence, Wangu Shuo had arrived to personally gift Huang Xiaolong the drop of qilin blood.

When Wangu Shuo opened the jade box containing a single drop of sacred qilin blood, it immediately enveloped the whole Surging Waves Mansion in a blood-red glow, followed by the heaven resounding roar of an ancient qilin.

Feng Yang, Liu Yun, and the others felt their hearts racing.

That single drop of sacred qilin blood was the size of two thumbs, resembling the rarest blood-colored ruby. Even though it looked calm on the surface, one could feel a vibrant vitality exuding from it.

Despite it being suppressed by restrictions, Huang Xiaolong was able to feel the vast roiling energy contained within.

“Elder Wangu Shuo, this item is too precious.” Huang Xiaolong was more than surprised but did not reach out to accept the gift. Although he didn’t know the exact usage of this drop of blood, he understood that it was something precious to the Wangu Clan, not something that could be bought with spirit stones.

Wangu Shuo revealed an amiable smile, “Young warrior need not refuse, this is a small token from our Patriarch. You saved Yanhui, a little qilin blood is nothing in comparison. Our Patriarch also said that you are always welcome to our Wangu Clan’s main residence to have a cup of tea. Our Patriarch would be delighted to have you there.”

“Since it is so, then I accept this sacred qilin blood with thanks. I shall trouble Elder Wangu Shuo to convey my thanks to Patriarch Wangu.” Huang Xiaolong slightly hesitated before accepting the jade box.

After Wangu Shuo already said so courteously, it was hard for Huang Xiaolong to further refuse. Even though he knew this was a sign of goodwill from the Wangu Clan, it was a good thing to Huang Xiaolong as well.

A while later, Wangu Shuo left, returning to report to his Patriarch. Before he left, Huang Xiaolong gave him ten sacred grade immortal spirit stones. Hence, when Wangu Shuo stepped out from the Surging Waves Mansion, his face was ruddy and his eyes bent into a wide smile.

“Xiaolong, when are we heading back to the Black Tortoise Galaxy?” After Wangy Shuo left, Feng Yang inquired Huang Xiaolong’s intention.

“Let’s depart tomorrow.” Huang Xiaolong answered.

During the tournament, he had killed a large number of disciples from both Yelu and Beitang Families. He was a little worried about the Huang Clan Manor, hence, he’d like to rush back to the Black Tortoise Galaxy as soon as possible.

On that very night, Huang Xiaolong went inside the Heavenly God’s dwelling, sitting cross-legged, and opened the jade box in his hand. The suction force from his hand immediately brought the drop of ruby red blood in front of him.

Although his current strength was comparable to the average Sixth Order Highgod Realm master, judging from the power that Yelu Chufei showed when he attempted to take his life on the square, Huang Xiaolong concluded that Yelu Chufei was a Seventh Order Highgod Realm master, perhaps even mid-Seventh Order.

Therefore, before he went back to Martial Spirit World, Huang Xiaolong strived to enhance his strength even a little bit, which was why he decided to refine the drop of sacred qilin blood.

Looking at the drop blood floating in front of him, Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and inhaled, bringing it into his body.

The instant the sacred qilin blood entered his body, Huang Xiaolong felt as if his whole body’s blood was boiling.

Hot!

It was as if what he swallowed wasn’t a two thumb-sized large drop of sacred qilin blood, but a giant volcano, one capable of burning a world surface like Martial Spirit World into ashes in a matter of minutes.

Huang Xiaolong’s skin was like burning ember, emitting wisps of smoke from his amber red skin surface. But, that initial heat wave rushing out from his body was only the beginning.

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded, quickly activating his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power, frantically swallowing this overwhelming fire element force. While he was refining the sacred qilin blood, the Divine World messenger that presented the Highgod Advancement Tournament’s rewards had returned to a magnificent godly temple, respectfully falling to his knees. In front of the messenger stood a slightly short and round middle-aged man.

In between this middle-aged man’s brows was a divine symbol representing lightning.

The Divine World messenger was reporting to this middle-aged man the details of the rewards presentation.

“Only a top rank ten godhead?” The short middle-aged man’s brows furrowed slightly, disappointment flickered in his eyes.

“That is so, Great Emperor. The first place winner Huang Xiaolong’s godhead is only a top rank ten godhead.” The Divine World messenger affirmed.

“Alright, you can retreat.” The short middle-aged man instructed with a wave of his hand.

The Divine World messenger respectfully complied and left. The short and plump middle-aged man shook his head, muttering under his breath, “Looks like the chances of finding a genius disciple with an emperor rank godhead is impossible.” Before his last word sounded, his figure already disappeared from the spot.

One month passed went by.

The burning heat that previously enveloped Huang Xiaolong already subsided by now. When he opened his eyes, a fleeting fire flickered in his pupils. After one month of cultivation, he had completely absorbed the energy within that drop of sacred qilin blood. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Huang Xiaolong could feel an obvious increase in his strength, already reaching the border of peak early Third Order Highgod Realm. Furthermore, the Holy Dragon Supreme Godhead’s fire element godforce had become even purer and more powerful than before.

When he exited the Heavenly Mountain and reached the Surging Waves Mansion’s front hall, he noticed Feng Yang and the others waiting for him there.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong appear, Feng Yang and the others stood up and approached him.

“Xiaolong, there’s someone outside named Wang Zhong, saying he’s an Elder from the Fortune Gate. He insisted on seeing you...” Feng Yang was filled with worry as he spoke.

Fortune Gate Elder? Huang Xiaolong frowned, this Fortune Gate came unexpectedly fast, this Wang Zhong’s arrival was undoubtedly related to Fang Chu’s death.
