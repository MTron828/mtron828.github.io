Lu Zhuo motioned with his hand, signaling everyone to calm down, his tone placid, “Merely based on the fact that Huang Xiaolong was at Cao Bao City on the day of Cao Yang, Zhuang Xuan, and Huang Junfei’s death, all of you are dead certain that this matter is related to him? This is your so-called evidence?”

An Zaixuan and Qiu Bihu’s further words were stuck in their throat.

Chen Hao refuted, “Huang Xiaolong’s appearance at Cao Bao City is too much of a coincidence.”

“In this world, coincidental events are too numerous to count.” Luo Zhuo glanced in Chen Hao’s direction, continuing, “The news of Cao our three Grand Elders being killed by Huang Xiaolong was released by the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect, their motive is so obvious that I don’t need to elaborate. All of you know it yourselves.”

Chen Hao frowned deeply.

This Lu Zhuo old man was clearly on Huang Xiaolong’s side.

Lu Zhuo suddenly spoke, “Chen Hao, I know there are grudges between you and Huang Xiaolong, however, without solid evidence, do not set one’s crime.”

Chen Hao looked ugly after being criticized.

Although Lu Zhuo did not bluntly express it, the underlying meaning of his words was obvious to everyone who heard it; Chen Hao was avenging private grudges using public matters.

Being reminded of this, the others present revealed various expressions.

“Ancestor, although we do not have concrete evidence, Huang Xiaolong still can’t escape suspicion.” Chen Hao insisted, unwilling to let the matter die without a fight.

Lu Zhuo couldn’t help but nod, “Since it’s like this, then we’ll ask him once he returns.”

Chen Hao was close to cussing on the spot hearing those words. Ask? Was Huang Xiaolong brainless as to admit to something like that? What was the difference between asking and not asking? This old man’s words were nothing but farts in the wind!

“Ancestor, I suggest we scour his soul.” Chen Hao gritted his teeth, suppressing the raging fury in his heart, insisting, “Only like that can we can determine whether the three Grand Elders’ death is related to him or not.”

Lu Zhuo’s expression sank with displeasure, reprimanding “Scour his soul? Chen Hao, you know very well that the slightest carelessness during soul-scouring will cause one’s soul to suffer injuries, even turn them into a fool. If Huang Xiaolong is unrelated to this incident, can a mere chief disciple like you afford to take the responsibility?”

Can a mere chief disciple like you afford to take the responsibility!

Lu Zhuo’s voice reverberated in the main hall.

Everyone had a different expression, those Grand Elders that had always found Chen Hao displeasing like Grand Elder Sun Jian and several others were gloating inside.

Chen Hao’s expression worsened.

Ever since he entered the Barbarian God Sect, he had been hailed as the sect’s greatest genius in the last hundred thousand years. In the past, both Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling highly valued him. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he could call for the wind and rain with a wave of his hand, but today, for Huang Xiaolong, Lu Zhuo actually reprimanded him in front of the Sect’s upper echelon!

For a mere Huang Xiaolong!

Lu Zhuo looked around everyone at the hall, his tone solemn, “I’ll be frank with you all. After returning from the three sects’ joint training, I reexamined Huang Xiaolong’s godhead, which is, in truth, a top grade king rank Blue Shadow Godhead!”

“Blue Shadow Godhead, ranked one thousand and ninth!”

Chen Hao’s body shook, his face looking worse than ever. Even though he had more or less guessed that Huang Xiaolong’s godhead must be above low grade king rank, now that he received a confirmation from the Ancestor’s mouth, it was still a great blow to him.

“Also, Huang Xiaolong has a True Divine Dragon Physique that can evolve and transform.” Lu Zhuo added.

Another wave of gasping sounded in the hall. At this point, Chen Hao was as pale as a ghost.

Lu Zhuo reiterated, “So if you all want to punish Huang Xiaolong, you need to bring me concrete evidence.”

Some time back, Lu Zhuo planned to conceal Huang Xiaolong’s godhead and unique physique, but now, it seemed like announcing it wasn’t a bad idea.

At the very least, these Grand Elders would understand the reason why he was more inclined toward Huang Xiaolong. Since his talent and potential were laid out, there was no reason for these Grand Elders to object to Lu Zhuo’s partiality.

Not to mention the fact that the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect had long wanted to eliminate Huang Xiaolong, hence, announcing his talent didn’t really matter.

Moreover, it might even make the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect feel apprehensive.

If those two sects were still adamant on killing him after knowing he had a top grade king rank godhead, then shouldn’t blame the Barbarian God Sect for taking the ruthless path.

“Alright, it’s agreed then. Gu Ling, contact Huang Xiaolong, have him return to the sect.” Lu Zhuo then turned and instructed Gu Ling.

Gu Ling nodded, acknowledging Lu Zhuo’s order.

One month later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Barbarian God Sect.

As Lu Zhuo had stated, unless there was concrete evidence that Huang Xiaolong killed the three Grand Elders, he wouldn’t be punished. On the other hand, Lu Zhuo still convened the upper echelon for an open inquiry upon Huang Xiaolong’s return.

Chen Hao could only grit his teeth in anger most of the time.

Soon, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s top grade king rank Blue Shadow Godhead and True Divine Dragon Physique spread throughout the Barbarian God Sect. Disciples who had thought that Huang Xiaolong being overly arrogant in wanting to challenge Chen Hao all changed their stance.

Several Grand Elders who had been supporting Chen Hao all this while were keeping their distance from him. Seeing that the situation wasn’t quite right, some Sky Dragon League disciples withdrew from the league in twos or threes.

All of this fueled Chen Hao’s hatred for Huang Xiaolong that reached deep into the bones.

Within the Barbarian God City’s Celestial Immortal Manor.

Right now, there was a large jade box placed in front of Huang Xiaolong, inside of which were a dozen kinds of herbs required for refining the Reverse Incarnation Pill.

This jade box was sent over by Gu Ling.

“I’m still missing five hundred and sixty-two kinds of herbs.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He had already asked for Gu Ling’s help to search for the remaining five hundred and sixty-two kinds of medicinal herbs as well as the five essential chaos herbs.

Now, he could only wait for news from Gu Ling’s side.

“Xiaolong, that smelly punk Chen Hao will only be a scourge if left alive, when do you plan to deal with him once and for all?” At the side, the little cow asked, yawning with disinterest.

“Hm, I’d better wait until the chief disciple competition.” Huang Xiaolong answered after pondering the question.

Although he had two Green Ice Hail Devil puppets, hence killing Chen Hao required no effort at all, Huang Xiaolong still preferred to do it by himself in front of all the Barbarian God Sect disciples, personally killing Chen Hao.

In truth, Chen Hao was no longer a threat to him.

Then again, if he was adamant to continue down this path of destruction, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t mind ending Chen Hao’s life earlier. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In the days that followed, Huang Xiaolong remained in the Barbarian God Sect, cultivating while waiting for news from Gu Ling related to the medicinal herbs.

One year soon passed.

During this year, not only had Huang Xiaolong refined all four top rank grade two spiritual veins, he also refined every last forty-million-years-old herb found inside the imperial green jade spatial ring, reaching peak late-Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm. Just half a step more and he’d be able to advance to Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm.

The good news was that, during this one year, Huang Xiaolong collected another two hundred plus herbs with Gu Ling’s help. On top of that, Gu Ling found a clue about the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus’ whereabouts!

"Dralion Island.” [1] Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone.

According to Gu Ling’s information, that Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus was in the hands of one the island’s prominent sects.

The Dralion Island was similar to the Green Cloud Island, being one of many islands on the Endless Sea, however, the forces there were much stronger than the ones on Green Cloud Island.
