Chapter 2945: The Real Huang Long Cape

As Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingyue, and the others’ confident expressions changed, there was a rumble!

The Dragon Fish City seemed to have jerked forward following the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s fist. Huang Shuai’s waves of heavens’ might and his world-destroying palm strike exploded everywhere like fireworks.

Next, the thousands of black dragons, sky dragons, and whatnot exploded in the air.

The ten high-order Saint Fates above Huang Shuai’s head were knocked flying across the air like they were been hit by a great impact, leaving one to wonder where they might have fallen.

The giant golden dragon of creation let out a painful growl as it shattered into speckles of light. Huang Shuai himself was smashed into the city wall just like Lin Zhuoyi, and that section of the city wall exploded as Huang Shuai made a hole through it!

Huang Shuai was smashed into the Dragon Fish City through the walls!

Experts screaming about His Highness Huang Shuai’s might, and him being invincible choked on their own voices. Everyone froze on the spot, looking at the hole through the city walls Huang Shuai made!

Staring at the gaping human-shaped hole through the city walls…

Xuanyuna Potian, Yang Jia, and the others were completely petrified.

And the Silver Shadow Creed’s Old Ancestor Hou Tingwei’s scream broke the atmosphere, “This, this is impossible!”

He had acknowledged that Huang Xiaolong was a freak of a monster ever since he had fought Huang Xiaolong at the Silver Shadow Creed, but at that time, Huang Xiaolong had lost half a move to him. He himself couldn’t take on the palm attack Huang Shuai had executed just now, yet Huang Xiaolong had shattered it with a punch, and the same punch had sent Huang Shuai flying!

Hou Tingwei was certain that only Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable and above had the ability to take on Huang Shuai’s attack, but no Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable would be able to send Huang Shuai flying with one punch. Did that mean that Huang Xiaolong’s current combat power was higher than a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable?!

Not only Hou Tingwei, but many people had thought of this point, hence there were expressions of disbelief on quite a few shocked faces.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong, the Dragon Fish Patriarch Bi Cheng heaved out slowly, “Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!”

Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!

His voice wasn’t loud, but it sounded louder than a giant meteor crashing to the ground, hitting the heartstrings of everyone present. Their hearts quivered, looking dumbfounded.

“What? The Dao Body of Heaven and Earth? Huang Xiaolong successfully cultivated the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!” Chen Tianyang couldn’t believe what he had just heard.

“Didn’t they say no one could successfully cultivate the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth?! Even the Son of Creation, His Highness Huang Shuai, couldn’t do it, how come Huang Xiaolong succeeded?!”

The experts all around were baffled.

No one could take their eyes away from Huang Xiaolong in this circumstance. At this moment, they had forgotten about Huang Shuai inside the Dragon Fish City.

Different from other experts, Bi Cheng, Hong Qingyue, Wu Kun, and others felt like their hearts were about to burst. Others might have been unaware, but they, as peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm experts knew one great secret no other cultivators knew—the Lord God of Creation, Huang Long, had successfully cultivated the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!

Other than Huang Xiaolong, Lord Huang Long had also successfully cultivated the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth!

As one of the God of Creation Huang Long’s vassals, the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng knew more than other creeds’ patriarchs.

Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingyue, and others’ eyes flashed and dimmed as complicated expressions formed on their faces.

Right at this time, Huang Shuai who was smashed into the Dragon Fish City stood up from the rubbles, his face distorted with humiliation and fury, as well as solidifying killing intent.

As the Son of Creation, the noble Son of Creation, he was sent flying by a Primal Ancestor ant!

Huang Xiaolong had not employed any cosmos energy when he had countered Huang Shuai’s attack. It was purely and solely the power of his Dao Body of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, Huang Shuai, Bi Cheng, Wu Kun, Hu Qingye, and everyone else assume that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was still in the Primal Ancestor Realm.

Honestly, Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised to see Huang Shuai climb out from the rubbles. Based on his current physical strength, he could easily burst a Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable’s body, yet Huang Shuai’s body as a peak late-First Esteem Dao Venerable, had not exploded.

But the surprise went away soon enough, and it was replaced by intrigue. To Huang Xiaolong, the stronger Huang Shuai was, the more fun it would be. It would be meaningless if Huang Shuai died from one punch.

He was knocked away by Huang Xiaolong, and now, noticing Huang Xiaolong’s gaze that was scrutinizing him like prey, Huang Shuai was enraged, “Huang Xiaolong, I’m no Son of Creation if I don’t kill you today!”

His momentum soared frenziedly, and it was stronger than before.

Huang Xiaolong sneered listening to Huang Shuai emphasizing that he was the Son of Creation in almost every other sentence. The dragon phantom Huang Shuai projected looked extremely real and similar, almost no different from his own dragon phantom, and it succeeded in tricking Bi Cheng and the others, but how could it confound Huang Xiaolong?

Huang Xiaolong already knew Huang Shuai’s Huang long Bloodline was fake at first glance.

But then came the baffling question. Huang Shuai’s Huang Long Bloodline was indeed fake, however, inside Huang Shuai’s body, there was indeed a trace of Huang Long Bloodline, but it wasn’t pure. Moreover, Huang Shuai’s body was indeed born with the body of a dragon.

Where did the trace of Huang Long Bloodline inside Huang Shuai’s body come from?

A pair of twin blades appeared in Huang Shuai’s hands. The bodies of these twin blades reflected piercing glints that shredded the surrounding space. Watching this gave everyone the impression that nothing in the world could block the twin blades’ lethal glints.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked as well. These twin blades, could these be part of the Set of Creation, the Huang Long Twin Blades?

But Huang Xiaolong refuted his initial assumption. Although these twin blades were dangerous, they were a far cry from the level of the Set of Creation!

They were merely peak-grade dao artifacts!

Obviously, Huang Shuai had forged these peak-grade dao artifact twin blades according to the Huang Long Twin Blades.

Huang Xiaolong was right, these twin blades were forged by copying the Huang Long Twin Blades. But it wasn’t Huang Shuai, it was Bi Cheng and the other patriarchs’ idea. In order to forge these peak-grade dao artifacts, the ten creeds had emptied out almost half of their treasuries.

These were peak-grade dao artifacts after all! One grade higher than the Shaking Dragon Spear Huang Xiaolong had gotten from the Dragon Fish Branch Pavilion!

There were only a small number of peak-grade dao artifacts in the whole Divine Tuo Holy World.

While the attention was on the twin blades in Huang Shuai’s hands, a cape appeared out of nowhere on Huang Shuai’s shoulders. This cape had the emblem of a might golden dragon on its surface and intricate dragon runes. These profound dragon runes exuded awe-inspiring, heavenly coercion!

This heavenly coercion was exactly the same as Huang Xiaolong’s Huang Long Armor!

Huang Xiaolong immediately became spirited, his gaze sharpened as he muttered, “Huang Long Cape!”

It was the Huang Long Cape from the Set of Creation, the Huang Long Cape that was renowned for enhancing speed!

Huang Shuai’s Huang Long Twin Blades were copies, but the Huang Long Cape was definitely genuine, a hundred percent real!

The real Huang Long Cape was actually in Huang Shuai’s hands!
