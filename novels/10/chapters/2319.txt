Chapter 2320: I Salute this Brat’s Courage!

As soon as Yunjie returned, he saw Huang Xiaolong on the Heavenly Bridge, and he couldn’t help but sneer, “There are some times when I really salute this brat’s courage....”

Feng Yuanyuan laughed, “What’s there to admire? His saint attributes rank in the high nine hundreds. We should praise the old b*stard who brought him here. What a shameless man.”

Fan Xia’s gaze landed on Di Huai and a cold gaze flashed through his eyes. After Yunjie successfully enters the organization, the Holy Heavens City would no longer protect Di Huai and Huang Xiaolong with a single word from him. When that happens, I would be able to make my move!

As soon as they were to leave the city, he would deal with them however he saw fit!

By the time he was done running through the scenarios in his mind, Huang Xiaolong had arrived at the first stele.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was about to start, Fu Yunjie sneered, “Do you really think he will be able to comprehend the first stele?”

Feng Yuanyuan snorted, “Big Brother Yunjie, Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to comprehend the first stele! There has been someone with a rank 283rd Saint godhead who tried several tens of millions of years ago and he only managed to comprehend the first stele! With Huang Xiaolong’s trash talent, he wouldn’t be able to comprehend the first stele even if you gave him a day!”

“That’s right! Young Lady Feng is right! It’s impossible for Huang Xiaolong to comprehend even the first stele!”

Everyone around agreed with whatever they said.

Unbeknownst to Fu Yunjie, Feng Yuanyuan, Feng Cheng, and Fan Xia, several people appeared in the skies above the bridge when Huang Xiaolong took the test. All of them stared at Huang Xiaolong, afraid that they would miss the slightest detail.

Among them was the Grand Hall Master of the Holy Heavens, Wu Ge. The Hall Master of the examination hall, Yu Mingjiang, and the Vice Hall Master of the examination hall, Du Cheng, were all present.

Every single one of them were standing behind several figures and even with their status, they didn’t dare to make a sound.

Even Hall Master Yu Mingjiang didn’t dare to breathe loudly. An anxious look was plastered on his face, and he looked at the figures standing behind him.

Waves battered the hearts of the Hall Masters and Vice Hall Masters.

Those who had appeared to watch Huang Xiaolong’s test were existences who stood at the apex of the Holy World! They hadn’t shown themselves in the world for a long time, but all of them were there to observe a single person’s test.

Moreover, they were there to watch the test of a disciple who hadn’t even entered the Holy Heavens!

There wasn’t a need to mention the absurdity of the situation when Huang Xiaolong’s saint attribute ranked in the nine hundreds. Even someone like Fu Yunjie couldn’t enter their sights!

Wu Ge couldn’t help but stare at Huang Xiaolong from time to time. Suspicion clouded his heart as he couldn’t understand the reason behind the interest those masters had for Huang Xiaolong.

Could it be because his saint attributes are fully attributed?!

One of the supreme masters opened his mouth all of a sudden. “Brother Long, how long do you think it’ll take for him to comprehend the first stele?”

The person who spoke was the youngest out of the masters, and his eyes were jade blue in color. Mesmerizing flashes of light emitted from his eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong on the bridge below.

As for the person he addressed as Brother Long, he was a well-built man who had aged really well. However, there were two horns sticking out from his forehead. Looking at the properties of the horns, they seemed to form on the heads of members of the Dragon Race, but at second glance, they didn’t seem so. Runes glowed on the surface of the horns, and they were a level higher than holy runes.

“It’s a little difficult to predict. Did Brother Heavenly Master take eight seconds to comprehend the first stele in the past?” Brother Long shook his head, and his gaze landed on a middle-aged man as he laughed. “I’ll estimate that he’ll take twenty seconds or so!”

The middle-aged man who was addressed as Brother Heavenly Master chuckled but didn’t say a word.

“That might not be the case.” A skinny old man laughed suddenly. “He’ll take fifteen seconds.”

Wu Ge, Yu Mingjiang, and Du Cheng felt their brains exploding into mush.

Twenty seconds?! Fifteen seconds?! What in the world is going on?!

They knew that the strongest expert they had accepted into the Holy Heavens, Li Chen, had taken twenty four seconds to comprehend the first stele!

Could it be that Huang Xiaolong’s talent has superseded Li Chen?! How could something like this be possible?

Moreover, Lord Long compared Huang Xiaolong to Lord Heavenly Master!

As thoughts spun rapidly in the minds of the hall masters and vice hall masters, Huang Xiaolong’s hand landed on the first stele.

Blinding rays of light shot out from stele in the instant he lay his hands on the first stele! The runes along the body of the first stele lit up without a moment’s delay.

Buzz!

A buzzing sound rang through the air, as though the first stele was trying to remind everyone that Huang Xiaolong completed his comprehension in an instant.

Compared to the time when Fu Yunjie had activated the stele, the holy light around it seemed a little more lively. It was as though they recognized Huang Xiaolong as their owner as they danced about in the air around him. The stele emitted a friendly buzzing sound.

The four supreme existences stared at the youngster on the bridge with an expression of shock.

If something was shocking enough to affect the four supreme existences, there was no need to mention the hall masters.

Wu Ge, Yu Mingjiang, and Du Cheng felt their jaws dropping in fright.

What the f*ck just happened?! One second?! No! He took less than a second!

Fu Yunjie, Feng Yuanyuan, Fan Xia, and everyone else watching the test fell silent. They stared at Huang Xiaolong, unable to believe their eyes.

This....

Are we hallucinating?!

As for the examiner, who had reminded Huang Xiaolong to know his limits, felt a buzzing sound in her brain as the world around her started to spin.

When everyone stared at him with a dumbfounded expression, Huang Xiaolong continued on to the second stele.

“This... Is this even possible?!” The supreme existence they called Brother Long didn’t know what to say. He had estimated that Huang Xiaolong would take twenty seconds to comprehend the first stele, but he was merely being polite. He had never believed for a second that Huang Xiaolong would be able to break the record of their most talented disciple. Of course, he had no doubt that Huang Xiaolong would comprehend the first stele. It was just that the time Huang Xiaolong took had exceeded his expectations.

Huang Xiaolong’s palm landed on the second stele as they were still processing what had happened. The instant his hand landed on the second stele, rays of holy light lit up the entire venue once again. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Again?!

The jaws of the hall masters were no longer able to close as they stared at Huang Xiaolong blazing through the test.

As for the four supreme existences, they sank into silence as disbelief clouded their eyes.

“Could it be?!” The man they addressed as Heavenly Master pointed at the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows and the words that were about to leave his lips got stuck in his throat. The other three quickly drilled their gazes at the mysterious mark.

When they finally recognized it, their bodies jolted.

By the time Huang Xiaolong had passed the second stele, the entire venue was silent.

Fu Yunjie and the others wore a stunned expression as they looked at the monster up on the bridge. The only person who was pleasantly surprised and delighted was Di Huai.

Clenching his fists, Di Huai stared at Huang Xiaolong as excitement coursed through his veins. He knew that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t let him down, and he was right!

Casually stepping towards the third stele, Huang Xiaolong continued his test.

All of a sudden, Fu Yunjie snapped back to reality, and he screamed, “He’s definitely cheating! That wastrel on the bridge is using some sort of black magic to fool us!”

“He’s definitely cheating!”

The various experts broke into discussion and chaos erupted below the bridge.
