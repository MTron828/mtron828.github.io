Chapter 2284: Devouring Yang Rong

“Huang Xiaolong get down here!” Yang Rong roared with rage after his transformation. He glared at Huang Xiaolong as he leaped into the air to punch him.

As dragon qi filled the air, a gale arose in the arena.

A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he saw the transformation. Draconian? Dragon Beast Holy Martial Art? I’ll turn you into a dead dragon!

Releasing an ear-shattering dragon roar, Huang Xiaolong activated all three complete dao saint godheads and slapped down with his massive claw.

Boom!

Yang Rong, who was soaring in the sky to beat Huang Xiaolong down, was sent back down onto the stage.

As the arena shook, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he slapped down with his claws once again.

Without suspense, the arena rumbled as Yang Rong’s miserable cries broke through the air.

“Junior Brother Yang Rong!” Tan Hongyi, Qu Jiangmeng, and the others finally realized that things weren’t going as planned, and their expressions changed. They were confident that Yang Rong would be strong enough to defeat Huang Xiaolong after transforming, but he was smashed into the ground right before their eyes.

As Huang Xiaolong raised his claw, everyone saw that Yang Rong had turned into a human pancake as he laid sprawled on the ground. Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to crush him with another strike, Qu Jiangmeng and the others roared with rage, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you?”

As soon as the words left their lips, they got ready to interfere with the battle.

It was too bad that the guardians from the Holy Gate were ready to take action. Half-True Saints like Tan Hongyi couldn’t do a thing, as they were sent flying by the guardians, spitting out mouthfuls of blood.

What?!

Jiang Tian, Jiang Wuji, and Fàn Fān couldn’t believe their eyes.

Jiang Tian felt his world spinning.

Tan Hongyi was the third-ranked disciple in the Evolving Dragon Holy Grounds, and his talent and battle prowess were nothing to scoff at. He wasn’t an ordinary half-True Saint either! He had already completed his second tribulation, and he was a Second Tribulation Half-True Saint!

With his talent, he should be able to challenge even Third Tribulation Half-True Saints!

No one would have thought that a single strike from the Holy Gate’s guardian would send him flying!

It was clear that the guardian was no pushover. Without the strength of a Fourth Tribulation Half-True Saint, he wouldn’t be able to defeat Tan Hongyi with such ease.

When Tan Hongyi was sent flying away from the arena, Huang Xiaolong’s claw descended, and Yang Rong’s miserable shriek rang through the skies. His already flattened body was no longer able to take the beating and blood sprayed across the stage.

“Junior Brother Yang!” Tan Hongyi and the rest screamed.

“Huang Xiaolong, if you release my junior brother right now, we’ll give you five billion holy bills!” Tan Hongyi crawled to his feet and exclaimed in shock.

“Five billion? Is a Holy Prince of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground only worth five billion holy bills?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Qu Jiangmeng roared, “Huang Xiaolong, you better not overstep your boundaries!”

As soon as the words left Qu Jiangmeng’s lips, Huang Xiaolong’s claw slammed down again.

Once again, the arena shook.

Jiang Tian’s expression changed, and if he were to allow the situation to continue to play out, Yang Rong would really die at Huang Xiaolong’s hands!

Yang Rong and the others were there to celebrate Forefather Jiang’s birthday, and if he were to die at Huang Xiaolong’s hands in the central arena, the Jiang Family would be held responsible! The Evolving Dragon Holy Ground would direct all their rage onto the Jiang Family!

“Huang Xiaolong, if you release Holy Prince Yang Rong, there will be room for negotiation!” Jiang Tian yelled. “As long as you release him, we’ll give you half of the Jiang Family’s treasury!”

“You’ll be able to get five trillion holy bills at the very least!”

Five trillion!

Everyone couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath when they heard what Jiang Tian said. Even Fàn Fān, the sect chief of the Revered River Divine Sect jumped in fright.

As for the patriarchs of several smaller families, they nearly suffered from a stroke when they heard the amount.

A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Five trillion? That’s a pretty big number indeed. Should I be thanking you for your generosity? Oh right! Am I stupid? Didn’t we already agree that you would take out half your treasures if I won anyway? Jiang Tian, are you stupid?”

Flashes of red and green appeared on Jiang Tian’s face as killing intent spewed out from his eyes.

“What do you want?” Jiang Tian couldn’t help but suppressing the rage in his heart and asked.

“I want the entirety of your Jiang Family’s treasury!”

“What?!”

Jiang Tian, Jiang Wuji, and everyone else felt as though they heard him wrong.

The various experts from the other factions couldn’t help but stare at him in shock.

“You... Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far!” Jiang Tian roared to the heavens, and it seemed as though he wouldn’t be content if he couldn’t peel off the skin from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The accumulation of the Jiang Family’s treasury for the past several tens of billions of years was no small amount and Huang Xiaolong wanted all of it!

“Going too far?” Huang Xiaolong snorted. “Since that’s the case, I’ll kill Yang Rong here and now. Oh right. I gave you a chance to save him, but your Jiang Family refused. I guess he’ll die on behalf of your Jiang Family.” Huang Xiaolong raised Yang Rong into the air and devoured his saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique in an instant. In the blink of an eye, Yang Rong turned into a fried-up corpse.

“Junior Brother!” Tan Hongyi and the others raged as they rushed towards the arena. Too bad they were stopped by the guardians of the Holy Gate.

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong completed the refinement process and he ground Yang Rong’s body to dust. Looking at the enraged Tan Hongyi, Qu Jiangmeng, and the others, he smacked his hands together. “It’s the Jiang Family’s fault for choosing to abandon your Junior brother. You saw it for yourself. I had nothing to do with this.”

It was clear that he had brought up the matter of taking the entire treasury because he knew that the Jiang Family wouldn’t accept it. His main goal was to ruin the relationship between the Jiang Family and the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground anyway.

“Huang Xiaolong, stop sowing discord!” Jiang Tian raged, “You killed brother Yang Rong in the central arena, and this has nothing to do with my Jiang Family!”

Tan Hongyi glared at Huang Xiaolong with bloodshot eyes and snarled, “Huang Xiaolong, just you wait! Junior Brother Yang won’t die in vain!” Cupping his fists to Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji, he continued, “Brother Jiang Tian, Forefather Jiang, we shall no longer impose on you.”

He turned around and brought the members of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground and left the very next instant.

Even though they knew that Yang Rong’s death had nothing to do with the Jiang Family, Yang Rong was helping the Jiang Family to deal with Huang Xiaolong. Since Jiang Tian had refused to save him, the Jiang Family really couldn’t maintain their innocence. A trace of rage had already appeared in Tan Hongyi’s heart.

After seeing that the members of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground had left, Jiang Wuji and the others had no idea what to say.

Jumping off the stage, Huang Xiaolong quickly approached Jiang Tian and Jiang Wuji with a brilliant smile on his face. “Since I’ve won, I’ll have to trouble Forefather Jiang to give me half of your treasury! Oh yes, I should be able to save my friend’s disciple now, right?”

The look on the faces of the Jiang Family members was ugly to the extreme.
