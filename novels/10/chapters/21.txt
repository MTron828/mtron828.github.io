Chapter 22 : Just a Lowly Slave, What Qualifications?

Having heard Fei Hou’s explanation, it became clear to Huang Xiaolong why Fei Hou’s meridians were broken, and his body had such severe injuries.

“Sit down, let me first treat your injuries,” said Huang Xiaolong after pondering for a moment. He wanted to know more about the Asura’s Gate and its current situation, but with Fei Hou’s serious injuries, it was more important first to stabilize his condition.

“Sovereign, my body’s broken veins...” Fei Hou hesitated before asking.

In general, broken veins were incurable unless he could find those legendary elixirs.

“You don’t need to worry.” Huang Xiaolong waved his hand, said, “I can reconnect your veins, it’s just that it will take about six months.”

“Sovereign! You can reconnect my broken veins?” Fei Hou was very shocked; it was not that he doubted Huang Xiaolong, but he felt it was too bizarre! Could it be that the Sovereign was in possession of a legendary elixir?

“Sit down first.”

Fei Hou’s heart was filled with questions but he dared not defy orders. He answered respectfully and sat down. Once he sat down, Huang Xiaolong put his palms on Fei Hou’s back and circulated his internal energy, thereby transferring it to Fei Hou. In an instant, Fei Hou could feel warm energy enter his body; he quickly refocused his attention and coordinated with Huang Xiaolong, guiding the warm energy to nourish his body.

More than one hour passed.

Huang Xiaolong stopped, his face slightly pale.

Although his Body Metamorphose training had reached the fourth stage, his internal energy was still a bit weak. However, after having spent more than an hour of transferring internal energy to Fei Hou, he was now able to circulate the energy on his own to recover his strength.

Huang Xiaolong watched Fei Hou circulating internal energy to heal himself for a little while, and then he left the room and returned to his yard.

When Huang Peng saw his son return looking tired, he felt a little strange; didn’t his son go out with Li Lu to walk around the city?

“Xiaolong, are you okay?” Huang Peng asked

Seeing at his father’s concern, he laughed. “I’m fine Dad.”

Huang Peng let out a breath of relief, then asked, “Miss Li Lu has gone back?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

Suddenly, Huang Peng smiled, and his smile carried a strange flavor as his stare fixed on Huang Xiaolong, Huang Peng, quipped: “Isn’t Miss Li Lu’s hand very soft and smooth? Isn’t nice holding hands with a beauty?”

Huang Xiaolong blanked out for a moment before smiling: “I say, Old Man, what are talking about. There’s nothing going on between Miss Li Lu and me.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Huang Peng smiled and said, “Okay, I know there’s nothing between you and Li Lu, only Miss Li Lu has something with you.” When he said that, Huang Peng laughed happily “You don’t know this, but when Miss Li Lu pulled your hand on the way out that brat Huang Wei’s expression was so bad, it was like he ate dog shit.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head while smiling.

“But, Xiaolong, you have to be wary of Huang Wei.” said Huang Peng and his toned turned serious.

“I know Dad, don’t worry. If there is nothing else, I’ll be going back to my room,” said Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Peng nodded. “Okay, go and rest.”

After Huang Xiaolong got into his room, he took out the cold jade bed from Ring of Asura, sat on it then began to practice Asura Tactic. The night passed and morning came. Huang Xiaolong stopped his training, all the lethargy from yesterday had disappeared, leaving him feeling refreshed.

Leaving his room, Huang Xiaolong walked towards Fei Hou’s room; as he got there, coincidentally Fei Hou came out.

“I greet Sovereign, Sovereign invincible throughout the world!” Fei Hou saw Huang Xiaolong, immediately knelt down on one knee in salute. After Huang Xiaolong had helped him to treat his injury last night, his demeanor became even more respectful towards him.

“You can stand.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Only then Fei Hou did stand up respectfully.

“Fei Hou, when others are around, address me as young master.” Huang Xiaolong muttered in a low voice: “Also, stop lauding ‘Sovereign invincible throughout the world!’”

Every time Huang Xiaolong heard the sentence ‘Sovereign invincible throughout the world!’ he felt depressed even though he knew it was a rule set by Ren Wokuang, the previous Sovereign.

Fei Hou paused for a moment, then said, “Sovereign, ‘Sovereign Invincible throughout the world’, this sentence during salute was set by the previous Sovereign, if we stop...?”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and said: “I know that this rule was set by Master years ago, but rules are established by people. I’m the current Sovereign, and I say this rule is now abolished.”

Master? Fei Hou had been curious about Huang Xiaolong’s relation with the Old Sovereign. Hearing Xiaolong refer to the Old Sovereign as Master he now knew. Right, who else but the old Sovereign’s pro-disciple can be the Sovereign of Asura’s Gate?

Fei Hou Immediately responded: “As Sovereign ordered!”

“How’s your recovery?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Replying Sovereign, your subordinate’s injury has recovered about seventy percent, in three days my wounds should fully recover, but my veins...” Fei Hou’s words stopped here.

“You needn’t worry about your veins. Now, tell me about the current situation in Asura’s Gate.”

When Fei Hou heard that, his expression became complicated.

“What is it?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression he knew Huang Xiaolong had misunderstood, and quickly said: “Sovereign, it’s not that your subordinate is unwilling to report. Honestly, it’s just that subordinate is not very clear.”

“Not very clear?” Huang Xiaolong was startled.

“Yes.” Fe Hou nodded, he then explained to Huang Xiaolong. Fei Hou entered Asura’s Gate twenty years ago, and he had never been to Asura’s Gate headquarters. Twenty years ago he met an Elder from Asura’s Gate and was taken in as a disciple, and that was how he entered Asura’s Gate. His Master never talked to him about sect’s matters.

His Master’s name was Yu Ming.

“But Master did mention that after the Old Sovereign had disappeared fifty years ago, there was an internal struggle for the Sovereign’s position, resulting in Asura’s Gate splitting into two factions.” Fei Hou said.

“Split into two factions!” Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased, asked: “Where is your Master now?”

“Three years ago we separated and, since then, I haven’t seen Master. Back then, Master said he had something to do in Mohe Kingdom’s Imperial City.” Replied Fei Hou.

The Mohe Kingdom? Huang Xiaolong had heard about the Mohe Kingdom, but the distance from there to Luo Tong kingdom where Huang Xiaolong was located was too far. To reach the Mohe Kingdom from the Luo Tong Kingdom, he would need to pass through more than ten other kingdoms in between.

If it’s like this, getting a clear picture of the internal situation at Asura’s Gate is currently impossible.

At this moment, Li Lu ran over from afar; her face blossomed into a smile when she saw Huang Xiaolong, “Xiaolong, I knew you were here. Let’s go, the banquet is starting soon, let’s head over there now.”

Huang Xiaolong’s head started to ache when he saw Li Lu, he turned towards Fei Hou and said: “Come with me.”

“Yes, Young Master!” Fei Hou replied respectfully.

Although Li Lu was surprised to hear Fei Hou refer to Huang Xiaolong as Young Master, she did not think too much about it. She walked up to Huang Xiaolong and pulled his hand, running out from the yard; as if pulling Huang Xiaolong’s hand had become a habit of hers.

Huang Xiaolong wanted to retrieve his hand, but to his surprise, this time, the little girl gripped firmly, not letting go. He could only follow from behind. As they arrived at the banquet, they ran into Huang Peng’s group who just came.

When Huang Wei saw Li Lu holding Huang Xiaolong’s hand, his expression turned hideous, whereas Huang Peng was giving Huang Xiaolong an ambiguous smile while giving him a thumbs up, rendering Huang Xiaolong speechless!

Everyone took their seat after they entered the main hall, and Huang Qide’s groups’ seats were actually on the main table, seated together with Li Mu. Huang Xiaolong was about to sit when Li Lu came over and pulled him to a seat next to her and Fei Hou automatically stood behind Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Peng, Huang Qide, and the others had noticed Fei Hou’s presence behind Huang Xiaolong. They thought Huang Xiaolong bought Fei Hou yesterday at the slave’s market when he was going around the city; consequently, nobody asked anything.

“Fei Hou, find a place to seat on the sides.” Seeing Fei Hou standing behind him, when the seat beside was empty didn’t feel right, after all, Fei Hou was a Tenth Order Warrior.

Just as he spoke, Huang Wei’s spoke loudly in a haughty voice: “Sit? Huang Xiaolong, today is Old Patriarch Li’s birthday banquet; is a slave you bought qualified to sit in here?”
