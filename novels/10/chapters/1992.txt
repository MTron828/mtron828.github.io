“Ao Li is acting too arrogant! How can a Second Order Emperor like him think about taking down Dun Hao?! Does he really think that he is undefeatable after securing his victory over Caley and Brennus?! I’m afraid he won’t come close to beating Dun Hao, let alone defeating him in ten moves.”

One of the supreme geniuses from the Fire World couldn’t help but mock Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right. He might not even be able to take ten attacks from the Son of Light, Dun Hao!” One of the pontiffs sneered.

“Ao Li, hurry up and get down here! A Second Order Emperor like you will get destroyed by the Son of Light Dun Hao, in less than five moves! Stop embarrassing yourself!”

“Get down here! Dun Hao’s Emperor’s will would flatten you without even giving you the slightest chance to fight back. Come down now, and you might still make it!”

Several experts around the arena started to clamor and laugh at Huang Xiaolong. In the end, many people went along with it, and jeers filled the arena.

Eventually, the situation got worse, and all of them started insulting Huang Xiaolong. They even went as far as to curse his ancestors!

Ao Ping’s expression sank.

Hearing all the jeers, Dun Hao waved his hand to stop them. Only then did the mockery stop.

“Since you are confident of defeating me in ten moves, do you dare to make a bet with me?” Dun Hao stared at Huang Xiaolong with an expectant gaze.

A smile slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “What are we betting?”

“During the battle, hands and legs have no eyes. If I kill you by accident, all the treasures on your body will belong to me, including everything in the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures!” Dun Hao declared.

Huang Xiaolong nearly laughed out loud. “In the end, you are still lusting over the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures...!” He paused for a moment before continuing, “Sure. If you kill me, you can have the treasures. Before we start the battle, what do you think you can put up as a wager? Are you planning to use that broken armor on your body as stakes against the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures?”

The experts who were gathered around the arena couldn’t hold back their laughter.

Dun Hao’s face sank. The armor on his body was a mid-grade grandmist spiritual artifact. Even though it wasn’t bad, it was far too lacking in comparison to the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures. In fact, when Huang Xiaolong described it as a ‘broken armor,’ it wasn’t too far off if he wanted to use it as stakes to wager for the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures.

With no other choice, he pulled out a spatial ring and snapped, “As long as you defeat me, you can have everything in this ring! Of course, if you kill me, you can have it too. You can take everything I have on me!”

There were countless low-grade chaos spirit stones in the spatial ring, and there were several dozens chaos spiritual veins. As for priceless medicinal herbs, there was no lack of them. One wouldn’t be able to obtain a single one of those precious herbs even in auctions.

“Is that the Tailing Pill?! There are so many of them! There are probably several tens of thousands of them in that stash! After the Tailing Church was destroyed, no one has seen those pills!”

“Five Elements Spirit Pearl! The inheritance treasure of the Five Elements Church! That’s a top-grade grandmist artifact! It has many miraculous uses if one brings it around!”

“Golden Essence Mushroom! It’s a nineteenth rank Golden Essence Mushroom! A tenth rank Golden Essence Mushroom is considered a peerless treasure, but he managed to bring out the nineteenth rank Golden Essence Mushroom!”

Discussions broke out the moment the contents of the ring were revealed.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. It seems like Dun Hao has quite a lot of treasures. Even for someone like Huang Xiaolong, his heart shook when he saw the contents of the spatial ring.

For example, if Huang Xiaolong could refine the nineteenth rank Golden Essence Mushroom, he would be able to increase his strength. Even though it couldn’t be compared to the grandmist aura’s effects, it was good enough. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“How about that?” Dun Hao said to Huang Xiaolong. “There are many things in my spatial ring that you won’t be able to obtain with spirit stones.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “You should know that there are more than a hundred thousand bottles of Angel Soul Jade Divine Pills among the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures. There is also the complete sixteen levels of Radiance Divine Tome. Just the pills alone are worth infinitely more than the treasures in your spatial ring.”

A frown appeared on Dun Hao’s face. “What else do you want?!” Despite the annoyance he was feeling, he knew that the treasures in his spatial ring were far from enough to be used as a bet for the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures.

“Add on your Radiance Divine Seal and the treasury of the Radiance Divine City!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“What?! Ao Li doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth! Is he crazy?! How dare he ask for the Radiance Divine Seal and the Radiance Divine City’s treasury?!” One of the pontiffs exclaimed in surprise.

“Kill Ao Li! Your Highness, kill Ao Li for us!”

Several pontiffs raged at the side.

To them, Huang Xiaolong was going too far by setting his sights on the Radiance Divine Seal and the treasury of the Radiance Divine City.

As for Dun Hao, rage welled up in his heart. The Radiance Divine Spear appeared in his hand and he thrust it towards Huang Xiaolong without the slightest warning. He was so quick that no one in the audience reacted when he sent out the spear.

With his sudden attack, the spear appeared before Huang Xiaolong, aiming the space between his eyebrows. Ao Ping’s expression changed, but several pontiffs sneered at Huang Xiaolong’s misfortune. “Don’t tell me he is going to die from a single attack...”

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was ready for his attack. Reaching out, he blocked the Divine Radiance Spear with his arm. As the Glaze Devil Stele’s energy started to circulate in his body, a brilliant light emerged from his palm.

When the Divine Radiance Spear collided with Huang Xiaolong’s palm, an ear-piercing screech cut through the air. It was as though the spear was scratching chaos essence steel as sparks were produced.

The laughter stopped in an instant, and everyone stared at the scene before them with their mouths agape.

“What?!”

“The Radiance Divine Spear in His Highness Dun Hao’s hand is a mid-grade grandmist artifact!”

Huang Xiaolong managed to block a mid-grade grandmist artifact with his hand!

Everyone felt the blood draining from their faces. They had never expected ‘Ao Li’ to possess such terrifying might.

“I heard that Ao Li managed to block Caley’s low-grade grandmist battle ax with his bare arms. When the news had spread, I didn’t believe it! Now that he caught a mid-grade grandmist artifact with his bare hands, I have no choice but to believe it! That’s too messed up!” One of the old ancestors behind Qin Huangzhong yelled in shock.

Ao Ping felt a trace of shock run through his heart. He muttered to himself, “God d*mn! I knew you were strong, but this is too disgusting!”

Dun Hao wasn’t able to hide the shocked expression on his face. However, he retreated in an instant as he withdrew the spear he had thrust at Huang Xiaolong. He returned to the arena and acted as if he hadn’t moved.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother returning the attack. Instead, he stared at Dun Hao and said, “The first move.”

The first move! Was that a warning or a reminder?!

The expression on Dun Hao’s face sank.

“Alright! I had never expected you to be so strong!” Dun Hao growled in a low voice, “However, that was merely a warm-up. I hope that you will be able to defend against my next attack!” A long sword appeared in his arm after the words left his lips. As soon as the sword appeared, space seemed to shatter under the sword qi’s pressure he was emitting.

Without even looking at Dun Hao’s attack, everyone knew that the blade was peerlessly sharp.

“This... this is a high-grade grandmist artifact!” Everyone revealed a shocked expression the moment the sword appeared in Dun Hao’s hand.
