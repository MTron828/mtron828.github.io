Chapter 2198: Shocking the World

Several tens of minutes later...

Huang Xiaolong grabbed Yang Tianchen with his left hand, and he raised the Giant Kun Ruler with the other. With a swing of his arms, he threw them into the skies above the main hall of the Giant Kun Divine Palace.

They were nothing more than two lumps of meat, and no one could recognize them anymore. Both of them were beaten up by Huang Xiaolong so badly that they didn’t even resemble a ghost. It wasn’t even a battle. A one-sided beatdown was a better description as Huang Xiaolong was the only one attacking. No one knew how many times they were slapped or punched by Huang Xiaolong in the tens of minutes that passed.

By the time Huang Xiaolong threw them into the air, he had already sealed their strength with multiple layers of restrictions. Neither of them could circulate energy in their bodies.

The Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s experts no longer resisted as they stared at Huang Xiaolong with terror-filled eyes.

As for the members of the 33 Heavens Race, Huang Xiaolong joined hands with the rulers of the Heavenly Saint Country and Mighty God Heavenly Country to kill them down to the last man. Not a single member of the 33 Heavens Race who came remained.

Sitting on the throne of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms as he pulled the Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen before him.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong, as long as you release me, I promise you that my 33 Heavens Race will never trouble you again!” Yang Tianchen gasped for breath as he begged for mercy.

Even though his voice was as soft as a mosquito’s buzz, everyone in the hall heard him clearly.

“Release you, and the 33 Heavens Race will let me off?” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “There’s no need for you to worry about me. After killing you, I’ll take a trip down to your 33 Heavens Race’s territory!”

Huang Xiaolong’s intentions were as clear as day.

No longer wasting his breath to talk to Yang Tianchen, Huang Xiaolong pointed at the space between his eyebrows. A trace of purple light entered between Yang Tianchen’s brows to search his soul.

Several breaths later, the soul search was complete.

Four divine fires emerged to turn Yang Tianchen into a pile of ashes.

When the Giant Kun Ruler stared at the pile of dust beside him, he turned a shade paler. No matter who it was, they wouldn’t be able to face death without a shred of fear.

Of course, he also knew that there was no way for Huang Xiaolong to release him. Regardless of how much he begged, he was destined to die.

With bloodshot eyes, the Giant Kun Ruler raged, “Huang Xiaolong, the only thing I regret is that I didn’t head over to the Heavenly Saint Country in the past with Dong Cheng to kill you!”

Initially, Dong Cheng and the Heavenly Master had joined hands to attack the Heavenly Saint Country. As long as he had given them his assistance, there was no doubt he would have killed Huang Xiaolong.

Everything was too late now. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Admittedly, he would have given up everything to kill Huang Xiaolong if he had known what kind of monster he was facing. No one could have expected Huang Xiaolong to enter the peak of the late-Seventh Order Sovereign in such a short amount of time!

Other than the Giant Kun Ruler, it seemed as though there was someone else who was regretting his actions. Or rather, inaction. The leader of the 33 Heavens Race would be the next in line to regret his actions...

The Giant Kun Ruler snickered in his heart.

That was the last thought that flashed through his mind.

Hatred and regret filled his mind as he passed through the final moment of his life.

Huang Xiaolong searched through his memories like he had done to Yang Tianchen. After looking through the entire life of the Giant Kun Ruler, Huang Xiaolong summoned the four divine fires and reduced him to ashes.

Next, he turned to look at the generals and Sovereign-level experts who were from the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

With no exceptions, every single one of them got to their knees.

When everything went down, General Li Tian who was sent to the Myriad of Worlds was currently bringing Huang Peng, Shi Xiaofei, and the other members of the Huang Family to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

“Only half an hour before I return...” A sigh of relief left his lips when he finally saw the appearance of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

He knew that as soon as he returned, the ruler would reward him heavily!

Staring at Huang Peng, Shi Xiaofei, and the others behind him, a sneer formed on his face. He had tortured them a whole bunch during the return journey and if not for the ruler’s order to bring back living captives, he would have tortured them to death!

“Hurry up!” Swinging the whip in his hand, he lashed out at Huang Peng who was moving a little slowly than the others. In an instant, Huang Peng was sent reeling.

Everyone stared at him in rage.

“What are you looking at? Believe me that I’ll dig out your eyes if you keep looking?”

In that very instant, all of the Huang Family members turned to look at the figure who appeared behind Li Tian.

After seeing the familiar figure again, everyone felt a trace of joy running through their hearts. A joyous expression appeared on their faces and it was especially so for Shi Xiaofei! Blood rushed towards her face and she blushed.

“Xiaolong!”

“Xiaolong is still alive!”

“Hahah! I knew Big brother won’t die!”

Huang Peng, Su Yan, Huang Min, and the others cheered as tears of joy streamed down their faces.

When Li Tian had located them, he had told them that Huang Xiaolong had died in a place outside the 33 heavens when he was swallowed by some sort of lightning barrage. Along the way, they had also heard a lot of discussions about Huang Xiaolong’s death.

They had fallen into a state of despair and not the slightest trace of hope had remained in their hearts when they realized that the news was most probably true.

However...

Li Tian couldn’t help but stare at them in shock for a moment. However, he burst out laughing the next moment. “You guys are delusional. You’re on the brink of death and you’re losing your mind! Didn’t I tell you that Huang Xiaolong died when he was swallowed by the lightning barrage in the space outside the 33 heavens? Stop imagining things!”

When people got to a certain point of desperation, it was true that they would experience hallucinations.

Everyone couldn’t help but stare at him in stunned silence.

Imagining things?

How were they imagining things?! He was right there!

“How are they delusional?” A cold voice rang from behind Li Tian. Even though he wasn’t shouting, Huang Xiaolong’s voice contained an unconcealable trace of killing intent.

This...

Could it be?

Li Tian twisted his body and stared at the unusually handsome face he could never forget as long as he lived. Albeit, it was for a different reason...

“Huang...” Li Tian’s expression changed.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab his throat before he could continue. Raising him into the air, Huang Xiaolong started to clench his fist. Sounds of cracking bones could be heard.

Huang Xiaolong crushed Li Tian’s windpipe before sealing his strength. After tossing him to the side, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he rushed towards the members of the Huang Family.

When Huang Peng and the others stared at Li Tian who was rolling on the ground, whimpering in pain, they knew that it wasn’t an illusion! Huang Xiaolong hadn’t died! They didn’t hesitate as they swarmed towards him.

“Xiaolong!” “Big brother!”

They quickly surrounded him as they celebrated his return.

“Dad... Mom...” Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of warmth blooming in his heart. He turned to Shi Xiaofei and he hugged her without saying a second word.

Even after their many years of relationship, Shi Xiaofei felt her face turning red when Huang Xiaolong hugged her tightly.

“Xiaolong, there are so many people here!” Shi Xiaofei lowered her head and pouted.

In the blink of an eye, everyone turned away and they chuckled, “We didn’t see anything!”

Laughter filled the skies and Huang Xiaolong quickly retrieved several divine pills for them to treat their injuries.

As for Li Tian, Huang Xiaolong decided to bring him back to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

While Huang Xiaolong made his way back to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, the news of him killing the Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen had already started to spread through the lands.

There wasn’t a single power who could sit still when they received the news!
