Looking at the seventy-plus Ice Dragons hovering in the air around Huang Xiaolong, even Chiyou subconsciously sucked in a breath of cold air.

Over seventy Ice Dragons!

All of them were Ninth Order Emperor Realm and above! Of course, this was not the reason Chiyou was caught off guard. He was aware that these Ice Dragons’ power was not as simple as one plus one equals two after being by the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s side for many years.

He knew the terror of the Ice Dragon Race’s Ice Dragon Formation.

Chiyou knew, and so did Violent Lightning.

“Withdraw!”

Without any hesitation, Chiyou bellowed and turned around to flee.

But his body barely turned when eight giant palms whistled across space, brimming with vigorous darkness chaos qi, and slammed on him like eight great chaos mountains.

Chiyou bellowed as his palms slapped out in counterattack. Devil qi rushed out, condensing into a shield of blacklight beams that shot straight towards the eight giant palms.

Boom⸺!

The earth-shattering blast knocked Chiyou into the air, and he landed unsteadily on his feet. He staggered several hundred steps before regaining his balance.

The Black Killer Sect and Hundred Transformation Sect’s experts paled at this sight. When they turned to see the attackers, four massive figures of the four odd beasts dominated their view and blocked their paths of escape.

“You guys!”

Chiyou was beyond shock.

Chiyou had not fought against the four odd beasts before. Hence, he had assumed that the four odd beasts’ strength was more or less on the same level as the Three Skull Ancestors. But he realized at this moment that he was greatly mistaken. The four odd beasts had reverted to their true bodies, and they were one level higher than the Three Skull Ancestors!

The four odd beasts’ attacks actually sent him staggering back! The Three Skull Ancestors were absolutely incapable of this feat.

Huang Xiaolong, who had been watching, spoke again, “Chiyou, Violent Lightning, why are you two in a rush to leave? Haven’t you all been looking for me and the Glaze Devil Stele high and low recently? The Glaze Devil Stele is in my hands.”

“What?! The Glaze Devil Stele is in your hands!” Excitement surged within Violent Lightning Archdevil and the others upon hearing that.

A light glimmered from Huang Xiaolong’s body as the Glaze Devil Stele flew out from within him. The Glaze Devil Stele emitted brilliant rays as it hovered above his head; the lights were so mesmerizing and dazzling.

Violent Lightning Archdevil, Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor Chen Xie, and the others stared at the Glaze Devil Stele with burning gazes and undisguised greed.

Even Chiyou could not maintain his calm facade at this point.

“You have already refined the Glaze Devil Stele?!” Chiyou suddenly screamed. He was one of the twelve Archdevil generals under the Heavenless Archdevil Lord and had a better knowledge of the Glaze Devil Stele than others. It didn’t take him long to detect the connection between Huang Xiaolong and the Glaze Devil Stele.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “That’s right.” He wasn’t surprised Chiyou could tell, then again, so what?

Hearing Huang Xiaolong admit that he had already refined the Glaze Devil Stele, the Violent Lightning, Chen Xie, Cui Huajie, and the others’ heartstrings snapped. Their faces were filled with disbelief and strong denial.

“You, how is it possible?!” Cui Huajie screamed. “Impossible, it has only been a few years. It should have been impossible for you to refine it in this short amount of time!”

Huang Xiaolong responded blasely, “I forgot to inform you, in truth, the Myriad Curses Devil Stele is also mine now.”

His words wholly rendered Chiyou, Violent Lightning, and others stupefied.

The Three Skull Ancestors also had the same reaction. The Myriad Curses Devil Stele was also in Huang Xiaolong’s hands? They had only known that Huang Xiaolong had the Glaze Devil Stele.

While everyone was standing stupidly in a daze, there was another glimmer of light from Huang Xiaolong’s body as the Myriad Curses Devil Stele flew out.

Seeing the Myriad Curses Devil Stele, Cui Huajie, Chen Xie, and others’ breathing was twice as heavy.

The Glaze Devil Stele and the Myriad Curses Devil Stele, that was already one-third of the Six Great Devil Steles, right in front of them! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You actually succeeded in refining both devil steles?” Even Chiyou felt what he was seeing before him was too incredible to be believable, and the words ran from his mouth. In a few years, Huang Xiaolong had not only refined two devil steles but had succeeded in fully refining them!

Huang Xiaolong went on naturally, “Of course, it’s because I successfully refined the two devil steles that I broke through to Emperor Realm!”

The aura of an Emperor Realm rushed out from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The low-level Emperor Realm experts of Black Killer Sect and Hundred Transformation Sect felt their breaths stagnated in their chests, and they were startled.

“Em-Emperor!” Chiyou, Violent Lightning, Chen Xie, Cui Huajie, and the others were taken aback.

They weren’t shocked because Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had improved, but because they understood what it meant by Huang Xiaolong, the Nether King had stepped into the Emperor Realm.

From then on, Huang Xiaolong had truly become the Lord of Hell!

“Actually, the Glaze Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele are not all that I have. In the past, while still at the Divine World, I found the Blood Eye Devil Stele.”

Huang Xiaolong went on, “It is because of the Blood Eye Devil Stele that I was able to locate the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele in the Kingdom of Devil Beasts in a short time!”

A blood-red glow flickered as the Blood Eye Devil Stele emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Glaze Devil Stele, Myriad Curses Devil Stele, and Blood Eye Devil Stele hovered around Huang Xiaolong, glowing in their unique lights and exuding their unique auras.

Violent Lightning Archdevil, Chen Xie, Cui Huajie, and everyone else were stunned agape.

“Three, three devil steles!”

That was already half the number of the Six Great Devil Steles! Chiyou’s face clouded darkly. What does this mean? It meant Huang Xiaolong was already half the master of Devil World!

Earlier, when he had seen Huang Xiaolong reveal the Glaze Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele, he had thought that Huang Xiaolong was showing off. But now, he finally understood Huang Xiaolong’s real intention.

As expected, Huang Xiaolong spoke, “I have already gathered three of the Six Great Devil Steles. In theory, I am already half the master of the Devil World. I will surely get the remaining three devil steles as well. So, Chiyou, and Violent Lightning, since you both were the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s subordinates in the past, and have fought by his side by being loyal and meritorious to the Devil World, I can pardon your past mistakes if you submit to me now.”

Not only Chiyou, even Violent Lightning, Chen Xie, Cui Huajie, and the others didn’t look very good. Chiyou and Violent Lightning were struggling internally to make a decision.

“Lord Chiyou,” Suddenly, the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Old Ancestor Chen Xie’s anxious voice broke the tensed atmosphere, “Don’t fall into Huang Xiaolong’s scheme. If Huang Xiaolong really becomes our Devil World’s Archdevil Lord, the first people he would kill will be you! We’ve been hunting him all this time. How would he be willing to spare us!”

“That’s right, Lord Chiyou. All of us should attack with full force. We can surely kill Huang Xiaolong.” The Black Killer Sect Chief Chui Huajie yelled anxiously and added, “When he dies, the three devil steles will belong to Lord Chiyou, and Lord Chiyou will be our Devil World’s new master!”

“Huang Xiaolong is the Lord of Hell and an outsider to the Devil World. He can’t be allowed to become our Devil World’s master! Even if the Heavenless Archdevil Lord were here, he too would be unwilling to let an outsider like Huang Xiaolong become the new Archdevil Lord!” Chiyou raised his head and shouted to the sky. At the same time, his murderous fist swung towards Huang Xiaolong, devil qi rushing out.

“Huang Xiaolong, you want me to submit to you?! Go back to hell!” His other hand reached out to grab the three devil steles. Space shook violently as he tried to separate Huang Xiaolong, and the devil steles in different spaces.

However, when Chiyou attacked, the seventy-plus Ice Dragons by Huang Xiaolong’s side swung their tails. Icy cold qi submerged the world, freezing Chiyou’s fist force in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned frosty, “Annoyingly persistent!”
