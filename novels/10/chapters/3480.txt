Chapter 3481: Supreme Expert With Two Small Worlds

When the Ice King escaped from the sealed space, Huang Xiaolong’s ice blades tore through the void to slash straight into his body. With a toss, the Ice King was sent flying towards the ground.

The blast reverberated through the skies, and the Yin Yang Road of Death started to tremble.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the blades of ice and allowed them to land on his body. He made his way towards the Ice King.

With a look of fear in his eyes, the Ice King stared at Huang Xiaolong. “You… You… You broke through to the God of Creation Realm?”

In the Ice Palace, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a God of Creation yet. However, he managed to kill everyone that stood in his way, and Shi Li had no choice but to run. Now that Huang Xiaolong had entered the God of Creation Realm, how terrifying would he be?!”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Despair filled the Ice King’s heart.

In the past, he held on to a trace of hope that he would be able to escape with his life intact. Now, the rays of hope were extinguished.

Half an hour later…

The Ice King kneeled before Huang Xiaolong and submitted.

Like before, Huang Xiaolong preferred them to call him ‘His Highness’.

Before he broke through to the God of Creation Realm, it was hard for him to control experts at that level. Now, he could do so with ease.

There wasn’t a need to bring the Ice King up. Even God of Creation Realm experts who had accumulated more than 4 billion units of grand cosmos energy wouldn’t be able to withstand Huang Xiaolong’s control. Naturally, he would have to use a lot of effort to control them.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After subduing the Ice King, Huang Xiaolong planned to leave the Yin Yang Road of Death. However, a flash of white light appeared before him and an undead corpse appeared.

It was the same one he met previously.

However, the corpse didn’t attack Huang Xiaolong. Instead, it made a welcoming gesture.

Huang Xiaolong stared at it in shock.

He didn’t expect an undead corpse to possess sentience.

The Ice King was equally as shocked.

When he entered the Yin Yang Road of Death, he met many undead corpses. That was the first time he met one who possessed consciousness.

“Let’s go take a look,” Huang Xiaolong mentioned.

“Your Highness, there might be something wrong with all this…” The Ice King hesitated for a moment.

“It’s fine.” Waving his arm, Huang Xiaolong followed behind the corpse. They soared through several layers of space.

In the past, the undead corpse was saved by someone, and it showed that someone controlled it. Now, it seemed as though the owner of the corpse wished to meet him. Huang Xiaolong was indeed a little curious about the expert who could control an undead corpse like that.

There was actually a large completion stage God of Creation on the Yin Yang Road of Death! Moreover, he was stronger than Chong Wufeng! Anyone would be curious about an expert of that level.

The Ice King was cautious as he followed behind Huang Xiaolong. He observed his surroundings carefully.

Half a day later, they entered a sealed-off space and they saw a beauty clad in unassuming robes.

Huang Xiaolong and the Ice King were shocked by her extreme beauty. It was as though a goddess had descended from the heavens to grace them with her presence.

“I am Wang Meiqi. It’s good to meet my fellow cultivators.” Her voice rang in their ears, and it was extremely pleasing to hear.

Huang Xiaolong and the Ice King cupped their fists in response.

“Please, join me.” Wang Meiqi invited.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong accepted the invitation without thinking too much about it.

With her strength, she could have dealt with him when he was breaking through. There was no need to wait for such a long time. As such, he wasn’t afraid that she had ulterior motives for inviting them over.

The Ice King hesitated for a moment, but he chose to remain silent when he saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid.

After entering the palace, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the interior was extremely simple. Despite that, the placement of the furniture correlated with the grand dao. Huang Xiaolong knew that her understanding of the grand dao was above his.

When the three finally sat down…

“I’m sure you’re curious about my identity…” Wang Meiqi asked the moment they sat.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

“I’m like the two of you. I was an expert who reached the grand perfection level, and I entered the God of Creation Realm here on the Yin Yang Road of Death. However, I chose to remain here after breaking through. I have been cultivating here to this day.”

Huang Xiaolong and the Ice King stared at her in shock.

Wang Meiqi chose to cultivate on the Yin Yang Road of Death ever since she broke through.

It was no wonder…

God of Creation Realm experts were unable to enter the Yin Yang Road of Death, but she could choose not to leave!

However, the Yin Yang Road of Death was a desolate land. Every single day they lived there was another day of torture. Everyone who entered the God of Creation Realm would choose to leave the moment they got the chance. Wang Meiqi was the only person who chose to remain there.

However, another question came to Huang Xiaolong’s mind. How long has she been here if she cultivated to the large completion stage?!

“I didn’t choose to remain here because I had nothing to do… I was trying to escape from my enemies,” Wang Meiqi explained.

Enemies?

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Ice King in shock.

“Fellow Cultivator Wang should have reached the large completion stage… I wonder who your enemy is?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

“I’m close to the grand completion stage.”

She was at the peak of the large completion stage, and Huang Xiaolong was taken aback once again.

There might only be several large completion stage God of Creation Realm experts, but they could still be found if one looked around the universe. For someone to reach the grand completion stage, they would have to possess almost 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. Luckily for him, he didn’t anger the other party previously. If she chose to give him a random slap in the past, he might never be able to see the light of day.

However, he became even more curious about her enemy.

“The person who wants to kill me is called Mei Jie!”

“Mei Jie?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the Ice King. There didn’t seem to be a God of Creation called Mei Jie in the universe.

“Actually, I’m not from this universe,” Wang Meiqi explained. “I managed to run over here by chance, and I entered the Yin Yang Road of Death to cultivate.

“In my universe, Mei Jie is a God of Creation at the grand completion stage! He’s extremely close to becoming a supreme being, and he’s the most terrifying genius in our universe” Wang Meiqi paused for a second and continued, “Well, he’s the most talented person I’ve seen since I met you!”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly.

Could it be?

“He managed to create two small worlds!” Wang Meiqi sighed after some time.
