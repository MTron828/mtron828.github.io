Chapter 3652: Not Worthy?

As everyone turned to look in the distance, a shockingly beautiful woman approached the palace. Behind her were more than a hundred experts at the God of Creation Realm!

She was none other than Yu Xiaohong, the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!

Even though she had been trapped on the Bewilderment Island for countless years and her reputation was no longer as resounding, everyone knew that she was a supreme expert who had more than 14 billion units of combat strength! One had to know that there were hardly any female cultivators in the Unknown Lands who could break through the 10 billion units mark.

Her appearance caused a commotion to ripple through the crowd. It was no less than when Wu Xin and Ye Ye brought over so many God of Creation Realm experts… After all, everyone present knew that Patriarch Jian Weifeng had been rejected twice by her.

Kong Shao looked at Yu Xiaohong and the uneasy feeling in his heart grew stronger. “She shouldn’t be here…”

“Ancestor, what’s wrong?” Kong Fanxing asked.

“Yu Xiaohong’s relationship with Jian Weifeng has never been good. According to logic, she wouldn’t bother coming over to attend their ceremony. Also, she injured Jian Xiyuan, Jian Chengfeng, and robbed the Unparalleled Sword Manual from them not too long ago. Isn’t she asking for trouble by showing up?”

“She injured Jian Xiyuan?!” Kong Fanxing gasped. “She even robbed the Unparalleled Sword Manual of the Jian Family!”

“I heard that Lord Jian Wushuang flew into rage when he learned of it. He planned to deal with the Xiaohong Celestial Empire after the ceremony. Who would have thought that she would send herself over?” Kong Shao sighed.

Kong Fanxing guessed, “Is it possible she came to apologize to Lord Jian Wushuang? She might have regretted her actions after obtaining Lord Jian Wushuang’s sword manual and plan to use the chance where he’s in a good mood to admit her mistakes. He might just let her off the hook.”

Kong Shao couldn’t think of any way to refute that and he sighed, “Perhaps…”

However, was that really the case?

Jian Weifeng was also taken aback when he heard her arrival.

“Patriarch, do you think she came over to apologize to the old ancestor?” Jian Chao laughed.

A weird light flashed in Jian Weifeng’s eyes but a flash of joy soon appeared in them. “Let’s hope so…”

However, Huang Xiaolong frowned when he heard the two announcements. “What are they here for? Do they want to join in the fun or something?”

He naturally referred to Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong.

Cao Dehong chuckled at the side, “Lord Wu Xin and Lord Ye Ye probably can’t rest easy when they learned that you were coming to the Jian Family…”

“Me? What do they have to worry about?!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement.

“Who is Lord Wu Xin and Lord Ye Ye?” Tao Han’er asked all of a sudden. Not many people knew their true names, and it wasn’t a surprise that Tao Han’er was confused.

“Lord Huang, shall I bring you to look for my old ancestor now?” Tao Han’er asked.

“Jian Wushuang? Why would you need to bring me to meet him?” Huang Xiaolong raised his eyebrow slightly and nearly burst out laughing.

“You… You killed two grand elders of the family yesterday! The old ancestor flew into a rage when he heard about it. Lord Huang, if you apologize to him, he should forgive you…” Tao Han’er lowered her head and whispered.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t control his laughter anymore. “Are you afraid that I won’t be able to beat him?”

Tao Han’er thought for a second before nodding her head seriously. “Yeah… He broke through the 20 billion units mark and his sword dao reached the universe level. Other than the five overlords of the Unknown Lands, no one is his opponent! Even though Lord Huang is strong, you… You might not be able to defeat him… Lord Huang, you don’t know this, but Ancestor Wushuang showed me the power of his universe level sword dao! He slashed through the void with a single slash! Not even Uncle Weifeng could see the limit of his strike!”

“Universe-level sword dao?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow slightly.

It had to be pretty strong if Jian Weifeng failed to see its limits.

“Yeah!” Tao Han’er nodded solemnly. “If I manage to become half as strong as Ancestor Wushuang, that would be great!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and said half-jokingly, “Alright! I’ll have a taste of his sword dao later to experience it for myself!”

Falling silent for a moment, Tao Han’er muttered to herself, “Alright… I’ll tell Ancestor Wushuang to control himself…”

Laughter left Huang Xiaolong’s lips and he didn’t continue talking about it.

As the few of them arrived outside the main hall, Jian Bifei arrived. He stopped Huang Xiaolong and the rest.

“Big Brother Bifei, what are you doing?” Tao Han’er snapped.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Little Sister Han’er, you might not know, but only those who received our invitation will be able to enter the inner hall. All of them were invited by Ancestor Wushuang himself. Moreover, Lord Gui Chi, Elder Baixuan Tian, the Limitless Master, the King of the Ocean Race, and several other supreme experts are in there right now. If you offend them by bringing in so many people, Ancestor Wushuang might get angry! I’m not letting you in in case you offend the old ancestor!” Jian Bifei added.

Tao Han’er started to hesitate. She turned to Huang Xiaolong and said, “Lord Huang, Father, why don’t you wait for me out here for some time? I’ll go in and talk to our old ancestor to tell him about your arrival!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded as he didn’t wish to put Tao Han’er on the spot. He found a random seat with the others.

Those who could enter the inner hall were experts who had broken through the 10 billion units mark. Those sitting in the outer hall were experts who were half-step Universe Gods or Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. There were also several individuals of the younger generation.

When the experts around saw Huang Xiaolong sitting down, they retreated to the side in case they were associated with him.

“Is he the Blue Dragon Young Master who killed two grand elders of the Jian Family?”

“Heh, he dares to show his face here. I heard that Jian Weifeng has already sworn to kill him the moment the ceremony ends!”

“He’s familiar with Princess Han’er and she should plead on his behalf…”

“If Jian Weifeng is hell bent on killing him, even Princess Han’er won’t be able to save him…”

Their discussion entered Huang Xiaolong’s ears, but he couldn’t be bothered with them. Naturally, all of them thought that he wouldn’t be able to do anything to them since they were in the Jian Family.

“That brat… He’s just a toad lusting over swan’s meat. Princess Han’er is definitely going to inherit Lord Jian Wushuang’s sword dao in the future. He’s overestimating himself!”

“That’s right! Weren’t there rumors of him getting close to Lord Yu Xiaohong? What a shameless man! How can someone like that be associated with Princess Han’er?”

The more they spoke, the angrier Cao Dehong and the rest became. In a fit of rage, Cao Dehong and the others got to their feet.
