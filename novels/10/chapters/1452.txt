Colorful Balloons Take Flight

During these three days, Elder Bai and Zhang Dong witnessed that all disciples who had come across Huang Xiaolong were sent flying with one punch! All of them were resolved with one punch!

Even if Huang Xiaolong’s opponent was a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple, it still took only one move!

One punch sent a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple flying!

But Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm was only at peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

“This kid is really surprising ah.” Zhang Dong chuckled, there was delight in his heart, and other complicated feelings.

Before seeing this, he had hoped that Huang Xiaolong would perform well, the more outstanding the better, but now, he found Huang Xiaolong’s performance had greatly exceeded his expectations—it was simply bewildering!

The problem was, Huang Xiaolong’s performance was too eye-catching, on top of that, his current ranking on the rankings list had caught the attention of other Grand Elders and Hall Masters as well.

Zhang Dong wasn’t worried about those Grand Elders, but he worried about other Hall Masters competing with him for Huang Xiaolong.

Whereas Elder Bai grew increasingly astounded watching Huang Xiaolong’s performance. How the heck did this kid cultivate his True Dragon Physique to be so powerful?!

Even a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple was sent flying with only one punch!

Although they couldn’t tell if Huang Xiaolong had used any godforce from the mirror jade’s images, or how much godforce he had employed, just the fact that he could send a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple flying backward, with only one punch was shocking enough for them.

Zhang Dong said to Elder Bai wryly, “This kid’s doing too well, too eye-catching. Now, I am hoping for him to be a little more average.”

Elder Bai looked around the hall and noticed that the other Hall Masters were talking about Huang Xiaolong. The mirror jades in front of them were also showing images of Huang Xiaolong.

Hearing Zhang Dong’s lament, Elder Bai reassured him, “Rest assured, Hall Master. If you want him to be your disciple, Huang Xiaolong would surely choose you as his Master given your identity.”

Even as Elder Bai said this, his confidence faltered a little.

Zhang Dong’s status and identity were in the top five among the Hall Masters in the Fortune Emperor Palace. Elder Bai noticed the Enforcement Hall Master and Medicine Hall Master who had equivalent status as Zhang Dong, paying attention to Huang Xiaolong. This was making him feel a little uncertain about what he said earlier.

Judging from their expressions, they too were looking interested in accepting Huang Xiaolong as their disciple.

“Let’s hope so.” Zhang Dong shook his head as a wry smile hung on his face.

Elder Bai suddenly exclaimed in a hushed whisper, “Hall Master, look!”

Zhang Dong’s gaze fell onto the mirror jade due to Elder Bai’s exclamation. On the mirror jade surface, it showed that Huang Xiaolong had arrived at some valley, and in this valley, Huang Xiaolong encountered a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple.

The two stood face to face with one another.

“Who is that disciple?” Zhang Dong was referring to the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple.

Elder Bai took out the jade tablet containing details of the registered disciples. His divine sense swept over the jade tablet and he immediately confirmed the disciple’s identity.

“The disciple’s name is Chen Lei, from the East Domain branch, and he has a top emperor rank White Flames Godhead.” Elder Bai reported.

Zhang Dong nodded, “Ranked at one hundred and sixty-two top emperor rank White Flames Godhead; this White Flames Godhead’s white flames are said to be invincible against same realm opponents. I’m curious, if Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique can withstand these white flames?”

Elder Bai smiled as he responded, “Even though the White Flames Godhead’s white flames are hailed as invincible against same cultivation realm opponents, I think Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique could withstand it. Nonetheless, it’s definitely going to be much more difficult for Huang Xiaolong to defeat Chen Lei, when compared to the other disciples he has come across so far in this competition.”

Zhang Dong smiled, “Even if you kill me, I don’t think Huang Xiaolong can send Chen Lei flying with one punch.”

Zhang Dong had barely finished his words, when they saw the images on the mirror jade flicker as Chen Lei suddenly attacked with his palm aimed at Huang Xiaolong’s chest. Startling white flames formed into a giant flaming white serpent and it opened its jaws to swallow up Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong simply struck his palm out as he saw this. His right palm actually passed through the giant flaming white serpent, and the white serpent scattered like sand.

Huang Xiaolong’s palm force landed on Chen Lei’s chest in the blink of an eye. Blood spurted out from his mouth as his body crashed into the valley wall behind him, sliding limply to the ground.

Zhang Dong stared stupidly at the mirror jade.

It’s still one move!

But it was not one punch, it was one palm!

At the same time, Zhang Dong keenly noticed that the whole hall had gone pin drop silent.

He looked over his shoulder and saw that the Elders, Grand Elders, and other Hall Masters in the hall were also agape as they stared at the mirror jades in front of them.

Zhang Dong smiled wryly and lamented, “Is this kid an ancient Emperor’s reincarnation?’”

This notion had appeared in his mind early on.

Elder Bai also had a wry smile on his face. “Even if he’s an ancient Emperor’s reincarnation, it’s not an average ancient Emperor.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The average ancient Emperor’s reincarnations were not as shocking as Huang Xiaolong was.

A peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple had sent a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm flying with one palm strike. Moreover, it wasn’t just any peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple! This level of talent, this level of talent—!

“This Huang Xiaolong, he’s mine!” Suddenly, an overbearing voice reverberated in the hall.

Zhang Dong turned to look and saw the speaker was the Enforcement Hall’s Hall Master Gongsun Chi!

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s godhead was only a high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead, the amazing battle strength Huang Xiaolong had displayed so far had made Gongsun Chi determined to accept Huang Xiaolong as his disciple at all cost!

“Yours, don’t joke!” At the same time, another voice refuted Gongsun Chi, “ This Huang Xiaolong would be my disciple, Xu Wen’s disciple!”

Xu Wen was the Medicine Hall’s Hall Master!

“Xu Wen, I had yielded Linlin to you in the past, yet you still want to compete over Huang Xiaolong with me?!” The Enforcement Hall Master Gongsun Chi’s eyes turned scarlet as he glared at Xu Wen, and a violent air swirled from his body.

In the last batch of disciples, the two of them had fought for a female disciple named Linlin. In the end, Linlin had ended up worshiping the Medicine Hall’s Hall Master Xu Wen as Master.

Medicine Hall Master Xu Wen snickered, “What do you mean you yielded to me? What a nice term, as it was Linlin who had chosen to enter my Medicine Hall.”

Both the Enforcement Hall and Medicine Hall’s Grand Elders, and Elders exchanged silent glances. None of them dared to utter a single word. It was no secret to the entire Fortune Emperor Palace that the Enforcement Hall Master and Medicine Hall Master did not see eye to eye.

Zhang Dong kept silent at this.

......

Soon, one month went by.

During this one month, Huang Xiaolong’s ranking had climbed up to the third place! He had surpassed Liu Qin and was now chasing behind Fu Feiyu!

After watching Huang Xiaolong kick Liu Qin down to the fourth place and rise to the third place, the Hall Masters, Grand Elders, and Elders in the hall experienced a surreal feeling. Liu Qin was an early First Order God King Realm master ah, whereas Huang Xiaolong was only a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm.

Right at this point, Huang Xiaolong’s name suddenly glimmered once again. The higher echelons in the hall saw Fu Feiyu’s name in third place, while Huang Xiaolong’s name took over the second position!

Second place!

Right behind the supreme godhead genius Peng Xiao.

Peng Xiao had 623 Fortune Divine Fruits, and Huang Xiaolong had 598 Fortune Divine Fruits—only twenty plus fruits’ difference between them!

...

Somewhere in the depths of Fortune Emperor Palace, there was a stalwart middle-aged man in meditation. There were numerous streaks of lightning zigzagging around this middle-aged man; these numerous lightning streaks appeared in various forms, from flood dragons to ancient lightning beasts, and even mimicked the chaos space.
