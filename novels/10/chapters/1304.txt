“What? He is a disciple of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate?” Wang Yu was shocked when he learned this information.

Wang Yu had an inkling of Huang Xiaolong’s talent when he was still in the lower realm, thus, he was not too surprised when he heard that Huang Xiaolong had defeated Wangu Clan’s Wangu Ziy. But what shocked him the most was the fact that Huang Xiaolong was a disciple of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate.

This was because Huang Xiaolong and the Fortune Gate had been mortal enemies when Huang Xiaolong was in the lower realm.

Li Zhi spoke, “I have heard about Huang Xiaolong. He is the current champion of the Vientiane World’s Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle, and on top of that, he is the personal disciple of Fortune Gate’s Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s. Moreover, it seems like he also has quite an unbelievable luck because he was able to find a source of grandmist aura, and he also possesses the True Dragon Physique!”

The current champion of the Vientiane World’s Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle!

And a personal disciple of Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor from the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate!

Grandmist aura!

These sentences sounded like thunderclaps in Wang Yu’s mind.

“Then, what is his strength now?” Wang Yu asked with great curiosity.

“According to the rumors, he currently is a late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm.” Li Zhi answered with a cold glint in his eyes.

“What—?! Late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!” Wang Yu shrieked.

Wang Yu was certain that Huang Xiaolong had ascended to the Divine World much later than him. He had experienced many fortuitous adventures in the years following his ascension to the Divine World,and he even had guidance from the Ancestors from Black Region World’s Fortune Gate, yet his cultivation was only at early Fourth Order Ancient God Realm, but on the other hand, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had reached the late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm!”

“I have heard that Huang Xiaolong has been a part of the Fortune Gate only for a decade. On top of that, when he first came to the Fortune Gate ten years ago, he was merely a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm and hadn’t even breakthrough to Ancient God Realm.” A Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple added with a complicated expression.

“What? He broke through several cultivation orders from peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm in ten years? This is a joke, right? That’s impossible!”

“That’s right, absolutely impossible!”

Quite a few of Golden Phoenix Pavilion disciples were shaking their heads with disbelief on their faces.

Li Ting smiled demurely as she spoke her opinion, “I think all these rumors are fabricated by the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, I don’t believe that Huang Xiaolong’s talent is so high.”

Li Zhi nodded in agreement, “Huang Xiaolong’s godhead is merely a high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead, with the rank of five hundred and forty-eight. Even though he could be considered talented, it is impossible for me to believe that he has broken through to late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm from peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm in just ten years, and it’s even more impossible that he was able to find the grandmist aura!”

Whereas Li Zhi had a top emperor rank Hundred Bones Godhead, ranked one hundred and sixty-one. Not to mention, he had been cultivating for three hundred years, but was only a Seventh Order Ancient God Realm at this point.

Even if the grandmist aura really offered unbelievable wonders, Li Zhi didn’t believe that it could help Huang Xiaolong breakthrough so many cultivation orders in a short span of ten years.

Wang Yu stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, his gaze grew increasingly cold and sullen.

No matter what, Huang Xiaolong must die.

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, Wang Yu estimated that Huang Xiaolong could probably breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm in a few hundred years, and that would make it difficult for him to kill Huang Xiaolong then. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What’s wrong? There is hatred between you and Huang Xiaolong?” Li Zhi asked Wang Yu when he sensed the killing intent coming from him.

Wang Yu explained, “In the lower realm, Huang Xiaolong and I were mortal enemies!” Wang Yu conveniently omitted telling them the part where he had been able to escape the Divine World only because of Huang Xiaolong.

The rest of the group couldn’t believe their ears.

“It would be troublesome to kill Huang Xiaolong in the Sea God City.” Li Zhi’s eyes glimmered as he weighed the possibility, and went on slowly, “Moreover his Masters, Golden Brow and Blood Knife are also present here. According to the Pavilion Head, Golden Brow’s strength is unfathomable!”

“We cannot kill him, but we can definitely humiliate him.” Li Ting stated gloomily.

Wang Yu nodded in agreement as his eyes locked onto Huang Xiaolong in the distance. His mouth arched into a sinister smile as he strode towards him. The Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s high-level Ancient God Realm disciples followed behind him. Li Zhi, Li Ting, and other Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciples also strode towards Huang Xiaolong.

In the distance, Huang Xiaolong was selecting some spiritual items harvested from the sea at a stall located on the street.

Huang Xiaolong sneered as he sensed Wang Yu’s group walking towards him. In truth he had noticed Wang Yu and Li Zhi long back.

When the little cow sensed Wang Yu’s group coming towards them, she smiled, revealing sparkling white teeth.

Soon, Wang Yu’s group was surrounding Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

Huang Xiaolong still continued to select items from the stall, despite the intruders standing right behind him. A cold light gleamed in Wang Yu’s eyes, as he felt ignored, and he barked: “Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder. When he saw Wang Yu, he blurted out, “You—Wang Yu!” There was just the right amount of shock on his face.

Wang Yu chuckled at Huang Xiaolong’s ‘shocked’ expression. “Huang Xiaolong, it is unexpected that you’ve already ascended to the Divine World, and even became a disciple of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate. I have also heard that the Vientiane World’s genius Wangu Ziyi from the Wangu Clan is no match against you. You really surprise me."

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over the people at Wang Yu’s side, including Li Zhi. He then spoke coldly, "Wang Yu, did you run all the way to the Divine World because you were scared that I’d come looking for you? And these people, are they your friends?"

Wang Yu was outraged and embarrassed because Huang Xiaolong just exposed the fact that he had fled to the Divine World in the past to avoid him. Killing intent flickered in his eyes.

“Bullsh*t! In the lower realm, I was the Fortune Gate’s Chief, and one of the top masters of a galaxy. How could I flee to the Divine World because of an insignificant and unknown character like you?” Wang Yu snapped. “What a joke, this sounds ridiculous to the extreme!”

But, Wang Yu’s reaction was too dramatic, which roused others’ suspicions.

"You are Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s Huang Xiaolong?" At this time, Li Zhi asked. His tone was haughty and condescending.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Li Zhu from head to toe, then asked loudly, "Are you Wang Yu’s follower or slave?"

Follower? Slave?

Both Golden Phoenix Pavilion and Black Region World’s Fortune Gate’s disciples were stupefied for a moment, but as they recovered their anger soared.

"Damn punk, what did you say just now?!"

"He is our Golden Phoenix Pavilion Senior Brother Li Zhi! Our Senior Brother Li Zhi is our Golden Phoenix Pavilion number one genius with the Hundred Bones Godhead!"

Li Zhi’s face was darker than muddy water as he glared at Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t tell his relationship with Wang Yu. He was obviously mocking them. Did this mean that he was looking for a fight?

They had come over to find trouble with Huang Xiaolong, but who would’ve thought that Huang Xiaolong would manage to provoked them first.

"Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s number one disciple? Wangu Ziyi also used to claim that he was Wangu Clan’s number one genius." Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

The two sects’ disciples faces turned even uglier.

Wangu Ziyi was one of the geniuses defeated by Huang Xiaolong. Now, Huang Xiaolong was actually comparing Li Zhu with Wangu Ziyi?

"Punk, you’re seeking death!" A peak late-Eighth Order Ancient God Realm Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple shouted angrily, and he swung his fists at Huang Xiaolong without a warning.

In an instant, surging fist force rushed towards Huang Xiaolong like a golden-ember fire tornado.

One could faintly hear the cry of an ancient phoenix from the golden-ember fire tornado.

Li Zhi watched with frosty eyes. He wanted to see if Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique was as strong as the rumors claimed to be.

Under the crowd’s attention, Huang Xiaolong merely raised his arm, and seemingly did not even use a strand of godforce. His arm penetrated through the swirling golden-ember fire, and he extended his palm to grip the Golden Phoenix Pavilion disciple’s head.

Everyone watched this scene dumbfoundedly.

The face of the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s disciple turned red from shame and fury. He circulated his godhead’s godforce to the limit as he attempted to break free from Huang Xiaolong’s grip. However, his efforts were futile.
