Di Fei collected everyone’s registration token, and upon checking, he immediately noticed that both Huang Xiaolong and Hu Qi were ranked in the top one hundred in the preliminary round. Di Fei’s brows wrinkled and he looked over at the main stage, but he didn’t say anything in the end.

He went on, taking out a crystal box and had the ten disciples draw a lot to determine their opponents.

On the crystal box’s surface was a formation that prevented divine sense from checking the contents.

Huang Xiaolong and other nine participants stepped up to draw a lot one by one. Huang Xiaolong drew a three, indicating he was in the third match to fight, and the other ‘three’ went to a Spirit Lake Cult disciple named Liu Yu.

When Liu Yu found out he was in the third match, same as Huang Xiaolong, his face became slightly ashen. He already heard that Huang Xiaolong sent Xiong Dong flying with a slap during the stage battle yesterday. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Although his strength was also at early First Order Ancient God Realm, in the preliminary round he was ranked in the one-hundred and twenties, slightly weaker than Xiong Dong.

The first to fight was Dragon Origin Sect’s Hu Qi. His opponent was a disciple from a sect called Primate Cult, whose strength was at late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Participants who were in the top one thousand had both talent and strength, but even so, this Primate Cult disciple was an ant compared to Hu Qi. With Hu Qi’s late-First Order Ancient God Realm cultivation, there was not a chance in the world this person could win.

On the battle stage, the Primate Cult disciple strongly suppressed the trepidation in his heart, cupped his fists and greeted Hu Qi, “Senior Brother Hu Qi, please enlighten me.”

A smile appeared on Hu Qi’s face, his sharp teeth reflecting a palpitating glint. In the next second, he disappeared into a blur, then the Primate Cult disciple was sent flying off the stage with a loud cry, crashing onto the ground.

On the ground, the Primate Cult disciple was twitching uncontrollably, his chest sunk in. From the looks of it, all of his ribs were broken.

Seeing this result, several other participants on stage fifty-two, sucked in a breath of cold air, apprehension shrouding their faces.

Hu Qi turned around and looked at Huang Xiaolong with a smile that fully showed his sharp teeth.

Hu Qi had an average height, looking harmless when he smiled. If it wasn’t for what happened just now, no one could tell that Hu Qi was actually a ruthless person.

Facing Hu Qi’s provocative look, Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent.

Rules for the second day stage battle were extremely simple, participants were not allowed to kill on stage. Regardless of the heavy injuries, it was fine as long as the opponent was still alive. Participants can admit defeat, but at times when the gap in strength was too high, they wouldn’t even have the time to admit defeat. One example was that Primate Cult disciple.

Next, the two disciples for the second match went onto the stage. These two disciples seemed equal in strength, both at peak mid-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm. Their battle was intense and no one could guess who the winner would be.

After an hour of fierce battle, one of the participants won and ended the match.

As the third match began, Huang Xiaolong and the Spirit Lake Cult disciple leaped onto the battle stage.

On the stage, Liu Yu observed Huang Xiaolong opposite him. There was obvious hesitation in his expression, knowing that he couldn’t win against Huang Xiaolong, but he was extremely unwilling to give up at this point.

“This one is Spirit Lake Cult’s Liu Yu, please enlighten me!” Liu Yu gritted his teeth and said Huang Xiaolong, finding his determination.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He had killed nine of Spirit Lake Cult participants, including their number genius Chen Weiping, creating a blood feud between them unknown to others. But this Liu Yu, despite knowing he was weaker than the opponent, firmly rose to the challenge. In Huang Xiaolong’s opinion, Liu Yu’s heart towards the dao wasn’t bad.

Therefore, he did not make things difficult for Liu Yu, merely sending him out from the stage area with a palm strike.

The fourth match ended, then the fifth match, soon the first round of matches ended. The remaining five participants continued to draw lots. This time, Huang Xiaolong drew a ‘one’ and his opponent was Dragon Origin Sect’s Hu Qi!

Fortune Gate disciple Di Fei took a glance at Huang Xiaolong and Hu Qi before his voice rang from the stage, “Barbarian God Sect Huang Xiaolong battling Dragon Origin Sect’s Hu Qi, please come to the stage.”

Almost simultaneously, Huang Xiaolong and Hu Qi both leaped onto the stage.

Hu Qi broke into a smile that showed his teeth, teasing, “Your speed is not slow ah.”

“Your speed is not fast.” Huang Xiaolong calmly retorted.

Hu Qi was stunned for a moment, grinning as he said, “You bet three hundred billion that our Senior Brother Zhou Xu won’t win first place, so I’m morbidly curious who you think is stronger than our Senior Brother Zhou Xu. Is it Luo Yunjie? Or is it Tan Lin will win first place?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head as he replied, “It definitely won’t be you.”

Hu Qi chuckled, the glint from his teeth looked even more menacing. “That I know, but it won’t be you either! In a short while, you’ll be miserably beaten by me!” With that said, a bright gold metallic light flickered and Hu Qi’s skin seemed to be painted with a layer of golden liquid. On top of that, his body doubled in size.

Following that, bestial patterns appeared on his face and body. Hu Qi’s eyes turned scarlet at this moment, and his sharp teeth grew long, passing his lips, resembling cold, sharp daggers. Even his hair changed, becoming pointed and spiky; from afar, Hu Qi looked like an ancient fierce beast reborn.

“Golden Copper Beast Physique.” Huang Xiaolong lightly named out Hu Qi’s unique physique.

The Golden Copper Beast Physique, one of the three thousand unique physiques; it had passable strength, ranked below one hundred. Even though there were numerous geniuses in the vast Divine World, people who possessed unique physiques were considered rare.

Di Fei and the other three participants below the stage were shocked, none of them imagined that Hu Qi was someone with the Golden Copper Beast Physique, and there were no rumors about it. This Hu Qi has hid too deeply.

Hu Qi licked his lips and smiled at Huang Xiaolong, “Correct, Golden Copper Beast Physique. In front of others, I very rarely show my Golden Copper Beast Physique, and even amongst our Dragon Origin Sect brothers, only a few know about this. You should feel honored being able to see it!”

Although Hu Qi was smiling, his beastly appearance made him look menacing and sinister.

Due to Huang Xiaolong and Hu Qi’s presence on stage fifty-two, a large number of spectators outside the square were watching that stage.

In the distance out of the square area, the Twin Cities Sect Chief Zhou Xuantong, as well as the many experts behind him, were also watching the battle on stage fifty-two.

“Truly unexpected ah, the Dragon Origin Sect’s Hu Qi actually possesses the Golden Copper Beast Physique! That means that his strength isn’t any weaker than our Yang Liming!” A Twin Cities Sect expert sighed.

“Sect Chief, based on Hu Qi’s strength, that Huang Xiaolong is sure to be defeated, right?” A Twin Cities Sect Grand Elder inquired.

Zhou Xuantong solemnly said, “Hu Qi should be a little bit stronger than Huang Xiaolong, but in order to win, there will be a bitter battle.”

All present Twin Cities Sect experts were astonished by Zhou Xuantong’s reply, Hu Qi whose cultivation was at late-First Order Ancient God Realm, possessing the Golden Copper Beast Physique actually needed to fight through a bitter battle to win against a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm?

This...! The Twin Cities Sect’s experts were bemused, Huang Xiaolong’s strength was really as high as their Sect Chief said?

Right at this time on the stage, Hu Qi flew into the air, bellowing as his fists punched at Huang Xiaolong.

As his fists moved through space, ear-splitting blasts rang out, exuding a faint dragon qi.

“That is the Dragon Origin Sect’s Earth Dragon Divine Art! Hu Qi can already condense dragon qi! Adding on his Golden Copper Beast Physique, he should have no rival in the same cultivation realm!”

As everyone was exclaiming in amazement, Hu Qi’s fists were a few meters away from Huang Xiaolong.
