After Chen Xiong finished saying what he wanted, he turned around and headed to the exit. In his opinion, since the punk already knew who he was, he definitely wouldn’t have the guts to defy him.

Precisely at this point, Huang Xiaolong’s snicker sounded, “Idiot.”

Chen Xiong and his group halted their steps. Chen Xiong himself was stupefied for a few seconds before turning around to face Huang Xiaolong again with his companions, looking like they couldn’t believe what they had just heard.

Chen Xiong’s face turned grim, his voice several degrees colder, “Punk, what did you say? I dare you to repeat it.”

The rest of Chen Xiong’s group was also looking at Huang Xiaolong with malice. The sudden tension in the air made Zhu Wanchen’s heart secretly leap with joy.

“You didn’t hear me clear enough just now?” Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as he continued, “I called you an idiot. If you still can’t hear it, I can repeat it one more time.”

Idiot!

Chen Xiong looked like he had swallowed a fly, a sharp gleam filled with killing intent shone from his eyes.

“You have guts. You think I won’t dare to hit you because we’re in the library?” Chen Xiong’s fists clenched and his momentum shot up as a fiery light enveloped his body: “Then I’ll just cripple you right now!”

Just as Chen Xiong was about to attack Huang Xiaolong, one of the inner disciples hastened to pull him back, “Young master Chen, wait—!” Quickly adding, “If we fight in the library and destroy the cultivation and battle art manuals here, even Eldest Senior Brother Chen Hao would have a hard time bailing us out of trouble.”

Chen Xiong frowned, but he stopped trying to attack Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s true, Young master Chen. Regardless, that punk won’t be able to run anyway, he has to come out from the library sooner or later.” Another inner disciple persuaded.

Chen Xiong glared coldly at Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, I’ll let you jump around for a few more hours.” Throwing that sentence, he led Zhu Wanchen and the others out of the library.

In fact, he wasn’t really going to attack Huang Xiaolong in the library just now, he knew how grave the crime of destroying the manuals was. He was just putting up an act so he didn’t look so bad.

The fact that the punk dared to offend Zhu Wanchen already showed that his identity wasn’t so simple either. Initially, he simply wanted to beat Huang Xiaolong around on behalf of Zhu Wanchen, but now, regardless who he might be, he was determined to stomp Huang Xiaolong down.

In any case, his big brother was there to protect him. Even if the higher echelon levied any punishment, it was just for show, they dared not really do anything to him.

Watching Chen Xiong’s group leave, Huang Xiaolong sneered. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Chen Hao’s younger brother?

Although he would rather not get into a conflict with Chen Hao at this point in time, it didn’t mean he was afraid of that Chen Hao. Not to mention enduring while others insulted and humiliated him had never been Huang Xiaolong’s personality.

Zhu Wanchen’s purpose was extremely simple as well, Huang Xiaolong saw through it at a glance. It was nothing more than wanting to borrow Chen Xiong and Chen Hao’s power to deal with him.

A light flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes before disappearing.

Regaining his mood, Huang Xiaolong reached the bookshelf for alchemy refining manuals and started flipping through them.

Time passed, and soon the first hour ended.

Chen Xiong and the others waiting outside grew gloomy when Huang Xiaolong hadn’t come out even after an hour.

How many years had it been since any inner disciple dared to ignore him this way?

Two hours passed and there was still no sign of Huang Xiaolong coming out. Chen Xiong’s killing intent was already boiling.

Three hours passed, then four hours.

The sun was now right above their heads, and the harsh sunlight was becoming more and more poisonous.

Looking at the sun above them, Chen Xiong felt his killing intent boiling over. The other disciples with him were also showing vicious expressions.

Zhu Wanchen lowered his flickering eyes, no one knew what he was thinking about.

Soon, nine hours had passed, with the sun setting on the horizon.

Raising his eyes at the setting sun, Chen Xiong’s killing intent could solidify the air at this point.

The group’s patience frayed further when, all of a sudden, a figure walked out from the library. A hint of viciousness flashed across Chen Xiong’s eyes. The person coming out was none other than Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Xiong sneered as he approached Huang Xiaolong’s figure.

The other inner disciples followed behind Chen Xiong, spreading out in a circle with Huang Xiaolong at the center.

“You finally came out.” Chen Xiong’s icy voice sounded, “Today, no one can save you! You naturally won’t die, but I’ll cripple you. The days are long, we can slowly play!”

Chen Xiong bellowed, rising to the sky like a flame, pouncing onto Huang Xiaolong. His fist swung forward at full strength, akin to a ferocious tiger descending down the mountain, unstoppable.

In midair, lethal tiger claws suddenly grew out from Chen Xiong’s palms, even his body became a size bigger while whiskers were growing out from his cheeks.

This was one of the Barbarian God Sect’s higher ranked battle art, aptly named Tiger King Art.

After cultivating this Tiger King Art, one’s defense, power, and speed would jump exponentially. At the same time, their physical appearance would slightly change, resembling a tiger.

Combining this Tiger King Art with Chen Xiong’s Third Order Heavenly God Realm strength, was enough to fight head-on with a peak early Third Order Heavenly God cultivator.

Watching Chen Xiong suddenly attack him out of nowhere, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t flustered at all. Seizing the right timing when Chen Xiong reached him, Huang Xiaolong raised his right hand and struck out with a fist of his own.

Zhu Wanchen was watching Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, but when he saw that Huang Xiaolong actually dared to go head-on with Chen Xiong’s fist, disdain filled his eyes. ‘This Huang Xiaolong is truly throwing himself at death. Does he really think his strength is comparable to an early Third Order Heavenly God?’

At the same time, he was celebrating with glee inwardly, he didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong would keep silent about who he was. Had he revealed his identity, Chen Xiong might let today’s matter off, but now...!

Zhu Wanchen could already see the scene where Huang Xiaolong was sent flying.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong and Chen Xiong’s fists collided, resulting in a thunderous boom.

Just as Zhu Wanchen and the others thought that Huang Xiaolong would be knocked back, Chen Xiong shot into the air then fell to the ground several hundred meters away, but it didn’t stop there. Chen Xiong’s body rolled on the ground until he hit a large boulder before coming to a stop. During this time, he had already fainted into oblivion.

Zhu Wanchen and the rest stood rooted on the spot.

Chen Xiong actually....!

‘Impossible! Absolutely impossible!’ Zhu Wanchen adamantly shook his head.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even spare a glance at Chen Xiong as he approached Zhu Wanchen.

Detecting the approaching Huang Xiaolong, Zhu Wanchen finally felt fear, his feet shuffled backward, stammering, “Huang, Huang Xiaolong, wh-what you want?”

“What? Huang Xiaolong?! He’s that Huang Xiaolong!” The disciples around Zhu Wanchen were startled hearing that this person was Huang Xiaolong. They were startled at his identity, startled by his strength!

Huang Xiaolong watched the terrified expression on Zhu Wanchen’s face, “You’ll know very soon what I want to do.” One of his palms reached out, pulling Zhu Wanchen right up to him. Then, with both palms holding Zhu Wanchen’s arms, he made a full twist.

Blood-curdling screams reverberated close to the library entrance.

Next, Huang Xiaolong landed a kick on Zhu Wanchen’s stomach and the latter flew into the air. The others were already deathly pale by now; they were about to run for it when a punch knocked them into the air.

In the distance, the inner disciples who came running over after hearing the commotion retraced their steps in fear.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept over the surroundings before walking away.

Of course, there were a few Sky Dragon League members amongst those who came after hearing the commotion, but no one dared to stop Huang Xiaolong.

Half an hour later, in the depths of the Blood Phoenix Forest, a young man clad in a dark blue robe gave a mid-Eighth Order Heavenly God Realm demonic beast the killing blow, then abruptly stopped, taking out a communication talisman. After he finished reading the contents, anger exploded in his eyes, “Huang Xiaolong, you dare injure my little brother! Courting death!”

This young man was none other than the Barbarian God Sect’s chief disciple, Chen Hao!
