Chapter 3224: Grand Perfection Level

Every single small world had its limits. It couldn’t produce grand cosmos energy infinitely, and if they were to measure it in terms of numbers, an expert who hadn’t reached the God of Creation Realm would be able to use 1.2999999 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

A single unit was all it took to bring them to the God of Creation Realm.

As long as they reached 1.3 billion units of energy, they would undergo a complete transformation to become a true God of Creation!

For cultivators at the level of Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao, they would probably possess several million units of grand cosmos energy.

In the following days, Huang Xiaolong started to use both secret arts at the same time as he continued to cultivate.

He didn’t forget to look into the four Origin Divine Fires in his body and year after year passed.

The power of the thirteen elements he comprehended became stronger and stronger, but a piece of news rocked the Blazing Dragon World when he was stuck in seclusion.

“Huang Shengdao, the Son of Creation of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, obtained the Dao Emperor’s Sword! He managed to obtain the Dao Emperor’s Treasury and inheritance!”

The news caused the entire universe to shake.

The Dao Emperor might not rank among the ten strongest Gods of Creation, but he was nevertheless one of them. The Dao Emperor's Sword was ranked firmly in the mid tier of the creation artifacts in the universe.

As the old dragon was afraid the news would affect Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation, he didn’t bring the matter up.

Year after year, Huang Xiaolong strengthened himself by devouring the universe origin energy around him.

As the universe origin energy poured into the space and into Huang Xiaolong’s body, the world origin of the Blazing Dragon World didn’t do a thing to stop it! Every single bit of the universe origin energy was devoured by Huang Xiaolong!

If Fu Luosen or Huang Shengdao was trying to do the same, the Blazing Dragon World Origin would definitely absorb the universe origin energy while it tried to enter. By the time it entered their bodies, only a tenth of it left would remain.

As for anyone else with bloodlines a little lacking compared to the two of them, they would be lucky if they could absorb a tenth of the universe origin energy left in the space around them.

Due to the Blazing Dragon World being the oldest world in the universe, the effects of devouring universe origin energy was much better than the other worlds.

For example, even if Huang Shengdao received the inheritance of the Dao Emperor, his benefits of cultivating in the Dao Emperor World wouldn’t even come close to Huang Xiaolong’s gains. At the very best, he would cultivate half as quickly.

There was also a need to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong’s bloodline was much better than Huang Shengdao. With two small worlds spinning inside him to utilize two secret arts at once, Huang Xiaolong’s speed of cultivation was unmatched!

In the blink of an eye, eight hundred thousand years passed.

There was only a thousand years left till the opening of the World of Departed Souls, and Huang Xiaolong eventually emerged from his cultivation.

When the old dragon visited Huang Xiaolong, his eyes widened in shock as his jaws nearly dropped to the ground. “You… You… You reached the grand perfection level!”

Even though reaching the grand perfection level was a matter of time, Huang Xiaolong’s speed refreshed the old dragon’s world view.

In the past, the old dragon took more than thirty million years in order to reach the grand perfection level when he comprehended all thirteen elements to the perfection level!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh happily when he saw the old dragon’s reaction. “It was a little quicker than expected because of the two creation level secret arts.”

In fact, Huang Xiaolong reached the grand perfection level three hundred thousand years ago!

When the old dragon heard what Huang Xiaolong said, an inexplicable urge to beat him up emerged in his heart.

“Brat, do you hear what you’re saying?! I took over thirty million years to do what you just did! Are you implying that I’m stupid fool?!”

As the oldest God of Creation in the universe, the Blazing Dragon had exceptional talent. As such, his speed of cultivation couldn’t be considered too slow. Even geniuses like Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao took more than forty million years to achieve the same feat.

“How many units of grand cosmos energy do you have right now?” The old dragon finally calmed himself down and he asked. “Have you broken through the million unit mark?”

In the past, he took nearly ten million years to gain a million units of grand cosmos energy. He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong could achieve so much in such a short amount of time.

Hesitating for a moment, Huang Xiaolong looked at the old dragon with a weird gaze. “Do you want me to be honest?”

“No sh*t!”

Could it be?!

“Several days ago, I reached more than thirty million units of grand cosmos energy.” Huang Xiaolong realized that there was no point in lying to his master.

“WHAT?!”

“Thirty million?!” The old dragon nearly face-planted into the ground.

“You…”

He stared at Huang Xiaolong like he was looking at a monster.

“How the f*ck did you reach thirty million units of grand cosmos energy?!” The old dragon yelled in disbelief.

“Both the first and second worlds in my body accumulated around sixteen million units.” If he were to add them up, there would be more than thirty million units of grand cosmos energy!

What the f….

The old dragon stared at him quietly.

“It’s a shame. If I had the Pangu World Creation Art, I would have reached over forty eight million units.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

The urge to beat Huang Xiaolong’s face in grew ever so strong in the old dragon’s heart.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t mean it any other way. If he had the Pangu World Creation Art, he would definitely be much stronger than he was!

As such, the desire to obtain the Pangu Axe solidified in his heart.

Soon after, the old dragon personally checked out the grand cosmos energy Huang Xiaolong had. He was shocked once again when he realized that the kid was speaking the truth.

At the same time, he thought of a terrifying possibility. Any cultivator at the perfection stage would only be able to wield 1.2999999 billion units of grand cosmos energy. With Huang Xiaolong’s three small worlds, he would be able to use more than 3.9 billion units!

Wouldn’t that make him stronger than an ordinary God of Creation?!

Holy sh*t!

What the f…

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about Huang Shengdao and he obtained the bad news. “Huang Shengdao obtained the Dao Emperor’s Sword. In the past million years, he also improved by quite a lot.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I was afraid that his abrupt rise would affect you when the World of Departed Souls opened. Seems like I have nothing else to worry about now.” The old dragon chuckled.
