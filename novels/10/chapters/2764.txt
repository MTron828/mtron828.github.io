Chapter 2765: Wait!

It is your Spirit Devil Alliance that will join our Cangqiong Alliance?!

As for you, you can be my subordinate’s minion!

The Spirit Devil Patriarch looked at Huang Xiaolong with a dazed expression, while the Floating Petals Patriarch and other patriarchs were dumbfounded.

“What did you say?!” A brutal gleam flashed across the Spirit Devil Patriarch’s eyes as devil qi emerged from his body, and it locked on to Huang Xiaolong. The surrounding temperature plummeted in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed, “I said you’re only qualified to be a dog by my side!”

A dog!

The Spirit Devil Patriarch threw his head back and laughed hysterically, and just as abruptly, his fist swung at Huang Xiaolong with anger, “Little beast, die for me!”

The killing intent from the Spirit Devil Patriarch gripped the hearts of other sacred lands’ patriarchs, and even the Floating Petals Patriarch had never seen the Spirit Devil Patriarch show such a murderous side.

Then again, it wasn’t strange. Had a mere True Saint brat scold him so, he too would have wanted to kill people.

Boom!

The Spirit Devil Patriarch’s powerful fist force caused space to shake, and the sudden burst of power startled a lot of Spirit Devil Alliance’s experts hidden at various spots of residence, causing them to crouch down in fear.

The Spirit Devil Patriarch’s fist force arrived before Huang Xiaolong in a split second, and it even enveloped Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, and Chen Qi.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong raised his fist and punched forward with an indifferent expression.

BANG!

Before the Floating Petals Patriarch and other patriarchs could react, two opposing forces collide, akin to two ancient divine mountains smashing into one another. A deafening blast resounded through the residence, and the hall itself was reduced to rubbles.

Turbulent after shockwaves raged rampantly in the four directions, sweeping the Spirit Devil Alliance’s hiding experts into the air.

The Spirit Devil Patriarch himself, including the chair under him, were flipped into the air, tumbling like a wheel, one round, two rounds, three rounds… Everything in his path was shattered into pieces as he tumbled to the yard outside.

The other twenty-one patriarchs, including the Floating Petals Patriarch, were sent reeling back quite a distance by the destructive force.

And this destructive force continued to rage across the residence as if it would never stop.

Blinding rays of light shot out from the residence.

When the Floating Petals Patriarch and the rest of twenty-one patriarchs regained their balance, every one of them was dumbfounded by the ruins around them as they looked around, and finally stopping their gaze on Huang Xiaolong. They were utterly stupefied.

Some distance away, inside the Ice Lion City’s City Mayor Mansion, Zhang Pei smiled jubilantly when he sensed the powerful shockwaves coming from a certain direction, and he muttered under his breath, “Looks like Mo Ling and the others have started!”

An Ice Lion Sacred Land’s expert asked, “Lord Zhang Pei, Cangqiong Alliance is a big piece of meat. Isn’t it too little for us to only take sixty percent of the harvest?”

Another Ice Lion Sacred Land’s Primal Ancestor agreed, “I agree to that. In my opinion, we could take down the Cangqiong Alliance ourselves, and enjoy all the benefits. Why do we need to split forty percent with the Spirit Devil Alliance? The Spirit Devil Patriarch won’t dare to say anything even if we swallow up the entire Cangqiong Alliance.”

Zhang Pei chuckled and said, “You don’t understand.”

If he were to personally deal with Cangqiong Alliance, he would have to hand over half of the benefits to Ice Lion Sacred Land. On the other hand, if he cooperated with the Spirit Devil Alliance, they would give him sixty percent of Cangqiong Alliance’s treasury, without him needing to hand anything to Ice Lion Sacred Land.

Moreover, after the Spirit Devil Alliance annexed the Cangqiong Alliance, he would still get benefits from the Spirit Devil Alliance every year for many years.

This was the reason why Zhang Pei said that the other two didn't understand.

“Lord Zhang Pei, should we go take a look?”

“There’s no need. We can go over after the Spirit Devil Alliance resolves Cangqiong Old Man and his group. Dealing with Cangqiong Old Man’s group won’t be a problem based on the Spirit Devil Alliance’s overall strength.”

……

Huang Xiaolong stood up from his seat, and walked unhurriedly towards the Spirit Devil Patriarch as the Floating Petals Patriarch and the others stared at him vigilantly.

Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, Chen Qi, and Yang Shangchen also rose from their seats and followed behind Huang Xiaolong.

In the meantime, the Spirit Devil Patriarch had climbed up from the ground, and blood was flowing down his horrified face. He stared at Huang Xiaolong with shock and disbelief.

“Have you ever wondered why only the five of us came?” Huang Xiaolong’s placid voice drummed in the twenty-two sacred lands’ patriarchs’ ears.

A chill ran down their backs as a thought flashed across their minds simultaneously. Could it be?

“Because, we don’t need too many people to deal with you guys,” Huang Xiaolong went on icily, “I, alone, am enough.”

The Spirit Devil Patriarch, Floating Petals Patriarch, and the others’ faces turned ugly.

Some of the Spirit Devil Alliance’s experts could barely reign in their rage.

At this time, several dao souls appeared in the air beside Huang Xiaolong.

These dao souls’ appearance shocked the Spirit Devil Alliance’s experts.

“Tang Long!”

“Han Mo!”

That’s right, these dao souls were none other than Tang Long’s, Han Mo’s, and Chu Yifan’s dao souls.

“Weren’t you curious who was the person who captured Tang Long and the others?” Huang Xiaolong taunted.

“What?! Could it be…?” Genuine apprehension began to rear its head in the twenty-two patriarchs' hearts.

Huang Xiaolong ‘kindly’ explained, “The three patriarchs’ dao souls were imprisoned inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace ever since I destroyed their bodies, and they are experiencing torture worse than death everyday.”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t bluffing the Spirit Devil Alliance’s experts, as Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan’s dao souls truly spent miserable days inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Not only Tang Long’s, Han Mo’s, and Chu Yifan’s dao souls felt like this, but all the Primal Ancestors’ dao souls that were imprisoned inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace felt that death was better than experiencing daily torture.

“You’re lying! Everyone, don't believe his nonsense! He’s merely a Ninth Heaven True Saint, so how could he have captured Tang Long and the others!” The Floating Petals Patriarch yelled loudly, “Everyone attack together, kill them all!”

Despite the Floating Petals Patriarch’s echoing shouts, encouraging his companions to kill Huang Xiaolong’s group, none of the Spirit Devil Alliance’s experts made a move. Even the Spirit Devil Patriarch himself was sent reeling back from Huang Xiaolong’s punch, then what were they compared to him?

A Ninth Heaven True Saint?

Just as the Floating Petals Patriarch’s voice fell, the Tang Dragon Knife appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, slashing down decisively.

“Look out!” The Spirit Devil Patriarch’s face tightened as he cried out a warning.

His warning came a second too late as a ray of light cut vertically in midair, and the Floating Petals Patriarch was split into two halves.

Huang Xiaolong grabbed the Floating Petals Patriarch’s dao soul and threw it into the Cangqiong Dao Palace without a word.

Everything happened in a split second and by the time the Spirit Devil Patriarch and the others reacted, horror was etched on their faces. All of them stepped back, afraid that they would become the next target of Huang Xiaolong’s Tang Dragon Knife. No one dared to attack Huang Xiaolong, much less avenge the Floating Petals Patriarch.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over the Spirit Devil Alliance members. As he had guessed, the Spirit Devil Alliance’s members weren’t very united.

“Spirit Devil Patriarch, it’s your turn now!” Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell on the Spirit Devil Patriarch as the Tang Dragon Knife in his hand hummed an endless dragon’s roar.

If the Spirit Devil Patriarch had been a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, it would have been difficult for Huang Xiaolong to defeat him, but the Spirit Devil Patriarch was merely a peak mid-Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor instead of Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor as the people outside believed.

“Wait!” Just as Huang Xiaolong wanted to attack, the Spirit Devil Patriarch shouted anxiously.
