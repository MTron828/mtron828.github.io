Chapter 3742: Do You Know Who You Are Talking To?

More experts arrived at the Big River Mountain as time passed, and amongst them weren’t any hegemons with less resounding reputations.

“Old Granny Void!”

The crowd stirred when an abrupt cry rang in the air as an old woman with a head of gray-silver hair approached from the distant sky, holding a cane with a dragon head carving as the grip. She was born with a pair of clear-cut phoenix eyes, and despite her gray-silver hair, her complexion was ruddy, and she didn’t look older than a middle-aged woman in her fifties, exuding an indescribable allure and charm.

Old Granny Void was not a native of Nine Cauldron Land. She was an expert of twenty-billion mark from the neighboring land. Even though her reputation was not as loud as the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, she was capable of holding her own, and she was a supreme existence who could deter many other similar experts in this region.

In the Unknown Space, the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, Zhu Chen, and Jian Wushuang were the only six experts who had broken the twenty billionth mark. However, there were certainly more such experts in the Origin Universe.

Though they were not as many as the white cabbages sold on the streets, there were at least two such experts on each land.

Old Granny Void’s arrival seemed to dampen the atmosphere slightly.

“Even an expert like Old Granny Void has come, so we definitely have no hope of getting the Nine Cauldrons.”

“I’ve heard even Senior Heaven Sage Human Emperor would come in person!”

“What?! Senior Heaven Sage Human Emperor?!!”

“That’s right, Senior Heaven Sage Human Emperor is obsessed with refining pills, and he has been searching for a suitable divine cauldron. Now that the Nine Cauldrons is about to appear, isn’t it natural that he is tempted? He sent Saint Heaven Palace’s experts to inquire about the Nine Cauldrons’ appearance a few months back.”

Hearing that the Heaven Sage Human Emperor might appear in person, families’ patriarchs grasping on a stroke of luck nipped their thoughts in the buds.

Although there was a saying that a peerless treasure like the Nine Cauldrons would choose the fated person, this kind of saying, fate or even luck were irrelevant before a supreme expert like the Heaven Sage Human.

Who had the guts to compete for the Nine Cauldrons against an expert like the Heaven Sage Human Emperor? Wasn’t that the same as banging one’s head at the door with a fervor, looking to die?

While experts in the crowd talked in hushed whispers, a powerful momentum approached from the horizon, and this powerful momentum swept through the land.

A middle-aged man of burly build and imposing aura, carrying a big blade, arrived with the wind howling behind him.

Everyone froze when this person appeared, even Old Granny Void’s nonchalant expression stiffened slightly.

“Domineering Blade Xihu!”

The Domineering Blade Xihu was another twenty billion mark expert. In fact, he had reached the twenty-one billion mark, which was above Old Granny Void.

It was not strange that Old Granny Void didn’t appreciate Domineering Blade Xihu appearing in this place at this time.

Huang Xiaolong watched as he waited calmly.

As time passed, three more experts of the twenty-billion mark appeared.

One of them, the Supreme Golden Devourer, had also reached the twenty-one billion mark.

Until now, five experts with twenty billion mark and above had arrived, keeping the ancient races’ experts and families’ patriarchs at the ten billion mark fidgeting on their toes. The initially rowdy crowd had quieted down considerably.

Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and Supreme Golden Devourer’s group of three stood high in the air above the Big River Mountain’s winding river, staring fixedly at the river.

The auspicious rays shining out from the riverbed had grown stronger and brighter, as if signaling that the Nine Cauldrons was very close to emerging. It wouldn't take more than ten minutes.

Experts waiting on the surrounding mountain peaks looked on with feverish gazes, but none of them dared to move closer because of the five experts in the air, and all they could do was watch from afar.

Huang Xiaolong too was watching from a distance away.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Looking at the increasingly strong rays of light from the river, Huang Xiaolong frowned. The Heaven Sage Human Emperor isn’t coming?

The Nine Cauldrons was that close to surfacing, and if the Heaven Sage Human Emperor wanted this cauldron, he should have arrived by now.

Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls’ senses spread, but he still did not detect the Heaven Sage Human Emperor’s aura.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to recover his dao souls’ power, he let out a low exclamation of surprise. He looked towards the horizon and saw a majestic palace flying in the Big River Mountain’s direction.

This palace was more than enormous and obnoxiously enormous. Precious materials were inlaid on the roofs and walls of the palace, exceeding thousands in number, and they were glowing of prism colors. These precious materials were nothing in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, but to experts of twenty billion mark, any one of these items was a significant temptation.

The present Gods of Creation were stunned for a second, but the faces of several families’ ancestors changed greatly as they recognized the owner of the palace.

Even Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and Supreme Golden Devourer’s group of three looked unprecedentedly solemn.

“Treasure Saint Palace!”

Treasure Saint Palace!

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s palace!

There were numerous ancient races in the Origin Universe, and the human race was the biggest race. The human race had ten Human Emperors, and so far, they were entitled the human race’s ten most powerful experts.

The Heaven Sage Human Emperor that Huang Xiaolong was searching for was an expert breaking the twenty-seven billionth mark, but amongst the ten Human Emperors, he ranked at the bottom ten.

Whereas, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor ranked sixth among the ten Human Emperors!

He was an expert breaking the twenty-eight billionth mark. More accurately, it was the 28.2 billion mark.

Since the Treasure Saint Palace had arrived, inside had to be the Treasure Sage Human Emperor!

This explained the ugly expressions on Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and the others’ faces.

Although the five of them were experts of twenty-billion mark, it was the devastating truth that the five of them were only worth one palm strike from the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

The Treasure Saint Palace’s speed didn’t seem to be very fast, but before it arrived, a large part of the crowd of experts were kneeling on their knees in salute.

Even patriarchs with nineteen-billion mark were on their knees, only Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and the other three dared to remain standing at this point.

Even so, the five of them lowered their heads, bowing to show respect towards the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

Only Huang Xiaolong stood straight as if he didn’t notice the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s arrival.

Many noticed Huang Xiaolong and were flabbergasted.

The Treasure Sage Human Emperor was one of the human race’s top ten Human Emperors. He was the pillar of strength and belief of the human race. Some present families’ patriarchs and ancient races’ patriarchs were outraged that Huang Xiaolong didn’t salute to show proper respect for the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

Before anyone could utter a word, the crowd saw Huang Xiaolong take a step forward in the Treasure Saint Palace’s direction.

Everyone looked like the cat had got their tongues.

Old Granny Void and the others exchanged a baffled look, each thinking the same thing. Is this young man related to the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?

Huang Xiaolong arrived in front of the flying palace while everyone had still to react. As the Treasure Saint Palace looked like it was going to ram into Huang Xiaolong, an invisible power surged out from his body, directly stopping the Treasure Saint Palace in its tracks.

“Ei!” A low exclamation of surprise sounded from inside the Treasure Saint Palace.

Old Granny Void was genuinely shocked that Huang Xiaolong stopped the Treasure Saint Palace in its tracks.

“Young man, which family are you from?” From inside the Treasure Saint Palace, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s majestic voice sounded. The questioning and condescending manner in his tone was obvious to all.

Huang Xiaolong did not answer. Instead, he stated placidly, “The Heaven Sage Human Emperor must have known that you’re coming that he didn’t show up, but even though it’s you, the result will be the same.”

It was because the Treasure Sage Human Emperor too had entered the inner hall of the Devil Mirror Palace.

Listening to Huang Xiaolong’s words that made no sense in their ears, the crowd showed similar baffled expressions.

Huang Xiaolong continued, “My question to you is, what did you see after entering the Devil Mirror Palace? Describe to me in detail everything you saw inside the Devil Mirror Palace.”

Laughter came from inside the Treasure Saint Palace. “I am to describe everything to you in detail? Listening to your tone, it sounds like I have no choice but to do as you say. Young man, do you know who you’re talking to?”
