Chapter 3687 – Universe First Race

The circlet emitted warmth in his hands as it soothed his soul.

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong thought about all the universe treasures he gathered. There was the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, Three Gods Halberd, Reversal Sword, the four Universe Origin Fires, and the Golden Sun Circlet! He had six of them in total!

Legends had it that one would possess unimaginable power if they managed to gather all thirteen universe treasures!

Of course, that was nothing more than a rumor.

Still, Huang Xiaolong felt that he should at least try to gather all thirteen of them!

Even though no one had been able to gather all thirteen universe treasures since the ancient times, someone might be able to eventually!

Huang Xiaolong made Zhu Chen release his defenses before branding his soul.

Soon after, he asked Zhu Chen about the reason behind his entry to the Naihe Bridge.

“I received news that the Blood Axe might be located at the end of the Naihe Bridge. As such, I ventured onto the bridge. However, before I reached the end…” He paused after speaking up to that point.

Well, he was stopped by the five monster kings and his fate was clear for all to see.

“Oh? The blood axe is located at the end of the Naihe Bridge?!” Huang Xiaolong yelled in shock. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If he managed to obtain the axe, he would have seven universe treasures!

He would hold a majority of the treasures alone!

“Yes. I am more than eighty percent sure that the Blood Axe is here.” Zhu Chen nodded. “However, no one has been able to reach the end of the bridge!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the five monster kings.

The face of the Blood Tentacle Monster King turned serious and he muttered, “Not even we managed to reach the end of the bridge. That’s because the region at the end belongs to the Ghost Devil King!”

“Ghost Devil King?” Huang Xiaolong and Zhu Chen were taken aback.

That was the first time Zhu Chen was hearing the name,

The Golden Centipede King muttered, “The Ghost Devil King was born during the creation of the universe, just like us. No… He’s slightly older than us if we need to be specific. Moreover, he’s extremely mysterious and he never shows his face! He never leaves the Naihe Bridge and he’s stronger than all five of us!”

“All the evil ghosts in the Netherworld can be said to be his descendants!

The Yin Ant King continued, “Even the Green Ghost doesn’t know about his existence. We’re the only five who know about the Ghost Devil King.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned. “How strong is he exactly?”

The five monster kings looked at each other as a look of confusion appeared on their faces.

“We have no idea…” The Black Locust King shook his head and sighed, “We only exchanged blows with him once, and all five of us were defeated by him easily. I’m afraid that the power he has is much stronger than what you displayed earlier.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a cold breath.

How could he be so strong?!

Initially, Huang Xiaolong felt that the Ghost Devil King couldn’t be much stronger than himself. Who would have thought that he could defeat the five of them easily?

He only managed to suppress them with the help of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Three Gods Halberd, the Reversal Sword, and the four Universe Origin Fires.

Even though he was still hiding some trump cards by holding back his strength and the Universe Boat, that was close to all he had! With the Universe Boat, defeating the five would be easier, but it wouldn’t be effortless!

A light flashed in his eyes as he looked towards the end of the bridge.

“How far are we from the end?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“If you fly over with your fastest speed, you’ll need half a year to get there.” The Yin Ant King replied after thinking about it for a moment.

“What?!” Huang Xiaolong was appalled.

Zhu Chen was similarly stunned.

He thought that he was close to the end after running into the five monster kings, but he was wrong!

Half a year!

With Zhu Chen’s speed, he would be able to cross the entire region owned by the Green Ghost if he flew for half a year, much less Huang Xiaolong.

How could the Naihe Bridge be so damn long?!

“Lord, since we know that the Blood Axe is located at the end of the bridge, we can look for it next time.” The Blood Tentacle Monster King said.

He might not have said it, but his meaning was clear. Huang Xiaolong was no match for the Ghost Devil King.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the Blood Tentacle King from the corner of his eye and he eventually sighed, “Alright.”

He made several calculations before accepting the suggestion. Even if he used the Universe Boat and got the assistance of everyone present, he might be able to fight the Ghost Devil King to a draw. He might as well return to cutivate before coming back to suppress the Ghost Devil King after breaking through to the peak of the grand completion stage.

The moment he broke through, his strength would take a huge leap forward!

Of course, he didn’t leave the Naihe Bridge immediately. He planned to refine the Golden Sun Circlet before leaving.

The bridge might have been dangerous before he subdued the five kings, but now that things were different, there no longer existed anything that could threaten him!

Sitting down on the ground, he started to refine the treasure.

Zhu Chen and the five kings stood around him to defend the area.

With all of them around, not a single monster dared to approach.

Silence filed the land as he started to refine the treasure.

Countless years passed in a flash and Huang Xiaolong completed the refinement process.

However, he thought of something before leaving. He retrieved the golden cloth he obtained in the battle with the golden robed young man and he asked Zhu Chen, “I ran into a young man wearing golden robes earlier and we fought a little. This came from his clothes. Do you recognize it?”

“Golden robes?” Zhu Chen frowned. He started to examine the cloth in Huang Xiaolong’s hand and his expression changed drastically. “Could it be?!”

Huang Xiaolong felt that Zhu Chen had already guessed the man’s identity from his reaction.

“Who is that guy?”

“Lord, he… Did he use a giant golden cloth and huge golden cymbals?” Zhu Chen asked.

“Yes he did.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

“Then it has to be him! He’s the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race!”

“Universe First Race?!” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in confusion.

Like Huang Xiaolong, the five monster kings were equally as shocked.

“Yes. He’s the Golden Cymbals King from the Universe First Race!” Zhu Chen explained. “Since the start of time, the thirteen universes gave birth to a supreme race that existed before the creation of everything else! They are known as the Universe First Race. When the universe was destroyed previously, they were behind it all!”

Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. “What?!”

“Yes, they did it!” Zhu Chen continued, “There are thirteen kings in the Universe First Race. The Golden Cymbals King is ranked somewhere in the middle among them!”
