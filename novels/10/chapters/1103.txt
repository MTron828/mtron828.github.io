A storm of killing intent erupted from Ju Wufei’s body as he looked at the communication talisman.

“The Barbarian God Sect!” His low voice was bone-chillingly frigid, gnashing the words out one by one.

“Patriarch, you...?” One of the Giant Tribe Eminent Grand Elder couldn’t help asking when he noticed Ju Wufei’s sudden hostility.

Ju Wufei did not reply, passing the communication talisman in his hand to that Eminent Grand Elder.

In less than a second, the Eminent Grand Elder’s divine sense had already read through the message within and he too was filled with violent killing intent.

“This damn Barbarian God Sect! I’m going to kill all of them, annihilate this sect, slaughter all of their disciples!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s not enough to atone for their sins even if Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling die a million deaths!”

Angry voices echoed in the cave as the other Giant Tribe elders heard the news.

“But there’s something odd about this. Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling don’t have the guts to kill people of my Giant Tribe!” An Eminent Grand Elder stated with doubt.

“Even if Ju Meng wasn’t killed by them, they still died not long after leaving the Barbarian God Sect. They must take responsibility for this just the same! He had the guts to refuse our Giant Tribe. Refusing to hand Huang Xiaolong over to us is already a crime punishable with slaughter!” Ju Wufei stated coldly. “Three years later, after we break this cultivation dwelling’s formation, we’ll set off to the Barbarian God Sect!”

At this time, a black shadow flickered into the cave. This shadow was none other Chen Hao who returned after hunting some magic beasts in the vicinity.

Chen Hao was alarmed when he entered, sensing the violent killing intent from the people inside the cave, “Godfather, what happened with everyone?”

Ju Wufei flipped the communication talisman to Chen Hao saying, “The Barbarian God Sect refused to hand Huang Xiaolong over. On top of that, not long after leaving the Barbarian God Sect headquarters, Ju Meng’s group was killed!”

Chen Hao caught the communication talisman in his hand and was greatly shocked after sweeping over the message with his divine sense.

“Then, Godfather intends to...?” Chen Hao cautiously inquired.

“Three years later, after we’ve broken through this cultivation dwelling’s formation and obtained the treasures inside, we’ll set off to the Barbarian God Sect!” Ju Wufei announced with roiling killing intent.

“Yes, Godfather.” Chen Hao’s heart secretly throbbed with ecstasy at Ju Wufei’s words. He was looking forward to seeing how Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling were going to protect Huang Xiaolong at that time.

’Huang Xiaolong, your time is running out! You should treasure these remaining three years of your life. I’m going to kill you personally in front of the entire the Barbarian God Sect!!’

On the other side, inside Huang Xiaolong’s Celestial Immortal Manor.

There were several spatial rings hovering in front of him that once belonged to Ju Meng’s group. Huang Xiaolong checked the spatial rings one by one and wasn’t shocked at the piles of shenbi, herbs, and divine pellets that were as high as a mountain.

The total amount of shenbi he got from these spatial rings was well over six billion!

The medicinal herbs inside these spatial rings were, to his disappointment, merely ten-million-years-old and below. However, Huang Xiaolong was happy, for he found the remaining herbs he needed for the Reverse incarnation Pill.

He quickly transferred the dozen kinds of herbs into his Asura Ring for safekeeping.

The divine pellets were barely passable, mostly likely refined by Ju Meng’s group themselves, barely reaching grade three. A grade three divine pellet may be a precious item to others, but this grade of divine pills was rubbish in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

With the horrifying refining speed of his three supreme godheads, absorbing a million pills of this grade still wouldn’t bring his cultivation to Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm.

Another thing was, Ju Meng did not bring along that grade five spiritual vein that he promised Lu Zhuo. Currently, that grade five spiritual vein was sealed inside the Giant Island’s underground space. In fact, from the very beginning, the Giant Tribe had never planned to give a grade five spiritual vein to the Barbarian God Sect.

However, in Ju Meng’s memories, there was more than one of them in the Giant Island’s underground space!

There were three!

“Three!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in an excited whisper, a feverish glint in his eyes.

Three years later, after he annihilated the Giant Tribe, he mustn’t forget about those three grade five spiritual veins underground.

The subsequent two months were peaceful days with sunny skies.

Huang Xiaolong stayed inside his manor to cultivate in this period, falling into his previous routine of going to the library during the day to read through the divine battle art and technique manuals, while his nights were spent comprehending what he had read.

Huang Xiaolong had grasped the entirety of the Golden Dragon Divine Art he obtained from the Golden Dragon Sacred Temple.

As the number of divine battle arts and techniques he saw increased, the intention of creating his own cultivation technique and battle art grew stronger and clearer as the days went by.

In the beginning, he only thought of creating his own cultivation technique without any sense of direction, but now he could see a vague skeleton of what he wished to create.

Still, Huang Xiaolong felt like he needed to study more manuals so that he could build, merge, and improve further, hence he was in no hurry to start creating.

In these two months, Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling came to see him more than once, advising Huang Xiaolong to cultivate well while guiding him.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t bear to refuse these two people’s kind intentions, and thanks to their guidance, his understanding of the many divine battle arts and technique manuals he studied lately had deepened.

It could be said that Huang Xiaolong never had any sense of belonging to the Barbarian God Sect, but ever since the Giant Tribe incident, there was a subtle change in this aspect, making Huang Xiaolong begin to think of the Barbarian God Sect as his first home in the Divine World.

In the future, he would make every effort to protect the Barbarian God Sect.

Another month passed in peace.

Huang Xiaolong who had been close to advancing to peak late-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm finally advanced successfully without any suspense, just half a step more and he’d be able to reach Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm.

The weather on this day was exceptionally good, both the sun and wind were present.

Huang Xiaolong planned to head to the Jadeite Kingdom, he was looking forward to seeing what was behind the Zhenyu Sect’s inner treasury hall.

When he first entered the Zhenyu Sect’s treasury, his strength was lacking thus unable to open the steel wall to the inner hall. But now, he believed there shouldn’t be any problem opening that steel wall with his significant improvement as well as Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du, three Ancient God Realm masters.

The Zhenyu Sect treasury’s outer hall was already lined with close to twenty stalks of forty-million-years-old medicinal herbs, what kind of treasure would there be in the inner hall? Huang Xiaolong’s anticipation increased.

Apart from the Zhenyu Sect treasury’s inner hall, he also planned to go check on Yao Chi at the Lin Family Fort.

In the blink of an eye, it had been years since they last met.

Yao Chi’s enchanting and alluring face appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

Not long after he left the Barbarian God City, he ran into Cao Feng, Chen Hao’s woman!

Cao Feng was flying toward the Barbarian God City with several Sky Dragon League female disciples.

Their gazes collided in midair.

Riding on the little cow, Huang Xiaolong flew past Cao Feng’s group.

“Stop!” Cao Feng shouted all of a sudden, appearing in front of Huang Xiaolong, blocking his way. Watching Huang Xiaolong ignore her, the hatred in her heart soared.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered in annoyance as he stared opposite him.

“Huang Xiaolong, you didn’t see this coming, did you? The Giant Tribe Patriarch is accepting my hubby as his godson.” Cao Feng looked at Huang Xiaolong with ridicule and complacency, “Regret must be eating you alive right now, do you regret going against my hubby?”

“Are you done?” Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as he always was, “If you’re done, you can scram out of my way!”

The complacent sneer on Cao Feng’s face stiffened at Huang Xiaolong’s response. Pointing a finger at his face in anger, Cao Feng’s chest rose up and down, “You! Huang Xiaolong, you’re still so arrogant for someone who’s about to die! Let me tell you, three years later, the Giant Tribe Patriarch will return from the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, my hubby said it. At that time, he’ll kill you with his own hands!”
