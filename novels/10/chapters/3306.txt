Chapter 3307: Destruction Grandmaster

“Send me the location of the Zhang Family Manor.” Huang Xiaolong growled.

“Yes!” Huang Shengan didn’t dare to dally as he quickly sent all the information on the Zhang Family over.

After scanning through the information, he disappeared from his location. In the next second, he appeared in the space above the university.

Taking several steps forward, Huang Xiaolong might look like he was taking a stroll, but he was moving faster than flying ships.

He quickly left the capital city.

When he approached the Zhang Family Manor, a flying ship was headed right towards him. It was one of the most famous ships on Earth, and it was called the Sky Seeker. It was a super luxurious ship, and everyone who could board were no ordinary people.

“Look! There seems to be something headed straight for us!” Someone screamed.

Many people in the ship looked through the glass to see a figure walking towards them.

“It’s a person!”

“Someone is flying towards the Sky Seeker! He has to be a Nascent Soul Realm expert!”

They stared at him in shock.

“Please take another path! I repeat, the person heading straight for the ship, please take another path!” A warning blared from the sirens of the ship.

However, the person walking towards them didn’t seem to care in the slightest.

“If you refuse to take another path, we will open fire! I repeat, we will open fire!” The warning sounded out once again as the canons on the ship started to preheat. Beams of light emerged and locked on to Huang Xiaolong. Ordinarily, flying ships would take another path when they ran into a Nascent Soul Realm expert. However, that was they Sky Seeker, and their guests were members of the upper echelon of the world! They wouldn’t bother offending a mere Nascent Soul Realm cultivator.

“Three…”

“Two…”

“One!”

“Fire!”

The captain ordered when he saw that Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of giving way. In an instant, several cannons lit up as they shot at Huang Xiaolong. Canons on board ships at the level of the Sky Seeker wasn’t something ordinary ships could compare to. They were stronger than the purple canons the police force possessed, and even Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm cultivators would have to dodge.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong was devoured by the light, those on the ship screamed in fright. They thought that he was destroyed by the canons.

However, the scene that played out before them caused their jaws to drop in disbelief.

A man walked out of the blast like it was nothing!

He was completely fine!

Everyone felt that their eyes were deceiving them as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

A look of terror flashed across the captain’s face and he roared, “It’s… It’s an Enlightenment Realm expert! Hurry up and get out of his way!” When the people manning the ship’s controls snapped back to attention, it was too late. Huang Xiaolong had already arrived ten meters away!

As he continued to walk forward, everyone felt the ship moving to the side. A terrifying power pushed the ship aside as Huang Xiaolong made his way forward. The entire ship was like a toy in the ocean as it was toyed around by Huang Xiaolong. The captain was shocked to discover that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t advance a single inch!

“Look! That looks like the Sky Seeker!” Someone on land yelled as they watched the scene playing out above their heads.

“Yeah! Look! There’s someone pushing the ship! Someone is actually forcing the ship back!”

Those standing on land screamed in shock.

After they moved several miles away, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand to push the ship away.

Taking another step, Huang Xiaolong disappeared.

Before he left, he looked at the captain of the ship who ordered for them to open fire. Even though it was just a glance, the captain felt as though he had been dunked into a tub of freezing water.

By the time the ship stopped shaking, Huang Xiaolong had already disappeared.

Those on board the ship didn't even dare to breathe loudly when they stopped.

Only after a long time did someone utter, “Who was the guy? When did a monster like that appear in the Huaxia Alliance?” An expert who wore a kimono frowned.

Among the eight alliances, the Japanese Alliance was closest to the Huaxia Alliance. The Japanese Alliance was a little weaker than the Huaxia Alliance, and the expert wearing the kimono was the old ancestor of the Murasakigawa Clan of the Japanese Alliance! He was called Murasakigawa Yuiitsu!

Among the eight strongest families of the Japanese Alliance, the Murasakigawa Clan ranked third!

Very quickly, a disciple of the Murasakigawa Clan managed to dig out everything on Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong. The leader of the grand elders of the Huang Family. He killed the old ancestors of the Zou and Chu Families an hour ago!”

Originally, Murasakigawa Yuiitsu didn’t care too much about the fact that Huang Xiaolong was a grand elder of the Huang Family. But when he heard that he killed the old ancestors of the two families, his eyebrows twitched in surprise.

“Are you sure?!” Murasakigawa Yuiitsu couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“The news is definitely true. Here are the videos that have been uploaded to the web.” The disciple retrieved the videos and handed them over to Murasakigawa Yuiitsu.

After he was done watching it, a look of fear flashed past his eyes.

“Right now, the entire Huaxia Alliance is debating about whether Huang Xiaolong or Ying Tian is the greatest cultivator in the alliance!”

…

In the main hall of the Zhang Family, Zhang Wanqing, the old ancestor of the Zhang Family, glared at Zhang Yuhan and snapped, “Zhang Yuhan, it’s your honor that Eminent Wlder Wang Zheng of the Six Swords Gate has his eyes on you! You should be thanking the gods! In the future, you will receive limitless resources and endless spirit stones!”

“Have you thought of the consequences of rejecting the eminent elder?! The entire family will be dragged down by your decisions!”

Ordinarily, the old ancestors of the families were rarely female. However, the old ancestor of the Zhang Family was one of them. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As one of the large families, the Zhang Family was no weaker compared to the Tan Family of the Donglin Province. As the old ancestor of the Zhang Family, Zhang Wanqing was someone who was pretty famous in the lands. She was known as the Destruction Grandmaster on Earth.

Zhang Yuhan glared at Zhang Wanqing and sneered, “You’re obviously trying to form a connection with the Six Swords Gate by offering me to Wang Zheng! Do you really think that the Six Swords Gate will give you endless resources if I marry him?!”

Zhang Wanqing slapped Zhang Yuhan and left a visible handprint on her face. “Shut it! What do you know?! As the old ancestor of the Zhang Family, I’m doing this for the family! In the future, we will be able to climb into the top ten ranks with the help of the Six Swords Gate!”

Zhang Yuhan didn’t speak a word as she glared at the old ancestor.

“Drag them in now!” Zhang Wanqiag snorted all of a sudden as a group of grand elders dragged a couple into the hall.

“Dad! Mum!” Zhang Yuhan seemed to have thought of something and she snapped, “Zhang Wanqing, what do you think you’re doing?! Let them go right now!”
