Just as the two guards stepped in front of Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti, a shadow flickered and the sounds of fractured bones rang out simultaneously with two tragic screams. In the next moment, the two guards were knocked back, rolling all the way until Li Zishuai’s feet.

Li Zishuai had just sat down, and seeing his two guards at his feet caused Li Zishuai’s mind to temporarily go blank.

Everything happened too fast, even Zhuo Wenting and Zhuo Wenshan were temporarily left in a daze on the spot.

‘This... what just happened?!’ Both women were astounded as they looked at Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti.

By this time, Li Zishuai already recovered from his shock. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, his gaze grew increasingly cold, “It seems I have misjudged you, who would have thought that you’re actually an expert.”

Being able to handle both of his guards at once meant that he was a Fifth Order God Realm cultivator at the very least. This level of strength was considered an upper-level master on the Cloudsea Mainland, even in the Black Tortoise Galaxy.

Hearing this, Zhuo Wenting and Zhuo Wenshan looked at Huang Xiaolong wide-eyed with shock. Never had they imagined that this young man was actually so powerful!

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent, “Probably not an expert, but more than sufficient to deal with you.”

Li Zihuai was taken aback by those words, but soon, he laughed loudly, standing up from his seat, “Punk, although I don’t know which family you belong to, I will amuse myself with you until you’re damaged, crippled, and dead!”

Damaged, crippled, and dead! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The killing intent in Li Zishuai’s eyes thickened.

But, before Li Zishuai could act on his words, a silhouette flickered. Then, in the next moment, Li Zishuai felt his neck tighten. By the time he realized what was going on, Huang Xiaolong was already standing in front of him, one hand clutching at his neck.

“You!” Li Zishuai was furious, and his fist punched toward Huang Xiaolong at lightning speed.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, slamming out fist head-on.

Kacha! Kacha! Sounds of shattered bones were heard, followed by Li Zishuai’s piercing scream.

Huang Xiaolong’s punch had pulverized the bones in Li Zishuai’s hand, and at the same, the frigid Asura Qi seeped into his body, dealing another heavy blow to Li Zishuai.

“Who, are you...?!” Li Zishuai begin to feel pressure, surprise, and anger.

“Who am I?” Huang Xiaolong grinned, his hand exerted pressure on Li Zishuai’s neck, lifting him off the floor. “Who I am, you will know very soon, but didn’t you just say that you want to toy with us till we’re damaged, crippled, and dead? Based on this level of strength?”

Li Zishuai fumed with anger. Initially, he had thought that with his Sixth Order God Realm strength, it wouldn’t be difficult to teach Huang Xiaolong a lesson. But who knew that Huang Xiaolong’s strength greatly surpassed his assumptions.

“Punk, do you know who I am?” Li Zishuai made an effort to open his mouth, hollering loud as he could, “I’m the Li Family’s main descendant disciple, the Li Family’s Patriarch Li Guangming is my Eldest Uncle. If you dare to hurt me, you’re dead for sure! Release me this instant!!”

“Oh~,” Huang Xiaolong mocked, “So, you’re Li Guangming’s nephew, I thought you were Li Guangming’s son.” At the end of his sentence, Huang Xiaolong aimed his fist, striking accurately at Li Zishuai’s chest, sending another burst of frigid Asura qi into his body. On the outside, Li Zishuai’s chest caved in from Huang Xiaolong’s punch.

A ringing tragic scream filled the private room.

“You, you!” Li Zishuai stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, even after knowing his identity, this slave still dared to attack him.

Watching Li Zishuai’s expression, Huang Xiaolong snorted; so what if you’re from the Li Family? He even dared to waste Jiang Yu, what more a mere Li Zishuai?

If others leave me alone, I’ll leave them alone.

If others bother me, I’ll absolutely make them suffer!

Whereas Zhuo Wenting and Zhuo Wenshan had gone deathly pale watching this scene, shaking and shivering uncontrollably, not knowing what to do with themselves.

They too found it hard to believe that Huang Xiaolong actually continued injuring Li Zishuai after finding out his identity. Who exactly was this black-haired young man in front of them? Even if he was a disciple of one of the super forces, he would still be punished once he went back!

Before the terrified eyes of the two women, Huang Xiaolong struck a second punch at Li Zishuai’s chest, right on the center of his ribs. Sounds of breaking bones entered their ears again.

Li Zishuai let out one after another blood-curdling scream.

“Bastard, I’ll make you pay for this, definitely make you pay!” He screamed in pain, and roared in hatred, “I vow to kill you. KILL YOU!!”

Huang Xiaolong completely ignored these screams and shouts, slowly breaking every bone on Li Zishuai’s body, crushing them into pieces before flinging him to the side like a ragdoll.

Li Zishuai was a Sixth Order God Realm master. Tempered by his god battle qi, his bone density was comparable to a godly weapon, but against Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique, it was nothing but dregs. No different than tofu dregs.

Flung to the side by Huang Xiaolong, Li Zishuai’s suffering did not end. The frigid Asura qi was wrecking havoc all over inside his body, the excruciating pain made him hover between life and death. Despite that, there was no fear in Li Zishuai’s eyes, in fact, his killing intent toward Huang Xiaolong grew more intense. That grim expression on his face looked like he wanted swallow Huang Xiaolong alive.

Huang Xiaolong smiled coldly as he approached.

“Xiaolong, don’t, let’s forget it.” Xie Puti who had been standing at the side hesitated slightly before speaking up. Although his strength was lacking, Xie Puti was aware that the Li Family was one of the Black Tortoise Galaxy’s super families.

Li Zishuai suddenly screamed, “Bastard, kill me if you’ve got the guts, come kill me!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled innocently at Xie Puti, “Look, he’s the one begging me to kill him, I’m not at fault.” Huang Xiaolong continued to approach Li Zishuai until he stood before him, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you.”

Li Zishuai laughed with a crazed light in his eyes, “Why, you’re scared now?”

Without saying another word, Huang Xiaolong lifted a foot and stomped down hard.

Zhuo Wenting and Zhuo Wenshan gave a sudden sharp shrill scream. In between, a sound resembling eggs cracking was heard.

Due to the pain, Li Zishuai’s body twitched and jerked, no one could hear the scream coming from his throat. He desperately wanted to clutch his lower part with his hands, but his arms were broken by Huang Xiaolong just moments ago.

Huang Xiaolong mocked, “Afraid? Indeed, I’m afraid of killing you, that way, things won’t be as fun. Your words earlier were ’amuse myself until you’re damaged, crippled, and dead’. That’s exactly what I plan to do with you!” Another foot landed on Li Zishuai’s lower body, punctuating Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Another sharp scream cut across the private room, his eyeballs bulging out of his eye sockets.

Both women had lost all color from their faces. At this moment, in their eyes, Huang Xiaolong was no longer a slave or a country bumpkin, he was the devil incarnate!

All of sudden, Huang Xiaolong stopped and turned around toward the two women, “You two, come here.”

Zhuo Wenting and Zhuo Wenshan shuddered, eyes wide with fear, even so, they still did as Huang Xiaolong said.

“May, may I ask, what you...” Zhuo Wenting braced herself to speak, wanting to ask Huang Xiaolong what he wanted from them, Huang Xiaolong cut her words. Pointing at Li Zishuai’s lower part, he ordered: “Both of you go, each of you step on it one time! A full strength, wholehearted step!”

Both women were ashen at the sight of Li Zishuai’s lower part, shaking their heads vehemently.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Of course, your other choice is to die!” Saying this, the Blades of Asura appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. The room’s atmosphere instantly changed, like it had fallen the deepest parts of the netherworld hell.

Seeing this, Xie Puti wanted to speak again, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head and gave him a reassuring look.

In the end, both women inched forward, mustering their strength and stomped down as hard as they could.

Li Zishuai glared at the two women with bloodshot eyes.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Xie Puti.

Xie Puti sighed in his heart. He nodded at Huang Xiaolong and they left the private room. He understood the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s action, with those two kicks, it was impossible for Zhuo Wenshan to marry into the Li Family now. Not only that, the Zhuo Family would spend their days worrying about retaliation from the Li Family.

However, Xie Puti had seen through the real nature of a woman like Zhuo Wenshan.
