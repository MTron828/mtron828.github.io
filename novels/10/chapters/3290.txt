Chapter 3291: Entering the Heavenly Dragon Building

When Zou Xueqing and Lin Shuang saw Huang Xiaolong walking over, they slammed their heads into the ground without a word. They didn’t know what to say, and Lin Shuang seemed to have forgotten everything she said to her mother when Lin Xiaotian was summoned previously.

After Lin Xiaotian left, Lin Shuang doubted Huang Xiaolong could do anything to them even with his identity as a grand elder of the Huang Family.

However, now that he was standing before her, she slammed her head into the ground so hard that it was about to break.

Lin Xiaotian screamed as he looked at Huang Wen, “Wenwen, I was wrong! Seeing as we have been married for so many years, please save me! I don’t wish to die!”

Huang Wen hesitated for a moment when she heard his pleas.

However, Lin Kai wasn’t so kind. “Married? Did you forget how you expelled my mother from your family just several hours ago?”

The blood drained from Lin Xiaotian’s face when he heard what Lin Kai said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Flicking his fingers, Huang Xiaolong sent a ray of light into the bodies of Zou Xueqing, Lin Shuang, and Lin Xiaotian. They dropped to the ground as they rolled about in pain.

The pain was so unbearable that Zou Xueqing tore her face apart with her nails, and she became a bloody mess. Lin Guodong and the grand elders of the Lin Family felt their scalps going numb when they saw what happened.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t take matters into his own hands. He eventually released the three of them and handed them over to Huang Wen.

As her heart softened, Huang Wen chose to spare Lin Xiaotian. However, she only managed to save his life. Lin Kai glared at his ‘brothers’ who had beaten him half to death and seethed with anger.

Even though Huang Wen allowed Lin Xiaotian to live, Lin Guodong wasn’t stupid. He made an announcement to the entire family that he would strip Lin Xiaotian of his status as an elder of the Lin Family. He would be expelled from the Lin Family with his wives and children that very instant!

When Huang Wen boarded Huang Xiaolong’s flying ship to leave the Lin Family, Lin Xiaotian’s cries for her to stay fell on deaf ears.

As the flying ship left the Lin Family, Lin Xiaotian collapsed on the ground with a face full of despair.

Now that he had been expelled from the Lin Family, there would be nowhere left for him to go. The Huaxia Alliance might be large, but no one would dare to take him in!

On the flying ship, Huang Wen and Lin Kai stared at the chests full of spiritual fruits and herbs with their jaws wide open.

“These were meant for you when we visited the Lin Family, but we didn’t think that something like that would happen…” Wang Meilan sighed.

“Mum, did you buy all these spiritual fruits for me?!” Huang Wen gasped in shock.

Wang Meilan and Huang Jiyuan looked at each other and smiled.

“Of course not! Xiaolong grew these himself!” Wang Meilan explained.

Huang Wen turned to look at Huang Xiaolong in surprise. “Is that true?! Did you grow all of these yourself?!”

Huang Jiyuan continued, “These are merely a little bit of the fruits in your brother’s garden! When we return to Huazhou City, you’ll understand!”

A little bit!

Huang Wen and Lin Kai felt question marks popping up in their minds.

“Uncle, these fruits… Can we eat them?” Lin Kai gulped down a mouthful of saliva and he asked.

“Of course. If these aren’t enough, you can eat your fill when we get back to the Blue Dragon Orchard.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Laughter permerated the entire flying ship.

In a flash, everyone started to feast on the fruits they brought with them.

Several moments later, Lin Kai held his stomach that had bloated to the size of a basketball and he finally stopped.

The flying ship continued on its way and it slowly approached the Heavenly Dragon Building. In the majestic structure itself, Ying Zhi, the patriarch of the Ying Family, strolled about with two grand elders beside him as they ensured that nothing was amiss.

“The Eight Alliance Summit will be held in several days! Nothing can go wrong! Check everything again, and we cannot miss out a single detail. Any suspicious character who approaches the Heavenly Dragon Building has to be investigated, whether they like it or not!” Ying Zhi warned.

The Eight Alliance Summit would be held in three days on the highest floor of the Heavenly Dragon Building.

Grand Elder Ying Shiming and Ying Xiong nodded respectfully.

“Patriarch, you can rest assured. With the heavenly dragon formation, even a fly won’t be able to enter the building!” Ying Shiming chuckled.

“That’s right! Patriarch, there’s nothing to worry about! Since the Heavenly Dragon Building’s construction several dozen years ago, there hasn’t been a single person who managed to barge into the building.”

Ying Zhi nodded. “Even so, it will be better to be careful. The Turkic extremist groups in the north have been pretty active recently.”

The Turkic extremist group has always been one of the hidden dangers in the Huaxia Alliance. They were situated in the north, but there hasn’t been anyone who could pinpoint their base of operations.

As the three of them approached the top level of the Heavenly Dragon Building, a flying ship hovered a hundred metres away from the structure.

“Xiaolong, let’s forget about it. Chenfei mentioned that the Ying Family’s old patriarch ordered for the death of anyone who dares to trespass. Let’s not do anything stupid…” Wang Meilan started to hesitate now that they had arrived.

“Yeah! Uncle, there has been an Enlightenment Realm expert who ignored the Ying Family’s warning. He was trapped by the heavenly dragon formation before being thrown into the Heavenly City’s prison by the Huaxia Government!” Lin Kai continued, “The Heavenly City’s prison is the most terrifying prison in the Huaxia Alliance! No one will be able to escape after getting thrown in unless they receive a pardon from the old ancestor of the Ying Family!”

As the number one expert in the Huaxia Alliance, the old ancestor of the Ying Family called the shots. If he threw someone into the prison, not even the leaders of the Huaxia Alliance would dare to release someone without his permission.

Lin Kai didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would be crazy enough to set his sights on the Heavenly Dragon Building! Not to mention the fact that he wanted to bring all of them in. He jumped in fright when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s plan.

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he heard their warnings. “Relax. The old ancestor of the Ying Family isn’t capable of throwing me into prison.” As soon as he spoke, the scene before their eyes changed. In an instant, they were teleported into the highest level of the Heavenly Dragon Building.

Lin Kai stared at the interior of the building and he gasped in shock, “We… We… Are we in?!”

Didn’t they say that the heavenly dragon formation around the building was the strongest formation in existence?! Wasn’t it said that no one would ever be able to enter the building by force?!

“Uncle, is the formation inactive right now?” Lin Kai asked.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Yeah maybe.” Turning to Wang Meilan, he continued, “This is the highest floor in the Heavenly Dragon Building. Let’s take a look around!”

Wang Meilan stared at him in shock but she soon regained her calm.

The entire group started to chat as they strolled about the highest floor of the Heavenly Dragon Building.

With the size of the building, the top floor had enough space to house a giant department store! It was nearly six thousand square feet large, and there were countless structures and decorative items laid all about. All of them came from the greatest craftsmen on earth, and some of them were even worth several million low-grade spirit stones. One could easily see how powerful the Ying Family was from that.

When everyone was walking around and taking in the sights, the elevator door dinged and three figures appeared on the highest floor. They were none other than Ying Zhi, Ying Shiming, and Ying Xiong.

As soon as the doors opened, they were flabbergasted when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s group of seven.
