Even though they ignored him, Huang Xiaolong didn’t display any expression of rage. He merely looked at the two parties with a look of interest.

Wi Yixi and Tan Zhiming should be grand elders of their respective factions...

Wu Yixi was a late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert. As for Tan Zhiming, he was at the peak of the mid-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. They were comparable in strength, and after comparing the disciples they had brought with them, it was hard to tell which side was stronger.

“I’ll give you eight hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.” Tan Zhiming gritted his teeth and said, “As long as you leave right now with all your disciples, I will give you eight hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.”

Eight hundred thousand!

He increased the total amount by three hundred thousand at once! That caused Tan Zhiming’s heart to bleed.

However, he knew that nothing good would come out of the prolonged fight between the two parties.

A cold laugh emerged from Wu Yixi’s mouth. “Like what I said before. Why don’t I take out eight hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones, and you give me the seed?”

Tan Zhiming’s face changed, and he raged, “Wu Yixi, you shouldn’t push your luck! I found the Seed of Enlightenment, and you’re getting eight hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones for nothing! Why are you still complaining? You shouldn’t be too greedy. Right now, I’ll give you a million low-grade chaos spirit stones if you leave with all your disciples.”

Wu Yixi snickered. “You make it sound so great. Why don’t you say that you managed to obtain the Seed of Enlightenment for free?! Fine. I will leave with my disciples, but you have to cough up ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones!”

Ten million!

When Tan Zhiming heard the insane price Wu Yixi called out, rage erupted in his heart.

Ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones! Even if he sold off the treasures in the Spirit Destruction Sect, he wouldn’t get that amount. Wu Yixi was clearly making things difficult for him, and there was no way they would reach a compromise.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the two of them, bargaining with each other and thought out loud, “How about this. I’ll give both of you ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones, and you’ll leave the Seed of Enlightenment behind. How about that?”

Everyone felt their jaws drop in shock as they turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Wu Yixi roared with laughter, and it sounded tough on the ears. “Brat, aren’t you brave? How dare you joke around with us?”

According to him, there was no way a Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch could take out ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones. Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a clown.

Not only was Wu Yixi thinking that way, but even the members of the Spirit Destruction Sect were laughing at him in their hearts.

“Brat, you’re looking to die!” One of the Spirit Destruction Sect’s experts, beside Tan Zhiming, could no longer watch this, and he appeared before Huang Xiaolong with a flash of his body.

Looking at the fist that appeared before him, Huang Xiaolong snorted in contempt. They had really picked the wrong opponent this time...

Without even taking out his divine artifacts, Huang Xiaolong simply returned the punch with one of his own.

Boom!

A loud explosion reverberated through the air.

When everyone thought that the Spirit Destruction Sect’s expert had defeated Huang Xiaolong, someone flew outwards from the explosion’s location. He landed on the ground and laid limp. He gasped and felt that every bone in his body was broken.

Everyone looked at him in shock.

Tan Zhiming’s face turned a shade darker, and it was clear that the person who was sent flying was one of the members of his Spirit Destruction Sect. All the bones in his body were ground into dust, and even his organs were ruptured.

“Who are you?! How dare you hurt a grand elder of the Spirit Destruction Sect?!” Tan Zhicheng glared at Huang Xiaolong coldly.

Wu Yixi burst out laughing all of a sudden. He turned around and praised Huang Xiaolong, “You’re pretty strong. How about an alliance with us? As long as we kill Tan Zhiming, my Black Ant Clan will treat you well. I will even give you one hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones. How about that?”

Afraid that Huang Xiaolong would reject him, Wu Yixi even added a term. “My Black Ant Clan will even invite you to our headquarters and bestow upon you an honorary grand elder status.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Black Ant Clan’s honorary grand elder status?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled and looked elated at the prospect.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s smile, Wu Yixi felt the corner of his lips arching towards the sky. “That’s right. An honorary grand elder status at the Black Ant Clan! With your talent and my recommendation, you will definitely be able to obtain the position! You might even be a true grand elder if you work hard!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed. “I have come all this way to the Black Ant Plane to kill your patriarch.”

Wu Yixi’s face froze, and Tan Zhiming felt a bomb going off in his head. Everyone was stunned.

Wu Yixi burst out laughing all of a sudden. “What did you say? You’re here to kill our patriarch?! Do you even know his name?”

The disciples from the Blank Ant Race roared with laughter as well.

Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with them, and he raised his arm. In a flash, Wu Yixi felt a terrifying suction force pulling towards Huang Xiaolong.

When Wu Yixi arrived before him, Huang Xiaolong circulated his king of supreme godhead’s devouring force. Wu Yixi’s body withered at an alarming speed, and his godforce, blood essence, and anything that could be of use were drained from him.

Huang Xiaolong swept out and casually threw Wu Yixi’s body to the side. Wu Yixi’s corpse’s eyes were opened wide, and there was an expression of terror in them.

Everything had happened too quickly and no one managed to react in time. The members of the Black Ant Clan could only watch in shock.

“I know your patriarch. He is called Liao Yuan.” Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent voice resounded through the air.

He wanted to kill Liao Yuan. In fact, he wanted to kill far more people than Liao Yuan!

When Tan Zhiming snapped back to reality, he heaved a breath of cold air as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. He was dumbstruck. Both he and Wu Yixi had thought that he was merely comparable to them in strength when he had sent the Spirit Destruction Sect’s grand elder flying. That was the only reason Wu Yixi had decided to compromise and form an alliance with him.

However, Tan Zhiming finally realized his mistakes. He couldn’t be more wrong about his assumption of Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

The Black Ant Clan’s disciples’ cries broke the silence as they started flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the one who had made the move. The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin simply raised its legs and stomped downwards. In an instant, several hundred members of the Black Ant Clan slammed into the ground and no longer made a sound.

Tan Zhiming and his fellow disciples felt their bodies go stiff.

Huang Xiaolong turned and looked at them before chuckling, “What do you think of my previous proposal?”

Proposal?!

Tan Zhiming looked at the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he couldn’t stop his body from trembling. He had no idea what Huang Xiaolong wanted.

“Didn’t I say that I will give you ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones if you give me the Seed of Enlightenment?”
