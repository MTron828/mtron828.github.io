Chapter 3659: What’s the Problem?

The disciples spoke pretty loudly and confidently, attracting the attention of disciples nearby.

“Chen Bi! What is the young master of the Chen Family doing here! Aren’t you the most talented one? You’re one of the four geniuses of our Feihong Celestial Empire! Many people said that he will definitely be able to break through to the God of Creation Realm this time!” One of the groups in the distance recognized Chen Bi and he cried.

Chen Bi smiled humbly at Huang Xiaolong, “That’s just something they made up themselves. I’m not as talented as they say!”

However, the grin on his face revealed his true feelings.

Wu Xin and Ye Ye exchanged a glance and smiled. If not for Huang Xiaolong stopping them, they would have sent the arrogant brat to the afterlife.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Then I shall congratulate you in advance on your breakthrough then!”

Chen Bi didn’t reject it. “Many thanks, Brother Huang!”

As they continued on their way, Huang Xiaolong asked casually, “Didn’t your ancestor come to ascend the mountain?”

“We ran into the old ancestor of the Du Family of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. He decided to travel with ancestor Du Chengjiang and he should be coming soon.” Chen Bi explained.

“Old ancestor of the Du Family?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Yu Xiaohong. Who better to answer his question than the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire?

“Du Chengjiang is a God of Creation at the large completion stage. He has around 4 billion units of grand cosmos energy.” She replied.

Chen Bi looked at Yu Xiaohong and he gasped lightly. “I didn’t expect young lady to know about Lord Du Chengjiang! That’s right. Lord Du is a God of Creation at the large completion stage. Even in the Xiaohong Celestial Empire, he’s an amazing figure.”

“We have a great relationship with Lord Du!” Chen Bi continued to exaggerate, afraid that Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er weren't paying attention. “Lord Du often visits my Chen Family and he even gave me pointers when cultivating!”

It was a glorious thing to be able to receive pointers from a God of Creation at the large completion stage!

Not everyone could get a chance to do so.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “When the time comes, please do the introductions. I would like to meet this Lord Du Chengjiang you’re talking about.”

“Naturally.” Chen Bi smiled. “I can make several introductions when the time comes, including the two ladies!” He looked at Tao Han’er and Yu Xiaohong.

Very quickly, they arrived in the city.

They saw many people heading towards the Heavenly Peak, and one of the disciples beside Chen Bi said all of a sudden, “Young Master, that’s Lord Zhu Ding!”

Chen Bi looked over only to see the inner disciple of the Zhu Family walking towards them. A grin formed on his face and he rushed over. He greeted them respectfully, “Chen Bi greets Lord Zhu Ding and Lord Zhu Yuan!”

The two of them were the inner disciples of the Zhu Family, but even though they were mere inner disciples, their status was much higher than Chen Bi!

He only managed to get acquainted with them during one of the banquets held by some superpower in the region.

“Oh? Are you the young master of the Chen Family from the Feihong Celestial Empire?” Zhu Ding crossed his hands across his chest and sneered.

Zhu Yuan remained expressionless as he ignored Chen Bi entirely.

“Yes, yes! That’s me! I didn’t expect Lord Zhu Ding to remember me!” He felt extremely honored as excitement bubbled in his heart.

Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan casually swept their gaze across Huang Xiaolong’s group. Their eyes lit up when they saw Yu Xiaohong and Tao Han’er.

“Are these two young ladies disciples of your Chen Family too?” Zhu Ding smiled suddenly.

Chen Bi hesitated slightly, but he quickly replied, “No. They are my friends. This young lady is called Tao Han’er!”

The disciples of the Zhu Family didn’t connect her name to the princess of the Jian Family, and Zhu Ding nodded. “Young Lady Tao Han’er.”

Tao Han’er ignored the disciples of the Zhu Family completely. “Lord Huang, shall we go?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and he turned to leave. Yu Xiaohong, Jian Wushuang, and the others followed closely behind.

The expressions on Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan sank instantly.

The moment they did, Chen Bi jumped in fright. He quickly explained, “They come from a third-rate family and they don’t know who Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan are! Please forgive them! I will lecture them the moment I get back!”

Their expression finally started to let up after hearing what Chen Bi said.

“Third-rate family?” Zhu Yuan looked at their leaving figures and a sinister expression formed on his face.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If Huang Xiaolong came from some super power, he might be afraid to do anything to them. However, things were different when they had no backing.

“I’ll give you a chance. Host a banquet for the two of us in the Maple Moon Pavilion tonight. Bring the two ladies with you.”

Chen Bi was stunned. However, happiness soon filled his heart. Even so, he seemed to have recalled something and he stuttered, “The Heavenly Peak is about to open soon. Lords, why don’t I host the two of you after it ends?”

Ascending the peak the moment it opened was the ideal choice. After all, the clouds would only scatter for a month. One month later, everything would come to an end. No one wished to miss the chance to improve themselves!

The clouds in the air were about to scatter and Chen Bi didn’t want to miss the chance to ascend!

“What’s the problem? Are you unwilling to do so?” Zhu Ding growled.

Chen Bi explained hurriedly, “No! Of course not! However, that young man isn’t from my Chen Family! Han’er seems to be following him. He might not agree…”

“Hmph. Tell him that he won’t get the chance to attempt the climb if he refuses! I’ll kick him off the mountain myself! Do you know what to do now?!” Zhu Ding snorted.

Chen Bi nodded his head hastily, “Yes, yes… I understand.”

“Go! Remember, Maple Moon Pavilion! Bring both the ladies with you!” Zhu Yuan growled at the side.

The Maple Moon Pavilion was the largest establishment in the Zhu Lan City. Chen Bi bowed towards them before bringing the disciples of his Chen Family to chase after Huang Xiaolong.

When he finally caught up, he hesitated slightly before speaking to Huang Xiaolong, “Brother Huang, just a moment ago, Lords Zhu Ding and Zhu Yuan told me to arrange a banquet for them at the Maple Moon Pavilion. He said that he wants Brother Huang to bring the two ladies with you…”
