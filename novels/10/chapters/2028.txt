Chapter 2029: Heaven Devouring Emperor Surrenders

Under the shocked gazes of the Heaven Devouring Empire’s members, Huang Xiaolong appeared as he rode on the little cow. The King of Darkness followed closely behind as they slowly made their way towards the crowd. The person who made a move was naturally the King of Darkness.

Even though he hadn’t completely recovered, an attack from him wasn’t something a Second Order Sovereign could stand against.

If a Second Order Sovereign like Wu Shaowu could block an attack from him, the King of Darkness’ reputation would have been dragged through the mud.

One had to know that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had to use the Ancient Heavenly Court and gather a group of world leaders before managing to kill him.

Luckily for him, he had managed to condense the Heart of Darkness before they killed him. Otherwise, he would really be dead.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong!” Some of the ancestors from the Heaven Devouring Empire recognized Huang Xiaolong the instant he appeared. Their voices trembled as they called his name.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them as his gaze landed on the devil stele floating in the air. A look of joy flashed through his eyes. “That’s the Imperial Beast Devil Stele!”

The Imperial Beast Devil Stele was the number-one ranked devil stele among the six!

After searching for so long, Huang Xiaolong had finally managed to find it!

The three devil steles in Huang Xiaolong’s body started to glow. With a single thought, he summoned them, and they appeared in the air in front of him. Without the need for Huang Xiaolong to control the stele, the Imperial Beast Devil Stele started to fly towards the three other devil steles.

Compared to the time Wu Shaowu had tried to control the stele, the divine beasts around it didn’t resist Huang Xiaolong. Instead, it seemed as though they were extremely happy.

A furious roar shook the world surface as Wu Shaowu released an ear-splitting roar. He broke through the earth and soared into the sky with rings of blood rotating around his body. The Sovereign’s aura on his body expanded and threatened to swallow everything in its way.

With bloodshot eyes, he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang! Xiao! Long!!!” It was as though he hated that he couldn’t swallow Huang Xiaolong that very instant. Even though he wanted nothing more than to tear Huang Xiaolong to pieces, he didn’t make a move. Instead, he stared at the black-robed man beside him.

“Who are you?” Wu Shaowu growled, “Are you someone Huang Xiaolong called over?”

The King of Darkness disdained to reply to him.

A flash of rage crossed Wu Shaowu’s eyes. “I don’t care who you are! Today, I’m taking the Imperial Beast Devil Stele whether you like it or not!”

According to him, the black-robed man was a Third Order Sovereign. The only reason he was sent flying was because he was taken by surprise.

He felt that he could fight against the Third Order Sovereign without suffering too much if he was careful.

Now that he had located the Imperial Beast Devil Stele, he was extremely reluctant to see Huang Xiaolong take it away.

That was the top-ranked devil stele! It was an incredible treasure, and it wouldn’t lose out to ordinary top-grade grandmist artifacts!

A howl left his mouth the moment he spoke, and he charged towards the Imperial Beast Devil Stele. He sent a claw towards The King of Darkness and Huang Xiaolong.

Even though three other devil steles were floating in the air, he ignored them all. He knew that Huang Xiaolong had already refined them, and he wouldn’t be able to do anything to the other three devil steles unless he killed Huang Xiaolong.

“Go!”

He turned and yelled at the Emperors under him.

In an instant, the experts of the Heaven Devouring Emperor Country moved against Huang Xiaolong.

“You’re overestimating yourself!”

“Dumb*ss!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The King of Darkness harrumphed. He hadn’t gone all out previously as Huang Xiaolong had asked him to go easy on Wu Shaowu. He had hoped that he could make Wu Shaowu surrender.

Looking at Wu Shaowu’s ‘zealous’ attitude, the King of Darkness welcomed his attack with a single fist.

In the instant he sent his fist out, the world turned into darkness. Devil qi swallowed the world and destroyed everything in its path.”

When Wu Shaowu realized that the person in front of him was an undefeatable existence, the expression on his face changed. “Mid... Mid-level Sovereign!”

The strength that the King of Darkness possessed definitely placed him in the mid-level Sovereign Realm!

Not to mention the fact that he wasn’t an ordinary mid-level Sovereign.

The terrifying wave of darkness energy jolted Wu Shaowu’s mind. A scary name flashed through his head, and he tried to convince himself otherwise. A legend played out in his head as he experienced the darkness energy around him, and the rumors surfaced in his head. A legend that had engraved itself in his mind finally showed up.

The only response he received was a palm strike to the face.

By the time the King of Darkness’ attack landed, Wu Shaowu’s claw had turned into nothing but a mist of blood. Despite that, the palm didn’t slow down as it continued to fly towards Wu Shaowu’s chest.

Boom!

Once again, Wu Shaowu was sent flying. He smashed through countless mountain peaks, and levelled several forests. Several unfortunate devil beasts that failed to escape in time turned into a pile of flesh after he crashed into them.

As the King of Darkness made his move, the little cow didn’t remain idle. She raised her leg and sent everyone from the Heaven Devouring Empire flying.

After putting her leg down, she felt that it was going numb. Extending her leg again, she did some stretches.

After the King of Darkness sent Wu Shaowu flying, he waved his arm to drag Wu Shaowu back to Huang Xiaolong.

By then, Wu Shaowu’s body was already dyed red.

His chest heaved up and down as he stared at the little cow and the King of Darkness with fear in his eyes.

“You... You guys are the King of Darkness and Old Ancestor Azure Cow?!” Subconsciously, his tone turned into one of reverence when he addressed them.

Even if he was a Second Order Sovereign, he was a junior when facing the two monstrous existences.

The little cow chuckled when she heard how he addressed them. “You’re not too bad, a little smarter than Lan Chong.”

“Lan Chong... What happened to him?” Wu Shaowu’s heart trembled when he heard that they were comparing him to Lan Chong.

“He’s dead.” The King of Shadows snorted in response.

“D... D... Dead?!” Wu Shaowu’s eyes widened to the size of saucers, and the blood drained from his face. The experts from the Heaven Devouring Empire felt their legs going soft.

Lan Chong, the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Great Emperor, was dead!

A warm smile soon appeared on the little cow’s face. “Wu Shaowu, you should know why we didn’t kill you the moment we appeared...”

Looking at the smile on the little cow’s face, Wu Shaowu felt a sense of dread like never before.

“You only have one chance.” Huang Xiaolong spoke up all of a sudden. “You can choose to live, or you can choose to die. I’ll give you a minute to think about it.”

There wasn’t much hatred between him and the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, and if Wu Shaowu chose to surrender, he wouldn’t mind taking in another Sovereign Realm expert.

Complex emotions appeared on Wu Shaowu’s face when he heard his options.

Seconds ticked past, and it seemed like an eternity passed in the span of thirty seconds. Wu Shaowu raised his head suddenly, and he ground his teeth as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “It’s a matter of time before Your Majesty gathers all six devil steles. When you unify the Devil World, I’ll still have to submit. It’s nothing for me to surrender now. However, I’ve heard that you would reward anyone who submitted with two hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones...”

He didn’t dare to continue as a tinge of embarrassment surfaced on his face. However, his meaning was clear. He was in a bit of a financial pickle anyway.

Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter when he heard what Wu Shaowu said.
