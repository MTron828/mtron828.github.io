When Huang Xiaolong saw the phantoms forming around Di Jing’s body, he felt a trace of shock in his heart. He would have never expected Di Jing to have actually succeeded in cultivating the technique!

The Phantom of Ten Thousand Emperors was something Huang Xiaolong had heard of before. Even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had failed when cultivating this technique. That in itself was enough to display the difficulty of the technique.

Even though no one had managed to cultivate the technique or seen it in action, everyone was sure that anyone who managed to achieve some success in it would possess terrifying strength!

Some people felt that as long as one reached the large success stage in the Phantom of Ten Thousand Emperors, they would be unbeatable!

Putting Huang Xiaolong aside, even Heavenly Emperor Di Jun was shocked. It was clear that Di Jing hadn’t told him anything about the Phantom of Ten Thousand Emperors.

After his initial shock, Di Jun’s surprise turned to joy as he felt a massive weight lifted off his chest.

With the Jade Dragon Manual and the Phantom of Ten Thousand Emperors, Huang Xiaolong was dead meat. There was no need to mention the fact that Di Jing even had the number one godhead and unique physique.

With his son’s current strength, Di Jun felt that it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that he was invincible compared to cultivators under the Emperor Realm.

As for Huang Xiaolong, Di Jun refused to believe that he had broken past the Heavenly Monarch Realm into the Emperor Realm. It was simply an impossible feat.

Along with the rise in Di Jing’s strength, First Order Emperors started to feel suppressed by his aura.

“It’s too strong! This is the true strength of Heavenly Prince Di Jing!”

“I don’t think that even I’ll be able to defeat him!” One of the ancestors in the First Order Emperor Realm exclaimed in shock.

Everyone was scared silly by Di Jing’s strength.

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and Bei Xiaomei felt their hearts dropping.

“Uncle has the Black Dragon Divine Armor... He should be able to win, right?” Bei Xiaomei muttered in an attempt to console herself.

Zhao Lei shook his head and said, “That’s hard to say. Even though the Black Dragon Divine Armor isn’t too bad, it’s still just a piece of armor at the end of the day. If the attack from the other party goes past its limit, it will break for sure. The ability of the armor also depends on the user himself...”

A worried expression appeared on Bei Xiaomei’s face. “Wouldn’t that mean that there’s no chance for uncle to win?!”

Zhao Lei fell into silence and refused to reply.

When these conversations were going down, the number of phantoms around Di Jing’s body had already increased to 162. He was finally done, and the number stabilized.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief at this sight.

After reaching the small completion of the Phantom of Ten Thousand Emperors, the cultivator could form a thousand phantoms. They could only form the full ten thousand after mastering the technique.

With 162 phantoms around Di Jing, Huang Xiaolong knew that he hadn’t reached the small competition stage.

Before anyone could react, Di Jing’s body shook. No, it was more accurate to say that the heavens and earth shook. The heaven and earth in the Divine World trembled, and everyone felt the ground under their feet, shifting a little.

What in the world was going on?

“That... That’s the Heavenly Dao Godhead!”

Some Emperor Realm ancestors pointed into the space above Di Jing’s head and yelled in shock. A godhead slowly emerged from inside Di Jing’s body, and the moment it appeared, an unstoppable wave of energy rushed out and filled the area.

The moment the Heavenly Dao godhead appeared, the heaven and earth itself reacted. Even the Heavenly Dao responded to the appearance.

Everyone stared at Di Jing’s Heavenly Dao Godhead, and they felt an urge to kneel as a show of respect. The feeling was too strong, and they couldn’t find it in them to fight it.

The Heavenly Dao Godhead soared into the nine heavens, and strands of divine lightning started to gather around it. The lightning was different from Chaos Lightning, and it held a far more terrifying origin. It gave off a weird feeling and seemed to possess the might of heavenly punishment itself.

As the Heavenly Dao Godhead soared through the air, resplendent light illuminated the skies of the countless worlds in the Divine World. The light pierced through the void itself, and it eventually shone on Heavenly Prince Di Jing. Once again, he seemed to turn a little stronger.

Everyone stared at Di Jing in shock.

He was simply too strong!

That was the only thought running through their minds when they looked at Di Jing!

Even people like Chen Wenqian, who were at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect and worship with the appearance of Heavenly Dao Godhead.

Heavenly Prince Di Jing was Heavenly Dao itself! He was the heavens! No one could go against his will!

If anyone dared to move against him, it would mean going against the Heavenly Dao, and Heavenly punishment would endlessly rain upon them!

Heavenly punishment wouldn’t stop until the offender vanished from the world!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but release his full strength under pressure.

“Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?!”

Everyone was stunned when Huang Xiaolong revealed his true strength. They looked at him incredulously.

Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm... Huang Xiaolong was a mere Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch!

When he had destroyed Lan Tailong with two punches, everyone had thought that he had already reached the Ninth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm at the very least. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

All of them felt mind blown. The difference in strength was too much! Heavenly Prince Di Jing was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. How was he going to jump three ranks up to fight with Di Jing?!

There was no need even to bring up Di Jing’s godhead, physique, and techniques if that was the case.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re going to lose for sure! Why even bother fighting?”

“Why did you even accept Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s challenge with your pitiful strength? Pei! What a joke! Huang Xiaolong, just go home and drink some milk!”

Under Chen Wenqian’s order, all the disciples from the Brightness Emperor Palace started to mock and laugh.

The Solitude Emperor Palace wasn’t going to miss a chance to mock Huang Xiaolong, and neither were the members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent, and he simply circulated the power of his Asura bloodline.

In Hell, he had devoured the Massacring Gods Gate’s young master, Song Li Tao, and Lu Kun’s disciple, Peng Zhengfei. The young master of the Howling Moon Wolf Race wasn’t able to avoid suffering a miserable fate in Huang Xiaolong’s hands as well, and he had devoured all of them. His Asura bloodline had reached a terrifying level of concentration.

Blacklight surged out of his body at a horrifying speed and covered his entire body in scales. Golden spikes grew out from his limbs, and his eyes glowed a resplendent golden-black color. A single horn protruded from his forehead and shone with a terrifying black radiance.

The aura around Huang Xiaolong’s body started to rise as well, and the might of a Ninth Order Heavenly Monarch soon filled the area.

“What bloodline does he have?!”

“It’s the bloodline of an Asura from Hell! Wait, there’s no way an ordinary Asura bloodline from hell can possess such terrifying might...”

Even several old ancestors were confused when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s transformation.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s soaring aura, the various Emperor Palaces’ mockery started to die down.

As a dragon’s roar emerged from inside Huang Xiaolong’s body, shocking amounts of dragon essence gushed out from his body. Layers of scales formed around his body and shone with a terrifying light. If someone said that the scales around his body were black, they would be wrong. It was blacker than black. If they thought it was gold, they would still be wrong, as the scales were more golden than gold itself. If they felt that violet was the color to describe the scales, they would have seen wrong. The violet color of his scales was more brilliant than violet itself.

“True Dragon Physique!”
