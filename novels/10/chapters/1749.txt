“Master...Master, save... save me, please.” Sun Shihai, who was lying on the ground, stuttered when he saw Zhou Chen.

“Kill... kill that piece of shit.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

His eyes were filled with hatred. Even though he was on the brink of death, he still couldn’t stop thinking of killing Huang Xiaolong.

However, Zhou Chen stared at him coldly. “Trash! Huang Xiaolong was right when he called you a piece of trash. Even though I spent so many grandmist spiritual pills and resources on you, you lost to him with a single move. If you’re not trash, what are you?”

“What supreme genius? What Archdevil bloodline?! You probably have dogsh*t bloodline!”

The more Zhou Chen spoke, the more upset he became. He was initially planning to place his hopes on Sun Shihai to obtain a good result at the Battle of the Heavenly Court, but now, before it could even start, Sun Shihai was destroyed by Huang Xiaolong.

Sun Shihai had practically thrown all his face away!

Seeing Zhou Chen berating Sun Shihai, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao were dumbfounded.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong was too intrigued by Zhou Chen’s behavior.

At this moment, Zhou Chen turned around. He stared at Huang Xiaolong and grinned, “Huang Xiaolong, you still have the guts to return! Good, good, this way, I can save my two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones.”

“However, I’m curious about something. A few days ago, you were still at the Brimming Snow World. How did you manage to rush back to the Fortune Emperor Palace so quickly? Even if you have a low-grade grandmist spiritual flying ship, you won’t be able to move so quickly...unless!” Zhou Chen’s eyes grew redder.

Huang Xiaolong said indifferently, “That’s right, I have a high-grade grandmist spiritual flying ship.”

Immediately after, a black light flashed in front of everyone’s eyes as a throne appeared before them. Engraved on the throne was a black dragon insignia, and it seemed to look down on all living things!

“Could this be the rumored Primordial Ancient Black Dragon Clan’s Black Dragon Throne?!” Zhou Chen was unable to calm down as he buzzed with excitement.

Black Dragon Throne!

It was rumored to be a high-grade grandmist spiritual flying ship!

“Is this really the Black Dragon Throne? It’s worth tens of millions! No, forty million, or even possibly fifty!” Li Shan and Chen Yirong exclaimed.

Even the eyes of the people in black heated up.

If the Black Dragon Throne was placed in an auction, it could sell for fifty million low-grade chaos spirit stones! What did it mean to have fifty million low-grade chaos spirit stones? Even the Fortune Emperor Palace’s main flying ship wasn’t worth fifty million low-grade chaos spirit stones!

Suddenly, Zhou Chen burst into laughter and said, “Huang Xiaolong, you are fortunate. You even manage to obtain the Primordial Ancient Black Dragon Clan’s Black Dragon Throne. However, I have heard that the treasures of the Black Dragon come in a set of three. Do you have the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle and Black Dragon Divine Armor?”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “It looks like you know quite a lot. That’s right, both the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle and Black Dragon Divine Armor are on me.” He didn’t try to hide anything and revealed the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle on his wrist and the Black Dragon Divine Armor on his body.

Looking at the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle and the Black Dragon Divine Armor, Zhou Chen’s heart pounded wildly. A fire burned in his eyes as he looked at the Black Dragon Divine Armor on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

That was a top-grade grandmist spiritual tool!

It was a top-grade grandmist spiritual armor! It was said that it could absorb dragon qi on its own and refine one’s body and soul simultaneously. Just the armor’s effects were enough to cause a storm of blood, much less the defensive abilities.

Suddenly, Zhou Chen’s gaze landed on one of the men in black, and he said, “Special Envoy He, the Black Dragon Throne will belong to me, while the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle and the Black Dragon Divine Armor will belong to you, what do you think?”

However, the man in black didn’t answer, and instead suppressed his excitement as he looked at Huang Xiaolong and said, “If this brat dares to take out the treasures here, it’s highly likely that he has some sort of backing.”

Zhou Chen was startled for a moment before he broke out into rambunctious laughter. “Special Envoy He, you don’t have to be so humble. There’s only a handful of people that are capable of matching your strength in the Divine World. Even though the four weird creatures behind that brat are quite strong, how can they possibly stand up to you?”

He was extremely confident in the strength of Special Envoy He.

One had to know that Special Envoy He was a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert!

Even though the four monsters’ strength behind Huang Xiaolong wasn’t weak, Special Envoy He could easily destroy all of them with a single move.

“This... brother Chen, is it possible to give the remaining stuff on Huang Xiaolong to the two of us?” Chen Yirong asked carefully.

Li Shan was eager as well.

They didn’t dare to hope for the three Black Dragon Treasures, but surely the other treasures on Huang Xiaolong’s body should belong to them, right? They knew that Huang Xiaolong had several low-grade chaos spiritual veins on his body, and he also had a damaged Yellow Springs Magic Robe on him.

Zhou Chen frowned and looked at Special Envoy He. However, after Special Envoy He nodded, Zhou Chen smiled widely and said generously, “Alright, after getting rid of Huang Xiaolong, the rest of the things will belong to the two of you.”

Li Shan and Chen Yirong thanked Zhou Chen and Special Envoy He with a happy face.

Huang Xiaolong laughed out loud when he saw this scene unfold in front of him.

However, he wasn’t in a rush to make a move.

“Zhou Chen, are you really willing to give the other stuff on me to Li Shan and Chen Yirong?” Huang Xiaolong smiled and continued, “There’re many more things on my body that are more valuable than the Black Dragon Treasures.”

Huang Xiaolong was really telling the truth. Whether it was the City of Eternity, the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, the Heavenly Hall, or the Seed of Enlightenment... Even the Radiance Divine Scepter... Every single one of them was more valuable than the Black Dragon Treasures.

Zhou Chen was stunned for a second, “Huang Xiaolong, why should I believe your words? Do you have things that are more valuable than the Black Dragon Treasures? Is it the damaged Yellow Springs Magic Robe, or those few low-grade chaos spiritual veins?”

What else can he have that is even more valuable than the Black Dragon treasures? Could he possibly have a grandmist artifact with him?

Zhou Chen naturally didn’t believe him.

However, Huang Xiaolong laughed, and his hand flashed before a seed shaped like a Buddha’s head, and the size of a tiny baby appeared in front of everyone.

In the entire hall, golden light radiated, and Buddhist energy burst forth.

“This is?!” Zhou Chen, Special Envoy He, Li Shan, and Chen Yirong were startled.

“This is the seed of the Buddhist World’s number one Divine Bodhi Tree, the Seed of Enlightenment! And this should be the only one in the world.” Huang Xiaolong said with indifference. Even though the Black Dragon Treasures were pretty good, they couldn’t hold a candle to the Seed of Enlightenment.

“What?! The seed of the Buddhist World’s number one Divine Bodhi Tree?!” Zhou Chen and the rest yelled in shock.

Even the beautiful eyes of Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao widened.

Everyone’s gaze landed on the Seed of Enlightenment in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

Suddenly, Zhou Chen lunged forward towards the Seed of Enlightenment in Huang Xiaolong’s hand as he was no longer able to hold himself back.
