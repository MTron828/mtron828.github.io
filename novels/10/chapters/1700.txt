Shi Wushuang glanced in the direction of Tai Yue’s group and said thoughtfully, “Let’s wait a bit more.”

He had come over specifically to kill that Asura noble, so others were not so inconsequential.

Thus, resolving Tai Yue’s group was secondary to his main purpose, moreover, he did not want to consume too much of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s manpower. Killing the Asura noble at the smallest cost to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe was the most ideal outcome.

Shi Wushuang knew many of those present were calculating similar plots. They were hoping that the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, and Howling Moon Wolf Race would suffer heavy losses by going to war against that Asura noble, so they could reap the benefits as fishermen.

He didn’t want to fulfill these people’s wishes. He would act as soon as the Asura noble appeared, killing him with full force blow in the first attack, then the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe would retreat immediately.

While these thoughts churned in Shi Wushuang’s mind, he suddenly heard a loud shout, “Everyone look, quickly look!”

Everyone was attracted by this voice and looked up towards the Heavenly Hall.

The ancient building in the air emitted a burst of radiant light that flowed outwards like a pounding waterfall.

The radiance intensified as the Heavenly Hall’s entrance opened and a figure flew out from within.

“Asura noble! It’s that Asura noble!”

Several forces’ Ancestors exclaimed loudly.

The Misty Palace’s female disciple You Fei’s eyes brightened. She snickered harshly, “He has finally realized that it’s useless to hide inside, so did he finally brace himself to come out?”

Misty Palace’s He Jingyi frowned at You Fei’s attitude and reprimanded her in a low voice, “You Fei!”

Only then did the female disciple You Fei converged herself.

That’s right, the person who flew out was Huang Xiaolong.

Before coming out, he had decided not to have the fourteen Radiance Angels to come out together with him. If it wasn’t necessary, he didn’t want to expose the fourteen Radiance Angels’ existence, yet.

Thus the fourteen Radiance Angels were left inside the Heavenly Hall, and they would assist him in attacking, through the Heavenly Hall.

Although the Heavenly Hall was not a grandmist treasure, it was still a top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact with powerful attack power that was almost comparable to a grandmist treasure.

Huang Xiaolong flew out of the Heavenly Hall holding the Divine Radiance Scepter in his hand and slowly descended step by step, amidst the loud talks, gloating, as well as various kinds of gazes. His actions were seemingly slow, but with each step, he traversed a great distance.

Almost everyone noticed the Divine Radiance Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

“That, that’s a grandmist treasure!”

“Yes, that divine scepter is absolutely a grandmist treasure artifact. That palpitating aura can only come from a grandmist treasure!”

“Grab that divine scepter!”

These various forces’ experts were apprehensive of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods gate, and the Howling Moon Wolf Race, but the temptation of a grandmist treasure was many times greater.

More than a dozen sects’ Ancestors rushed towards Huang Xiaolong.

“All of you are seeking death!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Several of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, and Howling Moon Wolf Race’s Ancestors were outraged seeing these Ancestors’ actions. So they barked and chased after them.

Right at this time, the giant hexagon rune pillar once again appeared below the Heavenly Hall, rotating at high speed. A world shattering destructive power flooded out like an angry galaxial river towards the attacking Ancestors.

The Ancestors lunging forward towards Huang Xiaolong turned deathly pale and their eyes widened with unconcealable fear as they saw the familiar hexagon rune pillar appearing below the Heavenly Hall. They could feel the pressure coming from the destructive power of the hexagon rune.

They had witnessed the horror of this hexagon rune pillar’s destructive power. When the Heavenly Hall had first appeared, quite a few sects’ Ancestors had tried rushing inside it to grab grandmist treasure and top-grade grandmist spiritual pills. In the end, this hexagon rune pillar had appeared and in one attack, it had annihilated and injured several hundred Emperor Realm Ancestors!

“Run—!!”

Panicked shrieks cut across the air, and their voices contained deep despair and the fear of death.

In an instant, those who were lunging towards Huang Xiaolong to grab his Radiance Divine Scepter turned around and fled for their lives without a second thought; fleeing desperately with every shred of energy they had, inwardly wishing they could be faster.

The Heavenly Hall’s destructive power arrived almost instantaneously.

It’s first victim was the Ancestor who had shouted for everyone to grab Huang Xiaolong’s grandmist treasure. He was swallowed by the destructive power in a split second.

A scatter of ash, then another...!

Experts standing far away quivered and broke out in a cold sweat as they watched several Emperor Realm Ancestors reduced into ashes, silently disappearing from the world without a chance to scream.

Despite the distance between them and the Heavenly Hall, the various forces’ experts made a swift retreat, far, far away.

The Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and Howling Moon Wolf Tribe’s Ancestors were also struck by the Heavenly Hall’s destructive power, and a dozen of them were reduced to ashes, while ten or so suffered severe injuries.

The gazes falling on Huang Xiaolong and the Divine Radiance Scepter in his hand had changed in these few short moments, and no one dared to rush up anymore.

Desolate Giant Tai Yue was just about to make a move, but upon seeing that all the enemies were resolved by the Heavenly Hall’s hexagon rune pillar, he heaved a sigh of relief. Together with Jin Yuan and the others, he hastened to Huang Xiaolong’s side with an ecstatic expression. “Congratulations to Master for clearing the Holy Mountain’s twelve floors and obtained the grandmist treasure!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled in return. “Congratulations to us.” In the meantime, he had already leaped onto the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s back. With a wave of his hand, four thousand pills appeared in the air, shining brightly as the sun.

With another wave, the four thousand pills divided into four groups and flew towards Tai Yue, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian while Huang Xiaolong explained, “These are the top-grade grandmist spiritual pills, the Brilliant Sun Divine Pills, for you.”

The four were thrilled and quickly thanked Huang Xiaolong, “Thank you, Master!”

Others watched with burning desire at the four thousand Brilliant Sun Divine Pills.

Four thousand top-grade grandmist spiritual pills ah! How many Hell’s super forces couldn’t take out this amount of wealth?

Huang Xiaolong noticed the greed in the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and Howling Moon Wolf Race’s experts’ eyes, and sneered inwardly. In a little while, he would start a heaven-shaking massacre!

His gaze was fixed on Shi Wushuang.

“Master, that is the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang.” Tai Yue explained to Huang Xiaolong.

Realization struck Huang Xiaolong—no wonder this person’s aura was so overbearing. So he was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Patriarch Shi Wushuang. However, as long as the opponent was not the Nine Yin Giant Corpse’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried at all.

Shi Wushuang had already retrieved his gaze from the Heavenly Hall and had fixed it on Huang Xiaolong. His gloomy but sonorous voice rang in the air, “Mid-Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!”

“Mid-Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!” Only then did the others notice that Huang Xiaolong was already a mid-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm, and sucked in a breath of cold air in shock. Even Shi Yinyu, Qin Huangzhong, Song Litao, He Jingyi, and others looked shocked hearing that.

Before entering the Holy Mountain, Huang Xiaolong was merely a peak late-Second Order Heavenly Monarch!

Within twelve years, he had actually broken through to mid-Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

This!

The killing intent in Shi Wushuang’s eyes intensified. Such an amazing genius must not be allowed to leave the Nethersea alive. Otherwise, it won’t take long for him to break through to Emperor Realm, and it would be harder to kill him at that time.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong was secretly manipulating the Holy Mountain to sink it back into the Nethersea. He was also sending the Heavenly Hall away through the space crack, creating an illusion for everyone.

“Time’s up, the Holy Mountain has sunk back into the Nethersea!”

“The Heavenly Hall has disappeared too!”

Some of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, Massacring Gods Gate, and Howling Moon Wolf Race’s experts were delighted noticing the disappearing Heavenly Hall. The last deterrence was gone.

Shi Wushuang inwardly sighed in relief after seeing this sight. In all honesty, the destructive power from the Heavenly Hall had given him a great deal of pressure. With the Heavenly Hall out of the way, he had no other scruples to resolve Huang Xiaolong.
