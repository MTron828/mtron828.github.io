Jiang Yu laughed at the end of his sentence; a mad, arrogant, complacent, vibrant laughter.

The surrounding All Dragons League disciples also joined in, laughing without restraint. Their eyes flickered red with bloodlust imagining how they would line up after their League Leader was done with Huang Xiaolong, kicking Huang Xiaolong’s birdie one by one until it burst! Until it was destroyed! Their eyes shone with a manic light.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the group of excited All Dragons League disciples. Sensing the brutality and eagerness in their eyes, he sneered coldly, “Is that so?” In a quick flicker, he was already in front of Jiang Yu.

One thousand arms had already fanned out from his back.

“Asura Sword Skill!”

“Great Void Divine Fist!”

“Earthen Buddha Palm!”

“God Binding Palm!”

“The Fifteenth Move of the Dragon God!”

“Asura Demon Claw!”

Huang Xiaolong’s thousand arms displayed all the battle skills he had ever learned. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, the whole sky was filled with sword lights, shadows of fist imprints, countless palms striking down as Buddha luminance cut a path through the thick clouds in the high air. Numerous divine dragons swam out like a tidal wave, weaving between the dark Asura Demon Claws that cast a grim darkness over the mountain peak.

The arrogant smile on Jiang Yu’s face froze staring stupidly at the sky filled with sword lights, fist imprints, palm imprints, Buddha luminance, divine dragons, wailing demons, being replaced by apprehension and panic.

Previously, Jiang Yu thought that the Six Enforcers under him had exaggerated Huang Xiaolong’s strength, as he was but someone who was promoted to an elite disciple. Strong as he may be, in Jiang Yu’s eyes it still wasn’t worth much, especially after he himself had broken through to Seventh Order God Realm. As he saw it, as long as he dared to come, subduing Huang Xiaolong was merely a matter of moving his pinky.

But now...?!

“Golden Yang Reincarnation!”

“Heaven and Earth Reincarnation!’

“Law of Reincarnation!”

“Reincarnation of Endless Lifetimes!”

Jiang Yu reacted half a second later, roaring at the top of his lungs as his god battle qi circulated violently around the surface of his body, displaying his reincarnation based cultivation technique- he was about to go all out! That was his only option!

Facing Huang Xiaolong’s torrent of attacks, a strong sense of crisis gripped Jiang Yu’s heart.

A blinding golden light exploded from Jiang Yu’s body, transforming into an ancient diagram as he slapped both his palms out. Every inch of space that came in contact with the golden light became distorted, overlapping, everchanging.

Entering the territory of the golden light, the sword lights dissipated as if they were transferred to another time and space, even the Buddha luminance from the Earthen Buddha Palm dimmed, whereas the consecutive divine dragons looked as if they rushed into a black hole, reducing in number just like the Asura demons.

Then again, the sword lights, Buddha statues, divine dragons, and demons were just too great in number. Under their assault, the light of reincarnation burst into nothingness, akin to a balloon that was overfed, louder than a thunderclap.

In the overwhelming collision of these two opposing forces, Jiang Yu’s robe exploded into pieces, exposing his bare body as the shockwave sent him reeling backward until he crashed into a peak several li in the distance before sliding down.

To Ceng Leng, Lin Tong, and the others’ astonishment, Jiang Yu’s fair naked body showed sword gashes, and above them were palm prints, fist prints, and even claw marks overlapping each other!

That appearance could easily confound a person into thinking that more than a hundred masters ‘abused’ him at the same time.

When Jiang Yu reached the bottom of the cliff wall, his lower part banged into odd protruded sharp stone, causing a tragic shrill scream to shake the air.

“League Leader!” Ceng Leng, and everyone else were jarred to their senses by Jiang Yu’s scream, each of them trying to rush to their leader’s side as fast as possible.

However, Huang Xiaolong was faster than them. In a flicker, he was already standing in front of Jiang Yu with one foot raised, stomping down hard at his chest,toward the position of the Qi Sea.

A loud boom rang and Jiang Yu’s whole body was embedded into the stone wall.

It did not end there, however. A suction force came from Huang Xiaolong’s palm, lifting Jiang Yu out of the pit. Another kick sent Jiang Yu crashing into the All Dragons League disciples that were rushing to his side, knocking these disciples flying left and right.

Still, Huang Xiaolong had no intention of stopping. In the blink of an eye, he weaved through the disarrayed All Dragons League members, reaching Jiang Yu’s front, landing another kick.

Jiang Yu’s body shot into the distance before slumping weakly to the side.

In that instant, all noise and sound disappeared, silence buzzing in their ears.

The All Dragons Leagues disciples were rooted in place, fear creeping into their eyes as they stared at Huang Xiaolong. In that moment, no one dared to move an inch to check on Jiang Yu, nor did anyone try to stop Huang Xiaolong.

The scene before them had caused their minds to completely blank out.

Was that figure sprawled unconscious on the ground really their League Leader who had advanced into Seventh Order God Realm?! Wasn’t their League Leader supposed to be the strongest person, the number one expert amongst all elite disciples after his breakthrough?!

How could Huang Xiaolong’s strength be this tyrannical?! Even more than the last time they saw him, he was already a Sixth Order God Realm!

Sixth Order God Realm! Furthermore, defeating a Seventh Order God Realm at a realm lower!

Once again riding on the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger, Huang Xiaolong looked down at the big human-shaped pit that Jiang Yu was in from midair.

Jiang Yu slowly climbed out from the pit, his eyes scarlet and bloodthirsty, yet he was laughing with a grisly expression, “Huang Xiaolong, kill me if you’ve got the guts! Come on, kill me! Quickly come kill me!”

As long as Huang Xiaolong killed him, he would be accompanying him in death! He was already a Seventh Order God Realm elite disciple, equivalent to an Elder of the Black Warrior Institute!

If Huang Xiaolong really killed him, even the Institute Principal Feng Yang would be powerless to protect him. Following the long-established rule of the Black Warrior Institute, the murderer of a Black Warrior Institute Elder would be killed without mercy!

“Kill you?” Huang Xiaolong sneered with disdain. He indeed had a strong desire to kill Jiang Yu when he heard about Duanren Emperor, the Elf Queen, Xie Family’s Ancestor, and the others’ deaths at the hands of the All Dragons League.

But now, Huang Xiaolong had calmed down. Dying like this was too easy for Jiang Yu!

Huang Xiaolong wanted him to live wishing for death every day! The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved up in a devious smile, a hand lightly patted the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger under him. Receiving a signal from Huang Xiaolong, the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger lifted its thick left front paw, slamming down, executing a beautiful move of ‘tiger paw crushing bird eggs’.

Jiang Yu’s blood-curdling scream shook the hearts of every All Dragons League disciple.

Still, this wasn’t enough, the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger lifted its right paw that was just as thick and powerful, executing the same move. Just like this, left leg, right leg, left leg, right leg...

The ground trembled with each action, followed by tragic wails.

After a while, the surrounding All Dragons League disciples finally regained their senses, dashing up to stop Huang Xiaolong, but all of them were sent flying with a slap from Huang Xiaolong.

Some time passed before the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger finally stopped.

Jiang Yu seemed to be hanging by a thread, feebly pulling in air, yet the look in his eyes was like he wanted nothing more than tear Huang Xiaolong apart and swallow him into his stomach. Earlier, Huang Xiaolong had shattered his Qi Sea, therefore he was powerless right now in front of Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, as long as I don’t die, there’ll be a day when I’ll kill you! Kill everyone on the Golden Dragon Peak, everyone!!” Jiang Yu gnashed his teeth with each word, his voice sounded like a devil from the deepest of the netherworld.

“Is that so? But, you will never have this chance.” Huang Xiaolong said with the same cold expression. Then, his palm stretched, slapping on the crown of Jiang Yu’s head, covered with a layer of immortal essence fire that drilled into Jiang Yu’s soul, eroding it little by little.

Jiang Yu twisted and rolled on the ground, clutching at his head, hysterically screaming in pain.

A short moment later, Huang Xiaolong retrieved his palm indifferently as he watched Jiang Yu still flipping on the ground. With his soul damaged, Jiang Yu would be no different from an idiot in the future, not even a Highgod Realm master could fix this.

“From today onward, the All Dragons League disciples are to scram out of the Red Flood Mountain Range, otherwise your ending will be the same as Jiang Yu’s!” Leaving that sentence, Huang Xiaolong left with the Nine-tailed Bright Radiance Tiger.
