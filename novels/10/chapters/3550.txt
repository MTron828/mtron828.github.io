Chapter 3551 – Suggestion

“Kun Feng won’t be the only one. Kai Dong’s hatred for Huang Xiaolong knows no bounds. He wants nothing more than to skin Huang Xiaolong alive. With the two of them joining hands, not even the Star Dragon Couple can save Huang Xiaolong.” Feng Tianquan sneered.

“We have to find an opportunity for the Creation Palace to make their move on Huang Xiaolong.” A light flashed in Qian Shaolin’s eyes. No one knew what he was thinking about.

After thinking about it for a second, Tao Shi muttered, “The Unknown Lands is limitless. I’ll propose to the alliance leaders for us to split up when we’re there. Hehe, when that happens, we’ll choose to be in Huang Xiaolong’s group!”

Feng Tianquan clapped his hands together and chuckled happily, “Let’s do it. We’ll lure him over to Kun Feng and Kai Dong when the time comes.”

The experts in the room agreed happily.

“Huang Xiaolong ah Huang Xiaolong, you’ll definitely enjoy the treatment given to you by Kun Feng and Kai Dong.” Feng Tianquan chuckled sinisterly.

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave his cultivation cave the whole time. He was only alerted when they were about to arrive at the Unknown Lands.

“Your Highness, we’re closing in on our destination…” Ao Shenghai reported.

Nodding, Huang Xiaolong kept the universe sphere back into his body before leaving his cultivation cave. Strolling over to the head of the Eternal Heaven flying ship, he saw different types of clouds drifting in the air.

After they crossed the sea of clouds, they would arrive in the Unknown Lands.

The Unknown Lands was one of the most mysterious regions in the thirteen universes. Legends had it that the Unknown Lands existed before the thirteen universes. No matter how much changes went on in the thirteen universes, the Unknown Lands would remain the same.

There was also another saying that the thirteen universes were destroyed once before. Everything that existed in the thirteen universes was born after the universes were reborn. Huang Xiaolong, Mei Jie, Kun Feng, and everything else was said to be part of the second universe era.

The Unknown Lands was part of the first universe era!

When Huang Xiaolong was deep in thought, Tao Shi and the others left their cultivation abodes. When they saw Huang Xiaolong at the head of the ship, a sneer left their lips.

“Fellow cultivator Huang, you seem to be in a good mood.” Qian Shaolin scoffed.

Clasping his hands behind his back, Huang Xiaolong didn’t reply.

The look on Qian Shaolin’s face changed slightly after being ignored by Huang Xiaolong.

Even though he wasn’t as strong as Tao Shi, he was still a God of Creation at the peak of the God of Creation Realm! He was an existence ranked in the top ten position in the Eternal Heaven Alliance! No one would ever slight him like Huang Xiaolong did. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re getting too disrespectful!” Someone behind Qian Shaolin yelled.

“Disrespectful? When did a random loser get the rights to call me disrespectful?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Qian Shaolin and the others jumped in rage the moment the words left his lips.

However, Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong emerged from the interior of the ship before anyone else could say a word.

“We’re about to arrive. Make your final preparations. The Unknown Lands is extremely dangerous. We can’t be careless.” Chen Yizhen warned.

Nodding solemnly, everyone watched on as the flying ship arrived in the outskirts of the Unknown Lands.

Boom!

Piercing through the sea of clouds, the flying ship trembled violently. It was as though they ran into a universe storm.

“Raise your defenses!” Chen Yizhen yelled.

Hastily circulating their grand cosmos energy, everyone protected themselves.

“3.7 billion units of grand comos energy!” Feng Tianquan and the others were shocked to discover Huang Xiaolong’s increase in strength once again. Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong were equally as surprised.

When he entered the alliance, he only had 2.3 billion units of grand cosmos energy! When he captured Duan Jun in the Black Sea, he was reported to possess 3.3 billion! Now, he has 3.7 billion units of grand cosmos energy!”

Had he always been hiding his strength?

A light flashed in Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong’s eyes as they used their secret arts to examine Huang Xiaolong. It seemed as though his strength truly increased.

When everyone was stuck in a state of shock, they were equally as curious about Huang Xiaolong’s sudden increase in strength.

It didn’t take long for the flying ship to arrive safely in the peaceful space region of the Unknown Lands. The journey turned smooth once again.

The restrictions around the Unknown Lands were strong, and they could stop God of Creation Realm experts under the small completion stage. Even if one was a God of Creation at the small completion stage, they would need to use all their effort to break through.

After entering the Unknown Lands, AHuang Xiaolong saw countless mythical mountain ranges and giant trees that were many times the size of ordinary ones. The roaring of beasts rang incessantly in their ears.

Everything in the Unknown Lands seemed to be much larger than the items in the First Universe. Huang Xiaolong felt himself turning a little smaller in the foreign land.

The laws of space in the Unknown Space were even stronger than that in the First Universe.

With his eyes sparkling, Huang Xiaolong realized the legends about the Unknown Lands being from the first universe era.

Roar!

The roar of a beast shook the space they were in, and it was clear that countless beasts were coming their way. From the looks of it, they weren’t few in number.

“It’s a pack of wild beasts! Be careful!” Chen Yizhen yelled. “Do not kill them at all costs!”

The wild beasts pack in the Unknown Lands were part of the most dangerous creatures to roam the land. As long as one of them was killed, many more would hunt down their assailants. There was once a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage who didn’t believe in the danger and killed a beast. He was overwhelmed eventually and killed.

Lin Tong barely completed his sentence when a giant group of cow-like beasts charged at them. Their eyes were bloodshot, and Huang Xiaolong noticed a strange rune covering their body. The runes made Huang Xiaolong think about the markings on the universe sphere. The only difference was that the runes on the bodies of the beasts were much less intricate.

Everyone moved as they sealed the beasts flying towards them. They didn’t kill a single one, and they quickly left the area.

After avoiding many beast packs, they continued to make their way deeper into the Unknown Lands. Several months passed and the number of beasts they sealed was uncountable. However, there was no news about the cosmos sphere.

One day, Tao Shi approached Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong to bring up his idea of splitting up into four groups to look for the cosmos sphere.

“Four groups?” Chen Yizhen frowned.

“Yes. Leader, the Unknown Lands is too large! Looking around like this isn’t a plan… If we split into four groups, we’ll have a larger chance of locating the treasure!”
