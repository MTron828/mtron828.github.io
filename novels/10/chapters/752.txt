Ecstatic, Huang Xiaolong’s speed increased as he flew toward the source of the odd energy fluctuations.

Soon, a bright crimson sphere of fire hovering above the boiling magma came into sight, and inside it was a phoenix in flight!

A great fire phoenix with nine-colored plumes!

Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!

It was really the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!

This time, Huang Xiaolong could barely rein in the ecstasy in his heart.

One of the four divine fires, Vermilion Bird Divine Fire, he finally found it! As long as he integrated with it, his soul would evolve to another level. He absolutely could condense a rank ten and above godhead!

To what extent would his strength improve at the end?!

Unknowingly, Huang Xiaolong’s breathing grew heavy as he carefully and slowly approached the giant crimson fireball.

The nine-colored fire phoenix’s body glimmered, emitting bright glows of nine colors that exuded a sacrosanct aura.

As if the nine-colored phoenix sensed Huang Xiaolong ’s presence, it stopped flying. Then, it suddenly flapped its wings again, diving at Huang Xiaolong.

That giant crimson fireball followed the nine-colored phoenix’s movements, flying toward him as well.

Before the giant crimson fireball and the nine-colored phoenix arrived, Huang Xiaolong first felt the destructive fire element power surging at him.

He was dazed for a moment, then his face tightened in fright the next.

Just as he prepared to activate Space Concealment to dodge the giant crimson fireball, the black tortoise and snake emblem on his Black Tortoise Divine Armor flew out, winding itself around Huang Xiaolong’s body. Instead of flying away, it zoomed straight towards the nine-colored phoenix.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were wide with shock.

This...!

While Huang Xiaolong was caught in his shock, the black tortoise together with its snake tail released icy white lights like snowflakes that collided with the giant crimson fireball.

The earth-shattering collision Huang Xiaolong imagined did not take place, instead, the two forces merged together!

The Black Tortoise Divine Fire’s white snowflakes merged with the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire ’s crimson fire, growing bigger, as white and scarlet merged in harmony.

In the end, the crimson fireball and white snowflakes were all gone, turning into a golden-purple sphere!

There were hints of gold within the purple, and hints of purple within its golden light.

The huge golden-purple sphere wrapped Huang Xiaolong inside like a cocoon. The Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird hovered above Huang Xiaolong, releasing a strange force that entered his mind. Huang Xiaolong’s mind felt a jolt, then he lost consciousness.

In the last moment before he lost consciousness, Huang Xiaolong recalled the last time he integrated with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire... Was he going to sleep for a few years again this time?

The Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird continued to revolve around each other even after Huang Xiaolong lost consciousness. As the two divine fires merged, energy rippled through the magma chamber, filling the underground space with flickers of icy white and crimson red light.

The golden-purple light sphere grew increasingly bigger over time, and even more dazzling.

Both the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire’s spirits continued to release a strange force into Huang Xiaolong, and golden-purple light glimmered from the surface of his skin as his body resonated.

The Treasure Dragon diagram inside his body emerged by itself, greedily devouring this strange force, continuously improving Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique.

Time trickled by...

One day, two days...

One month, two months, in the blink of an eye, three months were gone.

In the world outside, in the Phoenix Clan headquarters’ main hall.

Huang Hongtian asked the Phoenix Clan Elder Huang Haiyuan, “Are you sure that kid hasn’t come out once in these three months after he entered the Phoenix Volcano?”

“That is so, Patriarch.” Elder Huang Haiyuan answered with surety, “Three months ago, he indeed went inside the Phoenix Volcano, and did not appear again since then!”

Surrounding the Phoenix Volcano were ancient formations arranged by the ancestors of their Phoenix Clan, which detected Huang Xiaolong entering the Phoenix Volcano.

“Patriarch, that kid hasn’t come out in three months, more likely than not he’s turned into ash by the Phoenix Volcano’s destructive fire element power!” One one the Grand Elders laughed.

Huang Hongtian nodded in agreement.

Even him, clad in their Phoenix Clan’s heritage treasure, the Phoenix Fire Armor, could barely last more than three minutes hovering close to the volcano crater. That kid was already dead for sure!

“Patriarch, that group of demonic beasts is still guarding outside, should we launch an ambush to obliterate them?” Another Phoenix Clan Grand Elder suggested.

Huang Hongtian shook his head saying, “No need, let them stay there as they like. As long as they do not take the initiative to attack us first, there’s no need to bother with them.”

“But, the thing that stripling wanted to find inside Phoenix Volcano... What could it be that made him enter the Phoenix Volcano recklessly at this time? Is there some peerless treasure at the bottom of the Phoenix Volcano?” A Grand Elder pondered out loud.

Huang Hongtian nodded, this matter was also something he had been pondering about these past few months. Thus, he decided that once the Phoenix Volcano calmed down, he would enter and investigate.

If the underground magma stopped acting up, then, with his strength and adding the Phoenix Fire Armor, he’d be able to reach five hundred zhang down the vent.

However, what depressed Huang Hongtian was the fact that the violent environment around the Phoenix Volcano continued for four years. Not once did it calm down.

In these four years, in the magma chamber of Phoenix Volcano, Huang Xiaolong remained unconscious, sleeping inside the golden-purple light sphere. Suddenly, the merging Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine spirits that were releasing a strange force burst out in a blinding light. That blinding purple light then separated into one blue and one red, drilling into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The snow-white and crimson lights around the magma chamber gradually disappeared. The giant golden-purple sphere slowly shrunk, smaller and smaller, and stopped when it reached around ten meters in diameter.

Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness slowly returned, opening his eyes.

Blue and a red lights shot out from his eyes, penetrating into the mountain wall above and creating two bottomless black holes. Two kinds of fires burned around the two openings, one icy white and the other hot crimson. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong slowly got to his feet, a little confused as he surveyed his surroundings. After a while, he quickly checked his body’s internal condition; there was a bright crimson sphere right under his heart, and inside that crimson sphere was none of other than that nine-colored phoenix!

The Vermilion Bird Divine Fire!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart raced with joy!

Just like the previous time when he integrated with the Black Tortoise Divine Fire, this time he also succeeded in integrating with the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire without really knowing what happened!

Following that, Huang Xiaolong noticed that his mid-Tenth Order God Realm cultivation that was close to advancing to peak mid-Tenth Order had jumped straight to late-Tenth Order God Realm!

As for his soul...

Every corner of his soul sea was filled with radiance, crepuscular aureate lights glimmered like sun reflected on the water surface. If Huang Xiaolong’s soul clarity before this was like a great white sun, then now, it was... two suns? Perhaps three?!
