Chapter 513: Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly Physique?

“Sovereign!”

“Liege Lord Beast God!”

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the experts under Huang Xiaolong reacted, crying out as they flew to his side from many different directions.

Deep at the bottom of the pit, Huang Xiaolong gradually recovered his ability to move. With a minuscule shake, he shook the soil off his body and flew out.

Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the others were astounded looking at the large hole on Huang Xiaolong’s torso. Blood flowed rapidly, dyeing a red blossom on his robe.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath watching his wound, for they knew how horrifying Huang Xiaolong’s physique was, yet it was pierced through by a finger!

At this time, several enraged Ten Directions Continent experts began attacking that jade-like finger.

The jade finger merely moved slightly and it reflected a horrifying white-jade glow underneath the sunlight, the several Ten Directions Continent experts’ bodies exploded before they even got close to it.

This scene was a blow to everyone on Huang Xiaolong’s side.

“All of you withdraw!” Huang Xiaolong barked a command at Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and those who prepared to attack.

Huang Xiaolong was sure that the other party was a God Realm Master! Only a God Realm Master could have such a terrifying power in just one finger, if Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, or the others went up, they would only be dying vain.

Receiving Huang Xiaolong’s stern order, Zhao Shu and all those who prepared to dash forward in attack halted their movements and retreated to the side, complying with the order.

Huang Xiaolong initiated Instant Recovery, accelerating the healing of the wound on his torso.

A surprised exclamation sounded from the sky above. Obviously, the other side did not expect Huang Xiaolong to recover so quickly after taking a hit from his finger.

Huang Xiaolong tilted his head, looking at the void above with cold eyes, both of his hands struck with the Asura Demon Claw skyward. In a radius of several li, the cries of demons’ laments filled the land.

The other side still used one finger, lightly tapping at the Asura Demon Claws, instantly shattering them midway. Space quivered violently as a silhouette enshrouded in rolling black fog appeared in the vision of everyone on the ground.

Black fog surged in silence, exuding a strong death aura. From afar, Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the other Saint realm experts felt hard to breathe despite the distance from the black fog.

“Ying Tian!” Huang Xiaolong stared at the other side coldly. No doubt, this young man shrouded in an always-present black fog was the Deities Templar’s Temple Preceptor, Ying Tian.

Ying Tian stood with his hands clasped at his back, looking at Huang Xiaolong with an expressionless face, “I didn’t expect you to have already killed your way inside in the short time I’ve been away, but it’s fine like this, saves me from making a trip.”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant calmness matched Ying Tian’s expressionless face. Black and blue twin dragon martial spirits flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, emitting the aura of an ancient Dragon God, the majestic might of a dragon enveloped the entire island. He soul transformed in a blink.

Thick dragon scales surfaced on Huang Xiaolong’s skin like a godly armor, his chest, his arms, and legs. Long sharp spikes lined the length of his legs, reflected the sunlight with a chilling glint. A tattoo-like image of the black and blue dragon heads appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s back.

His irises seemed to turn a dark golden color, sans of any emotion.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong triggered the Asura bloodline in him and a dark red energy flowed just above the layer of thick dragon scales. The combined auras of an ancient Dragon God and a Hell Asura gave everyone palpitations, unable to restrain themselves from prostrating in awe. Even Temple Preceptor Ying Tian’s eyes narrowed in a dignified manner.

A Huang Xiaolong that had soul transformed with the twin dragons martial spirits and released the suppression on his Asura bloodline actually gave him a sense of danger.

A sense of danger birthed from his heart!

However, Ying Tian remained motionless with his hands at his back, looking at Huang Xiaolong with the same expressionless face, “I admit that I have underestimated you in the past, allowing you to grow to this extent in a mere few years’ time. But, it has come to an end.” His momentum rose, his brocade robe started fluttering without wind.

What surprised Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the watching Saint realm experts was the fact that Ying Tian transformed, looking like a suet white-jade, emitting the same lustrous glow of jade.

“Little Huang brat, you need to be careful, this is the Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly Physique!” Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s reminder sounded in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

“Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly Physique?” Huang Xiaolong blanked.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi nodded as he explained, “The universe is vast, filled with countless geniuses. Some of these geniuses are born with innate heavenly physiques, and the Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly Physique is one of them, possessing formidable defense. This kid has awakened the power of the Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly Physique.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned. In short, this Ying Tian had a very strong defense.

It goes without saying that a God Realm master possessed the powerful physique of a half-God Body, that level of defense was already horrifying, close to immortal. Now, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was saying that the other side had a unique physique called Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly physique? It seemed like wanting to kill the other party would pose some difficulties.

It was at this point that Temple Preceptor Ying Tian attacked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Heaven’s Tribulation Finger!” His chilling voice rang out as his made a pointing gesture at Huang Xiaolong. When his fingers moved, puffs of gray clouds shrouded the slender suet white-jade finger. Clouds rolled in the sky, with dark purple lightning streaking in their midst, arriving in close proximity to Huang Xiaolong’s chest in a split second.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart tightened!

‘So fast!’

He keenly felt the boundless destructive power contained in this Heaven’s Tribulation Finger. If this finger attack hit him, he would end up much worse than the previous time.

Huang Xiaolong immediately retreated into a space pocket, and at the same time, he used Phantom Shadow. The Blades of Asura were already in his hands, swinging out the moves of the Asura Sword Skill.

A myriad saber lights transformed into a fierce tempest, angry rainstorm, lightning flood dragons, a thousand blossoms, winding chains, a mountain of knives and sea of fire.

Although Huang Xiaolong had yet to practice the latter ten moves of the Asura Sword Skill, he succeeded in combining and mastering the first eight moves. Every singular move he cast contained the power of the other seven moves.

And every move respectively differed from each other.

The tempest tore everything in its path, the rainstorm submerged everything beneath it, the lightning flood dragons destroying everything in their path, the red eyeball confused the enemy, while the chains shackled the enemy in place.

In a mere breath’s time, the two of them had attacked and countered more than a dozen moves.

Horrifying shockwaves blasted everywhere, scaring the experts watching below to retreat even further away. The ancient towering trees on the island exploded in splinters, disappearing as dust. Mountain peaks were sliced and crumbled by saber qi one after another, cutting deep fissures in the mountain range.

In Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the Saint realm experts’ view, they only saw two spheres of light colliding with each other again and again in high altitude, even the half-step God realm Chi Jiuyang couldn’t clearly see the moves made by the two people above.

“Is this the strength of a God Realm master?” Chi Jiuyang stared fixedly at the black sphere of light representing Temple Preceptor Ying Tian, dumbstruck with awe. But what flabbergasted him the most was Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

If this was in the past, someone telling him that a peak mid-Tenth Order Saint realm warrior could have battle strength on par with a God Realm master, he definitely would not believe it.

But now!

Everyone on the ground held their breaths, their fingers digging into their palms.

Then, Ying Tian and Huang Xiaolong separated after a powerful collision, standing at opposite ends.

Temple Preceptor Ying Tian still looked deadpan as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, however, inwardly, he was extremely shocked. Despite holding the upper hand in the short exchange just now, one mustn’t forget that he was a God Realm master that possessed the Firmament Jade Emperor Heavenly Physique. He actually couldn’t defeat a mere peak mid-Tenth Orde Saint realm within a hundred moves!

After soul transformation, whether it was strength, speed, or defense, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t any weaker than him!

“Very good!” Temple Preceptor Ying Tian observed Huang Xiaolong, “Your body’s toughness really surprised me. Since it is so, I shall give you the honor of dying under my Soul Seize Red Dust Reversal Technique.” With that said, a mysterious force bubbled forth internally from Ying Tian’s body.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils shrunk watching this; ‘Finally, he’s going to use the Soul Seize Red Dust Reversal Technique.’
