“What?!”

When the ancestors of the Asura Gate and Huang Peng heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to expel Wei Hong and Jia Ding, their expression changed.

Even the surrounding experts were all stunned.

“Presumptuous! Little kid, do you really think that just because you have a few experts under you, you can do whatever you want in my Asura Gate headquarters?” One of the Asura Gate Ancestors, Li Linwei, jumped up and yelled angrily at Huang Xiaolong.

Li Linwei was a mid-Eight Order Emperor Realm and had a pretty good relationship with Jia Ding.

“Sect Master, this person came to our Asura Gate to cause trouble, if we let him leave like this, how would the others view our Asura Gate? Even if it’s an ancestor from the Massacring Gods Gate or the Misty Palace’s Palace Master, they wouldn’t have acted so wantonly!” Another one of the Ancestors, Wang Xin, added furiously, “Sect Master, please allow me to capture all of them!”

Even though Wang Xin was a mid-First Order Emperor, he had barely managed to break into the Emperor Realm because of Jia Ding. That was also the reason he was one of Jia Ding’s supporters.

“Yes, Sect Master, we should capture them first and kill them later in order to demonstrate the prestige of our Asura Gate!” Another one of the ancestors suggested.

A few other Asura Gate ancestors voiced out their anger in succession.

Huang Xiaolong’s face was filled with indifference and he ignored all of their enraged cries.

Huang Peng raised his hands and signaled Li Linwei, Wang Xin, and the few others to calm down. His eyes throbbed with anger as he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Isn’t your request too much?”

Ren Wokuang opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but swallowed his words in the end.

Even though he hated Jia Ding to the bone and wished for nothing but to personally crush him, he knew that the Asura Gate would definitely not allow him to kill someone of Jia Ding’s status.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Peng and laughed coldly, “If Jia Ding didn’t support Wei Hong, and if he didn’t protect him, how would Wei Hong dare to harm my master? How would he have dared to torture my master for over a decade? Do you not agree that Jia Ding is the main culprit? He deserves death!”

Earlier, he had asked Huang Peng to expel Jia Ding and Wei Heng so that he could personally make a move to kill them both. After all, once they were expelled, they would no longer be protected by the Asura Gate.

Of course, he knew that it was impossible for Huang Peng to agree. However, it didn’t matter if Huang Peng agreed or disagreed. Since Huang Xiaolong had already given them a chance to uphold righteousness, they had no one to blame but themselves if they failed to cherish the chance he gave them.

The only reason he hadn’t made a move wasn’t because he was afraid of them.

After all, he was the Sect Master of the Asura Gate in the lower world, and still had some feelings left for this sect. Hence, he had wanted to give Huang Peng a chance.

Huang Peng stared at Huang Xiaolong with a frigid expression and said, “Wei Hong is a disciple of our Asura Gate, as for the matter of harming his own disciples, our Asura Gate will punish him ourselves, it isn’t something that an outsider like you should concern yourself with. I’ll give young master three minutes to leave with Ren Wokuang, otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

No matter how strong Tai Yue and the rest of them were, it was impossible for him to expel Jia Ding from the Asura Gate.

It was as Wang Xin had said, even if the ancestors of Massacring Gods Gate and Misty Palace’s Palace Master came, they wouldn’t have acted in such an unbridled manner. Why should they, the Asura Gate, be afraid of a mere Asura noble?!

Even if Tai Yue and the others were strong, he felt that as long as the Divine Tree of Darkness was present, none of them would be able to resist its attack.

Of course, the cost of using the Divine Tree of Darkness would be enormous and unless it concerned the life and death of the sect, there was no way they would activate it.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, and a trace of coldness flashed past it.

He could understand the underlying meaning behind Huang Peng’s words. He was allowed to bring his master, Ren Wokuang, away, but Wang Mengqin had to stay to complete the wedding ceremony with Wei Hong.

As for both Wei Hong and Jia Ding, they would not be punished!

Ren Wokuang’s face changed as he looked at Wang Mengqin with an expression full of worry. It was too bad that she had already been detained by one of the grand elders.

“Senior!” Ren Wokuang said anxiously to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at him and gave an reassuring look. He knew what he had to do and he simply waved towards Tai Yue.

“Yes, Master.” Tai Yue bowed respectfully and immediately broke through the sky and arrived in front of Wang Mengqin.

“Presumptuous!”

At this time, a group of people shouted and rose from the platform below and charged towards Tai Yue and the rest. Of course, they were none other than Li Linwei and the other ancestors advocating for Huang Xiaolong to be captured.

Amongst the six, four of them were late stage Emperors, and the other two were Sixth Order Emperors.

From their point of view, no matter how strong Tai Yue was, their combined strength would be more than enough to suppress him.

Boom!

The entire mountain peak trembled violently, and frightening air currents swept through the surrounding. Some of the elders and disciples standing nearer to the scene of the explosion were sent flying away mercilessly.

Under the horrified gazes of everyone present, Li Linwei and the five of them spat out mouthfuls of blood as they smashed into the distant mountain.

In the next moment, the mountains they crashed into crumbed to dust.

“What?!”

Everyone was dumbfounded when they watched the scene play out before them.

Hadn’t he already revealed his full strength when fighting Chu Yunnan?!

Huang Peng soon awoke from his senses and shouted furiously, “Set up the Asura Reincarnation Array!”

The Asura’s Reincarnation Array was an inheritance of the Asura Gate, and it was the strongest array they had in their arsenal.

Huang Peng took the lead and flew towards the sky and the remaining ancestors followed behind him. Even Chu Yunnan, Li Linwei, and the others followed behind him. A total of forty four Emperor Realm experts formed a circle in the sky above Huang Xiaolong and the four Great Commanders.

As Huang Peng and the rest of them formed seals with their hands, mysterious runes appeared one after another. A terrifying aura started to fill the area.

A grave expression appeared on Tai Yue’s face when he looked at Huang Peng and the rest in the sky above them.

By the time they formed the circle in the sky, Fan Hui had already rescued Wang Mengqin and had retreated far away with Huang Xiaolong and Ren Wokuang.

“Ignore me and go help Tai Yue.” Huang Xiaolong instructed.

“Yes, Master!”

Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, and Wan Yutian’s figure flashed and they appeared beside Tai Yue in an instant.

The four of them stopped concealing their aura, and released it completely.

When the various experts who were hiding in the distance sensed the terrifying aura coming out from the four of them, their complexions changed drastically.

“Are those four... four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors?!” The Lifeless Sect Ancestor, Xu Junhua exclaimed in shock.

None of the other ancestors could be sure, but they gasped in shock when Xu Junhua revealed the information about their strength.
