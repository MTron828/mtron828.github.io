Chapter 2894: Yin Yue’s Request

Even though Li Xue forbade them from guessing Huang Xiaolong’s identity, speculations started to spread throughout most of the powers in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

There were some who said that Huang Xiaolong was like those from the Mystical Pavilion and that they were not people from the Huang Long World. On the other hand, there were some who said that Huang Xiaolong was a spirit of genesis. Moreover, he was said to be one of the strongest among them! There were rumors that he had just awakened with frightening talent, enough to rival the strongest of geniuses!

There were even some who said that he was the incarnation of a supreme expert at the peak of late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong’s reputation started to spread through the Divine Tuo Holy World at an astounding speed.

In the past, everyone had felt that he could only rely on the Immemorial Qilins to defeat his enemies. They finally realized how wrong they were.

The Blue Lotus Creed had once passed down an order to capture Huang Xiaolong in order to please the Dragon Fish Creed. However, they acted the exact same way like the Ten Swords Creed had done after the battle in Monarch Yu Sacred Land. In the span of a day, the bounty on Huang Xiaolong’s head had disappeared, and no one was allowed to speak of it.

In a desperate attempt to avoid retaliation from the monster that was Huang Xiaolong, Lin Rui, the Blue Lotus Dao Venerable, personally passed down the order to punish Yang Jia by locking him up for a hundred thousand years!

The matter where Yang Jia was beaten to a pulp by Huang Xiaolong was completely forgotten as Lin Rui refused to speak of it.

When Xuanyuan Potian arrived, Yang Jia and the others openly mocked Huang Xiaolong. Even though Huang Xiaolong had kicked them half to death, all of them were severely punished by their factions the moment they returned. With the exception of Yang Jia who was imprisoned for a hundred thousand years, the others were thrown out without exception!

As if they were afraid that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t find out, the Tempest Lightning Creed announced to the entire world that Xu Xiaofeng would be expelled from the creed! It didn’t matter that his master pleaded for mercy on his behalf as the decision was made by the Tempest Lightning Patriarch himself!

Several days passed in the blink of an eye…

In the Dragon Emperor Manor in the Dragon Emperor Continent…

Huang Xiaolong hovered in mid air as he looked at the starry skies above.

After the brawl with Yong Luosheng and Bi Ye, Monarch Yu Sacred Land was basically left in shambles. Luckily for him, the restrictions he had laid down in the past had prevented the Dragon City in the Dragon Emperor Continent from falling. Other than some superficial damage, it was completely functional.

Ever since returning, Huang Xiaolong had remained in the Dragon Emperor Manor to comprehend the grand dao. The blue lotus nectar he had received in the past was used to aid in his cultivation.

When Long Jianfei and the others came to him with news that the Ten Swords Creed had canceled the reward on his head, he didn’t give half a sh*t. The only thing he cared about was entering the Dragon Fish Creed!

If he couldn’t enter the Dragon Fish Creed, he wouldn’t be able to obtain the Huang Long Armor! He had been racking his brains for the past few days, but he had failed to find an answer.

After obtaining the armor and refining the Huang Long blood essence inside it, he would definitely be able to enter the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm! When that happened, the second world that formed in his body would finally solidify and produce a frighteningly large amount of cosmos energy! Even if he were to run into Sixth Esteem Dao Venerables after that, he would have nothing to fear!

He had gained a better understanding of his strength after his fight with Bi Ye.

He knew that if he used everything he had, he would be able to battle against a mid-Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable. If a Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable were to turn up, he would be defeated.

As such, he needed to enter the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm as quickly as he could! He desperately needed the cosmos energy produced by his second world!

While he was stuck deep in his thoughts, Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng flew towards him. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Your Highness!” The three of them bowed as soon as they approached.

Nodding his head, he started to ask about matters regarding the Long Family.

Laughing excitedly, Long Jianfei told Huang Xiaolong about how everyone in his family had managed to recover. They were planning to visit Huang Xiaolong to thank him.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response.

“Your Highness, Young Lady Feng Yue and Yin Yue are at the city gates. They are hoping you would grant them a visit. Do you think…” Duan Feng asked cautiously.

Since he had activated all the formations around the city, visitors could only remain outside the city gates.

Feng Yue? Yin Yue?

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback for a moment, but he agreed eventually.

“Alright, let them in.”

He knew that they were definitely there for a reason, and he wondered if they were there because of the oath they had made in the past.

In the past, the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World had sworn that they would only accept dao partners with eleven high-order Saint Fates. If they were there for that… Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned a little strange when he thought about it.

Long Jianfei and the others soon brought the ladies to Huang Xiaolong.

The high-level Dao Venerable, Elder Tong, followed a fair distance behind them.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the two beauties, he couldn’t feel even a shred of excitement. He welcomed them without revealing his identity.

The two ladies could feel that he wasn’t putting on airs when he greeted them, and they felt a little more at ease.

After chatting at the entrance of the mansion, Huang Xiaolong quickly invited them in.

As soon as they entered the inner palace of the Dragon Emperor Manor, the two ladies started to hesitate as they thought about what they wanted to say.

“Young Lady Feng Yue, Young Lady Yin Yue, do you have something on your mind?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The two of them stared at each other and saw the determination in their eyes. Parting her lips, Yin Yue broke the awkward silence. “Truth be told, Young Master Huang, my mother was affected by a special poison several tens of thousands of years ago. I have been searching for the antidote since then, and I have consulted with many experts. I am unable to cure her, and according to a senior, the poison in her body can only be cured by someone who controls the absolute blaze. They would have to use the power of absolute blaze along with their cosmos energy in order to drive the poison out of her body.”

“As such…” Yin Yue stopped and she didn’t continue.

Huang Xiaolong received a bout of enlightenment in that instant.

As it turned out, she needed him to save her mother!

“Young Master Huang, you can rest assured I will agree to any requests as long as you manage to cure her!” Yin Yue couldn’t help but continue when she saw that Huang Xiaolong was keeping silent.

In the past tens of thousands of years, she had been desperately looking for someone who fit the criteria. Those who could control the absolute blaze in the Divine Tuo Holy World could be counted on one hand, but they were either hiding from the world or missing. She couldn’t locate them at all! Huang Xiaolong’s appearance had given her a sense of hope.

However, the way she put it was a little ambiguous, and she quickly followed up, “I mean to say that I will be able to give you any grand dao pill or grand dao spiritual vein you want!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his arm and replied, “Young Lady Yin Yue, you don’t have to worry. Saving her is nothing more than a simple gesture, there’s no need for any compensation!”

?!

Yin Yue stared at him in shock.

Feng Yue was taken aback as well. In order to dispel the poison, Huang Xiaolong would require a large amount of cosmos energy! However, he said that he was willing to do it for free!

“But… I have something that I wish Young Lady Yin Yue could help me with.”

The two of them were startled.

As she clenched her jaws, Yin Yue expected the worst. “Please tell me your request.”

As she wondered about what he wanted her to give in return, Huang Xiaolong responded, “I’m planning to enter the Dragon Fish Creed in a bit. I wonder if Young Lady Yin Yue has a way to make that happen?”
