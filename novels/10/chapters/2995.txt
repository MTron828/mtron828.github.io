Chapter 2996: I Will Personally Avenge Feng Xue!

As the experts of the various races talked about the outcome Huang Xiaolong would face, a group of experts riding on Giant Radiant Elephants was rushing towards the Six Vision Sacred Land. They were the experts sent by the Radiant Winged Dragon Race to assist the Coiled Dragon Race, and the two leading the charge were old ancestors of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race themselves! They were both Eighth Esteem Dao Venerables, and they were no weaklings!

“Ao Shiming and the others should have already arrived. I wonder if they managed to take the youngster down…” Ao Ming, one of the old ancestors of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, chuckled.

“Brother Ao Ming, you can relax. With the nine of them working together and with the presence of the Coiled Dragon Flying Ship, nothing can go wrong!” The other old ancestor, Ao Shuyu, laughed.

Ao Mong nodded, and he felt as though his worries were unfounded. When he thought about Ao Dong, he sighed softly, “It’s a pity… The sixth young lady will have to suffer from this!”

Ao Dong was engaged to the sixth young lady of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, and they were planning to get married the next year. No one would have thought that a random stranger would kill him!

“Yeah… The sixth young lady cried for several days when she heard the news.” Ao Shuyu shook his head and sighed, “Ao Dong was too rash. Before investigating the brat’s identity, he made a move just to impress Feng Xue.”

“It’s too late to say any more…” Ao Ming said, but his transmission symbol trembled slightly. Then, after reading the contents of the report, he stopped his beast in mid-air as a look of fear formed on his face.

“What’s the matter?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As he looked at Ao Shuyu, Ao Ming sucked in a cold breath and muttered, “Something big happened.” He passed his transmission symbol over to Ao Shuyu after speaking.

“What? The Coiled Dragon Flying Ship was destroyed?! Everyone in the Coiled Dragon Race died there?! The black tortoise is a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, and it crushed them all with its shell!” Ao Shuyu stammered as a look of disbelief formed on his face. The disciples of Radiant Winged Dragon Race had sent the report, and it contained the latest update of the battle.

When the experts standing behind them heard the news, they were shocked.

In an instant, the air around them seemed to turn still.

“Who… Who is that kid?!” Ao Shuyu couldn’t bring himself to accept the news, and he asked once again. “He’s a mere Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, and he’s only at the early stage! How can a beast at that level be sent to protect him?!”

The look in Ao Ming’s eyes turned serious, and he shook his head. “The kid’s identity is no longer important.” The Coiled Dragon Race and the Radiant Winged Dragon Race had been long-standing partners, and now that the Coiled Dragon Race was facing extermination from a third party, they had to make a move to save them! Otherwise, the Radiant Winged Dragon Race would turn into a laughing stock in the Holy Dragon World!

Regardless of the other party’s identity, the Radiant Winged Dragon Race had to make a move.

When Ao Ming reported the matter to the headquarters of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, he received a reply instantly.

“The patriarch ordered us to stay put. He will personally appear to deal with the matter.” Ao Ming was shocked when he read the reply.

In contrast, Ao Shuyu revealed an expression of excitement. “That’s great! If the patriarch is making a move, nothing will go wrong!”

…

Several days later...

The light around Huang Xiaolong’s body started to fade as he slowly got to his feet.

He had gained a lot after his meditation, and if he could describe it, Huang Xiaolong would say that he had transformed completely as a person. He might look like an early-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, but he was no longer the same early-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable he once was.

In the past, his Grandmist Parasitic Medium had remained at the thirteenth level, and it wasn’t considered a type of grand dao art. He couldn’t utilize the power of his Huang Long Bloodline when unleashing it, but his meditation on the Soaring Dragon Terrace changed everything. He had comprehended the Soaring Dragon Art left behind by Huang Long himself!

The Soaring Dragon Art was a creation-level technique, and it was made for his Huang Long Bloodline specifically! In the future, he would be able to strengthen the power of his bloodline by training in the technique, and his combat prowess would be greatly strengthened if he activated his bloodline with the Soaring Dragon Art.

When he had used the power of the bloodline in the past, the golden dragon would hover behind him, with no way of fusing with his physical body. After learning the Soaring Dragon Art, he would be able to integrate the golden dragon into himself! He would be able to show off the might of the true Huang Long Body!

In addition, he would be able to refine the grand cosmos energy of the Huang Long World after learning the technique. His speed of cultivation would rise to an unimaginable level, and with the tempering of the grand cosmos energy produced by the Huang Long World, his fleshy body would reach a new level of strength!

Sweeping his gaze across the lands, Huang Xiaolong noticed the golden mist drifting around the Six Vision Sacred Land. He knew that the blood mist belonged to Ao Shiming and the others, and the aftermath of the battle could still be clearly seen after several days.

Looking at the members of the White Dragon Race and Blood Dragon Race who were staring at him from a distance, a weird light flashed in his eyes. When they noticed his gaze, their hearts started to pound rapidly as they stared at each other with a look of doubt in their eyes.

“Is he planning to escape?” An old ancestor from the White Dragon Race guessed.

“He might not be able to! I’ve heard that the patriarch of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race is planning to make a move, and he’s rushing here with the experts of his race as we speak! That’s not all… Feng Nana of the Heavenly Phoenix Race gathered the experts of her race, and they are currently rushing over to our Holy Dragon World. Rumors are going around that the patriarch of the Heavenly Phoenix Race plans on following her in case she runs into any trouble!” Ao Bi muttered. “If I were him, I would try to escape before they arrive. Whether he manages to escape is a whole other thing…”

Huang Xiaolong heard what they said, but he didn’t care if the Radiant Winged Dragon Race Patriarch and the Heavenly Phoenix Patriarch planned to move against him. He commanded the Tortoise Ancestor to head towards the headquarters of the Holy Dragon Race immediately.

He had learned that his father had left behind a Dragon Blood Stele in the Holy Dragon World, and he planned to retrieve it!

The Blood Dragon Stele was crafted by Huang Long himself, and it might not have been a creation artifact, but it was comparable to one! There was an independent space contained in the stele, and it contained treasures left behind by Huang Xiaolong’s father!

The Blood Dragon Stele was obtained by the Holy Dragon Race in the past, and he planned to retrieve it for himself!

Of course, he also needed to pay a visit to the Devil Essence Holy Dragon Ancestor in the process. He wanted to obtain the Huang Long Cape from Huang Shuai, and he also wanted to settle the grudges he had with the old dragon after he killed so many people related to Huang Xiaolong.

Since Huang Xiaolong didn’t order the Tortoise Ancestor to hide his strength, they traveled through nearly half the Holy Dragon World in two days to arrive at the headquarters of the Holy Dragon Race.

As soon as he arrived, Feng Nana of the Heavenly Phoenix Race led the experts of her race towards the Holy Dragon Race. After taking revenge for her sworn sister, Feng Xue, she wanted to obtain the blood dragon qi contained in the Blood Dragon Stele to assist her breakthrough to the Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

“Young Patriarch, the patriarch is rushing over as we speak. He will take two days to arrive in the Holy Dragon World.” One of the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables of the Heavenly Phoenix Race reported.

Feng Nana shook her head and snorted, “Father is making too large of a fuss. Even if the tortoise is a late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, all of you will be more than enough to take it down.”

“Even so, we should be careful.” Feng Chentai, the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable, muttered.

“As soon as we run into them, all of you will deal with the beast. I will personally avenge Feng Xue, and I will kill that b*stard!”
