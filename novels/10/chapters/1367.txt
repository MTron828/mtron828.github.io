“You all wait outside.” Huang Xiaolong said to Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest.

Zhu Yi had only given permission for the little cow to enter the Fortune Divine Kingdom in the past, therefore, Huang Xiaolong did not wish to break the Fortune Gate’s rules by bringing others to Fortune Divine Kingdom with him.

“Yes, Master!” Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and others complied respectfully.

Thus, Xiang Xun and the rest waited for Huang Xiaolong to return at the entrance of the Fortune Divine Kingdom, whereas Huang Xiaolong and the little stepped into the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong entered the Fortune Divine Kingdom, he could immediately feel two sources of powerful divine senses locked onto him and the little cow. He sneered inwardly when he determined sources of these two divine senses.

One was Zhu Yi, and the other was that old hag Black Ice.

More or less he could guess why their divine senses were locked onto him. It seems like Zhu Feng’s quite efficient, he has already reported the matter to his father Zhu Yi in such a short time.

The little cow flew leisurely into the Assembly God Shrine with Huang Xiaolong on her back.

In the meanwhile, Black Ice Ancestor harrumphed coldly at Blood Knife Ancestor inside the Assembly God Shrine as soon as she sensed Huang Xiaolong inside the Fortune Divine Kingdom. “Your disciple is at least not stupid since he has decided to surrender. He at least knows that he cannot escape, and if he were to escape then one more crime would have been added to his name!!”

Blood Knife Ancestor’s face sank. “Old hag Black Ice, it would be wiser of you to not utter another word, or I might act impulsively and split your ‘below’ into two!”

Puff! Lightning Hammer Ancestor was the first to crack, while Sky Sword Ancestor had a strange expression on his face.

Black Ice Ancestor shrieked several octaves higher, “Blood Knife, I’ll fight you to the death today!”

The airflow in the hall turned violent and frigid cold in the blink of an eye, masking the whole Assembly God Shrine under a layer of thick grayish green ice. The whole world was cocooned by frigid coldness.

Blood Knife Ancestor retorted loudly, “Come on, let’s fight, who’s afraid of you!” High waves of blood-red energy soared to the sky.

“Enough, stop!” A burst of golden light from Golden Brow Ancestor’s body flashed in the hall, dispersing the frigid cold air and blood-red energy waves.

Black Ice Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor both leaped back simultaneously.

“Is it right for you two to bicker day in day out? Are you even upholding your images as ‘Ancestors’ with such behavior?!” Golden Brow Ancestor snapped, “What are the disciples going to think of your unruly behaviors?!”

Black Ice Ancestor grunted curtly, but did not say anything to retort him.

Blood Knife Ancestor converged his surging blood knife qi, and kept silent.

Silence returned to the hall.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong calmly entered the hall on the little cow, as she strolled in lazily.

The moment Black Ice Ancestor saw Huang Xiaolong, she immediately jumped out and started reprimanding him, “Huang Xiaolong, Zhu Feng has informed us that you induced your subordinates to heavily injure the headquarters’ He Fang and Chen Xuguang. Speak! Are you aware that your actions are equivalent to a rebellion and a massacre of brethren that deserves a severe punishment of dying a thousand times?!”

Rebellion!

A massacre of brethren!

Black Ice Ancestor had passed her judgement of punishing Huang Xiaolong with a death penalty as soon as she had seen him. Not to mention, she hadn’t even bothered to hear his side of the story.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered with coldness, and he ignored Black Ice Ancestor. He respectfully faced Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, and saluted. “Masters, you summoned me back urgently, so is there some kind of emergency?”

Anger exploded in Black Ice Ancestor’s heart since Huang Xiaolong had ignored her. Her palm struck out faster than she could think.

But before her palm could strike Huang Xiaolong, Blood Knife Ancestor’s knife qi blocked it.

Blood Knife Ancestor glanced coldly at Black Ice Ancestor as he said, “Old hag Black Ice, do you really want me to fork you below till it’s split?!”

She retorted furiously, “As an Ancestor of the Fortune Gate’s branch, you’re well aware of the rules, but you still favor your disciple?! Once the headquarters’ Elder comes, you two won’t be able to escape death penalty!”

Blood Knife Ancestor rolled his eyes and snorted, “Death penalty? We must have committed a big crime... I am so scared!”

Zhu Yi interjected, “Blood Knife Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong is your disciple, and your disciple has broken the sect’s rules. Not just that, you are being biased and playing favorites since he is your personal disciple. Your action is inappropriate, don’t you agree?”

In Zhu Yi’s opinion, since Huang Xiaolong had induced his subordinates to injure He Fang and Chen Xuguang, it was a heavy crime. And it was a great mistake on Blood Knife Ancestor’s part for continuously overlooking Huang Xiaolong’s mistakes.

In the meanwhile, Golden Brow Ancestor looked at Huang Xiaolong, and his eyes widened in astonishment as he exclaimed, “Xiaolong, you, you’ve broken through to Ancestor God Realm?!”

Zhu Yi, Black Ice Ancestor, and the others couldn’t see it, but Golden Brow Ancestor could detect the difference in Huang Xiaolong.

Black Ice Ancestor blanked, and then she was shocked.

“What? An-Ancestor God Realm!” Blood Knife Ancestor stammered.

When Huang Xiaolong had left twenty years ago, his cultivation was just at peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, whereas now, he had actually broken through to Ancestor God Realm?!

He very much wanted to ask if Golden Brow had made a mistake?

Zhu Yi, Black Ice Ancestor, and the other Ancestors were also doubtful.

“Yes, Big Master, your disciple was lucky enough to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm some days ago.” Huang Xiaolong honestly answered Golden Brow Ancestor.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s answer, Zhu Yi and the Ancestors sucked in a breath of cold air, and their eyes widened with shock.

He really broke through to Ancestor God Realm!

This...!

This talent! How many years did Wang Wei take to breakthrough to Ancestor God Realm? More than a thousand years?

They had never heard of cultivation speed like Huang Xiaolong’s!

“Masters, why did you summon me back so urgently?” Huang Xiaolong ignored the others and asked Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

Just as Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were about to tell Huang Xiaolong regarding Li Lu’s situation, Black Ice Ancestor snapped all of a sudden, “Huang Xiaolong, even if you’re an Ancestor God Realm now, it still doesn’t change the fact that you induced your subordinates to injure He Fang and Chen Xuguang. And it is still a crime that requires the punishment of a death penalty! Where are your three high-level Ancestor God Realm subordinates? Why aren’t you telling them to surrender?!”

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze fell on Black Ice Ancestor. “You really want me to call them here?”

“That’s right, tell them to roll in here!” Black Ice Ancestor screamed, “If they were to escape, then your crime will only get heavier!”

Huang Xiaolong spoke nonchalantly, “Since you want them to come in, I will have them come in.” With that said, he contacted Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest to proceed to the Assembly God Shrine.

Xiang Xun and the rest stepped over and passed through the passageway into the Fortune Divine Kingdom after receiving Huang Xiaolong’s orders and flew straight towards the Assembly God Shrine.

Soon, Xiang Xun’s group reached the Assembly God Shrine.

Black Ice Ancestor turned and glared at Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the others the moment they stepped into the hall.

“Are you Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates; his so-called slaves?! Which one of you injured He Fang and Chen Xuguang?!” Black Ice Ancestor barked.

Slaves? Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er frowned faintly.

“It was me, but...” Before Gui Yi could explain that it was He Fang who had first attacked Huang Xiaolong, Black Ice Ancestor cut him off as she shouted, “It’s you! Then surrender, I’ll abolish your cultivation first!” Ice formed over her palms and struck Gui Yi.

Layers of frigid cold air spread out and enshrouded Gui Yi.

Ice crept up Gui Yi’s body.

As Gui Yi was seconds away from turning into an ice sculpture, he slightly shook for a second; Ghost qi surged forth with howling ghosts as Gui Yi condensed nether ghost energy, and met with Black Ice Ancestor’s palms. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Rumble~!

In front of Zhu Yi and the others’ eyes, the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm Black Ice Ancestor staggered back several times from the collision until she reached a corner of the hall.
