Emerging from Huang Xiaolong’s body, with the City of Eternity, were the one hundred Undead puppet Netherguards. Driven by these one hundred Undead puppet Netherguards, the City of Eternity emitted glaring lights that eclipsed everything else in the world.

Boom!

Without any resistance, the City of Eternity rammed into the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor Dai Quan.

Dai Quan screamed miserably in pain. The City of Eternity shattered the low-grade grandmist divine armor on him, then his whole body’s bones, meridians and veins, internal organs, and everything else ruptured into an unrecognizable mess.

Only a piece of godhead remained intact.

A supreme rank godhead!

An unprecedented power erupted from Dai Quan’s supreme godhead. Violent godforce soared skyward, breaking to outer space.

Huang Xiaolong snorted with disdain watching this.

Just as Dai Quan’s supreme godhead broke out in power, trying to make a run for it by tearing through the void, the City of Eternity appeared above the godhead. Under one hundred Undead puppet Netherguards’ power, the overbearing City of Eternity smashed down.

A thunderous boom shook the air as Dai Quan’s godhead was smashed deep into the ground, accompanied by Dai Quan’s heart-rendering scream before he died. Following this was complete silence.

Suddenly, there was another boom! Huang Xiaolong turned to look and saw the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor Chen Nengtong, and the other three Ancestors were trying to make a run for it, bringing Shi Yinyu and Yang Jing.

However, they had barely flown far when all of them were rebounded back by an invisible energy wall.

This invisible energy wall emitted powerful light energy when it repelled Shi Yinyu’s group. Runes appeared above them, forming a group of angels.

Chen Nengtong, Shi Yinyu, and the rest looked at the energy wall that blocked their escape in confusion, ‘this is...?!’

Their expressions drew a harsh sneer from Huang Xiaolong.

Before Yang Sihai had led these people here, Huang Xiaolong had ordered the two fourteen-winged peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Radiance Angels to arrange a radiant light element ancient grand array formation here.

Even if Shi Wushuang were here, he wouldn’t be able to detect this radiant light energy’s ancient grand array until it was too late. The moment Shi Yinyu and the others had entered this grand array formation; their fates had been sealed.

With the grand array formation’s wall barrier, Huang Xiaolong was not worried about Shi Ming or Shi Wushuang discovering what was happening here.

Even if he punched a hole through the mainland within this grand array formation, no shockwaves would spread outside.

Rumble!

Chen Nengton took out a giant blade and slashed at the radiant barrier with everything in his possession. The barrier emitted a burst of flaring light, sending Chen Nengtong staggering back miserably. Blood was flowing out from the corner of his mouth.

Shi Yinyu panicked, seeing this result. The fear of death wound over his limbs and body, pulling him down an icy abyss.

Huang Xiaolong walked to Shi Yinyu at a leisurely pace and said in a tepid tone, “No need to waste your efforts within this grand array formation. Even Shi Wushuang’s attacks would be useless here, not to mention the likes of you.”

As Huang Xiaolong approached Shi Yinyu, the fear in Yang Jing’s heart intensified. She subconsciously stepped back in fear.

“Duwei, what do you want to do exactly?” Shi Yinyu demanded with false courage as he moved back warily, “My Old Ancestor is right on this Corpse Soul Land. Do you really have the guts to kill me?!”

Chen Nengtong and the other two Ancestors were protecting Shi Yinyu and did not dare to act rashly.

About ten meters from Shi Yinyu’s group, Huang Xiaolong stopped. His hand made a gesture in the air, and the City of Eternity flew up from the ground. Dai Quan’s godhead seized the chance and flew out from the deep pit in the ground.

But the force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm caught Dai Quan’s godhead and brought it in front of him. The devouring power of his Archdevil Supreme Godhead roared. In the next instant, Dai Quan’s godhead shriveled at an incredible speed, withering like a red blossom in drought, losing its vitality and luster.

Soft but crisp breaking noises sounded, then Dai Quan’s godhead turned into dust and disappeared from the world.

Shi Yinyu turned paler by the second, watching Huang Xiaolong swallowed the godforce inside Dai Quan’s godhead. This sight reminded him of what had happened above the Nethersea. The scene where Huang Xiaolong had devoured Song Litao’s godhead seemed to replay in his mind once again.

“No, I don’t want to die; you cannot kill me. I, Shi Yinyu, am a king of supreme godhead genius, I can’t die! I definitely would break through to Emperor Realm, surpass the Emperor Realm, and walk my kingly path. I cannot die like this!” Shi Yinyu suddenly shouted like a madman, and his face was hideously distorted.

“Impossible!” Shi Yinyu cried out hoarsely. His eyes were crimson and contained boundless unwillingness and hatred.

Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong harrumphed coldly, “King of supreme godhead genius won’t die? What a joke! Go against me; regardless of who you are, the ending is only death—like Song Litao and you, even Shi Ming is no exception! Too bad you won’t be able to see the day I destroy the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, then again, don’t worry, I won’t kill you now.”

Everyone was shocked.

“... You won’t kill me now?” Shi Yinyu’s eyes turned around.

As long as this Duwei didn’t kill him, there was hope.

Seeing Shi Yinyu’s expression, Huang Xiaolong more or less guessed what was going through Shi Yinyu’s mind and sneered inwardly. He raised his fist and punched out abruptly.

Yang Jing shrieked sharply. Her body was hurled backwards from Huang Xiaolong’s fist force and exploded into a group of blood mist.

“No!” Shi Yinyu cried out in despair. He looked dazedly at the blood mist falling to the ground, but he turned suddenly, glaring gloomily at Huang Xiaolong and cursed, “Duwei, you bast*rd, you broke your promise!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Broke my promise? You are mistaken. I only said I wouldn’t kill you.”

“Kill!” Chen Nengtong and the other two Ancestors’ godforce erupted and attacked Huang Xiaolong at the same time.

But the City of Eternity promptly rushed up to the three.

Simultaneously, the Heavenly Hall appeared right above the three people’s head, and the hexagon rune pillar condensed.

Chen Nengtong and the other two Ancestors’ eyes widened in fear as a dazzling light burst out from the hexagon rune pillar.

In the next moment, Chen Nengtong and the two Ancestors lost consciousness.

Shi Yinyu was dazed as he watched Huang Xiaolong kill Chen Nengtong and the other two Ancestors. His indignant rage, hatred, and killing intent receded faster than the tide.

He stood stiffly, and his mind blanked.

Huang Xiaolong ignored his reaction and walked to Shi Yinyu’s side.

“Duwei, if I live through this, there will be a day when I make you wish you were dead instead.” Shi Yinyu came to his senses and spat with roiling hatred.

Huang Xiaolong laughed nonchalantly, “Unfortunately, you will never have the chance in this lifetime. By the way, I forgot to tell you, my real name is not Duwei.”

Shi Yinyu froze before he managed to squeeze out, “Your name is not Duwei?”

Huang Xiaolong’s outer appearance changed again at this time, turning into a black-haired human race young man. Shi Yinyu’s face turned even uglier at this sight.

A human?!

“My real name is Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong stated.

Shi Yinyu’s mind raced, and his eyes widened. He pointed a trembling finger at Huang Xiaolong as he stammered, “Y-you, you, you’re the Divine World’s Huang-Huang Xiaolong?! Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son?!”

This time, it was Huang Xiaolong who was stupefied for a second. Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son?! He smiled wryly inside, it seems there were quite a lot of people that thought he was Senior Brother Jiang Hong’s illegitimate son.

The Divine World’s strongest Emperor’s illegitimate son? Huang Xiaolong really didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with any more talks. He ordered one of the puppet Netherguards to suppress Shi Yinyu’s soul. With a wave of his hand, a grandmist worm flew out from his finger into Shi Yinyu’s forehead to control him.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
