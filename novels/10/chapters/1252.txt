In the last three years, Cheng Susu had been exploring outside the Fortune Gate, and had just returned to the Fortune Gate earlier on the day when the Fortune Gate’s group returned. Therefore, she wasn’t aware of the All-Islands Great War and the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle results.

Even though more than a decade had passed, Cheng Susu recognized Huang Xiaolong immediately.

However, it was a big surprise to Cheng Susu that Huang Xiaolong was following behind the Fortune Gate’s Ancestors?!

‘What was going on?!’ Cheng Susu pulled a female disciple standing beside her and asked urgently, “Junior Sister Zhe Wei, can I ask who that black-haired young man is? That one behind Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor?”

Cheng Susu never thought Zhe Wei would look sideways at her like she was an idiot as she replied, “You actually don’t know who he is?!” Glittering stars shone in her eyes as she looked at Huang Xiaolong again, “He’s Huang Xiaolong, my precious little darling!”

Precious little darling??!

Cheng Susu looked at the female disciple’s dark freckled face and her completely out of shape body, and suddenly a wave of nausea hit her. But she managed to endure it and urged, “I know his name is Huang Xiaolong, but I am asking about his identity to be specific.” Afraid that the female disciple would misunderstand, she quickly explained, “I have been training outside for the last few years, so I don’t know about the current events and other things, including some people’s identities.”

The female disciple finally understood Cheng Susu’s curiosity. She answered, “No wonder you don’t even know my precious little darling Long Long! Then you also must not know that my Little Long Long is our Fortune Gate’s All-Island Great War first place, do you?”

Precious little darling Long Long? But the latter part of Zhe Wei’s words sounded like a thunderclap in Cheng Susu’s mind.

What?! All-Islands Great War first place! First place—!

More than a decade ago, when Huang Xiaolong had saved Cheng Susu from the Soul Tribe, she was not very confident that he could even enter the top ten thousand rankings, yet the same Huang Xiaolong actually had won first place in the All-Islands Great War!

The female disciple continued, “Later on, our Little Long Long was accepted as a personal disciple by Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.”

Accepted as a personal disciple by Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor?! Another thunderclap shook Cheng Susu’s mind.

No wonder Huang Xiaolong could follow behind Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor!

All of a sudden, Cheng Susu thought of a very important question and blurted out, “Does that mean he is an emperor rank godhead genius?”

“Of course it’s a given!” The female disciple affirmed proudly, “My Little Long Long has the high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead, moreover, it is a variant Five Elements Godhead!” Her facial expressions were proud and smug, as if Huang Xiaolong was hers.

“Furthermore, in this term’s Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle, Little Long Long not only defeated the Dark Elf Mainland All-Islands Great War’s first place genius You Wuxin, but also defeated the Eternal Mainland All-Island Great War’s first place Wangu Ziyi, and won first place!” The female disciple added, “Look, even our Gate Chief personally came out to welcome them back!”

Cheng Susu was dumbfounded with her mouth agape.

A variant high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead!

The Dark Elf Mainland and Eternal Mainland’s All-Island Great War first place genius disciples were defeated by Huang Xiaolong?! By now, her mind was scrambled into a paste, and there were mixed feelings in her gaze as she looked strangely at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong who was walking behind Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor was surprised as he spotted Cheng Susu in the crowd. He then nodded and smiled at Cheng Susu.

It had been three years since he became a Fortune Gate disciple, but this was the first time he had come across Cheng Susu within the span of these three years.

The female disciple beside Cheng Susu covered her mouth with her hand and screamed sharply when she saw that Huang Xiaolong was smiling and nodding in their direction. “Heavens, my Little Long Long looked at me just now, he looked at me, he looked at me and smiled!”

She was so excited that her fleshy body was quivering.

Other female disciples around Cheng Susu were also shrieking and screaming.

Huang Xiaolong quickly looked away, frightened, as he hadn’t expected such a reaction from these several other female disciples.

Li Lu’s lips pressed into a smile, "It seems that you’re quite popular..." Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong smiled, "I think you are more popular than I am, right?" His gaze fell on the male disciples who were staring fixedly at Li Lu. Their eyes almost fell out from their sockets.

Li Lu wanted to refute him, but the expressions on those male disciples made her unable to refute.

"Several Ancestors, welcome back." Zhu Yi greeted Golden Brow Ancestor and the other Ancestors. The news that Huang Xiaolong won first place in the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle had already reached them, and Zhu Yi was extremely happy.

Zhu Yi also praised Huang Xiaolong with a few words in front of everyone, then after a moment, he led everyone to the Fortune Gate great hall.

A feast was already prepared in the great hall.

The protagonist of the celebration banquet was not Zhu Yi nor was it Golden Brow Ancestor. It was, of course, Huang Xiaolong.

Zhu Feng and Wang Wei sat across the table from Huang Xiaolong. Both of them watched the Grand Elders and Elders enthusiastically raising their cups to toast Huang Xiaolong with flattering praise, just like the stars around the moon.

But on the surface, both Zhu Feng and Wang Wei’s faces seemed calm, and no one could tell what they were actually thinking.

During the celebration banquet, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor mentioned Huang Xiaolong’s request to enter the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s library as well as his desire to bring the little cow mount into the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

When they mentioned these matters, the joyous atmosphere in the great hall came to an abrupt halt.

At this time, Zhu Feng and Wang Wei’s calm faces finally changed. Zhu Feng’s furtive gaze fell on Grand Elder Li Cheng a few times.

Sensing Zhu Feng’s gaze, Grand Elder Li Cheng responded. He stood up from his seat and respectfully said to Zhu Yi, “Gate Chief, according to our Fortune Gate’s rules, only emperor rank genius disciples with great contributions can enter the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s library. Although, Huang Xiaolong has won first place in the Four Mainlands’ New Disciples Battle, in terms of contributions, his contributions are far less compared to our Young Lord!”

The underlying meaning of his words was very clear in everyone’s mind; even their Young Lord Zhu Feng did not have permission to enter the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s library, then Huang Xiaolong, you are much less qualified.

Several other Grand Elders also stood up, voicing their agreement with Grand Elder Li Cheng’s opinion. These Grand Elders were part of Zhu Feng’s faction.

Zhu Yi frowned slightly, then he turned to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor and asked in return, “Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, you see this...?”

Golden Brow Ancestor stated nonchalantly, “Since there are objections, we will discuss again in the future. What about the matter of Huang Xiaolong bringing his mount into the Fortune Divine Kingdom?”

Zhu Yi was secretly relieved that Golden Brow Ancestor did not insist on permitting Huang Xiaolong into the Fortune Divine Kingdom’s library, thus, he happily agreed with the latter question, “That is naturally not a problem.”

The banquet lasted for three hours before everyone adjourned; Huang Xiaolong, Li Lu and the others followed the five Ancestors back to the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

Back in his own Cosmos Palace, Huang Xiaolong did not cultivate in his secret chamber as he usually would, but pondered how he was going to get his hands on the chaos five-colored heaven refining stone from the Xiao Family’s Elder Xiao Teng in Clear Spirit World.

Time ticked away, but he still couldn’t come up with a plan, therefore, Huang Xiaolong decisively threw the matter to the back of his mind. A bright light flashed and two fist-sized ember red fire crystals appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

These two fire crystals were the Phoenix Fire Crystals that he had gotten from the Immortal Phoenix Palace at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. He had not yet refined them, hence, he decided to refine them before heading to the Clear Spirit World, to further enhance his strength.

However, sensing the terrifying amount of energy within these Phoenix Fire Crystals, he decided to use caution when refining them. Therefore, he put them away into his spatial ring once again. He needed the little cow’s purple lightning force to support him when refining them, it was much safer that way.

Early the next day, Huang Xiaolong left the Fortune Divine Kingdom, and arrived at his Myriad Gods Manor in Fortune City.

Upon his arrival, Huang Xiaolong saw that the little cow was basking in the sun with her butt in the air.
