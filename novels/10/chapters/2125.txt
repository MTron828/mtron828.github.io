Chapter 2126: Snatching the Bride?

When the King of Grandmist and the others saw the change that had happened to Huang Xiaolong, they couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

“Xiaolong, you... Are you alright?” The King of Grandmist asked in concern.

Huang Xiaolong saw the worried look on everyone’s faces, and a smile slowly formed on his face. He stretched his body as he joked, “Are you thinking about how my figure became better after I left seclusion?”

The little cow and the others nearly fell from the air when they heard his comment.

Despite their initial shock, they realized that Huang Xiaolong was right as they observed him more carefully. After exiting seclusion, his body was even more perfect than it was before. It was as though it was created from the will of the heavens and earth itself and Huang Xiaolong’s physique was perfect. No matter how they looked at it, they couldn’t find anything that put them off. In fact, they found it harder to keep their eyes off him as though he was a masterpiece sculpted by the gods themselves.

Everything had originated from his refinement of the lightning bead he had obtained in the Barbarian Space in the past. Huang Xiaolong’s Sovereign’s physique had perfected itself, and he himself seemed to have merged with the heavens.

If the current Huang Xiaolong were to fight with Wan Shi, there wouldn’t even be a need to take out the lightning bead or to activate his saint bloodlines. Killing Wan Shi would be as easy as one-two-three!

No matter how terrifying Wan Shi’s Great Purity Secret Art was, Huang Xiaolong was confident that his body would be enough to take the technique head on!

“Master, all of you can relax. I’m fine.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “These are just the gains from my seclusion!”

Instead of saying that these were the gains from his secluded cultivation, it would be more appropriate to say that Huang Xiaolong had received the favor of the heavens!

He wasn’t too confident in taking on the Heavenly Master two years and eleven months ago, but after leaving seclusion, Huang Xiaolong had absolute confidence in taking down the old man!

The little cow and the others finally calmed down when they realized that nothing untoward had happened to Huang Xiaolong. They could feel confidence radiating off him, and the little cow quickly piped up, “Xiaolong, did you enter the Fifth Order Sovereign Realm?”

“A long time back...” Huang Xiaolong nodded and admitted.

Right now, he wasn’t just a mere Fifth Order Sovereign. At the time of entering secluded cultivation, he was at the peak of the late-Fourth Order Sovereign Realm. It had taken him barely two months to enter the Fifth Order Sovereign Realm!

Right now, he was already a late-Fifth Order Sovereign!

Even if ten Wan Shis were to appear before him, they wouldn’t be able to defeat him! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When everyone heard how he had already entered the Fifth Order Sovereign Realm, a look of joy flashed through their eyes.

“Now...” The King of Grandmist couldn’t help but ask.

Could it be that my disciple has already entered the mid-Fifth Order Sovereign Realm?

“I’m a late-Fifth Order Sovereign.” Huang Xiaolong replied.

An incredulous look appeared on the everyone’s faces when they stared at Huang Xiaolong. How did he enter the late-Fifth Order Sovereign Realm so quickly?

This...?

Wasn’t he a little too fast?!

Three years!

No. Strictly speaking, he took less than three years to enter the late-Fifth Order Sovereign Realm from the late-Fourth Order Sovereign Realm!

Doesn’t it mean that the energy contained in the lightning bead is more terrifying than any of them had thought?

“Let’s go. We can head over to the Heavenly World now.” Battle intent erupted from Huang Xiaolong’s body as he said.

Without summoning the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong grabbed everyone as he charged into the sky. The speed he could unleash was several times faster than that of the Ancient Heavenly Court, and he felt that there was no point in using the Ancient Heavenly Court to get around.

Two days later, they arrived at the borders of the Heavenly World.

“Let’s enter...” A brilliant light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

In several breaths of time, they tore through space as they entered the Heavenly World.

“The wedding ceremony between Wan Xiaorong and Tian Chen will take place tomorrow! We can finally see Wan Xiaorong’s true appearance tomorrow! I wonder if it’s true that her beauty stands at the top of the world...?”

“Even if she’s pretty, what can you do about it? She’s not going to be your wife! Heh. I’ve heard that the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, Shi Zhen, and the King of Darkness tried their hardest just to get to hold her hand! Right now, she is going to belong to Tian Chen! In the nuptial chamber tomorrow, Tian Chen is probably going to go crazy when he gets to do all sorts of things with her!”

“The King of Darkness can’t even hold the hand of his beloved woman. Hahaha, Tian Chen is going to do everything he couldn’t and more! I wonder if he will get angered to the point of spitting blood...?”

“The King of Darkness might even show up during the ceremony tomorrow to challenge Tian Chen to a battle! Hahaha! If that happens, he would be beaten into a pulp by Tian Chen!”

The mockery and laughter of the various experts entered the ears of Huang Xiaolong and the others the moment they entered the Heavenly World.

When the King of Darkness heard their conversations, his face sank.

They must be tired of living!

With a wave of the King of Darknesse’s hand, all the disciples who were laughing at him were dragged towards him.

“Die!” A dark light flashed through his eyes, and a wave of darkness energy swallowed the disciples. Not even their bones remained.

When the other disciples saw what happened to their comrades, they couldn’t help but jump in fright.

It was too bad for them that rage burned in their hearts before they could verify the other party’s identity.

“Who the h*ll are you?! How dare you kill the disciples of my Dark Curses Sect?! You killed the personal disciple of our ancestor! You’re dead!!!”

One of the disciples ran over and pointed at the King of Darkness as he continued to scream, “Once our old ancestor makes a move, he will exterminate your faction!”

Cang Mutian turned to Huang Xiaolong and explained, “The Dark Curses Sect is one of the ancient sects from the Devil World. Their old ancestor had challenged the Heavenless Archdevil Lord in the past. He had disappeared after losing the battle. I would have never expected for their old ancestor to leave seclusion to head over to the Heavenly World.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. With Dark Curses Old Ancestor’s strength, he was comparable to the Heavenly Snow Old Monster and the others. It was no wonder the members of his sect could strut around so arrogantly.

The disciples of the Dark Curses Sect felt a boost to their egos when Cang Mutian brought up the strength of their old ancestor.

“Since you know about the Dark Curses Sect, that’s even better!” The disciple sneered, “So are you planning to follow us back to our old ancestor to beg for his mercy, or are you planning on waiting for our old ancestor to take action against you?”

The King of Darkness couldn’t be bothered dealing with their nonsense any longer and flicked his finger at the disciple. The youngster turned into black fog and dissipated in the wind.

The rest of the disciples stared at the group before them in shock. They were surprised that the other party still made a move against them even after learning about their identities!

Huang Xiaolong said with indifference, “Go back and tell your old ancestor to look for me if he has a problem with it. I’ll entertain him whenever he wants.”

As soon as he was done speaking, he turned around and left with the little cow and the others.

The expressions on the disciples’ faces turned ugly when they saw Huang Xiaolong and the others leave.

“What do we do now?” One of the disciples asked.

“What else can we do? We can only return and make a report to the old ancestor! Get some guys to track them down! We need to know where they live!”

Very quickly, the disciples of the Dark Curses Sect sprung into action.

After Huang Xiaolong and the others left, they flew towards the mountain range in the Heavenly World used for receiving guests. The matter with the Dark Curses Sect was thrown to the back of their minds.

“If you really can’t forget that woman, we’ll just snatch the bride during the ceremony!” Huang Xiaolong turned to speak to the King of Darkness as they made their way towards the mountain range.

Everyone couldn’t help but feel beads of cold sweat dripping down their foreheads. Snatching the bride?! That was the wedding ceremony of the younger brother of the Heavenly Master they were talking about! In all the lands, there was probably only a single person who had the guts to try something like that. That person was obviously Huang Xiaolong!

“This...” The King of Darkness muttered under his breath, and thoughts flew through his mind. He would be lying if he said that the idea hadn’t crossed his mind.
