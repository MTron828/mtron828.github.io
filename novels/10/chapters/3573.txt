Chapter 3574 – Stroll About The Unknown Space

The various precious ores and spiritual stones were secondary as Huang Xiaolong only cared about universe-level spiritual veins. Counting twenty-four of them in total, there was only a single one at the top-grade level!

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong dug out the treasury of the Eternal Heaven Alliance from Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong. Due to his wanton trading of universe-level spiritual veins for Star Dragon Scales previously, there were only several strands of universe-level spiritual veins left in there.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly disappointed, but there wasn’t much he could do. From the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s treasury and the treasury of the Creation Palace, there were less than a hundred strands of universe-level spiritual veins.

“Forget it. It’ll have to do for now.” Huang Xiaolong sighed silently in his heart.

After the experts of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance submitted to him, Huang Xiaolong ordered Jiang Hong and the others to search for information on universe-level spiritual veins in the First Universe. After passing down his order, he entered seclusion immediately.

This time, Huang Xiaolong took nearly four hundred thousand years and he reached the 15 billion units mark.

Not only did he refine all the spiritual veins he had, he also strengthened the Xuan Hong Flying Ship with the resources in the treasuries. Now, it has reached a whole new level of power! He also transformed it to the Blue Dragon Flying Ship that fit his needs.

The Blue Dragon Flying Ship was a notch stronger than the Xuan Hong Flying Ship. A blue dragon diagram was inlaid on the body of the ship, and it contained a supreme formation created by Huang Xiaolong. The souls of Huang Sheng and Ao Wanshan were sealed in the formation as the formation spirit!

As Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, one could only imagine how strong the formation spirit was!

Other than the Blue Dragon Flying Ship, Huang Xiaolong also raised the Sun and Moon Furnace to the top-grade creation artifact level. He no longer bothered with the Purple Lightning Peak now that he had the Blue Dragon Flying Ship. After all, the Blue Dragon Flying Ship far surpassed the top-grade creation artifact level. Instead of wasting more time to refine the Purple Lightning Peak, he would rather comprehend the mysteries of the universe in the Universe Sphere.

After leaving seclusion, Huang Xiaolong asked about the situation in the First Universe.

Wang Zaixu, Jiang Hong, and the others made their reports in succession.

Due to the destruction of the Creation Palace and Eternal Heaven Alliance, the unification of the First Universe didn’t meet with much obstruction.

Now, Huang Xiaolong was the sole ruler of the First Universe!

The only problem came when Huang Xiaolong asked about universe-level spiritual veins. After stuttering for some time, Jiang Hong revealed that no matter how hard they tried to look for universe-level spiritual veins, they could only find slightly more than a dozen.

As for naturally formed worlds, there wasn’t news on it at all!

Huang Xiaolong expected as much before leaving seclusion, and he wasn’t too disappointed by the discovery.

As night fell, Huang Xiaolong released the souls of Zhu Qiming and the middle aged expert who came along with him. He inspected the second great world in their bodies and conducted another soul search on them.

He was shocked to discover that the middle aged expert didn’t possess a second great world! However, it was true that he managed to gather 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy! After looking at it for a long time, Huang Xiaolong finally discovered the difference between the great world he created. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Compared to other experts at the half step Universe God Realm, his great world was much denser! If the great worlds of other experts were like a plastic ball, the great world of the middle aged man was made out of metal!

Moreover, his grand cosmos energy shone a faint golden color compared to others.

That was probably the reason behind his excessive combat strength! Huang Xiaolong gasped after he made the discovery. The man didn’t have 12 billion units of grand cosmos energy, but he had 12 billion units of combat strength!

It was no wonder half step Universe Gods were so weak! Huang Xiaolong only had 1 more question in mind. How in the world did he cultivate to such a level?

…

Searching through their souls, he discovered that it was no different from the others. Restrictions protected their core memories, and Huang Xiaolong was unable to learn a thing. He didn’t know how they managed to transform their great worlds and grand cosmos energy!

“Speak. What did you do to your great world and your grand cosmos energy?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

A sneer left the middle-aged man’s lips. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really want to know? Go ask our ancestor! Hahaha! He will definitely take pity on you and teach you our ways!”

“Alright. It doesn’t matter. I’ll make a trip over to the Unknown Lands anyway. I’ll learn all the same.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Since he wasn’t going to get an answer, he threw them back into the Sun Moon Furnace.

Several months later, Huang Xiaolong left the First Universe.

He came from the Blazing Dragon Universe, and he went to the Meng Tian Universe, Star Dragon Universe, and the First Universe. There were nine other universes he had never been to. If all the universes were similar to the four he had been to, he would be able to locate more naturally formed great worlds and universe-level spiritual veins! Huang Xiaolong believed that he would be able to grow stronger once again.

Before leaving the First Universe, Huang Xiaolong started to take his precautions against the experts of the Unknown Lands. He laid down countless formations and he taught Wang Zaixu, Jiang Hong, and several others a set of special techniques.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong went to tour the nine universes in search of treasures. Along the way, he continued to comprehend the mysteries of the universe, and by the time he was done, more than two million years had passed.

In the time he was away, he managed to find more than a dozen naturally formed great worlds! It was too bad there weren’t many universe-level spiritual veins to be found. Huang Xiaolong only managed to gather one hundred strands after scouring the universes, and he didn’t manage to find many high-grade ones, much less top-grade ones.

When he was done, Huang Xiaolong managed to accumulate 17.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

When he returned, Jiang Hong and the others were shocked by his transformation.

After hearing their reports, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Unknown Lands didn’t send anyone to the First Universe in the time he was gone.

“No one?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

Since Zhu Qiming went missing, he fully expected the Zhu Family to send several experts over to look for their young master.

Did something happen to the Zhu Family for them to remain impassive?!

Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself, “Looks like it’s time to take a look at the Unknown Lands…”
