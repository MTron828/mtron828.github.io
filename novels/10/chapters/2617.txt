Chapter 2618: Delicious!

“One… Two… Three…”

Yuan Zongyuan did a countdown at the side, and he quickly arrived at the tenth count.

When they were still watching Huang Xiaolong with a look of pity in their eyes, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred.

“Retreat!” Yuan Qianxing, who had been focused on Huang Xiaolong since the start, ordered as he reached out to deal with the threat.

However, Hei Luo’s arms blocked Yuan Qianxing from landing on Huang Xiaolong.

A miserable howl rang through the skies as Huang Xiaolong’s arm pierced through Yuan Zongyuan’s chest.

Lowering his head, Yuan Zongyuan stared at the hole Huang Xiaolong made in his chest with a dumbfounded expression. He didn’t believe that an Eighth Heaven True Saint like himself was struck by a mere Second Heaven True Saint.

The thing that caused him even more shock was that Huang Xiaolong dared to make a move on him!

I am the vice hall master of the mission hall!

Yuan Wangfeng, Chan Wuwo, and the others stared at the scene before them with slack jaws.

Boom!

A horrifying explosion rang through the skies as Yuan Qianxing clashed with Hei Luo.

The jolt brought them back to their senses, and they screamed in unison.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you lowly mongrel move against us?! Release Zongyuan immediately!”

“Kill him!”

“Kill this dog b*stard of a human!” Yuan Wangfeng screamed. He hadn’t thought that Huang Xiaolong would dare to move against them after all four royal families had formed an alliance against him. Moreover, they hadn’t expected his first target to be a vice hall master of the Otherworldly Mansion.

Yuan Wangfeng’s voice barely fell when he charged towards Huang Xiaolong with everything he had! As for the others, they quickly followed behind him as they shot towards Huang Xiaolong with their attacks. Like a solitary island in the middle of the raging ocean, Huang Xiaolong was on the verge of being swallowed.

The Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm undead spirits and ghosts appeared beside Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

The Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring appeared above him as strands of grand dao law fell from the void to block the attacks of those flying towards him.

“This… Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact?!”

“That’s definitely a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact!”

Yuan Wangfeng and the others screamed when they noticed the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring. They could feel the power of a Primal Ancestor in the ring, and a flame started to burn in their hearts.

Even Yuan Qianxing couldn’t hide his desire for the weapon.

Existences at the level of Primal Ancestors would start a bloodbath in order to obtain a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact, and there wasn’t a need to say how far Yuan Qianxing and the others were willing to go.

“Kill Huang Xiaolong and grab that dao artifact now!” Yuan Wangfeng yelled at the disciples of the Myriad Origin Race.

“The dao artifact belongs to my Twin Dragon Race!”

“No! It belongs to my Enchantress Race!”

“Bullsh*t! My Golden Buddha Race is the owner of the treasure!”

The experts of all four races rushed Huang Xiaolong at once.

A cold smirk formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as his goal of drawing aggro was achieved in an instant. Devouring Yuan Zongyuan in a matter of milliseconds, Huang Xiaolong started his counter attack. With a swing of his arm, he pushed people like Yuan Wangfeng, Chan Wuwo, Yao Ji, Zi Yutong, and other experts away.

“What?!”

They were shocked at Huang Xiaolong’s display of strength.

Every single one of them was an existence at the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm. They were definitely able to suppress anyone below the Primal Ancestor Realm if they worked together, but all of them were sent flying with a single blow from Huang Xiaolong!

This!

Yuan Qianxing’s heart started to pound when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s strength. It seemed as though he had still underestimated the other party’s strength. The desire to kill Huang Xiaolong in his heart grew stronger as he knew that there was no longer a path of retreat after trying to force the other party to become their slaves. If he didn’t kill Huang Xiaolong right here and now, he would be in deep trouble in the future.

Kill!

Pressing forward with both hands, Yuan Qianxing struck at Huang Xiaolong with all his might. The weight of a thousand Chaos Essence Holy Peaks slammed against Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Even peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saints would suffer serious injuries.

However, a black palm appeared to block the attack before it could arrive.

Hei Luo did it again!

Seeing as the black figure was thwarting his plans every time, Yuan Qianxing decided to get serious. Mysterious energy started to pour out from his body.

It was the bloodline strength of those from the Myriad Origin Race!

Previously, Yuan Changyao had displayed this move in the arena during the competition. However, Yuan Changyao’s strength was like a firefly if Yuan Qianxing’s power was the moon.

The power Yuan Qianxing drew upon was the true energy contained at the core of the world!

A palm struck towards Hei Luo suddenly.

With a shake of his body, Hei Luo returned to his true form as devil corpse qi filled the area. He welcomed Yuan Qianxing attack with one of his own.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle as the two of them fought. His body disappeared from its original position after ditching the withered corpse that was Yuan Zongyuan.

He appeared beside Jin Kang, another vice hall master.

“Huang!” Jin Kang panicked the moment he arrived, and he wanted to fire off some threats before Huang Xiaolong could do anything. However, he was a little too slow as terrifying waves of energy were sucked out of his body. “That’s number two…”

As his voice became weaker and weaker, he turned to Chan Wuwo and pleaded, “Young… Young Patriarch, help… help…” But before he could finish speaking, Huang Xiaolong grabbed his throat.

Very quickly, his saint attributes were devoured by the other party. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As soon as he was done, Huang Xiaolong locked on to his third victim.

Now that his saint godheads were nearing the tenth rank, Huang Xiaolong’s devouring speed had reached a terrifying level.

The fourth person fell soon.

“There’s the fifth!”

“Sixth one down…”

Huang Xiaolong’s voice was like the whispers of the grim reaper as he would devour an expert every time he increased the count by one. The only person he was concerned about was Yuan Qianxing, but since Hei Luo was strong enough to hold the man back, Huang Xiaolong could feast as he pleased.

Since they had sent so much food over to open an all you can eat buffet for Huang Xiaolong, he would let them down if he stopped before he achieved his goal!

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t devour their holy souls. He didn’t wish to expose his Inextinguishable Dao Heart in the Alien Lands. Things would get out of hand if he did.

“Number twenty-eight!”

The twenty-eighth person turned into a withered corpse and fell towards the ground below.

Since Huang Xiaolong chose his targets well, he devoured all those at the Seventh and Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm. His saint godheads started to glow with faint light as a special type of power awakened within them.
