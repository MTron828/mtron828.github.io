Bai Hui looked at Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping with an amiable smile. “Ao Ping, Ao Li, I heard from Claude that both of you have something to discuss with us? What matter would it be?”

Ao Ping took the initiative to answer, “I had heard my father mentioned that when the Radiance Ancestor went away, he had left a Jade Angel Wall. Any Reverence Moon Academy’s student who can resurrect the fourteen-winged angel’s soul sealed inside the wall can enter the Boundary Ancestral Mountain. Our purpose for coming here today is...”

“No!” Ao Ping had yet to finish his words when Bin Ge snapped, cutting off the rest of Ao Ping’s words, and directly rejected Ao Ping’s request.

“Why not?” Ao Ping frowned subconsciously. “The Senior Radiance Ancestor’s word was that any student of Reverence Moon Academy can attempt to comprehend the Jade Angel Wall. I’m afraid that four deputy deans have no right to refuse any academy’s student.”

Bin Ge’s face sank immediately, “What, you are questioning our decision?! Ao Ping, don’t assume that you can disrespect us elders just because your father has a good relationship with us. It is not your place, as a junior, to question or comment on our decision!”

Huang Xiaolong interjected coldly, “Since you dare to do this, why can’t others talk about it? Your actions go against the Radiance Ancestor’s intention. More importantly, Senior Reverence Moon is unaware of this, right?”

Bin Ge was angered since Huang Xiaolong, a new student, who had just entered the Reverence Moon Academy’s imperial courtyard, had dared to challenge their authorities. Bin Ge rose angrily from his seat and slapped his palm on the table. The overwhelming coercive pressure from a Sovereign Realm expert flooded out the hall. “Such impudence! Ao Li, do you think we won’t levy you with heavy punishment just because of your bit of talent? I shall teach you a lesson now and make you understand what respecting elders looks like!” He raised his palm, ready to force Huang Xiaolong to kneel on the floor.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, the Heavenly Hall within his body emitted a brilliant light. At the same time, his three supreme godheads spun frenziedly.

As Bin Ge’s palm was about to strike down, Bai Hui called out, “Wait!”

With a casual flick of his wrist he dissipated Bin Ge’s condensing attack.

Bai Hui said as his attention returned to Huang Xiaolong, “Both of you want to enter the Boundary Ancestral Mountain and want to comprehend the Jade Angel Wall. That is not a problem at all.”

Everyone was taken aback.

“Brother Ban Hui, you—!” Bin Ge became anxious.

Bai Hui raised his hand, stopping others from interrupting as he continued to speak to Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping, “As long as you successfully comprehend the characters above the Reverence Moon Academy’s main entrance, I will permit you to comprehend the Jade Angel Wall!”

“What?!” Ao Ping’s eyes widened, feeling dumbfounded. The Reverence Moon Old Man himself wrote the ‘Reverence Moon Academy’ above the academy’s gates. Since the foundation of the Reverence Moon Academy, no one had yet comprehended the esoterics contained within the four characters. Even Dun Hao had merely managed to comprehend three characters in over ten thousand years. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In other words, this condition that Bai Hui had put forth was simply to make things difficult for them and forcing them to quit voluntarily.

Bin Ge, Ban Ge, and Bai Luo inwardly sighed in relief hearing that. On the surface, all three nodded majestically in agreement.

“The Reverence Moon Academy’ characters above the main entrance and the Jade Angel Wall are considered to have originated from the same source. If you fail to comprehend the esoterics within the ‘Reverence Moon Academy’ then it means that you won’t succeed in resurrecting the fourteen-winged angel’s soul. Hence, it is futile to let you go straight to the Jade Angel Wall.”

Bin Ge added icily, “We will allow you into the Jade Angel Wall area when you successfully comprehended the four characters!”

At this time, Dun Hao laughed. “Ao Li, Ao Ping, did you two hear that? As long as you two can comprehend the four characters of ‘Reverence Moon Academy,’ the four deputy deans would allow you to comprehend the Jade Angel Wall. Quickly, thank the four deputy deans!”

Dun Hao had spent more than ten thousand years comprehending these four characters. Thus he understood that it took more than talent. He didn’t think Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping have the ability.

“You!” Ao Ping glared fiercely at Dun Hao, but Huang Xiaolong suddenly spoke, “Agreed!”

Everyone was surprised by his answer.

“Remember, this is what you’ve promised.” Huang Xiaolong looked straight into the four deputy deans’ eyes.

Bai Hui nodded his head and affirmed, “Yes.”

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said to Ao Ping.

“Wait!” Dun Hao suddenly called out, stopping Huang Xiaolong and Ao Ping from leaving. “Ao Li, you have made a bet with Ao Ping to defeat me on the battle stage within ten moves. May I know when are you planning to go up the battle stage? I hope you won’t make me wait too long.”

Huang Xiaolong responded tepidly, “Don’t fret! I’ll meet you on the battle stage within half a year and kill you!” With that said, he turned and left the hall with Ao Ping.

Anger rose to Dun Hao’s face.

Watching this, Claude hurriedly saluted to the four deputy deans and took his leave like the wind.

Bin Ge watched Huang Xiaolong’s retreating figure and snorted, “This Ao Li is really lawless!” He then turned to Dun Hao “The four of us have spent several hundred million years to refine a top-grade grandmist divine armor. We will loan it to you when you battle him on the stage. You must exert your full strength. There is no need to have mercy!”

Dun Hao was overjoyed hearing that and immediately thanked them, “Many thanks to four Masters!”

Looks like Ao Li had utterly provoked the ire of Bin Ge and the other three deputy deans.

“But, Ao Li’s talent is a little unpredictable. There is a high chance he will comprehend the esoterics within the ‘Reverence Moon Academy’.” Bai Luo said with seriousness.

Bai Hui waved his hand, sounding unconcerned, “Even if he comprehends the four characters, it’s something we would be worrying about ten thousand years later. Anything can happen in the meantime.”

The several of them nodded readily.

After leaving the Reverence Moon Peak, as they flew out to the outer area of the imperial courtyard, Ao Ping couldn’t resist grumbling, “Brother, I know you’re not as simple as you look on the surface, but to comprehend the ‘Reverence Moon Academy’ characters cannot be done with talent alone.”

“I know.” Huang Xiaolong reassured with a smile.

“Why did you agree with them, knowing it?” Ao Ping was speechless.

“What else can I do?” Huang Xiaolong questioned in return.

Ao Ping could reply to this. “...........”

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong stood in front of the Reverence Moon Academy’s main entrance, looking at the four glistening characters above.

At this point, there was already a crowd gathering, consisting of Reverence Moon Academy’s students and teachers.

“He is that imperial courtyard student with a king of supreme godhead, Ao Li? Damn, his arrogance knows no bounds. He actually claimed that he’s going to defeat His Highness Dun Hao in ten moves! He not only claimed that but he even challenged the four deputy deans’ authority for entering the Boundary Ancestral Mountain!”

“Still, there’s a rumor that Ao Li’s talent is higher than His Highness Dun Hao!”

“Higher? Impossible! It’s nothing more than a rumor. Then again, no matter how high his talent is, offending His Highness Dun Hao means one way straight to hell. Not to mention Ao Li has already offended the four deputy deans. No one will protect him now. He won’t even know how he died!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was calm as if the surrounding whispers and finger-pointing had got nothing to do with him. Bright lights bloomed inside his pupils, and soon, the crowd noticed the ripples of sacred light from his body.

This sacred light seemed to possess a life of its own, dancing in the air, sometimes condensing, sometimes scattering into thin mists, taking shapes, flowing aimlessly, and even roiled violently.

Several minutes later, this sacred light had extended over a ten thousand li radius.

As the sacred light spread, the students’ whispers and finger-pointing stopped. Seemingly affected by the sacred light, they had a drunken look on their faces as if they were intoxicated and obsessed. The teachers were no exception.

Half an hour later, a faint white light glowed from the meteorite rock material of the four characters and began to mingle with the sacred light from Huang Xiaolong’s body, scattering, condensing, or taking shapes.
