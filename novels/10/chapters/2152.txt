Chapter 2153: The Most Expensive Message

I want as many as you have!!

This nouveau riche tone!

Probably, only Huang Xiaolong dared to utter such words. Even the top five heavenly countries’ rulers in the Heavens Path or the Heavens Path’s top ten experts wouldn’t dare to claim they wanted as many origin pills as there were!

The Heavenly Terror Country General Sun Po couldn’t resist mocking Huang Xiaolong, “What a big tone!”

The corner of Battle Emperor’s eye twitched, but the amiable smile on his face remained as he said to Huang Xiaolong, “Younger Brother, do your words stand?”

Huang Xiaolong immediately became spirited. Could this Battle Emperor Hong Ming still have origin pills on him? Hong Ming was the Battle Emperor’s real name.

“Of course. Does Senior Battle Emperor have other origin pills?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Battle Emperor Hong Ming chuckled sonorously in reply, “I don’t, but our Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler has. However, he does not have the Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills. He has the Great Treasure Dragon Pills!”

Great Treasure Dragon Pills! Low-grade, high-level origin pills!

It was more than ten times more potent than the Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills!

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly delighted. The Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler actually had the Great Treasure Dragon Pills in his hands. This was truly good news for him.

What did Huang Xiaolong lack the most?

Was it origin treasures and origin pills, ah!?

For him to break through to high-level Sovereign Realm, these five Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pills were far from enough.

Listening to the meaning of Battle Emperor Hong Ming’s words, did the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler have plans to sell the Great Treasure Dragon Pills in his hand?

Though all kinds of origin pills were precious, each kind of origin pill had different functions. Some origin pills had little benefits to some cultivators. Hence it was better for them to sell these origin pills rather than consume them, or exchange them for chaos spirit stones. Then, with these chaos spirit stones, they could buy origin treasures or origin pills that were more useful to them.

Therefore, it was nothing strange hearing that the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler had the intention to sell his Great Treasure Dragon Pills.

“Senior Battle Emperor means to say that the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler is planning to sell his Great Treasure Dragon Pills?!” Huang Xiaolong asked with anxiety seeped into his voice.

Battle Emperor Hong Ming smiled and nodded his head, “Yes, Xiao Qing that kid found two Great Treasure Dragon Pills in the 33 heavens’ space long ago. He consumed one of the pills, so there’s only one left. He plans to sell it, but the price of the Great Treasure Dragon Pill is not cheap.”

The Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler’s name was Xiao Qing.

Sun Po couldn’t resist interjecting at this point, directing his words at Huang Xiaolong, “Kid, you must be ignorant of the price of a low-grade, high-level origin pill. Aren’t you? The Great Treasure Dragon Pill costs at least ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones. Can you afford it?”

Even rulers of the top one hundred heavenly countries in the Heavens Path would have a hard time taking out ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones all at once.

Sun Po refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong, who had just taken out five thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones, could take out another ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even spare Sun Po a glance, as his attention remained on Battle Emperor Hong Ming.

Battle Emperor Hong Ming nodded his head as he affirmed what Sun Po had just said, “That’s right, the Great Treasure Dragon Pill costs at least ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones, and that is based on the lowest price. As for the actual price, it depends on Xiao Qing, that kid.”

“Kid, did you hear that? The Great Treasure Dragon Pill costs ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones. That is the lowest price, which means ten thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones are not enough.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Sun Po couldn’t resist rubbing Huang Xiaolong’s face in it, gloating as he added, “Also, the Black Dragon Ruler is not someone that miscellaneous people can see if they want to!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. He had ignored the Heavenly Terror Country’s expert from the beginning because he could not be bothered to pay him any attention, but this fly kept buzzing in his ears nonstop.

Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong were enraged and were about to reprimand Sun Po, but they were stopped by Huang Xiaolong’s raised hand. He looked at Sun Po and said, “I’ll let you keep your head on your shoulders for now. I will soon visit Heavenly Terror Country, and hang your head on the roof of the Heavenly Terror Divine Palace!”

Everyone was stupefied by Huang Xiaolong’s words.

The Heavenly Terror Country’s General Sun Po laughed wantonly, pointing his finger at Huang Xiaolong, “Kid, what did you say? I didn’t hear clearly just now. Say it one more time.”

Hang my head on the Heavenly Terror Divine Palace’s roof? Even the Heavenly Saint Ruler wouldn’t dare to utter such words, nor is he capable of such an act. But this nameless character in front of me actually has the guts to say that he would hang my head on the roof of the Heavenly Terror Divine Palace?

Sun Po wasn’t the only person that thought Huang Xiaolong was spewing bullsh*t. Many present experts were shaking their heads at Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance.

Battle Emperor Hong Ming was a little surprised and took a closer look at Huang Xiaolong as if he wanted to refresh his impression of Huang Xiaolong again.

The surrounding people’s reactions did not affect Huang Xiaolong. He turned around, and his fingers flicked out something. A spatial ring fell into Battle Emperor Hong Ming’s palm. “Senior Battle Emperor, there are one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones in that spatial ring. They are for you. I’ll have to trouble you to pass a message to the Black Dragon Ruler when you return. I would like to buy the Great Treasure Dragon Pill. Whether the transaction is successful or not, these one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones will still be yours.”

The surrounding experts were shocked.

One thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones just for Hong Ming to pass a message?!

This!

Even the furious General Sun Po looked dumbfounded.

What was the value of one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones?

Earlier, for one Chaos Heavenly Dragon Soul Pill, the Nine Supremes Heavenly Country had merely offered four hundred high-grade chaos spirit stones.

Even for existences such as the Nine Supremes Heavenly Country, one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones took a long period of accumulation inside the treasury, yet Huang Xiaolong easily gave that amount to Hong Ming, just to pass a message!

Just to pass a message, this expense was simply extravagant! This was absolutely the most expensive message in the Heavens Path!

Battle Emperor Hong Ming was beyond astonished, but soon, he was grinning from ear to ear. He nodded at Huang Xiaolong as he agreed, “Alright, since Younger Brother gave it to me, I shall accept it. I will surely pass the message for you.” With that said, he smoothly collected the spatial ring with one thousand high-grade chaos spirit stones.

Hong Ming subsequently gave Huang Xiaolong a transmission symbol, saying that if there was any reply from the Black Dragon Ruler, he would be in touch with him.

The crowd looked enviously at the transmission symbol in Huang Xiaolong’s palm. Who was the Battle Emperor? He was someone even the Black Dragon Heavenly Country’s ruler treated with respect and called senior. No random person in the Heavens Path could get his transmission symbol.

Battle Emperor Hong Ming chatted happily for a while with Huang Xiaolong before leaving with a spring in his step.

After Battle Emperor Hong Ming left, Huang Xiaolong, Xumi Old Man, Zhu Xinyi and Zhu Hong also left the store.

“Send people to check what is that kid’s origin.” Sun Po ordered the subordinate by his side as he coldly watched Huang Xiaolong leave.

The subordinate complied respectfully.

But the subordinate returned to Sun Po before long, “Lord, I just received news that that kid had a conflict with the Mighty God Prince over two Moon Elephant Spirit Fruits. He offended the Mighty God Prince. Not only that, he even spoke words of contempt, disrespecting the Mighty God Heavenly Country, which infuriated the Mighty God Prince. The Mighty God Prince has released the word that he’s going to pack up the kid once he steps out of Heaven Valley City!!”

Hearing that, Sun Po erupted in harsh laughter, “That kid really isn’t afraid of death. Well, with the Mighty God Prince taking action, I won’t have to do anything. Wait till that kid steps out of the Heaven Valley City and then report to me. I want to go see a good show.”

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s group circled the marketplace’s second floor. Whenever Huang Xiaolong came across origin treasures, regardless of level one or level two origin treasures, he bought them without hesitation.

Watching the number of high-grade chaos spirit stones flowing out from Huang Xiaolong’s hands, Xumi Old Man’s heart skipped a beat.

After leaving the marketplace, Huang Xiaolong and Xumi Old Man went to the Heavenly Saint Country’s branch building. They stayed there for a day, before deciding to leave the Heaven Valley for the Mighty God Heavenly Country.

Huang Xiaolong had already mapped out his route. From the Mighty God Heavenly Country, he would go to the Black Dragon Heavenly Country to buy that Great treasure Dragon Pill, and then enter seclusion to break through to high-level Sovereign.
