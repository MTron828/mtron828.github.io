“Earth Bear!”

Zhang Renjie and Han Qing finally noticed the Earth Bear beside Huang Xiaolong. As the Earth Bear’s appearance looked quite similar to an ordinary bear, it was quite difficult to recognize him unless one looked closely.

The rest of the experts from the various Emperor Palaces were shocked.

All of them were shocked because they knew the origins of the Earth Bear.

Zhang Renjie and Han Qing quickly regained their senses.

“You are Fortune Emperor Palace’s king of supreme godhead disciple, Huang Xiaolong?” Zhang Renjie was secretly shocked after finding out Huang Xiaolong’s identity. “Was what my disciple said earlier true?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head inwardly.

Even though Zhang Renjie is Wu Tianhe’s master, he is pretty unbiased... He actually asked me for my side of the story.

However, before Huang Xiaolong could answer, Wu Tianhe interrupted again, “Master, if you don’t believe me, you can ask all the other disciples, they can vouch for me!” He then turned around and looked at Huang Xiaolong coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, do you dare to say that this Earth Bear wasn’t discovered by us?”

“Reporting to Ancestor Zhang Renjie, back when we were at the Perfect Galaxy, we were the ones who found the Earth Bear!” The disciples successively claimed.

Zhang Renjie frowned, “I’m not asking you guys!”

Wu Tianhe and the disciples stood to the side in fright and none of them dared to continue speaking.

“Huang Xiaolong, was this Earth Bear discovered by our disciples?” At this moment, Han Qing who was standing at the side asked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong calmly replied, “That’s right, it was indeed discovered by your disciples first.”

Wu Tianhe and the rest of the disciples were delighted.

Han Qing said with a frigid expression, “I’ve heard since long ago that even though Fortune Emperor Palace’s king of supreme godhead disciple, Huang Xiaolong, has unparalleled talent, his character does not amount to much. He is extremely arrogant and ignorant. Looks like the rumors are indeed true!” She then released her spiritual qi and locked Huang Xiaolong in place.

“Stop!” Suddenly, several people shouted in unison.

Everyone was shocked as Zhang Renjie was one of them who had stopped Han Qing. Of course, the Earth Bear, the little cow, and Huang Xiaolong were amongst the people who had shouted for Han Qing to stop.

Han Qing’s gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, no one can intercede for you today!” She then turned to Zhang Renjie and continued, “Renjie, no matter what, you cannot deny the fact that Huang Xiaolong has injured Wu Tianhe and our disciples inside our Grandmist Emperor Palace.”

Zhang Renjie opened his mouth, but eventually nothing came out from him.

No matter what, Huang Xiaolong did indeed injure the members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace inside the palace itself.

“Hold on!” The Earth Bear yelled out again and pointed to Wu Tianhe’s group, “They are all bad people! They were the ones who hunted me down! I ran into big brother when I was running away from them, and I begged him to save me! In order to hide the fact that they found me, they wanted to kill big brother to silence him! What else was big brother supposed to do? Allow them to kill him without protecting himself?”

Everyone was shocked to hear the truth.

“When we arrived at Grandmist Emperor Palace, we happened to meet with these bad people again! When they saw big brother, they immediately colluded with the people from the Brightness Emperor Palace to try and capture big brother. You can’t blame big brother for injuring them!” The Earth Bear explained.

Han Qing, who had berated Huang Xiaolong and wanted to capture him, stopped in her tracks.

“Did that happen?” Zhang Renjie turned around and stared at Wu Tianhe.

Wu Tianhe and the disciples from the Grandmist Emperor Palace were scared senseless and quickly kneeled on the ground.

“Master, this ... no ... I ... no!” Wu Tianhe stuttered as he tried to explain his way out of it.

As for the disciples, they didn’t even dare to utter a word.

“So what? The fact remains that you injured our disciples.” Han Qing snorted with a frown.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered as he asked, “So what you are saying is that no matter what, your Grandmist Emperor Palace is always right? No matter what happened, it’s my fault?”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong question her like this, Ancestor Han Qing’s face turned pale.

How many millions of years had it been since someone dared to speak to her like that?!

“Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are to question our Ancestor Han Qing?” Wu Tianhe yelled righteously.

Everyone felt that Huang Xiaolong was speaking out of turn at that moment. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even though he had pretty decent talent, he was merely a God King Realm disciple. However, he dared to question Han Qing without showing a shred of respect for her. Even if Fang Gan was here, he wouldn’t dare to question Han Qing.

Just then, a lazy voice suddenly sounded out, “Aren’t you guys curious about Huang Xiaolong’s purpose for coming to the Grandmist Emperor Palace?”

Everyone was dumbfounded when they heard the voice and they turned to stare at the source of it. When they realized that the little cow was the one speaking, all of them felt their head go numb.

However, her words stunned Wu Tianhe. He thought of asking about it, but he felt that whatever the reason, it wasn’t important enough for him to care about it. After hearing the little cow, his curiosity was piqued. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t have traveled to the Grandmist Emperor Palace for sightseeing, could he?

Thus, everyone’s gaze fell onto Huang Xiaolong.

“He’s here to see your Emperor!” The little cow declared.

Everyone felt an explosion go off in their mind. Immediately after, Wu Tianhe broke out in laughter whilst Peng Xingfei, Sun Bin, Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the rest shook their heads before looking at Huang Xiaolong as though he was a retard.

“Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are to see our Emperor? What type of status does our Emperor even have? Do you think a lowly Fortune Emperor Palace disciple like you even have the qualifications to see him? Even if Fang Gan was here and kneeled for three years, it would still be impossible for him to see our Emperor, not to mention you! Even as a grand elder, it has been a few hundreds of millions of years since I last saw our Emperor!”

Even Zhang Renjie and Han Qing both shook their heads and found Huang Xiaolong to be quite naive. Even as ancestors of Grandmist Emperor Palace, it was extremely difficult for them to meet their Emperor, not to mention Huang Xiaolong.

Looking at Wu Tianhe grinning away, Huang Xiaolong said calmly, “Just because you can’t meet your Emperor, doesn’t mean that others can’t.”

Wu Tianhe laughed uncontrollably, “So what you are saying is, you can see our Emperor? If you really can see our Emperor, I will kowtow to you three times!”

At this moment, a figure flew towards them.

Zhang Renjie, Han Qing, and Wu Tianhe were shocked when they recognized the newcomer.

The person who had come had the appearance of a handsome man in his twenties, and his qi was well restrained. They weren’t able to probe out his true strength in the slightest.

Others might have been unaware of the young man’s identity, but all the members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace couldn’t be more clear of his identity! He was the personal disciple of the Emperor himself, Liu Rui!

This... Why was the Emperor’s personal disciple here?!
