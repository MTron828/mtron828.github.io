Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai frowned deeply, as were disappointed by Xiang Xiaojie’s sudden interjection.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng sneered and said, “Be killed regardless? I am interested in testing the power of the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s ancient grand formation!” Xu Baisheng pressed down his paw on Xiang Xiaojie from across space, just before completing his sentence.

Xiang Xiaojie felt a mountain-toppling power crushing him in the blink of an eye.

Xiang Xiaojie had always been confidant in his power being a late-Tenth Ancestor God Realm Master. But now, he felt extremely insignificant, fragile, and absolutely vulnerable!

Xiang Xiaojie felt fear like never before. Am I going to die?!

Die—!

Fortunately, Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai acted at the same time.

Their God King Realm masters’ godforce rushed out from their bodies, covering the land.

Rumble!

The force from their palms collided with Xu Baisheng’s paw force in midair.

Space became distorted and space fissures appeared.

Air currents became turbulent and chaotic, sweeping out in all directions. Buildings in the distant streets shattered into pieces.

The aftershock resulting from this collision sent Xiang Xiaojie, Xiang Yuan, Xiang Weizhen, and the others flying.

Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai both staggered backwards a few times. Additionally, Patriarch Xiang Tai even coughed up a mouthful of blood.

Seeing this result, Xiang Xiaojie, Xiang Yuan, Xiang Weizhen, and the others were completely dumbfounded.

Their Ancestor and Patriarch’s joint efforts had failed to block the demonic beast’s paw strike entirely! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Their Ancestor was a peak early Third Order God King Realm master, and their Patriarch’s cultivation was at peak late-First Order God King Realm!

Then, that demonic beast must be...?!

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders and Elders looked at Xu Baisheng fearfully. Could it be that this demonic beast is a late-Third Order God King Realm master or above...?!

In fact, these Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s members had guessed right. Xu Baisheng’s strength had indeed recovered to late-Third Order God King Realm after cultivating for several years at the Sand Waves Sect’s headquarters!

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng had the confidence to face the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s ancient grand formation because of the level of his cultivation.

Suddenly, the world was engulfed in deep silence.

The group of Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s members stood in midair, seemingly frozen. Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai swallowed chaos spiritual pills to heal their injuries, and adjusted their condition silently. Neither of them dared to make any sudden moves.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng stopped attacking after the first paw strike, and resumed guarding Huang Xiaolong.

Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai were slightly relieved.

Moments later, Xiang Xiaojie, Xiang Yuan, Xiang Weizhen, and the others returned to Ancestor Xiang Hui, and Patriarch Xiang Tai’s side. Xiang Xiaojie used voice transmission and said to Ancestor Xiang Hui and Xiang Tai, “Ancestor, Patriarch, let’s activate the Myriad Elephant Grand Formation, we can suppress them only by activating the Myriad Elephant Grand Formation!”

Both Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai frowned at his suggestion.

“Ancestor, Patriarch, don’t hesitate any longer. If we don’t activate the Myriad Elephant Grand Formation right away, then it would be too late if that beast changes his mind and attacks us!” Xiang Xiaojie urged anxiously, “What if the beast wants to slaughter the entire Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City? No one would be able to stop him! Do you want to see streams of blood in the royal city?!”

Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai’s eyes glimmered with hesitation.

While the two of them hovered between their options, a loud boom suddenly shook the square, as if the land itself had split open. This jolted the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s group, and when they looked down they saw the petrified divine elephant emitted a startling black light.

This...!

How is this possible?!

As long as they could remember, the petrified divine elephant had been standing there for billions of years. No matter how much he was attacked, or regardless of the secret techniques performed, the petrified divine elephant had never shown any reaction. He had always stood there.

But now, he was emitting a startling black light!

Soon, this crepuscular black light shone brighter and stronger, and the experts in half of the royal city could see the black light.

When Ancestor Xiang Hui, Patriarch Xiang Tai, and the others recovered from their shock, all of their eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone could see the astounding changes happening in the petrified divine elephant, and it was obvious that Huang Xiaolong was causing them.

“Ancestor and Patriarch, Huang Xiaolong is using some secret technique to destroy our Holy Elephant!” Xiang Xiaojie impulsively shouted the first thought that came to his mind, and then shouted even louder, “We cannot allow Huang Xiaolong to destroy our Holy Elephant; immediately activate the Myriad Elephant Grand Formation, kill them!”

Destroy the Holy Elephant?!

Ancestor Xiang Hui and others were stupefied by Xiang Xiaojie’s words.

In a split second, Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai recovered their senses. Earlier, they had thought that Huang Xiaolong was trying to resurrect the petrified divine elephant, but if this guy was actually trying to destroy it like Xiang Xiaojie said...?!

If Huang Xiaolong was really trying to destroy their clan’s Holy Elephant, then they would become sinners for past and future generations of Ten Thousand Elephant Clan, since they were not stopping him!

The more the two thought about it, the more anxious they became.

Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Tai finally decided to issue an order to activate the Myriad Elephant Grand Formation to suppress Huang Xiaolong and his group, but they heard a thunderous boom before they could act upon it.

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s group looked in the direction of the booming sound and saw that the layer of stone had exploded from the statue of the petrified divine elephant. A majestic divine elephant towering several hundred zhang in front of them, exuding an aura of desolate era!

The enormous divine elephant raised his trunk to the sky and let out a world-shaking trumpet. Giant sound waves rushed out, sending the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s group tumbling back in the midair.

Even the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and the little cow were knocked backwards.

Only Huang Xiaolong remained rooted and unaffected in his spot.

Startling black light shone from the surface of the divine elephant as he stood there, a mighty momentum spread from his body to the entire royal city. Under this oppressive pressure, all the living beings in the royal city prostrated to the ground, as if this pressure could shatter them to death instantly.

“How many years has it been, that I, Xiang Xun, has finally been resurrected?! Resurrected!” The divine elephant laughed happily to himself, fully releasing his momentum as if he wanted to vent out his frustration, anger, hate, and unwillingness.

In the distance, Ancestor Xiang Hui, Patriarch Xiang Tai, and the others regained their balance as they felt the rush of mixed emotions filled with shock, joy, and euphoria.

“The Old Ancestor is resurrected!”

“Old Ancestor is finally resurrected!”

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s group laughed joyously. Ancestor Xiang Hui and Patriarch Xiang Hui were beaming with joy.

Their Old Ancestor had been resurrected—what a powerful momentum! Their Old Ancestor was certainly a high-level God King Realm master!

Xiang Hui, Xiang Tai, and the rest quickly flew towards the divine elephant.

“Ten Thousand Elephant Clan younger generation Xiang Hui, Xiang Tai, lead the clan’s disciples to greet Old Ancestor. We congratulate the Old Ancestor on being resurrected!” Xiang Hui and Xiang Tai said and prostrated on the ground.

The divine elephant converged his momentum and the black light dispersed. He looked at the group of Ten Thousand Elephant Clan and nodded. “Which generation of Xiang Huajie’s are you?!It must have been hard for you all to guard me for so many years! Rise!”

Xiang Huajie was the The Thousand Elephant Clan’s first generation Patriarch in the Vientiane World.

Xiang Hui and the others were all smiling as they quickly thanked the divine elephant and stood up.

It was at this moment when the divine elephant turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.
