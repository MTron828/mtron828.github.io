Chapter 2199: 33 Heavens Race

“Huang Xiaolong isn’t dead! He managed to survive the lightning barrage!”

“I’ve heard that he managed to gather all nine great chaos lightning pools. After obtaining the Spatial Domain Lightning Pool in the space outside the 33 heavens, he fused them together and managed to escape certain death! He also refined three Lightning Origin Divine Fruits while he was away! Even if Giant Kun Ruler managed to borrow the origin energy of the Heavenly Country, he was no match for Huang Xiaolong!”

“Not only that, the Giant Kun Ruler couldn’t even take a single hit from Huang Xiaolong. If that really is the case, how will the leader of the 33 Heavens Race suppress Huang Xiaolong? Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong is the strongest individual in the Heavens Path?”

The Heavens Path shook when the news got to them. Everyone found it unbelievable as their shock was mixed in with fear and unease.

When Huang Xiaolong brought the members of the Huang Family back to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, he ordered for the Heavenly Saint Ruler and the others to rebuild the Giant Kun Divine Palace. Since the members of the Huang Family were already there, Huang Xiaolong planned to settle them down in the Giant Kun Heavenly Country. In the future, they could just cultivate peacefully in the Heavens Path.

As the Giant Kun Ruler had used billions of years to refine the Giant Kun Divine Palace, the spiritual qi concentration was off the charts, and cultivating in the divine palace was countless times better than cultivating anywhere else.

After adding the spiritual herbs and pills in the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s treasury, Huang Xiaolong knew that the members of the Huang Family would definitely be able to cultivate in the best environment possible. Their cultivation would soar.

Although Huang Xiaolong’s battle had caused a certain level of destruction to the palace, the combined effort of the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler in addition to Huang Xiaolong’s radiance energy allowed them to fix the palace in less than ten days.

The reconstructed Giant Kun Divine Palace was bursting with spiritual energy as spiritual creatures could be seen roaming around the area. The beauty of the divine palace was beyond compare.

Huang Xiaolong brought the members of the Huang Family to roam around the Giant Kun Heavenly Country in the day, and he activated the grand formation to transform the Heavenly Country’s origin energy into something the Huang Family members could use to cultivate in the night.

With Huang Xiaolong’s help, their cultivation shot up like they were sitting on a rocketship.

As for the matter with the 33 Heavens Race, Huang Xiaolong felt that it wasn’t a pressing matter. There was no rush for him to head over to their territory.

When Huang Xiaolong was accompanying his family, several rulers who used to be under the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and Heavenly Terror Country showed up with their generals in tow to swear their allegiance to Huang Xiaolong.

As the number-one heavenly country in the Heavens Path, tons of powers had submitted to the Giant Kun Ruler in the past. Even though the Heavenly Terror Country wasn’t as strong as the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, the number of powers under them wasn’t small.

Once a month, several hundred rulers came to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country to submit to Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing as they were planning to follow under his banner, Huang Xiaolong didn’t chase them away. He accepted every one of them and branded each ruler with a soul mark.

After he was done, he took out some treasures and spiritual pills he had obtained from killing the Heavenly Master, Wan Shi, Dong Cheng, and the others to reward the new recruits.

He even gave them some top-grade chaos spirit stones as a reward.

When they saw the top-grade chaos spirit stones, they fell to their knees and thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely.

Three months passed just like that...

One day, Huang Xiaolong turned to the Heavenly Saint Ruler, and he asked, “Are there any movements from the 33 Heavens Race?”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had stayed in the Giant Kun Heavenly Country to accompany his family members, he wasn’t deaf and blind to the world. He had already sent the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler to keep a lookout on the 33 Heavens Race.

Both of them shook their heads.

It was as though the death of their deputy leader hadn’t affected them at all! Could it be that the leader of the 33 Heavens Race wasn’t concerned about the death of his second in command?

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. How was it possible for them to remain silent? It had already been a fairly long time since the incident, and the leader of the 33 Heavens Race should have already received news about Yang Tianchen’s death. They should have left the Heavens Path in anticipation of Huang Xiaolong’s retaliation. However, nothing of the sort happened. Instead, they were remaining silent...

Was the leader of the 33 Heavens Race confident in dealing with Huang Xiaolong if he showed up?

From what he had learned from Yang Tianchen’s memory, the leader of the 33 Heavens Race was an extremely secretive person. The only thing Yang Tianchen knew was that the leader was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm. He knew nothing about the secret arts the Patriarch cultivated.

“Alright, you can dismiss yourself. Continue to keep a lookout on the 33 Heavens Race.” Huang Xiaolong dismissed them after giving them a short reminder.

As soon as the two of them left, Huang Xiaolong stared in the direction of the 33 Heavens Country. He soon made up his mind to take a trip there soon.

With the strength of the 33 Heavens Race, Huang Xiaolong had to take care of them. There was no way for him to leave another ticking time bomb around him.

The moment he dealt with the 33 Heavens Race, there would be no one left to threaten the members of the Huang Family!

In the few months that he was residing in the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, Huang Xiaolong had reorganized the strength of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, the Heavenly Terror Country, and the Massacring God Heavenly Country. The strength Huang Xiaolong gathered had long surpassed the previous Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

As long as the 33 Heavens Race was taken out of the equation, there was no other power left to challenge the might of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country! After ascending to the Holy World, Huang Xiaolong could rest assured that his family would be safe.

Finally, after deciding to head over to the 33 Heavens Race, Huang Xiaolong started his preparations. With the help of the Heavenly Saint Ruler and the Mighty God Ruler, along with several experts under them, Huang Xiaolong reinforced the great formation of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

The strength of the formation increased by more than onefold compared to before!

After they were done, Huang Xiaolong passed down a series of orders to expand the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s influence. He planned to conquer all the surrounding heavenly countries before heading out.

In a mere month, every single power around the Giant Kun Heavenly Country was taken down and Huang Xiaolong built several spatial tunnels connecting them. When he connected the entire area with spatial tunnels, the defense of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country increased yet again.

When he was finally done, Huang Xiaolong bade farewell to the members of his Family. Under the reluctant gaze of his parents and Shi Xiaofei, Huang Xiaolong left the Giant Kun Heavenly Country and headed straight for the 33 Heavens Race.

This time, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother bringing anyone with him.

After settling the matter with the 33 Heavens Race, he planned to head to the space outside the 33 Heavens to locate the purple grandmist aura.

Riding on the Golden Pig Treasure, Huang Xiaolong tore through the void and charged towards the territory of the 33 Heavens Race.

According to what he had learned from Yang Tianchen’s memory, their territory was located in a space above a lightning sea on the Heavens Path.

The lightning sea wasn’t far from the space outside the 33 heavens and with their speed, Huang Xiaolong would arrive in around twenty days.

Despite the fact that he was traveling alone, he had the Golden Pig Treasure to keep him company. Along the way, he teased the pig and messed about with it to kill his boredom.

Of course, the number of top-grade chaos spirit stones he fed the Golden Treasures Pig wasn’t less.

Twenty days later, a sea of lightning appeared before them and Huang Xiaolong finally stopped.

Staring at the boundless sea, Huang Xiaolong saw countless bolts of lightning churning and rolling, forming a terrifying scene. The destructive power contained in the sea was shocking. Lightning qi tossed and turned in the space above the sea. Lightning spiritual beasts were born from the lightning qi and they quickly formed their own consciousness.

The territory of the 33 Heavens Race was located in the middle of the lightning sea. Any trespassers would need to face the assault of the countless lightning spiritual beasts born and the massive battle that would ensue would alarm the members of the 33 Heavens Race. As such, an infiltration was almost impossible. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Keeping the Golden Pig Treasure away, Huang Xiaolong flew towards the central region of the lightning sea alone. He summoned the nine great lightning pools and the lightning beast born from the fusion of the pools appeared. Along with the appearance of the majestic beast, the lightning spiritual beasts in the lightning sea parted to make a path for Huang Xiaolong. Although infiltration was nearly impossible, that only applied to other people. Huang Xiaolong didn’t meet the slightest resistance as he made his way towards the central region of the lightning sea. Half a day later, he broke through the defensive barrier and entered the 33 Heavens Country.
