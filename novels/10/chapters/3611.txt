Chapter 3612: Embroidered Pillow

Wei Chong and the others flew into a rage when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Lu Shenglin screamed, “Are you f*cking blind, you dumb*ss?! How dare you set your sights on our treasury?!”

“Master, you can’t allow this bandit to leave!” Wei Chong glared at Huang Xiaolong and he couldn’t wait to chop the man into a billion pieces.

Rong Ying and the others were surprised when they learned of Huang Xiaolong’s intentions.

Raising his hand slightly, Zhou Chi stopped his disciples from doing anything rash.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Staring at Zhou Chi, Huang Xiaolong spoke slowly, “I want every single universe-level spiritual vein you have.” Initially, he planned to trade a top-grade creation artifact for the treasures. However, since they were hell bent on painting him as a bandit, he didn’t mind becoming one.

A cold light flashed through Zhou Chi’s eyes and he growled, “You can make your move…”

Shaking his head, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “You can make the first move. Otherwise, you won’t be able to show off your strength before you’re defeated.”

Huang Xiaolong proclaimed Zhou Chi’s defeat before the battle began. That caused rage to fill Zhou Chi’s heart and he snorted in anger, “Alright, let’s see how capable you are!”

Circulating his grand cosmos energy, Zhou Chi released all 13 billion units. To be exact, he used all 13.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy he accumulated.

Under the pressure of his terrifyingly strong aura, the entire mountain started to shake. Cracks formed in the ground, and Rong Ying and the others stared at the trembling permafrost on the top of the mountain.

The heavens trembled under his might!

The wind started to howl as the void became unsteady.

Moreover, that was only what happened when Zhou Chi released his aura!

Retreating with haste, Rong Ying and the others knew that they didn’t have the ability to get caught up in a battle among experts of Zhou Chi’s level.

Even Wei Chong and the other disciples escaped.

When experts at Zhou Chi’s level battled, even the shockwaves could seriously injure God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage.

A staff made of ice appeared in Zhou Chi’s hand as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

A ray of light emerged from the staff and the temperature in the surroundings dropped significantly. Rong Ying and the others felt like their dao souls were about to be completely frozen.

The ice staff looked unassuming, but it was a top-grade creation artifact. In fact, it was close to a universe treasure!

A universe treasure was born in the universes, and there were thirteen of them in total! No one could refine a universe treasure unless they became a Universe God. Even so, there were several supreme overlords who could create treasures that were pseudo universe treasures. Even though the power of pseudo universe treasures weren’t as strong as universe treasure, it was much stronger than top-grade creation artifacts.

The ice staff in Zhou Chi’s hand had reached that level.

With his grand cosmos energy pouring into the staff, rays of light emerged from the staff and it shot straight towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t too bothered with the strike and he casually raised his hand to stop it. Ice started forming around his arms and it slowly formed around his entire body.

In the blink of an eye, he turned into an ice statue.

The layer of frost became thicker and thicker such that no one could see Huang Xiaolong’s figure. Looking at him from afar, everyone would only see a solid block of ice.

Wei Chong and the others rejoiced when they saw what happened.

They knew how powerful their master was, and even half step Universe Gods wouldn’t be able to free themselves if they were sealed up by their master.

A moment later, Zhou Chi lowered the staff in his hand.

“Congratulations, Master!” Wei Chong and the others laughed as they approached Zhou Chi.

A smile appeared on Zhou Chi’s face when he heard his disciples.

When they looked at the giant ice block before them, Zhao Mang sneered, “I thought he was strong when he dared to call master out. What a dumb*ss! Even senior brother would be able to deal with him without breaking a sweat!”

“He’s a weakling who can only run his mouth! What a loser! It’s a pity that there’s a lot of people like him in the Limitless Land.” Wei Chong snorted, “We’ll deal with him properly in honor of Qi’er!”

Zhou Chi nodded slightly. “We’ll hang him at the entrance and slice off parts of his dao heart a piece at a time!” The ice staff in his hand trembled and he declared, “I’ll seal off his grand cosmos energy right now!”

A ray of light entered the ice block in an instant.

In the distance, Rong Ying’s subordinate chuckled, “Your Majesty, that brat failed to take on a single attack from Lord Zhou Chi! He really over estimated himself this time! What a joke!”

“Not even ordinary half step Universe Gods would be able to stop Lord Zhou Chi’s frost origin qi! It doesn’t surprise me that the youngster is defeated.” Rong Ying shook his head. “I’m shocked by the fact that he couldn’t even take a single strike.

He was definitely disappointed in his heart.

However, the block of ice trembled slightly before their very eyes.

Everyone was shocked.

Soon after, the trembling became more intense as cracks started to form on its surface. Gasping slightly, Zhou Chi released his frost origin qi again in an attempt to seal Huang Xiaolong. It was completely useless as the cracks became even larger.

A ray of golden light tore through the skies all of a sudden and a terrifying wave of power filled the air.

Not even Zhou Chi could withstand the blast as he was sent flying through the air. Everyone from the Ice Mountain was sent smashing into the mountain range.

Rong Ying, Wang Xin, and the others were thrown god knew how many miles away.

When they finally found their footing, the ice block was nowhere to be seen as Huang Xiaolong’s figure could be seen in mid alr.

Zhou Chi’s eyes widened in shock and he gasped, “How could you…”

“Do you really think that you could seal me with your pitiful strength?” Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I didn’t stop your attack because I wanted to see how strong you were.”

Zhou Chi’s expression sank.

Huang Xiaolong no longer wanted to waste his time and he appeared before Zhou Chi with a single step.

Frowning in shock, Zhou Chi wanted to defend himself with his ice staff but it was useless. Huang Xiaolong grabbed the staff with his left hand before plunging his right claw through Zhou Chi’s chest.

The top-grade creation artifact armor around Zhou Chi’s chest was burned to ashes with the flame surrounding Huang Xiaolong’s arm.
