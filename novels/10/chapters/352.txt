Chapter 353: Not One of Them Leaves

A loud boom rendered the air...

Yao Fei’s punch hit Huang Xiaolong’s chest accurately, right above the heart! The crowd was dumbfounded seeing Huang Xiaolong remaining still as if he really planned to use his flesh to withstand Yao Fei’s full force attack.

Including Yao Fei himself. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to really stand still and receive his strongest attack head-on merely relying on his body’s defense.

But in the next moment, everyone’s eyes nearly fell out of their sockets. Huang Xiaolong, who took Yao Fei’s full force punch on the chest, remained standing, stable as a mountain.

Yao Shan, the three Deities Templar Elders, Wang Cong, and those around were agape, astounded. The inn owner’s breathing became short-winded.

Catching the shock flitting passed Yao Fei’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Surprised? Although I was just a Xiantian Second Order a few years ago, sorry to disappoint, but my strength now indeed surpasses yours.” A powerful surge of energy surged from Huang Xiaolong’s chest, sending Yao Fei tumbling back , flying to a corner.

“Fei’er!” Yao Shan cried out, but just as he was about to catch Yao Fei from falling, a violent power locked onto him. Alarmed, Yao Shan immediately countered with his palm striking out. The collision forced Yao Shan back several steps.

After he regained balance, Yao Shan glared furiously at Zhao Shu. it was none other than Zhao Shu who hindered him from helping Yao Fei just now.

At this point, Yao Fei was sent flying out the doorway, crashing onto the street outside, the pavement shattered and zig-zag lines crawled the street due to the strong impact. Yao Fei’s Deities Templar Elder robe was dyed red with the blood from his mouth, the majestic black flames shrouding his body faded to a dull color.

Huang Xiaolong sneered watching Yao Fei crash on the street outside. Lifting his foot, Huang Xiaolong slowly walked toward Yao Fei.

When he killed Ao Baixue, he was still a peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order, now that he had broken through to Saint realm, even a Second Order Saint realm would be harried to injure him, what more an infant Saint realm warrior such as Yao Fei? In short, to kill a newly broken through Saint realm warrior like Yao Fei, Huang Xiaolong need not even summon his martial spirits.

However, at this time, an angry roar came from Yao Shan as he lunged forward to attack Huang Xiaolong. But, the moment he moved, Zhao Shu was already blocking in front of his path, deflecting Yao Shan’s attack away from Huang Xiaolong.

A battle ensued between the three Deities Templar Elders and Duan Ren’s group.

Destructive energy rippled inside the inn, spreading out to nearby restaurants and shops, their structures were pulverized into sand and dust, and pieces of street pavement flipped into the air.

Experts watching from the sidelines that dodged too slow had only one ending—their bodies exploded, turning into blood-rain splattering down on the streets. High-level Xiantian realm warriors were no exception.

Although high-level Xiantian realm warriors’ fleshly bodies were powerful, in front of Saint realm experts, they were nothing but paper tiger.

Yao Fei struggled to stand up with awkward movements. Watching Huang Xiaolong gradually coming closer to him, the hatred in Yao Fei’s eyes grew more intense, an enraged roar rang harsh, “Why?! Why! I don’t believe, I refuse to believe!!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The dark black flames around his body became vivid once more, shrouding the immediate proximity, expanding to a larger area like they wanted to swallow Huang Xiaolong whole into the darkness.

Despite that, when the dark black flames got close to Huang Xiaolong, they seemed to meet with an invisible barrier and were forced to circumvent him.

Huang Xiaolong continued to approach Yao Fei, the look in his eyes icy. In a quick flash, the Eminent Holiness Halberd appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s palm, thrusting out at Yao Fei and raising layers of waves that overwhelmed the dark black flames, sending them back towards their owner.

In the next second, halberd shadows overcast the sky, falling down like a brilliant meteor shower. Before anyone could see what happened, the Eminent Holiness Halberd had pierced through Yao Fei’s torso.

“Fei’er!” Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s had halberd pierced through Yao Fei’s chest, Yao Shan was both anxious and angry. Unfortunately, in that split second of distraction, Zhao Shu landed a punch on him, sending Yao Shan flying in the opposite direction.

Despite being the Yao Family’s Ancestor and having advanced into the Saint realm for many years, cultivating until the Sixth Order Saint realm, how could Yao Shan be Zhao Shu’s opponent? Hence, he ended up just like Yao Fei, defeated in a few breaths’ time.

Huang Xiaolong did not immediately pull out the Eminent Holiness Halberd after it pierced through Yao Fei’s torso. His left wrist twisted the halberd’s long handle and the Eminent Holiness Halberd rotated at high speed, like a drill, grinding Yao Fei’s internal organs into pieces.

The Eminent Holiness Halberd kept rotating, Yao Fei felt excruciating pain exploding in every part of his body, raw anguished howls rose from his throat. The Rising Sun Castellan, Wang Cong, turned white as a sheet watching Yao Fei’s tragic situation, cold sweat soaked through his robe.

The surrounding experts felt cold shivers in their hearts watching Yao Fei’s miserable appearance. Looking at Huang Xiaolong, there was only fear and horror in their eyes.

After shattering Yao Fei’s internal organs, Huang Xiaolong pulled out the Eminent Holiness Halberd and Yao Fei stumbled backward, out of balance. A large hole could be seen in his chest, yet Yao Fei was still moving. He glared at Huang Xiaolong as he steadied his feet, his bloodshot eyes screaming for murder, his hatred took over any fear of death.

Yao Fei’s hand reached up, wiping away the blood flowing from his mouth, grinning in a disturbing manner, “Huang Xiaolong, you think you can save Li Lu by killing me? I know you planned to rescue Li Lu during the Deities Templar’s next disciple selection, but let me tell you, you can never save Li Lu as long as you live, never ever!” Yao Fei’s face was distorted with menace.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong remained unmoved.

Yao Fei sneered, regardless of Huang Xiaolong’s reaction, “To tell you the truth, Li Lu is already our Deities Templar’s Holy Maiden, the successor to the Temple Preceptor’s position!”

A tiny frown appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows, Ao Baixue uttered the very same words before. This was also the very thing that had been worrying him in recent days.

‘Li Lu probably already has...?!’

Huang Xiaolong strode toward Yao Fei, stopping ten meters away from him with the Eminent Holiness Halberd readied in his hand as his frigid voice sounded: “Last words?”

Yao Fei snickered, “Be arrogant and audacious all you want now, when the time comes, you will still kneel before Deities Templar, begging for mercy. No one who goes against Deities Templar has a good ending!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t speak another word. He leaped up, the Eminent Holiness Halberd in his hand thrust out, aimed accurately between Yao Fei’s eyebrows.

A blinding black light flashed in front of Yao Fei and a half-meter wide, one-meter tall black-colored space appeared in front of him, acting as a shield. This was Yao Fei’s Saint realm space.

But to Yao Fei’s aghast, the long halberd in Huang Xiaolong’s hand pierced right through his Saint realm space in the blink of an eye, straight to his temple.

Huang Xiaolong exerted a little more force in his right hand, propelling the Eminent Holiness Halberd deeper into Yao Fei’s brain, then directed the true essence fire along the halberd to enter Yao Fei’s consciousness and incinerate his soul.

Yao Fei stiffened wholly, his eyes grew dull as the light left his pupils.

“Fei’er!” Yao Shan’s heart-wrenching cry reverberated in the air.

Yao Fei carried all of Yao Family’s hope. With much difficulty, Yao Fei finally broke into the Saint realm. Watching Yao Fei’s lifeless body tumbling down, it was akin to watching the Yao Family’s future collapse right in front of his eyes.

The crowd was stupefied witnessing Yao Fei’s death.

“Go!” At this time, one of the Deities Templar Elder fighting with Duan Ren’s group shouted to his comrades. Things had gone too far beyond their expectation, and if they didn’t leave now, it might be too late to leave later.

“Keep them here, not one of them leaves!” Huang Xiaolong bellowed.

But exactly at this moment, a green ray of light arrived, tearing through space, landing right in front of Huang Xiaolong.

“Young Lord, careful!” Zhao Shu dashed in front of Huang Xiaolong, forcefully blocking the green ray of light.

Then, another burst of blinding light appeared on the scene. When it disappeared, a beautiful woman entered their sightㅡLi Molin.

When Li Molin arrived, her face was terribly grim seeing Yao Fei’s body lying close by.
