Chapter 2038: Du Hai’s Assistance

It was no wonder he would think about killing Huang Xiaolong for the treasure. One had to know that a mid-level origin treasure had allowed Lord Wan Shi to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm. It was the reason he had become the strongest expert under the heavens!

If Huang Xiaolong really managed to obtain a mid-rank origin treasure, there was no way he could refine it in three years. The medicinal properties of the mid-rank origin treasure had to be stored in his body. Du Hai felt that devouring Huang Xiaolong would be equivalent to refining the mid-rank origin treasure.

Even though he wouldn’t be able to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm immediately, he would definitely be able to increase his cultivation in the next ten thousand years. Moreover, his injuries would definitely heal without leaving behind side effects. There would no longer be a need for him to hide in a secluded world surface near the Devil Abyss!

However, the little cow and the King of Darkness were no fools. They felt the killing intent from Du Hai’s body,, and they quickly stood beside Huang Xiaolong to protect him. Their auras locked down and pressed down on Du Hai without intentions of letting up.

“Old man, are you thinking about making a move?” The little cow snorted. Purple lightning covered her body as her horns emitted a chilly light.

Darkness enveloped the King of Darkness as rays of black light shattered the waves of devil qi around the cliff.

Du Hai chuckled under his breath and didn’t respond.

Instead, Huang Xiaolong was the one to break the silence. “Du Hai, didn’t you want to know my identity? Let me tell you right now.”

Under Du Hai’s shocked gaze, the Heart of Hell emitted blinding rays of black light that pushed away all the devil qi in their surroundings. In an instant, it seemed as though they were transported to Hell.

“This... this... This is the Heart of Hell!” Du Hai felt a bomb going off in his head.

“That’s right. It’s the Heart of Hell.” Huang Xiaolong explained, “I accepted the King of Hell’s inheritance. I am the current King of Hell, and I rule over all three worlds in Hell.”

Du Hai, Du Chen, and the other members of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race sucked in a cold breath in shock.

Even though they were a superpower that had the ability to shake the Heavenly Court, they had to change their tune when someone like the King of Hell appeared.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Du Hai coldly as he continued, “I’m not trying to boast, but even without the little cow and the King of Darkness, you won’t be able to kill me. I have the Heart of Hell, and with my strength at the Seventh Order Emperor Realm, I can fully utilize the Heart of Hell. As long as it exists, I will never die. Also... The Heart of Hell isn’t the only treasure I possess.” After he spoke, the sixteen wings appeared on his back.

Boundless radiance energy surged out and filled the space around him.

Devil qi that lingered in the air around them dissipated, and the gloominess that seemed to cover the lands disappeared. Radiance energy purified the area within a hundred million miles, and it was as though Huang Xiaolong had turned into a mini sun.

“Sixteen Wings!” Du Hai gasped in shock.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I also received the inheritance from the Radiance Ancestor. I can use the origin energies of both Hell and the Radiance World. Do you think you can kill me?”

Du Hai found it impossible to cover up the shock he felt.

He had both the inheritance from the King of Hell and the Radiance Ancestor!

Huang Xiaolong stared at Du Hai with a cold gaze as he knew what Du Hai wanted to do.

“You can drop any ideas of trying to kill me.” Huang Xiaolong scoffed. “Moreover, those aren’t all the strength I possess.”

He summoned all three supreme godheads, and they soared into the air above him. The moment they appeared, a suffocating pressure pressed down on everyone present. They seemed to be able to support the weight of the heavens and subdue any beasts. Even the devil beasts all around them got to their knees.

“Three... Three Supreme Godheads!” Du Hai and the other members of his race screamed in fright.

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t done as he activated the three Archdevil bloodlines in him. Three Archdevil phantoms appeared around Huang Xiaolong.

“Three Archdevil bloodlines?!” Du Hai and Du Chen yelled in shock once again as the other experts of their race felt their legs going soft.

Huang Xiaolong continued to ask, “So, are you sure you can kill me?” Now that he had broken into the Seventh Order Emperor Realm, Huang Xiaolong’s strength had increased by an extremely large margin. Even if he wasn’t in Hell, he could call on the origin strength in hell.

Even if Sovereigns were to appear, it wasn’t likely they would be able to do anything to him.

If someone like Shi Ming punched his heart with all he got, he might not even be able to shatter it. The only way for someone like Shi Ming could destroy his Heart of Hell was by attacking it dozens of times at full strength.

Right now, Huang Xiaolong found no need to lower himself in front of Du Hai any longer.

The confidence he had was at a level that allowed him to do as he wished. He was no longer banking everything he had on the little cow and the King of Darkness.

Of course, there was a reason why Huang Xiaolong would summon all his trump cards.

“Du Hai, how about making another deal with me?” Huang Xiaolong retrieved his godheads and treasures before deactivating his Archdevil bloodlines.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s presence was subdued, Du Hai felt a mountain pressing down on his chest.

He cupped his hands and said respectfully, “King of Hell, please go ahead...”

There was a complicated look in his eyes when he looked at Huang Xiaolong. There was no longer scorn in his eyes as he quickly raised Huang Xiaolong’s position in his heart.

The shocking scene replayed again and again in his mind. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Even though I have managed to obtain the two great inheritances, I have failed to unify both Hell and the Radiance World. The strongest power in Hell is the Nine Yin Giant CorpseTribe, and the strongest power in the Radiance World is the previous world leader, Dun Ei.”

Huang Xiaolong quickly explained the situation to Du Hai without intentions of hiding anything from him.

The more they listened, the greater was their shock. They had never expected a great war to be going down as they spoke. Moreover, both camps had managed to gather so many Sovereigns and overlords of various worlds!

Even someone like the Reverence Moon Old Man had left seclusion!

After introducing the situation to them, Huang Xiaolong asked, “If you are willing to help me, I will give you another five hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones after I unify the Radiance World!”

“What?! Five hundred million?!” Du Hai couldn’t contain himself. His surprised yell echoed through the air.

“That’s right. In fact, I can give you three hundred million upfront.” Huang Xiaolong nodded in reassurance. “After I unify the Radiance World, you can choose to stay. I wouldn’t force you if you wish to leave, and as long as you come over to help me, we shall leave all grievances behind us.”

Light sparkled in Du Hai’s eyes as he turned to look at the three Sovereigns around Huang Xiaolong. He gnashed his teeth and nodded his head. “Fine! Deal!”

He was more than willing to make a move. In fact, he didn’t care much about the five hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones. The moment Huang Xiaolong revealed his three supreme godheads and three Archdevil bloodlines, Du Hai already had an idea in mind.

With Huang Xiaolong’s talent, it was a matter of time before Huang Xiaolong became the world’s strongest individual. According to Du Hai, there was no doubt Huang Xiaolong would surpass Lord Wan Shi in the future.

Right now, he would be sowing a seed of gratitude if he agreed to help Huang Xiaolong.
