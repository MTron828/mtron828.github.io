Chapter 370: Swear Allegiance to Deities Templar?

“Cancel our tryout eligibility?” Huang Xiaolong was stumped, while Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu smiled as they exchanged a helpless smile.

The palace guard became angry seeing the people he just reprimanded laughing instead of being afraid; these people actually dared to ignore him? He was a small squad leader of the palace guards! Even big families’ Elders greet him with courtesy when seeing him.

He walked up to Huang Xiaolong: “What is your name? Punk, which family do you belong to? Roll over there for me now!” A finger pointed to a square corner, “Stand there for one hour, and then you can go line up to register your name!”

The palace guard ordered, cool and domineering. Because he did not purposely restrain his voice, it attracted the attention of many other people that came to register, palace guards and families’ disciples alike looked over at their direction.

Roll?

Stand for one hour?

Huang Xiaolong looked at the domineering palace guard, unable to decide if he should laugh or be angry.

“And if I don’t stand there for one hour?” Huang Xiaolong asked, a faint smile tugged the corners of his lips.

That small squad leader’s expression turned brooding dark, “Are you sure?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded: “I’m very sure.”

With other palace guards and families’ disciples watching, the small squad leader’s anger soared to its peak, a small disciple that came to register actually dared to challenge his authority in public?

“You can scram now, your tryout registration eligibility is rescinded!” He shouted at Huang Xiaolong, “And call the Elder of your family here, I want to see which family actually brought up a stupid and ignorant disciple like you!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, he was too lazy to bother with this person; he continued walking toward the palace doors with Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu.

Watching this, the small squad leader’s face turned maroon beet-red with rage, his hand drew the cutlass hanging at his waist in quick action, “Punk, trespassing into the palace grounds, you’re seeking death!” Infusing the cutlass with battle qi, the small squad leader leaped forward, wanting to slash Huang Xiaolong’s back. As a small squad leader, he did possess some strength, being a Houtian Tenth Order. Battle qi broke out as he slashed right at Huang Xiaolong’ back.

Sensing his attack’s success, the small squad leader breathed in relief. He originally thought that Huang Xiaolong had some strength, to dare come make trouble at the palace, perhaps there might even be some problems in taking care of him, but it was easier than he had imagined.

“So, you’re nothing more than an embroidered pillow, nice to see but of no use!” The small squad leader laughed aloud. However, just as the first note of laughter sounded, the cutlass’ energy that slashed into Huang Xiaolong rebounded.

Seeing his attack being rebound, the small squad leader was frightened, leaping back hastily to dodge it. The attack energy flew past his face, millimetres away from his skin. Even so, his back dampened from cold sweat.

He glared at Huang Xiaolong, veiling his embarrassment with anger, “They want to trespass into the palace grounds, everyone attack, kill them!”

The surrounding palace guards recovered from their shock, unsheathing the swords and blades in their hands and aimed attacks at Huang Xiaolong’s group of three.

At this point, Huang Xiaolong looked over, his eyes icy. Since they chose this, then the blame was not on him. Raising both his hands, his palms struck out.

Before many pairs of horrified eyes, fiendish Asura qi flooded out, transforming into an underworld evil dragon. The evil dragon merely hovered in the air, but all the guards were thrown back. When these palace guards fell to the ground, their bodies were black, twitching, and wailing in pain.

Huang Xiaolong’s Saint realm Asura qi was more terrifying than it used to be, not even a Fourth Order Saint realm expert could resist his Asura Qi, what more these measly palace guards.

Initially, those families’ disciples that came to register for the palace guards tryout were gloating inside watching Huang Xiaolong as he dared to anger a small squad leader, but just when they thought that Huang Xiaolong was dead for sure, the result shocked everyone, they were rooted blankly on the spot.

Dread filled their eyes as they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

At the same time, inside the Luo Tong Kingdom Palace’s great hall, laughter and music filled the air, it was an extremely festive atmosphere.

In the great hall, a group of palace maids was playing musical instruments and dancing, swaying their hips and twisting their naked bellies.

On the King’s throne sat an old man with a ruddy, glowing face, and silvery white hair, looking quite dignified. At this moment, he was staring fixedly at the dancers’ exposed bellies, a twinkle flitting across his eyes from time to time.

This old man was none other than Deities Templar’s Great Elder, Gě Gé.

There were a total of nine Great Elders in Deities Templar, each one was a Tenth Order Saint realm and above, possessing strength parallel with their status. And below the throne, sat ten Deities Templar Elders.

Killing Lu Kai three years ago, other than Ao Baixue being part of the reason, Deities Templar also wanted to lure Huang Xiaolong out, even sending Gě Gé and ten Elders to a small kingdom such as Luo Tong Kingdom, lying in wait for Huang Xiaolong to appear.

Amongst the ten Deities Templar Elders within the hall, Yao Shan was one of them.

His most brilliant descendent, Yao Fei, had been killed by Huang Xiaolong, thus Yao Shan requested to be one of the Elders watching over Luo Tong Kingdom. He wanted to severe Huang Xiaolong’s head from his shoulders with his own hands, it was the only way the hatred in his heart could be pacified.

“Everyone, please.” Gě Gé raised his wine cup, toasting the Elders.

Yao Shan and the other Elders followed, raising their wine cups for a toast, downing it all in one gulp.

Gě Gé placed his wine cup down, smacking his lips and grinning, “This Snow Moon Wine, I really like it.”

This sentence brought murmurs of assent from the Elders below.

Yao Shan spoke, “We’ve been waiting here for three years, I didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong, that punk, to hide for three years, too cowardly to show up. No one knows where he’s hiding at.”

An Elder, Jiang Shi, that was sitting beside Yao Shan chuckled, “He’s afraid of our Deities Templar, however, if he actually succeeded the Asura’s Gate Sovereign position, it would quite troublesome to our Deities Templar.”

Gě Gé laughed with dismissive tone, “No need to worry, he won’t succeed Asura’s Gate Sovereign position, that Chen Tianqi joined hands with Bedlam Lands’ Sin City Castellan, Zhao Yi, and not long ago, our Temple Preceptor has sent Elder Li Molin over to the Asura’s Gate headquarters. A heaven’s net has been set up, just waiting for Huang Xiaolong to jump in. The instant he dares to appear, he’s dead!”

Exactly at this moment, a powerful energy fluctuation came from the palace doors outside. Everyone was surprised and exchanged looks among themselves.

“There are people who dare to cause trouble in Luo Tong Palace?” Jiang Shi said.

“Could it be Huang Xiaolong? He’s finally here!” Yao Shan blurted as the thought flashed through his mind.

Expressions tightened at the possibility.

Gě Gé stood up from the throne seat, sneering coldly, “Huang Xiaolong? Better still if it’s him! We’ve been waiting for this day for three years. Come, let’s us go welcome Martial Spirit World’s most dazzling monstrous genius of all time!”

Everyone got on their feet, flying out from the hall, heading straight to the palace’s main doors.

At the same time, at the palace’s main doors, Huang Xiaolong stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the palace great hall structure with a taunting smile, “Eleven Saint realm experts? Deities Templar really puts me on a high pedestal.”

A bright light flickered, Gě Gé and the ten Elders appeared in the space above the palace’s main doors. The moment those eleven Saint realm experts appeared, a suffocating pressure enveloped the whole square. Before some of the palace guards and families’ disciples could react, their bodies exploded from the pressure, and the rest fled in horror.

“You’re Huang Xiaolong?” Gě Gé scrutinized Huang Xiaolong from head to toe upon arrival.

“Correct.” Huang Xiaolong replied calmly.

“Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t expect you to really dare to show up here!” Yao Shan sneered, “Today’s your end! Let me see if you can still flee this time!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Gě Gé signaled the ten Elders with his eyes, and they all spread out, encircling Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu.

Gě Gé stared at Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, saying, “Both of you are probably Asura’s Gate Left and Right Custodians. Truth be told, there is no advantage for you to risk your life for Huang Xiaolong. If you’re willing to swear allegiance to Deities Templar, we will definitely treat you justly.”
