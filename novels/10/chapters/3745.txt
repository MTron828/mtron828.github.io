Chapter 3746: Huang Xiaolong Is Also Here

“Dragon Soul Mountain?” Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity was piqued immediately.

The Dragon Soul Mountain was the Dragon Emperor Land’s sacred land, and within the Dragon Soul Mountain was the Origin Universe’s most ancient dragon soul. This dragon soul was born around the same time as the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, but because of some circumstances or reason, this dragon soul had lost its physical body.

This dragon soul had been living inside the Dragon Soul Mountain ever since, and it was referred to as the dragon source. If an expert with a dragon bloodline could capture this dragon soul to refine and absorb it, the benefits were unimaginable.

However, absorbing and integrating the dragon soul into oneself was easier said than done, just like the Dragon Sage Human Emperor who had no success after so many years of trying.

Due to the existence of this dragon soul source, many Dragon Race experts who lost their physical bodies in the Origin Universe would escape into the Dragon Soul Mountain to hide. As time passed, other than the initial dragon soul, there were other dragon souls of various levels in the Dragon Soul Mountain.

At normal times, the Dragon Soul Mountain was enshrouded by the dragon soul source’s dragon qi. Hence, no one could enter the Dragon Soul Mountain. However, at every certain period, the dragon qi barrier around the Dragon Soul Mountain would weaken for some time. This is when the people outside the barrier said that Dragon Soul Mountain was awakening. During this awakening time frame, any God of Creation would be able to break into the Dragon Soul Mountain.

Thus, during this time, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and many God of Creation experts would swarm into the Dragon Soul Mountain to look for dragon souls suitable for themselves in order to tame and absorb them. This was all for increasing their strength.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils gleamed. Since the Dragon Sage Human Emperor would be going to the Dragon Soul Mountain, he didn’t need to make the long trip to the Dragon Emperor City.

His current location wasn’t far from the said Dragon Soul Mountain, and it would take Huang Xiaolong only half a month to reach the mountain at most.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong changed his destination and made his way to the Dragon Soul Mountain instead.

Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong stood looking at the Dragon Soul Mountain some distance away.

The Dragon Soul Mountain was actually a great mountain range that stretched into the horizon. At a single glance, one could hardly see the edge of it. No one could really tell how many miles of land made the Dragon Soul Mountain, except that the mountain range encompassed one-third of the Dragon Emperor Land!

One-third of the land!

On top of that, the Dragon Emperor Land has the biggest land surface in the Origin Universe.

When Huang Xiaolong reached the Dragon Soul Mountain, the Dragon Soul Mountain had already awakened. Experts from various corners of Dragon Emperor Land and Origin Universe had rushed inside.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong inquired around and learned the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and experts from the Dragon Saint Palace had already gone into the Dragon Soul Mountain.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to enter the Dragon Soul Mountain, a group of experts appeared and the leader was actually Domineering Blade Xihu.

Domineering Blade Xihu was leading several hundred subordinates to enter the Dragon Soul Mountain when he spotted the familiar figure up ahead. A violent shiver ran down his body.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Domineering Blade Xihu blurted out subconsciously, and because he was used to talking loudly, his exclamation was heard by many experts who were also entering the Dragon Soul Mountain.

In an instant, the atmosphere outside the Dragon Soul Mountain exploded.

“Huang Xiaolong? Is he the same Huang Xiaolong who kidnapped the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?!”

“Which one is Huang Xiaolong?!!”

“His Majesty Dragon Sage Human Emperor has ordered that anyone who finds Huang Xiaolong will be rewarded with ten peak-level Dragon Race’s universe origin spiritual veins! And they can also choose a treasure from the Dragon Emperor’s treasury!”

After a brief moment of shock and disarray, almost all gazes followed Domineering Blade Xihu’s line of sight and locked onto Huang Xiaolong.

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong became the center of attention among these thousands and thousands of experts.

Huang Xiaolong furrowed in dislike. He turned and glanced at the Domineering Blade Xihu. Merely a glance caused Domineering Blade Xihu to plummet from high air.

Fear was clearly written on Domineering Blade Xihu’s face, and pangs of regret twisted his gut, as he chided himself for his lack of control over his mouth.

While Domineering Blade Xihu was filled with fear and regret, Huang Xiaolong turned and sped into the Dragon Soul Mountain, disappearing from sight in the blink of an eye.

Domineering Blade Xihu was stupefied for a second.

He initially thought that Huang Xiaolong suddenly looked at him to slap him!

After all, the scene where Huang Xiaolong sent the Treasure Sage Human Emperor crashing into the base of Big River Mountain with one palm strike was still clear in his mind.

Other experts were too stunned to react after Huang Xiaolong disappeared into the Dragon Soul Mountain, they exchanged glances, and none of them dared to chase after Huang Xiaolong in the end. Quite a few of them were experts over the twenty billion mark like Domineering Blade Xihu.

Several hundred thousand experts stood silently even after Huang Xiaolong had left, but a while later, when everyone was certain that he had truly left, they were in a furor.

“Huang Xiaolong actually came to Dragon Soul Mountain! What is he doing here? Is he coveting the dragon soul source?” a family’s old ancestor took a wild guess.

“The dragon soul source belongs to His Majesty Dragon Sage Human Emperor. How dare he covet it? He is really overestimating himself!”

“There are numerous Origin Universe experts in the Dragon Soul Mountain, yet Huang Xiaolong has the guts to show up here. He is seeking to die fast!”

All the experts were talking about Huang Xiaolong.

Before long, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, who had entered the Dragon Soul Mountain earlier than Huang Xiaolong, learned that he had entered the mountain.

“Oh, Huang Xiaolong is also here?” the Dragon Sage Human Emperor wondered out loud.

“Huang Xiaolong’s got guts. Despite knowing that His Majesty is within the Dragon Soul Mountain, he dares to appear! From what others are saying, he should be here for the dragon soul source!” a Dragon Saint Palace’s marshal stated.

“I say he’s purely here to die!” Another Dragon Saint Palace’s marshal sneered with disdain.

Dragon Sage Human Emperor spoke objectively, “He must have a certain level of confidence since he dares to show up here. I must get the dragon soul source this time! Pass my order to obtain Huang Xiaolong’s exact location. After getting the dragon soul source, I will check him out myself.”

“Yes, Your Majesty Dragon Sage Human Emperor!”

……

Upon entering the Dragon Soul Mountain, Huang Xiaolong did not stop anywhere. His dao souls spread out as he moved deeper into the mountain, searching for the Dragon Sage Human Emperor.

The dragon soul source was located in the deepest part of the mountain. Therefore, if the Dragon Sage Human Emperor wanted to get the dragon soul source, he would be heading in that direction.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong encountered more than a few powerful dragon souls. To the general half-step Universe God, these dragon souls were treasures, but to Huang Xiaolong, they were useless.

As Huang Xiaolong did not conceal his aura or movements, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor continuously received reports on his location.

“Oh, Huang Xiaolong is coming to the deepest part of Dragon Soul Mountain?” Dragon Sage Human Emperor was surprised. “He really came for the Dragon soul source!”

“Your Majesty, should this subordinate go and deal with Huang Xiaolong?” the Dragon Saint Palace’s grand marshal inquired.

Dragon Sage Human Emperor shook his head. “There is no need. It is more important for me to integrate with the dragon soul source at this point. Moreover, even if all of you join hands, you might not be Huang Xiaolong’s match.”

“Tell the people to continue watching Huang Xiaolong.”

Dragon Sage Human Emperor continued advancing further with the experts from Dragon Saint Palace, while trying to sense the dragon soul source’s location with a dragon pearl he had refined. The group finally reached a huge cliff wall.

This enormous cliff wall stretched several hundred thousand miles wide, and from afar, it looked like a barricade that prevented others from crossing and moving forward.
