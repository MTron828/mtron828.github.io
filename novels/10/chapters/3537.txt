Chapter 3538: Too Late

Huang Xiaolong’s expression didn’t change in the slightest as he sneered softly, “I’ll cripple you before they arrive.”

Their faces changed in an instant.

As their figures started to blur, they tried to retreat.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was much faster. Tossing the Sun Moon Furnace out along with the Purple Lightning Peak, Huang Xiaolong sent them towards Chu Long and Kong Wufang, respectively. The two of them were crushed into the earth and the ground shattered below them.

The two artifacts had been raised to the mid-grade universe artifact level, and they spat out mouthfuls of blood after they were struck.

“Mid-grade universe artifacts!” Chu Long and Kong Wufang were shocked. Huang Xiaolong was supposed to be a God of Creation at the small completion stage, and it would be amazing if he got himself a single low-grade universe artifact! Two mid-grade artifacts were too much!

Huang Xiaolong turned around and spoke to Han Zaifei, “You should leave.”

“Fellow cultivator Huang, you…”

“Leave. I’ll hold the members of the Creation Palace back,” Huang Xiaolong added.

Han Zaifei started to hesitate.

“Leave now!” Huang Xiaolong snapped when he realized the man wasn’t planning to make a decision soon.

Trembling slightly, Han Zaifei no longer hesitated. He cupped his fists at Huang Xiaolong as a show of respect, and he bowed. “Fellow cultivator Huang, I will always remember your goodwill.”

After he spoke, he tore through the air.

The moment he moved, Chu Long and Kong Wufang tried to stop him. It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was a step faster, and he crushed them into the ground before they could do anything.

Han Zaifei disappeared into the vast space above them in an instant.

“Huang Xiaolong, even if he manages to escape, you won’t be leaving here today!” A sinister smile appeared on Chu Long’s face. “Do you really think that Han Zaifei will thank you after you hold us back here today?! He’s going to be laughing at how stupid you are!”

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “There’s no need for you to worry about that.” Naturally, Huang Xiaolong was no fool. The only reason he allowed Han Zaifei to leave was that he was afraid his secrets would be leaked.

The moment Han Zaifei left, there would be nothing holding him back! He could kill to his heart’s content when the members of the Creation Palace arrived!

With his strength, only peak-level God of Creation Realm experts, or half-step Universe Gods would pose a threat! Other than experts at that level, they could send as many as they want and Huang Xiaolong would kill them all!

Since Chu Long and Kong Wufang told the members of the Creation Palace that Huang Xiaoloong was present, they wouldn’t send experts at Kun Feng’s level over to deal with him. After all, he was a mere God of Creation at the small completion stage.

With a single step, he appeared before them.

“Die!” Chu Long and Kong Wufang looked at each other before summoning their weapons. Chu Long used a giant hammer while Kong Wufang used a sharp spike.

The two of them pincered Huang Xiaolong from the left and right as they launched their attacks.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Since Han Zaifei was gone, there was no longer a need to hide his strength. He circulated the Soaring Dragon Art and Blazing Dragon Grand Art at the same time, as grand cosmos energy poured out from two great worlds!

Close to 6 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body, shocking Chu Long and Kong Wufang.

“This?!”

“Two great worlds!”

Huang Xiaolong was like Mei Jie of the Creation Palace, and he possessed two great worlds!

When the two of them were still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong’s Sun Moon Furnace and Purple Lightning Peak arrived above their heads. It slammed into them, and their creation artifacts were sent flying. Like two meteors, they shot out towards other planets.

After smashing heavily into the distant planets, their armors were shattered beyond belief. Blood leaked from all seven orifices from their bodies, and terrifying scars filled their bodies.

If not for the fact that Huang Xiaolong retrieved a huge chunk of his power before he struck them, they would have turned into meat paste.

Once again, Huang Xiaolong appeared before them.

The looks on their faces were no longer the same when they looked at the monster that was standing before them. Fear filled their eyes and their hearts trembled with fear.

Mei Jie was the only God of Creation who had two great worlds, but Huang Xiaolong had broken that legend!

“Huang… Huang Xiaolong…” Chu Long started to stutter, “If you let us go, we swear that we’ll keep your secret! We’ll even hold the experts of the Creation Palace back while you leave!”

No one knew if he was too seriously injured or if the fear had clouded his mind, as his words weren’t clear.

“There’s no need for that.” Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive as he reached out with both hands. When his palm strike landed on their chests, they were sent flying once again. Dragging them back, Huang Xiaolong sealed their grand cosmos energy before throwing them into the Sun Moon Furnace.

He wasn’t in a rush to leave either. He started to lay down countless formations to wait for the experts of the Creation Palace.

With three dao souls covering the area, he quickly discovered the experts of the Creation Palace. There were three of them who came, and all of them were in the large completion stage. The strongest of the three had 5 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and the other two were closing in on 4 billion units.

The only thing more exciting than taking the three of them down was the fact that the strongest of the three had the Huang Long Bloodline!

Ao Yan!

Huang Xiaolong recalled their identities instantly as there were only five Gods of Creation with the Huang Long Bloodline in the First Universe. Two of them belonged to the Creation Palace, and Ao Yan was one of them! As for the other, it was Ao Yan’s father, Ao Ying. Ao Ying was at the peak of the God of Creation Realm, and he was comparable to Pangu in strength!

Very quickly, the three of them arrived.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong standing there casually, they were shocked. They didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would wait for them to arrive!

“Huang Xiaolong, where’s Chu Long and Kong Wufang?!” Ao Yan was the first to speak.

The other two started to spread out as they were afraid that Huang Xiaolong would try to escape.

Releasing the restriction in the Sun Moon Furnace, the three of them saw the sorry figures of Chu Long and Kong Wufang.

They were shocked.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Lord Ao Yan, you have to leave! Huang Xiaolong has two great worlds!” Chu Long screamed.

“What?! Two… Two great worlds?!” Ao Yan and the other two stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. If Huang Xiaolong had two great worlds, wouldn’t that mean that he had nearly 6 billion units of grand cosmos energy?!

The three of them frowned as the idea of retreating formed in their minds.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the looks on their faces.

“It’s too late for you to leave.” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I laid down several grand formations in the area. There’s no way I’ll let you escape.”
