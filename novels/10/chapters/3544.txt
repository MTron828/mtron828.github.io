Chapter 3545: Marriage

 

“Heh, are you crazy? Do you really think that you’re capable of giving me a horrible death?!” Ao Ying sneered. He swept his gaze across Wang Meiqi and the others as a look of contempt surfaced. “Are you planning to send the three of them to their deaths?” 

As a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, he had close to 9.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy! He didn’t really care if Ao Shenghai and the others were to attack him in unison.

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “I am more than enough to deal with you alone.”

As the members of the Creation Palace roared with laughter, Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong frowned. They thought that Huang Xiaolong was someone who liked to keep a low profile when he entered the alliance. Now, they changed their views on him.

“I’ll wait for that day…” Ao Ying guffawed.

“Of course.” Huang Xiaolong nodded seriously.

After threatening Huang Xiaolong to reveal where Ao Yan and the others went several more times, they failed to find anything to incriminate him. In order to prove his ‘innocence’, Huang Xiaolong released the restrictions on his Sun Moon Furnace and Purple Lightning Peak for them to take a look inside.

He had suppressed all five of them back in the Black Sea World after taking control of it. There was no way he would be stupid enough to bring them along with him.

Eventually, Ao Ying could only leave the headquarters of the Eternal Heaven Alliance.

After returning to his palace, Huang Xiaolong entered seclusion immediately.

Since the Creation Palace was nice enough to hand over ten universe-level spiritual veins, he had to devour them as quickly as he could.

“If Feng Tianquan comes over, throw him out,” Huang Xiaolong instructed.

After staying in the Black Sea World for such a long time, Ao Shenhai had already entered the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm. Feng Tianquan wasn’t his opponent.

Bowing respectfully, the three of them received several other simple orders before they watched Huang Xiaolong enter seclusion.

Sitting in the middle of his palace, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Fusing with the majestic treasure, he started to devour the spiritual veins. He planned to refine them all at once in order to save some time.

Since he entered the large completion stage, he could refine the spiritual veins much faster than before. Ten high-grade universe-level spiritual veins were nothing to him.

Less than a hundred thousand years passed this time.

Sitting in mid-air, Huang Xiaolong released a torrent of grand cosmos energy. He felt invincible as a surge of power rushed through his body.

Before entering seclusion, he had already accumulated close to 9.8 billion units of grand cosmos energy. After refining the ten spiritual veins, he finally crossed the 10 billion units mark!

After all, high-grade universe-level spiritual veins were incomparable to low-grade ones!

To be exact, Huang Xiaolong had 10.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy. It wasn’t a small leap in power!

After familiarizing himself with the strength he now wielded, he left his palace.

Since he was used to concealing his strength, Wang Meiqi and the others failed to detect any changes. They didn’t think too much about it, and they ran over to greet him in excitement.

Bowing respectfully, they started to report every eventful matter that happened during the time he was in seclusion.

“Your Highness, something big happened! The leader of the Solitary Alliance is marrying off his daughter! Lord Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong hope that you can head over to offer our congratulations,” Ao Guang said.

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong thought of Jiang Shaoyu and frowned, “Is Jiang Shaoyu getting married?” 

The three of them looked at each other weirdly when they saw the look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. However, they quickly returned to normal.

“No. Jiang Shaoyan isn’t the one getting married. She’s Jiang Shaoyu’s older sister.” Wang Meiqi glowered as she stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief inwardly when he heard that Jiang Shaoyu wasn’t the one getting married.

“Wait, did you say that the alliance leaders hope that I can go over on our Eternal Heaven Alliance’s behalf?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“The experts of the Creation Palace will definitely be there to offer their congratulations,” Ao Shenghai muttered. “The two of them seem to be plotting something now that they sent you over on the alliance’s behalf.”

“We’ll go over and tell the two leaders to send someone else over!” Ao Shenghai growled.

Waving his hand nonchalantly, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “There’s no need for that. I’ll go.” How many experts could the Creation Palace send? Could they possibly send out all their palace masters? Regardless, they were playing right into Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Now that he broke through the 10 billion units mark, he planned to fight a few of them to test out his strength.

“We’ll go with you!” Wang Meiqi declared all of a sudden.

“Don’t worry about it.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the anxious expression on Wang Meiqi’s face. “Other people might not know how strong I am, but you guys should know a little. If you come with me, you won’t be the ones doing the protecting.”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ao Guang and the other two pouted silently at the side.

“Should we exchange pointers?” Ao Shenghai said all of a sudden.

Since he entered the grand completion stage, he wanted to see how he matched up to Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing the looks he was getting Huang Xiaolong knew that he had to reveal some of his strength to convince the three of them that he would be fine. As a grin slowly formed on his face, Huang Xiaolong replied, “Alright. Use everything you have, if you manage to make me lose my footing, consider it my loss.” 

The three of them raised an eyebrow in shock.

“Alright! I’ll go first! Your Highness, please be careful!” Ao Shenghai yelled. He didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong was as strong as he said. In the past, he lost to Huang Xiaolong, but the battle dragged on for a long time before the victor was decided. Now that he broke through, he was confident that he could make Huang Xiaolong take a step back if he pushed himself to the limit. 

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

No longer holding back, Ao Shenghai circulated the grand cosmos energy in his body to the limit before sending a punch towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Buzz…

Ao Guang and Wang Meiqi felt as though the world was trembling when Ao Shenghai made his move.

However, Huang Xiaolong raised a single hand to stop Ao Shenghai.

He didn’t even budge from the exchange!

What?!

Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi were flabbergasted.

What the f…?

Revealing his true form, Ao Shenghai turned into a massive dragon that covered the skies. His claw came crashing down on Huang Xiaolong’s head, but he was once again stopped dead in his tracks.

Eventually, he used the strongest secret technique he had. Like before, it was easily nullified by Huang Xiaolong.

A bitter smile formed on Ao Shenghai’s face as he finally stopped. He finally realized that Huang Xiaolong was several times stronger than before!

Since the marriage ceremony was going to take place in half a year, Huang Xiaolong chose to leave in the coming days. It would take him quite some time to arrive at the other party’s territory.
