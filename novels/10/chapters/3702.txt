Chapter 3703: Pretty Fast

The giant arm tore through the dark light like it was nothing!

It continued on its way towards the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Cymbals King.

Before they could react, it arrived right above their heads.

When the two kings felt the terrifying power coming from the arm, their expressions changed.

They seemed to have thought of the same person as they yelled in unison, “Ferocious Devil!”

Even though they were surprised, the Heaven Devouring King acted immediately. The black swords that filled the area gathered together and emitted twice as much power compared to the time he was attacking Huang Xiaolong.

The Golden Cymbals King didn’t hold back either. He summoned his golden cymbals and sent them flying towards the crack in space.

Boom!

The tear in space that came from the strength of the arm slammed into the river of black swords ripping it apart.

It was like a bubble that popped in the air above them.

The golden cymbals that arrived were sent flying.

Seeing as their defenses were useless, they could only try again before the arm arrived.

With their heaven-shaking strength, the entire Devil Abyss trembled when they unleashed their true power.

Boom!

After countless strikes, they finally stopped the arm that was crashing down on them.

Even so, they were forced to retreat countless steps back. It was especially so for the Golden Cymbals King. He nearly fell, and he was forced into an extremely sorry state.

The Heaven Devouring King fared slightly better. His arms went completely numb at the end of it.

“Let’s go!” The Heaven Devouring King didn’t hesitate. He tore through the skies with the Golden Cymbals King and left the confines of the Star Gathering Sword Formation. The moment he did, the protective formation turned into countless layers of sword qi that protected them from further attacks.

Watching the two of them get away, a cold snort boomed through the air. A giant palm appeared once again to stop them from leaving.

The weight of a million mountains came crashing down on them.

Even with the formation to protect them, they could feel the universe-destroying might coming towards them.

Roaring with all his might, layers of black light surrounded the Heaven Devouring King.

The golden cloth that the Golden Cymbals King used against Huang Xiaolong appeared once again to turn the area around him into a sea of gold. As waves that were thousands of miles tall rose, they charged at the giant palm.

Boom!

Their attacks slammed into the giant palm as rays of light filled the abyss.

The giant palm shattered the dark light and golden sea in an instant.

The two kings were sent flying as they coughed up mouthfuls of blood.

An expression of fright appeared on their faces.

It had only been several years since they last met. How did the Ferocious Devil become so damn strong?!

They looked at each other before retrieving a talisman. They didn’t hesitate to crush it and a weird light surrounded them before anyone could react. They disappeared without a trace, as though they had never existed in the first place. They left the Unknown Space using some sort of special method.

“Humph… They’re pretty fast when it comes to running away…” A middle-aged man appeared in the Devil Abyss. There was an air of elegance around him and his eyes shone like stars. His eyebrows were sharp like swords but they were completely white in color.

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock. Was he the strongest expert in the Unknown Space, the Ferocious Devil?!

Huang Xiaolong flew towards him and cupped his fists respectfully. “Many thanks to fellow cultivator for saving my life.”

The Ferocious Devil chuckled in amusement and stared at Huang Xiaolong with a deep gaze, “Even if I didn’t do anything, you would be able to escape from his formation…”

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback, but he laughed in response. “Even so, it won’t be easy for me to leave the Devil Abyss. I’ll have to thank you no matter what.”

The Ferocious Devil no longer continued the topic. He looked in the direction they fled and sighed, “Looks like the Black Nether King is about to fully recover.”

“The Black Nether King was injured?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

The Black Nether King was the strongest expert among the thirteen kings of the Universe First Race. Who in the world had the ability to harm him?!

Probably not even the Ferocious Devil could injure the man.

“When the Black Nether King harvested the lives of the Thirteen Universes in the past in an attempt to break through to the Universe God Realm, he failed and suffered a serious backlash from the universes. He has been in seclusion all this time in order to treat his injuries. That’s the reason behind the Universe First Race’s indifference to our presence.”

So that was the case…

Now that the Black Nether King was about to fully recover, the Universe First Race planned to deal with the Unknown Space to prevent any unknown factors from interrupting their master plan. The appearance of the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Cymbals King was the greatest sign of that.

“We don’t have much time left.” The Ferocious Devil sighed. His worry was evident.

The moment the Black Nether King recovered, the next person to show up in the Unknown Space to take care of things might be the man himself.

If he really came, not even the Ferocious Devil would be able to stop him.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Unknown Space would fall in an instant!

Since the Black Nether King wanted to try to break through again, the first group of people he would slaughter would be the members of the Unknown Space. After all, they were the only survivors during the destruction previously.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

“What about Mo Kun?” Huang Xiaolong spoke after some time.

“He’s alright.” The Ferocious Devil muttered, “Let’s head back.”

Leaving the Devil Abyss, they left for the city.

As soon as they returned, Huang Xiaolong learned of the invasion by the devilish creatures. The Golden Qilin King had also left, but the eight experts suffered quite a bit of injuries. The appearance of the Green Ghost saved them all.

“We were fighting toe to toe with the Golden Qilin King after Lord Ghost appeared, but he left suddenly,” The Dragon Overlord reported.

Huang Xiaolong knew exactly why. He probably received the news that the Ferocious Devil had appeared in the Devil Abyss to save Huang Xiaolong. There was no point in dragging on the battle as they wouldn’t be able to achieve anything with the Ferocious Devil’s arrival.

After the kings left, the experts of Devil Land gathered together to push the devilish creatures back.

The Ferocious Devil’s return caused Devil Land to cheer wildly.

In the main palace, there was a great feast arranged to welcome the Ferocious Devil back to his territory.

After the banquet, Huang Xiaolong returned to his old routine of comprehending the images in the Devil Mirror.

The sense of urgency in his heart burned even stronger after meeting the Heaven Devouring King. Huang Xiaolong knew that he needed to break through before anything else.

A year later, Huang Xiaolong finally understood the second set of ten thousand images.

Then came the third set and fourth…

After several hundred years, Huang Xiaolong comprehended a hundred and thirty thousand images and the Nameless Devil Mirror started to shine with a terrifying light. It rose from its original spot and fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hand.
