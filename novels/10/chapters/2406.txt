Chapter 2407: I’ll Let You Die Peacefully

As he raged and cried about stepping Huang Xiaolong beneath his feet, a cold voice rang through the air. “Are you sure you wish to uncover my identity?”

Yu Fujiang’s body stiffened the moment he heard the voice. The killing intent on his face disappeared, and he quickly spun around. He was met with an indifferent stare from Huang Xiaolong and fear immediately gripped his heart. “How... How did you find me?!”

“What do you think?”

Yu Fujiang’s expression fell as he growled, “You placed a soul imprint on me!”

Huang Xiaolong ignored the screaming baby before him as he slowly approached.

In contrast to his heated outburst a moment ago, Yu Fujiang’s face was ashen. He retreated in fright, and this was the most frightened he had been in his entire life. The shadow of death crept upon him.

“What do you want from me?!” Yu Fujiang screamed. Desperation filled his voice as he wailed loudly, “Who in the world are you?! Why are you trying to kill me?”

In the Profound River, he hadn’t offended this terrifying person called Thirteen.

Even in the Four Seas Holy Gate, all he had done was to ask for the other party’s profound beast and divine pills. All he asked for was Huang Xiaolong to submit to their Beast Tamer Holy Gate. In his eyes, it was an honor for them to be able to climb on the coattails of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate.

“Since you asked, I shall allow you to rest in peace.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. Under Yu Fujiang’s terrified gaze, Huang Xiaolong’s appearance returned to the one that struck fear deep into the hearts of everyone.

Cold sweat immediately soaked the back of Yu Fujiang’s clothes, and his heart nearly leaped out of his chest. “It’s you! Huang Xiaolong of the Holy Heavens!” The death god who appeared before him was none other than Huang Xiaolong of the Holy Heavens!

“No! This isn’t possible!” Yu Fujiang continued his maniacal screams. “You were a Fourth Order Venerable just several years ago! How can you progress so quickly?!”

During the apprenticeship ceremony, Huang Xiaolong had barely entered the Fourth Order Venerable Realm. In forty short years, he had entered the half-True Saint Realm!

Moreover, he had managed to obtain a holy soul!

That was something only True Saints were supposed to have! With a holy soul, no one would be able to kill him by destroying his physical body!

Huang Xiaolong looked at Yu Fujiang, who was on the verge of going insane, and he snorted coldly. “Do you have anything else you wish to say?”

Feeling the killing intent rolling off Huang Xiaolong’s body, Yu Fujiang broke down internally. “Huang Xiaolong, even if you’re a disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, the Holy Lands Alliance will definitely seek justice for my death!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A weird smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Will there be anyone to prove that I was the one who killed you? Even if the Beast Tamer Holy Gate tries to search for your killer, they will never be able to find me. The only thing they will discover is that an individual named Thirteen is your killer!”

At that very instant, no one knew that Huang Xiaolong was Thirteen!

Even Lin Xiaoying of the Clear Snow Palace had no idea, much less Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage!

So what if he killed Yu Fujiang? No one would be able to trace it back to him!

Of course, even if the Beast Tamer Holy Gate discovered that he was the one who killed Yu Fujiang, they wouldn’t dare to move against him. After all, he was the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors! With the Holy Heavens behind him, they would probably take out some gifts to console the Beast Tamer Holy Gate for their loss.

The blood drained from Yu Fujiang’s face. He knew that Huang Xiaolong was right.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong... You can’t kill me! Please, please stay your hand!”

As soon as the words left his lips, the dragon attributed holy soul appeared above Huang Xiaolong’s head. Reaching out with a single arm, Huang Xiaolong dragged him over.

“Do you really think it’s possible for me to show you any mercy?” Pushing forward with his other arm, Huang Xiaolong’s palm emerged from the back of Yu Fujiang’s body. As Huang Xiaolong activated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, Yu Fujiang turned into a dried up corpse in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong quickly swept everything of value into the Darkness Holy Ring. Glancing around, he casually swept the area of all traces of battle before boarding the Winged Dragon Flying Ship.

Huang Xiaolong knew that the Beast Tamer Holy Gate would immediately learn of Yu Fujiang’s death, and a group of furious experts would be an understatement. They would definitely conduct an in-depth search for the killer, and they would eventually realize that Yu Fujiang went back to the Four Seas Holy Gate with Lu Ding.

As such, Huang Xiaolong decided to return to the Four Seas Holy Gate to gather his newfound troops before leaving.

It didn’t take long for him to return. As soon as he got back, he ordered Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage to bring all the captives over to him.

He didn’t waste his time speaking to them. With a wave of his arm, several dozen purple grandmist holy dragons emerged and entered the bodies of the half-True Saint Realm experts of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate.

With his terrifying strength, Huang Xiaolong devoured them all at the same time.

When he was finally done, he turned around to look at the two True Saints.

Their hearts started to pound, as they had no idea what Huang Xiaolong planned to do to them.

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong retrieved Yu Jizhang’s holy soul from the space inside the lightning bead.

“This....” The two True Saints were shocked at the revelation.

“This is the holy soul of Hall Master Yu Jizhang from the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate. In the Profound River, he had conspired to kill me. After I blasted his physical body to pieces, I trapped his holy soul in my holy artifact. Every day, I’ll refine his soul with lightning flames. It’s impossible for him to die even if he wanted to, and everyday in his life is a living hell.” Huang Xiaolong growled. “I’ll give each of you a single chance to submit to me now. Otherwise, you’ll suffer the same fate as Yu Jizhang!”

The peak early-First Heaven True Saint roared with laughter when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said, “Brat, how dare you request for me to betray the Beast Tamer Holy Gate? The experts of the Holy Gate will be here soon, and even if you grow ten pairs of wings on your back, you won’t be able to escape! You’ll meet a tragic end!”

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to quarrel with him and the two holy souls emerged. With a single palm, he smashed the body of the True Saint before throwing his holy soul into the lightning bead.

“What about you?” Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the other True Saint. “Make your choice!”

With an ugly expression, the last remaining True Saint of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate felt darkness swirling before his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hurry him. After all, a mid-Second Heaven True Saint was a valuable fighter.

Eventually, the True Saint made his decision and agreed to submit.

A smile was revealed on Huang Xiaolong’s face, and he made the True Saint swear an oath to the grand dao of the Holy World. However, he sent a trace of grandmist holy spiritual qi into his body as insurance before handing over a Resurrection Pill.

When he was finally done, he led Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage into the treasury of the Four Seas Holy Gate. Not wasting a single moment, he swept everything into the Darkness Holy Ring.

Since the members of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate would be arriving soon, there wasn’t a need to hand the treasures over to them.

After completing his ‘collection,’ Huang Xiaolong summoned the Winged Dragon Flying Ship and took everyone away from the Four Seas Holy Gate. Their new destination was the Holy Heavens organization!

“I wonder how Feng Tianyu and Zhang Wenyue are doing....” In the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong had left the Holy Heavens for several tens of years. His thoughts slowly drifted back to those he had left behind.
