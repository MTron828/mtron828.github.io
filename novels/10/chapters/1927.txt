A single fist caused the Ascending Moon Old Man to suffer serious injuries.

Wangu Wudi’s strength caused every elder in the hall to gasp in shock.

Even though Wangu Wudi was the publicly acknowledged number-one expert under the heavens, he didn’t usually display his strength. This was the first time the elders from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union saw him making a move, and it was also the first time they experienced his horrifying strength.

When Wangu Wudi’s fist slammed into the Ascending Moon Old Man, a cold chuckle escaped his lips. His figure blurred as he appeared right above the old man. His palm turned into claws as he grabbed the figure before him.

The Ascending Moon Old Man was about to dodge, but the claw seemed to be a python that wrapped itself around his arm. With a jerk, Wangu Wudi ripped his arm off.

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s miserable cry filled the hall as his arm was torn off his body.

Wangu Wudi didn’t hold back as he sent another fist towards the old man. All the bones in the Ascending Moon Old Man’s body shattered, and the sound of bones breaking filled the air.

Every time Wangu Wudi’s fist landed, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s face turned a little whiter. Blood streamed down from the corner of his lips.

Wangu Wudi’s became more and more excited as a vicious sneer formed on his lips.

Very quickly, the Ascending Moon Old Man’s chest caved in, and he became a pile of bloody meat. Blood covered his body, and there wasn’t a part of his body that was left intact.

Despite the gory scene before them, none of the elders from the Alchemist Grandmaster Union pleaded for mercy on behalf of the Ascending Moon Old Man.

Wangu Wudi wanted to turn the Ascending Moon Old Man into an example, and as long as he managed to cripple the old-man, no one would dare to go against him. The Alchemist Grandmaster Union would turn into his private property from then on.

After shattering every bone in the Ascending Moon Old Man’s body, Wangu Wudi sneered before sending a punch flying towards the old man’s heart.

Boom!

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s heart was punched out of his chest, and he was sent flying.

As he crashed into the wall, blood flowed from all the openings of his body. His blood stained the walls and the floor red.

When the various elders looked at the scene before them, they sucked in a cold breath.

Wangu Wudi admired his masterpiece on the wall as though he was appreciating some sort of artwork. “Ascending Moon Old Man, why didn’t you believe me when I said that I could kill you like killing a dog on the side of the street?”

He turned to the other elders, and a charming smile appeared on his face. “Do you believe me now?”

Everyone nodded their heads hurriedly.

“Yes, we do!”

Wangu Wudi roared with laughter. The feeling of pleasure washed over him, and he felt as though he could control the life and death of every creature in the world!

After a full minute of laughter, Wangu Wudi stopped and said to the Ascending Moon Old Man. “Whatever the case, I’m a merciful man. You were once an elder of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union, so I’ll leave you alive.”

“Go. Throw his body at the entrance of the Abundant Deities Manor.” Wangu Wudi turned and spoke to one of the elders.

Without delay, the elder acknowledged. “Yes!”

Despite his agreement, the elder shook his head in his heart. It was clear that Wangu Wudi hadn’t held back in the slightest. With the injuries on the Ascending Moon Old Man’s body, no one at the Abundant Deities Manor would be able to save him.

Under the elder’s instruction, several disciples carried the Ascending Moon Old Man towards the Abundant Deities Manor.

When everything was taken care of, Wangu Wudi swept his gaze over all the elders in the hall. “Enough. Since this situation has been dealt with, we have an empty spot among the elders. I’ll make some arrangements for it to be filled. Since there is nothing else, I’ll be leaving. I’m going to prepare for the competition tomorrow.”

It was clear that Wangu Wudi would arrange for someone from the Wangu Clan to take over the empty position. However, none of the Elders dared to express any dissatisfaction.

Under the escort of all the elders, Wangu Wudi left the headquarters of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union.

As the main hall of the Alchemist Grandmaster Union had always been cut off from the world, Wangu Wudi failed to learn anything about the massive battle that had taken place several minutes ago.

After half an hour, Wangu Wudi finally arrived at the residence of the Wangu Clan.

The instant he entered, a frown formed on his face. Why is nobody here to welcome me?! When he entered the hall, he didn’t see Wangu Changlong or the rest of the elders. He couldn’t help but feel that everything was a little too quiet in the hall.

“Men!” Wangu Wudi sat on the throne in the main room and yelled.

In an instant, several lower-level members of the Wangu Clan rushed into the hall. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Lord Wudi!” They greeted as they fell to their knees.

“We are here to receive your instructions!”

“Where are Wangu Changlong, Wangu Di, and the rest?” Wangu Wudi’s low voice resounded through the hall.

Their bodies trembled as they stuttered, “Lord Wudi, you... did no one report to you about the matter pertaining to Lord Changlong and the others?”

“What are you talking about?” Wangu Wudi frowned and asked, “What happened to them?”

The news of Wangu Changlong’s death, along with the other experts of the Wangu Clan, had already spread throughout Divine Dan City, and nearly everyone knew about what had happened. It was too bad none of them had the authority to report directly to Wangu Wudi.

Of course, the news had frightened them so bad that none of them had dared to report the news to Wangu Wudi.

As the members of the Wangu Clan stared at each other, a look of fear appeared on their faces. They didn’t dare to reply to Wangu Wudi’s question.

“Speak!” Wangu Wudi yelled in fury when he saw that no one was answering his question.

After a moment of hesitation, the members of the Wangu Clan spat out everything they had learned.

They first reported about Wangu Rui’s death before speaking about how Wangu Changlong and the others had led a whole group of experts towards the Abundant Deities Manor.

“You... What did you say?! My nephew was killed?! Wangu Changlong, Wangu Di, and nearly one hundred experts from our Wangu Clan were killed?!” Wangu Wudi didn’t dare to believe his ears as he leaped to his feet.

“Yes, that is correct, Lord Wudi.” All of them trembled as they didn’t dare to raise their heads to look at him.

The killing intent on Wangu Wudi’s body rose, and a suffocating feeling filled the hall.

However, he started laughing in the next instant. “Did you say that the Huang Family killed my nephew before killing all the experts of my Wangu Clan?”

Wangu Wudi’s laughter filled the hall, and it slowly spread throughout the Wangu Clan’s residence.
