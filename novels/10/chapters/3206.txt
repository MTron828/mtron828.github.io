Chapter 3207: Fu Luosen Makes His Move

Huang Xiaolong looked at Chen Zhenghong and the others who surrounded him and he growled, “Get lost! Otherwise, I’ll cripple all of you here and now!” He might not be loud, but those standing around him felt a thunderclap going off in their minds.

All of them retreated hastily, and their expressions changed when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

A look of fear could be seen in their eyes, and Chen Zhenghong was taken aback. He thought that he wouldn’t be on the losing end if he were to take Huang Xiaolong in a battle, but from Huang Xiaolong’s sudden revelation earlier, he knew that the man’s strength was something that completely outclassed him.

Li Shuo glared at them and continued, “If not because of Princess Zeng Ying, all of you would be seriously injured!”

Zhu Wuxing sneered, “How dare you! Do you really think that we should be thanking you for sparing our lives after you betrayed us and worked with the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire?”

“That’s right! All of us here are loyal to the princess! We went through life and death together and we’re her trusted subordinate!” Chen Zhenghong snorted in anger. “As for Hao Yi and the others, Her Highness has known them for a long time! None of us will work with the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire!”

There was only a single person left.

Yuan Tianyi’s expression sank when he heard what they were implying.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand to stop Yuan Tianyi from doing anything rash. He released his three dao souls to observe the flying ship that was flying towards them and the two who entered.

The two of them who entered clearly didn’t expect the flying ship to head towards them as a trace of shock flashed through their eyes. The space they were hiding in fluctuated a little.

When the Excessive Darkness Flying Ship reached the space above Huang Xiaolong and the rest, a voice boomed through the air.

“The Mysterious Magician’s Treasury is mine! I, Fu Luosen, will kill anyone who stands in my way! After that, I’ll exterminate your entire clan!”

The entire sea of flames heard his cry, and the faces of Chen Zhenghong and the others changed instantly.

“Fu Luosen!”

Someone screamed in terror and revealed an expression of extreme fear.

Even the two experts who entered the sea of flames previously were shocked.

Of course, no one could blame them. Fu Luosen’s reputation was too terrifying! He was one of the five strongest Sons of Creation in the entire universe!

There wasn’t any need to talk about the princes of the various celestial empires. Even the celestial emperors would feel fear when standing in front of any of the five!

“The two little ants hiding there, scram!” Fu Luosen’s voice rang through the skies again. The sound wave was like knives that stabbed into the space around him, and he forced them out of hiding.

Anger flashed through their eyes when they appeared in front of everyone present.

“Fu Luosen, other people might be afraid of you, but I, Huang Ji, am not!”

A chuckle left Fu Luosen’s lips. “Who would have thought that the Fourth Prince of the True Dragon Celestial Empire would be here too!”

The first person who entered the sea of flames was none other than Huang Ji!

Among the princes in the True Dragon Celestial Empire, Huang Ji was only weaker than Huang Shengdao. Even though he couldn't be compared to then, he was no weaker than You Ming of the Nether Spirit Palace.

“Evil Wind Patriarch.” Fu Luosen continued.

That was the second person who entered the sea of flames.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

Evil Wind Patriarch? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He was someone of extreme fame in the Dao Emperor World! Moreover, his fame was no less than You Ming in the Blazing Dragon World! In fact, he could be considered a little more famous than You Ming!

The Evil Wind Patriarch was one of the ten strongest experts in the Dao Emperor World!

A chuckle left the Evil Wind Patriarch’s lips. “Your Highness has a good eye. I didn’t expect anyone to recognize me after so many years.”

When Chen Zhenghong and the others noticed the appearance of Huang Ji and the Evil Wind Patriarch, their expressions started to change. They were strong, but they were far too lacking when compared to either of the two! As for Fu Luosen, there was no need for them to even think about it!

“Fu Luosen, it’s impossible for you to swallow the entire treasury yourself.” Huang Ji sneered. “Right now, Zeng Ying is breaking the Five Directions Grand Formation, and when she’s done, let’s split up the treasury. What do you think?” According to his plans, he would split the treasury in half with Fu Luosen.

As for the Evil Wind Patriarch and Zeng Ying, he didn’t bother adding them into the deal.

Zeng Ying might be the Sixth Princess of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, but as the Fourth Prince of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, he really didn’t give too sh*ts about her.

The Evil Wind Patriarch might be strong, but if he could ignore Zeng Ying, he was nothing in his eyes.

The old face of the patriarch changed a little when he heard what he said. “All of you better not forget that this is the Dao Emperor World! All I need to do is to make a single announcement for everyone to learn about the Mysterious Magician’s Treasury!”

Fu Luosen chuckled. “Alright. We’ll split it three ways.” However, his tone changed all of a sudden. “We have to deal with all of them first in case they leak the news.”

Huang Ji frowned. “All of them are pretty easy to deal with, but Zeng Ying might be a little troublesome.”

Fu Luosen sneered. “There’s no need to worry. I already laid down several supreme formations to prevent them from escaping. Leave her to me.”

“Other than Zeng Ying, kill everyone present!”

Fu Luosen announced their deaths like he was ordering food for lunch, and their lives were clearly beneath him. A terrifying power enveloped the space around Huang Xiaolong and the others, and the faces of Chen Zhenghong and the others changed. The weight of a mountain pressed down on them, and they found it hard to even breathe.

A casual probe from Fu Luosen had already exceeded their expectations!

“Prepare for battle!” Chen Zhenghong roared. He pushed himself to the limit, and the four supreme experts on Zeng Ying’s side released their full strength. Chen Zhenghong was someone who comprehended twelve elements with ten of them at perfection level, and the others had comprehended eleven elements with ten of them at perfection level. As for the rest, there were some who only had three elements at the perfection level.

Huang Ji couldn’t help but sneer at their pitiful strength. He reached out and suppressed everyone with his twelve elements, and the Evil Wind Patriarch sent a punch tearing through the void. A massive hole was blown in the sea of flames with Huang Xiaolong and the others in the middle.

The Evil Wind Patriarch’s punch was stronger than Huang Ji’s sudden attack, and the space around Huang Xiaolong shattered.

With the three supreme experts acting in unison, an aura of death filled the air around them. Chen Zhenghong and the others couldn’t help but feel a sense of helplessness.
