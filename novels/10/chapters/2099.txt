Chapter 2100: Kneel to Receive Your Order!

When they heard that Huang Xiaolong had successfully broken through, the little cow and Cang Mutian’s body trembled with joy as a smile appeared on their faces.

“Haha! I knew it!” The little cow roared with laughter, and she was so happy that her eyes narrowed into slits. “H*ll yeah! Amitabha, Amitabha...” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, she seemed to have thought about something as she spat, “Wait! F*ck that Buddhist Ancestor...”

Wasn’t the Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen?! Why was she even imitating him?!”

Cang Mutian burst into laughter when he heard what she said, “If that little brat, Shi Zhen, hears this, his dead fish face will probably become even more terrifying...”

It was true that Shi Zhen’s expression hadn’t changed for the past hundred million years.

The little cow chuckled, “Why should I care about his stupid expression?”

Now that Huang Xiaolong had entered the mid-level Sovereign Realm, the two of them felt a burst of joy in their hearts. Previously, they were petrified that something would go wrong. When they finally realized that Huang Xiaolong had successfully broken through, they heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts.

Soon after, the little cow sent the good news to the King of Grandmist and the Reverence Moon Old Man.

“Right, Xiaolong, I have something I need to tell you...” Cang Mutian thought of something, and his expression turned solemn.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the look on Cang Mutian’s face, he realized that something was wrong. “Is Wan Shi emerging from his secluded cultivation?”

Cang Mutian was stunned for a second, but he quickly snapped back to attention. “Yes. There were some rumors going about that.” He quickly revealed everything he knew to Huang Xiaolong.

The little cow revealed a solemn expression as she continued, “That’s right. Wan Shi is about to emerge from his secluded cultivation... If he enters the Eighth Order Sovereign Realm...” She didn’t complete her sentence as she didn’t know what to say.

If Wan Shi were to enter the Eighth Order Sovereign Realm, it would be nearly impossible for a Fourth Order Sovereign like Huang Xiaolong to top him.

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Wan Shi’s sudden emergence had indeed caught him by surprise.

Within the next ten years?!

It seemed as though he had to locate the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele as quickly as possible...

After gathering the six devil steles, he would be able to raise his strength again. It would definitely be of help when he faced off against Wan Shi in the future.

“We’ll head back to Saint Devil City right now!” Huang Xiaolong growled.

Everyone nodded, and the four of them shot towards Saint Devil City once again.

Since Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding his tracks, everyone got the news that he had returned to Saint Devil City the moment he reappeared.

Wan Yue was a little shocked when he realized what had happened. “Huang Xiaolong appeared in Saint Devil City again?”

“Lord Wan Yue, that’s right.” Yang Gang reported. “It’s definitely him. Old Ancestor Azure Cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python are present. Even if other people manage to hide their aura, there is no way we can mistake the three of them for someone else. Huang Xiaolong is definitely back.”

Wan Yue’s frown became deeper. “That’s strange... Did Huang Xiaolong already refine the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus?!” However, he shook his head soon after. “It’s impossible. There is no way he did it.”

It had only been forty years! There was no way Huang Xiaolong could successfully refine the high-level four origin treasure in such a short amount of time!

Despite that, he had no idea how to explain Huang Xiaolong’s reappearance in Saint Devil City!

“Lord Wan Yue, maybe Huang Xiaolong learned about Lord Wan Shi’s imminent emergence, and he decided to leave seclusion early...”

Wan Yue nodded his head. “It’s possible.” A sneer formed on his lips, and he continued, “If only he knew what would have happened... Huang Xiaolong, don’t you regret going against the All-Heavens Decree in the past? Did you expect this when you killed my envoy in the past?!”

Yang Gang laughed as well, “Huang Xiaolong is definitely p*ssing his pants now that Lord Wan Shi is about to emerge. He should be looking around for all the help he can get right now!”

Wan Yue spoke up all of a sudden, “Get our men in Saint Devil City to pass down my All-Heavens Decree. If Huang Xiaolong arrives in City of All-Heavens in a year, he can kneel before our gates and admit his mistakes. I might allow him to die with a complete corpse when the time comes!”

“If he really comes, our City of All-Heavens will only take the life of that little brat, Huang Xiaolong! If he refuses to come, we’ll kill everyone related to him! His family members, his master, everyone related to him will die!”

“While you’re at it, tell everyone about the decree!”

Yang Gang was stunned for a second before a smile broke out on his face. “Lord Wan Yue, I shall do as you say!”

Before long, the news started to spread around the myriad of worlds.

“The All-Heavens Decree has arrived! Huang Xiaolong is to kneel at the gates of the City of All-Heavens and admit his mistakes!”

“Do you think Huang Xiaolong will receive the decree? If he refuses to go, everyone related to him will die! If he agrees, he will be the only victim! In my opinion, Huang Xiaolong will definitely agree.”

Discussions broke out, and everyone seemed to be gloating in his misfortune.

Of course, the news couldn’t escape from Huang Xiaolong. He learned about the All-Heavens Decree in the main hall of the Skull Devil Sect.

“Your Majesty, someone is here to see you. He says that he’s from the City of All-Heavens!” The three Skull Ancestors made a report all of a sudden.

The little cow chuckled coldly, “Someone from the City of All-Heavens? He’s definitely here to relay the decree!”

Huang Xiaolong wore an indifferent look, and no one could see through his thoughts. He turned to the three Skull Ancestors and ordered, “Let him in.”

“Yes, Your Majesty!” They replied respectfully before turning to leave. Before long, they led an old man at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm into the hall.

The old man was someone who was half a step into the Sovereign Realm!

“Greetings to Your Majesty, the King of Hell!” He greeted Huang Xiaolong the moment he stepped into the hall. However, there wasn’t a trace of respect on his face.

Huang Xiaolong raised his eyebrows as he asked, “What did Wan Yue send you here for?”

A frown formed on the old man’s face as he sneered in his heart. According to him, Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a dead man walking. He didn’t understand why Huang Xiaolong was still acting so cockily.

Despite the mockery in his heart, he remained expressionless as he said, “I’m sure Your Majesty has already guessed Lord Wan Yue’s intentions.” He retrieved the All-Heavens Decree and yelled, “Your Majesty, the King of Hell, kneel to receive your orders!”

The moment the All-Heavens Decree appeared, even the world leaders of the five greater worlds had to kneel on one knee in order to receive the order. It was a show of respect to Lord Wan Shi of the City of All Heavens.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wasn’t planning to show his respects. Instead, he chuckled coldly, “That’s where you’re wrong. I’ve never been in the habit of kneeling to anybody. Moreover, isn’t it just Wan Yue? He’s not qualified to make me kneel!”

The old man’s expression changed, and he raged in his heart. He had never thought that Lord Wan Shi’s emergence wouldn’t be enough to scare Huang Xiaolong into submission. Huang Xiaolong even dared to disrespect the All-Heavens Decree!

“Brat, no one kills envoys. If you get lost now, you might still find a way to live.” The little cow glared at the old man. “If you refuse my kind gesture to let you off now, this old cow will smash you into pieces!”

The envoy could no longer endure the flames of rage in his heart, and he pointed at Huang Xiaolong and raged, “Huang Xiaolong, Azure Cow, how dare you disrespect the All-Heavens Decree?! The day Lord Wan Shi emerges from his secluded cultivation will be the day of your death!”

A chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. The little chaos axe slammed downwards and chopped him into half. The All-Heavens Decree was shredded to a million pieces.

Now that Huang Xiaolong was in the mid-level Sovereign Realm, the might of the tiny chaos axe had reached an unimaginable degree.

As for the old man from the City of All-Heavens, he fell to the ground with a face full of shock. He had never expected Huang Xiaolong to make a move against him at this point in time!
