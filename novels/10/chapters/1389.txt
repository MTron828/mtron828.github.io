Huang Xiaolong and the rest were still immersed in the thought that someone was attacking their flying ship, when the Giant Shark Flying Ship shook and swayed again.

An icy coldness flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he changed the view on the screen in front of him to show the flying ship’s surroundings.

Everyone inside the Giant Shark Flying Ship was taken aback at the sight outside.

The Giant Shark Flying Ship was encircled by almost a hundred flying ships.

These flying ships were of various shapes and sizes, but Huang Xiaolong’s group could tell that they were low-grade chaos spiritual artifacts, except the one in front of them was actually a high-grade chaos spiritual artifact.

There were at least seventy to eighty of these flying ships, if not a hundred, and they were surrounding the Giant Shark Flying Ship without leaving a route of escape for Huang Xiaolong’s group.

"It seems we’ve run into the Divine World’s space pirates." The little cow shook her head and lamented.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he repeated, "The Divine World’s space pirates? Do these pirates dare to rob the passing people so blatantly? Doesn’t the Heavenly Court have the law and enforcement to deal with them?"

The little cow explained, "Although the Heavenly Court has a lot of enforcers, how could they have the time to take care of all corners in this vast Divine World? Not to mention most of these space pirates have big backing behind them, and even the Heavenly Court’s enforcers can’t do anything to these space pirates. These space pirates also have good connections with the surrounding world surfaces’ big families. Therefore, no one has dared to stop these pirates, even if they have been robbing the passing flying ships.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Is that so?”

“How many God King Realm masters are among them?” Huang Xiaolong turned around and asked Xiang Xun.

Xiang Xun’s divine sense spread out, covering all the pirate ships several li away.

"There are three God King Realm masters, one of them is late-Third Order God King Realm, the other two are mid-Fourth Order God King Realm." Soon, Xiang Xun reported to Huang Xiaolong, and added, "Most of the others are high-level and mid-level Ancestor God Realm, and a small number is a low-level Ancestor God Realm."

Huang Xiaolong relaxed at Xiang Xun’s report.

"Master, are you planning to...?" Void devil beast Xu Baisheng asked.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze was fixed on the high-grade chaos spiritual flying ship as he smiled. "Don’t you guys think that flying ship is quite good?" Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A high-grade chaos spiritual flying ship was hard to find in the Divine World even at auction houses. Although he owned the Giant Shark Flying Ship and didn’t need a lower grade flying ship, he could still give it to Li Lu or Yao Chi.

Traveling on a high-grade spiritual flying ship was not bad.

The others blanked momentarily when they heard that Huang Xiaolong was coveting the other side’s high-grade spiritual flying ship.

The little cow grinned wickedly and agreed, "It’s not bad, quite a good speed too. Of course, you can also trade it for a lot of godheads!"

Even though these space pirates have a big backing behind them, and have good connections with the surrounding world surfaces’ big families, these were not worthy of the little cow’s attention.

At this time, a voice resounded from the high-grade spiritual flying ship. "The people inside the giant shark, listen up! Come out obediently, leave the ship, leave all your spatial items behind, and I will spare your lives!"

Huang Xiaolong chuckled at the other side’s words. "Since he wants us to go out, let’s go out then." Huang Xiaolong was the first to exit the Giant Shark Flying Ship as he stood in the air above the shark head.

Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the others followed Huang Xiaolong’s lead.

There was a moment of silence from the other side as if they had not expected Huang Xiaolong’s group to immediately exit the Giant Shark Flying ship this obediently.

A moment later, a layer of light glimmered over the high-grade chaos spiritual flying ship as a group of people flew out from its defensive barrier.

The group wasn’t big, roughly forty to fifty people, but all of them were wearing the same black divine armors and were led by three middle-aged men. Different from the others, these three men’s divine armors were dark grey in color and had a blood-colored wolf head emblem.

Clearly, these three were the heads of these space pirates, and they were also the God King Realm masters Xiang Xun had reported earlier.

Huang Xiaolong’s attention fell onto the middle-aged man at the center. This person’s face was, erm, unique; there was a hint of green in the eyes and he had overly red lips—like blood, and had had no left ear as if it was cut off by someone.

At the same time, the middle-aged man at the center was also observing Huang Xiaolong; a ray of green light flickered in the depths of his eyes. He said, “You’re very wise, instead of resisting futilely. You can leave after you hand over your spatial rings and divine artifacts!”

“Big brother, do you really want to let them go just like that?” One of the slightly rounded middle-aged men asked. “That woman’s a beauty, even prettier than Gudu Family’s Gudu Man!” His gaze was fixed on Feng Er who was standing beside Huang Xiaolong.

The other middle-aged man agreed, “That’s right, Big brother, we know that you don’t like this, but Third Bro and I haven’t touched a woman for a long time, our ‘tool’ is gonna get rusty. Might as well use this girl to clean it a little!”

Their Big brother frowned. He said to Huang Xiaolong with a helpless tone and expression, “It seems other than the flying ship, and all of your spatial rings, you will also need to leave that girl behind. The rest can go.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head with an indifferent expression and said, "Sorry, we don’t plan to leave, and don’t have the intention of giving up the flying ship, nor our spatial rings!"

The other side was dumbfounded.

"How about this? You guys leave that flying ship for us, and the three of you must also stay. The rest can leave." Huang Xiaolong said as he pointed at the high-grade spiritual flying ship.

The space pirates were immediately angered.

"Punk, what did you say?! You want to die!”

"You dare taunt our Blood Wolf Gang’s Head!"

Suddenly, the other Blood Wolf Gang’s space pirates attacked Huang Xiaolong. It seemed like the Blood Wolf Gang valued their Head quite a lot.

When the Blood Wolf Gang attacked, void devil beast Xu Baisheng also moved. He lifted a leg and stomped in front of him across space. In the next second, all the attacking Blood Wolf Gang sea pirates exploded, leaving a thick mist of blood.

“Early Fourth Order God King Realm!” The Blood Wolf Gang Boss’ eyes narrowed. Clearly, he was shocked.

So were the other Blood Wolf Gang’s sea pirates.

Even though the void devil beast Xu Baisheng was injured by the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace’s special envoy not long ago, his injuries had healed completely in recent days. On top of that, his strength had also recovered to early Fourth Order God King Realm.

Before the Blood Wolf Gang Boss could say a word, Xiang Xun let out a roar and reverted to his true body, turning into a majestic divine elephant. His trunk whipped down on the Blood Wolf Gang Boss’ head.

The overwhelming force really did scare the Blood Wolf Gang.

“He’s at least a Sixth Order God King Realm! Big brother, quickly run!” The other two God King Realm sea pirates’ bodies suddenly expanded as they rushed towards Xiang Xun. They were actually aiming to explode themselves to block Xiang Xun’s attack in order to give their Big brother a chance to escape!

Boom—! Boom—!

Just as the Blood Wolf Gang’s Second Boss and Third Boss blocked Xiang Xun’s attack and exploded to their deaths, the Blood Wolf Gang’s Boss Song Ruishen disappeared in a flicker. The high-grade chaos spiritual flying ship rumbled to life and tore through space and it vanished from sight.

Huang Xiaolong was dumbstruck for a second. He hadn’t expected the Blood Wolf Gang’s Boss would disregard other gang members and escaped with the flying ship. Not to mention, his actions were fluid and swift, as if he had done this many times in the past.
