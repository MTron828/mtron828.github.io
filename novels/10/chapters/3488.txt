Chapter 3489: Bearded Dragon World!

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong met up with the rest and spoke of the problem with Huang Long’s recovery.

The old dragon and Pangu fell silent.

The two of them knew how difficult it was to capture Huang Sheng, and they only managed to force out the victory because of their numbers. No matter how many people they brought along, they knew that they would never be able to capture Huang Sheng.

It was nearly impossible to capture an expert at the peak of the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm.

Unless four or five experts at the same level intervened, it was basically impossible!

Looking for four to five experts at Huang Sheng’s level was something easier said than done. Not even Pangu and the Blazing Dragon were at that level!Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Regardless, everyone passed down an order to look for Huang Sheng and the Excessive Darkness Old Ancestor.

Huang Xiaolong brought Huang Long to the World of Departed Souls when they were done. When Shi Xiaofei and the others saw Huang Xiaolong, they were overjoyed.

Huang Xiaolong had left for more than a million years! In the time that he was away, they managed to improve quite a bit. Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others had reached the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm. Those from Earth had already entered the True Saint Realm.

When the little cow saw that Huang Xiaolong had become a God of Creation, she was too shocked to speak. The Grandmist Old Man and the others smiled to themselves. The little brat they were protecting in the past finally grew up! He became a supreme expert so strong that none of them could ever dream of catching up to him!

He was a God of Creation, and he stood at the peak of the universe!

Several hundred years passed in the blink of an eye.

Huang Xiaolong remained in the World of Departed Souls for a few hundred years as he gave everyone pointers. Along the way, he tried to heal Huang Long, but to no avail. Even after using every single universe-level herb in the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Long didn’t show any signs of recovery. Huang Xiaolong mulled over the fact that Huang Long’s injuries were getting worse.

Huang Long was like a tree whose core was destroyed. No matter how powerful the treasures Huang Xiaolong used, it was impossible to heal Huang Long. It was a matter of time before the tree withered.

No matter how hard they racked their brains, Pangu, and the old dragon couldn’t think of anything.

“Do we really have to capture Huang Sheng for my father to recover?” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly.

In the past hundreds of years, there had been no news of Huang Sheng. Huang Sheng might have hidden himself in one of the spaces in the Blazing Dragon World, he also could have left the Blazing Dragon Universe.

“Perhaps, the Star Dragon Essence in the Star Dragon Universe might be able to help your father…” Pangu sighed.

“Star Dragon Essence?” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

“That’s right. The Star Dragon Essence is one of the most precious treasures in the Star Dragon Universe. No matter how serious their injuries were, the experts of the Dragon Race would be able to recover as long as they used the Star Dragon Essence. Even if the Star Dragon Essence fails to cure your father, it should be able to stabilize his condition.”

Soon after, Pangu introduced Huang Xiaolong to the Star Dragon Universe.

In the past, Pangu had lived there for a period of time. He was pretty familiar with the Star Dragon Universe, and he spoke of its history. The Star Dragon Universe was the home of the Dragon Race, and its name was also shortened to the Dragon Universe.

As the most precious treasure in the Star Dragon Universe, the Star Dragon Essence was inaccessible to even God of Creation Realm experts.

“Since the Star Dragon Essence can help with Lord Huang Long’s injuries, we will head over immediately!” Chen Yihui promised.

Everyone nodded their heads.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong left the World of Departed Souls with Huang Long. They headed straight for the Star Dragon Universe.

Several years passed.

Huang Xiaolong, Huang Long, Pangu, Wang Meiqi, Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and the Ice King arrived in the Star Dragon Universe.

“We should head over to the Bearded Dragon World,” Pangu mentioned.

The Bearded Dragon World was the oldest world in the Star Dragon Universe. Countless treasures were located there, and it was the best place to look for information on the Star Dragon Essence.

All seven of them rode on the Purple Lightning Peak as they charged straight towards the Bearded Dragon World.

Huang Long coughed along the way, and he looked like a young man plagued with a serious illness now that his blood essence was sucked away.

“How are you feeling?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“I’m fine.” Huang Long shook his arm and chuckled, “I never thought that I, Huang Long, would live to see this day…”

Even though he was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage, any random God of Creation at the large completion stage would be able to defeat him.

“Relax… You’ll be fine,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Of course. I believe you.” Huang Long smiled.

Retrieving some dragon marrow from the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong gave it to Huang Long. After devouring the marrow, some color returned to Huang Long’s face. Even though the dragon marrow couldn’t allow him to recover, it could support him for several years.

Several months later, Huang Xiaolong and the others approached the Bearded Dragon World.

“This is a pretty nice place…” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

The amount of dragon qi in the air was shocking, and it was so dense that there seemed to be dragons swimming in the air around them. The laws that governed the Bearded Dragon World were much stronger than that of the Blazing Dragon World and the True Dragon World.

“The Bearded Dragon World deserves its reputation as the oldest world in the Dragon Universe. Actually, the Bearded Dragon World is one of the oldest worlds in the thirteen universes!” Pangu explained. “The old dragon, Xu Long, might be even stronger than Huang Sheng!”

Xu Long!

The strongest expert in the Star Dragon Universe, and he was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage!

“Stronger than Huang Sheng?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock.

“Yes. Xu Long is the oldest God of Creation in all thirteen universes, and he probably entered the peak of the God of Creation Realm before Huang Sheng could reach the large completion stage… Xu Long has been stuck at his level for an unknown amount of time, and his strength definitely ranks in the top three among all thirteen universes!”

“Top three?!” Gu Yuan and Long Yi frowned. Huang Long was also taken aback by the revelation.

However, Huang Xiaolong and Wang Meiqi didn’t find it that surprising. After all, they knew of Mei Jie’s existence. He was a God of Creation with two worlds…

The universe Mei Jie lived in wasn’t the Star Dragon Universe. He was located in the First Universe, and it was ranked at the top of the thirteen universes. It was the first universe created since the start of time, and it had been in existence for far longer than the Star Dragon Universe…
