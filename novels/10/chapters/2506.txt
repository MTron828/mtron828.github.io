Chapter 2507: Primal Ancestor Realm Ghost Devil!

A terrified cry left You Lingzi’s lips when the shadow of death loomed over his head. Boundless ghost qi swarmed out from his body.

It was too bad it scattered the moment it appeared.

The earth trembled unceasingly as the clash caused the grave to shake. Shockwaves filled the space, and the area only managed to regain its original calm after quite some time.

When Lin Xiaoying looked over, she saw that the ground under You Lingzi had crumbled, and a deep bottomless abyss had replaced it.

A Second Heaven True Saint, You Lingzi, who sat in the seventh rank on the leaderboard, was smashed into the ground by Huang Xiaolong!

Her lips parted, and her eyes widened. She stared at the two holy souls floating in the air above Huang Xiaolong, and the words were stuck in her throat.

Is this Huang Xiaolong’s true strength?

However, she didn’t understand how a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint could possess two holy souls!

Before he could explain anything to her, he had to deal with the two ‘corpses’ lying on the ground. With a wave of his hand, he dragged them both towards him.

As they lay in front of Huang Xiaolong in their sorry state, they stared at his holy souls with a face full of shock.

“Huang Xiaolong, you won’t be able to kill us anyway!” You Lingzi suppressed the fear in his heart. As blood dripped down the side of his face, his already pale face turned a little more faint. “So what if you have two holy souls, you won’t be able to kill us!”

A sneer left Huang Xiaolong’s lips as he sealed off the energy in their bodies. He threw them into the Black Corpse Holy Ring, and decided against refining them immediately. After all, he didn’t wish to reveal his dao heart in front of Lin Xiaoying.

Whatever the case, they couldn’t escape death.

After throwing them into the ring, Huang Xiaolong recalled his holy souls, and he turned to look at Lin Xiaoying. He saw her standing rooted to her spot and she seemed to have turned into a statue.

“Umm, are you alright?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he slowly approached her.

She was obviously fine, but she couldn’t conceal the shock in her heart.

“You…” After her thought returned to her, she stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression. She wanted to say something, but her questions got lost in her mind.

“Do you wish to ask about my holy souls?”

Lin Xiaoying stared at him with her puppy-like eyes, and she nodded her head like an obedient child. In the past, she had never been this quiet when she met Huang Xiaolong. However, the battle previously had caused something in her to change. No. It wasn’t actually a battle, but it was a one-sided beatdown…

“We’ll talk after leaving this place.”

The commotion he had caused previously would definitely attract the attention of many, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to fight everyone who came.

After nodding her head again, Lin Xiaoying portrayed an exceptionally cute and innocent look.

After leaving the grave, Huang Xiaolong took her away from the Burial Ground. Since he had already obtained the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury, there was no longer a need to remain in the forbidden region.

Along the way, he killed every single ghost devil they came across. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

When they finally emerged from the Burial Ground, Huang Xiaolong had regained his spot on the leaderboard in the 8th position.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to lie to Lin Xiaoying about his holy souls. He spoke about the transformation of his holy soul, and explained the entire process. After all, it didn’t matter if she knew. After all, they wouldn’t be able to replicate what he had done even if they managed to find a holy lake with the same attributes as the Lake of Ice and Fire in the Holy Heavens.

If replicating what Huang Xiaolong had done was possible, then a ton of people would be able to form their holy souls at the half-True Saint Realm.

Huang Xiaolong had once thought of the reason behind his ability to create his holy souls before entering the True Saint Realm. The conclusion he had come to was that he could evolve all three Saint godheads at once.

“So… You saved me in the Profound River?” Lin Xiaoying seemed to have thought of something.

In the past, she had felt utter despair when was hunted down by Long Zhengyu and Lin Luo of the Devil Palace. However, a dragon-attributed holy soul had appeared out of nowhere and killed the two of them before she could react.

“That’s right,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly.

Even though she had already guessed as much when Huang Xiaolong had revealed his holy souls previously, she jumped in shock when Huang Xiaolong admitted to it. Wasn’t he just a Venerable at that time?

He actually managed to form his holy souls in the Venerable Realm!

That…

Lin Xiaoying no longer knew what to say.

Another day passed in the blink of an eye and Huang Xiaolong’s position on the leaderboards rose to 5th place.

Since You Lingzi and Dou Rui were unable to kill ghost devils, they quickly fell behind. In the span of several days, they dropped out of the top ten and entered the seventeenth and nineteenth rank respectively.

In the plaza outside, the members of the Devil Palace and Ghost Talisman Holy Gate started to panic. The experts of the other superpowers couldn’t help but throw out some guesses.

“It’s been several days and their scores didn’t even move. Did they suffer from some sort of injury from a True Saint Realm ghost devil? Could they be recuperating from their injuries?” Shen Jiewen asked.

“I’m afraid that’s the only possibility…” Duan Xuan nodded slowly. When he thought about Zhang Yihui’s unknown demise several days ago, a sense of irritation welled up in his heart.

Ten days ago, Zhang Yihui and Cang Ping had disappeared from the leaderboards and everyone was riled up. It was especially so when Cang Ping died.

It was nothing for Zhang Yihui to die, as he was a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint. Even though he was strong, there were still existences who could kill him. However, Cang Ping was a True Saint, and he had already formed his holy soul! How could someone like him perish?!

How could something like this happen?

Could there be Primal Ancestor Realm ghost devils in the Ghost Devil City? Or could there be several monsters at that level?

Tyrant Chu, Cao Nan, Mo Cangli, Xue Lingyun, and the Cangqiong Old Man were no longer messing about. The expressions on their faces slowly started to turn serious.

Even though Cang Ping and Zhang Yihui had already died ten days ago, the discussions about them didn’t stop.

“Lord Tyrant Chu, if a Primal Ancestor Realm ghost devil really appeared in the Ghost Devil City, wouldn’t that mean that their highnesses will be in serious trouble?”

A trace of worry flashed in Tyrant Chu’s eye. “We can only leave it up to the heavens…”

Even someone like him wouldn’t be able to do anything about the situation if a Primal Ancestor Realm ghost devil appeared.

…

In the city, Huang Xiaolong was flying through the air with Lin Xiaoying when they heard some weird discussions coming from afar.

“A nameless blood stele has appeared in the Blood Plains! It’s said to be a dao artifact, but we can’t be sure of it!”

“Who cares if the news is real? Xiao Lengxue, Bai Buren, and She Nanfeng are rushing there as we speak. Let’s head over for a look! We might even be able to comprehend some sort of special art from the blood stele and receive unexpected gains!”

Huang Xiaolong and Lin Xiaoying stared at each other with a puzzled look on their faces.

“Xiaolong, why don’t we head over to take a look?”

“Sure!” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Since Xiao Lengxue was there, he could take the chance to deal with another expert from the Devil Palace!

Huang Xiaolong could foresee the Devil Palace’s anger and frustration after losing two devil princes.

After stopping the group of disciples to inquire for more information, Huang Xiaolong and Lin Xiaoying rushed towards the Blood Plains.

After pushing their speed to the limit, they managed to arrive in the Blood Plains after a few days.
