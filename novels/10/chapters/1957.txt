Huang Xiaolong was stunned. He had never expected that even his master wouldn’t be willing to reveal the identity of the high-level Sovereign. It seemed as though the topic of the high-level Sovereign was taboo because even people like Cang Mutian and his master weren’t willing to talk about it.

“Actually, there was a rumor that went around. It was said that the senior only managed to break through because of a stroke of luck. He managed to obtain a mid-level origin herb...” The King of Grandmist explained after thinking about it for quite some time.

Huang Xiaolong cried out in shock.

“With your talent, it’s only a matter of time before you enter the high-level Sovereign Realm.” The King of Grandmist changed the topic and continued, “You are the most talented person I’ve seen... Even that lord won’t be able to compete with you in terms of talent. Don’t worry about breaking through. Everything will happen if you give it enough time.”

Seeing as his master wasn’t willing to speak more about the high-level Sovereign Realm expert, Huang Xiaolong didn’t push the topic. He said, “Master, how long do you think it will take me to enter the Sovereign Realm?”

The King of Grandmist shook his head and chided, “With your monstrous cultivation speed, it’s no use for me to guess, not to mention your heaven-defying luck. No one will be able to guess when you will enter the Sovereign Realm. If you enter seclusion, you will probably break into the Sovereign Realm after several million years. There’s a chance for you to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm after a hundred million years. If your heaven-defying lucky streak continues, you might just pick up an origin treasure along the way. There’s a chance for you to enter the Sovereign Realm after several ten thousand years.”

The difference between several million years and several ten thousand years was huge!

Of course, everything depended on luck.

One could even say that without luck, no matter how talented one was, cultivation would be a long and tedious process.

For the King of Grandmist to arrive at his current level, there had to be a certain amount of luck involved. However, he felt that comparing his luck to Huang Xiaolong’s was like comparing a firefly to a moon.

Even before Huang Xiaolong touched upon the Emperor Realm, he had already refined several purple grandmist aura strands. There was also the Three Lives Flower and the other three devil steles. To top it all off, there was also the other half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance.

Even the King of Grandmist couldn’t help but become envious of his disciple’s luck.

When Huang Xiaolong looked at the envious gaze in his master’s eyes, he felt a little embarrassed, and a giggle escaped his lips. He quickly switched the topic to talk about the happenings in the Radiance World.

“When you head over to the Radiance World, be careful of Dun Ei. His schemes run deep. He is Lan Zhi’s senior brother, and there is no way he will allow you to grab the other half of the inheritance.” A sincere warning came from the King of Grandmist.

“Yes, master.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about Dun Ei at all. In front of absolute strength, schemes were nothing!

The King of Grandmist was no fool. Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had thrown his warning to the back of his mind, he reminded, “Even though Dun Ei isn’t recognized by the origin energy of the Radiance World, he is still the leader of the Radiance World in the name. There are tons of popes and pontiffs under him. He controls half the strength of the Radiance World. It will do you good to prepare yourself.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the past few days, he had already gained an insight into the power Dun Ei held in the Radiance World.

Dun Ei controlled half the strength of the Radiance World, and the other half lay in the hands of the commander of the Radiance Knight Corp, Elan.

The Devil World had the Heavenless Devil Legion, and the Radiance World had the Radiance Knight Corp. The Radiance Ancestor had formed them in the past, and they had the same system as the Heavenless Devil Army. In the Devil World, the Heavenless Devil Legion would only swear allegiance to the party who managed to gather all six devil steles.

The Radiance Knight Corp was the same. Huang Xiaolong would only be able to obtain the Radiance Knight Corp’s power after he accepted the other half of the inheritance.

Huang Xiaolong went on to talk about the King of Shadows and other topics with his master.

He was stunned to learn that the King of Shadows was the younger brother of his other master, the King of Hell!

They were related by blood!

The truth exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s expectations.

“Their relationship was great, but they messed it all up because of a woman.” The King of Grandmist shook his head and sighed. “The King of Shadows left Hell and slaughtered billions of experts because of the devil art he was cultivating. The little brat, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, led an army of several hundred world leaders to hunt him down in the past.”

Huang Xiaolong felt cold sweat dripping off his forehead. Everything happened because of a woman!

“Won’t that mean that the King of Shadows is dead?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

The King of Grandmist continued. “That’s hard to say. He received a massive hit from the Ancient Heavenly Court, and his body exploded. No one could say for sure if his soul was exterminated. Some said that his soul had dissipated, but others claim that his soul managed to escape.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart skipped a beat.

Since even someone like his master wasn’t sure, there was definitely a chance that the King of Shadows was still alive.

“Who is the woman they were fighting over?” Huang Xiaolong thought of a serious question, and he became inquisitive. The woman who could cause the two brothers to turn against each other shouldn’t be a nameless character.

After several moments of silence, the King of Grandmist finally replied. “She’s the sister of the lord...”

Huang Xiaolong’s jaws dropped. “She’s the sister of the high-level Sovereign?!”

The King of Grandmist nodded. “That’s right!” However, he paused for a moment before continuing, “She’s extremely pretty. She was even ranked as the top beauty in the myriad of worlds. In the past, there were many experts whose hearts were taken by her. Not just your master, the King of Hell, but even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and Buddhist Ancestor were moved by her beauty!”

An exaggerated expression appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “How can that old monk fall in love?!”

The King of Grandmist coughed lightly, “Ahem... He’s a man too.”

That was a universal truth. As long as they were men, they would fall in love with her.

Huang Xiaolong felt beads of cold sweat dripping off his forehead.

Huang Xiaolong remained on the Grandmist Lands for ten days. In these ten days, he accompanied Shi Xiaofei and his family members. Other than that, he would look for his master for a chat. Since he had already broken through into the Emperor Realm, the King of Grandmist revealed tons of secrets about the myriad of worlds to him.

After ten days, Huang Xiaolong boarded the Netherking Flying Ship and departed under the concerned gaze of everyone present. He left for the Radiance World.

After ordering the four odd beasts and radiance angels to control the ship, Huang Xiaolong returned to the secret room to cultivate. He swallowed tons of peak-grade grandmist spiritual pills.

With the Netherking Flying Ship’s speed, they arrived in the Radiance World in two short months.

As soon as they arrived, Huang Xiaolong felt the dense radiance energy lingering all around the divine world.

Since the Netherking Flying Ship emitted dense dark energy, the anomaly was noticed almost instantly by the Radiance World’s members. He quickly kept away the Netherking Flying Ship and flew towards one of the massive world surfaces located in the Radiance World.

While Huang Xiaolong entered the Radiance World, Dun Ei stared at the Heavenly Hall hovering in the air above the Sea of Radiance. His expression was extremely ugly. In the past month, he had used all sorts of methods but had failed to open the entrance of the Heavenly Hall. There was no need to mention the other half of the inheritance as they hadn’t even seen the interior of the hall!

“Senior Brother, what do we do now?” Lan Zhi exclaimed in anger. “Even if we fail, we cannot allow Huang Xiaolong to obtain this! Why don’t we destroy the Heavenly Hall?”
