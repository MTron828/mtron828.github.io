Chapter 3264: Several Hundred Million a Year

Huang Xiaolong went on, “When I’m done with the remaining buildings and form a complete Grand Complete Heaven Formation, your progress will increase by tenfold when cultivating here!”

“In-increase tenfold!” Huang Jiyuan and the others were once again dumbfounded on the spot.

Honestly, Huang Xiaolong had minimized the effects of the Grand Complete Heaven Formation, how could the effects be merely tenfold?

Huang Xiaolong subsequently led Huang Jiyuan, and the others on a tour around the rest of the palace buildings. Other than some daily necessities, everything inside was complete. Huang Jiyuan and the others could move in immediately.

“Uncle, those spiritual fruits, can they be eaten now?” Huang Datou suddenly asked, his gaze was fixed on the delicious spiritual fruits, and he gulped slightly.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Of course, you can eat whenever you want, and as many as you want. Let me tell you that I’ve planted close to two hundred Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit Trees!”

“Really?!” Huang Datou was delighted and his face beamed.

Two hundred Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit Trees!

How many Golden Flame Spiritual Fruits would there be?!

Huang Chenfei chided his son jokingly, “You brat only knows the Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit, but the spiritual fruit ripens every ten years, so even if there are two hundred trees, it’s impossible for you to eat them every day.”

Some spiritual fruits ripen every ten years, but there are also spiritual trees that ripen in a few years, and every year. In other words, after the ripe fruits on a Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit Tree were picked, one would have to wait ten years for it to bear fruit again and for the spiritual fruits to ripen.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled watching their interaction, “Don’t worry about that, the soil on this land has become spirit soil, and there’s a spiritual vein underground to support it. Even after we’ve collected the fruits, the trees will bear fruits again the next day, and the fruits could ripen in a day.”

Bearing fruits and ripening in ten years was the norm for Golden Flame Spiritual Fruit Trees, but on this spirit soil, that limitation did not exist. The trees could bear fruits and ripen in a day!

Huang Chenfei, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and Huang Datou were dazed in shock.

“Xiaolong, you mean, these spiritual fruits will all ripen in a day?” Wang Meilan asked in disbelief.

Huang Xiaolong nodded smilingly. “That’s correct, some of them need less than a day, so whenever you are short of money in the future, you can hire people to collect these fruits every day and sell them. Calculating by weight, there will be at least a hundred million catties of harvest every day. These spiritual fruits are much better than the spiritual fruits available in the market today. Even if you sell it for cheap, one low-grade spirit stone for one catty, you’ll get one million low-grade spirit stones!”

“One, one hundred million low-grade spirit stones!”

“In, in one day!” Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, and the others were trembling.

Thinking of this point, Wang Meilan gasped in shock. Doesn’t that mean I can buy a luxurious villa in a day?! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “That’s right, one million low-grade spirit stones in a day is still a conservative estimate. I’ll buy more and better varieties of seeds when I go to the capital and plant them on the remaining empty land. The daily income will definitely exceed a million a day. So earning several hundred million in a year will not be a problem.”

Several hundred million a year!

The spiritual fruit trees suddenly turned into small hills of low-grade spirit stones in Huang Jiyuan’s, Wang Meilan’s, and the others’ eyes.

“In the future, we’ll call this orchard, Blue Dragon Orchard,” Huang Xiaolong informed them. He planned to build a mega orchard like some of the orchards in Huaxia.

Huang Xiaolong let his parents and the others walk around the orchard freely and pick whichever spiritual fruits they liked. As he led his family around, he extended his palm out, facing to the ground and pressed lightly in the air. The ground sank in, leaving a large pit roughly a thousand square meters next to one of the buildings, then Huang Xiaolong tapped his finger at the ground, forming a connection with an underground water source. Water gurgled cheerily to the surface and filled the pit in no time.

A pond was made.

Huang Xiaolong placed a small spiritual water array inside the pond, as well as a dust-free array. This way, the pond’s water would always be clear and clean, and nurtured by the same spiritual vein, the water in this pond would be the best spiritual water on Earth.

The highest quality spiritual water on Earth currently costs ten low-grade spirit stones for a bottle. Though the pond wasn’t very big, it could fill ten thousand such bottles every day.

If his family couldn’t finish the amount of water in this pound, they could sell it as well.

Huang Xiaolong then went to the northern edge of the land and built a large parking space. The cars and flying ships would be kept here, and he took out the two flying ships he had bought.

Huang Xiaolong took a stroll in the outer area of Huazhou City and found a substantial amount of iron and ores, and he forged several more buildings with them.

Hence, when Huang Jiyuan’s group returned to the palace from the orchard, they noticed that there were a few more new buildings added to the ground.

“Dad, Mom, I’ll pass a cultivation technique to you all later. When you cultivate in the future, cultivate according to the technique I taught. The Huang Family’s techniques you all are cultivating now can be put aside,” Huang Xiaolong told them.

“Alright, we’ll listen to you in the future!” Huang Jiyuan agreed despite the complicated feelings that arose in his chest. The miracles he had experienced had vanquished all doubt he had about his son that had only returned for three days.

Huang Xiaolong then tapped the four people’s foreheads and a cultivation method appeared in their mind.

The four people’s talent and physique were different, hence the cultivation techniques Huang Xiaolong passed down to them were different as well. Although these cultivation techniques couldn’t compare to Soaring Dragon Arts or Blazing Dragon Creation Art, they were definitely more sophisticated than the Pangu World’s immortal cultivation techniques. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had improved all four people’s physiques. Hence, within a hundred years, it wouldn’t be a problem for them to break through to the Void Immortal Realm.

After passing them each a cultivation technique, Huang Xiaolong also passed a sword technique to them.

The sword technique that Huang Xiaolong passed to them was the very first sword skill he had learned in the other world, and it was none other than the Asura Sword Skill!

Naturally, the Asura Sword Skill was Huang Xiaolong’s improved version which incorporated his simplified understanding of dao and various kinds of energy.

Therefore, this Asura Sword Skill technique was significantly more powerful than the Asura Sword Skill he had learned in the beginning.

There was also a fist technique that Huang Xiaolong had created himself and named it Dragon Fist.

The four won’t be able to display the full power of the technique at their current strengths. Then again, even if it was one-ten thousandth of power, it was enough to stand at the top of the Milky Way’s mortal world.

After that, Huang Xiaolong had everyone show the techniques according to their understanding while he watched from the side, correcting and guiding their errors.

One round later, all four had roughly grasped the basic movements, Huang Jiyuan had the strongest comprehension ability, followed by Huang Chenfei.

Huang Xiaolong then left the four to practice on their own while he went out further to look for construction materials.

Since the revival of cultivation on Earth, not only were there changes in the geographical map, but the natural resources had grown richer and abundant as well. In a single afternoon, Huang Xiaolong found many materials which contributed to another dozen palace buildings in the Blue Dragon Orchard.

By the end of the day, more than half of the Grand Complete Heaven Formation was completed.

In the evening, Huang Xiaolong and the others drove back to the Golden River Residence villa.

“Xiaolong, there seems to be people watching us from outside the villa?” After returning to the villa, Huang Jiyuan told Huang Xiaolong with a baffled expression.

The four of them had spent the day with Huang Xiaolong, thus none of them had heard what had happened, much less knowing Huang Xiaolong had been convicted as a sinner by the Huang Family.
