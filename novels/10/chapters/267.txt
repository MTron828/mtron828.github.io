Chapter 268: Taking Over Blood Swallow School

Lost, I lost! I actually lost!

Jiang Tianhua looked at Huang Xiaolong with infinite unwillingness in his heart, as well as shock and disbelief. He, someone who cultivated in the Undying Devil Physique and Devil Tribulation Finger, actually lost in the hands of a Seventh Order!

Moments passed, finally Jiang Tianhua spoke, “May I know, your sword skill just now, what battle skill was that?” The powerful sword skill that the young man had shown was mysterious and profound, the rank definitely exceeded his Devil Tribulation Finger.

“Asura Sword Skill.” Huang Xiaolong answered.

Everyone standing in the grand hall, from Chen Xiaotian, Geng Ken, to the rest, had all submitted to him, it mattered not to Huang Xiaolong if they knew the name of the Asura Sword Skill.

“Asura Sword Skill...” Jiang Tianhua repeated the name to himself, but this was the first time hearing this name, Asura Sword Skill.

“Very well, since I’ve lost, I shall submit to you.” Jiang Tianhua looked toward the sky, sighing as he said. The unwillingness and denial were still strong in his heart, however, the truth is the truth. A loss is a loss. Losing means you should adhere to your word, this was his life principle.

“But I hope that you can let them go.” Jiang Tianhua pointed at Cui Ming and the five Blood Swallow School Elders.

“As long as they submit to me, I can spare their lives.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. He had no grudge with Cui Ming or the others, it wasn’t like he absolutely had to kill them, but then again, it was based on the condition that Cui Ming and the five Elders submit to him.

Cui Ming and the five Blood Swallow School Elders hesitated, but in the end, all six of them nodded, choosing to submit. Since their Doyen, Jiang Tianhua, had chosen to submit, what were they resisting for? For them, choosing to submit to a stronger person like Huang Xiaolong may not necessarily be a bad thing.

Next, Huang Xiaolong told Jiang Tianhua, Cui Ming, and the five Elders to release the barriers to their soul sea for him to brand them with a soul mark.

“Soul mark!” Hearing that Huang Xiaolong wanted to brand their souls, Jiang Tianhua and the six others revealed the same expression Chen Xiaotian and every Elder in the Sky Magi Sect did, they were greatly shocked. Still, like their predecessors, the seven of them released their soul seas, allowing Huang Xiaolong to mark them one by one.

Huang Xiaolong secretly breathed in relief when all was done; with Jiang Tianhua, Cui Ming, and the rest submitting, it meant more than half the work was done. He now had the Blood Swallow School in his grasp.

With both the Sky Magi Sect and Blood Swallow School under his control, the remaining entity would be the Nine Fiend Sect. By this point, the Nine Fiend Sect was no longer a big hindrance in his plan to take over the entire Black Demon City. Not to mention, Huang Xiaolong already controlled half of the Nine Fiend Sect’s Elders. In conclusion, he had more than half of Black Demon City’s forces and power at his call.

Instructing Jiang Tianhua and Chen Xiaotian with some tasks, the most important one being watching the Nine Fiend Sect’s movements, he sent Jiang Tianhua, Chen Xiaotian, and the rest away.

As for the Nine Fiend Sect, there was no hurry to gain control immediately, moreover, Huang Xiaolong needed to rein in several Blood Swallow School Elders as well. After Jiang Tianhua, Chen Xiaotian, and the rest left, Huang Xiaolong entered the Xumi Temple. Taking a drop of Geocentric Buddha Elixir, he initiated the Godly Xumi Art to recover his exhausted spiritual force.

One day later, Huang Xiaolong had returned to peak form. After advancing to the second level in the Ancient Puppetry Art, Huang Xiaolong’s recovery period had reduced by many folds.

When Huang Xiaolong was fighting Jiang Tianhua, from the beginning until the end, he did not use the Eye of Hell’s spiritual attack, even more so the Godly Xumi Art. In fact, Huang Xiaolong had decided that in front of others he would try not to use the Godly Xumi Art, if possible.

The Godly Xumi Art was heralded at Martial Spirit World’s number one battle skill, if the news somehow leaked out, Huang Xiaolong would find it hard to protect his own backside even if he broke through the early Saint realm immediately.

In the same quiet manner, five days came and went.

In these five days’ time, Huang Xiaolong branded the remaining Blood Swallow School Elders, totally holding the reins for the Sky Magi Sect and Blood Swallow School in his hands.

Apart from that, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi cultivation continued to improve, stabilizing his recent advancement into Xiantian Seventh Order. The Asura Sword Skill’s seventh move, Death God’s Chain’s attack power also enhanced considerably. Currently, Huang Xiaolong could form forty to fifty chain links with one swing, with each chain reaching several hundred zhang long. Within several hundred zhang square feet, only death remained after Death God’s Chain streaked past.

On this particular day, Huang Xiaolong stood in the small yard after exiting the Xumi Temple, watching the morning sun emerge on the horizon, letting out a heavy breath.

“I hope everything’s fine on Dad and Mom’s side.” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. It had been nearly a year since he left Duanren Empire.

There was also Li Lu. Thinking of Li Lu, her image floated in Huang Xiaolong’s mind. Ever since Li Lu was taken away by her Master the last time, Huang Xiaolong had totally lost all news about her. How was she faring in Deities Templar, Huang Xiaolong has no idea at all.

There was also Yao Fei. A sharp glint flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes at the thought of Yao Fei. After he broke through to the Saint realm, the very first person he was going to kill was Yao Fei.

“Perhaps I won’t need to wait until the Saint realm.” Huang Xiaolong thought; with his strength, as long as he broke through to Xiantian Tenth Order, he was confident he could kill the peak late-Xiantian Tenth Order Yao Fei.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong left the small yard, arriving at the Sky Magi Sect’s grand hall. Calling Chen Xiaotian, he asked about Nine Fiend Sect’s recent movements. Chen Xiaotian answered and reported everything respectfully.

“En, you can go. I’m going to take a stroll outside.” Huang Xiaolong said after Chen Xiaotian kept Huang Xiaolong abreast of the last situation. He had been in Black Demon City for several months, but other than the Sky Magi Sect’s headquarters, Huang Xiaolong had yet to take a look around Black Demon city. Thus, Huang Xiaolong planned to take a walk and relax his heart.

“Young Lord wants to go out?” Chen Xiaotian was dumbfounded, which he quickly disguised by saying, “Then this subordinate shall accompany the Young Lord.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No need, I’ll be fine alone.” If Chen Xiaotian followed him, it would definitely attract the Nine Fiend Sect’s attention. Before Huang Xiaolong decided to make the move on Nine Fiend Sect, it was best if he could slip under the Nine Fiend Sect’s radar.

It seemed that Chen Xiaotian also thought of this point, “Then, should I send two disciples to accompany Young Lord?”

Thinking over the matter, Huang Xiaolong nodded and agreed, “En, then you go arrange it.” Although he was the one behind the Sky Magi Sect and Blood Swallow School, other than the Elders, none of the disciples knew about his identity. Having two Sky Magi Sect disciples with him could reduce many problems.

Thus, Chen Xiaotian somberly went to select two disciples to follow by Huang Xiaolong’s side. Before leaving, Chen Xiaotian especially reminded the two disciples that Huang Xiaolong’s words were his words, Huang Xiaolong’s orders were his orders. No matter what Huang Xiaolong said, they were to follow obediently and carry themselves with proper respect towards Huang Xiaolong.

Though the two disciples were puzzled and surprised about Huang Xiaolong’s identity, neither dared to inquire too much into it. Moments later, Huang Xiaolong left the Sky Magi Sect’s headquarters with the two disciples in tow, to the streets of Black Demon City, looking around. It wasn’t much different from the first time Huang Xiaolong arrived at the city, signs of fighting could be seen everywhere.

The sky above Black Demon City was permeated with a faint scent of blood.

As the three of them were walking, a commotion happened in front of them, the pedestrians on the street hastened to dodge to the sides. Looking over, Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, more than a dozen Nine Fiend Sect disciples were swaggering on the streets, heading his way, led by a young man at the front of the group; he had a pair of peach blossom eyes, lightly fanning himself with a steel fan.

Seeing this young man’s clothing and appearance, Huang Xiaolong already guessed that this young man must be the Nine Fiend Sect Sovereign’s, Hu Han’s son, Hu Sheng.
