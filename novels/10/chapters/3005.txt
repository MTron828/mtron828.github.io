Chapter 3006: I Lost

Boom!

The tail of the golden dragon, Huang Long, smashed into the sea of lightning and a massive blast rocked the space around them.

The confident expression on the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s face finally disappeared.

The members of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, Heavenly Phoenix Race, and the others were unable to peer into the World of Darkness from the outside, and they could only guess what was happening.

“I wonder what’s going on now.” Ao Ji frowned.

“The World of Darkness is the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s strongest ability! He once said that in the World of Darkness, he would be an existence akin to a God of Creation! Everyone would be suppressed by the power of darkness, and it would slowly corrode one’s dao soul and dao heart! No one will be able to break out of the World of Darkness!” Ao Xin, the grand ancestor of the Holy Dragon Race sneered, “It’s over for Huang Xiaolong…”

“Father, if Huang Xiaolong is defeated by the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, do we…” Feng Nana turned to Feng Ming and asked.

She was naturally thinking of exterminating Huang Xiaolong’s physical body after what he did to her.

“Relax. I know what to do…” Feng Ming growled as a sinister light flashed in his eyes.

When the words left his lips, a sudden change happened that caused everyone present to jump. A figure shot out from the World of Darkness.

“Is that Huang Xiaolong?!” Feng Nana exclaimed in joy.

Since the figure was shrouded in light and flying too quickly, no one could see his facial features.

“It has to be!” Ao He chuckled with glee.

When the figure finally started to slow down, the light around his body dissipated and Ao Xin’s eyes widened in shock. “That… That… That doesn’t look like Huang Xiaolong!”

?!

Ao He and Feng Nana were shocked. When the figure finally got closer, cultivators at the level of Ao He and Feng Nana managed to see the face of the person flying towards them.

“Dark… Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor!” They screamed in unison.

The person who came flying out of the World of Darkness was the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, and he didn’t look to be in good shape.

The expressions on Feng Nana’s face froze, and Ao He felt his legs going weak. They looked at the old ancestor with a face full of disbelief. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

How could the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor be sent flying?!

“Hurry up and dodge!” Ao Xin roared. The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was like a meteor shooting through the skies. He shot towards the group of spectators at a speed none of them could comprehend.

By the time they wanted to dodge, it was too late.

The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was flying too quickly, and he soon slammed into the group of spectators.

Everyone in his way was sent flying, and Feng Nana was struck so heavily that she started to vomit blood.

After the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor shot past them, a golden shockwave could be seen charging their way. When it slammed into the various flying ships, they wobbled unsteadily in the air. Even the Radiant Winged Flying Ship, the second strongest flying ship in the Holy Dragon World, spun in the air like a broken top.

No one expected the situation to change so suddenly, and they couldn’t react in time.

When the calm finally returned to the Cloud Dragon Sea, the flying ships started to stabilize in the air. The experts of the various races found their footing, but they were all in sorry shape. Blood mist filled the air as the weaker experts exploded when struck by the shockwave earlier. The Giant Golden Dragon Race experienced the unluckiest fate as the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor crashed into their flying ship. A giant hole could be seen from one end of the ship to the other.

Turning to look at the location where the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor landed, the members of the Holy Dragon Race noticed that the armor on his body was shattered and his flesh was mangled beyond belief.

Sucking in a cold breath, everyone felt the world spinning around them.

The Holy Dragon Armor was the strongest armor in the Holy Dragon World! It was tempered with by the members of the Holy Dragon Race for countless years, and it possessed unfathomable power! In the past, they allowed two peak Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables to test the armor, and even after several years of constant bombardment, not a single scratch was left on the armor! One could only imagine how strong the armor really was!

But now, the armor was broken and the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor looked to be heavily injured!

Even with his Holy Dragon Grand Dao Physique and the Holy Dragon Armor, the old ancestor was beaten to such a sorry state!

Ao He and the others stared at the body of the old ancestor in silence. From the time they were born, no one had ever heard of the old ancestor suffering from any sort of injury!

When everyone was still staring at the figure of the Holy Dragon Ancestor, a figure emerged from the World of Darkness.

“Huang Xiaolong!” A look of terror could be seen on the faces of those present.

Ao He screamed the loudest, and he couldn’t forget the agreement Huang Xiaolong made with the old ancestor before the battle began. If the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor lost, Huang Xiaolong reserved the rights to deal with them as he pleased.

When the experts of the various races saw Huang Xiaolong walking out of the World of Darkness unscathed, their expressions changed. Feng Ming and Ao Ji felt desperation creeping into their hearts when they realized the extent of Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

They might not know how Huang Xiaolong did it, but with their experience, they could tell that the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor only suffered from a single blow before he was flung out of the World of Darkness. If Huang Xiaolong used the same attack on them, wouldn’t it mean…

When he emerged, Huang Xiaolong returned to his human form. No one in the crowd dared to block his path, and they quickly parted to allow him to pass.

Huang Xiaolong ignored Feng Ming and the others as he approached the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.

As a wheezing cough escaped the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s lips, he looked at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression. Eventually, a resigned sigh left his lips. “I lost.”

I lost!

When the two words left the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s lips, everyone felt as though a bomb had gone off in their heads.

Their bodies trembled, and the faces of those who offended Huang Xiaolong turned deathly pale.

In fact, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor still had several tricks up his sleeves. However, after experiencing Huang Xiaolong’s strike, he wasn’t confident that he could block it even if he revealed all his special moves.

As such, he could only admit defeat.

Huang Xiaolong might have won, but no one in the crowd cheered.

“Since you lost, it’s time for you to hold up your end of the agreement.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about anything else, and he simply stretched out his hand towards the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.

After a short moment of hesitation, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor retrieved the Blood Dragon Stele. When he passed it over to Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong looked at the stele that spanned ten feet tall. Excitement filled his heart when he looked at the golden stele, and he knew that he would be able to grow even stronger after he refined the treasures left behind by his father.

“Your Highness, you can retrieve the Holy Dragon Treasury whenever you please.” The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor sighed.

Nodding his head slowly, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Ao He and the others. “All of you, kneel before me.”

“What?!” Ao He, Ao Xin, and those who offended Huang Xiaolong previously felt a ball of rage burning in their hearts when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s order.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Your old ancestor lost to me, and I can deal with you as I please. Do you have a problem with my order? You can kneel here in front of everyone in the Holy Dragon World, and I’ll have more than enough time in the future to think of your punishment.”

“Huang Xiaolong!” Ao He screamed. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong, but the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor sent all of them flying with a single slap before Ao He could utter another word. “The Holy Dragon Race will keep its promise! Who dares to defy my will?!”

As his voice boomed across the skies, everyone in the Holy Dragon Race felt their dao souls trembling in fear.
