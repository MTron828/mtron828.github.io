Chapter 2491: Lin Xiaoying's Rage

Top ten?!

As soon as the words left his lips, the street fell silent.

It was as though crows were cawing in the sky.

“…”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in a daze. Even the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace didn’t believe their ears.

Zhang Yihui of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate roared with laughter, and he nearly tripped over himself.

“Hahaha! I can’t take it anymore! Lucky for you guys, I haven’t eaten yet! Otherwise, I’ll probably puke in disgust.” Zhang Yihui’s face was completely red as he continued, “A Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint dares to dream of entering the top ten! Holy sh*t! Forgive me for my ignorance, but even First Heaven True Saints might not be able to enter the top ten!”

“Hahaha!”

“I’m going to die from laughter!”

Zhang Yihui held his stomach and the members following behind him mirrored his actions completely.

Dou Rui of the Devil Palace couldn’t help but join in the fun. “Huang Xiaolong are you sure your mind is working properly? You might have been thinking with the wrong head!”

It didn’t matter who it was. Even those who were fawning over him previously couldn’t help but crack up with laughter. Ye Wufeng, who had volunteered to bring Huang Xiaolong over to the Knowledge Singularity Chamber of Commerce felt his face heating up.

Even the disciples of the Holy Heavens revealed a bitter smile.

“Thirteen, are you sure you’re fine?” Lin Xiaoying reached out to touch Huang Xiaolong’s forehead. After ensuring that his brain wasn’t fried from having a fever, she heaved a sigh of relief. She even thought that Huang Xiaolong had managed to hurt his brain during one of his cultivation sessions.

During the Trial of Blood, only Second Heaven True Saints had the ability to enter the top ten ranks.

No matter how terrifying Huang Xiaolong’s talent was, the trial emphasized true combat ability. It was impossible for a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint to surpass a First Heaven True Saint, right?

“I’m fine.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly as his gaze landed on Zhang Yihui, Dou Rui, and the rest. “Since you’re skeptical, why don’t we make a bet?”

Dou Rui chuckled as a look of mockery flashed through his eyes. “Didn’t you make a bet with Li Chen previously? You have to give them a piece of saint artifact each if you fail to qualify. Are you planning to challenge us with the same conditions?”

“Saint artifact?” Huang Xiaolong snickered sinisterly. A holy pill appeared in his right hand, and starlight filled the area instantly.

“Star Transferring Holy Pill!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Everyone screamed in unison.

“That’s right. This is the Star Transferring Holy Pill. After obtaining the strand of grandmist holy qi in the Purple Clouds Sea, I traded it with my masters for a hundred of these.” Huang Xiaolong looked at Dou Rui with a trace of mockery. “Do you dare to bet with me? If I fail to enter the top ten position, I’ll give you a Star Transferring Holy Pill. If I do, you’ll have to give me one.”

Dou Rui stared at the pill in Huang Xiaolong’s palm, and he didn’t hesitate to agree. “Let’s do it! However, a single pill is too little, don’t you think?”

It would be a never-before-seen miracle if Huang Xiaolong managed to pass through the trial, much less enter the top ten. Since Huang Xiaolong was willing to hand over holy pills for free, there was no reason for Dou Rui to pass up the chance. That was a holy pill they were talking about! Only Primal Ancestors used holy pills when cultivating!

Since this was a heaven-sent opportunity for him to obtain more holy pills, he had to cherish his chance!

Huang Xiaolong revealed a brilliant smile when he heard what Dou Rui said. “How many do you plan on betting?” Of course, he didn’t forget to add a final sentence. “It doesn’t matter how many you plan to bet. However, you better be able to take them out.”

Initially, Dou Rui had wanted to bet ten pills. After all, they were free holy pills! However, Huang Xiaolong’s sentence stopped him. Gritting his teeth, he growled, “Two… Let’s bet two holy pills.”

Zhang Yihui of the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate couldn’t help but butt in, “Huang Xiaolong, I’ll take you on!” Fearing that Huang Xiaolong would reject, he quickly added, “You came up with the idea. No going back on your words!”

“Can someone like you even take out two holy pills?” Huang Xiaolong sneered as he stared at Zhang Yihui.

“If Dou Rui can bring out two holy pills, why can’t I?” Zhang Yihui’s face was turning redder by the second when he realized the meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong agreed to take the bet.

Soon after, people like Xiao Lengxue and the various young patriarches of their clans joined in the bet.

When the patriarchs of their respective factions heard of Huang Xiaolong’s claims, they rushed over to join in the fun.

In the end, more than fifty people agreed to bet with Huang Xiaolong. Without wasting a second, Huang Xiaolong signed a blood-contract with all of them as they made an oath to the grand dao to honor the bet if they lost.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong also added that the debts would be paid by their respective factions if they were unlucky enough to fall in the Ghost Devil Cty. Since everyone felt that Huang Xiaolong was comparable to santa claus, no one bothered with the details.

With the blood contracts in hand, Huang Xiaolong giggled in his heart. He wasn’t afraid that they wouldn’t pay up now…

Before he made the bet, the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace tried talking him out of it. However, why would Huang Xiaolong reject the free holy pills coming his way? He ignored all three of them, and Lin Xiaoying pouted angrily at the side. This was the first time she had seen someone acting like a wastrel! He was about to lose more than a hundred holy pills!

Even with their background, the Clear Snow Palace wouldn’t be able to take out a hundred holy pills whenever they wished!

“You… You…” Lin Xiaoying glared at Huang Xiaolong and she didn’t know how to chide him. “I’ve seen many stupid people in my life, but I haven’t seen anyone as stupid as you!” She turned around and left immediately. The whatever bloodstone no longer piqued her interest.

As a result, Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi left with their junior sister.

Huang Xiaolong might have been the rarest talent ever to appear in the Holy World. He had three complete dao saint Godheads, and the Holy Mandate Imprint. However, his cultivation realm was still too low! How was he going to enter the top ten with his Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint cultivation base?

Even if a miracle happened, he wouldn’t be able to do so!

Since they felt that it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to come out on top, they were appalled that he took on the bet for more than a hundred holy pills!

Huang Xiaolong could only laugh helplessly when he saw Lin Xiaoying’s ‘angry’ response. He knew that she cared for him, and he didn’t blame her.

“Let’s go take a look at the Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone,” Huang Xiaolong turned and spoke to Chen Yi and the others behind him.

Upon seeing as Huang Xiaolong was still in the mood to buy the Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone, Dou Rui sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, shouldn’t you be running back to your master in tears now? Let’s hope he doesn’t slap you a hundred times for losing more than a hundred holy pills! Hahaha!”

It would be a miracle if Tyrant Chu didn’t blow up on the spot. With his temper, God knew what he would do to Huang Xiaolong when he heard of the bet?
