Chapter 2588: Having a Human as a Master?!

A frown formed on the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor’s face when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s arrogant tone. Even the domain master, the lord of the Dissociation Domain, would never talk to him this way.

Not to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong was a mere human!

One of the experts around the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, Yin Feng, snapped at Huang Xiaolong, “How dare a Second Heaven True Saint like you act with such impudence?! What did you do to the Treasured Moon Holy Emperor and the others?! Do you know that you’re going against the entire Alien Lands by doing this?! You’re asking to die!”

He wasn’t wrong. By making the True Saints of the Alien Lands his slaves, he was stepping on the pride of the cultivators of the Alien Lands. That was an insult to the entire alien race!&nbsp;

Li Yapeng and the other enforcers glared at Huang Xiaolong as killing intent surged through their hearts.

Casually glancing at Yin Feng, Huang Xiaolong made a grabbing motion to pull him over.

Since his actions were too sudden, no one managed to react in time. The Qing Xuan Holy Emperor and the others could only stare at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Yin Feng was a Fourth Heaven True Saint! Moreover, he was already at the mid-Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm, and his combat abilities allowed him to challenge those slightly stronger than him! How could he be captured by Huang Xiaolong, a mere Second Heaven True Saint?!

“Asking to die?” Huang Xiaolong stared at Yin Feng, and he chuckled coldly. “So what if I go against the entire Alien Lands? Do you think I care about going against the entire alien race?”

“You!” Yin Feng stared at Huang Xiaolong with a trace of fear and anger in his eyes. He could have never expected to get caught by someone weaker than him!

“Who in the world are you?!” Xiao Shan’s expression sank. “Release Yin Feng right this instant and we’ll allow you to leave the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds in one piece!”

“Are you saying that I won’t be able to leave if I refuse to hand over Yin Feng?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.&nbsp;

As the standoff happened between the two parties, the factions of the Treasured Moon Holy Emperor, the Scarlet Giant Holy Emperor, and the others received the news.

“What?! The human is going against the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor and the enforcers of the Dissociation Domain?!”

“The human claimed to kill the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor?!”

“More than ten holy emperors agreed to follow under the human as his slaves?! What is going on?!”

The disciples and holy princes of their respective factions erupted when they heard the news.

“This… This isn’t possible! The human is definitely spreading lies!” Liu Jun roared angrily in the Hong Zhen Holy Gate when he received the news, “How dare he spread rumors about killing my master?! My Hong Zhen Holy Gate will definitely hunt down those who dare to continue spreading the rumors!”

As the successor of the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor, his reputation would get destroyed if the ‘rumors’ reached the ears of those from other holy gates!

“This is an insult to our Treasured Moon Holy Gate! No… It’s an insult to all our factions!” A holy prince from the Treasured Moon Holy Gate screamed in a fury.

How could the holy emperors of their factions submit to a human?!

Someone had to be spreading nonsense!

Of course, everyone who raged about the matter had no idea that Huang Xiaolong had turned the tables on the holy emperors after entering the main hall of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate the day before.&nbsp;

“Let’s go over and take a look!” someone suggested.

As soon as Liu Jun and the others heard the suggestion, they soared into the skies and headed straight for the standoff.

“Qing Xuan Holy Emperor?! That’s Princess Qing Ying! Look! Lord Li Yapeng of the Dissociation Domain is here too!” one of the holy princes of the Treasured Moon Holy Gate gasped in surprise.

“Isn’t that Lord Yin Feng? The human is holding Lord Yin Feng by the neck!” A holy prince of the Scarlet Giant Holy Gate yelled in shock. Yin Feng was the right-hand man of the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor, and he was an existence who could call for wind and rain in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds!

Someone like that was captured by the human from the Mysterious Ice Race!

“Aren’t they the holy emperors?!” Someone noticed the Treasured Moon Holy Emperor and the others behind Huang Xiaolong and pointed out soon. There were various hall masters and doyens around them.

Under their shocked gazes, Yin Feng slowly turned into a withered-up corpse.

The Qing Xuan Holy Emperor and the enforcers couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Release Yin Feng right now!” Finally, snapping back to reality, the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor roared. An azure-colored holy sword appeared in his hand as he slashed at Huang Xiaolong.

The sword transformed into an azure dragon as it pounced towards the man. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

With his cultivation base at the peak of the mid-Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm, the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor was one of the ten strongest experts in the Dissociation Domain. A single strike from him contained the power to shatter the heavens and earth and the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds trembled in fear under the strength contained in the single strike.

As he casually glanced at the azure dragon flying at him, Huang Xiaolong exhaled lightly. The terrifying power that had killed the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor the day before, turned into a massive dragon that charged ferociously at the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor.

Unable to contain the shock in his heart, the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor failed to react instantly.

“Be careful!” The three enforcers screamed in unison.

However, their warning came a little too late. The Qing Xuan Holy Emperor was sent flying as Huang Xiaolong’s attack slammed into him.

With wide eyes, Princess Qing Ying stared at her father. As one of the ten strongest experts in the Dissociation Domain, he was sent flying by a single breath! Wasn’t he laughing when he spoke of how he would capture the human for her when they made their way to the Hong Zhen Holy Gate?!

The blood drained from her face as she rushed over to a distant mountain range. “Father!”

Liu Jun and the others couldn’t believe their eyes either. They didn’t believe that the person, who was sent flying, was the Qing Xuan Holy Emperor they respected so much.

Yin Feng, who was slowly being devoured by Huang Xiaolong, stared at the fallen Qing Xuan Holy Emperor in shock too. However, his fate was already sealed when Huang Xiaolong had captured him. He soon lost consciousness.&nbsp;

After sending a thread of energy to blast Yin Feng’s body to pieces, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the three enforcers.

“Submit to me like the Treasured Moon Holy Emperor and the others.”&nbsp;

Their expression turned hideous when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“Take a human as my master?” Li Yapeng raised his head and roared with laughter. The humiliation he was feeling caused him to lose control of his emotions. “Laughable! What a f*cking joke! I’ll rather die than submit to a human!”
