Huang Xiaolong just thought of the little cow when an unexpected loud ‘moo’ broke the treasury hall’s silence. The sound rumbled like thunder, startling Huang Xiaolong.

‘This...!’

Huang Xiaolong looked over his shoulder and saw a sphere of rippling purple-colored liquid spreading out from a corner of the hall.

His figure blurred into a flicker, flying toward the origin of the purple liquid.

A few minutes later, Huang Xiaolong spotted the little cow standing in the air. Bright sparks of light were flickering around its body, especially its two golden horns as they released even more purple-colored liquid.

Compared to half a year ago, the little cow’s tail had doubled in size, filled with dense lightning symbols.

What surprised Huang Xiaolong was the ancient lightning character on the little cow’s forehead. Even though it was a bit vague, Huang Xiaolong was sure it was indeed a lightning character.

Moreover, there was a golden flame burning at the edges of the symbol.

Another half an hour later, the bright sparks flickering around the little cow’s body gradually weakened, even the golden horns returned to normal, no longer releasing any purple liquid. The ancient lightning character on its forehead diminished, yet was still visible.

Huang Xiaolong noticed that the aura around the little cow became even more unfathomable. It was standing there in the air like a lord of all divine beasts.

“Master.” The little cow arrived at Huang Xiaolong’s side, its mouth split into a grin, “Pardon me. Just now, the lightning force within my body evolved, did it disturb you?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “No.” Then he added a question, “You’re close to being able to transform into a human form, right?”

According to his knowledge, a divine beast could generally transform into human form once they reached the Heavenly God Realm. He estimated that the little cow should already have a Heavenly God Realm cultivation, hence he had been wondering why it still couldn’t take human form.

The little cow swung its head left to right, “The common divine beasts can indeed take human form once their strength reached the Heavenly God Realm, but it is still too early for me. If I am not mistaken, even after reaching the Ancient God Realm I still won’t be able to take human form yet.”

Huang Xiaolong was astounded: “Ancient God Realm!”

Even for a divine beast that possessed a top bloodline, that requirement was too high!

The little cow nodded, “That should be so, but even I am not very sure of my origin. Right now, a lot of my memories seem to be sealed, but as my strength improves, the seal will gradually loosen and my memories will come back.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Although he couldn’t determine what kind of divine beast the little cow was, Huang Xiaolong could be certain that its rank was higher than top divine beast bloodline.

‘A chaos spiritual beast!’

The stronger a bloodline, the harder it was to take human form.

However, if the little cow was really a chaos spiritual beast, then what kind of Divine World big shot would give such a priceless reward to him?

Or, could it be the other party was ignorant of this? Had they mistaken the little cow to be the same as other top bloodline divine beast eggs?

Huang Xiaolong remained baffled no matter how many times he thought about it.

A while later, he pushed these thoughts away. In a corner of the treasury hall, he found a divine cauldron that was inscribed with the words ‘black phoenix.’

After locating that divine cauldron, Huang Xiaolong started looking for some steel and ores to forge another spatial ring and new weapons.

Before leaving, he naturally had to take all these treasures with him. However, the space inside the Submerging Dragon Ring given by the Barbarian God Sect was just too small, same with the spatial rings he harvested from other people. Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to fit all the items inside this Zhenyu Sect treasury in them, so he planned to forge a spatial ring containing a giant space.

As for the ring’s shape, he planned to forge it according to the Asura Ring.

As for suitable weapons, he decided to go with the Blades of Asura as well as the Mulberry Sword after a slight thought.

Three days later, a brand new Asura Ring, two Blades of Asura, and a Mulberry Sword were successfully refined. Looking at the familiar ring, and the three weapons, Huang Xiaolong liked them even more.

The space within this Asura Ring was ten thousand times larger than the Submerging Dragon Ring. This was Huang Xiaolong’s current limit.

Although he might not be able to take away everything here, a large portion of it wasn’t a problem.

After binding the Asura Ring, Blades of Asura, and Mulberry Sword with a drop of his blood, Huang Xiaolong began moving in the treasury into his Asura Ring. As for the five spiritual veins, he moved them into the Godly Mt. Xumi.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow spent a few more days in the treasury, then one person and one cow exited the hall and headed to the ancient transmission array outside. After activating it, they were transported back to the original spot at the bottom of the cliff.

Half a year passed, so the ancient transmission array below the cliff was once again covered by a thick layer of ice.

The air below the cliff was frosty white, swirling before their eyes like fog. Clearly, in that half a year, no one else came to this place.

Huang Xiaolong thought for a moment, then added another formation to hide the ancient transmission array. Although it doesn’t seem like anyone would come here, it was better to be safe than sorry.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong’s worry was superfluous. Even if anyone managed to reach the bottom of the cliff and found the ancient divine formation, there was no chance for them to know how to decipher the Silver Devil Clan symbols at the center of the ancient divine formation, bluntly blocking any possibility of activating it.

Then again, even if someone recognized the symbols and entered the Zhenyu Sect’s giant mountain, they still wouldn’t be able to enter the treasury hall without the broken blade key.

“Xiaoniū, let’s go.” Riding on the little cow, the two flew back up to the cliff above. However, due to the coldness and white fog, the little cow’s ascending speed was quite slow. It was half an hour later when they reached the cliff top.

“Master, since you want to rush back to the Barbarian God Sect for the three sects’ joint training, can you bring Xiaoniū with you? I’ll die of boredom if you leave me behind in the Barbarian God Sect.” The little cow said pitifully.

“Let’s see first.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Logically, he should be able to bring his mount to the joint training, but it still needed to be confirmed.

Riding on the little cow, Huang Xiaolong headed back to the Jadeite Royal City, planning to stay there for a couple of days before heading back to the sect.

But, not long after the two of them left the cliff in the direction of the Jadeite Royal City, two groups of people appeared close to the cliff.

The first were two young female disciples dressed in the Barbarian God Sect’s inner disciple robe, while the latter group pursuing from behind consisted of five young men clad in the Great Whale Sect’s inner sect disciple robe.

“Liu Yan, I advise you to hand over that Blood Jasper Ganoderma, otherwise you’ll sorely regret it. When I catch you, it’ll be too late to beg!” A Great Whale Sect inner disciple shouted. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The two Barbarian God Sect female disciples became anxious, slightly panicking.
