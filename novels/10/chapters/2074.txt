Chapter 2075: Unable to Withstand One Blow?

Half an hour later, the Ancient Heavenly Court reached the base of the Divine Tree of Darkness’ trunk.

The Ancient Heavenly Court was as big as a super world surface, but its size was insignificant before the Divine Tree of Darkness.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re finally here!” Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Divine Tree of Darkness, a cold, indifferent voice sounded.

In the next second, Huang Xiaolong’s group saw two young men arriving in a Nine Dragons Carriage, and a group of Sovereigns was following closely behind them.

The two young men were naturally Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s attention was not on the two young men. He was looking at Bei Xiaomei and Bei Xiaoji. At the back of the Nine Dragons Carriage were two thick ropes binding the sisters, dragging them across the air as the nine dragons flew forward.

Looking at the sisters’ sorry state, fury erupted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and killing intent roiled in his heart. At the same time, a small part of him was relieved. Although the sisters’ appearance seemed a little miserable, no harm had been inflicted on them.

Huang Xiaolong’s icy-cold gaze was locked on the haughty Wan Zhuoyuan seated in the Nine Dragons Carriage as he said, “You’re that so-called Wan Zhuoyuan? You deserve to die!”

DIE!

Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent caused the surroundings’ temperature to drop sharply.

Wan Zhuoyuan seemed indifferent to the violent, murderous aura surging from Huang Xiaolong’s body. He laughed as he spoke, “What? Huang Xiaolong are you feeling distressed for your woman? Don’t worry. I haven’t touched your woman yet. Wait until I’ve defeated you, I’ll do her in front of you, and let everyone in the myriad worlds see the consequences of going against the City of All-Heavens!”

“You want to save your woman, then stop hiding inside the Ancient Heavenly Court like a coward. Come out and fight me!”

“Heihei, if you refuse to come out, I’ll strip your woman naked on the spot for all to view!” Wan Zhuoyuan’s eyes gleamed with hatred, and his hand roughly tugged at the thick rope binding Bei Xiaomei. His fingers then clutched around Bei Xiaomei’s slender neck.

“Stop!” Huang Xiaolong yelled angrily. Disregarding the Reverence Moon Old Man and the others’ persuasion, he dashed out from the Ancient Heavenly Court and appeared in front of Wan Zhuoyuan in a split second.

“Release Xiaomei and her sister.” Huang Xiaolong’s sharp gaze was locked on Wan Zhuoyuan, “Then, I will leave you a complete corpse!”

Wan Zhuoyuan burst out in laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, I should be the one saying that. Still, rest assured that after I capture you and dig out all your secrets, I won’t leave you a complete corpse!” He threw Bei Xiaomei towards the group of City of All-Heavens’ experts and ordered, “Watch her well, I get the first taste later!”

Wan Zhuoyuan leaped into the air, dazzling golden lights shining from his body. This golden light actually shone through the Divine Tree of Darkness’ black light.

Wan Zhuoyuan’s momentum continued to rise.

Elan, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor Wu Shaowu, and the others’ faces tightened with tension. Wan Zhuoyuan, who was only a pinnacle of peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm cultivation, actually had a stronger momentum than them, and it was still rising.

Soon, Wan Zhuoyuan’s momentum superseded early Third Order Sovereign Realm experts, then mid-Third Order, peak mid-Third Order, and late-Third Order Sovereign!

Wan Zhuoyuan’s momentum continued to rise to the peak late-Third Order Sovereign! In a final burst, Wan Zhuoyuan’s strength exceeded the peak late-Third Order Sovereign Realm experts!

He was comparable to an early Fourth Order Sovereign!

The King of Darkness, Cang Mutian, Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, and the others were genuinely shocked, including Huang Xiaolong. Not to mention the experts spectating from afar.

“This, how is this possible!? All are ants Under the Sovereign Realm. This Wan Zhuoyuan’s cultivation is clearly at the pinnacle peak late-Tenth Order Emperor, but his momentum can suppress any peak late-Third Order Sovereign experts!”

Many of the old monsters hidden in the surroundings’ shuddered. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What kind of unique physique does this Wan Zhuoyuan have? It’s more domineering than the Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s Heaven’s Dao Physique. It’s ten times, no, a hundred times stronger! In this universe, what kind of unique physique is stronger than the Heaven’s Dao Physique?”

The spectating experts stirred.

The Reverence Moon Old Man, King of Grandmist, and the others hovered in indecision.

“...Stronger than the Heaven’s Dao Physique, unless it’s...!” The little cow’s eyes narrowed as a probability flashed in her mind. Her expression worsened as she said, “Unless it’s the saint physique! According to legend, above the divine physiques, there were saint physiques!”

“Saint physique!” The King of Darkness, Cang Mutian, Du Hai, and the others exclaimed in shock.

The Reverence Moon Old Man was no exception, “Although there is a legend that says there are saint physiques above the divine physiques, we have never heard of anyone possessing a saint physique. If this Wan Zhuoyuan really possesses a saint physique, then the existence of Venerable Realm...?”

“It is said that when a Venerable Realm expert is reborn, they would have an innate saint physique. Not only that, they would also have the saint bloodline, something more powerful than the archdevil bloodline’s power by many folds!”

“Furthermore, legend has it that when a Venerable Realm expert is reborn, not only he is born with the saint physique and saint bloodline, but even his godhead is the complete dao saint godhead that supersedes all other godheads. As he cultivates, he would awaken more memories of his past life, and with the complete dao saint godhead, it is almost certain they could step into the Venerable Realm again!” The little cow explained.

Because the little cow and Reverence Moon Old Man did not lower their voices, their words clearly reached Huang Xiaolong and other experts’ ears.

Huang Xiaolong and the surrounding experts were shocked.

Saint physique, saint bloodline, and Complete Dao Saint Godheads!

Venerable Realm!

As Huang Xiaolong’s shock receded, a thought sprouted to his mind. Upon breaking through to the Sovereign Realm, my three king of supreme godheads and archdevils’ bloodlines had evolved. Could it be that my current godheads have evolved to complete dao saint godheads, and the three archdevils’ bloodlines were now saint bloodlines?

This was because Huang Xiaolong could feel that the power of his current godheads was definitely stronger than any godheads, and his three archdevils’ bloodlines were stronger than any known archdevils’ bloodlines.

At this time, Wan Zhuoyuan laughed sonorously and admitted frankly, “That’s right, I am exactly a reincarnated Venerable you’re speaking of. In my eyes, all of you are nothing but mere mortals. These so-called Sovereigns and overlords are no different than the ants crawling on the ground. Huang Xiaolong, I’ll let you understand today that your so-called talent is just dog shit!” With that said, Wan Zhuoyuan’s fist punched towards Huang Xiaolong.

"If you can withstand one punch from me, I’ll leave your corpse intact!” The surrounding space collapsed as Wan Zhuoyuan swung his fist at Huang Xiaolong. The power of this punch could deter the Buddhas, scatter the devils, and subjugate the gods.

Heaven and earth seemed to prostrate before the power of Wan Zhuoyuan’s fist.

Huang Xiaolong issued a cold harrumphed seeing this and his three godheads spun as he met Wan Zhuoyuan’s fist with his own. Origin energy capable of shattering an era, swirled around his fist and surreal dragons danced around his arm as millions of archdevils and golden Buddhas emerged.

Rumble~~~!

The fanatic confidence on Wan Zhuoyuan’s face stiffened the moment their fists collided before shock took over. Then the spectators saw Wan Zhuoyuan getting knocked backwards like a falling meteor from the collision.

Everyone watching was dumbfounded.

Lord Wan Shi’s grandson, Wan Zhuoyuan, is he really a Venerable Realm expert’s reincarnation?

Doesn’t he have the saint physique and saint bloodline? Didn’t he have the complete dao saint godhead? But he could not withstand one blow from Huang Xiaolong?!

Maybe, they had seen it incorrectly, or perhaps, it was the Reverence Moon Old Man and the little cow who had guessed incorrectly?

The Reverence Moon Old Man and little cow were utterly stupefied.

This... is not real, right?
