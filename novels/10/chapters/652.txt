Almost immediately, Huang Xiaolong felt a vast, pure, yet gentle high-quality source of energy enter his body, from his Qi Sea to his meridians, moving on to his soul sea and other parts of his flesh.

‘Is this godforce?!’ A comfortable feeling spread to every part of Huang Xiaolong’s body. The Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art circulated, while droplets of energy derived from godforce were devoured at a frightening speed by Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong noticed that his True Dragon Physique, being tempered by godforce, was becoming stronger at a rate visible to the naked eye. Whether it was strength or defense, both were improving at rapid speed.

Simultaneously, both the god battle qi within his Qi Sea, as well as his soul sea were experiencing great changes; his god battle qi became increasingly purer, while his soul sea expanded, emitting a brilliant golden glow.

The time and space law threads within Huang Xiaolong’s soul sea slowly integrated with the God’s Law flowing out from the rank five godhead, transforming, evolving, becoming denser and thicker. Their surface seemed to be coated with a layer of golden light, emitting a penetrating radiance that increased the force of Huang Xiaolong’s attacks.

Moreover, after integrating with the God’s Law, when Huang Xiaolong would be attempting to break through to Highgod Realm in the future, the transformation process of his time and space law into God’s Law would be much easier and smoother.

The space inside a godhead was akin to an independent small world that held an ocean of abundant godforce, stretching as far as the eye could see.

In one night, Huang Xiaolong had absorbed and refined more than one thousand drops of godforce!

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed, even Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s jaw dropped to the floor in wonder. This speed was truly horrifying, for not even a Highgod Realm master could refine one thousand drops of godforce in a single night!

Which meant that Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation speed was even faster than an average Highgod Realm master! For any other Sixth Order God Realm cultivator, refining one drop of godforce would take them ten days to half a month.

Soon, two months passed.

In these two months, during the day, the Ascending Moon Old Man would teach Huang Xiaolong pill concoction, whereas, at night, Huang Xiaolong would cultivate, absorbing godforce as well as God’s Law from the godhead.

After two months of guidance under the Special Rank Alchemist Grandmaster, the Ascending Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong’s alchemy skill improved by leaps and bounds to the point where even a Special Rank Alchemist Grandmaster like the Ascending Moon Old Man couldn’t resist praising him once or twice.

On top of that, absorbing godforce and God’s Law every night helped enhance Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation and strength at a shocking speed.

Also, in these two months, the Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang made frequent visits to the Golden Dragon Peak, guiding Huang Xiaolong together with the Ascending Moon Old Man. With Feng Yang’s strength, traveling from his place to the Golden Dragon Peak was a matter of a few seconds with a simple Greater Space Shift.

On this day, Huang Xiaolong had just exited the old man’s courtyard and was on his way back to his own residence when he passed by Xie Puti’s yard. His feet stopped briefly before making his way inside.

Xie Puti was sitting in the yard, finding solace in wine. He was so lost in thought by something troublesome that he didn’t even notice Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

“What are you thinking about?” Huang Xiaolong spoke, a faint warm smile on his face.

Only then did Xie Puti recover from his thoughts. Seeing Huang Xiaolong, a rarely seen smile spread over his face: “You’re here.”

Huang Xiaolong took a seat as Xie Puti filled a cup for him.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “This cup is too small, not even enough for a mouthful; we’ll use something bigger.” He took out two jugs of good wine from his spatial ring as he said that.

Without another word, the two men each grabbed one of the jugs and gulped down a large mouthful.

“It has been a long time since I’ve actually enjoyed a drink.” Xie Puti let out a laugh.

“Right, it has been some time.” Huang Xiaolong lamented in agreement. When they were still in the Martial Spirit World, this was how they drank whenever they met.

Huang Xiaolong could still remember the time when the both of them drank Sapidity Wine during their stay in the Duanren Institute, the Sapidity Wine House sold a limited number of wine jugs daily. Once, they brought all the remaining Sapidity Wine for the day, creating a conflict with the Guo brothers.

Huang Xiaolong and Xie Puti weren’t brothers by blood, but their relationship was no different than that of real brothers.

After a few rounds, Huang Xiaolong solemnly said, “I’m sorry.”

Xie Puti was dazed for a moment before realizing that Huang Xiaolong was referring to his Xie Ancestor. Shaking his head, Xie Puti said, “It is me that should be apologizing. When my Ancestor and the rest were killed by the All Dragons League, it created trouble for you. Also, without you, who knows when I would have broken through to Saint realm!”

Huang Xiaolong sighed heavily in his heart. Despite his Master Feng Yang having Lin Tong, Ceng Leng, and the All Dragons League Enforcers and disciples locked up in the Black Warrior Institute’s dungeon, nothing could be done about Wang Na, that old witch, even though she attacked the Golden Dragon Peak last time.

As for that Jiang Yu, since he had already turned into an idiot, Feng Yang’s hands were bound from levying further punishment on him.

“Come, drink up!” Huang Xiaolong clinked his jug against Xie Puti’s, gulping down the fiery liquid down his throat.

Both men drank to their heart’s content.

Still, Huang Xiaolong could see there was something on Xie Puti’s mind, thus he asked, “Are you still thinking about your Ancestor’s matter?”

Xie Puti shook his head, “No,” his words paused slightly here before continuing, “Do you still remember when I mentioned that there is a woman I like?”

“I remember, you said that the other side’s lowest requirement is that you must breakthrough to God Realm before agreeing to associate with you seriously.” Huang Xiaolong said. He remembered this matter clearly because it was Xie Puti’s matter.

Xie Puti nodded, but there was hesitation in his voice, “She asked to meet me ten days later in Black Warrior City.”

Huang Xiaolong thought for a moment, asking: “You want me to accompany you?”

“It’s just that I don’t want to disturb your practice, so I...” Xie Puti’s voice reduced to a mumble.

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “What’s there to disturb, it’s not like we’re going to the Azure Dragon Galaxy, how much time would it take? Coincidentally, spending so much time with that Ascending Moon Old Man is suffocating, I was thinking of taking a stroll around the Black Warrior City to relax a little.” Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that this woman asking to meet Xie Puti was not as simple as it seemed.

Xie Puti’s face lit up hearing Huang Xiaolong promise to accompany him, and no longer refused. Both of them continued to drink the night away, their words were spoken through wine.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong brought the matter up with the Ascending Moon Old Man, saying that he planned to go Black Warrior City. Unexpectedly, not only did the Ascending Moon Old Man not object, the old man even amiably agreed, “Just as well, this old man also feels like going out for some air, I’ll come with you guys.”

Huang Xiaolong could only smile bitterly in his heart.

He didn’t expect this old man would want to tag along for a short trip, who knows what kind of trouble this old man would cause later. Then again, Huang Xiaolong was powerless to stop the old man if he wanted to follow, thus Huang Xiaolong could only consent.

Then, Huang Xiaolong went and asked his parents, and they too wished to go out. After all, there was the Ascending Moon Old Man, this super bodyguard with them. Huang Xiaolong need not worry about their safety.

When everything was settled, three days before the appointed time, a group departed from the Golden Dragon Peak, heading toward the Black Warrior City.

Other than his parents, there were also his siblings, Huang Xiaohai and Huang Min, his nephew Guo Xiaofan, brother-in-law Guo Fan, the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey Huang Xiaoyong, Heaven Devouring Beast Lil Tian, the Blessed Buddha Emperor Shi Fantian and his Empress Lin Meng, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu.

Adding Huang Xiaolong, the Ascending Moon Old Man, and Xie Puti, there were fifteen of them in total.

Because their cultivations were in the Saint realm and above, they flew instead of riding on beast mounts.

Laughter could be heard the entire way.

Stepping out from the transmission array, several members of the Huang Family cheered on the Black Warrior City’s street. Being cooped up inside the Golden Dragon Peak for the last several years had nearly bored them to tears.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
