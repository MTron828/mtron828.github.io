The Gu family ancestor, Gu Fei, stood up and said to the inspector, “Senior Gu Zheng, how should we handle this matter?”

Gu Zheng replied with indifference, “A mere early-First Order God King dares to act so arrogantly in the Brookspring Plane?! If I hadn’t learned about him, he might have lived for a few more days. It’s too bad that I learned of him through you guys. Now that I’m here, I can’t allow him to act so arrogantly. Order your men to look for him and report back to me.”

Gu Fei smiled and said respectfully, “Yes, I will pass on the order.” He then took out his summoning signal and transmitted the order to the grand elders below him.

After Gu Fei passed the order, Gu Zheng then continued, “Take a seat and let us drink some wine together.”

Gu Fei bowed respectfully before taking his seat.

“I have heard that Senior Gu Zheng broke through to the Fourth Order God King Realm a few years ago?” Gu Fei complimented with a smile, “Senior Gu Zheng is extremely talented to be able to become a Fourth Order God King in a few hundred thousand years. With your talent, it’s only a matter of time before you become a Heavenly Monarch or even an Emperor!”

Gu Zheng laughed and appeared to be in a good mood. “Fortunately, with my talent, it is not too difficult to become a Heavenly Monarch. However, it’s too difficult to enter the Emperor Realm!” He shook his head but a wide smile hung on his face.

“Is there anyone who doesn’t know that Senior Gu Zheng is a rare talent in our Gu Family? You’re also a direct great-great-grandson of the Great Ancestor. If Senior Gu Zheng is unable to break through to the Emperor Realm, I’m afraid none of the inspectors in the Gu family will be able to do so either.” Gu Changcun flattered.

“You’re right, Senior Gu Zheng would surely become an Emperor within ten million years!”

“I think eight million years will suffice!”

The grand elders in the main hall competed with one another to curry favor with him.

Gu Zheng’s fat face seemed to be split apart with how wide he was smiling and his eyes narrowed into slits.

Laughter could be heard in the main hall from time to time as the grand elders praised him without end.

As they were messing about in the main hall of the Gu Family, Huang Xiaolong had already arrived on the Ghost Continent.

Putting away the Black Dragon Throne, his figure flashed and he appeared on top of a mountain range.

Based on the Gu family elders’ memories, this mountain range was called the Keshen Mountain Range and was one of the largest mountain ranges in the whole of the Ghost Continent. There were numerous bandit strongholds and if he wanted to arrive at Mongolia City, he would have to cross the Keshen Mountain Range.

Despite just arriving at the Keshen Mountain Range, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a hurry to go to Mongolia City.

The Netherworld King’s Organization held two recruitments every year and there were still five month before the next. He planned on staying in the Keshen Mountain Range for several months before heading over.

Even though the three treasures of the Primordial Black Dragon Race were already in his hands, he had yet to cultivate the Black Dragon Body Art. With the time he had before the next round of recruitment, Huang Xiaolong decided to remain on the Keshen Mountain Range and study the Black Dragon Body Art.

Huang Xiaolong expanded his soul outwards before flying towards one of the mountain peaks near him.

As he was soaring through the air, a loud yell reverberated through the air. “Stop!” Immediately after, a group of people flew out from the shadows.

All of them were dressed in a weird get up and their strength varied greatly. The strongest member of the group was a mid-First Ancestor God Realm cultivator and the weakest of them all was in the Fourth Order Ancient God Realm.

They must be a group of bandits in the Keshen Mountain Range. From the looks of it, most of them are from the Asura Race, and the rest came from the Devil Race, Ghost Race, and the Dark Monk Race.

The Ghost Race was rarely seen in Hell and each one of them had hideous appearances. Even though they had blood and skin just like the Asura and Devil Race, they didn’t have flesh in their bodies. They were extremely thin but their bodies were lanky. They were twice the height of the members of the Asura Race.

As for the Dark Monk Race, their bodies were completely black in color. Their eyes and hair were the only parts of their bodies that were white in color, forming a stack contrast to their bodies.

“Brat, hand over your...” When one of the bandits in the peak of the late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm was about to ask Huang Xiaolong to hand his spirit ring over, all of them were sent flying with a flick of his wrist. They slammed into the distant mountain ranges but that wasn’t the end of it.

A shocking suction force came out from Huang Xiaolong’s palm and all of them were dragged before him once again.

The hundreds of bandits were terrified when they witnessed Huang Xiaolong’s power.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed and a purple ‘soul’ marking appeared and flew into the space between their eyebrows. In the blink of an eye, all of them fell under Huang Xiaolong’s control.

To control these bandits, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even need to use the grandmist worms. All he used was the Grandmist Puppetry Art.

After subduing all the bandits, his figure blurred and he went to all the strongholds around the Keshen Mountain Range. In half a day, thousands of bandits fell under his control.

Even though the bandits weren’t very strong, there were still over four hundred thousand of them. Amongst them, there were about two hundred early stage Ancestor Gods. In the Brookspring Plane, they could form a considerable force.

Of course, the main reason he dealt with all of them was because he didn’t want them to interrupt him when he studied the Black Dragon Body Art.

After taking control of all the bandits in the Keshen Mountain Range, Huang Xiaolong chose one of their hideouts as his temporary residence. Not only were the hideouts well built, but spiritual flowers and grass could also be seen growing around the residences. It was a pity that the materials they used were pretty low grade.

Huang Xiaolong took out some of his Dragon Race Essence Stone and rebuilt the hideout. After a day’s work, the shoddy buildings were no more and he even set up dozens of ancient restrictions to hide his location.

Huang Xiaolong finally settled down to cultivate in peace.

In the day, Huang Xiaolong would consume a high-grade grandmist spiritual pill and cultivate his Grandmist Parasitic Medium. At night, he would transform into the Primordial Dragon and cultivate the Black Dragon Body Art.

Four months passed in a blink of an eye.

One day, Huang Xiaolong left the hideout and stretched his body as he sucked in a breath of fresh air on a mountain peak.

From the top, he could see the entire scenery of the mountain range.

It’s not too bad... Looks pretty pretty.

However, in Hell, where there was no sunlight the whole year round, nothing seemed especially pleasing to the eye. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s about time for me to go to Mongolia City.” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Even though there was still about ten days left before the recruitment, there was no harm in reaching there early.

For the past few days, he had also instructed the bandits under him to look for the Asura Branch Sect in the Brookspring Plane. From their reports, it seemed as though there wasn’t any disciple called Ren Wokuang in the Brookspring branch.

Regarding this, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t too disappointed either. After all, there were hundreds of thousands of Asura Branch Sect. Even if his master, Ren Wokuang, was in the Asura Sect, it would be too much of a coincidence if he happened to be in the Brookspring branch.

Huang Xiaolong left the mountain range on the next day and headed towards Mongolia City.

Huang Xiaolong brought along four Second Order Ancestor Gods with him in case he needed them to handle some dirty work.
