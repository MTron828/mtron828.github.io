The last time he was at the Nefarious Devil Tribe Island, his cultivation was only a Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm, not even mid-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm. At that time, he was twice as careful facing these thick rolling death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy of Yama Plains.

However, this time around these death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy posed no threat to Huang Xiaolong at all.

Huang Xiaolong disappeared into the darkness riding on the little cow. Chaos spiritual beast Black Baboon following closely behind them.

This time around, other than the little cow, Huang Xiaolong had only brought chaos spiritual beast Black Baboon with him.

Xie Tu, Xie Du, and both Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, as well as his swarm of Golden Gorb Insects had been left at the Barbarian God Sect.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong’s group of three reached the entrance to the Nefarious Devil Tribe’s ancestral burial ground. With his Eye of Hell, Huang Xiaolong determined the positions of the twelve guardians.

During his last visit, he had used a concealment method to sneak into the ancestral burial grounds as he was afraid that he’d be discovered by the twelve guardians.But things were different now. Huang Xiaolong used the soul attack of his Eye of Hell— bursts of blood-red light enshrouded the twelve guardians in an instant and broke through their defenses exerting control over them.

The twelve peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm guardians were completely powerless to struggle against Huang Xiaolong.

After the twelve guardians were under his control, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the Black Baboon swaggered in, breezing through the Imperial Great Killing Formation at the entrance to the Nefarious Devil Tribe ancestral burial grounds.

Within the ancestral burial grounds, death qi and nefarious qi rolled thick as clouds. In Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, the death qi and nefarious qi looked denser than before but he wasn’t bothered. His Archdevil Supreme Godhead spun at high speed, frenziedly swallowing the surrounding death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy into his body.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of three flew further in of the ancestral burial ground and soon, Huang Xiaolong saw the first tomb.

When Huang Xiaolong was here during his first visit, he had checked all of the ninety tombs— from the first to the ninetieth. Therefore, during this time Huang Xiaolong went straight to the ninetieth tomb with the little cow.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong reached his target destination— ninetieth tomb. He stood in front of the tomb entrance and looked at the dense death qi and nefarious qi that were resembling a sturdy ancient city wall. Huang Xiaolong didn’t ask for help from the little cow nor had the Black Baboon open a path. He activated his Archdevil Supreme Godhead and absorbed the death qi and nefarious qi that was in front of him.

He wasn’t able to break past the dense death qi and nefarious qi the last time he was here, but this time around he planned to absorb them to help him break through to late-Second Order Ancient God Realm.

While Huang Xiaolong entered the ninetieth tomb at the Nefarious Devil Tribe ancestral burial ground; the Ouyang Family disciple whom Huang Xiaolong had previously let go on purpose was kneeling on the floor of Ouyang Family great hall, holding his breath in apprehension.

A one-armed, silver-haired old man and a robust old man were sitting on the Ouyang Family great hall main seats. These two old men were Elders who were sent by Dragon Origin Sect and Twin Cities Sect. Their names were Wu Ruiping and Lu Xiaodong.

Both Wu Ruiping and Lu Xiaodong were Ancient God Realm Elders who had came to assist Ouyang Family in subjugating nearby islands’ forces. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ouyang Family Ancestor Ouyang Bin and Ouyang Family Patriarch Ouyang Xuguang were both sitting in positions lower than Wu Ruiping and Lu Xiaodong, looking at them respectfully.

“Elders, I didn’t expect for Huang Xiaolong to be back already!” Ouyang Bin said, worry clearly written on his face.

“I have also heard that Huang Xiaolong has already broke through to peak mid-Second Order Ancient God Realm, with his fighting prowess, I’m afraid the average peak mid-Third Order Ancient God Realm cultivators are worse than him ah!” Ouyang Xuguang woefully added.

Wu Ruiping sneered with a disdainful tone, “A scanty Second Order Ancient God Realm disciple already frightened all of you to this extent? What’s there to be afraid of? Don’t tell me that you both Seventh Order Ancient God Realm masters cannot deal with a Second Order Ancient God Realm disciple!”

Lu Xiaodong also had an icy expression as he said, “It’s just Huang Xiaolong, if it wasn’t for him being a personal disciple of Golden Brow and Blood Knife , my pinky is enough to squash him to death!”

Ouyang Bin and Ouyang Xuguang smiled wryly. Of course they knew that Huang Xiaolong was just a Second Order Ancient God Realm disciple, but the problem lay in the fact that he was the personal disciple of Fortune Gate Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

Who would dare to touch Huang Xiaolong? Wasn’t that akin to seeking death?

“Don’t worry, with Golden Brow and Blood Knife’s identity, they will not interfere in Ouyang Family’s matters.” Wu Ruiping added, “Your Ouyang Clan continues to expand. If Huang Xiaolong appears again, we will come out to help you flatten this roadblock!”

Lu Xiaodong then added, “Huang Xiaolong is the Fortune Gate Ancestors’ disciple; our Twin Cities Sect’s Tan Lin is also a Fortune Gate Ancestor’s disciple, and so is Dragon Origin Sect’s Zhou Xu. If he has a backing, then don’t our Dragon Origin Sect and Twin Cities Sect have a backing as well? Also, not to mention Lord Wang Wei is also my Twin Cities Sect’s disciple!”

Ouyang Bin and Ouyang Xuguang finally felt reassured.

“The two Elders are right, we were overly worried.” Ouyang Xuguang laughed.

Ouyang Bin chimed in, “Huang Xiaolong said he will soon come to reap our lives, then let us wait and see how he is going to do that!”

......

Within the ninetieth tomb, Huang Xiaolong sent a coffin cover flying with a punch of his fist, revealing a Nefarious Tribe expert’s corpse lying inside.

A complete corpse with its Gold Core!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t hide his joy, ‘It seems like my luck is not bad this time, considering the harvest from this initial tomb.’

Without further delay, Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth and sucked the Gold Core into his body, absorbing its energy!

Streams of pure golden-colored energy rushed out from the Gold Core; all of it was absorbed by Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads.

In the past, it had taken Huang Xiaolong half a month to fully refine a Nefarious Devil Gold Core, but this time, Huang Xiaolong had absorbed all the energy within ten minutes or so.

Such shocking refining speed far exceeded the average Tenth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator.

After Huang Xiaolong refined the Gold Core’s energy, he employed the Grandmist Puppetry Technique to refine the Nefarious Devil Tribe master’s corpse.

Even without the little cow or the Black Baboon’s help, Huang Xiaolong merely spent a few minutes to successfully refine the corpse into a puppet.

This Nefarious Devil Tribe master had late-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm strength when he was alive. His name was Xie Dong.

Xie Dong was similar to Xie Tu whom Huang Xiaolong had refined in the past, who had come from the Evil Heart Settlement. Xie Dong was an ancestor of the Evil Heart Settlement as well.

After the ninetieth tomb, Huang Xiaolong’s group went to the next tomb— tomb number ninety-one.

One month flew by in a blink of an eye.

During this one month, Huang Xiaolong averaged ten tombs in a day, and the number of Nefarious Devil Tribe experts that he had successfully refined into puppets had reached twenty-three! The most powerful among them was of early Eighth Order Ancient God Realm strength!

On this day, Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and Black Baboon came to their three hundred-twentieth tomb’s entrance.

Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Supreme Godhead spun madly. It greedily devoured the death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy lingering at the tomb entrance into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

All of a sudden, a dazzling light burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body and his momentum peaked as he advanced to late-Second Order Ancient God Realm!

As Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation advanced to late-Second Order Ancient God Realm, it immediately increased his absorption speed. The little cow was not idle as it’s golden horns shot streaks of purple lightning into the tomb pathway, purifying and absorbing the cold yin energy within.

At last, after two hours, the death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy that were occupying the tomb were cleared.

Huang Xiaolong heaved in relief.

Close to the end, this tomb’s death qi, nefarious qi, and yin energy were unusually thick, slowing their progress.

Huang Xiaolong estimated another half a month’s time when entering the deeper tombs. He’d also need the Black Baboon’s help clearing the death qi, nefarious qi and yin energy.
