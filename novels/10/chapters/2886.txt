Chapter 2887: Watch Your Mouth!

Everyone watched on as the strand of destructive sword qi shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

They were shocked at the power contained behind the sword qi.

“The sword intent he has cultivated is really at a shocking level! It’s no wonder he’s the leader of the ten swords!”

“I’m afraid no one in his generation will be able to form a stronger sword intent than Yong Luosheng!” The mid-level Dao Venerable from the Xuanyuan Creed sighed.

“Elder Xuan, don’t you think that the brat has to leave his chariot now?” Yang Jia revealed a bright smile when he thought about how sorry Huang Xiaolong would be in a moment.

Xuanyuan Potian and those watching the battle broke out into laughter too.

The only ones who felt a trace of worry were the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World. Just before they could make a move to stop Yong Luosheng, Huang Xiaolong casually reached out with his right hand. Spreading his fingers, the unparalleled strand of sword qi froze before it could touch the chariot.

That was right, it froze in mid-air!

As the sword qi remained in its place, time seemed to come to a standstill.

With a wave of Huang Xiaolong’s hand, a terrifying wave of energy poured out from his body. The power he wielded seemed to control everything under the heavens, and it gave off the feeling it could reverse the yin and yang. The lives of everyone present were no longer controlled by them, and they felt that Huang Xiaolong could determine their fates as long as he willed it.

“What?!”

Everyone saw how the sword qi remained in the air without dissipating, and shock filled their hearts.

“What’s going on?!” Xu Xiaofeng cried out in disbelief.

Xuanyuan Potian’s smile froze on his face, and traces of light flashed through his eyes.

Even the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

Reaching out to stop a strand of sword qi without allowing its energy to dissipate was something even the three of them couldn’t do!

The old expert beside Feng Yue widened his eyes in shock, and he seemed to turn energetic all of a sudden. “World Harmony!”

“What?! World Harmony?!”

The Dao Venerables around felt their bodies trembling when they heard what he said. They felt as though someone had slammed a sledgehammer into their minds.

World Harmony was a legend that was passed down since the start of time. It was a Grand Dao Realm that surpassed everything they knew about the world!

It was said that the moment one comprehends the power of space to the limit, they would meld with the world. The world would become like an extension of the cultivator, and everything would fall under his control!

However, even most Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables were unable to become one with the world!

There was only a single person in the Divine Tuo Holy World who could truly become one with the world.

After all, the world they were speaking of wasn’t just the heavens and earth. If it was that simple, there were True Saints who could do the same thing! World Harmony was when one merged with the Divine Tuo Holy World!

Tan Meiqin, who was standing beside Yu Yue, muttered softly while she was still stuck in a state of disbelief. “This… This move again?”

“What do you mean?” Yu Yue snapped back to reality and questioned.

Tan Meiqin lowered her voice and replied, “He used this exact move when he had sent Zhou Hong flying…”

The scene was something Tan Meiqin would never forget as long as she lived.

By the time they were done, Huang Xiaolong had raised his hand and pushed outwards slightly.

The strand of sword qi that came from Yong Luosheng spun around in mid-air, and it shot towards him with incredible speed.

The speed at which it flew was at the very least four times faster than when Yong Luosheng had unleashed his attack!

If they thought that Yong Luosheng’s strike was terrifyingly fast, the scene that was playing out at that moment made them eat their words.

Rip!

Spatial cracks appeared along the flight path of the sword qi, and the void was like a piece of wet paper. It was torn apart with no resistance at all as chaos streams poured out from the void.

Yong Luosheng’s expression changed, and a look of terror emerged on his face.

He realized that as the wonder of the Dragon Sword, he had no way of controlling it!

“Dragon Sword World!”

Yong Luosheng screamed in a desperate attempt to defend himself.

As he desperately circulated grand dao energy to push his dao souls to the limit, the light that emerged from his body filled the entire sacred land with light.

A shocking amount of grand dao energy descended on the lands. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Dragon Sword in his hand pierced outwards, and a massive world filled with swords appeared.

The sword world was formed by massive strands of sword qi that held the shape of dragons. They rolled about and eventually fused to form a giant rune in the skies. The symbol of a dragon was painted in the skies with sword qi, and a giant Grand Dao Dragon was formed!

It was too bad that his flashy moves were useless as the strand of sword qi shattered his Dragon Sword World instantly. The energy contained in it dissipated in the wind before the sword qi landed on his chest.

Bang!

The heavens rippled, and the earth trembled.

Turning into a shooting star, Yong Luosheng’s figure disappeared from their sights.

With her jaws dropping, Tan Meiqin recalled the scene where Zhou Hong was blasted out of the city. Now, the leader of the ten swords, Yong Luosheng, was sent flying out of Monarch Yu Sacred Land!

Looking at Yong Luosheng, who was flying through the air, everyone felt like they were in a dream. Someone with two dao souls and nine high-grade Saint Fates was sent flying just like that?!

Xuanyuan Potian was equally stuck in a state of disbelief.

Even he couldn’t send someone like Yong Luosheng flying. With his ten high-grade Saint Fates and amazing talent, he couldn’t come close to doing it!

He might be stronger than Yong Luosheng, but he was barely stronger than him. He would, at the very most, be able to defeat Yong Luosheng after a short battle. He couldn’t even kill the man instantly, much less send him flying out of an entire region!

After Yong Luosheng flew several trillion miles, he finally started to fall from the skies.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to stand on ceremony at all. He grabbed at the void, and the Dragon Sword flew towards him. Even though artifacts at the level of the Dragon Sword had already recognized their owner and wouldn’t allow themselves to fall into the hands of others, the Dragon Sword seemed perfectly content in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

“This sword is pretty good… Too bad its previous owner is nothing more than a damn pig,” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly.

Even though his voice wasn’t loud, it slammed heavily into the minds of those who heard it. It was especially so for Xuanyuan Potian as he was laughing at Huang Xiaolong previously. Now that Huang Xiaolong was addressing Yong Luosheng as a pig, he was basically grouping Xuanyuan Potian together with the likes of Yong Luosheng.

One of the Second Esteem Dao Venerables from the Xuanyuan Creed stepped forward all of a sudden as a cold light flashed through his eyes, “Brat, you had better watch your mouth. Our prince isn’t someone you can mock. Do you really think you’re some big shot after defeating Yong Luosheng? To our Xuanyuan Creed, you’re nothing more than an ant!”

“There isn’t even a need for anyone stronger than me to make a move. I, alone, will be able to crush you with my pinky finger!”

His voice rang through the skies as he openly berated Huang Xiaolong.

“Look! It’s Yong Luosheng! Yong Luosheng is back!” someone screamed all of a sudden.

With his eyes completely bloodshot, killing intent leaked out of his body as he slowly flew towards Huang Xiaolong.
