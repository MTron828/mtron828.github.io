Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Fan Hui could faintly guess the thoughts running through Huang Xiaolong’s head. He explained, “Master, you are right, the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe is indeed a force under our Netherworld King’s Organization.”

Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

As expected!

“The ancestor of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe was a mount that our old master had tamed by chance. Thus, the ancestor of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion has a very strong bond to our old master. The outside world knows nothing about it. Only the four of us know such an earth shattering secret.” Jin Yuan then continued explaining, “Moreover, only the current patriarch knows that the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe is a force under the Netherworld King’s Organization, not even the disciples, elders, and grand elders know about this matter!”

Huang Xiaolong suddenly understood why he was unable to gain any information about the relationship between the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe and the Netherworld King’s Organization from the outside world.

“Master, should we go in now?” Tai Yue asked politely.

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The five soared into the air and entered the Green Flame Mountain Range.

The green flames surrounding the mountain range was a type of very powerful flame in Hell. Other than the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe, one had to be a Heavenly Monarch to even think of entering the mountain range.

Even though Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a Heavenly Monarch, he was unafraid of these flames.

Before long, they ran into a group of disciples from the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe patrolling the area.

The disciples of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe looked pretty similar to a human, but they had scorpion arms. There was also a faint green scorpion tattoo on their eyebrows.

“We want to meet your ancestor and patriarch.” Tai Yue got straight to the point and took out a token. He threw it to the leader of the group patrolling the area.

The moment the captain caught the token, the expression on his face changed. He replied with respect, “Senior, please!”

Under the leadership of the group of Devil Scorpion disciples, they flew to the depths of the Green Flame Mountain Range.

Since the Netherworld King’s Organization was located inside the forbidden area of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe, they would have to enter the forbidden area of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe first.

Not long after, they could see the palaces of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe scattered across the mountain peaks and at first glance, it looked extremely disorderly. Despite that, there was a profound meaning behind the location of their palaces.

In the past few years, Huang Xiaolong’s mastery in the art of formations had increased quite a bit, and he could tell from a glance that these palaces were part of a powerful formation. There was a high chance that they formed an ancient formation.

After bringing Huang Xiaolong and the others to a palace, the Green Flame Devil Scorpion disciples left to report to the elders.

With their identity, the disciples couldn’t lead them into the forbidden area without the consent of the ancestor and patriarch. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

While Huang Xiaolong and the four of them sat and waited in the palace, the atmosphere in the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe’s main hall became suffocating.

A tall and strong middle aged man was seated in the main seat of the main palace. Faint green flames flickered in his eyes and his arms were covered in green lines. He was the current patriarch of the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe, Shi Tong. He was a Seventh Order Emperor Realm expert and there were two people sitting before him.

One was a handsome young man who was wearing a faint golden robe. The young man seemed to possess an innate majesty as he sat there, but the part about him that caught the eye of everyone present was the design on his golden robe. A massive chaotic sword was embroidered on it and blood dripped down from the blade.

That was the insignia of the Massacring Gods Gate in the Hell Asura World!

Massacring Gods Gate! In the Hell Asura World, it was second only to the Netherworld King’s Organization!

There was an ancient proverb in Hell Asura World, “If the Netherworld King doesn’t come, the Massacring Gods Gate is invincible!”

It was obvious what everyone thought of the Massacring Gods Gate in the Hell Asura World.

There were even some people who were comparing the Massacring Gods Gate with the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe. From this point alone, one could tell how terrifying the Massacring Gods Gate was. After all, back when the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had ruled over the entire Spirits World, they even had dared to declare war on the monstrous Divine World!

Next to the young man sat a thin old man who emitted an aura as deep as the boundless seas itself. He was also wearing a Massacring Gods Gate’s robes.

“Patriarch Shi Tong, our Massacring Gods Gate wishes to ally with your tribe and create a glorious and prosperous world. This is an excellent opportunity for your Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe, and I hope that you can think carefully about this matter.”

Shi Tong shook his head without a second thought and replied, “Thank you for this opportunity Young Master Song Litao, but our Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe has no desire to fight for power.”

Alliance? Create a glorious and prosperous world? Aren’t they just trying to make our Devil Scorpion Tribe serve the Massacring Gods Gate?!

Song Litao frowned before continuing, “Patriarch Shi Tong, there are only benefits and no harm if we are to form an alliance. As long as our Massacring Gods Gate is able to unify the Hell Asura World, we will never forget the contributions of your tribe!”

Shi Tong’s face was calm as he explained, “Frankly speaking, even though your Massacring Gods Gate is pretty strong, it is still a bit weaker than the Netherworld King’s Organization. Even the Netherworld King’s Organization does not dare to claim that they can unify the entire Hell Asura World.”

The skinny old man sneered, “It’s merely a Netherworld King’s Organization, and the ranking doesn’t mean shit. If the Netherworld King’s Organization dares to obstruct us when we unify the Hell Asura World, we’ll wipe them out all the same!”

Shi Tong narrowed his eyes when he heard that.

The skinny old man was obviously one of the ancestors of the Massacring Gods Gate and he was a high-leveled Emperor Realm expert. Even so, he was stronger than Shi Tong. If he dared to claim that the Massacring Gods Gate would be able to destroy the Netherworld King’s Organization as they wished, the Massacring Gods Gate might be much stronger than what they revealed.

An elder entered the hall at that moment and there was a trace of anxiety on his face. He greeted Shi Tong, “Patriarch, there’s an important guest in the outer hall who wants to see you and our ancestors.”

Important guest?

Shi Tong was puzzled.

The elder hesitated and then took out Tai Yue’s token.

Shi Tong glanced at the token in his hand and a trace of shock flashed through his eyes. He stood up in a hurry and kept the token away carefully. Turning to Song Litao, he cupped his hands and said, “Young Master Song, I’m sorry for excusing myself, but something urgent has come up.”

Song Litao stood up, and said with indifference, “Since you’re busy now, we will come and visit you another day.” The two of them soared into the sky and left.

When the two of them were finally gone, Shi Tong retrieved the token to look for the ancestor.

Song Litao and the old man left the palace and flew towards the outer region of the Green Flame Mountain Range.

“How dare they refuse our alliance time and time again. Young master, we should just exterminate the entire Devil Scorpion Tribe!” The Massacring Gods Gate’s ancestor, Lu Tianyuan, said coldly.

In the past hundred years, with the help of some coercion and temptation, the top hundred superpowers had formed an alliance with the Massacring Gods Gate. The only exception to this was the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe who remained unmoved by all the generous benefits the Massacring Gods Gate had offered them.

Song Litao’s eyes flashed with a trace of coldness, “I will give the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe one last chance. If they dare to reject our alliance the next time, I will show them the consequences of rejecting this alliance! Hmph!” He fell into silence for a moment before giving the old man an order, “That token just now should have been the token of highest authority of their Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe. From what I know, there are only three of those tokens around. One naturally belongs to their ancestor, and the other is with Shi Tong. That should be the remaining one. I want you to investigate the identity of the person who brought the token over to Shi Tong.”

“Okay.”
