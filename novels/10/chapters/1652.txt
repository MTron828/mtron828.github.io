Before long, Huang Xiaolong scanned through the entire venue and didn’t notice his master’s appearance. It seemed as though Wei Hong’s men weren’t there with his master yet.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t too worried. Instead, he started pouring wine for himself as he started to feast.

As soon as the wine touched his lips, Huang Xiaolong felt that it wasn’t a mistake for him to indulge himself. The wine is pretty good!

“Lifeless Sect’s Ancestor, Xu Junhua, and his disciples have arrived!”

“The Windy Sea Ghost King, Wang Liugong, is here to deliver his blessings!”

Several elders in the Asura Gate announced the arrival of several important guests.

As long as anyone from the top hundred superpowers or exceptional experts appeared, the announcement elder’s voice would encompass the entire mountain, proclaiming their arrival.

“The Lifeless Sect’s ancestor, Xu Junhua, is an Eighth Order Emperor Realm Expert! I never expected you to come after lying low for so many years!”

“This must be unexpected news for you, but Ancestor Xu Junhua is the sworn brother of the Asura Gate’s Ancestor Jia Ding. How can he not be present during Ancestor Jia Ding’s disciple’s wedding?”

“It’s no wonder then. However, I never expected the Windy Sea Ghost King to arrive as well! In the past, Wang Liugong had killed two Seventh Order Emperors and massacred hundreds of thousands of disciples under them. He had disappeared for millions of years after... Could he also be related to Ancestor Jia Ding in some way?”

“Of course. Otherwise, why will he attend the wedding ceremony?”

Discussions broke out among all the experts present.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he watched everything play out.

Even though those people who were invited possessed some sort of relationship to the Asura Gate, Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about them in the slightest. As long as they weren’t at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, none of them would be able to obstruct him even in the slightest.

The only thing he was wary of was the Divine Tree of Darkness.

As he enjoyed himself with the drinks provided, he heard the announcement of several other experts. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In just half an hour, seven Emperor Realm experts appeared to attend the wedding ceremony.

“Greetings. I am the Yuanyang Valley’s Ancestor, Deng Feizhi. May I ask if I’ve seen you before? You look extremely familiar.” Just as Huang Xiaolong was observing everyone in the ceremony, an old man with a ruddy expression approached him. Huang Xiaolong turned around as he looked at the old man cupping his hands towards him.

Yuanyang Valley... They were ranked thirty seventh in the top hundred superpowers.

Deng Feizhi was an Emperor Realm expert himself. He had carved out a name for himself in the Hell Asura World and he wasn’t any weaker than the Lifeless Sect’s Xu Junhua or the Windy Sea Ghost King, Wang Liugong.

With the amount of authority and prestige he possessed, he wouldn’t approach someone like Huang Xiaolong. However, Jin Yuan and the other three Great Commanders were seated behind him in ten star Netherking’s robes. Since four Emperors were acting like his bodyguards, Deng Feizhi’s curiosity was stoked.

Seeing as Deng Feizhi took the chance to approach a random guest, everyone felt as though something was off and they turned their attention to Huang Xiaolong as well.

Deng Feizhi was extremely curious about Huang Xiaolong’s identity, and so were the others. Even the Dragon Lion Sect’s ancestor was dying to know the answer.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Deng Feizhi for a moment before turning away. He didn’t bother replying, but Tai Yue took over. “Our master never likes talking to people. He doesn’t like crowds as well. As for what faction we’re from... I’m afraid I won’t be able to tell you.”

Master?!

The expression on the faces of Deng Feizhi and the rest changed.

Huang Xiaolong was the master of the four ten star Netherkings behind him!

Everyone felt that Huang Xiaolong was merely the young master of a certain superpower in the Hell Asura World. They were sure that the four ten star Netherkings behind him were just ancestors from his sect attending the wedding ceremony with him. Never in their wildest imaginations would they have thought that Huang Xiaolong was the master himself!

“Hehe, if that’s the case, forgive me for being too rude.” Deng Feizhi snapped back to reality from his shock and smiled at Huang Xiaolong and the rest before returning to his seat.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had embarrassed him by not replying, he felt that Tai Yue and the other three Netherkings behind him weren’t people he could mess with. As such, he didn’t dare to hold a grudge against Huang Xiaolong.

As for everyone else, they saw how Deng Feizhi was subtly chased away by the ten star Netherking behind Huang Xiaolong and all of them dropped the thought of getting closer to him.

With no one else to bother him, Huang Xiaolong was able to enjoy a moment of peace and quiet. After sitting there for around an hour, a booming announcement broke his peace. “The Asura Gate’s Master and ancestors have arrived!”

Everyone was stunned in place, but they stood up soon after to welcome the arrival of the big shots of the Asura Gate.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before getting up.

Under the gazes of everyone present, a group of experts wearing the Asura Gate’s robes soared through the air as they arrived at the wedding venue. They seemed to be flying extremely slowly, but they appeared before everyone in the blink of an eye.

A middle aged man in his fifties led the group and there was an unfathomable look in his eyes. It was clear that he wasn’t an average passerby walking alongside the street.

“Is that the Asura Gate’s Patriarch, Huang Peng?”

Asura Gate’s Patriarch, Huang Peng! He was an expert at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm! In the Hell Asura World, he was considered one of the peak experts!

It was also a great coincidence that Huang Xiaolong shared the same surname as him.

Behind Huang Peng, there were forty three other individuals.

Today, Jia Ding was there to personally witness his disciple’s wedding ceremony, and nearly all the ancestors in the Asura Gate had come along to give their blessings. Other than several ancestors who were out or had pressing matters, all of them attended the ceremony.

That also meant that there were forty over Emperor Realm experts present!

These forty over Emperors represented the strength of the entire Asura Gate!

Of course, that wasn’t entirely true. There were a few other Emperor Realm experts guarding the forbidden areas of the Asura Gate.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze through all the ancestors of the Asura Gate and his eyes landed on one of them. The ancestor he fixed his sights on had a chubby face and huge ears. When he smiled, he looked like the incarnation of the laughing buddha himself. As soon as Huang Xiaolong saw him, he was sure that he was looking at Jia Ding! A late-Seventh Order Emperor Realm expert and one of the top five strongest fighters in the Asura Gate.

The status he had in the Asura Gate couldn’t be considered small.

When the Asura Gate patriarch, Huang Peng, and the ancestors arrived, a brilliant smile broke out on their faces. They greeted all the guests with a warm smile on their face and cheers broke out in the crowd.

Huang Peng and the others eventually made their way to the main platform before taking their seats. When they finally sat down, all the guests started to take their seats.

“Please welcome the groom, our Asura Gate’s disciple, Wei Hong, and the bride, our Asura Gate’s disciple, Wang Mengqin!” A loud announcement indicated the start of the wedding ceremony.

Under the gazes of everyone present, a man in red robes holding the hands of a lady with a red veil over her head made their appearance.

The young man had above average looks, and the lady was extremely pretty. However, something felt off and everyone could feel that she was hesitant about the marriage.

Wei Hong! Wang Mengqin!

The moment Wei Hong appeared, a chilly glint flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Since the wedding ceremony was about to begin, his master, Ren Wokuang, should also be making his appearance soon!

As if on cue, Huang Xiaolong noticed two Asura Gate disciples dragging his master into the wedding venue. Even though they chose a secluded spot where no one would be able to see them, Ren Wokuang was able to see everything that was going on.

It was clear to Huang Xiaolong that restrictions were placed everywhere on his master’s body and he wasn’t able to open his mouth no matter how hard he tried. From the crazed look in his master’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong could feel the rage and pain Ren Wokuang was feeling.

After Wei Hong pulled Wang Mengqin up onto the platform to perform the rites, Huang Xiaolong stood up. He ignored everyone and made his way towards Ren Wokuang.

The moment he stood up, he became the center of attention as everyone turned to stare at him.
