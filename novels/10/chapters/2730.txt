Chapter 2731: Skinning Huang Xiaolong Alive

When Chu Zhouyun heard it, he laughed fiercely, “Great, that’s great! He dares to take part in the Convent of the Wind and Clouds! Huang Xiaolong, watch how I skin you alive! Hahaha! You’ll die a miserable death!”

The Convent of the Wind and Clouds was going to start the very next day, and when Chu Zhouyun heard that Huang Xiaolong had entered without his guards, he jumped in joy.

Tang Jin smiled, “Looks like he isn’t some nobody. I wonder if he has someone backing him up.”

Yuan Yue smiled. “He’s just a mid-Ninth Heaven True Saint. How strong can his backing really be?” He turned to Chu Zhouyun and continued, “Brother Chu Zhouyun, Huang Xiaolong is yours to handle, but when the time comes, Wang Xueru will be ours to deal with.”

Slightly startled, Chu Zhouyun smiled and bowed respectfully, “Of course.”

“Come, let’s toss!”

The three of them laughed loudly.

“Brother Chu Zhouyun, is your injury serious?”

“It’s nothing much. Our Chufan Holy Pill is famous for a reason!”

The Chufan Holy Pill was one of the best holy pills when it came to treating injuries. It was the best in the region! It was also because of that that he was able to recover after getting struck by Zi Dongping and Fei Yanzi. Of course, the main reason was that they had shown mercy when they had made their moves.

…

After arriving at the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, Huang Xiaolong, Wang Xueru, and the others were arranged a residence. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care how great the place was, and he quickly returned to his room to cultivate. He circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium as soon as he settled down.

Grand dao energy emerged from the depths of the Divine Tuo Holy World, and it entered his body. It continued to nourish his dao souls and his dao heart.

At the same time, a golden light in Huang Xiaolong’s dantian devoured the energy surrounding his body.

The spirit he had obtained in the Sky Opening Island, Skylet, was also absorbing the grand dao energy that fell from the heavens.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised to discover that he could absorb grand dao energy faster in the Divine Tuo Holy World compared to the Cangqiong Holy World!

It made more sense that his cultivation speed would be slower since he had just arrived and had yet to grow accustomed to the grand dao laws in the Divine Tuo Holy World, but reality proved him wrong!

After an hour, the grand dao energy poured into his body at an even faster rate!

After his Huang Long Bloodline felt the grand dao energy in the Divine Tuo Holy World, it seemed to flow even faster. It was like a child who had returned to his parent’s embrace.

Huang Xiaolong felt extremely comfortable.

As the night passed, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes to realize that his Huang Long Bloodline was even stronger than before. It underwent a baptism after receiving the blessings of the grand dao law from the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Huang Xiaolong was elated. If he continued to devour the grand dao energy and grand dao laws, his Huang Long Bloodline would only grow stronger.

He discovered that the small world in his body had expanded slightly, even though the increase wasn’t obvious. He could feel the grand dao laws and energy rolling about in the small world.

As long as his grand dao laws and grand dao energy were successfully nurtured, he would be able to cultivate without the help of grand dao energy from the outside world!

When he was done checking out the condition of his body, Huang Xiaolong nodded in satisfaction.

The only thing that could give him a headache was the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

For the past few years, he couldn’t break through to the twelfth layer due to his inability to locate any grandmist spiritual aura.

“Seems like I should focus more on locating some grandmist spiritual aura.” Huang Xiaolong sighed inwardly.

A high-level holy world like the Divine Tuo World definitely had an abundance of grandmist spiritual aura. Whatever it was, there would definitely be more than what he found in the Cangqiong Holy World.

From what Huang Xiaolong learned from Duan Feng and Long Jianfei, there was even absolute beginning qi in the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Absolute beginning qi was something created during the creation of the world. It was much more precious than the grandmist spiritual aura, and even Dao Venerables would fight for it!

In the past, a Dragon Fish Dao Venerable had obtained a strand of absolute beginning qi, and he had used it to enter the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm.

“Senior Brother Huang,” All of a sudden, Wang Xueru called from outside.

Huang Xiaolong retracted his thoughts and knew that Wang Xueru was there to pick him up for the start of the Convent of the Wind and Clouds. He got to his feet and left his room.

As soon as he emerged, Wang Xueru stared at him in shock.

Wang Xueru came back to her senses and said, “Senior Brother Huang, you seem to have changed.” However, she couldn’t tell the difference.

Huang Xiaolong smiled in response. “It’s probably due to my cultivation through the night,” Huang Xiaoloong explained. Of course, he wouldn’t mention his Huang Long Bloodline.

When she realized that he wasn’t planning to elaborate any further, she didn’t push the matter. She brought everyone towards the tallest peak.

The Convent of the Wind and Clouds was held on the highest peak of the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, and it would be held in the large plaza before the holy palace.

When they arrived, they saw that the holy palace was already filled with disciples from their respective sacred lands.

“Is that the direct disciple of the Cangqiong Old Man, Huang Xiaolong? I really wonder where the old man found a disciple as stupid as him. He dares to offend the Chufan Sacred Land. I wonder how they will deal with him later.” Some of the disciples laughed.

“What do you think? Chu Zhouyun mentioned that he would skin Huang Xiaolong alive!”

Some were rejoicing in his misfortune, some took pity on him, and others shook their heads silently.

Several disciples of the Ice Blue Sacred Land brought the disciples of the Cangqiong Sacred Land to a corner of the main hall.

As they were making their way over, Wang Xueru frowned. According to the rules, all disciples who were participating in the Convent of the Wind and Clouds would be seated in the holy palace. They shouldn’t be sitting in a corner.

Evidently, the Ice Blue Sacred Land was doing it on purpose.

Wang Xueru couldn't help but stare at the center of the hall. She questioned Qiao Bai, the disciple of the Ice Blue Sacred Land in charge of hosting them, "Where are our seats?!”
