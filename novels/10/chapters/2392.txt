Chapter 2393: Crawl to the Gate!

The terrifying whirlwind was like a meat grinder that went through the crowd. Wherever it went, bodies dropped from the skies like flies.

Shockingly enough, the experts from the various sects realized that there was a devouring force stopping all of them from escaping from the whirlwind of death.

No matter how hard they struggled, they failed to escape as the devouring force increased in magnitude.

One hundred.... Two hundred.... One thousand, two thousand!

The skies started to turn red as more and more people were ground into dust.

That was the blood of the members of the Four Seas Holy Gate and the Teng Family!

As the blood in the skies reached a horrifying concentration, even the clouds were dyed crimson!

The whirlwind eventually arrived before the members of the Yang Family. Staring at the whirlwind of death before them, a look of despair appeared in their eyes.

Just as it was about to tear them to pieces, it stopped one meter away from the first member of the Yang Family.

Yang Nan felt the pores of his body open up as cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

Like a bubble, the whirlwind of blood popped before their eyes.

Staring at their surroundings in shock, Yang Nan didn’t believe that he had managed to survive.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Yang Xin and the others with a placid gaze, and he spoke to Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage behind him. “Let’s go.” Riding on his profound beast, he soared through the skies.

Only when Huang Xiaolong and the others had left did Yang Xin kowtow in their direction. Tears filled her eyes, but she forced herself to remain strong.

“Patriarch!...” One of the Eminent Elders couldn’t get up due to his trembling legs, and he cried out in shock. He stared at the blood-stained ground and felt his world spinning. That was the blood of a Holy Prince, the Four Seas Holy Gate’s experts, and Han Jiangcheng!

More than twenty thousand experts were killed in the blink of an eye! Thousands of Venerables fell!

Only a single group was left, and that was the Yang Family!

“Patriarch, what do we do now?” One of the Eminent Elders asked carefully.

Yang Nan’s eyes were wide as he stared at the scene before him in shock.

...

“What?! Teng Yunlong, the newest Holy Prince of our Holy Gate, was killed? Even the continent master, Han Jiangcheng, was slain? How is this possible?!”

“It’s true. Holy Prince Teng Yunlong returned to Direction Mountain City to visit his family, but he was killed within an hour of entering the city! The grand elders and elders who followed him were killed along with Han Jiangcheng and the various experts! Everyone, who welcomed his return, was killed down to the last man!”

“This... This is news indeed! Is the opponent from another Holy Grounds? Anyone who can kill them all without leaving a single survivor should be in the half-True Saint Realm!”

The news of Teng Yunlong’s death quickly spread through the Four Seas Holy Grounds.

In the headquarters of the Four Seas Holy Gate, there was a white haired old expert sitting in one of the mountain caves. His face was like a young child, and he had a ruddy appearance. However, his expression was the complete opposite. The frosty light in his eyes flashed with terrifying ferocity.

The old man was precisely Teng Yunlong’s master, Eminent Elder Bi Cheng!

All the experts who sat before him lowered their heads quietly, and none of them dared to make a sound.

“Have you discovered the identity of his killer? Where is he headed after leaving the city?”

“Reporting to master, we are unable to ascertain the identity of the murderer! However, we are sure that he possesses terrifying talent! He managed to kill Han Jiangcheng as an early-Ninth Order Venerable, and he did it with a single punch! Based on that alone, he should be an expert from a foreign Holy Grounds!” Bi Cheng’s eldest disciple, Feng Kun, hastily replied. “After killing junior brother, they headed north, and we lost their tracks in the Exterminating Magic Mountain Range!”

Icy light shot through Bi Cheng’s eyes. “Expert from another Holy Grounds? It’s no wonder he dares to move against our Four Seas Holy Gate! Whoever he is, he will have to die after killing a disciple of our Holy Gate! Pass down my order! Seal the holy ground! Not a single person is allowed to leave! We shall activate all our men to smoke him out!”

As a peak-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint, Bi Cheng’s authority in the Four Seas Holy Grounds was nearly unparalleled.

“Yes, master!”

As soon as the order was passed down, Bi Cheng left his mountain cave to meet with the other Eminent Elders.

Several days later, the space shook as Huang Xiaolong walked through the void with Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage.

As he looked at the headquarters of the Four Seas Holy Gate before him, Huang Xiaolong revealed a look of satisfaction.

I’m finally here!

A group of disciples discovered Huang Xiaolong’s group the moment he appeared, and they quickly approached.

After Huang Xiaolong had killed Teng Yunlong, his name had spread around the Four Seas Holy Ground. The security around the Holy Gate was beefed up, and the number of disciples guarding the place was ten times larger than before.

“What are you doing here?” The group asked the moment they approached. “Which sect or family do you come from?”

“I’m a lone wolf. The only thing I wish to do is to meet the Patriarch of your Four Seas Holy Gate.”

A look of surprise flashed across the face of the guards when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s request.

In the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong and the others were surrounded.

“Why are you looking for our Patriarch?” The captain of the guards stared at Huang Xiaolong and asked slowly, “What’s your cultivation level?”

“Early-Ninth Order Venerable Realm....” Huang Xiaolong replied with a placid expression. “Your Patriarch will learn of the reason soon and there’s no need for you to worry about that.”

When the guard captain heard Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation level, he was shocked for a moment. However, he soon regained his calm. “Do you really think that you qualify for an audience with the Patriarch? Do you even know how many peak-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints were turned away when they requested to meet the Patriarch?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You know what. If you crawl to the entrance of the Four Seas Holy Gate, I’ll relay your message to one of the Eminent Elders. You’ll be able to meet with one of them instead.”

The group of disciples roared with laughter when they heard what their captain said.

Too bad for the captain, one of the members approached him and reported. “Senior Brother Lin, this guy looks like the man our Holy Gate is trying to capture....”

Turning his gaze over to Huang Xiaolong once again, the captain couldn’t help but widen his eyes in shock. Unfortunately for him, the profound beast under Huang Xiaolong had already made its move. Raising its feet, it stomped down on the captain.

In a flash, the captain was sent flying into one of the distant mountain ranges. After piercing through several mountain peaks, he slammed heavily into the ground.

The faces of everyone changed.

“Enemy attack!”

Scattering like a flock of birds, signal flares lit up the skies.

Instead of stopping them, Huang Xiaolong stared at the group of disciples rushing to make a report. Before long, several streaks of light emerged from the main hall of the Four Seas Holy Gate.
