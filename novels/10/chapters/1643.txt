Colorful Balloons Take Flight

In recent years, wherever the Massacring Gods Gate passed by, the other forces’ Ancestors would bend over backwards to fawn and flatter them, but now, there was someone saying that the Massacring Gods Gate was nothing but a fart he released!

A fart!

This really is...?!

This enraged all the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors.

“Good, very good. Since all of you are seeking death, I’ll fulfill all of your wishes!” Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestor Gao Yu bellowed as his ferocious eyes were fixed on Desolate Giant Tai Yue, “Even if you’re a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert, so what? Do you think you alone can fend off my one billion Massacring Gods Gate’s army?!”

Whilst Gao Yu threatened Tai Yue, he secretly signaled the other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors to be prepared.

The other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors furtively nodded their heads in response.

“KILL—!!” The other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors hollered and rushed forward with their immediate subordinates. Their first wave of lethal attack simultaneously targeted Tai Yue.

In Gao Yu’s opinion, Zhang Xiaomeng and he together were sufficient to deal with Tai Yue. In the meantime, the other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors would seize the time to deal with the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s experts, then backup Zhang Xiaomeng and him in the shortest time. Under the joint efforts of several high-level Emperor Realm experts’ attacks, death was the only ending even for powerful peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert!

When Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng attacked, other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors pounced on the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Ancestor Shi Yihai and Patriarch Shi Tong at the same time.

The three Devil Scorpion Tribe’s Eminent Elders who had submitted to the Massacring Gods Gate rushed to the front in attack. They had just submitted to the Massacring Gods Gate, and this was the time for them to perform and gain merit.

While attacking, two of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors split up to capture Huang Xiaolong.

Once they captured Huang Xiaolong, the rest would be easy.

In a flicker, the two of them arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong. Suddenly, a terrifying power neither of them could explain burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Before this terrifying power, both of them felt death gripping their hearts, and this feeling continued to spread to their limbs as both turned deathly pale.

Just as they thought of retreating, it was already too late.

The terrifying power smashed onto them in a split second. Their bodies were thrown into the air like withered leaves and they exploded to their deaths in midair. Drops of blood splattered to the ground together with pieces of shattered godheads.

The Massacring Gods Gate’s army of one billion that had rushed up to attack, scattered and died like locusts due to the aftershocks resulting from the explosions from the two Ancestors’ deaths. All of their souls were destroyed in an instant.

This abrupt change in situation stupefied Gao Yu, Zhang Xiaomeng, and other Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors.

The Devil Scorpions Tribe’s experts who were ready to fight to their deaths were dumbstruck on the spot.

This, this...!

Two Seventh Order Emperor Realm experts exploded to their deaths, complete destruction! Exploded to pieces!

This was more shocking than Tai Yue punching a hole through Kang He’s chest.

While both sides were still in a daze, one hundred stalwart figures appeared by Huang Xiaolong’s side out of nowhere!

In the instant these one hundred figures appeared, their momentums shook the heavens, and space became distorted, threatening to collapse!

The Massacring Gods Gate and Devil Scorpion Tribe were panic-stricken, including Shi Yihai and Shi Tong.

“Hig-h, high-level Em-Emperors?!” One of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors stuttered from a quivering tongue.

One hundred of them!

All high-level Emperor Realm experts!

But Gao Yu who had a better judgement stuttered, “Un-Undeads?!”

“The Undeads?!” Similar exclamations could be heard from the Massacring Gods Gate and Devil Scorpion Tribe’s sides as they stared at the one hundred puppet Netherguards around Huang Xiaolong.

Each of these one hundred puppet Netherguards’ original bodies were from the Undead Race.

In the ancient times, the Undeads was the most horrifying and most powerful race in Hell.

The Undeads, as its name implied, were almost immortal. Their physical body could hardly be injured, much less they could be killed. Not to mention the Undeads had amazing recovery speed that as long as they were not truly killed, no matter how severe their injuries were, they would be able to heal in the shortest time.

Just the mention of Undeads would send a chill down everyone’s spine.

But no one knew why the Undeads had suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Some said that the Undeads were annihilated by a supreme master. Others said that the Undeads had entered a mysterious hidden realm. There were also those who claimed the Undeads were cursed, never to appear again in front of others.

But now, the Undeads that had been missing for almost ten billion years had appeared!

One hundred of them! Most of them were high-level Emperor Realm experts!

It was even more unbelievable that these one hundred high-level Emperor Realm Undeads were a Heavenly Monarch Realm Asura noble’s subordinates!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the Massacring Gods Gate’s shocked faces and ordered without any emotion, “Kill!”

Immediately, the Demon King Fan Hui, Asura King Jin Yuan, and Golden Lionman Wan Yutian no longer concealed their cultivation, fully releasing their momentums as Desolate Giant Tai Yue had done earlier.

The overwhelming pressure from their bodies shook heaven and earth.

At the same time, Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Tai Yue, and Wan Yutian’s outer appearance began to change, returning to their massive figures.

The four were akin to four great mountains standing where they were. Under the overwhelming pressures from their bodies, even the peak mid-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Gao Yu had the illusion that he was nothing but an ant in front of them.

Looking at Jin Yuan, and the other three people’s changed appearances, Gao Yu’s expression changed greatly. At this point, he finally recognized Jin Yuan, Fan Hui, Tai Yue, and Wan Yutian’s identities.

“You, you are four of the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s Great Commanders!” Gao Yu screamed with disbelief.

Four of the Netherworld King’s Organisations’ Great Commanders were actually following by a Heavenly Monarch Realm Asura noble’s side!

What’s with that?!

Could it be this Heavenly Monarch Realm Asura noble was the Netherworld King’s Organisation’s master?!

No, wait—! Gao Yu suddenly recalled the words Huang Xiaolong had said a while ago. He had asked why would Shi Yihai and Shi Tong chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong, and Huang Xiaolong had answered...?!

When Gao Yu remembered Huang Xiaolong’s answer, he shuddered from head to toe.

But he didn’t have time to think too deeply about it now, because Tai Yue’s mountain-sized palm was slamming down on him.

In a panic, he leaped back with all the strength he had.

At the same time, rays of sword lights whizzed across the air, and in the next second blood splattered. Several of the Massacring Gods Gate’s Ancestors were too slow to dodge, and ended up slashed by sword lights and devoured by a blood red light.

Asura King Jin Yuan, Demon King Fan Hui, and Golden Lionman Wan Yutian had started their attacks!

“Kill!” The Devil Scorpion Ancestor Shi Yihai came to his senses and bellowed his order as he leapt forward in attack. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Devil Scorpion Tribe’s experts reacted and followed after Shi Yihai.

In a split second, killing broke out between the two sides.

In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen corpses fell from high air. The ground below dyed red, gradually, forming small streams of blood.

Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng managed to dodge Tai Yue and the others’ attacks, but they were so scared that they lost the will to fight. They turned into two streaks of black light, wanting to make a run for it, but meters from the Devil Scorpion Tribe’s grand formation array, Gao Yu and Zhang Xiaomeng were repelled by two overwhelming forces.

These two overwhelming forces came from two late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm puppet Netherguards.
