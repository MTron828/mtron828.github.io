“Master!” Huang Xiaolong fell to one knee and greeted Ren Wokuang respectfully.

Everyone present felt their jaws dropping in horror.

This...

Master?!

The young man before them had four extremely strong Emperors as his subordinates, and he was an Asura noble at the Heavenly Monarch Realm. Why in the world was he greeting Ren Wokuang, a God King Realm disciple of the Asura Gate as his master?!

Everyone felt that the scene playing out before them was absolutely ridiculous.

It seemed as though the entire world was flipping upside down right before their very eyes.

As for Wei Hong, he stared at the scene before them with his mouth agape and the blood drained from his face. Jia Ding’s expression wasn’t the best either and even the grand elder, Deng Zhilong, felt his face going pale. A look of panic flashed through his eyes and a tinge of regret appeared in them.

If he wouldn’t have broken off all relations with Ren Wokuang in the past, wouldn’t the Asura noble be considered a grand disciple of his? His grand disciple would be someone who had four extremely strong Emperors under his command!

In contrast to Wei Hong’s look of terror, Wang Mengqin’s excitement couldn’t be hidden.

When Jin Yuan and the others heard Huang Xiaolong addressing Ren Wokuang as his master, all of them were stunned for a second. Even though the four of them had tried guessing Huang Xiaolong’s relationship with Ren Wokuang, they had never expected for Ren Wokuang to be his master.

Ren Wokuang’s body trembled when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s acknowledgement. He kneeled on the ground and stuttered, “Sen... Senior... Please stand up!”

He was a mere God King. How could he accept Huang Xiaolong’s grace, not to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong was a Heavenly Monarch.

Even though he was certain that Huang Xiaolong was the person who had inherited his Blades of Asura and Asura Ring in the lower world, he didn’t dare to accept Huang Xiaolong as his disciple. After all, Huang Xiaolong had inherited his items after he ascended to the Hell Asura World and he hadn’t personally accepted Huang Xiaolong as his disciple. Now that Huang Xiaolong had displayed his status and power, how could Ren Wokuang dare to accept Huang Xiaolong’s show of respect?

When Huang Xiaolong realized that his master, Ren Wokuang, had fallen to his knees in shock, he couldn’t help but laugh and help his master to his feet.

He knew that it would be extremely difficult for Ren Wokuang to acknowledge him. After all, the gap in their statuses wasn’t small to begin with.

All of a sudden, Huang Peng suppressed the shock in his heart and he cupped his hands towards Huang Xiaolong, “I never expected that this brother here will share such a strong bond with our disciple. We were rude to you earlier...”

When everyone heard Huang Peng addressing Huang Xiaolong as ‘brother’ while displaying such a humble attitude, all of them swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock. However, after thinking about Tai Yue’s display of strength a moment ago, all of them understood the reason behind Huang Peng’s change in attitude.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Huang Peng and said with indifference, “Patriarch Huang, my master was the target of one of your disciples, Wei Hong, and was locked up in the Black Prison of the Asura Gate for tens of years. He was tortured and humiliated while in prison and I am here today to demand an explanation from all of you.”

As soon as the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips, everyone broke out into fervent discussion.

All the experts attending the wedding ceremony started to whisper into each other’s ears.

Ren Wokuang revealed an expression of rage as he turned to glare at Wei Hong. He spat fire through his eyes and he couldn’t help but want to tear Wei Hong’s body into shreds.

Wei Hong slammed his knees into the ground and crawled towards Huang Peng. He tried to explain himself, “Patriarch, in the past, Ren Wokuang killed fellow disciples of the sect and everyone can vouch for me! Please judge me fairly!”

Ancestor Jia Ding clenched his teeth and turned to Huang Peng, “Patriarch, they relied on their strength to wreak havoc in our Asura Gate and now, they are looking for trouble by besmirching my disciple’s name!”

A frown formed on Huang Peng’s face and he asked Huang Xiaolong, “Did fellow cultivator hear some rumors from some unknown sources? Is this a misunderstanding?”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Wei Hong who was pulling the pity card as he kneeled on the ground before Huang Peng before turning to look at Jia Ding who was trying his best to act as if he was wronged. He laughed coldly in his heart. “Well, we’ll know if there is a misunderstanding as long as we ask your disciples, won’t we?” He paused for a second before continuing, “I have a special divine art that can force them to reveal the truth. Since Jia Ding is certain that I am making up stories, why don’t I ask several other disciples from the Asura Gate?”

All the ancestors of the Asura Gate turned to look at each other.

“Patriarch, you cannot allot him to do as he pleases! He definitely has some sort of plot cooked up somewhere in his head when he arrived at our headquarters! He is nothing but a troublemaker here to disrupt the wedding ceremony!” Jia Ding hastily yelled. “He might even have bribed some of the disciples here in the crowd!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered. He wasn’t in a hurry at all and he simply stared at Wang Mengqin and asked, “Did Wei Hong tell you that he will release my master after the wedding ceremony is over?”

Wang Mengqin nodded her head like a chicken pecking on rice.

“Do you really think that Wei Hong will release my master, Ren Wokuang, after you marry him? He has already decided to sentence my master to death the very next day.”

Wang Mengqin’s body shook and she stared at Wei Hong with a bewildered expression.

Wei Hong hurriedly tried to explain himself now that things were going south. “Mengqin, don’t listen to his lies! I never thought of doing anything like that!”

“Are you sure?” Huang Xiaolong’s cold laughter seemed to dump a bucket of cold water on him. “You got some disciples to drag my master here today to witness his beloved woman getting married to you. Don’t you wish for him to suffer the pain of extreme humiliation?”

“No! That’s not what happened! Mengqin, you can’t believe him! He’s lying!” Wei Hong screamed.

Wang Mengqin couldn’t help but take a few steps back in retreat and she quickly placed some distance between Wei Hong and herself. A disappointed expression formed on her face, but it was quickly replaced with unbridled rage.

The guests present went into an uproar.

“That’s unbelievable! It seems like Wei Hong framed Ren Wokuang in order to obtain his woman!”

“Look at how Wei Hong is behaving. I’m certain everything that young man said is true.”

All the experts present were people who had experienced countless matters and they managed to see through whatever was going on at a single glance.

Huang Peng looked at Wei Hong and the frown on his face became deeper. The reason he had allowed Ren Wokuang to be dragged to the wedding venue was because Ancestor Jia Ding had persuaded him. He had felt that the things were a little strange but he had eventually agreed to Jia Ding’s request in order to please Jia Ding. He hadn’t dug into the matter because of Jia Ding’s status in the Asura Gate. However, from the looks of it, the Asura noble was telling the truth.

Huang Peng looked at Huang Xiaolong and said in a solemn voice, “I will get my men to do an investigation. If this is true, I will personally explain matters to your master.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Explanation?” Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I have no idea how you’re planning to explain matters to him. If you actually find evidence that what I said was true, what are you going to do? Are you going to get Wei Hong to sweep the floor as service to the Asura Gate to atone for his mistake? Or are you going to throw Wei Hong into the prison for a bit? Is that what you mean by giving my master an explanation?”

Huang Xiaolong’s tone of mockery was more than obvious. Everything Huang Peng said was nothing more than a formality. There was no way he would do anything serious to Wei Hong.

In fact, that was exactly Huang Peng’s thoughts. After all, Wei Hong was Jia Ding’s treasured disciple and Wei Hong possessed unusually high talent in cultivation. If they placed more attention onto him, he would definitely break through to the Emperor Realm in the future.

Huang Peng stared at Tai Yue and the other Grand Commanders beside Huang Xiaolong and he narrowed his eyes. “What do you want then?”

“Expel Wei Hong from the Asura Gate right now. As for Jia Ding, he harbored and assisted Wei Hong in the harming and humiliation of my master. Expel him as well.”

Of course, expelling the both of them was merely the first step in his plan!
