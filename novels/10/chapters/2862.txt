Chapter 2863: Only Requires One Glance

Whether it was because of the hatred between the Yu Family and Long Family, or because Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei had humiliated Junior Brother Wang Xin, Yu Zhou wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei to vent out the anger in his heart.

Long Jianfei was once an inner disciple of Dragon Fish Creed, a senior deacon of the Mission Hall, on top of that. If they were still in the past, Yu Zhou wouldn’t have the guts to kill Long Jianfei.

However, his master, Zhu Hui, had given the order to find Long Jianfei and use every method to torture him, and if Long Jianfei were to end up dead in the process, his master would take care of it. With this guarantee from his master, Yu Zhou had no scruples to kill Long Jianfei.

“Senior Brother Yu Zhou, that so-called Highness, his combat power is startling,” Wang Xin stated as he recalled the scene where Huang Xiaolong had defeated the twenty-plus of them with a few punches. That had cast a shadow over Wang Xin’s heart to a certain degree.

Although Wang Xin had wanted to devour Huang Xiaolong’s flesh and drink his blood in this period, he had to admit to the fact that Huang Xiaolong’s combat power overwhelmed him.

A peak late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor had easily defeated several early Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestors, as well as a group of Sixth and Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestors. This level of combat prowess was rare even within the Dragon Fish Creed.

Despite Wang Xin’s apprehensive expression, Yu Zhou was unperturbed. “A peak late-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor defeating a few Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestors isn’t really a big deal. I could do it too.”

Wang Xin was quick to flatter, “Senior Brother Yu Zhou is an outstanding genius. Who in the entire Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave doesn’t know this and acknowledges this. How can that so-called Highness compare to Senior Brother Yu Zhou?”

“That’s right. Even if Senior Brother Yu Zhou’s cultivation was at Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, killing that so-called Highness wouldn’t have been different than killing a stray mongrel for Senor Brother Yu Zhou. Not to mention that Senior Brother Yu Zhou is a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert!” another Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple smiled flatteringly.

“Is there even a need to compare? With Senior Brother Yu Zhou’s strength, even just one look from Senior Brother Yu Zhou would make that Highness, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng piss themselves. Senior Brother Yu Zhou doesn't even need to move his pinky,” another Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple scoffed.

Then again, what these disciples had said wasn’t pure flattery, or deliberate exaggeration. Yu Zhou’s talent was a little unique, and he was born with dual-pupils. Generally, when facing enemies or killing people, the power of his dual-pupils was more than enough to do the job.

With a single glance, he could reduce the enemy into nothingness.

Hence, these Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples claimed that Yu Zhou merely needed one glance to kill Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng.

On the other side, upon arriving at the sacred land on the Qilin Chariot, Huang Xiaolong’s group did not delay, and they went straight to the Blue Lotus Pond.

A few days later…

Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the Void Returning Sacred Land’s White Feather City.

“Your Highness, further ahead is the Blue Lotus Pond. Why don’t we rest at the White Feather City to recuperate?” Long Jianfei suggested as he looked at the sky. It was the middle of the night.

“It is said that it’s better to enter the Blue Lotus Pond during the day because at night, the entire Blue Lotus Pond would be covered by a terrifying black fog that deters even Dao Venerable experts,” Duan Feng went on, “This black fog causes hallucination even in Dao Venerable experts, and damages the dao soul to a certain extent.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in agreement. “Might as well rest for the night in the city. We’ll head to the Blue Lotus Pond tomorrow!”

Having decided to spend the night at White Feather City, the Qilin Chariot pulled to a stop at one of the big inns, and Huang Xiaolong’s group rented a large courtyard for themselves.

The White Feather City was livelier than usual. It was possibly because of the news of Yu Yue’s impending arrival at the Blue Lotus Pond that various sacred lands’ and creeds’ disciples had all rushed over to catch a glimpse of her.

The three of them entered the inn’s restaurant and ordered some dishes. After having their meal, they took a look around the city.

“I’ve been to this city before.” They were walking along a street when Long Jianfei suddenly said in a melancholic tone, “I was here with my master.”

He had been to the White Feather City in the past with Chen Xi, more than once.

“Oh, your master has been here for the blue lotus?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Long Jianfei’s smile swept away the sadness from his face, “Yeah, many times, but each time, he returned without success. Moreover, it is not easy to purchase blue lotus from the market, yet my master wanted to refine pills with a blue lotus. Therefore, he could only come over and try his luck.” He shook his head as he added, “But it’s too difficult to find.”

Duan Feng nodded in agreement to that, “The Blue Lotus Pond has existed for countless hundred millions of years, yet the number of people who have successfully picked blue lotuses until now does not exceed one hundred? On top of that, there are only seven or eight people who have been able to find blue lotus twice, and we’ve never heard anyone succeed for the third time.”

Some lucky people obtained a blue lotus the first time they entered the Blue Lotus Pond, but they weren’t so lucky the second, third, and fourth time.

Being able to obtain a blue lotus twice was rare.

In so many years, there were no more than seven or eight people who had succeeded twice. One could see the success rate of finding blue lotus just from this number of people.

Long Jianfei nodded. “Yes, moreover, no one has been able to obtain more than three blue lotuses each time, and there were only two people who got two blue lotuses one time.”

“Oh, who are they?” Huang Xiaolong’s interest rose.

“One is the Mystical Pavilion Master, and the other is the Red Fox Dao Venerable!” Long Jianfei answered.

Mystical Pavilion Master!

He was the person everyone acknowledged to be the strongest person!

He was also the most powerful and mysterious expert!

The Mystical Pavilion Master had once obtained two blue lotuses, and Huang Xiaolong wasn’t very surprised about it, but what surprised him was that the Red Fox Dao Venerable also has such luck.

“Red Fox Dao Venerable?” Huang Xiaolong repeated, feeling strange.

“According to my master, the Red Fox Dao Venerable is the first-ever red fox who successfully cultivated and got recognized by the dao, and he is the only red fox in the universe,” said Long Jianfei. “The Red Fox Dao Venerable obtained a powerful treasure in a dao adventure, and he managed to get two blue lotuses by relying on this very treasure. As for what treasure it was, my master doesn't know about it.”

“Red Fox Dao Venerable’s treasure has never been revealed to the public eye.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

The three continued conversing as they walked, when they noticed the commotion up ahead. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Duan Feng was quick enough to grab a passerby, who was a certain sacred land’s expert, and inquired about what was happening up ahead.

The expert looked at Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng, and perhaps after seeing their extraordinary bearings, he answered, “There’s a madman in front, killing people indiscriminately. He has already killed many sacred lands’ experts.”

The three of them felt intrigued upon hearing this, and they approached the crowd to take a look.

They saw a disheveled middle-aged man with manic bloodshot eyes—and this was the madman, who was injuring and killing people, issuing warning bestial growls from his throat.

“Duan Zheng!”

Duan Feng suddenly shouted in joy when he saw the crazy middle-aged man.

Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei were stunned for a second. Duan Feng know this madman? Duan Zheng? Someone from the Duan Family?

Although Duan Feng was a Divination Creed’s inner disciple, like Long Jianfei, before he was a member of the Divination Creed, he was part of a family. Duan Feng came from the Divination Heavenly Cave’s Duan Family.

The Duan Family was a big family in the Divination Heavenly Cave. On top of that, the Duan Family was bigger and more powerful than the Long Family.

Duan Feng was still caught in pleasant surprise when Duan Zheng abruptly turned to Duan Feng and began attacking madly.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as it was clear to him that this person named Duan Zheng was poisoned with a certain kind of poison that was very powerful, causing his mind to fall into a confused state.

At this moment, Duan Zheng did not recognize Duan Feng at all.
