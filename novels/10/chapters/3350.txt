Chapter 3351: Great Valley

“The cities have already been taken over?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. That was the city closest to the Arabian Sea. It was extremely far away from the valley, but it seemed as though it had already fallen.

“That’s right. All the humans in there have already escaped! Those that haven’t are probably dead. If you head there alone, you’ll be sending yourself to death!” the young lady from the African Continent explained.

“It’s alright. I only wish to take a look,” Huang Xiaolong muttered before turning his attention over.

However, he was stopped by the lady. “You… Are you stupid?! You’ll die if you go there! Let me tell you right now, there are monsters there in the Nascent Soul Realm and Enlightenment Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he noticed her reaction. “Alright, I’ll go in there and kill them all as a service to all of us.”

The young lady stared at him in stunned silence for a moment. However, one of the youngsters behind her sneered, “Kill them? Do you really think that you’re an old ancestor of one of the six great factions?! You’re just a twenty-something-year-old. At most, you’re in the Foundation Building Realm. You’ll be dead before you even approach the city!”

The young lady continued, “Ah Yi has always been like that… Please don’t take any offense. He didn’t mean to be rude. I’m pretty familiar with the place, and you should follow us as we make our escape!”

After she spoke, she tried to direct him away from the city.

Huang Xiaolong wanted to say something, but he was eventually dragged away.

“This place should be pretty far from the valley, right? Are all the cities along the coast overrun?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The young lady shook her head and sighed, “Not all of them. Only those in the surroundings.” A look of worry formed on her face and she continued, “However, the number of creatures is increasing by the second. I’m afraid the entire continent would be taken over by them soon. Now, they have already conquered more than a third of the continent! Another third of the continent is a wasteland!”

Now, humans only populated a third of the African Continent!

It seemed as though the situation was direr than they thought.

“Where are we headed?”

“We’re going to Mandela City. The troops of the alliance are protecting the area,” She replied.

“Mandela?! I was planning on going to the Great Valley!” Huang Xiaolong explained.

“What?!” All of them gasped in shock.

Now, everyone is running away from the Great Valley. This random youngster they met said that he planned to head over there.

“Are you planning to look for black diamonds ?!” the young lady asked.

“Black diamonds?”

“Don’t you know? Before the monsters appeared, black diamonds spewed from the cracks! Black diamonds contain an extreme amount of power and one could even use them to cultivate! It’s much better than thousand-year-old herbs! A black diamond the size of my fingertip will cost nearly a hundred thousand low-grade spiritual stones!”

“There was someone who found a black diamond the size of a fist, and it sold for hundreds of millions!”

“Now, everyone strong enough to head there plans to look for black diamonds!”

“Yesterday, my big brother left to look for treasures in the area!” The young lady’s voice grew softer when she spoke about her brother.

Huang Xiaolong quickly connected the dots. The lady before him was from the Pier Family in the Ye Country of the African Continent. She was called Alexis, and her ancestors were from the royal family of the Ye Country. However, her bloodline was already extremely thin compared to the first-generation royals.

The Pier Family could be considered a second-rate family after breaking away from the royal family, and the strongest expert was her older brother, a Golden Core Realm expert. He was the patriarch of the Pier Family.

The greatest wish of her brother was for the family to regain its former glory.

When he heard that there were black diamonds suitable for increasing cultivation appearing in the great valley, he felt that it was their chance to finally turn the tables and rise to glory. He didn’t care about the warnings and brought all the experts in the family towards the great valley.

It was too bad there was no news of them even to this day. The reason Alexis appeared in the region was because she wanted to look for him.

She relied on him heavily, and if anything were to happen to him, her world would come crumbling down.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As such, she had to look for him no matter how dangerous it got.

“However, I’m not too familiar with the region. In order to venture deeper, we need to look for a guide in the city,” Alexis explained.

“What do you think? If you’re heading to the valley too, we can go together,” she asked Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response. “Sure, since you saved my life earlier…” He was clearly referring to the part where she ‘saved’ his life by telling him not to go to the city alone.

Since the city had already been invaded by tons of monsters, it was nothing but a death zone.

“Young Lady, we can’t even take care of ourselves…” one of the old experts beside her interrupted.

He was a Sixth Level Golden Core Realm expert, and he was the strongest among the six-man party.

He was clearly saying that Huang Xiaolong would be nothing more than a burden during their trip to the great valley.

“It’s alright, we can use all the help we can get.” Alexis shook her head and continued, “With more people, we can look out for each other!”

“But…” The old man tried once again, but he was quickly cut off.

“There’s no need to say anymore, Uncle Keta, it’s alright.”

Seeing as there was no way to talk her out of it, the old expert could only glare at Huang Xiaolong. There was a trace of wariness in his heart as he had experienced too much of life. He had seen many bad things throughout the course of his adventures. It was indeed suspicious for someone to join them halfway through the journey.

An hour later, they finally arrived in the city.

The number of troops guarding the area was uncountable, and there was an air of tension that came rushing towards them the moment they approached.

After going through a round of stringent checks, they finally entered the city.

Looking around, the group finally found someone who was familiar with the area around the valley. However, the price shocked Alexis. “What?! A hundred thousand low-grade spiritual stones?!”

“Why don’t you go rob a bank instead?!” Ah Hao roared.

“Heh, if you can’t afford it, go look for someone else.” The guide sneered. “Let me tell you right now, there aren’t many people familiar with the area. All of the others should have already found a job.”

Huang Xiaolong tossed over a spatial ring, and he muttered, “Here’s your payment.”

Alexis and the others gasped in fright. They didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so rich.

After checking the amount, the guide revealed a toothy grin. “Alright, when do you wish to set off?”

Alexis looked at Huang Xiaolong, and she lowered her head slightly. “Young Master Huang, I’ll return you the money in the future…”

Huang Xiaolong shook his hand and laughed, “It’s nothing much to me. After all, I need to head over there anyway. You can consider this repayment for your advice earlier.”

A grateful expression filled Alexis’s face. “Should we leave right now?”

“Alright.”
