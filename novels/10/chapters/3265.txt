Chapter 3266: Kill Me If You Got the Guts!

“That's not possible, right?” Huang Houde’s eldest uncle, Huang Chengyi, refuted with steadfast disbelief, “Both Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan were on the verge of death, limited to the bed, and even moving a finger took strenuous effort. How can they appear to be in their forties? Could the people below be mistaken? Also, both Huang Ruxing and Huang Baoqui had reported in the past that Huang Chenfei can only be bedridden for the rest of his life due to his injuries.”

Other grand elders also exhibited their doubt.

Those two were people that couldn’t live long anymore, yet the people below claimed that they looked like they were in their forties, with excellent mobility. How would they believe this ludicrous statement?

Huang Maosheng stated, “I’ve ordered the disciples to check again clearly before reporting again to me.” In truth, Huang Maosheng didn’t believe the report as well.

While the six grand elders were talking about Huang Jiyuan’s and Wang Meilan’s recovered youth, suddenly, an overbearing power enveloped the six of them. This power descended so abruptly that none of them reacted, and their bodies stiffened as their surroundings changed. In the next second, the six of them plummeted from high air.

The six people climbed up from the floor, and looked around. It was immediately clear that they were no longer at the Huang Family’s main residence, but inside an unfamiliar villa. Facing them was a young man standing with his hands behind his back.

A few feet behind him was a couple that looked to be in their forties, a middle-aged man in his thirties, and also a youngster with a big head.

The couple in their forties looked a little familiar.

“You are Huang Xiaolong?!” Suddenly, Huang Chengyi blurted out in astonishment looking at the young man in front of him.

The other five grand elders’ eyes widened in shock, staring at Huang Xiaolong’s face that hadn’t changed a bit in the last one hundred years.

Huang Jiyuan was agape looking at the six people who had plummeted into their residence out of nowhere, and exclaimed, “You’re Grand Elder Huang Chengyi!” Then his gaze shifted to Huang Bingquan, and he sounded uncertain as he said, “You, you are Grand Elder Huang Bingquan?!”

He hadn’t seen Huang Bingquan for a long time, hence, he wasn’t sure.

Huang Bingquan recognized that it was Huang Jiyuan’s voice immediately and a shiver ran down his body as his eyes widened in shock. “You, you are Huang Jiyuan?!”

Huang Jiyuan!

Huang Chengyi, Huang Maosheng, and the others were just as astounded while looking at the forty-something-looking Huang Jiyuan. Then, they saw the ‘forty-something’ woman standing next to Huang Jiyuan. Could this be…?!

Wang Meilan!

Then what the disciples reported previously is true?! Their gazes simultaneously shifted to Huang Chenfei. Can this be the bedridden Huang Chenfei?!

“Where is this place?!” Huang Bingquan remembered something and reacted. According to what they knew, weren't Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan at Huazhou City? But the six of them were obviously at the Huang Family’s main residence in Datong City.

How did we appear here suddenly?

“All of you have guessed right, we’re in Huazhou City.” Huang Xiaolong’s tepid gaze swept over the six of them and confirmed their thoughts.

“Huazhou City!”

The six grand elders literally shouted in unison.

“Impossible, how can we appear in Huazhou City?!” There was fleeting panic in Huang Chengyi’s eyes.

“Xiaolong, what is this? What’s going on?!” Huang Jiyuan had a flabbergasted expression on his face as he asked Huang Xiaolong.

“You don’t believe that I can kill Transcendent experts, so I directly brought these people here from the Huang Family’s main residence,” Huang Xiaolong explained to Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan.

“You, kill a Transcendent expert? Brought us here from the Huang Family’s main residence?” Huang Maosheng let out fanatic laughter. “Huang Xiaolong, why don’t you make up an even more outrageous story? Do you think this little trick of yours can deceive us?” He looked around, and snorted, “This is an illusion art, right?”

Illusion? Huang Chengyi, Huang Bingquan, and the others seemed to have caught onto something after hearing that.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong tapped the air with a finger and Huang Maosheng had the wind knocked out of him as his body shot backwards. His scream jolted Huang Chengyi and the others to their senses and they saw a ghastly wound on the Fourth Level Nascent Soul Realm Huang Maosheng’s chest.

Huang Xiaolong tapped the air again just as Huang Maosheng got up from the ground, and the force pierced through Huang Maosheng's left shoulder.

In the past, this Huang Maosheng had always used his seniority in the family to make things difficult for Huang Xiaolong, giving him the cold shoulder.

At the same time Huang Xiaolong injured Huang Maosheng’s left shoulder, a startling energy shot straight towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest. This attack came from the Huang Family’s third strongest expert, the peak late-Eighth Level Nascent Soul Realm Huang Chengyi.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother to look at the attacker, as a streak of light burst out from his body, and Huang Chengyi who had closed in on Huang Xiaolong was hit by this light, knocking him out of the villa, and crashing to the garden outside.

The other four grand elders were frightened by this sight.

Is this really an illusion? But Huang Chengyi was bleeding all over, sprawled on the grass while groaning in pain. This doesn’t seem to be an illusion!

Not only Huang Bingquan’s group, but even Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, and Huang Datou were frightened. As the third most powerful expert of Huang Family, a peak late-Seventh Level Nascent Soul Realm expert and also Huang Houde’s eldest uncle, Huang Chengyi’s status and identity within the family was only second to the old ancestor. Even the patriarch Huang Houde had to show some respect to him.

“Now, you should believe me, right?” Huang Xiaolong asked his parents as the force from his hand pulled Huang Chengyi off the ground and back into the villa. The entire time, Huang Chengyi was shrieking in pain, and because of the pain, his face was distorted.

As Huang Houde’s eldest uncle, Huang Chengyi hadn’t caused any less trouble for Huang Xiaolong’s family. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

All along, Huang Xiaolong intended to wait for Huang Houde to return from the capital city before dealing with Huang Houde, Huang Chengyi, Hunag Maosheng, and others in one swoop. But his parents didn't believe his strength, so he could only use Huang Chengyi and Huang Maosheng as a tool to prove his strength, then deal with Huang Houde when he returned.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you want to do?!” Huang Bingquan demanded with false bravado, “You, a junior, dares to violate the ancestral rules, and defies your elders! Quickly release Grand Elder Huang Chengyi, otherwise, you won’t be spared when the Old Ancestor returns!”

“Noisy!” Huang Xiaolong sent Huang Bingquan flying with a backhand slap, leaving him half embedded into the ground some distance away.

Although Huang Bingquan’s cultivation was lower than Huang Chengyi, he was still a late-Sixth Level Nascent Soul expert, one of Huang Family’s top five experts, and everything that had happened so far completely shut the remaining three grand elders up as they looked at Huang Xiaolong with horror.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong did not kill Huang Chengyi and Huang Maosheng, but he merely imprisoned them inside the Sun Moon Furnace.

“Huang Xiaolong, kill me if you’ve got the guts!” Huang Bingquan bellowed after climbing up from the ground, unable to endure the humiliation he suffered as his bloodshot eyes fixed on Huang Xiaolong, “My son is a general under the Huaxia Alliance, if you dare to…!”

But before he could finish, Huang Xiaolong’s hand made a clutching gesture in the air and Huang Bingquan exploded into a mist of blood, and not even his nascent soul escaped.

Probably, till the moment he died, it did not cross Huang Bingquan’s mind that Huang Xiaolong would really kill him, without the slightest hesitation.

Although Earth had entered the cultivation era, the law still existed, and killing was a crime.

What’s more, Huang Bingquan was one of the Huang Family’s grand elders, and his son was a general under the Huaxia Alliance governing body!
