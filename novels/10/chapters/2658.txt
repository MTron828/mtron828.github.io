Chapter 2659: Grand Dao Source Spring

When the Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi’s, Long Shengtian’s, and Fei Yanzi’s attacks reached the several uninvited guests, Huang Xiaolong’s Flying Heaven Spear also collided with attacks aimed at him.

Deafening rumbles shook the air.

All other noises in the world disappeared at this moment.

The overwhelming destructive force from several Primal Ancestors’ attacks swept outwards. Even a little bit of this degree of power could easily destroy a peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm expert with absolute decimation. Not even one’s holy soul would be able to escape.

Faces of the Otherworldly Mansion’s experts turned gray.

Right at this time, as Mo Zhi’s hands gestured in the air, the blinding lights burst out from the Five Spirits Peak, straight into the sky, and covered the entire Five Spirits Peak and everyone present. Everyone within the Five Spirits Peak felt the space around them twisted for a second, then, all of them were transferred into another space.

Destructive power swept through the space they were originally in and the space crumbled, reduced to dust that scattered away, leaving only a black void.

Watching this sight, every Otherworldly Mansion’s experts broke out in a cold sweat.

On the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong staggered back from the repelling force, feeling a burst of pain scorching through his hand that was holding the Flying Heaven Spear. However, as Huang Xiaolong’s holy energy circulated through his body, his discomfort disappeared.

When Huang Xiaolong parried the several old ancestors’ attack with the Flying Heaven Spear, on the battle stage, Yuan Qianxing’s body was suddenly enshrouded in resplendent light that turned into strands of origin energy and he disappeared from the battle stage.

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll pay you back today’s humiliation by a million times!”

Yuan Qianxing’s voice echoed loudly, filled with malice and brimming with killing intent that sent chills down the spine. Being targeted by an enemy that had the strength comparable to a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor was never something good.

However, replying to Yuan Qianxing’s threat was a stab to the void from Huang Xiaolong’s spear. The Flying Heaven Spear in Huang Xiaolong’s hand was infused with his three saint godheads’ powers, aiming straight at Yuan Qianxing’s chest. A streak of blinding light pierced into the void, and a split second later, Yuan Qianxing’s miserable scream reverberated in the air.

Any one could hear that stab just now had certainly given Yuan Qianxing a lot of pain.

Yuan Qianxing disappeared completely after that scream.

The Myriad Origin Race, Enchantress Race, Golden Buddha Race, and another race’s old ancestors, who had hidden in the void earlier, did not show up nor utter a sound. All around was heavy silence.

Huang Xiaolong did not bother to attempt chasing after Yuan Qianxing. Yuan Qianxing had an Inextinguishable Dao Heart, and many unknown trump cards. At his current strength, Huang Xiaolong knew that he could inflict heavy injuries on Yuan Qianxing but not kill him in a short time. Not to mention that there were the Myriad Origin Race and three other old ancestors protecting Yuan Qianxing. Thus this time, Huang Xiaolong had to let Yuan Qianxing go.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his saint godheads and Holy Mandate Imprint.

The curtain had fallen on the Otherworldly Mansion’s mansion young master competition. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Below the battle stage, Yuan Wangfeng, Yao Ji, and the rest of the Myriad Origin Race’s, Enchantress Race’s, and Golden Buddha Race’s experts’ faces were ugly to the extreme. Chen Muguang looked like a dead man. Before the competition had started, no one had expected this result.

Yuan Qianxing, with his Origin Saint Godhead, was hailed as the Son of Origin. But he had lost to Huang Xiaolong, who was merely a Fourth Heaven True Saint.

On the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over Yuan Wangfeng, Yao Ji, Chen Muguang, and the others, and they blanked for a second. When Chen Muguang felt Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, his knees buckled, and he almost fell on his arse on the ground.

Subsequently, before everyone’s astonished and fearful gazes, the Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi smiled as he announced the final result—Huang Xiaolong was the Otherworldly Mansion’s young master!

With his Xuanhuang Supreme Dragon, Nefarious origin, and Chaos Void Saint Godhead, twelve high-order Saint Fates, Huang Xiaolong’s promotion to the position of mansion young master was more than appropriate!

No one dared to voice any objection, not even Yuan Wangfeng who was very vocal against Huang Xiaolong.

The Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi, Deputy Mansion Master Long Shengtian, and the others all surrounded Huang Xiaolong as they congratulated him.

As the competition came to an end, news of the stage battle spread like wildfire through the Alien Lands. Experts in the numerous domains boiled in excitement, shock, and disbelief as if they were listening to some kind of unbelievable myth.

“Huang Xiaolong has three evolvable saint godheads? Twelve high-order Saint Fates?!”

“Not only that, I’ve heard he also has the Holy Mandate Imprint, and Inextinguishable Dao Heart! It is said that on the battle stage, Yuan Qianxing couldn’t withstand one strike from Huang Xiaolong, and even his pants shattered into fragments in the first blow!”

“In the end, Yuan Qianxing fled in a sorry state. If it wasn’t for the Myriad Origin Race’s old ancestor and several other old ancestors’ rescue, Yuan Qianxing probably wouldn’t have survived till the end! When Yuan Qianxing escaped, he only had his underpants on him, turning him into a laughing stock through the whole Alien Lands! Remember, how glorious he was before, with the Origin Saint Godhead? Hailed as the Son of Origin, he was a mansion master candidate, but now, he’s nothing!”

Through the Alien Lands were talks and whispers of the battle between Yuan Qianxing and Huang Xiaolong, shocking various races’ experts.

Naturally, Yuan Qianxing had become the biggest laughing stock in history.

The Myriad Origin Race, Enchantress Race, and Golden Buddha Race had ordered the disciples of their own races to spread rumors detrimental to Huang Xiaolong. For example, they were told to say that Huang Xiaolong had made insidious sneak attacks on Yuan Qianxing, or the Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi, Deputy Mansion Master Long Shengtian, and others had helped Huang Xiaolong in secret. They even accused Huang Xiaolong of being shameless. But when these rumors appeared, most of the people merely listened to it as a joke. No one believed a word of it.

Half a month later…

At nightfall…

On the top of the Chaos Essence Holy Peak, Huang Xiaolong was pondering.

There was news about the escaped Yuan Qianxing from the Otherworldly Mansion. Yuan Qianxing was seen at the boundary of the World River. Clearly, he was planning to hide in the World River. According to Long Shengtian’s analysis, Yuan Qianxing, very likely, was headed to the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race.”

“World River,” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

No matter what, leaving Yuan Qianxing alive was going to cause endless troubles. Thus he planned to go to the World River to tie up this loose end and also look for the Dragon Fish Race’s old ancestor to ask about the secret on the Creation Record’s last page.

Then again, before he set off to the World River, he needed to raise his strength a little more.

Dao Fruit, Huang Xiaolong muttered inwardly.

Now that he was the official Otherworldly Mansion’s young master, perhaps, he could ask Mo Zhi and Long Shengtian about the Three of Grand Dao and Dao Fruit. Since he was the mansion’s young master, he had the right to know about certain secrets.

After getting the Dao Fruit, he could probably advance to Fifth Heaven True Saint.

Early the next day, Huang Xiaolong went to see Mo Zhi and Long Shengtian, and managed to inquire about the Tree of Grand Dao and Dao Fruit.

Both Mo Zhi and Long Shengtian were surprised as neither of them had expected Huang Xiaolong to know that the Tree of Grand Dao was at the Otherworldly Mansion.

“Yes, the Tree of Grand Dao is in the forbidden land of our Otherworldly Mansion.”

After exchanging a brief glance, Mo Zhi nodded and did not conceal the matter. “The thing is, a few years back, it was traumatized, and it suffered some serious damages, which affected the Dao Fruits it bears. At the moment, there is no way the Dao Fruits can be collected, and even if you consume the Dao Fruit, it won’t have the ideal effects.”

They brought Huang Xiaolong into the Otherworldly Mansion’s forbidden land, in front of the towering Tree of Grand Dao. As they had said, the tree’s trunk was scorched black, and the six fist-sized fruits on its branches looked bleak, wrinkly and shrunken, as if their vitality had leaked away.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. Why is the situation so bad?

“In truth, there is a way to heal the Tree of Grand Dao, as long as there is the grand dao source spring.” Mo Zhi suddenly said, “When I went to the World River, I went because of this.”

“You mean the grand dao source spring is at the World River?” Huang Xiaolong immediately became spirited.
