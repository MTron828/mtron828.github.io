Countless cultivators filled the area around the tower, but they only raised their heads to see several figures shooting past them.

Some of them were shocked, and the complaints soon began.

Flying over their heads was an undisguised provocation!

“Preposterous!”

One of the Emperor Realm ancestors of some random superpower yelled and tried to slap Huang Xiaolong out of the sky. His palm covered the sky, and a massive claw reached out from the void.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother with him as he shot through the skies.

Seeing as the b*stard in the sky had ignored his palm, a chilly killing intent appeared in the ancestor’s eyes. However, he failed to react as one of the four odd beasts reached out to slap his attack out of the sky. With a single wave, the claw disappeared, and the ancestor suffered a massive impact in his chest as he flew through the air, spouting mouthfuls after mouthfuls of blood.

Everyone felt the blood drain from their face.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s reputation had already spread through Eternal Devil City, not many people had seen him. Even Gao Changran wasn’t widely recognized.

The Emperor Realm ancestor who had attacked Huang Xiaolong just now was someone who had recently exited seclusion.

“It’s Gao Changran from the Six Nether Gate!”

A voice echoed through the air after the expert was sent flying.

Everyone’s eyes instantly landed on Gao Changran, and they turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. A tremor ran through their hearts.

Initially, some friends of the injured ancestor wanted to take revenge for him. However, they were petrified after hearing the scream and learning who they were up against. In the next instant, they felt that their back was drenched in a cold sweat.

Even though they had never seen Huang Xiaolong, stories of him had been repeated so many times that many people felt as though their ears had rotted. His reputation was like thunder piercing through their ears.

The Emperor Realm expert who was flung away felt the anger in his heart dissipating as fear replaced it.

From that moment on, no one dared to stop Huang Xiaolong.

As such, Huang Xiaolong was able to arrive at the foot of the tower without any mishaps.

Everyone before him carved a pathway out before he could even open his mouth.

In the distance, the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor and Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor saw what had happened, and they harrumphed coldly.

A formless pressure suddenly pressed down on Huang Xiaolong, but he treated it as though they didn’t exist. Instead, he turned to Gao Changran and Wang Fanning before saying, “Wait here for me.”

“Yes, Lord!”

Even though everyone was allowed to climb the tower, everyone only had one chance in their life to do so. The Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor, Gao Changran, and the rest had already done so, and they could only watch.

Even existences who surpassed the Emperor Realm couldn’t force their way into the Devil Tower.

Under everyone’s watchful gaze, Huang Xiaolong stepped into the first floor of the tower.

“Do we make a move?” The Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor felt his heart shake when Huang Xiaolong stepped in, and he whispered to the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor.

At that moment, the four odd beasts were quite a distance away from him, and if they made a sneak attack, they felt that there was no way for Huang Xiaolong to escape.

A look of hesitation flashed through the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor’s eyes, but he shook his head. “Let’s wait till the Devil Tower disappears.”

He didn’t know why, but an uneasy feeling had filled his heart when he had tried to make a move earlier. The feeling was completely unfounded, but he felt that he had to trust it as he had managed to avoid a huge calamity in the past by trusting his gut.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared through the gates while they were reflecting on their actions.

As for the Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor, he felt that it was a pity to have missed the best opportunity to kill Huang Xiaolong.

As Xing Tian stared at the two of them, he silently noted down their expressions.

“Lord Archdevil Ancestor, we received news that Shi Ming of the Nine Yin Corpse Tribe and Chi Han of the Massacring Gods Gate are in the Secret Yuan Mansion. Do we send people to keep an eye on them?” Li Yu transmitted his voice to Xing Tian’s mind.

“There is no need. We don’t intend to clash with them anyway. Whatever the case, someone will naturally deal with them when the time comes.”

Li Yu was stunned.

The Devil Tower lit up all of a sudden and broke his train of thoughts. Someone in the crowd screamed, “It’s Young Lady Xing Yinuo! She has arrived on the second floor of the tower!”

Since the Devil Tower’s space was connected to the outside world, any disciple in the tower could transmit news to the outside world. Xing Yinuo’s arrival on the second floor spread like wildfire.

Xing Yuan shook his head and smiled. “Nuo’er is still a step behind...”

In everyone’s eyes, Xing Yinuo had used a day to ascend to the second floor, and her speed was unbelievable. However, in the eyes of the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor, she was a tad bit too slow.

Compared to Chen Weijian, she had taken six more hours to ascend to the second floor. Even though it wasn’t too big of a gap, it definitely existed.

In the distance, the Hundred Transformation Sect’s old men were also keeping their eyes on the second floor.

“Young master has already arrived on the second floor of the Devil Tower for five to six hours. He should be able to arrive on the third floor in three days, right?” Elder Long estimated.

“In the past, Heavenless Archdevil Lord had used two whole days to reach the third floor. If our young master manages to beat his record, wouldn’t that mean that he will be able to ascend to the ninth floor in half a year?” Another one of the ancestors from the Hundred Transformation Sect exclaimed.

“The black-haired kid entered not too long ago. I wonder how high his level of talent is.” Another elder sneered. “I’m afraid he isn’t lagging too far behind...”

“So what if he has talent? I don’t think he’ll be able to reach the second floor even after young master reaches the third.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Right at that moment, another burst of light erupted from the tower.

“It’s Qin Hongbao! Qin Hongbao has reached the second floor!”

Right after Xing Yinuo’s arrival on the second floor, the Devil World’s other supreme genius completed the same feat.

“The talents in our Devil World are special in their own right. Xing Yinuo and Qin Hongbao have managed to climb to the second floor on their first day. Chen Weijian took less than a day. I’m afraid even Heavenly Prince Di Jing of the Divine World or that Huang Xiaolong guy won’t be able to catch up to him.” The old ancestor of another superpower sneered.

“If I were to say it, even if Heavenly Prince Di Jing or that whatever his name is comes here, they won’t be able to climb to the second floor even if we gave them three days!” A sneer emerged from the crowd.

“That’s right. Heavenly Dao Godhead?! Three king of supreme godheads? I think that their talent has been exaggerated! Even if they are talented, they won’t be able to match up to the three supreme geniuses of our Devil World!

Some of the disciples started to discuss their thoughts, and clamor broke out in the crowd.

The Devil World always hated the Divine World. Of course, no one liked the talents from the Divine World.

Even though the news of the Battle of the Heavenly Court had already spread through the great worlds, and no matter how much people said that Huang Xiaolong and Di Jing had revealed unrivaled talent, no one in the Devil World wanted to believe in it.

At that moment, Huang Xiaolong had already arrived before a massive mountain on the tower’s first floor.
