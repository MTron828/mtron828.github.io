Chapter 3220: He’s Not Qualified!

The Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World!

Celestial Emperor Zeng Le, Celestial Emperor Huang Dinghai, and the various world leaders standing around were shocked.

All this time, they used everything they could to discover the identity of the Son of Creation chosen by the old ancestor.

Now, Di Cangtian revealed the identity of Huang Xiaolong to everyone present.

“It’s him?!”

“How can it be?!”

“There’s no way!”

Many experts didn’t want to believe what they were hearing.

“Why are all of you standing there? Greet His Highness right now!” Di Cangtian roared when he saw the experts of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire standing there like wooden dolls.

His yell rocked the entire region and Di Xiaolong and the others hastily rushed over.

The appointment ceremony was set for the next day, and the experts who should be present should have already arrived. In fact, even the world leaders from other celestial empires had come.

The Blazing Dragon wasn’t just the old ancestor of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire, he was also the God of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World! As such, the holy worlds contained in the Blazing Dragon World sent their world leaders over to witness the ceremony.

Staring at each other, the patriarchs of the various factions started to hesitate.

Even Di Xiaolong paused for a second.

Just a second ago, he wanted nothing more than to kill Huang Xiaolong! Now, his father was making him kneel before the man!

“Humph!” A snort left Di Cangtian’s lips and Di Xiaolong felt as though a sledgehammer was slammed straight into his chest. He vomited a mouthful of golden blood and he yelled in pain.

“Father?!”

“Kneel!” A frosty light flashed through Di Cangtian’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong remained silent as he watched the scene play out before him.

Di Xiaolong’s expression was ugly to the extreme as he kneeled before Huang Xiaolong. “I greet Your Highness, the Son of Creation!” Endless rage filled his heart.

Di Cangtian, Di Yu, and the others stared at the various world leaders standing around.

No longer able to drag things out, the various world leaders got to their knees. Their greeting caused the space around them to shake, and even the experts from the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire didn’t know what to do.

“Since Huang Xiaolong is appointed as the Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World, everyone shall pay their respects!” A formless voice rang through the skies.

Staring at the void in shock, someone exclaimed in terror, “It’s the God of Creation, Lord Zeng Ling!”

Another wave shook the crowd when the arrival of Zeng Ling was announced.

The experts of the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire who were hesitating just a moment ago got to their knees instantly.

“We greet Your Highness!”

Even old freaks who had been in hiding for a long time got to their knees.

Eventually, only the members of the True Dragon Celestial Empire were left standing.

Di Cangtian looked towards them and he snorted, “Huang Dinghai, why aren’t you and the members of your celestial empire on your knees?”

His voice traveled through the Blazing Dragon World.

In an instant, all eyes turned to Huang Dinghai.

Roaring with laughter all of a sudden, Huang Dinghai looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World? What a joke! Di Cangtian, do you really think he’s the Son of Creation because you said so? Huang Xiaolong isn’t even from your Blazing Dragon World! He’s not qualified to be the Son of Creation!”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

“That’s right! Huang Xiaolong isn’t someone from your Blazing Dragon World! He’s not qualified to be our Son of Creation!” Another voice traveled through the void.

When Di Cangtian realized that he had no idea who just spoke, his expression sank.

“That’s right! Only someone from our world has the ability to be the Son of Creation!” Someone else yelled. “Huang Xiaolong is already the Son of Creation of the Huang Long World! What rights does he have to be the Son of Creation of our Blazing Dragon World?! Get lost!”

The voices rocked through the air and Di Cangtian failed to lock on to the speaker.

Huang Shengdao finally spoke up all of a sudden. “Huang Xiaolong, did you hear that? You’re not a person from our Blazing Dragon World. Do you really think you’re the Son of Creation just because Di Cangtian and the others say you are?”

“Don’t forget. There’s three celestial empires in the Blazing Dragon World!”

“If you wish to become the Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World, all of us will have to agree!”

Huang Shengdao snorted.

Even though Fu Luosen didn’t say a word, everyone could see that he was gloating happily at the side.

“Do you think our old ancestor need to go through you to determine the Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World?”

Huang Dinghai spoke up all of a sudden. “The Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World will decide the future of our world. It concerns all three celestial empires, and all of us will have to come to a consensus!”

In fact, that was the reason the True Dragon Celestial Empire sent their men over!

“The Blazing Dragon World was created by me, and I’m more than capable of making the decision on my own! Who the f*ck do you think you are?!” A voice descended from the heavens all of a sudden it brought about a crushing pressure.

The voice sounded through the various worlds, and even the territory of the other celestial empires failed to block out the soundwave. It was especially so for the True Dragon Celestial Empire.

“It’s Lord Creation, the God of Creation, Blazing Dragon!”

Ancient experts exclaimed in shock.

“Lord Blazing Dragon!”

The entire Blazing Dragon World broke out into cheers when they heard his voice.

“Old Ancestor.”

The experts of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire felt tears streaming down their faces.

Even though Huang Sheng’s strength had surpassed the Blazing Dragon, the old dragon was the true creator of the Blazing Dragon World. There was no way Huang Sheng could overtake the old dragon’s position in the Blazing Dragon World.

Even Princess Zeng Ying was moved by the presence of the old dragon.

The old dragon was the person most people in the Blazing Dragon World looked up to, and Zeng Ying was no exception.

Huang Dinghai swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock when he heard the old dragon’s voice. He was strong, but he was smart enough to know that he couldn’t stand up to the old dragon.

Two miserable shrieks rang out in the void as two figures fell to the ground. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yin Yang Buddha!”

“Silver Headed Ghost!”

Many experts yelled in fright when they saw the two figures. They were monsters whose fame rocked the Blazing Dragon World, and they were even more famous than You Ming of the Nether Spirit Palace!

It was evident that they were the ones challenging Huang Xiaolong’s authority previously! Now that the old dragon was here, there was nowhere for them to hide!
