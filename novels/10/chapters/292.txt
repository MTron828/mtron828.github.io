Chapter 293: So, It Was Like This...

“Your Young Lord wants to see me?” Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance at the two pompous young man, “What if I decline...?”

Ideally, Huang Xiaolong preferred not to have any conflict with this Zhao Chen, but he was not a soft persimmon that everyone could pinch or squash as they liked.

“Decline?” Chen Cheng and Zhang Chu exchanged a look between them before laughing in a brazen manner.

Still laughing, Chen Cheng said, “Little rascal, perhaps you don’t know who our Young Lord is? Our Young Lord is Young Noble Zhao Chen. In the Bedlam Lands, there is yet anyone who dared to defy our Young Lord’s words!”

“Our Young Lord orders you to go meet him, that is your greatest honor,” Zhang Chu snickered, “Little rascal, I advise you to follow us obediently, otherwise, hehe...” an undisguised antagonistic spark shone in his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong remained nonchalant, “If your Young Lord wants to see me, tell him to roll over himself.” Not waiting to see the two young men’s reaction, Huang Xiaolong looked over to Qin Yang and the other three, saying “Let’s go.”

“Yes, Young Lord.”

Roll over?! Chen Cheng and Zhang Chu were enraged hearing Huang Xiaolong actually dared to tell their Young Lord to roll over even after knowing his identity.

“Bastard, you’re courting death!” Chen Cheng struck his fist out in rage towards Huang Xiaolong. Trailing the powerful punch was a surreal shadow of a tiger’s wide opened jaw.

Feeling the strong energy fluctuation coming at him, Huang Xiaolong dared not underestimate the enemy, his feet swiftly retreated as his hands formed a fist and punched outㅡthe Great Void Divine Fist!

The Great Void Divine Fist, ethereal, yet tangible the next moment, reality and illusion overlapped, collided head-on with the tiger fist.

A booming explosion resounded, raising a curtain of sand and dust.

Huang Xiaolong’s body shook, retreating more than ten meters back, however, Chen Cheng also retreated more ten meters back.

“You!” Chen Cheng was astounded as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, he was a peak late-Xiantian Eighth Order expert and he could see that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even broken through to the early Eighth Order.

Zhang Chu was no exception.

“Brat, no wonder you’re so arrogant, relying on these few points of strength.” Zhang Chu smirked derisively, “Do you think with only this much strength you can defy our Young Lord’s order?! Let me enlighten you, even if you were a Saint realm expert, there’s only death in defying our Young Lord!” A dark teal light burst out from Zhang Chu’s body, both hands formed into claws, slashing down towards Huang Xiaolong.

More than a dozen dark teal lights transformed into dozens of snakes that were as thick as an adult’s arm, flaring out in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

Zhang Chu was an early-Xiantian Ninth Order, a mere difference of a small order, but his attack was many times more powerful than Chen Cheng.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed, his expression turning grim. Both his hands struck out and glowing golden rings pierced the air. Where the golden rings passed, all attacks slowed down and gradually stopped in midair.

Zhang Chu was dumbfounded: what kind of battle skill was this?!

At this time, Qin Yang, Lifei, and the rest moved, blasting off the dozens of teal green snakes.

“Who is it? So audacious as to fight inside the City of Myriad Gods!” From afar, a voice thundered, echoes reverberated in the street, even building structures seemed to shake. In less than a breath’s time, a team city guards clad in shiny black armors appeared riding on Earth Tiger mounts, galloping into the scene.

Seeing this, Chen Cheng and Zhang Chu had no choice but to stop.

Moments later, the team of city guards arrived. A seemingly captain-like middle-aged man of the team nudged his Earth Tiger mount closer, stopping in front of Huang Xiaolong and the others.

“Captain Wang.” Seeing the middle-aged man, Zhang Chu cupped his fist and greeted with a smile.

Wang Hai was surprised, seeing it was Chen Cheng and Zhang Chu both, he laughed and said, “So it was Brother Zhang Chu and Chen Cheng.” Wang Hai dismounted from the tiger beast’s back as he did so.

Huang Xiaolong stood where he was, watching. It was surprising to see that Chen Cheng and Zhang Chu were familiar with City of Myriad God’s city guards captain. Judging from their greetings, they seemed to be on good terms too. He waited expectantly to see how this captain would handle the matter.

At this time, Zhang Chu proceeded to ‘explain’ the situation with a smile, “Captain Wang, you truly arrive at the right time,” with one finger pointing at Huang Xiaolong, Zhang Chu continued, “We have some previous grudges with this punk, we didn’t expect him to ambush us while we weren’t paying attention.”

Wang Hai nodded, “So it was like this...” then, his expression became cold as he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, don’t you know it’s prohibited to fight inside the City of Myriad Gods?” Without waiting for Huang Xiaolong to explain, Wang Hai waved at his subordinates at the back, “Arrest all of them first, throw into the dungeon.”

“Yes, Captain.”

The team of city guards quickly surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s group of five.

This result raised a mocking sneer on Huang Xiaolong’s face; since this was the way they wanted to play, he didn’t mind slaughtering his way out.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to call out the Blades of Asura, preparing to let blood flow, suddenly a voice sounded from the void above: “Stop!” The voice wasn’t loud but it contained a strong deterrence force that crushed any objection. Everyone turned to look.

A gray haired old man in mulberry robe strode over, on the chest of his robe was embroidered a double-headed celestial beast emblem, and surrounding the beast were extremely life-like dark, fiery red flames. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Noticing this person’s arrival, Chen Cheng and Zhang Chu’s face tightened, ashen a little. In the next moment, Wang Hai hastened forward to greet the old man, “Greeting Senior He!”

Senior He? The name struck Huang Xiaolong’s mind: He Yunxiong! This old man was none other than Millennium City’s He Yunxiong, one of the top ten experts of Bedlam Landsㅡthat He Yunxiong.

He Yunxiong ignored Wang Hai, walking straight towards Huang Xiaolong as his eyes observed him up and down. There was praise in his eyes, rubbing his barely-exist beard in an appreciative gesture, He Yunxiong smiled, “Not a bad brat, are you interested in worshipping me as your Master?”

Worship He Yunxiong as master?

People who gathered closeby was dumbfounded hearing He Yunxiong’s words, especially Wang Hai, Chen Cheng, and Zhang Chu, their mouths agape.

Huang Xiaolong sweated quietly, if he didn’t know that this old man in front of him was He Yunxiong, he’d definitely suspect whether this old man was crazy. Before Huang Xiaolong could answer, Zhang Chu stepped forward, venturing with caution, “Senior He, this kid is someone our Young Lord...”

However, his sentence has yet to finish when He Yunxiong flick his robe sleeve and Zhang Chu felt as if he slammed into a tall mountain. His entire body shot away in a tragic holler until he reached the end of the street. Crashing onto the street pavement, not even a grunt came.

“I, He Yunxiong, am talking, it is not a place where a slave like you can interrupt.” He Yunxiong scoffed, not even turning around to look.

Chen Cheng looked over at the end of the street where Zhang Chu’s corpse laid, he was so terrified that even his bones were shivering, falling butt first to the ground. Wang Hai and the team of city guards sweated profusely, looking pale as white sheets.

He Yunxiong pointed a finger at Chen Cheng, and he was thrown back several hundred meters away, blood spurting from his mouth as he landed.

“Return and tell that brat Zhao Chen that I like this kid.” He Yunxiong’s light, fleeting voice sounded.

“Yes, yes, yes, many thanks for Senior He’s mercy in sparing my life!” Chen Cheng fled for his life in panic after a series of kowtows, in a mere few seconds, his figure disappeared in the crowd.

Wang Hai felt an itching thirst in his throat, standing there and not daring to move.

“Why aren’t you scramming away?” He Yunxiong snapped at Wang Hai.

“Yes, yes, Senior He.” Immediately, not even climbing onto his mount, he led his subordinates and ran away on foot.
