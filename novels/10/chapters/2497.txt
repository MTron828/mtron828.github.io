Chapter 2498: Furtive Lands

“Yeah! That’s him!” Another disciple nodded and continued, “Legends have it that the Black Corpse Holy Emperor killed the disciple of the Great Crossing Sage. Due to that, the Great Crossing Sage went to fight with the Black Corpse Holy Emperor, and they disappeared after a massive battle.

The Great Crossing Sage was part of the first batch of True Saints in the Holy World.

Even though the Black Corpse Holy Emperor was one of the ten strongest individuals in the Holy World, no one knew who was stronger between the two of them.

The Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury had actually surfaced in the Furtive Lands in the Ghost Devil City!

It was no wonder the disciples of the Clear Snow Palace, Holy Heavens, Devil Palace, and the other peak powers were rushi+ng over.

One had to know that the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s reputation and status in the Holy World could challenge the Great Crossing Sage and those in the first batch of True Saints in the Holy World!

“Jin Taiji from the Vajra Race practiced the Great Crossing Fist, and he probably managed to obtain the Great Crossing Sage’s inheritance! Now that the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury has reappeared, will his inheritance be passed down?” Flames burned in the eyes of yet another disciple, “If we manage to obtain the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s inheritance, we will enter the True Saint Realm without any difficulties.”

“Let’s keep dreaming. Even if the Black Corpse Holy Emperor left his inheritance behind, we wouldn’t be the ones to obtain it. Senior Brother You Lingzi might be able to…,” one of the disciples shook his head and explained, “The Furtive Lands is one of the forbidden lands in the Ghost Devil City and even True Saints might not be able to leave alive. We shouldn’t dream of going there.”

As they discussed with each other, a low voice rang in their ears, “Which part of the Furtive Lands did the treasury appear in?”

The group of disciples leaped to their feet in shock.

“Who?!”

The ghost devil qi before them parted, and a figure walked towards them.

“Huang Xiaolong!” They were shocked when they discovered the newcomer.

Even though he had traveled slowly, he arrived before them after a few breaths of time.

The disciples of the Ghost Talisman Holy Gate finally snapped back to attention as they surrounded Huang Xiaolong. They blocked off all routes of retreat.

One of them even sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, are you tired of living? You barged in here even after noticing us. Do you really think that you’re the invincible presence you once were in the Mirage Pavilion? Right now, you’re just a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint in a land full of high-level half-True Saints!”

A murderous light flashed in the eyes of another disciple. “You killed so many disciples from our holy gate in the Mirage Pavilion previously. How do you wish to pay for your sins? Make your choice. I’ll let you choose the way you wish to die!”

“How dare you ask for the location of the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury in the Furtive Lands?! Why don’t you call me your daddy? Maybe I’ll tell you then!”

The disciples roared with laughter.

Since all of them were mid-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints or stronger, they didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong was a threat!

A smirk formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “You could have told me the location like the obedient little kids you are. I was considering to let you off, but I guess not.”

After staring at Huang Xiaolong for a second, all of them burst out laughing.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you think you’re Li Chen or something?!” Someone snorted with displeasure, “If you were Li Chen, we would have had no choice but to tell you everything we know! But, it’s too bad that you’re just a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint!”

“Why are we wasting our breath on him? Just cripple him, and we can torture him however we want!” Someone revealed a sinister laugh and continued, “I can’t help but tremble in excitement when I think about how we’ll be the ones to kill Huang Xiaolong!”

Anyone would be incomparably excited if they got to kill the greatest genius the Holy World had seen.

However, the words barely left his lips when Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed. Searing pain shot through his body, and he realized that his neck was grabbed by Huang Xiaolong.

With Huang Xiaolong’s speed, no one managed to react when he choked one of their fellow disciples.

They stared at the scene before them in shock.

“Huang Xiaolong, release Junior Brother Liu immediately!” Someone roared as a punch flew towards Huang Xiaolong. Ghost qi surged through the valley and charged at Huang Xiaolong.

Without turning his body, Huang Xiaolong casually punched backwards.

Boom!

The disciple, who tried to make a move on Huang Xiaolong, smashed into one of the valley faces, and his entire body shattered. With his cultivation base at the mid-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, he was no match for Huang Xiaolong. He was sent deep into the wall, and he had long since breathed his last.

The three other disciples gasped in shock.

Our fellow disciple was sent flying with a single punch?!

Is this youngster really Huang Xiaolong?!

There should be no mistakes! We saw him in the Mirage Pavilion, so he is definitely Huang Xiaolong! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He was the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint, Huang Xiaolong!

“You!” Before they could continue with their threats, a golden figure shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Endless holy might filled the valley.

The disciples felt their minds go blank, and they stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

…

Ten minutes passed and Huang Xiaolong was done refining their saint attributes. Of course, he didn’t forget to absorb their memories while he was at it.

He was disappointed when he realized that they had no idea where the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury had appeared.

Of course, he plundered their bodies and found some origin herbs and treasures.

Even though no one could bring in holy artifacts and holy pills, there were tons of origin treasures and origin spiritual herbs growing in the city. Didn’t the Knowledge Singularity Chamber of Commerce locate the Blood Devil Holy Spiritual Stone in the Ghost Devil City? The disciples from the Ghost Talisman Holy Gate probably found some treasures while roaming about.

After storing the treasures, Huang Xiaolong continued on his way to the Furtive Lands.

With his speed, he would be able to arrive at the Furtive Lands by daybreak even if he didn’t use his Dao Heart and holy souls to increase his speed.

“Xie Bufan, Dou Rui, Xiao Lengxue, and Su Biqing should be rushi+ng over too, right?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled in his mind. There was even a possibility that Xie Bufan had already entered the Furtive Lands.

Since the Ghost Devil City was boundless, Huang Xiaolong knew that it would be nearly impossible to locate his targets. Even with his holy souls, he wouldn’t be able to cover the entire city. But right now, it seemed as though they had a common goal.

They would definitely rush towards the Furtive Lands as soon as they learn of the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury.

As he rushed through the night, the day eventually broke.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong dealt with the ghost devils with a sweep of his hand.

By the time the first ray of light landed on the land, Huang Xiaolong had arrived at the edge of the Furtive Lands.

Staring at the region filled with terrifying ghost devil qi, Huang Xiaolong paused for a second. Then, in the next moment, he charged into the Furtive Lands.
