Chapter 3720: Appearance of the White Deer

Yang Dingsheng gasped in fright when he saw the spiritual vein Huang Xiaolong retrieved. “That… That’s a Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life!”

Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life! It was a top-grade universe-level spiritual vein, and it was something that would hardly appear in the outside world! Since the start of time, it was said that the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life had only appeared twice! With the one Huang Xiaolong had brought out, it would appear for the third time in the Thirteen Universes!

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Huang Xiaolong stole hundreds of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins from the Star Refinement King previously. Even though he used a large part of it, there were nearly a hundred left. The Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life was one of the rarest of those left.

As an ancient existence, Yang Dingsheng might have been through a lot. Even so, his heart failed to remain calm when he saw the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life. After all, the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life was similar to the bloodline of the White Deer! It had the ability to cure any injuries!

The Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life would be equally as useful to treat his wife’s injuries.

Huang Xiaolong knew what he was thinking about and muttered, “Brother Yang, even though the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life might be useful in treating her injuries, it’s not a solution.”

Yang Dingsheng snapped back to reality and sighed to himself.

Huang Xiaolong was right. Even with the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, he wouldn’t be able to completely heal her dao soul. The only way to save her was to subdue the White Deer.

Using his grand cosmos energy, Huang Xiaolong forced the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life to emit boundless energy. The radiance that came from the spiritual vein contained the power of life and it pierced straight through the continent.

Yang Dingsheng was shocked to discover what Huang Xiaolong was doing. However, he soon managed to guess his intention. A wave of gratefulness swept through his heart.

As the power of life spread through the lands, every single inch of land glowed a faint white.

Half an hour passed quickly.

Even though the power of life spread through the lands, everything remained as silent as could be.

Yang Dingsheng slowly started to panic.

In contrast, Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive.

An hour passed…

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as there wasn’t a single reaction from the creature in the land.

Was he wrong?

Increasing the intensity of his grand cosmos energy, even stronger waves of life filled the land. A slight buzzing sound could be heard as the rays of light sank deep into the continent.

Huang Xiaolong’s control of his energy was too precise. The energy waves didn’t leak out from the continent to the rest of the White Deer Cave.

He didn’t wish to alert the experts who came to the White Deer Cave.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Otherwise, everyone would charge over in an attempt to steal his spiritual vein!

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong increased the intensity of his grand cosmos energy, a tiny little deer appeared in the distance and it walked towards them!

It looked extremely docile, and it glowed with a faint white light.

There were two little horns on its head, and they shone with a brilliant light.

Yang Dingsheng was extremely shocked to discover its arrival. Right before he could approach the deer, Huang Xiaolong reached out to stop him.

Yang Dingsheng knew what Huang Xiaolong’s intention was, and he hesitated slightly. Eventually, he chose to remain still.

The White Deer glanced at Yang Dingsheng casually, but there was an unmistakable look of contempt in its eyes. It looked at Yang Dingsheng as though he was nothing more than an ant.

Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong, a look of visible confusion appeared in its eyes. It tried to see through Huang Xiaolong and a solemn expression soon appeared on its face.

“You’re pretty strong…” An enchanting voice left the White Deer’s lips.

Yang Dingsheng turned to look at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. How could someone with only 15 billion units of combat strength be considered pretty strong?

“Were you planning on capturing me by luring me all the way out here with the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life? You might be strong, but you’re dreaming if you think that you can capture me.”

One had to admit that the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life was extremely tempting even for the White Deer. Even though it knew that Huang Xiaolong was planning to lure it out, it came out nonetheless.

“That’s right. I planned to lure you out here with the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, but my intention isn’t to capture you,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “I wish to make a deal with you.”

“A deal?” A ray of light flashed through the White Deer’s eyes, and it continued, “What do you propose?”

“I hope you can save someone for me. Also, I wish to know the whereabouts of the Universe Source Stone.”

Since the Universe Source Stone was located in the White Deer Cave, the White Deer probably knew its whereabouts. That was the main reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s desire to draw it out.”

“How do you know about the Universe Source Stone?!” The White Deer gasped in shock as it looked at Huang Xiaolong with a renewed sense of caution.

Yang Dingsheng was equally as surprised.

Is there really a piece of Universe Source Stone located in the White Deer Cave?!

“That’s right. As long as you agree to my conditions, I’ll give you the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

A grin that resembled that of a human appeared on the White Deer’s face. “You’re right. I do know where the Universe Source Stone is. However, do you really think that the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life is enough to trade for information on it?”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all as he retrieved another Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life from the Universe Boat. “What if I add another?”

The White Deer stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Two strands of Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life!

The Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life only appeared twice in the history of the Thirteen Universes. However, the youngster standing before it brought out two other strands!

A look of disbelief could be seen on Yang Dingsheng’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

After snapping back to reality, the White Deer shook its head. “No. That’s still not enough.”

Huang Xiaolong silently retrieved another spiritual vein from the Universe Boat.

The spiritual vein that appeared was slightly different from the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life, but it emitted dense waves of life energy.

“White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Vein!” Yang Dingsheng gasped.

The White Sun Phoenix Flame Spiritual Vein was at the same level as the Radiant Spiritual Vein of Life.
