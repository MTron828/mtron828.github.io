Chapter 2837: Divulging the News

Before he left, Huang Xiaolong used his cosmos energy to dispel the Yin Borer Poison in Fei Yanzi. He was shocked to discover that the poison was starting to disperse under the power of his cosmos energy.

The poison was completely driven out of her body after some time.

Fei Yanzi nearly jumped in joy. The Yin Borer Poison had been plaguing her for too many years, and she couldn’t use her grand dao energy in battles. Her cultivation had been stagnant the entire time, but she could finally make some progress!

Finally, the poison was gone!

She heaved a sigh of relief the moment the poison disappeared.

“Xiaolong, thank you!” Out of excitement, Fei Yanzi hugged Huang Xiaolong and smiled happily.

Huang Xiaolong cleared his throat and chuckled, “It’s nothing. There’s no need to be polite.”

Luckily for the two of them, they were the only ones present. If Cangqiong Old Man and the others were there, he would have to endure their teasing for days.

If he knew that his cosmos energy had the power to drive the poison out of her body, he wouldn’t have waited for so long.

The only thing that puzzled him was the fact that the Yin Borer Poison wasn’t supposed to be easy to neutralize. According to Duan Feng and Long Jianfei, ordinary Dao Venerables would be hard pressed to do anything to the poison! However, he was able to!

Could it be because the cosmos energy he had was different from the rest?

“I wonder what’s the level of my small world.” Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.

Like his dao souls, the small world in his body was separated into different levels. It ranked from one to ten, and ten was the highest one could go!

As the level of the small world increased, the ability of the cosmos energy he wielded increased with it. The rate of growth was much faster than before, and the chances of it converting to a great world were much larger!

In the Divine Tuo Holy World, only the strongest creeds had the ability to test the small world in a Dao Venerable’s body. As such, he wouldn’t be able to come to a conclusion any time soon.

Even though he couldn’t determine the exact level, he felt that they should at the very least be at the seventh level.

There was even a possibility that it to be higher!

Dispersing Fei Yanzi’s Yin Borer Poison resolved Huang Xiaolong’s worries. He would have never been at ease if he had failed to cure her, as looking for the Yin Borer King would be extremely difficult in the massive Divine Tuo Holy World.

Huang Xiaolong stayed in Cangqiong Sacred Land for another month and gave pointers to Fei Yanzi and Cangqiong Old Man. At the same time, he discussed the future of Cangqiong Sacred Land.

Huang Xiaolong felt emotional when he started to guide the old man. It felt like yesterday when he had received the old man’s teachings. In several hundred years, their roles were reversed.

A month later, Huang Xiaolong set out on his journey towards the Dragon Fish Creed.

“Xiaolong, will we ever meet again?” Before parting ways, Fei Yanzi asked softly as her eyes turned red.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second, but a smile formed on his face. “Silly girl, I’m going to the Dragon Fish Creed. It’s not like I’m not coming back. In several thousand years, I’ll be back!”

With his current cultivation speed, he would definitely break through to the Dao Venerable Realm in a thousand years!

After breaking through the Dao Venerable Realm, he would return.

Of course, he needed enough cultivation resources to make that happen. Without it, it wouldn’t matter how strong his Huang Long Bloodline was! He would never be able to break through without the use of countless treasures.

When she heard his promise, her eyes lit up, and she nodded her head slowly.

Next, Huang Xiaolong bade farewell to Cangqiong Old Man and Mo Zhi.

Though a thousand years was not that long, it couldn’t be considered a short time either. Everyone was reluctant to part.

“Let’s go!” Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng leaped into the air and landed on the Immemorial Qilins. They disappeared in the blink of an eye, and the only thing they left behind were two rays of light.

As Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette vanished, Fei Yanzi and the others stood motionless for a long time.

The two of them moved extremely quickly, and they left the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave in a couple of days.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t head to the Dragon Fish Creed immediately. Instead, he went to the Blue Heaven Creed.

Decades ago, he had suppressed Yi Beihang and a few others. He knew that their hatred for him had reached the peak. Now, he needed to solve the problem at the root and make them surrender completely.

To not attract attention, Huang Xiaolong used some treasures to redesign the Qilin Chariot. He covered up the Immemorial Grand Dao Formation on it.

By masking the smell, he changed their appearances slightly to make them look like ordinary qilins.

Now, his chariot looked like the ones used on Earth in the ancient times.

During the journey, he didn’t alarm anyone, and he headed straight for the headquarters of the Blue Heaven Creed.

When he entered, Yi Beihang and the two other hall masters were sitting in the main hall. They were stuck in a dilemma F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Patriarch, are we really going to take this lying down?! He took half our treasury and dao origin! This is nonsense! Whenever I think about it, I want nothing more than to rip Cangqiong Sacred Land into pieces!” He Yugui roared in anger.

He felt humiliated every time he thought about it.

Yi Beihang sighed, “What can we do?”

He was equally as angry. However, the four of them couldn’t match up to Huang Xiaolong even with the assistance of the dao origin! There were only three of them left, and the dao origin’s power was reduced by half! How in the world were they supposed to deal with the monster that was Huang Xiaolong?!

“Maybe we can join hands with the Glorious Creed! Huang Xiaolong has to be hiding something! Moreover, the Glorious Creed will definitely be tempted by his Immemorial Sword and Immemorial Treasury!” Wang Jin narrowed his eyes and said.

Yi Beihang’s eyes sparkled.

“I think we should do what Brother Wang Jin said. Since the start of the Divine Tuo Holy World, no one has been able to possess twelve high-order Saint Fates. The Glorious Creed will definitely be interested to learn his secrets.” He Yugui added.

“We can even spread the news around to other Creeds! When that happens, he’ll die a miserable death!” Rays of bitter resentment appeared from He Yugui’s eyes.

Although Huang Xiaolong had forced them to swear an oath never to divulge the news of what happened that day, they were strong enough to withstand the backlash of breaking the oath! After all, damaged dao foundations could be restored with enough treasures.
