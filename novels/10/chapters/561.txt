Huang Xiaolong’s glorious win over a late Second Order God Realm Wang Biaoyuan during the outer disciples’ assessment raised a great wave of shock throughout the galaxy’s forces for almost a month before it eventually calmed down.

In this one month’s time, Huang Xiaolong simply stayed inside the Institute Principal’s manor to cultivate and did not step out of the manor.

After advancing to Second Order God Realm, Huang Xiaolong noticed that the time he could stay in Hell had increased to roughly a day. When his battle qi depleted, the recovery period was now reduced to slightly more than an hour’s time. He was more than delighted at this discovery.

While he was still at peak late-First Order God Realm, he could only stay for two to three hours, but now, his cultivation time in Hell had increased seven to eightfold. Before this, he needed one day and one night’s time to recover his exhausted battle qi, but now it was reduced to a mere hour.

This greatly increased the effectiveness and speed of Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong estimated that he’d need three years to break through to Third Order God Realm, now however, in at most two years, probably not even two years, he could step into Third Order God Realm.

Days passed, approximately two months passed since the outer disciples’ assessment.

On this particular day, Huang Xiaolong ended his routine cultivation.

‘I should have my own courtyard now.’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Although the spiritual energy in his Master’s manor was abundant, it was irrelevant to Huang Xiaolong, for the spiritual energy in Hell was by far much purer and higher grade. Most importantly, it wasn’t really convenient for him to cultivate here on a long-term basis.

He didn’t want to expose the secrets on his body at this point, this included his Master Feng Yang. For instance, the Dragon Pearl, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s existence, or that he could summon a gateway to Hell, entering a higher world surface to cultivate at any time.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong decided to move out from his Master’s manor.

Every Black Warrior Institute’s inner disciple could have their individual courtyard. He was already a Second Order God Realm and the first place winner in the outer disciple assessment, he was more than qualified to be promoted to an inner disciple.

In the Black Warrior Institute, before an outer disciple could be promoted to an inner disciple, they needed to meet two conditions; one, reach the God Realm in cultivation, and two, being placed within the top thirty in the outer disciple assessment.

Having decided, Huang Xiaolong exited the Institute Principal’s manor, once again heading toward the Supreme Harmony Hall to collect his inner disciple robe and identity token.

The journey was a short one.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong!”

Huang Xiaolong’s appearance in the Supreme Harmony Hall immediately caused a commotion among the disciples that came to pick up and report tasks. Their eyes zoomed onto Huang Xiaolong.

“Did this Huang Xiaolong really defeat Wang Biaoyuan with a single move? I heard that Wang Biaoyuan’s a late Second Order God Realm and those peak late-Second Order geniuses aren’t his opponents!”

Outer disciples that did not watch the assessment voiced their doubt and suspicion. Indeed, without witnessing the event with one’s own eyes, merely hearing about it by word of mouth, hardly anyone would believe. It wasn’t a secret that Huang Xiaolong was just a half-step God Realm three years ago.

“It’s most probably some exaggerated rumors, it is unbelievable enough he defeated Wang Biaoyuan, saying that he did it in one move is just too fake.”

Huang Xiaolong walked into the hall, ignoring all the noise around him. He went to the side hall in charge of distributing the inner disciple identity tokens and robes.

When the person in charge, Elder Su Fa, saw Huang Xiaolong, he was overly polite. After Huang Xiaolong returned the outer disciple identity token and robe, he personally handed Huang Xiaolong his new inner disciple identity token and robe. He even personally walked Huang Xiaolong out from the side hall.

In the entire history of the inner disciples, Huang Xiaolong was probably the only one to receive this level of courtesy.

After leaving the Supreme Harmony Hall, he did not immediately head to his own courtyard, but returned to the Institute Principal’s manor to inform his Master of this matter.

At first, Institute Principal Feng Yang disagreed to let Huang Xiaolong moving out. Even though Huang Xiaolong was promoted to inner disciple and had his own courtyard, the spiritual energy there couldn’t compare to his manor. He worried that it would have an adverse effect on Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation.

However, seeing that Huang Xiaolong had decided, Feng Yang no longer insisted.

“Fine then.” Institute Principal Feng Yang relented, “Still, you can come here anytime to practice. If you encounter any problems in cultivation, you can also come ask me at any time.”

A warm feeling spread over in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. To his knowledge, even the Eldest Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun, Second Senior-Apprentice brother and Third-Senior Apprentice-sister did not have the privilege to come over and ask their Master for guidance at any time, much less cultivate here.

“Yes, Master.” Huang Xiaolong respectfully complied.

Institute Principal Feng Yang’s mouth opened, wanting to say more, but in the end, he merely said, “Good, if there’s nothing else, you can go.”

Huang Xiaolong saluted properly and retreated out.

Leaving the manor, Huang Xiaolong made his way to the Misty Rain Mountain Range, where all the inner disciple’s courtyard were located.

The Misty Rain Mountain Range was on the northern corner of the Black Warrior World, a long distance away from the Central Region. Based on Huang Xiaolong’s full speed of flying, he used an entire day’s time to arrive at the mountain range.

Standing in the air and looking down from afar, one could see the peaks of the Misty Rain Mountain Range, which were shrouded with ethereal pillows of mist that looked like soft rain.

Orderly buildings lined the peaks of this Misty Rain Mountain Range, close to twenty or thirty thousand in number.

At first, Huang Xiaolong thought that the number of inner disciples would only be a few thousand despite the large number of outer disciples, but he found out that the number of Black Warrior Institute inner disciples was close to a staggering twenty thousand people. It was a few days ago, and it truly gave him a shock. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But he quickly figured it out, any one of the Black Warrior Institute’s outer disciples was a talent. Though it may be difficult for others to break through to God Realm, for them, the difficulty was much lower.

Moreover, once one broke into the God Realm, their natural lifespan increased exponentially, with years of accumulation, it was nothing strange that there would be twenty thousand inner disciples.

Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation courtyard was arranged on one of the higher peaks, where the spiritual energy was denser and ample. Thus, the cultivation courtyards located on the peaks were the most ideal.

Generally, the cultivation courtyards of newly promoted inner disciples would be arranged closer to the foothills, but Huang Xiaolong was placed on a peak. Other than him obtaining first place in the outer disciple assessment, he also dipped in the Institute Principal’s light, receiving some extra benefits.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong flew to one of the peaks, reaching it in a few breaths’ time. There were a dozen courtyards on the peak, and Huang Xiaolong found his quick enough.

“Yard No.1” Huang Xiaolong glanced toward a courtyard shrouded in dense spiritual energy and walked over. This was the courtyard arranged for him, but when he reached the door, a frown appeared on his brows.

Because he noticed that the array formation was activated, showing that there was already someone living inside.

What is happening?!

Did he make a mistake?

He looked up, above the main door. Written in three big ancient characters, it clearly stated that this was Yard No.1. Was his yard occupied by another? Moreover, that person was presumptuously cultivating inside!
