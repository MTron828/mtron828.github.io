Chapter 3606 – Think About It

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ying Ze who was no longer thinking straight and he decided to end it in a single punch. The moment his fist landed on Ying Ze’s chest, the world seemed to lose its color and everyone watching the battle felt the space freezing around them.

Boom!

Piercing straight through Ying Ze’s chest, Huang Xiaolong’s fist emerged from his back. Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun saw Ying Ze’s dao heart shooting through the skies. It emitted rays of light before exploding in mid air.

Bang!

When Ying Wan was killed previously, his golden blood rained down on the land as a shockwave powerful enough to shake the city swept through the lands. Ying Ze was a half step Universe God, and he was in a completely different league compared to Ying Wan! When his dao heart exploded, it was as though a giant meteor had crashed into the city.

The city shook violently and Lin Qiankun had no choice but to use his power to forcefully counteract the tremors. Chen Huanzhi assisted him and they managed to stop the quaking city. Even so, the Yin Yang City had nearly split into two. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Huang Xiaolong’s arm was still in Ying Ze’s chest, and everyone stared at him like he was some sort of monster. The scene was far too shocking, and even Lin Xian, the celestial emperor of a super faction nearly wet his pants. The marshals and generals who came with him felt the world slowly spinning around them.

Chen Huanzhi wanted to fly into a rage when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said earlier, but when he saw Ying Ze’s dao heart exploding in mid air, the anger he felt dissipated instantly. He was utterly stunned.

As a half step Universe God, Ying Ze’s body was terrifyingly strong. Even so, it was shattered with a single punch!

Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong with terror in his eyes, Ying Ze tried to circulate his grand cosmos energy but he was unable to. The great world he created felt completely frozen, and he was like a helpless baby before Huang Xiaolong.

“In my eyes, you’re no different from your son and grandson.” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Indeed. Killing a half step Universe God and a Dao Venerable posed the same level of difficulty to Huang Xiaolong. He could end their lives effortlessly.

After he spoke, Huang Xiaolong sliced Ying Ze’s head off. It rolled towards a patriarch of a great family in the Yin Yang City.

When the patriarch looked at Ying Ze’s severed head, the world went dark around him. A puddle of liquid formed under his legs.

Releasing a ray of universe origin fire, it appeared above Ying Ze’s severed head. Miserable cries shook the skies as Ying Ze’s hair was burnt off.

“This?!” Chen Huanzhi and the others frowned.

There wasn’t any type of flame that could harm a God of Creation when they reached such a high level.

However, the flame Huang Xiaolong summoned had the ability to slowly eat away at Ying Ze’s physical body! One could only imagine how strong it was!

It was no wonder Chen Huanzhi and the others would be frightened!

If the flames could devour Ying Ze’s body, it could also harm those present!

Under their terrified gaze, Ying Ze’s skull turned into a pile of dust.

The flame Huang Xiaolong summoned was the Vermillion Bird Fire and it was more than enough to deal with Ying Ze.

The four Origin Divine Fires were the strongest flames in the universe. They were the source of all flames that existed in the universes, and not even half step Universe Gods would be able to resist it.

Ying Ze’s dao soul emerged and it tried to escape.

With a swipe, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Ying Ze’s dao soul. He tossed it into the Sun Moon Furnace before incinerating his entire body.

The curved blade he summoned earlier along with his spatial artifacts appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

He didn’t bother scanning through every item in Ying Ze’s spatial artifact, but he turned to look at Lin Qiankun.

Fear bloomed in his heart when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s gaze.

“Your son should have informed you that I came all this way to make the trade with you. From the looks of it, you don’t intend to trade for a top-grade creation artifact. You planned to join hands with Ying Ze to kill me here…” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Lin Qiankun’s expression changed and he waved his hands hastily, “Lord Blue Dragon, there’s a misunderstanding! I am more than willing to make the trade, and Ying Ze’s attempt on your life was a huge mistake! I had nothing to do with it! In fact, Lord Chen Huanzhi and I didn’t plan to attack you at all!”

Chen Huanzhi nodded, “Fellow Cultivator Lin is right. We bear no ill intent.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered as he glanced at Lin Qiankun from the corner of his eye, “Do you think I’m delusional? Was it an illusion when you attacked me earlier with Ying Ze?”

Lin Qiankun’s face flushed red and he didn’t know how to respond.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong dragged Lin Qiankun over to himself.

“You should have seen Ying Ze’s end. Your eyes don't deceive you. That’s one of the four Universe Origin Fires, and the one I used was the Vermillion Bird Origin Fire.”

“It is widely accepted that God of Creation Realm experts are unkillable. Their dao souls were eternal, and their physical bodies were indestructible. However, that isn’t absolute. Would you like to have a taste of my flame?” Huang Xiaolong snorted. “If your physical body is exterminated by the flame, you will never be able to form another body!”

“I’ll give you two options.”

“One, you’ll drop all your defenses and I’ll brand your dao soul! In the future, you’ll be my subordinate.”

“The only other option is to end up like Ying Ze!”

Huang Xiaolong continued, “You better think this through.”

Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun stared at him in shock.

“We have already submitted to the Limitless Master! Our dao souls are branded by his restrictions!” Lin Qiankun hesitated.

Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be able to submit to two masters unless their soul brands were removed.

“That’s not your problem. All you have to do is to make a choice.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

When they heard what he said, they started to hesitate. If they chose to resist, they would end up like Ying Ze. If they chose to submit, they would betray the Limitless Master. Could Huang Xiaolong be strong enough to survive the wrath of the Limitless Master?”

“Relax. If you choose to submit, the Limitless Master won’t be able to detect the soul brand I lay down.” Huang Xiaolong explained. “I’m far stronger than you can ever imagine.”

?!

Chen Huanzhi and Lin Qiankun gasped in fright. Could the Blue Dragon Young Master be stronger than the Limitless Master?!
