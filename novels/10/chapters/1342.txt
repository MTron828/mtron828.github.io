"What? You all are unwilling?" Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow and asked coldly when he saw that the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders had taken a step backward.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er all locked onto the group of Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders.

The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders led by Zheng Guowen mumbled something unintelligibly. But none of them dared to run.

With the Second Order God King Realm void devil beast Xu Baisheng by Huang Xiaolong’s side, it was impossible for these Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders to escape. Even if they were to have the strength of peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, they would have been in a miserable situation.

"Zheng Guowen, you first!" Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze fell on Zheng Guowen.

Zheng Guowen shuddered, his complexion turned pallid at Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Huang Xiaolong showed indifference towards Zheng Guowen’s ashened face and continued, "Remember, each of you will have only one minute to consider. When this one minute is over, you can simply stop thinking forever!" Killing intent burst out from his body.

One minute!

The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders turned a shade paler if that was possible.

"Don’t look so nervous. If it comforts you, rest assured, my technique will control you, but it won’t affect your daily lives or cultivation. As long as you remain loyal to me, you are safe!" Huang Xiaolong added.

With that said, Huang Xiaolong gave Gui Yi a look, signalling him to start counting.

"Sixty!"

"Fifty-nine!"

......

"Thirty-two!"

"Thirty-one!"

Gui Yi’s voice rumbled ceaselessly in Zheng Guowen’s ears. Zheng Guowen felt like a hand was squeezing his heart tighter with every passing second. His face darkened as he clenched his fists. When Gui Yi counted six, he finally spoke, "Fine, I’m willing to open my soul’s protective barrier!"

Zheng Guowen’s shoulders slumped, seemingly saying those words had drained all of his energy.

In the end, he had chosen to submit to Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong nodded. As he ran the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, a stream of grandmist godforce flew out and transformed into a grandmist worm. It entered Zheng Guowen’s body through his chest. From there, the grandmist worm sped straight to Zheng Guowen’s godsea within his godhead, and merged with Zheng Guowen’s soul within his godsea.

Zheng Guowen felt a presence of something that was not part of his body inside his godsea. Other than that, there was nothing unusual. His thoughts and actions were not influenced or affected in any way. His anxiety lessened after checking upon his condition. This proved that Huang Xiaolong had not lied to them; they would be safe as long as they remain loyal to Huang Xiaolong.

"This is to reward you!" Huang Xiaolong said as a jade box appeared in his palm. With a gentle flick, the jade box landed softly on Zheng Guowen’s hands.

Zheng Guowen opened the jade box and his face flushed with joy when he saw the contents within the box. He exclaimed excitedly, "Blue Spectre Spring water!" Inside the jade box was the Blue Spectre Spring water.

"Thank you, Manor Lord!" Zheng Guowen respectfully expressed his gratitude.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, then his gaze shifted to Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elder Chen Zheng.

Chen Zheng also chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong. Following Zheng Guowen and Chen Zheng’s examples, coupled with some persuasion from both of them, more and more Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders chose to submit to Huang Xiaolong.

However, two Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders suddenly rushed at Huang Xiaolong with the intention of blowing up and pulling Huang Xiaolong to the depths of hell.

These two Grand Elders were Liang Luwen’s most trusted confidantes.

However, with the Second Order God King Realm void devil beast Xu Baisheng by Huang Xiaolong’s side, their plot was snuffed out along with their lives. They did explod to their deaths, but without being able to harm Huang Xiaolong.

Few other Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were also killed when they rushed to collect the Water Magic Fruit without Huang Xiaolong’s permission. In the end, thirty-five out of the forty-two Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders had submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

Thirty-five mid-level Ancestor God Realm masters! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, a few amongst them were peak late-Sixth Order Ancestor God Realm masters who could breakthrough to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm in the near future, including Zheng Guowen and Chen Zheng.

Even without Xu Baisheng, just these thirty-five people were enough to deter any super forces in the neighboring world surfaces.

"Let’s go!"

"First, we will head to the Reverence World!" Huang Xiaolong was in a good mood.He waved his hand as he sat on the little cow’s back and the little cow zoomed away.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, six chaos spiritual beast lackeys, and thirty-five Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders followed behind Huang Xiaolong with an overwhelming momentum.

As they flew towards the Reverence World, the little cow complained, “Really, comparing people to people, I feel frustrated to death. I have worked hard for so many years, but still, I have only six lackeys serving under me., Whereas, in a short span of a few hours, you have collected several dozen lackeys!”

She didn’t know if all of the chaos spiritual beasts had gone into hiding or not. But in the last one year, they had not come across any chaos spiritual beast, even once. The little cow had been feeling down about this for quite some time now.

Huang Xiaolong laughed hearing her complain, and teased, “Indeed, comparing people to people? But are you even a human? You’re a cow!”

The little cow was so shocked that she stopped flying and was rooted in the spot with her mouth agape.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er, were trying hard not to laugh.

The little cow looked over her shoulder and glared fiercely at the group of people behind them. Void devil beast Xu Baisheng and the rest quickly looked around as if they were on the lookout. Perhaps, there was a God King Realm devil on the horizon waiting to ambush them.

Huang Xiaolong laughed heartily at this sight.

As Huang Xiaolong’s group joked along the way, a swarm of black shadows suddenly pounced at them—a group of evil spirits! These evil spirits’ cumulative strength was between First Order to peak late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm. Just as Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er were about to deal with them, Huang Xiaolong stopped them. “No need!” His hands waved in the air, and his grandmist godforce surged, condensing twenty plus grandmist worms that merged into the evil spirits.

The evil spirits halted abruptly midway. In the next second, all of them flew towards Huang Xiaolong in an orderly manner until they were in front of him, and respectfully saluted, “Master!”

All of them were actually kneeling down in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone in Huang Xiaolong’s group, except the little cow, were astounded, and an obvious disbelief was written all over their faces.

Only the little cow was looking leisurely, as if there was nothing wrong with this scene. Based on Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, and also the grandmist worms, Huang Xiaolong was now able to control cultivators below the Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm with ease. In other words, using the grandmist worms, Huang Xiaolong would now be able to easily invade a person’s soul’s protective barrier and directly control them!

Regardless of whether that person was willing or not!

This was the terrifying aspect of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium!

Of course, for the people above the Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm like Zheng Guo Wen, Chen Zheng, and others, he required them to willingly open the barrier to their soul.

...

Several months passed.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s group was exiting the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

As they were exiting the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, there was a long train of a total thousand plus ghosts, evil spirits, and magic beasts behind Huang Xiaolong’s group! Over a thousand Ancestor God Realm masters! Most of them were at low-level Ancestor God Realm, while only a few possessed mid-level and high-level Ancestor God Realm strength. Nonetheless, this degree of power could destroy the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate, or super forces such as the Golden Phoenix Pavilion, and Yama Gates!

However, in order to avoid drawing too much attention, Huang Xiaolong sent all the ghosts, evil spirits, and magic beasts into the Xumi Temple.

Fear and fanatic gleam shone in the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders’ eyes, as they watched the ghosts, evil spirits, and magic beasts disappearing before their eyes.

Even Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er had similar expressions on their faces.

In the eyes of Xu Baisheng and the rest, that was heaven-defying! If Huang Xiaolong were to stay in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield for a few hundred years, or were to merely tour around, then...!

Everyone pictured an army of several hundred thousand Ancestor God Realm masters standing behind Huang Xiaolong, and goosebumps ran down their necks!

An army of several hundred thousand Ancestor God Realm masters, that would kill Gods and Buddhas if ever they dared to block their path! Even a Second Order God King Realm master like Xu Baisheng would be reduced to dregs!
