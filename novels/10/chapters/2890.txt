Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Die!

The Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable didn’t hold back as his killing intent threatened to burn the heavens.

He had never wished to kill anyone so much in his life, but at that moment, he wanted nothing more than to turn Huang Xiaolong into dust!

Die! Die! Die!

As his eyes turned blood red, only one thought remained in his mind. Huang Xiaolong had to die! He had to die a miserable death!

“Be careful!” Yu Yue, Feng Yue, and Yin Yue screamed in unison when they saw the mid-level Dao Venerable flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

Right before they could order those around them to save Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong made is move. With his figure blurring, he didn’t escape. Instead, he charged straight towards the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable.

Those present started at Huang Xiaolong with slack jaws.

“This… This… Don’t tell me Huang Xiaolong is really thinking of taking on Lord Bi Ye’s strike…” A Second Esteem Dao Venerable gasped in shock.

“He’s crazy! How can a Primal Ancestor think of fighting a mid-level Dao Venerable head on?! He’s basically asking to die…”

“If Huang Xiaolong plans on running away, Lord Bi Ye might not be able to stop him. Going straight towards a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable is the last thing he should do! Lord Bi Ye is going to turn him into human meat paste!”

Several experts sneered at Huang Xiaolong’s lack of awareness.

When the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable of the Xuanyuan Creed, Bi Ye, saw that Huang Xiaolong was planning to take him on, a sinister smile formed on his face. Initially, he was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would take the chance to run away! He didn’t think that the brat would be daring enough to counterattack! Brat, since you chose to die, you can’t blame anyone! I’ll be doing the heavens a favor by killing you right here and now!

Cosmos energy poured out from his body when he thought about how he was going to end the life of someone who would pose a threat to their Xuanyuan Creed in the future.

Lightning covered his fists, and blinding flashes pricked the dao souls of those present.

Huang Xiaolong’s pupils focused when he noticed the cosmos energy pouring out from Bi Ye’s body, and he summoned the cosmos energy produced by his first small world! With a punch of his own, he smashed it towards the incoming energy from Bi Ye.

After six rounds of tempering, Huang Xiaolong had no idea how strong he actually was. Bi Ye had come at a perfect time as he could test out his strength on this mid-level Dao Venerable.

Boom!

A heaven-shattering blast rang through the Monarch Yu Sacred Land, and those situated in other sacred lands around could hear the explosion clearly.

Everyone in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land heard a buzzing sound in their minds, and their sense of hearing became completely useless. There was only the terrifyingly loud blast left between the heavens.

Primal Ancestors, who were closer to the battlefield, felt like their dao souls were about to tear apart and swathes of land around the Monarch Yu Sacred Land started to crumble.

The shockwaves of the collision could be felt throughout the entire area.

Even at their level, the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World took several steps back as they turned slightly pale from the impact.

There was only a single thought in the minds of those present. They had to escape!

The destructive energy raged through the lands, and those who ran away from the scene of the battle felt cold sweat dripping down their backs.

When they finally felt that it was safe enough to turn around, they saw Huang Xiaolong floating in the air alone. Bi Ye, the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable of the Xuanyuan Creed was nowhere to be seen.

“Where… Where is Lord Bi Ye?!” someone asked.

Someone finally spotted him after looking around.

“There! Look over there!”

When they turned to stare at one of the shattered ruins, they could make out a sorry figure whose body couldn’t even be considered a proper human’s body.

Looking closely, they saw that he was Bi Ye, the exalted Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable of the Xuanyuan Creed!

No one could believe what they were looking at.

Everyone had expected for Huang Xiaolong to be on the losing end, and they were waiting to see him fly out of the Monarch Yu Sacred Land. No one would have thought that Bi Ye would be on the losing end, instead.

Xuanyuan Potian, who was still spitting out mouthfuls of golden blood, stared at the scene before him as the blood drained from his face.

As for Yang Jia, and those who finally crawled out of the ground, they stared at each other as their bodies froze.

Feng Yue stared at Bi Yet, who was still out cold, and her devastatingly pretty face revealed an incredulous expression, “How… How… He… What?!”

Yin Yue and Yu Yue stared at Huang Xiaolong like they were looking at an absolute monster. They couldn’t comprehend how a Primal Ancestor was so strong!

Bi Ye was a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable from the Xuanyuan Creed!

The person who had sent him down to eat dust was Huang Xiaolong, a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

There were at least six realms between the two of them, not counting the major jump from Primal Ancestor to Dao Venerable!

The Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable beside Feng Yue, Elder Tong, was equally as shocked.

“This… Is this real life?” one of the Dao Venerables hiding in the void muttered to himself.

“After this battle, Huang Xiaolong will become the number-one genius in the younger generation!”

No one could contain their emotions when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

No one stepped out to doubt the statement any longer.

“No… He will be the number-one person in our Huang Long World!” The voice of a Dao Venerable trembled when he spoke of his conjecture.

Number-one person in the Huang Long World!

He would surpass the Son of Creation, Huang Shuai!

While everyone was in a state of shock, Bi Ye crawled out from the rubble. He stared at Huang Xiaolong like he was looking at the most terrifying existence he had seen in his life.

“You… How can you be so strong?!”

That was a question that was on everyone’s mind.

No one knew how a Primal Ancestor could possess such terrifying combat prowess.

“Who in the world are you?”

That was the other question everyone had on their minds. Looking at the abilities he had displayed, his talent had already surpassed the Son of Creation, Huang Shuai!

No one understood how that was possible. How could his talent be even better than the son of the God of Creation?

Huang Xiaolong replied with a calm expression, “You can relax. I’m not the young master of some hidden superpower. I’m just a nobody from a tiny holy world…”

He knew that everyone was curious about his identity, and he wasn’t planning on hiding it.

“Another holy world?!” Everyone looked at each other, and the shock they felt in their hearts multiplied.

Bi Ye’s heart loosened when he heard that Huang Xiaolong was from another holy world.

His talent might be great, but the thing truly holding Bi Ye and the others back was Huang Xiaolong’s identity. The Xuanyuan Creed might have been one of the largest powers in the Divine Tuo Holy World, but they weren’t the strongest! There was the Mystical Pavilion, Holy Dragon Race, Heavenly Phoenix Race, and several other powers stronger than them.

As long as he wasn’t related to any of them, there was nothing the Xuanyuan Creed had to fear.

All of a sudden, Huang Xiaolong started walking towards Xuanyuan Potian.

The expressions of those from the Xuanyuan Creed changed instantly.

“Activate the Xuanyuan Chariot right now! Protect His Highness!” Bi Ye screamed, and he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong once again.

The other three Dao Venerables didn’t hesitate as they joined the offensive.

Everyone else got ready to leave on the Xuanyuan Chariot after grabbing Xuanyuan Potian.

Looking at the four of them, Huang Xiaolong snorted slightly, and he activated all three dao souls. High-order Saint Fates started to appear one after another.

In the end, Huang Xiaolong decided against showing his twelfth Saint Fate.

Even so, his three dao souls and eleven high-order Saint Fates were enough to shock everyone present.

“Three… Three dao souls!”

“Eleven high-order Saint Fates!”

Everyone felt blinded by the radiance that came from the eleven high-order Saint Fates, and their world turned dark. The dao souls and the Saint Fates were the only things left in their sights.

“Eleven high-grade Saint Fates… There really is someone with eleven high-order Saint Fates in this world!” Feng Yue, Yu Yue, and Yin Yue stared at Huang Xiaolong in amazement.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong had shown off his horrifying combat abilities, but he hadn’t revealed his Saint Fates. No one could confirm if he really had eleven of them!

However, the truth was revealed when Huang Xiaolong summoned eleven high-grade Saint Fates before them!

The instant they appeared, Huang Xiaolong punched out with a single fist. With one punch, Bi Ye and the other three Dao Venerables from the Xuanyuan Creed were sent flying.
