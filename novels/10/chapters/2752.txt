Chapter 2753: Surrendered

Tang Long’s, Han Mo’s, and Chu Yifan’s dao soul stared at Huang Xiaolong with horror. All ninety-two Primal Ancestors were actually…. by a True Saint Realm?!!

Is he a True Saint or a Dao Venerable?!!

“You, you’re a Dao Venerable?!” Tang Long’s quivering voice sounded.

He even suspected that Huang Xiaolong was not merely a Dao Venerable.

Dao Venerable?! Han Mo, Chu Yifan, and all the present experts trembled and all their gazes flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Dao Venerable?” Huang Xiaolong scoffed. He couldn’t be bothered with any explanation. Even if he said that he was still a Ninth Heaven True Saint, Tang Long, Han Mo, and the rest of these people wouldn’t believe that he was telling the truth.

Luckily, he had the Cangqiong Blade and Flying Heaven Spear. Or else, it would have been hard to destroy the bodies of Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor experts like Tang Long by merely relying on his own two fists.

Since Huang Xiaolong remained silent, Tang Long thought that he was really a Dao Venerable, and thus, he pleaded in haste, “Lord Dao Venerable, please spare us. We didn’t know that you’re Lord Dao Venerable. We’re willing to offer our sacred lands’ treasuries in the hope that you will spare our lives.”

True Saint Realm experts were said to be indestructible because their holy souls couldn’t be extinguished easily. This was also the reason, they did not enter the reincarnation cycle after their body was destroyed. However, a Primal Ancestor’s grand dao law power could snub a True Saint Realm’s holy soul.

Whereas, Primal Ancestor experts, with dao souls and inextinguishable dao hearts, could be considered as eternal and unageing, and they did not deteriorate. But, there was an exception to this, and it was a Dao Venerable!

A Dao Venerable could kill a Primal Ancestor at any time!

A Primal Ancestor was eternal due to the natural law of a world, but a Dao Venerable had their own small world, and inside that small world, a Dao Venerable was the supreme sovereign who could overrule the God of Creation’s rules, allowing them to kill a Primal Ancestor!

Huang Xiaolong had his own small world. However, Huang Xiaolong’s small world hadn’t formed too long ago. Thus, it was a little unstable. Once Huang Xiaolong entered Primal Ancestor Realm, his small world would expand and give birth to the small world’s own grand dao laws. When that happened, he would be able to kill a Primal Ancestor expert, and devour their dao soul and inextinguishable dao heart.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the pleading Tang Long and replied placidly, “Your sacred lands’ treasuries are mine just the same after killing you three. It’s too late to be begging for your lives at this point!”

Too late!

Huang Xiaolong’s words struck hard like a hammer in the three sacred lands’ experts hearts.

Without waiting for Tang Long to say another word, Huang Xiaolong threw his dao soul into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Han Mo and Chu Yifan ashened. Clearly, Huang Xiaolong had given Tang Long the death punishment.

Chu Yifan was hit by an overwhelming wave of regret at this moment, and he regretted listening to Tang Long’s words to join hands against Huang Xiaolong. His heart gave birth to a burning resentment towards Tang Long for talking him into besieging Huang Xiaolong.

“Tang Long you scum!” Chu Yifan roared out with resentment and unwillingness.

Huang Xiaolong treated Han Mo and Chu Yifan’s dao soul in the same manner and suppressed them inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace. Then he looked at the three sacred lands’ Primal Ancestors, and those who had joined in at the last minute.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had destroyed Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan’s dao physiques, he merely injured the rest of the three sacred lands’ experts and the twenty-plus Primal Ancestors instead of destroying their dao physiques.

When the remaining Primal Ancestors noticed Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, their faces ashened, and they retreated in panic. Inwardly, the thought of fleeing crossed their minds multiple times in a short few seconds.

“I advise you all not to have any thoughts of fleeing,” Huang Xiaolong’s sharp voice echoed loudly.

“Or else, Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan’s ending would be yours! Moreover, you won’t be able to leave even if you want to!”

The Primal Ancestors, who were intending to make a run for it, turned bloodlessly pale.

The three sacred lands’ four thousand plus True Saints were also as pale as corpses.

Even Zhu Xu and the other experts in the distance, who hadn’t joined in the siege, felt immense pressure.

Moreover, Cangqiong Sacred Land’s grand formation was still up, and they couldn't flee even if they wanted to… Did that mean that even they wouldn’t be able to live through today?

The force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm dragged Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the others, fallen in a corner, in front of him. When Tang Long, Han Mo, and the others had besieged him, this group of people had been hiding in a corner and watching with gloating expressions.

Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the other three worshiped experts huddled weakly together on the ground, looking fearfully at Huang Xiaolong, trembling from head to toe. Their lips quivered, yet they failed to utter a sound.

Even a peak late-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor like Tang Long had his dao physique destroyed by Huang Xiaolong, then what was more to weaker people like them. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As he looked at the trembling bodies on the ground, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to speak another word. He directly sealed their strengths, and then threw all five of them into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Although Primal Ancestor’s grand dao energy and grand dao laws were mostly concentrated within their dao souls, their dao physiques also contained some of both. This was why Huang Xiaolong kept Cheng Yueyang’s group intact. They would be of better use for him for refining pills, or serving other purpose in the future.

At this time, Duan Feng, Mo Zhi, Long Jinafei, Fei Yanzi, Cangqiong Old Man and the others arrived by Huang Xiaolong’s side. Huang Xiaolong nodded at Duan Feng, and he immediately understood his meaning. He respectfully complied.

“Everyone, our Young Lord is giving all of you five minutes to think. You can either choose to yield to our Young Lord, or end up like Tang Long’s group and have your physiques destroyed.” Duan Feng said as his indifferent gaze swept over the three sacred lands’ Primal Ancestors.

The three sacred lands’ Primal Ancestors’ faces tightened as hesitation flickered back and forth on their faces.

“Of course, everyone can choose to flee,” Duan Feng stated coldly.

Faces turned ugly at that sentence.

Flee? Even Tang Long couldn’t withstand Huang Xiaolong’s one strike, then would they even be able to run away?

What was the difference between this option and the second option?

“Honestly speaking, Ice Blue Sacred Land’s Patriarch Hou Ting, and the remaining experts, have already submitted to our Young Lord,” Duan Feng added.

“What?! The Ice Blue Sacred Land has submitted to Huang Xiaolong?!”

Everyone was shocked.

Had Duan Feng said something like this before, no one would believe him, but now, nine out of ten people did.

“Ice Blue Sacred Land’s He Ba, and Cheng Changwang offended the Young Lord, so their endings were the same as Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan. Their dao physiques were destroyed on the spot,” Duan Feng added more details.

“What?!”

Duan Feng’s words were like water dropping into hot oil, and the crowd was aghast.

“Master, do you think Huang Xiaolong would do the same to us…?” Ren Yifei was shaking a little. At this point, he really wanted to give himself a good slap. Why the heck did I follow the three sacred lands’ armies over to watch a good show. Look now, I can’t leave even if I want to.

Zhu Xu sighed, but didn’t say anything.

It seemed like time was passing in slow motion.

In the seemingly long wait, one minute passed by…

Then, Duan Feng began counting down by the seconds.

“Fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty-seven, ... thirty!” As the deadline pressured them, their heartbeats raced, and finally, when Duan Feng counted ten, an expert stepped out and shouted loudly, “I’m willing to recognize Huang Xiaolong as my lord and serve him!”

This was a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert, but he did not belong to any of the three sacred lands. He was one of those who had joined under Tang Long’s persuasion.

“Nine!” Duan Feng continued with indifference.

When ‘nine’ sounded, several more people walked out, claiming they were willing to serve Huang Xiaolong.

“Eight!”

Several more people walked out.

“Seven!”

“Six!”

The further down the countdown went, the more people walked out. By the time Duan Feng counted till two, the number of Primal Ancestor had exceeded seventy.
