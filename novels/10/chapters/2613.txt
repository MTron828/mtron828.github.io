Chapter 2614: Too Weak!

“Senior Brother Changyao is the strongest!”

The disciples of the Myriad Origin Race screamed.

As for Yuan Yue, he went a step further. “Senior Brother Changyao, cripple that dog b*stard! Make him yelp in pain!”

The members of the Twin Dragon Race and the Golden Buddha Race soon joined in.

According to Yuan Yue and the others, Yuan Changyao was only injured because of Huang Xiaolong’s sneak attack. Like what Yuan Changyao said, how could a Second Heaven True Saint like Huang Xiaolong injure him?

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re a loser! How dare you make a sneak attack in a competition? Get out of the Otherworldly Mansion!”

“That’s right! You lowly b*stard! F*ck off!”

Several disciples screamed in the crowd. In an instant, Huang Xiaolong turned into a shameless sore loser.

Feitian Longpeng stared at the disciples in disgust as he spat, “The disciples of the three races sure are disgusting…”

Feng Tianwei chuckled in response, “These losers only dare to pick on those weaker than them…”

As for Feng Jiu, she stared at Yuan Changyao’s high-order Saint Fate and his godhead as questionable thoughts ran through her mind.

On the podium, a trace of relief washed over Yuan Wangfeng’s heart when he looked at Yuan Changyao’s display of talent. “This kid is definitely going to surpass me in the future! He will become a Primal Ancestor of the race!”

“Lord Wangfeng, congratulations!” Jin Kang responded immediately, “Changyao’s talent overshadows nearly everyone in the Alien Lands! If Changyao doesn’t become a Primal Ancestor in the future, no one will be able to ascend to the Primal Ancestor Realm!”

Yuan Zongyuan chuckled happily, “This is Changyao’s true strength! Huang Xiaolong is no match for him!”

…

As praises of him rang outside the arena, Yuan Changyao stared at Huang Xiaolong coldly, and he snorted, “Now, you shall face my wrath! I won’t stop till you’re dead!”

Raising his arms, he seemed to support the heavens with his strong, muscular arms.

A terrifying river of light emerged from the void, and it slowly descended on the lands, shaking the earth below.

“The origin energy of the world!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“This is the energy from the world’s core!”

Everyone broke out into cheers when they realized that a human wouldn’t be the victor of the battle.

The move shown by Yuan Changyao was how terrifying the members of the Myriad Origin Race actually were. Even if they hadn’t entered the Primal Ancestor Realm, they would be able to call on the source energy of the world when fighting against their enemies.

Everyone knew that Primal Ancestors were the only ones who could borrow the strength of the world when using their Inextinguishable Dao Heart. However, the members of the Myriad Origin Race broke that rule!

“Die!” Yuan Changyao screamed as he pushed the river of light towards Hung Xiaolong.

Roaring waves surged as they shot towards Huang Xiaolong with the intention of swallowing him whole. Since the space covered by the formation was limited, there was nowhere for Huang Xiaolong to hide.

The disciples, who were outside the arena, couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva in shock.

“That’s a little too strong…” Feitian Longpeng’s expression turned serious as he evaluated the attack. “Even Eighth Heaven True Saints won’t be able to take this attack head-on!”

“There’s no way Huang Xiaolong can receive the attack!” Feng Tianwei shook his head silently. “Even I won’t be able to handle the attack!” Even with his cultivation base at the peak of the early-Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm, he knew that he would be seriously injured if he had to take the attack head-on.

Yin Zhangguo’s expression changed when he stared at the arena. It was too bad the arena was covered by the restriction, and he couldn’t do a thing to save Huang Xiaolong.

Boom!

The terrifying river of light slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Yuan Yue cheered when he saw what had happened. “Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would die a dog’s death!”

Yuan Wangfeng, Yuan Zongyuan, and others revealed a sinister smile on their faces when they noticed what had happened. It was like they had struck the lottery after buying a single ticket, and they barely managed to stop themselves from laughing out loud!

Feitian Longpeng shook his head and sighed, “It seems like Huang Xiaolong couldn’t win…”

Feng Jiu frowned when she thought about how she had evaluated Huang Xiaolong’s talent a moment ago. Didn’t she say that he was comparable to Yuan Qianxing?

Long Chen turned to Feng Jiu and started laughing, “Junior Sister Feng Jiu, is this the person whose talent can rival Yuan Qianxing? What a joke!”

Jin Xing roared with laughter too, “What an absolute disaster! Didn’t he say that he would kill Brother Changyao a moment ago? Oh right. Brother Changyao killed him like how he would kill a cockroach! Hahaha!”

The energy slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s body as blinding rays of light filled the plaza.

By the time the light dissipated and everyone managed to observe the situation in the arena again, their jaws dropped in fright. Huang Xiaolong stood there as though nothing had happened to him. Despite being hit by such a strong attack, he didn’t even take a step back in retreat! The clothes he wore weren't even ruffled in the slightest!

Yuan Changyao’s expression sank.

Long Chen, Jin Xing, and the other disciples couldn’t believe their eyes.

“Energy from the origin of the world? Too d*mn weak! Is this how you planned on killing me?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “You’re too much of a disappointment.”

Too weak!

The expression on the faces of everyone present became extremely colorful when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s evaluation of Yuan Changyao’s strength.

Feng Jiu, Feitian Longpeng, and those who were slightly hopeful for Huang Xiaolong to win felt waves battering their hearts.

As for Yuan Wangfeng, Yuan Zongyuan, and the other administrators, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of fear rippling through their hearts.

This…

Chen Muguang and the members of the Chen Luo Sect felt their brains turning to mush when they saw how Huang Xiaolong had defended against that attack.

“The Young Patriarch of the Purple Spider Race is too strong!” one of the experts exclaimed.

“Yuan Qianxing… Who cares about Yuan Qianxing when we have Huang Xiaolong?!”

Walking towards Yuan Changyao, Huang Xiaolong faced the crazed attack of his opponent. However, Yuan Changyao couldn’t do a thing to Huang Xiaolong no matter how hard he tried.

Finally arriving beside Yuan Changyao, Huang Xiaolong reached out to grab him by the neck.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you think you’re doing?!” Yuan Wangfeng screamed as he watched the scene playing out in the arena. “Release him at once!”

Hastily deactivating the formation on the arena, Yuan Zongyuan wanted to tear Huang Xiaolong into pieces. However, he hadn’t even moved when Hei Luo sent him flying out of the city with a single slap.

“What?!” Everyone’s expression changed as they turned to stare at Hei Luo.

Yuan Zongyuan was a vice hall master of the Otherworldly Mansion! No one had thought that Huang Xiaolong’s bodyguard would be able to defeat him with a single strike!

“How dare you?!” Yuan Wangfeng stood up from his seat, and he roared in rage, “Huang Xiaolong, this is the Otherworldly Mansion! How dare you go against our rules?! You deserve death!”

“Guardians of the Mansion, take him down!”

Several dozen figures shot out from the void as soon as he spoke.

“Guardians of the Mansion!”

No one knew how many people were part of the group, but they knew that anyone who could become a guardian was an existence at the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm! There were even rumors going around that they could suppress a Primal Ancestor with the help of the Primal Ancestor Grand Formation of the mansion!

As soon as they appeared, they surrounded Hei Luo. Pillars of light emerged from the Otherworldly Mansion as a mysterious diagram was formed in the skies. In the next moment, a barrier formed around Hei Luo.
