Chapter 2449: Black Serpent Rope

Upon seeing that their side was gaining the upper hand, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s experts were over the moon.

Shen Jiewen was grinning from ear to ear contentedly.

Once Huang Xiaolong was enveloped by the light of destiny from Sui Yunfeng’s Life Reversing Saint Godhead, it was almost impossible for him to turn the tide anymore. Currently, the light of destiny had filled the entire battle stage space, and under this light of destiny, Huang Xiaolong had no route of escape.

As time passes, Huang Xiaolong’s vitality would seep away faster, so would his strength, and at one point, any First Tribulation half-True Saint’s pinky could even end his life.

It could be said with certainty that Huang Xiaolong had already lost.

Li Chen’s brows furrowed deeper as he watched on.

It was good that there was someone who could defeat Huang Xiaolong, but at the same time, Li Chen was unwilling to watch that grandmist holy spiritual aura ending up in the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s hands.

Xie Bufan, Duan Xuan, Zhan Zhiyuan, and others, had their own schemings.

“Haha! Huang Xiaolong, you underestimate your enemy too much. Now that you’re enveloped by my light of destiny, you’ve already lost!” Sui Yunfeng crackled, “I hadn’t expected to defeat you so easily, and here I was, thinking that I might have to use my biggest trump card to deal with you. But it seems like I had thought too highly of you.”

Then came Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent voice, “Lose? Not necessarily.”

As he stood on the stage, Huang Xiaolong allowed the light of destiny wash over his entire body, and he let it enter his body, into his internal organs, and his three complete dao saint godheads.

Huang Xiaolong was focused on studying the laws within the light of destiny, and the principles of its power.

Suddenly, comprehension dawned on him.

It was a kind of comprehension towards destiny.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong had purposely let the light of destiny envelope him. Otherwise, with his strength, how could Sui Yunfeng possibly succeed?

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong was choosing to be stubborn despite his rapidly decreasing vitality, Sui Yunfeng laughed wantonly, “Huang Xiaolong, do you still think you can win in this situation?”

The crowd below the stage also shook their heads, as all of them had the same thought that Huang Xiaolong was still holding up for reputation’s sake even when he was at death’s door.

Yes, Huang Xiaolong indeed had two complete dao saint godheads, but at this moment, it was useless even if he had two complete dao saint godheads, his entire body’s vitality was decreasing at a rapid speed, and there was no chance of a comeback.

“Grand Hall Master, if this continues, His Highness Huang Xiaolong would really lose his life.” The Law Enforcement Hall Master Shi Feng couldn’t help whispering to Wu Ge again.

Wu Ge shook his head, and let out a heavy sigh, but did not say a word.

After watching Huang Xiaolong’s body wither away by the second, and growing increasingly weaker, many people felt it was a pity.

But there were some people who thought that there was something different about this situation because Huang Xiaolong had not at all resisted from the beginning.

When Huang Xiaolong had withered to the point of being a dried twig, and he was barely hung by a thread of vitality, a bright light suddenly burst out from his body, and soared towards the sky.

Waves of dragon qi roared and reverberated.

This holy light, and this dragon qi, was very overwhelming and soul-jarring!

Boom!

It was as if the entire Holy World was thrown off its axis.

The Holy Mandate Imprint between Huang Xiaolong’s brows emitted blinding rays of light, illuminating the world as Holy World’s origin energy fell from the void like a great waterfall into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Holy World’s origin energy arrived like endless galloping waves, rumbling in everyone’s ears. These noises actually penetrated out from the light of destiny that enveloped Huang Xiaolong, booming away the light of destiny.

Sui Yunfeng staggered back awkwardly from the opposing energy, and his Life Reversing Saint Godhead was humming loudly in the air.

“This, what’s going on? What happened?!” Some experts asked out loudly.

The sudden and unexpected change seemed incredulous to the crowd.

Huang Xiaolong’s withered body recovered swiftly, like a balloon pumped with air, returning to his original form in a split second. The withered body they had seen previously was almost an illusion.

It was as if Huang Xiaolong had not been affected by the light of destiny moments ago.

“This, why is it like this? How is this possible!”

Sui Yunfeng watched Huang Xiaolong’s shocking changes, screaming hysterically like a madman.

Below the battle stage, Xie Bufan, Dou Rui, Li Chen, Xie Yao, Wu Ge, Shen Jiewen, and others were all greatly shocked.

“...This, Senior Brother Bufan, what’s going on?” Dou Rui asked Xie Bufan in astonishment.

The look in Xie Bufan’s eyes grew solemn as he spoke, “We still underestimated Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong’s two complete dao saint godhead have most likely advanced to a shocking level, and both of them definitely rank higher than in the top fifty!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Dou Rui’s expression changed greatly, and he almost hollered out aloud, “You’re saying that both of Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads have already improved to be in the top forty ranks? Maybe even the top thirty?!”

That’s beyond frightening!

Earlier, when Huang Xiaolong had admitted that his complete dao saint godheads had entered the top fifty ranks, everyone was already shocked. However, if his complete dao saint godheads had entered the top thirty...? Then...?!

There was a complicated expression on Xie Bufan’s face, “Even if his complete dao saint godheads have not entered the top thirty, they won’t be far below! He could completely suppress the Life Reversing Saint Godhead’s effects and break out from the light of destiny only because of his two complete dao saint godheads’ synergized power, which is further enhanced by the Holy Mandate Imprint!”

Xie Bufan did not block the sound of his conversation with Dou Rui. Hence the content of their conversation was clearly heard by others, and the words shook their hearts. Their eyes widened as their gazes fell on Huang Xiaolong once again.

Improved into the top thirty?!

It hasn’t been six decades since Huang Xiaolong entered the Holy Heavens, yet his complete dao saint godheads have already evolved into the top thirty ranks?

Lin Xiaoying, Tan Juan, and Ji Xinyi’s cherry mouths were agape in astonishment.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong reached out and slapped with his palm. The palm force was akin to a great chaos five-fingered mountain that knocked Sui Yunfeng into the battle stage.

The battle stage quaked violently, threatening to crumble.

All around was heavy silence.

The crowd was once again shocked by this sight.

Xie Yao, who had always been at loggerheads with Huang Xiaolong, felt a force thump at his heart at the same time Sui Yunfeng was knocked into the battle stage.

Li Chen paled slightly. Huang Xiaolong won?

Even Sui Yunfeng, who possesses the Life Reversing Saint Godhead was no match against one move from Huang Xiaolong!

Then, who could defeat Huang Xiaolong?

Li Chen’s gaze shifted to Gu Xuanxu, whom he had recruited. Although Gu Xuanxu’s origins were mysterious, and he was highly talented, he was still a little lacking compared to Sui Yunfeng.

If Sui Yunfeng had failed to defeat Huang Xiaolong, wouldn’t Gu Xuanxu get the same result?

After remembering that he might have to lick the bottom of Huang Xiaolong’s shoes in public, Li Chen had an impulse to run away from this place.

A suction force from Huang Xiaolong’s palm pulled Sui Yunfeng out from the pit, and just as everyone thought he won’t be able to escape from the tragic end of being devoured by Huang Xiaolong, Sui Yunfeng suddenly opened his mouth and a streak of light flew out. It was so fast that no one reacted, including Huang Xiaolong.

In the next moment, the crowd saw the streak of light winding around Huang Xiaolong’s body, tightly restraining him.

Only then did everyone make out what that streak of light really was. It was a rope of black scales, and its surface was filled with dense devilish runes that were linked together into a trap formation.

“Black Serpent Rope!” Upon seeing this rope, Wu Ge’s face darkened as he exclaimed.

Rumor had it that when the Holy World had come into existence, the core of the Holy World had given birth to a black serpent, and this Black Serpent Rope was made from that serpent’s black scales. It went without saying that the Black Serpent Rope was powerful, and it was claimed to be able to restrain everything. Although it was not a dao artifact, it was comparable to a dao artifact.

The Beast Tamer Holy Gate was in possession of the Black Serpent Rope? And Shen Jiewen was willing to let Sui Yunfeng use it on the battle stage?!
