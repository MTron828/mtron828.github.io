Chapter 3548: Where Did They Go?!

 

Laid down formations?!

Ao Ying and the others jumped in fright when they heard what he said. Instinctively, they tried to retreat. However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t going to let them do as they wished. Activating his formations, rays of light shot into the space around them to form a giant bubble. The experts of the Creation Palace were trapped instantly.

Not even those who left to guard the area were let off.

Sending out a punch, it crashed into the light barrier that surrounded them. It trembled slightly, but it remained completely undamaged.

As Ao Ying’s expression slowly sank, celestial bodies started appearing all around the formation. Heavenly lightning gathered around the great stars and streaks of purple lightning filled the area. They struck Duan Jun relentlessly, and his skin was charred black instantly.

The experts from the Creation Palace sucked in a cold breath.

“This is the Sun Moon Purple Lightning Grand Formation,” Huang Xiaolong explained. “My Sun Moon Furnace and Purple Lightning Peak make up the core of the formation. If you wish to destroy the formation, you’ll have to snatch the treasures away from me. Oh right. Ao Ying, your son, Ao Yan, was coincidentally suppressed by the exact same formation in the past.”

“I was right! They were in your hands!” Ao Ying released his dao souls to surround the space they were in, and he growled, “You can summon all the experts you brought with you now!” 

Zhu Yaowen and the others did the same. In their eyes, Huang Xiaolong only dared to trap them in his grand formation after enlisting the help of various experts.

A snort left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Ao Ying, didn’t I tell you that I alone am enough?”

Confusion filled the minds of the experts of the Creation Palace. They had no idea what Huang Xiaolong was plotting now. He was a God of Creation at the small completion stage, and they were experts at the peak of the grand completion stage! Was he really planning to take them all on with the help of a single formation?!

That was absolutely absurd!

When they were still questioning Huang Xiaolong’s sanity, a terrifying wave of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Huang Xiaolong circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art at the same time. A total of 10.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy rampaged throughout the area covered by the grand formation.

Boom!

Ao Ying and the rest were sent flying by the sheer revelation of his strength.

Crashing into the edge of the deserted world, the experts of the Creation Palace flattened countless mountain ranges.

Huang Xiaolong no longer played around, and he appeared in front of them in an instant. His fists landed on Ao Ying and Zhu Yaowen, and their chests were blasted apart.

Their divine armors were in tatters as Huang Xiaolong’s punch pierced straight through their dao hearts.

Even though Huang Xiaolong wasn’t actually a half-step Universe God, the grand cosmos energy he had was much higher than they would possess! How could people like Ao Ying and Zhu Yaowen resist his strike?

One had to know that a half-step Universe God would only possess 9.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Huang Xiaolong stood in the air as he stared at them coldly.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“You… You… You have three great worlds!” Yang Gang spat out a mouthful of dirt as he cried out in shock.

Three great worlds!

He had more than 10 billion units of grand cosmos energy! How was he a weakling in the small completion stage?! The intelligence reports f*cked up big time!

The experts of the Creation Palace stared at Huang Xiaolong as though he was a monster.

As for Duan Jun, his legs went soft the moment Huang Xiaolong released his aura. 

“Lord… Lord Huang, please spare my life!” Duan Jun pleaded.

“Spare your life?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow slowly after dragging Duan Jun over.

Too flustered to speak, Duan Jun could only nod profusely.

“There’s no need to worry. I told you that I’ll release you as long as your master agrees to hand over thirty universe-level spiritual veins.” 

Thirty high-grade universe-level spiritual veins, three times the price of his initial release! There was no way the Creation Palace would agree to the terms! After all, they didn’t have so many, to begin with!

Huang Xiaolong sealed off Duan Jun’s grand cosmos energy before suppressing him in the Sun Moon Furnace.

By the time he was done, Ao Ying and Zhu Yaowen had crawled out of whatever hole Huang Xiaolong had sent them into earlier. Fear filled their eyes, and the hatred that once clouded them was long gone.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards them slowly.

“Lord… Lord Huang Xiaolong, we didn’t mean to offend you. After all, our Creation Palace held no grudge against you. Please do not misunderstand,” Zhu Yaowen stammered.

“Misunderstand? You planned to hunt me down the moment I left the Solitary Alliance. Did I misinterpret your intentions?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

Zhu Yaowen wanted to come up with even more excuses, but he swallowed his words when he saw the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Ao Ying and the others were equally as shocked.

“Star Dragon Divine Tree?!” 

It was no wonder Huang Xiaolong could bring out so many pieces of Star Dragon Scales. With the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Star Dragon Scales were nothing more than cabbages at the side of the street!

Huang Xiaolong fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree and swung countless roots at the experts of the Creation Palace. All of them were sent flying in an instant.

With his current strength, he could deal with them without the Star Dragon Divine Tree. However, the experts of the Hundred Empire Alliance and other scattered experts were waiting right outside! He had to deal with them as soon as possible.

In the space outside the deserted star, the experts of the other factions were stopped by the grand formation, and they couldn’t enter no matter how hard they tried. Doubts filled their minds.

“What’s the meaning of this?! Why did Huang Xiaolong lay down a grand formation here? Did the Eternal Heaven Alliance station a group of experts here?” Chen Fenli, a God of Creation at the grand completion stage from the Hundred Empire Alliance guessed.

“That’s probably what happened! Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t come alone! No one would be so stupid to deliver themselves straight into a trap! I was right! The Eternal Heaven Alliance laid down a massive ambush here!” someone else said.

Discussion filled the air.

“Should we destroy the grand formation?” 

“Don’t be stupid. We’ll wait for them to fight it out before swooping in to grab Huang Xiaolong.”

When everyone was thinking of what they should do, the barrier of light disappeared. A figure strolled out casually, and everyone was shocked to discover who it was.

Huang Xiaolong was the only one present and the experts of the Creation Palace were nowhere to be seen!

“Huang Xiaolong, where are Ao Ying and the others?!” 

“What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong sighed before looking at the experts standing around. “Are all of you here to obtain the Star Dragon Scales and universe-level spiritual veins I have on me?”
