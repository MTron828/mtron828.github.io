Chapter 3400: Meeting Corpse King Ying Gou

“Corpse King Ying Gou?!” Sun Wukong’s face changed instantly.

Even though he was terrified of the Holy Phoenix, he was even more afraid of Corpse King Ying Gou. No… He wasn’t just afraid of Ying Gou, but he was petrified every time he thought about the other party.

That was because Ying Gou was the incarnation of the corpse qi from the three worlds! His body didn’t contain a trace of blood, and naturally, he was someone with no fleshy body. There was no way Sun Wukong could kill him! Even if his body was shattered, he could reform himself. As for the corpse qi he emitted, it was on a whole new level of scary. There was nothing in the world that could resist it, and not even Sun Wukong’s body could hold out for several breaths of time!

The corpse qi from Ying Gou’s body would be able to corrode an innate spiritual treasure in seconds!

Not even his Golden Rod would be able to stand against the power of the corpse qi!

As long as Ying Gou willed it, Sun Wukong’s treasured weapon would turn into a piece of scrap metal!

“Have you two fought before?” Huang Xiaolong asked when he noticed the terrified look on Sun Wukong’s face.

Shaking his head, a helpless smile appeared on Sun Wukong’s face. “It wasn’t really a fight. We met in the past as I was curious about my surroundings. I wandered too far into the earth as I wanted to see what Corpse King Ying Gou looked like.”

“So did you see him?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

An awkward look appeared on Sun Wukong’s face. “I did…” A chill ran up his spine as he continued, “He’s more terrifying than anything I had ever seen in my life. The place he lives in is even worse than the netherworld! There are corpses everywhere! Corpse qi filled the lands and there were different bodies laying all around. Corpses of divine beasts and universe-level monsters could be seen all around!”

The more he thought about it, the more scared he became.

“I was discovered by Corpse King Ying Gou the moment I stepped foot into his territory.”

The monkeys seated around felt their hearts beating faster.

“He sent a palm strike flying towards me, and it tore through the very space we were in!” The hairs on Sun Wukong’s body sprang up as goosebumps filled his body.

“What… What happened next?” the Scarlet Tailbone Baboon couldn’t help but ask.

“The corpse qi was like a sea that threatened to submerge me. It was terrifying!” Sun Wukong yelled. “Luckily for me, I knew several advanced movement arts, and I managed to escape. The entrance wasn’t too far from where I stood, and I ran before the corpse qi could hit me.”

“Even so, I was scratched by the corpse qi and I only managed to get rid of it after getting my teacher to help.”

The monkeys felt beads of cold sweat dripping down their foreheads, and they could tell that it was an extremely dangerous situation.

“Tomorrow, I’ll head over to Ying Gou’s cave dwelling. You can follow me down then,” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, an awkward look appeared on Sun Wukong’s face. He had sworn never to return after his brush with death in the past.

After all, the scene from many years ago was still living in his head, giving him endless nightmares.

“Well, I’m here.” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Nothing will happen to you. Anyway, his injuries won’t be light now that he took one of my attacks.”

Sun Wukong suppressed the fear in his heart and muttered, “Alright then… We shall meet Corpse King Ying Gou tomorrow!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response.

Soon after, the banquet came to an end.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Five Finger Mountain and the talisman after arriving in the inner palace.

The treasures in his hands were pretty legit. It was especially so for the talisman as it had the ability to suppress almost every type of energy!

Opening his mouth, a trace of true essence entered the treasures. It shattered the mark Buddha Rulai had on the treasures.

A grunt escaped Rulai’s lips when he was meditating in his seat. He felt his heart trembling slightly.

After shattering the soul mark Rulai had on the treasures, Huang Xiaolong branded his own mark on them. He took out the Sun Moon Furnace, and he refined the treasures for half a day. He planned to fuse them together, and their abilities would definitely increase when that happened!

The night passed uneventfully.

By the time the Five Finger Mountain emerged from the furnace, it had already fused with the talisman. The talisman was branded into the mountain, and it looked different from when Huang Xiaolong tore it off the face of the mountain.

The six words of truth were inscribed deep into the mountain face, but one would realize that the words were the new source of the mountain’s strength!

That was right. The Five Finger Mountain seemed to be reborn after Huang Xiaolong’s refinement!DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The artifact was several times stronger than before!

As the five peaks emitted the power of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, brilliant rays enveloped the mountain.

Buddhist energy came from the six inscribed words, and it melded completely into the artifact.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction when he looked at the artifact. The Five Finger Mountain could be renamed to the True Rune Five Phases Mountain!

“Your Highness!” Sun Wukong appeared out of nowhere, and he looked at the artifact in Huang Xiaolong’s hand as he gasped in shock, “This…”

“I used a little bit of strength to fuse the talisman with the Five Finger Mountain. Now that they are one, the strength of the new artifact cannot be compared to the past,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Sun Wukong was shocked.

That was the first time he had heard of the notion that the Five Finger Mountain could be fused with the talisman! Even when they were separate entities, the treasures were at a shocking level! Now that Huang Xiaolong had combined them, no one would be able to stand in its way!

“Were you too excited to sleep last night?” Huang Xiaolong joked.

… “No?” Sun Wukong rubbed his head in embarrassment.

“Let’s go meet Ying Gou now.” Huang Xiaolong took a step out as soon as he spoke.

Sun Wukong followed closely behind as if he was afraid of getting separated. Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement when he saw how scared the Monkey King was. He didn’t think that the Monkey King who dared to go against the Heavenly Court would be so afraid of meeting someone.

The two of them quickly arrived.

“Your Highness, that’s the entrance…” Sun Wukong pointed at a tiny hole in the earth. It wasn’t large, and it could only contain several people at best. A weird howl came from the depths of the hole, and eerie cries could be heard.

“What a strong air of resentment,” Huang Xiaolong uttered.

Sun Wukong stared at Huang Xiaolong in amazement.

As soon as he entered the hole, Huang Xiaolong discovered that everything was exactly as Sun Wukong described. Corpse qi filled the air and there was a lake of corpses.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste time as he swept the entire cavern with his dao souls. It took him a second to start making his way towards the deepest part of the cavern.

Sun Wukong didn’t dare to dally as he followed right behind Huang Xiaolong.
