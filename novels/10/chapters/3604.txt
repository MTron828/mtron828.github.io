Chapter 3605 – Why Should I Respect You?

The four of them charged into the city at once.

When the four of them entered the city, Lin Xian led the experts of the celestial empire over to welcome them.

“We greet the Lord Ancestor, Lord Chen Huanzhi, Lord Ying Ze, and Lord Ying Wan!”

Lin Xian bowed respectfully as the others fell to their knees.

Lin Qiankun allowed them to get to their feet, and he asked, “Is the Blue Dragon Young Master still in the Golden Manor?”

“Yes.” Lin Xian replied instantly. “He hasn’t left since the incident happened.”

“That’s great.” Ying Ze sneered. “Blue Dragon Young master… You better not disappoint me.”

They left for his manor and the experts of the celestial empire followed closely behind.

It didn’t take long for them to arrive.

When Chen Huanzhi opened his dao eye, he noticed the grand formations around the manor and he gasped softly, “Did he lay down the formations himself?!”

Even though the formations were casually laid down by Huang Xiaolong, ordinary God of Creation Realm experts would never be able to do anything like that! Even half step Universe Gods like himself might not be able to create such powerful formations!

Lin Qiankun nodded his head and sighed, “The formations around the manor are really intricate. If I join hands with Ying Ze, we might need half a day to shatter them…”

Of course, if Chen Huanzhi were to help, they wouldn’t take that long.

Ying Ze’s voice rang through the skies. “Blue Dragon, Lord Marshal Chen Huanzhi has arrived! Why aren’t you out here to welcome him?! Do you really want us to shatter the formations around your manor before you emerge?!”

His words rang through the city and he was clearly smearing Huang Xiaolong’s reputation.

A flash of light appeared from inside the Golden Manor before Ying Ze could continue speaking.

“That’s him! Lord Chen Huanzhi, that’s the Blue Dragon Young Master!” Lin Xian exclaimed when he saw the figure.

When they laid their eyes on him, a look of confusion formed on their faces.

“Who might you be?” Chen Huanzhi broke the silence.

Sweeping his gaze across those present, Huang Xiaolong noticed Ying Wan immediately. He saw the look in his eyes, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sneer, “Are you going to come at me together? Or are you going to take turns to get beaten up?”

He was naturally referring to Chen Huanzhi, Lin Qiankun, and Ying Ze. Everyone else there were like flies compared to the three.

Even though Lin Qiankun and Ying Ze had decided to work together before they confronted Huang Xiaolong, they were stunned when he called them out.

Chen Huanzhi was equally as stunned.

No matter what, all three of them were half step Universe Gods. Every single one of them was a peak level expert in the Limitless Land and if the news of them ganging up on someone were to spread through the lands, they would turn into laughing stocks!

“You’re not worthy of Lord Chen’s attention.” Ying Ze snorted, “Brother Qiankun and I will be more than enough to take you down. Let’s see how strong you really are!”

As soon as he spoke, he leaped at Huang Xiaolong.

Lin Qiankun didn’t hesitate as he followed closely behind.

Chen Huanzhi didn’t move a muscle as he wanted to see if the two of them could actually hold Huang Xiaolong back.

Even though Lin Qiankun hadn’t broken through the 10 billion units mark, he was the oldest half step Universe God in the Limitless Land. His combat abilities far surpassed any half step Universe God.

Ying Ze summoned a curved blade in his hand and Lin Qiankun used a long whip. The curved blade in Ying Ze’s hand was a top-grade creation artifact, but Lin Qiankun’s whip was not. Even so, it neared the top-grade creation artifact level. His lack of top-grade creation artifacts was the reason he wanted to make a trade with his universe-level spiritual veins.

“Bring out your weapon!” They stood before him and snorted.

“My hands are more than enough to deal with you.” Huang Xiaolong ignored them as he slowly raised his fists.

Chen Huanzhi was slightly shocked when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. The two of them were equally as stunned. When experts whose strength were comparable sparred, the difference between using a creation artifact was huge!

The only way he would be able to take them on would be if he was much stronger than them!

Ying Ze and Lin Qiankun started to hesitate when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Slowly looking at each other, they came to a decision.

Ying Ze soared through the skies and his blade sliced at Huang Xiaolong’s neck.

Lin Qiankun didn’t remain idle as his whip tore through the space at it shot towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

The two of them were half step Universe Gods, and the strength they possessed was out of this world. Their attacks were extremely quick and they contained a terrifying amount of power.

Huang Xiaolong casually stopped the blade when it was a single inch away from his throat and he grabbed the whip with his other hand. Slightly shaking his arms, the two of them were sent flying in an instant.

Two explosions rang through the skies as they smashed into the earth. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Cracks started to spread through the city and the tremors rocked the entire region.

Ying Wan and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong in fright.

Chen Huanzhi felt a bad premonition creeping up his heart.

With a single gesture, Huang Xiaolong dragged Ying Wan towards himself. He stared at the man with a cold gaze.

Ying Wan’s body trembled subconsciously when he faced Huang Xiaolong.

“I spared your life once when you came looking for me in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion. I told you that I’ll kill you if you try this again.” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “It seems as though my advice has fallen on deaf ears.”

With fear in his heart, Ying Wan screamed, “Lord… Lord Chen Huanzhi, please save me!”

“Blue Dragon Young Master, please spare him on my behalf…” Chen Huanzhi opened his mouth to plead for mercy on Ying Wan’s behalf, but he was cut short.

Huang Xiaolong shattered Ying Wan’s body with a single punch.

The death of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage was no small matter. The skies trembled and rays of gold rained down on the land. A shockwave that contained the power to shatter the earth rocked the city.

The experts of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape.

After killing Ying Wan, Huang Xiaolong turned to Chen Huanzhi. “Why should I spare him because you’re here? Do you really think you’re someone worthy of my attention?”

“Wan’er!” Ying Ze’s scream came from the pile of dentist on the ground, and he rushed towards Huang Xiaolong with his eyes completely red.
