Huang Xiaolong checked the rankings through his identity token after sending the disciples out of sight with a punch, and saw that his position had risen from the second place to the first place!

In the highest position, Huang Xiaolong’s name shone as radiant as the sun, suppressing Peng Xiao’s name that was now in second place.

The number of Huang Xiaolong’s Fortune Divine Fruits had increased to 1,089, leaving Peng Xiao in the dust.

“Sun Shihai’s rankings competition result was 1,123 Fortune Divine Fruits, wasn’t it?” Huang Xiaolong mumbled to himself as he thought that he could surpass Sun Shihai’s result very soon.

In the subsequent batches of disciples’ rankings competitions, no other disciple had been able to break Sun Shihai’s record.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared from the sea area in a flicker.

Meanwhile, Liu Qin remained half buried in sand, jerking uncontrollably on the beach.

Zhao Lei, Gongsun Chi, Xu Wen, Zhang Dong and the other Fortune Emperor Palace’s higher echelons stood dumbfounded in front of the mirror jades for a long time.

There was one Elder who was dramatically agape with his hand over his mouth.

After Huang Xiaolong had captured the first spot on the rankings list, the other disciples on the giant island had soon noticed the situation, rendering them dumbstruck, shocked, and bewildered.

And shortly after, these disciples had also discovered that Liu Qin’s position had fallen from the fourth place to the bottom of the rankings list!

This—!

This discovery had stupefied all of them.

The sudden increase in the number of several hundred Fortune Divine Fruits for Huang Xiaolong had clearly come from Liu Qin!

But, how the heck did Liu Qin’s Fortune Divine Fruits fall into Huang Xiaolong’s hands?

Did Huang Xiaolong snatched it from Liu Qin? The disciples denied this possibility the moment it surfaced to their minds. They would rather be killed than believe in such a possibility.

On a certain flat land on the giant island, the purple-haired young girl Peng Xiao also detected the changes on the rankings list. There was astonishment on her face and her eyes widened slightly in disbelief.

A long time later, she recovered and muttered softly to herself, “A variant True Dragon Physique that can evolve without limit? Maybe, Huang Xiaolong could be of help to me in the future...?”

At the same time, within a cave somewhere, Fu Feiyu’s expression was as sullen as it could be, even so, it did not hide the confusion and apprehension on his face.

“Huang Xiaolong...” Cold gleams glinted in Fu Feiyu’s eyes. “What really happened between you and Liu Qin, I will know after I find you.” No matter what, he refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong had defeated Liu Qin relying on his own strength.

Fu Feiyu exited the cave right away.

The news of Huang Xiaolong defeating Liu Qin spread from the examination hall to all the other parts of the Fortune Emperor Palace, like a hurricane.

Inside a space somewhere within the Fortune Emperor Palace’s grounds, a middle-aged man and several old men were discussing the results of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples’ recruitment from the various branches.

These people were obviously in a good mood while discussing the disciples’ recruitment from the various branches, as this could be proven by the occasional laughters in the air.

“First, Sun Shihai appeared, followed by Peng Xiao; now our Fortune Emperor Palace has two supreme godhead geniuses. This is our Fortune Emperor Palace’s good fortune!” A thin, short-haired old man with crimson eyebrows laughed vigorously.

“Furthermore, Peng Xiao has the Purple Phoenix Physique, and her talent is no less compared to Sun Shihai. As long as we cultivate them well, they would definitely become a new generation of Emperors! And that would add two more Emperor masters to our Fortune Emperor Palace!” A slightly rotund old man chimed in with a sheepish smile on his face.

“More than a month has passed since the current rankings competition began, right? How many Fortune Divine Fruits has Peng Xiao gotten so far?” Another old man with a burly physique asked aloud.

This middle-aged man and several old men were none other than the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Emperor and Ancestors.

“If you want to know how many Fortune Divine Fruits Peng Xiao has gotten, just check the rankings list.” The short-haired and crimson-eyebrowed old man Li Shan laughed and said.

“Since there’s nothing much going on right now, let me take a look.” The slightly rotund Zhou Chen smiled as he took out a jade tablet and began looking at the rankings list.

The rankings list soon appeared in front of his eyes, but when he saw the name in the first position, he blanked for a moment.

When he looked further down the rankings list, he was more dazed.

The Fortune Emperor Fang Gan, and the Ancestors were baffled when they noticed his expression.

“Did Peng Xiao perform badly? Has she accumulated at least five hundred Fortune Divine Fruits by now?” Fortune Emperor Fang Gan asked Zhou Chen.

Zhou Chen nodded and replied, “Peng Xiao’s performance is not bad, she already has six hundred and thirty-five of them.”

“Six hundred and thirty-five!” The burly figured Ancestor, Chen Yirong, let out a deep chuckle and commented, “Not bad, not bad. It seems like Peng Xiao has a chance to break Sun Shihai’s record.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In general, Even though it was harder to ‘gather’ Fortune Divine Fruits in the latter part of the rankings competition, based on Peng Xiao’s current results, she really has a chance to break Sun Shihai’s record of 1,123 Fortune Divine Fruits.

Zhou Chen interjected, “However, the one in the first place is not Peng Xiao.”

“What?! Not Peng Xiao?!” Fang Gan and the others were greatly surprised by his words.

“I’ve heard that there are two other disciples who have broken through to God King Realm—Fu Feiyu, and Liu Qin. Could it be that one of them has taken the first place?” Li Shan asked doubtfully.

But Zhou Chen shook his head then passed over the jade tablet in his hand as he said, “Take a look for yourself.”

Fang Gan and the others were even more baffled. They swept their divine senses over the jade tablet, and when they saw the name occupying the first place, none of them could react for a second.

“Huang Xiaolong?” Li Shan raised an eyebrow, “Which branch does Huang Xiaolong come from? Why haven’t we heard of him before?”

Fang Gan contemplated for a while then said, “Let me ask Zhang Dong.”

Soon, Fang Gan received a reply from Zhang Dong, however, he was even more astonished after hearing Zhang Dong’s reply.

Li Shan, Zhou Chen, and Chen Yirong exchanged a look between themselves at Fang Gan’s expression.

“What is it?” Li Shan couldn’t help urging Fang Gan.

Fang Gan took a deep breath and said, “Huang Xiaolong is only a peak early Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple.”

“What?!” Li Shan, Zhou Chen, and Chen Yirong exclaimed in unison.

“Just a while ago, Huang Xiaolong defeated Liu Qin and obtained all of Liu Qin’s Fortune Divine Fruits and rose to the first place!” Fang Gan explained.

“What?!” Li Shan and the other two Ancestors exclaimed once more.

“This, this Huang Xiaolong, what’s his godhead? Is it one of the top ten supreme godhead?!” Zhou Chen asked after recovering from his shock.

Fang Gan shook his head, “This is the strange point... According to Zhang Dong’s report, Huang Xiaolong’s godhead is merely the high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead.”

Li Shan, Zhou Chen, and Chen Yirong blanked at the answer.

“However, Huang Xiaolong has a variant True Dragon Physique that can evolve continuously.” Fang Gan went on, “Zhang Dong said that his True Dragon Physique has already surpassed the Great Holy Physique!”

Li Shan and the rest were astonished once more.

Of course, Zhang Dong had not informed Fang Gan that Huang Xiaolong had defeated Liu Qin with one move, otherwise, they would have been even more shocked.

“Huang Xiaolong has a variant True Dragon Physique.” Zhou Chen mumbled to himself.

At this time, Li Shan broke the silent atmosphere with a soft chuckle as he said, “I’m very interest to see if Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique is as strong as they are claiming it to be.”

“Should we go to the examination hall to take a look at this?” Chen Yirong suggested.

“Good ah, we’re free anyways, let’s go.” Li Shan agreed smilingly.

With that, Fang Gan, Li Shan, and the rest stepped out of the space, and in the next moment, space was torn as several figures appeared outside the examination hall.
