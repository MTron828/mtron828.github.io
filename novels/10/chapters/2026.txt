Chapter 2027: Lan Chong in Despair

When he saw Huang Xiaolong’s group of three, Lan Chong’s gaze landed on the King of Darkness. A trace of unease flashed past his eyes. He felt that the man in black was kind of familiar, but no matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t think of where he had seen him before.

However, from the aura the black-robed man was exuding, it was clear that he was at the Sovereign Realm.

There’s another Sovereign Realm expert around Huang Xiaolong! He’s someone who cultivated the devil arts!

Lan Chong’s expression turned serious.

He realized that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t sense the other party’s strength.

When everyone from the Devil-Eyed Blue Lion Empire gathered behind Lan Chong, they stared at Huang Xiaolong and the black-robed man in disbelief.

In the past, the Black Killer Sect, Hundred Transformations Sect, and the Lightning Beast Valley had surrounded Huang Xiaolong and planned to kill him. Huang Xiaolong had eventually annihilated them, and only three people had managed to escape.

Right now, they were far weaker than the group Huang Xiaolong had killed in the past.

They could also see that the black-robed man beside Huang Xiaolong was a Sovereign Realm expert.

“Huang Xiaolong, what did you do to my men?!” Lan Chong glared at Huang Xiaolong after withdrawing his killing intent.

A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “What do you think?”

“You killed them all?!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in reassurance. “Of course I didn’t do that. I’m not a bloodthirsty monster. It’s hard to cultivate an Emperor Realm expert. The road of cultivation wasn’t easy for them.” He waved his arm, and a group of people appeared behind him. They were the experts from the Devil-Eyed Blue Lion Empire who had already surrendered to Huang Xiaolong.

Previously there were over a hundred of them. Adding Lan Yu’s group, there were now over one hundred and twenty.

They formed two lines as they lined up behind Huang Xiaolong. None of them spared a glance at Lan Chong.

When Lan Chong realized that they were still alive, a wave of relief swept through his heart. However, when he realized that something was off about them, rage started bubbling from the depths of his heart. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and snapped, “Huang Xiaolong, what did you do to them?!” Killing intent started to emerge from his body.

Huang Xiaolong was naturally able to detect it, and he chuckled, “What do you think? With your abilities, you should know that all of them are already under my control.”

“What?!” Lan Chong’s expression turned ugly to the extreme, and the joy of him seeing his subordinates alive disappeared.

The faces of Lan Changruo and the others weren’t too good either.

“Die!” Lan Chong transformed into a massive blue lion as he charged towards Huang Xiaolong. His paws swept out in an attempt to crush Huang Xiaolong to death.

Terrifying waves of energy surged towards Huang Xiaolong as Lan Chong leaped towards him.

“Kill Huang Xiaolong right now!” Lan Chong’s voice reverberated through the minds of all the experts from the Devil-Eyed Blue Lion Empire.

The King of Darkness sneered when he saw Lan Chong’s attempt to kill Huang Xiaolong. “Petty tricks!” He raised his right fist and welcomed Lan Chong’s attack.

Seeing as the black-robed man was stupid enough to receive his attack with a single hand, Lan Chong couldn’t help but turn furious. However, he soon realized that he was the one who was wrong as boundless darkness energy appeared from the void as it surged towards him.

The darkness energy seemed to originate from the deepest part of Hell.

When he felt the world-crushing power behind the wave of darkness energy, Lan Chong’s expression froze. He yelled angrily as he covered his body in blue light. He gathered all his strength as he slammed his paws towards the sea of darkness.

Boom!

Under the shocked gazes of the Devil-Eyed Blue Lion Empire’s members, Lan Chong was sent flying. He flew out of the world surface they were on and slammed into a dying star not too far away.

As soon as he crashed into the dying star, it broke apart as it crumbled into a million pieces.

Lan Chong vomited mouthfuls of fresh blood as he shot backwards.

Those who were about to charge towards Huang Xiaolong to teach him a lesson stared at the black-robed man in shock. A look of fear slowly appeared on their faces when they realized how strong the King of Darkness was.

Upon smashing through the dying star, Lan Chong managed to gather his bearings after retreating for several hundred thousand miles. The Blue Lion Divine Armor around his body had long since turned into scrap metal as a layer of darkness energy swirled around his body. It sucked away all the vitality in his body, and it seemed as though he would die soon.

“Great Emperor!” Lan Changruo and the others finally snapped back to reality when they saw Lan Chong’s sorry state. They rushed to his side and poured divine pills into his mouth. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Lan Chong swallowed the pills before looking at the King of Darkness with a face full of fear. “You! Senior Darkness... You’re the King of Darkness!”

He had felt that the King of Darkness was somewhat familiar, but he couldn’t recall where he had seen him before. After taking the attack head-on, he realized that the black-robed man was none other than the King of Darkness!

Even if he was given a million tries, he could have never guessed that the King of Darkness would be following Huang Xiaolong around!

When they heard what Lan Chong said, the Devil-Eyed Blue Lion Empire’s experts gasped in shock. Their bodies started to tremble as a feeling of unbridled fear appeared in their eyes. The King of Darkness! The black-robed man was the world-renowned King of Darkness!

The King of Darkness was an overlord at the same level as the Heavenless Archdevil Lord!

In the past, the King of Darkness had carried out wanton massacres and managed to swallow the spirit essence of countless creatures. His reputation rang far and wide, not losing out to the Heavenless Archdevil Lord in the slightest.

Horror would fill the minds of everyone who heard the name ‘King of Darkness.’

However, he should have been killed by the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and the alliance of world leaders!

If the news of the King of Darkness’ revival were to spread, the myriad of worlds would be thrown into chaos once again.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about the thoughts running through Lan Chong’s mind as his voice resounded through the air. “Release the defenses in your godsea and allow me to control you. Otherwise, you will die!”

“I am willing to submit!” “Me too!” As soon as the words left his lips, a group of experts revealed their intentions to surrender. When they learned of the King of Darkness’ identity, all thoughts of resistance were already thrown out of their minds.

When Lan Chong saw that everyone was surrendering, a look of despair flashed through his eyes. However, he turned into a streak of blue light as he tried to escape.

It was too bad a massive leg appeared in front of him before he could leave. As the leg swept out, he was sent flying back towards Huang Xiaolong.

Landing on the ground before Huang Xiaolong, he felt as though all the bones in his body were broken. He stared at the little cow with a fearful expression as he stammered, “You... you... who are you?!”

Ignoring Lan Chong, the little cow turned to the King of Darkness and complained. “Old Black, it seems like your reputation precedes mine! People can recognize you, but they have no idea who I am!”

The King of Darkness snorted as he turned away from the little cow.

“You... Old Ancestor Azure Cow?!” Lan Chong felt as though a bomb had gone off in his mind as the words nearly failed to leave his lips. His mind collapsed. The King of Darkness alone was enough to fill him with despair. Now that Old Ancestor Azure Cow had appeared, there was no hope of him escaping. Even if the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, Wu Shaowu, joined hands with the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor, Zhao Yuan, they wouldn’t be able to save him.

Half an hour passed.

Lan Chong lay on the ground, motionless.

A Sovereign stood at the peak of the world. There was almost no one who could threaten them. However, Huang Xiaolong stared at Lan Chong’s lifeless body on the ground as the devil qi in the air slowly corroded it.

Huang Xiaolong sank into silence as he gathered the Devil-Eyed Blue Lion Empire’s members to bury Lan Chong’s body.
