Chapter 3144: Huang Xiaolong Gets Beaten Up!

While Huang Xiaolong was slightly in awe of the behemoth beast, the beast spoke, “The Son of Creation?!”

Its voice rumbled with the surroundings like ten thousand thunderbolts roiling simultaneously.

“It is I,” Huang Xiaolong exhaled silently and admitted.

“Your strength is not bad to be able to reach here,” the behemoth beast commented, “However, you’re disillusioned if you think you can take away the Tree of Origin. Looking at the sake of the God of Creation, leave!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “I must take away the Tree of Origin.”

Two beams of light shot out from the behemoth beast’s ocean-sized pupils, straight at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong raised his enormous dragon claws and met the attacks head-on.

Rumble!

Huang Xiaolong was sent flying by an overwhelming force, tumbling uncontrollably out of the supercontinent. When he managed to steady himself, great waves of shock hit his heart.

Although he did not use any absolute powers, he was in his creation dragon form. Not to mention, his Dao Body of Heaven, and Earth failed to withstand a casual attack from the beast!

He did not use any absolute powers, neither did the other side. The behemoth beast merely used his grand dao energy.

After sending Huang Xiaolong flying, the beast mocked Huang Xiaolong with undisguised disdain in his eyes, “You want to take away the Tree of Origin relying on your meager strength?”

Huang Xiaolong’s face sank as he stared straight at the beast, and let out a resounding roar. Eleven elements of absolute powers surged rapidly around him, with a flick of his tail, Huang Xiaolong arrived in front of the beast. Three small worlds’ cosmos energy was pushed to the limit, concentrated in his dragon claw as it slammed down on the beast. World-destroying energy from eleven elements of absolute energies burst out in glaring rays of lights.

Yet, targeted by Huang Xiaolong’s world-destroying dragon claw containing eleven absolute powers, the behemoth beast was unperturbed at all. It raised its claw that was bigger than Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw, countering Huang Xiaolong’s attack directly.

R-rrr-rumble!

Ear-splitting blast thundered and Huang Xiaolong was sent flying once again.

This time around, Huang Xiaolong was blasted further than the first time. As Huang Xiaolong tumbled away, violent energy tore a space path across the distance!

When Huang Xiaolong stopped, something hot surged up Huang Xiaolong’s throat, and he coughed up a mouthful of golden blood.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the beast in astonishment. That’s—! There were thirteen kinds of lights swirling around the behemoth beast’s body! Thirteen different lights that represented thirteen kinds of absolute energies! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Thirteen kinds!

That’s right, thirteen kinds!

On the other hand, he had only comprehended eleven elements of absolute powers! All this time, it had never crossed Huang Xiaolong’s mind that there might be someone, or a beast, who had mastered all thirteen elements of energies!

This behemoth beast had already mastered the power of time and space.

That was not all! Each kind of absolute power had been cultivated to the major completion level! On top of that, seven of the thirteen absolute powers had reached perfection level!

There were thirteen elements of absolute powers, with seven of them at perfection level and others at major completion level or higher!

Huang Xiaolong’s heartbeat quickened due to shock.

The behemoth beast noted Huang Xiaolong’s astonishment, and his disdain grew stronger, “I’ve already told you that you’re dreaming if you’re thinking of taking away the Tree of Origin! I was born during the creation of the world, and I am the Origin Holy World’s very first fierce beast. I am the most ancient living creature of the Origin Holy World, and I have been cultivating under the Tree of Origin for countless eras. In the entire Huang Long World, I am invincible, and no one is my opponent, even you, the Son of Creation. Even if you have the support of Huang Long World’s energy, you’re no match against me!”

“Before I change my mind, you’d better leave quickly!” As the beast said this, a fierce light gleamed in its eyes. “Or, I would destroy you just the same even if you’re the Son of Creation!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression darkened at those words, “Even if you have comprehended thirteen elements of absolute powers, I will take away the Tree of Origin just the same!”

If he retreated this time, who can say for sure the beast won’t move away from the Tree of Origin!

Despite knowing that he wasn’t the beast’s opponent, he had the Huang Long Armor! He had the Huang Long Twin Blades! Two creation artifacts!

A harsh snicker escaped the beast’s mouth. “Relying on merely five perfection level absolute powers?” As it asked, a strange light gleamed in its pupils. “However, it’s surprising that you’ve actually had three small worlds, but it is as expected of the Son of Creation!”

He was born at the same time of creation, his bloodline was more powerful than anyone even though it cannot be compared to the Huang Long Bloodline, and in fact, it wasn’t that much weaker. However, he had only managed to nurture one small world.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s power of nirvana roiled as he circulated the Soaring Dragon Art. Huang Long World’s energy nourished his body, healing his injuries.

“The body of creation dragon, perfection level power of nirvana, amazing healing abilities indeed,” the beast praised, watching Huang Xiaolong recover. Although it had seven absolute powers at perfection level, its power of time, space, and nirvana have not reached perfection level. Its power of nirvana was merely at the peak of major completion, and it was stuck, unable to advance to perfection.

Every time it felt like the power of nirvana was going to advance, there was a heavenly will that disrupted the progress.

Huang Xiaolong did not respond with words but with his action. In a flicker, he once again arrived in front of the behemoth beast, and this time, Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls, twelve Saint Fates, three small worlds’ cosmos energy, and eleven kinds of absolute powers were pushed to the limit.

BOOM!

The behemoth once again met with Huang Xiaolong’s attack head-on.

Huang Xiaolong was knocked far into the distance, spurting blood from his mouth. His injuries were more severe this time!

Even though the behemoth beast did not retaliate at full force, it did increase the force of its attack.

And Huang Xiaolong could tell, it was from the beast’s full strength.

The power of thirteen absolute powers was so terrifying!

After being smashed away, Huang Xiaolong attacked again.

Huang Xiaolong was sent flying again and again, but he came back every time. After a dozen times, the behemoth beast finally got annoyed, and snarled, “Since you’re adamant to die, don’t blame me!”

As its voice rumbled, its entire body moved. All along, it had merely used its two front claws to deal with Huang Xiaolong, but now, it stood up. Huang Xiaolong immediately felt as if the entire Origin Sea was shaking.

Boom!

Before Huang Xiaolong reacted, the beast’s claws slammed onto Huang Xiaolong’s creation dragon body. Huang Xiaolong was smashed into the distance, feeling as if his body would explode.

The beast’s thirteen kinds of powers wrecked havoc inside Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Too fast!

The beast’s movement was too fast, so fast that Huang Xiaolong didn’t have time to react. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t capture the beast’s movement at all.

The beast snickered, “My power of time and space have reached perfection level. Adding the perfection level of absolute wind power, no one in the Huang Long World can contend with my speed, and so, this is a one-sided beating!” and its body moved before the last word sounded.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t have time to think at all, and he immediately called out the Huang Long Armor.

Rumble!

The Huang Long Armor had just risen to the surface of Huang Xiaolong’s body, and the beast’s claws came slamming down again. Huang Xiaolong was sent flying once more, his blood flow became chaotic but this time, he did not cough up blood.

“Ei!” the beast exclaimed in slight surprise, staring at Huang Xiaolong for a split second then exclaimed, “Huang Long Armor!”

Its brows furrowed, looking displeased as it had not expected that Huang Xiaolong to have obtained the Huang Long Armor.

It then snorted, “So what if you have the Huang Long Armor? Let’s see how many of my attacks you can withstand!” With that said, it disappeared in a flicker, and its claws targeted Huang Xiaolong for the umpteenth time.
