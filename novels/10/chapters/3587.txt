Chapter 3588 – Ghost Corpses

Tao Hang’s expression changed when he heard what they said. He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Casually turning to the beast, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Save the girl.”

Bowing respectfully, the beast reached out a paw to grab the girl.

It took a mere second to pull her out of the encirclement, and when the ghost corpse in charge of attacking her lost its target, it focused on the man.

The blood drained from his face.

“You!” The man pointed at Huang Xiaolong and roared, “Once I escape, I’ll kill you!”

The lady who was saved couldn’t help but panic when she saw that Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of helping the man. “Fellow cultivator, please save my friend.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Even though they weren’t related by blood, they were disciples of the royal family. She couldn’t sit there and watch as he was killed.

Huang Xiaolong was completely impassive and he didn’t look like he was going to do a thing. Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to leave with Tao Hang and Tao Han’er, a sword light appeared from afar and slashed into one of the ghost corpses. Soon after, it reformed as it cut down the other creatures.

Several figures appeared in the distance.

When the man saw the people who approached, a look of joy formed on his face. “Eldest Uncle, Second Uncle, you’re here!”

Those who came were experts of the royal family.

When the ghost corpses saw their companions dying one by one, they quickly fled the scene. In the blink of an eye, everyone was gone.

“Jian Wen, are you alright?!” One of the middle aged men who arrived asked.

The disciple who was saved, Jin Jianwen, gasped, “I’m alright now. If not for all of you rushing over, I’ll be dead!” He turned to Huang Xiaolong and roared, “That man over there is a problem! He could have saved me, but he chose to leave me to die! He saved Jin Xue, allowing the rest of the beasts to surround me! He’s definitely plotting against me! We have to capture him and throw him into the heavenly prison!”

The experts turned to look at Huang Xiaolong with unfriendly faces after hearing what he said.

“Is what he said true?” The eldest uncle of the kid, Jin Chengming, frowned.

However a ray of light flashed through one of the beasts’ eyes as soon as the man spoke. It released its aura, and the world seemed to come crumbling down. The experts who came to save the man fell to their knees, and their breaths became rough.

As for Jin Jianwen, a look of fear found its way onto his face.

“It’s true.” Huang Xiaolong looked at all of them who were currently kneeling on the ground. “What are you going to do about it?”

Jin Chengming and the others felt their bodies drenched in sweat.

“We wouldn’t dare. Lord must be mistaken.” Jin Chengming hastily explained, “That’s not what we meant at all!”

“Mistaken?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

The beast standing beside Huang Xiaolong casually drew a line through space and Jin Jianwen was sent flying instantly. When he landed, he no longer showed any signs of life.

Jin Jianwen’s eyes were wide when he died. He didn’t think that he would be able to escape death in the hands of the ghost corpses, only to die to the beast who served Huang Xiaolong. Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong would dare to kill a member of the Royal Jin Family in front of so many people.

He might be a branch disciple, but he belonged to the royal family! Anyone who killed a member of the royal family in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire would face serious consequences!

Jin Chengming and the others looked at the corpse as their bodies trembled like a leaf in the wind.

The female disciple Huang Xiaolong saved previously was also stuck in a state of disbelief.

She was sent to deal with the ghost corpses along with Jin Jianwen by the family, and even though she had no relations with the man, she didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would kill him without batting an eyelid.

Huang Xiaolong looked at them and snorted, “Feel free to take your revenge. I’ll be in the Golden Sea City for quite some time.”

Soon after, he turned around and left.

Tao Hang and Tao Han’er stared at Jin Jianwen’s corpse for a little while longer before following behind Huang Xiaolong.

Along the way, Tao Hang felt his mind buzzing when he thought about how Huang Xiaolong killed a member of the royal family.

“Lord, the members of the Jin Family wouldn’t let this go.” Tao Hang couldn’t help but remind Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled casually. “That’s great. After all, it will make our lives much more interesting in the Golden Sea City.”

At a loss for words, Tao Hang could only stare at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

“Father, you can relax. When the members of the Wei Family were killed, they didn’t dare to cause any trouble.” Tao Han spoke up from the side.

Shaking his head slowly, Tao Hang sighed, “The Jin Family isn’t the Wei Family. The Jin Family is the true powerhouse in the Golden Sea Celestial Empire. They will never allow anyone to challenge their authority in the celestial empire.”

Smiling slightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t say a word. Instead, they continued on their way to the Golden Sea City. Along the way, they would run into several ghost corpses who were strong enough to challenge Primal Ancestors. There were even a few of them who had comprehended the elements.

Tao Hang frowned when he noticed the number of ghost corpses they ran into.

“Something definitely happened in the Sea of Burial. Otherwise, the ghost corpses will never appear here.”

“Did the Ghost Ancestor order the ghost corpses to attack us?” Tao Han asked.

In the past, a war between the ghost corpses and humans happened.

“It’s not likely…” Tao Hang explained, “If that was true, they would have mobilized the entire army. All the ghost corpses we ran into were pretty much alone. The largest group had several dozen of them, and they don’t seem to be under orders.”

The ghost corpses in the Sea of Burial were like humans. They had their cultivators and they formed various factions among themselves.

Despite the occasional attacks, the beasts around Huang Xiaolong were there to take care of everything. With a single slap, no ghost corpses would be left standing.

They didn’t slow down at all as they continued on their way towards the Golden Sea City.

Since Huang Xiaolong instructed them to slow down, they only arrived after a month.

They saw the giant gates of the Golden Sea City standing before them, and it was like the gates of a palace compared to the gates standing before the Falling Water City. The city was massive, and the walls around it were tens of thousands of feet tall. The entire city emitted the prestige of a celestial empire, and everyone felt a sense of awe in their hearts when they approached.

Tao Hang looked at the city as complicated emotions welled up in his heart.

It had been more than a hundred thousand years since he returned, but hatred filled his eyes when he thought about Tao Xinren.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong said as he rode into the city.

There were troops conducting checks all about, but they backed off when Tao Hang showed them the plaque of an inner disciple of the Tao Family.

When they entered, Tao Hang said to Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, it’s getting late. I have a courtyard in the city, and we can head over for a short break.”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.
