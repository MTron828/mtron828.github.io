Chapter 2414: Huang Xiaolong’s Cheating?!

Tyrant Chu felt his brain heating up again when he saw the smug look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Brat, are you really crazy? Do you think that you will be able to rank in the top three hundred? Let me tell you that no one will be able to rely on external assistance during the trial.”

“No external assistance?”

Tyrant Chu nodded. “That’s right. You won’t be able to bring saint artifacts into the venue, and you can’t ride your holy beasts. You won’t even be able to bring in pills to restore your energy. You’ll have to rely on yourself as soon as you enter the city. Don’t even think of using the Winged Dragon Flying Ship and the Darkness Holy Ring during the trial. Do you think that you’ll be able to enter the top three hundred ranks without them?”

Huang Xiaolong stared at his masters nonchalantly and replied, “This disciple knows what to do now.”

?!

Staring at Huang Xiaolong’s face, Tyrant Chu no longer bothered to talk to this annoying disciple of his.

After asking about several more matters regarding the trial, Huang Xiaolong emerged from his masters’ place.

“Trial of Blood....” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

He had learned that the trial would only take place forty years later and forty years was more than enough for him to prepare himself.

Right now, his goal was to enter the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm in order for his Heart of Hell to truly transform into a Dao Heart.

With a Dao Heart, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t care about merely passing the trials. Obtaining the first position was possible.

How could the holy soul of a True Saint compare to a Dao Heart of a Primal Ancestor? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Huang Xiaolong was obviously given a place in the Primal Ancestors’ space as their disciple. However, he didn’t bother entering the residence, and he immediately headed to the mission hall.

He had completed a ton of missions, and he needed to turn them all in for the rewards. After obtaining his contribution points, he would enter the Devil Cave once again to devour the saint attributes of the experts there.

When he arrived at the mission hall, the number of disciples wasn’t something he could scoff at. There were tons of disciples waiting to receive or turn in their missions.

Out of all the halls in the Holy Heavens, the Mission Hall was the busiest.

“We greet Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong!”

The disciples all around greeted Huang Xiaolong the moment he entered.

However, they were unable to conceal the weird look in their eyes. After all, the rumor of Huang Xiaolong being stupid had already started to spread. Moreover, there were even some people who questioned if a disciple of the Primal Ancestors was stupid enough to volunteer to kneel at the gates of the city for an entire day.

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them, and he quickly arrived at the counter to turn in his missions.

“Your Highness, this...?” The elder in charge of the mission hall immediately went up to Huang Xiaolong.

“I’m here to turn in my missions.” Without beating about the bush, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the heads of his targets. As for the profound beasts and the origin herbs required to complete his mission, he tossed them out one after another.

When the elder stared at the array of treasures lining the hall, his eyes widened in shock.

This time, Huang Xiaolong had accepted nearly a thousand missions. Those that involved him killing the experts of the evil faction numbered in the three hundreds. As for the missions involving profound beasts, nearly one of each species was present.

“Please verify the conditions of the mission.” Huang Xiaolong hurried the elder. “Record down all my contribution points. I’m in a hurry.”

The number of disciples who dared to hurry the elder of the Mission Hall in the Holy Heavens could probably be counted on one hand, but Huang Xiaolong was one of them.

With a smile on his face, the elder hastily verified the completion rates of all the missions.

He noted down the identities of all the disciples killed followed by the bodies of the profound beasts slain. Finally, he recorded down the herbs Huang Xiaolong had brought back.

Not a single mission was failed.

Finally, the elder quickly totaled up the points Huang Xiaolong had received and added them to his jade plaque.

Under the elder’s respectful escort, Huang Xiaolong left the Mission Hall.

He quickly stretched his body after leaving the Mission Hall. This time, the rewards were really plentiful. In total, he now had fifty thousand contribution points.

“These should be enough for me to push my saint attributes into the top forties....” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

Even though it was getting progressively more difficult to improve his saint attributes, fifty thousand contribution points were enough to push them to the fortieth rank.

When that happened, his combat abilities would soar!

After Huang Xiaolong left the Mission Hall, Li Cen, Xie Yao, Lin Yijia, and the others arrived to accept some missions.

When they heard that the Holy Heavens was giving out new missions, the few of them came to take a look.

They immediately bumped into the elder who escorted Huang Xiaolong out.

When Li Chen saw the complicated expression on the eler’s face, he asked about everything that had happened previously. Unable to conceal anything from Li Chen, the elder spilled everything.

“Nearly a thousand missions?! Fifty thousand contribution points?!” Li Chen and the rest gasped in shock.

Fu Yunjie piped up all of a sudden. “It’s impossible for an individual to complete so many missions alone.”

Xie Yao sneered when he heard what Fu Yunjie said. “He’s right. It’s impossible for Huang Xiaolong to kill them on his own. How dare he violate the rules of our Holy Heavens organization?! I think you should start investigating those who helped Huang Xiaolong complete the missions instead!”

The elder couldn’t help but stutter, “This...?”

“What’s with all the crap? Even if Huang Xiaolong is the disciple of the Primal Ancestors, he’s still a disciple of the organization! He has to follow the rules like the rest of us!” Xie Yao snapped, “Are you guys trying to cover up for him?!”

“Your Highness, the Mission Hall has always been impartial....”

“That’s great. As the personal disciple of the four Primal Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong has to lead by example. If he flouts the rules, he will be embarrassing the Primal Ancestors! You have to get to the bottom of the matter! Just do your job and everything will be fine. If Huang Xiaolong has broken the rules, Senior Brother Li Chen will back you up! The four Primal Ancestors will definitely deal with Huang Xiaolong according to the rules of the organization!”

“Yes, Your Highness.” The elder could only receive the order obediently.
