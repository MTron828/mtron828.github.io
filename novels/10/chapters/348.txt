Chapter 349: Ruins of the Ancient Dragon Clan

Beast God Shrine!

Only the Beast God Scepter could open it!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shone with expectation, it seems that he really needed to make a trip to the Ten Directions Continent in the near future...

Zhang Fu continued speaking, “Right, Sovereign, you told me to investigate Main Domain Chief Chen Tianqi’s motive in heading to the Origin Forest, this subordinate has found out.”

“Oh, you found his intention?” Huang Xiaolong refocused his attention to the present, putting away the Beast God Scepter as he asked Zhang Fu.

“Yes, Main Domain Chief Chen Tianqi is heading there because a ruin belonging to the ancient Dragon Clan has surfaced in the Origins Forest.” Zhang Fu answered.

“Ancient Dragon Clan’s ruins!” Huang Xiaolong was astounded.

Ancient Dragon Clan! The strongest clan in the Martial Spirit World!

Despite that, several tens of thousands of years ago, they disappeared from the Martial Spirit World. But now, their ruins actually resurfaced to the world.

Zhang Fu nodded his head, “That’s right, an ancient Dragon Clan’s ruin, but no one knows the exact location, information came back confirming for sure that it is somewhere in the Origins Forest. By now, Snow Wind Continent’s experts from different empires have got wind of the information too, and everyone is rushing over to the Origin Forest. Other than the Snow Wind Continent, experts from the other two continents, Starcloud Continent, and Ten Directions are also speeding to enter the Origin Forest.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help recalling the two middle-aged men he ran into when he ventured into the Ghost Domain, the Earth Dragon egg he ‘won’ after defeating the two men. Could it be, that Earth Dragon egg came from the same ancient Dragon Clan ruin in the Origin Forest?!

The more he thought about it, the more certain he was that his conclusion was right.

“Sovereign, then do we...?” Zhang Fu inquired, meaning to ask Huang Xiaolong if they will be heading to Origins Forest too.

“Go, of course we must go.” Huang Xiaolong said.

He possessed the twin black and blue dragon martial spirits, and he had absorbed an Earth Dragon egg. Compared to others, his chances of locating the Ancient Dragon Clan’s ruin were much higher, he absolutely had to go.

He had just advanced to the Saint realm, following the normal route, taking Geocentric Buddha Elixir night and day, practicing the Godly Xumi Art and Asura Tactics daily, it would take him ten years, maybe even twenty years to reach Second Order Saint realm.

However, if he managed to get another dragon egg, then it was a different story altogether. Not to mention, there would definitely be more than one dragon egg in the Ancient Dragon Ruin.

The Earth Dragon egg that Huang Xiaolong absorbed last time, the true dragon essence inside was scant. The Earth Dragons ranked bottom rung on the Dragon Clan’s hierarchy. If he could find a golden dragon’s dragon egg, the amount of true dragon essence would be several times, even several hundred times more abundant compared to the Earth Dragon egg.

At this point, Zhao Shu entered the yard from outside to report, “Sovereign, Duan Ren is here, he would like to see you.”

Duan Ren is here? In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong already guessed Duan Ren’s reason for coming to see him, without a doubt, he also received news about the Origin Forest.

“Let’s go, let us go meet him.” Huang Xiaolong said.

...

The three of them arrived at the grand hall a moment later.

Waiting in the grand hall, other than Duan Ren, were Duan Wuhen and two old men clad in golden battle gear.

Huang Xiaolong had seen these two old men before inside the Duanren Institute, both were part of the five Honorable Saint Masters, guardians of Duanren Institute.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu arrived, the four people in the hall stood up.

“Young Noble Huang, Mister Zhao.” Duan Ren took a few steps forward in greeting. Duan Wuhen and the two old men behind followed Duan Ren, greeting respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, indicating everyone to take a seat, doing the same himself.

“Young Noble Huang, have you heard about the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins in the Origin Forest?” Once seated, Emperor Duanren broached the subject with a frank and honest stance.

Indeed, Emperor Duanren made this visit for this sole purpose.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I have just found out a moment ago, and was just planning to make a trip over to the Origin Forest.”

Emperor Duanren’s face lit up at Huang Xiaolong’s answer, laughing he said, “Before coming here, I was thinking about joining forces with Young Noble Huang and Mister Zhao, we were also planning to head to the Origin Forest.”

“Good.” Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement.

Earlier, when Huang Xiaolong guessed Emperor Duanren’s purpose for meeting him, he already made a decision. Thus, when Duan Ren spoke of the matter frankly, Huang Xiaolong agreed to an alliance with no deliberation. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After all, this time there would be empire level experts from all three continents, when it came down to a fight, it was kill or be killed. As such, it was always good to have more strength and power.

Subsequently, both mentioned some terms in regards to the alliance.

When facing enemies, both sides would join hands to deal with the enemy, advancing and retreating in the same breath. Treasures belonged to whoever found them.

When all was agreed upon, Huang Xiaolong said, “Since things are settled, everyone should get ready to depart in two hours towards the Origin Forest.”

“Agreed.” Emperor Duanren stood up, bid farewell to Huang Xiaolong, Zhao Shu, and Zhang Fu, leaving the Southern Hill Estate back to Duanren Palace with Duan Wuhen and the two old men behind him to prepare the necessary things and assembled in Southern Hill Estate in two hours’ time.

After Emperor Duanren left, Huang Xiaolong went to see his parents, informing them that he would head to the Origins Forest.

Hearing that their son wanted to leave again, both parents’ faces were filled with sadness.

“Long’er, you must be very careful heading to the Origin Forest.” Su Yan’s eyes were red as she implored Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, “I will. Mother, rest assured, nothing will happen, your son is now a Saint realm expert.”

Listening to her son, Su Yan wiped away her tears with a smile, “It’s just that, my heart feels uneasy.” This unease inevitably made her worried.

She looked over to Zhao Shu, “Mister Zhao, I leave Young Lord’s safety in your hands.”

Zhao Shu took a step forward, respectfully saying, “Please rest assured, Madame.”

Two hours later, Duan Ren’s group of three returned to Southern Hill Estate to convene with Huang Xiaolong. Sent off with Huang Peng and Su Yan’s teary faces, Huang Xiaolong and his group made their way out of Duanren Imperial City.

This time, Duan Ren brought the same two old men, whereas Huang Xiaolong only brought Zhao Shu and giant ghost Feng Yang. Zhang Fu, Yu Ming, and the rest remained in Southern Hill Estate to protect everyone’s safety.

Initially, Duan Ren wanted to bring his son Duan Wuhen along, however, considering Duan Wuhen’s strength, he could only scrape the thought.

All six people in the group were Saint realm experts, rushing all the way at fast speed, in half a month’s time, they cut through Spring Faun Empire, entering High Sun Empire’s demesne. As long as they passed through High Sun Empire, they would arrive at the Origin Forest.

Night, hazy moonlight shone down the foggy darkness. Their vision only went as far as the five fingers with their arms extended out.

The six people stopped in a barren hill slope in High Sun Empire.

“Why don’t we rest here for the night and continue tomorrow?” Huang Xiaolong suggested.

Emperor Duanren has no opinion, hence all six people landed on the small hill peak. Initiating the true essence fire in his dantian, with a wave of his hand, a spark of flame fell on the ground. Huang Xiaolong already built fire for the night, stunning Emperor Duanren and the others as Huang Xiaolong’s true essence fire need not rely on wood to burn. When the fire fell on the ground, it burned with great brightness, lighting the peak like it was daylight.

Zhao Shu had seen too many unbelievable things in the years he stayed with Huang Xiaolong, now, not many things related to Huang Xiaolong could surprise him as they did before. But Duan Ren and the other two old men were shocked.

Exchanging glances amongst themselves, they saw their own shock mirrored in each other’s eyes.

Everyone gathered around the fire to rest for the night.
