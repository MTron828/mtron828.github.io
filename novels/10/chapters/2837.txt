Chapter 2838: Journey to Dragon Fish Creed

Yi Beihang hesitated for some time, and he eventually growled, “Fine! Let’s join hands with the Glorious Creed! I will pay them a visit soon!”

At this moment, a chilly voice rang through the hall, “You are not going anywhere!”

Yi Beihang, Wang Jin, and He Yugui were stunned when they heard the interruption. However, their expressions soon changed when they recognized the source of the voice.

“Huang Xiaolong!” The three of them leaped to their feet.

The skies started to tremble as their grand array was blasted wide open. The Qilin Chariot appeared above them.

Huang Xiaolong stood at the head of the chariot and stared at them with cold eyes.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng stood behind Huang Xiaolong silently.

The faces of the three were devoid of blood when they saw Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, what are you doing here?!” Yi Beihang growled.

Huang Xiaolong scoffed, “I took away half your vault and your dao origin. I came all the way here to thank you.”

Hearing the sarcasm, the three of them boiled with anger.

It was an utter humiliation for them when Huang Xiaolong had taken away their treasures and dao origin, and they were just reminded of it again from the man himself!

“If I didn’t come, how would have I learned about your plans? Weren’t you planning to hatch some plot to kill me?” Huang Xiaolong gave them a deep stare.

The three of them were at a loss for words.

“All of a sudden, I felt like I took too little. Leaving you guys with half seems a little too generous of me,” Huang Xiaolong spoke casually.

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you mean?! Don’t push us too far! Otherwise, we’ll drag you down with us even if we have to die here today!” Yi Beihang screamed with rage.

“I’m going too far? Don’t you remember what you all swore back then? Since you’re planning to join hands with another creed before leaking my secrets, you can’t blame me for what I’m about to do!” Huang Xiaolong scoffed.

His figure disappeared for a moment before he appeared in front of them.

They took several steps back involuntarily.

After all, Huang Xiaolong had caused quite a bit of trauma to them back then.

“You, what do you want?!” He Yugui broke the silence.

“I’m going to beat you up!” Huang Xiaolong answered.

?!

The three of them had no time to react as Huang Xiaolong swung his fists. The power of nirvana split open the void as it tore through their armors to land on their bodies.

Like Yan San, they released blood-curdling screeches.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng felt their hearts pounding in fear when they saw how Huang Xiaolong dealt with the three.

The last time Huang Xiaolong had fought with Yi Beihang and the others, they were not there. They were witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s strength for the first time.

He could send three Dao Venerables flying with a single move!

Both of them were completely dumbfounded by what they were seeing.

On the other hand, the Fire and Ice Qilin saw the three of them flying away, and they closed their eyes. They could imagine their fate after hearing what had happened to Yan San in the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

The scene of Yan San being tortured to tears appeared in their minds.

As expected, a day later, Yi Beihang, Wang Jin, and He Yugui broke down in tears! Just like Yan San, they were driven half to death by the power of nirvana.

The fight between Huang Xiaolong and Yi Beihang, Wang Jin and He Yugui had long alarmed Yi Xiaotang, Aunt Qing, and the members of the Blue Heaven Creed. When they saw the tear-stained faces of Yi Beihang and the others, they fell silent.

“Father…” Yi Xiaotang mumbled repeatedly as if she had lost her soul.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng couldn’t believe their eyes.

…

Two days later…

The Immemorial Qilin Chariot tore through the skies.

When Huang Xiaolong left, Yi Beihang, Wang Jin, and He Yugui bowed to send him off. They only got up after the chariot disappeared in the horizon.

The thought of joining the Glorious Creed was no longer in their minds.

Their eyes were filled with fear when they stared in the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s chariot.

When they thought about how Huang Xiaolong had taken away the rest of the treasury and another half of the dao origin that was left, pain filled their hearts. They felt like crying again, but there were no tears left.

“I’m, I’m done!” Yi Beihang cried.

He felt a wave of darkness clouding his vision, and a sense of helplessness filled his heart.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about their reactions, and he played with the jade bottle in his hands as he went on his merry way.

The jade bottle contained a quarter of the dao origin, and the remaining half of the treasury.

Huang Xiaolong smiled at the jade bottle in his hand as Long Jianfei and Duan Feng looked at him strangely. The two of them still couldn’t get over what had happened earlier.

He took out two jade bottles and tossed them over. “This is for you.”

There were ten Blue Heaven Dao Pills in each bottle, and they obviously came from the treasury.

“For… For us? Your Highness, this!” Long Jianfei and Duan Feng were astonished when they saw the pills lying in the bottle.

A low-grade dao pill like the Blue Heavens Dao Pill could only be used by a vice hall master and above in top-tier creeds like the Dragon Fish Creed! Moreover, it wasn’t something they could use frequently!

Long Jianfei had seen his master stashing away his dao pills without using them.

Now, Huang Xiaolong gave them ten pills like they were nothing!

“Accept it as there’s plenty left.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

With the amount he had taken from the vault, there were indeed a lot of them left.

Long Jianfei and Duan Feng exchanged glances and accepted his goodwill as they got to their knees.

Huang Xiaolong allowed them to get up, and he asked, “Tell me about the Dragon Fish Creed in detail. I also wish to know about the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave.”

Even though they had told him a little about the region, he felt that the information he had learned previously was too vague. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

They told him everything they knew in great detail, and they didn’t leave out the slightest bit of information.

According to what they said, the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave contained more than a single Creed. It was a thousand times bigger than the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, and there were twelve creeds located in the region controlled by the Dragon Fish Creed!
