Chapter 3349: Huang Xiaolong, You’re Too Arrogant!

 

Chen Haoguang raised his hand to settle everyone down. A chuckle left his lips. “In fact, I didn’t call all of you here to form an alliance just for a mere Huang Xiaolong.”

Everyone perked their ears up a little in response.

“When I was touring the Ancient Regions, I discovered an immortal cave!” Chen Haoguang explained.

“Immortal Cave?!” the experts standing around gasped in surprise.

Immortal Caves would have been left behind by certain experts tens of thousands of years ago. Those experts would ordinarily be in the Great Void Realm or above!

If that was the case, the immortal cave definitely contained priceless treasures!

“I feel that the immortal cave was left behind by a senior in the Great Void Realm.” Chen Haoguang continued, “The grand formation within isn’t too strong, and as long as all of us work together, there is an eighty percent chance that we can enter the cave!”

The experts in the plaza broke out into discussion instantly as excitement filled their hearts.

“However, I have a request. My Divine Court Sect discovered the immortal cave, and we wish to obtain half of whatever is within.” Chen Haoguang continued, “All of you can split the rest.”

Everyone fell silent instantly.

“Since Brother Chen found the immortal cave, I think it’s reasonable!” Liang Yun quickly spoke up.

“That’s right! Brother Chen is already willing to give us half of the loot and we’re extremely grateful for that!“ Kang Zhaoning, the old ancestor of the Ice Palace, smiled.

“Something weird is going on… Why aren't the experts from the Six Swords Gate here yet?” Cui Yuan asked all of a sudden.

“That’s what I was thinking…”

“Everyone accepted Brother Chen’s call to arms, and the Six Swords Gate dares to ignore it… Cao Deng is really going overboard…” Liang Yun frowned. 

“Maybe something happened to them.”

“Humph, I met Cao Deng just a month ago, what can possibly happen within such a short period?”

Everyone started to discuss once again.

Chen Haoguang was equally as confused. Three days ago, Cao Deng had said that he would be present. Why wasn’t he here?! Moreover, when Chen Haoguang contacted him the day before, he couldn’t get through.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The members of the Six Swords Gate won’t be coming.” A voice rang through the air as a figure could be seen walking in the air as he moved towards them.

Looks of surprise could be seen on the faces of those present.

Chen Haoguang’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Ancestor, do you think that I should…?” one of the experts from the Divine Court Sect asked. 

Chen Haoguang shook his hand slightly.

In the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong appeared before those present.

“What do you mean? Are you an envoy from the Six Swords Gate?” one of the experts in the Soul Condensation Realm asked.

He thought that Huang Xiaolong was an envoy sent by the Six Swords Gate.

“Cao Deng won’t be coming because I killed him.” 

“What?!” Everyone in the plaza turned to stare at him.

Their auras locked on Huang Xiaolong, but he ignored them as he walked towards Chen Haoguang. 

“Why would you kill Cao Deng? I wonder what grudges you bear against each other?” Chen Haoguang glared at Huang Xiaolong and asked.

He used his heavenly eye to observe Huang Xiaolong, but he couldn’t see the slightest bit of the other party’s cultivation base! Cao Deng was a Second Level Soul Condensation Realm expert, and if Huang Xiaolong could kill the man, he should be pretty strong.

The question was the motive behind the killing!

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face as someone in the crowd screamed, “Are you Huang Xiaolong?!” 

Huang Xiaolong!

Everyone felt their hearts dropping slightly.

Even Chen Haoguang didn’t know how to react.

“That’s right. I’m Huang Xiaolong,” he said as he continued to walk towards Chen Haoguang.

“Arrange the formation and take him down right now!” the Sect Master of the Divine Court Sect yelled. More than a dozen Soul Condensation Realm experts and more than three hundred Spirit Severing experts from the Divine Court Sect sprang into action as they laid down the Battle Star Formation. Long swords appeared in their hands as they summoned countless strands of sword qi that surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

Under the gaze of those present, the sword qi landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Everyone raised an eyebrow in shock.

Did we kill Huang Xiaolong already?!

Didn’t they say that Huang Xiaolong was in the mid-level Soul Condensation Realm?!

Their doubt was quickly replaced by terror when they saw that the sword qi couldn’t even break apart his robes!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop as he continued to make his way towards Chen Haoguang. Reaching out with a single hand, an invisible force appeared and the experts in his way were sent flying towards the outer reaches of the mountain range.

Boom!

The ground trembled slightly as dust filled the air.

The Soul Condensation Realm and Spirit Severing Realm experts of the Divine Court Sect were dealt with in an instant! Not a single one was spared!

Everyone else gasped in fright.

Chen Haoguang who was standing there like the king of the world fell to his butt in fright. However, he missed his throne, and he landed straight on the floor.

Huang Xiaolong arrived before Chen Haoguang, and the man rolled away in shock.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care that much as he sat on the throne in the middle of the plaza.

“Is there anyone else who wishes to make a move?” Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze through the crowd and asked.

Not a single person dared to speak.

Liang Yun, who was laughing at how Chen Haoguang would be able to kill Huang Xiaolong alone, hid in the crowd as his legs turned to jelly.

“Since no one else wishes to try anything stupid, you can kneel,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “I hope that all of you will make the correct choice. I killed Cao Deng because he refused to submit to me.”

No one said a word, but neither did they kneel.

“I’ll give you ten seconds to consider your options.”

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re too arrogant!” Cui Yuan of the Ghost Valley was the first to break the silence. “I’m a disciple of the Ancient Heavenly Ghost Race! I have the purest Ancient Heavenly Ghost Bloodline, and we’ll never submit to anyone! Who the f*ck do you think you are?!”

“I refuse to believe…”

Before he could finish his sentence, his body turned completely stiff. Huang Xiaolong pointed at him and a flame appeared in the space between his eyebrows. He was quickly incinerated as he turned to a pile of ashes that drifted in the wind.

Several minutes later, Chen Haoguang and the others submitted after Huang Xiaolong killed a few more old ancestors.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong could have controlled them all with his Grandmist Parasitic Medium. However, they were too damn weak for him to waste his efforts to do so. After all, a strand of grandmist aura was worth way more than all of them combined.

After he was done, Huang Xiaolong asked Chen Haoguang and the others about spiritual herbs in the region.

Staying on the Flowing Flame Star for a single day, Huang Xiaolong returned to Earth. He heard about the immortal cave from Chen Haoguang, but he was too lazy to explore the remains of someone in the Great Void Realm. In fact, the only inheritance he cared about was from Pangu! 

He allowed them to look for it themselves.
