Chapter 3637 – Guns Blazing

The grand elder who was together with the eminent elder couldn’t help but stutter when he heard that they were going to look for Yu Xiaohong. “But… But… Her strength…”

Jian Xiyuan might be an eminent elder of the Jian Family and his strength might be second only to the patriarch. However, he barely had 13 billion units of grand cosmos energy! He was far too lacking when compared to Yu Xiaohong.

A sneer left Jian Xiyuan’s lips, “So what?! Do you think she will dare to move against me?”

The grand elder lowered his head and muttered, “Even though she might not dare to, but we should really be careful…”

“If Yu Xiaohong dares to do anything to us, she’ll be in for a lot of trouble! This dumb b*tch dares to reject our patriarch… She really doesn’t know what’s good for her.”

Yu Xiaohong was a devastating beauty. With her relationship status and strength, she was the ideal partner for many supreme experts! The patriarch of the Jian Family, Jian Weifeng, was one of her many suitors!

In the past, he tried all sorts of things to chase her. He even tried proposing twice! Even so, he was rejected all the time.

The matter of his rejection spread throughout the Zhu Lan Land. With Jian Weifeng’s strength and status, he was like a god in the Zhu Lan Land! She was a perfect match for him, but because of the rejections, he turned into a laughing stock in the region!

“Should we report this to the patriarch?” The grand elder asked.

Nodding slowly, Jian Xiyuan sighed, “That’s actually a good idea.” Taking out his transmission symbol, he made a report to the patriarch.

It didn’t take long for him to receive a reply.

A smile formed on Jian Xiyuan’s face when he read the reply. “The patriarch has spoken! Because of her disrespect to lord ancestor, she will have to return all our gifts. In addition, she will have to take out twenty universe-level spiritual veins as compensation!”

The grand elder stared at Jian Xiyuan in shock.

However, he soon realized the patriarch’s intentions.

He was forcing her into a corner!

After getting rejected twice, Jian Weifeng formed a grudge against Yu Xiaohong!

“Let’s go! We’ll look for her now!” Jian Xiyuan harrumphed. After getting the reply from the patriarch, Jian Xiyuan felt extremely confident in himself.

As such, he brought along the experts of the Jian Family and they quickly made their way towards the imperial palace.

When they were making their way over, Huang Xiaolong was casually flipping through the sword manual. There were a hundred pages in total and there was an image of a sword on every one of them. While Huang Xiaolong flipped through the pages, Yu Xiaohong and the others standing beside him said, “Jian Wushiang’s sword dao is unparalleled in the Unknown Space. His comprehension of the sword dao has already reached the peak.”

Zheng Shen continued, “It’s true that Jian Wushuang’s sword dao has reached the peak, but he’s nothing compared to our lord!”

Lu Liang, another half step Universe God, laughed, “Brother Zheng Shen is right. Jian Wushuang is far too weak compared to our lord.”

“You guys are full of sh*t…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

A sheepish look appeared on Zheng Shen and Lu Liang’s face, but a mischievous light flashed through their eyes.

In fact, they weren’t trying to exaggerate the facts. It was true that no matter how profound Jian Wushuang’s sword dao was, he wouldn’t be able to beat Huang Xiaolong even if he gave it his all!

Strength was everything. Techniques and sword dao might matter in a battle between experts of comparable strength, but when one party was overwhelmingly powerful, there would be no doubts about the resulting battle.

If Jian Wushuang’s combat abilities reached the 23 billion units mark, he might be able to put up a fight with his sword dao. However, Jian Wushuang was far from that.

Huang Xiaolong then retrieved the sword pills.

Huang Xiaolong could feel the sword intent coming from the pills. However, the sword intent in the pills weren’t beneficial to the person who took it. After consuming it, their dao souls would be controlled by Jian Wushuang’s sword intent.

Summoning his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong quickly inspected the sword pills. A sneer formed on his lips. Jian Wushuang branded the pills with his soul. No one weaker than Jian Wushuang would be able to discover the abnormality behind the pills. Too bad for him, Huang Xiaolong was the one playing with the pills.

“Jian Wushuang branded his soul in them.” Huang Xiaolong explained. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Who would have thought that he would resort to such means…” Yu Xiaohong frowned.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care as he tossed both pills into his mouth.

Everyone stared at him, dumbfounded.

“Lord, you…”

“I’m fine… The pills might be able to control Yu Dawei, but they’re useless against me.” Huang Xiaolong explained.

Even though Jian Wushuang’s sword dao was unparalleled, there was no way he could control Huang Xiaolong with his means.

With Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls, Jian Wushuang could unleash his sword intent in front of Huang Xiaolong without Huang Xiaolong taking up any precautions and he wouldn’t be able to tear through the man’s defenses.

The moment Huang Xiaolong swallowed the pills, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes in the palace of the Jian Family.

“Father, this…” Jian Wufeng asked.

“Someone refined both sword pills…”

Jian Wufeng was slightly taken aback. “Could Yu Xiaohong have swallowed the pills the moment she got her hands on them? Is she planning to comprehend the sword dao with the help of the pills?”

“That seems to be the case.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

A look of joy flashed through Jian Wufeng’s face. “If that’s true, lord father will be able to control her! Wouldn’t that mean…” A sinister smile formed on his face when he thought of the possibilities.

Jian Wushuang chuckled, “My soul brand will slowly affect her dao soul now that she swallowed the pills. However, we’ll need several more years for the effects to show.”

“It’s just several years…” Jian Wufeng laughed.

He could already envision Yu Xiaohong turning into his obedient plaything in a few years.

…

After swallowing the pills, Huang Xiaolong felt much greater affinity towards the sword dao.

All of a sudden, someone entered the main hall to make a report. “Lord Ancestor, Eminent Elder Jian Xiyuan of the Jian Family has arrived! He wishes to meet you! He brought along several dozen experts of the Jian Family, and they don’t seem to be here with good intentions!”

Yu Xiaohong glanced at Huang Xiaolong as she wanted to see his intentions.
