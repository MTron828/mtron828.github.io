Chapter 2135: I Will Take Care of You Now!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had never seen the Heavenly Master before, judging from the overwhelming aura that was coming from the old man in front of him, there was no mistake that it was him.

Huang Xiaolong frowned as he looked at the Heavenly Master whose entire body was formed by streams of chaos qi.

It was obviously due to some sort of secret art the Heavenly Master had cultivated. It could be due to the Divine Burial Grand Art, but since his head had yet to turn into chaos qi, it was clear that he hadn’t completely mastered the art.

“Big Brother!” Tian Chen cried out in surprise when the old man appeared.

“Senior Heavenly Master!” Even those who were gasping their last breaths felt a sense of relief when they saw that the Heavenly Master had appeared.

“Your Majesty!”

“Senior Heavenly Master!”

The hundreds of millions of soldiers from the Heavenly World and everyone else bowed down in excitement.

“Rise.” The Heavenly Master’s majestic voice filled the world.

Everyone nodded respectfully as they shakily got to their feet.

As he turned around, the Heavenly Master’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong. It was as though he was looking at an ant he could crush anytime he wanted.

“Big Brother.” Tian Chen hastily ran over to the Heavenly Master and complained, “Huang Xiaolong is simply too lawless! After arriving in the Heavenly World, he killed Di Jing, our Heavenly World law enforcement faction’s disciple! He barged into my personal cultivation palace and killed hundreds of thousands of my personal guards! He raided my treasury and stole everything I had! Not only did he refuse to return my treasures, he even threatened to kill Brother Wan Shi and me!”

Killing intent and hatred spilled out from Tian Chen’s eyes.

The Heavenly Master swept his gaze across Tian Chen and Wan Shi and frowned when he noticed the injury between Wan Shi’s eyebrows. With a single glance, he could tell that the sword wound between his eyebrows had injured the root of his soul and godhead. The injury wasn’t a light one. If he didn’t help Wan Shi immediately, there was almost no chance for Wan Shi to recover.

Everything that had happened was completely out of his expectations.

He had challenged Huang Xiaolong to a fight the day after the wedding ceremony. Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong would wreak havoc in the Heavenly World the moment he entered. Without caring about his reputation, Huang Xiaolong had barged into Tian Chen’s cultivation palace and killed hundreds of thousands of guards! He had even threatened to kill Tian Chen and Wan Shi!

Who was Tian Chen? He was the Heavenly Master’s younger brother!

What about Wan Shi?! As soon as Tian Chen took Wan Xiaorong as his bride, they would be connected by marriage and turn into one big family!

It was clear that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t showing him the slightest bit of respect! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

A cold light flashed through the Heavenly Master’s eyes, and the space around him started to hum.

“It’s been too long since I last appeared before the world... How dare a junior like you barge into my Heavenly World and kill people with such impunity?!” The Heavenly Master stared coldly at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong,I was planning to take care of you the day after tomorrow, but since things have already progressed to this point, I will deal with you now!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered in response, “You old fart, don’t think that just because you are older than me, you’re stronger... Are you even confident in killing me?! If you were, you wouldn’t have set the location of the challenge to be the Heavenly Lake in your Heavenly World!”

If Tian Chen was able to fuse with the source energy of the Heavenly World, there was no doubt the Heavenly Master could do the same! With the Heavenly Master’s strength, he wouldn’t need Wan Shi to assist him if he wanted to carry out the fusion!

The reason he had held the battle in Heavenly Lake was definitely part of his calculations!

Even so, Huang Xiaolong had decided to take him up on the challenge, appearing in the Heavenly World where the Heavenly Master could call upon its source energy.

Actually, barging into Tian Chen’s personal palace to grab the lightning pool and all the origin treasures were part of Huang Xiaolong’s plan. Severely injuring Tian Chen and Wan Shi were all calculated actions. After all, the Heavenly Master wanted to challenge Huang Xiaolong the day after tomorrow. Why should Huang Xiaolong give him the time to complete his cultivation?! Since the old man wanted to delay the battle, Huang Xiaolong would force him out today!

If he had waited for the day after tomorrow, it was possible that the Heavenly Master would master the Divine Burial Grand Art. There was no way Huang Xiaolong would allow his adversary to power up before the eve of the battle.

Everything went according to Huang Xiaolong’s expectations. Looking at the old man’s head, he knew that the Heavenly Master had not completed the Divine Burial Grand Art.

The old man’s face sank as he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

How could someone with his experience in life not know that Huang Xiaolong was mocking him?! It was true. He had no confidence that he could slay Huang Xiaolong if they fought anywhere else. The reason he wanted to fight in the Heavenly Lake was so that he could draw on the source energy of the Heavenly World when things went south.

The Heavenly Master sneered, “B*llsh*t! There is no need for a venerable like me to draw on the Heavenly World’s source energy to kill a mere junior like you!”

“Huang Xiaolong, die!”

The Heavenly Master flipped his palms and sent a strike flying towards Huang Xiaolong.

The two grey palms spanned over hundreds of millions of miles, and it was like everything under them was obliterated into nothingness.

Countless living creatures felt their life force faltering as the palms flew above them.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed.

It seems like his Divine Burial Grand Art can take away the vitality of all living things around it. As long as he can draw energy from creatures around him, he will never run out of energy!

A snort left Huang Xiaolong’s lips as sixteen wings unfurled behind him. Worlds of radiance appeared in the space before him, and the Heart of Hell in Huang Xiaolong’s chest thumped. A drum-like beat filled the world as everyone felt their heads throbbing. It was as though Huang Xiaolong had attacked their soul and a frown formed on the Heavenly Master’s face.

Evidently, even a peak early-Ninth Order Sovereign like him felt threatened by Huang Xiaolong’s Heart of Hell.

No longer giving the Heavenly Master time to react, Huang Xiaolong moved. His three Complete Dao Saint Godheads started to tremble as he punched outwards.

Boom!

It was as if the Heavenly World was struck by Huang Xiaolong’s fists as two giant golden fists collided with the Heavenly Master’s grey palms.

The sky exploded, and brilliant rays of light blinded everyone present. The ground under them split apart as mountain peaks were reduced to dust. Some old ancestor-level figures who were hiding billions of miles away bled from all seven orifices.

The Heavenly World shook as berserk air currents swept through every corner of the world.

When everyone saw the exchange between Huang Xiaolong and the Heavenly Master, terror gripped their hearts.

The impact of the blast sent Huang Xiaolong retreating tens of thousands of miles. However, the Heavenly Master had to retreat as well, and he only managed to regain his footing after flying for thousands of miles. Even though the Heavenly Master had come out on top, his expression sank. According to him, his previous attack was more than enough to turn Huang Xiaolong into a pool of blood. Never in his wildest imaginations had he expected to only barely come out on top!

Huang Xiaolong’s strength had greatly exceeded his expectation.

“Late-Fifth Order Sovereign Realm!” The Heavenly Master stared at Huang Xiaolong as fire spewed out of his eyes.

Didn’t Wan Shi say that Huang Xiaolong was only at the peak of the Late-Fourth Order Sovereign Realm?! How can he be a late-Fifth Order Sovereign?! Did he break through one entire realm in three years?!

This?!

Even though the Heavenly Master revealed a face full of indifference, stormy waves were crashing into his fragile heart.

“It’s no wonder you can hold yourself with such confidence...” The Heavenly Master suppressed the shock in his heart as he sneered, “So what if you are a late-Fifth Order Sovereign? Even if you manage to break into the late-Sixth Order Sovereign Realm, you’ll still have to leave your life behind!”

A tiny coffin appeared in his hands the moment he was done speaking.
