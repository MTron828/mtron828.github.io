Chapter 2875: Let’s Start With You

After seeing the familiar figure, tears flowed down the corners of Long Jianfei’s eyes, and his voice choked with emotions, “Your Highness, you’re here!”

The person who had appeared was naturally Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong clipped Wang Xin’s long sword between two fingers.

After looking at Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng’s bloody and tragic conditions, Huang Xiaolong’s voice was low and glum, “I’m here.”

Yu Zhou, Cheng Dingtian, and the others were shocked and startled by Huang Xiaolong’s sudden appearance.

Your Highness?! Huang Xiaolong didn’t die in the Blue Lotus Pond?!

After being caught off guard for a second, Yu Zhou sneered coldly, “So, you didn’t die inside the Blue Lotus Pond. Your life is quite resilient to have survived for fifteen days inside the Blue Lotus Pond! You probably have some kind of dao artifact on you for protection!”

Yu Zhou subconsciously assumed that Huang Xiaolong had merely stayed fifteen days inside the Blue Lotus Pond.

A cold gleam flickered in the depths of Chen Dingtian’s eyes. He spoke to Huang Xiaolong for the first time, “Are you that shameless brat who used despicable tricks to defeat Junior Brother Zhou Hong? It’s good that you’re alive because I’ll let you die under my Blood Sword today!”

“Quickly release my Junior Brother, and then get on your knees to die!” Yu Zhou barked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong shot a cold glance at Yu Zhou and Chen Dingtian, “Release? Of course, I will.”

Yu Zhou smiled, “At least you’ve got some brain.”

Wang Xin chuckled complacently.

Huang Xiaolong lightly flicked away Wang Xin’s long sword, and the long sword turned into a streak of light, slashing across Wang Xin’s neck.

Wang Xin’s body stood stiffly on the spot. His eyes were wide with shock looking at the long sword in his left hand, and blood spurted from his neck as his neck rolled off his shoulders.

Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, and the others were stupefied.

“Junior Brother Wang!” Yu Zhou bellowed in anger, and his bellow shook the world.

Other Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples were also enraged by Huang Xiaolong’s action.

Wang Xin’s headless body tumbled to the ground, raising a curtain of dust. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

These disciples’ enraged shouts were ignored by Huang Xiaolong. He walked towards Long Jianfei and opened his palm. There was a silvery golden drop of liquid suspended above his palm, exuding a soft, captivating glow.

“Blue, blue lotus nectar!” Chen Dingtian exclaimed in surprise. This brat actually obtained blue lotus nectar inside the Blue Lotus Pond?

“Open your mouth and swallow this!” Huang Xiaolong ordered Long Jianfei.

Blue lotus nectar was not only useful for one’s cultivation, but also a panacea for injuries. It worked better than the highest grade healing holy pills.

Long Jianfei opened his mouth to refuse because something like the blue lotus nectar was too precious, and he couldn’t accept it. But, just as he opened his mouth to speak, Huang Xiaolong had already flicked the drop of blue lotus nectar into his mouth.

The moment the blue lotus nectar entered Long Jianfei’s mouth, it turned into a source of vigorous water-attributed energy.

In the blink of an eye, Long Jianfei was enshrouded in a cocoon of flickering blue light.

Every time the blue light flickered, one-tenth of Long Jianfei’s injuries would heal, and in a few seconds, his strength had recovered by about thirty to forty percent!

Long Jianfei’s injuries were the heaviest amongst the three, and many parts of his body had been pierced through by swords that one could catch glimpses of his internal organs as he moved. But now, these bloody sword holes had mended and scabbed!

Some ruddiness returned to Long Jianfei’s pale face.

“You guys open your mouths,” Huang Xiaolong extended his palm as he ordered Duan Feng and Duan Zheng. When he opened his palm, there were another two drops of blue lotus nectar suspended in the air.

“What?!”

Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, and the others were astonished when they saw Huang Xiaolong take out another two drops of blue lotus nectar. What was more surprising to them was that Huang Xiaolong was willing to give these blue lotus nectar to Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng to heal their injuries!

These are blue lotus nectar, ah!

It could be used in pill refining, healing injuries, enhancing cultivation, and it had many other uses!

The rarer the item, the more valuable it was, and one drop of blue lotus nectar could sometimes fetch as high as one hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins at an auction!

One hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins, not holy coins!

Yet Huang Xiaolong simply had his subordinates swallow the very precious blue lotus nectar, that too, three drops of them!

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong had sent the two drops of blue lotus nectar into Duan Feng and Duan Zheng’s mouths, respectively, and their injuries healed at speed visible to the naked eye like Long Jianfei’s.

Similarly, Huang Xiaolong also sent one drop each to the Immemorial Ice and Fire Qilin to heal their injuries.

Seeing this, Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, and the others felt as if someone had pricked their hearts with a needle.

My heart is aching…

Anyone could see that the Immemorial Ice and Fire Qilin’s injuries weren’t very severe. A common top-grade holy pill was sufficient to heal their injuries. Yet, Huang Xiaolong still gave the two Immemorial Ice and Fire Qilins a drop of blue lotus nectar each!

Those were two hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins right there!

Two hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins could buy a luxurious mansion in any of the Dragon Fish Creed’s main cities.

Two hundred thousand Tuoshen dao coins could buy a grand dao level flying ship, powerful bloodline divine beast mounts, and many, many things.

Perhaps witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s wasteful behavior with five drops of blue lotus nectar was so shocking that Yu Zhou, and Chen Dingtian forgot to attack for a moment.

After seeing that Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and the others’ injuries were taken care of for now, Huang Xiaolong turned and looked at Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, and their groups.

“It seems like you didn’t put my words to heart,” Huang Xiaolong stated coldly, and his words were directed at Chen Dingtian.

Chen Dingtian looked confused, as if he didn’t understand what Huang Xiaolong meant.

“At White Feather City, I had said that if anyone from Ten Swords Creed comes looking to cause trouble for me, I will destroy that person’s dao physique and completely abolish him!” Huang Xiaolong repeated icily.

“Punk, what did you say?!” The present Ten Swords Creed’s disciples shouted angrily, pointing their swords at Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Dingtian pressed his hand in the air to calm the Ten Swords Creed’s disciples, and then threw his head back and laughed sonorously, “According to your words, you’re going to destroy my dao physique now, are you? Completely abolish me?” His face was full of mockery as he looked at Huang Xiaolong condescendingly. “Punk, you defeated Junior Brother Zhou Hong, so I admit you have some ability. However, your little bit of strength is no different than an ant’s in my eyes. I, Chen Dingtian, am a half-step Dao Venerable, and I have defeated a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable expert in the past!”

Defeated mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable!

This was Chen Dingtian’s proudest feat in his life so far.

Then again, defeating a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable expert with the strength of a half-step Dao Venerable was indeed something to be proud of.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled nonchalantly after hearing that, “Merely a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable. Many years ago, I abused a Second Esteem Dao Venerable like a dog!”

Immediately after the words left Hunag Xiaolong’s lips, it was met with whoops of laughter.

Yu Zhou clutched his stomach with one hand and pointed at Huang Xiaolong with the other, “Many years ago, you abused a Second Esteem Dao Venerable like a dog? Why don’t you say that you’ve been killing Third Esteem Dao Venerables like killing ants?!!”

The Dragon Fish Creed and Ten Swords Creed’s experts were all laughing till their faces turned red.

Sounds of laughter reverberated in the air for a long time.

Huang Xiaolong stood with his hands clasped behind him, watching these people laugh uncontrollably.

Duan Feng, and Long Jianfei glared ferociously at Yu Zhou for mocking Huang Xiaolong.

When Yu Zhou, Chen Dingtian, and the rest had finally laughed their fill, Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent gaze was fixed on Yu Zhou. “Let’s start with you.”

Start with me? Yu Zhou repeated inwardly in confusion.

Huang Xiaolong disappeared into a flicker, and arrived in front of Yu Zhou almost instantaneously, and punched out with his fist!

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong’s punch landed hard and accurately.
