Chapter 2509: You’re Not Qualified

No one would have thought that Huang Xiaolong would appear with Lin Xiaoying.

After a short silence, Su Biqing rejoiced in his heart.

When they had entered the Ghost Devil City, Dou Rui was on Huang Xiaolong’s to-kill list, but Huang Xiaolong was on the hit-list of all the disciples of the Devil Palace!

In the past few days, everyone had been looking for him!

Of course, there were tons of disciples who wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong. The Devil Palace was only one of the powers behind them!

When Chen Yi and the others saw Huang Xiaolong, they were stunned. However, his expression soon changed. “Junior Brother Huang, it’s too dangerous here! Run! Run away now!”

Chen Yi knew that there were too many people who wanted to kill Huang Xiaolong.

Even if Su Biqing and Xiao Lengxue weren’t there, there were tons of people ready to move against him.

However, Huang Xiaolong seemed to ignore his warnings as he continued to approach the blood stele.

Su Biqing and Xiao Lengxue, who wanted to block off all avenues of his retreat, froze. Even though they were a little confused, they didn’t think too much about it. After all, Huang Xiaolong was basically sending himself to the gates of hell.

When he arrived beside Chen Yi, he handed over an origin spiritual pill that was used to cure wounds.

“Junior Brother Huang, why did you…?”

He had never thought that Huang Xiaolong would ignore his warnings.

“It’s fine.” A faint smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “They can’t do anything to me.”

Chen Yi stared at him in stunned silence and so did everyone else present.

Su Biqing burst into laughter the next moment. “Huang Xiaolong, are you f*cking mad? Do you really think that we can’t kill you?!” He was extremely amused. He didn’t know where Huang Xiaolong got his confidence from.

However, his gaze soon fell on Lin Xiaoying. “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that the little lass beside you can protect you from all of us?”

Xiao Lengxue, and the other disciples started laughing.

Even Bai Buren and She Nanfeng failed to hold it in.

The only person who wasn’t laughing was Lin Xiaoying. She stared at Su Biqing and Xiao Lengxue with an extremely complicated gaze. There was a trace of pity in her eyes as she knew that they were about to suffer a terrible fate.

Su Biqing would definitely suffer a fate worse than Dou Rui…

“Junior Brother Huang, leave immediately. We’ll hold them off for as long as we can,” Chen Yi pleaded with Huang Xiaolong.

“You Highness, leave now! We will protect you from the members of the Devil Palace!” Another disciple behind Chen Yi hurried.

Everyone tried to persuade Huang Xiaolong, but he shook his head and smiled at them. “The blood stele is still there. There’s no need to leave.”

The world started to spin before their eyes.

Xiao Lengxue couldn’t help but sneer, “Why are you still thinking about the blood stele when you’re about to die? Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that no one will dare to kill you with your identity as the disciple of the four Primal Ancestors? To us, you’re a stray dog by the side of the street we can kill anytime we like!”

Su Biqing continued, “He’s just a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint. Senior Brother Xiao, there’s no need for you to dirty your hands.” As soon as he spoke, he rushed at Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Yi’s expression changed.

With his hands clasped behind his back, Huang Xiaolong stared at Su Biqing. “If you can take a single attack from me, I’ll let you live.”

Su Biqing froze in his steps, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong with an incredulous look in his eyes. He roared with laughter in the next moment. “You’ll spare me?! Bullsh*t! Huang Xiaolong you really managed to frighten me with all the crap you spewed. Here’s a suggestion. If you can take on a strike from me with half my strength, I’ll kneel on the ground and call you my ancestor!”

Su Biqing was angered beyond belief by what Huang Xiaolong said.

“There’s no need for that. You’re not qualified,” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and chuckled softly.

Su Biqing nearly exploded in rage. Was he not qualified to be Huang Xiaolong’s descendant?!

Bai Buren and the others had a feeling that Huang Xiaolong was crazy. If he wasn’t crazy, how could he speak of such things?

“Hahaha! I’m not qualified! I’m not qualified to be your descendant!” Killing intent emerged from his body as a sea of dark green poisonous qi surged towards Huang Xiaolong.

When everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong was about to be crushed into meat paste, a golden figure emerged from his head. Before anyone could react, golden light filled their surroundings, and Su Biqing was sent flying.

Su Biqing crashed into the blood stele and his arrogant appearance could no longer be seen.

A buzzing sound filled the skies as Su Biqing’s blood flowed off the surface of the blood stele.

With his blood, the stele seemed to shine even more brilliantly.

Xiao Lengxue was shocked.

He wasn’t the only one as everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

The only person who wasn’t surprised was Lin Xiaoying.

None of them looked at Su Biqing’s sorry appearance. Instead, everyone’s gaze was fixed on the golden figure behind Huang Xiaolong. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Holy soul!

Like everyone else who had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands, a trace of disbelief flashed through the minds of everyone present.

One of the disciples who was there to watch the show kicked the disciple in front of him, and a wretched cry rang through the skies. “Why did you kick me?!”

“Oh sh*t! I’m not dreaming!”

In a fit of rage, the disciple who was kicked turned around and sent the other party flying. “Of course, it’s real!”

Xiao Lengxue, Bai Buren, She Nanfeng, and everyone else who thought that they were dreaming snapped back to attention. The cry broke through the last line of defenses in their heart.

Huang Xiaolong really formed his holy soul!

As they stared at the golden figure, they couldn’t shift their gaze anywhere else.

“Xiao Lengxue, it’s your turn,” Huang Xiaolong’s voice cut through the air.

Finally regaining his sanity, Xiao Lengxue glared at Huang Xiaolong and a weird feeling welled up in his heart. He sucked in a cold breath, and he spoke to Bai Buren, “Brother Bai, Huang Xiaolong has killed too many disciples of the Holy Lands Alliance. Aren’t you thinking of taking revenge?”

Turning to She Nanfeng, he continued, “Brother Nanfeng, I’m sure the Holy Race won’t allow Huang Xiaolong to keep growing. If he’s allowed to mature, I’m afraid even if everyone joins hands, we’ll be exterminated by this brat!”

His objective was clear. He wanted to pull them both into an alliance to slay Huang Xiaolong!
