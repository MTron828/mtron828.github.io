Chapter 2050: Massacre!

Shi Ming circulated the corpse qi around his body as he sent a slap flying towards the little chaos axe.

It was too bad the little chaos axe dissipated before Shi Ming’s palm could strike it. With a loud explosion, Shi Ming’s palm tore a huge hole in the space before him.

When Huang Xiaolong recalled his little chaos axe, Lun Zhuan appeared in the space above the Ancient Heavenly Court as he slammed the wheel in his hand downwards. Everything happened too suddenly, and no one managed to react in time.

Just as the wheel was about to slice Huang Xiaolong in two, starlight poured out from the Complete Heaven Palace and appeared in the space between Huang Xiaolong and the wheel. As three hundred and thirty-six stars appeared, they formed a massive sea of stars that stood in between Huang Xiaolong and Lun Zhuan’s attack.

Lun Zhuan’s weapon was sent flying when it collided with the world of stars, and a horrifying backlash sent Lun Zhuan flying backward. Even after Lun Zhuan’s sneak attack, the world of stars remained solid, and there wasn’t even a slightest bit of damage on it.

When the Old Crow Ancestor and other overlords at his level saw what happened, their faces fell.

The Ancient Heavenly Court possessed shockingly strong defense capabilities! Even with Huang Xiaolong’s control, it could probably stand toe-to-toe with the Godly Mt. Xumi in Shi Zhen’s hands.

Despite the shock that the Ancient Heavenly Court brought everyone, Shi Ming stared at Huang Xiaolong, and he exclaimed in shock, “You... You broke through to the Eighth Order Emperor Realm?!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What?! Eighth Order Emperor Realm?!”

Everyone couldn’t help but turn their attention back to Huang Xiaolong. After Shi Ming’s reminder, they realized that the Ancient Heavenly Court’s appearance wasn’t the most shocking thing they would be seeing. Huang Xiaolong had actually managed to enter the Eighth Order Emperor Realm in such a short amount of time!

How was it possible?!

When the war had started, Huang Xiaolong was at the mid-Second Order Emperor Realm. How many years had it been since the start of the battle? Thirty years? Huang Xiaolong managed to break through six entire stages in the span of thirty years!

Wouldn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong would step into the Sovereign Realm in the span of a hundred years?!

As soon as he entered the Sovereign Realm, everyone was afraid that the only person who could hold him down would be Lord Wan Shi of the City of All-Heavens.

Shi Ming’s expression turned ugly to the extreme.

Yang Gang, who had barely missed the gates of hell, stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. He had long since gathered enough information about Huang Xiaolong before the start of the final battle.

Right now, there was a fire burning in his eyes as he thought about the different possibilities in his mind. He knew that Huang Xiaolong had a heaven-shaking secret hidden in him as it was basically impossible for anyone to break through six levels in the Emperor Realm in thirty short years.

Huang Xiaolong saw the look in Yang Gang’s eyes, and he sneered, “So what if I have to go against the City of All-Heavens? The City of All-Heavens can’t represent the myriad of worlds...”

“Well said!” A cheer resounded through the air as the Reverence Moon Old Man, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others emerged from the barrier surrounding the Myriad Spirits City. Behind them were the bishops, archbishops, and the experts from the various worlds.

There was a look of joy on their faces as they had seen the awe-inspiring sight when Huang Xiaolong killed his way through the Radiance Divine Army.

They finally saw a trace of hope when Huang Xiaolong barged into the Ancient Heavenly Court fight.

After all, he was controlling the Ancient Heavenly Court! The number one treasure in all the lands!

Even powerhouses at their level couldn’t slight the owner of the Ancient Heavenly Court!

Previously, the Godly Mt. Xumi had nearly driven the Reverence Moon Old Man into despair as he could not break its defense. Now that they had the Ancient Heavenly Court on their side, there was no need to fear the Godly Mt Xumi any longer!

“Master, Dean Reverence Moon, Senior Mutian...” Huang Xiaolong quickly greeted the few old men, who had held the fort in his absence.

The Reverence Moon Old Man stared at the majestic structure below them, and he laughed, “Brat, you didn’t tell us that you went out to look for this... Hahaha! Great! With the Ancient Heavenly Court, we will no longer be afraid of those birds!”

Hearing the analogy that seemed to be directed at him, the Old Crow Ancestor revealed a dark expression.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he turned around to stare at Shi Ming and the others. A confident declaration soon left his lips. “I’ll deal with anyone at the First Order Sovereign Realm or weaker. Leave them to me!”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

The experts on Dun Ei’s side couldn’t help but feel rage bubbling in their hearts. Huang Xiaolong was too impudent! The fire in their eyes burned bright as they wanted to tear Huang Xiaolong into pieces. There were more than ten thousand Emperors on Dun Ei’s side, but Huang Xiaolong wanted to take them all on! As if that wasn’t enough, he called out the First Order Sovereigns as well!

“Hahaha! Great!” The King of Grandmist was the first to break the silence in the air as he cheered for Huang Xiaolong.

He was extremely confident in Huang Xiaolong. After all, this disciple of his had always surprised him.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t care whether or not the Radiance Divine Army was ready for his attack. He rose into the sky as he summoned the Radiance Divine Scepter, Heavenly Hall, and Radiance Divine Seal before charging towards Dun Ei and the others.

When they saw that Huang Xiaolong had left the protective formation of the Ancient Heavenly Court, the King of Shadows, Lun Zhuan, and the other old monsters attacked at the same time.

“Die!”

The five overlords’ combined might was enough to shatter the heavens, but they directed their attacks on a single man.

The Reverence Moon Old Man snorted as the staff in his hand shot out towards the five of them. “Kill!”

The little cow, the King of Darkness, Du Hai, the King of Grandmist, Cang Mutian, and the others started their assault as they charged towards the Sovereigns on the other side.

Boom!

Both sides clashed with the intensity of a supernova.

The Radiance World shook as terrifying shockwaves tore through space. It was as though the Radiance World was turned upside down.

When Lun Zhuan and the others clashed with the Reverence Moon Old Man and the rest, they were sent retreating.

Without the need to care about the overlord-level characters on the other side, Huang Xiaolong quickly killed his way into the bulk of the Radiance Divine Army. The Divine Radiance Scepter in his hand pierced through the bodies of several Tenth Order Emperors protecting Dun Ei. Regardless of whether they were late-Tenth Order Emperors or peak late-Tenth Order Emperors, all of them turned into human kebabs.

“Huang Xiaolong, go to hell!” Chiyou roared as he appeared in the space behind Huang Xiaolong. He raised his palms and slapped towards Huang Xiaolong with all the strength he could muster.

It was too bad the Heart of Hell in Huang Xiaolong’s chest started to emit rays of resplendent light that caused the hearts of everyone around him to tremble. Chiyou couldn’t withstand the sudden attack from the Heart of Hell, and he faltered for a moment. One moment was all Huang Xiaolong needed as the Divine Radiance Scepter in his hand shot backwards and pierced towards Chiyou’s chest.

Ever since Huang Xiaolong had entered the high-level Emperor Realm, his combat strength had reached a level never seen before. Now that he was at the Eighth Order Emperor Realm, the strength the Heart of Hell possessed was several times stronger than before. With the Lotus of Darkness to assist him, even First Order Sovereigns would be unable to completely ignore the Heart of Hell’s attack.

When Chiyou returned to his senses, Huang Xiaolong’s Radiance Divine Scepter was already piercing through his body. The divine armor on Chiyou’s body stood no chance as the scepter emerged from the other side of his body.

Terrifying amounts of radiance energy wreaked havoc in Chiyou’s body, and as Huang Xiaolong swung the Radiance Divine Scepter, Chiyou was sent flying. Not wasting a second, Huang Xiaolong turned around and made another human skewer. None of the pontiffs who charged into the battle were able to escape from Huang Xiaolong’s attack. Wherever Huang Xiaolong went, he formed fountains of blood, and miserable shrieks sounded like a choir.

Qin Fan, who was originally planning to join hands with Chiyou to deal with Huang Xiaolong, froze in his place as his expression changed to one of fear.

Anyone under the Sovereign Realm was like an ant. However, Huang Xiaolong changed his worldview today. An Eighth Order Emperor like Huang Xiaolong sent a Sovereign Realm expert like Chiyou flying!

Even though Chiyou had barely entered the Sovereign Realm, his actual combat strength was akin to a mid-First Order Sovereign. Even Qin Fan would find it difficult to defeat Chiyou in a one-on-one battle!
