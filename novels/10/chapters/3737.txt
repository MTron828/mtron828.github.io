Chapter 3738: Nine Cauldron Land

 

“So that’s what it is…” Huang Xiaolong felt as though a veil was lifted before him. He comprehended the mysteries behind the Nameless Devil Mirror, but he felt as though something was missing. 

Now, he finally understood.

In order to break through to the Universe God Realm, it wasn’t enough to only comprehend the mysteries behind the Thirteen Universes. One also had to understand the laws of the Origin Universe!Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Thirteen Universes were born from the Universe Origin, and they could be considered its child.

As such, they would only be able to reach a state of perfection when they were combined!

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief after his discovery.

Without his Nameless Devil Mirror, it would be useless even if the Black Nether King and Old Man Fortune comprehended the mirror in the Devil Mirror Palace. Their chances of breaking through were slim to none.

However, Huang Xiaolong didn’t discover anything about the Black Nether King or Old Man Fortune from the beast’s memories. It seemed as though they hadn’t arrived yet. Otherwise, they went into hiding the moment they did.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. It was too easy to obtain news on the Devil Mirror Palace. If either of them entered the Origin Universe, they would have learned of it too. When the palace appeared, they would definitely run into each other.

The Devil Mirror Palace was split into the outer palace and the inner palace. The beast Huang Xiaolong caught had only been to the outer palace. The number of people who could enter the inner palace were peak experts in the Origin Universe.

According to what the beast knew, there were four regions surrounding them and only one expert was qualified to enter the inner palace. He was called the Heaven Sage Human Emperor.

He was an expert of the Human Race, and he was one of the ten strongest experts in the Origin Universe. He had 27 billion units of combat strength.

“Heaven Sage Human Emperor…”

As long as Huang Xiaolong found him, he would understand the situation in the inner palace. He could actually determine if the devil mirror was of the same type as his own! Moreover, comprehending the devil mirror would be much easier when he knew what was going to happen in there.

The biggest problem was locating the other party!

Huang Xiaolong leaped onto the beast and flew deeper into the continent.

The beast was called a Jade Eyed Beast and even in the Origin Universe, it was a supreme existence. It had an ancient supreme bloodline and it flew extremely quickly. It wasn’t any slower than the beasts in the Thirteen Universes that had 15 billion units of combat strength. If Pangu used his full strength, he would probably be as quick as the Jade Eyed Beast!

However, Huang Xiaolong discovered a human being surrounded by two beasts on his way towards the central region. Casually saving the human, he subdued both beasts.

The man was a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. Comparable to Pangu in strength, the man wasn’t weak at all! As for the two beasts, they were both Golden Lions. One of them was male and the other was female. Their strength was comparable to the Jade Eyed Beast Huang Xiaolong rode on.

Seeing as he was saved, the expert thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely, “Many thanks to senior for saving my life!” 

Huang Xiaolong waved his arms casually. 

Soon after, the group of them traveled out of the forest.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong learned that the man was called Peng Xian, and he was the old ancestor of the Peng Family.

The ancestor of the Peng Family entered the Heavenly Phoenix Forest in order to look for the egg of a Heavenly Phoenix. He wanted to refine a pill using the egg of the godly creature, and he managed to accomplish his goal. It was too bad he was discovered by the lions before he could leave.

Peng Xian muttered in embarrassment, “If not for the senior’s help, I wouldn’t be able to leave this forest today.” 

It didn't take long for him to invite Huang Xiaolong to his Peng Family.

“In a few days, I will be celebrating my ten-billionth birthday. I will invite the experts in the region over, and I hope that I will get the honor of hosting an esteemed senior in my family!” Peng Xian explained.

Seeing the sincere expression on Peng Xian’s face, Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Alright, since I have nowhere to go anyway.” 

An awkward smile formed on Peng Xian’s face. “Senior definitely broke through the 10 billion combat abilities mark. How can you have nowhere to go?”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. 

Not planning to explain his strength, he spoke of his current situation. “I came to the Nine Cauldron Land not too long ago.”

Peng Xian thought that Huang Xiaolong came from some other continent and asked, “Senior, are you also here to obtain the Nine Cauldrons?”

“?” Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow casually.

“There have been rumors that the Guardian Treasure will soon appear in the continent. Many experts have flocked over from all over the Origin Universe in order to try their luck at obtaining it,” Peng Xian explained. 

“So that’s the case…” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Huang Xiaolong knew what a guardian treasure was. In the Origin Universe, every single continent had its own guardian treasure. There were some who obtained the guardian treasures of some random continent, and there were continents whose treasures remained ownerless.

The Nine Cauldrons of the Nine Cauldron Land hadn’t been claimed by anyone, and it was an opportunity for the experts in the Origin Universe! 

Huang Xiaolong also knew that the strength of the guardian treasures was slightly worse than his universe treasures.

Of course, they were still stronger than pseudo-universe treasures.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Peng Family Manor.

The manor was located in the Imperial Dragon City, and it was one of the largest cities in the Nine Cauldron Land. Peng Xian might be a God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage, but his family wasn’t considered part of the strongest few in the city. 

As Peng Xian had been around for ten billion years, there were several hundred experts attending his birthday celebration even though he wasn’t the old ancestor of a peak-level family.

When Huang Xiaoong arrived, there was only a single day left until the banquet. As such, the festivities were in full swing. Several God of Creation Realm experts who arrived earlier had already entered the manor.

Peng Xian personally arranged for Huang Xiaolong’s lodgings in the manor.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had no other instructions, Peng Xian returned to his palace. 

As soon as he did, his son, Peng Ze, could be seen waiting in the main hall.

“Father, you’re back!” Peng Ze bowed.

Seeing the look on his son’s face, Peng Xian knew that something was up. “What’s going on?”

After a slight hesitation, Peng Ze explained, “Father, I heard that Wang Kaifei from the Eastern Plains has returned…” 

“What?! He’s still alive?!” Peng Xian’s expression changed slightly.

Wang Kaifei was the old ancestor of the Wang Family in the Imperial Dragon City. The Wang and Peng families had always been at odds. The Peng Family had always been weaker than them, and when the Wang Family’s old ancestor went out in search of opportunities, there were rumors saying that he died in recent years. 

As such, the Peng Family started suppressing the Wang Family in recent years.

Who would have thought that Wang Kaifei would return?!

As an existence who was a half-step Universe God, Wang Kaifei’s return spelled trouble for the Peng Family.
