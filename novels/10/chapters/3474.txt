Chapter 3475: Alliance!

“Pass down my order to the three ancestors. As long as they trap Huang Xiaolong and Pangu, I’ll not only agree to any of their requests, but I’ll even give them a piece of creation artifact each!” Meng Tian growled.

The grand marshal gasped when he heard Meng Tian’s promise. One creation artifact each?! That would mean that he would give out three of them! He would also owe them a favor!

Wouldn’t it be a little too much to give?

Whatever the case, he was just there to convey the message. No longer dallying, he conveyed Meng Tian’s order to the three ancestors of the Azure Bamboo Mountain.

At the same time, Meng Tian shot towards the Azure Bamboo Mountain while notifying everyone under his banner to head over.

“Huang Xiaolong, Pangu, just wait!” A cold light shot out from Meng Tian’s eyes.

As long as the three ancestors worked together, they would be able to trap Huang Xiaolong and Pangu! The moment he arrived, the two of them would be toast!

However, he received an urgent report not too long after he left the Meng Tian World.

The three ancestors of the Azure Bamboo Mountain agreed to form an alliance with Huang Xiaolong and Pangu!

“This… This isn’t possible!”

“How did they manage to get the three ancestors over to their side?!” Meng Tian’s expression turned nasty when he read the report sent by the grand marshal.

He could’t understand what conditions Huang Xiaolong and Pangu gave the three ancestors.

Meng Tian’s expression was gloomy, and he gnashed his teeth together, “Azure Bamboo Ancestors, you’re tired of living!”

He had paid countless visits to the three ancestors of the Azure Bamboo Mountain over his years of existence. He had tempted them with countless treasures and extraordinary treatment, but they never agreed to join his alliance.

Everyone knew that Huang Xiaolong and Pangu were his targets after his announcement hundreds of years ago, but they still chose to form an alliance with him! In his eyes, they were doing it on purpose.

It seemed as though they didn’t respect him at all!

“Since that’s the case, I’ll bury all of you with them,” Meng Tian growled before hurrying over to the Azure Bamboo Mountain.

He made a decision to capture Huang Xiaolong and Pangu before razing the Azure Bamboo Mountain to the ground regardless of the price he had to pay!

…

Half a month later…

In the Azure Bamboo Mountain.

Huang Xiaolong was sitting with Pangu and the three ancestors as they enjoyed a cup of wine together.

A massive blast interrupted them and the mountain trembled continuously.

“Meng Tian is here.” Huang Xiaolong sneered and they disappeared from the hall. All of them appeared above the mountain instantly.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A massive army surrounded the Azure Bamboo Mountain, and they were led by Meng Tian and his group of Gods of Creation! All twenty-three of them arrived.

The giant army from the various celestial empires stood behind them, and they blocked out the skies.

The grand lineup was something never seen before in the history of the Meng Tian Universe.

When Meng Tian saw Huang Xiaolong and the others, killing intent filled his eyes.

“Very good! Huang Xiaolong, Pangu, who would have thought that you would stay behind like obedient little dogs. You saved me a lot of trouble. Since you have chosen death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

The leader of the three ancestors of the Azure Bamboo Mountain, Ceng Rui, muttered, “Meng Tian, what makes you think that the outcome of the battle has already been decided? You should leave right now before you drown yourself in this mess.”

“Ceng Rui, I feel really sorry for you. You chose to barge through the gates of hell even after I provided you a road to endless comfort. All of you will die today!” Meng Tian sneered.

“Meng Tian, you mother f*cker!” Pangu roared in anger, “The only reason you captured me was because I fell into your trap years ago! You’re nothing but a disgusting fly in my eyes!”

Meng Tian’s expression sank once again. “Pangu, rest assured that I’ll fill your life with a million times the pain compared to before.”

“Attack!”

Huang Muyang and the rest launched their attacks at once.

As for the troop behind them, they started their assault on the Azure Bamboo Mountain.

As soon as they sprang into action, eighteen figures soared into the sky to surround Huang Muyang and the rest.

When they released their aura, the universe trembled.

Huang Muyang and the others were shocked by the sudden change, but they failed to evade a sneak attack from experts who were just as strong as they were. They were sent tumbling through the air while vomiting mouthfuls of blood.

“Chen Yihui, you…” Huang Muyang stared at the newcomers in disbelief.

All of them were experts who had refused to join either Meng Tian or Zhao Jinkun. Now…

Meng Tian was equally as shocked. However, he seemed to understand what Huang Xiaolong planned the moment they appeared.

“You… All of you chose to form an alliance with them?!”

How didn’t I receive any news on this matter?! With so many Gods of Creation joining forces, there should’ve been a huge disturbance in the universe!

Turning to look at Huang Xiaolong and Pangu, he growled, “You did this on purpose!”

Huang Xiaolong and Pangu released the news of their alliance with the three ancestors of the Azure Bamboo Mountain in order to draw them over. They were drawn into a trap!

“No sh*t?” Pangu chuckled. “Meng Tian, since you came here today, forget about returning!” The Pangu Axe in his hand slashed towards Meng Tian instantly. The three ancestors leaped into action and focused on Meng Tian too. That was their strategy for the battle. They would suppress Meng Tian momentarily while Huang Xiaolong dealt with Huang Muyang, Bei Ting, and the others!

Huang Xiaolong arrived before Bei Ting and Shi Li instantly. When they saw him, it was as though they ran into the most terrifying of beasts, and they retreated in haste.

The Huang Long Twin Blades chopped towards them before they had time to think. When it came into contact with their bodies, a giant wound formed on their chests.

A terrifying wave of sword qi appeared behind Huang Xiaolong when he launched his attack, and he raised his eyebrows in shock. Raising the Huang Long Twin Blades to protect himself, he felt a sharp pain shooting up his arms after blocking the strike.

Before he could steady himself, the second round of attack commenced.
