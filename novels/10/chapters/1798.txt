Colorful Balloons Take Flight

As the words left Di Jing’s lips, a terrifying light possessing the might of a million suns filled the plaza, and devastating power swept through the area.

The Heavenly Dao Godhead started to transform.

A different kind of radiance burst out from within the godhead.

“This is...?!”

Everyone widened their eyes in shock as they stared at the scene before them.

A brilliant radiance containing all the world’s radiance shot out in all directions and covered the world.

Along with the burst of light, the godhead continued its transformation.

In the end, it formed chains of runes that floated in the air.

“Heavenly Dao Runes!”

Everyone swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

The light covering the sky formed lines after lines of runes, and the figure of a dragon slowly appeared in mid-air. The Heavenly Dao Runes formed its body, and the massive dragon seemed to turn into a support pillar for the heavens.

The Heavenly Dao Runes’ appearance caused even the strongest Emperors standing in the plaza to feel suppressed. Their godheads felt a sense of pressure like never before. If Emperors at the First Order Emperor Realm felt their powers being suppressed by a tenth before the Heavenly Dao Godhead’s transformation, thirty percent of their powers were gone after the transformation.

The lower their cultivation level, the stronger the suppression!

As for cultivators in the same realm as Di Jing, they felt as though their godhead had frozen solid. They were utterly unable to feel the slightest bit of godforce circulating in their body!

They couldn’t feel their godhead, and neither could they circulate their godforce!

What in the world was going on?!

Everyone felt a shiver running down their spine.

No one knew that Heavenly Prince Di Jing was such a terrifying existence.

As for Di Jing, his body was covered by the Heavenly Dao Runes, and mesmerizing light revolved around him.

Even though his entire body was covered in runes, no one felt that he looked strange. Instead, he looked like he possessed the most perfect body in the world, without the slightest blemish.

Di Jing stood in the air calmly, and a look of indifference hung on his face. He stared at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Huang Xiaolong, no one in the same realm as me can hold their head up high under the suppression of my Heavenly Dao Godhead. They won’t even be able to use their godforce. Look at yourself. You’re just a Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch. Why don’t you try rotating your three king of supreme godheads?”

He had absolute confidence that under the suppression of his Heavenly Dao Godhead, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to resist in the slightest.

That was the real reason why his Heavenly Dao Godhead was ranked as the number one godhead in all of existence.

As long as Huang Xiaolong was unable to use his three king of supreme godheads, Di Jing was confident of killing Huang Xiaolong even if he had three Archdevil bloodlines.

Right now, he felt that his strength had more than doubled with the help of the Heavenly Dao Runes. As for Huang Xiaolong, his strength should have been reduced by more than half since he could not use his godheads.

Godforce was the basis of one’s strength!

Without godforce, one wouldn’t be much different from a fish on a chopping board.

“DIE!”

Di Jing’s body blurred, and his fist appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

Despite his best efforts to return the punch with one of his own, Huang Xiaolong moved a little too late. He was sent flying by Di Jing’s punch, and he crashed into the edge of the arena.

Di Jing chuckled to himself. “Huang Xiaolong, you shall have a taste of my strength!” As soon as he was done speaking, he sent out another punch towards Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad he missed his target as his fist smashed into the True Emperor Stage. A massive crater was formed, but Huang Xiaolong was nowhere to be seen.

Di Jing and the spectators widened their eyes in shock.

“You’re right. The Heavenly Dao Godhead is indeed heaven-defying. However, I guess that’s all you can do...” A lazy voice echoed through the air, and Di Jing spun his head around in shock. He couldn’t even see when Huang Xiaolong had arrived behind him.

“How are you not injured?!” Di Jing’s heart sank as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, who looked completely unaffected by his punch. He was extremely sure that his attack had connected with Huang Xiaolong! How can he stand before me as nothing has happened?! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Of course, he was more surprised at the fact that he wasn’t able to see how Huang Xiaolong had managed to dodge his attack.

According to logic, Huang Xiaolong should be unable to keep up with him due to his godhead’s suppression.

Could it be that Huang Xiaolong was still able to utilize his godheads?! It was impossible! He had personally verified that there was no fluctuation of godforce when Huang Xiaolong had made his move!

Disregarding his shock, Huang Xiaolong stared at Di Jing without replying. Di Jing’s expression turned frosty, and anger overwhelmed him. Just before he could begin another wave of attack, a horrifying surge of light erupted from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Huang Xiaolong’s body was like a broken dam that could no longer hold back the radiance energy contained within him. An unstoppable wave of radiance energy enveloped the plaza.

“This... What is this?! This isn’t godforce?! Huang Xiaolong didn’t even circulate his godforce!” One of the ancestors standing in the plaza exclaimed in shock.

“This is the purest type of radiance energy! It originates from the Radiance World, and it’s the source of all radiance energy!” An ancestor of the Brightness Emperor Palace stuttered in shock.

The members of the Brightness Emperor Palace couldn’t be clearer on the source of all radiance energies.

That was because all of their techniques were based on using radiance energy as its source. It was said that the founder of their Brightness Emperor Palace was a supreme expert of his generation.

“This?!” Even Di Jun’s expression changed when Huang Xiaolong made his move.

He was surprised when Huang Xiaolong revealed his godheads, and he was also shocked when Huang Xiaolong showed his Archdevil bloodlines. Right now, he was more than shocked.

Several billions of years ago, even before the Desolate Era... There weren’t just five Great Worlds! There were six! Other than the Divine World, Demonic World, Devil World, Buddha World, and Hell, there was another Great World! It was the Radiance World!

In the past, the Radiance World ranked high above the other five. It was hailed as the greatest of worlds!

However, many Emperor Realm ancestors were unaware of this information.

In the past, the Radiance World had swept through the lands with a desire to conquer. Wherever their troops passed, everyone would submit.

The only reason their advancement had failed was that the Divine World and Buddha World had joined hands with each other. In the annals of history, the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had joined hands with the Buddha Ancestor to battle with the Radiance Ancestor. During their battle, the skies had gone dark, and the tallest of mountains had collapsed. Continents had crumbled, and even world surfaces had shattered. It was even said that they had broken through the space to continue their fight.

No one knew the outcome of the battle. Even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor and Buddha Emperor had refused to leak any news of it. However, the Radiance Ancestor had disappeared after the battle, and the Radiance World had lost most of their fighting strength. Under the suppression of the Divine World and Buddha World, the Radiance World had retreated.

That time, Di Jun wasn’t even an Emperor! Despite that, he was lucky enough to experience the might of the Radiance Ancestor.

Right now, he felt the same kind of power coming from Huang Xiaolong!

It was the power that belonged to the Radiance Ancestor!

Di Jun leaped up from his seat, and a myriad of expressions filled his face.
