Chapter 2337: Who’s Your Brother?

A frosty light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

By this time, another Holy Prince from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate stepped out and pointed at Huang Xiaolong while cussing in his face, “Senior Brother is right, you definitely did something to our beast! Hand it over right now!” As soon as he spoke, he reached out to grab the little phoenix perched on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders.

Annoyed that the other party was trying to snatch Little Nine, Huang Xiaolong grabbed the other party’s hand before breaking all his fingers.

A shrill scream left his lips, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop there. He twisted his wrist again, and the shoulder of the Holy Prince was ripped out of its socket. Waving lightly, Huang Xiaolong sent him flying.

“What?!”

Everything happened too suddenly, and Yu Fujiang’s expression changed.

The disciples from other factions, who witnessed what happened, couldn’t believe their eyes. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Who is that man?! Isn’t he just an inner disciple of the Holy Heavens?” The Holy Prince from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate had superb talent, and he was the direct disciple of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Qi Qichen. Who would have thought that an inner disciple of the Holy Heavens would be strong enough to send him flying?!” Someone else exclaimed.

“How dare you injure my Junior Brother Chen?!” While everyone was still in shock, Yu Fujiang’s face sank as he looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Since you dare to capture our holy beast and injure a disciple of our Beast Tamer Holy Gate, no one will be able to say anything even if I teach you a lesson in the Holy Heavens!”

By stretching his hand out, Yu Fujiang gathered his strength, and a sword made from his qi appeared in his hands. Slashing it at Huang Xiaolong, the space around him shook violently. The strength that was infinitely close to the True Saint Realm surged out from Yu Fujiang’s body, causing everyone to stare at him in shock.

Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint! Moreover, he was at the peak of Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

Yu Fujiang could break into the True Saint Realm anytime he wanted.

Just as the sword qi was about to reach Huang Xiaolong, a hand appeared to block it. No fancy skill was involved as the arm completely shattered the sword qi that was about to cut Huang Xiaolong.

Once again, everyone stared at the scene before them in shock.

“You!” Yu Fujiang glared at Du Zhenjun.

The one who had stretched out his hand was precisely Du Zhenjun, whose anger was about to smash through the roof.

Yu Fujiang had never paid attention to the ordinary-looking person besides Huang Xiaolong. After all, how big of a threat could a follower of an inner disciple be?

“True Saint Realm?!” An idea formed in his head.

Du Zhenjun clenched his fist and eradicated any trace of sword qi in the air. A horrifyingly large backlash was sent back to Yu Fujiang, and he staggered backward in shock. Blood leaked from his lips, and he only managed to stop when he crashed into a stone pillar along the street.

Bang!

The stone pillar shattered instantly as Yu Fujiang was thrown to the ground. He couldn’t feel his body, and a sense of terror and anger filled his head. As a disciple with the highest status in the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, his talent wasn’t one whit inferior to the three beauties of the Clear Snow Palace! Or so he thought. Even if a First Heaven True Saint appeared, he would be able to defeat the other party easily!

It was clear that the follower of the inner disciple before him was no First Heaven True Saint! At the very least, he had to be a Second or Third Heavens True Saint Realm expert!

Heavy footsteps rang through the air, and the guards of the Holy Heavens finally arrived.

A path towards the battle soon formed as the guards rushed over only to be greeted with a scene of destruction.

Before Huang Xiaolong could speak, Yu Fujiang was already on his feet as he ordered the guards around. “You guys have arrived just in time. I am Yu Fujiang of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and I request that you capture the inner disciple of your Holy Heavens organization immediately! He attempted to kill me, and I demand an explanation from your superiors!”

Huang Xiaolong sneered softly.

Yu Fujiang was a piece of work alright. Even though he had made the first move, and he claimed that Du Zhenjun of the Holy Heavens was trying to kill him!

Of course identity as the chief disciple of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate played a huge part in this. If an ordinary inner disciple was in Huang Xiaolong’s place, he would be in serious trouble.

The guard captain couldn’t help but curse in his heart when he heard what Yu Fujiang said. If someone of Yu Fujiang’s level was injured by an inner disciple of the Holy Heavens in the city under his watch, he would be in deep sh*t!!

That was indeed a big matter!

Without thinking about it too deeply, the captain of the patrol guards turned furious as he thought to himself. How dare an inner disciple of the Holy Heavens injure someone in broad daylight?! Is he stupid?!

However, his brain stopped working the moment he turned to face Huang Xiaolong. The fury in his heart dissipated in the blink of an eye.

“This subordinate greets Young Master Huang Xiaolong!” The captain of the patrol guards got to his knees as he slammed his head on the ground.

The guards around him were startled as they quickly mirrored their captain’s actions.

Not a single person could keep their calm as they looked at Huang Xiaolong with a weird gaze in their eyes.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong?!”

The person who was going to be the star of the show at the apprenticeship ceremony three days later, the disciple of all four Primal Ancestors, was the young man before their eyes!

“He’s the one who comprehended all twelve sacred steles in six minutes!”

The crowd went into an uproar in an instant as the bodies of Yu Fujiang, and the other holy princes from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate trembled.

“You... You’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Yu Fujiang stammered.

Without looking at Yu Fujiang, Huang Xiaolong said to the captain, “The disciples of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate coveted my holy beast and attempted to kill me when they realized that they couldn’t take it away. Capture them and interrogate them thoroughly!”

The guard captain was startled.

Yu Fujiang regained his senses and panicked. “Young Master Huang, what happened earlier was a misunderstanding! We merely mistook your pet for our missing phoenix! Brother Huang, you can’t act rashly!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes turned cold, “Who’s your brother? Misunderstanding? I don’t think we misunderstood each other.” Seeing as the captain was still standing around, Huang Xiaolong turned to him and asked, “What are you waiting for?”

“Yes, Young Master Huang!”

Yu Fujiang was enraged, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you?! I am the chief disciple of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate! My master came all the way here to participate in the apprenticeship ceremony as an honored guest! How dare you order for my arrest?!”

“Chief disciple of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “So what if you’re the chief disciple? Do you think that you’re free to do as you wish in the Holy Heavens? Do you think that your attempt on my life will end well for you? I didn’t realize that the rules of the Holy Heavens didn’t apply to members of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate in our city!”

“Take him away!”

The captain no longer hesitated, and he surrounded the members of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate.

Yu Fujiang wanted to resist the arrest, but Du Zhenjun directly slapped him into the ground before he was dragged away by the patrol guards.
