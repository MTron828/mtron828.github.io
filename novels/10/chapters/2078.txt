Chapter 2079: Fleeing With Tails Between Their Legs

At Wan Yue’s roar, the rest of his party collected themselves and focused their most powerful attacks on Huang Xiaolong. By now, they had realized that Huang Xiaolong was the crux of the battle, and they no longer held back their strengths.

Even Xu Yang, Liu Yunyun, and other Heavenly World’s experts’ attacks targeted Huang Xiaolong.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong could only give up on chasing Chen Fushan and flickered away to dodge the concentrated attacks coming at him.

Even so, Chen Fushan’s back was dampened with unceasing cold sweat, and his face had turned deathly pale. In that split second, when Huang Xiaolong had locked onto him, Chen Fushan had thought that he would die like Shi Ming, as Huang Xiaolong’s scepter would pierce through his skull. Honestly speaking, in terms of strength, he was significantly weaker compared to Shi Ming, but even Shi Ming couldn’t survive one blow from Huang Xiaolong, much less him.

Even though Wan Yue, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, Buddhist Ancestor Shi Zhen, and the others had joined hands again and again in order to kill Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong had already broken through to mid-First Order Sovereign Realm. Not just that, but he also possessed a saint physique, three complete dao saint godheads, and three saint bloodlines. Then how could it be easy to kill Huang Xiaolong at this point?

With Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, he could easily reduce a Fourth Order Sovereign into a puddle of blood with one punch, but he was unable to kill Wan Zhuoyuan. It was because Wan Zhuoyuan possessed a saint physique, complete dao saint godheads, and also saint bloodlines. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Despite Wan Yue, Old Monster Lun Zhuan, and the others’ constant attacks, not only did they failed to kill Huang Xiaolong, but, at one point, Huang Xiaolong even seized the chance to pierce Chen Fushan’s forehead with the Radiance Divine Scepter. When Chen Fushan’s soul’s will tried to escape, it was instantly annihilated by the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Two hours later...

With seamless cooperation, Huang Xiaolong, the Reverence Moon Old Man, and the others managed to kill off the three Divine World’s old monsters. These three old monsters’ strength was similar to Chen Fushan.

Wan Yue was repeatedly enraged by Huang Xiaolong’s killing, but he was helpless to stop him. They managed to injure Huang Xiaolong several times, but unfortunately, Huang Xiaolong’s injuries healed quickly.

Huang Xiaolong’s saint physique’s defenses were simply mind-boggling, and his healing speed had far exceeded their imagination. Huang Xiaolong had obtained the Lord of Hell’s inheritance and possessed the heart of hell. He had also refined the Lotus of Darkness. On top of that, Huang Xiaolong had also obtained the Fiend World’s inheritance. Due to this, he was like a fish in the water inside this World of Darkness.

This was why Huang Xiaolong was able to recover in the fastest time every time he was injured by Wan Yue’s group.

After Huang Xiaolong wiped off Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, and the three Divine World’s old monsters, Wan Yue’s group lost five people. This greatly diminished the Great Killing Formation’s destructive power.

Initially, Wan Yue and the other eleven overlords were guaranteed to suppress the Reverence Moon Old Man’s group by relying on the Great Killing Formation, despite the other party having the Ancient Heavenly Court. Now with the Great Killing Formation’s power greatly diminished, Wan Yue’s group was the one that was suppressed.

It was fortunate that the Heavenly World’s Xu Yang and Liu Yunyun’s group members stepped up and filled in the holes left by Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, and the three old monsters’ deaths. The Great Killing Formation gained a new life, and under Wan Yue’s control, they gradually gained a slight upper hand.

Seeing Xu Yang, Liu Yunyun, and the others replace the holes left behind by Shi Ming, Chen Fushan and the others, Huang Xiaolong sneered derisively and locked onto the other two overlords of City of All-Heavens, Wang Hong and Lu Dezhi.

Although Wang Hong was merely a peak mid-Fourth Order Sovereign Realm, his strength was comparable to Shi Ming’s, while Lu Dezhi’s cultivation was at the late-Fourth Order Sovereign, merely a little higher than Shi Ming.

As long as he eliminated Wang Hong and Lu Dezhi, the Great Killing Formation would fall into a predicament once again, and it would no longer pose any threat.

Wan Zhuoyuan stood in the distance, looking at the City of All-Heavens’ experts attacking continuously but failing miserably. On top of that, Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, and three others on his side got killed by Huang Xiaolong. His expression grew increasingly dark and sullen. “It looks like we still underestimated Huang Xiaolong.”

Tian Yu, who was by his side, also looked sullen as he replied, “Had I known this, I would have asked my uncle to come as well.”

“Uncle Chen has just broken through to high-level Sovereign Realm recently. Hence he needs some time to solidify his foundation. It’s a pity that my grandfather and the Heavenly Lord are in seclusion. Otherwise, if one of them had been here, Huang Xiaolong would have been dead for sure!”

"How’s Aunt Xiaorong faring in the Heavenly World?" Wan Zhuoyuan suddenly asked. "When your Uncle Chen has stabilized his breakthrough and exits seclusion, they would hold their wedding ceremony, right? We will truly be one family then."

Tian You smiled, "For sure. We will be closer than we are now."

The two young men smiled at each other.

“Let’s leave this place first,” Wan Zhuoyuan’s gaze fell back on the battlefield, and he said solemnly.

“Leave?” Tian Yu blanked for a second. “The Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness are about to ripen!”

Wan Zhuoyuan shook his head and explained, “We have no one that can suppress Huang Xiaolong at the moment. The outcome of this battle has already been decided. It won’t take long for the City of All-Heavens to be defeated. It doesn’t make any sense to keep waiting here. The Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness can be forsaken. When I get back, I will enter seclusion to break through to Sovereign Realm.”

His eyes narrowed as he went on, but the murderous aura around him surged, “Wait until I have broken through to Sovereign Realm. My saint physique and saint bloodline would be more powerful. I will definitely kill Huang Xiaolong with my own hands!”

“Let’s go!” Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu vanished in a flicker.

Not long after Wan Zhuoyuan and Tian Yu left, Huang Xiaolong and the Reverence Moon Old Man successfully killed the City of All-Heavens’ Wang Hong with seamless cooperation.

After seeing that the situation was irreversible, Wan Yue issued an order for retreat.

When the City of All-Heavens’ and Heavenly World’s experts were retreating, Huang Xiaolong, the Reverence Moon Old Man, and the others chased up and killed another six low-level Sovereigns.

“Forget it, Xiaolong, don’t chase anymore.” Seeing that Huang Xiaolong still wanted to chase after them, the Reverence Moon Old Man called to him.

Only then did Huang Xiaolong stop.

“I think Wan Yue will probably flip his bed in anger after retreating.” The little cow merrily chuckled as she looked in the direction Wan Yue and his group had fled away. “They wanted to use the Darkness Gold Fruit’s ripening to kill us, but they themselves suffered a great loss instead of us. Their hearts must have bled dry to lose so many Sovereigns!”

“Quickly look, the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness are ripe!” Cang Mutian suddenly yelled ecstatically.

Everyone turned to look. High above on the Divine Tree of Darkness, numerous rays of black light were condensing. A fruit, the size of two adults’ fists, was growing solid.

This fruit was entirely black in color, yet it exuded a faint golden luster. This was the fabled Darkness Gold Fruit!

The old ancestors hidden in the surroundings immediately straightened their waists. Their eyes were blazing as they stared at the Darkness Golden Fruit.

The moment the Darkness Gold Fruit ripened, a drop of glimmering blood fell from the top of the Divine Tree of Darkness.

Huang Xiaolong disappeared in a flicker as a suction force from his palm simultaneously collected the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness. Despite the surrounding old ancestors’ greed, no one had the guts to snatch them from Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

Huang Xiaolong’s group did not linger around after collecting the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness, and they swiftly sped away from the World of Darkness in the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group had left the World of Darkness, the death of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, the Divine World’s three old monsters, and the City of All-Heavens’ Wang Hong spread like wildfire, shaking the myriad worlds.

“What? Shi Ming’s dead!”

“Other than Shi Ming, Chen Fushan, Wang Hong, and three other overlords have fallen. The City of All-Heavens itself lost eight low-level Sovereigns!”

“Wan Yue ran with his tail between his legs, the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hands!”

Forces in all directions were in a furor.

Huang Xiaolong’s King of Hell reputation resounded like thunder, reaching far and wide.
