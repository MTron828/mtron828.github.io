Chapter 2190: Lightning Barrage

Everyone was clear that the combined strength of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, Heavenly Terror Country, and the 33 Heavens Race wouldn’t be able to turn the situation around. After dealing with the experts of the three factions, wouldn’t Huang Xiaolong set his sights on them next?

The ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country had grudges with Huang Xiaolong in the past, and no one could be sure that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t deal with them after he was done with the Giant Kun Heavenly Country.

“Leave?” A light lit up in the Massacring God Ruler’s eyes.

Leaving was the best way he could put it. In better terms, he was escaping from the devil that was Huang Xiaolong.

When the Giant Kun Heavenly Country had first launched the attack on Huang Xiaolong, the last thing the ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country had thought of was running.

He was still reveling in Huang Xiaolong’s misfortune. When he had thought about all the miserable ways Huang Xiaolong would die, traces of joy had flashed through his heart. He had even thought that he would be able to see the humiliating ends of the rulers of the Heavenly Saint Ruler and the Mighty God Heavenly Ruler as they begged for mercy after they were defeated.

“Yes, Your Majesty, should we take our leave?” One of the generals quickly backed up the suggestion and persuaded the Massacring God Ruler.

The moment the words left his lips, an ear-shattering roar broke through the skies. The Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler was sent tumbling towards the high heavens. The wound in his chest worsened as blood poured from his wound.

The blood drained from the faces of everyone who saw the scene.

“Go!” Even Yang Tianchen couldn’t contain the fear in his heart when he saw how Huang Xiaolong sent the Giant Kun Ruler flying. His mind shook as he roared at the experts behind him.

At that instant, he was sure that Huang Xiaolong had the ability to slay every single person present on the battlefield.

He swore in his heart that he had never been afraid of anyone. Even when he had exchanged blows with the leader of the 33 Heavens Race, he had never felt so much fear in his heart.

Initially, there was a trace of hope in his heart that they would be able to end Huang Xiaolong’s life. After all, they had more than a hundred and ten super-experts with them. How could there be a possibility for them to fail? Everyone was sure that it would be Huang Xiaolong’s death anniversary on the same day the next year! They couldn’t be more wrong!

As one expert after another perished at Huang Xiaolong’s hand, the hope that they would be able to kill Huang Xiaolong quickly died out.

When there were less than forty of them left, Yang Tianchen finally realized that Huang Xiaolong was no ordinary expert. He was a freak who had popped out from god knew which stone in the universe!

Hearing Yang Tianchen’s cry to retreat, the members of the 33 Heavens Race felt a wave of shock washing through their hearts. In the next instant, they felt as though they were pardoned from the most heinous crimes as they were given permission to escape from the devil’s grasp!

Turning into streaks of lightning, everyone followed behind Yang Tianchen as they pushed their bodies to the limit to escape!

When the Giant Kun Ruler saw his allies retreating, he became even paler than before.

“Run!”

Upon seeing that Yang Tianchen and the others had already started running, the Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler couldn’t contain himself. Despite the rage and hatred in his heart, he could only order his troops to retreat!

The wings on the back of the Giant Kun flapped once and he appeared a million miles away.

Experts of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country turned around and ran desperately.

It was too bad that Huang Xiaolong reacted before the members of the Heavenly Terror Country could leave. With a twist of his body, he killed them all!

Every single expert from the Heavenly Terror Country who had entered the space outside the 33 heavens died!

From that moment on, the Heavenly Terror Country ceased to exist in the Heavens Path!

As for the 33 Heavens Race and the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hunt them down. After all, the earlier battle had worn him out. Killing seventy high-level Sovereigns was no easy feat!

His Sovereign’s will was nearly fully consumed in the battle.

At that moment, Huang Xiaolong was fully exhausted and he was like an arrow at the end of its flight.

Huang Xiaolong was ready to collect his harvest as he turned his gaze to the LightningOrigin Divine Tree. Nothing could compare to the importance of the Lightning Origin Divine Tree.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong shot a glare towards the Massacring God Heavenly Country’s ruler after seeing that he was still present.

A bitter smile formed on the ruler’s face as fear gripped his heart. Bowing towards Huang Xiaolong, a look of reverence appeared on his face. The only thing he hadn’t done was kneel.

The smiles on the faces of the experts of the Massacring God Heavenly Country looked uglier than their crying faces.

After staring at the ruler of the Massacring God Heavenly Country for some time, Huang Xiaolong finally shifted his gaze away. He looked at Jian Qintian and the other leaders of the ancient races before muttering, “I’m going to take all three LightningOrigin Divine Fruits and the Lightning Origin Divine Tree. Are you guys going to object to it?”

Everyone felt their faces dropping and some of them were tempted to speak. However, they swallowed their words in the end.

Everyone could see that Huang Xiaolong was exhausted after the battle with the Giant Kun Heavenly Ruler and Yang Tianchen. However, none of them dared to utter a single peep.

The scene where the blood from the experts of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country, 33 Heavens Race, and the Heavenly Terror Country had filled the skies was imprinted deep into their minds.

Of course, none of them left even though no one wanted to voice out their objections.

After seeing that everyone was still reluctant to leave, Huang Xiaolong sneered. A divine pill emitting blinding radiance appeared in his hand. It seemed as though the pill contained endless life force within it.

“Origin Boundary Pill!”

Jian Qintian and the rest couldn’t help but exclaim in shock when they saw the pill Huang Xiaolong revealed.

It was the pill Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain after killing the Heavenly Master! Huang Xiaolong had managed to retrieve two Origin Boundary Pills from his corpse!

Under the shocked gaze of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong popped the pill into his mouth. Rays of light swirled around his body and the Sovereign’s will that he had exhausted started to recover at a terrifying rate. In the blink of an eye, he was back to his peak state.

Jian Qintian and the rest stared at each other and saw the look of fear in the other party’s eyes.

“I’ll count to three. Anyone who doesn’t disappear from my sight by then will no longer leave!” Huang Xiaolong growled at everyone who was still present.

The Heavenly Saint Ruler and the the Mighty God Ruler led their men and appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

“One.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother waiting for them to react as he started the countdown.

Jian Qintian and the others felt their hearts pounding the instant the word left Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

Before he could continue, the world started to tremble. A weird whistling sound filled the space outside the 33 heavens.

This...

Everyone started looking around them in shock and saw that terrifying clouds of lightning were gathering. Lightning qi shot into the skies and a massive dragon formed by bolts of lightning charged towards the various experts present. It was as though a boundless sea of lightning was crashing down on them as they failed to see the edges of the lightning sea no matter how hard they tried.

Wherever the lightning went, nothing survived. The lightning qi swallowed everything in its path and turned them into nothingness!

“It’s the lightning barrage!”

Jian Qintian and the other elders revealed an expression of shock.

There were avalanches on mountains where snow swallowed everything in its path. The lightning barrage was similar, just that they had to deal with lightning instead of snow! The lightning barrage in the space outside the 33 heavens had the power to obliterate everything in its path. If late-Tenth Order Sovereigns were swallowed by the lightning barrage, they wouldn’t be able to escape.

“Hurry up and run! The restrictions around the gates of the 33 heavens have strengthened!” Jian Qintian screamed as he grabbed Jian Xiaofu. They shot into the skies and fled. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

There was only a single explanation as to why there would be a lightning barrage. The restrictions around the gates of the 33 heavens were regaining their strength!

The experts of the various factions fled in different directions. There was no need for Huang Xiaolong to scare them away with his strength as they were running with all they had. The Lightning Origin Divine Tree was the least of their worries!

“Lord...” The the Heavenly Saint Ruler and the Mighty God Ruler turned to Huang Xiaolong as fear crept up their hearts.

After looking at the incoming lightning barrage, Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at the Lightning Origin Divine Tree. “There is no need to rush!”

Even though he hadn’t completed the fusion between the nine great lightning pools, a mere lightning barrage shouldn’t be able to affect him now that the fusion process had already started, right?
