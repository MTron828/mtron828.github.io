Chapter 3200: Hand Them Over

The two elders felt their expressions changing after hearing what Xue Jian said.

Before they could speak, Xue Jian had passed down his order. “Search!”

The army behind him poured into the Purple Lightning Peak instantly.

It seemed as though he was intentionally stopping Huang Xiaolong, and he had long since made his preparations. There were a million elite soldiers behind him, and their commanders were experts in their own right.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother stopping them at all. Neither did he activate the restrictions around the ship to stop them. In fact, he allowed them to stream onto the Purple Lightning Peak.

As soon as they entered, they formed ten thousand groups of a hundred men as they charged towards every corner of the flying ship.

Along the way, they swept up every single herb they could find.

Yuan Tianyi and the others felt their expressions sinking when they saw what the army was doing. However, Huang Xiaolong stopped them from making any moves.

Staring at their actions with a cold gaze, Huang Xiaolong chose to remain silent.

All of a sudden, Xue Jian and two other experts took a step to appear before Huang Xiaolong.

“Are you the Purple Lightning Prince? I know you have a hundred fierce souls as your subordinates. All of them are extremely dangerous creatures and they feed on the flesh of living experts. In order to keep the disciples of the celestial empire safe, you cannot bring them into the sacred land!”

“What do you intend to do about it then?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Hand them over to us. We’ll be keeping them for you.”

The expressions of the two silver haired elders changed.

It was clear Xue Jian was making things difficult for Huang Xiaolong.

“Hand them over to you?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Xue Jian as though he was looking at someone whose brain was filled with water.

“Of course! We’ll return them to you when you leave the Extreme Heaven Sacred Land.” Xue Jian laughed.

Huang Xiaolong snorted slightly in response. He wasn’t a baby who was born the day before. As long as he handed them over, there was no way he would get them back. After all, the other party would just refuse to meet with him when he left.

Even if the princess personally appeared to retrieve them, she might not be able to get them back. Xue Jian was a marshal of the celestial empire, and he was the strongest one at that! His status was indeed as high as the clouds.

“What if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong sneered.

A frosty light flashed through Xue Jian’s eyes and he snorted, “According to the rules of the celestial empire, we’ll kill anyone who refuses to comply with my order!” He released his aura all of a sudden, and he continued, “You might be someone who reached perfection level in eleven elements, and your subordinate might be someone who comprehended all thirteen elements with eight of them at perfection level. However, you’re better off not resisting!”

He released his power completely, and everyone could see that he had comprehended twelve elements with eleven of them at perfection level!

As the strongest marshal in the Extreme Heaven Celestial Empire, his strength was as respectable as could be. He was even stronger than Di Xiaolong of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire!

The two great generals behind him released their auras too, and they had comprehended nine elements with eight of them at perfection level!

The two of them might be great generals, but their strength ranked in the top few in the empire. They might be even stronger than marshals of the three celestial empires, but they chose to remain as great generals even though their strength had reached the requirement for promotion!

It was clear that they were Xue Jian’s strongest generals.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle in amusement when he noticed Xue Jian’s strength. He might be a little stronger than Huang Xiaolong expected, but he was a long way to go compared to the Extreme East Old Man! The old man made a wise decision to escape when faced with the old Huang Xiaolong. Even without showing himself, Huang Xiaolong managed to beat the Extreme East Old Man half to death with the power of eleven elements at perfection level! Xue Jian was nothing but a fly in front of Huang Xiaolong who had comprehended his twelfth element!

With the power of time nearing the major completion stage, Huang Xiaolong knew that even if experts who had reached perfection level in all thirteen elements appeared before him now, he would beat them down without much difficulty! There wasn’t a need to mention the clown that was Xue Jian.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong chose to remain silent after he released his aura, Xue Jian continued, “Right now, I suspect that you have other dangerous artifacts on you. Hand over every single treasure on you right now!”

He didn’t release his lock onto Huang Xiaolong.

As long as Huang Xiaolong said no, he would attack immediately.

One of the silver haired elders stepped forward and frowned, “Marshal Xue Jian, Her Highness is rushing over right now. Please refrain from doing anything you will regret.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Even if she comes, I have nothing to be afraid of. I’m doing my job, and she can’t butt in for no reason.” Xue Jian sneered.

Turning around, he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “Purple Lightning Young Master, hand them over along with all your treasures! I’ll give you ten breaths of time to make your decision!”

The faces of the two elders became extremely ugly. They might have notified the Sixth Princess a moment ago, but she might not be able to arrive in ten breaths of time!

It seemed as though she wasn’t going to make it in time.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he remained impassive as he looked at the clown that was Xue Jian. As long as Xue Jian made a move, he would most definitely…

Three breaths of time passed in an instant, and the space around them froze on the fourth breath.

A dense killing intent started to fill the skies, and everyone in the surrounding regions turned to stare at the scene.

Many people gasped in shock when they noticed Xue Jian.

“Is that the young man invited by the Sixth Princess? Things are going to get interesting…”

Xue Jian’s allegiance to the oldest prince was something known to all. His conflict with the Sixth Princess was an open secret.

Very quickly, eight breaths of time passed.

Circulating the cosmos energy in his body to the limit, Xue Jian got ready to attack.

Ninth breath!

The hearts of the two elders sank, and they realized that there was no time for the princess to arrive.

Tenth breath!

As soon as the tenth breath of time passed, Xue Jian unleashed everything he had. However, a crisp voice rang through the air to interrupt him. “Hold it right there!”

The silver haired elders revealed an excited expression when they noticed that she had arrived.

Instead of stopping, Xue Jian hastened his attack. He used everything he had as his palms shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

Twelve rays of light shot towards Huang Xiaolong, and just as it was about to smash into his chest, another ray of light pierced through the void to slam into his palms!

Bang!

When Xue Jian’s palms slammed into the ray of light, an explosion rang through the air.

As the blast engulfed him, Xue Jian took several steps back. After he finally steadied himself, a figure appeared from the void above, and Zeng Ying made her appearance. The ray of light shot back into her hands, and on closer inspection, it was something like a disk!

Without a doubt, the disk was a pseudo-creation artifact. It was nearing the peak level of a pseudo creation artifact, but Huang Xiaolong was able to observe Zeng Ying’s strength nonetheless. He could see that she was a little stronger than Xue Jian, and that was saying something.
