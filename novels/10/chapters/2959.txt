Chapter 2960: What the H*ll Is This?

When he heard Huang Xiaolong accept his challenge, the Frost Eye Race’s young man Bing Jun was inwardly overjoyed. He would seize this opportunity to defeat Huang Xiaolong and build up his own prestige in front of other Frost Eye Race experts.

He smiled at Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, I know that you gave Huang Shuai a one-hand handicap in the Creation Ceremony battle, and you defeated Huang Shuai with one hand, so I won’t bully you, as I am a late-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable. I will only use one hand!”

Although defeating Huang Xiaolong would raise his prestige in front of the Frost Eye Race’s experts, it was undeniable that his cultivation realm was much higher than Huang Xiaolong. If he defeated Huang Xiaolong in that manner, his victory would seem flawed. Therefore, Bing Jun planned to defeat Huang Xiaolong with one hand! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

That’s how prestige is built!

“You’re giving me a handicap?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“That’s right,” Bing Jun flashed Huang Xiaolong a sunny smile, “I know that you have four kinds of absolute powers, so you’d better not hold back your strength, or I’m afraid you won’t be able to get past three moves from me!”

Bing Jun exuded strong confidence from head to toe.

Bing Jun had a good reason to be so confident as the Frost Eye Race was one of the most powerful of genesis races, from their physical advantages to their bloodline; and he, as the Frost Eye Race first patriarch’s grandson, his bloodline purity was much higher than most disciples of the younger generation, almost as pure as the Frost Eye Race’s genesis ancestor.

The main source of Bing Jun’s confidence was the fact he was born with the rarest kind of Frost Eye Race’s dao physique, the Ice Jade Dao Physique!

This dao physique was ranked in the top ten of Divine Tuo Holy World’s dao physiques. He had lost count of how many Frost Eye Race’s innate treasures he had refined over the years to raise his Ice Jade Dao Physique to major completion. His body had not lost out to a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable’s dao physique since then.

On top of everything, I had a fortuitous encounter!

Huang Xiaolong looked at the Frost Eye Race’s young man who was beaming with strong confidence and asked with a faint smile, “Can we start?”

“Of course.” Bing Jun’s desire for battle soared to the sky, and frightening frost energy howled around him.

“Huang Xiaolong, you have the power of absolute frost, but so do I!”

Everything that came in contact with his absolute frost power would get sealed in ice.

He once had a fortuitous encounter and he had cultivated the power of absolute frost from it!

In the whole Divine Tuo Holy World, the number of people with absolute frost power did not exceed the number of fingers on one hand. Moreover, those capable of mastering the power of absolute frost were generally peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts, and he had mastered the power of absolute frost while still a late-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable. This was something to be proud of.

It was at this time that Huang Xiaolong rushed forward in a flicker, akin to a blazing long spear, piercing through Bing Jun’s absolute frost power.

“Look out!” Ancestor Xuan suddenly shouted.

But before he could finish his first word, he saw their young patriarch shooting out and crashing through several mountain peaks, and he finally crashed on the foothills of a certain mountain with a thunderous boom.

Other Frost Eye Race’s experts ashened at this sight.

Their young patriarch was knocked away by Huang Xiaolong just like that?

Blood-lined cracks appeared on the surface of Bing Jun’s body as his body crashed to the ground. The Frost Eye Race’s experts sucked in a breath of cold air when they saw Bing Jun’s injuries, and that was the major completion of the Ice Jade Dao Physique! Yet Huang Xiaolong had cracked it like the most common ceramic!

Before Huang Xiaolong’s Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, even a major completion Ice Jade Dao Physique was as fragile as ceramic.

Huang Xiaolong snorted at the sight of the Frost Eye Race’s young patriarch sprawled on dirt with bloody cracks all over his body. Admittedly, it was a surprise to Huang Xiaolong that Bing Jun also cultivated the power of absolute frost, however, Bing Jun’s absolute frost power didn’t even reach the state of minor completion.

As for the young man’s Ice Jade Dao Physique? He needed to be grateful that Huang Xiaolong did not use any cosmos energy in his attack, or Bing Jun would be nothing but dispersing blood mists right now.

While the Frost Eye Race’s experts were in a fluster, Bing Jun slowly got to his feet. He glared at Huang Xiaolong in shock and fury, and an uncontrollable feeling of humiliation and shame filled his chest.

“HUANG-XIAO-LONG!” Bing Jun gnashed the name through gritted teeth, and his eyes turned bloodshot with rage, “I don’t believe I can’t kill you today!” With that said, he took out an icy transparent long staff, and it was none other than the Frost Eye Race’s Holy Staff.

He pushed his absolute frost power to the limit, and glaring icy rays burst out from the Holy Staff. These glaring icy rays of light eclipsed all other lights, freezing the entire space.

Even Huang Xiaolong was shocked upon sensing the momentum of the holy staff.

The Holy Staff’s icy rays gave him a dangerous feeling, which meant these rays of icy light were a threat to him.

But before Bing Jun could attack with the Holy Staff in his hand, Ancestor Xuan spoke, “Bing Jun, step down, you’re not a match against him.”

The other Frost Eye Race’s experts and Bing Jun himself were stunned.

“Ancestor Xuan, I…” Bing Jun protested.

“You’re not his match.” Ancestor Xuan shook his head, “If you have fully refined the Holy Staff, capable of exerting the Holy Staff’s real power, you can win against him, but the currently you are not Huang Xiaolong’s opponent.” Then he walked towards Huang Xiaolong without giving Bing Jun the chance to say another word.

“Huang Xiaolong, we underestimated you from the beginning.” Ancestor Xuan spoke sullenly, “The Huang Long Bloodline and Dao Body of Heaven and Earth are really admirable.The average Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert would have a bad time suppressing you, but unfortunately, you met me.”

Huang Xiaolong was strong, stronger than he had estimated.

But his strength was sufficient to fully capture Huang Xiaolong.

His right palm slapped out just as he finished speaking, and his speed was so fast that no one reacted. His palm already hit Huang Xiaolong on the chest before anyone knew. However, just as his palm came in contact with Huang Xiaolong’s chest, the Huang Long Armor emerged to the surface and fully protected Huang Xiaolong. At the same time, a black shadow went straight to his face.

Ancestor Xuan took a look and saw it was merely a black spider and snickered, “You think this little thing can harm me?” He pointed a finger at the black spider nonchalantly.

The black spider flew off from Ancestor Xuan’s finger force, but in the next second, he saw the black spider flying back at him-unscathed!

He was genuinely shocked. The force from his finger just now could have pierce through the flesh of an early Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm expert, so what the heck was this black spider?

Then he saw similar black spiders flying out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, and soon, it was a colony of over a hundred black spiders! These black spiders were about to fall on his body, and their speed was faster than a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

“Go die!”

Freezing ice power surged around Ancestor Xuan, and he slapped out the black spiders with both palms. He originally thought that these spiders would be reduced to dust with this attack, but to his astonishment, the black spiders were merely slapped away, and they once again came at him. Their speed also increased at this point.

Not only Ancestor Xuan, but even Bing Jun, and other Frost Eye Race’s experts were flabbergasted, including Feng Yue and her group.

“What the h*ll are these?!” a Frost Eye Race’s expert mumbled.

These black spiders were still alive after being struck by a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert!

Still, Ancestor Xuan was someone with a lot of experience. Seeing that he couldn’t harm these pitch-black spiders, a possibility came to his mind. A thought that made his soul tremble with fear. He had heard of it in the past but had never seen it.
