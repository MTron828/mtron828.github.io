Black Ice Ancestor looked at Gui Yi in horror as she struggled to regain her footing in the corner of the hall.

She, she was, was actually repelled!

Repelled back!

Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and Zhu Yi were stupefied by the result.

Wasn’t he a Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm?

This black-robed subordinate of Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a Ninth Order Ancestor God Realm! But a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm!

A late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm master! They sucked in a breath of cold air as it suddenly dawned upon them.

Neither Golden Brow Ancestor nor Blood Knife Ancestor had expected this result. When did Gui Yi become so strong?

Myriad Flames Ancestor, Zhu Yi, and the other Ancestors turned their gaze to Feng Er, and Gui Er after they recovered from their momentary shock. Since this subordinate of Huang Xiaolong is a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, then this alluring girl and the other black-robed young man, are they also late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters? Even if they were not, there won’t be much of a difference in their strengths!

The hall fell into silence.

Black Ice Ancestor, Zhu Yi, and the other Ancestors’ attention was pinned on Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er, while they completely ignored divine elephant Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng.

“Huang Xiaolong, you, you don’t be complacent or presumptuous!” After seconds of silence, Black Ice Ancestor couldn’t restrain herself from shouting at Huang Xiaolong, “Even if you have three high-level Ancestor God Realm subordinates, if the seven of us join hands, we’re capable of subduing all of you!” She turned to Golden Brow Ancestor and said, “Senior Brother Golden Brow, we all know that you’ve already broken through to God King Realm, so are you going to violate the Fortune Gate’s rules, and openly protect Huang Xiaolong?”

Sky Sword Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and Lightning Hammer Ancestor looked at Golden Brow Ancestor in surprise. ‘Golden Brow has really broken through to God King Realm? Although they had been speculating about this, it remained a mere speculation and nothing more since none of them had gotten any confirmation about it.

Golden Brow Ancestor frowned, and looked at Huang Xiaolong. “Xiaolong...”

“Master, I know what you want to ask,” said Huang Xiaolong, his sharp gaze fell on Black Ice Ancestor and Zhu Yi. “You repeatedly claimed that I had induced my subordinates to injure He Fang and Chen Xuguang with every sentence you uttered, but did you witness the incident with your own eyes?”

Black Ice Ancestor and the others blanked for a second.

“Since Zhu Feng personally reported this matter, how could this be fake?” Black Ice Ancestor snorted.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother to speak with Black Ice Ancestor. Instead, he took out a small stone and spoke to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, “Masters, I have recorded everything that happened with this recording stone. You can understand what happened after watching it.”

With that said, he channeled a shred of godforce into the recording stone. Moving images shone out from the recording stone.

Other than moving images, there were also voices.

The scenes began with Zhu Feng faking his goodwill and inviting Huang Xiaolong, followed by Zhu Feng telling Huang Xiaolong to roll over to see He Fang and Chen Xuguang after Huang Xiaolong had politely declined his invitation. Subsequently, all the Ancestors and the Gate Chief could see Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng kicking away Zhu Feng, Lu Tai, and Sun Yao.

Moments later, they could see it was He Fang and Chen Xuguang blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path.

When He Fang attacked Huang Xiaolong, Gui Yi had twisted and broken his fingers while protecting Huang Xiaolong.

Finally, the images ended with Huang Xiaolong’s group leaving the scene.

After they finished watching the recording stone’s images, Black Ice Ancestor and Zhu Yi’s faces turned extremely ugly.

Especially, Black Ice Ancestor was enraged since she had been biting hard and complaining that Huang Xiaolong had induced his subordinates to heavily injure He Fang and Chen Xuguang, but the fact was completely opposite! It was He Fang who had attacked Huang Xiaolong first, and Gui Yi had only broken He Fang’s fingers to protect Huang Xiaolong.

The cause and reason were clear and self-explanatory.

Black Ice Ancestor turned to look at the two beasts with an ugly expression, while inwardly trying to estimate their strength. Could they also be late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm masters?

If that was the case, then wouldn’t it mean that Huang Xiaolong actually had five late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm subordinates!

Why are so many high-level Ancestor God Realm masters following him?!

What was Huang Xiaolong’s secret that she doesn’t know of?!

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly as he took note of Black Ice Ancestor and Zhu Yi’s expressions. If it wasn’t for the sake of his Masters, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, he would’ve ordered void devil beast Xu Baisheng to slap old hag Black Ice into pieces! At least, he would have had Xu Baisheng abolish her cultivation, so that she could stop annoying him in the future.

“Hahaha, Black Ice, why aren’t you talking anymore? Weren’t you shouting full of energy earlier? Didn’t you claim that my disciple had induced his subordinates to heavily injure He Fang and Chen Xuguang? Didn’t you say that my disciple should die a thousand times? I fork you old hag, why aren’t you shouting now?!” Blood Knife Ancestor derided Black Ice Ancestor to his satisfaction.

“Now, you can swallow all of your farts back into your stomach!” Blood Knife Ancestor added another stab and burst out into another bout of complacent laughter.

Black Ice Ancestor’s face turned green, her angry eyes glared at Blood Knife Ancestor, but had no words to retort.

Golden Brow Ancestor said to Zhu Yi, “Gate Chief, is everything clear now? Zhu Feng deliberately slandered Xiaolong. Meanwhile, He Fang and Chen Xuguang used their identities to intentionally make things difficult for Xiaolong ! Although Zhu Feng is the Young Lord, this kind of behavior is not appropriate, isn’t it?”

Previously, Zhu Yi had accused Blood Knife Ancestor for being biased towards Huang Xiaolong, and had stated that Blood Knife Ancestor’s actions were inappropriate for doing so. At this moment, Golden Brow Ancestor returned the same question to Zhu Yi.

Golden Brow Ancestor’s expression was extremely cold.

Huang Xiaolong was his disciple, yet Zhu Feng had dared to use He Fang and Chen Xuguang to get his disciple into a big trouble. Do these people think that he was made of mud and won’t get angry?!

Zhu Yi looked embarrassed and uncomfortable as Golden Brow Ancestor had put him on the spot. He weakly said, “Golden Brow Ancestor is right, my son’s teaching is lacking. Golden Brow Ancestor rest assured, I surely will punish Zhu Feng according to the sect’s rules!”

Golden Brow Ancestor said expressionlessly, “I hope so.”

Zhu Yi forced an awkward smile, then kept silent.

“Masters, did something serious happen for you to summon me urgently?” Huang Xiaolong took the chance to ask his Masters once again.

Golden Brow Ancestor opened his mouth but didn’t know where to begin.

Seeing his Master’s expression, Huang Xiaolong got a premonition.

“It’s Li Lu... She was possessed by an evil spirit while she was in the Extraterritorial Devil’s Battlefield. She’s in a coma right now.” Blood Knife Ancestor explained.

“What—?!” Huang Xiaolong’s face tightened.

Li Lu was possessed by an evil spirit!

“Why didn’t you tell me?!” Huang Xiaolong blurted out impulsively.

“We had thought that we could expel the evil spirit from her body by combining our strengths, but...” Golden Brow Ancestor’s voice trailed off.

But in the end, they had failed to expel the evil spirit from Li Lu’s body, regardless of the methods they had tried. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Moreover, even if they would have informed Huang Xiaolong, what was the use? It wasn’t like Huang Xiaolong could have managed to find a way to expel that evil spirit, therefore, they had decided to keep the matter from Huang Xiaolong.

“Where’s Li Lu?!” Huang Xiaolong asked anxiously.

“In the Brimming Snow Palace.” Blood Knife Ancestor answered.

Brimming Snow Palace!

Huang Xiaolong turned around anxiously and flew out from the hall to the Brimming Snow Palace. The little cow, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest of the group hurried after him.

Seeing this, Black Ice Ancestor ridiculed, “Isn’t he good at pretending? He made it look so real, as if he was really concerned about Li Lu!”

Blood Knife Ancestor glared daggers at her.

“Let’s go and take a look as well.” Golden Brow Ancestor said and flew out from the hall. Blood Knife Ancestor harrumphed coldly at Black Ice Ancestor before flying out behind Golden Brow Ancestor. Sky Sword Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and the rest also flew out from the hall, and headed to the Brimming Snow Palace.

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the Brimming Snow Palace, Feng Yingying and a group of sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs were flying back to Vientiane World at high speed in the vast space of the Vientiane World surface.
