Chapter 3491: Location of the Star Dragon Essence

When Huang Xiaolong was planning to reject the invitation, Huang Long chuckled, “This is great! You have to go!”

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback, and he didn’t understand why his father would agree. It was obviously a bad thing for him to be invited back to the Bearded Dragon Palace as he knew that all of them had their eyes on the dragon marrow in his possession.

“Go and tell your princess that we’ll be there,” Huang Long responded to the maidservant who came with the invitation.

With everyone in the celestial empire doting on her, her maidservant was an expert who had nine elements at the perfection level!

Looking at Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long, the maidservant replied, “Our princess will look forward to your arrival.”

After the maidservant left, Huang Long smiled. “Do you want to know the reason?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

“Since she wants the dragon marrow, why don’t you make her a trade?”

Trade?!

A lightbulb appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind. “Do you mean… The Star Dragon Essence?”

Huang Long chuckled. “That’s right. We’ve been here for several years, and we didn’t manage to discover any signs of the Star Dragon Essence. We might not be able to learn anything, but as the princess of the Bearded Dragon Palace, she might know a thing or two!”

Ao Wen was the third princess of the celestial empire, and she wasn’t weak. It wouldn’t be weird if she knew something about the Star Dragon Essence.

As night fell, Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long left the manor and headed for the palace. This time, Huang Xiaolong brought Wang Meiqi along with him. Long Yi and the others were made to stay behind.

When they arrived, Huang Xiaolong brought out Ao Wen’s invitation and was cordially invited in by the guards. The three of them entered Ao Wen’s palace where a banquet had already been laid out.

The palace wasn’t large, but the decorations were rather unique. Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when he saw the layout of the place. After all, one would be able to learn a lot about the other party after observing their living quarters.

When they entered the main hall, Ai Wen was already waiting with several maidservants.

“Many thanks to young master for accepting my invitation.” Ao Wen greeted Huang Xiaolong politely. Her tone was sweet, and she could only be described with a single word, ‘cute’.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback to discover her appearance.

If she was placed in the mortal world, she would be a young lady who had just matured. Her beauty was barely starting to reveal itself.

“You’re too polite.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Huang Long chuckled in amusement.

“I wonder who this big sister is? She’s even prettier than I am!” Ao Wen’s eyes landed on Wang Meiqi, and her eyes went wide.

The maidservants around her behaved the same way as they admired Wang Meiqi’s beauty.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all. After all, Wang Meiqi’s beauty was something that couldn’t be hidden. Anyone who met her for the first time would feel the same way. Even Pangu and the others reacted the same way when he returned from the Yin Yang Road of Death.

Even someone like Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by her beauty when they first met.

Wang Meiqi’s beauty was something that could strike one deep in the soul. One wouldn’t be able to find flaws in her no matter how hard one tried.

Wang Meiqi smiled when she heard Ao Wen’s question. She was used to such questions.

Not being shy with strangers, Ao Wen grabbed Wang Meiqi’s hand and started to ask her lots of questions.

If she knew that Wang Meiqi was a God of Creation at the peak of the large completion stage, she wouldn’t dare to act so casually.

Pulling Wang Meiqi by the arm, she wanted Wang Meiqi to sit beside her.

Wang Meiqi shot a gaze towards Huang Xiaolong, and only sat when he nodded slightly.

Ao Wen asked Wang Meiqi about everything under the sun, and she seemed to have forgotten about Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long’s existence.

The father and son duo stared at each other in amusement, and they chuckled slightly.

Several moments later, Ao Wen finally looked at Huang Xiaolong. With a cute little smile on her face, she giggled, “Young Master, big sister Meiqi, and I are extremely fated to meet! Why don’t you give her to me? I’ll be able to live with her from now on…”

“Impossible!” Wang Meiqi snapped before Huang Xiaolong could say anything.

Ao Wen was shocked.

A snicker left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Ao Wen obviously didn’t expect Wang Meiqi to react that way, and her stare caused Wang Meiqi’s face to flush red.

“I made a promise to His Highness.”

“Oh? Promise?!” A crafty smile formed on Ao Wen’s face.

Her reaction caused Wang Meiqi to feel even more awkward.

…

After chatting with Huang Xiaolong and Huang Long for some time, Ao Wen finally brought up the main topic of the night. “I heard that Young Master Huang has some dragon marrow…”

Huang Xiaolong laughed in his heart. Ao Wen might look like a cute and innocent little girl, but she wasn’t stupid. It might be true that she liked Wang Meiqi, but she also planned to use Wang Meiqi as a way to get closer to Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right. I do have some with me.” After he spoke, a bunch of dragon marrow appeared in his hand. As soon as it appeared, dragon qi filled the courtyard. The dragon essence contained in the marrow was pure, and it was extremely condensed.

“This… Peak-grade dragon marrow!” Ao Wen gasped.

She didn’t expect that Huang Xiaolong would possess peak-grade dragon marrow.

At that level, the dragon marrow was a god-like treasure. She wouldn’t be able to obtain it even with a trillion dao coins!

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

Ao Wen only managed to snap back to reality after a long time, and she looked at Huang Xiaolong in shock. From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong seemed to have a lot more on him! She didn’t know how he obtained so much of it, and her mind went blank for a moment.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Indeed. Huang Xiaolong had a ton more of them. If not because he gave Huang Long a huge portion of it to stabilize his injuries, he would have even more.

“I won’t hide my intentions from Young Master Huang. I have an urgent need for the dragon marrow in your hands. I wonder if you are willing to sell them to me. I can pay you in dao coins, and I can also trade treasures of equivalent value with you,” Ao Wen said seriously.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Huang Long to indicate for him to speak. “We came to the Bearded Dragon City in order to obtain some news about the Star Dragon Essence. We’re more than willing to give you this batch of dragon marrow if you can provide us with information on the Star Dragon Essence.”

Ao Wen and the maidservants beside her stared at Huang Long in shock.

Star Dragon Essence!

That was unexpected!

“I have a piece of news on a drop of Star Dragon Essence…” Ao Wen replied after a long time.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up.

Even though they had guessed as much, joy filled their hearts when they heard it for themselves.

“However, that drop of Star Dragon Essence is extremely hard to obtain! No one has been able to locate it even after so many years!” Ao Wen sighed.
