Chapter 2212: Followed

A horrified expression appeared on Prince Qian’s face as Huang Xiaolong walked closer and closer. With a flick of his wrist, the Coiling Dragon Sword appeared and pierced towards Huang Xiaolong.

As the strength of a mid-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch came crashing down on Huang Xiaolong, a gigantic dragon pounced at him. Even Fifth Order Heavenly Monarchs would be hard-pressed to dodge his attack.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong was no Heavenly Monarch. He flicked and dispersed the humongous dragon formed from Prince Qian’s sword qi with a single finger. The Coiling Dragon Sword flew out of the prince’s hands and lodged itself deep into a stone pillar at the side.

As for Prince Qian himself, he lost his footing, and he retreated hastily. When he slammed into the pillar behind him which dislodged the Coiling Dragon Sword, and it came chopping down at him. The blood drained from his face when he realized that he couldn’t feel his arms. There was no way for him to avoid the sword!

“Clang!”

The Coiling Dragon Sword had landed right between his legs, just shy of his manhood.

Prince Qian felt his scalp turning numb as several strands of hair were scrapped off his head.

Even though he was a prince in the Jinyuan Kingdom, and he was a mid-level Heavenly Monarch Realm expert, beads of cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

In order to punish Zhang Haochen, Huang Xiaolong casually pointed at him and sent him flying out of the courtyard. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The guards who were about to rush him were also sent flying with no exceptions.

Zhang Wanyue and the maids behind her stared at Huang Xiaolong with a dumbfounded expression.

He then walked towards Prince Qian, who was sitting on the floor.

“Young Master Huang, don’t do it!” Zhang Wenyue snapped back to reality as she stretched her hands out to protect her father.

As he looked at Zhang Wenyue, who was standing in his way, the look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes softened. “Relax. I won’t kill your father.”

Zhang Wenyue was startled, but she nodded her head slowly.

Huang Xiaolong arrived beside Prince Qian and said indifferently, “I won’t kill you because of Young Lady Zhang. If you try anything like this again, I’ll cripple you!”

Prince Qian’s heart trembled when he saw the killing intent smouldering in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong then turned to look at Zhang Wenyue.

“Young Master Huang, I...” Zhang Wenyue stared at him with a guilty look in her eyes. She had no idea what to say to him as she had assured him that no one would be able to cause trouble for him the day before. Despite her reassurance, trouble had befallen him the very next day.

She had no idea how to face Huang Xiaolong after this incident.

After looking at the complicated expression on Zhang Wenyue’s face, Huang Xiaolong smiled and brushed the matter off. “You had nothing to do with this. I won’t blame you for this matter.” He retrieved a transmission symbol and passed it over to her.

Under Zhang Wenyue’s suspicious gaze, Huang Xiaolong explained, “If you meet with any trouble in the future, contact me with this.” When he was done, he walked out of Prince Qian Manor without turning back.

Zhang Wenyue stood there dumbfounded as she watched Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappearing into the distance.

“Princess!” One of the maids cried out when she saw the foolish look on Zhang Wenyue’s face.

Upon hearing the maid’s cry, Zhang Wenyue finally snapped back to attention.

For some unknown reason, Zhang Wenyue felt a sense of emptiness when she looked at the empty Elegant Courtyard.

“Ahem!”

Prince Qian stood up with difficulty as he used the pillar beside him for support.

“Father, are you okay?” Zhang Wenyue hastily ran over to help her father.

He shook his head and said dejectedly, “Yue’er, I have wronged you indeed.” It was clear that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t from the Black Devil Sect.

If Huang Xiaolong was from the Black Devil Sect and had ill intentions, he would have killed all of them before fleeing with the Coiling Dragon Sword.

When he realized that an expert at Huang Xiaolong’s level was gone, a sense of regret filled his heart.

The strength that Huang Xiaolong had shown earlier was definitely in the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm. He could even be a Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch! If they had managed to form proper ties with him, they would been able to pull in a high-level Heavenly Monarch over to their side!

If that had happened, then someone at his level, having ill intentions towards their manor would have needed to think twice before doing anything.

“Father, it’s okay.” Zhang Wenyue shook her head to reassure her father. However, the words got stuck in her throat for some reason.

...

After leaving the manor, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered to remain in the city.

In the library, Huang Xiaolong had learned of the existence of an enormous forest named the Devouring Icy Forest at the edge of the Jinyuan Kingdom.

Not only did the Devouring Icy Forest house countless spiritual herbs, but there were also numerous ice-attributed vicious beasts living in it.

He quickly decided on his destination and headed straight for the Devouring Icy Forest.

With the uncountable number of spiritual herbs, Huang Xiaolong planned to refine several recovery pills. He could also kill several beasts to sell their corpses for money. After all, he wasn’t strong enough to open up the space in the lightning bead to retrieve the copious amounts of wealth he had.

Due to the distance between the kingdom and forest, along with his injured body, Huang Xiaolong knew that it would take him half a month to arrive there.

As he wasn’t fully recovered, he was unable to summon the Golden Pig Treasure and could only travel by foot.

“It looks like I should subdue some beasts and use them as mounts after I reach the Devouring Icy Forest.” Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.

There’s still Feng Tianyu... I wonder if he’s alright... Did he pass through the lightning storm to arrive in the Holy World?

Even though Feng Tianyu was a half-step Venerable, no one knew if he had the strength to arrive in the Holy World. The only way Huang Xiaolong would be able to learn anything about Feng Tianyu was if he managed to make his name known.

He was currently broke as heck and he wasn’t even able to hire a bodyguard! Unable to rush his recovery process, Huang Xiaolong decided to take it one step at a time.

By avoiding the main roads and taking shortcuts through the mountain roads or barren lands, he knew that he would be able to save a whole lot of time.

The sky slowly darkened, and dark clouds filled the sky.

When Huang Xiaolong raised his head and noticed the clouds gathering in the sky, he hesitated for a moment before entering a dilapidated temple at the side of the road. Upon entering the main hall, Huang Xiaolong saw a broken statue and ceilings full of spiderwebs.

Huang Xiaolong swept the cobwebs away with a wave of his hand. Walking towards the center of the hall, he lit a small bonfire that increased with intensity as he poured his qi into it. When the entire hall was warm, he took a seat.

“The four of you have followed me for so long, isn’t it about time for you to come out?” Huang Xiaolong spoke after crossing his legs.

Silence filled the hall, but four cultivators finally entered the temple after several seconds of waiting. They were clad in black robes and the only thing that was visible was their green eyes.

The killing intent that leaked from their bodies were so strong that ordinary people would tremble in fear the moment they met.

Too bad that they ran into Huang Xiaolong. With his awareness, he had discovered their presence the moment he had left the city.

The moment they revealed themselves, Huang Xiaolong smirked and waited for them to break the silence.
