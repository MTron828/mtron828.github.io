Chapter 2611: Going Against Him

“One move?! Are you sure?!” Feng Jiu was finally unable to keep her cool.

Feng Tianwei chuckled in amusement. “Yeah. Who would have thought that I would be able to see your surprised expression? Oh right, he didn’t just send Long Zhenyang flying. Yuan Yue and Jin Buji were sent flying too.”

“What?! What in the world is going on?!” Feng Jiu exclaimed in shock.

Soon after, Feng Tianwei explained everything to her, from how Long Zhenyang and the others had gone up the mountain to chase Huang Xiaolong out of the Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave, to the time when Long Zhenyang had challenged Huang Xiaolong to a duel. He finally spoke about how Huang Xiaolong had beaten everyone down and thrown them out of the Chaos Essence Holy Peak. From the way he spoke, one would think that he was personally present at the scene.

After Feng Tianwei was done, Feng Jiu’s expression was no longer as calm as it once was. Turning to her, Feng Tianwei sighed, “It seems like we have underestimated Huang Xiaolong’s talent and strength.”

In the past, Huang Xiaolong had alerted the entire Otherworldly Mansion after revealing his three saint godheads. Feng Jiu, Feng Tianwei, and various other experts had made an in-depth analysis of Huang Xiaolong’s strength. All of them felt that there were no more than five people who could defeat him under the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm.

As for his talent, they felt that he was equivalent to a True Saint who had a rank-eight or rank-nine saint godhead!

From the combat prowess he had revealed, they had to raise their evaluation of him. He was definitely someone who couldn’t be defeated by a Fourth Heaven True Saint.

After all, Yuan Yue and several experts from the Golden Buddha Race were in the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm. Although they were no geniuses comparable to Long Zhenyang, they were still relatively strong among the Fourth Heaven True Saints. However, they couldn’t even resist a single move from Huang Xiaolong!

Feng Jiu finally managed to calm herself down, and she nodded her head slowly. “Huang Xiaolong has indeed exceeded our expectations. It seems like he’s comparable to someone with a rank-seven saint godhead.”

“Yeah! Who would have thought?!” Feng Tianwei sighed. “Even though his talent isn’t comparable to you, he should be better than Feitian Longpeng. Too bad he’s a human… Otherwise, it would have been possible for him to fight for a spot to become the Mansion Master.”

“I wonder, how old is he…? He might be able to enter the Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm in the next ten thousand years. If he registers then, he might actually be able to successfully challenge the Dao Gate.”

“Do you think Huang Xiaolong will enter our camp?” Feng Jiu asked all of a sudden.

Feng Tianwei shook his head. “Even though I haven’t interacted with him, he seems like someone who refuses to be controlled. He’s extremely arrogant when handling matters. Even if we manage to pull him in, it might not be a good thing for our Fiery Phoenix Race!”

Feng Jiu nodded and remained silent.

Like Feng Jiu, when people like Feitian Longpeng and Chen Muguang heard what had happened on the Chaos Essence Holy Peak, they were stunned silly.

It was especially so for Chen Muguang. Regret flashed through his mind, along with traces of jealousy and rage.

“Young Patriarch, should we pay a visit to Young Master Huang Xiaolong?” the expert from the Chen Luo Sect asked.

In the past, they hadn’t helped Huang Xiaolong when he had stirred up trouble with the Seven Souls Race. Even though Huang Xiaolong was a human, Chen Muguang was unable to put down his pride to greet Huang Xiaolong after the matter was settled.

Rage filled Chen Muguang’s heart when he heard what the man said. “Enough! Enough of this! Do you really think that Huang Xiaolong is hot stuff now that he defeated Long Zhenyang? He offended the Twin Dragon Race and Myriad Origin Race! The Golden Buddha Race and Seven Souls Race are already determined to kill him, and he’s going to die a horrible death after angering two mega superpowers! Do you really want our Chen Luo Sect to go down with him?”

Everyone stared at each other and doubt filled their minds.

Is that the real reason our young patriarch doesn’t want to greet Huang Xiaolong?

Obviously not.

Sighing in their hearts, they pitied themselves for serving such a useless young patriarch.

…

In the courtyard of the vice hall master of the logistics hall, Jin Kang’s expression was extremely ugly when he stared at Jin Buji.

He looked at the cracks around Jin Buji’s armor and the look of suffering on the disciple’s face.

“Useless b*stards!” Jin Kang growled. “You brought so many people over and failed to deal with a single Second Heaven True Saint! You’re an embarrassment to the race!”

Jin Buji didn’t dare to raise his head, and he tried to explain himself, “Third Uncle, you have no idea how terrifying Huang Xiaolong is!”

“Enough! Stop finding excuses for yourself,” Jin Kang roared. However, a sneer formed on his face when he continued, “Whatever. Right now, Huang Xiaolong has offended the Twin Dragon Race and the Myriad Origin Race. There is no longer a need for us to move against him. The two superpowers will definitely deal with him, the human.”

Jin Buji hesitated for a moment, and he suggested, “Third Uncle, Huang Xiaolong is planning to challenge the Dao Gate. It’s the best time for us to deal with him…”

“Call Jin Ke, Jin Zhouwen, and the others over.”

…

Time passed quickly and eleven months passed in a flash.

There was only a month left before the Dao Gate opened.

The number of disciples who signed up this time was off the charts. Even geniuses of the Twin Dragon Race, Myriad Origin Race, and the Golden Buddha Race signed up to compete for the one spot to challenge the Dao Gate. Obviously, their intentions were clear.

After all, the final challenge would be a one-on-one battle among the participants until the last one was standing!

Once the rules were set, Yin Zhangguo went to look for Huang Xiaolong immediately. A look of embarrassment could be seen on his face. The mission hall had always been in charge of deciding the method to choose the individual to challenge the Dao Gate, but the grand hall master had interfered and changed it to a contest of strength.

“Grand Hall Master Yuan Wangfeng?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

“Yes. As you know, the grand hall master is someone from the Myriad Origin Race. Yuan Yue was his descendent.” Yin Zhangguo nodded. “He is extremely protective of Yuan Yue, and you should have gone a little easier on Long Zhenyang and Yuan Yue that day…”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, and he didn’t care about them at all. “If I was merciless, they wouldn’t be able to move about after several months of rest.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Yin Zhangguo widened his eyes in shock, and he shook his head slowly. “You should take care of yourself. Yuan Wangfeng changed the rules this time. No one can admit their defeat in the arena. Moreover, humans cannot make the first move after the battle starts!”

“He’s obviously targeting you with his rules! He’s definitely planning to let the disciples of the Twin Dragon Race, Myriad Origin Race, and the Golden Buddha Race cripple you!”
