Chapter 3290: Salted Vegetables With Rice is a Delicacy

“Yeah! Uncle, Lin Xiaotian tries to put on a front that he’s a proper elder of the Lin Family and he managed to form several connections with the elders of the family. If he refuses to hand them over, we won’t be able to do anything to him…”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had already assisted them in their recovery and pushed their strength up to a whole new level, the two of them had no idea how strong one had to be in order to do something like that!

“Relax. I’m a grand elder of the Huang Family now. Even the Lin Family Patriarch has to show me some respect. Lin Xiaotian wouldn’t dare to hide anything.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Huang Wen and Lin Kai stared at him in shock.

“Brother, have you already broken into the Nascent Soul Realm?!” Huang Wen exclaimed in shock.

Nascent Soul?

Huang Xiaolong nodded and laughed, “Yeah, that’s right. I broke through to the Nascent Soul Realm a long, long time ago…”

As for how long it was, Huang Xiaolong had no idea.

Huang Wen was elated when she heard his reply. “That’s great! I know that with your talent, you will definitely enter the Nascent Soul Realm!”

It was obvious she didn’t pay attention to Huang Xiaolong’s emphasis on a ‘long time’ ago.

Lin Kai was similarly jumping in joy. “Uncle, a grand elder of the Lin Family can earn a thousand low-grade spirit stones a month! Do you get that as a grand elder of the Huang Family?”

Huang Wen glared at him and chided, “You money-faced brat!” Turning to Huang Xiaolong, she chuckled sheepishly, “Ignore him… This little kid’s dream is to earn a thousand low-grade spirit stones, and all he can think about is money!”

However, Lin Kai was serious as he explained his motive, “If I can earn a thousand low-grade spirit stones a month, mother and I will be able to eat spirit beast meat every day! Humph, we won’t have to eat salted vegetables and rice everyday…”

Huang Xiaolong’s smile froze and his expression darkened when he heard what Lin Kai said. “Is that how Lin Xiaotian treats you?!”

As an elder in the Lin Family, Lin Xiaotian definitely has a part in the Lin Family’s business. His income wasn’t low at all, but he fed his wife and son salted vegetables and rice!

“Humph! Getting salted vegetables will be considered a blessing. There are times where we only get soy sauce and white rice! When I try to earn some money myself, Lin Xiaotian will stop me! He even said that if he discovers that I’ve been working, he’ll break my legs!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A trace of coldness flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

When Huang Wen noticed the look on his face, she quickly stopped Lin Kai from saying any more. “Brother, it doesn’t matter! We might have lived a tough life, but we didn’t run into any huge problems!”

Sighing, Huang Xiaolong looked at his sister with a trace of sadness in his eyes. He knew that she was trying to calm him down when she said that. After all, how could one’s life be comfortable if they had to eat soy sauce with rice as members of a noble family?!

“Don’t worry. In the future, you will definitely be able to eat better!” Huang Xiaolong muttered and he retrieved two spatial bags. He handed one to Huang Wen and one to Lin Kai.

“What’s this?” Huang Wen asked with a frown on her face.

“It’s a spatial bag, and each bag contains five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones. You can spend them freely, and buy whatever you wish. If it’s not enough, just let me know.”

“Five… Five… Five hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones?!” Huang Wen and Lin Kai nearly dropped the bag they were holding. Even five hundred thousand gold coins were a fortune for them! Ever since Huang Wen entered the Lin Family, she had never had more than ten thousand gold coins on her!

Lin Kai was shocked too. Even if he earned one thousand low-grade spirit stones per month, he would only be able to get twelve thousand of them a year! He wouldn’t earn that much even if he had forty years of time!

“Brother, where did you get so much money?!” Huang Wen gasped in fright.

“Hahaha, I killed several beasts a few days ago. I traded their inner cores for some spirit stones.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “There’s no need to worry. I didn’t rob a bank for this.”

“That’s… That’s not what I meant!” Huang Wen sighed. “This is too much money! We cannot accept this!” After she spoke, she tried to return the pouch to Huang Xiaolong.

“This is nothing to your big brother. After all, I obtained more than twenty million low-grade spirit stones several days ago. There’s no need to stand on ceremony with me! Just keep it!”

Twenty million low-grade spirit stones!

Huang Wen and Lin Kai stared at him in amazement.

The two of them didn’t even understand what concept twenty million was!

Eventually, Huang Xiaolong managed to persuade them to keep the spirit stones. When they did, they felt their bodies getting heavier by a whole lot, even though it was a mere psychological reaction.

It didn’t take them long to return to the Lin Family. When they returned, Huang Wen and Lin Kai saw that an entire chunk of the Lin Family had been leveled into nothingness and they stared at the scene before them in shock.

“Senior Huang, you’re back!” Lin Guodong, who had been waiting uneasily, yelled the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong. When he saw the mother and son duo following behind him, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He seemed to have seen the light at the end of the tunnel as he welcomed them back.

The grand elders of the Lin Family rushed forward to welcome Huang Xiaolong.

There were looks of fear and respect on their faces, and they no longer dared to call Huang Xiaolong’s full name out loud. Ever since Huang Xiaolong disappeared from the main hall, they seemed to have thought of something! They could also guess that the changes in the Huang Family had something to do with him, and a terrifying image flashed through their minds.

Huang Wen And Lin Kai felt their jaws dropping in fright when they saw how respectful the Lin Family was behaving when they saw Huang Xiaolong.

Snorting lightly, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother too much with their greeting.

Wang Meilan, Huang Jiyuan, Huang Chenfei, and Big Headed Huang slowly made their way over when they saw that Huang Xiaolong was back.

“Are you… Are you Wen’er?” Wang Meilan stared at Huang Wen in shock.

“Mum?” Huang Wen gasped.

When they were making their way back, Huang Xiaolong told Huang Wen about how their parents’ appearances had already returned to their youth. As such, Huang Wen wasn’t too surprised when she saw the change.

With tears streaming down their faces, Huang Wen and Wang Meilan hugged each other without any intention of letting go.

“My dear daughter!”

Huang Jiyuan and the others eventually made their way over and joined the group hug.

The only person who didn’t take part was Huang Xiaolong, and he looked at the members of the Lin Family. He noticed Lin Xiaotian’s sorry appearance as several ladies and their children kneeled beside him. It seemed as though they were all members of Lin Xiaotian’s family.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on Zou Xueqing and Lin Shuang as he saw their bodies trembling in fright.

“Who is Zou Xueqing and Lin Shuang?” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly.

Their bodies shook like a leaf in the wind when Huang Xiaolong called their names.

“Senior Huang, you’re looking right at them!” Lin Guodong pointed at the mother daughter pair instantly.

Zou Xueqing and Lin Shuang were summoned by Lin Xiaotian along with all his other children.

“Did you find out what happened?” Huang Xiaolong stared at Lin Guodong and caused the latter’s knees to go weak.

“Yes, yes, yes. I got to the bottom of the matter.”

“It’s good that you did.” Huang Xiaolong snorted and he made his way over to the mother and daughter pair.
