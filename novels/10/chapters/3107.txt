Chapter 3108: His Highness?!

The experts quickly arrived at the entrance to the Mystical Pavilion’s branch.

However, they didn’t expect to see that all thirty-six genesis level formations would be shattered beyond belief!

There wasn’t even the slightest bit of defense left to protect the branch!

In fact, the Mystical Pavilion’s branch was completely exposed to the outside world, and one could enter as long as one had the courage to walk inside.

The strange scene caused many people to think twice about their actions.

As they looked at the ruins that were once the majestic Mystical Pavilion, they looked at the shattered space and spatial tears surrounded the area, and no one dared to take another step forward.

Even though the battle had ended, the leftover energy lingered in the air.

After a slight moment of hesitation, Eminent Elder Shen Chen of the Nine Dragon Creed said, “Eminent Elder Shen Chen of the Nine Dragon Creed is here to request an audience with Branch Pavilion Master Wangu Xu!”

Eminent Elder Zhang Yuanxun of the Ghost Sea Creed spoke up next. “Eminent Elder Zhang Yuanxun of the Ghost Sea Creed requests an audience with Lord Wangu Xu!”

Many experts requested permission to enter one after another, and all of them were members who held high statuses in their factions.

There were more than thirty creeds at the entrance of the Mystical Pavilion’s branch, and they brought over two thousand men with them. All of them were high-level Dao Venerables. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

With their collective strength, they would be strong enough to take on the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch if they so wanted to.

Several seconds passed after the last person made his request, and a voice rang from inside the branch. “Let them in.”

It was the voice of a young man, and everyone standing at the gates felt a little bewildered. After all, that didn’t sound like Wangu Xu.

“Is that Lord San Song?!” Shen Chen asked.

“It has to be…” The various experts standing around him nodded.

“When we enter, none of you can antagonize the members of the Mystical Pavilion. When we meet Lord San Song and Lord Wangu Xu, all of you need to show utmost respect for them! Do you understand me?” Shen Chen cautioned the members of the Nine Dragon Creed.

As their hearts trembled, all of them nodded in acknowledgment.

Even without Shen Chen’s reminder, none of them would dare to slight someone like Lord Wangu Xu! Not to mention the even more terrifying San Song!

Even though the Nine Dragon Creed was ranked third in the Origin Heavenly Cave, the Mystical Pavilion was a monster who could snuff them out if they so-willed it.

Zhang Yuanxun, and the others also warned their men before entering the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch.

Soon after, several people appeared from the ruins to welcome them. They were junior disciples of the Mystical Pavilion, and the faces of the experts standing at the gates changed when they realized how disrespectful the Mystical Pavilion was being.

However, they kept their dissatisfaction in their heart, and they only showed a frown on their faces when they followed the disciples into the depths of the Mystical Pavilion.

When they finally walked through the rubble and ruins, they finally realized how terrifying the battle was. Some weaker Dao Venerables felt their legs going numb and breathing became a chore. They even felt chills running down their hearts.

They soon arrived at one of the less destroyed halls in the depths of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch.

When they arrived, the experts found that the Mystical Pavilion’s experts were lined up properly with Wangu Xu near the very front. Pang Rui, Mu Guang, and the others were standing beside him.

In front of Wangu Xu stood a figure covered in flames.

As Wangu Xu stood behind him, he was as respectful as could be.

.

Those who just entered felt their hearts skipping a beat when they saw the scene before them.

Shen Chen took a step forward and cupped his fists respectfully, “Shen Chen of the Nine Dragon Creed greets Lord San Song and Lord Wangu Xu!”

The experts of the Nine Dragon Creed didn’t tarry as they bowed respectfully.

Members of the other factions quickly followed suit, and no one dared to show the slightest disrespect.

San Song turned around to look at them, but he remained silent. Ignoring them all, he turned back to stare blankly towards the inner hall.

Wangu Xu and the others were the same, and they seemed to be waiting for someone.

What in the world was going on?! Shen Chen and several other top experts stared at each other, and they felt a sense of suspicion creeping up their hearts.

How could Lord San Song be waiting for someone respectfully?!

A terrifying thought flashed through the minds of those present. Was the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion coming over?!

Their hearts pounded in their chest when they thought of the possibility.

However, there was still an unanswered question. Where were Huang Xiaolong and the others?

When their thoughts turned to the ten trillion dao coins Huang Xiaolong had brought out previously, their thoughts started to sway again. They wanted to bring up the matter of splitting the treasure, but when they saw San Song and Wangu Xu acting so respectfully, they cleverly remained silent.

Everyone stood silently in the hall as they waited for someone to arrive.

The hall was large, and even with the addition of more than two thousand members of the various creeds, it didn’t feel cramped at all.

As two hours crept by, the experts of the various creeds started to grow restless.

They were there to pick up some leftover treasures. None of them were there to accompany the Mystical Pavilion members.

Moreover, there was no way the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion would personally arrive at the branch in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

“Lord San Song, Lord Wangu, we’re here because…” Shen Chen couldn’t hold it in any longer, and he broke the silence. However, a group of people emerged the moment he spoke, and he quickly fell silent. The person leading the way was a young man, and he rode quietly on a three-headed beast.

“Wind Cloud Dao Venerable!” someone yelled in shock.

Shen Chen and the others were equally as shocked. Wouldn’t that mean…

“Huang Xiaolong!”

Shouldn’t Huang Xiaolong already be captured by San Song and the others? Why would he appear from the inner hall?

When everyone was shocked by his sudden arrival, they saw the members of the Mystical Pavilion bowing in unison. “Your Highness!”

His Highness?!

Widening his eyes in shock, he stared at Huang Xiaolong and felt his vision going dark.

This…

Don’t tell me Huang Xiaolong really is the Prince of the Mystical Pavilion?!

The various powers speculated about Huang Xiaolong’s identity in the past, and many people thought that he was the Son of Mystic of the Mystical Pavilion.

However, that shouldn’t be the case, considering the fight that just went down. Didn’t Huang Xiaolong clash with the members of the Mystical Pavilion several hours ago?! The ruins that lay around them was the best proof that the fight was an intense one. Why would the Son of Mystic raze a branch down to the ground?! However, if Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the Son of Mystic, why would they address him as such?!
