Chapter 2911: Silver Shadow Creed

After facing the power of twelve Dao Venerables, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother defending himself as he sent a punch flying towards Di Bai.

Qiao Sheng was taken aback at Huang Xiaolong’s recklessness, but joy soon formed in his heart.

He felt that Huang Xiaolong was insane for taking on the attacks of twelve Dao Venerables at once in order to attack Di Bai. According to him, Huang Xiaolong was rushing towards his death! He refused to believe that Huang Xiaolong would be fine after taking on the attack of twelve Dao Venerables, casually forgetting that Huang Xiaolong had already done so while in a seated position deep in cultivation. The delusional part of him thought that they would be able to injure Huang Xiaolong if not cripple him!

Di Bai roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, even if I have to die, I’ll drag you along!” Cosmos energy emerged from his body and filled the space around them. As they slowly formed grand dao runes, a golden armor formed on the surface of his body. Not shying away from Huang Xiaolong’s punch, he flew straight into it.

As a Dao Venerable, he knew that even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to extinguish his dao soul. As such, he was planning on sacrificing his grand dao physique in order to take the monster of a Primal Ancestor down.

Boom!

When Huang Xiaolong’s punch landed on Di Bai, the attacks of twelve Dao Venerables slammed into him.

Without any surprise, Huang Xiaolong was sent flying along with Di Bai.

A burst of joy filled the hearts of Qiao Sheng and the others.

However, the next scene caused a look of terror to appear in their eyes. They saw how Huang Xiaolong stopped a hundred feet away without the slightest scratch on his body!

Even the robe on his body wasn’t ruffled.

A loud blast shattered their train of thoughts. Turning to look at Di Bai, who was sent flying, they saw that he slammed into one of the larger landmasses in the treasury. The ground shattered under the impact, and a golden flower formed with blood bloomed on Di Bai’s chest. More than half of his body was destroyed, and his golden blood stained the area around him.

Huang Xiaolong’s punch shattered more than half of his body!

Even after cultivating a supreme technique to refine his body, the Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, Di Bai, couldn’t stand a single strike from Huang Xiaolong!

Qiao Sheng and the others sucked in a cold breath. Even Qiao Jin and the others were shocked.

If a Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable had shattered Di Bai’s body with a single punch, they wouldn’t have been surprised as it was nothing they couldn’t understand. However, Huang Xiaolong was no Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable!

As rays of light emerged to swirl around Huang Xiaolong’s body, he laughed aloud as he shot towards Qiao Sheng.

“Again!” Huang Xiaolong roared.

When his voice entered the ears of those present, they felt as though a bucket of ice-cold water was thrown over their heads. Their bodies started to tremble as the blood drained from their faces.

It was especially so for Qiao Sheng, the target of Huang Xiaolong’s attack!

Even someone like Di Bai couldn’t take on a single punch without suffering from serious injuries. How would someone like him fare?!

He could envision his entire body shattering under the attack, and a wretched scream emerged from Qiao Sheng’s lips. “No!”

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wasn’t one to listen to the pleas of his enemies. A terrifying wave of energy entered Qiao Sheng’s body, and he felt as though his body was cracking into a million pieces. The screams of Qiao Baiping and the other expert of the Qiao Family rang beside his ears, but he felt as though the yells came from a million miles away as his body shot through the air.

After dealing with Qiao Sheng, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the rest.

Perhaps they were too afraid of the power he possessed, but none of them dared to move when he stared at them.

Fear took over their hearts when they noticed that he was making his way towards them.

“Lord Huang Xiaolong, we never intended to offend you! Please forgive us!” One of the Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables from the Boundary Emperor Dao Creed begged.

It didn’t take long for the others to start pleading for their lives, and they seemed to come to an agreement that the Mysterious Yin Immortal Cave was Huang Xiaolong’s for the taking. They wanted nothing to do with it, and they hoped Huang Xiaolong could spare them.

“Are you sure you don’t want a single thing from the treasury?” Huang Xiaolong asked with a placid expression.

“Yes, yes, yes, we don’t want anything in here!” A Third Esteem Dao Venerable nodded his head hastily before returning everything he had grabbed previously. Seemingly afraid that Huang Xiaolong would misunderstand, everyone poured their inventories out.

Qiao Dongping and the other member of the Qiao Family were no different.

“It’s too late for this now.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly.

Their expressions changed instantly.

By this time, Di Bai and Qiao Sheng were finally able to get to their feet. Di Bai rose into the skies and roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think you’ll be able to take this for yourself? Since you don’t know what’s good for you, we’ll leave and leak the news to every single creed in the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave! You won’t be able to keep a single dao coin for yourself!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s abilities had shaken the world after his previous battle in Monarch Yu Sacred Land, there would definitely be high-level Dao Venerables who would dare to fight Huang Xiaolong for the treasures!

They might even choose to slay Huang Xiaolong in fears of his retaliation in the future!

A sneer formed on his lips, and Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand. Grand dao runes formed all around the immortal cave and closed off the space connecting the immortal cave to the outside world.

A horrifying pressure descended, and the faces of Di Bai and Qiao Sheng changed instantly. With the power of the restrictions trapping them in, even Di Bai would take several days to fight his way out. There was no way Huang Xiaolong would allow them to bombard the restrictions for several days straight.

“You!” Di Bai was shocked, but rage welled up inside him when he realized that his plan wouldn’t work.

A golden dragon appeared in his view before he could go any further, and the might of a dragon that seemed to control everything under the heavens filled the immortal cave. Facing the might of the dragon, the Dao Venerables felt as though they were smaller than a speck of dust.

As they stared at the golden dragon behind Huang Xiaolong, a look of disbelief formed on the faces of Qiao Sheng and Di Bai.

…

After showing off his strength, Huang Xiaolong revealed his true identity. Eventually, all those who had come submitted to him.

Instead of leaving the immortal cave immediately, Huang Xiaolong chose to refine the grand dao pills in order to solidify his foundations. He refined the black pool at the same time, increasing the power of absolute poison in him.

After two whole months, he finally left.

Estimating the time, he knew that there were seven to eight months before the agreed time with the members of the Mystical Pavilion. As such, he decided to make a trip over to the Silver Shadow Creed to cure Yin Yue’s mother.

Making up his mind, he flew towards the Silver Shadow Creed.

Since Long Jianfei and the others were still recovering, he didn’t choose to bring them along. He went alone, and he left them in the Emperor Boundary Creed to heal their wounds.

After a month, Huang Xiaolong appeared in the space above the Silver Shadow Creed.
