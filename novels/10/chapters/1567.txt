Huang Xiaolong ignored Zhou Chen’s accusation and he continued to explain, “They wanted me to hand over the low-grade chaos spiritual veins that I had won from the Fiend God Emperor Palace. I declined and they tried using force to achieve their goals. I had no choice but to order Xiang Xun to make a move.”

“So that was what happened!” Zhao Lei furiously said, “How dare those damnable elders from the Brightness Emperor Palace bully my disciple! The next time I see Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang, I swear that I will chop off their lower half!”

Chen Hao who was sitting at the side started sweating the moment he heard that.

Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly as he didn’t expect his Master to swear in front of everybody. However, he felt a trace of warmth in his heart. He knew that the care his Master had for him came from the bottom of his heart.

Fang Gan was also enraged, “Not only was Tian Ziyi the one who wanted to steal Xiaolong’s low-grade chaos spiritual veins, he even made up a story to frame Xiaolong when he failed to do so! What is this nonsense?!”

Li Shan added, “The Brightness Emperor Palace is too much of a bully! Even though they might be the second ranked emperor palace, it doesn’t mean that they can do whatever they want!”

Chen Yirong spoke up to support Huang Xiaolong as well.

“Huang Xiaolong, how do you prove that you spoke the truth? What if you’re the one making up a story to lie to us?!” Zhuo Chen questioned, “You probably already planned what to say after returning to our Fortune Emperor Palace. I admit that it is well crafted... your version of the story makes you sound like the victim instead...”

Zhao Lei’s face turned cold.

Huang Xiaolong had expected Zhou Chen to pursue this matter till the end, so he continued, “Fortune Emperor, Master, this is the image recording stone that I used to record the incident.”

He then handed over a spiritual stone to Fang Gan.

Once Fang Gan circulated his godforce, the image recording stone immediately burst into rays of light and reflected the scene on top of the Heaven Eye Mountain Range when Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang confronted him. It showed the whole incident from that day, from how Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang had accused Huang Xiaolong of finding the low-grade demonic chaos spiritual veins to when they demanded Huang Xiaolong to hand over his spirit ring for inspection. They even had their designs on the low-grade chaos spiritual veins Huang Xiaolong had obtained from the Fiend God Emperor Palace.

Zhou Chen’s face started to turn unsightly.

However, he was furious in his heart. If Huang Xiaolong had this image recording stone as proof, why did he purposely take it after everyone accused him of the crime? He is definitely trying to embarrass me in front of everyone!

After watching the entire scene play out, Zhao Lei impolitely asked, “Elder Zhou Chen, is this enough proof that everything my disciple has said is true?”

Zhou Chen’s face changed and he immediately smiled, “Of course! Everything I said in the past was out of concern for your disciple! After all this matter is related to the Brightness Emperor Palace and we have to be careful about it.”

Zhao Lei snorted and didn’t bother replying.

Fang Gan smiled at Huang Xiaolong, “Now that we know the truth of the matter, Xiaolong, you must have felt wronged about this whole incident. You won’t blame Uncle Fang for asking you to rush back to clarify this matter right?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “I understand that Uncle Fang did it out of concern for me.” He paused before continuing, “Regarding this matter, I don’t feel wronged at all. In fact, I think that they suffered quite a bit that day...”

Thinking back to the scene when Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxiang, and the rest of them had their godforce sealed as they rolled down the Heaven Eye Mountain Range, everyone burst into laughter.

Zhao Lei grinned and said, “If it was me, I would have stripped them before throwing them off!”

Another round of laughter filled the room.

Fang Gan, Li Shan, and a few others then left a few words of encouragement before leaving. Other than Zhou Chen who had a solemn expression on his face, the rest of them all had faces full of smiles when they left.

Zhao Lei looked at Zhou Chen’s back and sneered, “This old bastard.”

He then turned around and told Huang Xiaolong, “Xiaolong, let’s have a few good drinks today.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled in response, “This time, I brought back some good alcohol from the Floating Twilight Land for Master.”

Zhao Lei’s eyes sparked, “What’s there to drink?!”

Huang Xiaolong then took out the dragon rain wine that he had obtained from the barbarian space.

The second Zhao Lei opened the cap, the fragrance of alcohol filled the room.

......

One day later.

Huang Xiaolong smiled helplessly as he finally left Zhao Lei’s palace. If he had not mentioned the fact that Yao Chi and Li Lu were waiting for him at Dragon Tiger Palace, he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to leave.

After leaving his Master’s palace, Huang Xiaolong rode the little cow and returned to the Dragon Tiger Palace. Thinking about how Yao Chi was waiting for him back there, a fire started to burn in his heart. The urge to return grew stronger with every passing moment.

“Kiddo Huang, tonight you better prepare a few chaos restrictions.” The little cow suddenly piped up.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

Why would I need to prepare a few chaos restrictions when I get back?

For a moment, he was confused. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The little cow rolled her eyes and said, “The previous time you did it, Yao Chi’s loud cries filled the entire palace! Even this old woman felt her heart fluttering...”

Huang Xiaolong’s face started to redden and black lines appeared on his forehead.

Meanwhile, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel pretended to be deaf and mute as they raised their heads to look at the beautiful sky above them.

When they finally arrived at the Dragon Tiger Palace, Huang Xiaolong hastily set up several chaos restrictions before doing his deed. Even though Yao Chi’s cries weren’t as exaggerated as the little cow said, it was still pretty loud.

After the restrictions were set, Huang Xiaolong no longer held himself back. The two of them soared through the skies as their bodies intertwined. They started rising up into the air as they carried out their intense ‘exercise’.

Doing it in the air wasn’t something mere mortals could learn. However, it was easily achieved by Huang Xiaolong.

A couple of days later, Huang Xiaolong finally left Yao Chi’s room.

When he arrived at his courtyard, the little cow gave him a thumbs up. There was a smug smirk sitting on her face when she looked at him.

For the next three months, Huang Xiaolong chatted with Li Lu and Yao Chi in the Dragon Tiger Palace. When Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao came over, the conversation became more lively.

These days of peace were the envy of others.

Three months passed quickly and Huang Xiaolong left the Dragon Tiger Palace and headed towards the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

Even though there was still a month before the selection, it was the first day of registrations. The Hall of Supreme Harmony was where he had taken the registration examination in the past.

This time round, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bring Li Lu or Yao Chi. Instead, he was planning to sign up alone.

When he arrived at Hall of Supreme Harmony, the entire hall was bustling with noise and excitement. Other than some disciples who were there to sign up, there were some handing out missions. There were at least a few thousand disciples here.

“Senior Huang!”

“It’s Senior Huang!”

When they noticed Huang Xiaolong in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, many of the disciples became restless and quite a number of them greeted him politely. As he rarely appeared in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, he caused an uproar the moment he entered..

Under the gaze of the many disciples, Huang Xiaolong walked in the direction of the registration counter for the selections.

There was already a line at the counter. When they saw Huang Xiaolong walking towards the registration counter, everyone was shocked.
