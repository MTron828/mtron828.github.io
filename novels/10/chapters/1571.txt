Sun Shihai said with a smile, “That’s right, after the selections tomorrow, this palace will belong to me! You’re going to have to leave immediately!”

Huang Xiaolong became even more puzzled, why would the palace be his after the selections?!

Sun Shihai saw the confusion on Huang Xiaolong’s face and explained, “Do you still not understand? Let me explain it to you. Once I defeat you tomorrow, I will be able to prove myself! Your King of Supreme Godhead is nothing more than decoration and since this is the best palace in the Fortune Divine Kingdom with the exception of the Sect Chief and Elders’ Palaces, only the most talented disciple deserves to live in it!”

“Once I defeat you, my master will raise this matter to the Fortune Emperor. No matter how biased the Sect Chief is towards you, he won’t possibly be able to ignore my Master’s decision!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed as he finally understood what was going on.

Upon seeing this, Sun Shihai asked, “Why are you laughing?”

“Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with your brain?” Huang Xiaolong’s smile didn’t fade as he continued to question.

Sun Shihai was stunned, but fury overwhelmed him in the next moment. “Huang Xiaolong, don’t think that I won’t dare to cripple you just because the Sect Chief is looking out for you!”

“Sun Shihai, what are you trying to do?” A lovable voice echoed from the surrounding space.

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao appeared and they slowly flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

When Sun Shihai saw that the newcomers were Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao, he couldn’t help but retract his previous arrogance. “It seems like Young Lady Xuanxuan is here. I was just chatting with Huang Xiaolong about some random matters.”

Even though he was arrogant, he didn’t dare to act out of line in front of Fang Xuanxuan. After all, she was Fang Gan’s daughter.

“Are you done? If you are, you can take your leave.” Peng Xiao chirped in.

Sun Shihai felt jealousy and anger boil in his heart when he saw that Peng Xiao was siding with Huang Xiaolong. However, he quickly suppressed the rage building up in his heart and said, “Huang Xiaolong, see you tomorrow in the arena. I won’t bother holding myself back. I hope that you will be able to last at least five moves...”

After he finished speaking, he ignored the two women and flew straight into the air.

The two of them became slightly angry when they heard his cocky declaration.

Wasn’t he implying that he could defeat Huang Xiaolong in five moves?

“What five moves is he talking about? Sun Shihai is really overestimating himself.” Fang Xuanxuan looked at Sun Shihai’s back and mocked.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the two of them and a bright smile appeared on his face, “I almost wanted to tell him that I can defeat him in one move.”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao were stunned for a moment and they broke out laughing before long.

“It seems that you are even crazier than Sun Shihai...” Fang Xuanxuan teased.

Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders and replied, “To make lunatics fear you, you have to be crazier than them.”

The two girls broke into laughter again.

Peng Xiao said, “In the future, I will use your method and see if it works.”

“Why did the two of you come over anyway?” Huang Xiaolong no longer felt like speaking about Sun Shihai and he quickly changed the topic.

“We heard that you haven’t been running around for the past few days and we decided to visit you since we have nothing else to do.” Fang Xuanxuan tried to explain herself, but her heartbeat started to speed up when she spoke about visiting him.

Peng Xiao pouted and asked, “What’s the problem? Are we not welcome here?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “It is my honor to host two beauties in my Palace. Of course I’ll welcome you.” He paused for a moment and gestured with his arm to welcome them, “May the two beauties come in and take a seat.”

Fang Xuanxuan covered her mouth and giggled, “That’s more like it.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The two of them then followed Huang Xiaolong into the palace.

When they found a seat, Peng Xiao asked, “What did Sun Shihai ask you?”

As he had no intentions to hide the truth, Huang Xiaolong repeated everything Sun Shihai had said. After hearing his side of the story, the two of them almost erupted with rage.

“Xiaolong, if you really meet Sun Shihai in the selections tomorrow, will you be alright?” Peng Xiao asked with a face full of concern.

They don’t think I stand a chance against Sun Shihai...

“What do you mean by that? If I really meet him in the selections tomorrow, I’ll beat him till his master can’t recognize him!” Huang Xiaolong jested.

The two of them giggled immediately after the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Fang Xuanxuan chided, “How are you still in the mood to joke?!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “I’m not joking, I’m serious.”

Peng Xiao rolled her eyes at Huang Xiaolong, “Okay, okay we know you are not kidding. Is that enough?”

Despite whatever she said, the expressions on their faces betrayed their real thoughts. They definitely didn’t believe that he was serious about it.

Huang Xiaolong revealed a helpless expression. From the looks of it, other than Li Lu, no one else believed in him.

After an hour of bantering, Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao left. Huang Xiaolong didn’t try to improve his cultivation. Instead, he took out the Netherworld King’s Jade that belonged to the King of Hell.

After Huang Xiaolong had refined the third set of restrictions in the Netherworld King’s Jade, he had formed a faint connection with the power of darkness in it. The power of darkness had always been slowly tempering his True Dragon Physique and his avatars.

Huang Xiaolong estimated that once he reached the Seventh Order God King Realm, he would be able to refine the fourth set of restrictions of the Netherworld King’s Jade.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong also took out the Nine Yin Magic Mirror that he had obtained from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. Looking at the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, he shook his head. Despite his years of research, he wasn’t able to find a way to refine it. It seemed that if he wanted to refine the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, he would have to listen to the little cow and find the Ancient Heavenly Court Treasure.

It seemed as though he would only be able to refine the Nine Yin Magic Mirror after obtaining the memories of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor.

When Huang Xiaolong placed the Netherworld King’s Jade and Nine Yin Magic Mirror together, they started to emit a type of soft, yet chilly, light. As both objects belonged to the darkness, with the Netherworld King’s Jade belonging to the King of Hell, and the Nine Yin Magic Mirror belonging to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, the two objects seemed to resonate with each other.

A moment later. Huang Xiaolong’s summoning signal vibrated. He took it out and saw that Zhao Lei was summoning him. He had no choice but to keep the Netherworld King’s Jade and the Nine Yin Magic Mirror away, as he left straight for Zhao Lei’s palace.

Once he arrived, Zhao Lei immediately started nagging about everything he should be paying attention to during the selections. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t do anything but listen obediently.

One day passed quickly.

Under the anticipation of countless disciples of the Fortune Emperor Palace, the sun gradually rose.

Huang Xiaolong followed behind his master and senior brother into the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

Just like any other competition, the selection was held in the main hall of the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

When they arrived at Hall of Supreme Harmony, many disciples, Elders, as well as Hall Masters were already present.

“Chief of Hall Masters!”

Once Huang Xiaolong and his master, Zhao Lei, arrived in the hall, everyone stood up to greet him.

Zhao Lei acknowledged the masses and made his way to the viewing platform. As for Huang Xiaolong, he joined the other participating disciples in the holding area.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the audience and noticed Li Lu and Yao Chi. A smile broke out on his face and he nodded at them.

“Ancestor Zhou Chen has arrived!” The arrival of Zhou Chen stirred everyone up once again.
