Chapter 2352: Ten Years Later

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Devil Cave, the person in charge of the Devil Cave, Elder Zhang Sijin, was already waiting for Huang Xiaolong outside the Devil Cave’s entrance.

After spotting Huang Xiaolong from a distance, Zhang Sijin hurried towards Huang Xiaolong with a smile and saluted him respectfully, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, you’re here!”

This was a similar scene where a loyal servant would welcome the housemaster home.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and said, “Elder Zhang Sijin, it has been a few months since we last met. You look even more spirited.”

Upon hearing Huang Xiaolong’s ‘words of concern,’ Zhang Sijin felt his feet were going lighter, and he straightened his shoulders. The smile on his face grew brighter. “This is due to Your Highness’ blessing.”

In fact, his words were not mere flattery.

The last time Huang Xiaolong had come to the Devil Cave to challenge the Devil Palace’s disciples, not only his strength had improved significantly, but he had also greatly raised the rank of his complete dao saint godheads. Thus the four Primal Ancestors had ordered Wu Ge to give Zhang Sijin a big reward.

Zhang Sijin naturally looked more spirited than ever after getting a big reward that was personally given by the Grand Hall Master Wu Ge himself.

Huang Xiaolong’s smile widened a fraction after hearing Zhang Sijin’s response, and the two proceeded to enter the Devil Cave.

Upon entering the Devil Cave, Huang Xiaolong did not linger around, and headed straight to the arena area.

Upon watching Huang Xiaolong’s action, Zhang Sijin immediately understood Huang Xiaolong’s intention. He bowed slightly as he inquired, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, should I have someone send over some of these Devil Palace disciples’ details?”

“No need, I am not done challenging the ones I picked the last time.” Huang Xiaolong added, “I’ll let you know when I need more.”

Zhang Sijin acknowledged respectfully.

On further thought, Huang Xiaolong added again, “This time, the first one I want to challenge is the Devil Palace’s disciple at the 30,000th stage.

The disciple at the 30,000th stage was called Qu Yuyuan, who had a complete dao saint godhead ranked ninety-nine. Qu Yuyuan’s saint bloodline also ranked in the top one hundred, at ninety-seven.

Qu Quyuan’s cultivation realm was at the peak late-Fourth Order Venerable.

“Yes, the subordinate will go make the arrangements now!” Zhang Sijin did not doubt Huang Xiaolong’s decision at all, and hurried away to prepare for Huang Xiaolong’s challenge.

Originally, when a Holy Heavens’ disciple entered the Devil Cave to challenge Devil Place’s disciples in the arena, he needed to go through a series of procedures, and the disciples needed to handle them personally. Not to mention the several hours of waiting that they needed to do. However, the procedures for Huang Xiaolong’s every challenge were handled by Zhang Sijin. This saved Huang Xiaolong a lot of trouble and time.

It wasn’t long before Zhang Sijin returned after completing the necessary procedures for Huang Xiaolong, and then he accompanied Huang Xiaolong towards the stage number thirty thousand.

In the short time it took Huang Xiaolong to reach the 30,000th stage, the stage’s surroundings were already crowded with Holy Heavens’ disciples.

Huang Xiaolong was caught off guard by the crowd. He hadn’t arrived at the Devil Cave for long, yet so many disciples had gotten wind of it. It seemed that news traveled really fast around here.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong!”

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong!”

From afar, these Holy Heavens’ disciples saluted Huang Xiaolong with respect and great enthusiasm.

Huang Xiaolong nodded at the crowd then leaped onto the stage.

There was a middle-aged bald man sitting cross-legged on the battle stage, black devilish runes ran down his face. This was the peak late-Fourth Order Venerable Devil Palace’s disciple, Qu Yuyuan.

......

A minute later.

On stage number 30,000, Qu Yuyuan laid lifeless.

Although Qu Yuyuan was a peak late-Fourth Order Venerable expert that possessed a complete dao saint godhead in the top hundred, he did not pose any danger to the current Huang Xiaolong.

Even before Huang Xiaolong had cultivated at the Fire and Ice Lake, it would not have taken much of an effort for him to kill Qu Yuyuan. Not to mention that Huang Xiaolong was much stronger now. His soul had transformed, getting closer to becoming a holy soul and his cultivation had entered mid-Fourth Order Venerable from early Fourth Order Venerable Realm.

After devouring Qu Yuyuan’s complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline, Huang Xiaolong did not stop. He left the scene then entered a chamber to cultivate and absorb the energies from Qu Yuyuan’s complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline.

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads, saint bloodlines, and saint physiques’ absorption speed, he could fully absorb Qu Yuyuan’s complete dao saint godhead and saint bloodline in a day’s time.

On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong opted to refine level-nine origin spiritual pills this time.

Although the absorption speed of his three complete dao saint godheads was shocking, his current mid-Fourth Order Venerable Realm was still a limitation. In one day, he could only refine one level-nine origin spiritual pill.

The night passed peacefully.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the chamber the next day and continued challenging disciples.

Similar to the last time, Huang Xiaolong maintained a schedule of challenging one Devil Palace’s disciple a day, then devouring their saint attributes and cultivation, and growing stronger.

Huang Xiaolong went through the same routine day after day.

Although the days were monotonous, Huang Xiaolong could not be more delighted at his progress. He could feel that his complete dao saint godheads, saint bloodlines, and saint physiques continued to evolve.

Two months later, Huang Xiaolong began challenging Devil Palace’s disciples with a complete dao saint godhead in the top eighties.

Four months later were disciples in the top seventies.

Half a year later, it was the top sixties.

The eight months later, it was top fifties.

One year later, it was top forties.

Although the evolution speed of Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads had slowed down and it had become more difficult in the last stages as he continued to devour the Devil Palace’s disciples’ saint attributes during this one year period, his complete dao saint godheads had jumped into the two hundred ranks. On top of that, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had advanced to late-Fourth Order Venerable.

A year later, Huang Xiaolong began challenging mid-Fifth Order and late-Fifth Order Venerable Realm Devil Palace’s disciples. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

These Devil Palace disciples generally possessed complete dao saint godhead in the top fifties.

Then again, these Devil Palace disciples generally possessed two of the three saint attributes. Hence their battle power was much weaker than the Clear Snow Palace’s female disciple Zhao Ya and the Holy Lands Alliance’s disciple Liang Qin.

Another year passed.

The third year Huang Xiaolong entered the Devil Cave, he began challenging Devil Palace disciples that possessed complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique.

Though there were not many among the imprisoned Devil Palace’s disciples that possessed complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique simultaneously, there were still two hundred plus of them who were below Seventh Order Venerable.

Devouring Devil Palace’s disciples with all three saint attributes enabled Huang Xiaolong’s three saint attributes to evolve simultaneously, achieving a balanced progress. This eliminated many problems.

The only regret was that the rankings of these Devil Place’s disciples with all three saint attributes were not high. In general, most of them ranked outside a hundred. Those with all three saint attributes within the top one hundred were rare, and at the moment, there were only a dozen or so in the Devil Cave.

In the blink of an eye, it was already ten years.

On this day, a figure slowly walked out from the Devil Cave. This person was precisely Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong had spent ten years challenging everyday, without taking a day’s break in between. Huang Xiaolong’s forty thousand plus contribution points had finally dwindled down to zero.

Huang Xiaolong raised his head and looked at the sun in the sky. He felt like it was shining all too bright. He let the bright sunlight fall on him, feeling especially comfortable and warm.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong!”

Elder Zhang Sijin was hurrying out from the Devil Cave as he asked, “Your Highness, are you leaving?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded, “Yes ah! I have no more contribution points, so I have to leave.”

After looking at Zhang Sijin’s reluctant face, Huang Xiaolong patted his shoulder, and comforted, “Don’t worry, I will come again!”

Wait until he had earned enough contribution points, he would come here again, to continue raising the ranks of his saint attributes.
