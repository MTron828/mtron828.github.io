Chapter 3328: Now?

“I wonder which expert from the Purple Flame Sect will come to Earth…”

“Whatever the case, the Purple Flame Sect is one the three strongest sects in the Flowing Flame Star! Their true strength surpasses the Six Swords Gate and the Hidden Dragon Star! Anyone sent by them will definitely be stronger than the others!”

Rumors continued to spread through the earth and the various factions erupted into chaos.

It was even more so for the sects involved. In the headquarters of the Six Swords Gate, Wang Zheng roared with laughter as a sinister smile hung on his face. “The heavens are helping me! Huang Xiaolong, let’s see how you weasel your way out of this one!”

A grin hung on Fu Wu’s face. “When my master and my martial uncle arrive, we will move immediately! We shall kill Huang Xiaolong and everyone he cares for! Everyone related to him will die!”

Wang Zheng continued, “Hahaha! I can’t wait!”

“Relax. My master and my martial uncle will be here in three days at the very latest!” Fu Wu chuckled. “Just wait for three more days.”

“Alright! I’ll let that son of a b*tch stay alive to watch three more sunrises!” Wang Zheng snickered.

“Old Ancestor, Eminent Elder...” One of the grand elders ran into the room and reported, “Zhang Wanqing of the Zhang Family brought four grand elders over. All of them hope to submit to our Six Swords Gate so that we will spare their lives.”

Wang Zheng chuckled in amusement, “Zhang Wanqing is pretty interesting. It’s too bad she’s useless now that Huang Xiaolong crippled her qi veins.”

Fu Wu shook his hand and explained, “Even though she’s a cripple, she is extremely important when it comes to placating the grand elders and elders of the Zhang Family. We can always kill her when we bring them over to our side.”

The Six Swords Gate was naturally disinclined to keep useless people.

It was a pity. She had no idea she was already a dead person in the eyes of the faction.

…

In the Blue Dragon Orchard, Huang Shengan reported everything he heard to Huang Xiaolong. He spoke about how experts in the Spirit Severing Realm would be heading over to Earth, and the Ice Palace even sent two high-level Spirit Severing Realm experts this time!

“As for the Purple Flame Sect, they only sent a single expert over. His name is Ren Qi.” Huang Shengan glanced at Huang Xiaolong. “He should be a Ninth Level Spirit Severing Realm expert.”

That was the Ninth Level Spirit Severing Realm they were talking about!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

To Huang Shengan, someone at that level was basically God!

Even a First Level Spirit Severing Realm expert was an existence akin to the heavens!

There were once several people who said that even the six strongest experts on Earth wouldn’t be able to defeat a First Level Spirit Severing Realm expert even if they worked together. One could only imagine how terrifying they were!

There wasn’t even a need to describe the strength of an expert at the high-level Spirit Severing Realm!

Huang Xiaolong nodded casually when he heard the news.

“There are countless families spreading rumors in the Huaxia Alliance. They say that Your Highness will definitely be killed the moment the experts arrive! According to them, the Huang Family is doomed! Right now, everyone in the Huang Family is panicking…” Huang Shengan lowered his head, and he muttered in embarrassment.

“Who started it?” 

“The main culprits are the Zou and Chu Families. The Liu and Lin families are in on it too…” Hesitating for a moment, Huang Shengan decided to continue, “The Sun and Tan Families are planning to change sides too.”

“Tan Bi?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

In the past, the Tan Family tried to take over the Huang Family’s assets and Huang Xiaolong decided to let them off because of Tan Wei’s relationship with Huang Bisheng. He even gave the other party ten Blue Dragon Pills so that he could enter the Enlightenment Realm.

Now, Tan Bi was actually planning to go against the Huang Family!

As for Lin Xiaotian, they were part of the families who were spreading sh*t about the Huang Family!

“Yes. After Tan Bi entered the Enlightenment Realm, he forbade all disciples of the Tan Family from interacting with our Huang Family. Sun Yao did the same.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed, “It’s a shame… I overestimated their loyalty.”

He didn’t use the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to control any of them, and it seemed as though all of them were planning to revolt now that they knew Spirit Severing Realm cultivators were coming to deal with the Huang Family.

“Your Highness, do you think we should warn the Lin, Sun, and Tan Families?” 

“No. They will beg for forgiveness in a few days,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t really care about everything that happened on the other planets or stars around Earth.

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong continued to advise everyone as they cultivated, and he passed his days comfortably.

“Ancestor Ren Qi of the Purple Flame Sect has arrived! He captured Yuan Hui the moment he arrived, and he crippled his qi veins! After sending him to prison immediately, Ancestor Ren Qi said that Huang Xiaolong was to head over to the Purple Flame Sect to apologize for his mistakes! If he refuses to do so, he will kill everyone in the Huang Family!” 

There are countless experts who had no idea who Ren Qi was, and they jumped in fright when they heard about him.

“Ninth Level Spirit Severing Realm!”

…

In the Tan Family.

“Grandpa, how can you do this?!” Tan Wei snapped as she looked at Tan Bi.

“I did all of this for the Tan Family! From this moment onwards, you are not allowed to talk to Huang Bisheng. If you do, I’ll expel you from the Tan Family!” Turning to Tan Guanghai, he ordered, “Take care of Wei’er. Do not allow her to leave the compound.”

“If Huang Bisheng comes over to meet her, there’s no need to entertain him. Kick him out.” Tan Bi continued, “Just tell him she isn’t here.”

…

In the Blue Dragon Orchard, Huang Xiaolong nearly laughed out loud when he heard Ren Qi’s order.

“Since that’s the case, you can prepare the flying ship now. I’ll head over immediately,” Huang Xiaolong muttered casually.

“Your Highness, you’re planning to head over there now?!”

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Contact the disciples of the Purple Flame Sect. Tell them I’ll be there soon.”

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s flying ship traveled slowly towards the Purple Flame Sect.

As soon as he emerged from the manor, the various families received news on it.

“Hahaha! Ancestor Ren Qi gave him two days, but he’s heading there the moment he heard the news! What a loser!”

“And here I thought that Huang Xiaolong is someone with a backbone!”

“No sh*t! In order to live, he has to do it!”

Everyone joked at the fact that Huang Xiaolong was a spineless b*stard!
