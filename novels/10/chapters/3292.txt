Chapter 3293: Eastern University

The Ying Family’s order caused the commotion to turn even bigger.

The Huaxia Alliance wasn’t the only one that was affected, and the other seven great alliances trembled in fear. The six great sects were also affected by the sudden change in situation as the Divine Court Sect, Purple Flame Sect, Six Swords Gate, Blade Gate, Ghost Valley, and the Ice Palace set their gazes on the Huang Family.

When all the greatest factions on Earth focused on the Huang Family, Huang Xin was kneeling before Huang Xiaolong in the courtyard of the Blue Dragon Orchard. Before Huang Xiaolong headed for the Ha Province, he assisted Huang Xin in breaking through to the Enlightenment Realm. With the assistance of the Grand Complete Heavenly Formation, Huang Xin had already stabilized his foundations.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the kneeling Huang Xin and chuckled, “You can get up now.”

Kowtowing once, Huang Xin finally got to his feet.

Grand Elder Huang Qi, Huang Feiwu, and the others stared at Huang Xin enviously. Entering the Enlightenment Realm didn’t just mean that one’s power and prestige would rise. One’s lifespan would also be extended to a thousand years! There wasn’t any Nascent Soul Realm expert who didn’t wish to enter the Enlightenment Realm!

“As long as all of you do your best in the future, breaking into the Enlightenment Realm is a matter of time.” Huang Xiaolong reassured them all.

With looks of excitement on their faces, all of them fell to their knees.

Allowing all of them to get up, Huang Xiaolong started to stroll around the Blue Dragon Orchard. Huang Shengan and the others followed closely behind.

“Your Highness, we did everything you instructed us to do.” Huang Shengan reported respectfully. He handed over the deed to all the land around the courtyard to Huang Xiaolong without the slightest delay. Holding the items in his hands, Huang Xiaolong nodded in satisfaction, “Good job.”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised that Huang Shengan was able to buy over all the land around the courtyard in such a short amount of time. It showed how serious Huang Shengan was about the matter.

“This is a Blue Dragon Pill and I personally refined it. It’s of great use to a cultivator in the Enlightenment Realm. Refine it when you get back.” Huang Xiaolong handed over a pill to Huang Shengan. The pill was a pretty blue color, and pastel blue qi rolled about in it and they vaguely resembled a dragon.

The Blue Dragon Pill was something Huang Xiaolong refined using the herbs in the Orchard. He made a total of ten furnaces, and there were three hundred pills in total.

Huang Shengan rejoiced when he held the pill in his hand as he thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely.

Since Huang Xiaolong said that the pill would be of great help to him, no one would doubt the man.

Soon after, Huang Shengan reported to Huang Xiaolong about the sales of the spiritual fruits. According to Huang Xiaolong’s decision, they branded the insignia of the Blue Dragon onto the fruits when they sold.

“There were more than a million orders today, and all the spiritual fruits we had for sale sold out in less than two hours!” Huang Shengan exclaimed in glee.

Chuckling softly, Huang Xiaolong complimented them, “That’s not too bad. We can start expanding the market to the capital city and the other large cities in the alliance. Oh right, you can start selling the spiritual herbs in the garden from tomorrow onwards.”

Nodding happily, Huang Shengan acknowledged the order.

After handing Huang Shengan another million low-grade spirit stones, he asked the man to look for another batch of seeds. When they transformed the surrounding land around the Blue Dragon Orchard, he would plant them immediately.

It didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to circle the garden once.

When he left for the Lin Family, half the garden was empty. However, it seemed as though Huang Shengan and the others had worked hard as they filled the remaining land with seeds before he returned. It wouldn’t take long for them to turn into mature trees…

“I will be going to the Eastern University with my nephew the day after tomorrow. Go get an admission letter for me.” Huang Xiaolong seemed to have thought of something and he quickly ordered.

As the Eastern University would be resuming classes in two days, Lin Kai had to return. Huang Xiaolong’s idea had always been to head on over, and tagging along with Lin Kai would save him a lot of trouble.

Bowing in acknowledgement, Huang Shengan passed down the order instantly.

Ordinarily, only students and lecturers of the Eastern University would be able to enter the campus as they pleased. However, the Huang Family’s reputation wasn’t just for show. As one of the largest cultivation families in the Huaxia Alliance, getting an admission letter was something that took a snap of their fingers.

Huang Shengan and the others soon took their leave.

With the Sun and Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong turned the land around the Blue Dragon Orchard into divine soil, and he expanded the walls around the courtyard. In the blink of an eye, the entire plot of land became part of his residence.

The Blue Dragon Orchard expanded to nearly twice its size.

As night fell, the Huang Family organized another banquet, but things were a little different this time. Huang Xiaolong, Huang Jiyuan, Wang Meilan, Huang Chenfei, Huang Wen, Huang Bisheng, and Lin Kai were the only ones in attendance.

There were countless spiritual fruits and spiritual beast meat on the table for all of them to enjoy.

As the family had a meal together, memories flooded Huang Xiaolong’s mind. A hundred years ago, on Earth, that was also how they enjoyed their meals.

The feeling of being an ordinary mortal wasn’t too bad after all…

“Xiaolong, why don’t we invite Young Lady Tan Wei over to our family?” Wang Meilan chuckled as she looked at Huang Xiaolong. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Hehe, Don’t look at me. Just ask the little brat over there.” Huang Xiaolong laughed in response.

As everyone turned to look at Huang Bisheng, he lowered his head in embarrassment.

“Big Brother Bisheng, do you already have a girlfriend?” Lin Kai asked.

Blood rushed to his face and Huang Bisheng waved his hand frantically before him. “No, no! We’re just ordinary friends…”

Huang Jiyuan stared at the little brat and he snapped, “When I met your grandmother in the past, we were also friends…”

Huang Bisheng’s face turned even redder.

Wang Meilan made the decision almost instantly as she sent Tan Wei an invitation for the very next day.

When the banquet finally ended, the moon was hanging high in the night sky. Huang Xiaolong continued to coach Huang Wen and Lin Kai on several martial arts, and the night passed in a flash. When he looked at them again the next day, he was heartened to see that they made significant progress. He discovered that Lin Kai’s comprehension abilities were pretty good, and his memory was top notch. Lin Kai remembered everything Huang Xiaolong said, and he understood most of it.

When Lin Kai saw the look of admiration on Huang Xiaolong’s face, a sheepish smile appeared on his face. “My talent isn’t even the best in my class. I’m slightly above average at best! In my class, Ying Huitian should be the most talented person, and she can also be said to be the strongest talent in the entire university!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly. “Is she from that Ying Family?”

“Yeah… I heard that her father is some big shot in the Ying Family.” After he explained her identity, he added some information Huang Xiaolong needed to know before entering the university.

“Big Brother, the members of the Tan Family have arrived!” Huang Chenfei entered the courtyard and announced.

Turning to look at the skies that were barely lit, Huang Xiaolong chuckled in his heart. The members of the Tan Family were too damn early! “Looks like Tan Bi is really impatient…”

“He probably hasn’t slept since he received the invitation!” Huang Chenfei roared with laughter.

He wasn’t wrong. The moment he received the invitation from Wang Meilan, Tan Bi didn’t manage to catch a wink of rest.

“Let’s go…” Huang Xiaolong snickered as they left for the entrance of the orchard with Lin Kai walking behind them.

Before they arrived, Huang Xiaolong could already hear the joyous conversation going on between Tan Bi and his parents.
