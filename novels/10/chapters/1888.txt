Even though Huang Xiaolong’s strength increased explosively when he arrived at the Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, he still had to exert an immense amount of effort to control the icy creatures. It was extremely taxing on him, and he only managed to control three of them after ten days.

The speed caused Huang Xiaolong to turn speechless.

There were hundreds and hundreds of these icy creatures! There were over three hundred to be exact, and if Huang Xiaolong wanted to control them all, it would take him a thousand days at the very least! That was three years!

He had used around two years to refine the Myriad Curses Devil Stele. If he were to spend another three years to subdue all the icy creatures, the Glaze Devil Stele could already end up being taken by someone else.

All of a sudden, a lightbulb appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind. A type of Heart Devil Curse was contained in the ten thousand curses carved on the Myriad Curses Devil Stele.

The curse could disrupt his opponent’s concentration, and if he used it together with the grandmist worms, his speed of subduing the icy creatures could increase...

As soon as the idea came to his mind, Huang Xiaolong decided to test it out.

Summoning the Myriad Curses Devil Stele, Huang Xiaolong controlled it to float above the icy creature’s heads. The rune for the Heart Devil Curse lit up, and the light landed on the icy creature. After it sank into the creature’s body, Huang Xiaolong condensed several grandmist worms and followed up.

Huang Xiaolong’s test caused his eyes to light up.

Indeed. As soon as he combined the grandmist worms with the Heart Devil Curse, he managed to subdue one of them in less than half a day. Compared to the three days per creature, Huang Xiaolong’s speed increased by a whole lot!

A storm rose in Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

With his strength, he could condense several hundred grandmist worms.

As long as he controlled all three hundred of these icy beasts, he would own another terrifying force.

It was a force stronger than the one hundred Undead Netherguards!

One had to know that Huang Xiaolong needed all fourteen radiance angels and the four odd beasts to hold all three hundred plus icy creatures down. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Out of the three hundred of them, there were thirty-four at the Tenth Order Emperor Realm or higher.

As for the others, they were mostly at the high-level Emperor Realm.

Those that were weaker than a high-level Emperor could probably be counted on two hands.

Huang Xiaolong immediately decided to try it out on a Tenth Order Emperor Realm icy creature.

He planned to control all of the creatures at the Tenth Order Emperor Realm before making a move on those at the high-level Emperor Realm.

Just as Huang Xiaolong decided to control all the icy creatures, a group of people appeared in space billions of miles away from the icy lake. They were precisely Lan Chong, and the experts from his empire. Other than Lan Chong, Shi Ming, Chiyou, Chu Han, and Feng Chu were all present.

After flying for quite some time, Lan Chong paused in mid-air, and a deep frown formed on his face.

“How is it?”

Lan Chong shook his head. “I can’t feel anything.”

Since two years ago, the Blue Soul’s Curse in Huang Xiaolong’s body had become a little weaker. As it turned weaker and weaker, Lan Chong was no longer able to sense it. He could only move towards Huang Xiaolong’s approximate location before the curse disappeared.

“The Cursed Forest is just up ahead,” One of the ancestors of the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire said. “Great Emperor, do you really think Huang Xiaolong is in the Cursed Forest?”

The Cursed Forest!

Everyone sucked in a cold breath in shock.

“The Cursed Forest ... Power of the curse.” Shi Ming sank into thought. “There is only one reason you cannot feel the curse in Huang Xiaolong’s body. He got rid of it!”

Lan Chong shook his head. “That’s impossible. No creature can get rid of the Blue Soul’s Curse. Unless Huang Xiaolong becomes stronger than me, he can’t get rid of it.”

“What if he really got rid of it?” Shi Ming sneered.

Lan Chong was stunned for a second. However, his expression twisted in the next instant. His voice started to shake. “There is one item in the Devil World that has the power to get rid of my curse.”

“What’s that?” Chu Han frowned.

“Myriad Curses Devil Stele!” Lan Chong spat out the name of one of the six great Devil Steles after sucking in a long breath.

“What?!” Everyone’s face changed. Myriad Curses Devil Stele?! Doesn’t that mean...?

“Are you saying that Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain the Myriad Curses Devil Stele?!” Feng Chu’s face twisted, and a hideous expression appeared on it.

The Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor shook his head and denied the possibility. “That’s impossible. Even if Huang Xiaolong manages to obtain the Myriad Curses Devil Stele, he can’t instantly eliminate the Blue Soul’s Curse. The only possibility of getting rid of the curse is if he successfully refined the Myriad Curses Devil Stele. No one can successfully refine it in two short years. Even the Heavenless Archdevil Lord himself won’t be able to do so.”

Shi Ming growled. “Even if no one can do it, Huang Xiaolong might be able to. Hasn’t he proven all of us wrong whenever we have said that he wouldn’t be able to do something?!”

The Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor could only remain silent when Shi Ming stated his point.

Indeed. Huang Xiaolong’s rise had been too quick, and he has created too many miracles along the way. Impossible was nothing when it came to Huang Xiaolong.

Even if it was something the Heavenless Archdevil Lord was unable to do, it didn’t mean that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t do it.

A cold light flashed through Shi Ming’s eyes when he looked at the Cursed Forest before them. “After so many billions of years, no one had managed to locate the source of the curses in the Cursed Forest. As it turned out, it had something to do with the Myriad Curses Devil Stele!”

Lan Chong, Chu Han, and Chiyou looked at each other without speaking.

Even the other ancestors couldn’t help but feel a trace of shock appear in their hearts.

It was too shocking for them to find out that the Myriad Curses Devil Stele was located in the Cursed Forest.

When they were still standing there dumbfounded, Shi Ming soared towards the Cursed Forest. When Lan Chong, Chiyou, Chu Han, and the others realized what was happening, they hastily tried to keep up. They were afraid that they would fall behind. The Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor, Feng Chu, Chen Xie, and the rest were the last ones to react.

Very quickly, all of them appeared on the outskirts of the Cursed Forest.

The four Sovereigns didn’t slow down as they charged straight into the forest. Chu Han, Chen Xie, and the others hesitated for a moment.

They knew about the horrifying power behind the curses in the Cursed Forest. Since the Shi Ming and the three were Sovereigns, they didn’t need to care about the power of curses affecting them. However, Chu Han and others were mere Emperor Realm experts!

A trace of envy appeared on Feng Chu’s face as he stared at the four who had already entered the forest.

Sovereign Realm!

When will I be able to break through to the Sovereign Realm?!

How many hundreds of millions of years have I waited?

Even though they were afraid of the power of curses contained in the Cursed Forest, all of them eventually entered. Despite their ‘fearless’ behavior, they moved cautiously as soon as they entered. They tried their best to avoid everything they could in the forest, like trees and rocks. They even took a roundabout path when they saw a stone sticking out of the ground before them!

A month passed as all of them searched through the Cursed Forest.

Since Lan Chong was unable to feel the Blue Soul’s Curse he had placed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, they could only sweep the forest, inch by inch.

The Cursed Forest was boundless, and even after a month of searching, they barely managed to cover a small half of it.

“There’s an icy lake there!” Chu Han yelled as he pointed towards the icy lake in the distance.

Shi Ming’s gaze turned sharp as he looked at the lake.

In a flash, the four Sovereigns broke through the air as they charged towards it.

It was the same icy lake Huang Xiaolong had entered.

“There’s something weird about this lake. The frigid qi is extremely strong!” Chiyou’s face turned serious. “We can’t see anything below the surface even with our divine sense and heavenly eye!”

“We shall head down and take a look.” Shi Ming eventually made the decision.
