Chapter 2640: Dao Spirit of the Grand Formation

Huang Xiaolong didn’t get mad when he heard how Feitian Cheng mocked him. “Are you planning to kill me? Do you think you have the ability to take my life?”

Feitian Jin roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, you might have a Primal Ancestor Corpse Puppet and a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor to protect you, but we have the Flying Heaven Grand Formation!”

Their figures blurred as they disappeared from where they once stood.

When they reappeared, they were several thousand miles away.

Other than the two of them, there were plenty of Eminent Elders present. All other Eminent Elders of the Flying Heaven Race had showed up, except for the ones Huang Xiaolong had saved in the past.

As the formation opened, brilliant rays of light pierced into the skies as they surrounded Huang Xiaolong from head to toe. The space around him was clamped down by the pillars of light.

The Flying Heaven Grand Formation wasn’t just a random formation the old ancestor had left behind to protect the race. It was something he had worked extremely hard on, and even Huang Xiaolong could feel a horrifying pressure pressing down on him when he stood in the middle of the formation. It was as though the grand dao energy of the world was turned against him.

It was no wonder they were so confident of their plan. After all, it wasn’t every day that they could find a formation that called upon the grand dao.

However, Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless when he felt the crushing pressure. He stared at the Eminent Elders standing outside the formation and said, “It seems like all of you have thought of a plan to kill me with the help of this formation.”

Feitian Renhe chuckled, “It seems like you’re not stupid.”

“Hahahahaha!”

Shaking his head slowly, Huang Xiaolong gave them one final chance, “If you open the formation right now and kneel before me, I will spare your life. The only reason I am willing to do so is because of my friendship with Feitian Longpeng.”

Feitian Zhileng mocked, “You’re really cocky for someone who is about to die! Huang Xiaolong, we should be the ones saying that! If you kneel before us and apologize, we’ll spare your life since you're a Mansion Master Candidate. However, regardless of what you do, we’ll shatter your physical body today!”

“Huang Xiaolong, hand over the blood stele right now! Otherwise, you can’t blame us if we ramp up the torture we were planning to unleash upon you.” Feitian Cheng snorted, “Since you’re planning to hand it over anyway, just give it to me now. The Flying Heaven Hidden Treasury isn’t something you can lay your hands on, much less the grand dao treasures within. In fact, you’re not qualified to even breathe the air in the treasury!”

“If you really want the stele, come get it,” Huang Xiaolong suspended the blood stele before him and taunted.

The eyes of the Eminent Elders lit up when they saw the Flying Heaven Blood Stele.

“There’s no need to waste our time speaking to him! Suppress him with the formation, and we’ll grab the stele!” Feitian Shiyuan roared.

Feitian Cheng and Feitian Jin nodded after looking at each other.

As their figures started to shake, the Eminent Elders appeared in the air above the formation as they surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

With a mysterious hand seal, all of them poured their power into the heart of the formation and the pillars of light that surrounded Huang Xiaolong increased in intensity. Soon after, a horrifying pressure descended on the lands.

As the pressure increased by several tens of times, the weight on Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls increased accordingly.

Grand dao runes slowly appeared in the heart of the formation and they carried with them enough power to destroy the heavens. Every single rune could seriously injure a Ninth Heaven True Saint.

With the assistance of the Eminent Elders of the Flying Heaven Race, Hei Luo’s strength was severely compromised. It was difficult for him to even use half his fighting power.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he managed to feel the might of the formation. However, the only emotion he felt was a mild trace of surprise.

When Feitian Cheng and the others were done, they threw a rune towards Huang Xiaolong while yelling, “Huang Xiaolong, get on your knees right now!”

Even a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor would be hard-pressed to withstand the power of the rune, much less a Third Heaven True Saint like Huang Xiaolong. Or so, they thought.

In the next instant, everyone realized that rays of light were emerging from Huang Xiaolong’s body to dissolve the power of the rune.

“What?!” Feitian Jin and the others yelled in surprise.

“Kneel!” Once again, the aura emitted by Feitian Jin and the others increased. Waving the rune around, they slammed it towards Huang Xiaolong in another attempt to force the man into submission. The strength of the rune increased by more than two times and the aura it emitted doubled.

However, the rays of light emitted by Huang Xiaolong forced the runes to come to a stop several feet away from him. Regardless of how hard they tried, it wouldn’t budge.

“What’s going on?!”

“How can this happen?!”

Feitian Jin and the others stared at the scene before them in shock.

Looking at the Eminent Elders with a placid gaze, Huang Xiaolong tutted, “A bunch of weaklings like you won’t even be able to use a millionth of the formation’s power. I guess I’ll have to disappoint you. You won’t be getting the blood stele, and you won’t be able to force me to my knees.”

Feitian Jin and the others stared at each other in shock.

“Impossible!” Feitian Cheng roared, “We can suppress a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor with the grand formation! It’s impossible for you to be unaffected!”

“Release the dao spirit!”

A sinister smile formed on Feitian Cheng’s face as the rune between his eyebrows started to flash. The formation lit up once again, and he sliced his palm to pour his blood into it.

The others didn’t hesitate as they mirrored his actions. They pushed themselves to their limits as they no longer planned to hold back. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With the assistance of the essence blood from the various Eminent Elders, the formation started to emit cracking noises as more pillars of light emerged.

A horrifying pressure that came from the suppression of the grand dao finally descended on the lands as the blood essence of the Eminent Elders gathered to form a supreme dao spirit!

The dao spirit contained the will of the old ancestor, and it possessed endless vitality!
