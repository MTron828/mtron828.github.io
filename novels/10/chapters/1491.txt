At this time, inside the flying ship’s hall, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were standing behind Chen Hao and looking at the vast space outside. They still couldn’t believe what was happening—the Fortune Emperor Palace had actually sent someone to the Vientiane World surface to pick them up!

More importantly, the person who had come to pick them was a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder!

Not to mention a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder, even if the person picking them up was a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Elder, it would already have been a high status character in Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s eyes.

When the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder arrived at the Vientiane World surface, it sent a wave through the forces of Vientiane World surface.

The Vientiane World surface’s Fortune Gate Sect Chief Zhu Yi was so excited that he was already kneeling in welcome when Chen Hao was still a hundred thousand li away!

Even more unbelievable to Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor was that this Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder had specifically come to the Vientiane World surface to pick them up because of Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong, their disciple, not only had successfully entered the Fortune Emperor Palace as a disciple, but he had also become a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder’s junior brother!

A Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder’s junior brother! Doesn’t that mean that Huang Xiaolong’s Master was a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Hall Master?!

That’s right, it must be a Hall Master!

Even though this Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder had not clearly stated which Hall Master had accepted Huang Xiaolong as his personal disciple, they were certain that this Hall Master was among the stronger and more prominent ones!

This was the guess made by Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

Along with Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor, Yao Chi and Li Lu also came to similar conclusions.

“Senior Chen, did Xiaolong get a very good result during the enrollment assessment?” Yao Chi who asked respectfully as she stood behind Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor.

Chen Hao chuckled meaningfully, “His result was very good indeed, why else would he attract my Master’s eyes and accepted Huang Xiaolong as his personal disciple? Xiaolong is my junior brother, and all of you here are close to him, so there is no need no need to be so reserved in front of me. Just call me Big brother Chen, it is fine.”

Although Huang Xiaolong had ‘forgotten’ to clarify his relationship with these two young women, how could Chen Hao not understand that these two young women were his junior brother’s sweethearts? Thus, despite his position as a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder, he did not act superior in front of them.

Yao Chi was flattered by Chen Hao’s words and was a little flustered. So was Li Lu.

“Senior Chen Hao, may I know which Hall Master is Xiaolong’s Master?” Li Lu pondered for a moment then decided to ask.

Even though Chen Hao had told them to address him as Big brother Chen Hao, Li Lu wouldn’t dare to call him so.

Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor too looked at Chen Hao with anticipation, all three of them were really curious as to which Hall Master it was.

“Which Hall Master?” Chen Hao blanked for a second. He didn’t recall saying that his Master was a Hall Master, did he?

Chen Hao smiled and answered them, “You’ll know when we arrived at the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the other two old men dared not pursue the matter.

Like Chen Hao had said, they would know when they reached the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Still, the four of them couldn’t help guessing which Hall Master it could be as they journeyed onwards.

A month passed by in the blink of an eye.

Their journey was smooth the whole way.

By the time the flying ship docked, Li Lu and Yao Chi were amazed as they stepped out from the ship and saw the numerous palaces and world surfaces that formed a grand formation.

Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor were amazed as well. Though both of them were Ancestors of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s branch, this was their first time visiting the headquarters.

As Chen Hao led the four of them, they flew towards the Fortune Emperor Palace’s main grounds, and the sights passed them in a blur.

“Right ahead is the Supreme Harmony Hall.” Chen Hao pointed at an enormous building and added, “The Supreme Harmony Hall is where all new disciples register their enrollment and take their assessment. Junior Brother Huang Xiaolong also registered in this Supreme Harmony Hall.”

“The Supreme Harmony Hall is also where the Fortune Emperor Palace’s disciples take and submit their tasks. I am one of the Supreme Harmony Hall’s Grand Elders.” Chen Hao supplemented.

Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor nodded attentively as they listened to Chen Hao’s introduction. When they heard that Chen Hao was one of the Supreme Harmony Hall’s Grand Elders, it immediately triggered the four people, ‘Could it be that Xiaolong and Senior Chen Hao’s Master was the Supreme Harmony Hall’s Hall Master?’

As Chen Hao’s group flew onwards, another group of people appeared at the horizon, flying in their direction.

The person leading this other group was the Snow Moon Hall’s Hall Master Yan Ying. Behind her was an entourage of Snow Moon Hall’s disciples, Elders, and Grand Elders.

Chen Hao frowned slightly, but when Yan Ying’s group got closer, he still cupped his fists in greeting, "Hall Master Yan Ying."

Upon hearing that the person opposite them was a Hall Master, Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor were greatly surprised, so they quickly emulated Chen Hao and greeted her in the same manner.

Yan Ying tilted her chin slightly, peering down condescendingly at Chen Hao as she smiled faintly, “Oh, it’s Grand Elder Chen Hao.” Her gaze moved onto Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor, and her face sank immediately. “Grand Elder Chen Hao, as a Fortune Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder, don’t you know the rules? How dare you bring outsiders into the Fortune Emperor Palace’s main grounds!”

Chen Hao remained calm as if he hadn’t seen Yan Ying’s outburst. “They are Junior Brother Xiaolong’s Masters and brethrens from the Vientiane branch. Junior Brother Xiaolong had invited them, and it has been specially approved by my Master and the Sect Chief.”

Yan Ying’s face froze for a second before she quickly covered it with an enthusiastic smile. “So, they are Junior Brother Xiaolong’s Masters and brethrens from the Vientiane branch ah, since the Chief of Hall Masters and Sect Chief had given their approval, everything is fine. I was just asking casually.” With that said, she and the rest of the Snow Moon Hall’s group sped away.

Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor stood dumbly on the spot.

What did this Hall Master Yan Ying say? Chief of Hall Masters—?!

Does that mean Xiaolong’s Master was not some Hall Master, but...!

Seeing the expressions on their faces, Chen Hao let out a low chortle, then confirmed, “That’s right, our Master is the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Chief of Hall Masters.”

Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Li Lu as well as Yao Chi looked even more dumbfounded.

Chen Hao shook his head inwardly at these four people’s expressions. They were already shocked to this point just by hearing that? There were still many things he had not mentioned to them. For one, Huang Xiaolong had shown his King of supreme godhead during the competition rankings. If he would have done so earlier their Sect Chief and several Ancestors would have raged war among themselves to take Huang Xiaolong as their personal disciple. Due to this, his Master Zhao Lei wouldn’t have been able to become Huang Xiaolong’s Master.

Several hours later, Huang Xiaolong saw Li Lu, Yao Chi, Golden Brow Ancestor, and Blood Knife Ancestor. Though they had not parted for a long time, after seeing the two women again, Huang Xiaolong felt like it had been long since he had last seen them. Yao Chi was especially chirpy and chattery when she saw Huang Xiaolong, asking various questions, from his assessment, to rankings competition, his apprenticeship with his Master, etcetera, etcetera.

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, as this was the first time he had realized that Yao Chi actually liked gossiping.

There were a lot of rooms where Xiaoniu, Xiang Xun, and the rest were staying, hence Huang Xiaolong did not request Chen Hao to arrange separate accommodations for Golden Brow Ancestor and the others.

Their safe arrival had completely eased Huang Xiaolong’s worries.

Huang Xiaolong accompanied Li Lu, Yao Chi, and the others for several months. He also gave all of them ten thousand Fortune Divine Fruits each before entering a long period of seclusion for cultivation, aiming to break through to God King Realm.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had planned to make a trip to the Floating Twilight Land after Sun Shihai and Peng Xiao’s apprenticeship ceremony, but now that his supreme godhead was exposed, he felt that it would be better to make that trip after breaking through to God King Realm.

He would be able to resolve some of the petrification seals within Xiang Xun after he broke through to God King Realm, helping Xiang Xun recover his strength. This would make his trip to Floating Twilight Land much safer.

Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars sat cross-legged inside his room, continuously refining the Fortune Divine Fruits’ fortune energy.

Time flowed and the seasons changed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

One year after another went by, and in the blink of an eye, more than a decade had already passed.

“Xiaolong has been in seclusion for more than a decade now, I wonder how is he progressing?” Inside a big hall, Yao Chi muttered to herself, looking bored with her palms supporting her chin.
