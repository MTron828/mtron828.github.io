Chapter 2706: Here to Cause Trouble?!

Elder Ming shook his head hastily when he saw Yin Ming staring at him. “It wasn’t me! I didn’t do anything!”

Duan Feng harrumphed when he heard Elder Ming’s response, “Maybe there’s someone trying to set us up! They’re probably trying to make our grudge stronger and take advantage of us when we fight against each other!”

“Humph. Useless antics. Whatever the case, find the person who tried to frame us! Heh heh…” Yin Ming sneered.

…

In one of the manors not too far from the headquarters of the Yin Borer Race, Huang Xiaolong and the others settled in.

It was one of the properties under the Dragon Fish Race as superpowers like them would usually possess multiple properties and businesses in the various domains.

“Is there news on Fei Yanzi?” Huang Xiaolong asked Long Jianfei in his courtyard.

He was unwilling to believe that Fei Yanzi would marry the Yin Borer King of her own free will. All this while, Huang Xiaolong had been using everything in Long Jianfei’s power to search for the reason behind the marriage ceremony.

“Young Lord, we could only discover that Fei Yanzi exchanged blows with someone when she passed through the Yin Borer Domain. We have no idea who she fought with or what their goal was,” Long Jianfei replied respectfully. “From what we know, the person she fought with was from the Yin Borer Race, and he managed to capture her after the fight!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. Even if she was captured by the other party, there is no way she would agree to marry him!

“We also discovered that when the ancestors of the Ghost Tuo Race and the Prison Gateway arrived, they were invited over to the Yin Borer King’s cultivation cave.” Long Jianfei continued, “It seems like they are in some sort of secret alliance.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned. If they really formed some sort of alliance, things might get a little troublesome.

“The youngster we taught a lesson to in the Ancient Void City is called You Wubi. He’s the personal disciple of the guardian of the Ghost Tuo Race. He’s been looking into Young Lord’s identity all this while, and it seems like he’s planning to take revenge.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “So someone like him managed to become a disciple of a guardian in the Ghost Tuo Race… Wouldn’t that mean that we’ll run into him tomorrow?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Since You Wubi was unwilling to accept the loss, he would definitely try to stir up some trouble.

Long Jianfei laughed in response. “After all his digging around, he should be able to discover Young Lord’s identity. Let’s see if he dares to mess around tomorrow.”

“We can’t be sure of that. His master should be present tomorrow, and with the ancestor of the Ghost Tuo Race present, he’ll be more than willing to mess with us. After all, he has a strong backing,” Huang Xiaolong explained.

After summoning Mo Zhi, Long Shengtian, Zi Dongping, and the others, Huang Xiaolong briefed them on what might happen during the ceremony the next day.

Even though he was extremely confident in his abilities, it was better to ensure a route of escape in case anything went horribly wrong.

“Young Lord, are you planning to deal with Elder Ming, the Yin Borer King, and the ancestors of the Ghost Tuo Race and the Prison Gateway alone?” Long Jianfei couldn’t help but worry when he heard the plan.

Mo Zhi and the others were equally stunned.

If the Yin Borer King hadn’t entered the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm, Huang Xiaolong might have been able to challenge them all at once. However, now that Yin Ming had broken through, no one knew if Huang Xiaolong could even fight him head-on, not to mention three other super experts!

“Relax. I know what I’m doing.” Huang Xiaolong shook his arm to dismiss their worries. “I’ll deal with the four of them. However, you guys will have to deal with the others.”

…

The night passed quietly, and the first rays of dawn broke through the gloomy night.

Even before the sun was fully visible, the Yin Borer City was bustling with excitement. Streets were full as celebrations were carried out everywhere. Experts from all over the world could be seen.

Most of them poured out into the streets as they headed straight for the Yin Borer Race’s headquarters.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others emerged, they noticed that the streets were clogged with people, and they were like a long line of ants crawling towards a mother-nest.

Of course, the moment Huang Xiaolong’s group appeared, no one dared to block their path.

“There are so many people here… I bet all the experts of the Alien Lands and the World River showed up,” Long Shengtian muttered.

“Why do I feel like we’re planning to go against the world here,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly to lighten up the mood.

Laughter filled the air, and it didn’t seem as though they were marching towards a massive battle.

“Let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong spoke casually as he led the way towards the Yin Borer Race’s headquarters.

When they came across people who recognized Long Jianfei, Jiang Heng, or the others, a wide berth would form on the streets as those experts would retreat with a reverent expression.

Those who didn’t recognize them would also back away when they noticed the various big shots making way.

“Master, who is that youngster from the Human Race?” One of the disciples asked when he saw his master backing away.

“How would I know?!” his master snapped at him. However, he could only follow the actions of those big shots from the superpowers he recognized.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s reputation had spread through the Alien Lands and World River, those who had seen him before could be counted on two hands. It was the same for Long Jianfei and Mo Zhi. Of course, even though they were recognized by very few people on the streets, the fear in the eyes of everyone present was evident.

That was because even Ninth Heaven True Saints could feel the suppression and aura coming from the group of Primal Ancestors following Huang Xiaolong around.

Just like that, Huang Xiaolong and the others managed to arrive at the headquarters of the Yin Borer Race without any obstructions.

This time, no one came to welcome him.

After entering the headquarters, they were stopped by a disciple responsible for guarding the area.

“Please produce your invitations.”

Huang XIaolong and the others were stunned.

When they had received the invitation, Huang Xiaolong had turned it into ashes when he had seen the part about the wedding ceremony. How was he supposed to show the disciple his invitation?

Turning to the disciple, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “I don’t have one.”

The expression on the disciple’s face sank instantly when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “If you don’t have it, stand outside! Only those invited by the upper echelons can enter the headquarters!”

“What if I’m adamant about going in?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The disciples who were in charge of security stared at Huang Xiaolong with a blank expression. It seemed as though the human before them was here to cause trouble! Never in their wildest imaginations would they have thought that someone would dare to cause trouble at the entrance of the Yin Borer Race’s headquarters.

“Brat, are you here to mess with us?” another guard growled at Huang Xiaolong.”You better start running right now. Don’t you know what place this is?! Is this a place a human like you can enter as you wish?”
