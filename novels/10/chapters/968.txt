Attacking Huang Xiaolong’s group of four was one of the many aquatic ghost beasts in the Sea of Hell!

These aquatic ghost creatures absorbed the Path to Hell’s ghost qi and the Sea of Hell’s spiritual energy to cultivate, resulting in their great power.

Also worth mentioning was the fact that their healing speed was shocking inside the Sea of Hell, and thus, they were extremely difficult to kill.

However, this giant ghost beast resembling an octopus only had the strength of a mid-Seventh Order Highgod Realm cultivator. Huang Xiaolong didn’t even need to move, that giant octopus was knocked out from the water by the Spiriting Demon Gates Patriarch with a single palm strike.

Bluish-black beast blood bloomed in the sea water below.

The four continued forward.

As they reached the deeper region, the stronger the ghost beasts they came across that it reached a point even the peak late-Ninth Order Highgod Realm Spiriting Demon Gates Patriarch was having trouble dealing with these ghost beasts.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong casually pointed in the air, shooting a strand of energy through the head of a peak late-Ninth Order Highgod Realm ghost beast, then took a look at the darkening sky. Deciding to rest for the night, he led the other three people to an island made of sand not far from where they were.

Nighttime was when these ghost beasts were most active; considering Li Lu and the others’ safety, Huang Xiaolong decided to rest at night and travel only during the day.

A few minutes later, the four people landed.

The desert island was roughly a thousand li from one end to the other, with several small peaks. Only dead branches and crumbled ruins could be seen all around, a forsaken island covered with the air of death.

Huang Xiaolong spread his divine sense over the entire island, then lead the others downward. Everyone simply sat cross-legged on the ground. Huang Xiaolong raised his palm and several dried branches close by flew towards him, arranging neatly on the ground. With a tap of his finger, fire element godforce lighted the pile of branches.

Warm light immediately reduced the darkness around.

Despite knowing that the light would draw the nearby ghost beasts, Huang Xiaolong had confidence in his strength and did not put this matter to heart.

Li Lu sat next to him while the Ascending Moon Old Man and the Spiriting Demon Gates Patriarch sat opposite them.

Huang Xiaolong took out ten jugs of Celestial Blossom Wine from his spatial ring.

“Celestial Blossom Wine!” The Ascending Moon Old Man’s small eyes lit up the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong taking out the ten jugs of wine. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at all that the old man could utter the name of the wine in an instant. He threw a jug toward him without a word.

He old man couldn’t wait a second longer, immediately ripping off the cover, which caused the tantalizing aroma to be released. The old man threw his head back, greedily taking several large gulps of wine. Smacking his lips noisily, he cried: “Good wine, good wine ah!”

The rest laughed watching him.

Staring at Li Lu’s captivating smile, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Do you want to taste?”

Li Lu shook her head, “Forget it.”

“Pity ah, there’s only good wine but no meat!” The Ascending Moon Old Man whined, wiping off the corners of his mouth with the back of his hand.

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “There will be some soon.”

His voice had just fallen when a strange roar came from a ghost beast that swooped down on the desert island where Huang Xiaolong’s group was. This beast was actually an early Tenth Order Highgod Realm Water Ape over twenty zhang tall! When it landed, the entire island quaked.

Before the Water Ape could do anything else, Huang Xiaolong sent out a soul force sword, destroying the Water Ape’s soul in the blink of an eye. A sword appeared in his hand afterwards, easily slicing the Water Ape into several thousand pieces that fell neatly in front of them, piled high up.

Only now did the Ascending Moon Old Man understand what Huang Xiaolong meant earlier.

“Little Huang brat, are you sure this Water Ape’s meat is edible? I heard the ghost beasts’ flesh is extremely poisonous.” The old man asked doubtfully.

Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, “ Eat with ease, there’s nothing to worry about.”

After his fire element godforce roasted this meat, whatever poison there was inside would be burned away.

Huang Xiaolong skewered several pieces of Water Ape belly meat and put it over the fire. Very soon, a mouth-watering aroma permeated the air.

“Delicious!” The Ascending Moon Old Man exclaimed happily after cautiously taking a bite of the meat, the rest was practically wolfed down by him.

Huang Xiaolong smiled meaningfully, he had great confidence in his roasting skills. He then removed a piece of meat from the skewer and gave it to Li Lu.

Li Lu snuck a peek at the Ascending Moon Old Man who was literally breathing down pieces of meat, then looked at the shiny and fragrant piece of meat that Huang Xiaolong offered her. She quietly accepted and took a bite. Instantly, her beautiful eyes were sparkling, her dainty mouth couldn’t stop.

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong let out a small chuckle.

Naturally, even while eating, Li Lu was beautiful. Especially the way her dainty cherry red lips opened and closed, giving birth to a desire to walk up and take a bite.

After quite a number of roast meat pieces, the old man lightly slapped his bulging belly with a look of immense satisfaction. “Little Huang brat, where did you learn to roast meat?”

Where did he learn?

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help reminiscing about the Earth in his past life. To him, memories of his past life on Earth were like a dust-covered glass.

Sometimes, he wondered if he would have a chance to return to Earth. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Logically speaking, although that universe wasn’t the one he was living in now, he believed there was a possibility if he wanted to return. Of course, that was in the future. It was an impossible feat with his current level of strength, not even a Heavenly God had such ability.

Watching Huang Xiaolong fall into silence, looking melancholic, the old man did not pursue the question further, changing the subject instead, “Didn’t everyone say that in the Path to Hell’s depths, there are three-million-years-old and four-million-years-old herb medicinal herbs? There are even some herbs that have reached ten-million-years-old, but look at us, we didn’t even see a wild weed around.”

Huang Xiaolong laughed listening to his words, “Even if there are, after so many years, they’d have been picked by the Ghost Refining Sect and other sects in the Path to Hell. However, there should be a lot of medicinal herbs in the deep end of the Sea of Hell.”

“Forget it then.” The old man shook his head.

The frigid cold qi at the bottom of the Sea of Hell was overwhelming to say the least, even a peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm master would think twice before venturing down.

The next morning.

The sky was still grayish dark when Huang Xiaolong’s group departed from the desert island.

The Yin Yang Godly Water Li Lu was searching for could be found on another island called Yin Yang Ghost Valley. Based on their group’s speed, they could reach the island in four to five days.

Five days later, they could see the Yin Yang Ghost Valley island from afar.

As the four of them got closer to the island, a burst of terrifying energy fluctuations came from up ahead. Devil qi soared high in the sky. Apart from the presence of devil qi, there was also Buddhism energy, bringing light to a hundred thousand li of the sea.

Obviously, there were masters battling ahead, and their strength was higher than the Ghost Refining Sect Master’s.

“Hehe, Bodhisattva Faction Lord, it looks like your Earth Store Bodhisattva Art’s reputation precedes the actual thing! Today this ten-million-year-old Yin Yang Divine Flower is going back with me, Mo Yishi!” At this time, a proud, conceited voice reached Huang Xiaolong’s group.

The four of them were astonished, the people battling up ahead were there ancient devil clan’s Ancestor Mo Yishi, and the Bodhisattva Faction Lord!
