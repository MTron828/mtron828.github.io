Looking at the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin in the massive cage surrounded by restrictions, Asura King Jin Yuan said in a cold voice, “The Dark Roc Family sure are sinister... They didn’t bother explaining the uses of the restrictions and the way to open the cage.”

In response, Huang Xiaolong chuckled and dismissed him, “Don’t worry about it.” Even though other people might find it impossibly difficult to break the cage, it was nothing to Huang Xiaolong.

With a Supreme Grandmist Artifact like the Eternal City, he would be able to open the cage anytime he wanted. It was just a matter of how hard he smashed the Eternal City against the cage.

The most important thing he had to do was to subdue the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

After stationing all four of them around the cage, Huang Xiaolong started his operation.

The four of them released their aura simultaneously, and a horrifying pressure surged towards the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin trapped in the cage.

Even though it was in the mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin possessed a royal bloodline. It was extremely aggressive and one could barely begin to imagine its might. However, under the suppression of the four Great Commanders, it slumped to the floor of the cage and remained completely motionless.

Huang Xiaolong took a seat before it and started to circulate the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Streams of grandmist qi congealed in the air to form grandmist worms, and they flew straight into the cage.

The restrictions emitted a brilliant glow all of a sudden and formed a huge barrier of light. They tried to stop the advancement of the grandmist worms, but to everyone’s surprise, the harmless looking grandmist worms merely shook their body before piercing through the light barrier.

“This!”

They looked at each other in shock.

Could it be...

A single thought flashed through their minds at the same time.

“ROAR!” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin who was lying on the floor emitted a desperate roar and the four of them snapped back to attention at once. When they turned to look at the grandmist divine beast again, they realized that the grandmist worms had already entered its body. It seemed as though it could feel the terrifying might of them worms as it struggled with all its strength.

At that moment, the four of them increased the pressure they were exerting on the beast in tandem with Huang Xiaolong. They sent their divine sense out at the same time to completely suppress the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s divine sense.

In a flash, one entire month passed.

In the Massacring Gods Gate branch, Song Litao looked at Lu Tianyuan and asked, “Did that kid stay in the Heaven Dome Manor for one entire month?”

“Yes... Even his four subordinates didn’t leave the Heaven Dome Manor. In my opinion, they are trying to subdue the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin as we speak.”

Song Litao snickered in a cold voice, “Does he really think that he will be able to subdue the grandmist divine beast before the birth of the Holy Mountain? If it was that easy, the Dark Roc Family wouldn’t have brought it out for auction.”

Lu Tianyuan laughed as well. “That’s right. The Dark Roc Family should have been keeping the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin for several hundred thousands of years now. Even the Dark Roc Family wasn’t able to subdue the beast... If that kid really has some sort of secret technique to tame the grandmist divine beast, he still wouldn’t be able to do it without several tens of thousands of years.”

As they were conversing with each other, one of the guards rushed towards them to deliver an urgent report. “Young master, Young Master Shi Yinyu of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe requests an audience!”

“Shi Yinyu?!” Song Litao and Lu Tianyuan exclaimed in shock.

Why was Shi Yinyu here?!

Even though the Massacring Gods Gate and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe weren’t exactly enemies, their relationship wasn’t too great.

“Let’s go and meet Shi Yinyu...” Song Litao hesitated for a moment before standing up.

Even though they weren’t exactly friendly with each other, he felt that he should still meet with Shi Yinyu since he had paid a personal visit.

After all, they were both people of status and neither of them could say that the other was beneath them.

“What? Your Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe wants to form an alliance with us?!” Song Litao almost fell over in shock when he realized Shi Yinyu’s purpose.

“Yes.” Shi Yinyu didn’t find his reaction over the top. It seemed as though he had already expected to surprise Song Litao.

“Why?” A trace of suspicion flashed through Song Litao’s eyes as he looked at Shi Yinyu.

“It’s because of that Asura noble.” Shi Yinyu casually picked up his teacup and sipped on his tea.

Song Litao looked at Lu Tianyuan and thoughts flew through their heads.

“Our Massacring Gods Gate is already forming an alliance with the Howling Moon Wolf Race. The two of us are enough to get rid of him.” Song Litao declared in a cold voice. “Do you think that you can just butt into our matters and grab a share of our loot? You’re pretty good at scheming...”

Shi Yinyu didn’t rage after hearing Song Litao’s accusation. Instead, he laughed and mocked, “do you really think that you can kill that brat with just the strength of your Massacring Gods Gate and the Howling Moon Wolf Race? Are you one hundred percent sure?”

Song Litao couldn’t help but hesitate.

Indeed, as long as the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe joined the alliance, there was no doubt they would be able to kill the Asura noble.

With the alliance of three mega superpowers like the Massacring Gods Gate, Howling Moon Wolf Race, and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, there was only one ending for anyone they set their sights on. Death!

“Alright. We can form an alliance. However, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin has to belong to me!” Song Litao weighed the pros and cons in his mind before throwing down his bottom line.

Shi Yinyu had already expected that outcome before he came, and he agreed. “Sure. However, all of his spirit stones and spiritual pills have to belong to me. I also get to pick one of his divine artifacts.”

Song Litao sneered, “You’re really trying to take advantage of the situation right now, aren’t you?”

Just as they were discussing how they wanted to deal with Huang Xiaolong and split the loot, the situation in the Heaven Dome Manor changed. Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief as he looked at the obedient Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin lying on the ground. He felt a burst of excitement in his heart.

He didn’t waste his efforts and in that month, he managed to subdue the grandmist divine beast! He even completed it way ahead of schedule. Huang Xiaolong felt that it would be great as long as he could subdue the beast before the birth of the Holy Mountain.

Now, there were two months before the birth of the Holy Mountain, but he was already done. He could refine the Unfettered Devil Exterminating Pills to increase his strength in the meantime to increase his strength!

Before doing anything else, Huang Xiaolong took out the Eternal City and slammed it against the cage. Following a loud explosion, the cage shattered.

Noticing the cage that had trapped it for hundreds of thousands of years shattering into pieces, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin raised its head towards the sky and released a heaven shaking roar. A feeling of freedom and happiness burst out from the bottom of its heart. In the next moment, it walked towards Huang Xiaolong. Due to the fire burning at the bottom of its feet, it left faint flames and scorched marks wherever it walked.

The scarlet flame it left behind wasn’t ordinary divine flame. It was the Dark Qilin’s origin flame. It was many times stronger than Xiang Xun’s Hellfire...

“Master!” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin kneeled respectfully before Huang Xiaolong and declared.

“Nice!” Huang Xiaolong laughed and climbed onto its back. Squeezing his legs together, he said, “Let’s go!”

In an instant, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin soared into the sky with Huang Xiaolong mounted on its back.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s figure riding on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, Tai Yue and the others couldn’t help but laugh.
