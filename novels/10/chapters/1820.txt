Feng Chan paled upon hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words. He staggered backward unsteadily; even so, he glared fiercely at Huang Xiaolong and yelled, “How dare you! I’m the Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple. If you kill me, the Fiend God Emperor Palace and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe will never spare you!”

He was used to getting everything he wanted. Whenever the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Order appeared, the world trembled with fear, and other Emperor Palaces’ Ancestors retreated a wide berth away. It had never occurred to Feng Chan the Fiend God Emperor Palace could be in a pinch like today, forced to a corner, feeling powerless!

Huang Xiaolong laughed at Feng Chan’s words. His gaze on Feng Chan was indifferent. “The Fiend God Emperor Palace will not spare me? It seems I have forgotten to tell you something—after today, the Divine World will no longer have a Fiend God Emperor Palace!”

After today, the Divine World will not have a Fiend God Emperor Palace!

Huang Xiaolong’s tone was light and carefree as if he was talking about the sunny weather.

However, those words dumbfounded Feng Chan, Liu Yuan, and the rest.

In truth, they had not thought of this situation before. Or more accurately, this possibility had never even occurred to them until this moment.

After all, how long had the Fiend God Emperor Palace existed? Probably, Liu Yuan himself couldn’t precisely say how many billions of years, but definitely no less than ten billion years.

In the last ten billion years, regardless of the storms that had hit the Divine World, or no matter how heaven and earth had changed, the Fiend God Emperor Palace had remained staunch! Furthermore, they had grown stronger!

They had lost count of the number of hidden sects, ancient families, and Emperor Palaces within the top one hundred that the Fiend God Emperor Palace had wiped out.

It had never occurred to them that one day the Fiend God Emperor Palace would face the same fate as the hidden sects, ancient families, and Emperor Palaces they had wiped out in the past; that they too would get erased from the Divine World! Not to mention that this day would come so suddenly and so fast!

According to their initial plan, the Fiend God Emperor Palace would join hands with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe to conquer the Divine World, splitting the harvest equally and becoming a true hegemon. The Fiend God Emperor Palace was headed to their most glorious days. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But now...!

“Wang Hailong, leave with the Young Lord now!” Liu Yuan suddenly barked an order, while he had already turned around and pounced on Huang Xiaolong, attacking with desperation.

Liu Yuan’s godforce was surging madly, and his blood qi spiraled into a hurricane around him.

Zhao Wendan also shouted, “Leave with the Young Lord now!” Like Liu Yuan, he used a taboo technique, sacrificing his vitality to raise his strength as he lunged towards Huang Xiaolong.

Wang Hailong and several other Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors, who were tasked with escorting Feng Chan away, stopped hesitating instantly. Wang Hailong struck his palms on Feng Chan and summoned out a giant drawing.

The instant this giant drawing appeared, it unfolded into a piece of independent heaven and earth, yet it felt like a space-tunnel to another space.

“Fiend God Drawing!” A bright glint flitted across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Fiend God Diagram was one of the supreme treasures of Fiend God Emperor Palace. Though it wasn’t in the same grade as a grandmist artifact treasure, it was a top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact. Moreover, it was a spatial-type artifact!

A spatial-type grandmist spiritual artifact was extremely rare. It was just as precious as a soul-defensive-type grandmist spiritual artifact like Huang Xiaolong’s Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell. Even rarer was a top-grade spatial-type of grandmist spiritual artifact like this Fiend God Drawing.

In the entire Divine World, the number of such artifacts was certainly less than the fingers on one hand.

Once Feng Chan and the others stepped into the Fiend God Drawing, then the Fiend God Drawing would bring Feng Chan and the rest to another space in a split second.

At that time, it would be impossible for Huang Xiaolong to find another chance to kill Feng Chan.

When Feng Chen, Wang Hailong, and the others flew up to enter the Fiend God Drawing, streaks of lightning sizzled from Huang Xiaolong’s forehead as the strongest of the four chaos lightning pool, the Black Tortoise Chaos Lightning Pool flew out and turned into a boundless black sea of lightning.

Powerful lightning streaked across the air, spreading horrifying destructive lightning power that blocked Feng Chan and the others’ path.

Feng Chan saw they were about to enter the Fiend God Drawing when a black lightning sea suddenly appeared in front of them, separating them and the Fiend God Drawing on opposite shores. Feng Chan was shocked and enraged at the same time, “Get the f*ck out of my way!” The Fiend God Sword appeared in his hand, slashing madly at the sea of lightning.

Wang Hailong and the other Ancestors also attacked the lightning sea with full force.

But since the Black Tortoise Lightning Pool was ranked second amongst the Nine Chaos Lightning Pools, could it be broken through so easily?

Huang Xiaolong manipulated the Chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool’s core formation. Chaos lightning power roared, submerging Feng Chan, Wang Hailong, and the others in the blink of an eye.

Wang Hailong and other Ancestors’ fist force screamed across the air, desperately trying to scatter away the Chaos Black Tortoise Lightning Pool. Still, their actions stopped abruptly as the City of Eternity smashed down right at this moment.

Wang Hailong and the others raised their heads as they sensed the sky darkening. In the next second, a resounding boom shook the earth as they lost consciousness.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong arrived in front of Feng Chan with his fist swinging out and smashing Feng Chan into the ground. The surrounding palace buildings crumbled, burying Feng Chan underneath.

“Young Lord!”

Liu Yuan, Zhao Wendan, and the others were puffing with fury, but they were powerless against those fourteen-winged Radiance Angels. They were incapable of saving Feng Chan, and they could only watch helplessly as Huang Xiaolong pulled him up from the ground.

Huang Xiaolong looked indifferently at Feng Chan as he hung loosely in the air. His punch had crushed Feng Chan’s entire body’s meridians. Adding his previous injuries, Feng Chan was completely powerless to fight back.

The divine armor on Feng Chan had been broken to the point of being nonexistent, and his hair was disheveled and smeared in soil and his own blood.

“Huang, Huang Xiaolong, e-even if, if I...” Feng Chan’s eyes were filled with infinite hatred as he struggled to speak.

Before Feng Chan could even finish his sentence, Huang Xiaolong had already circulated the Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power. Feng Chan’s entire body’s blood qi, godforce, and archdevil bloodline’s power rushed out, flowing vigorously into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Feng Chan stared at Huang Xiaolong with terror-widened eyes filled with despair as he struggled fiercely to break free from Huang Xiaolong’s restraint. However, he discovered that his body was out of his control, and he couldn’t move even an inch.

In the distance, Liu Yuan, Zhao Wendan, and the others were even more anxious and nervous. Except for screaming and shouting angrily, there was little they could do. Even as they desperately rushed over to rescue Feng Chan, they were no match against the fourteen-winged Radiance Angels. In the end, they could only watch Huang Xiaolong devour Feng Chan’s blood qi, godforce, and archdevil bloodline. Feng Chan’s body mass shrunk rapidly.

It didn’t take long for Feng Chan’s body to turn into a dried corpse, and with a blow of the wind, Feng Chan scattered off like dust.

Feng Chan had the Fiend Spirit Physique, born with innate nefarious qi. As Huang Xiaolong continued to devour, this nefarious qi also entered Huang Xiaolong’s body. However, as Huang Xiaolong’s Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead spun, the streams of this nefarious qi were immediately purified.

After he finished dealing with Feng Chan, Huang Xiaolong inwardly heaved in relief. This trip to the Fiend God Emperor Palace was not in vain, as devouring Feng Chan’s archdevil bloodline was better than getting the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s treasury.

Huang Xiaolong turned around, looking at Liu Yuan and the rest.
