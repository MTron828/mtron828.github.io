Chapter 2096: Send Zhao Yuan Flying

As time slowly passed, Huang Xiaolong’s party of four killed an uncountable number of disciples.

Ten billion miles away, nearly all the mountain peaks were blasted to dust as craters could be seen everywhere on the ground. Every single crater was so deep that the bottom was not visible.

As the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus neared the end of its transformation, resplendent rays of green light filled the skies. Medicinal fragrance entered the noses of everyone around the mountain range, and the disciples charged towards the barrier with a newfound fervor.

After receiving their respective leaders’ orders, the disciples’ eyes turned bloodshot as they no longer cared about their lives. It was as though life had lost all meaning for them.

The killing intent in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes increased once again when he realized how foolish the old ancestors were by making their disciples throw their lives away. The Nine Yin Magic Mirror appeared, and the Heart of Hell started to tremble. Rays of black light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

Thump!

Under the Heart of Hell’s influence, everyone around the mountain range became absent-minded for a second. With that momentary pause, countless rays of black light shot into their bodies.

The disciples who were rushing towards the barrier maniacally paused as the light in their eyes dimmed.

Huge groups of disciples fell one after the other.

The Nine Yin Magic Light shot across the battlefield, and even old ancestors at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm weren’t able to escape from their miserable fate of death.

“Nine Yin Magic Mirror!”

The faces of Zhao Yuan and the other hidden experts changed.

In the past, Shi Ming had used the Nine Yin Magic Mirror to sweep unhindered through the lands. He had exterminated countless divine planes and earned quite the reputation for the Nine Yin Magic Mirror. If they were to compare the Nine Yin Magic Mirror to the Ancient Heavenly Court, it would be a close second.

The disciples who fell to the ground were different from those who were smashed into meat paste. Even though they looked fine, their souls had already been devoured by the Nine Yin Magic Mirror.

A hundred thousand, a million, ten million!

After swallowing the souls of countless disciples, the radiance emitted by the mirror grew all the more resplendent. Sounds of rumbling started to emerge from the Nine Yin Magic Mirror as though it was expressing a feeling of contentment.

With the Nine Yin Magic Mirror in one hand and the Radiance Divine Scepter in the other, Huang Xiaolong continued his massacre. As he controlled the City of Eternity with his mind, the number of disciples who fell increased by the second.

The little cow didn’t lack too far behind either. Endless purple lighting swam around the battlefield, and none managed to escape.

It was exactly like she had said previously. She wasn’t afraid of them launching an attack! She would just kill them until the others retreated in fear!

Under her constant bombardment, the number of disciples who died at her hands slowly rose to several dozen billion!

“Kill!”

Roars filled the air, and even the other experts who were hiding ten billion miles away felt their hearts shaking.

“If this keeps up, the Saint Devil City will probably turn into a wasteland!” One of the old ancestors yelled in shock.

“The strength of a Sovereign can exterminate the heavens! If not for the Heavenless Archdevil Lord using his powers to strengthen the Devil Holy Ground, this battle would have already destroyed the entire area!” One of the faction leaders said as he stared at Huang Xiaolong’s party of four with a terrified gaze.

“Isn’t it just a single origin treasure?!”

It was too bad greed was uncontrollable.

Other than the ten billion mile radius around Huang Xiaolong, the Twin Devil Mountain Range was basically reduced to ruins.

Regardless of whether or not the Heavenless Archdevil Lord had reinforced the Devil Holy Grounds with his strength, it wouldn’t be enough to stand against Huang Xiaolong and the others’ strength. After all, he was just a single overlord...

There was also something everyone had to take note of. Huang Xiaolong and the others were forcefully restricting themselves so as not to allow the energy of the battle to leak outwards. If they really did, they might even destroy the world outside the Devil Holy Ground...

An hour later...

The endless number of experts who charged fearlessly into battle finally felt a sense of dread as they stopped rushing towards the barrier.

The sight that greeted them was a scene of destruction as even the space around them had been torn into shreds. Horrifying black holes could be seen floating in the sky above them.

The old ancestor of the Devil Beast Gate had long since been killed by Huang Xiaolong. The Devil Beast Gate that dominated a portion of their world no longer existed. In the hour of battle, countless superpowers fell.

Huang Xiaolong finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that they were no longer trying to break through the barrier. It wasn’t because he was afraid of them, but rather, he couldn’t bear to kill off half the experts from the Devil World and Kingdom of Devil Beasts!

If he really continued his massacre, who would be left when he took over the Heavenless Archdevil Lord’s position?

Just as Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief, a massive palm reached towards the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The speed of the palm was extremely quick as it appeared in the space above the lotus in the blink of an eye.

As soon as the palm appeared, origin energy filled the land as the resplendent light emitted by the lotus started to contract.

It was an overlord-level Sovereign!

No... there was two overlords! Three more palms appeared and shot towards the Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus.

Those who could control the origin energy at will had to be overlord-level Sovereigns!

Huang Xiaolong turned around, and he didn’t think too much about it. The tiny chaos axe appeared once again, and Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred. In an instant, he appeared above the lotus.

Even though the other party was an overlord, Huang Xiaolong’s tiny chaos axe wasn’t a piece of decoration. It blocked off all four palms as the Radiance Divine Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand shot outwards.

Two miserable cries resounded through the sky. However, their screams didn’t remain for long as they were sent flying after sustaining severe injuries.

When Huang Xiaolong’s Radiance Divine Scepter sent the two overlords flying, a massive dragon claw appeared from behind him and reached for the lotus. Seeing as the lotus was about to fall into the hands of an outsider, purple lightning swarmed towards the claw as Cang Mutian’s palm followed closely behind it.

Boom!

The hidden expert was sent flying by the little cow and Cang Mutian.

“Father!” Zhao Rou turned deathly pale as the person sent flying was her father, the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor, Zhao Yuan!

When Zhao Yuan landed on one of the distant mountain ranges, his chest was bloodied, and he spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood.

Zhao Rou quickly ran over to her father’s side. She poured spiritual pills into his mouth as she begged Huang Xiaolong, “Please, please don’t kill my father!”

Zhao Yuan’s armor was shattered beyond recognition, and his body was falling apart. Even though he was an overlord, he hadn’t even consolidated his foundation after breaking through. It was impossible for him to stand against both Cang Mutian and the little cow at the same time.

The little cow and Cang Mutian quickly turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, but they were met with a frosty expression. “I’ve already said. I’ll kill anyone who dares to cross the ten billion miles mark!”

The blood instantly drained from Zhao Rou’s face when she heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Cang Mutian hesitated for a moment before muttering under his breath, “Xiaolong, I can be considered Zhao Yuan’s old acquaintance. Can you give him a chance?”
