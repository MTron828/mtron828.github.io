Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The plaza fell into silence in an instant.

Feng Chan from the Fiend God Emperor Palace swallowed a mouthful of saliva and looked at ancestor Liu Yuan, beside him. “Ancestor Liu Yuan, did you see that?”

The Fiend God Emperor hadn’t personally made an appearance, so Liu Yuan was the strongest member of the Fiend God Emperor Palace currently present. He was an expert at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, and he might even have touched the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

Liu Yuan’s face turned serious, and he said in a solemn tone, “The monster behind Huang Xiaolong made the move. It might not be weaker than me!” A tremor ran through his heart.

“What?! Not weaker than you?! How can that be? Are you sure?!” Feng Chan’s shock doubled as he couldn’t believe what Liu Yuan said.

Liu Yuan was an existence at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm! He wasn’t a mere Tenth Order Emperor. He was someone who had combat prowess at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

“It might be difficult for you to believe, but it’s true. I won’t be wrong in my judgment of strength.” Liu Yuan replied with certainty.

Feng Chan’s expression changed.

An existence no weaker than Liu Yuan?!

“It’s no wonder Huang Xiaolong dares to act so rampantly. He even swore to stomp Heavenly Prince Di Jing beneath his feet. It seems as though the Fortune Emperor Palace has some experts backing them up...” Wang Yongsen sneered, ‘However, does he really think that he can do whatever he wants with a single expert at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm?”

Feng Chen’s eyes glowed with a cold light. He thought about many things. For example, Zhou Chen’s death, Special Envoy He and Chen...

His expression turned increasingly gloomy.

However, that also strengthened his resolve to kill Huang Xiaolong. The moment they enter the Heavenly Court Secret Region, he would use all he had to hunt Huang Xiaolong down!

When Lan Tailong of the Brightness Emperor Palace heard what one of the Brightness Emperor Palace’s ancestors said, his thoughts drifted towards the same direction as that of Feng Chan.

Ancestor Chen Wenqian of the Brightness Emperor Palace was as strong as Liu Yuan. He also confirmed that the beast behind Huang Xiaolong was at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

“How did the Fortune Emperor Palace pull in someone like that?” Despite Lan Tailong’s unwillingness, he managed to force the question out of his mouth.

“Do you think it has something to do with the Grandmist Emperor?” Peng Xingfei spoke up all of a sudden.

“Are you saying that the Grandmist Emperor sent out that beast to protect Huang Xiaolong?” Lan Tailong asked in shock.

Peng Xingfei nodded his head in trepidation. “When Huang Xiaolong went to the Grandmist Emperor Palace, the Grandmist Emperor sent his direct disciple to welcome that little brat. After that was done, the Grandmist Emperor personally arrived to cripple Wu Tianhao and the others who offended Huang Xiaolong. He then chased them out of the Grandmist Emperor Palace!”

Lan Tailong shook his head and reasoned, “Huang Xiaolong is someone who came from the lower worlds. That is something we have already confirmed. There is no way he can be the Grandmist Emperor’s illegitimate son. The Heavenly Court also confirmed that he has no direct relationship with the Grandmist Emperor. Ever since he arrived in the Divine World, the Grandmist Emperor had been in seclusion in the Grandmist Emperor Palace. There is no way that he can be related to Huang Xiaolong.”

“Young master, do we change our plans?” Peng Xingfei hesitated for a moment before asking.

“Nope!” A frosty light flashed through Lan Tailong’s eyes.

According to their plan, they were going to hunt Huang Xiaolong down to perform a soul search on him before stealing his treasure. After they were done, they were going to cripple him!

“Yes!”

When everyone was busy guessing his identity, Huang Xiaolong stared at the Solitude Emperor Palace’s members with a chilly gaze. “Are you not going to leave? Cherish the chance I have given you. If you scram now, you might be able to leave alive.”

Gudu Canyang’s face was ugly beyond comparison. However, when his gaze landed on the beast behind Huang Xiaolong, he hastily gathered everyone, and they left with their tails tucked between their legs.

Everyone from the Fortune Emperor Palace cheered when they saw how the members of the Solitude Emperor Palace were leaving.

Huang Xiaolong led everyone onto the sixty-first platform and casually turned his gaze to Lan Tailong and Chen Wenqian.

When Gudu Wuyi had made his move, Huang Xiaolong was extremely clear that he had received orders from Chen Wenqian.

When Huang Xiaolong had secluded himself for cultivation, Bei Xiaomei had dug out everything related to why they were kicked out of Manor 61. The Brightness Emperor Palace had instructed Yu Shi to chase them out for the sake of the Solitude Emperor Palace.

Everything was due to the interference of the Brightness Emperor Palace.

At this moment, Lan Tailong and Chen Wenqian looked over, and their gazes clashed. A cold sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

As for Lan Tailong and Chen Wenqian, a frown formed on their faces.

From a patch of space above the plaza, the Heavenly Court’s marshals looked at the scene happening below them, and shock filled their eyes.

“Heavenly Prince, are we going to send some people down to take care of him?” Marshal Yu Shi stood up and asked Di Jing cautiously.

Of course, he was referring to Huang Xiaolong.

Di Jing remained utterly calm as he instructed, “There is no need. The battle is about to begin soon.”

“Yes, Heavenly Prince.”

“Let’s go.”

In an instant, Di Jing led the marshals as all of them appeared in mid-air.

“We greet Your Highness, the Heavenly Prince!”

“The Heavenly Prince has arrived!”

As soon as Di Jing appeared, the plaza erupted with activity. Everyone no longer bothered with Huang Xiaolong, and they looked at Di Jing and the group of marshals from the Heavenly Court.

As Di Jian sauntered to the front of the plaza, he emitted the prestige of a ruler, and everyone felt a horrifying pressure press down on them. It was as though the sky itself was pushing down on them.

That was the power of heaven and earth!

With the Heavenly Dao Godhead, Di Jing would become a part of the heavenly dao when he matured. He was the embodiment of heavenly dao itself!

Everyone had to experience lightning tribulations during their journey of cultivation. Even when Huang Xiaolong would break into the Emperor Realm in the future, he would experience lightning tribulation from the primal chaos lightning. However, Di Jing was exempted from anything related to the lightning tribulation.

Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes as he looked at Di Jing. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He even ordered the two odd beasts to circulate their real strength to probe Di Jing’s strength.

However, no matter how they tried, they were unable to feel Di Jing’s actual strength.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong was in a similar position. Even if an existence at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm were to probe him with their divine sense, they would be unable to learn of his real strength. Thus, he wasn’t surprised at all.

As Di Jing slowly walked forward, he didn’t slow down nor glance at Huang Xiaolong when he passed by the platform. He simply made his way to the main stage in the plaza.

“Give out the identity plates. Prepare for the commencement of the preliminary battle.” Di Jing instructed one of the marshals below him.

With a respectful departure, the marshal left to carry out his orders.

The Battle of the Heavenly Court was split into the preliminary and semifinals. After the identity plates were given out, the Heavenly Court Secret Region would open, and those with the identity plates would be eligible to take part in the preliminary round.
