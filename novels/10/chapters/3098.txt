Chapter 3099: Making Friends?

Lei Yu chuckled uncontrollably when he heard what she said. “Little lass, if I break two of my limbs, wouldn’t that make me a cripple? How would I continue to be my master’s mount in the future? His Highness would be made a laughing stock!”

Huang Xiaolong and the others couldn’t help but burst into laughter when they heard what Lei Yu said.

The person who tried the hardest to hold it in was the Myriad Formation Devil, and his lips twitched uncontrollably. He was amused by the absurdity of the situation.

Wangu Qinger finally heard the sarcasm in his voice and she roared in rage, “You’re asking to die!” With a wave of her hand, she commanded all the experts behind her. “Kill them all!”

“All of them!”

As soon as the words left her lips, several hundred experts of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch pounced on Lei Yu and the others.

Xu Minghua, who sank into his thoughts the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong, failed to react in time. He couldn’t stop them from doing anything stupid, and Lei Yu ended everything with a sweep of his legs.

“Mighty Leg Sweeps the World!”

With a random battle cry, Lei Yu put on an arrogant expression as he swept his leg out in an exaggerated motion.

Despite his stupid actions, no one managed to evade his strike as everyone was sent flying into the distance.

After all of them were gone, Lei Yu placed his leg down and started to do some stretches. With a sh*t-eating grin, he turned to the Myriad Formation Devil and sighed, “It’s been so long since I last stretched! It feels so good!”

Wangu Qinger stared at the experts who were sent flying, and she didn’t know what to do. There were a ton of experts at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, and there were several stronger ones at the peak of the late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm! However, none of them managed to stop the three headed mutt before her!

Moreover, she noticed that Lei Yu didn’t use the slightest bit of energy when dealing with them.

She wasn’t mistaken. Lei Yu only used the strength of his fleshy body. As a beast of creation, he could remain in the deepest regions of the Bright Lightning Abyss of the Divine Tuo Holy World with the strength of his physical body alone! With the constant tempering by the horrifying lightning qi, his dao physique reached a terrifying level!

If he were to fight with any monsters in the top ten ranks of the Extermination List and all of them used the power of their physical bodies, he might not be at a disadvantage!

“You!” Wangu Qinger snapped when she looked at Huang Xiaolong and Lei Yu.

“Are you Huang Xiaolong?” Xu Minghua asked out of the blue.

Huang Xiaolong?!

Wangu Qinger’s eyes flashed and her gaze fell onto the young man riding the three headed beast.

Huang Xiaolong’s reputation had spread far and wide in the Origin Heavenly Cave. First, he killed Xie Li and Zhu Jingchen in the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce. Then, he took out ten trillion dao coins and some Pure Soil to buy out several treasures there!

Secondly, he injured Marshal Jiang Meng of the World Master’s Manor in the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce!

And the most shocking piece of news was that Huang Xiaolong’s mount was Lei Yu, a monster who was said to have left the Origin Holy World!

As for the treasures on Huang Xiaolong, there was no doubt everyone knew about the Pure Soil in his possession.

Every single piece of news was enough to turn everyone’s attention onto him.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong replied.

Wangu Qinger couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread when she heard his answer. There was a rumor going around the Origin Holy World that Huang Xiaolong was a bloodthirsty monster. He didn’t care who he was up against, and he would kill anyone in his path! That was what happened to Xie Li and Zhu Jingchen, and people said that the only reason Jiang Meng lived was because he was too strong to be killed by the likes of Lei Yu!

When she thought about how she ordered her subordinates to kill Huang Xiaolong and the others…

She was afraid he would take revenge and slay them all where they stood!

Xu Minghua kept up his cheery appearance as he cupped his fists. “As it turns out, Young Master Huanghas arrived. This is a misunderstanding and I hope we can maintain our good relations! Branch Pavilion Master Wangu invited Young Master Huang here in hopes of fostering a great friendship!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “Who might you be?”

Xu Minghua continued, “I am Xu Minghua of the Mystical Pavilion, and you might not have heard of me before. However, Young Master Huang’s reputation precedes him! It’s no wonder I managed to recognize you.” Pausing for a moment, he turned to Wangu Qinger, “She’s the daughter of Branch Pavilion Master Wangu, Wangu Qinger.”

Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at her. “I see! She’s one of the top five beauties of the Origin Holy World, Wangu Qinger!” However, his tone changed in the next instant. “Whatever. I’ll let you off on account of your father. If you kneel and apologize, we’ll call it a day.”

Wangu Qinger’s expression changed when she heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted her to get on her knees to apologize. “Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are? Do you really think you’re the world master of the Origin Holy World?!”

Xu Minghua’s face froze and he growled, “Young Master Huang must be joking… Right?”

Turning serious, a frosty expression appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Why would I joke around with you?”

He wanted to see what Wangu Xu’s reaction would be after he punished his daughter.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong didn’t like her the moment she appeared. As the Son of Creation, he didn’t go around asking people to cripple themselves! He was extremely disgusted by the way Wangu Qinger carried herself.

Xu Minghua frowned. “Young Master Huang, please take into account Branch Pavilion Master Wangu’s reptation…”

“I’ll only show respect to my friends. Wangu Xu and I cannot be considered friends at the moment.” Huang Xiaolong interrupted him. “It’s useless to use his name as leverage.”

Wangu Qinger burst into rage. “Senior Brother Xu, there’s no need to reason with this b*stard! There’s no way I’m getting to my knees, and there’s nothing he can do about it!” She turned to Huang Xiaolong and snapped, “Huang Xiaolong, if you touch a single hair on my body, my father will definitely…!”

She couldn’t finish her sentence as Lei Yu’s voice boomed through the air. “Kneel!” The sound waves were like mountains that crashed down on those standing against Huang Xiaolong. A crushing pressure forced them all to their knees and no matter how hard Wangu Qinger struggled, she couldn’t move a muscle.

She might be ranked sixth on the Mystical List, but her strength was nowhere near the mighty Lei Yu!

Xu Minghua was shocked. He didn’t expect Lei Yu to do as he pleased.

One had to know that the Limitless Sacred Land was the territory of the Mystical Pavilion!

“Young Master Huang!” Xu Minghua stammered.

“If you plan to plead on her behalf, you’ll be on your knees too.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Xu Minghua stared at Wangqu Qinger and decided to keep his mouth shut.

Since the exchange started, many experts had gathered around. They pointed at Wangqu Qinger and openly mocked her, painting an interesting scene.

When Wangu Qinger noticed the looks of mockery she was getting, rage bubbled in her heart. Her expression turned unsightly. It was an insult to Dao Venerables if they were made to kneel, and she wasn’t just any ordinary Dao Venerable! She was the daughter of Wangu Xu, and she was one of the top five beauties in the Origin Holy World! She never suffered such humiliation in her life!

“Huang Xiaolong, my father will tear you into shreds!” Wangu Qinger growled as killing intent shot out from her eyes.

Huang Xiaolong remained completely impassive. “Xu Minghua said that your father personally invited me over to foster the friendship between us. Why would he kill me?”

“Heh.” Lei Yu, who had been forcing his laughter back the entire time, failed to control himself.
