“I never thought that your schemes ran so deep! You’ve really hidden yourself well. No wonder you dared to leave the Fortune Emperor Palace openly without hiding your destination! As it turned out, you had Emperor Realm experts to protect you!” A vicious expression appeared on Zhou Chen’s face as he continued, “Since that is how it is, I shall make a move personally! I want to see if your Emperor Realm bodyguards will be able to protect you from me!”

The killing intent around Zhou Chen seemed to solidify and the air around him became heavier.

All of a sudden, a terrifying amount of power shrouded Zhou Chen’s palace and light started to gather high in the sky. A giant face started to form in the air.

When Zhou Chen saw the face hanging high above him, his heart skipped a beat and he knelt on the ground with a ‘plop’. “Greetings, Great Lord!”

The giant face groaned in reply and said “You don’t need to personally make a move against Huang Xiaolong.” The voice suddenly became softer and he continued, “Huang Xiaolong has the king of supreme godhead and he isn’t as easy to deal with as you think. Moreover, your identity cannot be exposed right now! Hold in your anger for the sake of our race’s plans.”

Despite the unwillingness in his heart, Zhou Chen didn’t dare to go against the power that formed the giant face in the air. He could only nod respectfully.

“Does Fang Gan keep the Fortune Divine Artifact on him at all times?”

“Yes. Great Lord, I am currently unable to use the Fortune Divine Artifact.” Zhou Chen replied.

“If that’s the case, try to find a way to lure Fang Gan away from the Fortune Emperor Palace.” The giant face in the air muttered softly.

Zhou Chen was stunned for a second and he asked with an expression of shock, “Great Lord, are you planning to kill Fang Gan? He has hidden his true strength well and might even have broken through the Tenth Order Emperor Realm. With the Fortune Divine Artifact, even an ordinary late-Tenth Order Emperor would be unable to kill him!”

The giant face replied with indifference, “Since ordinary Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts aren’t able to kill him, we’ll let experts at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm make a move. Someone will definitely be able to kill him. You don’t need to care about the finer details. Just find a way to lure Fang Gan out of the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Zhou Chen thought about it and replied carefully, “Yes. However, Fang Gan has always been a cautious man. If I were to urge him to leave the Fortune Emperor Palace, he will definitely develop some suspicions.”

“There’s no hurry. Just use the next two to three hundred years to carry out your plan. Even if you can’t get the chance to lure him out, just inform me the moment he takes a step out of the Fortune Emperor Palace. I will get some people to do the job. After all, he can’t possibly stay in the Fortune Emperor Palace without taking a step out, can he?”

When he heard that he had two to three hundred years of time to make his move, Zhou Chen felt a wave of relief wash over him. “Great Lord, please be at ease. I will report to you the moment Fang Gan leaves the Fortune Emperor Palace!”

“As for Huang Xiaolong, is he going to the Hell Asura World to temper himself?!” The giant face suddenly changed the topic and asked all of a sudden.

“Yes. This subordinate has received news that Huang Xiaolong is only planning to return for the Battle of the Heavenly Court.”

The giant face laughed coldly, “Since that is the case, I shall allow him to remain at the Hell Asura World forever! Initially, I wanted to send disciples from the Fiend God Emperor Palace and the Brightness Emperor Palace to deal with him. However, he grows too quickly. We can no longer allow him to grow stronger. With his speed, he might even reach the Emperor Realm in two to three hundred years!”

An Emperor Realm expert with a king of supreme godhead would pose too much of a variable in their plans.

Before long, the giant face in the sky dissipated and all traces of him being there disappeared like a puff of smoke.

Zhou Chen was finally able to heave a sigh of relief and he slowly got to his feet.

“Fang Gan...” A brilliant light flashed through his eyes as he stared into the distance.

His mind started moving and he thought about how he should go about taking control of the Fortune Emperor Palace the moment Fang Gan died!

In a flash, a month passed.

The Dragon Shark Flying Ship stopped in mid air and Huang Xiaolong’s party emerged from the ship.

Looking at the intertwining streets emitting a faint illusory glow, all of them couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

The Heavens Avenue was a work of art. It was so intricate that it seemed to be the work of god. Despite the number of divine planes they visited and the amount of majestic architecture they admired, nothing came close to the Heavens Avenue.

After a brief stop, Huang Xiaolong led all of them towards it. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When the heavenly soldiers went to check Huang Xiaolong’s identity as he approached, they received a huge shock. Their attitudes changed instantly and they became extremely polite.

When they heard that Huang Xiaolong was going to the headquarters of the Silver Fox Chamber of Commerce, the squad leader made the suggestion of escorting him there.

Even after trying his best, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t able to refuse the squad leader.

With the squad leader in the lead, all of them traveled unobstructed towards the Silver Fox Chamber of Commerce.

When they arrived at the main entrance, the squad leader finally bade them farewell and took his leave.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong and friends stepped into the main hall, a frown formed on their faces. A group of people wearing robes belonging to the Brightness Emperor Palace was crowding within.

Moreover, all of them seemed to be at least an elder in the Brightness Emperor Palace.

Out of all of them, Huang Xiaolong found two of their figures to be extremely familiar. After taking a closer look, he recognized both of them. They were Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang!

As his gaze swept past the two of them, Huang Xiaolong saw the two people who were standing at the front of the group. From their attire, he was able to determine that they were hall masters in the Brightness Emperor Palace.

Tian Ziyi casually looked around and his gaze just so happened to land on Huang Xiaolong. The moment he caught sight of Huang Xiaolong’s hateful face, a burst of killing intent emerged from his body.

“Huang Xiaolong!!!” He yelled through gritted teeth.

Even though his teeth were clenched tightly together, his voice echoed through the hall and everyone turned around at the same time. Even some of the experts from other Emperor Palaces looked over and an expression of shock formed on their faces.

“He is the person who has a king of supreme godhead? I heard that he passed through the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selections to take part in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. His combat strength should be somewhere around the Seventh Order God King Realm.”

“How is that possible?! Nonsense! The apprenticeship ceremony wasn’t too long ago... how can he improve so quickly?”

Some of the experts from the other Emperor Palace broke out in discussion.

Even though the selections didn’t take place too long ago, many people had already obtained news about it. Moreover, the news they received raised huge waves among those in the cultivation world.

Huang Xiaolong’s speed of improvement was too quick!

All of a sudden, one of the short and fat hall masters from the Brightness Emperor Palace turned to ask Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang, “Is he the Huang Xiaolong who robbed your low-grade chaos spiritual veins?”

“Yes, hall master, that’s him!” Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang replied respectfully before glaring at Huang Xiaolong hatefully.

This short and fat hall master was precisely the hall master of the disciplinary hall of the Brightness Emperor Palace and he was a rank above the two of them.

Stepping forward, he spoke to Huang Xiaolong in an indifferent voice, “Huang Xiaolong, hand those spiritual veins over and our Brightness Emperor Palace will not pursue this matter any further.”

Huang Xiaolong casually cursed, “Retard...”

Fang Gan had already sent a reply to the Brightness Emperor Palace and Huang Xiaolong refused to believe that they didn’t know about the ins and outs of the matter. Since they knew, why were they asking him for the low-grade chaos spiritual veins? They were merely looking for an excuse to start some trouble. It was also possible that they were helping Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang to get some revenge.

After all, Huang Xiaolong had dragged the reputation of the Brightness Emperor Palace through the mud by stripping Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang before making them roll through Demon Tiger City naked.
