When they returned to the Fortune Emperor Palace, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother wasting time in the divine planes surrounding it. He flew directly towards the palace.

The instant Huang Xiaolong stepped into the palace, everyone noticed his return. Zhou Chen and Sun Shihai naturally received the news of his return.

Li Lu, Yao Chi, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao gathered together the moment they received news of Huang Xiaolong’s return.

Yao Chi and Li Lu were over the moon and could barely contain their happiness. As for Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao, they tried to contain themselves. It was too bad the look of joy in their eyes couldn’t be suppressed no matter how hard they tried.

Yao Chi pulled the three of them along as they flew out of the door.

In the distance, they saw Huang Xiaolong slowly flying towards them.

The sun was perfectly positioned behind him and a golden glow covered his body. Riding on the little cow, Huang Xiaolong slowly flew towards them.

Looking at the little cow’s head shaking from side to side, Yao Chi couldn’t contain her laughter. ‘Puchi’. When the little cow heard Yao Chi’s laughter, she raised her front legs and greeted, “Hey little beauties, this old cow is back!”

This old cow is back!

Her voice echoed through the entire palace.

When the other three ladies heard the little cow’s proclamation, they couldn’t control their laughter either.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he felt cold sweat forming on his forehead. Why does it seem so ridiculous?! Something doesn’t sound right...

How was this a female cow?! This damn cow sounded like a damn gangster picking up chicks!

Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel at the back tried to hold their laughter.

As they slowly neared the four ladies, the sight of the familiar smiles on their face entered Huang Xiaolong’s eyes and a smile slowly formed on his face. Unlike him, the ladies felt their heartbeat speeding up when they saw the smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Even the icy Peng Xiao felt her face heating up.

When they looked at Huang Xiaolong again, all of them felt that the aura he emitted was different from before.

The little cow slapped her head when she saw the expression on the four of their faces. “I knew it! Didn’t I say that you became more charming during this trip out of the palace? Look! Their faces are redder than tomatoes! I’m so sad now...”

Black lines instantly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

Fang Xuanxuan asked with an obvious blush on her face, “Senior cow, why are you sad?”

“Look at this little brat! What if more girls try seducing him in the future? Wouldn’t there be a huge group of beauties around him everyday?! Of course I’m sad!”

The four ladies broke into melodious laughter.

Huang Xiaolong slapped the little cow’s head and reprimanded, “I don’t think you’re feeling sad.”

“What else can I feel other than sadness?!”

“I think you feel like getting beaten up!” Huang Xiaolong snarled. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Once again, pleasant laughter filled the air.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to ask about their experiences while he was away, a summoning signal flew towards him. When he opened it, he realized that his master, Zhao Lei had sent it. There wasn’t anything important written in it, but it indicated for him to report to the cultivation palace at once.

Huang Xiaolong felt a little helpless as well and he could only apologize to the four ladies, “Master has summoned me...”

Fang Xuanxuan stuttered, “Xiaolong, about the Brightness Emperor Palace... you have to be careful when Ancestor Zhou Chen brings it up.”

“That’s right! Xiaolong, it seems as though Ancestor Zhou Chen wants you to hand over Xiang Xun before accepting the Brightness Emperor Palace’s punishment!” Yao Chi added, “Why don’t...”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and smiled, “There is nothing to worry about. Please relax.” He was clear as to what Yao Chi wanted to say.

He quickly sent them to the Dragon Tiger Hall to wait for his return. Riding the little cow once again, he headed towards Zhao Lei’s place.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong’s back, Li Lu tightened her grip on Yao Chi’s hand. She swore “Since Xiaolong said that it’s fine, everything will be fine.”

She knew Huang Xiaolong since they were young and she understood him better than the others.

Yao Chi slowly nodded her head.

When Huang Xiaolong disappeared into the horizon, the four ladies returned to wait for him.

In the distance, Sun Shihai stared at the ladies as they flew away. His eyes were cold and he thought about how his Celestial Blood Ape Physique would be breaking through to the sixth layer soon.

Not only was his Celestial Blood Ape Physique going to break into the sixth layer, he had even managed to awaken a different type of concealed energy in his body!

The strength he felt hidden in his body was so strong that he didn’t dare to believe it existed.

“There are only four more months to the selections.” Sun Shihai muttered to himself. An icy light shot out of his eyes and he swore, “Huang Xiaolong, I have been waiting too long for this day to come...”

The scene where they chose their masters appeared fresh in his mind.

Even though it had been a long time ago, he could never forget about it! It tortured him at every waking moment and he couldn’t wait to ruthlessly crush Huang Xiaolong beneath his feet! He wanted to play Huang Xiaolong to death!

Clenching his fists tightly together, he ground his fingers deeper into his flesh, as though he was crushing Huang Xiaolong in his palm.

......

As Huang Xiaolong made his way to Zhao Lei’s place, a group of disciples appeared before him.

Looking at them, he knew that they were there for him. After all, they were from the Enforcement Hall.

When they arrived before him, they stopped and surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

“Martial Uncle Huang, we received Ancestor Zhou Chen’s order to bring you to him. He has something he needs to talk to you about.” The way they spoke to Huang Xiaolong was somewhat polite.

Huang Xiaolong’s face didn’t change and he replied, “Go back and tell him I am currently visiting my master. After I meet with my master, I will look for him.”

All of the disciples from the Enforcement Hall frowned.

“Huang Xiaolong, do you think that you can defy an elder’s order just because you have a King of Supreme Godhead?!” one of the disciples from the Enforcement Hall yelled. “You had better follow us to meet Ancestor Zhou Chen right now! You can go meet Chief of Hall Masters Zhao after that!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with all of them and he forced his way forward.

The expressions on the faces of the disciples from the Enforcement Hall changed.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you!” Just as one of the disciples was about to make a move, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel swiped out with their tail. The moment they struck him, he was sent flying.

He only crawled up when Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and the Chaos Black Camel had disappeared in the distance. His expression was one of extreme shock.

In a short while, Huang Xiaolong saw Zhao Lei’s palace and there was a lone person standing in the wide space before the massive palace. It was his senior, Chen Hao. When he saw Huang Xiaolong, a look of joy flashed past his face and he quickly greeted, “Junior brother!”

A smile revealed itself on Huang Xiaolong’s face and he returned the greeting, “Senior brother.”

“You brat! You grew more handsome after going out!” Chen Hao patted Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder and laughed.

Huang Xiaolong snickered in a low voice in response.

“Let’s head in. Master is waiting for you.” Chen Hao didn’t drag the conversation on any further and he brought Huang Xiaolong towards Zhao Lei’s palace.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at Zhao Lei’s palace, Zhou Chen received the report from the disciples of the Enforcement Hall. After blanking out for a moment, he slammed his hand into his table, turning it into dust. He said to Li Shan and Chen Yirong who were beside him, “Look at that! Huang Xiaolong is too arrogant! Even I, an Ancestor of the palace, am not able to greet him when he comes back!”
