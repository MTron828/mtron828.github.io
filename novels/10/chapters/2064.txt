Chapter 2065: Jiang Hong Severely Injured

Huang Xiaolong was also astounded, looking at the number of origin treasures inside the Heaven Vault Palace. After his astonishment receded, his eyes were brimming and sparkling with ecstasy. He had advanced to the mid-Ninth Order Emperor Realm by obtaining the Fiend Shrine’s inheritance. He had been wracking his brain thinking how he would cultivate to reach the peak of late-Ninth Order Emperor Realm in the shortest time.

Seeing these level-one and level-two origin treasures spread before him, he didn’t need to worry about that anymore for the time being. After the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness ripened, it was certain that he could break through to peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm after refining them! Maybe, he would even step into Sovereign Realm in one go!

Huang Xiaolong was ecstatic for a long time as his thoughts raced, but he soon calmed down.

With these level-one and level-two origin treasures, it increased his chances of snatching the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness by several points.

“As expected of the Ancient Heavenly Court’s treasury, apart from the level-one and level-two origin treasures, there were other treasures as well. Each one of them could make the experts outside fight head and feet for it.” The King of Darkness went on excitedly, “Moreover, with these level-one and level-two origin treasures, Xiaolong, you can surely break through to the Sovereign Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly as he shook his head, “Hard to say for sure.” If it was any other king of supreme godhead genius, these level-one and level-two origin treasures were absolutely more than sufficient to enable him to break through to Sovereign Realm. On the other hand, the result remained to be seen for Huang Xiaolong.

The King of Darkness looked confused for a second. He stressed, “These level-one and level-two origin treasures here are enough to support two to three high-level Emperor Realm experts to advance to Sovereign Realm. With you consuming all of them alone, they are enough for you to break through to the Sovereign Realm... right?”

But the King of Darkness’s confidence diminished as he spoke. He recalled that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had merely risen that much after passing the Ksana Divine Temple and Fiend Shrine’s tests. Had it been another person, he would most likely have broken through to the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm by now.

Huang Xiaolong did not continue discussing the matter and change the subject, “Take this Immortal Metallic Star to refine it and heal your injuries.”

A suction force from his hand pulled the Immortal Metallic Star into his palm.

The Immortal Metallic Star was also a legendary treasure for healing. Even though it was only a level-one origin treasure, its effects were incomparable to the Blood of Darkness. Nonetheless, it was beneficial to heal the King of Darkness’s injuries.

“No, all these origin treasures are crucial to you.” The King of Darkness refused, shaking his head, and added, “You need these origin treasures to raise your strength.”

“It doesn’t matter if I have this Immortal Metallic Star or not, but it is of great use to you. Even if I refine all the level-one and level-two origin treasures here, I might not break through to Sovereign Realm. The result will be the same even if I refine this Immortal Metallic Star.”

The King of Darkness hesitated before accepting the Immortal Metallic Star. Honestly, he really needed the Immortal Metallic Star.

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong’s expression changed.

The King of Darkness was baffled by the abrupt change on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Senior Brother! Something has happened to Senior Brother!” Huang Xiaolong said briskly. “I got a message from Master, saying that someone sneaked into the Grandmist Emperor Palace and severely injured Senior Brother!”

“What!” The King of Darkness was taken aback, hearing the news. The Old Ancestor Azure Cow, Cang Mutian, Jiang Hong, and the others had already swept the enemies away. They were merely waiting for the day of his inauguration ceremony. Under these circumstances, someone had actually managed to injure Senior Brother Jiang Hong!?

If it weren’t for the King of Grandmist and the little cow arriving in time, Jiang Hong wouldn’t have merely ended up with just ‘severe injuries.’ He could have lost his life in that person’s hands.

Huang Xiaolong’s words trailed off as he spoke, “Luckily, my Master and Xiaoniu rushed over in time, or else...!”

“Then, did your Master and Old Ancestor Azure Cow catch that person?” The King of Darkness asked with concern.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “That person ran away with an escape technique upon seeing my Master and Xiaoniu, but my Master exchanged one move with that person before he escaped. According to my Master, that person’s strength is at the same level as his own strength.”

“Not weaker than the King of Grandmist?” The King of Darkness was clearly shocked hearing that. “Who could it be? Old Monster Lun Zhuan? Or Old Crow Ancestor?”

“Master says it was neither of them.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head.

A cold light gleamed in the depths of the King of Darkness’s eyes as he spoke, “In this universe, the number of people who are powerful enough to stand at par with your Master is no more than ten. If it was neither the Old Monster Lun Zhuan nor Old Crow Ancestor, who can it be...?” His voice trailed off, and his eyes narrowed as a possibility occurred to him, “Could it be someone from the City of All-Heavens!?”

The City of All-Heavens!

Hearing the city’s name, most people would think of Lord Wan Shi immediately. But the King of Darkness knew very well that Lord Wan Shi was not the only reputable expert in the City of All Heavens.

The City of All-Heavens had several experts that could be hailed as overlord on this side of the universe. One of them was Wan Shi’s son, Wan Yue. Apart from Wan Yue, there were two other people.

Hence, although it was said that Lord Wan Shi was in seclusion all these years to comprehend some supreme divine technique, the City of All-Heavens remained a deterring force. With Wan Yue and the other two overlords’ presence, no one dared to challenge the City of All-Heavens’ prestige.

“The City of All-Heavens.” A sharp light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he repeated the name.

Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness accelerated the Ancient Heavenly Court’s speed to make it back to the Divine World as fast as possible.

Two days later, the Ancient Heavenly Court sped over the Divine World’s boundary.

Huang Xiaolong saw Jiang Hong at the Grandmist Emperor Palace. But his eyes narrowed dangerously when he saw a pallid Jiang Hong lying quietly on the bed, breathing weakly. Huang Xiaolong’s face sank. Jiang Hong’s injuries were more severe than he had imagined.

On the center of Jiang Hong’s chest was a hideous black palm print, with sinister dark runes moving around.

“Your Senior Brother was hit with the most insidious Vile Ghost Palm.” The King of Grandmist spoke first. “We have temporarily suppressed the poison inside his body, but your Radiance World’s origin energy is required to deal with this Vile Ghost Palm.

Even though the King of Grandmist and Reverence Moon Old Man were powerful, they were somewhat powerless against the negative effects of the Vile Ghost Palm. Only the Radiance World’s origin energy could completely expel the Vile Ghost Palm’s poison out of Jiang Hong’s body.

It was a similar situation to Cang Mutian’s when he was entangled by the ghost copper creatures before. Cang Mutian was able to extricate himself from that situation relying on Huang Xiaolong’s help after Huang Xiaolong had gotten the Radiance Ancestor’s complete inheritance.

“Don’t worry, Master, I will make sure Senior Brother gets well.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and hurried to Jiang Hong’s bedside.

The sixteen radiance wings unfurled from his back as he carefully controlled and directed the Radiance World’s origin energy to expel the poisonous dark energy from Jiang Hong’s body bit by bit.

Even with Huang Xiaolong’s high purity Radiance World’s origin energy, it took him over three years to completely clear all the poisonous dark energy from Jiang Hong’s body.

That was due to the gap in strength between Huang Xiaolong and the person who had struck Jiang Hong. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have taken so much of Huang Xiaolong’s time and effort.

Huang Xiaolong could finally breathe in relief seeing Jiang Hong’s condition became stable.

So were the King of Grandmist and the others after confirming Jiang Hong would be fine.

“Xiaolong, we’ve just gotten news that the City of All-Heavens’ Wan Yue has issued the All-Heavens’ Order to the myriad worlds, proclaiming you and your Senior Brother Jiang Hong as sinners of heaven.”

The little cow interjected, “In my opinion, nine out of ten that your Senior Brother’s injuries are related to the City of All-Heavens.”

“Sinners of heaven?” Huang Xiaolong sneered ironically, “There will be a day when I kill all the way until their City of All-Heavens and raze their city to the ground.”

Cang Mutian added, “There is another matter. Wan Yue has also issued a declaration decree that fifty years later when the Darkness Gold Fruit and Blood of Darkness ripens, these two items will belong to the City of All-Heavens. Whoever dares to snatch these two items will be subjected to nine familial executions.”
