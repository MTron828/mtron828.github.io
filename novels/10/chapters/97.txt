Chapter 98: Wings of Demon

Walking into the main hall, his parents, Huang Peng and Su Yan, were there. Other than the two of them, in the main hall sat a young woman wearing a long pastel green dress. The young woman has creamy white skin, soft cherry blossom lips, and bright eyes that held a trace of mischief and naughtiness and she had two lovely dimples on her cheeks, akin to an immortal fairy unstained by the mortal realm.

This was Li Lu.

Four years had passed and Li Lu was now fifteen. Proving what Su Yan had said years ago, Li Lu grew up to be a beautiful woman, and now, every time Li Lu stepped out, it was enough to stun the whole street.

The current Cosmic Star Academy had three big beauties and Li Lu was one of them.

“Xiaolong!”

Seeing Huang Xiaolong come back, the three people in the main hall bloomed into wide smiles and called out in delight, whereas Li Lu straightforwardly jumped up and ran towards Huang Xiaolong.

However, less than a meter before she reached Huang Xiaolong and wanted to hug him like she used to do, she stopped abruptly; a pink blush crept up her face and her demeanor turned shy. The long pastel green dress that she wore showed off her tiny waist and two proud peaks, painting a pretty picture that complimented her shy look.

Watching her actions, Huang Xiaolong laughed, “I heard Huang Min said you have been here for five days.”

Li Lu nodded her head shyly.

“Okay, don’t stand here and talk, let’s go back to the main hall.” Su Yan teased and laughed, “The two of you still have many opportunities to chat.”

Huang Xiaolong was still fine, but when Li Lu heard that, she turned even redder.

In these four years, Huang Peng and Su Yan’s strength had grown by a large degree.

Huang Peng was now a peak late-Seventh Order whereas Su Yan had just advanced to the Seventh Order. These years, both of them had been cultivating using the Fire Dragon Pearls Xiaolong gave them, and after undergoing the cleansing of marrows effect due to the Fire Dragon Pearls, both of them looked younger every day.

Their initial forty-something appearance became thirty-something. If Su Yan stood next to Li Lu, people would surely think they were sisters.

Back in the main hall, everyone sat down.

“Xiaolong, this time you came back, don’t rush to leave so fast.” After taking a seat, Su Yan laughed and said, “This year Li Lu will stay here and celebrate the New Year with us.”

“Not going back to Canglan County?” Huang Xiaolong was a little surprised, looked at Li Lu and asked.

Li Lu felt embarrassed with Huang Xiaolong focusing on her, and she nodded, quietly saying, “I already mentioned it to my Father and Grandfather that I’m not going back this year. I will stay here for the New Year.”

“Good ah, if Sister Li Lu stays here for the New Year, it would be even livelier!” Huang Min clapped her hands in delight, “Wait another two years, and when Sister Li Lu marries over, then she will spend every New Year here!”

Marry? The moment these words were spoken out, Li Lu’s delicate face went red faster than cooking a lobster.

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes and directed a stern stare at Huang Min but she acted as if she did not see Huang Xiaolong’s reaction and continued to smile complacently.

“Xiaolong, your little sister is right.” At this time, Su Yan quickly followed up, “In my opinion, in another two years you should marry Miss Li Lu. I tell you ah, I want Miss Li Lu this daughter-in-law, and a few years later, I want to hold my grandchildren!”

Grandchildren?

Cold sweat appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, what is this and that.

Li Lu’s face was basically bright red at this point and there wasn’t any temper due to embarrassment. Instead, in her clear bright eyes, there was happiness as she stole glances at Huang Xiaolong.

Instead, it was Huang Xiaolong was felt awkward at this moment, and he directed a pleading look towards his father Huang Peng, but Huang Peng only shrugged his shoulders indicating he had no two ways about it.

In fact, in this Martial Spirit World, marrying in in the teen years was not something out of ordinary; two years later, Huang Xiaolong and Li Li would both be seventeen.

The awkward atmosphere in the main hall did not last long as Huang Xiaohai ran in from outside. When he saw Huang Xiaolong present, he cried loudly: “Big Brother! Big Brother!”

Huang Xiaohai’s shouts broke the awkward atmosphere.

Huang Xiaohai came back and started saying that there was a martial stage competition on the south side of the city and that it was very lively and he wanted to pull Huang Xiaolong along to go with him.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong used it as an excuse and fled from the main hall.

Deep into the night, silence was all around.

The moonlight stretched Huang Xiaolong’s shadow on the ground. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Standing in the middle of his yard, Huang Xiaolong’s left leg stepped out to the left, and he lowered his body into a squat while his upper body was straight up; both hands at his waist and his lower arms were balanced as if they were holding heavy objects. Adjusting his breathing as the spiritual energy gathered around him.

Four years and Huang Xiaolong’s Body Metamorphosis Scripture had broken through to the Sixth Stage – Claw Slashing Out like Wings; the Seventh Stage –Nine Ghosts Pulling Sabers; and he had finally reached the Eighth Stage, the Three Diagrams on the Terrain. Now, he was aiming to break through the Ninth Stage soon: the Azure Dragon Stretching Out Claws.

White mist came out from Xiaolong’s nostrils while, at the same time, a white mist cloud swirled above his head, looking surreal.

On Earth, they said that an internal force expert, when adjusting their breaths, would have three flowers that would bloom above their heads, just like Huang Xiaolong now.

Night gradually gave way to daybreak.

When the morning sun came out, Huang Xiaolong finally stopped.

After he stopped, Xiaolong leaped up into the air and called out the Blades of Asura. With a swing, countless blade lights streaked out like a sea of lightning. At the same time, his body was somersaulting in midair as the lightning streaked, akin to a dragon swimming in the vast sea and the oppressive aura covered all four corners.

Four years... not only had Xiaolong practiced the Wrath of the Nether King until major completion, the fourth move, State of Abundant Lightning, had also achieved a minor completion.

The move Xiaolong had displayed just now was the State of Abundant Lightning.

In regards to the Asura Sword Skill, the moves he had practiced so far were Tempest of Hell, Tears of Asura, Wrath of the Nether King, and the fourth being State of Abundant Lightning. Each attack skill was deeply profound and had unfathomable power, and every attack was more powerful than the previous one.

This fourth move at major completion looked as if the attack transformed into countless lightning streaks, possessing the power to destroy heaven and earth.

Huang Xiaolong turned in the sky and after a dozen breaths’ time or so, he landed lightly on the ground.

When Huang Xiaolong started to learn this move, he could only stay up in the air for four breaths’ time.

With this attack of State of Abundant Lightning, the turning he made in the air was not some simple somersaults as it followed a certain rule which made it much harder.

Landing on the ground, Huang Xiaolong did not display the same move again, but he ran the Asura Tactics and his entire body was enveloped in a dark light, and a black murderous aura spread out as his hair slowly turned white and defied gravity. At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s back actually grew a pair of dark black wings!

After four years, Huang Xiaolong’s Asura Tactics had reached the fourth level and could transform into an Asura’s physique. The pair of black wings behind him was the Wings of Demon that grew after the transformation.

Spreading out, the wings could expand a width of six meters out on each side; with a flap, Huang Xiaolong flew up, reaching the average speed of a mid-Ninth Order.

Huang Xiaolong’s speed had always been on the faster side, and with the Wings of Demon, he could achieve a speed no less than a mid-Ninth Order.

Huang Xiaolong turned a few laps around the small yard: one second he was at a corner and the next moment he was up high in the air. The Wings of Demon coupled with his Phantom Shadow ability allowed Huang Xiaolong to reach a terrifying speed.

Moments later, Xiaolong ended his practice and came out from the Asura mode.

“Tomorrow is the annual competition.” Huang Xiaolong said to himself.

After he had advanced into the Second Year Class, even though he was the winner in the class competition, he had never won the year category. But, from this day onwards, he would rule the Second Years.
