Before arriving, Huang Xiaolong had thoroughly investigated the Devil World, and he had learned about the Devil Ape Cult.

The Devil Ape Cult was no pushover, and the Stone Ape Archdevil had founded them. In fact, they ranked in the top five among the powers located in the Devil World.

As for the Stone Ape Archdevil, he was one of the twelve Archdevils who had served under the Archdevil Lord in the past. Even though he wasn’t as strong as the Yellow Springs Archdevil or the Black Killer Archdevil, he wasn’t too far off.

Out of the twelve Archdevils, the Stone Ape Archdevil ranked sixth in combat prowess.

Every single one of the twelve Archdevils possessed astonishing might. Their prestige alone could surpass the rivers of time, and even though the Stone Ape Archdevil only ranked the sixth, he was already a terrifying existence.

Even though the Six Nether Gate was one of the superpowers of the Devil World, they couldn’t compare to the Devil Ape Cult. If one really tried to make the comparison, they would be comparing a firefly to the moon.

After half an hour...

Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Six Nether Headquarters, but the patrolling disciples in the area stopped him.

“This is the Six Nether Gate’s headquarters. If you don’t have an invitation, you are not allowed to go in,” one of the disciples warned.

Huang Xiaolong casually retrieved the greenish-black token given to him by Desolate Giant Tai Yue.

“Ask your Chief to come out to meet me here.” Huang Xiaolong passed the token to the disciples and ordered. It was clear he wasn’t going to waste his time explaining his purpose to a mere guard.

In an instant, all of the disciples felt their expression turning gloomy.

The disciple who had spoken to Huang Xiaolong held the token and tossed it around in his hands. Seeing that it was something he didn’t recognize, a layer of frost covered his face. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Brat, are you here to look for trouble? Who the hell are you? How dare you demand to meet with our Chief with a token you found on the ground? Do you really think you’re the young master of the Devil Ape Cult?”

“If you don’t leave, we’ll take you down right here and now. We’ll give you a taste of our soul-destroying methods and allow you to enjoy the pleasure of living in hell.” Another disciple chimed in.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. Didn’t Tai Yue say that he went to greet the Six Nether Gate’s Chief? Why do these disciples not recognize the token?

Before Huang Xiaolong could reply, a group of people mounted on beasts made their way over.

As soon as the disciples caught sight of the newcomers’ group, they ran up and kneeled on the ground in a hurry. “We greet the young master, elders, and grand elders!”

This group of people consisted of the young master of the Six Nether Gate, Gao Fan, and the various elders and grand elders.

Every year, Gao Fan would leave the Six Nether City for the Land of Devil Beasts to hunt devil beasts. He would use the chance to improve himself and take various elders and grand elders to accompany him.

After Gao Fan pardoned the disciples before him, his gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong. “What’s going on?”

The disciples didn’t dare to hide anything from Gao Fan, and they replied hastily, “Replying to Young Master, this guy brought along some random token and demanded to see the Chief. We are trying to chase him away now.”

“Brat, you had better get lost right now! It’s a crime deserving of a hundred deaths if you block our young master’s path!” The disciple who held Huang Xiaolong’s token yelled at him with a gloomy expression.

“Why are you talking so much crap from someone like that? Just throw him out!” One of the grand elders snapped.

“Hold it!” Before the disciples could do anything to Huang Xiaolong, Gao Fan seemed to have thought of something, and he hastily called out. “Bring that token to me.”

When the elders and grand elders saw Gao Fan’s reaction, they swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

No matter how suspicious and hesitant they were, none of them dared to delay and passed over the token to Gao Fan. When he accepted the token, he saw the word ‘Nether’ engraved in its center.

The word was carved with an extraordinary method, and the moment Gao Fan laid his eyes on it, a shocked expression filled his face.

His hands trembled, and he kneeled before Huang Xiaolong. “Six Nether Gate’s Young Master, Gao Fan, welcomes Lord!”

Lord?!

Everyone felt a bomb going off in their heads, and they didn’t dare to believe that Gao Fan was the one kneeling in front of a stranger.

This...?

The disciples felt as though the heavens and earth had switched places, and they had no idea what was going on. The blood drained from their faces. Even though they didn’t know who Huang Xiaolong was, they knew that his identity wasn’t whatever they had thought. Otherwise, Gao Fan wouldn’t need to kneel before him!

In fact, even someone like Gao Fan wasn’t clear on Huang Xiaolong’s identity. He had only received the news from his father that one of the bigshots from the Netherworld King’s Organization would be visiting them. He hadn’t said anything about the bigshot’s identity, and he had simply ordered Gao Fan to treat this bigshot with great respect if he ran into him.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Gao Fan and felt that it was nothing out of the ordinary.

“Get up.” Huang Xiaolong pardoned Gao Fan.

“Thank you, Lord!” Gao Fan didn’t forget to pay his respects as he returned Huang Xiaolong’s token with both hands.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he retrieved the token. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Lord, this way, please. I’ll get my father to welcome you personally!” Gao Fan said after he returned Huang Xiaolong’s token.

“There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong paused for a moment before continuing, “Let’s go in together.”

“Yes, Lord!” Gao Fan didn’t dare to disobey Huang Xiaolong’s order, and he complied immediately.

Under the Six Nether Gate’s young master’s warm welcome, Huang Xiaolong entered the Six Nether Headquarters.

Those disciples who had stopped Huang Xiaolong felt their faces go pale, and the grand elder who had ordered for him to be thrown out felt panic rising in his heart.

As for the other elders and grand elders, they looked at each other in disbelief. However, when they saw how respectfully Gao Fan was treating Huang Xiaolong, they had no choice but to follow behind the two of them.

All of them tried to guess Huang Xiaolong’s identity in their hearts.

Before Huang Xiaolong could get comfortable in his seat, a black-armored man with bushy eyebrows walked into the hall in great haste. A pretty young girl with a heroic air followed closely behind him.

“Chief!” All the elders and grand elders greeted the moment they saw the middle-aged man.

Of course, this middle-aged man was the Chief of the Six Nether Gate, Gao Changran.

“Gao Changran of the Six Nether Gate greets the Lord. I failed to welcome you personally, but I hope the Lord will forgive me!” Gao Changran didn’t bother about the rest, and he headed straight for Huang Xiaolong. He kneeled on the ground and greeted respectfully.

“Gao Mengyao of the Six Nether Gate greets Lord.” The pretty lady who followed behind Gao Changran got to her knees and greeted Huang Xiaolong.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong knew that Gao Mengyao was Gao Changran’s daughter. He also knew that she had a supreme talent for cultivation. She wasn’t just an expert in the Six Nether Gate’s younger generation, but she was also famed as one of strongest experts of the younger generation of Frigid North City.

“All of you can rise,” said Huang Xiaolong.

They only dared to rise to their feet after Huang Xiaolong’s order.
