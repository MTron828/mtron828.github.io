When Huang Xiaolong was rushing back to the Fortune Emperor Palace, Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao were smashing against the barrier of light before them with all their might.

No matter how they tried, the barrier rebounded all their attack.

After an hour, the two of them couldn’t help but stop.

“Old dog Zhou Chen, you better let us out right now!” Fang Xuanxuan yelled at the top of her lungs.

Since the day Fang Gan had disappeared, Zhou Chen had usurped the throne and trapped the two ladies in the restriction.

It was a restriction Zhou Chen had laid out personally.

No matter how Fang Xuanxuan screamed, the guards all around them didn’t bother to reply and remained motionless.

“Xuanxuan, there’s no use.” Peng Xiao shook her head, and a trace of sadness filled her eyes. “I wonder how his training in Hell is going... I hope he doesn’t come back.”

Of course, the person she was referring to was Huang Xiaolong.

Fang Xuanxuan spat bitterly, “D*mn! That old dog Zhou Chen...! I can’t wait to cut off all his flesh as punishment. My father’s disappearance definitely has something to do with him!”

The reason used by Zhou Chen to capture the two of them was a complete b*llshit. He had accused Huang Xiaolong of colluding with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe and imprisoned the two ladies because they had a good relationship with him. It seemed like Zhou Chen was afraid they would tell Huang Xiaolong everything that had happened in the Fortune Emperor Palace.

It was complete nonsense!

However, Fang Xuanxuan’s eyes showed a trace of warmth when she thought about Huang Xiaolong. “That’s right... I wonder how he’s doing now. The day of the Battle of the Heavenly Court is drawing near... I’m afraid he’s rushing back as we speak.” When she thought about how Huang Xiaolong was making his way back to the Fortune Emperor Palace, a worried expression appeared on her face.

“If he comes back, he’ll be in trouble...” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhou Chen had already sent out a bounty to capture Huang Xiaolong. If he came back by himself, wouldn’t he be giving himself up?

“We have no way of informing him!” Peng Xiao said anxiously.

All of a sudden, the sound of footsteps entered their ears.

“It seems like your love for him is really deep. How can you still think of that brat right now?” A cold sneer resounded in the air.

When the two ladies turned around, they almost erupted with rage.

The people standing before them were precisely Zhou Chen and Sun Shihai. Of course, the person speaking to them was none other than Sun Shihai.

Sun Shihai’s expression was gloomy. He couldn’t think of how Huang Xiaolong was better than him to receive the love of so many women!

Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and even Bei Xiaomei from the Silver Fox Commerce were head over heels for him!

It was a pity. Everyone knew that he had a thing for Peng Xiao.

However, Peng Xiao didn’t even bother sparing him a glance.

B*tch!

Sun Shihai’s expression turned uglier the more he thought about it.

“Zhou Chen, you old dog! You definitely did something to cause my father to disappear! What happened to him?!” Fang Xuanxuan raged.

Zhou Chen chuckled. “Xuanxuan, you must be kidding. How can I cause your father to disappear? How would I know how he is doing now? I, Zhou Chen, am loyal to the Fortune Emperor Palace. I served your father for so many years, and everything I did was for the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Hearing Zhou Chen’s crap, Fang Xuanxuan raged again. “Zhou Chen, stop pretending...”

Zhou Chen didn’t get angry when he heard her. Instead, he looked at Peng Xiao and said, “Peng Xiao, why are you causing yourself to suffer? Your master and I are anxiously waiting for you to marry Sun Shihai. After all, Shihai only has you in his heart. As long as you agree, we will release you and carry out the ceremony immediately.”

“You must be dreaming.”

She had never thought that her master would be standing on Zhou Chen’s side. When she thought of how her master supported Zhou Chen to be the next master of the Fortune Emperor Palace and was now forcing her to marry Sun Shihai, her anger peaked.

Sun Shihai no longer held his rage back when he heard that she wouldn’t be with him. “Peng Xiao, stop being shameless! How is Huang Xiaolong better than me?”

Peng Xiao merely laughed and looked at Sun Shihai with a mocking gaze. “You can’t even be compared to him.”

Dense killing intent welled up in Sun Shihai’s eyes, and a furious sneer left his lips. “Fine. Since that is the case, I shall personally take him down the moment he comes back. I shall cut him piece by piece before your very eyes, and I will force you to kneel before me to beg me to take you as my woman.”

“You’re shameless! You’re less than a beast!”

Sun Shihai roared with maniacal laughter, “Huang Xiaolong is shameless as well. He’s nothing more than a beast! Why else would all of you sluts gather around him?”

Looking at the crazed Sun Shihai, Zhou Chen frowned and raised his hand to interrupt. “Alright enough.”

“Fang Xuanxuan, I shall tell you some good news.” Zhou Chen suddenly addressed the ladies in front of them. “Huang Xiaolong is back. We just received news that he appeared on the Brimming Snow World and his subordinates killed Chen Zhao of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace.”

Since no one managed to live to tell the tale, everyone felt that it was the four odd beasts following behind Huang Xiaolong that did the deed.

“What?! His subordinates killed Chen Zhao?!” The two ladies felt their world start to spin.

“Right now, even if I let him off, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace won’t.”

“Oh, right. I don’t even know if this is a piece of good news or bad news for you.”

Zhou Chen laughed and left with Sun Shihai in tow.

Three days passed.

Huang Xiaolong finally appeared before the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Looking at the densely packed palaces, Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he brought the four beasts into the Fortune Emperor Palace.

The moment he entered the area, he ran into several disciples of the Fortune Emperor Palace.

The people who were patrolling the area were precisely the disciples from the Snow Moon Hall.

Since he saw them, Huang Xiaolong immediately thought of that old b*stard, Zhou Chen.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong!” One of the disciples noticed him as well, and a look of joy appeared on his face. He yelled at the top of his lungs, “Huang Xiaolong is back! Quick! Seal the space, and don’t allow him to escape!”

“Capture him! We’ll be able to claim the reward of two hundred thousand low-grade chaos spirit stones as well!” As though the disciple had already seen the mountain of spirit stones before him, he yelled before charging towards Huang Xiaolong as quickly as he could.

The lead disciple from the Snow Moon Hall in charge of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s security wasn’t weak. He was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order God King Realm. He was one of the core disciples of the Fortune Emperor Palace, and his strength was ranked third among the other core disciples.

Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled before reaching out to grab the space before him. A formless arm squeezed the disciple charging towards him, and a ‘pop’ was heard as he turned into a mist of blood.
