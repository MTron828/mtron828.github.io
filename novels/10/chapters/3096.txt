Chapter 3097: Hard Pressed to Escape

Half a month later…

Huang Xiaolong set off for the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch in the Origin Heavenly Cave.

The peak powers in the Origin Heavenly Cave quickly received the news, and that included superpowers like the World Master’s Manor and the Ice Orchid Chamber of Commerce.

In the World Master’s Manor…

Xiao Yuncheng, the Origin Prince, sat before the four marshals.

A look of joy formed on Jiang Meng’s face. “Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong would dare to head over?! Wangu Xu is definitely plotting against him. Heh, Huang Xiaolong is royally f*cked this time!”

Yang Yuyuan couldn’t help but chuckle in amusement. “He might have brought the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable with him along with Lei Yu, but there’s no way for him to escape! As long as the Mystical Pavilion activates its grand formation, only an expert in the top ten ranks of the Extermination List would be able to escape!”

“Moreover, I’ve heard that Lord San Song of the main branch is there to hold the fort!”

When the other marshals heard what Yang Yuyuan said, their expressions changed. Even Xiao Yuncheng couldn’t believe his ears.

Lord San Song was an expert ranked sixth on the Extermination List!

He had reached the grand completion stage in the powers of radiance, absolute blaze, and absolute earth!

“Lord San Song actually appeared personally?!” Murong Xiang gasped in shock. “Hasn’t he been cultivating in seclusion for several million years? I’ve heard that he managed to obtain some sort of great opportunity and has been cultivating silently in the headquarters of the Mystical Pavilion! Now that he has left seclusion, he should be stronger than before!”

Jiang Meng was stunned for a second, but he nearly jumped in joy the next moment. “Who would have thought that Lord San Song would personally move against Huang Xiaolong. Hehe, dumb*ss… Why would he announce that he is in possession of the Pure Soil?! Even the Mystical Pavilion can’t hold themselves back!”

Yang Yuyuan smiled. “There are rumors going around that Huang Xiaolong has more than a million grains of Pure Soil. It’s no wonder the Mystical Pavilion would be tempted to move against him. Huang Xiaolong might be protected by a ton of experts, but the Mystical Pavilion isn’t afraid of him!”

Xiao Yuncheng and Xuan Kong didn’t speak a word from the start to the end.

Lord San Song?

Lord San Song might be strong, but the only thing they could think of was the terrifying abilities Huang Xiaolong had displayed back then.

“Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong and the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable wouldn’t be able to get out of their predicament. Without the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, the Wind Cloud Chamber of Commerce will be a headless snake. It’s a big juicy piece of meat ready for the taking!” Jiang Meng roared with laughter. “Why don’t we make the first move before anyone else does?”

As soon as the words left Jiang Meng’s lips, Xiao Yuncheng got to his feet and raged, “Jiang Meng, if you’re tired of living, don’t drag our World Master’s Manor into it!”

Xiao Yuncheng’s voice resounded through the hall.

When Yang Yuyuan and the others saw how hard Xiao Yuncheng raged, they couldn’t help but widen their eyes in shock. As long as they could remember, Xiao Yuncheng had never expressed his emotions so openly. Moreover, Jiang Meng was a marshal of the World Master’s Manor, and he was ranked second out of the four great marshals! He was ranked in the top forties on the Extermination List, and as the Origin Prince, Xiao Yuncheng had to show some respect to the man! Who would have thought that he would openly rage at him!

No one expected for Xiao Yuncheng to get so worked up.

Xuan Kong coughed dryly and shattered the awkward atmosphere. “Huang Xiaolong isn’t as simple as he seems.”

Staring at Yang Yuyuan and the others, Xiao Yuncheng snorted, “Whatever the case, all of you better show some respect when you meet Huang Xiaolong in the future. If you anger him, my father might not be able to save you.”

Even though he swore never to speak of the matter in the Golden Flame Sandy Land, he felt that he had to warn the delusional marshals who were planning to move against a monster like that.

“Don’t do anything stupid.” After he spoke, Xiao Yuncheng left the hall.

Xuan Kong followed behind the prince, and he left behind him.

Yang Yuyuan, Jiang Meng, Murong Xiang, and Duanmu Guang stared their leaving figures and had no idea how to respond.

Staring at each other silently, a frown formed on their faces.

“Seems like His Highness knows something about Huang Xiaolong we don’t. Otherwise he wouldn’t forbid us from doing anything.” Murong Xiang sighed.

Jiang Meng thought about how Xiao Yuncheng had scolded him and his expression sank. “He’s just making a mountain out of a molehill. How can Huang Xiaolong be even more terrifying than the World Master? Who the hell does he think he is? Is Huang Xiaolong’s background stronger than the World Master’s Manor?!”

A sneer formed on his face. “Don’t tell me Huang Xiaolong’s background is even more terrifying than the Mystical Pavilion…”

Duanmu Guang followed up, “I feel that His Highness is exaggerating.”

It was clear none of them believed that Huang Xiaolong’s backer would be stronger than the Mystical Pavilion.

Yang Yuyuan was also unable to think of anything. He couldn’t understand why Xiao Yuncheng would speak up for Huang Xiaolong. The more he thought, the more confused he felt.

…

In the Tyrant Beast Creed, Liu Qiuan roared with laughter when he heard that Huang Xiaolong was heading over to the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch.

“Lord patriarch, do you think the Mystical Pavilion will move against Huang Xiaolong?” one of the eminent elders couldn’t help but ask.

Looking at everyone present, Liu Qiuan muttered, “All of you are eminent elders from the Tyrant Beast Creed, and I won’t doubt your loyalty. Let me tell you a secret. I’ve contacted Eminent Elder Mu Guang. The news is definitely true. They will most definitely be making a move on Huang Xiaolong, and the ones behind the scheme are from the main branch of the Mystical Pavilion!”

“Even the main branch of the Mystical Pavilion stepped in!” The doyens gasped in shock.

Liu Qiuan continued, “That’s right. Lord San Song from the headquarters of the Mystical Pavilion came personally to deal with Huang Xiaolong! He would be hard-pressed to escape this time!”

Hearing San Song’s name, everyone sucked in another deep breath.

“All of you shouldn’t spread the news and ruin the Mystical Pavilion’s plan! I believe all of you are clear on the consequences of betrayal!” Liu Qiuan growled.

Nodding solemnly, everyone felt excitement bubbling in their hearts.

“Get the flying ship ready! All of you shall head over to support the Mystical Pavilion!”

“Yes, Lord Patriarch!”

The Tyrant Beast Creed weren’t the only ones. Many experts rushed over to the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch after hearing the news.

Several dozen days later, Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at the Limitless Sacred Land where the branch was located. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“It’s pretty lively here.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the number of flying ships in the air.

“Everyone likes a good show.” Lei Yu laughed. “It’s too bad there are too little ladies here…”

“Hehe, your goddess might be somewhere among them.”

As soon as the words left Huang Xiaolong’s lips, Lei Yu started to look around.

Amidst the laughter, Huang Xiaolong’s group went straight to the heart of the Limitless City.
