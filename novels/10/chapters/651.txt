The Ascending Moon Old Man nodded, saying, “That’s right, the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition. This competition is jointly held by the four galaxies’ super forces, a grand event for the four galaxies that is held once every three thousand years.”

But Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “I’m not interested in this so-called Alchemist Grandmaster Competition.”

It was the truth, Huang Xiaolong’s interest in alchemy had always been tepid. To the current him, increasing his strength was the most important matter in order to prepare for the next Highgod Advancement Tournament. Winning the first place in the Highgod Advancement Tournament was Huang Xiaolong’s goal.

The Ascending Moon Old Man didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to directly say he wasn’t interested, the old man was stunned for a moment before flaring up in anger, “What did you say? All you know is fart! What do you mean not interested? It is already worth a lifetime’s honor being able to participate in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, not to mention winning the first place! That’s an Alchemist Grandmaster’s most glorious moment! Glory, do you understand? Do you understand at all?!” The Ascending Moon Old Man was staring at Huang Xiaolong like a clump of iron that couldn’t turn into steel [1].

For someone obsessed with alchemy like the Ascending Moon Old Man, someone who spent most of his life on refining pills, an alchemy competition organized jointly by the four galaxies was extremely important. Winning the first place in a competition of this scale was an alchemist’s highest honor and glory!

Yet, Huang Xiaolong actually said that he had no interest, one could imagine how angry the Ascending Moon Old Man was.

Huang Xiaolong did not expect the Ascending Moon Old Man to have such a big reaction. He was feeling a little helpless, however, he had learned not to interject when the old man was in this mode, it was best let the old man vent. Otherwise, once Huang Xiaolong spoke, it would trigger the old man even more.

Close to a quarter of an hour later, the Ascending Moon Old Man finally stopped. Staring at Huang Xiaolong, who appeared like an old monk in deep meditation, the old man’s face suddenly split into a wide grin, “Brat, I’ll have you know that the reward for each term’s Alchemist Grandmaster Competition is extremely attractive; the first place winner will receive three thousand Exalted Divinity Pellets. This is the current number one sacred grade divine pill in all four galaxies, and other than three thousand Exalted Divinity Pellets, there is also a sacred grade divine furnace, three thousand top sacred grade spirit stones, and three thousand kinds of herbs and elixirs aged one million and above!”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. The first place winner of this Alchemist Grandmaster Competition would actually receive three thousand Exalted Divinity Pellets!

Wasn’t this amount a bit too shocking?

It was said that consuming one Exalted Divinity Pellet could significantly increase one’s strength, remold their physical body, as well as purify their soul. According to rumors, if there was a sufficient amount of Exalted Divinity Pellets, it could even greatly increases a Tenth Order God Realm master’s possibility of advancing to the Highgod Realm.

This was also the reason why the Exalted Divinity Pellet was ranked first among the other sacred grade divine pellets in the four galaxies.

Other than three thousand Exalted Divinity Pellets, there was also sacred grade divine furnace, three thousand top sacred grade spirit stones, and those three thousand herbs surpassing a million years in age! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Each reward item was astounding on its own.

Incorporating the Five-colored Divine Banner into the Golden Dragon Peak required Huang Xiaolong to supply it with one hundred sacred grade spirit stones every ten years. In fifty years, Huang Xiaolong’s supply of sacred grade spirit stones would have deteriorated to nothing, therefore, those three thousand sacred grade spirit stones were quite important to Huang Xiaolong as well.

Noticing the slight changes in Huang Xiaolong’s expression, the Ascending Moon Old Man knew that his little disciple was tempted. Laughingly, he added, “How is it, brat, are you interested now? I also heard that, other than the rewards I mentioned, this term’s competition rewards may even include a godhead!”

“What? A godhead?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

Were the people behind this Alchemist Grandmaster Competition mad? Actually taking out a godhead as a reward! Although these rewards couldn’t compare to the rewards of the Highgod Advancement Tournament, it was still shocking.

Huang Xiaolong clearly understood how precious a godhead was.

The Ascending Moon Old Man was very satisfied with Huang Xiaolong’s shocked reaction at this moment, “There’s no mistake, a godhead. Moreover, it is most likely a rank six godhead, just a tiny bit better than the one I gave you.”

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a breath of cold air; it was actually a rank six godhead!

The Ascending Moon Old Man continued, “In this world, do you know what people are the richest? Let me tell you, it’s none other than Alchemist Grandmasters! That is the reason why the rewards for the competition are so generous, it’s actually very common. Every term competition’s rewards are prepared by the Alchemist Grandmaster Association.”

“Alchemist Grandmaster Association?” Huang Xiaolong repeated the name. Due to his lack of interest toward alchemy, he rarely paid any attention to matters related to it. This was the first time he heard about the Alchemist Grandmaster Association.

When the Ascending Moon Old Man heard that Huang Xiaolong had never heard of the Alchemist Grandmaster Association, his anger erupted, roaring at the top of his lungs, “You have never heard of the Alchemist Grandmaster Association?! How can Feng Yang, that boy, become someone’s Master? In the future, never tell anyone that you are my, this Ascending Moon Old Man’s disciple!”

Huang Xiaolong’s lips flattened; it was you, old man, who wanted to take me as your personal disciple no matter what.

Then again, after worshipping the Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang as Master, he didn’t really teach Huang Xiaolong much. But Huang Xiaolong knew that it wasn’t because Feng Yang was unwilling to teach, it was he himself that chose to cultivate according to his own method, and in fact, Huang Xiaolong’s method of cultivation helped increase his strength faster.

‘It seems like I need to make more trips to Master’s place in the future.’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Initially, agreeing to worship Feng Yang as his Master was because Huang Xiaolong wanted to borrow Feng Yang’s reputation as a layer of protection, he had never thought of wanting Feng Yang to guide his cultivation.

After the Ascending Moon Old Man vented his anger, he began explaining matters related to the Alchemist Grandmaster Association to Huang Xiaolong, as well as the alchemy competition. Only now did Huang Xiaolong learn something about the Alchemist Grandmaster Association.

Within the galaxy, anyone that could refine a sacred grade divine pellet was qualified to join the Alchemist Grandmaster Association, but the alchemists within the association were divided by ranks.

The lowest being Novice Alchemist, Intermediary Alchemist, followed by Alchemist Master, then Alchemist Grandmaster, and above that were the Special Rank Alchemist Grandmasters.

What Huang Xiaolong did not expect was the fact that this Ascending Moon Old Man was actually the Alchemist Grandmaster Association’s only Special Rank Alchemist Grandmaster!

Special Rank!

Mentioning his own Special Rank Alchemist Grandmaster status, the Ascending Moon Old Man was akin to a proud peacock spreading its feathers, “See, your Big Master is powerful, right? Haha, it’s not that this old man is trying to brag, but when it comes to alchemy, in the four galaxies, if this old man said he’s second, no one would dare to claim they’re number one!”

Huang Xiaolong curled his lips.

“Old man, if you participate, you can definitely win the first place, why don’t you compete?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The Ascending Moon Old Man fumed, “You think I don’t want to participate? But, sixty thousand years ago, I participated for one term and won the first place. The Alchemist Grandmaster Association has a rule, those who have participated and won any of the top three spots are not allowed to participate in future competitions.”

Huang Xiaolong finally understood, but then again, it made sense. If the Ascending Moon Old Man participated in every term, wouldn’t every term’s winner be only him?

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong asked about the deadline for the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition. Knowing it was twenty-five years later, Huang Xiaolong breathed out in relief.

Having twenty-five years’ time to prepare and the Ascending Moon Old Man’s guidance, Huang Xiaolong still had some confidence of winning the first place.

By the time he returned to his own yard from the Ascending Moon Old Man’s place, it was already deep into the night. Huang Xiaolong entered the Godly Mt. Xumi and took out the godhead that the old man gave him, feeling excited. With this rank five godhead, before taking part in the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, he should be able to breakthrough to Seventh Order God Realm.

Sitting cross-legged at the center of the Xumi Temple, he began circulating the Asura Tactics to refine the godforce and God’s Law contained inside the godhead.
