Although no more words came from Wangu Zhi, how could the group of Wangu Clan Elders fail to detect the underlying meaning?

Fang Chu was killed by Huang Xiaolong!

Otherwise, it couldn’t explain Huang Xiaolong’s sudden jump from the eighth place all the way to the first!

Wangu Yuan, who had just said that Huang Xiaolong would definitely be kicked out from the top ten and probably rank around fifteenth place when the tournament ends, inevitably revealed a wry smile, “Looks like I’ve underestimated this Huang Xiaolong ah.”

Wangu Changqing also sighed, “All of us had underestimated this Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought he has the ability to kill Fang Chu?”

“Although Fang Chu’s strength was far from Wangu Yanhui’s, he’s still an early Fourth Order Highgod Realm.” Wangu Shuo stated solemnly, “Judging from the fact that this Huang Xiaolong could kill him, I’m afraid he has the strength of a peak mid-Fourth Order Highgod Realm master at the very least, perhaps even a late-Fourth Order!”

These Wangu Clan Elders didn’t know that Fang Chu had hidden his true cultivation realm and assumed that he was just an early Fourth Order Highgod Realm disciple.

Wangu Zhi nodded in agreement, “This Huang Xiaolong, I wonder how many years he had been cultivating for. Is it one thousand eight hundred years, or closer to two thousand years? To possess such strength, truly astonishing!”

While the crowd on the Aeon Square was fervently talking about Huang Xiaolong taking the first place with shock vibrating in their hearts, far away across an unknown number of galaxies, back in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, Wang Na was leaning leisurely in her seat inside the Wuhuang Peak’s luxurious hall within the Black Warrior Institute grounds, enjoying some fragrant tea brewed from high quality Heavenly Mountain tea leaves.

These days, Wang Na had been in an excellent mood.

As the day of the new Black Warrior Institute Principal Instalment Ceremony drew closer, more and more of the institute’s Grand Elders and Elders had professed loyalty towards her.

“There’s only a little over a month left until the Highgod Advancement Tournament ends, right?” Wang Na lazily glanced at the person standing several steps lower, Grand Elder He Zhiwu.

“That is so, Institute Principal.” He Zhiwu took a small step forward, respectfully answering Wang Na.

Although the installment ceremony had yet to take place, He Zhiwu and the others already greeted Wang Na as the ‘Institute Principal’. In these people’s opinion, Wang Na succeeding the position of Black Warrior Institute Principal was a certainty.

Wang Na wondered out loud, “I wonder how the tournament ranking is like...”

Due to the great distance between the Eternal Galaxy and Black Tortoise Galaxy, news of the latest changes on the ranking list couldn’t be transferred to them in a short time, hence, Wang Na and the others were still ignorant of the tournament’s final ranking result.

“Institute Principal can rest assured a thousand times. Since the Great Lord is going to deal with him personally, that Huang Xiaolong is dead for sure!” He Zhiwu wore a flattering smile, continuing, “Moreover, I found out that Huang Xiaolong had previously offended some Yelu Family’s disciples, who definitely won’t let him off, he’s most likely already dead.”

There were undisguised hatred and resentment in Wang Na’s eyes, “It’s a pity that I cannot kill Huang Xiaolong that dog with my own hands!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He Zhiwu laughed, “Although Huang Xiaolong’s dead, there’s still the Huang Family. When the time comes, I will capture and bring these people alive in front of Institute Principal, so that you can vent and deal with them accordingly.”

Wang Na nodded with satisfaction.

“Institute Principal, in truth, we need not wait for Feng Yang’s return to proceed with the installment ceremony.” Grand Elder He Fei suddenly said.

Wang Na was tempted, “Your meaning is?”

“According to the established rules, the time for the installment ceremony has already passed, therefore, even if Institute Principal decides to have the ceremony tomorrow, Feng Yang has no valid reason to condemn you when he returns.” He Fei added, “And Feng Yang, in order to watch his personal disciple’s performance in the tournament, left the institute and even the Black Tortoise Galaxy for a prolonged period and did not rush back to conduct the installment ceremony as expected of an Institute Principal. When he returns, Institute Principal can use this as a reason to punish him.”

Wang Na’s eyes lit up, nearly clapping her hands, shouting: “Excellent! Immediately pass my orders, invite all the prominent forces of the Black Tortoise Galaxy to attend the installment ceremony one month later, all Ancestors and Patriarchs must be invited!”

“Yes, Institute Principal!”

The present Grand Elders respectfully acknowledged.

...

At the same time in the Overflowing Lightning World, Huang Xiaolong watched Fang Chu tumble lifelessly to the floor. His Archdevil Supreme Godhead immediately began devouring Fang Chu’s blood essence and fortune energy, roiling like waves into his body.

Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded in a cocoon of glimmering bright light as Fang Chu’s corpse was shrinking at a visible rate.

In less than a dozen breaths, Fang Chu’s body had completely turned into a dried corpse.

A few minutes later, Fang Chu’s close to a thousand li in diameter Fortune Godhead exploded into sparkling dust, disappeared in the air. Every last strand of fortune energy within Fang Chu’s godhead was absorbed by Huang Xiaolong, helping him step into peak late-Second order Highgod Realm, infinitely close to breaking through to Third Order Highgod Realm.

Looking at the dried corpse, Huang Xiaolong flicked a sliver of fire element godforce onto it, completely burning away the last of Fang Chu’s body.

Only then did he spare a glance at the four people, Wangu Yanhui, Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei, lying in different corners.

Although they all suffered from Fang Chu’s attack and were subjected to intense battle shockwaves created by Huang Xiaolong and Fang Chu’s battle, these four people were still alive. They were merely unconscious, which was easily remedied after Huang Xiaolong fed each of them an Undying God Pill.

Waking up, the four of them looked around the miserable ruined hall, but saw was no sign of Fang Chu.

“Huang, Big bro Huang Xiaolong, where’s that Fang Chu? Is he, you...?” Mu Qi couldn’t help asking, a little hesitant.

Huang Xiaolong almost laughed hearing Mu Qi calling him ‘Big bro.’ He answered Mu Qi’s question, “That’s right, Fang Chu has been killed by me.”

Obtaining Huang Xiaolong’s confirmation that he had indeed killed Fang Chu, Wangu Yanhui, Mu Qi, You Wuye, and Lu Dongwei’s hearts shuddered, their eyes big as fists staring at Huang Xiaolong.

They did not forget that Fang Chu was actually a Fifth Order Highgod Realm master, yet he was still killed by Huang Xiaolong!

Then... what was Huang Xiaolong’s real strength?!

The four of them felt short of breath.

It didn’t take long for them to notice the changes on the ranking list; Fang Chu’s name had disappeared, and Huang Xiaolong had climbed to the top spot!

Ignoring the four, Huang Xiaolong turned his attention toward the giant Lightning God corpse still unaffected high in the air. Despite the earth-shattering battle from earlier, the Lightning God’s corpse didn’t suffer the slightest damage. With a wave of his hand, that Lightning God corpse and the giant divine lightning hammer beside it flew into his Asura Ring.

Wangu Yanhui and the other three could only watch Huang Xiaolong take away the Lightning God’s corpse and the divine lightning hammer, not one of them dared to speak a word.

The five-footed divine cauldron at the center of the hall also entered Huang Xiaolong’s Asura Ring. However, he only took a third of the pills placed on the drawers in the four corners of the hall, leaving the rest to be equally divided amongst the four people.

Naturally, the four of them had no complaints, and in fact were grateful to Huang Xiaolong. These were pills refined by a Heavenly God master, every single pill was extremely valuable.

After collecting and dividing the pills inside the hall, they used the five keys to activate the central formation again, leaving the hall.

After leaving the hall, Wangu Yanhui, Mu Qi, and Lu Dongwei bid farewell to Huang Xiaolong and left, leaving their part of the key to Huang Xiaolong.

When the three of them disappeared from view, Huang Xiaolong turned and ordered You Wuye to be on guard. You Wuye acknowledged respectfully, while Huang Xiaolong himself entered the deepest underground space of the Lightning God’s cultivation dwelling using the five keys.

Here, at the deepest underground section of the Lightning God’s cultivation dwelling, laid a spiritual vein that resembled a giant lightning dragon with a length of several hundred li!
