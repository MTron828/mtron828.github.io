Chapter 3123: Origin Sea

Originally, Xiao Tianqi wanted to hold a banquet for Huang Xiaolong, but he was rejected.

That night, as silvery moonlight descended on the lands…

Huang Xiaolong played around with the ring in his hands.

He didn’t expect that even the nine beast kings would have no idea what the ring was used for. From their memories, Huang Xiaolong learned that only the leader of the ten beast kings of the Death Beasts Peril Land had any idea what the ring could do.

As for the leader of the beast kings, he headed to the Origin Lands and hadn’t been back in a long time.

The name of the leader was Di Shuang, and he wielded six elements of absolute power. Four of them were at perfection level, and his power of darkness was at the peak of major completion stage. It was as close to perfection level as he could get, and the reason he went to Origin Lands was to break through the bottleneck and reach perfection level in five different elements.

Retrieving the mysterious ring in his hand, Huang Xiaolong no longer dwelled on the matter.

For the next few days, Huang Xiaolong remained in the World Master’s Manor, and he spoke to Xiao Tianqi about the matters of the Origin Holy World. There were secrets the Wind Cloud Dao Venerable, He Zhen, San Song, and the others might not know, but Xiao Tianqi was the World Master of the Origin Holy World. He knew a lot of information hidden from the rest!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask about the Tree of Origin.

“I can guess that the Tree of Origin is hidden in the depths of the Origin Sea…” Xiao Tianqi muttered.

“Origin Sea?!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked. From what Xiao Tianqi said, the Tree of Origin might really be present in the Origin Sea!

“That’s right. The origin qi obtained by the Mystical Pavilion mostly came from the Origin Sea!”

Even the upper echelon of the Mysticla Pavilion, like San Song and Wangu Xu, had no idea that was the case! The reason Xiao Tianqi could learn of the secret was because he had used a ton of resources and effort to dig up everything he could about the Mystical Pavilion.

“Origin Sea…” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath.

The Origin Sea was located at the very edge of the Origin Lands, and there were some who said that the Origin Sea was the edge of the Huang Long World.

No one could ever prove the fact as no one had the ability to cross the Origin Sea!

“Is it possible that one would need to control all thirteen elements before crossing the Origin Sea?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Xiao Tianqi shook his head. “I have no idea. I am only able to enter the outer perimeter of the Origin Sea. With Your Highness’ bloodline, you might be able to cross the entire sea if you master ten elements and activate your Huang Long Bloodline! However, that’s just my speculation!”

Ten different elements!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel a sense of apprehension appearing in his heart.

Soon after, he asked about the matters regarding the Mystical Pavilion and the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion.

Despite his identity as the World Master, Xiao Tianqi had no idea where the headquarters of the Mystical Pavilion was. As for the Main Pavilion Master, Xiao Tianqi’s expression turned serious when he spoke about the individual. “In the past, I fought with someone from the headquarters of the Mystical Pavilion. His strength was unfathomable but other than the power of nirvana, radiance, darkness, and poison, he didn’t reveal anything else. Moreover, all four powers were at perfection level!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

The power of nirvana, radiance, darkness, and poison at perfection level!

Other than the power of space and time, those were the four strongest elements! Who would have thought that the other party would reach perfection level in all four of them?

Moreover, the most terrifying thing was that Xiao Tianqi couldn’t ascertain the other party’s identity!

From the power Xiao Tianqi’s opponent exposed, he was sure to possess other types of elements at his disposal!

“Are you unable to confirm the identity of the other person?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

Nodding his head slowly, Xiao Tianqi sighed, “That’s right. I have never seen the Main Pavilion Master of the Mystical Pavilion, and the only person who might know the face of the Main Pavilion Master would be the Son of Mystic. When I fought with the other party previously, darkness shielded their facial features.” A light flashed through Xiao Tianqi’s eyes as he continued, “If he’s not the Main Pavilion Master, the Mystical Pavilion is more terrifying than we thought!”

If that was the case, the Mystical Pavilion would possess more than a single monster among their roster!

Huang Xiaolong changed his direction of questioning and asked about Huang Shuai.

Shaking his head apologetically, Xiao Tianqi hadn’t even heard of the name.

With a mysterious light flashing through his eyes, Huang Xiaolong thought about how secretive the Mystical Pavilion was acting. It seemed as though they were pretty serious about hiding Huang Shuai. After all, even Xiao Tianqi couldn’t obtain any news of the man.

Several days later, Huang Xiaolong left Origin Heavenly Cave, and he headed straight for the Heavens Burial Lands.

Since his father was injured in the past at the exact same place, he had to figure out what was going on.

However, he failed to discover anything even after several years of searching.

By the time he returned, he asked Xiao Tianqi to continue the search for Huang Shuai before entering seclusion. Since Xiao Tianqi said that the Tree of Origin might be located in the depths of the Origin Sea, he would have to be strong enough to venture into the area!

After all, the Tree of Origin was extremely important to him! With the tree, he would be able to successfully comprehend all thirteen elements! He would increase his cultivation speed to a whole new level!

As such, he planned to comprehend ten different elements before emerging from seclusion! When that happened, he would then enter the Origin Lands!

Even though he had the Huang Long Bloodline, comprehending ten out of thirteen elements was easier said than done. Once he did, the Huang Long Armor and Huang Long Twin Blades would come in really handy when he planned to explore the Origin Sea in the future as the power they could unleash was proportional with Huang Xiaolong's own strength!

When he entered seclusion, he managed to bring the power of absolute blaze to the edge of the major completion stage. With the Phoenix Fire Crystals he had, he hoped that he could push it up to perfection level in one go! When he achieved perfection level in five different elements, his strength would take a huge leap forward.

In the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong sat on a bed of Pure Soil, and he refined one peak-grade Phoenix Fire Crystal after another. Scarlet light surrounded his body, and they formed a sea of red around him.

In the past, he had obtained the treasure of the Mystical Pavilion’s Branch in the Origin Heavenly Cave. There were several dozen Phoenix Fire Crystals there, and after the heaven-shaking battle with the nine beast kings, Huang Xiaolong used Xiao Tianqi’s authority to obtain even more of them! Right now, he had a little more than a hundred of them, and it was more than enough for him to refine for a period of time.

Other than the Phoenix Fire Crystal, Huang Xiaolong had a lot of Dazzling Gold Stone, Profound Concentrated Earth, and Liquid of Life. It was especially so for the Dazzling Gold Stone and the Liquid of Life. He had a ton of them.

As such, Huang Xiaolong was pretty confident he could comprehend two more elements during his seclusion. Others might find comprehending two different types of elements daunting, but Huang Xiaolong had the Huang Long Bloodline, and he felt that it wasn’t going to be too difficult.

In the blink of an eye, four hundred years passed.

Since the news of the nine beast kings and the Black and White Dao Venerable submitting to Huang Xiaolong spread through the Origin Holy World, there had been countless factions entering the World Master’s Manor to pledge their allegiance.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation wasn’t to be interrupted, and the World Master stopped all of them from meeting the Son of Creation.

Even though they were unable to meet Huang Xiaolong, the patriarchs of the various factions remained in the Origin Heavenly Cave. They wanted to wait for Huang Xiaolong to leave seclusion.

Two hundred more years passed, and a pillar of light finally emerged from the depths of the World Master’s Manor. A dragon’s roar shook the skies, and a terrifying pressure descended on the lands.

Xiao Tianqi and the various region masters who were present gasped in shock.
