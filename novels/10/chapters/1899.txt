Lu Xiaoqing was dumbfounded, looking at the endless stream of chaos lightning qi pouring out from Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows. Does this work?

At that moment, she finally understood Huang Xiaolong’s method.

Huang Xiaolong forcefully circulated the Black Tortoise Lightning Pool and Blue Wood Lightning Pool to the maximum.

After he urged the two lightning pools, black tortoises and blue wood qi penetrated the ground and raised hell.

Although the earth-essence energy made the ground of the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range tough and strong even for Second-Order Emperors to break it, Huang Xiaolong could do it with ease.

The Black Tortoise Lightning Pool was of the water element, and it could completely penetrate through the soil. The Blue Wood Lightning Pool was of the wood element, and they worked well together.

As the two different attributed qi penetrated the ground, rumbling sounds came from under the earth.

Merely two minutes passed before Lu Xiaoqing saw something break through the ground. A blood-red shadow shot into the sky.

Lu Xiaoqing glanced at this blood-red shadow that had the shape of a human. It was a ginseng that was emitting blood-red flames.

This ginseng was as tall as a human and had blurred eyes, a nose, and a mouth. From afar, it looked exactly like a scrawny cultivator.

“Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng!” Lu Xiaoqing screamed, and her heart started to pound.

Even though she had never seen such a legendary ginseng before, she managed to recognize it immediately. After the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng flew out from the ground, it escaped immediately. Flames burst out from its body, and it soared into the sky.

Lu Xiaoqing was shocked at its speed. Even a First Order Emperor wouldn’t be able to catch up to it!

Although the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng’s speed was fast, Huang Xiaolong was even faster. His figure blurred, and he appeared in front of it in an instant.

Huang Xiaolong reached out and grabbed its root.

Just when Huang Xiaolong thought that he had captured it successfully, the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng struggled to detach its main root from its body. It left behind the main root before speeding away.

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback as he looked at the leftover main root in his hand.

While Huang Xiaolong was stunned, the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng had already escaped tens of thousands of miles away and was preparing to hide underground once again. Without the slightest hesitation, Huang Xiaolong retrieved his Yellow Springs Magic Robe.

The Yellow Springs Magic Robe turned into a net that covered tens of thousands of miles. The devil qi it emitted was so great that the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng was swept directly into it.

No matter how hard the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng tried, it wasn’t able to escape. Huang Xiaolong grabbed the Yellow Springs Magic Robe before staring at the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng. “Old fella, this time, you are not going to escape from me.”

The Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng was a rare ginseng that had lived for billions of years. Compared to Huang Xiaolong, it was indeed an old fellow.

Huang Xiaolong restrained the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng and threw it into the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong turned and said to Lu Xiaoqing, who was staring at him in shock.

Lu Xiaoqing was dazed as it had only taken Huang Xiaolong three minutes to force out the Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng and capture it.

This speed!

At this time, Huang Xiaolong arrived at another peak situated tens of thousands of miles away. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just like how one mountain cannot hold two tigers, the same saying applied to the ginseng. Since the previous peak already had a Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng, there wouldn’t be a second one nearby.

At the next peak, Huang Xiaolong repeated what he did previously.

Instantly, lightning qi rumbled in the air.

It was too bad nothing came out of the ground.

Five minutes later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at another peak.

Despite traveling across five different mountains, Huang Xiaolong failed to locate another top-tier ginseng.

Huang Xiaolong was not discouraged. If he were to find top-tier ginseng everywhere he went, they wouldn’t deserve their legendary status.

Finally, at the seventh peak, Huang Xiaolong saw a different ginseng roots.

It was golden, and it radiated brilliant rays of golden light. Its roots were so dense that they covered the heavens.

“Taiwu Ginseng!” Lu Xiaoqing exclaimed.

It was indeed the Taiwu Ginseng.

The Taiwu Ginseng was two times bigger and much older than the previous Blood Jasper Divine Ginseng.

It went without saying that the Taiwu Ginseng failed to escape from Huang Xiaolong. Unlike previously, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to restrain it before throwing it into the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bracelet.

After searching through most of the mountain peaks, Huang Xiaolong finally gathered all twelve legendary ginseng.

The twelve legendary ginseng seemed to form a vast sea as they created massive waves that crashed about in the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

The next day...

All of a sudden, the Blood Eye Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele in Huang Xiaolong’s body shook.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

This... Tan Zhihui! The Glaze Devil Stele!

“Let’s return!” Huang Xiaolong stopped in his tracks and said to Lu Xiaoqing. Before she could even react, Huang Xiaolong dragged her towards the exit.

“Your Majesty, you...?” Lu Xiaoqing was puzzled.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had already found twelve legendary ginseng, he had only gone through less than half of the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range.

“Tan Zhihui has returned!” Huang Xiaolong said.

Lu Xiaoqing exclaimed in surprise, “Did Tan Zhihui really return to the Thousand Constellation Country?!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Although the legendary ginseng were precious, they couldn’t compare to the Glaze Devil Stele. Twelve legendary ginseng were more than enough to satisfy Huang Xiaolong. After all, they were not his main objective.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong and Lu Xiaoqing left the Thousand Constellation Mountain Range and traveled towards the northern part of the Thousand Constellation Country. Judging from the reactions coming from the Blood Eye Devil Stele and Myriad Curses Devil Stele, Tan Zhihui seemed to have arrived in the northern part of the country. From the lack of movement, it seemed as though Tan Zhihui had hidden himself well.

Just like what Huang Xiaolong had predicted, Tan Zhihui had been hiding in a mountain cave below a nameless peak near the northern part of the Thousand Constellation Country.

The cave that he was hiding in was extremely secluded and concealed from the world. Its surroundings were heavily guarded, and he was confident that even if an ordinary Emperor were to come looking for him, they wouldn’t be able to find him. The only way for them to locate him was to search through the entire mountain range by foot.

Tan Zhihui sat cross-legged at the bottom of the cave as the Glaze Devil Stele hovered in the air before him. It emitted resplendent rays of light.
