Chapter 3310: East Sea

Before he could leave the territory, a figure stopped him. “Stop right there.”

The person who appeared was the old ancestor of the Six Swords Gate, Fu Wu.

As someone who had half a foot in the Spirit Severing Realm, Fu Wu was one of the six strongest cultivators on Earth!

With his strength, he stood at the top of the power pyramid on Earth! Not even missiles could kill an existence of his level!

“Old Ancestor?!” Wang Zheng couldn’t understand why Fu Wu would stop him.

“He’s just a mere Huang Xiaolong. There’s no need for you to run all the way over there to kill him.” Fu Wu sighed. “Don’t forget that we have to deal with something urgent.”

Wang Zheng’s heart trembled when he heard what the old ancestor said. However, he couldn’t swallow his grievances just like that!

“But, Huang Xiaolong…”

“Didn’t he say that he would pay a visit to our Six Swords Gate? We can kill him then.” Fu Wu growled. “When he comes, you can do whatever you want to him!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Wang Zheng sucked in a cold breath and he nodded his head eventually. “Alright. I’ll let him live for a few more days.”

As the first rays of dawn illuminated the lands the next day, Zhang Yuhan looked in the mirror and jumped in fright.

Was that really her in the mirror?! Did she return back to her thirties in the span of a single night?!

“Xiaolong, is this… Is this really me?!” Zhang Yuhan couldn’t believe her eyes.

Chuckling slightly, Huang Xiaolong responded, “Of course it’s you. Unless you think that’s me in the mirror.”

A giggle escaped Zhang Yuhan’s lips and she discovered that her voice had also returned back to when she was in her thirties!

Staring at her arms, she discovered that her skin was fair and spring to the touch. Tears welled up in her eyes and soon, she started to bawl.

“Yuhan, what’s wrong?” Huang Xiaolong stared at her in shock and asked.

“Xiaolong, is this… Is this a dream?! Am I dreaming right now?”

Laughing helplessly, Huang Xiaolong reassured her, “Of course not.” Even though he said it countless times, Zhang Yuhan was still unable to believe that it was real. It was something he totally understood. When he transformed the bodies of his parents and his younger brother when he just returned to Earth, they behaved the same way.

No one could blame Zhang Yuhan for being suspicious. After all, her transformation was indeed a little ridiculous. She returned back to her thirties, and her cultivation base increased to the peak of the late-Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm in the span of a single night!

“Xiaolong, thank you!” Jumping into his embrace all of a sudden, Zhang Yuhan could feel the warmth of his body.

Stroking her hair slowly, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “You silly girl…”

The two of them seemed to have returned to the past as Huang Xiaolong stroked her hair in silence.

Their hug lasted a long time…

Finally, Huang Xiaolong laid down another formation around the Zhang Family Manor. He taught the grand elders of the Zhang Family the method to control the formation, and they were shocked to discover that not only could the formation absorb the spiritual energy around them, it could even stop anyone who tried to invade them… No… The power of the formation was even more terrifying than that. Even if the six strongest experts on Earth came over to the Zhang Family to cause trouble, the formation had enough power to blast them into smithereens.

Huang Xiaolong handed Zhang Yuhan five bottles of Blue Dragon Pills and said, “I made these pills myself. As long as you refine ten of them, you will definitely enter the Enlightenment Realm.”

“Enlightenment Realm?!” Zhang Yuhan was shocked.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded his head slightly.

“Xiaolong, this… This is too precious! I can’t accept it!” Zhang Yuhan tried to refuse the gift, but she was stopped by Huang Xiaolong.

“It’s nothing much. Even if I tried to use them myself, I won’t be able to receive any benefits. When you finish refining them all, I’ll give you even better pills.”

The amount of spiritual herbs on Earth was indeed lacking. Huang Xiaolong planned to head out to the other plants around in order to look for better herbs in the near future.

When Zhang Yuhan heard what Huang Xiaolong said, she didn’t know how to respond for a period of time.

“It’s been a long since you last met my parents… The two of them have been nagging me to bring you back.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Zhang Yuhan stared at him in stunned silence and her face started to flush red. “Do they really wish to see me?”

“Yeah.” Huang Xiaolong was slightly amused when he saw the shy look on her face. “It’s not like it’s your first time meeting them… Why are you so nervous?”

Zhang Yuhan pouted, “I.. I’m not nervous!”

“Yeah, yeah. I’m the nervous one.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

With a smile lighting up her face, Zhang Yuhan nodded slowly.

An hour later, the two of them left for the Blue Dragon Orchard.

As they rode in the flying ship Huang Xiaolong bought in the BMW dealership when he returned to Earth, they managed to arrive in the Blue Dragon Orchard in three short hours.

Zhang Yuhan might have said that she wasn’t nervous, but her heart was pounding when she entered the Blue Dragon Orchard. Her palms were sweaty and she didn’t know where to look.

Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan heard that Huang Xiaolong was bringing her back, and they gathered Huang Chenfei and the others in order to wait for her at the entrance to the manor. When they saw Zhang Yuhan standing beside Huang Xiaolong, Wang Meilan quickly went forward to welcome her.

Cheers broke out instantly when they met.

When they finally entered the manor, Zhang Yuhan gasped in shock at the luxurious interior.

During the banquet at night, Huang Jiyuan and Wang Meilan spoke about the matter with Wang Zheng. The two of them learned from Huang Shengan that Huang Xiaolong was threatening to behead one of the eminent elders of the Six Swords Gate and they couldn’t help but worry.

Chuckling slightly, Huang Xiaolong reassured all of them.

Due to the stunt he pulled in the Blue Dragon Orchard and the Heavenly Dragon Building, Huang Jiyuan and the others knew that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t as weak as they thought he was. They also knew that there was no stopping him once he made a decision. As such, they could only remind him to be careful when dealing with the Six Sword Gate.

Night soon fell, and Huang Xiaolong held Zhang Yuhan as they strolled about the manor.

“Xiaolong, can you tell me what happened in the past one hundred years that you’ve been gone?” Zhang Yuhan asked. She was extremely curious about the way Huang Xiaolong cultivated. She wanted to know how he learned the art of formations and the art of pill refinement.

“This… I can’t finish my story in such a short amount of time…” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “I’ve been away from Earth for the past one hundred years… In fact, I only returned half a month ago.”

Zhang Yuhan wasn’t surprised to hear that. “It’s no wonder all of us can’t seem to find you anywhere in the past one hundred years… I’ve heard that there are a lot of factions in outer space, and there are even experts who have surpassed the Enlightenment Realm! Is that true?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded and explained, “That’s right. After one surpasses the Enlightenment Realm, they will enter the Spirit Severing Realm. There are even higher cultivation realms, and it is true that there are a lot of powerful factions outside of Earth.”

“I really wish we can leave Earth and take a look at the world outside…” Zhang Yuhan sighed. “It will be my first time leaving this planet…”

“If you really wish to take a look outside, we can go for a stroll after I deal with some matters here on Earth.” Huang Xiaolong snickered. When they left, Huiang Xiaolong planned to bring his parents and the others along in order to widen their horizons.

On the very next day, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Eastern University along with Zhang Yuhan as they left for the East Sea with the students who signed up to repel the beast tide.
