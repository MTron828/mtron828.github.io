Chapter 3401: Corpse King’s Strength

 

As Huang Xiaolong walked deeper into the cavern, the corpses lining the sides grew bigger and bigger.

The corpse qi in the air grew denser, and it seemed to turn into a cloud hovering around them.

“Is that the corpse of a universe level beast?!” Sun Wukong yelped in shock when he saw the giant corpse sitting in the corner.

“Yeah. That’s a Radiant Winged Tick, and its wingspan is comparable to a Roc:”

“It has already reached the grand perfection level in the power of radiance.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “The same can be said for the power of space.”

A Radiant Winged Tick was said to be the bane of all creatures who cultivated with death qi. The strength of a Radiant Winged Tick who had reached the grand perfection level in the power of radiance was a terrifying existence.

However, the one before them died in the hands of Corpse King Ying Gou.

That was a Radiant Winged Tick who had reached the grand perfection level in the power of radiance and space!

It could only serve to prove how strong Corpse King Ying Gou was.

When Huang Xiaolong heard the strength the Radiant Winged Tick possessed when it was alive, his throat went dry.

“No wonder the Holy Phoenix doesn’t dare to antagonize this old fart…” Sun Wukong muttered under his breath.

After passing the corpse of the Radiant Winged Tick, the two of them continued inwards.

All of a sudden, Sun Wukong’s expression changed. An endless amount of undead creatures charged at them.

The undead creatures came in all shapes and sizes, and they were ugly to the extreme. There were even some who emitted foul liquid from their rotting bodies. Like an endless tide, they rushed at Huang Xiaolong and Sun Wukong.

The shocking part was that the creatures were extremely fast!

No matter how brave the Monkey King was, his scalp went numb when he saw the sheer number of creatures pouring towards him.

“Your Highness, the old fart probably sensed us.” 

Huang Xiaolong nodded slowly.

Summoning his Golden Rod, Sun Wukong was about to make his move when Huang Xiaolong interrupted him, “There’s no need for that.”

When Sun Wukong was still stuck in a state of shock, he saw the sea of undead creatures stopping right in front of him.

They seemed to be trapped in place!

As long as the creatures approached ten thousand feet, they would be stuck in place.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Every single type of power comes from the source of the world.” Huang Xiaolong pointed out.

Sun Wukong stared at the scene before him in disbelief.

Huang Xiaolong’s words were like bolts of lightning that slammed heavily into his brain. In that instant, it was as though a veil around him was lifted.

Every single type of power comes from the source of the world!

It might seem simple, but it was the truth that governed the universe.

Huang Xiaolong nodded silently when he saw the look of enlightenment on Sun Wukong’s face. It was true that the Monkey King’s comprehension abilities were extremely strong. It was no wonder he managed to cultivate the seventy two transformations in a short amount of time!

Understanding how difficult it was to remain in a state of enlightenment, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother the monkey. He left several restrictions around before making his way forward. 

The undead creatures would retreat whenever he approached, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t take long to venture deep into the cavern. He passed by a ton of corpse mountains, and several seas of undead qi. He finally arrived at the entrance of a palace.

The palace was made from white bones, and there were countless runes inscribed all over it.

The entire palace was a priceless artifact!

In fact, it was as good as the Five Finger Mountain he fused with the talisman.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the entrance of the palace, rays of light emerged from the interior as a green robed young man strolled out from the entrance. Sharp white bones protruded from his arms and legs.

Was that Corpse King Ying Gou?

Huang Xiaolong could see the other party’s body, and he learned that it was made up of corpse qi. However, the corpse qi that formed Ying Gou’s body was different from the corpse qi he had seen in the past.

“Fellow daoist is really strong, but you might not be able to defeat me here.” Ying Gou spoke as he kept his eyes on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head silently. “Even if you had ten thousand clones with your full strength, you will never be able to defeat me.”

Ying Gou was strong, and his strength was recognized by Huang Xiaolong.

However, everyone under the God of Creation Realm was nothing more than an ant.

Huang Xiaolong was someone who had surpassed ordinary Gods of Creation…

No matter how strong Ying Gou was, he wouldn’t be able to fight the monster of a man! 

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, a trace of rage flashed in his eyes. Death qi shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

It was too bad they didn’t even come close to hitting Huang Xiaolong. The death qi dissipated in the air as though it was never there to begin with.

Ying Gou stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. His figure blurred as he appeared before Huang Xiaolong in the next instant. His arms slashed at Huang Xiaolong’s head, and the white bones protruding from them were no weaker than innate heavenly artifacts. Not even Ninth Level Combined Dao Ancestors would be able to withstand the power of corrosion.

Huang Xiaolong casually waved his arms to stop the white bones. Ying Gou was speechless to discover that the spikes were unable to pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s skin!

A terrifying force emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s arm as it sent Ying Gou crashing into the walls of the palace behind him.

A wave of pain wrecked Ying Gou’s body and he couldn’t understand what was going on. 

The strongest weapons he had on him failed to pierce through the other party’s skin!

Not even Buddha Rulai possessed such a powerful defense!

“Who are you?!” Ying Gou suppressed the fear in his heart and asked.

“Huang Xiaolong.” 

“Huang Xiaolong?!” A trace of doubt flashed across Ying Gou’s face.

As he had been living in the cavern under the Fruits and Flower Mountain, he didn’t know much of what happened in the outside world. The reason he spied on Huang Xiaolong was because he realized that Sun Wukong was back. 

“I’ll give you a chance to unleash your strongest attack.” Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands behind him and muttered.

Narrowing his eyes, Ying Gou stared at Huang Xiaolong before he turned into a massive wave of death qi that surged forward.

There were death qi runes hidden in the waves, and visions of massive corpses could be seen from time to time.

Huang Xiaolong could feel the terrifying power of corrosion charging at him, but he remained in place. He didn’t defend himself with his true energy as the wave slammed into him.

The giant wave of death qi swallowed Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

After the wave finally subsided, a look of terror could be seen on Ying Gou’s face as he stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

There were only two people in the Pangu World who could defend against his corpse energy that came from the source of the world. One of them was Pangu, and the other was Hong Jun! Both of them were Gods of Creation!
