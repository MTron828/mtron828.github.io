Chapter 2111: The Method to Save Jiang Hong

The Ancient Heavenly Court shot through space as Huang Xiaolong charged towards the City of All-Heavens.

Within the Complete Heaven Palace...

“Little cow, is there still no news about the Reverence Moon Dean?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“No...” The little cow shook her head.

Ever since the Reverence Moon Old Man had escaped with grievous injuries, he hadn’t contacted Huang Xiaolong and the others. If they could actually make contact with the Reverence Moon Old Man, Huang Xiaolong would gain a better insight into Wan Shi’s strength. After all, he was the only one who had exchanged blows with Wan Shi previously.

“Continue to look for him... Use everything we have to find him!” Huang Xiaolong muttered in a low voice.

Both the little cow and Cang Mutian nodded their heads.

Silence fell upon the Complete Heaven Palace, and a solemn atmosphere filled the area.

“Is there really no way to revive my Senior Brother?” After several minutes, Huang Xiaolong finally broke the oppressive silence. There was a tone of unmistakable sadness in his voice.

Huang Xiaolong had been thinking about this problem for a few days. However, he hadn’t dared to ask the little cow or Cang Mutian as he was afraid of hearing their answer.

What would he do if the answer was a no?!

Every time he thought about the question, Huang Xiaolong would feel a sense of inexplicable fear in his heart.

“It’s difficult!” The little cow shook her head in response. “Even though every single Sovereign Realm expert has already assimilated into the world and would receive protection from the heaven and earth, it would be almost impossible to restore their soul once it shatters! No one has ever heard of a Sovereign coming back to life in the myriad of worlds!”

Cang Mutian continued, “Even though no one has succeeded in the myriad of worlds, transcending the Sovereign Realm might be a way to do it! Venerable Realm experts might have an idea!”

“Venerable Realm experts!” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but gasp in shock when he heard what Cang Mutian said.

Cang Mutian nodded in response, “That’s right. In the past, I had managed to obtain a broken tome in the depths of the Heavens Path. There were some records in it. Even though the tome wasn’t complete, I managed to guess that a Venerable Realm expert has the ability to transcend the heavens. A Venerable would be able to turn back time! If that really is the case, Venerable Realm experts might be able to revive your senior brother!”

A look of joy slowly spread across Huang Xiaolong’s face.

“Where are we going to look for a Venerable Realm expert?” The little cow poured a bucket of water over Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

He stared at her in shock as he had no idea how to respond.

“There has to be another world that transcends the City of All-Heavens and the myriad of worlds! It should be a world none of us has any knowledge about!” Cang Mutian continued, “Even though we have no idea about what it is, Wan Zhuoyuan has to know about it! He’s a reincarnated Venerable Realm expert after all!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. If that really was the case, it seemed like he had to capture Wan Zhuoyuan alive!

“Regardless of whether Wan Zhuoyuan knows about the existence of the other world or not, it would be extremely difficult for us to get there!” The little cow shook her head and sighed, “Even if we manage to cross over, how would we beg a Saint Realm expert to help us? Don’t forget that even though a Saint Realm expert might be stronger than us, Sovereigns, a huge amount of effort is needed in order to revive a sovereign! Why would anyone help us for nothing?”

Cang Mutian frowned. Everything the little cow said was true.

Firstly, they didn’t even need to speak about the journey to the other world. The main problem was inviting a Venerable Realm expert to help them! Why would a Venerable lower themselves and agree to Huang Xiaolong’s request?!

“Then I’ll just have to break into the Venerable Realm myself!” Huang Xiaolong declared.

Everyone stared at him in shock.

“Even though your talent is heaven-defying, breaking into the Venerable Realm isn’t as easy as it seems. Even if you can enter the Venerable Realm, it might take you several millions of years!” The little cow shook her head. “The longer it takes, the harder it would be to revive your senior brother!”

“There might be another way!” The little cow seemed to have thought of something.

Another way to revive Jiang Hong?! Huang Xiaolong and Cang Mutian found it a little shocking, but at the same time, relief washed over them.

“Gather all nine chaos lightning pools!” The little cow explained, “Once you gather all nine great lightning pools, they will fuse to form the Grandmist Lightning Pool! The Grandmist Lightning Pool might contain enough energy to shatter the heavens and crack the earth, but it also possesses endless life energy! The life energy contained in it can quicken the growth of an origin treasure, and it has been said that it had the power to restore life!”

“Power to restore life?!” Huang Xiaolong stared at the little cow in shock.

Cang Mutian nodded his head when he heard what the little cow said. “That’s what the legends say. As long as one gathers all nine great chaos lightning pools to form the Grandmist Lightning Pool, one would be able to walk across the earth unhindered! No one will be able to stop you! If you place a corpse into the lightning pool, they will experience a rebirth. The sooner they are placed in the Grandmist Lightning Pool, the quicker they will recover!”

Huang Xiaolong nearly jumped in joy when he heard the news.

He had never thought that gathering all nine lightning pools would pose such a miraculous effect!

If that was the case, his senior brother, Jiang Hong, could be saved!

“Isn’t this a little too heaven-defying?” The more Huang Xiaolong thought about it, the more incredible he felt it was. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The little cow chuckled in response, “That is also the reason no one has the ability to gather all nine great lightning pools since time immemorial... The Grandmist Lightning Pool is in defiance of the natural order, and the heavens would stop anyone from obtaining it...”

A brilliant light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Since no one had been able to gather all nine great lightning pools, he had to be the first to do so! The harder it was, the more he had to complete it!

Right now, he had already gathered six great lightning pools. There were only three of them left!

Huang Xiaolong decided that no matter what, he would look for the other lightning pools in the shortest amount of time in order to revive his senior brother!

“Actually, there is another problem...” Cang Mutian frowned. “Even if you manage to gather all nine great lightning pools, you still need to obtain your senior brother’s corpse. Without the corpse, how can he come back to life?”

Huang Xiaolong stared at them in stunned silence. He hadn’t thought about that.

“There’s a possibility of the Reverence Moon Old Man grabbing your senior brother’s body when he escaped!” The little cow hesitated for a moment before continuing, “If he didn’t, there is only one other way. We will have to look for Wan Yue!”

The prince of the City of All-Heavens, Wan Yue!

Killing intent started boiling in Huang Xiaolong’s heart the moment he heard Wan Yue’s name.

Soon after, every single power he could mobilize received his order to locate the remaining three great lightning pools.
