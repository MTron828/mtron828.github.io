Chapter 2812: Young Lord of a Certain Creed?

The Huang Long Bloodline in Huang Xiaolong’s body trembled when he stared at the massive Silver Dragon River before him.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by the sudden change.

“Young Lord, there’s a legend that revolves around the Silver Dragon River. In the past, a Four Horned Silver Dragon born during the creation of the world cultivated in the river for quite some time.” Fu Daosheng explained, “That is the reason the river gained its silver color, after absorbing the remnants of the Silver Dragon’s aura!”

“Four Horned Silver Dragon!” Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

The Dragon Race was made up of different dragons, and there were white dragons, black dragons, red dragons, gold dragons, winged dragons, and so on… This was the first time he was hearing of a Four Horned Silver Dragon.

Long Jianfei explained, “The Four Horned Silver Dragon is a type of dragon that can only be seen if one is fated to. Our Dragon Fish Dao Venerable met it once, and they came to blows. Even after pushing himself to the limit, the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable couldn’t do a thing to it!”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened in shock.

Duan Feng nodded and continued, “That’s right! Many creeds learned of the battle, but no one knows if the Silver Dragon River really was a cultivation ground for the supreme dragon.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, and a light flashed through his eyes when he looked at the river.

He thought of why his bloodline reacted when he arrived above the Silver Dragon River, and an absurd thought flashed through his mind. The Huang Long Armor might really be hidden in the lake!

Another reason why his bloodline reacted could be because of the remnant bloodline left behind by the Four Horned Silver Dragon. However, he didn’t know why the bloodline of the silver dragon would cause his Huang Long Bloodline to react!

“Young Lord, where do we go now?” Fu Daosheng asked.

The Silver Dragon River was massive, and it was comparable to several dozen sacred lands. So they couldn’t search blindly for the armor.

“Let’s go to the Silver Dragon Island before deciding on anything else,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

No one knew where the actual location of the armor was, and Huang Xiaolong decided to head to the island located in the center of the lake.

There were several million tiny islands located on the lake, but the Silver Dragon Island was the largest and the one that bustled with the most activity! Every expert who came to the Silver Dragon River would definitely head over to the island, and searching for news there would be the most efficient way of operation!

Charging through the skies, Huang Xiaolong and the others made their way over to the Silver Dragon Island.

By the time he arrived, there were people everywhere. Chariots and flying ships filled the skies as humans flooded the lands.

The experts from different regions had rushed over the moment they had received news of the Set of Creation, and one could imagine the gathering of the experts from several million sacred lands.

“This… It seems like even the patriarchs of their factions have arrived…” Cangqiong Old Man stared at the crowd below, and a look of trepidation appeared on his face. This was the first time he had seen so many Primal Ancestors strolling about the streets, and a majority of them were high-level Primal Ancestors!

His brain seemed to have slowed down as he felt some of his brain cells dying.

There wasn’t a need to speak of Cangqiong Old Man as Fei Yanzi and Mo Zhi were equally as stunned. Even a half-step Dao Venerable like Fu Daosheng couldn’t believe his eyes.

The number of Primal Ancestors from two to three million sacred lands around the Blue Heaven Heavenly Cave was a scalp-numbing number!

Huang Xiaolong made a casual scan with his dao souls and discovered several half-step Dao Venerables at Fu Daosheng’s level.

It seemed as though the allure of the Huang Long Armor was too much for them to bear!

Ordinarily, all of them would be hiding in their immortal caves to comprehend the grand dao. They would be able to step into the Dao Venerable Realm once the time was right, and they would hardly appear before the masses.

A casual sweep around him revealed more than twenty half-step Dao Venerables, and he was sure that there were more hiding on the island!

“Let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong spoke as he led the others out of the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

Since he had migrated the members in the Cangqiong Sacred Land, there were several million core disciples of the sacred land and more than four thousand Primal Ancestors living in the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

Leaving all of them behind along with the Immemorial Qilins, Huang Xiaolong brought Fei Yanzi, the Cangqiong Old Man, Long Jianfei, and twenty other experts out.

They might have been a small group, but aside from Cangqiong Old Man, Fei Yanzi, Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Mo Zhi, everyone else was either a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor of a half-step Dao Venerable.

The lineup could shock any sacred land.

With Huang Xiaolong leading the way, the party of more than twenty experts shot towards the Silver Dragon City.

Huang Xiaolong sent the Immemorial Immortal Cave to the deepest part of the void around the Silver Dragon Island. This way he could send the others back to the immortal cave if they ran into any danger.

When the members sitting in the flying ships and chariots in the skies above the city noticed the auras coming from the members of Huang Xiaolong’s party, their expressions changed. A path formed in the skies, and they didn’t dare to show the slightest bit of disrespect.

“Isn’t that Fu Daosheng?! Zhou Hong?! That’s Lin Hong and Chen Hu! Four half-step Dao Venerables! Why have they appeared together?!” Someone recognized them and gasped.

“What’s going on?!”

“Who in the world managed to get four half-step Dao Venerables to escort him?! Who is that kid?!” The gazes of those present landed on Huang Xiaolong, who was leading the group.

Four half-step Dao Venerables were following behind a young man as fervent expressions hung from their faces. Guesses started to form in their heads.

“Could he be the young lord of some creed?” someone guessed.

According to them, only a young patriarch of a creed could get Fu Daosheng and the others to follow behind him obediently.

“No! Even young lords of random creeds wouldn’t be able to do so! The only way is if he’s the young lord of a super creed!”

“What?! How is that possible?!” Someone else yelled in shock.

“Didn’t they disappear after fighting for the Immemorial Immortal Cave?”

“Is that true?! Wouldn’t that mean that Fu Daosheng would know where the Immemorial Immortal Cave is located?”

Guesses flew about, and even though a lot of them realized that Fu Daosheng knew the location of the Immemorial Immortal Cave, they didn’t dare to stop him for questioning. After all, his reputation as the number one expert in the Talisman Dao Heavenly Cave wasn’t there for nothing.

Before the Saint Devil Prince had taken Yan San as his master, Xu Dong’s reputation wasn’t anywhere near Fu Daosheng. As such, many people recognized the widely proclaimed number-one expert of his region.

Just as Huang Xiaolong and the others were about to enter the city, a group of disciples blocked them.

Staring at the robes on their bodies, Huang Xiaolong recognized the insignia of the Blue Heaven Creed.
