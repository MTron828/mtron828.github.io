The protective formation on the Tushita Flying Ship started to operate at full power, as Divine Tushita Flame formed a barrier around the ship.

A mysterious veil of mist formed when the frigid qi collided with the flames around the Tushita Flying Ship.

Along with the frigid qi in the lake growing stronger, the speed of the Tushita Flying Ship decreased, and it slowed to a crawl. Huang Xiaolong’s group was moving at a tenth of the speed compared to when they were in the air.

Even though the Divine Tushita Flame was known as one of the strongest chaos divine flames in the myriad of worlds, the frigid qi at the bottom of the lake was something else!

Without the Divine Tushita Flame surrounding the ship, the assistance of the radiance energy from the Heavenly Hall, and the divine flame armor on everyone’s bodies on the ship, they wouldn’t have been able to descend further into the lake.

Even though they had many layers of protection, all of them could feel the frigid qi seeping into their bones.

The icy lake was way deeper than Huang Xiaolong had thought. Only after descending for a thousand feet did they arrive at the bottom. They couldn’t even see their fingertips when they stretched out their hands, much less the surrounding area.

Huang Xiaolong tried to open his Eye of Hell, but the furthest he could see was a hundred feet around the flying ship.

Without a choice, Huang Xiaolong could only rely on the aura that resonated with the Blood Eye Devil Stele to start his search. He controlled the four odd beasts to steer the ship onwards as he tried his best to sense the aura coming from the Myriad Curses Devil Stele.

However, they didn’t travel long before the flying ship met with a mishap. As the Tushita Flying Ship started to shake, a huge impact blew them several thousand meters off course.

Everyone widened their eyes in shock.

“At the bottom of the ship!” Gao Changran screamed.

All of them felt something smashing into the bottom of the ship before they were sent flying.

Before they could react, another collision sent them tumbling again.

They were lucky the Tushita Flying Ship was a high-grade grandmist artifact. Even though it suffered from repeated attacks, the ship didn’t sustain severe damages.

“There’s something at the bottom of the soil!” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

He could feel that something hidden under the seabed had attacked them.

It was something that resembled a miniature ice dragon, and its body was snow-white in color. Even though it was only several meters long, it possessed horrifying strength. Huang Xiaolong knew that it was strong enough to challenge Tenth Order Emperors.

Even if the tiny dragon could not break the Tushita Flying Ship, it could get extremely difficult to advance if it kept sending them flying every few seconds.

Huang Xiaolong quickly summoned all fourteen radiance angels and sent them out to tangle with the ice monster. With assistance from the four odd beasts, they continued to drive the ship forward.

Even with fourteen radiance angels working together, the ice creatures gathered like shoals of fish, and they surrounded the Tushita Flying Ship. Before long, the fourteen radiance angels fell to a disadvantage. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong could only use the hundred Undead Race Netherguards to resist their combined strength.

No matter how hard they tried, the Tushita Flying Ship found it hard to advance.

Due to the ever increasing strength of the frigid qi around them, the Tushita Flying Ship’s speed decreased once again.

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

With their speed, they wouldn’t locate the Myriad Curses Devil Stele even if they used a full hour.

Looking at the ice creatures surrounding the flying ship, Huang Xiaolong felt his head start to hurt. The ice creatures were tough to kill, and despite the efforts of the Undead Race Netherguards and the radiance angels, only a few ice creatures were killed.

When they died, their corpses would turn into snow and fuse with the frigid qi in the air, making it a little colder.

“What devil beast is this?! Why are they so terrifying?!” Gao Changran couldn’t help but ask.

Lu Xiaoqing and the other three ancestors of the Black Wolf Race shook their heads when they heard his question.

Even though they had lived in the Devil Beast World for countless years, this was the first time they had seen such weird beasts.

All of a sudden, a lightbulb appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind. Why couldn’t he try to control these icy creatures with his Grandmist Parasitic Medium? However, he dropped the thought as soon as he came up with it.

Even though the grandmist worms could control any creature in the world, he would require the radiance angels’ assistance to subdue these creatures. A lot of time would be wasted, and the most important thing he had to do was to locate the Myriad Curses Devil Stele.

An hour slowly passed.

As the Tushita Flying Ship continued on its journey, a brilliant light appeared before them. With the light illuminating their surroundings, the ice creatures assaulting the ship stopped and turned around to leave.

Everyone was stunned. When they saw the scene before them, they felt their jaws dropping to the ground. Birds chirped among the beautiful greenery, and the fragrance of flowers entered their noses, spirit beasts roamed the lands, and it looked like they had arrived at a paradise.

No one expected had for such a space to exist at the bottom of the icy lake. After all, it exuded the complete opposite aura compared to the sinister lake.

Huang Xiaolong turned and looked behind him, only to see the freezing lake stretching out for as far as he could see.

When the Tushita Flying Ship entered the ‘paradise,’ Huang Xiaolong realized that he could no longer feel the presence of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele.

Even though the feeling disappeared, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t disappointed. Instead, a look of joy flashed across his face. He knew that the Myriad Curses Devil Stele was located somewhere around him.

Huang Xiaolong unleashed his divine sense and scanned the entire area. Even though it was somewhat restricted, he could feel that the space they were in wasn’t as boundless as the icy lake from before.

It shouldn’t be too difficult to locate the Myriad Curses Devil Stele...

As everyone left the flying ship, and they soared through the air to personally locate the stele.

The space was practically flat, and mountains were non-existent. There were patches of lush forests and a creek. The forests were lush, but they weren’t too big. Everyone could scan through a patch of forest easily.

“Is that a Golden Sleeve Tree?!”

Lu Xiaoqing yelled in shock.

Everyone turned to face the direction she was facing, and they saw a massive tree that was covered in gold. It was as though the tree itself was wearing a coat made from gold threads, and it looked like the king of trees as it stood tall in the middle of the forest.

The Golden Sleeve Tree was a type of rarely seen divine tree in the Devil World. It was sturdy beyond comparison, and it could be used to enhance the strength and durability of grandmist-grade flying ships and divine armors.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t stand on ceremony. With a wave of his arm, the Golden Sleeve Tree was uprooted and he kept it in the Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

As they came across several other divine trees that were at the same level of the Golden Sleeve Tree, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hold himself back. He grabbed all of them.

These were treasures that couldn’t be bought even if they had the spirit stones.

After half an hour, a tiny hill appeared before their eyes.

“This hill is...” Huang Xiaolong stared at the tiny hill, and he felt a weird feeling welling up in his heart. The Blood Eye Devil Stele in his body released brilliant rays of light and it was as though it had met with a long-lost family member.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze tilted upwards and landed on the peak of the tiny hill. There was a stone stele lying on the very top, and it was pitch-black in color. It was similar in shape to the Blood Eye Devil Stele, and the only difference between the two steles were the ancient curses carved into them. There were precisely ten thousand curse symbols carved on the stele.

“Myriad Curses Devil Stele!”

Huang Xiaolong, Gao Changran, Lu Xiaoqing, and the others called out in unison.

They had finally located the Myriad Curses Devil Stele!

A trace of joy appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s anxious heart. As he placed his palm on it, a comfortable stream of darkness energy entered his body. The energy felt nearly the same as when he had held the Blood Eye Devil Stele in his hand. However, he could feel a very tiny difference between them.
