“Huang Xiaolong!”

When the others were chatting happily with the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, a scream came from the crowd.

Everyone turned to stare at a lone figure riding on a black tortoise as he drifted towards the Dragon Cloud Sea.

When Feng Ming saw the black tortoise, he felt that it looked exceptionally familiar. However, he couldn’t remember where he had seen it before.

A name flashed through his mind, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face. “Tortoise Ancestor, Liang Xiao!”

Everyone stared at Feng Ming in stunned silence when they heard his sudden outburst.

“Tortoise Ancestor, Liang Xiao?!” Ao Ji took a closer look at the black tortoise Huang Xiaolong rode on and he couldn’t help but gasp in shock. “Is that black tortoise the Tortoise Ancestor, Liang Xiao?! Is this even possible?!”

The Tortoise Ancestor was an overlord who existed since the creation of the world! Even though he was at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, his defense was terrifying! The Radiant Winged Patriarch knew that he wouldn’t be able to shatter the old tortoise’s defenses even if he went all out!

How could Huang Xiaolong be riding on a creation-level beast of that level?!

“The Tortoise Ancestor went into the Blue Lotus Pond with the Poison Bodach, Nine-Headed Tree Demon, and the others. It was said that he went missing, just like the others!” Feng Ming frowned.

“What? Even the Tortoise Ancestor entered the Blue Lotus Pond? If the black tortoise is really Liang Xiao, would Huang Xiaolong be responsible for the disappearance of the Nine-Headed Tree Demon and the others?!” One of the grand ancestors gasped in shock.

Everyone turned to stare at the black tortoise instantly.

However, if existences at Liang Xiao’s level wanted to conceal their identity, they would be able to hide their aura completely. Even experts like the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor wouldn’t be able to uncover his identity.

When everyone was still stuck in their state of shock, Huang Xiaolong arrived in front of everyone.

Sweeping his gaze across Feng Ming and the others, Huang Xiaolong heard everything they said. Including the part where Feng Ming persuaded the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor to teach him a lesson.

“Seems like I came late.” Huang Xiaolong said as he stared at the giant crowd that already formed.

“I was too early. Your Highness, should we begin?” The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor chuckled softly.

“Of course.” Nodding his head, Huang Xiaolong leaped off the Tortoise Ancestor’s back. He soared into the skies and headed deeper into the Dragon Cloud Sea.

Mirroring his actions, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor followed behind him. When they finally stood opposite each other, a shocking aura started to emerge from their bodies. It covered the entire area and the world seemed to lose its color in the face of the terrifying power possessed by the two parties.

The clouds floating in the air dissipated and the air turned stale.

Everyone who were there to watch the battle quickly steered their flying ships away, and they emptied the battlefield for the two monsters.

Even with his power of absolute frost at perfection and the Huang Long Armor fully refined, Huang Xiaolong faced the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor with a serious expression. This was the strongest opponent he would ever face since the start of his cultivation journey!

In the past, they exchanged blows at the entrance of the Holy Dragon Race, but that was only a fraction of their power!

He could tell that there was no turning back now.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong seriously, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor wasn’t feeling any better. If the black tortoise was really the Tortoise Ancestor, Liang Xiao, he would have underestimated Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

“Your Highness, please make the first move.” The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor gestured for Huang Xiaolong to begin.

No matter what, he maintained his respect for Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and he summoned the power of Dao Body of Heaven and Earth. With his figure blurring, he appeared right in front of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor as he punched outwards.

Rip!

With the power of the entire Dragon Cloud Sea backing him up, Huang Xiaolong’s punch ripped through the space around him.

Regardless of their identities, the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables watching the battle felt their expressions dropping. They could feel the sheer power contained in Huang Xiaolong’s fist, and they knew that they would be deader than dead if they were Huang Xiaolong’s target.

Too strong!

That was the only feeling they felt.

When the story of the battle at the entrance of the Holy Dragon Race started to spread, everyone felt that those present were merely exaggerating Huang Xiaolong’s strength. They finally realized how wrong they were when Huang Xiaolong started his assault on the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.

Feng Ming and the grand ancestors of the Heavenly Phoenix Race were shocked by their discovery.

However, the battle was between two peak experts in the Divine Tuo Holy World, and the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor wasn’t going down to a single fist. Reaching out his right hand, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor stopped Huang Xiaolong’s fist. Like two stoppable forces, the two fists crashed into each other.

No one gained the upper hand in the first exchange.

When those around saw the outcome, they were shocked.

“This…”

“The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor only used one hand to stop Huang Xiaolong’s punch! He’s too strong!”

“Huang Xiaolong is really too strong… However, he’s still lacking when compared to the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.”

Ao He and the others revealed a face full of surprise.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked too. He used the power of space to the best of his abilities, and the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor managed to stop his attack with a single hand! Even though he only used his physical pwoer, he could see that the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor did the same!

It was clear that the body of the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was stronger than his dao physique! After all, his grand dao physique wasn’t at the perfection level. The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor should have already reached perfection state in his Holy Dragon Grand Dao Physique.

Being shocked was one thing, but Huang Xiaolong continued his onslaught. One punch after another, Huang Xiaolong’s fists were stopped by the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor. No matter how he tried, he couldn’t get past the old ancestor’s defense!

The two of them used the power of their fleshy body to the extreme, but they failed to claim victory over the other.

Shockwaves slammed into the crowd and several Primal Ancestor Realm experts in the crowd vomited mouthfuls of blood. No matter how strong the defensive formations the flying ships they were on possessed, it couldn’t protect them completely.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged more than a thousand blows.

With his body flashing once, Huang Xiaolong stopped his attack.
