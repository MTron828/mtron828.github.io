Chapter 3730: Can’t Thank You Enough

 

Huang Xiaolong casually swiped at the air and dragged a group of experts over to himself.

Not expecting anyone to grab them, they fell into a state of panic. When they were still dumbstruck, Huang Xiaolong searched through their memories.

He learned quite a lot about Lion King City from them.

All of them were ancient ancestors of their races, and they knew quite a bit.

“More than thirty experts who broke through the 20 billion mark…” Huang Xiaolong scoffed. “Looks like the Universe Source Stone is really tempting…”

The White Deer gasped in fright, “Are there actually so many of them?” 

More than thirty experts had crossed the 20 billion mark! That was practically all the experts the Fortune Space had to offer.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Other than Old Man Fortune and several others, almost all the experts in the Fortune Space have come. The old ancestor of the Golden Phoenix Race is also lying in wait in the city.

“What?!” The White Deer’s expression turned serious. It might be strong, but the other party was also someone who crossed the 29 billion units mark.

No matter who it was, they wouldn’t dare to look down on someone at that level.

“Yeah. Other than Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian are there too.” 

The White Deer’s expression became a little more serious.

The two of them were also existences who crossed the 29 billion mark.

“Wouldn’t that mean that there are three experts who crossed the 29 billion mark in Lion King City?” The White Deer sucked in a cold breath and said.

“That’s right. Are you afraid?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Puffing up its chest instantly, the White Deer sneered, “Nonsense! Why would I be afraid of Huang Ren and those old fogeys? There are only two people in the Thirteen Universe that can scare me. One of them is the Black Nether King and the other is Old Man Fortune! No one else is worthy of my attention!”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Looks like I’m just another weakling in your eyes…” Huang Xiaolong joked.

An awkward smile appeared on the White Deer’s face. “I… That’s not what I meant!”

Huang Xiaolong and the White Deer continued on their way towards the city in the midst of laughter.

“Brother Huang, why don’t we forget about it…” Yang Dingsheng hesitated. “We can save him in the future!” 

He didn’t expect there to be so many supreme experts camping in the city! As an ancient ancestor of the Yang Lightning Race, he knew how strong they were! Any one of them could be considered a peak existence in the Fortune Space! Without Old Man Fortune, the three of them could do as they wished!”

If they stomped their feet, the Fortune Space would tremble under their might!

According to Yang Dingsheng, Huang Xiaolong, and the White Deer couldn’t go against the strongest powers of the Fortune Space even if they were terrifyingly strong!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “There’s no need to worry. Even if Old Man Fortune came, I’ll be able to save your son.”

That was true. There was only a single person in existence who could cause Huang Xiaolong to hesitate. He was confident that he could defeat Old Man Fortune if push came to shove. Even though Old Man Fortune was slightly stronger than him, he had the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Boat, and other universe treasures! He would smash Old Man Fortune to oblivion with his collection of treasures!

One day later, the city came into view as the three of them stopped ten thousand miles away.

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls only to discover those waiting in the city.

Other than those who crossed the 20 billion mark, there were more than 200 experts slightly weaker than them!

The weakest person among them had 15 billion units of combat strength!

The White Deer managed to discover their presence as well and a frown formed on its face.

“Let’s go. They already discovered us.” Huang Xiaolong entered the city after he spoke.

As soon as they entered, several pillars of light rose into the sky and they intertwined to form a massive light barrier.

They had laid down the trap a long time ago.

“Hehe, Huang Xiaolong, you’re finally here,” a mocking laughter rang through the air. The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince and several others approached Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze landed on the prince, and he sneered, “Looks like you didn’t take my warning seriously.”

Previously, he said that he would kill his way into the Golden Phoenix Race if anything happened to people related to Yang Dingsheng.

Roaring with laughter, the crown prince sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, who the f*ck do you think you are? Why should I listen to you? Our old ancestor, Lord Zhou Fu, and Lord Shi Jian are currently waiting for you! You better follow me in obediently. Otherwise, we’ll capture you right here and now!” 

“Follow you in to greet your ancestors? They’re not qualified…” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

The experts standing around gasped in shock.

There were countless experts of the various races who came out along with the crown prince. The strongest among them reached the 27 billion units mark, and he was the continent master! His expression sank when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“They’re not qualified? Do you really think that you’re Senior Fortune?!” The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince sneered.

Huang Xiaolong casually pulled at the space before him and dragged the prince over to himself. Holding him by the neck, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Old Man Fortune?” 

The experts standing around finally reacted.

“Huang Xiaolong, release him immediately! Otherwise, you’re definitely going to die here today!” The continent master raged, “You won’t be able to escape from our grand formation today!” 

“Escape?” Huang Xiaolong smiled before popping the crown prince’s head like a balloon.

With his intentional use of the Universe Origin Fires, there wasn’t the slightest bit of resistance.

Miserable howls came from the crown prince as his head was blown into bits. His cries rang through the city.

Everyone who came with him was dumbfounded.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re f*cked now!” The continent master roared and he lunged at Huang Xiaolong. “You won’t be able to pay for your sins even if you die ten thousand times over!”

The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince’s identity in the Fortune Space was clear for all to see! He was comparable to the Fortune Prince, but Huang Xiaolong killed him like it was nothing! He basically waged war against the entire Golden Phoenix Race.

Huang Xiaolong sent a casual slap flying towards the continent master.

Bang!

Smashing through countless structures, the continent master slammed into the restriction stopping Huang Xiaolong from escaping. It shook violently upon impact.

Everyone sucked in a cold breath when they saw what happened.

In an instant, countless figures appeared before Huang Xiaolong. The people in the lead were Huang Ren, Zhou Fu, and Shi Jian!
