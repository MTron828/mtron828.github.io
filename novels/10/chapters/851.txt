The strength of this group of Yelu Family disciples wasn’t low. The weakest ones were at least early Second Order Highgod Realm, whereas the stronger ones’ cultivation was at early Third Order Highgod Realm.

Under the brutal attacks of the Yelu Family disciples, the six lightning beasts were killed a short while later and bright streams of light rushed out from their bodies into the disciples’ tokens.

“Congratulations, Big brother Yelu Xin, you have once again risen up the ranks, already reaching the 921th place.” One of the Yelu Family disciples congratulated a young man holding a great knife in his hand.

The rest of Yelu Family disciples quickly followed: “Congratulations, Big brother Yelu Xin!”

This young man holding a great knife, Yelu Xin, was the strongest person among this group of disciples, an early Third Order Highgod Realm master!

Hearing the waves of congratulations, Yelu Xin was full of smiles as he nodded. He then turned toward two disciples holding swords, “Yelu Bi, Yelu Xuan, both of your rankings are quite good, at 1,063rd and 1,087th places. You have high hopes of breaking into the top one thousand.”

Other than Yelu Xin, the strongest of the group would be Yelu Bi and Yelu Xuan, the former being a peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm and the latter was a late-Second Order Highgod Realm.

The remaining disciples were between early to mid-Second Order Highgod Realm.

Hearing Yelu Xin’s words, the remaining disciples also hurried to wish Yelu Bi and Yelu Xuan well.

“I wonder where Big brother Yelu Tianfeng is at the moment. Who would’ve thought there would be thirteen Fourth Order Highgod Realm disciples in the tournament, it seems there will be some difficulties for Big brother Yelu Tianfeng to enter the top ten.” Yelu Bi said all of a sudden.

This tournament’s Fourth Order Highgod Realm disciples reached an astounding number of thirteen people, exceeding everyone’s estimations.

Currently, those in the top ten were all Fourth Order Highgod Realm masters. Initially, the Yelu Family had assumed that their greatest talent of all times, Yelu Tianfeng, could sit comfortably in the top three, even snatching the first place without much of a problem. But now, not only was Yelu Tianfeng struggling to climb up to the top ten, he was currently ranked 15th!

Yelu Xin refuted, “It has only been three months, the current ranking is not an indication of the final result. Other than that Wangu Yanhui, our Big brother Yelu Tianfeng isn’t any worse than Fang Chu, Mu Qi, Zhou Yao, or the rest, Big brother Yelu Tianfeng can definitely enter the top ten!”

“That Huang Xiaolong, did he already die? This Overflowing Lightning World is bigger than we imagined, if he happens to hide in a remote corner it would be really hard for us to find him.” Yelu Xuan frowned, his voice solemn.

“That punk would better pray to die earlier, otherwise, if he falls into my hand, I have a thousand ways to torture him!” Yelu Xin snorted with disdain. Every time he recalled Huang Xiaolong using forty thousand top divine grade spirit stones to purchase the Surging Waves Mansion, his heart would burn with anger.

When had their Yelu Family ever been slapped in the face when it comes to money?

A while later, Yelu Xin continued to lead the Yelu Family disciples further into the city.

The lightning beasts inside the abandoned city were quite powerful, at least a First Order Highgod Realm and above, but with all of them working together, these lightning beasts were easily killed.

The Yelu Family had a heritage battle formation passed down from their ancestors, called Twin Frost-Flame Formation. When the formation was in place, their strength increased by a large margin, so much that they could even fight against a late-Third Order Highgod Realm lightning beast.

As their group continued to venture deeper into the city, their points rapidly rose.

“Big brother Yelu Xin, good news! Just now, a Beitang Family disciple sent me a message, saying he spotted Huang Xiaolong.” A few hours later, a Yelu Family disciple came running to report to Yelu Xin.

The other Yelu Family disciples that heard it all showed excited faces.

Yelu Xin was laughing out loud, “Really? That’s truly good news! When we return, we must heavily reward the Beitang Family disciple. Where did he see Huang Xiaolong?”

“He said that Huang Xiaolong is also in the same city as us, moreover, he’s not far from our location.” That Yelu Family disciple quickly answered.

“Good! I didn’t expect that punk to be in such close proximity to us, it saves us the trouble to go looking for him!” Yelu Xi’s eyes lit up.

“But, since that punk can reach this part of the city, it looks like his strength is as rumored, not weaker than a peak late-First Order Highgod Realm.” Yelu Bi analyzed.

“I love killing this kind of freak geniuses that have yet to grow!” Yelu Xuan’s eyes flashed with deep anticipation and excitement. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Let us head there now, lest that punk escapes.” Yelu Xin gave an evil chuckle, “I’m really looking forward to seeing that punk’s face when he sees us, the fear and panic in his eyes, hehe.”

With a unanimous decision, all of them rushed toward Huang Xiaolong’s location.

While the Yelu Family disciples hurried to capture him, Huang Xiaolong was standing in front of an enormous palace. The dark clouds hovering above this enormous palace were several times denser than other places he had seen so far, lightning as thick as an adult arm crackled and fizzed.

However, what attracted Huang Xiaolong’s attention wasn’t the dark clouds and lightning above, but the glimmer of rainbow-colored light that the enormous palace emitted from time to time, accompanied by a tantalizing fruity fragrance.

There was definitely some kind of rare and precious spiritual fruit inside!

And its age was definitely above two-million-years-old, maybe even three-million-years-old!

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to enter the enormous palace to find out, several sharp whistling wind sounds came from the distance.

Huang Xiaolong unhappily stopped and turned around to look.

‘Yelu Family’s disciples!’

Noticing these people’s robes, after a brief second of surprise, Huang Xiaolong revealed a smile. These days, while he had been searching for Xiang Mingzhi, he was also hoping to come across the Yelu Family’s disciples. He didn’t expect to run into them at this time, moreover, sixteen disciples all at once!

Sixteen!

If these sixteen disciples all died, the Yelu Family’s Patriarch would probably go mad with fury, right?

The sixteen Yelu Family disciples reached Huang Xiaolong in a short few breaths’ time.

“Huang Xiaolong, you never expected this, right? That your luck is so rotten to be found by us.” Yelu Xin complacently chuckled.

Yelu Xuan chortled, “You’ve been hiding for three long months, let’s see how are you going to hide anymore.”

Huang Xiaolong faced them with his hands softly clasped at his back, muttering to himself, “After I kill all of you, my points will be enough to enter the top one thousand.”

Hearing Huang Xiaolong muttering, Yelu Xin and all present Yelu Family disciples nearly keeled over with laughter.

“Did I hear right? This punk plans to kill all of us?” A mid-Second Order Highgod Realm Yelu Family disciple was laughing madly, “Does he thinks he’s a peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm master?”

“Eh, what fragrance is this?” Yelu Xin suddenly glanced at the enormous palace, his face revealing joy, “It’s definitely the scent of an extremely rare spiritual fruit more than two-million-years-old!”

As the other fifteen Yelu Family disciples smelled the waves of refreshing fruity fragrance, each of them was elated.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re really our lucky star ah, if it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have found a spiritual fruit of this level!” Yelu Bi was already celebrating.

Not a single one of the Yelu Family disciples noticed Huang Xiaolong’s disappeared from where he previously stood. The Water God’s Halberd in his hand emitted a ruthless gleam as it immediately cut through a mid-Second Order Highgod Realm disciple’s head. With a turn of his wrist, he directed the vertical cut sideways, slashing an early Second Order Highgod Realm disciple.

Several soul force swords quickly flew out from Huang Xiaolong’s body after that. With current soul force, Huang Xiaolong could form more than a hundred soul force swords at the same time.

Over a hundred swords decimated Yelu Xin and the remaining disciples.

On the Aeon Square, the ranking list’s 2,945th ranking glimmered brightly as Huang Xiaolong’s name replaced the previous one.
