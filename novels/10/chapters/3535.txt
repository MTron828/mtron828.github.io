Chapter 3536: Unreasonable

 

Huang Xiaolong thought about how he would finally enter the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm when he looked at the spiritual veins before him.

Without a second thought, he entered seclusion.

He swore to himself that he wouldn’t emerge from seclusion unless he entered the large completion stage.

Ao Shenghai revealed a helpless smile, and he spoke to Ao Guang and Wang Meiqi, “Seems like we should enter seclusion too. If I fail to break through, we might all become burdens to His Highness when he emerges.” 

“Did Jin Shenglin and Huang Zongquan come looking for you recently?” Ao Shenghai asked Wang Meiqi all of a sudden,

An irritated look appeared on her face when their names were mentioned.

“If they come again, I’ll throw them out personally!” Ao Guang snorted. “His Highness didn’t deal with them due to his generosity. They’re going too far!” 

Wang Meiqi paused for a second. 

Ao Shenghai continued, “Alright! I shall give them a good reminder…”

Wang Meiqi nodded but she added, “Whatever the case, we’re old friends. Please refrain from hurting them.”

“Of course.”

…

Three million years passed before Huang Xiaolong emerged from seclusion.

However, he couldn’t understand why he was stuck at the 8.999 billion mark. He couldn’t enter the large completion stage no matter how hard he tried. He reached that level one million years ago, but he failed to enter the large completion stage even after a million years of hard work.

The large completion stage was like a giant wall that wouldn’t budge no matter how hard he pushed against it. 

When he emerged, he summoned Ao Shenghai, Ao Guang, and Wang Meiqi.

“Your Highness, are you planning to go on a trip?!” They were stunned by his sudden desire to head out.

“That’s right. I’m stuck at the peak of the small completion stage, and I need to look for opportunities to break through out there.”

Huang Xiaolong knew that his foundation wasn’t stable after absorbing so many universe-level spiritual veins at once. His dao souls and dao heart were lacking a little, and he planned to head out for a little while to stabilize his foundations. He knew that it was the only way for him to progress into the large completion stage.

After thinking for some time, he decided to take a trip out.

“The First Universe is rife with rumors that Your Highness still has several dozen Star Dragon Scales. It’s extremely dangerous for you to head out now,” Ao Guang reminded.

Huang Xiaolong smiled. “I can’t stay in the Eternal Heaven Alliance forever.”

They stared at each other, and Wang Meiqi eventually quipped, “We shall follow you then…”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “There is no need. I wish to travel alone. After all, that would be beneficial for me to enter the large completion stage.”

Turning to Ao Shenghai, Huang Xiaolong continued, “Since Shenghai hasn’t broken through, all of you should stay here.”

Ao Shenghai might be at the limit of the grand competition stage, but he was different from Huang Xiaolong. Entering seclusion was much more beneficial for the old dragon.

Before he left Huang Xiaolong decided to have a proper spar with Ao Shenghai.

At the start, they fought to a draw. However, Huang Xiaolong eventually gained the upper hand and served Ao Shenghai with a miserable defeat.

The greatest reasons were the three great worlds in his body, and the Star Dragon Divine Tree. The amount of energy he could draw was endless, and Huang Xiaolong’s ability to drag the battle out worked in his favor.

Several days later, they escorted him to the edge of the world.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The moment he arrived, he ran into Jin Shenglin and Huang Zongquan. From the looks of it, they were obviously waiting for him.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re a coward for sending your subordinates to fight!” Huang Zongquan yelled the moment he saw Huang Xiaolong. “Meiqi isn’t your cultivation partner, and you can’t stop us from meeting her!”

Jin Shenglin might not have said anything, but it was because he was friends with Huang Xiaolong. Despite that, he seemed to be there for the same reason as Huang Zongquan.

Huang Xiaolong understood what was going on when he saw the looks on Ao Shenghai’s and Ao Guang’s faces. He turned to Huang Zongquan and muttered, “Indeed, it’s not my problem if you wish to visit her. However, she has already rejected you guys. It’s my problem now that you refuse to give up.”

Folding his hands behind his back, Huang Xiaolong continued, “If you’re not happy about it, you’re free to attack me.”

Jin Shenglin and Huang Zongquan were taken aback.

With his expression sinking, Huanh Zongquan growled, “Huang Xiaolong, do you really think that with the Star Dragon couple backing you, along with Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang, we won’t dare to move against you?” 

Before he could attack, he was stopped by Jin Shenglin. Jin Shenglin shook his head slowly to stop Huang Zongquan from doing anything rash. “Zongquan, remember the rules of the alliance!”

He stopped in his tracks, but he glared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll cripple you one of these days!” 

Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Is that so? I’ll be waiting for that day to come. However, I don’t think it ever will…” With his current strength, he could defeat Ao Shenghai! He knew that he could crush someone like Huang Zongquan with a single finger if he so wished. 

Huang Xiaolong left after he was done speaking.

When they saw his leaving figure, Huang Zongquan sneered, “Huang Xiaolong is too f*cking arrogant. If not for the Star Dragon couple backing him, I would crush him right here and now!”

Jin Shenglin shook his head slowly. He felt that Huang Xiaolong was acting too arrogantly and he sighed, “It’s too bad we can’t afford to offend him.”

“Wang Meiqi definitely chose to serve him because of the Star Dragon couple. In fact, Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang were probably sent over to protect the kid!”

Jin Shenglin nodded slightly.

Their conclusion was basically what everyone in the First Universe thought. After all, why would three Gods of Creation at the great completion stage listen to a brat who hadn’t reached the large completion stage?

No matter how terrifying his background was, he wouldn’t be able to convince them to work for him!

As soon as Huan Xiaolong left, the news of him leaving the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s territory started to spread through the First Universe.

He might not be afraid that others would plot against him, but he didn’t wish to be held up. As such, he hid his tracks the moment he left.

He wasn’t planning to explore aimlessly. His destination was the Black Sea!
