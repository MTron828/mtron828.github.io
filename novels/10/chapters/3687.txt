Chapter 3688 – Strongest in the Universe

“Ranked in the middle?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

The Golden Cymbals King had crossed the 27 billion units mark in terms of combat abilities. Wouldn’t that mean that there were at least six people stronger than that?!

“That’s right!” Zhu Chen’s expression was sullen when he spoke about the Universe First Race. “As the race that was born before the creation of everything else, they are the strongest people in existence. I heard that the Black Nether King who’s the strongest among them is comparable to a true Universe God!”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank when he heard the news.

Black Nether God!

He wasn’t a Universe God, but he was comparable to one!

As he continued to cultivate, the terror of a Universe God shook Huang Xiaolong to the bone.

Even though the Black Nether King might not be one and he didn’t possess the ability to rule over all of existence, his strength was shocking enough!

“Have you seen the Black Nether King before?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhu Chen.

“No.” Zhu Chen shook his head.

“Huh?”

Zhu Chen continued, “In the past, the Universe First Race shattered the Thirteen Universes without the involvement of the Black Nether King. Because of the Ferocious Devil, we managed to survive as we moved to the Unknown Space. If the Black Nether King had moved against the universes in the past, nothing would be left.”

When he thought about how the universes were destroyed, he felt his heart palpitating with fear.

The destruction of the universe caused a powerful shockwave to spread through every inch of existence. No one could escape their fate. Ancient races were destroyed and even half step Universe Gods were turned into dust.

Massive continent, holy world, and even great worlds were destroyed!

Zhu Chen clenched his fist as the blood drained from his face.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was equally as ugly.

The Black Nether King didn’t even do anything in the past. Yet, the Thirteen Universes were destroyed! If he personally appeared, who in the world would be able to hold him back?

Even if Huang Xiaolong joined hands with the Ferocious Devil, they might not be able to do a thing!

In fact, he might not be a match for the Black Nether King even if he managed to gather all thirteen universe treasures!

One might be able to gain an unimaginable amount of strength after they gathered all thirteen universe treasures. However, one’s cultivation base was all that mattered. Nothing mattered if one’s cultivation realm was low! Compared to experts like the Black Nether King, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was too damn low!

“When we seeked refuge in the Unknown Space, we laid down countless restrictions to hide our presence. We should be able to detect the presence of any members of the Universe First Race as soon as they enter our region!” Zhu Chen realized how serious the problem was all of a sudden and he gasped. “How in the world did the Golden Cymbals King enter the Netherworld without us detecting anything?”

“Did the restrictions lose their effect?”

Zhu Chen’s voice turned cold.

The appearance of the Golden Cymbals King caused fear to sprout in his heart.

An uneasy feeling filled his mind.

They had been at peace with the Universe First Race ever since they relocated to the Unknown Space. Even though the members of the Universe First Race knew of their presence, they didn’t launch any attack against them. The thirteen kings of the Universe First Race didn’t choose to hunt them down to the last man standing!

That was because they were afraid of the Ferocious Devil!

Now, the Golden Cymbals King came over sneakily and destroyed the Eighteen Hell Grand Formation in order to cause chaos in the Unknown Space!

Wouldn’t that mean that the Universe First Race was starting to move against them?!

Huang Xiaolong naturally thought of everything Zhu Chen could think of.

With his expression sinking slightly, Huang Xiaolong realized that if the Universe First Race moved against the Unknown Space, they would definitely do something to the Thirteen Universes!

When that happened, the Blazing Dragon World, Pangu World, and the other great worlds would be destroyed for sure!

With his strength, he might be able to escape into some pocket of space, but his family and friends would definitely die!

Huang Xiaolong clenched his fists tightly together.

“Are you able to contact the Ferocious Devil?” Huang Xiaolong asked Zhu Chen all of a sudden.

Zhu Chen shook his head and sighed, “Lord Devil hasn’t appeared in a long time. No one knows where he went. Not even the Dragon Overlord or the God of Death knows where he is!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“The only person who might know where Lord Devil is is the Green Ghost.” Zhu Chen muttered.

“Green Ghost?!”

“That’s right. Lord Green Ghost might know where Lord Devil is. However, Lord Green Ghost hasn’t appeared for quite some time. There are some who say that Lord Green Ghost is currently hiding in some secret space with Lord Devil in order to comprehend the grand dao. Lord Devil has been hiding in seclusion all this time in order to raise his strength to fight against the members of the Universe First Race.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhu Chen hesitated for a moment and he continued, “According to Lord Devil, the Universe First Race will definitely destroy the Thirteen Universes a second time since they already did it in the past.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He was afraid of that.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that the Universe First Race would move against the Thirteen Universes soon.

“Why do they wish to destroy the universe?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“I have no idea. However, Lord Devil guessed that it has something to do with the Black Nether King breaking through to the Universe God Realm.”

“?!” A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Doesn’t that mean that the Black Nether King wishes to use the lives of the Thirteen Universes to break through?”

“That’s possible.” Zhu Chen nodded and continued, “He failed previously, and he might try again this time.”

As such, there might be a second and even third time!

He would do it again and again until he entered the Universe God Realm!

In order to save the Thirteen Universes, there was only one option! He had to get rid of the Black Nether King!

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong asked about matters regarding the Ferocious Devil.

Gui Chi might be the Green Ghost’s close aide, but he had no idea what went on with the Ferocious Devil.

Huang Xiaolong learned how strong the Ferocious Devil was from Zhu Chen. His combat strength has already crossed the 29 billion mark. However, Zhu Chen wasn’t exactly sure how strong he was!

Next, Huang Xiaolong asked if Zhu Chen and the others were really trapped in the Unknown Space. After all, he heard that they would draw over a terrifying tribulation if they left.

Zhu Chen nodded his head and explained, “That is true. We might have escaped from the Thirteen Universes in the past when it was getting destroyed, but we were struck by the curse that came along with the destruction. We only managed to suppress the curse using the power of the Unknown Space. If we leave, we’ll definitely draw over the destruction tribulation.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank. If Zhu Chen and the others were unable to leave the Unknown Space, he wouldn’t be able to count on them when he fought with the Universe First Race in the future!
