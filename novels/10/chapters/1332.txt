A beat later, the Sand Waves Sect’s group also saw Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and others.

After a momentary bewilderment, Liang Luwen started laughing like a maniac. His eyes turned red from hatred and bloodthirst as he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong, “The heavens is fair! Punk, you didn’t think of this right? Ah, I actually run into you here in the Soulless Star. This time, I’m going to tear you into a million pieces!”

His killing intent surged like an angry storm.

During their last encounter with one another, Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er’s strength had alarmed him because he had only had a handful of Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders at his side. This had made it difficult for him to contain Feng Er. But the situation was different this time, since all of Sand Waves Sect’s disciples were with him!

Forty-two Grand Elders!

As long as these forty-two Grand Elders formed the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Formation to entrap Feng Er, and the others, then, he would have enough time to kill Huang Xiaolong and pulverize him into pieces in order to avenge his son!

“Zhi’er, father will avenge you this time by killing this punk—! Though it’s a bit late, don’t you worry, he’s going to die a wretched death!” Liang Luwen screamed hoarsely. Then he ordered, “Into formation! You all delay them, I’m going to kill this punk personally!”

“Yes, Sect Chief!” Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders complied in sonorous voices, and immediately leaped into positions to form the Sand Waves Sect Grand Formation as they tried to entrap Feng Er, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and the little cow.

Liang Luwen’s palm strike cut across space, slamming towards Huang Xiaolong.

Pity that Liang Luwen didn’t know that the void devil beast Xu Baisheng and the rest had been cultivating inside the chaos lightning pool’s space for over a decade, not to mention, their cultivation had risen by one order. Especially Xu Baisheng, his cultivation had recovered to Second Order God King Realm. If Liang Luwen had been aware of this, he would have turned and fled with his tail between his legs, instead of raging to kill Huang Xiaolong.

As the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were about to attack Xu Baisheng, and the others, Xu Baisheng suddenly raised his palm and pressed in the air. The Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders felt a surge of terrifying power that was beyond their imagination. They couldn’t move!

A second later, all the Grand Elders tumbled backwards simultaneously, just like withered leaves.

As void devil beast Xu Baisheng attacked, Feng Er also made her move. She took a step forward and arrived in front of Liang Luwen with her palm hitting out. Her attack collided with Liang Luwen’s attack.

A great ghost fog flooded silently like the rigorous morning tide towards Liang Luwen. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Liang Luwen was startled, as a thunderous boom ensued in a split second. His whole body shook and he was knocked back in the air, violently vomiting blood.

He looked at Feng Er with dumbstruck terror. He could see many of the injured Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders from the corner of his eye. Then, his terrified gaze fell on the void devil beast Xu Baisheng.

No—!

Impossible—!

“Y-y-you, you, you al-l, wh-y? How?!” He was trembling as his gaze went back and forth between Feng Er and Xu Baisheng. Disbelief, denial, and unwillingness were apparent in his eyes.

Liang Luwen remembered the last time he had fought Feng Er; she was still a peak mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, with less than a finger-sized gap difference between their strengths. But based on the exchange between them at this moment, Feng Er was a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm for certain!

In a little over ten years!

Even more frightening was that beast. Forty-two Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders had formed the formation to entrap their enemies, but all of them were sent flying with just one strike? All of them?!!

Liang Luwen’s heart trembled violently as he sensed the pressure coming from the Void devil beast. It was many times more powerful than Feng Er.

A God King Realm master!

Definitely, the momentum of a God King Realm master!

‘What’s going on?!’

He was certain that this beast’s cultivation had lower than Feng Er the last time; not even a Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. But now, he was a God King Realm master!

Liang Luwen was horrified. His mind was overwhelmed as a barrage of questions flashed in it.

At this point, all the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders were quivering with fear and despair.

“Kill him!” Huang Xiaolong coldly ordered Xu Baisheng.

“Yes, Master!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng respectfully complied.

Master! The Sand Waves Sect’s party was bewildered as they heard a God King Realm master referring to Huang Xiaolong as his Master.

“Wait!” Liang Luwen was bloodlessly pale as he struggled, and shrieked fearfully, “Who are you? You, you cannot kill me!”

The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s lips curved slightly into a sneer as he looked at Liang Luwen. He asked playfully, “Why can’t I kill you? Is it because you are the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief?”

Liang Luwen blanked for a second. At this moment, he finally realized that his identity was useless in the black-haired young man’s eyes.

“I, I, that, as long as you don’t kill me, I, can, submit to you!” Liang Luwen stuttered with much difficulty as he promised through gritted teeth.

“Submit to me?” Huang Xiaolong drawled with complete disinterest.

As he saw Huang Xiaolong’s indifferent expression, Liang Luwen hastened, “That’s right, submit to you. I can be your subordinate. Our entire Sand Waves Sect will submit to you, everyone, will submit to you!”

“Be my subordinate?” Huang Xiaolong ridiculed, “Are you telling me that you’re willing to become my subordinate even after I have killed your son? Don’t you feel like tearing me into a million pieces? Weren’t you howling you want to avenge your son, just moments ago? Didn’t you want me to die a death worse than your son?”

Liang Luwen was choked by Huang Xiaolong’s questions, and he was unable to find his words for a second. Huang Xiaolong’s every word was like a needle stabbing at his heart.

Huang Xiaolong had killed his son, it would be a lie to say he didn’t hate Huang Xiaolong. Not a day had passed in the last ten years, when he hadn’t thought of killing Huang Xiaolong.

He indeed was thinking about avenging his son in the future, as long as he managed to survive this time.

Huang Xiaolong signaled to void devil beast Xu Baisheng with a look, and he responded by striking Liang Luwen with his palm. Liang Luwen’s pupils dilated in fear. He turned around in an attempt to make his escape, but he was slapped into the ground by Xu Baisheng. The corrosive devil qi from Xu Baisheng’s palm instantly reduced Liang Luwen’s corpse into nothing but white bones.

All of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders turned deathly pale as they witnessed Liang Luwen’s death.

But, none of them tried to flee, as they knew that it was impossible for them to escape.

Huang Xiaolong glanced coldly at Liang Luwen’s white bones. Although he had briefly thought about subjugating Liang Luwen, his current cultivation realm was low for branding his soul mark on Liang Luwen’s soul. This wouldn’t have allowed him to fully control Liang Luwen. Hence, Liang Luwen had to die to prevent future troubles.

Huang Xiaolong spotted Liang Luwen’s fallen spatial ring, and reached out to grab it on an impulse. As he wiped off the spatial ring’s restriction, Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover its contents.

There were a number of spirit stones, herbal ingredients, divine pellets, and divine artifacts within the spatial ring. This bedazzled Huang Xiaolong for a second.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong was perplexed. Even if Liang Luwen was the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief, he couldn’t have possessed so many spirit stones, herbs, divine pellets, and divine artifacts...

He turned and pointed at one of the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders, and inquired about it. Only then he came to know that Liang Luwen’s group had managed to obtain a treasure at the center of the Soulless Star. Huang Xiaolong shook his head thinking that Liang Luwen was quite unlucky; even though Liang Luwen had gotten a big treasure, he was dead to to spend it. The treasure had ended up benefiting Huang Xiaolong instead.

Huang Xiaolong put away Liang Luwen’s spatial ring, he then looked at the group of Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders.

Kill or not to kill?

In the end, Huang Xiaolong did not kill the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders. He made all them to ’tactfully’ submit under his authority. No one had any objections.

Huang Xiaolong looked indifferently at the seemingly respectful Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders. He knew that these people had no loyalty towards him, but it didn’t matter. Once his Grandmist Parasitic Medium would step into the second stage, and he would able to condense Grandmist worms, and then these people would have no other choice but to show him their utmost loyalty.
