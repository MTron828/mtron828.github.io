The Fortune Gate Ancestor’s cultivation dwelling wasn’t surrounded by rare spiritual herbs or fruits. It was merely the most common dried grass hut, built with easily obtained ordinary wood, simple, plain, very much resembling a hidden Shangri-la.

This was something unexpected for Huang Xiaolong.

In all truthfulness, he had assumed that with the Fortune Gate Ancestor’s status, his cultivation dwelling would be grand and lavish, majestic, closer to a heavenly palace.

Shortly after he and the Fortune Gate Ancestor sat down, Huang Xiaolong stated the purpose of his visit.

After stating his intention, the Fortune Gate Ancestor barely hesitated. He turned slightly towards Li Lu who was standing close to him, “Lu’er, take my Fortune Medallion and make a trip with Union Chief Huang to the Tong Prefecture City.

The Vermilion Bird Institute Principal Qiu Baifei and others from the four galaxies were precisely hiding in the Fortune World’s Tong Prefecture City.

Having Li Lu to accompany Huang Xiaolong indicated that the Fortune Gate Ancestor agreed to Huang Xiaolong’s request to round up Qiu Baifei’s group and let him do as he saw fit.

This was within Huang Xiaolong’s expectations.

Qiu Baifei’s group weren’t Fortune Gate disciples, only a batch of people that came seeking their protection. Moreover, that group of people merely consisted of low-level Highgod Realm cultivators. As long as the Fortune Gate Ancestor did not have something wrong with his head, it would be impossible for him to offend Huang Xiaolong just for that.

Li Lu received the Fortune Medallion from her Master’s hand and respectfully saluted before leaving, leading Huang Xiaolong out from the Sacred Fortune Mountain to the Tong Prefecture City.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Tong Prefecture City, Qiu Baifei and He Feifan were dual cultivating with several Fortune Gate female disciples. When they saw him appear, their faces drained of color and everything else wilted.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong had ‘cleansed’ the world off Qiu Baifei, He Feifan, and then some.

With Li Lu holding the Fortune Medallion, no one tried to hinder or attack Huang Xiaolong, greatly reducing his troubles.

After dealing with Qiu Baifei’s group, Huang Xiaolong did not leave the Fortune World in a hurry, staying at the Sacred Fortune Mountain for ten days. In these ten days, he had three sparring sessions with the Fortune Gate Ancestor. As for the result, no one knew except the two of them.

Since the Fortune Gate Ancestor did not reveal anything, Li Lu and his other disciples dared not ask. However, after each sparring session, the Fortune Gate Ancestor seemed much older than before.

On the eleventh day, Huang Xiaolong stood in front of the Fortune World’s transmission array, looking at Li Lu, “You really aren’t willing to return with me? Father, and Mother both miss you, especially Mother. There’s also Huang Min.”

Li Lu avoided Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, subconsciously biting her lips, but she shook her head in the end, “Let’s talk about this later.”

Huang Xiaolong sighed silently in his heart, knowing it was of no further use trying to persuade her, thus he did not continue. They had time, what’s more, this matter couldn’t be rushed.

At the very least, Li Lu wasn’t aversed to spending time alone with him. More importantly, when they were alone, there was no veil covering her face.

To Huang Xiaolong, this was good enough for now.

As an afterthought, he took out a spatial ring. As he gave it to Li Lu, he said, “Inside this are ten thousand sacred grade immortal spirit stones, and ten batches of rank ten tribulation grade Myriad Cure Holy Pills that I refined myself.”

Ten thousand sacred grade immortal spirit stone! Ten batches of rank ten tribulation grade Myriad Cure Holy Pills!

Waves of astonishment struck Li Lu’s heart.

“This...!” Li Lu’s natural reaction was to decline.

Huang Xiaolong gently shook his head at her, “I know what you want to say, but I have ample amounts of sacred grade spirit stones and rank ten tribulation grade Myriad Cure Holy Pills.” He turned and stepped into the transmission array.

The transmission array activated, and Huang Xiaolong’s figure was already gone when it’s light dimmed, leaving only an echo of his words in the air: “I’ll come see you again.”

Li Lu stared dazedly at the empty transmission array, her heart feeling similarly empty. She stood there dazed for a long time before her calm returned. Clenching the spatial ring tightly in her palm, she turned and flew back to the Sacred Fortune Mountain.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong was back in the Divine Dan City.

Even though he was back in the Abundant Deities Manor, Huang Xiaolong was reminiscing about the ten days he spent with Li Lu at the Sacred Fortune Mountain.

The lines of her delicate face, every faint smile of her cherry lips replayed before Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Shi Xiaofei approached him from behind, her voice soft and comforting, “About younger sister Li Lu’s matter, don’t think too much about it. She will come around.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, quietly reaching out to hold Shi Xiaofei’s small hands in his.

He broke the silence five minutes later, saying, “I’ll set off for the Path to Hell the day after tomorrow, it may take three years or even longer. In my absence, you, father, mother, and everyone else shouldn’t leave the Divine Dan City.”

Although with Huang Xiaolong’s current status and influence there shouldn’t be anyone who would dare harm his family, being extra careful wouldn’t hurt.

Shi Xiaofei nodded in an obedient manner, “Don’t worry about us, we’ll take care of ourselves. The Path to Hell is laden with dangers at every corner, be very careful. You must safely return!”

Huang Xiaolong pulled Shi Xiaofei into his arms, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely come back.”

The Icebound Galaxy stood out as one of the most bizarre places amongst numerous galaxies in space. This was due to the peculiar black ice present everywhere. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Black ice drifted down from the void above, raging endlessly over the Icebound Galaxy’s several tens of thousands of world surfaces and planets.

This black ice contained vigorous yin qi that was hard to block out even for a late-Tenth Order God Realm cultivator. In less than a quarter of an hour, they would be reduced to an ice sculpture.

That was why only Highgod Realm masters dared to venture into the Icebound Galaxy.

Most of all, located at the far end of this place was the infamous Path to Hell.

Space rippled above an uninhabited planet within the Icebound Galaxy as a figure stepped out, it was Huang Xiaolong.

He spent two days with his family in Divine Dan City after returning from the Sacred Fortune Mountain, then set off to the Path to Hell.

Huang Xiaolong maneuvered through the Icebound Galaxy’s drifting black ice, passing through countless stark, gloomy, and cold world surfaces as they became smaller and smaller behind him.

He continued on without using the four divine fires or any other flames to dispel the coldness from the black ice, allowing it to fall on his body. Increase the yin qi in these sheets of black ice by a hundred times and they still wouldn’t be able to weaken Huang Xiaolong’s current True Divine Dragon Physique.

He didn’t transform into his primordial divine dragon form, nor did he hurry using Greater Space Teleportation, just flying across space normally.

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong reached the other end of the Icebound Galaxy.

A path that stretched wider than the eyes could see, built from entirely black soil; the Path to Hell was in sight. A purplish qi shrouded most of the Path to Hell, akin to a giant chaos space beast concealing itself in the vast space with its mammoth of a black hole-like mouth stretched wide waiting for prey.

Huang Xiaolong continued flying toward the Path to Hell.

As he was getting closer, at the Sacred Fortune Mountain, a Fortune Gate female disciple was reporting to Li Lu, “Senior sister, we’ve discovered that only one place has Yin Yang Godly Water, The Path to Hell. As for where exactly, we were unable to find out.”

Li Lu’s brows wrinkled a little, “The Path to Hell...”

“Alright, you can leave.”

“Yes, Senior sister.”

After the female disciple left, Li Lu muttered to herself, “It seems I need to make a trip to the Path to Hell.”

Since the Yin Yang Godly Water could only be found in that place, she absolutely had to go.

As long as she acquired the Yin Yang Godly Water, she would be able to balance the yin and yang forces inside her to the most optimum state.
