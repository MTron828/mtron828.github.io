“According to your judgment, what is that Huang Xiaolong’s strength now?” Wang Na questioned in a somber voice.

He Zhiwu and He Fei exchanged a glance. He Zhiwu hesitated before speaking, “I think his strength is on par with Eldest Senior Brother.”

The Eldest Senior Brother was referring to Liu Yun.

“What you two are saying is, that Huang Xiaolong’s real strength is already comparable to a peak late-Tenth Order God Realm master?” Wang Na asked again in detail after hearing He Zhiwu’s answer, unable to accept it.

Liu Yun was someone who had cultivated for more one ten thousand years. How long had Huang Xiaolong been cultivating?

Both He Zhiwu and He Fei were dejected as well. In fact, the two of them also found it hard to believe that they were defeated by Huang Xiaolong. However, what happened earlier couldn’t have been an illusion, their injuries and pain were the best evidence.

They smiled wryly inside while nodding their heads at Wang Na after her second question.

Wang Na sucked in a breath of cold air. She did not speak further, her expression sullen to the extreme.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength had actually grown to this extent!

“Vice-Principal.” The two of them called out cautiously after seeing Wang Na remain silent for a long time.

Wang Na regained her senses.

“Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday banquet is nearing, and the Institute Principal will definitely bring Huang Xiaolong to participate. This subordinate feels that it’s a good opportunity.” He Zhiwu suggested.

Wang Na’s eyes lit up, “You’re saying that if that Huang Xiaolong becomes the Saint Mother’s legacy inheritor, then we can...?”

“Exactly, but with Huang Xiaolong’s current strength, there’s only a handful of people below the Highgod Realm that are capable of killing him.” He Fei solemnly reminded.

Wang Na pondered, “You two need not worry about this, I have my own arrangement.”

“Yes, Vice-Institute Principal.”

Three days later.

After Huang Xiaolong’s three days of construction, a new grand dwelling once again stood on the top of the Golden Dragon Peak.

The newly built dwelling was as grand as a palace, gleaming under the sunlight. Its surrounding land was once again filled with spiritual trees, flowers, and medicinal herbs.

Huang Xiaolong nodded with satisfaction looking at his new work. Then he flew straight to his Master’s manor.

When he arrived, his Senior Apprentice-brother Liu Yun and Third Apprentice-sister Qi Wen were already there. Other than them, his Second Apprentice-brother Chen Yang was also there.

These years Huang Xiaolong rarely saw Chen Yang and their relationship was nothing to speak of. Even though Chen Yang saw Huang Xiaolong, he had no intention of exchanging any greetings, whereas Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the kind of person that went about flattering others. ‘Treat others as they treat you’, hence Huang Xiaolong also ignored Cheng Yang.

When Feng Yang saw that all of his disciples had arrived, they departed from the Black Warrior Institute with him at the front, heading to the Great Lake World.

With ample time before the day of the banquet, their journey proceeded in a relaxed manner. From time to time, they would stop for a day or two when passing by certain world surfaces.

Their journey progressed without incident.

Roughly a month later, Feng Yang’s group finally arrived at the Azure Dragon Galaxy’s Great Lake World.

Tearing the Great Lake World’s outer barrier, the five people entered its atmosphere. The moment Huang Xiaolong entered, he immediately felt the rich water element spiritual energy in the environment.

Moreover, this Great Lake World’s water spiritual energy contained a unique life force. Although faint, Huang Xiaolong was able to detect it, which surprised him.

One must know, life force within spiritual energy was something rarer than rare. Huang Xiaolong had been to quite a few world surfaces, but he had yet to see a world surface that had life force within its spiritual energy. That’s why this Great Lake World’s water spiritual energy that contained life force came as a surprise to Huang Xiaolong. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Liu Yun, Chen Yang, and Qi Wen also detected the faint life vitality contained in the spiritual energy, their expressions mirrored Huang Xiaolong’s.

When Feng Yang saw his disciples’ expressions, he chuckled and said, “It is said that in the primordial times, a God of Life died in this Great Lake World. Furthermore, his godhead integrated with the Great Lake World and that’s why there is life force in the spiritual energy here.”

“The God of Life’s godhead!” Huang Xiaolong and the others were astounded.

Feng Yang smiled, “Yes, of course, that’s how the legend goes. Whether it’s true or not, no one knows. In these millions of years, countless masters have tried searching for this fabled godhead, but until now, not a single person succeeded.”

A light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

No one ever found it? If this Great Lake World really contained the godhead of a God, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he would be able to find it.

That’s because he had the Blood Sacrifice Law!

He could use the Blood Sacrifice Law to find the godhead, just like that time when he was searching for the Hundred Spirits Beast King’s sealed arms.

Huang Xiaolong had already decided. After Saint Mother Yao Chi’s banquet, he would try to search for that primordial God’s godhead using the Blood Sacrifice Law.

When a perfection stage Tenth Order God Realm broke through to the Highgod Realm, condensing their godhead, the godhead condensed also varied according to the person’s cultivation technique. Therefore, godheads also had different attributes.

Cultivators cultivating earth element techniques would condense an earth element godhead, cultivation related to fire would create a fire element godhead, then water element, metal element, and lightning element.

Other than the common elements, there were also the light element, dark element, and life element!

The light, dark, and life element godheads; these three were the hardest kind of godheads to condense. Especially the life element godhead.

Due to the vibrant life force contained inside a life element godhead, if it was absorbed by cultivators below the Highgod Realm, it could improve their physique from the core and also increases one’s lifespan. Hence, it was more valuable than most godheads.

Godheads of other elements might not be suitable to absorb due to the differences between a person’s cultivation technique or their physical limitations, however, the life element godhead was different. Regardless of a person’s cultivation technique or physical limitations, they could easily absorb the life force inside the godhead. The Huang Family could also do so.

If he could find this life element godhead, even though he himself didn’t need it, the life force inside it would be beneficial to his family and Shi Xiaofei.

“I was wondering who might it be, so it’s the Black Warrior Institute Principal.” While Huang Xiaolong was pondering about that God of Life’s godhead, a voice sounded. Turning to look, a group of people could be seen flying toward them in the distance.

It was the Jiang Family Patriarch and Jiang Family members.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed.

Moments later, the Jiang and Gudu Families’ people reached Feng Yang’s group.

“Haha, Black Warrior Institute Principal, you’re also here to attend Saint Mother Yao Chi’s banquet?” The Jiang Family’s Patriarch, Jiang Wuhuang, flashed a radiant smile as he greeted Feng Yang, “What a coincidence, we’re also here to attend the birthday banquet.” [1]

Judging from the smile on Jiang Wuhuang’s face, no one would have guessed that he held a deep grudge toward Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Yang responded mildly, “Coincidence, indeed.”

The Gudu Family Patriarch Gudu Ye’s gaze swept over Huang Xiaolong, Liu Yun, and the others, then back again on Huang Xiaolong while speaking to Feng Yang in a flat tone, “I didn’t expect Institute Principal Feng Yang would bring along his youngest disciple to participate in Saint Mother Yao Chi’s birthday banquet. Is Institute Principal hoping for another stage battle during the banquet, so that your disciple can once again amaze everyone with a brilliant act?”

Gudu Ye’s words were full of mockery and provocation.

A sharp light gleamed in Feng Yang’s eyes, “Patriarch Gudu need not exert yourself over this.”

A tall young man beside the Jiang Family Patriarch took a step forward, condescending and provocative as he glanced at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye, “So, you’re that Huang Xiaolong? I hope you can maintain your legendary undefeated record on Saint Mother Yao Chi’s battle stage.”

“Institute Principal Feng Yang, we’ll meet again at the banquet.” Jiang Wuhuang let out a horrid laughter, as he and Patriarch Gudu flew off with people from their families.

1. Yes, Wang Na’s Wuhuang Peak is named after the Jiang Family Patriarch, Jiang Wuhuang.
