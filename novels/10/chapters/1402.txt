As one of the world’s seven wonder fruits at the third rank, the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits naturally contained a shocking amount of energy. Taking this into consideration, Huang Xiaolong practiced caution and did not refine too many of these fruits simultaneously, like he usually did with other things.

Huang Xiaolong watched the flaming fruit floating in front of him. It was surrounded by a hundred small fire phoenixes. He took a deep breath to calm himself, and after a few minutes he and his three avatars started circulating their godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Flames around the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit danced wildly as if it was doused with oil, and when Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars swallowed it, there was a sea of flames around them.

Huang Xiaolong felt like his body was being incinerated within the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s sea of flames.

Hot!

This was his first sensation.

Scorching hot!

This was his second feeling.

At one point, there was nothing but heat and pain.

Pain, excruciating pain!

Huang Xiaolong felt pain from the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit’s burning flames even with his strong true dragon physique, not mere pain, but excruciating pain. One could imagine how powerful the flames were.

Enduring the scorching heat from the flames, Huang Xiaolong pulled himself together and focused to persistently circulate his godforce according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium cycle after cycle.

Waves of vigorous fire element energy from the enshrouding flames surged into every corner of Huang Xiaolong’s body through his pores, nostrils, and even through the orifice of his ears.

When this fire element energy entered Huang Xiaolong’s body, Huang Xiaolong felt like his internal organs were being roasted over fire, and it intensified his pain.

In his consciousness, his three supreme godheads were greedily absorbing the incoming fire element energy.

And his three supreme godheads were vibrating and emitting rings of radiant lights, as if they were stimulated by this fire element energy.

These radiant ripples of light were bathing Huang Xiaolong in a great halo.

Fortunately, before Huang Xiaolong had begun cultivating, he had activated the room’s defensive formation, or else, this radiant light would have alarmed the whole Martial Dragon City.

As a large amount of vigorous fire element energy drilled into his body and his three supreme godheads, Huang Xiaolong’s consciousness began to blur. After this, he continued circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium by instinct.

...

One hour passed, two hours...

Ten days went by.

The fire element energy continued to flow out from the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Soon, a month came and went by.

After a month of continuous absorption, Huang Xiaolong’s three supreme godheads and True Dragon Physique gradually adapted to the overwhelming amounts of fire element energy from the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Thus, the pain assaulting Huang Xiaolong weakened and gradually disappeared.

Two months later, an unprecedented comfortable feeling filled Huang Xiaolong as warm energy flowed throughout his body. Wherever this warm energy passed through his body, it gave him an indescribably comforting feeling, almost making him groan.

Few more days passed...

The one hundred fire phoenixes around the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit seemed to be attracted by some kind of power within Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars. Due to this, they actually flew into Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars’ bodies.

It started with one fire phoenix spirit entering Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Half a day later, it was another fire phoenix.

Huang Xiaolong’s three avatars were also absorbing the fire phoenix spirits.

In less than half a month, these one hundred fire phoenix spirits were completely absorbed by Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars.

Huang Xiaolong was still bathed by a radiant fiery light.

Five days later, the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit seemed to have exhausted all of its fire element energy, and it combusted into flames then vanished from the world.

The next day, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and exhaled a breath of foul qi like a dragon spewing fire.

Huang Xiaolong immediately noticed his cultivation had risen to late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm, and he was already close to entering peak late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm. If refining a Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fire fruit for three to four months could yield this result, then he could break through to Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm in less than a year!

But the repair progress of the Giant Shark Flying Ship had been hanging at the back of his mind, therefore he stopped cultivating and stepped out of his room.

He saw Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng were still repairing the Giant Shark Flying Ship, but were already in the last stages of repairs. Probably, the repair would be done in the next ten days or so.

Even though ten days weren’t much, Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste time idling around, instead, he resumed his cultivation. However, ten days weren’t enough for him to refine one Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit, therefore, he resorted to swallowing a few top-grade chaos spiritual pills and cultivated.

He took out five hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills and swallowed them all at once.

Although five hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills could make Huang Xiaolong feel a bit bloated, his current True Dragon Physique had no problem handling the sudden vast energy.

After refining five hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills, Huang Xiaolong consumed another five hundred top-grade chaos spiritual pills the next day.

Ten days later, Huang Xiaolong had refined five thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills.

Five thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills in ten days!

Had it been another late-Third Order Ancestor God Realm cultivator with a high emperor rank godhead, refining one top-grade chaos spiritual pill would have taken at least half a year. Accordingly, refining five thousand top-grade chaos spiritual pills would have taken more than two thousand years!

But Huang Xiaolong had merely used ten days!

This speed was unprecedented, and never heard before.

When Huang Xiaolong once again stepped out from his room after ten days, Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng had finished repairing the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

Huang Xiaolong asked them the condition of the newly repaired Giant Shark Flying Ship. Xiang Xun respectfully replied, “To answer Master’s question, in addition to fixing the Giant Shark Flying Ship, we also refined a new core formation with the extra space velocity stones. Due to this, the current Giant Shark Flying Ship is much faster compared to other top-grade chaos flying ships.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled happily at Xiang Xun’s report, but he said to reconfirm, “You mean the current Giant Shark Flying Ship’s speed is not far from a low-grade grandmist flying ship... is that right?”

Xiang Xun solemnly answered, “More or less.”

That’s excellent! Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were sparkling with ecstasy.

In that case, will the Giant Shark Flying Ship take less than seven or eight years to reach the Royal Buddha Great Worlds? Maybe, six years, or even five years would do.

“Everyone get ready, we’ll leave Martial Dragon City in two hours!” Huang Xiaolong said to Xiang Xun and the rest.

Xiang Xun and the rest complied respectfully and went off to pack their belongings.

At this time, Gudu Yue and Song Rui were watching Huang Xiaolong’s residence from a balcony not far across from Huang Xiaolong’s residence.

“That kid has been hiding inside his residence ever since he came out from the auction?” Gudu Yue asked one of his subordinates.

“Yes, Young Master. We have been watching the residence night and day. We have not seen anyone leaving the residence.” The subordinate answered respectfully.

“We can’t do anything to that kid if he decides to hide inside until God knows when!” Song Rui snarled.

Gudu Yue was frowning with displeasure. “Wait for another two months. If they still continue staying inside after two months, I’ll think of a way to make it difficult for them to stay inside the Martial Dragon City, and they would have no choice but to leave!”

Based on his association with Longwu Clan’s core disciples, Gudu Yue believed that he could force someone out of the city without exerting much effort, if it came to that.

Right at this time, a subordinate by Gudu Yue’s side was agape with shock as he stared dumbly at the airspace above Huang Xiaolong’s residence.
