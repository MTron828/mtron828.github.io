Chapter 2899: Disciple of the Qiao Family

“Your Highness, should we take a look?” Duan Feng turned to ask Huang Xiaolong the moment he heard the cries for help.

“Let’s take a look,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

After locating the cries, the Qilin Chariot turned to charge towards it.

They soon discovered a pair of youngsters who were surrounded by a group of experts. From the looks of it, they were at an absolute disadvantage.

Duan Zheng gasped in shock when he saw the group of people hunting the youngsters. “Qiao Family!”

Qiao Family?

Duan Feng and Long Jianfei stared at each other and shock flashed through their eyes.

“Are they the Qiao Family of the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Cave?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

In the past, Duan Zheng had said that he was accompanied by his good friend from the Qiao Family when he had looked for the immortal cave in the marsh.

“Yes, Your Highness, that’s the one!” Duan Zheng nodded and looked at the members of the Qiao Family. A look of contempt appeared on his face. After all, no one would be happy when they were backstabbed by their friends.

The young man and young lady caught sight of Huang Xiaolong, and they seemed to have found a trace of hope in their otherwise decided fate.

“Seniors, please save us!” they begged instantly.

By raising his hand, Huang Xiaolong pointed at the members of the Qiao Family. He sent them all flying with a gesture.

The two of them were stunned for a second, but they quickly flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s party.

“We are disciples of the True Yang Sect of the Nine Palace Sacred Land. I am Yuan Lin, and I would like to express my thanks.” The male disciple bowed to Huang Xiaolong.

The Nine Palace Sacred Land was where the marsh was located, and Huang Xiaolong had once went there to scout out their strength. He knew that the True Yang Sect was the second strongest power in the sacred land.

They were slightly taken aback when they heard that the two youngsters were from the True Yang Sect.

However, it didn’t take long for the disciples who were flung away to return. The members of the Qiao Family surrounded Huang Xiaolong and the others.

“Who are you?” One of the disciples of the Qiao Family snapped the moment he returned. His tiny eyes looked even tinier on his massive face, and his facial features were a mess. “We are members of the Qiao Family in the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Cave! You better not interfere with us!”

They might have been sent flying by Huang Xiaolong, but they remained extremely hostile the moment they returned.

Of course, they had the ability to remain cocky.

After all, the Qiao Family was one of the super clans in the Scarlet Blood Heavenly Cave!

Standing at the peak of a region, the Qiao Family was comparable to some of the ordinary Creeds. As a peak late-Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable, the old ancestor of the Qiao Family was an expert in the eyes of many.

Of course, the disciples of the Qiao Family mostly entered the Scarlet Blood Creed to obtain high positions.

The middle-aged man growled, “This entire region has been claimed by my Qiao Family since a few months ago. The few of you had better leave right now. Otherwise…”

“What if we don’t?” Duan Zheng muttered in a cold voice.

“If you refuse to leave now, you won’t be able to leave later.” The young man sneered.

With an expressionless face, Huang Xiaolong knew that the Qiao Family had taken the marsh for themselves because of the existence of the immortal cave. It seemed as though Duan Zheng’s good friend had already made a report to the higher-ups of the Qiao Family in order to gain some benefits. Right now the Qiao Family had to be sending over several experts in order to explore the immortal cave.

Sweeping his gaze across the members of the Qiao Family, Huang Xiaolong stated calmly, “If I refuse to leave, even if your old ancestor arrives, he won’t be able to do anything.”

The members of the Qiao Family were slightly taken aback by his claim. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, they soon started to laugh. “How arrogant!” The middle-aged man snorted, “Do you really think that the old ancestor wouldn’t be able to deal with a Primal Ancestor like yourself?!”

He might have been forced to retreat by Huang Xiaolong previously, but he was still a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. He was able to see through Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation realm instantly.

By the time the words left his lips, several figures had soared towards them.

When the members of the Qiao Family saw the newcomers, they couldn’t help but rejoice. Experts were there to reinforce them, and there was even a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor among them.

When the two disciples of the True Yang Sect saw the newcomers, a wave of despair washed over their hearts. They hid behind Huang Xiaolong, and they knew that everything rested on the young man before them.

“Lord Qiao Shuanghe!” The members of the Qiao Family greeted the group of experts instantly. The person they welcomed was naturally the strongest in the group, the peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

The Qiao Family had mobilized four Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors in order to obtain the immortal cave, and one could see how much they valued it.

Nodding towards the members of the Qiao Family, Qiao Shuanghe soon turned to face Huang Xiaolong and the others.

“Have you told them about how this area belongs to our family?” He casually asked the middle-aged man.

“We tried to ask them to leave, but the little b*stard said that even if our ancestor arrived, he wouldn’t be able to do as he wished!”

Qiao Shuanghe and the other three stared at each other in amazement. They soon burst into laughter.

Qiao Shuanghe stared at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “Are you for real? Do you not know about my Qiao Family?”

“Right. How can a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor know anything about a super clan like us?”

The disciples of the Qiao Family burst into laughter.

“Preposterous!” Duan Feng and the others raged when they saw how the Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor mocked Huang Xiaolong.

The expression of Qiao Shuanghe sank, and he snorted, “Since you’re not planning to leave, you can stay here forever!” As soon as he spoke, a massive palm print appeared in the skies. It came crashing down on Huang Xiaolong and the others.

According to him, none of them would be able to stand up against a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor like him. No matter how strong they were, they would be beaten half to death by a single attack from him!

Against these weaklings, he felt that sixty percent of his strength was more than enough to kill them!

The two disciples of the True Yang Sect stared at the massive palm print descended on them and hopelessness filled their hearts.

However, they failed to notice that Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother staring at Qiao Shuanghes attack. As the ice qilin raised its head, a beam of light shot towards the palm, freezing it in mid-air.

“What?!”

Qiao Shuanghe and the others gasped in shock.

The two disciples of the True Yang Sect also stared at the ice qilin in amazement.

The fire qilin wasn’t going to wait for them to catch their breath as a red beam shot towards the members of the Qiao Family. With Qiao Shuanghe in the mix, all of them turned to dust.

By casually waving his arm, Huang Xiaolong grabbed their dao souls and threw them into the immemorial grand formation.

With a look of disbelief, the two disciples of the True Yang Sect stared at Huang Xiaolong. They couldn’t understand what had just happened.

“Alright, the two of you can leave now.” Huang Xiaolong’s words brought them back to reality.

Snapping to attention, the two of them thanked Huang Xiaolong profusely before going on their way.

When they finally left, Huang Xiaolong and the others started to head deeper into the marshes.
