Chapter 3371: Five Great Continents

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. He had been chatting with Yan Shiming in the past two days, and he heard about the Snow Forest Immortal Gate.

The Snow Forest Immortal Gate only accepted female disciples, and even the servants there were female.

Since Huang Xiaolong lowered their speed to ensure that Liu Huang could keep up, they only arrived several hours later.

The Wind and Lightning City was massive, and it basically took up the entire mountain range. The land mass alone stretched out for several hundred million miles.

Yan Bao’er stared at the city before him with wide eyes. He didn’t think that there could be a city this large.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong looked at the words above the entrance before stepping into the city.

Liu Huang and Yan Bao’er followed closely behind.

Releasing his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong discovered that there were thirteen Golden Immortals in the city. The strongest out of all of them was only a Third Level Golden Immortal.

“I heard that the patriarch of the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate left seclusion several days ago. He announced that he would choose a direct disciple among the core disciples of the immortal gate!”

“What?! Is he going to pass down the highest art of the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate, the Secret Storm Art?”

Several people discussed among each other.

Yan Bao’er turned to Huang Xiaolong and gasped, “Immortal Huang, if you become a core disciple of the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate, wouldn’t you get the chance to become the patriarch's direct disciple?”

Huang Xiaolong and Liu Huang roared with laughter.

Liu Huang explained in Huang Xiaolong’s stead, “Bao’er, do you really think we’re here to enter the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate?”

A confused expression could be seen on Yan Bao’er’s face. “Isn’t that why you came here?!”

In the main hall of the Wind and Cloud Immortal Gate, Wang Jingwen, the patriarch of the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate, was speaking to the twelve eminent elders of the immortal gate about his decision.

“Patriarch, didn’t you say that none of the core disciples are suitable to inherit your mantle?” One of the eminent elders, Hu Yidan, asked.

Wang Jingwen’s announcement after he left seclusion shocked everyone in the immortal gate.

However, a look of worry could be seen on the patriarch’s face. “Zhang Pu is back…”

“What?! Zhang Pu?!” Hu Yidan and the others gasped in fright.

Zhang Pu!

Wang Wenjing’s mortal enemy!

When Zhang Pu escaped from the Misty Immortal Country, there was no news of him. Who would have thought that he would return!

“That’s right. Zhang Pu is back. He challenged me to a life or death battle in th White Bone Mountain in a month.” Wang Jingwen sighed, “I recently received the news. After he escaped from the Misty Immortal Country in the past, he entered the Shushan Immortal Gate. He became one of their outer elders, and he received some resources from one of the grand elders of the faction. He should have already entered the Fourth Level Golden Immortal Realm.”

“Shushan Immortal Gate?!” Hu Yidan and the others cried out in shock.

The Shushan Immortal Gate was the strongest faction in the Northern Dragon Region! It wasn’t something their Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate could compare to.

“That’s right. I regret not going all out in the past. Now that he’s back, he’s definitely planning on killing me.” Wang Jingwen sighed.

“I cannot allow the Secret Storm Art to die with me. This month, I need to choose a direct disciple to pass on my cultivation technique!”

Hu Yidan and the rest didn’t know what to say.

An oppressive atmosphere filled the hall.

Wang Jingwen might be a Third Level Golden Immortal, but he was a mere early-Third Level Golden Immortal. Compared to Zhang Pu who was at the Fourth Level Golden Immortal Realm, he was far too lacking! The outcome of the battle was basically set in stone!

When everyone was thinking of what they should do, a flash of light could be seen in the hall and three figures revealed themselves.

Wang Jingwen and the others were shocked.

“Who are you?!” A frown formed on Wang Jingwen’s face and he stared at Huang Xiaolong’s group warily.

That was the main hall of their faction! There were countless restrictions laid down around the space, and Wang Jingwen laid them down himself! How in the world did they enter so easily?

Yan Bao’er was equally as confused. He looked about curiously as it was the first time he had seen such a luxurious hall.

“Immortal Huang, where are we?” Yan Bao’er asked. They barely stepped into the city a moment ago when the space around him twisted. The next thing he knew, he was in such a majestic hall.

“This should be the Wind and Lightning Immortal Abode.” Huang Xiaolong smiled before walking towards the thirteen of them.

“Wind… Wind and Lightning Immortal Abode?!” Yan Bao’er’s eyes went wide. Wouldn’t that mean that those people in the hall were…

Hu Yidan felt a wave of rage surging in his heart when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong didn’t so much as glance at them after entering the hall. “Who are you! If you refuse to tell us what you’re doing here, you can’t blame us for…”

A terrifying aura emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body, interrupting him before he could complete his sentence.

Wang Jingwen, Hu Yidan, and the others fell to their knees as the weight of an entire world pressed down on them. They couldn’t even breathe as they looked at Huang Xiaolong in fear.

Supreme Golden Immortal?! Could he have reached the Great Gathering Immortal Realm?!

Huang Xiaolong controlled his aura once again and they felt as though they received a grand pardon from the gods themselves.

“We… We didn’t know who senior was and we offended you unknowingly! Please forgive us!” Wang Jingwen felt beads of cold sweat dripping down his forehead and he stammered.

None of them dared to get to their feet as they remained on their knees.

“Alright, you can get up. I was merely passing by.” Huang Xiaolong spoke. “I’ll stay here for a few days before leaving. I wish to ask you about some matters.”

Wang Jingwen and the others bowed before getting up. They heaved a sigh of relief when they realized that Huang Xiaolong meant them no harm.

Sitting down in Wang Jingwen’s original seat, Huang Xiaolong started to ask about matters regarding the Immortal World.

Wang Jingweng might only be at the Golden Immortal Realm, but he knew many things due to his position as the patriarch of the Wind and Lightning Immortal Gate.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

From Wang Jingwen, Huang Xiaolong learned the cultivation realms of the Immortal World. One would be a Heavenly Immortal, Divine Immortal, Mysterious Immortal, Golden Immortal, Supreme Golden Immortal, Grand Gathering Immortal, Immortal King, Supreme Immortal, Holy Emperor, Combined Dao Ancestor, and finally, a God of Creation!

Currently, Holy Emperors were nowhere to be seen and Combined Dao Ancestors were hiding in seclusion. The strongest experts were Supreme Immortals!

An existence at that level would be standing at the peak of the Immortal World!

There were countless regions in the Eastern Dongsheng Continent and they were in a tiny part called the Northern Dragon Region.

As for the continents of the Immortal World, they were split into 5 great continents. There was the Eastern Dongsheng Continent, Western Niuhe Continent, Southern Shanbu Continent, Northern Julu Continent, and the Central Tianlu Continent.

“Is the Shushan Immortal Gate really strong?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

He heard everything they spoke of before.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in shock, Wang Jingwen replied respectfully, “Yes. The Shushan Immortal Gate is the strongest faction in the Northern Dragon Region. Even if the emperor of the Misty Immortal Country ran into the patriarch of the Shushan Immortal Gate, he would have to kneel respectfully. I heard that the ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate is an expert at the high-level Grand Gathering Immortal Realm! He ascended from a place called ‘Earth’ countless years ago!
