Chapter 2175: The Heavenly Terror Ruler Flees In Defeat

Everyone’s faces were full of disbelief seeing the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng sent flying by the four divine fires.

When he crashed to the ground, the armor on his body was burning with four different colors of fire.

The Heavenly Terror Ruler screamed and yelled in panic. A bright light surged from his body as he circulated his godforce to the extreme to extinguish the four fires yet the four colors of fires were stuck on him like parasites. He couldn’t shake them off at all.

In the end, Dong Cheng could only abandon the armor on his body, while Huang Xiaolong directed the four divine fires to continue attacking Dong Cheng.

After seeing the four divine fires once again fall on him, there was horror on Dong Cheng’s face, and he dodged in a fluster. But he soon noticed that the four divine fires were chasing him under Huang Xiaolong’s control.

No matter what he did, or how hard he tried to outrun the four divine fires with the law of space, the four divine fires always caught up to him.

Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng’s Unbreakable Divine Shield blocked in front of him once again. When the four divine fires slammed onto the shield again, four obvious dents appeared on the dimmed blue shield!

The Unbreakable Divine Shield’s remaining dim glow vanished completely, leaving a dull black shield that was no better than scrap metal.

The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng’s expression was ugly and fearful at the same time.

“What exactly are these fires?!”

“F*ck, what fires are these! Huang Xiaolong, let’s make peace!”

Make peace?! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Experts of the Heavenly Terror Country and Heavenly World exchanged bewildered gazes.

Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly and continued to spur the four divine fires to attack the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng.

A few minutes later, the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng had exhausted four more divine armors and three defensive supreme spiritual artifacts before fleeing with his tail between his legs. He ripped the Heavenly Saint Country’s space and escaped out of sight.

Upon witnessing the entire process of their Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng being chased all around to the point of being forced to flee in desperation, all the Heavenly Terror Country and Heavenly World’s experts despaired. The impact of the sudden turn of events was too big. When Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng had summoned the Golden Pig Treasure and taken away Huang Xiaolong’s lightning bead, all the Heavenly Terror Country’s experts had thought that Huang Xiaolong’s defeat was written in stone. Who would have thought that Huang Xiaolong would have those four weird divine fires, turning the entire situation to his advantage?

Until Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng escaped out of sight, most of the Heavenly Terror Country and Heavenly World’s experts were still in a daze.

A few breaths later, they finally reacted and started escaping in various directions.

Without needing Huang Xiaolong to issue any order, the Heavenly Saint Ruler had already led the Heavenly Saint Country’s experts, disciples, and guards in a mad retaliation against the two forces’ experts.

Because the Heavenly Terror Ruler was desperate to flee from the four divine fires’ pursuit, he forgot to retrieve the Golden Pig Treasure. When the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng escaped, the Golden Pig Treasure turned into a streak of golden light, preparing to escape. However, how could Huang Xiaolong let the Golden Pig Treasure run away?

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong blocked the Golden Pig Treasure’s path.

“Little guy, you still have something in your mouth that belongs to me.” Huang Xiaolong smiled amiably as he spoke, referring to the lightning bead inside the Golden Pig Treasure.

As if it could understand Huang Xiaolong’s words, the Golden Pig Treasure opened its mouth and spit out the lightning bead to Huang Xiaolong. Its innocent and pitiful eyes stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s smile deepened as he asked, "Are saying that this matter is not related to you, and you want me to let you go?"

The golden pig smiled, nodding its head.

But Huang Xiaolong shook his head in the next second, “That doesn’t work.”

The golden pig’s smile froze on its face.

“I can spare you since your master has fled, but you will follow me from now on.”

Huang Xiaolong blinked at the golden pig.

Huang Xiaolong had just finished stating his term when the golden pig turned into a streak of light, attempting to escape by tearing through space.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong reached out as if he had expected that the golden pig would try to make a run for it. Almost instantly, the suction force from his hand pulled the golden pig back towards him. He added a few restrictions on the golden pig to prevent it from running away before throwing it into the Heavenly Hall.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong disappeared from the spot in a flicker. When he appeared again, he was right in front of the Heavenly Master.

At this point, the Heavenly Master and several Heavenly World’s experts had reached the edge of the Heavenly Saint Country’s boundary. They were about to escape when a shadow flickered in front of them. To their horror, Huang Xiaolong was blocking their path.

“My advice is not to do any futile resistance.” Huang Xiaolong stated matter-of-factly.

The several Heavenly World’s experts suddenly rushed towards Huang Xiaolong as violent energy surged from their bodies. These people had actually decided to explode themselves and kill Huang Xiaolong on the spot.

“Your Majesty, leave quickly!” The few of them shouted.

Unfortunately, before they could reach Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong’s lightning bead flew out, emitting roiling lightning qi that submerged all of them.

In this split second, the Heavenly Master tore the Heavenly Saint Country’s boundary barrier and escaped from the Heavenly Saint Country.

Huang Xiaolong let out a contemptuous harrumph and chased after him in a flash.

Earlier, Huang Xiaolong’s palm strike had left a gaping hole in the Heavenly Master’s chest, but the Heavenly Master’s injuries had healed completely once again. Most likely the Heavenly Master had swallowed another Origin Boundary Pill.

Despite the Heavenly Master’s speedy and completely healed injuries, it didn’t take long for Huang Xiaolong to catch up to him.

Huang Xiaolong successfully blocked in front of the Heavenly Master, standing calmly with his hands clasped behind his back. “It looks like you have quite a few Origin Boundary Pill on you.”

The Heavenly Master looked warily at Huang Xiaolong and his nerves strung high. “Huang Xiaolong, as long as you let me go today, I will give you all my Origin Boundary Pill”

Huang Xiaolong smiled, shaking his head. “Heavenly Master, it looks like you still haven’t understood your situation.”

The Heavenly Master must die today!

Just as Huang Xiaolong finished speaking, the Heavenly Master roared, the God Burying Coffin appeared in his hand again. He pushed the God Burying Coffin towards Huang Xiaolong with a murderous aura.

Huang Xiaolong directly punched at the God Burying Coffin with his full force, smashing the God Burying Coffin into the air. In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong moved, closing in the distance between him and the Heavenly Master, and struck out another punch. His fist punched a hole through the Heavenly Master’s body.

......

A few minutes later.

Huang Xiaolong picked up the half-dead Heavenly Master, and restrained his godforce. After that, he flew back to the Heavenly Saint Country. He was carrying the Heavenly Master in one hand and the God Burying Coffin in the other.

The Heavenly Terror Country’s and Heavenly World’s experts were still resisting with all their might when Huang Xiaolong returned to the Heavenly Saint Country. His figure blurred, flickering amongst these two forces experts. He left behind a trail of falling experts from the other party.

When all the Heavenly Terror Country and Heavenly World’s experts had lost the strength to battle, Huang Xiaolong stopped and said to Heavenly Saint Country’s experts, “Accept those who surrender, and kill those who resist!”

“Yes, Lord!” Huang Xiaolong made his way to the Heavenly Saint Celestial Palace with the Heavenly Master and God Burying Coffin. In the hall, he sat in a cross-legged posture. He grabbed the Heavenly Master, and began reading through his memories.

He hadn’t immediately killed the Heavenly Master just to obtain his memories.

The Heavenly Master struggled fiercely, shrieking sharply, “Huang Xiaolong, even if I die and turn into a ghost, I won’t forgive you! I will hunt you down!”

Huang Xiaolong ignored him and continued going through his memories.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong found out how the Heavenly Master had got the God Burying Coffin.Not only that, but he also learned a lot of information related to the Heavenly Terror Country and the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng’s secrets.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong also got a lot of information about the heaven beyond heavens space.

The Heavenly Master and Heavenly Terror Ruler had ventured to heaven beyond heavens space several times.

“The Lightning Origin Divine Tree!” Huang Xiaolong was tempted immediately.
