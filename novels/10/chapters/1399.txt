Song Rui sneered, “That’s right! He is an idiot for paying three million high grade-seven spirit stones for several hundred pieces of space velocity stones. Everyone would think that punk is a big idiot when the word spreads outside. I really don’t know which family’s young master that punk is, but his elders at his home would die in anger when they hear about this!”

Gudu Yue laughed dryly but the sharp gleam in his eyes was unmistakable. “That kid actually has so many high grade-seven spirit stones on him!” The sharp gleam turned into greed.

Song Rui commented, “But since he has already spent three million, probably there isn’t much left.”

Gudu Yue nodded in agreement.

The auction continued.

More than a dozen items were auctioned off, and finally, it was time for the two last items to be auctioned. These were none other than the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits and Thunderstorm Divine Robe!

The Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits were going to be auctioned first out of the two items.

The auction hall’s staff carried a crystal ball containing more than a dozen of Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits to the auction stage.

The sea-blue crystal box was made of ice-essence crystal to preserve these Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits’ fire element spiritual energy.

Eighteen Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits enshrouded in swaying flames were visible to the audience the moment the restrictions on the crystal box were lifted. Above each fruit was a coiling fire phoenix.

These fire phoenixes were formed from years of the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits’ fire element spiritual energy accumulation.

"Our next auction item is one of the seven wonder fruits of the world, the third ranked Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits. It can temper your physique, godhead, and even your avatar. On top of that, this fruit can improve your unique bloodline and raise it’s power!" Luo Fan explained, and went on, "Of course, there are many more magical benefits of consuming the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit. According to an old legend, it would become easier to break through to God King Realm after consuming it!”

Easier to breakthrough to God King Realm!

This immediately stirred the crowd’s emotions.

The eyes of all the Ancestor God Realm disciples shone green at that thought. Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but sit a little straighter.

The Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits actually have such a wonderful effect?!

Luo Fan fanned the crowd’s excitement further by mentioning more miraculous benefits of consuming the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits. However, he always stressed that it was ‘according to a legend.’

Many of the magical benefits of this rank three Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruit came from age-old rumors.

After all, only a handful of people had consumed these fruits.

“Let us begin auctioning these Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits. The starting price is three million low grade-seven spirit stones!” Luo Fan went on, “Now, please make your offer!”

Three million low grade-seven spirit stones!

That is just the starting price!

Some families’ disciples who had been fantasizing their glories a few moments ago, saw their fantasy shattered before their eyes, as their feet went cold.

Inside private room number five, Gudu Yue couldn’t stop showing excitement on his face. His current cultivation was at Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. But he believed that he would be able to break through to peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm once he would get accepted into the Solitude Emperor Palace and receive the Solitude Emperor Palace’s cultivation. At that time, consuming these Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits would help him to successfully break through to God King Realm!

A God King!

The more Gudu Yue thought about it, the more excited he became. In truth, he was bellowing with excitement in his heart, ‘These Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits are mine! Mine! No one can take them away!’

Driven by his excitement, Gudu Yue impulsively called out, “One million high grade-seven spirit stones!”

According to the spirit stones exchange rate, one million high grade-seven spirit stones were equivalent to two million mid grade-seven spirit stones, and accordingly, four million low grade-seven spirit stones.

Hence, Gudu Yue had raised the price by one million low grade-seven spirit stones.

“1.1 million high grade-seven spirit stones!” Moments later, a voice sounded from private room number one.

“1.2 million high grade-seven spirit stones!” A voice came from private room number three.

For a moment, there were voices calling out bids from various private rooms.

The price rose by a hundred thousand with each increment. In a short few minutes, the price had gone up to two million high grade-seven spirit stones!

At two million point, these people finally calmed down from their fervor, and grew cautious in calling out bids, increasing the bid by merely ten thousand, twenty thousand, or thirty thousand.

The feverish light in Gudu Yue’s eyes also dimmed a little.

Even so, the price had risen to three million.

Three million high grade-seven spirit stones were already four times higher than the starting price. Now everyone was more cautious with each bid. In the beginning, the price had risen exponentially in a few seconds, but at three million point, each bid had an interval of three to four minutes.

Huang Xiaolong had remained silent since the start of the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits’ auction.

Another few minutes passed, and the bid rose to 3.5 million.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to call out his bid for the first time, the little cow suddenly cut him off and said, “Xiaolong, let this cow make the bid for you.”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised but still nodded in agreement.

“What’s your maximum budget for this item?” The little cow asked.

“Within ten million.” Huang Xiaolong answered.

The moment Huang Xiaolong’s voice fell, the little cow stood up. She shook her butt and puffed her chest, and shouted with dominance, “Ten million high grade-seven spirit stones!”

Her voice rumbled through the auction hall, dizzying the people around; some even fell off their chairs.

Waves of shock struck everyone’s heads, as they were filled with disbelief. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“T... ten, ten million, high grade-seven spirit stones!” A High Martial World’s first-rank force’s Patriarch repeated with a stiff tongue.

Gudu Yue, who had made the bid for 3.5 million, quivered subconsciously when he heard the little cow’s ‘ten million high grade-seven spirit stones’ from private room number six.

Dead silence...!

Time seemed to freeze as eyes were fixed on private room number six.

Even the veteran auctioneer Luo Fan’s mind went blank from shock.

Whereas Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless as he looked at the little cow’s ‘domineering posture.’ Even though his budget was ten million, was it necessary to throw his highest limit? Wouldn’t it be better if he could buy it at five million? One should be thrifty when they could. After all, ten million high grade-seven spirit stones had taken him one hundred hours to condense them ah.

Noticing Huang Xiaolong’s darkened expression, the little cow looked at him innocently. “Why would you want to waste time with them? Look, ten million saves you a lot of trouble,and everything is settled in a second!”

“Eleven million high grade-seven spirit stones!” Right at this time, a voice called out from private room number seven, which was right next to Huang Xiaolong’s private room.

The little cow looked wide-eyed silly.

Huang Xiaolong burst out laughing at her expression.

Xiang Xun, Feng Er, and others snickered, except the void devil beast Xu Baisheng, who did not dare to laugh at the little cow for the sake of his butt.

“Xiaoniu, looks like your ten million can’t get the job done.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The little cow argued sadly, “I’m old now, not as domineering as others.”

The others in the room laughed again.

Inside the private room number seven, there was a pretty young lady who was exuding a noble air. Behind her stood two old women who had no presence at all, and it was as if they were dead. But a great expert could tell that these two old women were powerful experts.

“In truth, given Miss’ aptitude, you can smoothly break through to God King Realm in a few years, even without the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits.” One of the old women stated.

The pretty young lady smiled. “Old Tong, these Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits must be very tasty. I haven’t eaten them before.”

Seemingly, this young lady wanted to buy the Flaming White Phoenix Divine Fruits merely because she wanted to taste them...
