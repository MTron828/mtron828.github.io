Chapter 178: Imperial City Battle (10)

Yanggang let out an animalistic roar towards the sky, and once again a dark energy intertwining with an icy blue spread out in four directions from Yanggang’s body as he summoned his martial spirit, the Celestial Yin Beast.

As the Celestial Yin Beast emerged and hovered behind Yanggang, the blood stain on Yanggang’s lips disappeared.

However, for a fleeting second, a faint pink had colored his cheeks as he recalled what he said earlier. He wasn’t going to use his martial spirit and even generously granted Huang Xiaolong the first move!

He was now basically eating his own words. Yanggang slowly raised his head, his venomous eyes falling on Huang Xiaolong as they filled with hatred and an intense killing intent.

In the next moment, Yanggang fused with the Celestial Yin Beast and soul transformed.

Although one’s martial spirit could solidify their ethereal selves into a corporeal entity after entering the Xiantian realm and battle as is, most warriors would choose to soul transform. After a soul transformation, the owner would receive a much higher boost in strength, among multiple other aspects.

Yanggang’s body flickered the instant he soul transformed. His entire being seemed to evolve into a dark energy, drifting in Huang Xiaolong’s direction yet arriving almost simultaneously. The increase in speed was astounding, surpassing the level Huang Xiaolong had shown earlier while using his Phantom Shadow ability.

Arriving in front of Huang Xiaolong, a cruel bloodlust of scarlet red gleam flitted across Yanggang’s eyes, slamming his palms right into Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

“Withering Bloom Palm!”

Dark energy trailed behind, enveloping Yanggang’s palms as they struck with an icy blue glow that reflected in-between the darkness.

This was the energy of Yin and darkness. The darkness energy of a Celestial Yin Beast was regarded as the coldest and most poisonous energy that existed between heaven and earth.

After Yanggang soul transformed, he used the celestial Yin energy that was unique to the Celestial Yin Beast and Withering Bloom Palm which was a high mid-grade Earth rank battle skill comparable to some high-grade Earth rank battle skill.

Yanggang used one of his trump cards, aiming to send Huang Xiaolong flying with one strike just like he did to him. Only by doing so could he wash away the humiliation he felt!

The surrounding airflow stagnated as it became affected by the Withering Bloom Palm.

Just when Yanggang was confident his attack would hit Huang Xiaolong’s chest, Huang Xiaolong raised his arms, countering with two palms of his own.

Boom! A resounding collision echoed from the stage as their four palms slammed against each other.

Huang Xiaolong swayed, wobbling two steps back.

When he steadied himself, Huang Xiaolong noticed that a layer of dark black ice had formed on his palms. At the same time, an icy blue energy seeped through the skin of his palms and entered his veins and meridians, trying to invade his body.

Seeing this, Yanggang sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re actually quite stupid to have taken my Withering Blossom Palm with your bare hands. Let me enlighten you, my celestial Yin energy will flow into your body along the veins and meridians of your palms. As the energy increases and accumulates, you will gradually realize that your entire body’s veins, meridians, and blood will solidify into ice. Once it invades your internal organs it will feel like millions of ants biting all over, the pain will be pleasurable for you!”

“Enjoy it while it lasts!”

After generously departing with this information, Yanggang broke out in a hearty laughter mixed with elation and it reverberated in the air.

Below the stage many were still dazed due to shock. Looking at the result, heads shook in pity.

“This Huang Xiaolong is too careless, now that Yanggang’s celestial Yin energy is going to destroy his body, he has no hope of winning!

The celestial Yin energy is the coldest and most poisonous energy. Even a Xiantian Third Order expert would be in a bind trying to expel it from his body!”

“Serves him right! He must have thought he would win the battle ‘cause he managed to knock Yanggang down with one punch. That’s why he was careless!”

Voices rose and fell, lamenting Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance and mistake, while there were also people that gloated at his predicament.

On the main guest platform, Duan Wuhen and Cheng Jian could not help but frown.

Despite the many different reactions thrown his way, Huang Xiaolong remained calm. A burst of inky purple light enveloped Huang Xiaolong and both of his palms quivered slightly. The black ice formed on his palms shattered into particles and fell down whereas inside his body, when Yanggang’s celestial Yin energy met with the same inky purple energy, it was swallowed up by the tyrannical inky-purple energy in Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Watching the sudden turn of events, the people below the stage and the crowd suddenly exclaimed in surprise and bafflement.

The celestial Yin energy was known as the coldest and most poisonous energy, yet Huang Xiaolong treated it as nothing!

Duan Wuhen squinted his eyes as he stared at the inky purple glow flowing out from Huang Xiaolong’s body and deeply pondered over it.

“What kind of battle qi is this?” Even Cheng Jian could not hide the surprise and curiosity from his voice.

Back on the stage, Yanggang’s complacent laughter stifled abruptly.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the other side, apologizing in a ‘modest’ manner, “My apologies, it seems your celestial Yin energy is useless against me!”

Yanggang’s face turned unsightly.

At that moment, a similar pool of dark black energy enveloped Huang Xiaolong’s body and before everyone’s bewildered eyes, turned into a pair of ebony wings. The white in his eyes was overtaken by a crimson color, making him appear bloodthirsty. His black hair turned completely white, starting from the roots and cascaded all the way down to the ends of Huang Xiaolong’s long hair, flying upward as if it were defying gravity.

A heavy atmosphere of slaughter broke out from Huang Xiaolong, sweeping out to the entire Duanren Square.

Everyone’s heart tightened.

“A very strong aura of slaughter!” Xie Puti muttered and his eyes narrowed solemnly.

“What battle skill is this? He can change his physique without soul transforming?!” On the main platform, Cheng Jian’s eyes flashed.

Duan Wuhen did not speak, but the way he looked at Huang Xiaolong had taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn.

Terror seized Yanggang as he watched the changes happening to Huang Xiaolong, he strongly felt the terrifying rise in Huang Xiaolong’s strength compared to before, and that thick aura of slaughter actually sent a chill all the way down to his core.

Suddenly, the Wings of Demon behind Huang Xiaolong extended and with a flap he reached Yanggang. The Blades of Asura in his hands reflected a cold glint as they swung out.

“Tempest of Hell!”

Huang Xiaolong’s icy voice rippled above Duanren Square’s void.

Dozens of cold blade lights appeared out of nowhere, gathering into two turbulent gales, spinning towards Yanggang.

Whimpers and cries originating from hell echoed from the stage.

Listening to the eerie cries, emotions of fear and terror inexplicably rose in everyone’s heart. They were filled with panic, trepidation, and apprehension, causing them extreme discomfort.

Looking at the impending violent wind vortexes, Yanggang’s pupils dilated in horror. Completely spooked, he continuously retreated backwards while throwing frenzied frontal attacks with the Withering Bloom Palm.

Under the barrage of attacks from Yanggang, airflow became stagnated due to the freezing energy, successfully slowing the two Tempest of Hell’s speed.

Just when Yanggang was about to breathe out in relief, Huang Xiaolong leaped up, once again swinging the Blades of Asura. It was still the Tempest of Hell, however this time there was a combination of Tempest of Hell and Tears of Asura!

The howling cries of an Asura from hell pierced the square.

Yanggang was struck with terror as he stumbled backward, retreating again and again. Unknowingly, he had reached the edge of the battle stage.

“Celestial Yin Body!” All of a sudden, Yanggang bellowed. The surface of his skin was covered with a layer of ice blue film. Shockingly, his entire body softened limply as if there were no bones supporting him, barely aiding him in dodging Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

The Celestial Yin Body was Yanggang’s martial spirit ability. When displayed, his entire body became so soft that it was like he lacked any bones.

Huang Xiaolong was not surprised when seeing Yanggang successfully avoid his attack. If Yanggang was someone so easily defeated, then rumors would not pin him as the most likely candidate to win second place this year.

After he escaped Huang Xiaolong’s attack, Yanggang twisted his body and lunged onto Huang Xiaolong. No one noticed when Yanggang had withdrawn the short blade in his hand.

The short blade in Yanggang’s grip was a pure blood-red color. It was slim and narrow, and an image of a black skull could be seen on the blade’s body. When Yanggang slashed the short blade towards Huang Xiaolong, it emitted a disgusting foul scent akin to a corpse that had been rotting for a very long time, nauseating the senses.

Huang Xiaolong waved the Blades of Asura, sparks flew from the blades friction. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After one exchange, both of them jumped back in retreat at the same time.

In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette blurred, reappearing in midair. His body started to rotate at great speed while the Blades of Asura swung out continuously, covering the entire stage in the State of Abundant Lightning attack area, striking with the wrath of a devil.
