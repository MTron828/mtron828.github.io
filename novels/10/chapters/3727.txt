Chapter 3728: Item in the Lake

Yang Dingsheng’s expression changed and he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong like a pitiful kid who was wronged.

Huang Xiaolong casually sent a punch towards the flying ship.

Boom!

The punch shattered the ship completely! Whatever was left of the Golden Phoenix Flying Ship that was soaring through the skies ground to a complete halt. With a single punch, Huang Xiaolong shattered the eye of the formation powering the ship and some!

The experts of the Golden Phoenix Race came tumbling out of the ship, including ancient ancestor, Huang Ruocheng.

The faces of everyone present changed.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong shattered the crown prince’s legs easily and that caused everyone’s evaluation of his strength to increase. Now, they became even more wary of Huang Xiaolong.

It seemed as though he wasn’t as weak as they thought!

“If you dare to harm anyone related to Yang Dingsheng when you return, I’ll kill my way into your territory!” Huang Xiaolong growled. “Leave the ship. All of you can fly back on your own.”

The experts of the Golden Phoenix Race glared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

“How dare you?!” one of the ancient ancestors roared. However, the crown prince stopped the man and endured the humiliation. “Alright. I will remember what you said here today.”

“We’re leaving!”

Leaving the ship behind, they flew towards the entrance of the White Deer Cave.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong’s punch destroyed the formation on the ship completely. They couldn’t drive it away even if they wanted to.

Those standing around looked at each other when they saw the members of the Golden Phoenix Race leaving with their tails tucked between their legs. Many people thought of leaving, but the temptation of obtaining the item in the lake was too much!

Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them. As long as they didn’t approach the lake, he was too lazy to deal with them.

He could tell that Yang Dingsheng was still troubled by the threat of the Golden Phoenix Race, and he couldn’t help but sigh, “Brother Yang, there’s no need to worry. I’ll return to the Fortune Space with you in the future. The Golden Phoenix Crown Prince wouldn’t dare to harm anyone from the Yang Lightning Race.”

Heaving a sigh of relief, Yang Dingsheng thanked, “Thank you, Brother Huang…”

Huang Xiaolong patted Yang Dingsheng’s shoulders several times before turning to look at the lake.

The White Deer finally piped up, “Hey, you already got the Universe Source Stone. Leave this treasure for me!”

The experts turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a burning gaze.

Huang Xiaolong has a piece of Universe Source Stone?!

Knowing that the White Deer did it on purpose, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered by its little plans. “I was planning to give the item under the lake to you, but I changed my mind because of what you said.”

“I’m definitely grabbing whatever appears.”

Huang Xiaolong’s voice was firm.

As an awkward expression appeared on its face, the White Deer sighed, “I… I didn’t mean to reveal your secret to everyone! I…”

“Actually, I can give you whatever lies below this lake.” Huang Xiaolong grinned. “As long as you become my mount, you can have it!”

“Bullsh*t!” A look of rage appeared on the White Deer’s face. “If you bring this up again, you can’t blame me for what I’ll do…”

“What do you think you can do?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

The White Deer might be strong, but it was comparable to the White Feather King at best. Both of them knew what happened when Huang Xiaolong fought with the White Feather King.

As the White Deer’s face turned completely red, it glared at Huang Xiaolong without saying another word.

Huang Xiaolong was right. It couldn’t do anything!

“Lord Cao Cheng, if the brat really has the Universe Source Stone, this is great news!” someone whispered to Cao Cheng.

“In the future, he’s going to follow Yang Dingsheng to the Fortune Space. When that happens…”

Cao Cheng felt his heart pumping in excitement.

“I wonder what’s under the lake…” someone else asked. A look of greed flashed through his eyes. “If everyone gets into an all-out brawl, we might stand a chance! No matter how strong he is, he won’t be able to challenge all of us!”

“All of you will play by ear. When an opportunity appears, grab the treasure!”

“Yes, Lord Cao Cheng!”

Huang Xiaolong’s revelation of strength might have caused many of them to hesitate, but they were planning to fish in muddied waters. They would swarm Huang Xiaolong and win with sheer numbers.

All of them thought the same way.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong noticed everything. Too lazy to bother with them, he continued to look at the lake.

Time ticked by and the white glow above the lake became more and more intense.

The white light soon covered the entire continent.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Under the illumination, the white continent became even more vibrant.

An hour passed in the blink of an eye…

A massive blast broke the silence and a massive wall of water burst out from the middle of the lake. A white flower slowly rose towards the skies.

The white flower emitted brilliant rays of light that seemed to contain all the colors in the world. They were so interconnected that they looked completely white. When looking at it from afar, it looked like a snow-white arm!

Everyone was shocked to discover the white flower with an odd appearance.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in shock. Every single petal seemed to contain a great world on its own. The power that was contained within reminded Huang Xiaolong of the Universe Source Stone.

When Huang Xiaolong was still confused, a figure appeared above the lake. The figure was covered in pure darkness and no one could see his appearance. The only thing they could be sure of was his strength! He was definitely stronger than the Golden Phoenix Crown Prince and Huang Ruocheng!

The moment he appeared, he reached for the white flower. However, a snow-white leg appeared and sent the expert flying.

Yelling in fright, the expert was sent crashing into the edge of the continent. The wound on his chest where the leg landed extended all the way through his back, and his bones were visible to the world. The darkness around him disappeared and his appearance was revealed to the world.

“Black Heart Old Ancestor!” Many people recognized him instantly.

The Black Heart Old Ancestor was one of the strongest and most cruel experts in the Thirteen Universes. The number of people he killed couldn’t be counted, and there were rumors that his heart was pure black in color. That was how he got his title. His strength hovered around the 25 billion mark and even the old ancestor of the Dazzling Black Race would have to retreat in terror in the face of the Black Heart Old Ancestor.

Now, he was sent flying by a single kick!

When everyone turned to look at the individual who unleashed the terrifying kick, they were dumbstruck. It was the white deer that followed Huang Xiaolong around!

Those who were hoping to grab the treasure for themselves felt their blood running cold.

Before the White Deer could retrieve the White Flower, an arm reached out to stop it.
