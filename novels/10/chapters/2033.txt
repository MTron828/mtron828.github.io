Chapter 2034: The Whereabouts of the Divine Artifact Devil Stele

Huang Xiaolong and the others stared at Du Hai with a strange look on their faces.

A hundred million per person?

When Du Hai saw the strange expression on their faces, he quickly tried to explain himself. “Old lady, I’m only letting you guys in because of our past relationship! One hundred million is the lowest price. If you can’t take that out, neither you nor the King of Darkness is going in!”

“I know that the both of you will be able to suppress me if you join hands, but Brother Darkness should be suffering from some hidden injury that hasn’t fully recovered. If you really plan on killing your way in, you will need to pay a heavy price. Whatever it is, I’m not bluffing. There are plenty of restrictions in my nest, and countless deadly creatures are roaming around. Even if you go in, you might not find what you’re looking for.”

Du Hai wasn’t scaring the both of them. It was true. Ever since they had hidden themselves in the Devil Abyss, Du Hai had used endless amounts of time and effort to build the place into a fortress. He had personally set the restrictions, and even if the little cow went in with the King of Darkness, their heads would probably explode from all the trouble they would face.

The little cow stared at the King of Darkness. Then, they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in response. “Let’s all take a step back here. I’ll give you a hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones, and all of us get to go in. I’ll also need you to guide us around in order to avoid all the restrictions and traps.”

Du Hai was right. The King of Darkness wasn’t fully recovered, and even if they wanted to kill their way in, they would need to pay a considerable price. The King of Darkness’s condition might even deteriorate.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t want things to go out of hand.

After returning to the Radiance World, he would need the King of Darkness’s assistance to defeat Dun Ei.

If he could avoid getting into a conflict with the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race, Huang Xiaolong would gladly pay up. In order to safely obtain the Divine Artifact Divine Stele, there was no need to mention one hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones. Even if Du Hai asked for more, Huang Xiaolong would be ready to pay him.

“One... one hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones!” Du Hai stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. It was clear that this was the first time he had heard the number ‘one hundred million’ and ‘mid-grade chaos spirit stones’ in the same sentence.

The experts from the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race couldn’t help but stare at Huang Xiaolong with their eyes wide open.

One had to know that one wouldn’t be able to exchange for one hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones even if they had ten billion low-grade ones!

There were really too few mid-grade chaos spirit stones in existence!

When people made transactions in the super auctions, they would use low-grade chaos spirit stones as currency. No one would be willing to take out mid-grade chaos spirit stones! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After recovering from his shock, Du Hai’s eyes spun around and landed on Huang Xiaolong. A brilliant smile appeared on his face, and he said, “I could have never expected you to be a rich lord! I must be blind! However, you have more than four hundred experts here. One hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones are far from enough! How about this. Give me four hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones, and I’ll let you all in!”

Four hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones!

Du Hai was really an expert when it came to extortion.

However, the little cow’s cold laughter broke his fantasies. “Old fogey, do you really think mid-grade chaos spirit stones are like cabbage we can find at the side of the road? Hehe, four hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones... Do you believe that I will offer four hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones to anyone who can exterminate your entire race? I’m sure a huge group of Sovereigns will be running over to accept my offer.”

She was right. With four hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones, even Sovereign Realm experts would be moved. No matter how strong the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race was, there would be someone ready to exterminate them down to the last bug.

Du Hai fell into silence, and a trace of unease flashed through his eyes.

“What? Are you thinking of snatching it?” The little cow laughed as though she had seen Du Hai’s inner thoughts. “Old man, you better get rid of those useless thoughts in your head. If we really wish to, me and Old Black are more than enough to kill you.”

Like thunderclouds clearing up in the sky, the gloominess on Du Hai’s face disappeared. A smile that contained the brilliance of a thousand suns lit his face up, and he said, “Old lady, look at you! I, Du Hai, have always been an upright gentleman. I didn’t say anything even after you killed most of my pets! Alright. Let’s meet in the middle. Two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones. Not a single one less!”

The little cow harrumphed in a cold voice as everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

“Fine.” Huang Xiaolong ‘gnashed’ his teeth and agreed ‘unwillingly.’ However, he continued, “I can only give you one hundred million right now. When I obtain the item I want, I’ll give you the other hundred million.”

A frown formed on Du Hai’s face. “No. I’ll give you ten years. If you can’t find it, you still have to pay up the additional hundred million!”

Ten years!

Huang Xiaolong pretended to think about it for a moment before nodding his head. “Alright, ten years it is!”

Ten years was more than enough for him to locate the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

He was also confident of refining it in ten years!

Before long, the two of them swore an oath to the heavens, and Huang Xiaolong gave Du Hai a hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones.

When Du Hai received the spirit stones, the sincerity in his smile deepened by a whole lot.

He quickly took the role as their guide and led them into the nest of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race.

Even though he had already taken an oath, the little cow and the King of Darkness locked their divine senses on Du Hai in case he tried anything funny.

Despite their actions, Du Hai couldn’t be bothered about them. As soon as they entered the mountain range, he introduced everything to Huang Xiaolong. He even took the time to ‘enlighten’ the little cow and King of Darkness on all the creatures he reared.

Huang Xiaolong circulated the four devil steles as he tried to locate the Divine Artifact Devil Stele as quickly as he could.

With hidden thoughts running through their mind, they ventured deeper and deeper into the mountain range.

When they finally arrived in the depths of the mountain range, Huang Xiaolong’s heart pounded when he saw the terrifying restrictions and creatures hiding when they first entered. He felt as though he had dodged a bullet when he agreed to pay Du Hai off rather than killing his way in. If he had forced his way through, the Emperors from the two emperor countries would probably have died before making it out.

Even if some of them managed to survive, Huang Xiaolong’s forces would have definitely taken a hit.

After an hour, the four devil steles in Huang Xiaolong’s body finally reacted. It seemed as though they were getting closer and closer to the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

They eventually made their way to a massive cliff.

Under the cliff sat a bottomless ravine, and sounds of howling could be heard coming from inside the darkness. Boundless devil qi poured out from the void, and clouds of dense devil qi filled the space around the cliff.

According to what Huang Xiaolong felt, the Divine Artifact Devil Stele was located at the bottom of the ravine.

Seeing as the item Huang Xiaolong wanted to find was located at the bottom of the ravine, Du Hai heaved a sigh of relief. He had tried to explore the bottom of the ravine in the past, but even with his strength, he had failed to arrive at the bottom. If Huang Xiaolong descended and failed to find the item he was looking for, two hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones would be as good as his.
