Chapter 2895: Eye of Frost

“Entering the Dragon Fish Creed?!” The two ladies yelped in unison. They didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong’s request would be just to enter the Dragon Fish Creed.

They felt that Huang Xiaolong would take the chance to raise an ‘unreasonable’ request, but it seemed as though they were wrong!

When they heard his request, Yin Yue’s expression turned a little complicated. “Young Master Huang, I wish to agree, but the Dragon Fish Creed is in lockdown. No one can enter the Dragon Fish Creed without the permission of the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable! I hope you can understand…”

Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of disappointment wash over his heart when he heard her response.

Initially, he had felt that they would be able to get him into the Dragon Fish Creed with their identity as the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World. He hadn’t expected that he would have to obtain the permission of the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable!

If that was the case, even if Long Jianfei regained his status in the Dragon Fish Creed, it would be of no use! Even if his teacher, Chen Xi, appeared to help him, they wouldn’t be able to reach the level of the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable!

Huang Xiaolong failed to contain his disappointment, and Yin Yue hastily apologized, “Young Master Huang, I am really sorry, I…”

“It’s not your fault.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and sighed.

“Perhaps, you can come up with another request.” Yin Yue muttered in a soft voice, “I have a high-grade cosmos armor that can be used in exchange…”

She had managed to obtain the armor only after toeing the line of life and death in one of the forbidden regions out there, and it was one of her most precious treasures.

“There’s no need for that. Helping you is nothing much, and there is no need for a reward.”

Yin Yue sank into silence for a short while after hearing what he said. “Even so, I will forever be thankful to you. The Silver Shadow Creed will remember the favor, and if you wish to request anything of us in the future, we will do everything in our power to fulfil your wish.”

Huang Xiaolong was startled, but he eventually nodded his head helplessly. “Alright then.”

He felt that Yin Yue was really stubborn, but it wasn’t anything bad.

Upon turning to Feng Yue, Huang Xiaolong wondered what she was there for. Yin Yue was there to save her mother, but Feng Yue couldn’t possibly be trying to save someone with his power, right?

Feng Yue stared at Yin Yue for a moment and a strange expression formed on her face.

Noticing the look on her face, Yin Yue took her leave and told Huang Xiaolong that she would be waiting for him outside the main hall of the Dragon Emperor Manor.

After Yin Yue left, Feng Yue laid down a restriction that prevented anyone from hearing their conversation.

Retrieving an icy blue orb of light cautiously, Huang Xiaolong noticed that there were tons of ice-attributed restrictions laid down on it. When the restrictions came together, they seemed to form an ice eyeball.

“This… This is the Eye of Frost!” Feng Yue said.

Eye of Frost? Huang Xiaolong stared at her with question marks popping up in his mind.

From Feng Yue’s expression, Huang Xiaolong could tell that the Eye of Frost was no ordinary treasure. However, this was the first time he was hearing of it ever since he had stepped into the Divine Tuo Holy World.

Feng Yue was stunned when she saw the blank look on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Does Young Master Huang not know what the Eye of Frost is?”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and explained, “It hasn’t been long since I entered the Divine Tuo Holy World. I spent most of my time in one of the creeds in the outer regions of the Divine Tuo Holy World, and I’m not too well informed with the treasures here.”

Feng Yue was shocked. As she stared at the Eye of Frost, the pretty blue light illuminated her face and her beauty, astounding Huang Xiaolong. “The Eye of Frost is the inheritance treasure of the Frost Eye Race! It’s one of the keys to open their treasury!”

“Frost Eye Race?! Are you talking about one of the races formed during the creation of the world?” Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

The races that were formed during the creation of the Divine Tou Holy World were terrifying existences. The Frost Eye Race was one of the strongest factions among them. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, they had fallen from their position, and they had disappeared from the eyes of everyone in the Divine Tuo Holy World after they were invaded by the demons from the Outer Heavens. It had already been several billion years since their disappearance.

Who would have thought that Feng Yue would be in possession of their inheritance treasure!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t imagine how she had got her hands on it.

Also, he wondered about her connection with the Frost Eye Race!

Looking at Huang Xiaolong as though she had predicted his response, she explained, “This is indeed from the Frost Eye Race. However, one can only activate the key if they can control the power of absolute frost!”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled.

He felt that he knew what she was about to say, and he even started thinking of how they should split the loot.

Feng Yue’s soft voice interrupted his train of thoughts. “If Young Master Huang controls the Eye of Frost, we’ll be able to open the treasury left behind by the Frost Eye Race! We can head into the treasury to search for treasures, and Young Master Huang will be able to keep anything you find in the treasury!”

“However, you will only be able to enter alone!” Feng Yue added a term all of a sudden.

A light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he agreed immediately. “Alright!”

There was absolutely no reason for him to turn down such a great opportunity.

When Feng Yue obtained his confirmation, she heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. She was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would start to bargain with her over the matter. After all, the number of people who controlled the power of absolute frost in the Divine Tuo Holy World could be counted on one hand. The best person she could choose to work with was Huang Xiaolong.

After deciding on a time and place to open the treasury, they came to a conclusion that they would open it exactly two years later.

Huang Xiaolong would have to head over to the Silver Shadow Creed to cure Yin Yue’s mother before he could do anything else.

Moreover, he planned to head over to look for the immortal cave located in the Boundary Emperor Creed. After refining the poison contained inside along with the poison in Yin Yue’s mother, his ability to control poison would take a big leap forward!

Huang Xiaolong then decided on a location with Feng Yue.

As for when he would treat Yin Yue’s mother, he set the time to be within the next half of the year.

The two ladies bade their farewells, and they left.

However, Yin Yue handed over a jade pendant that was silver in color to Huang Xiaolong before she left.

“What’s this?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

With her face slowly flushing red, Yin Yue replied, “This is my Silver Moon Pendant. Its presence is equal to mine, and when you head over to the Silver Shadow Creed, you can use it to prove your identity. They will bring you over to meet me as soon as you show the pendant.”

Of course, there was another meaning behind giving him the pendant…

There were two Silver Moon Pendants, and the meaning behind it should be obvious.

Too lazy to think about anything else, Huang Xiaolong accepted the pendant, and he laughed, “Alright! There should be a ton of disciples trying to meet Young Lady Yin Yue. With this pendant, I won’t be mistaken for those young masters trying to get lucky!”

A shy giggle escaped her lips when she heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Young Master Huang must be joking! Not a single disciple of the Silver Shadow Creed will dare to disrespect Young Master Huang!”

The expression on Feng Yue’s face turned extremely complicated when she noticed that Yin Yue had given him a Silver Moon Pendant. However, she chose to remain silent.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong managed to send them away.
