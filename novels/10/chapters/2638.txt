Chapter 2639: Toad!

The happenings from at the trading market soon reached Feitian Longpeng and Fei Yanzi.

Feitian Jin wanted to gather the Eminent Elders to lodge a report on Huang Xiaolong. At the same time, they wanted to request Fei Yanzi to deal with Huang Xiaolong! However, they were sent away after a vicious scolding from Fei Yanzi.

That wasn’t all, but Feitian Jin was brought over by Fei Yanzi to apologize to Huang Xiaolong. She made him kneel before Huang Xiaolong after bringing out Feitian Zhan’s holy soul. As for Feitian Qingyi and the others, they were thrown over for Huang Xiaolong to deal with them as he pleased.

After considering his relationship with Feitian Longpeng, Huang Xiaolong decided to let them off.

Even though Huang Xiaolong let them off without any punishment, their hatred for Huang Xiaolong pierced through the roof after they returned.

As soon as they returned to Feitian Jin’s cultivation palace, Feitian Jin shattered one of the jade ornaments decorating the hall.

“I won’t be able to vent the anger in my heart without killing that brat!” Feitian Jin roared.

When Yuan Wangfeng had contacted him and Feitian Cheng in secret previously, he had requested that they capture Huang Xiaolong with the Flying Heaven Grand Formation. He had agreed as they had promised him a ton of compensation, but he no longer cared about that. Even without their deal, he would do his best to capture Huang Xiaolong. No, it was better to say that he wanted nothing more than to kill Huang Xiaolong! With or without the help of the Myriad Origin Race, he would stop at nothing to kill the brat!

“Huang Xiaolong! I’ll let you live for a little more!” he snarled.

Four days later, the Eminent Elders would lure Fei Yanzi away! As long as Huang Xiaolong didn’t receive Fei Yanzi’s protection, they felt that the plan to capture him with the Flying Heaven Grand Formation would go without a hitch! The moment they activated the formation, he would be completely helpless!

The days passed quickly, and the day of the plan arrived.

Huang Xiaolong was sitting in the inner hall with Hei Luo beside him, and they were both submerged in their cultivation.

Several days ago, Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain several undead spiritual holy stones, and he had passed them over to Hei Luo immediately. With their assistance, Hei Luo’s injury had healed at a frightening pace. Meanwhile, with Huang Xiaolong absorbing holy spiritual qi and the grand dao beside him, he had also managed to benefit slightly.

All of a sudden, a disciple of the Flying Heaven Race entered the hall and announced the arrival of Eminent Elder Feitian Cheng and Feitian Jin. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was soon disrupted.

“Why are they here to pay me a visit?” Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of suspicion rising in his heart. However, he finally decided to greet them.

Entering the other hall, Huang Xiaolong saw the two of them. Their attitude towards him was enthusiastic, to say the least, and they were being extremely respectful. They threw out a lot of praises before finally getting to the topic. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Are we really heading over to open the hidden treasury tonight?” Huang Xiaolong frowned. “Is this your Matriarch’s decision?”

“Of course! She has said that the earlier we manage to open the hidden treasury, the better it will be for everyone! After all, we can only rest easy after obtaining the treasures in the hidden treasury!” Feitian Jin lied without batting an eyelid. “Moreover, the hidden treasury is covered in frigid qi all year round. The frigid qi will be at its weakest tonight, and our matriarch decided to bring forward our plans.”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong stared at the two of them and a sneer formed in his heart.

Feitian Cheng hastily added, “Our Matriarch was planning to tell you personally, but something came up, and she needed to brief our Young Patriarch about some matters concerning the race. So we are here in her stead.”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head ‘seriously.’

After the two of them sat for a little longer, they took their leave.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned cold the moment they left. Their excuse was subpar at best, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be more doubtful of their words. If Fei Yanzi really wanted to open the hidden treasury earlier, she would have appeared personally. The most important thing to the Flying Heaven Race was the artifacts and treasures in the hidden treasury! Why would she brief Feitian Longpeng about other matters?

There was no way he believed their words.

However, he was really curious about their plan.

With the power he possessed, there was no need for him to bother with their petty tricks. Moreover, he had the Inextinguishable Dao Heart. No amount of scheming could stand up to absolute power! Those who schemed against him were nothing more than clowns.

After returning to the inner hall, Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate.

Very quickly, night fell.

As darkness covered the lands, Feitian Cheng and Feitian Jin soon arrived to escort Huang Xiaolong towards the ‘hidden treasury.’ Their minds were trembling as they were afraid of raising suspicion. However, there was also a trace of joy hidden in their eyes.

“Your Highness, please!”

With the two of them leading the way, Huang Xiaolong left his palace.

Flying ahead of Huang Xiaolong, the two of them led him towards the restricted area of the Flying Heaven Race.

Even though the hidden treasure was located in the restricted region, the heart of the grand formation was also located nearby.

“Where’s your Matriarch?” Huang Xiaolong casually asked.

“She is currently waiting for Your Highness at the hidden treasury!” Feitian Jin replied hastily, “According to her orders, we have already prepared a banquet for Your Highness after you successfully open the hidden treasury!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, and he chuckled under his breath.

The further they ventured into the restricted area, the colder it became.

Of course, the road became darker and darker, and it felt as though there was something covering his vision.

“This is the void devil frigid qi that covers our restricted area,” Feitian Jin explained.

“I know about the void devil frigid qi. There is no need for Eminent Elder Jin to explain it to me,” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

“Yes, yes, yes. I didn’t think that through. With Your Highness’ vast experience, why would you not know about the void devil frigid qi that surrounds our restricted area?”

As they chatted ‘casually’ for more than an hour and used various topics to ‘distract’ Huang Xiaolong, they finally arrived at the heart of the formation.

A sigh of relief escaped their lips when they arrived at the heart of the formation. They were finally able to relax their tense minds as they were afraid that Huang Xiaolong would discover something was off about them along the way.

They stopped in their tracks and, their gazes turned cold as they glared at Huang Xiaolong. Simultaneously, the killing intent in their heart was released.

“This…?” Huang Xiaolong pretended to be clueless as he asked about their sudden change in behavior.

“Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would meet a sorry end at our hands? You dared to shatter my son’s physical body! Tonight, I shall shatter your physical body and allow you to experience the pain he felt! You’ll wish you were dead!” Feitian Jin roared in anger.

“Weren’t we going to open the hidden treasury?” Huang Xiaolong’s expression ‘sank’ as he tried to control himself from bursting out in laughter.

Feitian Cheng couldn’t help but laugh when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s expression of confusion. “Opening the Flying Heaven Hidden Treasury? Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are? How dare you covet our treasures? Look in the mirror to observe the piece of sh*t you really are! Are you fit to possess the treasures our old ancestor left behind?”

“Where’s your Matriarch? I wish to see her.” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Brat, do you really think that your little actions can be hidden from us? You’re just a toad lusting over a swan’s flesh! No! You’re a disgusting toad from the human race! If you wish to meet our matriarch, pray that you reincarnate as a god of our Alien Race!”
