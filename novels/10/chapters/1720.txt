If something was troubling Huang Xiaolong, it was definitely something that had to do with the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Disciple, Fang Mingyu.

Before coming to Hell, he had promised Fang Xuanxuan that he would look for her older brother.

Even though Fang Gan hadn’t said anything regarding this, Huang Xiaolong was sure that it was his intention as well.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong had to exert all his effort into finding Fang Mingyu no matter what! He had finally obtained news about Fang Mingyu! He was in the Spirits World!

Even though the Spirits World was extensive, he was sure that he would locate Fang Mingyu as long as he did not give up!

He had also obtained news about the grandmist aura! Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised.

Even though his strength had soared after entering Hell, the Grandmist Parasitic Medium had been stuck in the third level, and he was unable to break through to the fourth level no matter how hard he tried. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Now that he knew about the possibility of finding a trace of grandmist aura in the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury, he had to make a trip to the Spirits World no matter what.

“Spirits World.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the Heavenly Hall, and he flew towards the entrance of the cave.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong saw the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

“Your Majesty.” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin welcomed Huang Xiaolong with a face full of joy.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Have you been waiting for a long time?” He then threw a chaos spiritual fruit at Hao Ren.

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin opened its mouth and caught the fruit in mid-air. “Not long, Not long at all! Did Your Majesty finish refining all thirty-six holy fruits? I expected you to take several hundred years...”

Some geniuses like He Jingyi, Shi Yinyu, and Song Litao would need tens or even hundreds of years to refine one holy fruit!

Initially, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin had thought that even with Huang Xiaolong’s heaven-defying talent, he would need hundreds of years to refine all thirty-six fruits.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “That’s right, I have refined all the holy fruits. Twenty years—it took me longer than expected.”

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was speechless, “You consider twenty years too long?!”

If it were Shi Yinyu, it would be a miracle if he could even refine a single fruit in twenty years.

Suddenly, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin’s eyes widened, “Your Majesty, you... you are already in the late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm?!”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised when he saw the shocked look on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. “Fortunately, I was able to increase my strength by a bit during my seclusion. However, I am still too weak.”

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin felt an explosion going off in its head.

Fortunately, able to increase his strength?! He has advanced from the mid-Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm to the late-Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm! What about me?! I’ve been stuck in the mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm for thousands of years!

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong mounted the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin kicked off and soared into the sky, causing the entire mountain range to tremble.

“Your Majesty, where are we going now?” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin asked casually.

“To the Spirits World!” Huang Xiaolong looked in the direction of the Spirits World.

“Spirits World?!” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin felt its jaws drop in shock.

“Your Majesty, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe occupies the entire Spirits World. Are you sure you want to go there?” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin asked nervously.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “That’s convenient... We can go and destroy the headquarters of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe along the way.”

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin broke out in a cold sweat. However, it decided to pretend it didn’t hear anything, and the two of them continued on their merry way.

To go to the Spirits World from the Hell Asura World, one had to pass through the Spirit Corpse Boundary River.

The Spirit Corpse Boundary River was also known as the Spirit Corpse Boundary River as it was the river that separated the Hell Asura World from the Spirits World.

With their speed, they needed at least two to three months to reach the river. Of course, it was under the assumption that they sped up their journey using teleportation arrays along their way.

Two months later...

The two of them finally arrived at the Spirit Corpse Boundary River.

On their way there, Huang Xiaolong had sent an order to Tai Yue and the others using his summoning signal. He had instructed them to find out the exact location of Fang Mingyu and verify if the grandmist aura actually existed within the treasury of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

“What an overpowering corpse energy!” Huang Xiaolong said as he stared at the Spirit Corpse Boundary River.

“It’s extremely troublesome to deal with the corpse energy within the river. Please be careful, Your Majesty.” The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin said solemnly.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. The Spirit Corpse Boundary River was one of the most dangerous places in Hell, and the corpse energy was too concentrated. If a Heavenly Monarch was careless and allowed the corpse energy to invade their body while crossing the river... They would turn into a spirit corpse before they knew it.

Even though Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of the corpse energy, there was no harm in being careful.

The other thing they had to worry about was the spirit corpses! Some of them even had the strength of an Emperor!

“Let’s head over.” Huang Xiaolong mounted the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and soared into the sky above the river.

Even though it was called a river, the Spirit Corpse Boundary River was extensive and was even comparable to the Nethersea. If the two of them wanted to cross the river, they would take a month of flying at the very least.

As soon as they entered the sky above the Spirit Corpse Boundary River, the corpse energy started gathering around them.

In response, the two of them dispersed the corpse energy before shooting forward.

Not long after, one of the spirit corpses drifted towards Huang Xiaolong.

This corpse was very tall, had rounded arms, and had sharp fingers like blades. At first glance, the mid-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch spirit corpse looked no different from ordinary disciples who had cultivated the spirit arts. The only difference was the absence of life force in its body.

Before the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin could take action, Huang Xiaolong reached out and pressed down with his palm. A sacred light flashed and attacked the mid-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch spirit corpse, causing it to let out a miserable shriek before it dissipated.

Usually, killing a spirit corpse wasn’t a simple matter. But with Huang Xiaolong’s sacred light he had inherited from the Heavenly Hall, weak spirit corpses weren’t strong enough to put up a fight against him. His sacred light was the strongest radiance energy in the world, and it wasn’t surprising for him to one-shot a weak spirit corpse.

They then continued flying forward.

As the two of them continued forward, more and more spirit corpses appeared. They seemed to be getting stronger, and Huang Xiaolong could only let the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin deal with the Emperor Realm ones.

When they arrived at the Spirit Corpse Boundary River center, Huang Xiaolong finally utilized the Heavenly Hall. They continued their journey without any further obstruction.

One month later, the two of them finally passed through the Spirit Corpse Boundary River and arrived at the Spirits World.

The Hell Asura World was filled with the stench of blood and bloody qi. As for the Spirits World, it seemed a little gloomy as it was filled with death qi.

“Let’s head to the Death Tomb City.” Huang Xiaolong pointed.

The Death Tomb City was the nearest city from the Spirit Corpse Boundary River, and it was also one of the top ten most famous cities in the Spirits World.

The Netherworld King’s Organization had a branch inside the Death Tomb City, and it was also a critical branch of the organization.
