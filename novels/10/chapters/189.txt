Chapter 190: New Students Signing In

Huang Xiaolong turned around to look at the person who called his name and when he saw the other party, he was stunned: “Chen Cheng!”

Chen Cheng... Luo Tong Kingdom Cosmic Star Academy’s Chen Cheng!

Many years ago when Huang Xiaolong first enrolled into Cosmic Star Academy, he met Chen Cheng when they entered the Dragon Flame Valley as a group to cultivate and he won the first year student’s champion title. That year, the student who won Cosmic Star Academy’s overall champion title was Chen Cheng!

Chen Cheng went on to represent Cosmic Star Academy and Luo Tong Kingdom to participate in the Imperial City Battle. In the midst of the competition, he broke through into the Xiantian realm and by a stroke of luck, he succeeded to clinch a spot within the top one hundred places, thus becoming a student of Duanren Institute.

Chen Cheng’s success that year in achieving a place within the top one hundred during the Imperial City Battle and becoming Duanren Institute’s student had turned him into a big sensation in the Luo Tong Kingdom.

Huang Xiaolong never expected to run into Chen Cheng on the first day at the Institute. Seeing Chen Cheng, Huang Xiaolong was genuinely happy. Since both of them were people from Luo Tong Kingdom, and students of the same Cosmic Star Academy, there was a nostalgic feeling of encountering a long-lost friend or running into a familiar face far from home.

“Xiaolong, it’s really you!” Chen Cheng walked up, one hand reaching out to pat Huang Xiaolong’s shoulder as he laughed heartily. His thrill and excitement even drove him to give Huang Xiaolong a bear hug.

Releasing Huang Xiaolong, Chen Cheng grinned and said, “It’s been eight years since we last met, you kid... you’re taller than me now!”

Although it had been eight years since they last met, and Huang Xiaolong’s appearance changed considerably, Chen Cheng could still recognize him. Of course, when he caught the first glimpse of Huang Xiaolong, he wasn’t sure in the beginning.

But now it was confirmed!

Huang Xiaolong responded with a playful punch to Chen Cheng’s shoulder, “You have become more robust too!”

Eight years had elapsed and Chen Cheng was more muscular than he used to be. However, in the past, Huang Xiaolong used to be a head shorter than him. But now, Huang Xiaolong was actually half a head taller than Chen Cheng.

“I heard you won first place in this year’s Imperial City Battle?” Chen Cheng sighed out of admiration, “Even that Xiantian Second Order Xie Puti lost to you! Perhaps I wouldn’t even be able take a hit from you now!”

Despite entering Duanren Institute eight years earlier than Huang Xiaolong, Chen Cheng was only at mid-Xiantian First Order. Based on strength, Chen Cheng was slightly weaker than Bai Shou who was thrown out of the stage with one move from Huang Xiaolong during the Imperial City Battle.

Therefore when Chen Cheng claimed he could not take one blow from Huang Xiaolong, he was not speaking words of modesty.

Huang Xiaolong and Chen Cheng chatted, most of the topics were related to Cosmic Star Academy.

The Academy was a memory they both shared.

At the mention of Cosmic Star Academy, words seemed to flow endlessly between them.

“I haven’t been back once in these eight years. I wonder how much has changed in the Academy?” Chen Cheng lamented, “I really want to go back and have a look around.” Not just the academy, he hadn’t even seen his family during that time frame either. He wondered if they were doing well.

“The next time I go back to the Luo Tong Kingdom, let’s go together.” Huang Xiaolong said.

“Really?” Chen Cheng laughed, “Great, it’s a promise!” Next, his tone changed, “You came today to report to the institute right? Come on, I’ll bring you there.”

With that, Chen Cheng led Huang Xiaolong towards the new students’ sign in area.

Cutting across the Institute square, Chen Cheng pointed out some building structures and introduced them to Huang Xiaolong as they passed by.

Not long after Duanren Empire was founded, Duanren Institute was built. It had quite a long history spanning over a thousand years, which showed in many of the building structures that exuded a vicissitude of time.

When they passed by the Institute’s Hall of Fame, Chen Cheng pointed to the five statues erected at the center of the hall and introduced them one by one to Huang Xiaolong.

All five were warriors that broke into the Saint realm after graduating from Duanren Institute.

When Chen Cheng came to the middle statue, an expression of fanaticism and worship took over, “This is our Duanren Institute’s most legendary student, Senior Xie Ke!”

“Senior Xie Ke broke through the Saint realm within three hundred years of cultivation!”

Huang Xiaolong was greatly shocked.

Three hundred years to breakthrough Saint realm!

Chen Cheng nudged him, “Shocked right?” Saying this, Chen Cheng suddenly lowered his voice to a whisper, “Senior Xie Ke is the Xie Family’s Ancestor!”

Xie Family’s Ancestor!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes rounded in surprise. Didn’t that mean this Xie Ke was Xie Puti’s ancestor?

“According to rumors, the Xie Family was established by Senior Xie Ke.” Chen Cheng added in his barely audible voice.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. Eight hundred years ago!

This Xie Family only began eight hundred years ago yet in that short span of time, it had grown big enough to rival a two thousand year heritage Yao Family. It would appear that one must not underestimate this Xie Ke.

If there was an opportunity, Huang Xiaolong hoped to meet Xie Ke.

Half an hour later, the two of them reached the new students sign in area.

The building where new students reported was similar to all of the other buildings, exuding an atmosphere and style of an age long passed. A lively scene was currently taking place, many people were already there by the time Huang Xiaolong and Chen Cheng walked in. Apart from the new students, there were many old students there as well. Huang Xiaolong raised his head and saw three characters written in ancient calligraphy hanging at the top of the building structure: Wind Facing Hall.

Leading up to Wind Facing Hall were a dozen or so stone steps.

As they walked up the steps, Chen Cheng explained to Huang Xiaolong that other than being where new students reported, Wind Facing Hall was also the place where the students accepted tasks and collected rewards.

Only then did Huang Xiaolong understand why there were so many older students entering and exiting the hall. It seemed they came to accept tasks or collect rewards.

Both of them entered the hall after climbing to the top of the steps.

The door entrance was quite grand, reaching twenty zhang. As they stepped inside, a majestic scene swept into their vision. From the outside, Wind Facing Hall did not look big, but once inside, the great hall appeared enormous and spacious.

Though it still lost in size when compared to the Duanren Square opposite the Duanren Imperial Palace, the difference was almost negligible.

Still, a ten-minute walk from the entrance was needed before a person could reach the place where new students signed in.

When the Institute teacher in charge of the reporting location heard Huang Xiaolong say his name, the teacher displayed an exaggerated expression of shock: “You’re Huang Xiaolong!”

By now, Huang Xiaolong’s name had spread throughout the entire Duanren Institute.

Of the several hundred thousand students and teachers in Duanren Institute, there wasn’t a single individual who wasn’t aware of the person possessing superb twin martial spiritsㅡHuang Xiaolong!

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

After receiving affirmation from Huang Xiaolong, the teacher scrutinized Huang Xiaolong’s appearance once over from head to toe before chuckling, “So you are Huang Xiaolong. Looks like what that little lass Sisi said about you was correct.”

“Sisi?” There was a trace of confusion in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Institute teacher laughed, “She’s my daughter. She went to spectate this year’s Imperial City Battle and when she came back she couldn’t stop praising you, saying you’re super cool!”

Super cool!

Huang Xiaolong was stumped, leaving him smiling wryly, whereas Chen Cheng next to him broke out in a fit of laughter.

“This is the Institute’s gold badge and robe.” The Institute teacher proceeded to take out a set of robes and a golden badge and passed them to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong put everything into the Asura Ring after receiving them.

Following that, the teacher briefly explained the Institute’s regulations and gave him an extremely thick book. Other than the Institute’s regulations, the thousand plus kingdoms under the Duanren Empire were also written down and described in detail.

From their conversation, Huang Xiaolong got to know the name of this teacher that was in charge of handling new reporting students. His name was Lin Yang.

When Huang Xiaolong and Chen Cheng stepped out from the great hall, Heartless Young Noble also happened to be walking up the stone stairs with a large group of people trailing behind him, which included Yanggang and Pang Yu.
