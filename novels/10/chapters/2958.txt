Chapter 2959: A Fair and Square Battle

“It’s time to go.” Huang Xiaolong roughly calculated the time, and it was already close to the appointed three-year agreement he had made with Feng Yue.

Although he had not found the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, he had gained the Tree of Beginning and Fruit of Beginning that was more valuable than the Frost Eye Race’s treasury!

Huang Xiaolong also collected a whole sea of Frost Jade Cold Water, ice-wind stones, and more importantly, he had subjugated the colony of poisonous spiders!

While tabulating his harvests, Huang Xiaolong once again felt grateful to Feng Yue for inviting him to open the Frost Eye Race’s treasury, or he wouldn’t have gained so many things.

‘I wonder how’s Feng Yue doing?’ Huang Xiaolong wondered inwardly.

Huang Xiaolong flew back to the entrance the way he came.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong sent a message to Feng Yue, but strangely, there was still no reply from Feng Yue an hour later.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong sent another message to Feng Yue, but there was still no reply.

What’s going on?

Huang Xiaolong wondered as his forehead wrinkled. Are they trapped inside restrictions around the Frost Eye Race’s treasury?

Logically, even if Feng Yue was trapped inside a restriction, she should be able to reply to him.

While Huang Xiaolong continued towards the entrance, inside the Frost Eye Race treasure hall, Bing Jun laughed in hysterical excitement as his hand grabbed onto the holy staff. After three years of refining the holy staff with the Frost Eye Race’s secret technique, he now had preliminary control of the holy staff.

“Holy Staff, my Frost Eye Race’s Holy Staff!” Bing Jun’s sonorous laughter reverberated in the hall, “I am now the new generation of Frost Eye Race’s king! Old fogey Xu Zu, just wait and let’s see who dares to defy me when I return!”

Ancestor Xuan watched the ecstatic Bing Jun and said, “It’s almost three years now, so don’t forget we have more important matters to deal with.”

Bing Jun nodded his head, “Yes, we still have a very important matter.” His eyes sparkled. “Huang Xiaolong’s probably on his way to the entrance now!”

He then glanced to the corner where Feng Yue and her group were bound, ordering other Frost Eye Race’s experts, “Bring them with us, we’ll head to the entrance now. We must arrive one step ahead and wait for Huang Xiaolong to show up!”

“Yes, Young Patriarch!”

…

Several days later.

Huang Xiaolong could see the entrance from afar.

As Huang Xiaolong had expected, there was no one around at the entrance area. There were no signs of Feng Yue or anyone from her group.

It seems something really happened to Feng Yue’s group? Huang Xiaolong’s brows were scrunched together in worry.

Right at this time, a malicious voice rang in the air, “Huang Xiaolong, you’ve arrived right on time. We’ve been waiting quite a while for you!”

Huang Xiaolong’s head turned, and he saw a space crack appear as a snowy-browed old man and a group of Frost Eye Race’s experts stepped out from the void. Huang Xiaolong was startled alarmed, seeing the snowy-browed old man. A peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable?

“Frost Eye Race?” Huang Xiaolong regained his composure almost instantly, and asked calmly, “Feng Yue and the others are in your hands?”

A fool could guess that this group of people were deliberately waiting for him, and Feng Yue had not replied to his messages, it was certain at this point that Feng Yue’s group had fallen into these people’s hands.

Bing Jun chuckled smugly, “Correct, we’re members of the Frost Eye Race. I am the Frost Eye Race’s first generation patriarch’s grandson, and also the new generation king successor of our Frost Eye Race. As for Young Lady Feng Yue and her group, they are indeed in our hands.”

With a wave of his hand, his people revealed Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the others.

Feng Yue, and everyone fell to the ground. When Feng Yue saw Huang Xiaolong, there was worry and guilt in her eyes, but she couldn’t speak and was unable to move. Clearly, her entire body’s strength was sealed.

A sharp light gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he noticed Elder Tong’s empty eye sockets, Feng Yue, and the others bloodstained appearances.

“Oh Huang Xiaolong, is your heart aching for them?” Bing Jun smiled brightly. “I think you better worry about your own ending that is coming later.”

“You dare to do this despite knowing my identity?” Huang Xiaolong asked indifferently, “Are you not afraid of race annihilation?”

Bing Jun laughed heartily and looked at Huang Xiaolong with undisguised ridicule, “Race annihilation? Huang Xiaolong, after we finish dealing with you here, we will silence them all. Who will know we did it? When I possess your bloodline, I will be the new Son of Creation! With your Huang Long Armor in my hands, my defenses will be invincible, who can hurt me then?”

“Possess my bloodline?” Huang Xiaolong caught something strange.

“That’s right,” Bing Jun’s smug smile widened. “Our Frost Eye Race has a supreme method of transferring bloodline, and has successfully transferred many peak level bloodlines. Wait till we transfer your bloodline into me, and I will possess your Huang Long Bloodline. Won’t I be the new Son of creation then?”

Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t stop the laughter rushing up his throat. This young man’s thinking is really naive!

Never in Huang Xiaolong’s wildest imagination did the young man actually want to transfer his Huang Long Bloodline into his own body!

If his Huang Long Bloodline was so easy to transfer, it wouldn't be the Huang Long Bloodline!

No matter how powerful the Frost Eye Race’s bloodline transfer method was, and they were capable of transferring other bloodlines, it wouldn’t be able to transfer the Huang Long Bloodline.

And it was impossible for the young man not to realize this.

In essence, this Frost Eye Race’s young man was holding on to a stroke of luck that he would succeed even if the chances of it were only ten percent!

At the end of the day, the God of Creation Huang Bloodline was too big a temptation.

For example, the Mystical Dragon Fish Branch Pavilion Master Zeng Lei had tried to trick him into the Sun Moon Furnace to refine him into a peerless dao pill.

Bing Jun’s face sank after seeing Huang Xiaolong laughing at his words, “Huang Xiaolong, you think this is funny?”

Huang Xiaolong stopped laughing abruptly and looked at the young man with an icy gaze, “Release Feng Yue and the others, then kneel and submit to me. I can spare your lives.”

All the Frost Eye Race’s experts were dumbfounded, and Ancestor Xuan who had been quiet, harshly threatened, “Huang Xiaolong, do you think we can’t do things to you because you have the Huang Long Armor? You need to consume a lot of cosmos energy to use the Huang Long Armor, there will always be a time when your cosmos energy runs out. Without the Huang Long Armor, it is very easy for us to destroy you!”

Bing Jun looked at Huang Xiaolong with disdain. “Huan Xiaolong, I know your battle prowess is extraordinary, however, our Ancestor Xuan is a peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable expert, and he is absolutely no weaker than that old man Bi Cheng. You didn’t know this, right?”

“However, there is no need for Ancestor Xuan to take action in order to capture you because I, alone, am enough!” With that said, he walked towards Huang Xiaolong with his hands clasped behind him, “I’ve heard that you have the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth, both defenses and attack are unparalleled. I dare you to fight a battle with me fair and square without using your Huang Long Armor?”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Fine, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

Since the other party had said so, how could Huang Xiaolong bear to disappoint Bing Jun?

Bing Jun’s cultivation realm was not low, and he was at late-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. In terms of battle strength, Bing Jun was a lot stronger than Huang Shuai, and Huang Shuai was merely a peak late-First Esteem Dao Venerable at that time.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the same late-First Esteem Dao Venerable he was back then.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
