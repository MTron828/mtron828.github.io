Chapter 2546: Qiao Jinyang Makes His Move

Hearing Huai Po’s rebuttal that was full of unwillingness, Mo Cangli frowned, “Huai Po, you’re outstanding, and definitely do not lose out compared to Li Chen or Xie Bufan, but Huang Xiaolong’s strength is not as simple as you think. His three complete dao saint godheads have most likely evolved into the top fifteen. Adding the power of his Holy Mandate Imprint, no one under the True Saint Realm can be his opponent!”

“To Huang Xiaolong, there is no difference whether he uses his holy soul or not. He is invincible inside the Saint Fate’s boundary! Below the True Saint Realm, no disciple is his opponent, even if there are two of you!” Mo Cangli persuaded in earnest.

But Huai Po didn’t take his words to heart, “Master, you’re overestimating Huang Xiaolong far too much. At the Cangqiong Holy Manor, he was capable of killing Li Chen and Xie Bufan only because of the Heaven Opening Dragon Spear. How could he have been a match against Li Chen and Xie Bufan? My talent is no worse than Li Chen’s or Xie Bufan’s. I am at the same cultivation level as them, and without his holy soul, Huang Xiaolong is only a fraction stronger than me.”

“Strong as he might be, there is a limit to it. Even if I can’t defeat him, he won’t be able to do much harm to me. In short, if there are three high-order Saint Fates, I am certain I’d be able to snatch one of them!”

Mo Cangli looked deeply at his disciple and spoke in a solemn voice, “Alright then, just be careful and do the best you can. Don’t be dead set to go against Huang Xiaolong.”

He knew very well that if he denied his disciple a chance at competing for a high-order Saint Fate, the unwillingness in his disciple’s heart would turn into resentment. This would evolve into a demon heart for Huai Po. This would affect Huai Po’s state of mind when he would break through to True Saint Realm. In that case, he would give Huai Po a free rein and let him go for it.

Moreover, deep down, a part of Mo Cangli agreed with his disciple that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to use the power of his holy soul within the Saint Fate’s boundary. Therefore, Huai Po could have a chance at getting a high-order Saint Fate.

Huai Po smiled confidently and reassured Mo Cangli, “Rest assured, Master. I will.”

Mo Cangli smiled and nodded.

With his disciple’s potential and talent, if he could integrate with a high-order Saint Fate, his future achievements would be higher, and naturally, there was a slightly higher chance of stepping into the Primal Ancestor Realm.

Inside the Blue Dragon Manor in the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, Huang Xiaolong looked at the vibrant holy lights flowing in the skies and an exhilarated smile rose on his face.

It looks like three high-order Saint Fates will be appearing this time!

“Three.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Of course, it would be better if there were four, five, or even six!

Huang Xiaolong had a feeling the number of Saint Fates appearing this time would be a lot more than all previous times.

Therefore, I should make some preparations. Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Generally speaking, with the five months precursor to the Saint Fates being born, there would be a phenomenon around the location of appearance. Hence, about a month later, they would be able to roughly determine the location, and Huang Xiaolong used this one-month buffer to make the necessary preparations before setting off.

In truth, despite planning to make preparations, there was nothing much to do. Once he entered the Saint Fate’s boundary, all holy artifacts would be rendered useless, and he wouldn’t be able to employ the Holy Mandate Imprint’s power either. Additionally, he, or anyone else, wouldn’t be able to consume holy pills to replenish their strength, much less take out the dao artifacts. In short, there was nothing to prepare.

In the following month, Huang Xiaolong was no longer in a hurry to cultivate. Occasionally, he would go out to relax, accompanying Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and the others. Occasionally, Huang Xiaolong would enter the Primal Ancestor’s space to discuss about grand dao with his four masters.

One month soon went by.

On this day, the brilliant rays of light in the skies suddenly shrunk and converged towards a certain location.

A burst of blinding light fell towards that location, akin to millions of golden suns emerging from the dark space at the same time.

“Cambrian Pool Star!”

“The Saint Fates are appearing at the Cambrian Pool Star!” In an instant, the news spread at frightening speed throughout the Holy World, shaking the Holy World’s experts.

In an instant, all Holy World’s holy grounds and ancient races led their forces’ Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm disciples and rushed towards the Cambrian Pool Star.

The moment the Holy Heavens’ four Primal Ancestors determined the Saint Fates would be appearing at the Cambrian Pool Star, they summoned Huang Xiaolong.

“The Saint Fates would be appearing at the Cambrian Pool Star this time,” the Heavenly Master went on, “Be ready, we’ll set off within the hour.”

The Saint Fates’ appearance was a big event in the Holy World. Moreover, this time, their personal disciple Huang Xiaolong was going to integrate with a Saint Fate, the four Primal Ancestors would naturally be going with Huang Xiaolong, and ensure Huang Xiaolong’s safety.

“Understood, Master.” Huang Xiaolong responded.

An hour later, the four gathered Huang Xiaolong and other Holy Heavens organisation’s Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm disciples, and set off towards the Cambrian Pool Star.

The Cambrian Pool Star was a long way from the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds, but with the speed Huang Xiaolong’s group was traveling at, they could definitely arrive before the Saint Fates appeared.

“The Cambrian Pool Star is a short distance from the Black Devil Star Prison. Moreover, we have to pass the Black Devil Star Prison first. Would Qiao Jinyang try to trip us at that time?” On the way, Elder Crow brought up the subject.

This was not Elder Crow overthinking things. After all, Xie Bufan had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Not to mention, once Huang Xiaolong successfully integrated with a Saint Fate, it would be more difficult for Qiao Jinyang to kill Huang Xiaolong. Therefore, Qiao Jinyang was likely to make a move before Huang Xiaolong integrated with Saint Fate.

A sharp light flickered across Tyrant Chu’s eyes as he said, “All the better. Since it’s on the way, we could turn his lair upside down! And smash his Devil Palace into ruins.”

Lord Long agreed domineeringly, “That’s the way. We brothers will join hands and crush his root as well!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong was rendered completely speechless by his two masters.

The Heavenly Master smiled as he shook his head and dissuaded them, “Alright, stop with these childish jokes. When passing by the Black Devil Star Prison, don’t provoke unnecessary trouble if Qiao Jinyang does not make a move. Xiaolong integrating with Saint Fate is more important, and we will prioritize sending Xiaolong into the Saint Fate’s boundary.”

Tyrant Chu, Lord Long, and Elder Crow nodded unanimously.

They agreed on the last point.

Their journey progressed smoothly,

Three months later, the Holy Heavens’ group reached the Black Devil Prison Star.

As they looked at the star enshrouded in roiling devil qi, like a great beast with its jaw wide open, the Heavenly Master frowned and cautioned everyone, “When we pass by the Black Devil Star Prison, everyone be on their toes.”

To reach the Cambrian Pool Star, they needed to pass by the Black Devil Star Prison’s Lightning Prison River region. Therefore, if the Devil Palace’s experts were going to ambush them, the Lightning Prison River would probably be the place to do so.

……

A day later.

As the four Primal Ancestors led the Holy Heavens’ disciples to pass through the Lightning Prison River, devil qi suddenly soared high, and the Lightning Prison River’s swirling lightning clouds and roiling waves seemed to fall into the abyss of hell.

In the next second, three figures descended from high air with their momentums blazing, and the pressure exuded by these three figures caused the airflow in the entire Lightning Prison River to stagnate.

These three were none other than Qiao Jinyang, Cao Nan, and Gu Tian.

Seeing these three people and sensing the layers of array formations that separated the region from the outside world, Tyrant Chu, and the others’ faces darkened.

“Qiao Jinyang, are you really going to break the treaty made in the past and attack personally?” Lord Long questioned as he fixed an icy stare at Qiao Jinyang. “Do you think you can really trap us here relying on this Devil Prison Forest Grand Formation?”

The Holy Heavens, Devil Palace, Clear Snow Palace, and Holy Lands Alliance had a treaty, and unless one of the forces faced destruction, Primal Ancestor Realm experts couldn’t take matters into their own hands.

Qiao Jinyang’s face was deadpan as he spoke, “If Huang Xiaolong is allowed to integrate with a Saint Fate, my Devil Palace won’t be far from destruction. Therefore, we’re not really breaking the treaty at all. This Devil Prison Forest Grand Formation might not be able to trap you guys for a long time, I only need it to trap you here for one month, that’s more than enough!”

Saint Fate would appear after this one month, and if the Holy Heavens’ group was trapped there for a month, they wouldn’t make it in time even if they rushed to Cambrian Pool Star after that.
