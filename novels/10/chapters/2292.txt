Chapter 2293: Luo Hong’s Threat!

A month later, Huang Xiaolong arrived back at the headquarters.

Before entering the main palace, he brought Feng Tianyu and the rest back to his Myriad Dragon Peak. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He didn’t come back alone either. He chose a hundred talents from the two islands, and he brought them back with him.

When Zhang Wenyue, who had been waiting for Huang Xiaolong to return, saw that he had kept his word and brought back a bunch of strong subordinates, she was overjoyed.

Resting for half a day in the Myriad Dragon Peak, Huang Xiaolong finally brought the four guardians along with him to the main palace.

...

In the palace of the Holy Alliance...

“Senior Brother Jiang Tian, that brat is finally back. He’s headed to the main palace now.” Zheng Yongjia bowed as he made his report to Jiang Tian.

A frosty light flashed through Jiang Tian’s eyes. “He really had the guts to return! Hehe! It’s good that he’s back!”

Wu Shi added, “Senior Brother Jiang Tian, even though Holy Prince Luo Hong is leading the group of experts from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground, Li Wen and the others wouldn’t hand Huang Xiaolong over to them! They wouldn’t have called Huang Xiaolong back otherwise!”

“Luo Hong’s strength isn’t something we can speculate. Now that he’s here, Li Wen and the others wouldn’t be able to stop him even if they wanted to!”

“Is Luo Hong planning to make a move in our headquarters?” Another Holy Prince gasped in surprise.

Jiang Tian chuckled. “That’s right. Tan Hongyi told me in secret that if Li Wen refuses to hand Huang Xiaolong over, Luo Hong would no longer hold back. The Patriarch of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground has already given the supreme order to bring Huang Xiaolong back no matter the cost!”

Zheng Yongjia hesitated for a moment before asking, “Senior Brother Jiang Tian, did the patriarch really experience reincarnation?”

A light flashed in Jiang Tian’s eyes all of a sudden, but he shook his head in response. “I have no idea. Master didn’t inform me of his whereabouts. The only thing master left behind was an order to Li Wen and the others. The Holy Prince who enters the True Saint Realm would immediately take over as the patriarch of the Zhuoyuan Holy Grounds!”

Jiang Tian swept his gaze across the rest of the Holy Princes and warned, “I hope that none of you will continue to speculate about the matters of the patriarch.”

Zheng Yongjia, Wu Shi, and the others felt their hearts tremble as they nodded their heads in affirmation.

“Let’s go. We’ll head over to the main palace as well.” Jiang Tian got to his feet all of a sudden.

Zheng Yongjia and the others looked at him in shock.

However, they were met with a chuckle from Jiang Tian. “Don’t you guys want to see Luo Hong’s strength? Don’t you want to see how Luo Hong takes Huang Xiaolong down? This is going to be the showdown of an era!”

“Senior Brother Jiang Tian is right! We can’t miss this for anything!” Zheng Yongjia laughed in response.

“Let’s go!”

Jiang Tian led the members in the Holy Alliance and left for the main palace.

...

When Huang Xiaolong arrived in the main palace, he strode in with the four guardians beside him.

As soon as he entered the hall, Huang Xiaolong saw the various experts of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground staring at him. Tan Hongyi, Qu Jiangmeng, and the others stared at him the moment he appeared.

Looking past them, Huang Xiaolong noticed the person sitting in front of all the disciples of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground. As he saw this person, clad in a golden robe, Huang Xiaolong knew that there was no mistake. The person leading the group was Luo Hong!

Even though he had never seen Luo Hong before, Huang Xiaolong could be sure that that was him!

Luo Hong stared at Huang Xiaolong, and a mysterious wave of energy shot towards him. The wave of energy was gentle, yet it contained a terrifying amount of corrosive energy within. If it entered his body, he was done for! His three Complete Dao Saint Godheads and divine soul would rot in an instant!

Even though he wouldn’t die from it, he would become a complete retard!

Li Wen and the other Eminent Elders had never expected Luo Hong to act so audaciously. A supreme expert like Luo Hong would actually make such a sinister move on Huang Xiaolong the moment they met?!

Even at their level, they knew that they wouldn’t be able to make it in time to intercept the attack!

Just as the corrosive energy was about to devour Huang Xiaolong, Gu Tianxing made a move. Reaching out with a single hand, rays of light smashed toward Luo Hong’s energy.

Boom!

A loud explosion rang out in the hall and Gu Tianxing was sent flying. He slammed into the walls of the main palace as blood trickled down his face. His expression darkened and it was obvious he was seriously injured by the corrosive energy.

The members of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate widened their eyes in shock.

Gu Tianxing was a Seventh Tribulation Half-TrueSaint! However, he was sent flying with a single wave of energy unleashed by Luo Hong!

Moreover, everyone could see that it was merely a casual attack sent out by Luo Hong!

Of course, Li Wen and the others were merely shocked for a second before they snapped back to their senses. Rage filled their hearts.

“Luo Hong, you’re going too far!” Li Wen leaped to his feet as his aura surged. It charged towards Luo Hong without any intention of stopping.

Dragon qi filled the hall in an instant as Luo Hong counterattacked. He ignored Li Wen’s aura completely and chuckled, “Li Wen, why are you throwing a tantrum here? I was merely testing your disciple’s reaction. I had no other intentions. Look. Isn’t he perfectly fine?”

The upper echelons of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate could no longer hold back their rage when they heard what he said.

“If not for Guardian Gu’s assistance, Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong would be in danger!” Chen Shiming, an Eminent Elder of the Holy Gate, glared at Luo Hong. “Even if nothing happened to Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong, you injured Guardian Gu Tianxing!”

“Guardian? If this is a guardian of your Holy Gate, he’s nothing but trash. You can’t blame me for injuring a useless b*stard.”

“What?!” Everyone in the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate felt rage bubbling in their heart when they heard what Luo Hong said.

Seemingly unaffected by those from the Holy Gate, Luo Hong continued, “Huang Xiaolong killed my junior brother, Yang Rong. I’m here on my master’s order to capture his murderer. It’s best for all of you to hand him over to me right now. As long as you hand Huang Xiaolong over, the relationship between our Holy Grounds will remain the same.”

“Murderer?” Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Luo Hong, your Holy Prince took the initiative to challenge me to a life or death battle. He signed it, and he died in the central arena. You can’t blame me for taking out the garbage. Of course, if that’s a Holy Prince of your holy ground, he’s nothing but trash. You can’t blame me for killing a b*stard. He couldn’t even take a single slap from me!”

“Well said!” Li Wen and the others nearly jumped in joy when they heard what he said.

A trace of anger flashed in Luo Hong’s eyes when he glared at Huang Xiaolong. “That’s not what my junior brother said. You were the one who forced Yang Rong to sign the life or death agreement!”

“That’s right! I can vouch for what he said! Huang Xiaolong was the one who forced Yang Rong to sign the agreement!” A voice echoed in the hall all of a sudden, and Jiang Tian led the members of the Holy Alliance into the hall.
