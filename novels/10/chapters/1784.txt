When the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong saw he had gotten the same number as Huang Xiaolong, he was stunned for a moment. But then, he raised his head and looked at Huang Xiaolong with a raging desire for battle.

He had been waiting for a long time for this battle!

Soon, all of one the hundred disciples had drawn their lots. The Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s opponent was a disciple from the Fiend God Emperor Palace. On the other hand, the Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan’s opponent was a disciple from the ancient hidden Purple Flames Sword Sect.

Therefore, there was not much suspense around the Heavenly Prince Di Jing and Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple Feng Chan’s match results.

Almost all eyes were focused on battle stage six.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong and the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple were standing on the battle stage, facing each other and waiting for the battle to start.

“Our Emperor’s Disciple is winning for sure!”

“Emperor’s Disciple, defeat that Huang Xiaolong! Kill Huang Xiaolong!”

A short distance away, the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples shouted.

Lan Tailong’s icy gaze was fixed on Huang Xiaolong as he spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, you killed two hundred and forty-five disciples of my Brightness Emperor Palace during the preliminary round. During this one month, I have thought about beheading you at every waking second, slicing off your flesh piece by piece as an offering to appease those two hundred and forty-five Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples!”

“Honestly, I was a little worried that you might die at Heavenly Prince Di Jing’s hands on the battle stage, but now, I am delighted!”

“My luck must be good since I am encountering you in the first match of the top one hundred rankings!”

Lan Tailong sneered, “Another thing, I hope you have no intention of throwing in the towel because I won’t give you a chance!”

Lan Tailong did not conceal his killing intent at all, and a murderous aura soared from his body to the sky.

Even though the preliminary round’s first place was Huang Xiaolong, Lan Tailong was extremely confident in his own strength. He did not think that Huang Xiaolong could defeat him.

He had been cultivating diligently for several tens of thousands of years and had encountered a few fortuitous adventures. Not to mention, he had the highest level of talent amongst several generations of Brightness Emperor’s Disciples, not even his father and the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Ancestors knew his real strength.

Lan Tailong also had the confidence of facing the Heavenly Prince Di Jing.

Huang Xiaolong watched as Lan Tailong babbled on with confidence and a burning desire for battle. He couldn’t help snickering, “Very good. I feel the same. You won’t have the chance to throw in the towel later, and after I kill you, the number of Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciples that I have killed would increase to two hundred and forty-six.”

A ruthless glint flickered across Lan Tailong’s eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, enough with your b*llshit. I’ll show you my real strength now!” With that said, his momentum intensified, and he no longer concealed his real strength.

Radiance rays shot out from Lan Tailong’s body, forming intense beams of pillar light.

The light pillars pierced through the sky, and a scary energy whirlpool spun rapidly high in the air. Tsunami of bright light spread out from the energy whirlpool to the four directions at a shocking speed.

“The peak late-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!”

The crowd was shocked and reacted dramatically.

Even the Grandmist Emperor Palace and Fiend God Emperor Palace’s experts were surprised.

The rumors circulating outside claimed that Lan Tailong’s strength was at the early Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. But who would’ve thought that Lan Tailong had already reached the peak late-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm! Though it was the same ‘Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm,’ the two scales’ strength-gap was massive.

Ten pairs of wings appeared behind Lan Tailong’s back; ten pairs of wings condensed out of his supreme radiance godforce.

“Brightness Divine Saint Manual!”

“Lan Tailong’s cultivation of the Brightness Divine Saint Manual had reached the major completion stage!”

In the next second, the crowd saw a stalwart shadow materializing behind Lan Tailong. This shadow emitted glaring white crepuscular rays of light and exuded a faint aura of an Emperor.

“Is this an Emperor’s divine soul will?!”

“I have long heard about Lan Tailong obtaining the Brightness Emperor Palace’s founder’s supreme inheritance. It looks like it’s true! This Emperor’s divine soul will is most likely the Brightness Emperor Palace’s founder’s divine soul will. The regular Emperor Realm experts could not exude such a powerful Emperor aura!”

At first, everyone was merely astonished, but now, they were astounded.

In general, it was rare to find people who had obtained the founder’s inheritance, and even rarer to find someone who could successfully withstand the weight of the founder’s divine soul will. It was so rare that one hardly appeared in ten billion years.

A peerless Emperor Realm expert’s divine soul will, ah! Even though the so-called divine soul will was not a real Emperor’s will, it’s power was still startling. Imagine being enveloped by the immense pressure of an Emperor Realm expert, where the foe couldn’t even muster the idea of resistance. One could only surrender obediently.

This was one of Lan Tailong’s trump cards.

It was also due to the Brightness Emperor Palace’s founder’s divine soul will that Lan Tailong was confident to battle Di Jing.

After summoning the Brightness Emperor Palace’s founder’s divine soul will, Lan Tailong stood with his hands behind his back as he enjoyed the crowd’s astounded expressions. He looked condescendingly at Huang Xiaolong as he spoke, “Huang Xiaolong, feeling stupefied, aren’t you? In truth, during the preliminary round, I did not at all summon the founder’s divine soul will. Otherwise, you could have never taken first place in the preliminary round. And this isn’t even my full strength yet.”

The crowd was in a furor listening to Lan Tailong’s words.

This is still not his full strength?!

Although astonished, some people were suspicious if Lan Tailong was merely sensationalizing himself?

While these people were suspicious, dark radiance energy suddenly surged from Lan Tailong’s body.

“Is that a darkness supreme godforce?!”

Everyone was beyond shocked, including the Brightness Emperor Palace’s Chen Wenqian and other Ancestors. There was darkness element supreme godforce surging out from Lan Tailong’s body. It clearly meant that Lan Tailong possessed a radiance supreme godhead and a darkness supreme godhead!

Lan Tailong has two top supreme godheads!

None of them had ever heard of this before.

Even the Heavenly Court’s experts on the high stage stirred slightly due to Lan Tailong’s revelation.

“This is a surprise, Lan Tailong actually has two top supreme godheads—one light and the other darkness—two contradicting energies.” Sitting on the dragon throne, Heavenly Emperor Di Jun was full of praise, “This Lan Tailong has even surprised me.”

Grand Marshal Yan Tianchen, who was standing a step behind him, spoke, “Lan Tailong’s strength has completely surpassed the strength of a peak late-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. It is comparable to most of the Ninth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm experts. Considering the Emperor’s divine soul will, it looks like it’s even possible for him to kill some early Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm expert.”

“It seems like Huang Xiaolong’s absolutely dead!” Xiao Yi agreed at the side, nodding his head.

But the Heavenly Emperor Di Jun shook his head with a wry smile, “Not necessarily.”

Both Yan Tianchen and Xiao Yi were surprised.

“Huang Xiaolong placed first in the preliminary round, forcing Jing’er to second place. He must have his own trump cards.” Heavenly Emperor Di Jun went on earnestly, “Perhaps, both of them might suffer heavy injuries in this battle, or Huang Xiaolong might barely defeat Lan Tailong at a great cost.”

“Both sides might suffer, or Huang Xiaolong might even defeat Lan Tailong at a great cost?” Yan Tianchen blanked for a second, and weakly denied, “Not, not possible... right?”

Zhao Lei, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and Bei Xiaomei had confidence in Huang Xiaolong. But now that Lan Tailong had exposed the existence of a second supreme godhead, and the Brightness Emperor Palace’s founder’s divine soul will, they couldn’t help feeling worried.

“Elder Fu, do you think Uncle can hold on? He can, right?” Bei Xiaomei asked Elder Fu.

Elder Fu smiled wryly.

This question was tough to answer.

Inwardly, he didn’t look favorably on Huang Xiaolong’s current situation. In his opinion, the chances of Lan Tailong winning this battle were extremely high. Anyone with an understanding of an Emperor’s divine soul will’s power would think the same way.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
