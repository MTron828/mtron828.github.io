“Lu Zhuo, you’re celebrating too early, there is still one heritage tablet left, I don’t believe Huang Xiaolong can comprehend all of them!” Ren Changhai’s eyes shone with a manic gleam.

“That’s right! In the last ten million years, there has never been anyone who managed to comprehend all one hundred heritage tablets, cut my head off and I still won’t believe Huang Xiaolong can pull it off!” Zhu Huan shouted harshly, “Until the last moment, who can say for sure who’s the winner?”

Lu Zhuo’s brows furrowed unconsciously as his confidence toward Huang Xiaolong wavered.

Indeed, in their ten million years of history, no disciple had ever succeeded in comprehending all one hundred heritage tablets, could Huang Xiaolong be different?

As his gaze fell on the steel door, Lu Zhuo was struck with pangs of anxiety.

The three of them stared fixedly at room number one, causing the hall to be shrouded by a heavy silence.

Right at this time, there was movement from room number two as Zhao Wuya finally finished his sixtieth heritage tablet, moving onto the sixty-first. In the shrine’s records, disciples who could pass the sixtieth heritage tablet mark in a hundred days had always been on the lower count.

However, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan weren’t feeling good at all, barely noticing the movement.

Another two days passed under the highly tensed atmosphere. The three Ancestors kept their gazes on the first room, yet there hadn’t been any movement thus far. There was barely anything left of Lu Zhuo’s sparse beard, wrecked by Lu Zhuo himself.

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan kept chanting in their hearts, ‘Fail, fail, fail!’ ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Despite their fervent negative chanting, the steel door of room number one suddenly emitted a brilliant light, expanding outward, brighter than any other times before.

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan trembled, unwillingness written all over their faces, combined with hate, remorse, and disbelief. Their eyes became a bloodthirsty scarlet.

“Why?!” Ren Changhai let out a resentful roar. Why were they the ones who lost?

“The heritage tablets in room number one must have malfunctioned!” Zhu Huan shouted shrilling, “Yes, that must be it, that must be it!”

Lu Zhuo couldn’t be bothered with their reaction, his elated and triumphant laughter resounded in the hall, “Hahaha, this feels f*cking amazing!” Then he lamented woefully, “Heavens, why am I the one who wins again? Why it is so hard for me to lose even once?”

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan felt their blood flow in reverse listening to Lu Zhuo’s words. In the next second, they blood on the spot.

Any other person who lost half of their sect’s treasury would vomit blood. Not doing so would be more strange.

This sight put Lu Zhuo in a jolly mood. He was caressing the few hairs left of his beard with a big grin as he said, “It’s been long since our Barbarian God Sect held a celebration banquet. Once this Primordial Celestial Shrine trip ends, the three of us should have a few drinks together. As the host, both of you must give me some face and attend ah.”

Celebration banquet!

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan felt another rush of blood flow to their hearts.

At this time, inside room number one, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in front of the hundredth heritage tablet, enshrouded in a dazzling light. All one hundred tablets in the room were emitting the same dazzling light in resonance.

This dazzling light gathered to form a golden-colored tablet that disappeared into Huang Xiaolong’s forehead in a flash.

The instant the golden tablet entered his forehead, the dazzling light shrouding Huang Xiaolong exploded into blazing brightness as golden-colored energy flowed into his body.

When this golden energy appeared, his three supreme godheads spun madly.

It was a full day later when the golden energy diminished and everything returned to a state of calm.

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes, exhaling deeply.

“The Devil Restraining Tablet!” Huang Xiaolong could barely hide the elation he was feeling.

Just now, the golden-colored tablet that entered his mind was the Devil Restricting Tablet, a low-grade chaos divine artifact!

A low-grade chaos divine artifact ah! Even the three sects Ancestors’ weapons were the common divine artifacts refined by Ancient God Realm masters.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong calmed down his excitement, then got up to his feet. He looked toward the steel door and walked over. There was still one day remaining, he wondered what was behind this steel door.

Standing in front of this steel door, he focused on the dent at the center of the door. With a thought, he activated the Devil Restraining Tablet he just got.

The Devil Restraining Tablet flew out from his forehead, fitting precisely into the square dent on the steel door.

Almost instantly, the door quivered and slowly opened.

Retrieving the Devil Restraining Tablet, Huang Xiaolong walked inside, arriving at another large hall.

He spread out his divine sense as he stood at the edge of the hall and discovered that the other nine rooms were also connected to thishall. A jade box was placed at the center of the hall, but other than this there was nothing else in this large space.

Perplexed, Huang Xiaolong slowly approached the jade box.

In fact, the jade box was only half a meter in length, with the width of a palm, emitting a beautiful jadeite lustre. It was cool to the touch, the entire jade box was made from the Divine World’s finest imperial green jade. It was said that a box made from imperial green jade could maintain the things kept within for a billion years like it was the first day.

It was an extremely rare and precious kind of jade.

Huang Xiaolong picked up the jade box, circulating the godforce from his three supreme godheads to break the layers of restrictions placed upon it.

When he saw what was inside, he was stunned for a moment. Nestled inside was a spatial ring made of the same precious imperial green jade, and next to it was a jade token slightly smaller than a palm.

Huang Xiaolong picked up the jade token, looking over it carefully. On the front of the jade token was the figure of a human expert stepping on a devil under his foot, while on the back were several ancient characters.

The Devil Restraining Sect!

Huang Xiaolong put away the jade token and moved onto the imperial green jade spatial ring, opening its restrictions. Checking inside the spatial ring, Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded. Placed within were more than fifty stalks of forty-million-year-old medicinal herbs!

There were also three spiritual veins inside, all low rank grade four.

Low rank grade four spiritual veins!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened and his breathing quickened.

His cultivation was currently at peak mid-Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm. With these three low rank grade four spiritual veins and those forty-million-years-old herbs, he could break through to Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm in the shortest time! Perhaps even mid-Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm!

A long time later, Huang Xiaolong took a few deep breaths to calm his heart that was somersaulting in his chest due to the appearance of the spiritual veins. His gaze then moved to the single old book placed on a raised dais in the middle of the spatial ring.

The placement of this old book, right at the center of this space, indicated its importance.

Huang Xiaolong removed the book from the ring, flipping it open.

Half a day later, he had roughly read through it once from cover to cover. This book was left behind by the three sects’ founders.

The Barbarian God Sect, Elephant Genesis Sect, and Great Whale Sect’s founders were actually core disciples of the Devil Restraining Sect from the Primal Chaos Mainland more than ten million years ago.

At that time, the Devil Restraining Sect was besieged by enemies and was annihilated except for the three of them who had managed to escape all the way to Green Cloud Island where they changed their identities in order to survive, building the three sects.

According to what was written in the book, the disciple who succeeded in comprehending all hundred heritage tablets was a rare genius that would appear only once in ten million years, thus being worthy of obtaining the Devil Restraining Sect’s greatest divine artifact, the Devil Restraining Tablet.

The three founders had hoped the disciple that obtained the Devil Restraining Tablet would be able to merge the three sects and lead them back to the Primal Chaos Mainland, avenging them by defeating the enemies of that year.

Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly, this was a thankless task.
