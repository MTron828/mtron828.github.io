Chapter 3657: Opening of the Heavenly Peak

Mei Jie, who had 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy, failed to take a single strike from Huang Xiaolong! If that was the case, how many people in the hall could dream of standing against him?!

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong dragged Mei Jie’s sorry figure over to himself.

A smile appeared on Mei Jie’s face all of a sudden. “If my son and I fail to return after the ceremony, Lord Zhu Chen will personally appear to deal with you. When Lord Green Ghost discovers the disappearance of Lord Gui Chi, he will also come over to the Jian Family to investigate the matter. Huang Xiaolong, no matter how strong you are, you won’t be able to stop them both!”

“That’s right! Huang Xiaolong, even with the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the four Universe Origin Fires, you won’t be able to stand against the entire Unknown Lands!”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand casually and his 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out of his body. A terrifying pressure descended on the lands and he sent Elder Baixuan Tian flying across the hall.

“Going against the Unknown Lands?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “So what if I do?”

The inner hall fell into silence.

“Everyone, don’t panic!” Mei Jie roared. “We have more than ten thousand experts on our side! As long as we work together, he won’t be able to stop us all! Don’t tell me we’re afraid of a single man!”

Mei Jie’s words sparked the fighting spirit of the various experts in the hall.

Huang Xiaolong snorted lightly before rushing into the crowd.

With the Universe Boat, Star Dragon Divine Tree, Universe Origin Fires, and the Three Gods Halberd, Huang Xiaolong was unstoppable!

No one could break his defense, and his offensive was invincible!

Not a single person could take a single hit from him!

It was impossible for anyone to tear through his defenses either!

As Huang Xiaolong sent his grand cosmos energy into the Universe Boat, intricate universe laws descended all of a sudden and restricted the strength of his opponents!

Even Jian Wushuang could only use eighty percent of his strength!

There wasn’t a need to mention Gui Chi and the others.

As one expert after another was sent flying, countless Gods of Creation fell to the ground.

Wu Xin and Ye Ye revealed bitter smiles. They thought that Huang Xiaolong would be unable to challenge so many experts on his own, and that was why they brought so much backup over. From the looks of it, they were sorely mistaken…

What the f*ck were they supposed to do when Huang Xiaolong could solo an entire army of God of Creation Realm cultivators alone?!

The experts on the Jian Family’s side were beaten black and blue by the one man army.

Jian Wushuang’s sword dao slashed at Huang Xiaolong again, but this time, he didn’t bother taking it head on. The Three Gods Halberd swept out, tearing his sword dao into pieces. Jian Wushuang was also sent tumbling through the air.

That was the difference between someone who had barely broken through the 20 billion units mark in combat strength, and someone who had 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy! Huang Xiaolong’s actual combat strength far surpassed the amount of grand cosmos energy he had too, and no one stood a fighting chance!

More than an hour later…

Countless experts were lying defeated on the ground in the inner hall of the Jian Family Palace. Other than Wu Xin, Ye Ye, Yu Xiaohong, Tao Han’er, and the others, not a single person who stood against Huang Xiaolong remained standing.

Zhu Jian was curled up in a ball in the corner of the hall and his body trembled violently.

Glancing at Zhu Jian once, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to deal with him.

One day later…

Everyone there submitted to Huang Xiaolong. Like how he controlled Wu Xin and Ye Ye, Huang Xiaolong branded their souls and wiped away the mark they originally had.

Huang Xiaolong revealed a look of joy when he saw the number of universe-level spiritual veins hovering in the air before him.

Those were the universe-level spiritual veins he obtained from Jian Wushuang and the rest!

Just those from Jian Wushuang, Gui Chi, Baixuan Tian, and Mei Jie amounted to two hundred!

Adding those from the other experts in the hall, he obtained a total of over six hundred strands of universe-level spiritual veins!

In the past, Huang Xiaolong cleaned out the experts of the Limitless Land and obtained more than a thousand universe-level spiritual veins. He had the feeling of limitless wealth then. Now, the feeling came back!

Adding on those he obtained in the auction, he had more than eight hundred strands of universe-level spiritual veins!

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a long breath.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After turning them all into universe qi, how much would he be able to improve?!

Could he reach the 26 billion units mark?

It was even possible for him to accumulate 27 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Huang Xiaolong tossed all of them into his Sun Moon Furnace.

After capturing Mei Jie, Huang Xiaolong knew that Zhu Chen would definitely realize that something was wrong. He knew he had to head over to catch Zhu Chen off guard before he became suspicious.

“Lord, are you going to the Zhu Lan City? I can follow you there.” Gui Chi said. “The Heavenly Peak in the Zhu Lan City is about to open and I wish to attempt it.”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly.

The Heavenly Peak was one of the mysteries of the Unknown Lands. The Heavenly Peak was born from the universe and it was said that it had the ability to temper one’s dao heart and assist one in comprehending the mysteries of the universe.

“Yes. In a month, the Heavenly Peak wil open!” Gui Chi replied respectfully.

“In that case, we’ll head over to the Zhu Lan City tomorrow.” Huang Xiaolong declared.

They needed a month to arrive at the Zhu Lan City if they set out from the Unparalleled City.

Gui Chi bowed, and Jian Wushuang cut in. “Lord, why don’t I go as well? I wish to take the chance to improve my sword dao on the Heavenly Peak.”

“Do all of you want to go as well?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Wu Xin, Ye Ye, and Yu Xiaohong.

They nodded awkwardly.

Naturally, they didn’t wish to miss that opportunity!

“Alright. We shall all head over together.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

The very next day, Huang Xiaolong’s party set off for the Zhu Lan City.

As Tao Han’er pestered him to bring her along, he laughed helplessly before agreeing.

As for the other Gods of Creation who didn’t wish to ascend the Heavenly Peak, Huang Xiaolong allowed them to do whatever they wished.

“Get someone to investigate Zhu Chen’s whereabouts.” Huang Xiaolong turned to Jian Wushuang and said.

They quickly received a report.

“Zhu Chen isn’t in the city?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Yes. Zhu Chen went to the Fengdu City in the Green Ghost Lands and will only be back after some time.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Green Ghost Lands?” Gui Chi was slightly taken aback. The Green Ghost Lands was controlled by Lord Green Ghost, and the Fengdu City was their capital city!”
