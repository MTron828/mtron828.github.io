Chapter 3361: Kill Order

 

Chen Haoguang and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as fear sprouted in their heart once again. 

“Are you Huang Xiaolong?!” Tao Wei stared at Huang Xiaolong with an annoyed expression.

“Are you the slave of whatever prince he is in the Immortal Reverence Empire?” Huang Xiaolong replied with a question of his own.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you!” An expert of the empire roared when he heard how disrespectful Huang Xiaolong was. “You’re just a peasant in the Deserted Galaxy! Do you know the consequences of disrespecting Lord Tao Wei?!” 

“Oh? Pray, tell…” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“You will be flogged a hundred times as a light punishment! If Lord Tao Wei is angry, we’ll throw you into the great prison!” 

Huang Xiaolong didn’t say a word as formless pressure dragged Tao Wei down from his seat.

Tao Wei couldn’t control his body as he slammed directly into the ground.

“You!” Tao Wei cried out in fright.

“I hate it when people act all arrogant before me,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. He swept his gaze across Chen Haoguang and the others and he saw that everyone was present. “I recall telling you that none of you will die with a complete corpse if you betrayed me…”

Chen Haoguang and the others panicked as they turned to stare at Tao Wei for help.

Crawling to his feet in embarrassment, Tao Wei sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, all of them have already submitted to the great Immortal Reverence Empire! They are currently serving the third prince, and even if you’re an expert in the Grand Completion Realm, you’ll be sentenced to death if you dare to touch them!” 

“Right now, you better…” Before he could complete his sentence, Huang Xiaolong swiped at the air and dragged Tao Wei over to himself.

“What were you saying again?” 

“Release Lord Tao Wei at once!” The experts of the empire leaped towards Huang Xiaolong as they took out their treasures.

It was too bad Liu Huang casually pointed at the air to summon a crimson sea. Waves of energy devoured those present.

When they were struck by the energy wave, all of them fell to the ground as miserable cries filled the skies.

Chen Haoguang and the others stared at Liu Huang in terror.

He dealt with more than four hundred Soul Condensation Realm experts with a single gesture!

The shock they got from Liu Huang far surpassed the fear they had felt from Huang Xiaolong when he revealed his strength in the past.

Everyone had ignored Liu Huang as he was too damn small! All of them thought that he was a pet raised by Huang Xiaolong, but he dealt with more than four hundred experts in the blink of an eye!

“Your Highness, please spare our lives!” Liang Yun pleaded. “Please, give me another chance!” 

The old ancestor of the True Essence Sword Gate sneered, “Liang Yun, there’s no need to beg him. Now that he offended His Third Highness, his fate will be worse than death!” 

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Since that’s the case, I’ll exterminate the Immortal Reverence Empire before killing you.”

He tossed the old ancestor of the Sword Essence Gate into the Sun Moon Furnace.

As for the rest, Huang Xiaolong ordered Liu Huang, “Kill them all. There’s no need to show mercy.”

Since they swore never to betray him, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t spare their lives.

The blood drained from their faces when they heard what he said.

“All of you, attack! Kill Huang Xiaolong right now!” A roar entered their ears as one of the old ancestors risked everything to charge at Huang Xiaolong. He self-destructed, hoping that he could bring Huang Xiaolong down with him.

An expert at the Soul Condensation Realm chose to self-destruct!

Who would have thought that he would choose such a way to die?

Since there was no way out, everyone realized that there was nothing else they could do. They stared at the cloud of smoke from the old ancestor’s self-destruction and they hoped that it would be enough to take Huang Xiaolong down. It was too bad they were greeted with the sight of a completely intact Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Haoguang and the others felt as though their souls were dunked into a pool of freezing water.

How is this possible?!

The explosion of a Soul Condensation Realm expert couldn’t harm Huang Xiaolong!

Liu Huang moved and his palm came crashing down from the skies. It sent Chen Haoguang and the others into the ground.

None of them were left with a complete corpse.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Tao Wei and the latter peed his pants.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to kill Tao Wei. Instead, he disappeared from the main hall of the Divine Court Sect in the blink of an eye.

Tao Wei looked at the piles of meat on the ground, and he retrieved a transmission symbol with his trembling hands.

In one of the giant manors on a certain planet in the Deserted Galaxy, a young man felt his veins popping when he read the report in his hand.

The youngster was clad in dragon robes, and he was the third prince of the Immortal Reverence Empire, Chen Zhong.

“Nearly crippled hundreds of my subordinates?!” He suppressed the anger in his heart, and he continued, “He even threatened to exterminate my empire!” 

That was the first time his subordinates saw him so angry.

“Your Highness, this…” a white-haired old man asked.

The man was one of the ten strongest experts under Chen Zhong. He was called Lin Baiyu. He was at the peak of the Ninth Level Grand Completion Realm.

Chen Zhong handed the report over to the others, and he said, “Look at this. Tao Wei just sent this report over.”

Everyone was shocked to read its contents.

“Suspected to be an expert at the Grand Completion Realm? He even brought a palm-sized pet that isn’t any weaker than him!” Lin Baiyu frowned when he read the report.

“Pet at the Grand Completion Realm? Could it be a divine beast from ancient times?” someone else asked.

“It’s possible.” Lin Baiyu’s eyes sparkled. “Legends have it that the ancient beasts can change their body structure as they please.” 

Chen Zhong harrumphed, “I don’t care if it’s a divine beast! Regardless of his identity, take him down!” 

“Pass down my order. Seal the Deserted Galaxy and search for his whereabouts!” 

“Send people over to earth to exterminate his clan!” 

“Yes, Your Highness!” 

Not long after he gave his order, Liu Huang said to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, Chen Zhong has already given the killing order.”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and continued on his way. He didn’t use the power of space at all. After half a day, he finally arrived at a massive planet. It was several thousand times the size of Earth.

That was the Immortal Reverence Star that housed the core of the Immortal Reverence Empire, and it was somewhere they had to cross in order to arrive at the center of the star river.
