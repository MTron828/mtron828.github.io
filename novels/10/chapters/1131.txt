When Chen Hao and Huang Xiaolong’s fists collided, unlike their imagined scene of Huang Xiaolong being knocked back, he stood firmly like an immovable mountain, whereas Chen Hao’s situation completely blew their mind. His right fist contorted, causing jagged bones to pierce out from shredded flesh as if they were sliced off by an invisible blade.

Starting from his five fingers, Chen Hao’s wrist and his whole arm were like a dry tree branch, snapped broken in several places before exploding into smithereens.

Bits of flesh and blood bloomed as Chen Hao’s body rolled and tumbled backward in the air just like a wheel, smashing into the group of Sky Dragon League members behind him.

The disciples who were too slow to dodge were sent flying in various directions, every bone in their bodies broken.

Boom!

Chen Hao smashed into the earth below, creating a deep pit.

An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, Cao Feng, and all the Sky Dragon League members were dumbfounded. Even Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling on the other side were shocked stiff on the spot.

A green glint shone in the depths of Ju Wufei’s eyes, his gaze that was fixed on Huang Xiaolong resembling a poisonous snake about to attack its prey. Inwardly, great waves of shock hit his heart.

A Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm kid actually knocked a Tenth Order expert back.

How strong was this Huang Xiaolong’s battle prowess?!

As the Giant Tribe Patriarch, Ju Wufei had seen numerous geniuses of the Vientiane World, but this was his first time seeing such a level of monstrous talent.

A chilling coldness spread out from Ju Wufei’s body like a terrifying gale, blowing away the ominous black clouds above.

Just when An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and the others thought he was going to suppress Huang Xiaolong, Ju Wufei spoke, “ Huang Xiaolong, I want to accept you as my godson. As long as you agree and vow to serve the Giant Tribe in the future, I can promise you unlimited power. After you advance to the Ancient God Realm, your status and authority would be second only to my own!”

What the...?!

Everyone’s eyes nearly fell out of their sockets from shock.

Ju Wufei wanted to accept Huang Xiaolong as his godson? He was even willing to give Huang Xiaolong unlimited power!

Ju Wufei was extremely calm while looking at Huang Xiaolong. His initial intention was to kill this Barbarian God Sect disciple, but now Huang Xiaolong’s talent changed his mind. After all, killing such a talent was too wasteful!

The corner of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth rose in a faint, cold smile as he looked at Chen Hao, “Accept me as your godson? What about him?”

“Nothing but a waste, as long as you agree to be my godson and submit to my Giant Tribe, I can kill him on the spot.”

Chen Hao swayed unsteadily as he struggled to his feet from the pit when he heard Ju Wufei’s words. His pale face turned several shades whiter due to fear and unease, anxiously pleading to Ju Wufei, “Godfather, don’t believe Huang Xiaolong’s skulduggery, he is treacherous at the core. He cannot be trusted!”

An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and the others had a complicated expression on their faces, never had they imagined that Ju Wufei would be willing to kill Chen Hao for Huang Xiaolong!

Cao Feng felt blood drain from her body, her limbs grew cold with fear as her feet unconsciously stepped back.

Ju Wufei raised his palm to the side without looking, striking Cao Feng. Her body made an arch across the air as her shrill scream reverberated through the area. Numerous rays of sword qi pierced through her body like long spikes, killing Cao Feng before she even hit the ground.

Unwillingness and disbelief were etched on her face.

The move Ju Wufei used was the Giant Tribe’s Giant Sword Palm.

Dense sword qi was compressed into the strike of a palm, causing the person struck by this technique to die while feeling the pain of thousands of swords piercing through their body.

An Zaixuan, Qiu Bihu, and all the Sky Dragon League were ghastly pale, while Chen Hao was terrified.

Ju Wufei didn’t even spare a glance at Cao Feng’s corpse, his gaze never leaving Huang Xiaolong. “What do you think? Earlier, this woman insulted you, and now I have killed her on your behalf. I will not restrict your freedom after becoming my godson, you can go wherever you please. On top of that, I will nurture you with the entire Giant Tribe’s available resources so you can break through to the Ancient God Realm within two hundred years!”

’Nurture you with all the Giant Tribe’s available resources’, just this condition made it hard for anyone to refuse.

All eyes were fixed on Huang Xiaolong, including Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling.

Before these gazes, Huang Xiaolong looked at Ju Wufei, shaking his head as a smile emerged while saying, “After I kill you, all the Giant Tribe’s resources would be mine just the same. Another thing is, do you think I need two hundred years to break through to the Ancient God Realm? However, if you submit to me and became my slave, I can consider sparing your life.”

Jaws dropped to the ground hearing Huang Xiaolong’s brazen words; Chen Hao included.

Ju Wufei threw his head back and laughed, whereas the several Giant Tribe Eminent Grand Elders were glaring at Huang Xiaolong, their thick murderous auras solidifying the air around them.

Ju Wufei shook his head, “Since you don’t know how to treasure the chance I gave you, I’m left with no choice but to kill you personally. As for your woman, Chen Hao can do as he sees fit.”

Chen Hao beamed with joy, “Many thanks, Godfather.”

Ju Wufei stepped toward Huang Xiaolong, saying, “Aren’t you going to call out that Second Order Ancient God Realm Green Ice Hail Devil? Since you’re unyielding, I guess you must have invited other Ancient God Realm asters to help you. Might as well tell them to come out as well!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, extremely accommodating. “It seems to me you really want to meet them, it’s my pleasure to introduce you.” The instant Huang Xiaolong’s finished speaking, a green frigid cold qi encroached the air as Bing Jiuyi appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

Lu Zhuo, Gu Ling, and the disciples standing on the Barbarian God Sect side were astounded at Bing Jiuyi’s existence.

It was no longer a secret that Huang Xiaolong had a Second Order Ancient God Realm Green Ice Hail Devil protecting him since he appeared several years ago when South Huai City was under sea beasts attack. Still, this was the first time Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling saw Bing Jiuyi with their own eyes.

In the next second, roiling nefarious energy soared to the sky behind Huang Xiaolong as a tall figure appeared.

“A Nefarious Devil master!”

Shouts were heard from both sides at Xie Tu’s appearance.

Though surprised, Ju Wufei did not see Bing Jiuyi and Xie Tu as a threat. He smiled at Huang Xiaolong, “As I expected, you really invited another Ancient God Realm master, but I didn’t expect it to be from the Nefarious Devil Tribe, a late-Second Order Ancient God Realm at that.”

Ju Wufei continued approaching Huang Xiaolong in large strides.

Right at this time, behind Huang Xiaolong, another tall figure appeared, exuding an even more powerful Nefarious Devil qi.

People on both sides were once again dumbfounded.

“An early Third Order Ancient God Realm Nefarious Devil master!” Finally, Ju Wufei’s calm face cracked a little.

The Nefarious Devil Tribe naturally possessed high battle prowess and an early Third Order Ancient God Realm had strength comparable to a mid-third Order Ancient God Realm, maybe even peak mid-Third Order human cultivator. Ju Wufei’s cultivation was just at late-Third Order Ancient God Realm, close to reaching peak late-Third Order Ancient God Realm.

“Huang Xiaolong, you really gave me a big surprise. You actually managed to invite a Third Order Ancient God Realm Nefarious Devil to help you, but you still have to die today!” Ju Wufei’s expression turned frosty and gloomy, leaping forward with his palm striking at Huang Xiaolong.

It was the Giant Sword Palm again. Palm force sliced forward and sword qi weaved in the air.

At the same time, the several Giant Tribe Eminent Grand Elders also acted, but their targets were Xie Tu, Xie Du, and Bing Jiuyi.

Facing the Giant Tribe Eminent Grand Elders’ attack, Bing Jiuyi, Xie Du, and Xie Tu wouldn’t be able to help Huang Xiaolong.

Ju Wufei grinned watching his attack loom over Huang Xiaolong.

Lu Zhuo and Gu Ling ignored the injuries on their bodies and were about to rush out to help Huang Xiaolong when a giant beast head silently emerged from the void behind him.
