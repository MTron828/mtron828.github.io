Chapter 3473: Saving Pangu

 

When Meng Tian felt the restrictions weakening, he started to panic. Rage filled his heart, but he realized that there was nothing he could do. His eyes slowly started to turn bloodshot.

In at most an hour, Huang Xiaolong would probably shatter the restrictions trapping Pangu.

He wouldn’t be able to return to the Meng Tian world even if he traveled at his fastest speed, much less the Meng Tian Divine Palace.

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll tear you limb from limb! I’ll torture your soul for eternity!” Meng Tian gnashed his teeth and spat.

In the Meng Tian Divine Palace, the experts responsible for guarding the area swarmed Huang Xiaolong like an endless tide.

As the strongest celestial empire in the Meng Tian Universe, the number of troops they had was basically uncountable. Even after half a day of killing, their numbers didn’t decrease in the slightest.

Huang Xiaolong’s expression turned frosty as he continued to slash at the restrictions trapping Pangu. Every time he waved his hand at the giant army surrounding him, blood rain would fill the skies as a large group of them would be turned to cosmic dust.

After more than an hour…

The Meng Tian Divine Palace started to shake as a blinding light filled the skies. The restrictions trapping Pangu were finally shattered by Huang Xiaolong!

Heaving a sigh of relief, Huang Xiaolong finally shattered the restrictions.

The space that trapped Pangu unraveled before Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. It was filled with a jade-green liquid that surrounded a giant who was tens of thousands of feet tall.

Veins were bulging from the giant’s body, and they were like dragons coiled around him. His massive arms boasted terrifying strength that seemed to be able to split a world in two.

Giant chains locked him up and they were attached to every limb.

Pangu!

Huang Xiaolong’s figure shook, and he appeared before the giant instantly.

Staring at the Pangu Axe in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, Pangu roared with laughter, “Nice! My disciple, you’re finally here!” 

He naturally knew that Huang Xiaolong had obtained his inheritance after seeing the axe in the kid’s hand.

“Master, I’ll destroy the restrictions on you right now!” The Pangu Axe slashed towards the chains around Pangu as soon as Huang Xiaolong spoke.

Clang!

A crisp ringing sound filled the air when the Pangu Axe landed on the chains.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned to discover that he only managed to slightly damage the chains.

“Meng Tian used countless treasures in order to refine the runes and chains around me. You can only use a type of yin strength to destroy the restrictions,” Pangu reminded him.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong slowly raised the Pangu Axe again.

Bang!

It followed a mysterious path as it sliced open the runes binding Pangu.

Shattering into a million pieces, the restriction lost all effect instantly and Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

If he managed to destroy the restrictions in the space trapping Pangu and not the runes around the man himself, things would be awkward. It was lucky that the Pangu Axe had fully recovered. Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong would never be able to do what he did.

“Nice!” 

“Hahaha!” 

Pangu roared with laughter, and he waved his hand in the air. A mysterious power gathered around him and an armor appeared around his body.

“Capture that b*stard’s son right now!” 

“Let’s leave this wretched place!” 

Pangu yelled.

Capture that guy’s son? Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned a little weird.

“Meng Tian laid down some restrictions in my body. I need his son’s bloodline in order to neutralize it,” Pangu explained. “Otherwise, we won’t be able to escape detection no matter where we run to.” 

Huang Xiaolongn no longer hesitated, and he released his dao souls to look for Meng Han. He had cleaved Meng Han in two previously, but Meng Han was a God of Creation after all. He had managed to reform his body and escape after Huang Xiaolong ignored him. In order to save Pangu, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with Meng Han. If he fled the divine palace, it would be extremely difficult to capture him again.

Huang Xiaolong panicked, and he tried desperately to locate Meng Han.

Luckily for him, he found him very quickly.

“Master, he’s at the entrance!” Huang Xiaolong yelled before the two of them rushed towards the entrance of the Meng Tian Divine Palace.

By the time they arrived, Meng Han had already left the palace. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care about anything else as he raced to catch up with Meng Han.

As Meng Han tried to make his escape, he sent Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han flying with a single slap.

Meng Han might be seriously injured by Huang Xiaolong, but he wasn’t a pushover. Gu Yuan and Long Yi weren’t strong enough to stop him.

Feeling Huang Xiaolong’s aura behind him, Meng Han no longer bothered with the three, and he yelled in desperation, “Stop them! Stop them right now!” 

Guards from the Meng Tian Divine Palace swarmed Huang Xiaolong and Pangu instantly.

Activating the grand formation around the Meng Tian World, Meng Han tried to stop Huang Xiaolong and Pangu who were rapidly closing in on him.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It didn’t take long for him to be captured by the master and disciple duo.

“Let’s go!” 

Without hesitation, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han as they left the Meng Tian World.

“We’ll look for a safe place before destroying the restriction he left on me,” Pangu said to Huang Xiaolong.

“Alright.”

Summoning the Purple Lightning Peak, he used his full strength to drive it forward and they disappeared into the void.

Half a day later, they arrived in a random world where they decided to deal with the restriction in Pangu’s body.

In order to do so, Pangu needed to use Meng Tian’s bloodline. After Meng Han learned what Pangu planned to do, he screamed in desperation, “My father will never let you off!” 

Pangu would definitely destroy Meng Han’s bloodline during the process, and it would definitely affect Meng Han’s progression to the large completion stage.

“That’s where you’re wrong,” Pangu snorted. “I won’t let you off!” 

He quickly used Meng Han’s bloodline in order to neutralize the restriction in his body.

Several days later, Pangu stood up and clenched his fist together. Feeling the power running through his body and Meng Tian’s restrictions gone, he roared with laughter before clapping Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders. “If not for you, I would have been trapped by Meng Tian for eternity!” 

A trace of embarrassment slowly filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

Looking at Meng Han whose face was as pale as a sheet of paper, Pangu grabbed him by the neck. “I’ll do to you a hundred folds what your father did to me back then!”

Despair filled Meng Han’s heart.
