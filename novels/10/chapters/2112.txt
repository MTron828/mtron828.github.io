Chapter 2113: Capturing Wan Zhuoyuan!

No matter how Yang Gang tried to escape, it was to no avail. It was as though some invisible force was holding down the godforce in his body.

Very quickly, he appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong, and a palm grabbed his neck. With his other free hand, Huang Xiaolong snatched away the map of the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool.

After looking over it, Huang Xiaolong realized that the map pointed out the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool’s location, and a smile slowly appeared on his face.

“Huang Xiaolong, how dare you move against me here! Are you not afraid of Lord Wan Shi?!” Yang Gang suppressed the fear in his heart as he yelled, “If you dare to kill me, Lord Wan Shi will appear immediately! When that happens, you’ll definitely die!”

He wasn’t scaring Huang Xiaolong. It was true that as soon as he died, his soul slip would shatter. Wan Shi and Wan Yue would learn about his death the instant he died!

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Relax. I won’t kill you. At least, not now. Why would I allow you to die such an easy death?”

When Yang Gang saw the sinister smile on Huang Xiaolong’s face, he realized that something was wrong. A shiver went down his spine as he stuttered, “What... What do you want?!”

“You’ll know what I want soon enough.” A cold light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he didn’t bother explaining himself to Yang Gang. Grandmist worms quickly materialized, and they charged into Yang Gang’s soul sea.

Before Huang Xiaolong, Yang Gang was like a defenseless baby. He wasn’t able to do anything, and his soul was controlled by Huang Xiaolong in an instant. Without wasting a second, Huang Xiaolong started to look through his memories.

He soon found the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens and learned of a way to enter. Even so, Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop as he continued to look through Yang Gang’s memories.

After nearly forty breaths of time, Huang Xiaolong finally released Yang Gang.

As soon as he stopped, Yang Gang returned to his senses. Before he could scream, Huang Xiaolong crushed his windpipe with a clench of his fist. Like a dead chicken, Huang Xiaolong grabbed Yang Gang by the neck as they disappeared from the manor.

Reappearing in the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong used another devastating soul refining art on Yang Gang. As Yang Gang cried out miserably, Huang Xiaolong threw him into one of the random palaces in the Ancient Heavenly Court.

Whatever the case, Yang Gang was a First Order Sovereign. With his sturdy soul, it would take seventy to eighty years before he would die from Huang Xiaolong’s soul refinement art.

After throwing Yang Gang into the Ancient Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong changed his appearance to look exactly like Yang Gang as he headed towards the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens.

Encompassing Heaven, the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens, was located in an independent space hidden in the mountain range behind the city.

After several minutes, Huang Xiaolong arrived in the space above the mountain range, and he scanned his surroundings. He could see a faint trace of the eight trigrams formed by the various mountain peaks, and a sneer soon formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Wan Shi really knows how to pick a place... The chaos spiritual energy here is so much denser compared to the outside world...

If one could open an independent space above the mountain range and direct the concentrated chaos spiritual energy towards that space, it would be the most ideal spot for secluded cultivation! Even Sovereign Realm experts would experience a boost in their cultivation speed!

Huang Xiaolong used everything he had learned from Yang Gang’s memory as he rapidly formed hand seals to affect the flow of the chaos spiritual energy around him. As rays of light emerged above him, a spatial crack soon appeared.

Huang Xiaolong flew into it without the slightest hesitation, and the scene before him changed. He appeared in a large space that seemed to have no end. His vision turned grey as traces of chaos spiritual energy drifted across the land. There were rows of strange trees growing along the land, and they seemed to give off faint traces of origin energy. All the origin energy given off by the trees flowed towards the heart of the space.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath.

Who would have thought that such a unique tree would exist in the world?!

If one could find a huge number of such divine trees, origin treasures would no longer be required! Cultivating in the heart of the space would produce heaven-defying results!

One had to know that even level-one origin treasures were extremely rare! As soon as a cultivator refined it, it was gone! The trees standing tall in front of Huang Xiaolong were different! As long as the trees lived on, they could produce endless amounts of origin energy!

Sweeping his divine sense across the land, Huang Xiaolong counted a total of two hundred and sixty-eight trees. Even though a single divine tree only gave off a minuscule amount of origin energy, the combined amount of origin energy produced by two hundred and sixty-eight trees could compare to a level one origin treasure!

A burning gaze appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Even though the divine trees wouldn’t be of much use to him, it would be extremely beneficial for experts like the little cow and Cang Mutian!

As long as he could obtain the trees, the little cow and the others would be able to increase their strength in a short amount of time!

Luckily for Wan Shi and the others, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t in a rush to collect all the trees. He stared at the heart of the space and noticed a figure hovering in the air.

As the figure swallowed copious amounts of chaos spiritual energy, and origin energy, the Sovereign aura around his body filled the space. Huang Xiaolong recognized the person with a single glance. It was Wan Zhuoyuan!

His lips curled upwards as he walked towards Wan Zhuoyuan. Since he didn’t hide his aura, Wan Zhuoyuan managed to detect his presence.

“Who?!” Alarm bells rang in Wan Zhuoyuan’s mind as his eyes snapped open. He leaped to his feet as he stared at ‘Yang Gang’ walking towards him.

It wasn’t long before he recognized Huang Xiaolong’s aura.

“Huang Xiaolong!” The expression on Wan Zhuoyuan’s face changed.

Seeing as the other party had already recognized him, Huang Xiaolong no longer messed about as he reverted back to his original appearance.

Even though Wan Zhuoyuan was shocked at Huang Xiaolong’s sudden appearance, he soon regained his calm. A sneer formed on his lips, “Huang Xiaolong, I was planning to look for you. Who would have thought that you would come to me? Great. Now I don’t have to waste my time looking for you!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ever since the battle in the World of Darkness, Wan Zhuoyuan had hidden himself in the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens to cultivate in seclusion. In order to leave Wan Zhuoyuan undisturbed, Wan Yue and Yang Gang hadn’t bothered telling him about Huang Xiaolong’s achievements. As such, Huang Xiaolong was a mere First Order Sovereign in Wan Zhuoyuan’s eyes.

When the words left his lips, Wan Zhuoyuan released his aura, and his Sovereign’s will filled the space around them. Encompassing Heaven, the forbidden area of the City of All-Heavens, shook.

“Huang Xiaolong, to tell you the truth, I have already broken into the Sovereign Realm for quite some time now! In fact, I’m about to step into the peak of the mid-First Order Sovereign Realm! I bet you didn’t expect that!” Wan Zhuoyuan roared with laughter and continued, “After becoming a Sovereign, my saint physique, saint bloodline, and Complete Dao Saint Godhead have improved tremendously! You’ll never be able to surpass me now!”

“Saint Dao! Everlasting World Ending Sword!”

The origin energy in Wan Zhuoyuan’s body moved as his fingers turned into sharp swords that pierced towards Huang Xiaolong. Sword qi filled the area as it threatened to grind Huang Xiaolong into dust.

The terrifying wave of sword qi soon arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

The look on his face didn’t change as Huang Xiaolong merely extended his right palm. With a clench of his fist, the sword qi exploded in mid-air. It dissipated to nothingness right in front of Wan Zhuoyuan’s eyes.

When Wan Zhuoyuan was still in a state of disbelief, Huang Xiaolong’s palm continued to fly towards his face. Before he could react, Wan Zhuoyuan felt his vision going dark.
