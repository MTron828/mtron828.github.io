Chapter 2580: Princess Qing Xuan

One month quickly went by.

In this one month, Huang Xiaolong mostly spent his days in cultivation, absorbing Cangqiong Holy Pills’ medicinal energies.

Since Huang Xiaolong wanted to conquer the Alien Lands, he was bound to encounter Primal Ancestor experts, and he needed to improve his strength in the shortest time possible.

Although he could defeat all True Saint Realm experts and was invincible below the Primal Ancestor Realm, there were risks involved when facing Primal Ancestor experts.

But if he could advance to Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm, he wouldn’t have a problem defeating a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor, or even a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor. It was especially true with the help of Cangqiong Blade. He could even fight against a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor if he went all out.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong had set advancing to Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm as his goal.

Huang Xiaolong distinctively felt that his strength had slightly improved during this one month of cultivation.

With three holy souls, twelve high-order Saint Fates, his Holy Mandate Imprint as well as Inextinguishable Dao Heart, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed was faster than any other Second Heaven True Saint by ten thousand times, or even one hundred thousand times.

It was not an exaggeration to say that a Second Heaven True Saint expert needed a million years, or even ten million years to step into Third Heaven True Saint Realm, but Huang Xiaolong could advance to Third Heaven True Saint in a hundred years, maybe less.

“One hundred years,” in the yard, Huang Xiaolong mumbled to himself as his eyebrows scrunched together.

One hundred years to reach Third Heaven True Saint Realm was shockingly scary speed for other cultivators, but for Huang Xiaolong, this speed was still too slow. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If he took one hundred years to break through to the Third Heaven True Saint Realm, then wouldn’t it take three to four hundred years for him to enter the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm?

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t wait three to four hundred years because the barrier separating the Alien Lands and Holy World would soon disappear temporarily in the next couple of hundred years. At that time, a large-scale war between the two sides would ensue. To prevent the heavy damages the Holy World was going to suffer, he needed to conquer the Alien Lands before that happened.

Moreover, after entering Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm in three to four hundred years, he could mostly fight at par against a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and that was far from enough to conquer the Alien Lands.

Although there was no Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert amongst the Alien Lands’ Primal Ancestor experts, there were Fifth and Sixth Resurrection experts!

Huang Xiaolong extended his palm and a streak of blood light flew out. The Flying Heaven Blood Stele hovered above his palm, exuding a devilish blood-colored glow.

The Flying Heaven Blood Stele was related to the Alien Lands’ Flying Heaven Race’s royal family’s secret. The Flying Heaven Race’s first generation patriarch, Fei Wushuang had found the Flying Heaven Blood Stele in the depths of World River at the end of Alien Land. The stele was the key to opening Fei Wushuang’s secret treasure trove. When Fei Wushuang had set out from the Alien Lands with the Flying Heaven Blood Stele, he had left a pile of all the good things he had collected through the years in one place.

Fei Wushuang’s secret treasure trove did not lack holy-grade materials and grand dao treasures that he had obtained from his travels through the Alien Lands, and there were many grand dao treasures Fei Wushuang had found from the World River’s depths.

Many of these holy-grade materials and grand dao treasures were beneficial to improving one’s cultivation.

If Huang Xiaolong could get his hands on those treasures, he had hope of advancing to Fourth Heaven True Saint in two hundred years, and with a stroke of luck, the time could be halved.

Then again, it was easier said than done to get his hands on Fei Wushuang’s secret treasure trove. The moment he arrived at the Flying Heaven Race with the Flying Heaven Blood Stele, he would be hunted down by the Flying Heaven Race’s experts in order to regain the Flying Heaven Blood Stele. The Flying Heaven Race would not permit the Flying Heaven Blood Stele and Fei Wushuang’s secret treasury to fall in another person’s hand, much less a human.

The Flying Heaven Race’s current patriarch, Fei Yanzi, was a mid-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor, therefore, before he had full confidence that he could suppress Fei Yanzi by force, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t appear at the Flying Heaven Race.

Huang Xiaolong collected the Flying Heaven Blood Stele back into his body, and summoned Hei Luo. After that he walked out of the Mysterious Ice Race’s Central Headquarters. He planned to stroll around Yang City’s trading market to see if there was anything good that he needed.

On the way to the trading market, the conversation of the alien race experts in front of them drifted to Huang Xiaolong’s ears, “I’ve heard that even the nearby Qing Xuan Holy Grounds’ Qing Xuan Holy Emperor will be attending the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s new disciple ceremony!”

“What?! Even Qing Xuan Holy Emperor is going to attend? Hong Zhen Holy Emperor actually managed to invite Qing Xuan Holy Emperor!”

“I swear it’s true! Not only Qing Xuan Holy Emperor will attend the ceremony, but he will also be bringing Princess Qing Xuan with him!”

AfterHearing that ‘Princess Qing Xuan,’ the several alien races’ experts’ eyes lit up with reverence and worship.

Huang Xiaolong’s interest was stoked hearing that.

Qing Xuan Holy Emperor?

The Qing Xuan Holy Emperor was the strongest person amongst the dozen holy grounds in the vicinity, and he was a Sixth Heaven True Saint, who was highly respected and had great prestige amongst these dozen holy grounds. Qing Xuan was also the Qing Xuan Race’s patriarch, as well as the Dissociation Domain Lord.

The beloved daughter of Qian Xuan Holy Emperor, Princess Qing Xuan, whose real name was Qing Ying, was both talented and beautiful. She had the reputation of being the most beautiful woman in these dozen holy grounds. Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t know if she was really the most beautiful woman in the area, but he was certain that her talent was not low.

Huang Xiaolong inwardly estimated that her talent rivaled some of the Holy Heavens organisations’ inner disciples.

The Holy Heavens organisation was one of the Holy World’s top forces, and comparing someone to an inner disciple of such a powerhouse was a recognition of Qing Ying’s talent. In other words, Qing Ying was outstanding even compared to the entire Alien Lands’ disciples.

Of course, her talents were not compared to his.

‘Still, when can my godheads evolve into the top ten ranks…?’ Huang Xiaolong sighed inwardly.

Previously at the Cangqiong Holy Manor, he had devoured Li Chen and Xie Bufan. Initially, Huang Xiaolong had thought that his three holy souls could evolve into the top ten ranks after devouring them, but in the end, his three complete dao saint godheads were still hovering outside the top ten ranks.

In between, he had refined and absorbed many True Saint experts’ saint attributes, but still his three complete dao saint godheads had not rushed into the top ten ranks.

However, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that the three complete dao saint godheads had been accumulating power all these years, and once their accumulation reached a certain point, they would evolve into the top ten ranks, or maybe even rush into the top five!

The thing was that although evolvable complete dao saint godheads represented heaven-defying talent, progress was undeniably difficult when nearing the top ten ranks.

For example, if Huang Xiaolong’s Golden Buddha Saint Godhead evolved to the fifth rank Myriad Creations Saint Godhead, no matter how many saint godheads he devoured, his complete dao saint godhead wouldn’t rise to the fourth-rank Great Immemorial Saint Godhead.

Despite being unable to evolve into the top ten ranks in a short time, as Huang Xiaolong continued to devour others’ saint attributes, the powers of his three complete dao saint godheads did grow stronger albeit the slow speed. Still, each of his saint godhead did not fall far behind the fourth-ranked Great Immemorial Saint Godhead.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo arrived at Yang City’s trading market.

Huang Xiaolong noticed that on this particular day, Yang City’s trading market was more crowded than usual, and he even spotted several groups of alien races’ experts from nearby holy grounds.

Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s apprenticeship ceremony was only a few months away. Hence, experts from various holy grounds had already started their journey to the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds. Not to mention that Yang Xity’s trading market was one of the largest trading markets in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds. Therefore, it was not strange that these alien races’ experts would stop by and take a look when passing by the city.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong and Hei Luo entered the trading market area, the crowd around them stirred in excitement. Many of the alien races’ disciples were swarming towards the trading market’s entrance with excited expressions.

“Princess Qing Xuan is here in Yang City! I heard she’s heading to the trading market here!” Some of the alien race’s disciples said excitedly to their companions.
