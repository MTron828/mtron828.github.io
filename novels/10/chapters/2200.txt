Chapter 2201: Meeting Feng Tianyu

After digging through his memories, Huang Xiaolong did not make things difficult for the other party and released Pan Luo.

“Who are you?!” Pan Luo stared at Huang Xiaolong as anger and shock filled his mind.

“I’m Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong said indifferently.

“What? You... You’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Pan Luo and the rest of the disciples retreated hastily when they heard his identity.

They were discussing how Huang Xiaolong had killed the Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen. Never in their wildest imagination would they have expected Huang Xiaolong to appear before them!

“That’s right, I’m Huang Xiaolong!” Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised at their reactions in the slightest.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong, what are you doing in our 33 Heavens Country? What do you want from us?” Pan Luo boldly asked in a quavering voice.

Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at Pan Luo before shaking his head. He disappeared without replying.

Pan Luo and the rest of the disciples stared at the blank space before them and realized that Huang Xiaolong was gone. They stood rooted to their spot for a long time as confusion filled their minds. Did Huang Xiaolong just let them go?

After he left, Huang Xiaolong flushed towards the next mountain range. Wherever he went, he expanded his divine sense in order to locate Feng Tianyu.

Not long after he left, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s appearance in the 33 Heavens Country started to spread among the higher-ups of the 33 Heavens Race. Even though they didn’t react strongly on the surface, waves of unease battered their hearts.

Everyone was confused as Huang Xiaolong hadn’t killed a single expert ever since entering the 33 Heavens Country.

Four days later.

Huang Xiaolong landed on a mountain peak in the north of the 33 Heavens Country.

He had been searching every corner of 33 Heavens Country for the past four days and found no traces of Feng Tianyu. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Seems like Feng Tianyu isn’t here...” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

It seemed as though the only way he could locate Feng Tianyu was to head over to the Desert of Extremities to find his son, Feng Yao!

The Desert of Extremities was a dangerous place in the depths of the Heavens Path located far away from the 33 Heavens Country. The roads were so heavily blocked that it took Huang Xiaolong more than ten days to arrive even when he traveled at his maximum speed.

As he looked at the rolling black sandstorm in the Desert of Extremities, Huang Xiaolong considered riding the Golden Pig Treasure. However, he stopped when he noticed the flash of a shadow rushing inside the black sandstorm. The black figure slowly emerged from the boundless desert.

A lightning dragon curled around himself, and he seemed to be the central figure in the giant sandstorm. He was like an ancient lightning god who had emerged from the Desert of Extremities.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the man with his eyebrows raised.

What a formidable aura!

“Feng Yao?” Huang Xiaolong asked slowly.

The aura the other party emitted was strong and it was clear that his strength was on par with Hao Wei, if not higher. With the way the lightning dragon swirled around him, it went without saying that his control of lightning was much stronger than the super experts of the 33 Heavens Race.

In Yang Tianchen’s memory, the 33 Heavenly Race’s Young Patriarch, Feng Yao, was the third strongest individual in the race.

“That’s right, I’m Feng Yao. I greet Master Huang Xiaolong.” The figure who had emerged from the sandstorm greeted Huang Xiaolong politely. It seemed as though he had already predicted that Huang Xiaolong would come to the Desert of Extremities, and he was waiting for him.

“Since you know I’m looking for you, then you should know why I’m here.” Huang Xiaolong stared at Feng Yao.

Feng Yao raised his jaded green brows and nodded, “I know that Master Huang is looking for my father. In fact, he was the one who told me to wait for you.”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of shock running through his heart.

“My father is waiting for you at the heavenly gates of the 33 heavens.” Feng Yao went on.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Feng Yao in shock.

Feng Tianyu was already waiting for him at the gates of the 33 heavens, namely the 33 Heavenly Gates!

Why was there a need to wait for him?

“Master Huang Xiaolong, please come with me.” Feng Yao said as he entered the Desert of Extremities once again.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a moment before riding on the Golden Pig Treasures. He followed behind Feng Yao and despite the other party’s strength, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that Feng Yao would play any tricks.

Huang Xiaolong used his aura to lock on to the other party. If Feng Yao tried anything funny, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t hesitate to kill him!

As they went deeper and deeper into the desert, the sandstorm grew stronger and stronger. The black sand blocked out the surroundings and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see anything past the curtain of black sand. The lightning around the two of them grew stronger and stronger to the point where ordinary Tenth Order Sovereigns would be injured by it!

The Golden Pig Treasure under Huang Xiaolong released a resplendent golden glow and blocked out both the sand and lightning.

The only surprise Huang Xiaolong had was that the lightning swirling around Feng Yao was strong enough to stop the violent streaks of lightning in the surroundings!

“Don’t mind my little skills, Master Huang.” Feng Yao turned to Huang Xiaolong and said.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “Your art of lightning control is comparable to Yang Tianchen. It’s not weaker than mine...” Huang Xiaolong was not trying to be modest. No matter how strong his battle prowess was, his art of lightning control couldn’t be compared to Feng Yao.

As the two of them made some small talk along the way, they learned a little bit about each other.

Huang Xiaolong realized that even though Feng Yao was the young patriarch of the 33 Heavens Race and had impressive strength, he was a modest, polite, and calm individual. He was indeed a person worth befriending.

Two days later, the two of them crossed the Desert of Extremities and continued on their journey.

“Master Huang, there are two paths to the 33 Heavenly Gates, you can head over there from the space outside the 33 Heavens or you can cross the Desert of Extremities. It’s much safer to cross the desert compared to the space outside the 33 heavens...” Feng Yao said.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. He had long since learned about this from the Giant Kun Ruler and Yang Tianchen when he had searched their memories.

Even though the route from the Desert of Extremities to the 33 Heavenly Gates was much safer, it was much longer than if he were to head over there from the space outside the 33 heavens. If he had to choose, there was no way he would cross the desert again. Now that he had gathered all nine great lightning pools, he had no fear of lightning and he could easily destroy the restrictions in the space outside the 33 heavens.

Half a month passed and both of them finally arrived at the 33 Heavenly Gates.

The Heavens Path was covered in lightning and at the edge of the Heavens Path stood an indescribably tall gate that was pearl-white in color. A massive lightning storm was raging above the gates and the power contained behind a single lightning bolt was so strong that it could blast an ordinary Tenth Order Sovereign to dust.

Ten meters below the lightning storm sat a figure who had his legs crossed.

His looks were ordinary and he looked harmless. However, the lightning bolts falling from the lightning storm failed to strike him.

“Feng Tianyu!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered.

Even though the Giant Kun Ruler was titled as the number one expert in the Heavens Path, the true experts knew that Feng Tianyu, the leader of the 33 Heavens Race, was the strongest person in the Heavens Path!

There were a lot of speculations made about Feng Tianyu’s powers and cultivation realm, but Huang Xiaolong knew that he had long since exceeded the peak of the late-Tenth Order Sovereign Realm. He was a half-step Venerable Realm cultivator!

“Brother Huang, I’ve been waiting for you.” The cross-legged Feng Tianyu opened his eyes.
