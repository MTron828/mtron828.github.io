Chapter 3001: The Battle Begins!

As a multitude of lights flashed through Feng Ming’s eyes, he wanted to say something but he swallowed his words eventually.

…

The day of the battle quickly arrived.

Even though there were still several hours before the start of the battle, the number of spectators had already crossed the billion mark. There were flying ships everywhere, and experts were riding on their mounts as they hovered in the skies around the battlefield. As the Son of Creation, Huang Xiaolong’s reputation in the Divine Tuo Holy World was like the sun in the midday sky. As for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, he was the strongest expert in the Divine Tuo Holy World, and it could be said that his reputation surpassed even that of Huang Xiaolong! The battle between them was sure to shake the foundations of the Divine Tuo Holy World, and practically all the Dao Venerables and Primal Ancestors from the Holy Dragon World were present to witness the battle.

Even the experts who were not part of the Dragon Race rushed over to catch a glimpse of the battle!

When the time finally came, a shocking rumor started to spread.

“Huang Xiaolong’s power of absolute frost had already reached perfection state! He reached the major completion in his control over absolute poison, and he already refined the Huang Long Armor!”

“Not only does Huang Xiaolong control the power of absolute frost, he also controls the power of absolute blaze and the power of nirvana! His ability to use absolute poison isn’t weak at all, and he controls the power of lightning! He controls five different types of ultimate energies alone, and the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor shouldn’t look down on him!”

The news caused the Holy Dragon World to tremble once again.

“What?! Huang Xiaolong reached perfection stage in the power of absolute frost?! He even reached the major completion stage in the power of absolute poison!”

“He controls five different types of energies!”

The experts who were waiting for Huang Xiaolong to embarrass himself felt their hearts swaying after they heard the news.

“In the Mystical Pavilion Branch in the Dragon Fish Creed, Huang Xiaolong managed to defeat the Heart Devourer Twin Devils when he was only a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable! Now that he entered the Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, he might actually be a match for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor! Not to mention the fact that he reached perfection stage in the powers of absolute frost… He even has the Huang Long Armor!”

“So what! Even so, he’s a mere Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable. He might possess the Huang Long Armor, but he might not be a match for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor! The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor reached perfection level in both the powers of lightning and darkness, and his strength isn’t something a mere Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable can match up to!”

“The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor managed to fully combine the powers of lightning and darkness together, and his strength is at an unfathomable level!”

“Why else would the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor be hailed as the number one expert in the Divine Tuo Holy World after so many years?!”

The experts of the various creeds and super races started to quibble with each other.

Some of them felt that Huang Xiaolong was a match for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, but some felt that Huang Xiaolong’s defeat was imminent.

Somewhere in the depths of the Dragon Cloud Sea…

The experts of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race were waiting for the battle to begin, and a grand ancestor of the race, Ao Qinlei, spoke up. “Patriarch, if the rumors are true and Huang Xiaolong reached perfection stage in the powers of absolute frost, things might get troublesome. Especially so if he fully refined the Huang Long Armor.”

Ao Ji, the patriarch of the Radiant Winged Dragon Race, shook his head, “Those might just be rumors. The Dragon Fish Dao Venerable and the others might have made it up on the fly hoping that the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor will back off. No matter how talented Huang Xiaolong is, he won’t be able to reach grand completion in one of the peak-level energies in the short time he spent cultivating. He might actually possess five different types of peak-level energies, but his ability to control absolute frost wouldn’t be at perfection level!”

“Yeah… Even the Poison Bodach and the others couldn’t reach perfection stage after cultivating for a long time! How long has it been since Huang Xiaolong rose to fame? There’s no way his power of absolute frost is at perfection level!” Another grand ancestor from the Radiant Winged Dragon Race sighed.

“Even if the rumors are true, he won’t be a match for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.” The Radiant Wing Patriarch sighed. “None of you understand what it means to reach perfection level in two types of energies. It’s a terrifying power, more scary than you can ever imagine!”

That was how the Radiant Winged Patriarch evaluated the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor’s strength!

He might be the second strongest expert in the Holy Dragon World, but he knew that he wasn’t a match for the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor! If they fought, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to last for a single second against the old ancestor!

He wouldn’t forget his previous battle with the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor as long as he lived. The dark light unleashed by the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor completely overwhelmed him.

“The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor is here!” Someone in the crowd screamed. Everyone turned to stare in the direction of the Dragon Cloud Sea, and a massive flying ship tore through the skies.As the only peak-grade cosmos artifact level flying ship, the Holy Dragon Flying Ship was the number one flying ship in the Holy Dragon World!

Dao Venerables lined the bow of the ship, and the person standing at the very front was the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor!

Seeing as the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor had arrived, the Dragon Cloud Sea erupted into a flurry of activities. Those Dao Venerables and Primal Ancestors who were seeing the old ancestor for the first time felt a rush of excitement in their hearts.

Before the Holy Dragon Flying Ship entered the Dragon Cloud Sea, a path was already cleared out for it. The experts lined the side of the path as they bowed respectfully.

Feng Ming, Ao Ji, and the other patriarchs who had arrived before the Holy Dragon Race approached the Holy Dragon Flying Ship as they paid their respects to the old ancestor.

“Huang Xiaolong is too damn arrogant! The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor has already arrived, but he’s nowhere to be seen!” Someone in the crowd yelled.

“That’s right! He might be the Son of Creation, but the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor is the strongest person in the Divine Tuo Holy World! The old ancestor beat back the army of the demons from the Outer World alone, and if not for his timely assistance, the Divine Tuo Holy World would have suffered from serious damages! Half of the Divine Tuo Holy World would have already been taken over by the demons!”

There were many experts who were extremely unhappy with Huang Xiaolong’s behavior.

No matter how talented Huang Xiaolong was, his reputation would never match up to the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor.

The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor was the number one expert of the Divine Tuo Holy World, and his prestige was built over countless years. It was something no one else could shake.

When Feng Ming heard the discussion in the crowd, he whispered to the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor, “Brother Dark Lightning, if you make your move later, there’s no need to hold back. Huang Xiaolong killed too many experts while relying on his identity as the Son of Creation, and he’s a menace to the Divine Tuo Holy World! Only Brother Dark Lighting will be able to teach him a lesson! Brother Dark Lightning can help him tone his arrogance down a notch.”

Laughing casually, the Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor explained, “With his ability to control absolute frost at perfection level, it will be difficult for me to defeat him. Especially since he has already fully refined the Huang Long Armor.”

“World Master Dark Lightning is being too humble…” The Radiant Winged Patriarch chuckled, “Huang Xiaolong is not your opponent!”

The Dark Lightning Holy Dragon Ancestor chuckled slightly, and he didn’t say a word.

Indeed, he was confident he could suppress Huang Xiaolong even if the kid fully refined the Huang Long Armor and reached the perfection in his control over absolute frost.
