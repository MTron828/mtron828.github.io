Chapter 3381: Don’t Take Up Too Much Time

“What?! It’s actually Immortal King Chen Keyu! He’s the youngest Immortal King in our Dongsheng God Continent!”

“That’s him! I saw him at a banquet I attended previously!”

Many founding ancestors and patriarchs broke out into an uproar.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The youngest, and most handsome Immortal King in the Dongsheng God continent actually appeared before their very eyes! He seemed to be invited by the Heavenly Silkworm Founder to assist them!

As the most famous Immortal King in the Dongsheng God Continent, it went without saying that his talent and cultivation speed was something others would never match up to.

His cultivation realm had already reached the peak of the late-Ninth Level Immortal King Realm!

Moreover, his master was Great General Zhao Qi from the Heavenly Court!

One could only imagine how strong his backing was!

Even the city lord, Song Zhipeng, and the experts of the city lord's mansion were shocked.

“Brother Chen Keyu, welcome!” Song Zhipeng walked towards Chen Keyu while cupping his fists and he greeted him respectfully.

“We greet Lord Chen Keyu!”

“Greetings to Senior Chen Keyu”

The founding ancestors, patriarchs, and leaders of their various factions went over to greet him.

As he stood by Lu Ming’s side, Chen Keyu nodded slightly. He replied to Song Zhipeng’s greeting. “City Lord Song Zhipeng, good to meet you. I didn’t think that you would come for the Shushan Immortal Gate’s apprenticeship ceremony. Do you know Mu Shuihan?”

“I do not. However, I heard of the ceremony. I hope Brother Chen will not misunderstand.”

He tried to explain himself as he didn’t wish for anyone to get the wrong idea about his relationship with Chen Keyu.

Lei Hongli, the founding ancestor of the Eastern Buddhist Immortal Gate, continued, “It’s the same for me.” After he spoke, he retreated. He widened the gap between Wang Lin and the experts of the Shushan Immortal Gate.

The other founding ancestors and experts were the same. They found all the excuses they could to open the distance between themselves and the Shushan Immortal Gate.

There were even some who tried to explain themselves out of the mess even though they had pretty good relationships with the Shushan Immortal Gate.

In an instant, the Shushan Immortal Gate was isolated from the others.

No one could blame the experts for doing so. After all, Chen Keyu represented a great general of the Heavenly Court!

Even without his master’s reputation, Chen Keyu was a cultivator at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Immortal King Realm! None of them could afford to offend someone like him!

No one there was a fool. Everyone could see that Lu Ming was out for blood. From what it looked like, he planned to flatten the Shushan Immortal Gate by the time he left! No one in their right mind would throw themselves into the fire!

Wang Lin looked at everyone who was trying to distance themselves from the Shushan Immortal Gate, and he roared in anger, “You…”

“Wang Lin, your Shushan Immortal Gate brought this upon yourselves. You offended the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate, and offended Lord Chen Keyu!” Sui Yun, the founding ancestor of the Floating Light Immortal Gate snorted righteously.

Wang Lin’s expression changed in an instant.

Sui Yun used to be extremely close to his master, Mu Shuihan. In the past, the Shushan Immortal Gate assisted the Floating Light Immortal Gate with everything they had when the latter ran into trouble. That was the only reason the founding ancestor of the Floating Light Immortal Gate was still alive.

“Sui Yun, you’re biting the hand that fed you!” Wang Lin roared in anger.

Sui Yun’s complexion turned dark, and he growled, “Wang Lin, our immortal gates have no relationship with each other! Stop trying to lump us in with you!”

The experts of the Shushan Immortal Gate roared with fury when they heard what he said.

“Enough.” Chen Keyu snorted, “Today, we’re dealing with some private matters between my Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate and the Shushan Immortal Gate. I hope everyone can remain quietly at the side.” Turning to Lu Ming, he ordered, “Lu Ming, do it. There’s no need to waste any more time. I will be visiting the Mysterious Blue Manor later. They obtained a batch of Chaos Immortal Fruits, and they invited me over to have a taste of it.”

Everyone felt their hearts pounding in shock when they heard what they said,

The master of the Mysterious Blue City was extremely famous. It was said that he had broken into the Immortal Venerable Realm, and his background was unfathomable. Even the Immortal Emperor would have to show some respect when talking to the man.

As for the Chaos Immortal Fruit, that was one of the most precious immortal fruits in the Immortal World! No one would be able to buy it with money! Even if they could, they would have to fork out an unbelievable amount of money in order to get one! Even city lords like Song Zhipeng wouldn’t be able to pay the price.

A single Chaos Immortal Fruit would cost upwards of a hundred thousand high-grade immortal spirit stones!

Zhi Songpeng could get some fruits that cost in the ten thousands, but there was no way he could afford a Chaos Immortal Fruit!

“Alright, boss!” Lu Ming, the founding ancestor of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate nodded respectfully.

When they heard how Lu Ming addressed Chen Keyu, everyone sucked in a cold breath. At the same time, they heaved a sigh of relief. It was lucky that they drew a line between themselves and the Shushan Immortal Gate.

The experts of the Shushan Immortal Gate felt the blood draining from their faces.

Lu Ming walked towards Wang Lin and snorted, “Call Mu Shuihan out here! It’s time for him to die!”

Suppressing the fright in his heart, Wang Lin snorted, “Lu Ming, you better watch out! When Senior Huang and my master emerge from the immortal region, you’ll die a horrible death!”

“Senior Huang?!” Lu Ming sneered. “Who the f*ck is that. Do you really think that he can save your Shushan Immortal Gate?!”

He had heard about Huang Xiaolong, but he didn’t really care. After all, no matter how strong Huang Xiaolong was, he wouldn’t be Chen Keyu’s opponent.

Wang Lin’s expression sank. He couldn’t be sure that they could get out of it alive. After all, Chen Keyu’s reputation was too large! He was the most famous Immortal King in the Dongsheng God Continent! It was said that he was summoned by the Celestial Emperor in the past!

As for ‘Senior Huang,’ who ascended from the mortal world like his master, they used to be mere mortals! How could he protect the Shushan Immortal Gate?

All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s palm smashed into Wang Lin’s chest. He was sent flying, and he crushed god knows how many structures along his way. He smashed heavily into the main palace, causing it to collapse.

Even with the peak-grade immortal armor on his body, Wang Lin spat out mouthfuls of blood.

He might be the patriarch of the Shushan Immortal Gate and possessed a considerable amount of strength, he was a mere Fourth Level Golden Immortal. There was no way he could defend himself against a Ninth Level Golden Immortal like Lu Ming!

The members of the Shushan Immortal Gate felt despair filling their hearts. Before they could save Wang Lin, they were stopped by the members of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate.

Taking another step, Lu Ming arrived before Wang Lin. With a wave of his hand, he swept away the broken shards of stone on Wang Lin’s body before growling, “I’ll behead you right now before entering the immortal region to kill your master and the dog whose surname is ‘Huang’!” The sword in his hand slashed at Wang Lin’s neck after the words left his lips.

Lei Hongli and the others felt a complicated feeling welling up in their hearts. Just a moment ago, they were celebrating with the Shushan Immortal Gate. Now, they were about to be exterminated!

The Shushan Immortal Gate wouldn’t live past tomorrow!

That was the norm in the Immortal World. As long as one offended someone they shouldn’t, they would be exterminated the next day!

Right before the sword could behead Wang Lin, it stopped in mid-air.
