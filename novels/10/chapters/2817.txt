Chapter 2818: Arrogant Fool!

Yi Xiaotang harrumphed in response. However, she was too lazy to speak to him. Instead of quarreling with Xu Jian, her gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong.

A trace of suspicion flashed through her eyes as she had witnessed everything that went down.

There was no mistaking it. The Saint Devil Prince had used the Nether Spirit Art against Huang Xiaolong, but the kid took it without the slightest difficulty!

Could he really be resistant to the secret art? Or does he possess a grand dao treasure capable of resisting it?

The Immemorial Dao Venerable was a mid-level Dao Venerable, and he might have just possessed some sort of treasure capable of resisting the Nether Spirit Art.

She snapped as she stared straight at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, I’ll give you a piece of advice right now. Hand the treasury over to me. With your eight high-order Saint Fates, my father will definitely take care of you if you hand over the treasury obediently and enter my Blue Heaven Creed.”

“Moreover, Ancestor Wang Jin is planning to take you in as a personal disciple! This is a once in a lifetime chance, and you better learn how to cherish it!”

Yi Xiaotang wasn’t lying. Wang Jin was the strongest Dao Venerable in the Blue Heaven Creed, and it was definitely the luckiest thing that could happen to anyone if he accepted them as a disciple!

A chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “I’m not interested in being a disciple of whatever ancestor your creed has to offer…”

He isn’t interested?!

As soon as the words left his lips, Yi Xiaotang wasn’t the only one who felt that she was going crazy. Everyone around felt as though their brains were fried.

Snickering in his heart, the Saint Devil Prince spoke to Yi Xiaotang, “Senior Sister Xiaotang, you saw it for yourself. He’s an arrogant b*stard who doesn’t know how to accept your goodwill. Did you forget about how he nearly slashed you in half when you were leaving the immortal cave?”

The Saint Devil Prince brought up the shameful incident once again.

The moment he did, a trace of hatred flashed in Yi Xiaotang’s eyes. She thought about how she wasn’t thanked when she had stopped the Saint Devil Prince previously, and her expression sank.

“Senior Sister Xiaotang, Huang Xiaolong is someone hunted down by our creed. It shouldn’t be against the rules for us to take him down…” Xu Jian turned to stare at Yi Xiaotang, “Senior Sister, this…”

A cold snort left her lips. “From this moment on, you can do whatever you want. Take it as I didn’t say anything before.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

A look of joy flashed through Xu Jian’s eyes.

She was clearly telling him to take care of Huang Xiaolong.

As long as she didn’t interfere, Huang Xiaolong’s death was certain!

Aunt Qing wanted to speak, but she decided against it when she saw the anger in Yi Xiaotang’s eyes.

The Saint Devil Prince turned to sneer at Huang Xiaolong. The Blue Heaven Dao Venerable, along with Wang Jin, would be arriving at the Silver Dragon River soon. If Huang Xiaolong became Wang Jin’s disciple, wouldn’t he rank higher in the hierarchy? That was something Xu Jian was unwilling to see.

After all, Wang Jin’s status in the Blue Heaven Creed was higher than his master's!

He knew that he needed to cripple Huang Xiaolong before they arrived.

Even though he might incur the wrath of the strongest Dao Venerable in the Blue Heaven Creed, he was betting on the fact that his master would plead for mercy on his behalf.

A malicious smile formed on his face as he walked towards Huang Xiaolong. Waving his hand, he ordered for the Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor to fall back. He wanted to personally destroy a genius like Huang Xiaolong.

When he finally arrived ten meters away from the kid, Xu Jian sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, you harmed me with the Immemorial Grand Formation previously. We’re not in the immortal cave right now, and you’re nothing more than an ant to me! I’ll crush you however I like!”

“Even without the formation, you’re nothing but trash in my eyes. I don’t need to use the formation against someone like you.” A placid expression could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he spoke to Xu Jian.

Bursting into laughter, Xu Jian decided to kill Huang Xiaolong in the most painful way possible.

Yi Xiaotang turned to Aunt Qing when she heard what he said. “Did you hear that? He’s such an arrogant b*stard!”

“He deserves to die!”

“He even thinks that he’s strong enough to take on the Saint Devil Prince without the Immemorial Grand Formation!”

Aunt Qing shook her head silently while looking at Huang Xiaolong.

“Even so, I can’t believe that he’s already at the Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm. Could there really be an inheritance left behind by the Immemorial Dao Venerable in the treasury?” Yi Xiaotang muttered to herself.

When Huang Xiaolong had appeared with Fu Daosheng in the Silver Dragon City, she received the news from the members of the Blue Heaven creed. When news of his strength started to spread, the region was ablaze with activity.

Guesses flew about and there were a ton of people who felt that Huang Xiaolong managed to obtain the Immemorial Dao Venerable’s inheritance!

There was no other explanation for his sudden increase in strength!

Even Yi Xiaotang felt that that was the case.

Whatever the case, entering the Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm in several dozen years was something unheard of.

The quick increase easily demonstrated Huang Xiaolong’s strength.

Even if he couldn’t compare to the top geniuses in the Divine Tuo Holy World, he should be comparable to the super geniuses in the super creeds, right?

She stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated gaze.

She was stuck in a dilemma and didn’t know if she should stop Xu Jian from crippling him.

It was too bad Xu Jian didn’t give her any time to gather her thoughts. With his body disappearing from its original location, a muddy yellow light surrounded his palms as he struck it towards Huang Xiaolong. The light looked weak, but it contained the weight of several million mountain ranges.

Those were the grand dao laws of the earth, and the ability to control weight to that extent could only appear after one comprehended the laws of the earth to the extreme! There was a trace of power that came from the origin when he attacked, and even though the power wasn’t comparable to the absolute flame or frost controlled by Huang Xiaolong, it was powerful enough.

Even Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors would be shattered to pieces if they were struck, much less a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor like Huang Xiaolong.

Bang!

A dull thud rang through the skies as Xu Jian’s palms landed on Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders.

With her expression sinking, Yi Xiaotang felt a sense of regret.

Aunt Qing’s face changed too.

With a brilliant smile blossoming on his face, Xu Jian wanted to take a look at his handiwork. However, his smile froze when he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders. With a trace of disbelief, he turned to look at his arms.

When the others realized what had happened, an incredulous look appeared on their faces. They looked at Huang Xiaolong as though he was a monster. He had taked Xu Jian’s strike without moving a muscle!

Not a single scratch!

Xu Jian’s attack didn’t affect him in the slightest!
