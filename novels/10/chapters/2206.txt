Chapter 2207: Can't Even Take Care of a Useless Fool!

The young man was precisely Zhang Wenyue’s younger brother, Zhang Haochen. Of course, in large households such as their family, the family dynamics were a little special. He was her brother from another mother.

Zhang Haochen frowned when he heard what Wang Junhai said. “I’ve heard about him... Isn’t he a cripple with shattered meridians and a broken spirit sea? What’s my sister thinking? Why did she rescue such a useless b*stard? Isn’t the Elegant Courtyard reserved for important guests of our Prince Qian Mansion? Why did she arrange for him to stay there?”

“Go. Get some men to chase that kid out from the Elegant Courtyard. When my friend arrives, arrange for him to stay in the Elegant Courtyard!”

Wang Junhai was overjoyed when he heard the young master’s order. He had long since wanted to get rid of that ugly b*stard. With the little prince’s order, he could finally vent his frustration! If that piece of sh*t dared to resist, he wouldn’t hesitate to teach him a lesson!

“Yes, Young Master!” Wang Junhai smiled respectfully. However, he paused for a second and asked, “But Young Master, do we chase that kid out of the manor?”

Zhang Haochen thought for a while and shook his head, “Even though he’s a useless cripple, my sister saved him and brought him back. Arrange a room in the Cool Breeze Courtyard after chasing him out of the Elegant Courtyard.”

The Cool Breeze Courtyard was the living quarters of the servants of the manor. There was no lack of rooms. It went without saying that the living conditions in the Cool Breeze Courtyard and the Elegant Courtyard were as different as heaven and earth.

Spiritual Wood Jade Artifacts were scattered all around the Elegant Courtyard. It was extremely beneficial for cultivation, and there were numerous spiritual flowers and divine trees planted in the courtyard for one to maintain a peaceful mind.

In the Cool Breeze Courtyard, there was no need to mention Spiritual Wood Jade Artifacts. Even the building was constructed from ordinary materials!

“Young Master, don’t worry! I’ll get rid of the kid immediately!” Wang Junhai replied respectfully.

Zhang Haochen nodded his head before sending Wang Junhai off with a wave of his hand.

Bowing respectfully, Wang Junhai took his leave. He hastily gathered several guards and marched his way to the Elegant Courtyard.

When Wang Junhai was making his way over, Huang Xiaolong was cultivating his palm techniques peacefully in his courtyard.

After three days of recovery, he could already walk around. As the weather was clear and sunny, Huang Xiaolong felt that it was time for him to enjoy the outdoors as he cultivated his Eight Desolate Holy Palm and Final Boundless Sword Art.

He had obtained both skills from Wan Zhuoyuan’s memory, and they were both classified as holy martial arts!

In the past thousand years, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t slacked off in his cultivation and his understanding of both arts was at a pretty decent level.

When Wang Junhai and his men arrived, Huang Xiaolong was currently practicing the Eight Desolate Holy Palm.

After seeing how Huang Xiaolong was moving about and practicing some sort of unknown martial art, a trace of shock flashed through Wang Junhai’s eyes. Never in his wildest imaginations would he have thought that Huang Xiaolong would be able to move. Didn’t the physician mention that it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to take less than a year to start moving around?

Despite his shock, he didn’t place Huang Xiaolong’s martial arts in his eyes. A sneer appeared on his face and he mocked, “Who would have thought that a useless cripple like you would be able to practice palm arts? It’s a pity your moves are soft and weak. With your current strength, you won’t be able to kill a rabbit if it was placed in front of you!”

Since Huang Xiaolong wasn’t circulating the energy in his body, the Eight Desolate Holy Palm looked like a common martial art practiced by commoners. Due to Wang Junhai’s low realm, he failed to discover the intricacies in Huang Xiaolong’s moves.

In fact, even if an Emperor Realm expert was present, he wouldn’t be able to discover the mystery and power behind the Eight Desolate Holy Palm.

That was only something Sovereigns could comprehend.

Upon hearing the tone of mockery in Wang Junhai’s voice, Huang Xiaolong continued his practice and ignored the man. The Eight Desolate Holy Palm had a total of ten forms and he planned to complete it.

The Eight Desolate Holy Palm wasn’t just a set of palm techniques. Constant practice could strengthen one’s body.

Wang Junhai was furious when he saw how Huang Xiaolong ignored him. “Brat, I came here on orders of my young master to chase you out of the Elegant Courtyard! The Elegant Courtyard is an important yard in our manor and only esteemed guests have the qualifications to live here!”

“As for trash like you, you are only worthy to live with the servants!”

“Get lost and head over to the Cool Breeze Courtyard now!”

Ignoring the clown jumping in front of him, Huang Xiaolong continued to practice the Eight Desolate Holy Palm.

Wang Junhai felt the rage bubbling in his heart as he yelled, “Keep acting!” He turned to a guard behind him and screamed, “Throw this brat out!”

The guard nodded respectfully and he started to walk towards Huang Xiaolong with a cold smile on his face.

In fact, all of the guards were unhappy that Huang Xiaolong lived in the Elegant Courtyard. Now that one of them was about to teach him a lesson, everyone watched the upcoming beatdown with great gusto.

The guard quickly arrived before Huang Xiaolong and reached out to grab his shoulder. Before he could throw Huang Xiaolong out of the yard, he realized that the youngster before him wouldn’t budge no matter how hard he pulled! It was as though he was tugging on the shoulders of an ancient beast!

This!

The guard was taken aback!

He was a high-level Ancestor God. His strength placed him in the middle tiers of the guards in the manor. Even if there was a pile of chaos stones in front of him, he would be able to lift them up with no problems! However, he couldn’t move the youngster before him no matter how hard he tried!

With a look of disbelief, he activated his godhead and godforce streamed out from his body. He grabbed at Huang Xiaolong once again but obtained the same result.

Wang Junhai felt that something strange was going on and a sense of unease filled his heart. Too bad he realized it too late. Huang Xiaolong turned around and shrugged. A single movement caused the guard to fly across the courtyard and slam into the sturdy wall.

Wang Junhai and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

What’s going on?!

Weren’t his meridians and spirit sea shattered?! What in the world is happening?!

Wang Junhai scanned the surroundings and found that there was nothing strange. Finally, his gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong and he growled, “I don’t believe that I won’t be able to take care of a useless fool like you!”

He started walking towards Huang Xiaolong as he planned to personally deal with the ‘ugly’ youngster in front of him!

“Coiling Dragon!”

Wang Junhai yelled and clawed at Huang Xiaolong. Two long chains of qi emerged and transformed into two cyclones that intertwined with each other as they charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

The move he unleashed was his ultimate move and the moment it coiled itself around its prey, even an ancient beast would be unable to shake it off!

In a flash, Huang Xiaolong was bound by Wang Junhai’s ultimate move.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was no longer able to escape, Wang Junhai and the rest of the guards heaved a sigh of relief.

Just as the few guards were about to flatter Wang Junhai for his skills, Huang Xiaolong shrugged once again and executed the Eight Desolate Holy Palm. In the blink of an eye, the energy cyclones were swept away as though they never existed.

Everyone in the courtyard stared at Huang Xiaolong as their jaws dropped to the ground.

It was perfect timing as Huang Xiaolong completed the last move of the Eight Desolate Holy Palm. Huang Xiaolong tilted his head and walked towards the housekeeper.
