Chapter 2453: Looking For Abuse

Despite Huang Xiaolong singing the Scarlet Flame Divine Sword’s praises, the Scarlet Flame Patriarch was in no mood to smile at all. Those ten Scarlet Flame Holy Gate disciples were the best amongst their Holy Gate’s disciples, and he had personally selected them to train, yet they had lost!

They had lost even when executing the Scarlet Flame Sword Formation!

These Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s ten disciples of outstanding talents were the future pillars of the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate, ah. Each of them had a chance of becoming a True Saint expert.

It was obvious what were the endings of these ten Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s disciples.

After watching Huang Xiaolong devour the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s disciples simultaneously, and listening to the blood-curdling screams reverberating in the air, the crowd was enveloped by a suffocating silence. Other disciples participating in the second round looked deathly pale.

These various forces’ disciples, who had yet to go up the stage, were almost crippled by fear, and their legs were shaking no matter how hard they tried to make themselves stand still.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze stopped on the Blue Whale Race’s ten disciples as his second match was against the Blue Whale Race.

......

Half a day later, the second round of the challenge ended.

The second round’s three hundred and ninety genius Holy Princes all but perished. All three hundred and ninety of them provided a great wave of supplement to Huang Xiaolong, and without any exaggeration, he almost had a nosebleed from being oversupplemented.

Each of the three hundred and ninety genius Holy Princes, had been selected carefully by the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground, Beast Tamer Holy Gate, Black Inferno Race, and other forces, possessing amazing battle prowess. Even though their talents were lower than Fang Xing, Sui Yunfeng, Gu Xuanxu, and other disciples in the first round, the second round’s number was ten times more!

The benefits from second round’s three hundred and ninety genius Holy Princes were absolutely better than what he had gotten from the first round, and it was twice over and more.

Although he had entered the top thirty ranks, going one place up for his complete dao saint godheads became more difficult. In comparison, the second round’s three hundred and ninety geniuses from the thirty-nine forces enabled Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godheads to rise a few more places up.

After his complete dao saint godheads had risen into the top thirty ranks, it would take a hundred thousand years to go up several places in the ranks like the Heavenly Master. More importantly, other than a minimum of a hundred thousand years, one needed a constant supply of a special origin spiritual pills to achieve that.

However, Huang Xiaolong had achieved the same result in a mere half a day!

Any other time, Huang Xiaolong naturally wouldn’t have been so reckless as to kill these Ancient Emperor Holy Ground, Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and other forces’ Holy Princes. But with the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong’s actions were right and reasonable, and people like Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and Zhan Zhiyuan had no ground to call a crusade on Huang Xiaolong in the name of justice, no matter how they were raging internally.

At the end of the day, they were the ones who had sent those disciples up to the stage.

Since they participated, then they needed to be willing to accept the results. Whatever they might be.

Even if their hearts were bleeding with pain, they had to endure and swallow their resentment.

After the second round ended, Huang Xiaolong’s gaze once again swept over Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, Zhan Zhiyuan, Xie Bufan, Li Chen, and the rest with a sunny smile. “Everyone, is anyone sending their disciples to participate in the third round of the challenge?”

Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and the others were silent.

Huang Xiaolong’s smile remained and he asked, “No one wants this grandmist holy spiritual aura anymore?” He pointed at the grandmist holy spiritual aura in midair.

Everyone remained silent. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They were seemingly practicing the motto of silence is golden.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze stopped on Li Chen, “Senior Brother Li Chen, aren’t you going to send experts under you to continue challenging? If no one continues the challenge, then it means I win, and you would have to lick the bottom of my shoes in public.”

The various holy grounds’ experts were bewildered as they looked at Li Chen.

Huang Xiaolong and Li Chen’s bet had not spread out so far, thus very few people knew about it.

The gazes directed at him felt like thorns in his flesh, making Li Chen uncomfortable all over, and his expression had never looked so ugly.

“Li Chen and Huang Xiaolong made a bet of this nature?” A strange expression crept up Ji Xinyi’s delicate face as she asked in puzzlement.

Tan Juan shook her head, unsure whether she was pitying Li Chen or feeling remorse on Li Chen’s behalf?

If Li Chen really were to lick the bottom of Huang Xiaolong’s shoes in public, then Li Chen’s prestige as the Holy Heavens’ chief disciple would be irretrievably washed down the drain, and he would be reduced to a great laughing stock of the entire Holy World.

As the Holy Heavens’ chief disciple, as well as the Heavenly Master’s personal disciple, Li Chen had always been proud of his identity and status. In retrospect, during his time, he had also offended many people, and when the time came, these people would definitely add salt to his wounds.

“How about we do it this way, Senior Brother Li Chen, if you send the experts under you to participate in the third round challenge, you can send fifty people!” Huang Xiaolong continued with his wicked temptation.

“What?! Fif-fifty people!” Everyone shook, hearing that.

Li Chen, Duan Xuan, Zhan Zhiyuan, and the others were just as flabbergasted by Huang Xiaolong’s proposal.

“Huang Xiaolong, did you just say that we can send fifty people to challenge you?!” Li Chen was unsure if he had heard Huang Xiaolong right.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and nodded, “Correct, fifty people can go up at the same time!”

This was basically the same tactic Huang Xiaolong had used to tempt the thirty-nine forces in the second round. Huang Xiaolong had foreseen this situation, and this was exactly what he had wanted. He planned to bait Li Chen, and the rest with a little bit of hope, and hang them on this little bit of hope.

“Huang Xiaolong, if Li Chen can do that, then we too can send fifty people at one time?” Shen Jiewen couldn’t stop himself from asking.

“Yes!” Huang Xiaolong nodded with a big smile, “Everyone can send fifty people, and other rules remain unchanged. Just like the second round, only the number of people will be revised to fifty people each time.”

Duan Xuan, Zhan Zhiyuan, and others exchanged a look, and all of them saw their own thoughts mirrored in the other’s eyes.

Especially for the Scarlet Flame Holy Gate’s Patriarch, his eyes lit up brightly. The Scarlet Flame Sword Formation consisting of ten people had failed to defeat Huang Xiaolong, but don’t tell him a Scarlet Flame Sword Formation consisting of fifty people would fail too?

He didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong was really invincible amongst those below Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint!

A Scarlet Flame Sword Formation made up of fifty people was five times more powerful than the sword formation consisted of ten people!

Huang Xiaolong, since you’re asking to die, don’t blame me for being ruthless! The Scarlet Flame Holy Gate Patriarch thought inwardly.

After losing eleven outstanding Holy Princes consecutively, he greatly resented Huang Xiaolong.

“Agreed!” Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and others gathered around the experts of their own forces and discussed the matter. All of them nodded, chuckling as they agreed to send disciples for the third round challenge.

After seeing Duan Xuan, Shen Jiewen, and the rest nodding, a smile bloomed over Huang Xiaolong’s face. After the third round ended, his three complete dao saint godheads could rise several places higher in the ranks, right?

Upon hearing that Huang Xiaolong was allowing the Ancient Emperor Holy Ground, Beast Tamer Holy Gate, and the others to send fifty people at once, Wu Ge, the Holy Heavens’ hall masters, and grand elders immediately became agitated and nervous.

“Lord Grand Hall Master, His Highness Huang Xiaolong is really too...!” The Holy Heavens’ Law Enforcement Hall Master Shi Feng complained to Wu Ge, “Why don’t you try to persuade His Highness?”

There was helplessness on Wu Ge’s face as he said, “The moment the words left His Highness’ mouth, it cannot be changed anymore.”

The three ladies, Lin Xiaoying, Tan Juan, and Ji Xinyi had a different reaction. Tan Juan was still a little optimistic about Huang Xiaolong in the second round when he had proposed to battle ten people, but this time, she shook her head, feeling speechless.

Accepting a challenge by fifty people at the same time? This Huang Xiaolong is truly hell-bent in seeking death, isn’t he?

This was not putting others in his eyes at all!

How could the power of ten be compared to the power of fifty?

“What is this Thirteen planning to do exactly? Even if he’s looking to be abused, this is not the way!” Lin Xiaoying scolded but her brows were creased with worry.
