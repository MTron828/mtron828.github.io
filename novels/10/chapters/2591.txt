Chapter 2592: An Ultimate Killing Move!

With the appearance of the three holy souls and the twelve high-grade Saint Fates, a shocking amount of holy energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body. The space around him started to tremble as a gale swept through the space they were currently in. Zi Dongping’s aura that seemed to cover the lands was suppressed by Huang Xiaolong’s might.

Only after a long time did Zi Dongping return to his senses. He stared at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated gaze. “I’ve seen many geniuses, but all of them are trash compared to you! In the entire Alien Lands, only Yuan Qianxing of the Otherworldly Mansion would be your match!”

Yuan Qianxing? Huang Xiaolong was stunned. He had twelve high-grade Saint Fates and three holy souls. According to Zi Dongping, the man called Yuan Qianxing in the Otherworldly Mansion was comparable to him!

Could it be?!

“That’s right, you might have three holy souls and twelve high-grade Saint Fates, but your cultivation realm is too low! With your strength, you won’t be able to defeat me!” Zi Dongping shook his head slowly. “You’re destined to die here today.”

“Of course, if you choose to take me as your master, I can spare your life. In the future, you can be a pillar of my Purple Spider Race. In fact, you shall be the next patriarch of the race!”

Initially, Huang Xiaolong was the disciple of the Heavenly Master and Zi Dongping wanted nothing more than to kill that brat. However, he changed his mind after seeing Huang Xiaolong’s talent. Not only did he want to accept Huang Xiaolong as his disciple, but he also wanted to allow this human to become the next patriarch of the Purple Spider Race!

His terms were enough to show the appreciation he had for Huang Xiaolong’s talent.

It might be unbelievable, but Huang Xiaolong’s talent was enough to change the mind of his master’s mortal enemy. In fact, anyone in the right mind would choose to win him over.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked when he noticed Zi Dongping’s change of heart. However, he shook his head in response. “I’ll accept Patriarch Dongping’s goodwill in my heart. However, I wish to finish the bet.”

If he subdued Zi Dongping, there was no need to become the other party’s disciple.

A frown formed on Zi Dongping’s face. “Are you sure? You’ll definitely die the moment I make my move!”

“Not necessarily…”

“Since that’s the case, I won’t hold back.” Terrifying killing intent emerged from Zi Dongping’s eyes, and he turned into a beast capable of destroying anything in his path. Since he wasn’t able to accept the other party as his disciple, there was only one thing left for Huang Xiaolong in his opinion, and it was to die! Huang Xiaolong had to die!

Right before Zi Dongping could make his move, a multi-colored light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s chest. As rainbow-colored light filled the space around them, and the radiance blinded Zi Dongping.

As if a nuclear bomb went off in his mind, Zi Dongping stared at Huang Xiaolong’s Inextinguishable Dao Heart. As a Primal Ancestor, he couldn’t be more familiar with it!

No one knew how long had passed before Zi Dongping broke the silence, “You!” He didn’t dare to believe his eyes.

“Several minutes have already passed.” Huang Xiaolong spoke casually. He had long since expected Zi Dongping’s reaction.

After sucking in a cold breath, a serious look appeared on Zi Dongping’s face. His expression was a little unsightly. In his years of existence as a Primal Ancestor, he had never expected that he would take a Second Heaven True Saint so seriously.

As purple light emerged from his back and pierced through the skies, the space around him exploded and the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds shook.

Every single expert in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds saw the pillar of purple light stretching up to the heavens.

Transforming himself, Zi Dongping became completely purple in color.

That was Zi Dongping’s strongest form, a Purple Spider King! The origin energy from the Purple Spider Race poured into him instantly.

As the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds trembled, debris floated up into the skies.

Everything on the ground gathered in the skies, and Zi Dongping roared at the heavens before sending his fist crashi+ng down on Huang Xiaolong. As though a trillion purple stars detonated at once, the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds shook violently under the terrifying shockwave.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to take on the attack casually as his three holy souls and the twelve Saint Fates emitted resplendent rays of light. His Dao Heart produced a vortex of grand dao laws as it prepared to meet Zi Dongping’s attack head-on.

Boom!

As their fists met, the impact was comparable to the clash between two super-holy grounds. Every single expert in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds felt their hearts trembling in fear as their bodies went numb. The impact threatened to destroy the entire holy grounds and everyone felt as though they could no longer control whether they lived or died.

The reason Huang Xiaolong had created the Cangqiong World around the Hong Zhen Holy Gate was also to ensure that the battle between them wouldn’t cause the entire holy grounds to crumble.

After all, the strength of Primal Ancestors wasn’t a joke.

When Qiao Jinyang had battled the Heavenly Master, the shockwaves of the battle had shattered continents several quadrillion miles away from the battlefield. Even though Zi Dongping was only a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor, who was nursing his injuries, his strength couldn’t be underestimated.

As they slammed into each other, Huang Xiaolong felt as though someone had thrown a chaos mountain at him, and he retreated several miles.

Even though he lost in the first exchange, Huang Xiaolong managed to gain a proper estimation of Zi Dongping’s strength. Realizing that Zi Dongping wasn’t that much stronger than him, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

“Again!” Zi Dongping roared as he sent another punch at Huang Xiaolong.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong changed forward once again and a deafening explosion filled the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds.

The faces of all the holy emperors Huang Xiaolong had subdued previously changed when they heard the blast. The exchange was getting more and more heated up, and just as they thought that the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds was about to be blasted to nothingness, everything stopped.

Silence returned to the lands and everyone realized that a peaceful and quiet life wasn’t that bad after all.

“They’re done?!” The Treasured Moon Holy Emperor asked cautiously. Flying out of their hiding spot carefully, they stared at the space outside the city. Looking around them, they saw mountain peaks crumbled into a pile of dust as bottomless valleys were formed everywhere. The water in the seas around them was no longer present and swathes of forests were leveled.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had protected the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds to the best of his ability with the Cangqiong World, the battle between the two of them had caused no small amounts of damage to the land.

As everyone enjoyed the silence that followed the world-ending battle, Huang Xiaolong stared at Zi Dongping silently in the forbidden region of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

There was only a minute left to the end of the one-hour time limit.

“If you manage to take on my ultimate killing move, I’ll admit defeat,” Zi Dongping growled as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. Upon reaching out with both arms, purple light swallowed him whole.

Very quickly, a sea of purple was formed where Zi Dongping was.

With a roar that shook the heavens, Zi Dongping slammed his arms at Huang Xiaolong.
