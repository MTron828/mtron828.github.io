Chapter 2683: He’s the Old Ancestor of the Dragon Fish Race!

Even Chen Junhong’s expression fell. Lei Yin was no ordinary Ninth Heaven True Saint. He was extremely cruel when he made his move, and there were rumors that a high-level True Saint was tortured for several tens of thousands of years at his hands.

An expert from the Rising Clouds Commerce noticed an old man with green eyes beside Lei Yin all of a sudden, and his voice trembled, “Lei Song!”

Terror gripped the hearts of those from the Rising Clouds Commerce when they heard his name.

Lei Song!

He is an expert at the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm!

There were more than ten peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saints from the Thunder Serpent Race, and Lei Song was one of them! He was a Eminent Elder of his race, and his prestige had long since surpassed people like Lei Yin and the others. His methods were even crueler, and no one had thought that he would appear!

Even Yun Fanger couldn’t keep her cool when she heard the name.

Very quickly, the members of the Thunder Serpent Race arrived before them.

“Hehe, isn’t this the second lady of the Rising Clouds Commerce?” Lei Yin sneered, “Let’s see if you can escape from us today.”

In the past, Yun Fanger and the experts of the Rising Clouds Commerce had entered the World River secretly in order to purchase some items. However, it seemed as though leaving was no longer going to be so easy now that they were discovered by the Thunder Serpent Race.

Forcing herself to remain calm, Yun Fanger said, “Aren’t you Young Patriarch Lei Yin of the Thunder Serpent Race? Why are you looking for me?”

Lei Yin roared with laughter when he heard the question. “Yun Fanger, are you pretending to be stupid? My third brother brought several members of the race over to look for you, but they were killed by a mysterious power.” A sinister smile formed on his face, and he glanced at the members of the Rising Clouds Commerce. “If you don’t tell me what happened that day and rat out my third brother’s murderer… Hehehe…”

“I don’t think a delicate young lady like you can endure my interesting methods of torture!”

Lei Yin’s voice rang through the air.

A chilly light flashed in his eyes as he looked at the members of the Rising Clouds Commerce. “I’ll roast you guys over the lightning fire of my Thunder Serpent Race, and I’ll refine all of you into pills!”

Chen Junhong and the others revealed a look of fear.

They knew that Lei Yin wasn’t kidding. If they were to be captured, there was no doubt that they would be turned into medicinal pills! In fact, they might even suffer a worse fate!

Who knew if Lei Yin could think of worse ways to toy with them.

“No… We didn’t do it!” Chen Junhong stuttered, “Young Master Lei Long wasn’t killed by the members of our Rising Clouds Commerce!”

“Of course not. You guys don’t have the guts to lay a finger on him! Speak! Who killed my third brother?!”

As Chen Junhong opened his mouth slightly, Yun Fanger snapped at him before he could speak his mind. “Chen Junhong, what do you think you’re doing! Do you remember what you said in the past?”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Yun Fanger, you wish to protect him…, but I have no wish to die together with him!”

If he had to make a choice between offending Huang Xiaolong and dying at the hands of Lei Yin, he would choose to offend Huang Xiaolong without the slightest hesitation! According to him, no matter how shocking Huang Xiaolong’s strength was, he couldn’t be Lei Yin’s opponent!

Moreover, he would live out a fate worse than death if the members of the Thunder Serpent Race captured them.

“He killed Young Master Lei Long!” Upon ignoring Yun Fanger’s pleas, he pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

“Young Master Long, you can’t blame me for this. Nobody wishes to die an early death. Since you killed Lei Long in the past, do you dare to take responsibility for your actions?”

He had hated Huang Xiaolong ever since the other party had injured him in the past.

If Huang Xiaolong could die at the hands of Lei Yin, his anger could finally be released!

The members of the Thunder Serpent Race turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a face full of shock. No one had expected the murderer to be a young man like him!

“You?!” Lei Yin turned to Huang Xiaolong with a trace of doubt in his mind. He could see that Huang Xiaolong was only at the peak of the late-Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm. He wondered how could someone at that level kill more than a thousand experts from his Thunder Serpent Race.

Moreover, there were three Seventh Heaven True Saints around his third brother.

He even thought that Chen Junhong was trying to save himself by pointing to any random person he saw!

Huang Xiaolong stared at Chen Junhong casually and admitted to it. “Yeah. I killed them.”

A malevolent light flashed in Lei Yin’s eyes the moment Huang Xiaolong spoke. “Little brat, you’re really something else. Where is his holy soul?”

“My Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact was damaged, and I used his holy soul to repair it.” It was true. The Cangqiong Dao Palace was indeed damaged when he had tried to pass through the Death Cave, and he had used their holy souls to repair it.

The holy soul of a True Saint was actually very effective when it came to repairing dao artifacts.

“Primal… Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact?!”

Lei Yin, Lei Song, and the others couldn’t believe their ears.

“You have a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact!” A sinister smile formed on Lei Yin’s face when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

“I’ll forget everything that happened with Lei Long. Oh right, if you leave now, I’ll forgive your Thunder Serpent Race.” Upon ignoring the gaze on Lei Yin’s face, Huang Xiaolong tutted his condition. “Otherwise, I’ll exterminate your Thunder Serpent Race.”

His expression made it seem as though exterminating the Thunder Serpent Race could be done with the flick of a finger.

Lei Yin and the others roared with laughter when they looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Even the members of the Rising Clouds Commerce shook their heads.

“Brat, if we were actually stupid, we might think that you are the patriarch of the Dragon Fish Race!” Lei Song finally growled. Those who knew him would know that he was ready to kill when he spoke in such an ominous tone.

Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled as he pointed to Long Jianfei. “I might not be the patriarch of the Dragon Fish Race, but I don’t think there’s any way to fake the old ancestor of the Dragon Fish Race.”
