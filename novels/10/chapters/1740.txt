Huang Xiaolong tested out his Grandmist Parasitic Medium again, and when he circulated it, the grandmist energy in his body moved tens of times faster than before!

The fourth stage! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Borrowing the might of the two strands of grandmist aura, Huang Xiaolong’s Grandmist Parasitic Medium had broken through to the fourth stage!

In the third stage of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, Huang Xiaolong could use the grandmist worms to attack his enemies. The grandmist worms could pierce through any armor. Now that Huang Xiaolong had reached the fourth stage of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he was able to control the worms to remain in his victims’ bodies. He could even suck out his foes’ godforce to replenish his own!

The ability to do so made the fourth stage of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium extremely horrifying.

“I wonder how many grandmist worms I can plant in their bodies... I also need to find out how many people I can affect with this ability...” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

The stronger his divine sense was, the more grandmist worms Huang Xiaolong could create. As the number of worms would increase, so would his ability to absorb more godforce in the same amount of time. His cultivation speed would experience a tremendous boost.

Ever since awakening the three archdevil bloodlines in his body, Huang Xiaolong could foresee that his cultivation speed would increase tenfold. No, it was even possible for his cultivation speed to increase by tens of folds!

After he stabilized his breathing, Huang Xiaolong finally got to his feet.

This cultivation session of his had lasted for eight years, and there was only a single year left till the start of the Battle of the Heavenly Court. It was time for him to return to the Divine World.

Huang Xiaolong quickly flew out of the forbidden lands, and he was greeted by the members of the Netherworld King’s Organization.

“Your Majesty,” Tai Yue and the other Great Commanders who were standing guard at the forbidden grounds’ entrance greeted in unison the moment Huang Xiaolong appeared.

“Congratulations on your advancement to the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm!”

As they celebrated Huang Xiaolong’s advancement, an expression of joy hung on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong smiled with indifference and said, “I broke through because of luck. There is no need to congratulate me for breaking into the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm...”

Tai Yue and the others were stunned silly. Broke through because of luck?! Supposing that Huang Xiaolong had managed to break through to the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm because of luck, how could ‘heaven-defying’ geniuses like Tai Yue and the rest hold their heads high?! After all, they had to cultivate for millions of years to arrive at their current cultivation level!

Huang Xiaolong and the Great Commanders slowly made their way to the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe’s headquarters.

“The commencement of the Battle of the Heavenly Court is drawing near. I’m planning to return to the Divine World soon.” Huang Xiaolong paused for a moment before continuing, “I need to trouble all of you to take care of the Netherworld King’s Organization matters.”

“When will Your Majesty return?” Tai Yue asked respectfully.

All of them knew about Huang Xiaolong’s other identity. As such, none of them were surprised when they learned that he had to return to the Divine World to take part in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head after thinking for a moment, “I have no idea. I might return after the Battle of the Heavenly Court, but I might need to make a trip to the Devil World before that.”

There were six Devil Steles in the Devil World, and Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain the Blood Eye Devil Stele in the past. He wanted to head over to the Devil world to look for the other five.

The other five steles could be located in the Devil World. He felt that he could obtain the Archdevil Lord’s Heavenless Demonic Art by gathering all six steles. After all, the Heavenless Demonic Art was the strongest demonic art in the Archdevil Lord’s arsenal. As long as he managed to obtain it, he would be an unstoppable existence with both the Grandmist Parasitic Medium and the Heavenless Demonic Art.

He also felt that he would break through to the Emperor Realm once he gathered all six Devil Steles.

Although his Grandmist Parasitic Medium had already broken through to the fourth stage and he had awakened all three archdevil bloodlines in his body, Huang Xiaolong knew that he would need several hundred years to enter the Emperor Realm. No matter how quickly he cultivated, Emperor Realm was out of his reach for the next three hundred years, at the very least. No matter how heaven-defying it was to everyone else for someone to enter the Emperor Realm in three hundred years, Huang Xiaolong felt that the speed was not up to his liking.

Of course, everything would be different if he managed to gather all five other Devil Steles.

Huang Xiaolong felt as though he would only be confident to face the Massacring Gods Gate and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe after breaking into the Emperor Realm.

“Your Majesty plans to head over to the Devil World?!” Tai Yue and the others felt their jaws dropping in shock.

Asura King Jin Yuan piped up all of a sudden, “Your Majesty, the Devil World is too dangerous!”

Even Fan Hui and the rest couldn’t help but clamor, “That’s right! Ever since the Archdevil Lord vanished in the Devil World several billion years ago, they have been on the brink of collapse! The Devil World is even more chaotic than Hell!”

Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled, “Even Chu Han can’t kill me... The number of people in the Devil World who can take my life could be counted on one hand. I will be cautious when messing about there. All of you can rest assured. Oh right, is there news about the Saint Buddha Water and the Buddhist Soil I requested for?”

On the Black Ant Plane, Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain the one and only Seed of Enlightenment in existence. He had to grow it in the Buddhist Soil before watering it with the Saint Buddha Water to germinate.

“There is no news at the moment.” Wan Yutian shook his head and continued, “The Saint Buddha Water is the top-ranked Saint Water in the Buddhist World. I’m afraid that it will only be available in the heart of Divine Mountain Xumi in the Buddhist World. As for the Buddhist Soil, no one has seen it in the past ten billion years. I’m afraid only the old Buddhist Ancestor will have something like that. However, the old Buddhist Ancestor is our old master’s archenemy.”

Wan Yutian paused after speaking so much.

His meaning was clear. It was harder to obtain the Buddhist Soil from the old Buddhist Ancestor’s hands than climbing to the sky.

A frown slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

If that was the case, he needed to make a trip to the Buddhist World after obtaining all five Devil Steles. After all, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be content if he gave up on growing the seed.

Moreover, he had a feeling that he would be able to surpass the Emperor Realm if he cultivated beneath the Divine Bodhi Tree in the future.

Huang Xiaolong knew that he had progressed too quickly on his road of cultivation. His divine soul and mental state seemed to be lagging. He felt that the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm would be a huge bottleneck for him in the future. The only way he would be able to remedy his problems was to use the Divine Bodhi Tree to assist the growth of his Divine Soul and mental state.

As such, Huang Xiaolong was adamant about obtaining the Saint Buddha Water and Buddhist Soil.

When they finally arrived at the Green Flame Devil Scorpion Tribe’s headquarters, Huang Xiaolong passed down his instructions to Tai Yue and the rest. After staying there for a few days, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Asura Tactics and left Hell.

Huang Xiaolong always felt that the Asura Tactics wasn’t simple as it wouldn’t be easy for him to leave Hell with the technique otherwise. He felt that there was no way Ren Wokuang was the one who had come up with it.

There was too a high chance that Ren Wokuang had managed to obtain the Asura Tactics by chance.

In the future, Huang Xiaolong decided to question his master, Ren Wokuang, about the Asura Tactics’ origins after he returned to hell.

When he finally left Hell, he was greeted with an incredible sight. Stars were twinkling in the space before him, and Huang Xiaolong sucked in a deep breath. I’m finally back in the Divine World! Even the air in the Divine World seemed fresher to him.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the familiar black hole before him, and a trace of laughter appeared on his face. He didn’t intend to return directly to the Fortune Emperor Palace. Instead, he stopped at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Huang Xiaolong decided to subdue the four odd beasts trapped under the formation located in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

With his strength at the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm and the assistance of the fourth stage of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he felt that success was definitely within his reach.

Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred and he broke through the barrier around the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. He charged straight toward the valley where the formation was located.

The devil qi in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield was terrifying, as death qi and nefarious qi was mixed into it. However, none of those posed a threat to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong quickly arrived in the mountain valley and noticed the barriers he had set up in the past.

Raising his palm, he pressed downwards. As a brilliant light filled the sky, the valley became exposed to the world.
