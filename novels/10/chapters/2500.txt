Chapter 2501: Really Entering the Top 10?!

With fear gripping their hearts, they no longer thought about the Trial of Blood. All they could think of was activating the light ring on their wrists to transport them out! However, they finally realized that the energy in their bodies was frozen by some sort of special power. It was impossible for them to activate the restriction to send them back.

Huang Xiaolong had long since anticipated their actions, and he had suppressed their energy with frigid yin qi when he had attacked them previously.

It was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to allow them to escape.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Zhang Yihui wanted to speak, but they were dragged before Huang Xiaolong before he could say anything else.

When they finally arrived in front of him, Zhang Yihui felt a sense of fear he had never felt before.

“Huang Xiaolong, if you kill us, the Holy Lands Alliance will hunt you down no matter how hard you try to hide!”

Indeed. With Zhang Yihui’s identity as the leader of the holy princes in the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate, his death would only cause his faction to hunt down the murderer.

After all, he wasn’t a random disciple who had signed up for the Trial of Blood.

Huang Xiaolong stared at him expressionlessly. “Did you forget about how I killed Yu Fujiang?”

Everyone knew that Huang Xiaolong had killed Yu Fujiang, but the Beast Tamer Holy Gate could only remain silent about the matter.

Zhang Yihui’s face turned ashen when he thought about his impending doom.

“Even if I kill you, there won’t be anyone to prove that I’m the murderer!” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

However, Cang Ping sneered coldly when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “You seem to have forgotten that you can’t kill a True Saint Realm expert. My holy soul has already transcended reincarnation!”

A complicated smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Isn’t it just a holy soul?”

Cang Ping was stunned for a second, but he almost burst out laughing the next moment. “Do you really think that you can exterminate my holy soul?”

Instead of replying to him, mysterious rays of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Cang Ping’s body started to tremble as a terrifying thought flashed through his mind.

The rays of light from Huang Xiaolong’s dao heart entered Cang Ping’s body while he was still confused.

Before he devoured Cang Ping’s holy soul, he didn’t forget to search through his memories.

Since they had arrived at the Furtive Lands, they were definitely aware of the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury. They could know the exact location of it, saving Huang Xiaolong from searching aimlessly.

As Zhang Yihui watched on in fright, Cang Ping’s holy soul started to fade from existence.

“Huang Xiaolong, even if I turn into a ghost, I won’t let you off!” Cang Ping screamed, “Senior Brother Bai Buren will definitely seek revenge!”

Cang Ping screamed and struggled, but he couldn’t escape.

Zhang Yihui’s sanity started to collapse when he realized that even a True Saint couldn’t escape from Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

By the time Huang Xiaolong was done with Cang Ping, Zhang Yihui’s lower body was covered in liquid. In fact, he was so afraid that a pool of urine had formed under his feet.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and devoured Zhang Yihui. No longer waiting around, he soared through the air and left.

From their memories, Huang Xiaolong had learned a little bit about the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury. Even though they weren’t aware of the exact location, they knew a lot more than the disciples of the Ghost Talisman Holy Gate. After summarising their memories, Huang Xiaolong learned that the treasury probably had appeared in the Burial Ground in the Furtive Lands.

The Burial Ground was a special region in the Furtive Lands. It was somewhat even more dangerous and with Huang Xiaolong’s speed, he would take two entire days to arrive.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong no longer held back as he used all three holy souls to kill all the ghost devils he came across.

After all, he would have to look for the treasury after arriving at the Burial Ground. He would definitely fight with the disciples of the other factions, and his speed of killing the ghost devils would drop significantly. He had to kill them now if he wanted to climb up the leaderboards!

With the appearance of the three holy souls, one could only imagine how quickly Huang Xiaolong killed ghost devils. With a ‘swoosh,’ Huang Xiaolong’s name on the leaderboards shot up the ranks.

Initially, he could have entered the top hundred by the end of the day if he had used a single holy soul. But right now, he entered the top fifty ranks in half a day!

In fact, he reached the 48th rank!

Everyone felt their world spinning when they noticed Huang Xiaolong’s rank, and one of the grand elders of a super holy gate gasped in horror, “Mother… Is he crazy?!”

Jin Taiji shook his head when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s rocketing rank. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Disappointment filled his heart.

Even though he knew that Huang Xiaolong was a creator of miracles, he had already passed the trials and there was no need to cheat so blatantly. After all, he had to be stupid if he made it so obvious!

After he entered the top fifty, he didn’t stop. Huang Xiaolong’s rank slowly approached the 40th mark.

“He’s going to surpass Lin Yijia!” Someone yelled.

Lin Yijia of the Holy Heavens was a First Heaven True Saint. He sat on the 39th rank, until Huang Xiaolong appeared.

Before long, another scream came from the crowd. “Xie Yao! He surpassed Xie Yao!”

Xie Yao was a mid-First Heaven True Saint from the Holy Heavens, who ranked 35th. However, Huang Xiaolong surpassed him in an instant.

With his ant-like strength at the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong surpassed one mountain after another.

Finally, he entered the top 30 ranks.

Everyone who could rank in the top 30s were late-First Heaven True Saints.

Their prestige and status in the Holy World couldn’t be challenged, and all of them had extraordinary talent. Taking Chen Yizhong, who was ranked 28th, as an example, he was the most talented disciple the Ancient Dhyana Race had seen in the past billion years. His position as the next patriarch of the race was basically secured.

However, Huang Xiaolong shot past him like a rocket.

At the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong squeezed his way into the top 20s.

Every single disciple in the top 20 had a cultivation base no weaker than a peak late-First Heaven True Saint.

However, none of that seemed to matter as Huang Xiaolong charged up the ranks.

Under the mockery of those outside, Huang Xiaolong finally settled on the 11th place on the jade stele.

“Is Huang Xiaolong really planning to enter the top 10?” Duan Xuan sneered, “If a Fourth Tribulation Half Saint manages to enter the top 10 positions, he will be the only one in the Holy World to obtain such an achievement.”

The person standing in Huang Xiaolong’s way at the 10th spot was precisely Dou Rui.
