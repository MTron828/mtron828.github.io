Chapter 2652: Beg Him Not To Torture You to Death

A smug smile spread over Huang Xiaolong’s face. When Fei Yanzi noticed this, she immediately refuted, “I don’t think you can.” Throwing that sentence, she turned around and entered the inner hall, turning her back to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong stood dumbly on the spot.

Honestly speaking, Fei Yanzi’s expression was full of charm and style that would make a man’s heart itch.

Although Fei Yanzi was clad in a loose brocade robe, it did nothing to hide her rotund derrière that swayed seductively as she walked, and each movement only emphasized her hidden curves.

Seemingly feeling Huang Xiaolong’s stare on her behind, her footsteps obviously quickened. Back in her room, Fei Yanzi leaned onto the door for support, feeling her heart thumping fast in her chest.

Her heart seemed to be hitting the walls of her chest. Is this what they call a deer bumping around in one’s heart?

Early the next day, the disciples of the Purple Spider Race and the human race came to call on Huang Xiaolong. Apart from them, no one else came. Indirectly, this showed that no other races in the Alien Lands thought that Huang Xiaolong had a chance of surviving the battle stage. It was not surprising to see that those who used to flatter Huang Xiaolong didn’t come around.

However, the disciples from the human race and Purple Spider Race told Huang Xiaolong that the human race’s Chen Luo Sect’s young patriarch, Chen Muguang, had chosen to side with Yuan Qianxing’s camp, becoming one of Yuan Qianxing’s most loyal dogs.

“Young Patriarch, you don’t know, but in recent years, ever since Chen Muguang became Yuan Qianxing’s dog, he has become so arrogant. He beats the disciples of our race every time he encounters any one of us,” a Purple Spider Race’s disciple complained to Huang Xiaolong. “After beating us up, he runs to Yuan Qianxing seeking merit.”

The human race’s disciples also complained about Chen Muguang to Huang Xiaolong, saying that Chen Muguang was basically being inhuman towards them ever since he had climbed up to be Yuan Qianxing’s dog, abusing them left and right.

After sending away these Purple Spider Race’s and the human race’s disciples, a cold glimmer flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, “Chen Muguang.

Since you want to die so badly, I shall fulfill your wish.

The next few days were calm and peaceful. But everyone knew it was merely an illusion on the surface, as the undercurrents were surging violently.

Several days later…

The first rays of sunlight peeked over the horizon, throwing a glistening cloak over the Chaos Essence Holy Peak’s roiling fog.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from his Chaos Essence Cultivation Cave, inhaling the morning’s fresh air that carried the faint scent of flowers and grass.

The day of the stage battle is finally here!

Huang Xiaolong stood with his hands clasped behind him, looking in the direction of the battle stage. Though the two places were far apart, he almost imagined he could hear the rowdy liveliness around the battle stage at this time. Were those Myriad Origin Race’s disciples’ cheers?

Fei Yanzi came out after Huang Xiaolong. Ever since that abnormality with her heartbeat a few days back, she had kept to her room to ‘meditate,’ avoiding Huang Xiaolong.

After several days of not seeing each other, Huang Xiaolong discovered that there was something different about Fei Yanzi.

“What are you looking at?” Fei Yanzi sounded grumpy.

Huang Xiaolong merely smiled silently at her.

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong had only smiled at her without a word, Fei Yanzi was about to speak when she spotted Feitian Longpeng and a group of Flying Heaven Race’s experts flying over from a distance. Thus, she could only swallow back whatever she wanted to say.

Feitian Longpeng and the rest saluted upon descending, and then Feitian Longpeng said to Huang Xiaolong, “Your Highness, Patriarch, should we head over there now?”

“En, let’s go,” before Huang Xiaolong answered, Fei Yanzi agreed. With that said, she leaped into the sky and sped away. Feitian Longpeng and other Flying Heaven Race’s experts were left bewildered. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Feitian Longpeng looked at Huang Xiaolong suspiciously.

“Let’s go,” Huang Xiaolong grinned, then quickly followed after Fei Yanzi. Feitian Longpeng and the rest followed, still baffled by the weird atmosphere.

Huang Xiaolong soon caught up to Fei Yanzi, but it seemed like she was deliberately keeping her distance from Huang Xiaolong. At any given time, she would be a few steps ahead of Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong smiled bitterly inside. I don’t recall offending Fei Yanzi, did I?

A while later, Huang Xiaolong and the others were close to arriving at the battle stage.

The battle stage was built between the Five Spirits Peaks. It was said that the Otherworldly Mansion Master Mo Zhi had found the Five Spirits Peak in a chaos grandmist land. Then, exerting his utmost strength, Mo Zhi had moved the Five Spirits Peak to the Otherworldly Mansion. The Five Spirits Peak possessed an innate five elements grand formation, which was then refined by Mo Zhi. He had added many layers of grand formation, creating a small independent world with the Five Spirits Peak as the core.

Of course, there was a reason the Mansion Master Mo Zhi had set the Five Spirits Peak as the battle venue. With the Five Spirits Peak’s grand formations, and him presiding over the overall situation, he wasn’t afraid of the Myriad Origin Race or other alien races’ royal families interfering with the competition.

This is the Five Spirits Peak.

Huang Xiaolong saw the five majestic summit of Five Spirits Peak from afar. The Five Spirits Peak resembled the five fingers extending skywards, with thick fog surrounding its summit, reflecting a prism of soft glow.

Arriving at the Five Spirits Peak, Huang Xiaolong and the others flew onwards to the middle area of the Five Spirits Peak. There was a small-sized continent of land in the middle area, and the battle stage was set up here.

They saw more alien races’ disciples upon entering the Five Spirits Peak.

Upon seeing that Huang Xiaolong’s group had arrived, many alien races’ disciples, who used to flatter and fawn on Huang Xiaolong, scurried off as if they couldn’t wait to draw a line between them and Huang Xiaolong fast enough...

As they looked at Huang Xiaolong and Fei Yanzi from a far and safe distance, there was envy and jealousy in their eyes as their gazes swept past Fei Yanzi.

At the same time, Yuan Qianxing, Yao Ji, and Yuan Wangfeng stood tall amidst a group of experts on the battle stage area.

“Your Highness, Huang Xiaolong is here,” Yuan Wangfeng informed Yuan Qianxing.

Yuan Qianxing’s gaze shifted onto Huang Xiaolong, and a sharp light shot out. Fissures appeared in space as if they were slashed by sharp swords, but when the sharp light arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong, it crumbled as if it was repelled by a stronger force.

Under numerous experts’ attention, Huang Xiaolong, Fei Yanzi, and the rest of the group entered the battle stage area.

Yuan Qianxing let out a low, wicked chuckle as he approached Huang Xiaolong and Fei Yanzi. Yao Ji, Yuan Wangfeng, and the others followed closely behind. Stopping in front of Huang Xiaolong, he made a big action of scrutinizing Huang Xiaolong from head to toe and said in a mocking tone, “Oh, so you’ve broken through to the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm. No wonder you returned to fight for the Mansion’s young master position.” He let out a mocking sneer, “Huang Xiaolong, how many of my moves do you think you can take?”

The Myriad Origin Race’s experts jeered.

Although Yuan Qianxing appeared calm on the surface, inwardly, he was genuinely astonished. He hadn’t expected that in a short decade, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation would have risen to Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm!

Now, he was even more determined to kill Huang Xiaolong.

Despite his astonishment at Huang Xiaolong’s increased strength, Yuan Qianxing was still confident that he could easily kill Huang Xiaolong.

Yuan Qianxing’s gaze subsequently moved to Fei Yanzi, and the smile on his face was a little icy and villainous, “Fei Yanzi, I will let you see how I am going to torture your man to death on the stage!”

Your man? Since when did I have a man?

Fei Yanzi’s mind went blank for a moment. She soon reacted as she realized Yuan Qianxing was referring to Huang Xiaolong and redness tinged her cheeks. At the same time, she was inwardly annoyed, and her eyes narrowed as she glared at Yuan Qianxing, “Don’t worry. You will soon be begging him not to torture you to death!”

Everyone was dumbfounded.

Begging him not to torture you to death? This sentence was truly domineering!

Even Huang Xiaolong was surprised that the usually soft-spoken Fei Yanzi had blurted out such a sentence that was contrary to her personality.

Yuan Qianxing’s face turned gloomy at the drop of a hat. He chuckled sinisterly and retorted, “Is that so? Then you better open your eyes wide when watching the battle later.”
