Huang Xiaolong was baffled as the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples grew increasingly excited after correctly guessing his identity. ‘Had his reputation spread so far and wide, since the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony?’

Huang Xiaolong knew a little about the Sand Waves Sect. It was a super force from one of the neighboring world surfaces called Reverence World. It’s overall power was at par with Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate. ‘In other words, had his reputation reached the neighboring world surfaces?’

At least, the majority of neighboring world surfaces’ forces had heard what had happened at the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

Liang Mingzhi’s crooked face was filled with astonishment, the sullen fury on his face was obvious as he questioned Huang Xiaolong, “Are you really the Vientiane World surface’s Huang Xiaolong? Huang Xiaolong, this is a matter of the Sand Waves Sect, you’d do better not to butt your nose in. As long as you don’t interfere, you and your subordinates can leave now.”

As soon as Liang Mingzhi identified Huang Xiaolong, he suppressed his anger, and tried to make concessions.

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow at Liang Mingzhi’s courage.

“Huang Xiaolong, I beg you, help me, help me!” The woman named Wang Luo pleaded to Huang Xiaolong pitifully. Her helpless and lonely gaze stabbed at Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Liang Mingzhi as he pointed at Wang Luo, “I’ll take her.”

One could imagine Wang Luo’s fate if Huang Xiaolong chose not to help her. Wang Luo possessed a unique physique, and was still a virgin, hence, Liang Mingzhi would definitely extract her yin essence to boost his cultivation.

The yin essence of a virgin woman with a unique physique was beneficial to a cultivator’s cultivation.

Huang Xiaolong’s conscience didn’t allow him to watch a woman like Wang Luo suffer such an ending.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, Liang Mingzhi’s face turned red with fury, and he bellowed at the top of his lungs, “Huang Xiaolong, we’re just giving you face, do you think our Sand Waves Sect is afraid of Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate? I’ll tell you, my father is also here in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, and he’s nearby, so, you can f*ck off now, or else—!”

The Sand Waves Sect Chief was a master between mid to late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm cultivation!

The tiny light of hope in Wang Luo’s eyes dimmed. In her opinion, Huang Xiaolong would definitely give up on her. No one would put their own lives at risk for a stranger.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed and locked onto Liang Mingzhi as he said, “She stays, and you scram now, or die here!” Huang Xiaolong loathed people who dared to threaten him.

Liang Mingzhi and the rest of Sand Waves Sect’s disciples were stupefied.

Wasn’t Huang Xiaolong afraid of death, since he was still persisting on saving Wang Luo? Didn’t he hear that their Sect Chief was in the vicinity?

Liang Mingzhi threw his head back and let out a roar. He then looked ferociously at Huang Xiaolong and said once again, “Huang Xiaolong, do you think that I’m bluffing? You don’t believe that my father is nearby?”

Liang Mingzhi was under the impression that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to interfere in his affairs, as Huang Xiaolong had misunderstood him to be bluffing, when he had mentioned that his father was nearby.

“You have ten seconds to think about it.” Huang Xiaolong stated coldly.

“Ten!”

“Nine!”

Huang Xiaolong counted in an icy voice.

Everyone’s faces went blank. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Huang Xiaolong, In return I will count back the ten seconds for you. Scram, otherwise, you won’t be able to leave even if you wanted to.” Liang Mingzhi sneered, and then shouted, “Ten! Nine...!”

He bet that Huang Xiaolong didn’t have the guts to kill him.

‘How could he? He was the honorable Sand Waves Sect’s Young Lord. How could he be frightened off by one sentence from Huang Xiaolong?’ Hate and fury boiled in Liang Mingzhi’s heart. Once father arrives, I’m going to take pleasure in torturing Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was Golden Brow and Blood Knife’s personal disciple, however, as long as they erased all clues, Golden Brow and Blood Knife wouldn’t be able to find out that they were the culprit.

“Four, three, two...!” Huang Xiaolong’s icy voice rang in the air.

Laing Mingzhi didn’t mind Huang Xiaolong at all, he continued to countdown, “Six, five, four...”

“One!”

Just as Huang Xiaolong’s voice fell, the Sky Dragon Blood Knife appeared in his hand, and slashed out in a split second.

The sky dragon on the blood knife’s body flew out.

Blood qi flooded out as more than a dozen extremely fast knife qi burst out of the blood knife.

The dark space was lit up by the rays of knife qi, and all else was eclipsed.

Liang Migzhi’s voice came to a halt; his body stiffened, and disbelief was written all over his face as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. He bent his head, to look at the dotted bloodline that went from his head to his crotch. “You...” a grunt sounded. Then, the two halves of Liang Mingzhi’s body tumbled to the opposite sides.

The rest of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples and Wang Luo were dazed with shock. They looked at Liang Mingzhi’s split corpse with disbelief. Huang Xiaolong had really killed Liang Mingzhi.

Yet Huang Xiaolong was deathly calm. Consider him impulsive, or peeved, he had always acted according to his heart, true to his nature.

“Zhi’er!” Suddenly, a heart-wrenching roar resembling a rumbling thunder came from the horizon. An overpowering pressure surged towards Huang Xiaolong like a boundless sea. The lightning clouds above the Lightning Pool Mainland roiled violently.

Wang Luo went deathly pale at the sudden change.

Inwardly, she cried: The Sand Waves Sect’s Chief!

Liang Mingzhi had not lied. The Sand Waves Sect’s Chief was indeed in the vicinity.

Space was torn like a fabric as a black hole appeared, followed by a scarlet-eyed middle-aged man—he was the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief! Subsequently, the Sand Waves Sect’s Grand Elders, and Elders also appeared behind him.

The Sand Waves Sect’s Chief, Grand Elders, and Elders had come to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to hunt for the devils that had run into the Divine World, possessing the Infernal Devil’s bloodline.

As soon as the Sand Waves Sect’s Chief Liang Luwen appeared, he rushed to Liang Mingzhi’s corpse. A moment later, he roared towards the sky, hoarse with grief, hatred, wrath, and remorse.

Affected by Liang Luwen, the surrounding lightning element energy became turbulent, and was filled with hostility.

Some of the Sand Waves Sect’s disciples, and Wang Lou were knocked away by the sudden pressure from Sand Waves Sect Chief Liang Luwen.

Feng Er, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and Gui Er swiftly formed a protective circle around Huang Xiaolong, whereas the little cow retreated to the distance.

Liang Luwen’s roar reverberated in the air, as if it would never end.

Liang Luwen finally stopped. His cold gaze swept over Feng Er, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Gui Yi, and Gui Er, and his scarlet eyes looked straight at Huang Xiaolong.

“I-WANT-YOU-DEAD!” He gritted through every word, and a layer of ice spread outwards from below his feet, covering the ground.

He didn’t know who Huang Xiaolong was, nor did he care about knowing who he was. This was not at all important for him.

Without another word, he slammed his palm at Huang Xiaolong. Palm force howled, and space warped, shaking the heavens, and cracking the ground.

He wanted this black-haired young man to die, and turn him into pieces of meat! And Completely pulverize him!

Watching Liang Luwen’s palm strike was that close to hitting Huang Xiaolong, Feng Er raised her slender hand and tapped it in the air. A force spread from her finger, turning it into an endless ghost army that rushed forward and blocked Liang Luwen’s attack. Liang Luwen himself staggered back for several hundred meters.

The Sand Waves Sect’s experts, as well as Wang Luo were dumbfounded as their gazes fell on Feng Er.

All this time, Feng Er had concealed her strength, therefore, no one from the Sand Waves Sect had paid her much attention. In truth, it hadn’t even crossed their minds that a seemingly weak beauty like Feng Er could be a great Ancestor God Realm master!

While Huang Xiaolong and the Sand Waves Sect were at hostile ends, there was a group of people flying towards the Lightning Pool Mainland, and getting closer at a high speed. Each of them were exuding a powerful aura that was stronger than Liang Luwen, and even Feng Er.

This group consisted of none other than Feng Yingying and sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs.

“Lord Sea God, the Lightning Pool Mainland is just ahead, we can reach there in about thirty minutes.” Guo Family’s Patriarch Guo Shi informed.

Feng Yingying nodded. From the news they had obtained, a few high-level Ancestor God Realm devils had run to the Lightning Pool Mainland, moreover, these devils possessed the Infernal Devil’s bloodline.
