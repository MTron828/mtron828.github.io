Chapter 3614 – Jian Wushuang’s Granddaughter

The experts of the Ice Mountain stared at the members of the Glorious Celestial Empire. Zhou Chi locked his aura onto Celestial Empire Rong Ying.

Finding it hard to breathe, Rong Ying knew that there was no way he could talk himself out of this.

“I… I am willing to submit.” Eventually, Rong Ying sighed and fell to his knees like everyone else.

Originally, he was there to look for Zhou Chi on behalf of his father. Well, they met the man, but the situation was nothing like what he expected.

When the experts of the Glorious Celestial Empire saw their celestial emperor on his knees, none of them dared to hesitate. They quickly chose to submit.

Getting Zhou Chi, Wei Chong, Zhao Mang, Lu Shenglin, Rong Ying, and the other Gods of Creation to release their defenses on their dao soul, Huang Xiaolong branded them all.

Like before, Huang Xiaolong didn’t remove the Limitless Master’s restrictions on their dao souls. He merely covered it up with his own.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother personally controlling those who weren’t in the God of Creation Realm. He sent Zhou Chi and the others to do the dirty work for him.

After surrendering, Zhou Chi obediently handed over the treasury of the Ice Mountain over to Huang Xiaolong. Rong Ying and the others naturally had to take out everything they had.

As one of the ten strongest experts in the Limitless Land, Zhou Chi received many gifts when he went out to deal with other people’s problems. The number of universe-level spiritual veins he had exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s expectations.

There were sixty-one spiritual veins in total!

Even though there were many low-grade spiritual veins, there were more than thirty high-grade spiritual veins. Out of the sixty-one spiritual veins, there were five top-grade universe-level spiritual veins!

Next came Rong Ying. Even though he didn’t bring too many universe-level spiritual veins with him on his trip, he had a single strand of high-level universe-level spiritual vein. It was his gift to Zhou Chi in order to request for his assistance.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t ask Rong Ying about the problem. Instead, he directly ordered Zhou Chi to deal with it.

There was no way he would deal with Rong Ying’s problem personally when Zhou Chi was enough. He entered seclusion immediately in Zhou Chi’s grand palace.

Sitting on the eye of the first layer of formation in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong threw every single universe-level spiritual vein into the formation. He started to cultivate once the universe source qi started to emerge.

By the time he was done, several hundred thousand years had passed.

His cultivation was much more effective than his previous session in the Yin Yang City. He managed to clear out a lot of the hidden impurities in his body and the grand cosmos energy in all three worlds transformed quite a bit.

When he emerged from Zhou Chi’s palace, he felt much lighter than before. He broke through to the 18.9 billion units mark and he was close to reaching the next level of strength.

Summoning Zhou Chi the moment he emerged, he asked about the matter regarding the Glorious Celestial Empire.

“It’s nothing much. I dealt with it.” Zhou Chi replied respectfully.

It might be easy for Zhou Chi to deal with the matter, but it might be something that the Glorious Celestial Empire couldn’t do no matter how hard they tried!

Rong Hua, the old ancestor of the Glorious Celestial Empire, was a half step Universe God. He was as strong as Ying Ze and a problem he couldn’t solve had to be a huge one.

“Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian of the Yin Yang Celestial Empire have arrived. They wish to meet you…” Zhou Chi reported. “They arrived soon after you entered seclusion, and they remained here ever since.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned. Could something have happened? Why else would they wait for him to emerge from seclusion?

“Send them in.”

It didn’t take long for them to arrive. However, there was someone else with them, Tao Hang.

“What’s going on?”

Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian started to hesitate.

Tao Hang was the first to speak. “Lord, it’s related to Tao Han’er.”

“Did something happen to her?!” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Yes… Not long after you left for the Ice Mountain, Han’er went out to cultivate on her own. She disappeared soon after.

The frown on Huang Xiaolong’s face deepened. He turned to Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian. “How did she disappear?”

“When we learned of her disappearance, we sent everyone we could mobilize to look for her. As it turned out, she was brought away by a group of people!” Lin Qiankun replied. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Who was it?!” Huang Xiaolong’s expression sank.

“They were experts from the Jian Family in the Zhu Lan Lands…” Lin Qiankun replied.

“Jian Family?!” Zhou Chi yelled in fright.

Huang Xiaolong was equally as shocked.

The master of the Zhu Lan Lands was Zhu Chen, Zhu Qiming’s father.

The Jian Family in the Zhu Lan Lands was only second to the Zhu Family, and they were a hegemon in the Unknown Lands. The old ancestor of the Jian Family might not be a Supreme Overlord at the level of Zhu Chen and the others, but he was barely weaker than them!

If Huang Xiaolong were to compare him to the Limitless Master, the old ancestor of the Jian Family would be able to trash the Limitless Master even with the help of the Limitless Grand Formation.

In the Unknown Space, the old ancestor of the Jian Family was the strongest cultivator in the way of the sword!

“Why did they take her away?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

With their identity, there was no way the Jian Family would send their men over to kidnap Tao Han.

“According to them, Han’er is Jian Wushuang’s granddaughter!” Lin Qiankun hesitated before speaking.

That was the intelligence he managed to obtain after a ton of investigation.

As the matter concerned the Jian Family, Lin Qiankun had to personally carry out the investigation. With Zhu Chen’s identity as a Supreme Overlord and the Jian Family’s reputation in the Zhu Lan Lands, no one else had the guts or ability to look into the matter.

“What?!” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

Jian Wushuang was the old ancestor of the Jian Family.

“Yes… According to something that happened in the past, they lost Han’er in the Limitless Land.” Lin Xian explained. “All these years, the Jian Family has been trying to look for her.”

One could imagine the shock Lin Qiankun and Lin Xian felt when they learned of Tao Han’er’s identity.

Huang Xiaolong fell silent for a moment.

Lin Qiankun and the others didn’t dare to say a word.

“All of you can leave if there’s nothing else.” Huang Xiaolong muttered eventually.

Bowing respectfully, Lin Qiankun and the others returned to the Yin Yang City.

Nothing else happened that night and Huang Xiaolong left the Ice Mountain with Zhou Chi leading the way. They left for the Glorious Celestial Empire..

The reason he went there was to subdue Rong Hua. Rong Ying told Huang Xiaolong that his father was in possession of a ton of universe-level spiritual veins.
