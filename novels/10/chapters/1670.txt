“The Massacring Gods Gate’s alliance.” Huang Xiaolong’s face turned cold.

He had originally planned to eliminate the Black Ant Race and Devil Bone Race as they exterminated the Void Devil Beast Race, but now that they were planning to cast their lot to the Massacring Gods Gate, they couldn’t blame him for what he was about to do.

“Are the people from the Gu Family here?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

“Yes... Even Gu Chen showed up. Moreover, four other Emperor Realm ancestors from the Gu Family have arrived as well.” Fan Hui answered, “I have heard that Gu Chen, the Black Ant Race, and the Devil Bone Race are all heading over to pay their respects to Song Litao today.”

Huang Xiaolong’s face turned frosty when he heard this news.

“What about the Howling Moon Wolf Race? What’s the situation there?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

“The Howling Moon Wolf Race went to the city lord manor yesterday and tried to pressure him into capturing us. However, Wu Shisi represents the Dark Roc Race, and he isn’t stupid. Why will he offend us for a mere young master of the Howling Moon Wolf Race?” Tai Yue answered.

“Oh yes, the Dark Roc Race is planning to hold a large scale auction one month later in Nirvana City.” Wan Yutian continued, “They are really good at doing business... Everytime the Holy Mountain is born, they will take advantage of the fact that the various forces will gather here to hold an auction. Every time an auction is held, their profits shoot through the roof.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as he felt this was extremely normal behavior.

There would usually be tons of people gathered there when the Holy Mountain was about to be born. Those who came would usually be the strongest among the superpowers of their respective worlds. None of those young masters or old ancestors would lack the money to buy items in the auction.

Therefore, the profits gained from the auction would definitely be several hundred times more than the usual auction.

“What are the treasures they will be showcasing at the end of the auction?” Huang Xiaolong asked casually.

Even though the auction was held by the Dark Roc Race, none of the items could catch Huang Xiaolong’s attention. He felt that if the treasures they brought out at the end weren’t worth his time, he wouldn’t bother attending it.

“There are a total of three items for the finale. The first is an Emperor Realm Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, the second is ten sets of high-grade Unfettered Devil Extermination grandmist spiritual pills, and the last is a high-grade grandmist artifact, the Demonic Gourd.” Fan Hui answered.

Huang Xiaolong was shocked, “What, an Emperor Realm Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin?!”

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin had gone extinct for many years already, so it was no wonder that Huang Xiaolong was surprised to see that the Dark Roc Race would actually put it up for auction.

The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was a royal amongst the qilin, and its bloodline was extremely noble. Hence, the qilin appearing in the auction was rarer than usual.

“To be exact, this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin is actually in the mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm.” Fan Hui then continued, “I’m afraid the only reason why the Dark Roc Race is willing to take it out is because they are unable to tame it. They have no choice but to sell it off for a good price.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

Grandmist divine beasts were extremely hard to tame in the first place, not to mention a royal Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. Moreover, it was even a mid-Fourth Order Emperor.

Even though the Dark Roc Race was the fifth ranked superpower in the Hell Asura World and had countless inheritances when it came to taming beasts, they were unable to use any of those methods on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

However, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about this as he had the Grandmist Parasitic Medium and Grandmist Puppet Technique. With his current strength and the help of Tai Yue and the others, he was ninety percent certain that he would be able to tame that mid-Fourth Order Emperor Realm Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

He was lacking a mount right now and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was indeed a perfect choice for him.

“How many people do you think are planning to buy this Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin?” Huang Xiaolong asked, “What do you estimate the price to be?”

Jin Yuan was the one who replied, “I have heard that the starting price for it is ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones. Yesterday, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Song Litao declared that whoever dares to compete with him for the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin will be going against the Massacring Gods Gate! It looks like he is hell bent on buying it.”

Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Song Litao really thinks that the entire Hell Asura World belongs to the Massacring Gods Gate...”

However, Huang Xiaolong was still shocked at the starting price of ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones were rough equivalent to twenty low-grade chaos spiritual veins. The price was something that a superpower like the Asura Gate would have difficulty taking out.

Moreover, that was only the starting price. Hence, the final price of the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin would undoubtedly be a heaven-shaking one. Of course, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin would be worth every penny.

“What about those ten sets of high-grade Unfettered Devil Extermination grandmist spiritual pills and the high-grade grandmist artifact?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Since they were willing to sell a Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin in the auction, there had to be some reason they were selling the other two items.

“According to the outside sources, even though the Unfettered Devil Extermination pills were refined successfully, it was tainted with a bit of devil qi. As for the high-grade grandmist artifact, there is a small crack on it.” Jin Yuan answered.

So it’s like this. Huang Xiaolong thought inwardly.

However, even though the pills were a failure, it would not be a problem for Huang Xiaolong to refine it with his three avatars.

As for that Demonic Gourd, he would be able to restore it using the Blue Specter Spring.

“Ask the Netherworld King’s Chamber of Commerce to gather as many low-grade chaos spirit stones as possible.” Huang Xiaolong contemplated and said to Tai Yue and the three others.

Even though he had killed thirty five Massacring Gods Gate’s ancestors and obtained quite a number of low-grade chaos spirit stones from their spatial rings, it was still insufficient to buy those three treasures even if he added everything in his Black Dragon Cold Jade Bangle.

Hence, he had to gather as many low-grade chaos spirit stones as possible within the month.

What made him even more gloomy was the fact that he could only refine tenth-grade spirit stones after breaking through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm. It seemed like he would only be able to refine low-grade chaos spirit stones after breaking into the Emperor Realm.

I should have brought those hundreds of chaos spiritual veins lying inside the land of inheritance with me... Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. It was too bad he had already left the Mohe Plane.

“It’s rare for the weather to be so good, let’s take a walk outside.” Huang Xiaolong stood up and said to Tai Yue and the three of them.
