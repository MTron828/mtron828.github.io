Around an hour later, following Gu Ling, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived back at the Barbarian God Sect.

Back in the sect, Gu Ling had all the disciples including Huang Xiaolong and the Grand Elders disperse after telling them that the reward ceremony would be held tomorrow.

But before Gu Ling left, he looked at Huang Xiaolong with an amiable smile, saying, “Go back and rest well. Tomorrow, when we hold the reward ceremony, you can make one request; as long as I or the Ancestor are capable, we will fulfill it.”

All the present Grand Elders and disciples looked at Huang Xiaolong with envious eyes hearing Gu Ling’s words.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised, he nodded, “Thank you, Sect Chief.”

Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant reply rendered everyone stunned and speechless. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Who was Gu Ling? This was a promise from the Barbarian God Sect’s Chief and Ancestor ah!

How many families, forces, and cultivators on the Green Cloud Island wished they could be bestowed the same great fortune, yet here was Huang Xiaolong and his placid demeanor.

Gu Ling shook his head helplessly when he noticed that Huang Xiaolong didn’t show any excitement at all.

In fact, after obtaining the Zhenyu Sect’s treasury, he had spiritual veins, medicinal herbs, and whatnot, so he really didn’t put much weight on Gu Ling’s promise. Simply said, if he put forth a request for a grade three spiritual vein, would Gu Ling or Ancestor Lu Zhuo really give him one? Although these two were the most powerful characters in the Barbarian God Sect, they probably couldn’t afford to take out an entire grade three spiritual vein as a reward.

After everyone dispersed, Gu Ling headed straight to Ancestor Lu Zhuo’s cultivation dwelling at the back mountain instead of his own place to report the situation and results of the three sects’ joint training.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong was flying back to the Stone Lion Peak’s Sanctity of Order Mansion.

‘I wonder how that little cow Xiaoniū is doing.’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Even though they had parted for a short three months, in all truthfulness, Huang Xiaolong missed the little cow quite a bit.

However, back in his mansion, he couldn’t find even a shadow of the little cow despite searching every corner, causing a frown to appear between his brows.

‘Where did the little cow run off to?’

Whilst Huang Xiaolong was still perplexed about the little cow’s absence, he noticed that a large number of disciples were rushing toward the Black Steel Cliff.

The large movement attracted Huang Xiaolong’s attention, hence he stopped one of the disciples to inquire about the situation.

That disciple was dissatisfied being stopped by someone. He turned and was about to scold Huang Xiaolong, but he broke out in cold sweat when he saw his face. He woodenly bowed and smiled, “So it’s Senior Brother Huang ah, what instructions do you have?”

“What happened on the Black Steel Cliff?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Although the Black Steel Cliff was a short distance from the Stone Lion Peak, there was a large defensive formation over it that blocked all divine sense from probing. Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense was unable to enter and check the commotion.

“I heard a cow ate the Fantasm Godhead that Senior Sister Cao Feng bought at a high price. Right now, Senior Sister and a few other female core disciples are besieging that cow.” That disciple answered quickly, adding, “Everyone is going to take a look!”

A sharp light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, a cow?

Looks like that should be Xiaoniū. There was no doubt, otherwise this was too much of a coincidence. Not to mention that the little cow’s favorite activity was crunching on godheads.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong did not say anything, that disciple didn’t dare to speak either, neither did he dared to leave. Just as he was feeling internally conflicted, Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared before him in a flicker, flying off like a streak of golden light in the air. His destination was naturally the Black Steel Cliff.

That disciple was stupefied seeing that Huang Xiaolong was headed to the Black Cliff Ridge like everyone else.

Worried about the little cow’s safety, Huang Xiaolong actually flew at his fastest speed. The disciples that flew off earlier merely saw a dash of golden light passing beside them. By the time they recovered, that figure was already gone.

A The edges of their robes fluttered, leaving a group of astounded disciples.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Black Steel Cliff.

The moment his feet touched the ground, he could hear a loud moo and sensed the destructive lightning force energy.

After hearing the angered moo, Huang Xiaolong relaxed instead, for it showed that the little cow wasn’t injured.

As long as it was still fine, then all was well!

He continued rushing toward the Nine Heavens Palace on Black Steel Cliff. When he arrived, a large crowd of core disciples and inner disciples had already gathered. There was a female core disciple holding a Fire Phoenix and attacking cow, but the little cow retreated several steps, escaping danger.

Despite the little cow tough skin, it was far from an early Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm. If it wasn’t for the fact that it needed to support the thick layer of lightning liquid, the little cow’s tail would be pointed high at the sky by now after giving these disciples heavy injuries.

“Stop.” Huang Xiaolong shouted the instant he arrived. His shout startled everyone, causing them to look over their shoulder.

“Huang Xiaolong!”

A large number of disciples present immediately recognized him.

The little cow mooed happily seeing Huang Xiaolong. After escaping Cao Feng’s attack, it scurried over to Huang Xiaolong’s side.

“Xiaoniū, are you alright?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow grinned, “I’m alright. Even though this wench isn’t weak, she still can’t kill me.”

Huang Xiaolong’s concerned question to the little cow stirred Cao Feng’s anger, “Huang Xiaolong, your mount ate the Fantasm Godhead I bought at a high price from an auction. Don’t tell me you’re planning to protect this animal!”

The crowd of core disciples and inner disciples gasped, this mount actually belonged to Huang Xiaolong?

Huang Xiaolong was unperturbed, “How much money? I’ll compensate you.” The little cow was to blame, and since it didn’t suffer much, Huang Xiaolong did not intend to be overly calculative with a woman.

Cao Feng laughed, the thick ridicule obvious in her laughter, “Compensate? Who, you? I bought that Fantasm Godhead from the auction at thirty million, can you even afford that?”

Thirty million! Most of the prominent families’ Grand Elders would be hard-pressed to take out this amount of money, what’s more a disciple like Huang Xiaolong who hadn’t even spend three years in the Barbarian God Sect.

However, her voice just fell when Huang Xiaolong’s hand waved in the air. Shenbi rained to the ground, exactly thirty million. Not one more, and not one less.

Cao Feng felt as if there was a fish bone stuck in her throat watching this, her delicate face was slightly distorted with anger.

Leaving the money, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered to waste any more time. He then leaped onto the little cow’s back, ready to leave.

However, Cao Feng had never planned to let Huang Xiaolong go. She shrieked at him, “You want to run? Stop right there for me!”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“Huang Xiaolong, you can leave if you want, but that cow stays.” Cao Feng sneered, “This matter is settled after I kill that damn animal.”
