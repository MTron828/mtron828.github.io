Chapter 3666: Ferocious Devil’s Strength!

Zhu Chen’s figure slowly entered the depths of the Naihe Bridge.

In the blink of an eye, two million years passed.

Huang Xiaolong had long since refined all the universe-level spiritual veins he had. In fact, he completed the refinement several hundred thousand years ago. His grand cosmos energy was stuck at the 26.99999 billion mark.

A frown formed on his face all of a sudden as he stopped his cultivation.

He failed to break through no matter how hard he tried. Even after hundreds of thousands of years of comprehension, there were no signs of breaking through!

Huang Xiaolong sighed and he knew that his shallow foundation was the reason behind it.

All these years, he had been using the universe qi in the Universe Boat to cultivate and he experienced tremendous success. His speed was shockingly fast, but the amount of experience he had was too little! He didn’t truly understand the laws of the universe.

He had been comprehending the laws of the universe whenever he cultivated, but that was far from enough! The laws of the universe would bash against his dao heart from time to time and if he wasn’t careful, his dao heart would shatter!

The principle behind it was like a skyscraper without proper foundations!

Luckily for him, he had ridded himself of the hidden dangers when he devoured the bloodlines of Huang Sheng and the others. Otherwise, he would be in much more danger!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Several moments later, he left the Universe Boat.

The next thing he had to do was to continue to comprehend the laws of the universe. He also had to consolidate his foundations before he could break through to the peak of the grand completion stage!

The more he understood the universe laws, the more he realized that the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and the Pangu World Creation Art couldn’t keep up with his cultivation. Any one of them lagged far behind Jian Wushuang’s Unparalleled Manual!

They were even slightly worse than the cultivation methods used by Yu Xiaohong and cultivators who had broken through the 10 billion units mark.

As such, Huang Xiaolong decided to gather the techniques of the stronger cultivators under him to try to comprehend three more suitable techniques for himself!

Whatever the case, it wouldn’t be easy for him to do so. Even with his shocking talent, he couldn’t do it in a short period of time!

Despite that, he was in no rush. With his current strength, he was more than enough to hold off the entire Unknown Lands himself.

No matter if it was the Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, or the God of Death, none of them would be able to put up a fight against him!

The Green Ghost’s combat strength was at 25 billion units! With Huang Xiaolong’s numerous universe treasures, his combat strength far surpassed the 27 billion units mark!

The only person who Huang Xiaolong feared was the Ferocious Devil!

From Jian Wushuang, Huang Xiaolong learned that the Ferocious Devil was the reason behind the Unknown Lands surviving the tribulation that destroyed the thirteen universes.

It was said that the Ferocious Devil blocked off more than ninety percent of the power that was used to destroy the universes!

His strength should have far surpassed the 27 billion units mark!

One had to know that the power that nearly destroyed everything in the past was close to an attack from a Universe God. Huang Xiaolong knew how strong someone with 27 billion units of combat strength was. It was far from enough to do what the Ferocious Devil did.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong feared the Ferocious Devil, but he was still confident of holding him off.

No matter how strong the old devil was, he wouldn’t be able to destroy the Universe Boat!

Huang Xiaolong summoned Jian Wushuang Zhu Ji to ask them about the recent happenings and to ask about news on Zhu Chen.

The two of them shook their heads slowly.

“Is there still no news on him?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised.

Two million years had passed and Zhu Chen was nowhere to be seen! He didn’t even send a single message!

“No…” Zhu Ji sighed. “Ever since my father entered the Fengdu City, he seemed to have disappeared.”

Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Is it possible for him to leave the city?”

“It’s hard to say…” Jian Wushuang added. “Lord, why don’t I go over to the Fengdu City to take a look?”

“There’s no need.” Huang Xiaolong rejected his suggestion. “Let me go alone.”

“Alone?” Jian Wushuang and Zhu Ji were slightly stunned.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “There’s nothing wrong with it. The Fengdu City isn’t the Worldless Linluo Hell. Even if it is, I’ll be able to return safely.”

The two of them nodded slowly.

“Where’s Han’er?” Huang Xiaolong turned to Jian Wushuang and asked.

Jian Wushuang laughed, “In the years you were in seclusion, Han’er entered seclusion too. She refused to leave her cultivation chamber and wanted to close the gap between your strength. If you wish to see her, I’ll summon her. She will be elated to learn that you have left seclusion.”

“Alright. Please let her know.” Huang Xiaolong smiled.

This time, he would head over to the Fengdu City. All would be well if he found Zhu Chen. If he didn’t, Huang Xiaolong would change his target to the Dragon Overlord. He wouldn’t be able to return for some time. If Tao Han’er knew that he didn’t look for her after he left seclusion, she would feel neglected.

“Alright. I’ll tell her now.” Jian Wushuang turned to leave.

It didn’t take long for Tao Han’er to arrive. She was clad in a pure white dress and she exuded an air of calmness and elegance around her.

“Lord!” Tao Han’er grinned and ran over. “You finally left seclusion!”

“Yep. I heard from your grandpa that you had been in seclusion all these years. I didn’t bother you, did I?” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

A cute giggle left Tao Han’er’s lips. “I’ll like it if you bother me more…”

She looked at Huang Xiaolong with puppy-like eyes after speaking.

Coughing twice, Huang Xiaolong turned, only to see Jian Wushuang and Zhu Ji looking up at the sky.

“Alright, the two of you can leave. I’ll call for you if something comes up.” Huang Xiaolong said.

Acknowledging with a slight bow, they left. No one knew if Huang Xiaolong was mistaking things, but he thought he saw Jian Wushuang winking at his granddaughter as he left.

“Lord Huang, I heard from my grandfather that you plan to head to the Fengdu City.” Tao Han’er continued, “Can I follow you?”

An eager expression hung on her face as she continued, “I’m not weak any more! I should be able to remain in the city for some time!”

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes slightly. It seemed as though she had been cultivating hard the past two million years to gain enough power to resist the corrosive energy in the Fengdu City.

After so many years, her strength did experience an earth shaking transformation! She started to comprehend the elements, and he could tell that she had already started her comprehension on time and space!

Among the thirteen elements, time and space proved to be the most difficult elements to comprehend. Even so, she understood how they worked!
