Chapter 2832: Origin of the Blue Heaven Creed

Yu Sheng and Fang Jing's faces fell, and a terror overwhelemed them when they saw the fragments of Yi Beihang’s robe.

They knew that the patriarch’s robe was a peak-grade grand dao artifact, and it was tempered by Yi Beihang’s cosmos energy. It was way stronger than ordinary dao artifacts, but Huang Xiaolong’s attack had managed to shred it into countless pieces!

If they were to take on his attack, wouldn’t that mean…

Just as Yi Beihang was struck by Huang Xiaolong’s sword, three figures charged into the skies. They were Yan San, Wang Jin, and He Yugui who had been beaten down by Huang Xiaolong.

Yan San’s armor had long since been destroyed by the flames of nirvana, and the other two were covered in dust.

Wang Jin stared at Huang Xiaolong as panic and fear flashed in his eyes. Even though he tried to circulate his cosmos energy to suppress his injuries, the look of fear in his eyes betrayed his attempt to put up a brave front. The destructive energy from the power of nirvana ate at him, and he felt as though he was right before the gates of hell!

As a Dao Venerable, it was preposterous for him to feel that way! After all, he wasn’t supposed to die! At least not at the hands of a Primal Ancestor!

Even so, that was the feeling he was getting!

Wang Jin and He Yugui stared into Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and like Yan San, they failed to hide the fear in their hearts.

When they joined hands to fight against the kid, it was as though they were running headfirst into a Third Esteem Dao Venerable! No! The power Huang Xiaolong possessed was even stronger than an ordinary Third Esteem Dao Venerables!

His physical body was even stronger than theirs! As for his cosmos energy, it went without saying that it was leagues ahead of them!

They couldn’t understand how a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor could possess so much power!

They stared at Huang Xiaolong with a blank look, and none of them dared to move. A sprout of doubt formed in their hearts!

Three Dao Venerables were cowering before a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor!

From afar, the experts from the Blue Heaven Creed had no idea how to react. They stood there quietly as the world seemed to turn silent.

A deafening sound broke the silence as Yi Beihang tore through the ground.

Compared to earlier, Yi Beihang was much more embarrassed compared to the others. The fear in his heart was several times more than the rest!

“Huang… Huang Xiaolong, what do you actually want from me?!” Yi Beihang stammered.

Everyone couldn’t believe what they were hearing.

Breaking out into laughter, Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Weren’t you going on about killing me? Yi Beihang, didn’t you say that I won’t get a chance to beg for mercy even if I wanted to?!”

Their faces turned red in embarrassment.

“Yan San, when you offered a reward to capture me, did you think that this would be your end?! When you exterminated the various powers and killed countless disciples to force me out, did you foresee such an end?!” Huang Xiaolong glared at Yan San and snorted.

Yan San’s face turned extremely ugly.

He continued indifferently, “Since you’re finally asking me what I want, I shall state my conditions! I want the Blue Heaven Creed to gather the patriarchs under you and apologize to me publicly!”

Their expressions changed in an instant.

Gathering everyone under them to apologize to a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor?!

“In addition, I want half your treasury.” Huang Xiaolong added.

Their expressions sank even further.

Half of the Blue Heaven Dao Creed’s treasury!

“Lastly, I want you guys to hand Yan San over to me. I’ll deal with him however I like,” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed.

Their faces crumpled when he stated his final condition. Especially Yan San’s, whose face was darker than black. He then laughed maniacally, “You want us to apologize publicly to a mere Primal Ancestor along with half the treasury?! Are you deluded?! Do you really think I’ll submit to you just because you said so? Hahaha!”

“Huang Xiaolong, who do you think you are?! No matter what, you’re a mere Primal Ancestor! Do you really think our Blue Heaven Creed is helpless before you?!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Killing intent flashed in his eyes, “We have yet to activate the origin of our creed! The moment we do, you’ll die even if you’re ten times stronger!”

That was right. Their dao origin was the strongest weapon they possessed! Every creed produced a dao origin of their own, and it was their strongest weapon! A Dao Venerable might fall, but their dao origin was eternal!

It was the foundation of their power, and it ensured that a creed would be able to stay in power!

The dao origin would stimulate the grand dao laws when it was gathered by the disciples during their cultivation process! When it happened for hundreds of thousands of years, the dao origin would be born!

With countless years of accumulation, one could only imagine how strong a dao creed’s dao origin was!

“Huang Xiaolong!” Yi Beihang’s face sank, and he snorted, “Don’t push your luck! If you turn around and leave now, we can pretend that nothing happened here today! Otherwise, we wouldn’t mind using everything we have to activate the dao origin! When that happens, you won’t be able to live past today!”

Naturally, it would consume a lot of resources for them to do that. It wouldn’t be easy to kill an existence like Huang Xiaolong.

As such, the best-case scenario would be for Huang Xiaolong to leave quietly.

A sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Allow me to leave? Killing me with your dao origin?! Alright. Since you think so highly of yourself, I want half of your dao origin!”

“What?!”

The faces of everyone in the Blue Heaven Creed changed when they heard what he said. The dao origin was the root of their creed, and not even the entire treasury could compare to half of the dao origin!

How in the world were they supposed to accept his condition?!

“Since we have nothing else to discuss, you can go to hell!” Yan San snarled. “Patriarch, we have to take him down regardless of the price we have to pay!”

Yi Beihang nodded his head furiously, and he signaled for Wang Jin and He Yugui to assist him.

Rays of light surrounded the four of them as cosmos energy poured into the deepest part of the creed.

The entire area started to tremble as a terrifying force descended on the lands. The pressure it brought about was so heavy that everyone found it hard to breathe.
