Chapter 3499: Stop!

He approached Lu Qianqian the moment he arrived. Nodding slightly, he greeted her, “Teacher Lu…”

Lu Qianqian returned his greeting with a nod. “Shan Fei, are you also here to register?”

She wasn’t too fond of Shan Fei. Even though he was the leading disciple in the institute and possessed immeasurable talent, he was extremely arrogant. He would constantly challenge the teachers of the institute and find glory in defeating them.

Even so, his prestige among the students was unchallenged due to his strength and talent.

“That’s right!” Shan Fei chuckled. “It’s been several months, and no one managed to pass the test. Since that’s the case, I’ll come over to mess about. Being a librarian is pretty good…”

His words were extremely arrogant, but he had the ability to back them up.

Shen Dong frowned at the side. As a teacher at the institute, he didn’t like Shan Fei.

However, Shan Fei’s background was terrifying, and he didn’t dare to provoke such an existence.

As soon as he spoke, the entrance of the library shook and a figure emerged.

Everyone stared at the person who appeared in disbelief.

“It hasn’t been half an hour! Why is he out?” Several students yelped in shock.

“Don’t tell me he was forced out in half an hour…” someone else chimed.

Everyone’s gaze landed on Lu Qianqian.

After all, she brought him over, and he ran out in less than half an hour. He was definitely disgracing her.

Like everyone else, a strange look could be seen on her face as she looked at Huang Xiaolong.

In the distance, Shen Shijie chuckled happily, “Second Uncle, this brat is really daring. He dares to come over to take the test with his meager strength…”

Shen Dong chuckled. He was pretty curious about Lu Qianqian’s foster father and his direct disciple, but from the looks of it, it didn’t matter.

In the months that passed, everyone who took the test managed to hold on for six to seven hours. Not a single person ran out before half an hour was up.

Shan Fei sneered arrogantly when he saw Huang Xiaolong emerge. “Brat, which hole did you crawl out from? You escaped before half an hour was up… Do you really think you’re strong enough to be a librarian here?”

His voice might not be loud, but it rang through the hall. He didn’t know that Huang Xiaolong was brought over by Lu Qianqian. If he did, he wouldn’t openly mock him.

The disciples standing around burst into laughter.

Shan Fei looked at Huang Xiaolong and sneered, “Weakling, since you failed, get the f*ck out of my way. Stop blocking the entrance to the library.”

Before anyone else could speak. A silver-haired elder emerged from the library. He was one of the people in charge of the test, and he looked at Huang Xiaolong as a complicated emotion flashed in his eyes, “Congratulations on passing the test…”

The moment the words left his lips, the laughter in the hall died.

Lu Qianqian was shocked, and Shan Fei’s jaws dropped.

“Passed?!” Shen Shijie gasped in shock. “He took half an hour to pass the test?! He walked to the end of the sixth level in less than half an hour?!”

Shen Dong was equally as shocked.

Shan Fei stepped forward all of a sudden and asked, “Lord Luo Feng, are you sure?! This brat managed to reach the end in half an hour?!”

The silver-haired elder frowned in displeasure when his judgment was questioned. “All four of us witnessed the scene.”

Everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong as complex emotions welled up in their hearts. Since Lord Luo Feng personally confirmed it, there was no way Huang Xiaolong failed!

Huang Xiaolong looked at Shan Fei with a frosty expression. “If you kneel and apologize now, I’ll allow you to leave. Otherwise, I’ll cripple you!”

There were rules set in the institution that no one was allowed to kill the other party even during fights. That was something Pangu had specially reminded Huang Xiaolong of, and breaking the rules of the institution would result in dire consequences.

However, crippling the other party was still allowed.

Shan Fei was stunned for a second, but he looked at Huang Xiaolong as a sneer formed on his lips soon after. “Brat, who do you think you are?! Do you really think you’re somebody now that you passed the test? Alright. If you kneel in front of me right now and call me your ancestor, you might be able to live to see tomorrow!” A sinister gaze flashed in his eyes.

“Otherwise…”

Shen Dong shook his head and smiled. From what he saw, Huang Xiaolong was going too far. He didn’t know who Shan Fei was, and he offended the other party. Not even someone like him would be able to offend Shan Fei!

Lu Qianqian probably wouldn’t be able to get him out of this…Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, Huang Xiaolong reached out and pressed Shan Fei into the ground before anyone could react. A human-shaped hole formed in the ground as Shan Fei was forced to eat dirt.

Shen Dong and the others standing around were shocked.

The strongest disciple in the Submerged Dragon Institute, Shan Fei, who managed to accumulate 1.2 billion units of grand cosmos energy in several million years was defeated with a single strike!

Lu Qianqian stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

Not even she could do something like that!

Shan Fei released his aura completely as he struggled to get Huang Xiaolong off him. However, he failed to move a muscle no matter how hard he tried.

“You’re tired of living!” With nothing else he could do, Shan Fei screamed in rage, “If you don’t release me right now, my masters will definitely make you pay for this! You’ll regret this!”

Shan Fei had three masters in total, and all of them were shockingly powerful in the Star Dragon Universe! As such, not even the old ancestor of the Shen Family would dare to provoke him!

“We’ll talk about this when your masters come,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “However, they’re not here to save you now, are they?”

The armor around Shan Fei shattered as blood streamed down his body. If this kept up, his physical body would be crippled!

The teachers and students standing around fell silent.

Even Lu Qianqian didn’t utter a word.

She wanted to stop him, but she stopped when she thought about what her foster father said.

Right before Shan Fei’s physical body was destroyed, Luo Feng yelled, “Stop!”
