Chapter 1267: The Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit

The little cow shouted urgently, "WATCH OUT!"

In a split second, a streak of black light flew towards Huang Xiaolong at a speed that would be difficult even for an average Seventh Order Ancient God Realm cultivator to dodge.

But Huang Xiaolong’s palm struck out and sent the black light tumbling backward. Almost simultaneously, the little cow’s purple lightning struck the black light right after him.

As the black light dimmed, something fell to the ground in the distance.

Huang Xiaolong saw that it was a black scaly creature that was half a meter long, and had a ghostly face. A big head that was out of proportion to its body and a big mouth with sharp teeth.

"It’s a ghost-faced viper!" The little cow recognized the creature.

Ghost-faced viper? Huang Xiaolong had never heard of this thing.

“It’s a variant of the snake species from Hell, they specifically like eating human heads and godheads. Don’t underestimate it. Although its size is small and it’s attacks are weak, its teeth are extremely sharp and toxic. And don’t forget its speed either. If you’re careless and get bitten by it, it will be a hassle.” The little cow stated.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement.

Since the little cow had advised him to be vigilant about the ghost-faced vipers, Huang Xiaolong decided to be a little more careful.

“C’mon, let’s move on.” Huang Xiaolong said and turned around as he prepared to leave.

“A snake’s gallbladder is a wonderful supplement, and the ghost-faced viper’s gallbladder is even more potent.” The little cow stopped Huang Xiaolong, “Good things cannot be wasted.”

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell onto the ghost-faced viper’s ghastly face and vehemently shook his head, “If you want, you take it.”

The little cow didn’t even bother to fake courtesy. She immediately split the ghost-faced viper’s body open with a swing of her golden horns, and took out a dark jade-green, thumb-sized gallbladder.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected that the ghost-faced viper’s gallbladder would look so charming, contrary to its ugly appearance.

However, the little cow did not swallow the gallbladder on the spot, but she put it away inside the space within her collar. This collar was a spatial divine artifact, which she forged for herself.

The two continued deeper into the Devil Prison Mountain. They hadn’t gone far, when another ghost-faced viper attacked them.

As they went further in, Huang Xiaolong was astonished. In the past few hours, other than the ghost-faced vipers, they were also attacked by other kinds of Hell creatures.

All the Hell creatures he had come across so far were weird-looking. In truth, he found them quite disgusting. These creatures hid in the dark, which made it hard to defend against them.

Fortunately, most of these Hell creatures’ attacks were weak, and those that attacked him were below Ninth Order Ancient God Realm strength. On the other hand, the deeper they went, the corrosive devil qi became stronger. Even with Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique and Innumerable Buddha Godhead’s purification power, it was becoming strenuous.

“We will rest for a while over there.” Huang Xiaolong said to the little cow, when he saw a small stretch of forest up ahead.

A few breaths later, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were standing at the edge of a small forest. Earlier, he had not noticed the forest’s unusualness, but now, from a close distance, he could see that there was something mysterious about it.

The small forest consisted of only one kind of tree called Colourful Magic Tree, which originated from Hell.

The Colourful Magic Tree emits a light like a rainbow, which can make people fall into hallucination. Cultivators with a weaker soul immediately fall into hallucination the moment they get close to the colorful lights of this tree, and then gradually turn into mindless magic creatures.

“This forest is probably here to protect something.” The little cow said. Her words astounded Huang Xiaolong.

Protecting something? The little cow’s words stoked Huang Xiaolong’s curiosity about the thing that was being protected by this forest of Colourful Magic Trees.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow rested for a while before they stepped into the forest. The moment they stepped inside, colorful rays of lights enshrouded them.

These colorful lights rippled with the power of hallucinations that seeped into Huang Xiaolong’s mind, however, the moment it entered his mind, it was completely devoured by the Moon Jade Spiral Shell’s silver moonlight.

Huang Xiaolong had dared to step into this Colourful Magic Tree forest only because this grandmist spiritual artifact. On the other hand, the little cow was enveloped by a layer of purple lightning’s light which was keeping her safe from the power of hallucinations.

They slowly ventured inside with a great caution.

They had been walking for almost an hour when they reached an open space. The colorful lights suddenly disappeared, and so did the power of hallucinations.

There was only one tree growing in this open space! And there were a dozen of resplendent fruits hanging from its branches.

Though there was some distance between them and this tree, the resplendent glow from these fruits felt more like a glare to Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, which was unexpected for him.

"This is...the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit!" He heard the little cow exclaim with an ecstatic face. She quickly rushed towards the tree before Huang Xiaolong could say a word.

“This Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit, it is a very famous spiritual fruit in Hell, isn’t it?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking, even though he knew that things which could make the little cow ecstatic were surely treasures.

The little cow answered enthusiastically, “Famous, very famous! Is the Ancestral Dragon Fruit famous? The Ancestral Dragon Fruit is one of the top ten fruits of wonder between heaven and earth, yet it only ranks tenth. But this Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit ranks eighth! Eighth ah!”

As if she was afraid that Huang Xiaolong didn’t hear her, the little cow repeated ‘Eighth’ once more.

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded. ‘Ranks eights amongst the top ten wonder fruits between heaven and earth? This Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit, which was right in front of him, ranked eighth?!’ Had the Devil Prison Mountain’s environment actually nurtured this Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Tree?

“Good stuff ah, good stuff.” The little cow couldn’t stop tsk-ing in delight as she and Huang Xiaolong stood in front of the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Tree. “Although this Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit ranks eighth among the top ten wonder fruits, it’s medicinal properties are ten times better than the Ancestral Dragon Fruit. The Ancestral Dragon Fruit was born because it was stained with a mouthful of the Ancestral Dragon’s blood essence, whereas this Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit was born through the condensation of natural metal element, spiritual energy and devil qi. Therefore, these two fruits stand at very different strengths from one another.”

Huang Xiaolong had started catching up on the little cow’s excitement as he looked at the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Tree.

In front of him, stood a complete and intact Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Tree. If he got this tree, wouldn’t that mean he’d have an endless supply of Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit?

But his hopes were dashed when he asked the little cow about the Seven Colored Metal Fiend Tree’s frequency of bearing fruits. The little cow had said, “This Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Tree bears fruits every one million years, similar to the Ancestral Dragon Tree.”

On second thought, Huang Xiaolong still uprooted the tree along with its fruits into his Ghost-Buddha Ring. After that, they went back into the forest, following the same path that they had used to reach this open space.

As Huang Xiaolong made his way towards the edge of the forest, he saw quite a few sects’ disciples running amok, including a few Golden Phoenix Pavilion disciples. It seemed like they had fallen into hallucination. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong ignored these disciples as moved on. After leaving the forest, he and the little cow flew further inside the mountain.

...

Ten days had passed since the Devil Prison Mountain had appeared in the Void Sky City.

During this time, Huang Xiaolong had found several stalks of chaos spiritual herbs and some rare precious spiritual stones, but he was yet to find the location of the void devil beast’s sealed soul.

By this point, there were more and more various sects’ experts and disciples entering the Devil Prison Mountain, and a large number of them were Ancestor God Realm masters.

After some thoughts, Huang Xiaolong decided to stay on the Devil Prison Mountain for another two days. But after these two days were over, he decided to leave the mountain, even if he would have failed to locate the void devil beast’s soul! After that, he planned to find a place to refine the Seven-Colored Metal Fiend Fruit, and further raise his strength, before resuming his journey to the Clear Spirit World.
