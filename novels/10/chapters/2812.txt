Chapter 2813: Huang Xiaolong Has Appeared!

Huang Xiaolong easily recognized them as the core disciples of the Blue Heaven Creed from their robes.

As soon as they stopped the party, one of the disciples stepped forward and spoke, “I am Ren Huai of the Blue Heaven Creed, and I would like to ask Patriarch Fu Daosheng a question.”

“Ren Huai?! One of the ten strongest geniuses of the younger generation in the Blue Heaven Creed!” someone yelled in shock. “He’s the direct disciple of Ancestor He Yugui!”

The crowd started to clamor when they realized who the person was.

“It’s him! Before the Saint Devil Prince entered the Blue Heaven Creed, he was said to be the leader of the ten geniuses! He isn’t any weaker when compared to the Saint Devil Prince…”

Everyone wanted to watch the scene that would play out now that Ren Huai had stopped Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Glancing at Ren Huai, Fu Daosheng snorted, “What do you want?”

Even if the other party was the disciple of one of the ancestors in the Blue Heaven Creed, he was the number one expert of the Talisman Heavenly Cave! He Yugui might scare him, but a mere disciple wasn’t qualified to question him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

A frown formed on Ren Huai’s face when he noticed Fu Daosheng’s nonchalant attitude. “I’ve heard that Patriarch Fu entered the Immemorial Immortal Cave previously.”

“Why would I need to report my whereabouts to someone like you?”

Ren Huai’s expression sank once again. “You might be the patriarch of the Talisman Dao Sacred Land, but your identity is nowhere near comparable to my Blue Heaven Creed! You had better tell us the location of the Immemorial Immortal Cave right now!”

“Also, report to me everything you know of Huang Xiaolong. If you refuse to do anything I said and insist on keeping the Immemorial Immortal Cave…”

Ren Huai sneered.

Ordinarily, he wouldn’t dare to speak to Fu Daosheng in that tone of voice. After all, the other party was the master of the Talisman Heavenly Cave. However, they were currently in the territory of the Blue Heaven Creed, and Ren Huai felt as though there was nothing for him to worry about.

Not a single person would dare to act out of line in the Silver Dragon City. After all, they were currently in the heart of the Blue Heaven Creed.

“What if he refuses?” Huang Xiaolong interjected, shocking everyone present.

“Who the hell are you?” Ren Huai glared at the impudent brat who dared to speak to him when he was addressing Fu Daosheng.

Like everyone else, he had long since noticed Huang Xiaolong. He could see that the kid was a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor, and he couldn’t be sure of the other party’s identity since Fu Daosheng was following obediently behind him. If ordinary Second Resurrection Primal Ancestors dared to interrupt him, he would have killed them with a single slap.

“You’re asking about my identity?” A trace of amusement flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. “Weren’t you looking for me?”

Ren Huai and the others were shocked.

“You’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Ren Huai’s expression changed as an image flashed through his mind.

However, the intelligence reports didn’t say that Huang Xiaolong was a Primal Ancestor! Wasn’t he supposed to be in the True Saint Realm?!

The suspicion in his heart started to grow deeper.

He even thought that the brat before him was messing with him.

“Brat, are you really Huang Xiaolong?!”

Huang Xiaolong responded with an expressionless face, “That’s right. Who in their right mind will pretend to be me?”

Indeed, there were too many experts searching for Huang Xiaolong right now. No one was stupid enough to pretend to be the criminal hunted down by almost all the experts present in the Silver Dragon River.

When the Primal Ancestors in the surroundings heard that it was really Huang Xiaolong, a trace of greed appeared in their eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, who would have thought that you would show yourself on my Silver Dragon Island? You can hand over the Immemorial Sword and treasury now,” Ren Huai narrowed his eyes and growled.

“What if I refuse?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“I’ll kill you if you don’t! If you hand it over, my Blue Heaven Creed will promise you that we’ll allow you to live!”

Huang Xiaolong sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “What a pity. I hate it when people try to threaten me.”

“It seems like you have chosen death!” Ren Huai growled as his arms turned into claws that shot towards Huang Xiaolong. “If anyone dares to protect you today, you’ll be turning the Blue Heaven Creed into your enemy! When that happens, you can’t blame me for hunting you down and taking my revenge!”

He was clearly warning Fu Daosheng and the others.

However, a trace of light flashed through the air and left a bloody scar on Ren Huai’s arm before he could reach Huang Xiaolong. With a trace of rage burning in his eyes, Ren Huai turned to glare at Fu Daosheng. “Fu Daosheng, are you going to go against my Blue Heaven Creed for this kid?!”

He didn’t expect that his warning would fall on deaf ears.

With an expression too ugly to describe, Ren Huai snarled, “Fu Daosheng, I might not know what treasures the kid promised you, but you’re too f*cking stupid! You’re crazy for making the Blue Heaven Creed as your enemy just for a few grand dao artifacts! Do you think we’ll allow your Talisman Sacred Land to go free after this?!”

According to him, Fu Daosheng definitely had obtained some benefits from the Immemorial Treasury. Otherwise, there was no way someone like him would protect a weakling like Huang Xiaolong.

By staring coldly at the other party, Fu Daosheng ignored him.

Sweeping his gaze across Zhou Hong and the rest, Ren Huai snarled, “Since that’s the case, I’ve already given you my warning. When my Blue Heaven Creed exterminates your faction, you had better not beg us for mercy!”

The Blue Heaven Creed was an almighty existence in the eyes of the various sacred lands. Not a single faction would dare to go against them.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t think that I won’t be able to do anything to you with Fu Daosheng and the others protecting you!” Ren Huai glared at Huang Xiaolong before retreating.

Letting the man leave, Huang Xiaolong chuckled in his heart.

“Xiaolong, do we…?” Cangqiong Old Man asked anxiously.

“There’s no need to worry. Everything is under control.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly.

With Cangqiong Old Man and the others in tow, he entered the Silver Dragon City.

The moment Huang Xiaolong entered the city, the Saint Devil Prince was listening to a report about the Huang Long Armor from his subordinate in one of the nearby cities.

“The Huang Long Armor Map appeared half a day ago in the Brilliant Light Island?!” The Saint Devil Prince jumped in shock when he received the news.

“That’s right. It appeared half a day ago, but it disappeared all of a sudden.”

The map was made from a piece of dragon scale, and it was something that had sentience. It could escape whenever it wanted to.

“Brilliant Light Island! We’re heading there now!” The Saint Devil Prince jumped to his feet and yelled.

Before he could leave, another disciple from the Blue Heaven Creed rushed into the hall and screamed, “Senior Brother Xu Jian, that… that… that brat called Huang Xiaolong has appeared!”
