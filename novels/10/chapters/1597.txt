According to Jiang Hong’s initial plan, he was planning to inform his Master the King of Grandmist prior to arriving at the Grandmist Lands. But the little cow had said that she wanted to give the King of Grandmist a surprise, hence, Jiang Hong could only conceal the matter.

Hearing Jiang Hong’s confirmation, the little cow nodded with satisfaction and said, “Wait till we see Old Man Grandmist, I will explain clearly to him.”

Jiang Hong replied, “Yes, I’ll trouble Senior Azure Cow then.”

“Senior Brother, what does the Master look like?” As the Dragon Shark Flying Ship came closer to the Grandmist Lands, Huang Xiaolong suddenly felt nervous.

Had it been someone else, Huang Xiaolong would have still been calm, but this Master of his was the King of Grandmist!

The true number one person of the Divine World!

Anyone would feel nervous.

Even Li Lu and Yao Chi standing beside Huang Xiaolong looked nervous.

Li Lu and Yao Chi had not known that Huang Xiaolong was coming to pay his respects to the King of Grandmist. Both of them had learned this not too long ago.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong, Li Lu, and Yao Chi’s nervousness, Jiang Hong grinned and reassured them, “Master is an easy-going person, so Junior Brother need not be nervous. Moreover, Master will be extremely happy to receive Senior Azure Cow and Junior Brother. I have yet to tell Master about Junior Brother, but when Master learns of Junior Brother’s talent, he won’t be able to stop smiling from ear to ear.”

The little cow grinned at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Old Man Grandmist is just an ordinary old man, not tall nor short, not slim nor fat, and neither handsome or ugly.”

Huang Xiaolong squeezed a wry smile.

Only this old cow dares to describe the King of Grandmist this way.

An ordinary old man?

In the Divine World, even in the entire universe, who would dare to describe the King of Grandmist as an ordinary old man?

Time trickled, and half a day went by.

The Dragon Shark Flying Ship sped across the Grandmist Galaxy.

According to Senior Brother Jiang Hong, the Grandmist Galaxy was bigger than the Black Dragon Clan’s desolate world surface. Based on the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s speed, there was another day or so until they arrived at the Grandmist Lands.

As Huang Xiaolong spoke with Senior Brother Jiang Hong and the little cow about the King of Grandmist, his nervousness slipped away.

“That Grandmist Fruit ripens once every hundred million years. Junior Brother and Senior Azure Cow came at the right time.” said Jiang Hong. “When the Grandmist Fruit ripens, it could only stay fresh for a year. If a fruit is not consumed within a year’s time, it would disintegrate into spiritual energy, and scattered away.”

Huang Xiaolong’s mind moved, “Senior Brother, the Grandmist Fruit’s effects are so good?”

Jiang Hong smiled, “Of course! Though the Grandmist Fruit is not listed in the top seven wonder fruits, its effects are ten thousand times better than the number one fruit from the top seven wonder fruits. Even a Heavenly Monarch Realm expert could feel a significant rise in his strength after consuming the Grandmist Fruit. It may be less beneficial to an Emperor Realm expert, but consuming the Grandmist Fruit could improve an Emperor Realm expert’s physical attributes, and expel impurities from one’s soul, among other benefits.”

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely astounded.

“Furthermore, the first time consuming the Grandmist Fruit brings the benefits. Junior Brother is already at the peak late-Sixth Order God King Realm, you could break through to Ninth Order God King Realm, even Tenth Order God King Realm!” Jiang Hong shared excitedly.

Excitement rose up Huang Xiaolong’s chest. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

If Huang Xiaolong could break through to high-level God King Realm in one go, he would be able to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade’s fourth restriction.

At that time, his strength would improve by leaps and bounds once again.

“Senior Brother, what level of strength do you think one needs to enter the top ten of the Battle of the Heavenly Court?” Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked Jiang Hong.

Jiang Hong blanked momentarily, then answered, “At least Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong felt a blow, and he repeated, “Needs the strength of a Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch?!” Initially, he had assumed having low-level Heavenly Monarch Realm strength was enough to secure a place in the top ten. Who would have thought that his Senior Brother Jiang Hong would say Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

“What about the top three and first place?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking.

“If it’s the top three, probably the strength of a Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, as for first place, it’s hard to say.” Jiang Hong said whilst shaking his head.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

Senior Brother Jiang Hong is the Divine World’s number one person, the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s heavy weight, so he had seen more things and was well-informed. Since Senior Brother Jiang Hong said that the cultivator would need to be at least a Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm to be in the top three places, then it wouldn’t be far off.

Moreover, not even Senior Brother Jiang Hong could determine what level of strength could secure the first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court?

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s expression, Jiang Hong said, “You don’t need to feel discouraged, Junior Brother. With Junior Brother’s talent and cultivation speed, by the time of the Battle of the Heavenly Court, Junior Brother’s strength would definitely be enough to enter the top ten.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly as he said, “Senior Brother doesn’t need to comfort me. There’s less than a hundred years until the Battle of the Heavenly Court, so it will be difficult for me to break through to mid-level Heavenly Monarch Realm by then!”

If low-level Heavenly Monarch Realm strength was sufficient to win first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, Huang Xiaolong still had a certain grasp, but now, his chances were too slim.

There was a big difference in strength between low-level and mid-level Heavenly Monarch Realm.

There were First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm experts that couldn’t break through to Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm in ten thousand years. Even for Huang Xiaolong, it was impossible to break through from the peak late-Sixth Order God King Realm to Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm in less than a hundred years!

Jiang Hong choked. “Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm? In truth, Junior Brother doesn’t need to reach the Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. Based on Junior Brother’s battle prowess, as long as you advance to the Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm by then, you will be able to secure a place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court’s top ten.”

Jiang Hong was not spewing empty words, as Huang Xiaolong had amazing battle prowess. As long as he broke through to the Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, there was hope for him to enter the top ten in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

The little cow interjected from the side, “Kiddo Huang’s target is not entering the top ten, but the first place! He signed up for the Battle of the Heavenly Court aiming for the top spot.”

Jiang Hong was dumbfounded—first place? He shook his head inwardly, despite knowing Huang Xiaolong’s amazing talent, still, to grab the first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court was impossible in his opinion.

“Junior Brother snatching the first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court is a little difficult.” Jiang Hong pondered for a while then said. “To tell you frankly, among the disciples selected from my Grandmist Emperor Palace that fits the Battle of the Heavenly Court’s requirements, two of them are Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. The strongest among them is a disciple named Li Junhua, a peak late-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes widened in surprise. He realized now why Senior Brother Jiang Hong had said that one would need the strength of a Fifth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, in the least, to enter the top three.

“Moreover, from the information I’ve received, the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Emperor’s Disciple has a bone-age below a hundred thousand years. He’s also eligible to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. The Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple is also a peak late-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!” Jiang Hong revealed. “Although the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple is slightly weaker, he’s still a peak mid-Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.”

Huang Xiaolong was astonished once again.

The Fiend God Emperor’s Disciple has already reached the peak of Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Jiang Hong then shook his head as he said, “Then again, whether it is our Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Li Junhua, the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Disciple, or the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple, none of them have hopes of getting the first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.”

Others were baffled by his words.

The little cow added, “Kiddo Grandmist, enough with the secrecy, just tell us, in your opinion, who is most likely to win first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court this time?”

Feeling everyone’s attention on him, Jiang Hong slowly said, “The Heavenly Son is likely to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court this time.”

The Heavenly Son!

The Heavenly Emperor’s son!

In other words, without accident, Jiang Hong thought that the Heavenly Son was the likeliest person to win first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.
