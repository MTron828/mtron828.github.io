Wangu Ziyi laughed nonchalantly seeing the ferocity and killing intent on Huang Xiaolong’s face. His mocking tone changed as he said, "Then again, if you can win against me, I will give you those chaos spiritual liquids."

Although he was no longer confident to defeat Huang Xiaolong in five strikes, he still had the confidence to defeat him.

Cold lights glimmered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes but he did not say anything, as he guessed that there would be a latter part to Wangu Ziyi’s words.

As expected, Wangu Ziyi continued, “But, if you lose, I want three hundred golden beads!” He looked at Huang Xiaolong with a burning gaze at the thought of three hundred golden beads.

Three hundred golden beads!

Everyone around the battle stage looked at Huang Xiaolong with eyes widened in shock, and gasps sounded from the various corners.

Does Huang Xiaolong really have three hundred golden beads?!

As Huang Xiaolong heard Wangu Ziyi demanding for three hundred golden beads, a faint frown appeared between his brows for a moment, then disappeared just as quickly.

It looked like the matter about the thirty golden beads that he had given to Luo Yunjie and the five golden beads to Wu Qian’er had spread out, if not Wangu Ziyi wouldn’t have said something like this.

Huang Xiaolong trusted Luo Yunjie, thus he believed that the news wouldn’t have leaked from his mouth, and it didn’t seem to be Wu Qian’er either. Most likely, it was Zhou Xu, Tan Lin, and the other disciples who might have heard or seen something, and deliberately leaked the news to Wangu Ziyi.

Fortunately, he had given Luo Yunjie only thirty golden beads at that time, therefore, Wangu Ziyi must have estimated that he had about three hundred golden beads in his hand at the most.

“Deal!” Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement. Since Wangu Ziyi knew he had golden beads, it was unnecessary to conceal the matter.

Greed shone in Wangu Ziyi’s eyes as Huang Xiaolong admitted he had three hundred golden beads.

“However, how can I be sure that you won’t renege again?” Huang Xiaolong’s tone changed as he took out a spatial ring, and added, “Inside here are three hundred golden beads, where are those chaos spiritual liquids?”

Golden rays of glimmering lights shone out from the spatial ring, reaching four sides of the battle stage as Huang Xiaolong lifted the restrictions on the spatial ring.

Wangu Ziyi’s burning gaze intensified and he immediately took out several bottles of chaos spiritual liquids. Similar to Huang Xiaolong, he also wiped off the restrictions on the bottles, and immediately, resplendent glows shone out from the bottles.

After both sides confirmed their items, they handed them to Wang Shi for safekeeping.

Wangu Ziyi looked at Huang Xiaolong and a sinister smile appeared on his face. “Huang Xiaolong, do you think you can win against me just because your frigid godforce can suppress my qilin flames? I know that your True Dragon Physique is very strong, but today, I’m going to test for myself if your physique is really as strong as the rumors outside claim it to be!” Waves of dark green flames appeared from Wangu Ziyi’s body just as he finished speaking.

In the next moment, the crowd saw something that looked like jade, but also like steel appear on the surface of Wangu Ziyi’s body, and covering him like an armor of scales. A violent momentum rushed out from his body, which spread across the whole stage and beyond.

“This, what is this? A unique physique? No, it feels more like an ancient physique tempering divine art!”

“Could it be the ancient Crystal Beast Body divine art?!”

Experts in the crowd were shocked watching the changes in Wangu Ziyi’s body, as each of them speculating the similar possibility.

As the crowd discussed below the stage, Wangu Ziyi had completely pushed his momentum to the peak without any restraint, and air blasted consecutively in the air due to the pressure coming from his body.

“The peak of early Sixth Order Ancient God Realm!”

“What a terrifying pressure, much stronger than the average Seventh Order Ancient God Realm masters!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As Wangu Ziyi completely displayed his strength, there were sparks of white qilin flames dancing in his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong was also surprised at the changes happening to Wangu Ziyi. Wangu Ziyi had actually succeeded in cultivating an ancient physique tempering divine art, the Crystal Beast Body!

There was a period in ancient times when physique tempering divine arts had gained a wave of popularity, resulting in tens of thousands of physique tempering divine arts being created. The Crystal Beast Body was one of the most powerful physique tempering divine arts, ranked within the top one hundred. It had an alarming power, and to top it all off, it was ranked thirteenth!

Thirteen! A ranking that made others’ heart tight with astonishment.

At this time, Huang Xiaolong’s momentum also soared, letting out a reverberating roar. A ferocious aura swept out from his body, resembling a giant beast from the deepest of hell.

Everyone was astounded as they watched the changes happening to Huang Xiaolong’s body; layers of dark golden scales covered his entire body in the blink of an eye. Then sharp pointed spikes grew out from Huang Xiaolong’s knuckles, both of his elbows and knees, glistening in cold lights. His eyes turned deep red that they were almost ink-black, so much so that not a single trace of emotions could be seen in them. The coldness in his eyes made the crowd suck in a breath of cold air.

“This... is this also an ancient physique tempering divine art?!”

“It is said that Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique can transform and evolve, maybe this is his True Dragon Physique’s appearance after transformation?!”

The crowd thought and speculated after seeing Huang Xiaolong’s frightening appearance.

On the Fortune Gate’s viewing stage, Blood Knife Ancestor pondered as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s figure and said, “This is a bloodline’s power.”

Golden Brow Ancestor nodded with a smile and said, “I am really curious, how many secrets does this kid have?”

Bloodline power was rare to begin with, and the people who could actually initiate their bloodline power were not just rare, but scarce. Hence, Wangu Ziyi’s eyes narrowed as he watched the changes in Huang Xiaolong’s body.

A moment later, Huang Xiaolong attacked, exerting his full force as he swung his fist at Wangu Ziyi. Wangu Ziyi snorted with disdain and instead of dodging Huang Xiaolong’s attack, he rushed towards him to launch a counter attack.

R-r-rumble~! Booming thunders shook the whole battle stage.

The two figures retreated at the same time after the collision.

Wangu Ziyi felt his arms go numb from the impact. Disbelief filled his eyes as he looked at Huang Xiaolong—in that exchange, they were equally matched!

‘How is this possible?!’

His body was tempered over the years by numerous chaos spiritual liquids and had countless fortuitous adventures. On top of that, he had also successfully cultivated the ancient Crystal Beast Body divine art. Not to mention, he had broken through to peak early Sixth Order Ancient God Realm master, yet despite all of these accomplishments, he was unable to suppress Huang Xiaolong!

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s True Dragon Physique ranked fourth on the unique physiques list, he was currently just a mid-Fourth Order Ancient God Realm cultivator, which meant that there was a big difference of two whole realms between the both of them!

Wangu Ziyi tried to calm down. He bellowed in anger and his figure disappeared in a blur; this time, he was the one who attacked first.

Huang Xiaolong rushed up to Wangu Ziyi, and the two collided again. Thunderous booms shook the battle stage repeatedly, as if it would never end.

In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged more than a dozen moves.

Their speed had reached a certain threshold, where the peak late-Sixth Order Ancient God Realm masters were barely able to follow their movements, not just that, but even some Seventh Order Ancient God Realm masters could merely catch some afterimages.

Under the impact of Huang Xiaolong and Wangu Ziyi’s battle, the battle stage shook like a withered leaf in a thunderstorm.

Everyone watched dazedly at the intense battle on the stage as waves of shock hit their hearts.

Blood Knife Ancestor had a wry smile on his face, “This kid is so ferocious!”

He hadn’t expected in the slightest for Huang Xiaolong to fight equally with Wangu Ziyi. From the current situation, Wangu Ziyi was not gaining any advantage over Huang Xiaolong.

Expressions of disbelief hung over Golden Brow Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and even Black Ice Ancestor’s face.

Li Lu and Wu Qian’er’s beautiful eyes were wide in astonishment.

The crowd watched with bated breaths. The square was silent, except for the sound of fists hitting flesh.

Wangu Ziyi was astounded at Huang Xiaolong’s strength, like everyone else. In the beginning, they were equally matched, but as time passed, Huang Xiaolong had slowly gaining the upper hand...
