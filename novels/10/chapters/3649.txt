Chapter 3650: You’re Here!

“Lord, the ceremony is about to begin…” Zhu Fei, Cao Dehong, and the others came to make their report.

Opening his eyes slowly, Huang Xiaolong kept the sword manual.

“Let’s go! To the Jian Family!”

“Jian Family!”

As the ceremony was to congratulate Jian Wushuang on breaking through, the venue was naturally set in the main palace of the Jian Family.

Those who received invitations to the ceremony were definitely experts in the God of Creation Realm.

As the old ancestors brought their juniors onto their flying ships and headed for the Jian Family, the skies above the entrance of the Jian Family filled up in an instant!

“Elder Baixuan Tian has arrived!”

An expert of the Jian Family yelled as a massive white colored flying ship tore through the skies.

A commotion broke out in the crowd as experts stopped wherever they were. A huge passage formed along the gates.

“Elder Baixuan Tian has been in seclusion for countless years! She chose to show up this time!”

“Lord Jian Wushuang breaking through the 20 billion units mark is the greatest thing that has happened in our Unknown Lands since a long time ago! It’s nothing odd for Elder Baixuan Tian to come!”

Elder Baixuan Tian had close to 19.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy! Before Jian Wushuang broke through, he stood at the same level as Baixuan Tian and Gui Chi!

There were dozens of experts in the Unknown Lands with 19 billion units of combat strength. Gui Chi, Baixuan Tian, and Jian Wushuang were the most famous of them all.

Under the terrified gazes of those present, The giant white flying ship stopped. The entrance opened and a silver haired grandma walked out. She was clad in pure white robes and she held a wooden staff in her hand. The pupils in her eyes were so small that her eyes seemed completely white.

The ceremony held by the Jian Family was supposed to be festive. Experts who arrived would wear ceremonial robes. Not many people would dare to wear all white as that was usually worn during funerals. Even so, no one dared to say a word about Elder Baixuan Tian’s sense of fashion.

Many experts bowed instinctively when she strolled past.

Behind her were countless beauties also clad in white. All of them were great beauties and they caught the attention of the men of the younger generation.

One of them could shock the world with her beauty, but there was an entire group of them! Their appearance could cause the world to shake.

“It’s our Jian Family’s honor to receive Elder Baixuan Tian!” Jian Weifeng arrived at the entrance of the Jian Family out of nowhere and he cupped his fists to welcome the elder.

Elder Baixuan Tian nodded slightly.

The group was led into the Jian Family by Jian Weifeng personally.

He chuckled happily as they made their way in, “Elder Tian, my father is currently in the main hall with Lord Gui Chi and Lord Mei Jie. That is why I came to welcome Elder Tian. Please do not be offended.”

“Oh? That old freak Gui Chi came?” Elder Baixuan Tian raised an eyebrow slightly.

“Lord Gui Chi arrived two days ago. After all, the Heavenly Peak is about to open soon. Lord Gui Chi plans on having a go at it.” Jian Weifeng explained.

“Time really flies… The Heavenly Peak is about to open again!” Elder Baixuan Tian sighed.

Only after Jian Weifeng and Baixuan Tian disappeared did the experts at the entrance straighten their bodies.

In the crowd, Kong Fanxing, a member of the younger generation of the Kong Family asked Kong Shao, the old ancestor of the Kong Family, “Ancestor, Elder Baixuan Tian looks really friendly and nice. Why is everyone so afraid of her?”

A solemn expression hung on Kong Shao’s face and he explained, “You’re not qualified to discuss anything about Elder Baixuan Tian!”

“Yes… I was wrong!” Kong Fanxing sighed half heartedly.

Seeing as his grandson wasn’t taking his words seriously, Kong Shao continued, “There was a half-step Universe God who started talking behind Elder Baixuan Tian’s back after she left, saying that her eyes were really special. Elder Baixuan Tian heard it and destroyed his physical body completely. She cripplied his dao veins and shattered his dao heart. She even captured his dao soul. It’s said that to this day, his dao soul is being tortured in Elder Baixuan Tian’s cultivation cave.”

The blood drained from Kong Fanxing’s face instantly.

Just as the Kong Family were about to step through the entrance of the Jian Family, a pretty little lady emerged from the entrance. She was extremely cute, and many female disciples of the Jian Family followed closely behind her.

“Second Resurrection Dao Venerable Realm?” Kong Fanxing was shocked.

There was no way a cultivator at her level should be allowed into the ceremony!

Kong Shao seemed to have thought of something and he quickly brought the members of his family to the side. When Kong Fanxing was still confused, Kong Shao’s voice rang the mind of the members of the Kong Family. “If I’m not mistaken, this is Princess Tao Han’er of the Jian Family!”

“What?!”

Princess Tao Han’er managed to catch the eye of Lord Jian Wushuang and she has a high chance of becoming his successor!

Tao Han’er arrived at the entrance of the Jian Family Palace and she stared into the air, as though she was waiting for someone.

Kong Fanxing couldn’t help but gasp, “Is Princess Tao Han’er waiting to welcome someone?! Who’s worthy enough for her to come out personally?”

Kong Shao continued, “She has a foster father and she seems to really admire some guy called the Blue Dragon Young Master. She’s probably waiting for them!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Kong Fanxing felt a sour feeling in his heart after hearing that the princess of the Jian Family admired another man. He couldn’t help but ask, “Who is the Blue Dragon Young Master?”

Glancing at Kong Fanxing from the corner of his eye, Kong Shao snapped, “You better not be comparing yourself to him. Haven’t you heard what happened in the Zhu Family Tea House yesterday?”

Kong Fanxing nodded slowly. He heard bits and pieces of it, but he didn’t get a full idea of what had happened. Could the deaths of the grand elders of the Jian Family have something to do with the Blue Dragon Young Master?

Could it be?!

“Yeah… He killed them.” Kong Shao noticed the expression on his grandson’s face and he continued, “He killed them because they refused to pay several tens of billions…”

“Because of that?!” Kong Fanxing nearly jumped in fright.

“That’s not all. It was said that Jian Weifeng flew into a rage and sent Jian Shengdong over to deal with the matter. Jian Chao and several other experts followed Jian Shengdong and when they got to the tea house…” He stopped abruptly when he noticed the change in Tao Han’er’s expression.

An expression of joy formed on her face as she rushed towards a group of newcomers. “Lord Huang! Father! You’re here!”
