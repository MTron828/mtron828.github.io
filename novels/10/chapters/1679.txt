“Nine Yin Magic Mirror! My Nine Yin Magic Mirror!!!” Shi Ming stood up and yelled in excitement.

Shi Ming hastily called over the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Master, Shi Wushuang over to him.

“Old ancestor, this...” Shi Wushuang looked at the excited expression on Shi Ming’s face and he felt a trace of suspicion in his heart.

He had never seen the old ancestor get so worked up in several million years.

“I felt the presence of the Nine Yin Magic Mirror! It is currently located in Hell!” Shi Ming was unable to suppress the happiness in his heart and a brilliant smile appeared on his face.

“What?! The Nine Yin Magic Mirror has appeared?” Shi Wushuang was stunned for a second. However, a look of pleasant surprise appeared on his face and he became extremely elated. “Old ancestor... Is this true?!”

“Yes. Someone activated the restrictions on the mirror just a second ago!” Shi Ming yelled animatedly. “I can also confirm that the Nine Yin Magic Mirror is located in Hell right now. Luckily for me, that person activated the restrictions in Hell. If he had done it while in the Divine World or some other worlds, it would have been extremely difficult for me to feel it.”

Shi Wushuang paced around and muttered, “Hell... The Nine Yin Magic Mirror is in Hell right now... Old ancestor, are you able to pinpoint its exact position in Hell?”

“That’s not possible. Even though I have some sort of special connection with the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, I can only feel its presence in Hell.”

Shi Wushuang felt his excitement vanish by a whole half.

Hell was boundless and even though they knew that the Nine Yin Magic Mirror was located in Hell, it would be the same as looking for a needle in a haystack.

“From the feedback I received from the mirror, it should be located in the Hell Asura World or the Ghost World.” Shi Ming thought for a moment before coming up with an idea. “Send down my order. I don’t care how you guys do it, but even if you have to flip the Hell Asura World and the Ghost World upside down, I want you to find the Nine Yin Magic Mirror!”

“Yes!” Shi Wushuang replied respectfully. As the patriarch of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, he held extreme respect for the old ancestor.

“Wait!” Right before Shi Wushuang could leave, Shi Ming called him back.

“Old ancestor, this...” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Shi Ming muttered in a cold voice, “There are no walls that can block off all wind. People will definitely realize that we are looking for the Nine Yin Magic Mirror with all the commotion we will cause. I’m afraid everyone in Hell will know that we have noticed the reappearance of the Nine Yin Magic Mirror soon.”

“Old ancestor, what do you mean?”

Shi Ming thought for a moment before coming up with another idea. “Why don’t we just issue a bounty for it. Since all of them will learn about the news anyway, we can borrow the power of all three worlds of Hell to search for the Nine Yin Magic Mirror.”

Shi Wushuang’s eyes twinkled when he heard the idea. “Old ancestor is wise.”

Even if the Massacring Gods Gate or the Fengdu City obtained the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, they would be unable to use it. Since it is merely a piece of useless object to them, they would definitely hand the mirror over to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe for the reward.

“However, how will we set the reward?” Shi Wushuang hesitated for a moment before asking.

“One hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones. One million top-grade grandmist spiritual pills. We will also owe them a favor.” The old ancestor’s eyes twinkled and he said slowly.

One hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones!

One million top-grade grandmist spiritual pills!

A favor from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe!

Even if Shi Wushuang was the patriarch of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, he couldn’t help but feel shocked. However, when he thought about the importance of the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, he felt that no price was too high. He cupped his hands and bowed to Shi Ming, “Yes, I will relay your order at once.”

After a day...

The news about the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe offering a reward for finding the Nine Yin Magic Mirror spread through Hell at an astounding speed.

“What?! The Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s inheritance treasure is located in Hell right now!”

“The Nine Yin Magic Mirror disappeared for billions of years... It had actually reappeared!”

“One hundred million low-grade chaos spirit stones! One million top-grade grandmist spiritual pills! A favor from the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe!”

Hell itself shook from the rewards. Even many of the ancient families that had hidden themselves from the world felt their hearts shaking.

Any single one of the conditions was able to cause experts to go crazy.

In the Heaven Dome Manor, the four Great Commanders quickly learned of the news.

All of them were shocked.

“What’s wrong?” Huang Xiaolong who had stopped messing about with the Nine Yin Magic Mirror turned to look at the stunned expression on the faces of the four of them and he couldn’t hold back his curiosity.

Tai Yue reported everything to Huang Xiaolong.

A frown slowly formed on his face. “It seems like the old ancestor of their tribe managed to guess the location of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Mirror when I started refining it...”

“Master, what do we do now?” Fan Hui asked.

An indifferent smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “It doesn’t matter even if they know.” After a day of refining the treasure, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could refine it completely before the birth of the Holy Mountain.

By then, it wouldn’t matter even if the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe learned that their inheritance treasure was in his hands.

A lightbulb flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind all of a sudden. He turned to the four of them and a crafty smile broke out on his face. “If I use the Nine Yin Magic Mirror to kill Shi Yinyu, what do you think the Nine Yin Old Ancestor will do if he finds out?”

Tai Yue and the others were stunned for a second, and a myriad of expressions appeared on their face.

Just as Hell was thrown into a flurry of activities by the news about the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, more than a month passed.

Three days before the birth of the Holy Mountain, the Nine Yin Magic Mirror floating in mid air in the middle of the Heaven Dome Manor emitted a brilliant glow. The rays of light it emitted was resplendent, to the point of being a little blinding to the eyes. The light was chilly, and it caused one’s heart to palpitate when they looked at it. The ancient markings on it glowed with a peculiar splendor, as though they were about to come alive.

Tai Yue and the others looked at the Demonic Mirror that was glowing and felt a sense of threat. With their current strength, there weren’t too many things that could threaten them, but the Nine Yin Magic Mirror was precisely one of them.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the mirror floating before him, and an expression of joy filled his face. In one month, he had managed to refine a little of the mirror and destroy the connection between the mirror and the old ancestor of the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe. Unless Shi Ming personally went over to kill him, there was no chance for him to gain control over the Nine Yin Magic Mirror.

Reaching out, the Nine Yin Magic Mirror returned to his palm. As Huang Xiaolong held the mirror in his hand, he looked at the fake mountain below him crafted with Stellar Divine Stones. Turning the mirror towards it, a bright green streak flashed through the surface of it. In the next instant, a pile of dust appeared in place of the fake mountain.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction. The Nine Yin Demonic Light possessed terrifying might and nothing seemed to be able to stop it. One should know that the Stellar Divine Stone was one of the hardest minerals in the world.

“The Holy Mountain is about to be born. Song Litao and Shi Yinyu should be heading over to the Nethersea now, right?” Huang Xiaolong turned around and asked Tai Yue.

“Yes, they left around ten days ago.”

“Alright, go make the preparations. We shall be heading to the Nethersea soon!” Huang Xiaolong kept the Nine Yin Magic Mirror and declared the start of the expedition.

“Yes, master!”
