“If the person going up to the stage were you, I would have let you wear the armor too.” Huang Xiaolong firmly stated to Fang Xuanxuan.

Fang Xuanxuan’s angry puffed up cheeks turned red at Huang Xiaolong’s words. She raised her chin up and proudly said, “That’s more like it.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly.

While the shocked crowd stared at the Black Dragon Divine Armor on Peng Xiao’s body on battle stage twelve, Han Qing’s face was twisted in anger. Resentment and greed burned in her eyes. There was greed in her eyes for the Black Dragon Divine Armor, and resentment at why a top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact, like the Black Dragon Divine Armor, would be on Peng Xiao!

Peng Xiao, who was wearing the Black Dragon Divine Armor, was invincible. Even if Wu Yanxi was stronger than he already was, he would still fail to break past the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s defenses. It was clear how powerful the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s defenses were, judging from how it had repelled Wu Yanxi’s attack.

It was as expected of a top-grade grandmist divine armor ah!

Even though the Grandmist Emperor Palace had one, it was their ultimate treasure.

While everyone was astonished and as they stared at Peng Xiao’s Black Dragon Divine Armor with burning greed in their eyes, Peng Xiao yelled and lunged forward. The long sword appeared in her hand, and it slashed at Wu Yanxi.

The powerful Black Dragon Divine Armor boosted her confidence, allowing her to concentrate on attacking,

For a second, criss-crossed sword lights lit up the battle stage. Dragon roars and phoenix cry rumbled in the air.

There was a purple phoenix flying between nine black dragons.

Everyone watched with bated breaths, as they fixed their eyes unblinkingly on Peng Xiao. More accurately, they were staring at her Black Dragon Divine Armor.

There was a scarcity of top-grade grandmist divine armors. Even though the Black Dragon Divine Armor was not graded as a grandmist treasure artifact, it wasn’t far from one.

Standing beside the Heavenly Emperor Di Jun, the Heavenly Prince Di Jing too couldn’t move his gaze away from the Black Dragon Divine Armor. Even though he had the number one unique physique, he was tempted.

When he was inside the Heavenly Court Secret Region, Di Jing had once encountered an Emperor Realm Heavenly Demon imprisoned within a valley. At that time, he had wanted to enter the valley to kill the Heavenly Demon, but he had hesitated. Even though he had the number one Heaven’s Dao Physique, his opponent was an Emperor Realm Heavenly Demon after all. No doubt, he would have suffered heavy injuries battling against an Emperor Realm Heavenly Demon.

Therefore, he had given up on the idea in the end and had not entered the valley.

Things would have significantly been different if he had the Black Dragon Divine Armor.

With the Black Dragon Divine Armor to support his Heaven’s Dao Physique, he wouldn’t even need to worry about being injured by the Emperor Realm Heavenly Demon.

The Heavenly Prince Di Jing sucked in a breath of cold air, his eyes flickering with unknown thoughts.

Black Dragon Divine Armor!

Di Jing clenched his fists tightly.

As everyone watched the ongoing battles, an hour soon passed. Relying on the Black Dragon Divine Armor’s sturdy protection, Peng Xiao defeated the Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Wu Yanxi by sending him out of the battle stage.

Eyes followed Peng Xiao as she walked back to zone sixty-one.

“Thank you.” Peng Xiao thanked Huang Xiaolong with a bright smile when she was back at his side.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Peng Xiao’s exhausted face and shook his head. Without a word, he took out a Great Brahma Sarira Pill and had Peng Xiao swallow it.

After taking the Great Brahma Sarira Pill, Peng Xiao’s pallid complexion looked better. Even though she had the Black Dragon Divine Armor, she had consumed a lot of godforce to defeat Wu Yanxi.

However, after winning against Wu Yanxi, she had successfully made it into the top five thousand.

As long as she could win another match, she would enter into the top three thousand rankings!

Peng Xiao’s goal was to make it into the top three thousand in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. Therefore, she needed to win the next match.

......

Several hours later, an extremely pale Peng Xiao stepped off the battle stage.

She had won a place in the top three thousand rankings. However, in the qualifying match for the top five hundred, her opponent was a peak mid-Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Fiend God Emperor Palace’s disciple. She lost this match in the end, as she was thrown off the battle stage.

Fang Xuanxuan hurried to Peng Xiao’s side and put her arm around her to lend her some support. “Xiaoxiao, are you alright?”

Peng Xiao squeezed a smile on her pale face and reassured her, “I’m alright.”

Although she had lost the match, she was satisfied by entering the top three thousand rankings. Despite being a supreme godhead genius, her cultivation time was shorter than the majority of participants. It was an outstanding achievement to enter into the top three thousand rankings with just peak late-Tenth Order God King Realm cultivation.

The matches on the battle stages continued, so did the whispers and gossips in the spectating crowd.

In the end, it came down to ninety disciples. Counting Huang Xiaolong and the rest of the preliminary round’s top ten disciples, the semi-finals’ top one hundred disciples were determined.

Disciples from the top ten Emperor Palaces and hidden ancient forces, like the Purple Flames Sword Sect, dominated the top one hundred rankings.

Then again, there were the occasional surprises like Huang Xiaolong, and the True Divinity Sect’s Long Shaozhen, for instance.

Other than Huang Xiaolong and Long Shaozhen, several disciples from the lower-ranking Emperor Palaces’ had managed to enter the top one hundred.

Of course, had Gudu Canyang survived the preliminary round instead of being killed off by Huang Xiaolong, he too could have entered the top one hundred rankings.

“Now, may I have the top one hundred participants here to draw a lot?” The Heavenly Court’s Marshal Yu Shi shouted as he stood on the high stage.

Huang Xiaolong stepped forward.

It was finally starting!

The moment he had been waiting for has finally arrived.

Just as Huang Xiaolong stepped forward, the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong and Grandmist Emperor Palace’s Li Junhua also stepped forward. They went up to the high stage with Huang Xiaolong to draw a lot.

The Heavenly Prince Di Jing and two other princes, who had also entered into the top one hundred, also stood up.

As the top one hundred disciples went up to the high stage, streams of invisible energy collided loudly in the air.

Many of the crowd were paying attention to the Heavenly Prince Di Jing, Huang Xiaolong, Lan Tailong, Li Junhua, and Long Shaozhen.

“Who’s going to be the Heavenly Prince Di Jing and Huang Xiaolong’s first opponent? It would be exciting if they drew the same number!”

“That would be such a thrill! No one had ever seen the Heavenly Prince Di Jing battle. This is the battle the entire universe wanted to see the most. Moreover, Huang Xiaolong was the preliminary round’s champion. This made everyone believe that the battle between Huang Xiaolong and the Heavenly Prince Di Jing would be an epic showdown!”

“Huang Xiaolong has merely gotten first place in the preliminary round. There is nothing more to him than that which could compare him to the Heavenly Prince Di Jing. I’ll say it first that Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to take one strike from the Heavenly Prince Di Jing on the battle stage!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“In this one month, the whole Divine World had talked about Huang Xiaolong. Even the other four great worlds’ top experts were paying attention to Huang Xiaolong, and many of them looked favorably upon him. Some even thought that Huang Xiaolong could become the pinnacle of existence in the future, surpassing Emperor Realm. But, if he were to lose his life on the battle stage, slapped to death by Heavenly Prince Di Jing, then that would be the funniest joke ever!”

While the crowd was discussing excitedly, Huang Xiaolong had drawn a number.

Number six!

“Huang Xiaolong has got number six. I wonder who has gotten the other number six?!” Everyone craned their necks, looking around.

Right at this time, the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong flipped over his participation token number, and an eye-catching ‘6’ appeared in plain view.

“It’s the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple! The Brightness Emperor’s Disciple has the number six!”

Someone hollered. As his voice rang through the plaza, the crowd stirred in excited anticipation.

Even though Huang Xiaolong’s first opponent in his first match was not the Heavenly Prince Di Jing, the fight between him and the Brightness Emperor’s Disciple Lan Tailong was enough to drive the crowd into a frenzy.

In everyone’s eyes, this was going to be an exciting and intense battle!
