Chapter 2967: Making An Enemy Out of the World

As a mid-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable expert, how fast was Yan Bubi’s speed? He could traverse ten thousand planets in a single step if he wanted to. He arrived on the streets in a split second, and when he did, he saw Huang Xiaolong crushing the last piece of Kong Ling’s skull bones! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Kong Ling’s shrieks of pain and Chen Lixing’s anguished screams from being roasted by absolute blaze power sent Yan Bubi amok. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re dead!”

In the next second, he slashed at Huang Xiaolong, regardless of the consequences.

His sword shattered the void as sword light bloomed in ten million rays of metallic light. It felt as if everything in the world would be split into two by this sword, and at this moment, the experts in Dragon Fish City had the vague feeling that they were about to be separated into two halves. Experts closest to Huang Xiaolong felt like they were on the verge of hell!

It was like judging life and death with one sword, cutting off all vitality around Huang Xiaolong!

This was the essence of Sword Venerable’s life and death sword dao!

Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and the others’ looked solemn upon arriving on the scene at this sight.

But looking at the world-splitting momentum that seemingly could split the world and everything in it into two, Huang Xiaolong merely raised his hand and casually flicked his finger at the air. The mighty sword slashes with overwhelming momentum shattered into smithereens in a split second, and Yan Bubi himself reeled backward in a sorry manner for several hundred steps.

“What?!!” Li Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and experts on the scene were beyond shocked.

Yan Bubi, who had mastered the essence of Sword Venerable’s invincible sword dao, slashed out the momentum of overpowering all-beings sword attack, deterring even the likes of Liu Ran and Qiu Ruopeng, and he actually crumbled in an instant from the flick of Huang Xiaolong’s finger. He even sent Yan Bubi reeling backward uncontrollably?!

Huang Xiaolong completed his work on King Long’s last piece of skull bone and dragged out Kong Ling’s dao soul. With another flick of his finger, the power of absolute blaze wrapped around Kong Ling’s dao soul.

As Huang Xiaolong was about to start roasting Kong Ling’s dao soul, Yan Bubi pointed the tip of his azure, long sword at Huang Xiaolong and threatened, “Huang Xiaolong, if you dare to injure my junior brothers again, I will cut you down!”

Huang Xiaolong merely raised his eyelids slightly as his power of absolute blaze finished enveloping Kong Ling’s dao soul, and immediately, Kong Ling’s miserable shrieks reverberated in the air.

Yan Bubi’s face darkened, looking ugly to the extreme.

Then, Huang Xiaolong sent out a wisp of nirvana flame onto Kong Ling and Chen Lixing’s dao souls.

Huang Xiaolong’s nirvana flame had reached major completion, and it was definitely more lethal in comparison to his absolute blaze power. Thus, when the nirvana flame was added around Kong Ling and Chen Lixing’s dao souls, the screaming intensified, raising goosebumps down Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, and other experts’ necks.

Monstrous killing intent exploded in Yan Bubi’s eyes after seeing this. He took large strides towards Huang Xiaolong, and with every step he took, the sword qi surging from his body rose higher. It was like a violent geyser that rose higher and higher, and condensed into a life and death world boundary. The life and death world boundary spun, where half was the world of life, and the other was the world of death.

In this life and death world boundary, Yan Bubi was god, the ruler of life, but in the next second, he was the ruler of death.

“Huang Xiaolong, no one can save you today!” Yan Bubi’s words came through gritted teeth, as his gaze turned frosty and malevolent, “That was merely the first move in the Life and Death Sword Dao, and the weakest attack. Next, I will use the tenth move, the strongest attack in the Life and Death Sword Dao to destroy your body. Then, I will imprison your dao soul, and let you taste pain ten thousand times worse!”

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze remained tepid looking at the surging life and death sword qi around Yan Bubi, and he turned his attention towards the thirty-plus people who had arrived not long ago, “You all are disciples of Poison Bodach, Nine-headed Tree Demon, Stonemen Race, Inferno Race, Darkness Demon Creed, and Devouring Sun Creed? Make you move together, and save me the trouble to deal with all of you one by one!”

The Stonemen Race, Inferno Race, Darkness Demon Creed, and Devouring Sun Creed had exerted great effort in Cangqiong Land’s destruction.

Yan Bubi’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t give him a direct look since he had arrived. Moreover, the words Huang Xiaolong had just spoken meant that he, Yan Bubi, was no match against Huang Xiaolong, and that he would need to cooperate with Poison Bodach’s disciple Liu Ran, and the others to capture Huang Xiaolong.

Liu Ran, Qiu Ruopeng, Peng Xuan, and the rest of the thirty-plus disciples didn’t look happy either.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re overestimating yourself too much.” A peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable beside Qiu Ruopeng retorted in anger, “Brother Yan Bubi alone is more than enough to deal with you, and it’s not necessary for him to join hands with us!”

“Is that so?” Then Huang Xiaolong’s swift punch sent the peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable flying, and his flesh turned black, emitting a nauseating, foul stench when he crashed onto the street.

Faces went pallid at the sight.

“Absolute poison power!” Liu Ran exclaimed in a shaking voice.

As Poison Bodach’s personal disciple, who practiced the art of poisons, how could Liu Ran not recognize the power of absolute poison? He had long heard that Huang Xiaolong wielded the power of absolute poison, but he had never believed in that, until he witnessed it with his own eyes now.

He really couldn’t understand how the h*ll Huang Xiaolong had cultivated the power of absolute poison? His master, Poison Bodach, was born during the genesis era, and in all these years, he had refined numerous items of poison attributes, cultivating inside poison pools, suffering inhumane tortures to comprehend the power of absolute poison. But it was said that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation journey did not exceed ten thousand years!

Yan Bubi’s heart palpitated looking at the rotting body of the peak late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable expert. This person was called Chen Hao, and he had a dao physique in the top twenty ranks. Chen Hao was someone who focused on tempering his dao physique, yet he failed to resist the power of Huang Xiaolong’s absolute poison!

On top of that, Chen Hao’s body was corroded almost instantly!

Qiu Ruopeng pressed down the great waves of shock in his heart, and looked at Huang Xiaolong icily. “Huang Xiaolong, do you know that he’s the Stonemen Race Patriarch’s personal disciple? Are you going to make an enemy out of the world?”

“Making an enemy out of the world?” Huang Xiaolong laughed like he was hearing a funny joke. He, the Son of Creation, was being labeled as making an enemy out of the world?

While Qiu Ruopeng’s face turned uglier, Huang Xiaolong snorted, “You’ve overestimated yourselves. In my eyes, all of you are ants. Can mere ants represent the world? Then again, even if I make an enemy out of the world, so what?”

Huang Xiaolong’s reply reverberated throughout the Dragon Fish City, and his words made the high-level Dao Venerable experts who coveted the Tree of Beginning frown.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re arrogant and impertinent!” Qiu Ruopeng was enraged. He turned to Liu Ran, Yan Bubi, and the others, “Brothers, we will join hands today to eradicate Huang Xiaolong. If such a scourge is not killed, he would bring endless calamities to the world!”

His tone and words were righteous, as if they were obliged to eliminate a sinner of the Huang Long World for the benefits of all-living beings.

Liu Ran and the others exchanged a glance and nodded their heads. Yan Bubi also nodded in agreement in the end. Huang Xiaolong’s power of absolute poison had truly given him a fright.

“KILL!” Liu Ran bellowed, and thirty-plus people attacked simultaneously.

The weakest one among them was still a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable. Not to mention that there were several Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable experts within their ranks. Though Liu Ran, and Qiu Ruopeng were not Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable experts, their battle prowess was more than comparable to Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable Realm experts. The sky above Dragon Fish City, and the entire sacred land, darkened. Monstrous power of poison, Life and Death Sword Dao, tree vines, and other energies rose like great pillars propping up the sky, a sea of blade intent surged below, and mountain-sized fist imprints, all bombarded onto Huang Xiaolong.
