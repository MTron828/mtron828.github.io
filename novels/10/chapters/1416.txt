One day went by in the blink of an eye, and a new day was welcomed by a chilly morning.

However, the Esteemed Buddha City’s streets were crowded with pedestrians moving towards the auction house located at the city center.

In order to prevent unexpected delays along the way, Huang Xiaolong and his group had set off early for the auction house.

However, when Huang Xiaolong stepped out of his residence, he saw a group of Fortune Gate’s disciples standing in front of the residence from across the street. Both Liang Ming and Wang Wei were part of that group. Wang Wei was standing behind a stalwart middle-aged man. This middle-aged man had icy-blue eyes, and was exuding a coldness and almost negligible breathing.

Blue Empyrean?! The name flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s mind as his eyes narrowed.

Although he had never seen Blue Empyrean in person, Huang Xiaolong was certain that this person was Blue Empyrean, based on Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor’s descriptions.

Standing beside Blue Empyrean was a short middle-aged man. He was just a little over 1.5 meters, but his limbs were thick and muscular. As they stood next to each other, the contrast between them was even more obvious.

The more Huang Xiaolong looked, the funnier he felt, and the more he wanted to laugh.

As Huang Xiaolong stepped out of his residence, Liang Ming immediately stepped forward, and said to the short middle-aged man, “Master, it’s that kid!” He pointed at Huang Xiaolong with a hostile and hateful gaze.

The short middle-aged man was none other than Liang Ming’s Master, one of the Royal Buddha World’s Fortune Gate branch’s Grand Elders, Chen Zhifa.

Chen Zhifa looked fixedly at Huang Xiaolong. He then turned and said to Blue Empyrean, “Junior Brother Blue Empyrean, this kid is your Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch’s disciple. Are you going to handle this matter or you want me to do it?”

Blue Empyrean replied matter-of-factly, “Since it’s my Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch’s disciple, I will handle this matter.”

Chen Zhifa nodded his head and remained silent.

Blue Empyrean’s gaze once again fell back on Huang Xiaolong and said, “So, you’re Golden Brow and Blood Knife’s disciple, Huang Xiaolong? Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch’s All-Islands Great War champion?”

Huang Xiaolong said instead of answering, “If there is nothing important to discuss, I need to rush to attend an auction.”

Blue Empyrean, Wang Wei, and other Fortune Gate’s disciples were taken aback by Huang Xiaolong’s attitude. Blue Empyrean’s face turned sullen in an instant. Disregard... this was naked disregard! He was one of the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate’s branch’s Ancestors, but was actually disregarded by a junior like Huang Xiaolong!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong had done it in front of the Royal Buddha World’s Fortune Gate branch’s disciples and Grand Elder!

Blue Empyrean’s eyes narrowed dangerously, and an icy glint flickered in the depths of his eyes.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re being presumptuous!” Wang Wei shouted and pointed his finger at Huang Xiaolong as he was beyond enraged. “Do you know that this is my Master? How dare a measly disciple like you be so presumptuous in front of my Master!”

Wang Wei was extremely agitated as if Huang Xiaolong had committed an unpardonable crime.

Huang Xiaolong remained indifferent as he ‘exclaimed’, “Oh, he’s your Master ah. Excuse me, I have never seen him before, so I didn’t know it was him. You have one minute to state your business, if there’s nothing important please move out of my way, I need to get to the auction house.”

This auction was very important for Huang Xiaolong.

If he did miss this auction, who knows when he would come across another auction with God King’s Buddha Pellet. Not to mention, he was keen on the God King’s Buddha Paste for using it to improve his strength.

At this time, Chen Zhifa interjected with a snicker. “Kid, it seems you still haven’t understood your current situation. Since a mere Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch’s disciple has dared to disregard an Ancestor of his own branch, I’m genuinely curious to know if you’re reckless, naive, or you have something up your sleeve?” His gaze swept over Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and others standing behind Huang Xiaolong as he continued, “Are they your backing?” He snickered mockingly, then added, “Don’t tell me all of them are God King Realm masters?!”

Liang Ming and the rest of the Fortune Gate’s disciples laughed loudly in ridicule.

In their eyes, it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong, a Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch’s insignificant disciple to have God King Realm masters as his subordinates!

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Chen Zhifa and Liang Ming before saying to Xiang Xun and the rest behind him, “Let’s go.”

“Go?” A cruel light flickered across Blue Empyrean’s eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, even if you’re Golden Brow and Blood Knife’s disciple, you’re just a disciple, how dare you rebel against your elder? I’m going to abolish your cultivation as a lesson, even if Golden Brow and Blood Knife find out about this later, they won’t have anything to say about this.” With that said, he reached out to grab Huang Xiaolong.

In this simple movement, there were ten thousand streams of vigorous qi shooting out towards Huang Xiaolong with bone-piercing momentum. It was obvious that if Blue Empyrean were to really grab Huang Xiaolong, his bones would be crushed to pieces.

A dark, malicious gleam shone in Blue Empyrean’s eyes as he watched Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong was that close to being grabbed by Blue Empyrean’s hand, when a cold harrumph sounded in everyone’s ears. Then, a giant claw imprint cut across space, shattering the Blue Empyrean’s claw force and striking Blue Empyrean.

Blue Empyrean was taken aback. His confident expression turned fearful as he sensed the overwhelming force targeting him. Just as he was about to dodge it, the giant claw imprint landed on his body.

Rumble~!

A resounding boom shook the street.

Wang Wei, Liang Ming, Chen Zhifa, and the others could see a pit made by a giant claw, right where Blue Empyrean had stood. The claw print pit was more than ten meters deep and Blue Empyrean’s body was sprawled at the bottom of it.

The one who had acted to shield Huang Xiaolong wasn’t Xiang Xun, nor was it Xu Baisheng, instead, it was Xu Yong.

Xu Yong was a Third Order God King Realm, therefore, it was very easy for him to deal with Blue Empyrean who had just broken through to God King Realm.

Xu Yong had healed from his heavy injuries, and his strength had also significantly risen from the time he was being attacked by the Four Emperor Palaces’ experts.

Xu Baisheng raised a leg and stomped hard into the pit where Blue Empyrean was lying and everyone heard a shattering sound coming from under Xu Baisheng’s claw.

Wang Wei watched with a pale face while Xu Baisheng turned to Xu Yong and said, “As you follow by Master’s side, attacks must be swift and ruthless. Don’t leave any loose ends; at the very least, opponents must be crippled!”

Attacks must be ruthless!

Xu Yong’s earlier attack had not abolished Blue Empyrean’s strength, thus Xu Baisheng had taken this opportunity to educate Xu Yong and the other two juniors as he added a kick to Blue Empyrean.

Xu Yong lowered his head, as he had made a note of this lesson, and answered, “Yes, Granduncle!”

Granduncle! Master!

Liang Ming and Wang Wei stared at Huang Xiaolong with fear and horror, so did Chen Zhifa.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze swept across Liang Ming, Wang Wei, and Chen Zhifa’s faces. He finally looked at Wang Wei as he said slowly, “I gave you a chance the last time, pity that you didn’t appreciate it.”

Wang Wei was suffused with terror, feeling Huang Xiaolong’s glance on him. He was tongue-tied, but managed to blurt out a broken sentence, “Jun-Junior brother Huang, no, no, Senior Brother Huang, spare me.”

However, he didn’t get to finish his words. Huang Xiaolong’s fist greeted Wang Wei’s chest, sending him flying and crashing in the distance. Wang Wei’s vitality was barely noticeable before hitting the ground.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his fist then looked at Liang Ming, Chen Zhifa, and the rest of the Fortune Gate’s disciples.

At Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, Liang Ming and Chen Zhifa stepped back subconsciously. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Can I go to the auction now?” Huang Xiaolong asked coldly.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Chen Zhifa squeezed a smile that looked uglier than crying.

“Come on.” Huang Xiaolong said to Xiang Xun and the rest. He leaped onto the little cow’s back and the group walked away.

Chen Zhifa and Liang Ming exhaled in relief only after Huang Xiaolong’s group went out of their sight at the end of the street; their backs were dampened with cold sweat.
