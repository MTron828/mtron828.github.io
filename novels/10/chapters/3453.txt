Chapter 3454: That Huang B*stard

Chen Chao and the others didn’t manage to meet Shi Potian. They only met with Shi Potian’s disciple. After all, Chen Chao and the others weren’t important enough to meet with Shi Potian directly. Even so, they were ecstatic to meet with his disciple.

When they met Shi Potian’s second disciple, Tang Yu, they were even happier. After all, he was the most talented disciple among the rest. He was also the strongest among them. He comprehended seven elements to the grand competition stage.

Chen Chao and the others handed over more than a hundred million dao coins and various precious herbs before speaking about the matter with Huang Xiaolong.

Tang Yu waved his hand casually when he heard the story. “Relax. I’ll deal with the Huang b*stard for you. However, I want the Myriad Star Cup after it’s done.”

The faces of Chen Chao and the others changed.

The Myriad Star Cup was the most important piece of treasure in the Myriad Star Palace. After all, it was used to gather the power of starlight, powering the grand formation of the Myriad Star Palace. Without the Myriad Star Cup, the future of the Myriad Star Palace could only be imagined.

“Lord Tang Yu, this… The Myriad Star Cup is the most important treasure in our faction…”

Tang Yu snorted in annoyance, “If it wasn’t an important treasure, why would I want it?”

Chen Chao and the others didn’t dare to refute him.

“Go back and think about it. Is the Myriad Star Cup more important, or is the position of the Myriad Star Palace Master better?”

As Chen Chao’s expression sank, he looked at the various eminent elders who came along with him.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Alright. If Lord Tang Yu can deal with him and allow me to obtain the position of palace master, we are willing to hand over the Myriad Star Cup!” Chen Chao growled after a short moment.

Tang Yu grinned in response. “You will definitely thank yourself for making this decision in the future. Let’s drink! Tomorrow, I’ll head over to the Myriad Star Palace with you!”

“Many thanks to Lord Tang Yu!”

Chen Chao and the others bowed respectfully.

The next day, Tang Yu brought along dozens of experts from the Heaven Breaking Gate and went towards the Myriad Star Palace.

All the experts he brought with him were powerhouses in the Breaking Heaven Palace. They were loyal to Tang Yu, and he wasn’t afraid that they would leak the news.

“Get your men to keep an eye on that kid. Don’t allow him to escape,” Tang Yu instructed. “If he manages to get away, I won’t be held responsible. You’ll still have to give me my reward.”

“Lord Tang Yu, you can rest assured. I’ve long since gotten my men to watch the kid. In the past few days, they’ve been strolling about the Myriad Star Palace. They seem pretty carefree.”

“In a few days, he’ll be dead.” Tang Yu chuckled.

Chen Chao and the others roared with laughter.

Indeed, Huang Xiaolong and the others were really enjoying life in the Myriad Star Palace. At night, Huang Xiaolong would revolve the Pangu World Creation Art in order to devour the universe-level spiritual vein. During the day, he would tour the place with Long Yi and Gu Yuan.

He decided to leave the Myriad Star Palace after refining the spiritual vein.

However, he didn’t remain idle while doing so. He sent out more than a thousand dragonian beasts he subdued to look for information on universe-level spiritual veins and creation-level herbs.

He only left ten of the strongest ones by his side in case he needed to deal with any trouble that he was too lazy to handle.

There were times when Huang Xiaolong would suppress his strength to fight with Gu Yuan and Long Yi. Despite that, they weren’t his match.

Even though they were beaten every time, they learned a lot after sparring with Huang Xiaolong.

It was especially so when Huang Xiaolong taught them the way of the dao. Their understanding of how to reach the God of Creation Realm became deeper.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong was discussing the dao with the two when Li Wei barged into his palace. She didn’t care that she was interrupting them, and she yelled hastily, “Your Highness, Chen Chao and the others left for the Heaven Breaking Gate several days ago! Right now, they’re back with a ton of experts!”

Long Yi chuckled, “Did that brat, Shi Potian, come with them?”

Li Wei shook her head. “No… His second disciple, Tang Yu, is here.” Afraid that Huang Xiaolong and the others wouldn’t take it seriously, she continued, “He’s the most talented among all the disciples, and he comprehended seven elements to the grand completion stage! He came along with a group of experts from the Heaven Breaking Gate, and there are several of them stronger than himself!”

She knew that Huang Xiaolong was strong enough to force a grand marshal of the Northern Court Celestial Empire back, but she still panicked when she heard that Tang Yu was here with eminent elders of the Heaven Breaking Gate.

After all, the Heaven Breaking Gate was too famous in the area.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Even if Shi Potian came, Long Yi will be able to deal with it. Relax.”

Li Wei looked at Long Yi in shock. She couldn’t believe that a mere follower would be able to defeat the Heaven Breaking Patriarch. After all, Shi Potian was the strongest person in the region! He comprehended ten elements to the grand completion stage!

If Long Yi could read her mind, he would probably smash his head into the wall to kill himself.

“That person you call Tang Yu has already arrived.” Huang Xiaolong discovered them in an instant.

“Let’s go take a look at the experts from the Heaven Breaking Gate.” Huang Xiaolong laughed.

Gu Yuan smiled, “We will deal with them for Your Highness…” After he spoke, he turned to stare at Long Yi.

In the past few days, they had been bullied badly by Huang Xiaolong. They had long since wanted to vent their frustration on someone else.

Now, Tang Yu had conveniently delivered himself over to them.

The three of them headed straight for Tang Yu’s group.

When Chen Chao and the others saw Huang Xiaolong’s appearance, their eyes lit up. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong and said, “Lord Tang Yu, that’s them! He’s the person we’re talking about, and those are his subordinates!”

“His subordinate is pretty strong. He’s an expert who comprehended six elements to the perfection level!” Chen Chao continued.

“Six? Not bad…” Tang Yu sneered in response.

He loved to battle experts who were slightly weaker than him. It wouldn’t be fun to bully those who couldn’t fight back, and he couldn’t bully anyone stronger than him. As such, he loved looking for people slightly weaker than himself in order to show off his strength.
