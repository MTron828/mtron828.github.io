Four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors!

Some of the ancestors from the top superpowers who had come to offer their blessings were shocked and they nearly peed their pants.

They weren’t ordinary Tenth Order Emperors! They were not even ordinary high-level Emperors! They were four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors!

Even though Emperor Realm experts weren’t too rare in the world, there were extremely little Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts. There was no need to mention peak late-Tenth Order Emperors. Even a superpower like the Asura Gate didn’t have one.

However, four of them had appeared before them all of a sudden!

What was even more unbelievable was that the four of them were actually following the orders of a Heavenly Monarch!

All four of them addressed him as ‘master’!

Even the faces of Huang Peng, Chu Yunnan, and the rest of the people from Asura Gate changed greatly.

They didn’t expect that Fan Hui, Jin Yuan and Wan Yutian would all be peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts!

Huang Peng’s started regretting on the inside. If he knew that this was going to happen, he wouldn’t have acted so stubborn earlier on!

The combined strength of four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors were more than enough to sweep through any of the superpowers in the Hell Asura World.

Moreover, the Lifeless Sect ranked thirteenth among the superpowers of the Hell Asura World and they had the same battle prowess as the Asura Gate. The only reason the Asura Gate could keep their rankings in the top ten was because of the Divine Tree of Darkness. Without the divine tree, their actual strength would be weaker than the Lifeless Sect.

When he thought of the Divine Tree of Darkness, Huang Peng felt more at ease.

So what if they had four peak late-Tenth Order Emperors on their side? They still had the protection of the Divine Tree of Darkness, why should they be afraid?!

Huang Peng suddenly let out a shriek and shocked the entire world.

“Everyone focus on the Asura Reincarnation Array, we can definitely suppress the four of them!” Huang Peng encouraged.

“That’s right, we have forty four people, and we have even activated the Asura Reincarnation Array, we can definitely suppress them!” Jia Ding roared, “Those who go against our Asura Gate, must die!”

“Kill!”

The other ancestors roared and urged all of their remaining godforce into the array. Dazzling rays of light burst out from the array and a kind of bloody, brutal, and cold aura spread out to the surrounding mountains. The surrounding cities were slowly affected, and eventually, the entire continent was covered by the power of the array.

With the strength of the Asura Reincarnation Array and forty four Emperors, an entire continent would be extinguished in the blink of an eye. As long as they willed it, even a supercontinent would be smashed to bits.

Under the pressure of forty four people, the mountain started to crack and sink into the ground.

Even though the entire mountain was piled with restrictions by the Asura Gate, it couldn’t handle the pressure of the battle happening on it.

The faces of Xu Junhua, Deng Fei, and the rest of them changed drastically. All of them grabbed their disciples and beat a hasty retreat. As for the other superpowers like the Dragon Lion Sect and the Heavenly Wind Pavilion, the ancestors didn’t bother waiting around as all of them grabbed their disciples and fled.

Huang Xiaolong, Ren Wokuang, and Wang Mengqin retreated even further away from the battle.

The four Grand Commanders were wrapped up in brilliant rays of light and a storm swept through the hearts of everyone observing the battle.

Even though the pressure coming from the forty four Emperors of the Asura Gate was extremely strong, they were still unable to touch Tai Yue and the others.

The four of them stood high in the sky, and the feeling they gave off made the hearts of everyone present palpitate. They didn’t struggle in the slightest and they looked to be as stable as a massive mountain as they stared at the Emperors surrounding them.

Tai Yue roared with laughter, “Old Jin, how long has it been since the four of us fought together?”

“Haha, let us enjoy ourselves to the fullest!” Jin Yuan couldn’t help but smile.

“This Asura Reincarnation Array powered by these forty four Emperors should be quite a good warm up for what’s about to come next!” Fan Hui grinned.

Facing the full powered attack from the Asura Gate, the four of them were laughing and joking with each other. It was obvious that they didn’t take the whole thing seriously at all.

The faces of Huang Peng and the ancestors from Asura Gate sank when they saw the scene below them.

“Stop boasting!” Huang Peng snorted coldly and shouted, “Asura Hell!”

The forty four of them circulated the Asura Reincarnation Array and miniature versions of hell congealed before Tai Yue and the rest before charging towards them.

Even an ordinary late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert would be seriously injured if they were struck by the attack.

Seeing that the battle has already begun, Tai Yue chuckled. “Eternal Fist!” Together with Wan Yuntian, they sent punches flying.

The moment their fists shot forward, the void around them shattered and time seemed to flow backwards.

The attack from the Asura Gate turned into bubbles as they popped at the slightest graze of Tai Yue and Wan Yuntian’s punches.

Despite successfully destroying the attack, the punches didn’t stop there. It charged towards all of the experts in the Asura Gate who were trying to maintain the array.

Boom! Boom!

Sounds of explosions resounded unceasingly through the air.

The burst of light seemed to illuminate the entire Divine Darkness Plane and everyone, regardless of cultivation level, were blinded by the bright light.

Some of the core disciples from the other superpowers who had already fled far away even started to spurt mouthfuls of blood.

As though the explosion had happened inside their body, all of them felt badly shaken and some of them even suffered from serious internal injuries.

Everyone was horrified by the power of that blast.

Just with the two of them, they were actually able to resist the first blow from the Asura Reincarnation Array!

"Three worlds of Hell, an army of ten thousand, kill!"

Huang Peng yelled out once again after he regained his focus on the battle.

All forty four of them stretched their hands out towards the center of the array and poured all the remaining godforce they had in their bodies into it. As though they had ripped apart the gates of the three worlds of hell, asuras, devils, spirits, corpses, and even hell beasts poured out of the array as they charged towards Tai Yue and the others with frenzy.

The majority of them were late staged Heavenly Monarchs and some of them were even in the Emperor Realm! There were even some at the middle stages of the Emperor Realm!

When Jin Yuan and Fan Hui saw the second wave of attacks coming at them, their figures flashed and they exchanged places with Tai Yue and Wan Yuntian.

The two kings took action and their fists shot out towards the center of the array.

Their fists split open the void and turned into two huge heavenly rivers. The rivers surged forward with unstoppable momentum and swept away everything in its way. Even the middle staged Emperor Realm beasts were wiped out. There were no exceptions.
