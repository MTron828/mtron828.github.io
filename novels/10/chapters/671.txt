Although the energy contained inside a Buddha śarīra was less than a godhead, it was many times better than those Highgod Realm beast cores that Huang Xiaolong had previously refined.

A Buddhist cultivator was known as a Buddha after they broke through to Highgod Realm. This Buddha śarīra only formed inside a Buddhist cultivator after they successfully entered to Highgod Realm, it was condensed completely from a Buddha’s blood essence, suffused with Buddhism aura and energy.

No doubt, if Huang Xiaolong refined this Buddha śarīra, it would bring crucial benefits to his current strength enhancement as well as his future cultivation.

The Ascending Moon Old Man was initially worried that the Buddha śarīra might reject Huang Xiaolong. In this case, Huang Xiaolong would have a difficult time refining it. Fortunately, watching the Buddha śarīra’s reaction, it did not seem to reject Huang Xiaolong’s presence, which was a relief for the old man.

“Old man, you’re injured, why don’t you use this Buddha śarīra instead?” Huang Xiaolong retrieved his gaze from the Buddha śarīra in his palm, and said, looking at the Ascending Moon Old Man.

Who knew that the old man’s temper would immediately erupt, “What fart! Who said I’m injured? What fart injuries are these? This kind of injuries need to use a Buddha śarīra to heal? Sissy fudge, do you kid know how difficult it was for your Master to get this Buddha śarīra? This old man took a big risk gambling his life! How dare you not want it!”

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s eyes were wide in anger, even his scraggly beard was standing on ends as he pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong. Spit flew in all directions. Luckily, Huang Xiaolong was standing more than a meter away, otherwise that deadly saliva would have covered him from head to toe. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As usual, Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless facing the old man.

Why was this old man being so dramatic, wasn’t this just a Buddha śarīra? Then again, watching the Ascending Moon Old Man’s exaggerated angry face, a warm feeling spread in his heart. Huang Xiaolong understood that the old man was reluctant to use the Buddha śarīra on himself because of him.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly smiled, cutting the old man off, “Fine, old man, I’ll listen to you and use this Buddha śarīra. Are you satisfied now?”

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s enraged rant halted. However, as if it wasn’t enough, he scolded a few more words before finally stopping.

“Forget it, this old man will toil a little more for you. Now, sit down, I will use godforce to help you refine this Buddha śarīra.” In the end, the Ascending Moon Old Man changed his tone.

Huang Xiaolong blanked for a moment.

“This, Master, it isn’t necessary. I can refine this myself.” Huang Xiaolong blurted out in a rush.

This old man was already wounded because of this Buddha śarīra, and now he wanted to use his godforce to help him refine its energy. If this somehow aggravated the old man’s injuries further, Huang Xiaolong would not feel comfortable.

But the Ascending Moon Old Man’s eyes widened and stared at Huang Xiaolong, “If I tell you to sit down, you sit down, where does all this nonsense come from? Quickly, if not, I’ll throw this Buddha śarīra all the way to your grandmother’s house!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled wryly, then the corners of his mouth flattened: This old man!

He didn’t believe that the old man could throw this Buddha śarīra from the Golden Dragon Peak all the way to the Martial Spirit World. But, he knew that the Ascending Moon Old Man had the stubborn temperament of a cow, thus Huang Xiaolong could only sit down cross-legged, following the Ascending Moon Old Man’s instructions, and begin circulating the Asura Tactics.

After Huang Xiaolong sat down, with a simple wave of the Ascending Moon Old Man’s hands, the Buddha śarīra flew up, hovering above Huang Xiaolong’s head. Then, the old man formed a strange looking sealing with his hands and pointed at the Buddha śarīra. An aureate symbol shot out, and in the next second, the Buddha śarīra drilled into the crown of Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Huang Xiaolong shook violently for a second, but recovered just as quickly.

Moments after the Buddha śarīra drilled into Huang Xiaolong’s head, it reached Huang Xiaolong’s soul sea. Buddhism energy surged out of it.

Pure and vast Buddhism energy rushed to every corner of Huang Xiaolong’s body. For a moment, he had the illusion that his body had become a Buddha-body.

The Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art diagram formation inside his body lit up on its own, circulating, as it frenziedly absorbed the vast Buddhism energy.

Buddhism energy continued to integrate into every part of Huang Xiaolong’s body, endlessly tempering his internal organs, meridians, physique, his soul, down to the last strand of hair.

From afar, it looked as if Huang Xiaolong was shrouded within a ball of light, akin to a venerable Buddha.

Buddhism energy continued to flow, filling the entire hall.

The Ascending Moon Old Man watched Huang Xiaolong with delight and surprise, a twinkle appeared in his eyes, “No wonder this kid’s cultivation is progressing so fast, so this is the reason!” It couldn’t escape the old man’s notice when that Treasure Dragon Protective Shield Art diagram formation began to absorb the Buddhism energy.

However, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi had concealed itself deeply, therefore neither his nor the Dragon Pearl’s presence in Huang Xiaolong’s forehead were noticed.

Time flowed by and days turned into weeks.

With the Ascending Moon Old Man’s godforce assistance, the Buddhism energy and the blood essence inside the Buddha śarīra were absorbed by Huang Xiaolong at a terrifying speed. At the same time, his cultivation was rapidly increasing. Almost with each passing day, there would be a significant increase in his strength and cultivation.

Although a Buddha śarīra couldn’t compare to a godhead, the Buddha blood essence and its Buddhism energy and aura were still shocking. Even with the Ascending Moon Old Man’s help, Huang Xiaolong still wasn’t able to completely refine the Buddha śarīra.

In fact, he only managed to refine one-fifth of it!

Two months passed.

Huang Xiaolong’s progress rose to half of the Buddha śarīra.

After two months, even the Ascending Moon Old Man was forced to stop.

In reality, he did not expect Huang Xiaolong to completely refine it in a few months’ time. After all, this was a Buddha śarīra, not some spiritual treasure that one could pick from the side of the road.

It had already far exceeded his expectation that Huang Xiaolong could refine half of it with the help of his godforce. He first assumed that it was a good result if Huang Xiaolong managed to refine even one-tenth of its energy.

After stopping, the Ascending Moon Old Man swallowed a medicinal pellet and sat down to adjust his breathing.

A short while later, Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes. Discovering that he had advanced to mid-Seventh Order God Realm, moreover, it was peak mid-Seventh Order God Realm, even he himself couldn’t stop smacking his lips in astonishment.

In these two months of refining the blood essence and Buddhism energy inside the Buddha śarīra produced greater results than the last five years of his cultivation after stepping into Seventh Order God Realm!

Huang Xiaolong checked his condition and noticed that the Buddha śarīra was smaller by half, and close to his heart. It continued to release Buddhism energy while the diagram formation inside his body continued to absorb it, but at a much slower pace.

By this time, the Ascending Moon Old Man opened his eyes. Before Huang Xiaolong could speak, the old man was already shouting, “I say, kid, you’ve refined half of that Buddha śarīra, yet you only managed to advance from early Seventh Order to mid-Seventh Order! What kind of odd monster are you? Such a large amount of Buddhism energy, where did it go?!”

If it was any other person, after refining half of a Buddha śarīra, that person definitely could jump from early Seventh Order to late-Seventh Order, maybe even peak late-Seventh Order God Realm, but Huang Xiaolong merely reached mid-Seventh Order.

He gambled his old life to get this Buddha śarīra, and seeing that Huang Xiaolong merely reached mid-Seventh Order God Realm after refining half of it, his heart ached greatly.

Huang Xiaolong scratched his forehead. Even he did not know how to answer this question.

“Forget it, asking you is like not asking at all.” Fortunately, the Ascending Moon Old Man did not persist in this subject. Standing up, he changed the topic, “There’s only a month left to the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, go get ready, we’ll depart to Royal Pill City after this!”
