Chapter 2876: Destroy Chen Dingtian

Crackling and popping noises sounded from Yu Zhou’s body.

The famous Dragon Fish brocade robe Yu Zhou wore, and whatever inner armor and sturdy outer armor, all of them shattered simultaneously with Huang Xiaolong’s punch. Huang Xiaolong’s fist smashed into Yu Zhou’s chest and came out of his back!

Yu Zhou’s inextinguishable dao heart was hammered out of his back by Huang Xiaolong’s punch!

Next, everyone saw Yu Zhou’s inextinguishable dao heart explode into pieces in midair, just like his creed robe and armors.

Yu Zhou’s body stiffened, staring fixedly at Huang Xiaolong as his lips moved, wanting to say something. But there wasn’t a shred of strength left in his body, and he couldn’t even muster a sound.

“You!”

A long time later, Yu Zhou finally mustered a hoarse growl.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent. His arm shook slightly, and Yu Zhou was sent tumbling in the air like a broken kite being swept away by strong winds, and he crashed into the horizon.

“What?!”

Shrieks echoed in the air. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Chen Dingtian was one of them. Naturally, the Dragon Fish Creed’s and Ten Swords Creed’s dozen of half-step Dao Venerables that were besieging the Immemorial Ice and Fire Qilin froze stupidly on the spot.

Duan Zheng had one of the most wonderful expressions around.

The wind was howling in their ears.

The half-step Dao Venerables attacking the two qilins had stopped attacking, and like Chen Dingtian, and the rest of both creeds’ disciples, all of them stared stupidly at the horizon, as well as Huang Xiaolong.

Yu Zhou, a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, who wore both inner and outer armor, had his chest punched through by Huang Xiaolong’s fist!

Even Yu Zhou’s inextinguishable dao heart was forced out of his body! Then, it exploded in the air!

Chen Dingtian just stared at Huang Xiaolong as a tsunami of shock hit his heart again and again. It was because he knew that he himself wouldn’t be able to make a hole through the peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm Yu Zhou in a single punch!

Zhou Hui was the Enforcement Hall Master Zhu Hui’s personal disciple, and he possessed seven high-order Saint Fates, and supreme bloodline. Hence, Yu Zhou’s combat strength was higher than most half-step Dao Venerables.

While Chen Dingtian and the others were still in shock, Huang Xiaolong leisurely walked towards Chen Dingtian without showing much emotion on his face. “Chen Dingtian, it’s your turn now.”

Chen Dingtian reacted when he sensed that Huang Xiaolong was approaching him. He panicked and took several steps back!

He was the Ten Swords Creed’s Blood Sword, a half-step Dao Venerable with a record of defeating a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable expert, but he was actually panicking when facing the early Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm Huang Xiaolong and feeling fearful.

“You, who are you really? What do you want to do?!” Chen Dingtian shouted in panic, but the quiver in his voice was clear to others.

“What do I want to do?” Huang Xiaolong let out a derisive snort, “I have already said before that if anyone from the Ten Swords Creed causes trouble for me, I will destroy his dao physique and completely abolish him. Since you took my words lightly, what else can I do but destroy your dao physique!

Chen Dingtian’s expression was ugly to the extreme.

Suddenly, the Blood Sword appeared in his hand, and he slashed towards Huang Xiaolong with a twisted expression, “I don’t believe an early Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor like you is more powerful than a mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable!”

“Die for me!”

“My Blood Sword has experienced more than ten thousand bloody battles, and it has never been defeated. I don’t believe I will lose to a mere Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor like you!” Chen Dingtian bellowed.

A streak of blood-red light from the Blood Sword turned into a sea of blood.

The Dragon Fish Creed’s half-step Dao Venerables were terrified by Chen Dingtian’s blood sea sword light, and they hurriedly backed away.

Huang Xiaolong continued to approach Chen Dingtian with a cold face. When facing Chen Dingtian’s attack, he didn’t take out his Immemorial Sword, but merely flicked his fingers, sending a horrifying force out. The blood sea sword light stopped advancing as if it was grabbed by an invisible giant hand, and then, it was forcefully torn apart.

The blood sea sword light shattered into fragments like a piece of glass.

Before Chen Dingtian realized what was happening, he felt terrifying energy roiling back towards him, sending him reeling on his feet, and his blood surged violently.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong moved in a flicker, arriving within meters of Chen Dingtian almost instantaneously.

“Pow!”

Huang Xiaolong’s fist punched through Chen Dingtian’s chest, just like how his fist had gone through Yu Zhou’s chest. Everyone saw that Chen Dingtian’s inextinguishable dao heart was knocked out of his body, and it burst into pieces.

“Senior Brother Chen Dingtian!”

Disciples of Ten Swords Creed cried out in horror.

“Don’t be insolent!” The Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerables roared furiously, waving their swords at Huang Xiaolong, brimming with a murderous aura.

Huang Xiaolong snorted coldly and didn’t even bother to look at them as his other fist punched towards his back. The seven Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerables were simultaneously knocked backwards into the air, like withered leaves carried by the storm, and they finally crashed into the mountains in the distance. The ground shook, and mountains rumbled.

“D*mn!” Both Dragon Fish Creed’s and Ten Swords Creed’s remaining experts were agape with disbelief.

He sent seven half-step Dao Venerables flying with one punch?!

Chen Dingtian quivered from head to toe and frigid coldness slithered up and spread through his whole being after he saw his own inextinguishable dao heart bursting into pieces before his eyes..

Huang Xiaolong looked at the bloodlessly pale Chen Dingtian, and smiled suddenly. His smile was a little wicked as his palm struck out.

Chen Dingtian could see that when Huang Xiaolong’s palm struck out, startling icy blue light burst forward, condensing a curtain of ice-blue pillars around Huang Xiaolong.

Chen Dingtian’s eyes widened in shock, and his mind was buzzing.

“This, could this be?!”

In this brief moment, Huang Xiaolong’s palm landed accurately on Chen Dingtian’s torso, sending him crashing into the mountain behind him.

The remaining experts from both creeds saw that Chen Dingtian had turned into an icy-blue statue when his body was embedded into the mountain. A moment passed, and the frozen Chen Dingtian disintegrated into icy-blue speckles, scattering into the world.

After seeing Chen Dingtian’s grand dao physique being destroyed, a Dragon Fish Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable expert said quiveringly, “Absolute frost power!”

The common Dragon Fish Creed’s disciples were probably unable to recognize the absolute frost power, but as part of the Dragon Fish Creed’s older half-step Dao Venerable experts, how could they not recognize the power of absolute frost!

“What? Absolute, absolute frost power!”

When other Dragon Fish Creed’s and Ten Swords Creed’s disciples heard that, their already pale faces turned a shade whiter, and more than half of their reason was taken over by fear.

After Chen Dingtian’s dao physique turned into an ice statue and disintegrated into speckles, his godhead, dao soul, and Saint Fates that tried to escape, were caught by Huang Xiaolong and thrown into the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

The seven half-step Dao Venerables, who were knocked away with a punch, struggled to their feet, just in time to witness Huang Xiaolong destroy Chen Dingtian’s body and capture his dao soul. All of them were shocked and enraged at the same time.

“You, release Grand Elder Chen Dingtian’s dao soul immediately, or else, our Ten Swords Creed will surely raze your sect to the ground!” one of the half-step Dao Venerable bellowed.

Huang Xiaolong reached out and grabbed that half-step Dao Venerable from across space, dragging him up to him. He said to him with a cutting gaze and cold voice, “It looks like you are still not taking my words seriously.” His fist had already punched out before he finished.

When Huang Xiaolong’s fist punched out, the others saw a glaring blaze shooting across space. It looked striking and brilliant as it enveloped the Ten Swords Creed’s half-step Dao Venerable expert. The half-step Dao Venerable let out heart-wrenching screams while his body was incinerated part by part.

“Ab-absolute blaze!”
