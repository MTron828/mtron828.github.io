Chapter 3462: Bei Ting

Huang Xiaolong, Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han soon received the news.

There was also another piece of news that shook the Ice River World. The members of the Northern Court Celestial Empire weren’t leaving! Bei Ting ordered Huang Xiaolong to bring Yang Han to the Ice Palace to meet him!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement. “Looks like we’re going to have to meet Bei Ting for sure.” Even without the announcement from Bei Ting, he was headed for the Ice Palace.

Gu Yuan laughed. “The Ice River World is going crazy the moment he made the announcement. Everyone said that they hadn’t seen Bei Ting take action for a long time.”

Indeed. Any matter that would require a God of Creation to appear personally would be a huge matter.

The reason behind everyone pouring into the Ice River World was to see Bei Ting in action. It seemed as though their wishes were about to come true.

Long Yi smiled. “Actually, I haven’t seen a God of Creation make their move in a long time.” A look of anticipation could be seen on his face.

“When we arrive at the Ice Palace, you and Gu Yuan can crush the experts of the Northern Court Celestial Empire. Bei Ting will definitely show off his strength by stopping you,” Huang Xiaolong joked.

Long Yi jumped in fright. “What?! The two of us won’t be enough to fight Bei Ting! If we broke through to the God of Creation Realm, we might be able to put up a fight. Whatever the case, we’re too weak right now!”

Long Yi and Gu Yuan might possess terrifying physiques and bloodlines, but they knew that they were no match for an actual God of Creation. They would barely be able to resist the attacks of a God of Creation who had barely broken through, but Bei Ting was a seasoned expert! He had nearly 3 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

Gu Yuan forced a laugh, “Your Highness, you can’t let us embarrass ourselves later…”

Huang Xiaolong roared with laughter.

How could he be unaware that the two of them wouldn’t even be able to match up to Bei Ting’s little pinky?

One more month passed.

The Ice Palace was finally within reach.

It was located on endless ice plains, and Huang Xiaolong could see the faint blue glow around the structure even though they were still quite a fair distance away.

Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and Yang Han had complicated expressions on their faces. No matter who it was, they wouldn’t be able to hide their anxiety when they saw the Ice Palace.

“It’s said that the Ice Palace is an extremely powerful creation artifact, to begin with. If anyone can enter the thousandth space within, they would be able to control the artifact.” Gu Yuan sighed.

Long Yi shook his head silently. “Those are just rumors. The Ice Palace fused with the Ice River a long time ago. No one will be able to take it away. Even if anyone arrives at the one-thousandth space within the palace, they can’t control it. Regardless, the fact that there are countless treasures in there cannot be denied. The Yin-Yang universe-level spiritual vein should be located there too.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

One-thousandth space?

Others might not be able to enter, but Huang Xiaolong felt that he had a chance.

After all, he had the four Universe Origin Fires!

They continued to make their way to the Ice Palace, but they were stopped by a group of experts.

They were members of the Floating Light World Master Manor!

“Father, that’s him!” Gao Boyang pointed at Huang Xiaolong.

World Master Gao Chong stared at Huang Xiaolong silently.

“Did you kill four experts from my Floating Light World?” Killing intent flashed in Gao Chong’s eyes.

“Nope.”

Gao Chong frowned at his response.

One of the experts from the Floating Light World sneered, ‘Brat, are you finally willing to lower your head now that the world master is here? Where did your arrogance go?!”

Everyone from the Floating Light World Master Manor roared with laughter.

However, Yang Han stepped forward all of a sudden and declared, “I was the one who killed them.”

Staring suspiciously at Yang Han, Gao Chong felt that the person standing before him was somewhat familiar even though he had his head lowered.

“You?! You’re just a slave! Do you really think that my father will let you off because you take the blame for your master?” Gao Boyang sneered with contempt.

However, Yang Han raised his head to stare straight at Gao Chong in the next instant.

His action was like a giant sledgehammer that smashed into Gao Chong’s chest. Everyone stared at him with incredulous looks on their faces.

As the world master of the Floating Light World, he recognized Yang Han, the imperial teacher in the Northern Court Celestial Empire. In the past, he even received some pointers from the man!

“Lord… Lord Yang Han!” Gao Chong stuttered.

He thought of the news that was spreading through the Ice River like wildfire, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong with fear in his eyes.

Gao Boyang wanted to order Huang Xiaolong and the others to get to their knees, but his mind went blank when he heard what his father said.

Lord Yang Han?!

He failed to make the connection, but the white-browed expert behind him roared in fright, “That… Imperial Teacher, Lord Yang Han!”

The experts of the Floating Light World couldn’t believe their eyes.

Seeing as they recognized him, Yang Han growled at Gao Chong and the rest, “Kneel!”

Gao Chong and the others were at a loss for what to do, but Yang Han turned to kneel before Huang Xiaolong. “Your Highness, please spare his life.”

Huang Xiaolong flicked his finger, sending Gao Chong flying god knows how many miles away. He slammed straight into the entrance of the Ice Palace.

The ground trembled and the blast rang through the air.

Those standing around the Ice Palace turned to look at the figure who crashed into the Ice Palace, and they gasped in shock, “That… That’s Lord Gao Chong! The world master of the Floating Light World!”

Their gazes soon turned to Huang Xiaolong.

“The Huang B*stard,” Lu Ting, who was standing behind Celestial Emperor Bei Yanrui, yelled.

Bei Xue, Bei Yanrui, and the experts of the Northern Court Celestial Empire frowned.

Bei Ting’s gaze rested on Huang Xiaolong’s figure instantly.

In front of everyone, Huang Xiaolong started walking towards the Ice Palace.

A tremendous pressure descended from the void as he made his way over, and Bei Ting’s eyes slowly widened in shock. Huang Xiaolong’s strength had surpassed his expectations!
