Just like the previous punches, Jin Yuan and Fan Hui’s attack continued after blasting away the random monsters before charging towards Huang Peng and the ancestors.

Deafening explosions sounded out again and again.

All the members of the Asura Gate holding the array felt their blood and qi rumbling inside them and they took a few steps back to regain their footing.

The Lifeless Sect’s Ancestor Xu Junhua, Windy Sea Ghost King Wang Liugong, and the Yuanyang Valley’s Ancestor Deng Feizhi who were hiding in the distance, all gasped in shock when they saw the ferocity of the four Great Commanders.

Huang Peng and the forty four Emperor experts were actually unable to suppress the four of them even after activating the strongest array the Asura Gate had to offer!

Not only were they unable to suppress the four of them, they were even pushed back by their attacks!

Could there be anything more fearsome than that?

They were all late staged Emperor Realm experts, and all of them were top tier existences in the Hell Asura World. When they faced Tai Yue and the three other Great Commanders, they were nothing more than flies ready to be exterminated with a single thought.

Huang Peng and the ancestors were both shocked and furious after they stabilized themselves. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The light of reincarnation, death and rebirth, dictate death!”

Huang Peng yelled at the top of his lungs after suppressing the shock in his heart.

This was the third attack from the Asura Reincarnation Array!

Under the activation of the forty four people, an indescribable ray of light burst out from the heart of the array. This ray of light seemed to transcend the world, yet it was as if it had existed since ancient times. Rays of light emerged from the heart of the array and shot towards Tai Yue and his group.

Everything that the light touched reached the end of their lifespan. All the spiritual flowers, spiritual trees, and even the spirit rocks crumbled and shattered into a million pieces.

The light seemed to be able to dictate the life and death of anything it touched.

Tai Yue and Wan Yutian’s figure flashed, and they exchanged positions with Jin Yuan and Fan Hui once again. Another two fists were sent flying out.

“Reincarnation? Death? The only eternal is one’s strength! Watch me break your light of reincarnation!” Tai Yue roared.

His fist then collided with the ray of light.

The whole continent... No. The whole world started to shake.

Cracks started forming below the mountain peak. As the massive mountain collapsed into nothing more than a pile of dust, the ground below started to split open and a massive rift valley was formed.

As if trying to prove Tai Yue’s point, their fist pierced through the light of reincarnation and smashed directly into the heart of the array.

Once again, Huang Peng and the rest were sent reeling as blood seeped out from the corner of their mouths.

When Wang Liugong, who was hiding afar saw the scene playing out before him, he shuddered uncontrollably, “Oh mother... Are they still human? What in the world is that strength?!”

“Who in the world would be able to stop the four of them when they fight together? Even the Misty Palace’s Palace Master won’t be able to stop them. Even the old ancestor from the Massacring Gods Gate would barely be their opponent” Xu Junhua said with a dry throat.

“No! Unless the old ancestor of the Massacring Gods Gate surpasses the Emperor Realm, he wouldn’t be able to stop them in the slightest” Deng Feizhi’s voice trembled.

“Who would have thought that I would be able to witness such a peerless battle during a trip here to the Asura Gate! I no longer have any regrets in my life! Those people who refused the invitation can regret all they want!” The Dragon Lion Sect’s ancestor lamented.

“Strange... When did the four experts of their level appear in our Hell’s Asura World? Even the Massacring Gods Gate won’t be able to send out four experts at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.” Xu Junhua suddenly asked with a face full of doubt.

Suddenly, Deng Feizhi, Wang Liugong, and everyone else felt a chill run down their spine. They looked at each other and an expression of extreme fear formed on their face. “Could it be the Netherworld King’s Organization?!”

Netherworld King’s Organization!

Everyone who thought of that possibility felt their bodies tremble.

The four Great Commanders from the Netherworld King’s Organization!

That’s right!

Rumor had it that every single Great Commander of the Netherworld King’s Organization was a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert!

Even though the rumor had already been around for tens of billions of years, nobody had ever seen any of the Great Commanders. Since no one had ever seen their display of strength, there were many who doubted their strength.

However, if the rumors were true... Wouldn’t they be...

Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong who was looking at the battle from a distance.

If their guess was true, wouldn’t the Heavenly Monarch Realm cultivator, the seven star Netherking, be the master of the Netherworld King’s Organization?

Master of the Netherworld King’s Organization!

When they thought of the remote possibility of that being true, everyone felt the blood draining from their faces.

Deng Feizhi, who had questioned Huang Xiaolong about his identity, broke out in cold sweat. Fortunately for him, he hadn’t anger or offended Huang Xiaolong previously. Otherwise...

When he felt the gazes of everyone landing on him, Huang Xiaolong ignored all of them and maintained an indifferent expression on his face.

Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands together and looked silently at the grand battle playing out between the Great Commanders of the Netherworld King’s Organization and the true battle strength of the Asura Gate. Watching the battle between them would be beneficial for his cultivation.

He could tell that the four of them had come up with their own formation as they would swap positions everytime the two of them launched an attack.

The four of them had been following the king of hell for god knew how long, and the formation they created was much stronger than that of the Asura Gate’s.

When Huang Xiaolong was concentrating on the battle in the distance, Deng Zhilong set his sights on Huang Xiaolong and Ren Wokuang as a cold light flickered in his eyes.

He never would have thought that the combined might of the strongest experts in the Asura Gate would be unable to suppress Tai Yue and the three other cultivators serving Huang Xiaolong. However, he felt that as long as he was able to capture Huang Xiaolong and use him as a hostage, the four of them would have no choice but to admit defeat!

Hence, if he was able to capture Huang Xiaolong, it would be a great achievement!

It was a perfect chance for him to earn a great merit as Huang Xiaolong no longer had any bodyguards around him.

After another round of contemplation, Deng Zhilong’s figure flashed and he executed an ancient mysterious art that broke through space and appeared instantly in front of Huang Xiaolong. He laughed loudly, “Brat, you better behave yourself and surrender yourself to me!” He formed two claws with his hands and swiped out.

Ren Wokuang and Wang Mengqin’s faces changed when they realized that the situation was going south. Even the experts surrounding him were shocked.

Just when everyone thought that Huang Xiaolong was going to be captured by Deng Zhilong, a figure suddenly flashed and appeared beside Huang Xiaolong before sending out a single punch. With a single move, Deng Zhilong was sent flying and he vomited copious amounts of blood.

Looking at the sudden change in front of their eyes, everyone felt their jaws drop.

“This... he is a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert?!” Xu Junhua stammered.

Late-Tenth Order Emperor!

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. Even the other grand elders from the Asura Gate who had the same idea as Deng Zhilong were scared witless and they thanked their lucky stars that they weren’t the ones who made the first move.

The person who had appeared next to Huang Xiaolong was one of the Netherguard puppet captains.

“Is that person from the Undead Race?!” Wang Liugong’s voice trembled with uncertainty as he stared at the Netherguard puppet captain beside Huang Xiaolong.
