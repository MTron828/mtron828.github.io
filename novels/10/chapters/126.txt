Chapter 127: Li Lu Left

Coming to a stand in front of his younger sister, Huang Min, Huang Xiaolong checked her condition which resulted in a deep frown on his brows. Relying on his judgement, he could not see through what kind of method was used to immobilize his little sister in this spot. It wasn’t due to acupuncture points. As far as he could tell, in the entire Martial Spirit World, only he knew of this acupuncture point method. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou also walked up to check Huang Min’s condition, and they had the same expression as Huang Xiaolong. Evidently, they too were unsure of the solution.

Just when Huang Xiaolong’s anxiety was about to burn his eyebrows, the fixed Huang Min suddenly softened and could move again.

“Big Brother!” Huang Min cried out.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised and quickly helped her up, “Little girl, how do you feel?”

Huang Min shook her head: “I’m fine.”

Huang Min speedily told Huang Xiaolong: ‘This morning, I came out with Sister Li Lu, and when we were passing by Peaceful Street two middle-aged men suddenly appeared in front of us. After killing the four Marshal Mansion’s guards, they took us away. They brought us here after leaving the Royal City.” Huang Min paused to catch her breath.

Huang Xiaolong did not rush her, waiting patiently for her to continue.

Huang Min continued: “When we reached this place, the two of them interrogated Sister Li Lu, asking where some Mountain and Sea Manuscript is. Sister Li Lu said she didn’t know, crying and saying that she would kill them to avenge her elder brother, Father, and Grandfather. The two men became angry and they wanted to kill us.”

Everyone present listened attentively.

“When the two men were about to kill us a beautiful woman suddenly appeared, and with a flick of her long-sleeve the two men were repelled.”

Huang Min continued: “The two men weren’t her opponent and wanted to run away so the beautiful woman did not kill them. In the end, that woman took Sister Li Lu away.”

“She took Li Lu away.” Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

“Yes. That beautiful woman said she has been searching for a successor for a few hundred years, and Sister Li Lu’s talent was most suitable to carry on her legacy. So, she wanted to receive Sister Li Lu as her personal disciple. Sister Li Lu then agreed to go with her.” Huang Min muttered: “I wanted to persuade Sister Li Lu to stay, but I don’t know what method that wench used to stop me from moving. She said it would go away by itself in an hour, but if anyone wanted to end it before that, only a Saint realm expert could undo it.”

“Saint realm expert!”

Marshal Haotian, Fei Hou, the rest of the guards, and even Huang Xiaolong himself were shocked.

That beautiful woman said only Saint realm experts could undo her binding... does that mean that beautiful woman is a Saint realm expert?

An uncertain light flickered in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

However, he was happy for Li Lu having the opportunity to become the disciple of a Saint realm expert and that Li Lu was willing to go with her voluntarily, accepting her as her Master so that she could learn the beautiful woman’s cultivation technique and battle skill in order to exact revenge.

“Did that beautiful woman say where she is bringing Li Lu?” A while later, Huang Xiaolong asked, his voice sounding solemn.

“She said that if we want to find Li Lu, we have to go to Deities Templar.” Huang Min answered.

“Deities Templar?” Huang Xiaolong was puzzled. He turned towards Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou, but the two of them had the same look of confusion on their faces. Judging from their reactions, both of them didn’t know anything about the existence of this Deities Templar.

It was a little out of Huang Xiaolong’s expectations that neither Marshal Haotian nor Fei Hou had heard about this Deities Templar.

He could only find out slowly.

Since Li Lu was taken as a personal disciple by that beautiful woman, her safety was no longer of any concern. It was just that, they won’t be able to see Li Lu until a very long time in the future. When they meet again, would it be in ten or twenty years?

“Let’s go back.” Huang Xiaolong ordered and sighed secretly. With Huang Min found, everyone headed back to Tianxuan Mansion.

Although he knew Li Lu was okay and that she even accepted a Saint realm expert as her Master, it did not reduce the sense of loss in his heart.

For the Li Residence’s revenge, Li Lu would take it upon herself to achieve this goal. This was also his wish.

Thus, when they returned to Tianxuan Mansion, Huang Xiaolong told Marshal Haotian to lift the blockade and stop tracking the killers.

Three days later.

Huang Xiaolong did not practice over the last three days. There was a slight resistance to adapt to Li Lu’s sudden departure. These past few years had made Li Lu a part of his life, and with her gone he felt an emptiness in his heart.

En, that’s right, it was a little empty.

Huang Xiaolong looked up at the night moon. Just a few months prior, it was the same round moon, shining just as brightly.

Xiaolong, tell me, am I going to die?

The words Li Lu spoke at that time, Huang Xiaolong remembered them clearly. Even her melancholic mood appeared clearly in his eyes as if the scene that night was repeating itself.

At that time, Li Lu hugged Huang Xiaolong.

I’m scared I won’t be able to see you anymore, that I’ll never see you again!

Li Lu cried.

The memory of the scene dissipated.

Huang Xiaolong sighed, muttering to himself: “Deities Templar.”

Five days passed.

Huang Xiaolong was mediating in the yard when Huang Min walked in. Sensing Huang Xiaolong’s mood, she spoke: “Big Brother, are you still thinking about Sister Li Lu?”

Huang Xiaolong responded by nodding his head, “In another two days, the Academy’s competition will begin. Do you have confidence to get the class’ first place spot?”

Some years back, Huang Xiaolong requested two spots from Principal Sun Zhang for his siblings, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai, and both of them have been learning in the Cosmic Star Academy for the past few years.

Although both of their martial spirits grades were not high, they were nurtured by Huang Xiaolong and guided by Fei Hou in their cultivation. Their strength and cultivation speed were no worse than those so-called geniuses in the Cosmic Star Academy.

“Of course, Big Brother! this time, your little sister will seize the class’ first spot for you!” Huang Min laughed, full of confidence.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. With Huang Min’s current strength, to get the class number one spot would not be a problem.

A while later, Huang Min left Huang Xiaolong’s yard.

Readjusting his mood, Huang Xiaolong triggered the God Binding Ring and entered the ancient battlefield, then started practicing Asura Tactics and God Binding Palm.

After several months of practice, Huang Xiaolong’s comprehension in the God Binding Palm battle skill had progressed by leaps and bounds.

Another two days passed.

Huang Xiaolong woke up and headed to the Cosmic Star Academy with his younger siblings.

One year has passed since he last came.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived, it was inevitable that he needed to spend some time talking and guiding the older Academy students.

When entering the Holy Hall, just like the years before, many fangirls were shrieking and screaming his name.

“Huang Xiaolong, I love you~!”

Confessions of love accompanied Huang Xiaolong as he made hit way to his class’s seating arrangement. He had broken through the Tenth Order but had yet to put in a request for the class advancement assessment test. Officially, he was a student of Second Year Class Six.

When Lu Kai saw Huang Xiaolong, he walked over and smiled: “This guy really, you went missing for a year, and I heard you even went to the Yuwai Kingdom?”

Huang Xiaolong nodded: “En, I made a trip to the Yuwai Kingdom.”

Hearing his confirmation, Lu Kai swiftly pulled Huang Xiaolong to the side, inquiring in a whisper with a grin, “I heard the women in the Yuwai Kingdom are very beautiful, filled with an otherworldly temperament.”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned with Lu Kai’s line of questioning, and nodded slowly and said, “Ah, filled with temperament.”

Lu Kai’s eyes lit up, “Then I must find a chance to bring this up with my Royal Father so I can follow the special envoys to the Yuwai Kingdom.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head helplessly.

Note: Term ’Deities Templar’ will remain, in some aspect of likeness to Knights Templar.
