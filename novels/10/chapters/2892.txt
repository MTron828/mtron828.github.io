Chapter 2893: Shocking the World

The Xuanyuan Chariot was extremely fast, and it disappeared from their sights in an instant.

A cold light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes when he looked at the fleeing chariot. The figure of a golden phantom appeared behind him, and it shared his facial features. It was as though he had summoned a grand dao clone of himself.

When those around him felt the terrifying aura coming off the golden phantom, they were flabbergasted.

“What’s he doing now?!”

“There’s no way he’s thinking of attacking the Xuanyuan Chariot… As a peak level Dao Venerable Cosmos Artifact, even Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to shatter its defenses!”

When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong sent both fists towards the void before him. The golden phantom behind him mirrored his actions, and a majestic blast tore through the void. The Monarch Yu Sacred Land started to shake under the sheer amount of power contained in his strike.

Everyone felt the space around them trembling, and they found it hard to stay on their feet.

Boom!

Huang Xiaolong’s punch reached the Xuanyuan Chariot almost instantly, and it slammed heavily into its side.

With brilliant rays of light emerging from the eye of the formation, grand dao runes poured out to defend those inside.

However strong the defenses of the grand dao runes were, they didn’t manage to stop Huang Xiaolong’s punch instantly. The chariot was like a tiny boat in the ocean besieged with roaring waves as it tumbled about for several billion miles before finally rolling to a stop.

The experts watching the battle sucked in a cold breath when they saw what happened to the Xuanyuan Chariot.

Huang Xiaolong might not have torn the defenses of the chariot apart, but he had managed to send it flying. The fact was shocking enough.

As the Xuanyuan Chariot tumbled through the air, those inside felt the world around them spinning round and round. In a state of panic, they pushed themselves past their limit and poured another round of energy into the eye of the formation. As the chariot turned into a streak of light, it tore through the barrier around Monarch Yu Sacred Land and disappeared into the sea of stars.

When those who stood around saw the sorry state of the Xuanyuan Chariot, they couldn’t help but sigh in their hearts. They wanted to say something, but the words got stuck in their throats.

Previously, Xuanyuan Potian had led six Dao Venerables to the Monarch Yu Sacred Land in high spirits. They had made a grand entrance, and they had even mocked Huang Xiaolong. Now, they were escaping with all they had. By throwing away the last shred of their dignity, they were running away like rats scuttling from a sewer.

If not for the Xuanyuan Chariot, they were afraid that the Lightning Tiger Prince would have had to remain behind today.

As a deafening silence filled the lands, everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated expression.

No matter what they felt when they looked at him, there was an unmistakable sense of fear hidden in their eyes.

By the time the Xuanyuan Chariot disappeared, Huang Xiaolong had retrieved his dao souls and Saint Fates. The aura of an emperor around him had disappeared, but no one would ever dare to look down on this Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm youngster again.

Huang Xiaolong took a short step and appeared in the Qilin Chariot.

“Let’s go.”

Long Jianfei and the others nodded respectfully, and the Qilin Chariot tore through the skies. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A look of astonishment could be seen on the faces of the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World when he left. They were expecting him to speak to them after he was done, but he didn’t throw a single glance their way before he left…

Could it be that he didn’t know their identities?

No… That wasn’t possible!

He definitely knew of them!

After their initial shock, a sense of irritation formed in their hearts. As the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World, they received the highest treatment no matter where they went. They had never been ignored like this!

“Young Lady, do you think we should…” Tan Meiqin asked cautiously.

After a slight hesitation, Yu Yue finally spoke up, “We should return… Let’s come another day.”

The reason she had rushed over to Monarch Yu Sacred Land was because she was afraid that Huang Xiaolong would die under Yong Luosheng’s blade. As it turned out, her worries were unfounded. Now that she had managed to confirm Huang Xiaolong’s possession of eleven high-order Saint Fates, it was enough.

A complicated feeling arose in her heart when she thought about it.

In the past, the three of them had sworn to the heavens that they would only accept a dao partner if he had eleven high-order Saint Fates!

Today, someone like that had appeared!

Wouldn’t that mean…

Looking at each other silently, the three moons of the Divine Tuo Holy World took their leave.

When the others saw that there was nothing else of interest, they left too.

…

After the various experts left Monarch Yu Sacred Land, news of the battle started to spread like wildfire.

The Divine Tuo Holy World trembled the moment Huang Xiaolong’s achievements were made public, and as long as one was a resident of the Divine Tuo Holy World, they received the news.

“Xuanhuang Supreme Dragon Dao Soul! Nefarious Origin Dao Soul! Great Immemorial Dao Soul! Eleven high-order Saint Fates!”

“At the peak of the mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, he managed to form a small world! The cosmos energy he wields is purer and stronger than a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable!”

“With the power of absolute frost, fire, and two other types of peak-level energies, he stopped the Xuanyuan Arrow!”

“He blew a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable away with a single fist! Xuanyuan Potian and those from the Xuanyuan Creed ran away with their tail tucked between their legs!”

Any piece of this information could shake the foundations of the Divine Tuo Holy World!

There were even some powers who tried to investigate which organization Huang Xiaolong belonged to.

The only surprising piece of news was that the Ten Swords Creed, who had placed a giant bounty on Huang Xiaolong’s head, called it off the moment the news reached them!

…

In the main palace of the Dragon Fish Creed, the Dao Venerables gathered, and the number who showed up was even greater than the last time!

As the grand hall master, Li Xue’s expression was solemn as she received the reports of what had happened in Monarch Yu Sacred Land.

She wasn’t the only one. Those who were in the hall expressed their disbelief, including the hall master of Enforcement Hall, Zhu Hui!

“Eleven high-order Saint Fates, three dao souls, and four types of absolutel powers!” Zhu Hui couldn’t forget about the report he had just received.

The thing that shocked him the most was that as a Primal Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong had already cultivated a small world of his own!

A type of fear, he had never expected to feel, rose in his heart.

As a Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable, he was starting to feel afraid of a Primal Ancestor!

“Grand Hall Master, why don’t we report this to the patriarch?” The hall master of the Foreign Affairs Hall, Wang Quyang, coughed. His voice was sore, and his feelings were complicated.

After sucking in a cold breath, Li Xue stopped them. “Right now, Lord Huang Shuai is at a critical stage of his cultivation. We can’t risk disturbing them!”

Sweeping her gaze across those present, she sighed, “Before the patriarch gives us any order, no one is allowed to offend Huang Xiaolong! Consider this my highest order! If anyone under you offends him, I’ll cripple their cultivation and chase them out of the Dragon Fish Creed!”

The hearts of everyone skipped a beat when they heard her threat. However, they still agreed respectfully.

“Grand Hall Master, Huang Xiaolong’s talent has already overshadowed Lord Huang Shuai… Do you think…” one of the vice hall masters asked meekly.

Upon shaking her head, Li Xue snapped at him. “Before his identity is made known, no one is allowed to make any guesses!”
