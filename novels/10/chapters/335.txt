Chapter 336: Senior Huang

Deities Templar’s Holy Maiden? A frown creased Huang Xiaolong’s forehead looking at Ao Baixue, his instinct told him that Ao Baixue wasn’t lying.

Li Lu actually became the Holy Maiden of Deities Templar, what was this about? Huang Xiaolong quivered with an ominous feeling inside.

Ao Baixue’s sudden holler cut into Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts. Turning over, he saw Ao Baixue’s Saint realm space shoot up, hovering above Huang Xiaolong’s head, where numerous flaming snowflakes fell like an avalanche, burying Huang Xiaolong underneath.

Even a Second Order Saint realm expert would avoid coming in close contact with this flaming snow, any Xiantian realm would be melted into nothing with the slightest touch.

Ao Baixue glared at Huang Xiaolong, his eyes shining with hatred and sharp killing intent.

“Die!!!” He refused to believe that a miracle would happen twice, a Xiantian realm absolutely could not survive being buried under his flaming snow.

Just as the snow avalanche began rumbling down, Huang Xiaolong raised his head, and before Ao Baixue could react, a golden ember fire burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s body, taking shape in the form of a golden red fire dragon, spiralling upwards. Ao Baixue watched stupefied as his flaming snow was swallowed clean by the golden red fire dragon.

The golden red fire dragon continued upward, colliding with the snow white Saint space realm.

Zi! A sonorous boom resounded, the Saint realm space shook, emitting wisps of smoke plumes endlessly as its size shrank. Ao Baixue lost all color from his face, hardly disguising the obvious shock in his eyes.

His Saint realm space was actually being burned? What the f*ck is this fire?!

Huang Xiaolong ignored the horror in Ao Baixue’s eyes, fully pushing the true fire essence in his dantian and making it burn more vigorously. The golden red fire dragon, shaped from the true essence fire, wound itself tightly around Ao Baixue’s Saint realm space, eating it away.

A Saint realm space’s defense was extremely sturdy, after all, it was formed from a Saint realm expert’s understanding of the space law. Under usual circumstances, even the flames formed by a high-level Saint realm expert could not hack away other Saint realm experts’ Saint realm space, but Huang Xiaolong’s true essence fire could.

Ao Baixue attempted to recall his Saint realm space back into his body, but Huang Xiaolong’s palm struck out, a golden palm imprint distorted the space. Ao Baixue actually found that he couldn’t move at all.

This?! He was greatly shocked. In the next moment, however, warm liquid rushed up his throat, he was spurting blood from his mouth. Ao Baixue quickly looked up, only to discover that his Saint realm space was gone, burned away to nothingness by Huang Xiaolong’s fire dragon.

Bottomless despair intertwined with terror in Ao Baixue’s eyes.

To a Saint realm warrior, their Saint realm space was equivalent to a second life, if their Saint realm space was destroyed, the dire consequences were much worse than a Xiantian realm warrior having their Qi Sea destroyed. Even with the help of another Saint realm expert, it was impossible to rebuild the Saint realm space, as they lacked the capability to assist. In short, if Ao Baixue managed to survive, his cultivation would suffer a severe setback and have no hope of promotion ever again in his entire lifetime.

After burning away Ao Baixue’s Saint realm space, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette blurred in a flicker, arriving in front of Ao Baixue. The Blades of Asura appeared in his hands and silently slit across Ao Baixue’s throat.

Blood dyed the ground below red.

Ao Baixue clutched his throat, but Huang Xiaolong’s blades already penetrated his chest. The blades shook a little before Huang Xiaolong pulled them out again. Ao Baixue wobbled unsteadily and staggered backwards even as he tried to steady himself.

Still, with his throat slit and heart cut into halves, Ao Baixue was somehow still alive. Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong sensed a strong vitality desperately healing Ao Baixue’s wounds in his throat and heart.

Saint realm warriors, not only was their physical defense formidable, their healing ability wasn’t far behind.

Seeing this result, Huang Xiaolong leaped up, his palm enshrouded in true essence fire, slamming down on top of Ao Baixue’s head. The true essence fire spread from the head down to Ao Baixue’s body.

Tragic shrieks came from Ao Baixue’s throat, but it ended just as quickly. A short while later, his body slumped to the ground, all signs of life vanished. To totally kill a Saint realm warrior, the only way was to destroyed the soul, otherwise, no matter how grave their bodily injuries were, they would still not die.

Just like giant ghost Feng Yang, it would only die if its ghost soul was destroyed. But then again, a Saint realm warrior’s soul was quite formidable too. Luckily, Huang Xiaolong had the true essence fire, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to kill Ao Baixue.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ao Baixue’s corpse, and after a small thought, he moved the corpse into the Asura Ring. In fact, he wanted to test if it could be refined by the Thousand Beast Cauldron inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda.

‘En, if it can be refined, it would surely be very beneficial’, Huang Xiaolong secretly thought.

Divine grade spirit pellets were refined from many rare spirit elixirs. In the Martial Spirit World, someone who used Saint realm warriors as an ingredient for refining pellets had yet to appear...

Then, Huang Xiaolong turned around, facing Fan Yiming’s group of Wind God Cult, as well as Wu Feng’s group of ministers.

Fan Yiming, Wu Feng, and the rest quivered when they noticed Huang Xiaolong looking at them. The legs that could shatter a large boulder with a single kick now felt weak and jittery, refusing to stand up no matter how hard they tried, as if their legs were permanently cramped.

Huang Xiaolong sneered. With a single step, he was already in front of Fan Yiming. Fan Yiming, Wufeng, and the rest were so scared seeing the distant Huang Xiaolong suddenly appear right in front of them that their knees gave out with a snap, kneeling on both legs.

“Se−Senior, Senior Huang!” The Wind God Cult’s Leader, Fan Yiming, stammered, the expression on his face was as if he had seen a ghost. Wu Feng’s head was so low that he was practically kissing the ground. He was tongue-tied, his mouth opened and closed but no words came out. The Luo Tong Kingdom ministers that followed him didn’t know what to say either.

Listening to the Wind God Cult’s Leader, Fan Yiming, calling him Senior, Huang Xiaolong smiled brilliantly at him, “What’s the matter?”

Fan Yiming blanked at Huang Xiaolong’s beaming smile, millions of words were all stuck in his throat. After a brief moment of blankness, he hurried forward, crawling on his hands and knees until he reached Huang Xiaolong’s feet, “Senior Huang, I beg you, spare us! We were only against Prince Lu Kai because Deities Templar threatened us, I...!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong cut short Fan Yiming’s words. Lifting a finger, Fan Yiming’s forehead was pierced with a finger-sized hole, blood spurted to the ground. Fan Yiming tumbled down without another word.

Wind God Cult’s Elders all turned deathly pale. Huang Xiaolong was smiling one second and killed their Wind God Cult Leader the next, some even had dark wet patches on the ground underneath them.

Detecting the distasteful smell, Huang Xiaolong frowned. His finger stabbed the void. In that instant, several Wind God Cult Elders’ heads were pierced through and through. Without another word, Huang Xiaolong killed all the present Wind God Cult Elders.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong turned to Wu Feng. By this time, Wu Feng was already terrified out of his mind. Losing interest, Huang Xiaolong resolved Wu Feng swiftly. Initially, he had planned to play around a little, but since Wu Feng had already lost his mind, then forget it. The group of Luo Tong Kingdom’s ministers, however, Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to be bothered with them so he pushed them over to Lu Kai, letting him handle them.

When Huang Xiaolong once again stood in front of him, Lu Kai looked at Huang Xiaolong for a very long time with complex emotions, before finally uttering such a sentence: “Your mother, you super monstrous freak! This is too much of a blow to me!”

Truly, the strength Huang Xiaolong had shown earlier was too big of blow towards Lu Kai’s ‘fragile’ heart.

Huang Xiaolong merely chuckled at his words.
