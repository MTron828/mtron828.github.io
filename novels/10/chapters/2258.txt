Chapter 2259: Disciples of the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate

The Three Red Devils froze in shock. Before they reacted, all three were sent flying by Huang Xiaolong’s palm force hitting their chests. Their bodies smashed a hole through the wall, and they tumbled out from the hall.

Blood gushed out from the grave wounds on their chests.

“You, how, how could this be?!!” The eldest brother among the Three Red Devils, He Longjie, looked at Huang Xiaolong in dread, and uttered in disbelief.

Huang Xiaolong, a mid-Ninth Order Sovereign’s battle power had reached this level?!

Didn’t the Holy Alliance say this Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique ranked below four thousand and two hundred? Of course, they had also done their own investigations. The result of Huang Xiaolong’s second test showed his complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, and saint physique were all indeed below the four thousand and two hundred rankings!

Thus, Holy Alliance’s Jiang Tian had passed on correct information to them.!

But where did things go wrong?

Suddenly, a thought rumbled in He Longjie’s mind, and his face turned worst, “Could it be that you have...?!”

Before he could finish his words, the situation changed. Two sharp swords pierced out of the void, crossing space akin to two flying dragons straight at Huang Xiaolong’s back.

This attack came fast, and it was as fast as Huang Xiaolong’s attack on the Three Red Devils. The surging sword qi was actually slightly stronger than Huang Xiaolong’s attack.

Seeing that the two sharp swords were about to pierce into Huang Xiaolong’s back in the next second, the Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise Divine Fires inside Huang Xiaolong’s body suddenly flew out. The two divine fires’ spirits opened their mouths and spat out a sea of rolling flames.

The two sharp swords slowed due to the resistance from the boundless divine fires. Huang Xiaolong swerved slightly to the side, and the two swords missed Huang Xiaolong by several inches.

“Eii~!”

There were two different sounds of surprise as two newcomers arrived in the hall.

Huang Xiaolong stood straight in the middle of the hall, and his cold gaze locked on the two newcomers. Had his reaction been slower by a split second just now, those two swords would have given him heavy injuries.

“Evolving Dragon Holy Gate.” Huang Xiaolong named the origin of the two.

The newcomers were Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples!

More importantly, these two were no ordinary disciples. They were mid-First Order Venerable experts with complete dao saint godhead, saint bloodline, or saint physique that ranked higher than the Three Red Devils.

Due to having a portion of Wan Zhuoyuan’s memories, Huang Xiaolong easily recognized the signs of Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples.

The attack technique these two had used just now was the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s Flying Dragon Sword Art.

Although the Flying Dragon Sword Art was not one of the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s holy martial arts, it was the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s half-step Venerable’s sword art, created by an Eminent Elder of the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate.

It looked like, even though these two weren’t the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s Holy Princes, their statuses in the sect were not low. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have the privilege of learning the Flying Dragon Sword Art.

“Your eyesight is not bad.” The taller young man praised mockingly, seeing that Huang Xiaolong was able to see through their identities so quickly. “Brat, seeing that you recognized us as the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples, I’ll give you a chance. Scram now and leave the Three Red Devils to us!”

So, these two also came for the Three Red Devils.

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected this.

It seemed like the Three Red Devils had a secret that he wasn’t aware of? Or else these two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples would not travel over a trillion miles from the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground to the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground.

After hearing the tall young man tell him to scram, Huang Xiaolong grinned, but there was a gleam of ferocity in his eyes as he retorted, “It seems to me that both of you are mistaken about one thing. We are not in the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground. This is the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground!”

Yet Huang Xiaolong’s words made them erupted in laughter. One of them repeated, “Zhuoyuan Holy Ground? So what if this is the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground?”

The other short and fat middle-aged man laughed as he said, “Brat, just now you dodged our attack. Are you a disciple of Zhuoyuan Holy Gate? Even so, as long as we bury you here, the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate won’t have the guts to come find us for an explanation!”

This Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciple showed obvious disdain towards the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate in his words. He was clearly not putting the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate in his eyes.

In truth, as the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate had grown stronger than the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate overall, even the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s upper echelons did not put the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate in their eyes. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Especially now that there was a rumor circulating that Wan Zhuoyuan was missing, the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate was even more dismissive of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate.

Just as the fat middle-aged man finished his words, Huang Xiaolong had disappeared in a blur, transforming into a primordial divine dragon. His massive dragon claw slammed on the two people.

Both Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples were shocked. Never had they imagined that Huang Xiaolong would dare to attack despite knowing that they were disciples of the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate!

“Primordial divine dragon? A blue-colored one?!”

“Heihei, punk, you’re looking to die! Did you forget we’re from the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate? I’ll kill a dragon today, drink its blood, and roast its meat!”

The two on the opposite side laughed harshly, and attacked instead of retreating, and the swords in their hands met with Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw.

Zheng!

The swords in their hands collided with Huang Xiaolong’s dragon claw, sending fiery sparks flying everywhere, blood was flowing out between the grooves of the dragon claw.

“What?!” The result shocked the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples. They had thought that relying on the swords in their hands, their joint attack could pierce through the dragon claw. But who’d thought that they would merely make small cracks on the dragon’s scales, letting out a little blood.

The toughness of Huang Xiaolong’s body greatly exceeded their estimation.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong’s mouth opened wide, and the Azure Dragon Divine Fire and Black Tortoise Divine Fire’s spirits flew straight at the two men. Both swiftly slashed at the two divine fires with the swords in their hands. Vigorous sword qi rose like a tempest, forming a great vortex, spinning rapidly, spitting sharp sword qi three hundred and sixty degrees. The sword qi vortex actually blocked the Azure Dragon and Black Tortoise Divine Fires. However, in the next second, the Vermilion Bird Divine Fire and White Tiger Divine Fire’s spirits whistled across the air, smashing into the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples’ backs.

Two people’s miserable screams rang in the air. There was a large scorched hole on their back, and the flesh around the wound emitted a strong burnt smell.

Huang Xiaolong’s hill-sized dragon claw slapped down on their heads, burying them into the floor.

Bang!

The ground quaked violently.

Subsequently, the Barbarian Space lightning bead flew out, exuding numerous streaks of destructive lightning, surging above the two disciples’ heads.

Huang Xiaolong stopped attacking, watching the two burnt Evolving Dragon Holy Gate disciples, who were barely breathing with their lives hanging by a thread.

“Saint, saint artifact!” Even in their conditions, the two of them stared at the lightning bead in total shock.

Didn’t they say the entire Zhuoyuan Holy Gate only had one saint artifact? Why does this mid-Ninth Order Sovereign disciple in front of them possess a saint artifact?!

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the four divine fires and lightning bead, then his hands reached out and grabbed the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples to his front.

“You, you, what do you want to do?”

Both looked at Huang Xiaolong in apprehension.

Huang Xiaolong did not bother to answer, and directly searched their souls. He finished a few minutes later.

Then, Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Complete Dao Saint Godhead’s devouring power surged, and the two men’s bodies began to dry up and shrink at a rate visible to the naked eye.

"Our Master will not let you off!" Both of them struggled violently, screaming at the top of their lungs, but their screams died abruptly.

Master? Huang Xiaolong sneered.

From their memories, Huang Xiaolong already knew that the two of them had come to the Zhuoyuan Holy Ground at their own accord, and they had informed neither their Master nor the Evolving Dragon Holy Gate.

After devouring the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples, Huang Xiaolong strode towards the injured Three Red Devils.

They had seen everything clearly when Huang Xiaolong had killed the two Evolving Dragon Holy Gate’s disciples. Their blood drained as they saw Huang Xiaolong approaching them.
