Chapter 2482: Subduing the Undead Spirits

“Congratulations on crossing the fourth tribulation!” Yu Ming and the others congratulated.&nbsp;

If they were honest, they had felt a little pessimistic about Huang Xiaolong’s ability to transcend the tribulation when they had noticed the twenty-first bolt.

A brilliant smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he turned to speak to them. “Let’s go! We’re heading to the headquarters of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate!”

An awkward silence descended as they stared at him in disbelief.

Why were they going to the headquarters of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate again?

“Your Highness, are you still trying to locate the All Extinguishing Holy Symbol and the dao artifact?” Yu Ming hesitated for a moment before trying to persuade him otherwise. “According to what we know, the dao artifact might not even exist. Even if it does, they might have been taken away!”

After all, they had already searched the entire place twice.

In the past, the Devil Palace, the Holy Lands Alliance, and the various ancient races had flipped the entire place over after the All Extinguishing Holy Gate was annihilated. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they had dug three feet into the ground in order to locate the treasures. However, they had returned empty-handed.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “I’m not going there to look for either of those…” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The various True Saints stared at each other with suspicion in their eyes. Why else would Huang Xiaolong want to head over to the All Extinguishing Holy Gate? There was nothing there, and it was a barren wasteland.

“Let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother explaining himself and he tore through the skies. He didn’t bother boarding the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, and the True Saints could only follow behind him.

He wasn’t in a hurry to refine the holy souls in his collection. After all, it wasn’t too late to swallow them after capturing several undead spirits.

As he charged through the air, Huang Xiaolong released his three holy souls to search for his targets.

After crossing the fourth tribulation, Huang Xiaolong’s holy souls had more than doubled in strength. The areas where he had failed to detect, appeared in his mind the moment he willed it.

As he approached the headquarters of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate, the concentration of death qi grew denser in the air. They seemed to form dense clouds that attempted to stop his advance.&nbsp;

However, they were completely useless as Huang Xiaolong tore through them with ease.

He didn’t bother wearing the Four Seas Holy Armor, and he didn’t use his energy to protect himself. With his physical body, he endured the corrosive abilities of the death qi.

The True Saints couldn’t help but widen their eyes in shock when they noticed Huang Xiaolong’s actions.

Did his defense progress to such a point? Even True Saints like them didn’t dare to do what Huang Xiaolong did. After all, if the death qi entered their bodies, things could get troublesome.

When they least expected it, a terrifying roar ripped through the skies as the void in the distance started to tremble.

Yu Ming and the others cried out in shock.

That was an undead spirit at the Third Heaven True Saint Realm!

When they thought that Huang Xiaolong would take a detour and hide from the undead spirit, his voice entered their minds. “Spread out and prevent anyone from approaching. I’ll head over to subdue the undead spirit.” Without waiting for them to react, Huang Xiaolong shot towards the undead spirit.

They stared at each other with a dumbfounded expression.

“What?! His Highness is going to subdue the undead spirit?!” Sun Xiang was the first to react. “That’s too dangerous! Even if he has three holy souls, the Dark Holy Ring, and the Winged Dragon Holy Ship, he won’t be able to defeat the undead spirit! Regardless of how weak it becomes, it has the strength of the Third Heaven True Saint Realm expert!”

“Let’s go!” Chen Zhi screamed in panic as he got ready to assist Huang Xiaolong.

“Hold it,” Li Huajun interrupted all of them, “Didn’t you hear His Highness’ order? He wants us to prevent anyone from entering the area.”

The other six stared at him in silence.&nbsp;

“There’s a reason for him to lay down the order. His Highness might just be able to subdue the undead spirit.” Li Huajun continued, “If he doesn’t wish to tell us the reason, wouldn’t charging over there be…?”

Terrifying waves of energy suddenly emerged from the direction Huang Xiaolong had flown towards.

Even though he was already quite a distance from them, they managed to feel the shocking strength contained in the fluctuations. Even True Saints at their level felt fear creeping up their hearts.

“Has the battle begun?” The Departing Sword Sage felt his throat going dry.

Explosions rang through the air in succession, and they reverberated in their ears.

The shockwaves of the battle spread out in waves, and their hearts jumped every time they felt something. Even though they couldn’t observe the battle for themselves, they could imagine the terrifying scene that played out.

Half an hour slowly passed and the fluctuations from the battle finally started to weaken. In the next instant, the entire battlefield fell silent.

“What’s going on? Why did they stop?” Chen Zhi’s expression changed. “Don’t tell me…”

Everyone seemed to have thought of the same possibility as their expressions changed in an instant.

According to what they knew, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t have been the undead spirit’s match. The only possibility was that Huang Xiaolong had used his treasures to withstand the assault of the undead spirit for the past half an hour. Now that the battle was over, it could only mean…

“Hurry up!”

The seven True Saints couldn’t care about Huang Xiaolong’s order as they rushed towards the battlefield.

Before they could approach, a figure shot towards them.

When they stared at the familiar figure approaching them, they discovered a massive undead spirit following behind Huang Xiaolong. Death qi rolled off the undead spirit tens of thousands of feet tall, and it looked extremely docile as it followed behind Huang Xiaolong. From the looks of it, the undead spirit was like a domesticated cat who emitted death qi. The image of a ferocious undead spirit was shattered in an instant.

They could only stare at each other in stunned silence.

Huang Xiaolong frowned when he saw them. “Why are you here? Didn’t I ask you to prevent anyone from approaching?”

The seven True Saints snapped back to reality instantly as an awkward expression appeared on their faces.

“Your Highness, we were worried for you! That’s why we came over!” The Departing Sword Sage stuttered.

Huang Xiaolong snorted softly, “There’s nothing to worry about. Since I’ve already given my order, all you have to do is to follow it.”

“Let’s go. We’re going on the hunt for more undead spirits.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t blame any of them.

Going on the hunt?!

The seven True Saints were shocked, but they could only follow behind Huang Xiaolong. No matter how they thought about it, they failed to discover the reason behind Huang Xiaolong’s ability to subdue the undead spirit. The undead spirit behind them was at the Third Heaven True Saint Realm! Even mid-level True Saints wouldn’t be able to subdue it!

Since the undead spirits didn’t have a holy soul and consciousness, it was basically impossible to subdue.

The only way to do it was if someone had absolute power to suppress it. One could refine it into a puppet after it was unable to resist.

However, it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to suppress the undead spirit with his strength!

Soon, Huang Xiaolong located the second undead spirit. Sending the True Saints out to guard the area, he entered another round of battle. However, it ended after twenty minutes. By the time he returned, there was another undead spirit behind him.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t waste any time as he went in search of the next undead spirit!

In half a day, there were four undead spirits following behind Huang Xiaolong.
