Chapter 2702: Your Friend Here Doesn’t Know the Rules

Since they admitted to their crimes, everyone who stood in the distance quickly realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a serial rapist walking along the streets. However, they were shocked when he killed them all without hesitation.

“Let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong brought the others away.

As for Teng Xiao, he remained the last in line as he walked behind the entire group.

As they looked at Teng Xiao’s posture and placement in the group, a terrifying thought flashed through their minds. The Primal Ancestor was walking so naturally behind all of them!

Could it be? Was the id*ot right?

There’s no way…

Everyone shook their heads as they tried to get rid of the thought spinning in their heads.

After Huang Xiaolong and the others left the scene, Jiang Heng, who was sent out to look for an inn, returned.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head, and he knew that something like looking for a place to stay would pose no difficulty for a Primal Ancestor. Even though there were a ton of people in the city, a Primal Ancestor was still a formidable presence.

The location Jiang Heng had found was the largest inn the Ancient Void City had to offer. It was also the most luxurious inn, and Jiang Heng had booked every single courtyard that was left unoccupied.

The inn had a pretty nice name, and it was called the Drunken Moonlight Pavilion.

The materials they had used when constructing the interior of the courtyard were the best of the best, and one couldn’t find a better place to stay in the city.

Of course, that was only applicable to ordinary people. For existences at the level of Huang Xiaolong or Long Jianfei, everything in the inn was merely better than the average residences in their palaces.

Long Jianfei laughed when he saw the Drunken Moonlight Pavilion, “There’s a monthly menu for special spiritual fruits in the pavilion… They’re pretty delicious!”

“That’s why I chose the inn!” Jiang Heng laughed.

“Indeed. The spiritual fruits here are renowned in the World River,” Mo Zhi added.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle, “Since that’s the case, we have to try some later.”

As everyone streamed into the courtyard Jiang Heng had reserved, they settled down before following Huang Xiaolong into the main hall.

Even though there were tons of people, they managed to find a seat. Just as they were walking over to one of the empty spots available, a voice rang through the hall, “Young… Young Master Long!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but look towards the source of the voice when he heard her familiar cry. A group of people strolled into the main hall and one of them was a lady with large eyes and a lovable smile.

Yun Fanger!

She was the young lady of the Rising Clouds Commerce, Yun Fanger!

When Huang Xiaolong had first met her, he had entered the World River for the first time. The second time he had met her was when he had emerged from the Death Cave in the Dragon Fish City. Now that he entered the World River again, he ran into her for the third time!

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly. It seemed as though they were fated to meet each other.

Ever since they had parted ways in the Dragon Fish City, more than eighty years had passed.

Since they had last met, she had become a little more mature and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but notice that her breasts had grown slightly larger.

Of course, he had no other thoughts in his mind, and he was merely appreciating her beauty.

When she saw Long Jianfei beside Huang Xiaolong, she couldn’t help but feel a trace of fear, “Senior Long!”

Long Jianfei nodded his head as his impression of her was pretty good to begin with.

“Young Master Long, this is my father!” Yun Fanger seemed to have thought of something, and she quickly introduced the middle aged man beside her.

Yun Bitian, the chairman of the Rising Clouds Commerce, was someone whose words held a lot of weight in the Otherworldly Mansion. He was pretty strong, at the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm.

Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly as he felt the need to express his greetings. After all, the man was Yun Fanger’s father.

With his identity as the Mansion Master of the Otherworldly Mansion, there was no need for him to greet a True Saint. However, he did it anyway.

However, Chairman Yun Bitian couldn’t help but frown when he noticed that the other party greeted him with a mere nod of the head.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Fanger, is this your friend? He doesn’t seem to know the rules…,” one of the ladies beside Yun Fanger spoke all of a sudden. She was a beauty in her own right, and her appearance was similar to Yun Fanger. Instead of being cute like Yun Fang’er, she was a charming individual and she had a cool-beauty vibe. She stared at Huang Xiaolong with a look of disgust.

Yun Fanger’s expression changed the moment she heard what her sister said. A trace of panic flashed in her eyes as she knew Long Jianfei’s identity. Even though she wasn’t qualified to know about Huang Xiaolong, she knew that Long Jianfei was the ancestor of the Dragon Fish Race!

The events that had happened in the past played out in her mind again.

“Young Master Long, I’m very sorry! This is my older sister and she didn’t mean to be rude!” Yun Fanger quickly apologized to Huang Xiaolong.

Older sister? That would mean that she was Yun Ke’er!

Yun Ke’er’s expression sunk when she heard Yun Fanger apologizing to Huang Xiaolong. “Second sister, what do you mean by this? Your friend from the human race is extremely disrespectful to his senior, and he’s being rude to our father! How can you side with an outsider?!”

Her disdain for humans was obvious.

As someone from the Alien Lands, there was never a time when she had to speak nicely to humans. After all, they were slaves to the members of the Alien Race.

As such, she couldn’t help but feel a trace of rage when she noticed Huang Xiaolong’s disrespect for her father.

When Long Jianfei and the other Primal Ancestors heard what she said, their expressions darkened.

“Young Master Long, my older sister, she…,” Yun Fanger panicked as she tried to explain herself.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong interrupted her, “It doesn’t matter.” After he spoke, he brought Long Jianfei and the others towards the empty seat.

A feeling of guilt and unrest filled Yun Fanger’s heart when she saw Huang Xiaolong’s departing figure. Without Huang Xiaolong’s explicit instructions, she didn’t dare to reveal his identity, even to her father!

Seeing as his daughters were about to get into a fight with each other, Yun Bitian couldn’t help but feel a trace of doubt. However, he didn’t think too much about it. After all, he had invited a big shot from the World River for tea!

There was no need for him to care about the human who disrespected him.

Moreover, he had long since reserved a spot in the main hall.

Ignoring Huang Xiaolong’s party, he brought his daughters over to the seat he had reserved.

“Let’s go! He’s just a brat from the human race. There’s nothing for you to feel sorry about.” Yun Ke’er dragged her sister towards their table when she saw that Yun Fanger was still staring in Huang Xiaolong’s direction.

A sigh escaped her lips. Even though her father had managed to invite a big shot from the World River, this person he had invited, She Mu, was just a patriarch to a race subordinate to the Dragon Fish Race!

She Mu eventually appeared at the entrance of the hall, and Yun Bitian’s expression changed when he noticed the presence of the big shot he relied on. He rushed out of the hall instantly to greet She Mu.
