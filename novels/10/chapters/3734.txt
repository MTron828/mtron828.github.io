Chapter 3735: Universe Source

 

A single slap from Huang Xiaolong sent all three of them flying.

When they slammed into the Star Refinement King’s palace below, it exploded into countless fragments.

When Huang Xiaolong met the Heaven Devouring King and Golden Cymbals King back in the Unknown Space, he was unable to stand against the Heaven Devouring King no matter how hard he tried. Now, he was able to trash them without using one-tenth of his strength.

The Star Refinement King who wanted to go in for the kill stared at the three of them in shock. His heart thumped in his chest as he swung his Star Fan once again. Countless stars fell from the void and it slammed into the Star Dragon Grand Formation.

With the endless amount of stars smashing into the formation, the light barrier became much dimmer than before.

After all, the Star Refinement King was an expert who crossed the 29 billion mark. With a universe treasure to supplement his strength, he was no walkover.

Right before he could unleash another strike, boundless star dragon qi emerged from the void. The barrier that looked a little weaker than before recovered to its peak state.

The Star Refinement King’s expression changed.

He gave it his all during the strike previously, but the Star Dragon Grand Formation restored itself before he could continue! It was obvious that he wasn’t going to shatter the formation.

Huang Xiaolong appeared before him with a single step. As the Star Refinement King was still stuck in a state of shock, he swung his Star Fan without a second thought. Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother dodging and his punch landed squarely on the Star Refinement King’s chest.

In front of everyone, Huang Xiaolong popped the Star Refinement King’s heart.

The Heaven Devouring King and the others gasped in fright.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the Star Refinement King any longer as he turned to look at Heaven Tyrant.

Fear could be seen deep in his eyes and just as he was about to turn to flee, Huang Xiaolong dragged him over. Too lazy to ask his question, Huang Xiaolong directly conducted a soul search.

Moments later, Huang Xiaolong learned where the Black Nether King was. However, he was shocked by his discovery. According to Heaven Tyrant’s memory, Old Man Fortune left in search of the Universe Origin. When the Black Nether King heard of it, he used all the connections he had to uncover the location of the Universe Origin before heading there too.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank.

It was no wonder Old Man Fortune didn’t show up during the battle.

Similarly, the Black Nether King didn’t activate the Extermination Formation on time. 

As it turned out, the two of them went in search of the Universe Origin!

The Universe Origin was said to be the birthplace of the Thirteen Universes.

According to the legends, that was where all the universe treasures came from, along with all thirteen universes.

The Universe Origin was akin to the mother of all things!Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

According to even more rumors, there were special energies that existed in the Universe Origin. There were high-level grand dao laws and a special method to break through to the Universe God Realm.

Naturally, that was just a rumor. No one had been able to enter the Universe Origin.

“Universe Origin…” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled.

Without the Universe Source Stone, the Black Nether King would find it impossible to break through. However, he might actually find a way to do it after locating the Universe Origin!

He might even be able to locate a fortuitous encounter and enter the Universe God Realm immediately!

Huang Xiaolong was sure that the Black Nether King wouldn’t be able to break through no matter what he tried, but now that the Universe Origin was located, he wasn’t so sure anymore.

Moreover, there was the Old Man Fortune. His chances of entering the Universe God Realm might be even smaller than the Black Nether King, but nothing was set in stone! 

No matter who broke through, it would spell doom for Huang Xiaolong.

As such, he had to locate the Universe Origin before any of them!

However, Heaven Tyrant might know that his master went to look for the Universe Origin, but he had no idea where it actually was!

The only question in Huang Xiaolong’s mind now was to locate the Universe Origin!

He thought about the Submerged Dragon Institution in the Star Dragon World.

Since the Star Dragon Universe was one of the most ancient existences it might know where the Universe Origin was!

If the Star Dragon Universe didn’t know, Huang Xiaolong could only use all the resources available to him to look for it.

Two years later, Huang Xiaolong arrived back in the Submerged Dragon Institution.

When the Star Dragon Universe met Huang Xiaolong again, it was overjoyed! However, the Star Dragon Universe was stunned to discover his intentions.

“You wish to go to the Universe Origin?” 

“Senior Star Dragon Universe, do you know where it is?” Huang Xiaolong asked anxiously.

“I do, but…” 

Huang Xiaolong rejoiced in his heart. Indeed, the Star Dragon Universe knew where the Universe Origin was!

“There’s no need to get excited. It is extremely difficult to get there.” The Star Dragon Universe explained, “The Universe Origin exists outside the Thirteen Universes. There are countless layers of barriers standing between the two. For one to arrive at the Universe Origin, one will have to cross countless world barriers. They aren’t exactly easy to overcome…”

“World barriers?” Huang Xiaolong gasped.

He didn’t expect the Universe Origin to be located outside the Thirteen Universes.

“Yes. In order to arrive, you will need to break through three thousand natural world barriers.” The Star Dragon Universe continued, “The closer you get, the stronger the barrier. Without 29 billion units of combat strength, you won’t be able to enter.”

29 billion units?

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

“Does that mean that anyone with more than 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy can arrive at the Universe Origin?”

“Yes.”

Circulating all three great worlds in his body at once, boundless energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Star Dragon Universe stared at him in shock.

“You… You have already broken…”

It didn’t expect that in the millions of years that Huang Xiaolong was gone, he would reach the half-step Universe God Realm! It knew that Huang Xiaolong had three great worlds, and as such, his grand cosmos energy definitely reached the 30 billion mark!

“Senior Star Dragon Universe, I should be able to arrive at the Universe Origin with my strength, right?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Of… Of course…”
