Chapter 3633 – Breaking Through

The storm had the power to end worlds! Despite the terrifying defensive abilities of the Universe Boat, it started to sway back and forth!

The three great worlds in Huang Xiaolong’s body were like suns that glowed with the intensity of a billion stars. The golden light they emitted could blind even the strongest of men!

Several hours passed as the three great worlds in his body trembled non-stop.

Terrifying might filled the Universe Boat.

Luckily for him, Huang Xiaolong broke through in the grand formation in the Universe Boat. As it was separated from the outside world, Huang Xiaolong didn’t cause a ruckus out there. Otherwise, the storm would definitely shake up the regions around the Limitless Land!

Huang Xiaolong became at least two times stronger than before!

The aura he emitted shot up like a rocket.

It continued for an entire world before slowly slowing down.

The golden light around his body slowly receded.

Several days passed and Huang Xiaolong finally opened his eyes. Sucking in a long breath, a flash of joy crossed his eyes. After more than eight hundred thousand years of cultivation in the second layer of formations in the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong finally entered the grand completion stage of the God of Creation Realm!

Before breaking through, his grand cosmos energy was stuck under the 21 billion mark! Now that he did, he finally tore through the invisible barrier!

As for the hidden impurities in his body, he cleared them all!

He only managed to regain his calm after a few moments.

Retrieving the universe-level spiritual veins he had left, he discovered that there were more than six hundred of them left!

Throwing all of them into the eye of the formation, Huang Xiaolong decided to replenish the amount of universe source qi in the second layer of formation.

A bitter smile appeared on his face when he thought about his feelings before entering seclusion. When he looked at the spiritual veins he had in the past, he felt like a wealthy man. Now, he realized that they weren’t enough!

At the very most, he would be able to supply enough universe source qi for the next hundreds of thousands of years.

Without leaving the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong continued to cultivate.

More than three hundred thousand years passed…

When he refined all the universe source qi, he finally emerged from the Universe Boat.

His seclusion lasted more than 1.5 million years from the time he subdued the Limitless Land, and he not only broke through to the grand completion stage. He also managed to accumulate 23 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

As soon as he emerged, he summoned Wu Xin and Ye Ye to ask about the changes in the Limitless Land.

Very quickly, he received all the reports.

“Lord, the ancestor of the Jian Family broke through. The grand cosmos energy in his body transformed, and his combat abilities surpassed the 20 billion mark.” Ye Ye seemed to have thought of something and he sighed, “The matter shook the Unknown Space and he has been crowned as the sixth supreme overlord!”

“Oh? Jian Wushuang broke through?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback by the news.

“Yes. He broke through nearly five hundred thousand years ago.” Wu Xin explained. “After breaking through, he entered seclusion immediately. He only managed to emerge several days ago, and the Jian Family is planning for a celebratory ceremony.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head.

It was natural for the Jian Family to celebrate such a heaven shaking matter. After all, becoming one of the supreme overlords was no small achievement!

Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts couldn’t help but turn to Tao Han’er. She was brought away by the experts of the Jian Family previously but he didn’t know how she was doing.

“How is Tao Han’er’s situation in the Jian Family?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but ask.

Before entering seclusion, Huang Xiaolong requested for them to pay some attention to Tao Han’er.

“She is heavily regarded in the Jian Family. Moreover, her talent is nothing to scoff at. The Jian Family has been giving her all the resources she needs. After so many years, she has already broken through to the Dao Venerable Realm. She is currently a Second Esteem Dao Venerable, and her comprehension of the sword dao is extremely high! Jian Wushuang intends to impart his knowledge to her.” Wu Xin replied respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

When the members of the Jian Family brought her away, Huang Xiaolong didn’t say anything as he knew that they would treat her well.

However, Jian Wushuang’s intention to impart his cultivation to her surprised Huang Xiaolong.

Tao Han’er might be his granddaughter, but Jian Wushuang had countless descendants! There were quite a number of them with decent talent, but since Tao Han’er had been chosen by him, her future was limitless!

Huang Xiaolong asked about matters regarding the Zhu Family soon.

“Get someone to bring Tao Hang over from the Yin Yang City.” Huang Xiaolong ordered.

“Tao Hang?” Wu Xin raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Who in the world was Tao Hang?”

“In the past, he was hunted down by the members of the Tao Family and seeked refuge in the Golden Sea City. He saved Tao Han’er, and he can be considered her foster father. He’s currently residing in the Yin Yang City.” Huang Xiaolong explained.

Wu Xin understood Huang Xiaolong’s intentions immediately. He bowed before sending down the order to bring Tao Hang over.

“Zhu Lan Land…” Huang Xiaolong said all of a sudden as he turned to look in their direction.

Since he was done with the Limitless Land, he planned to head over to the Zhu Lan Land.

Even without Tao Han’er’s matter, he would definitely be taking a trip down there.

The Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen might be known as the five supreme overlords in the Unknown Space, but they weren’t at the same level. From what Wu Xin said, Huang Xiaolong learned that Zhu Chen was the weakest of the five.

Zhu Chen’s combat prowess should be close to the 22 billion unit mark.

As for the strongest, it was said to the the Ferocious Devil.

No one knew how strong he actually was. Not even Zhu Chen and the other supreme overlords know how strong he was. That was because no one had ever forced the Ferocious Devil to go all out! Whatever the case, they knew that the Green Ghost who was ranked second among them had combat abilities close to an expert with 25 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

The Dragon Overlord was ranked third, and the God of Death was ranked after that. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Huang Xiaolong estimated his strength and realized that he was probably as strong as the God of Death if he didn’t use any of his treasures. If he used all four universe treasures, he would definitely be able to suppress the God of Death!

As for the Dragon Overlord who ranked third, Huang Xiaolong felt that there was quite a bit of distance between them. As such, if he were to reveal his strength, he would immediately push the God of Death down to fifth place!
