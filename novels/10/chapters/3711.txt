Chapter 3712: Meeting the Star Refining King

It was a pretty sight as night fell on the Snow Continent.

Standing in the air above the lands, Huang Xiaolong watched streaks of light flashing on the horizon.

From Bi Qing, he learned that the Star Refining King sent him over to look for a bunch of experts who were adept in the art of formations. He was to bring them back to the Jade Sea Palace to await his instructions.

Bi Qing had no idea what his master needed them for, but Huang Xiaolong was able to make the connection.

If he wasn’t mistaken, the Star Refinement King wanted to use the batch of slaves to lay down the Extermination Formation!

Did the Black Nether King teach the Star Refinement King the way to lay down the grand formation?!

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong continued to comprehend the Nameless Devil Mirror. At the same time, he wanted to collect all the universe-level spiritual veins he could.

According to the Ferocious Devil’s guesses, the Black Nether King would be able to activate the Extermination Formation within a million years. He needed to break through the barrier to enter the half-step Universe God before that in order to challenge the Black Nether King!

It was too difficult for him to do anything like it! Even with the Universe Boat, he didn’t even dare to dream of it! He might have the Universe Transformation Art and the universe source qi to assist him, but it was just too difficult! The only way was to obtain an endless amount of top-grade universe-level spiritual veins!

That was the only way he could break through smoothly to the half-step Universe God Realm!

Yin Xue was someone who ranked in the top twenty of the Universe First Race. The resources she owned were shocking! She had nearly everything under the sun, but Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover that there wasn’t a single universe-level spiritual vein in the treasury!

When he asked her, he discovered that several hundred thousand years ago, the Black Nether King gave the order to hand over all the universe-level spiritual veins they had!

“Other than the Snow Continent, there isn’t a single spiritual vein to be found anywhere else?!” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Bi Qing and the others nodded in response.

A frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. He didn’t think that that would happen. That would mean that he wouldn’t be able to cultivate effectively and break through within a million years!

Huang Xiaolong could guess what the Black Nether King needed so many spiritual veins for. In order to activate the Extermination Formation, he would need a frightening amount of energy. As such, he planned to use the spiritual veins as an energy source for the formation.

“Did all the spiritual veins go to the Black Nether King?” Huang Xiaolong asked again.

Yin Xue shook her head and sighed, “No. Lord Black Nether King got us to hand the spiritual veins over to the Jade Sea Palace.”

“Jade Sea Palace?” Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Bi Qing.

“My master retrieved all of them after they arrived.”

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

That would basically confirm his guess. The Star Refinement King was in charge of laying down the Extermination Formation!

“Star Refinement King…” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

The Star Refinement King’s combat strength has already crossed the 29 billion mark. If Huang Xiaolong didn’t use his universe treasures, he might be slightly weaker than the man. If he used everything he had, he would be able to suppress the Star Refinement King with no problems.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Suppressing was one matter, forcing the opponent to submit was another. Even if he managed to suppress the Star Refinement King, he might allow the party to escape.

If that happened, the consequences would be too serious to bear!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows were locked tightly together.

Several days later…

Huang Xiaolong left the city and headed straight for the Jade Sea Palace.

When Bi Qing and Yin Xue brought the group of slaves back to the Jade Sea Palace, the Star Refinement King would have to appear to bring them away. That would be his best shot at interacting with the Star Refinement King and Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to waste the chance.

No matter how he looked at it, the most important thing he had to do was to learn the secrets of the Extermination Formation. He would interrupt their plans by destroying the eye of the formation!

Bi Qing’s flying ship was nowhere near the speed of the Universe Boat, and they would need several years in order to arrive at the Jade Sea Palace.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t slacken off, and he continued to comprehend the mysteries of the Nameless Devil Mirror.

Several years later…

“Lord, we have arrived!” Bi Qing made a report when Huang Xiaolong was still deep in meditation.

Opening his eyes slowly, Huang Xiaolong emerged from the flying ship. He walked over to the bow of the ship and saw an endless sea that was jade green in color under them. There were countless palaces on the surface of the sea, and there were bubbles that shone with a multitude of lights hovering in the air.

One would discover countless images if one looked closely at the bubbles.

The Jade Sea had a different charm than the Snow Continent. It gave off an air of freedom that soothed the soul. It was especially so for the bubbles that existed above the sea. It was no wonder Yin Xue said that her Snow Continent was incomparable to that of the Jade Sea.

A few hours later, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the palace. Bi Qing contacted his master, the Star Refinement King, and quickly got a reply.

“My master said that he is caught up with something right now, and he will only be able to return after a year,” Bi Hai said.

“One year…” Huang Xiaolong muttered. He wasn’t in a rush. He could take the time to control the experts in the region.

Soon after, he got Bi Qing to gather the experts of the Jade Sea, and he controlled them quickly.

A year later, the Star Refinement King returned.

He was a shorty, and his height didn’t even reach the 1.5 meters mark! His facial features were ordinary, and there was nothing special about him. No one would think that he was the Star Refinement King if he walked along the streets.

Huang Xiaolong followed a batch of humans, and they made their way over to the Star Refinement King.

Looking at the batch of slaves that was brought to him, the Star Refinement King looked at Bi Qing and praised, “This batch isn’t too bad.”

“Many thanks to master!”

Soon after, the Star Refinement King tested them in the art of arrays. When they finally reached his required standard, he brought them away from the palace.
