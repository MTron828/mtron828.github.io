Li Qingyang’s expression revealed the doubt in his heart, “You mean...?”

Zhao Wuya flashed a wicked smile, “I’ve just received news that Wei Chao also arrived in South Huai City two days ago.”

Li Qingyang’s eyes lit up, “Junior Brother is referring to one of the Berserk Lion Sect’s Three Swords, Wei Chao!”

Dralion Island had two top prominent forces, one of them was the Golden Dragon Gate while the other was none other than the Berserk Lion Sect.

These two prominent sects controlled almost ninety percent of Dralion Island’s forces. Comparing based on their strength, the Berserk Lion Sect was many times more powerful than the Elephant Genesis Sect and Barbarian God Sect.

And among the younger generation of the Berserk Lion Sect, there were three famous genius disciples, known as The Three Swords!

This Wei Chao that Zhao Wuya mentioned was precisely one of The Three Swords, and also the Berserk Lion Sect Chief’s personal disciple.

Zhao Wuya continued as the smile on his face widened, “That’s him, one of the Berserk Lion Sect’s Three Swords, Wei Chao! Huang Xiaolong comprehended all the heritage tablets at the Primordial Celestial Shrine, thus it is very likely he obtained some sort of chaos herb. We only need to release news that he has a chaos herb on him and... hehe!”

Li Qingyang let out a burst of hearty laughter, “It is still Junior Brother who’s more fastidious. Wei Chao is an arrogant and reckless person. We need to tread on eggshells around Huang Xiaolong, but Wei Chao doesn’t need to; with his identity and personality, he need not put the Barbarian God Sect in his eyes.”

“Wei Chao is at the Berserk Lion Sect Branch at the moment, should we go pay him a visit now?” Zhao Wuya smiled suggestively, “And tell him the good news?”

Li Qingyang joined in on the laughter, “This kind of good news, of course we have to tell him as soon as possible, Wei Chao will definitely thank us.”

Without further delay, the two of them walked out, heading toward the Berserk Lion Sect Branch.

Inside the main hall of the Berserk Lion Sect Branch sat a striking young man with a devilish charm and bright upturned eyes that told of his proud confidence.

This young man was one of the Berserk Lion Sect’s Three Swords, Wei Chao.

Wei Chao was sitting in the main hall when a subordinate entered, reporting to him that the Elephant Genesis Sect’s Li Qingyang came to pay a visit. Wei Chao was feeling doubtful, for Li Qingyang wasn’t someone he usually associated with.

“Let them in.” Wei Chao ordered solemnly, emphasizing on the ‘let’ and not ‘invite.’ There were numerous cultivators on the surrounding islands, but there were not many people that were qualified of being invited by him.

“Yes, Senior Brother Wei Chao.” That subordinate complied, returning a short while later while leading Li Qingyang and Zhao Wuya into the hall.

Li Qingyang furtively noticed that Wei Chao was still seated when he walked in and didn’t even bother standing up to greet him, putting Li Qingyang in a sour mood. Regardless, he was an Elephant Genesis Sect Elder and was currently in charge of the entire Elephant Genesis Sect Branch of the South Huai City. A person with his identity, no matter where they went, they would be respectfully welcomed.

Then again, this Wei Chao was indeed as rumored, extremely arrogant.

Following a step behind Li Qingyang, a faint frown also appeared on Zhao Wuya’s brows, but quickly disappeared.

“Speak, what’s your purpose in coming to see me?” Wei Chao spoke, going straight to the subject. He didn’t even bother with perfunctory greetings.

Pressing down the anger in his heart, Li Qingyang chuckled on the surface, “We’re here today because we have good news for Little Brother Wei Chao.”

Wei Chao looked calm, unaffected by the offer, “Oh, and what good news are you referring to?”

Li Qingyang laughed, “I’ve just received news that the Barbarian God Sect’s Huang Xiaolong is here in South Huai City.”

“Huang Xiaolong!” Wei Chao’s half-closed eyes suddenly widened, a piercing light flickered across his pupils.

As one of the Berserk Lion Sect’s Three Swords, Wei Chao naturally heard of Huang Xiaolong. Even though he was one of three Berserk Lion Sect’s top geniuses, the godhead he condensed was only high grade king rank. When rumors started flying around that Huang Xiaolong had a top grade king rank Blue Shadow Godhead, Wei Chao was annoyed.

“Yes, that Huang Xiaolong. He successfully comprehended all one hundred heritage tablets at the Primordial Celestial Shrine and was rewarded with a chaos herb.” Li Qingyang smiled deepened, “It’s inconvenient for us to make a move against Huang Xiaolong due to his identity, which is why we came to deliver this news to Little Brother Wei Chao.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Wei Chao’s eyes narrowed into slits, a sneer sounded from his mouth, “So you want to borrow my hands to kill Huang Xiaolong?”

Despite Wei Chao’s words, there were no changes in Li Qingyang’s face, “We indeed have the intention of borrowing Little Brother Wei Chao’s hands to kill Huang Xiaolong, but Little Brother Wei Chao also had such intentions already, did you not? Don’t you want to obtain that chaos herb from Huang Xiaolong?”

Wei Chao’s expression turned frosty in an instant, his cold gaze fixed on Li Qingyang and Zhao Wuya, causing their hearts to inexplicably tighten.

Suddenly, Wei Chao burst into laughter, echoing through the hall.

“Go, bring out the good wine I’ve kept.” When Wei Chao stopped laughing, he instructed the disciple standing on the side, “I need to have a good drink with these two friends.”

At this moment, Li Qingyang and Zhao Wuya breathed out silently in relief, wondering if the coldness that slithered down their backs moments ago was just an illusion.

This madman!

Soon after good wine arrived, sounds of cups clinking in toasts rang in the hall.

“Brother Wei Chao, I’m telling you, there’s probably a late-Tenth Order, maybe even a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm hidden expert at that Huang Xiaolong’s side. Before you make any moves, it’d be best to plan in detail.” said Zhao Wuya.

But Wei Chao nonchalantly waved his hand saying, “Frankly speaking, during this trip here, I came with our sect’s Three Evil Seniors.”

The Three Evils!

Li Qingyang and Zhao Wuya shivered inwardly, shocked by the news.

Each of the Berserk Lion Sect’s Three Evils was a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm expert. It goes without saying that they were formidable, there were rumors going around that the Three Evils together were invincible below the Ancient God Realm.

Neither Li Qingyang nor Zhao Wuya expected the Three Evils to appear in South Huai City at this opportune time.

“So the Three Evil Seniors are also here.” Li Qingyang grinned confidently, “With the three Seniors’ help, we can sleep soundly trusting Huang Xiaolong won’t be able to escape!”

Wei Chao chuckled proudly, “That is only natural, then again, if that kid remains in the city, it is inconvenient for us to act.”

Zhao Wuya smiled, “Brother Wei Chao need not worry, I discovered that Huang Xiaolong is only passing through South Huai City and will be leaving in a few days.”

Wei Chao laughed, “That’s good.”

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong was sitting cross-legged in the air, his body enshrouded in various brilliant lights representing water, wood, metal, earth, fire, lightning, wind, ice, darkness, and light. These energies swirled and merged around Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Boundless dragon force and Buddhism energy formed a sea of dragons and golden Buddhas around him.

Huang Xiaolong’s aura continued to rise.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed.

The figure sitting cross-legged in the air was suddenly enveloped by a radiant light, causing the godforce of various elements to glimmer brightly, exuding a terrifying pressure.

Subsequently, the dragon force and Buddhism energy shrunk back into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Everything returned to tranquil peace.

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes and stretched out his arms, causing popping noises to come out from joints akin to thunder.

He finally broke through to Fifth Order Heavenly God Realm!

Eight years remained until his battle with Chen Hao. It was enough time for him to advance to Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm.

This added to Huang Xiaolong’s good mood.

Stepping out from his room, he saw that the sky outside was still dark.

However, worrying about the Nine Petals Spiritual Lightning Lotus, he quickly called for Xiaoniū and left the residence.

Although both the flying ship and sea ship could ferry passengers to Dralion island, Huang Xiaolong picked the former transportation just for its speed.

When he boarded the flying ship heading for Dralion island, Wei Chao, Li Qingyang, and Zhao Wuya received the news in the shortest time.
