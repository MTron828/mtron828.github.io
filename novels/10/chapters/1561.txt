After Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel stood up, the faces of the members of the Brightness Emperor Palace changed drastically.

They were extremely clear that these two beasts would wipe the floor with them as soon as they started fighting.

At this moment, the little cow ordered, “Get them out of here. Roll them out of the gates of Devil Tiger City!”

Hearing the little cow order Xiang Xun to make them roll from the restaurant to the city gates, they felt a trace of anger and fear in their heart.

How far was the distance between the restaurant and the city gates? If they were to roll all the way out, their reputation would go down the drain! Back at the Heaven Eye Mountain Range, there wasn’t anyone present to watch their wretched appearances as they had rolled off the mountain. However, they were currently in the Devil Tiger City where there were millions of people!

The anxious and angry Tian Ziyi couldn’t hold it in any longer. He pointed at the little cow and started to curse, “How dare you little deformed cow order someone to humiliate someone from the Brightness Emperor Palace?! We are Elders in the Brightness Emperor Palace and you have the guts to treat us like this?! Huang Xiaolong, if you go through with your actions, the Brightness Emperor Palace will never let you off! Even if your master or Fang Gan come knocking in the future, they won’t be able to save you!”

Bai Yunxiang screamed in fury, “You damn cow, I’m going to feed you to the dogs as soon as I get my hands on you! Huang Xiaolong, you better think carefully of the consequences! Even the disciples of the Grandmist Emperor Palace wouldn’t dare to do something like this! You’re just a little disciple from the Fortune Emperor Palace... You had better think twice about your actions!”

Their furious yells reverberated through the entire restaurant.

Jiang Hong, who had been indifferent the whole time, suddenly frowned when he heard them cursing and swearing at the little cow. Since when did two measly elders from the Brightness Emperor Palace get the authority to point and yell at Senior Azure Cow?!

Not to mention the fact that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t simply a member of the Fortune Emperor Palace. He was also his junior brother! He was a disciple of the King of Grandmist as well!

Jiang Hong, who didn’t want to intervene in the first place, couldn’t help but step in. “The two of you better apologize to Senior Azure Cow and my junior brother right now!”

When Tian Ziyi heard the warning, he burst into maniacal laughter, “Apologize? Who the hell are you? Why should I apologize to your junior brother? Is Huang Xiaolong your junior brother? What kind of nobody is he?! Who does the cow think she is?! Who the f*ck are you to demand an apology from me?!”

When Tian Ziyi and Bai Yunxiang noticed Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu’s respectful behavior towards Jiang Hong, they had tried to guess his identity. However, after realizing that Jiang Hong was Huang Xiaolong’s senior brother, their suspicion disappeared.

After all, the two of them had the backing of the Brightness Emperor Palace, the second ranked Emperor Palace in the Divine World. There weren’t many people in the Divine World capable of standing up to them.

Xiang Xun, Feng Er and the rest of them were stunned silly when they heard Tian Ziyi’s insult. Tain Ziyi was ignorant, but they knew Jiang Hong’s true identity. They couldn’t believe their ears as Tian Ziyi’s insults grew more and more preposterous.

Even in the Divine World, there wouldn’t be more than a few people who could look down on Jiang Hong.

Jiang Hong’s face sank.

Huang Xiaolong then intervened, “Senior brother, please don’t dirty your hands by dealing with them.”

It was true. With Jiang Hong’s identity, there was no need for him to feel insulted by Tian Ziyi’s provocations.

Thinking that they were merely putting up an act in front of him, Tian Ziyi sneered, “Keep showing off...”

“I want you to burn all their clothes before making them roll all the way to the city gates.” Huang Xiaolong turned around and ordered Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel.

“Yes, Master!” Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel nodded respectfully.

The faces of Tian Ziyi and the rest turned unsightly in the next second. If they were to roll from the restaurant to the city gates naked, their reputation as elders in the Brightness Emperor Palace would disappear! How were they going to face other experts in the future?!

“Huang Xiaolong, you wouldn’t dare!” Tian Ziyi shouted out in shock.

Just as Bai Yunxiang was planning to threaten them with the Brightness Emperor Palace again, the Chaos Black Camel reached out and a terrifying wave of godforce locked all of them in their place. No matter how hard they tried to struggle free, they failed.

Xiang Xun slowly opened his mouth and a raging ball of hellfire shot towards the immobile group of people in the sky.

As the dark hellfire engulfed them, their clothing burned away into nothingness and their naked bodies were displayed to the world.

Feng Er’s face flushed red as she hastily turned away.

As for Xu Baisheng, his gaze started to roam around and he clicked his tongue, “It seems like the few of them have the capabilities to be arrogant. Their tool looks pretty impressive.”

Lei Budong and Feng Chen couldn’t control their laughter any longer and the alcohol they were drinking splashed out towards Tian Ziyi and the others.

As they were still suspended in mid air, Tian Ziyi, Bai Yunxaing and the rest glared at Huang Xiaolong. If looks could kill, Huang Xiaolong would have died many times over.

Without wasting any more time, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel clapped outwards and sealed the godforce of Tian Ziyi and the rest. When everyone’s godforce was successfully sealed, they waved their arms and sent all of them rolling out of the restaurant. They rolled down the winding path in the city and made their way to the city gates.

Since Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel held themselves back, the speed at which Tian Ziyi and the rest were sent rolling couldn’t be considered to be quick. By the time they arrived at the city gates, they would have spent four to five hours of their time.

The moment Tian Ziyi and the disciples of the Brightness Emperor Palace emerged from the restaurant, commotion broke out in the streets.

“Aren’t those the people from Brightness Emperor Palace?!”

“It sure is! They were together with the city lord earlier... What’s going on? What are they doing?”

“I didn’t expect the members Brightness Emperor Palace to have such unique hobbies...”

“Their godforce is sealed. It seems like they have offended an expert. Haha! Serves them right for being so arrogant!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The disciples of the devil sects broke out in discussion and some of them laughed and mocked Tian Ziyi and the rest. Some took pleasure in their misfortune, but there were also others who were puzzled. There were even a few people who became suspicious of the actions of the members of the Brightness Emperor Palace.

There were some people who wanted to step forward to help, but they were all sent flying by the seal Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel had left in the bodies of the rolling ‘balls’.

Meanwhile, back in the restaurant, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu looked at the group who just rolled out of the restaurant and they rejoiced a little in their heart. However, a trace of fear soon took root in their heart. If they had followed Tian Ziyi’s lead earlier, they might have been rolling out together with him now! If that were to happen, they might as well smash their heads into a wall in an attempt to commit suicide. At the very least, it would be less embarrassing than rolling across the city naked.

A while later, Wang Shuchen and Wang Shuyu turned to Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong to say their farewells. Before they left, they didn’t forget to emphasise their promise to deliver Wu Chao to their Palace Master for punishment.

After they left, the little cow told Huang Xiaolong, “From my point of view, we should have just killed them.”

Huang Xiaolong replied, “Are you going to be the one to take action?”

She then laughed cheekily, “Are you willing to let this old lady dirty her hands?”

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes and didn’t bother replying to her.

A few hours later, Tian Ziyi and the rest of them finally stopped in front of the Devil Tiger City gate. After stopping, they roared madly at the sky in a fit of rage and the malevolent expression on their face revealed their intense hatred for Huang Xiaolong.
