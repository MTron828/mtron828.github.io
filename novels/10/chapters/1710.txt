Mao Shu and the rest completed their oath, and Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of relief sweep through his heart. He then instructed Tai Yue and the rest to prepare the celebratory feast.

It wasn’t a mere simple celebration. Instead, it was a celebration on a grand scale.

They had successfully killed several hundred Emperor Realm experts from the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and the Howling Moon Wolf Race. Despite there being casualties on the side of the Netherworld King’s Organization, they were almost negligible. Huang Xiaolong felt extremely satisfied.

After swallowing the Crystal Devil Sect, the sixth-ranked superpower, and tens of other massive superpowers, the strength of the Netherworld King’s Organization had doubled.

After taking the massive loss, the Massacring Gods Gate, Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, and the Howling Moon Wolf Race wouldn’t be able to raise waves anytime soon.

The celebration feast lasted for a long time, and it only ended deep into the night.

Huang Xiaolong stood in the courtyard of the Netherworld King’s Organization’s branch, and he slowly took out the Nine Yin Magic Mirror. Initially, he had planned to kill Shi Yinyu using his clan’s inheritance treasure. However, Huang Xiaolong had changed his mind after obtaining the Radiance Divine Scepter and the Heavenly Hall.

After all, he was pretty weak. He didn’t want to expose the fact that he owned the Nine Yin Magic Mirror.

His thoughts slowly drifted, and he thought about how he would head over to the Blank Ant Clan and the Demonic Bone Clan’s headquarters to exterminate every last one of them personally.

There were two reasons he wanted to exterminate the two races completely. Firstly, he wanted to take revenge for the Void Devil Beast Clan. Secondly, he could use the chance to give everyone else a stern warning.

Once he did that, coupled with what had happened in the Nethersea, Huang Xiaolong was sure that everyone would think twice before allying with the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe and the Massacring Gods Gate. In fact, he felt that the best-case scenario would be them alienating the two mega superpowers.

Even though the events in the Nethersea had shaken the three worlds of Hell, many of the superpowers were still sitting on the fence. They didn’t lean towards either the Netherworld King’s Organization, nor did they favor the Massacring Gods Gate.

A perfect example would be the Dark Roc Family.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had already arrived in Nirvana City for a full day, the city master didn’t even show his face to give his greetings.

Is he trying to save himself? Huang Xiaolong laughed coldly in his heart.

If he were to phrase it nicely, the Dark Roc Family was trying to save themselves. But if he were to put it bluntly, he felt that the Dark Roc Family members had no intention of accepting him as the new master of the Netherworld King’s Organization.

He was afraid that even the mega superpowers like the Misty Palace and Fengdu City felt the same way.

After playing with the mirror for some time, Huang Xiaolong kept it away before heading back into his room. He activated all the restrictions around him and took out one hundred top-grade grandmist spiritual pills from his Divine Radiance Ring. The pills were none other than the Brilliant Sun Divine Pills.

Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of refining the thirty-six holy fruits he had obtained. Instead, he planned to refine them all in one shot after dealing with the Black Ant Clan and the Demonic Bone Clan.

After calling out his three avatars, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Strands of astonishing pill qi fluctuated in the air unceasingly.

In an instant, the pill qi in the air enveloped Huang Xiaolong.

The night eventually passed.

When dawn arrived, Huang Xiaolong stopped. All one hundred Brilliant Sun Divine Pills were gone, and he could clearly feel the change in his godforce.

The Brilliant Sun Divine Pill definitely deserved its name as the supreme divine pill of the Brightness Divine World. Even though he had only refined one hundred of them, his godforce felt way purer than before.

When he emerged from his room and entered the main hall, everyone greeted him respectfully. Other than Tai Yue and the eight other Great Commanders, there were a whole bunch of Senior and Junior Commanders.

“We greet Your Majesty, the Nether King.”

After seeing that Huang Xiaolong had arrived, everyone greeted him in unison.

This was something Huang Xiaolong had personally requested. He wanted everyone in the Netherworld King’s Organization, including the sect master of the Crystal Demon Sect, Mao Shu, to address him as the Nether King.

He turned and nodded at them before allowing them to rise. He then started to give out his orders.

Even though the Massacring Gods Gate and the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had suffered a massive defeat at his hands, Huang Xiaolong still wanted to take precautions. He didn’t want to be caught off guard in case they decided to counterattack.

“Your Majesty, we received news about Chu Han leaving the Massacring Gods Gate’s headquarters immediately after receiving the news about Song Litao’s death,” Asura King Jin Yuan reported.

“Oh, Chu Han...” a chilly light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

According to Tai Yue’s estimation, Chu Han had already surpassed the Emperor Realm.

If Chu Han were to turn up to seek revenge, things might get troublesome.

“With Chu Han’s speed, how long will he take to arrive at the Nethersea?” Huang Xiaolong asked after pondering about it for a moment.

“It’s not easy to make an estimation. I’ve heard that Chu Han left by himself by entering a chaotic space. If he had really surpassed the Emperor Realm, it would probably take him one to two months to arrive here.” Tai Yue thought for a moment before replying.

“That’s too fast!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in shock.

He had never expected for an existence who had surpassed the Emperor Realm to move faster than a top-grade grandmist flying ship!

“Let’s ignore him for now. The plan to exterminate the Black Ant Clan and the Demonic Bone Clan remains the same.” Huang Xiaolong paused for a moment before continuing, “We shall head over to the Black Ant Clan in a bit. As for our movements... We shall not keep it a secret. Allow Chu Han to learn of our intentions.”

Everyone felt their jaws drop in shock.

“Your Majesty, we can’t do that! That’s too dangerous!” Desolate Giant Tai Yue yelled in shock.

Even though Huang Xiaolong possessed Eternal City, Heavenly Hall, the Radiance Divine Scepter, and had the Heart of Hell, Chu Han was someone who had possibly surpassed the Emperor Realm! No one knew if Eternal City and the Heavenly Hall could stop him!

“It’s okay. According to you guys, Chu Han might have surpassed the Emperor Realm. Even if he has, he would have barely stepped into the next realm. Huang Xiaolong shook his arm to dismiss their concerns.

Even if Chu Han had surpassed the Emperor Realm, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could deal with him.

That was because he had more than one hundred high-level Emperor Realm Undead Puppets Netherguards. He still had fourteen Radiance Angels at the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm. There were even two of them at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

When they saw that Huang Xiaolong had already made up his mind, they knew that they wouldn’t be able to shake his decision. They were only able to carry out his orders.

As soon as he was done giving out his orders, Huang Xiaolong rode on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin as he left Nirvana City.

He was advancing towards the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters, and he didn’t take too many men with him. He felt that one hundred high-level Emperor Realm guards and fourteen Radiant Angels were enough. He didn’t allow the Nine Great Commanders to follow him.

Since there were more and more powers surrendering to them, the Netherworld King’s Organization needed the Nine Great Commanders to stay at its helm.

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong left Nirvana City, Chu Han, who was using all his might to rush through chaotic space, learned of his tracks. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Heading over to the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters?” A frosty light flashed through Chu Han’s eyes.

He knew that Huang Xiaolong had already obtained the news of him rushing over to the Nethersea. Since Huang Xiaolong was running about however he liked, Chu Han knew that Huang Xiaolong didn’t care about him in the slightest.

Since you’re tired of living, you can’t blame me...

“You little brat! I will show you what it means to experience a living hell! Tao’er, rest assured. I will personally torture him to death! I will avenge you!” Chu Han roared in his mind as he broke through the chaotic space to rush towards the Black Ant Clan headquarters.
