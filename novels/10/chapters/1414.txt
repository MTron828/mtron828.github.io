Listening to the Royal Buddha’s Fortune Gate Branch’s angry clamors, Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest of Huang Xiaolong’s group felt it was funny as well. They were not going to act without Huang Xiaolong’s instruction, thus, they simply watched Liang Ming and his companions like they were watching jumping clowns.

Liang Ming raised his hand to silence the clamoring disciples.

Then, Liang Ming looked at Wang Wei and said, “Since Junior Brother Wang Wei made such suggestions, I would give you face.” He glanced at Huang Xiaolong as he went on, “As long as you kneel and kowtow a thousand times as an apology, it’s fine! I don’t need you to kneel for twenty four hours. As for your subordinate, hand him over to me, and I will take him back to the Punishment Hall for judgment. This is very fair, right?”

Wang Wei grinned. “Fair, absolutely fair. I thank Senior Brother Liang Ming.” In short, he was thanking Liang Ming for upholding his dignity by agreeing to mete Huang Xiaolong such light punishments, since it was his request.

Liang Ming nodded loftily.

Wang Wei turned to Huang Xiaolong, and urged him, “Junior Brother Huang, didn’t you hear it? Now, quickly...”

Huang Xiaolong brusquely cut him off, “Wang Wei, seeing you after such a long time, I can see that you’re no different than a dog now.”

Wang Wei dazed, but his face turned ugly in the next second.

Huang Xiaolong had insulted him, and called him a dog! A brutal glint flickered and disappeared in Wang Wei’s eyes.

Liang Ming and the other Fortune Gate’s disciples whooped in laughter. Liang Ming was still laughing as he said, “Junior Brother Wang, looks like this kid doesn’t accept your kindness ah. Would you like us to teach him a lesson on your behalf?”

Wang Wei declined gloomily, “No need, I’ll do it myself.”

In Liang Ming’s opinion, though Gui Yi had shown some strength, it was nothing to be wary of. He alone was enough to kill Huang Xiaolong and his group easily.

Liang Ming nodded. “Alright then, but don’t kill this punk’s dog-slave so fast.”

“Don’t worry.” Wang Wei reassured Liang Ming. He then took several steps closer to Huang Xiaolong until he was two meters away from him. He stood still and watched Huang Xiaolong coldly as he said, “Huang Xiaolong, I didn’t dare to do anything to you in the past, as Golden Brow and Blood Knife were covering for you in the Vientiane World, but now, here in the Royal Buddha World, do you think you can still be as brazen as in the past? Maybe you don’t know that I broke through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm more than a decade ago!”

Wang Wei proudly released his body’s momentum at the end of his sentence.

“Monstrous as your talent is, and even if you have already broken through to peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm, you’re still nothing more than an ant in my eyes; an ant that I could squash to death with a finger, anytime I want!”

Wang Wei looked at Huang Xiaolong in a lofty manner, then pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong. “Now, I will let you taste the terrifying power of a Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm!”

Wang Wei’s finger force was akin to a giant light beam that aimed to pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s chest in the blink of an eye.

Wang Wei wasn’t surprised at all that Huang Xiaolong failed to dodge his attack, but his eyes widened in disbelief in the next second as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t sent flying after taking his attack, instead, he was still standing there unscathed!

He doesn’t seem to be hurt?

“You!” Wang Wei looked at his own finger then at Huang Xiaolong’s chest. The fingerprint was still there.

Liang Ming and other Fortune Gate’s disciples were stupefied at this result.

“Is this your Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm strength?” Huang Xiaolong asked nonchalantly as he patted on the fingerprint smudge on his robe, “Now that I’ve experienced it, I have to say it really isn’t that terrifying.” His tone changed slightly as he went on, “Are you sure you’ve advanced to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm?”

Wang Wei’s face was red, almost purple from Huang Xiaolong’s taunt.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly punched out. This punch purely carried his True Dragon Physique’s force without a shred of his supreme godheads’ godforce.

Wang Wei raised his palm to block, but Huang Xiaolong’s fist hit his palm and crushed the bones of his hand. Wang Wei’s mouth was wide opened as he screamed and keeled over in pain, while his body was sent crashing into a shop’s front door on the other end of the street.

Liang Ming and the Fortune Gate’s disciples were rooted stupidly on the spot as they watched this.

They knew very well that Wang Wei had indeed broken through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm. Furthermore, Wang Wei had also mentioned that Huang Xiaolong’s strength was merely at the peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. Therefore, they were all wondering as to how Wang Wei, who was a Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm master was sent flying by a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm like Huang Xiaolong!

“You, you’re not a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm!” Liang Ming was astounded as he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders. “I never said that I’m a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm.”

Not a peak late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm!

Since he knocked out Wang Wei with a single punch, this...! Mid-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm? Late-Eighth Order Ancestor God Realm?!

But didn’t Wang Wei say that Huang Xiaolong had only entered the Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch less than forty years ago?

Forty years!

Great waves of shock hit Liang Ming and the rest of Fortune Gate’s disciples’ hearts.

At this time, Wang Wei climbed up from the street. Blood was still flowing out from his mouth as he looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, as if he was looking at a terrifying monster. In the end, he blurted out, “Impossible, impossible, absolutely impossible!”

In truth, anyone who would meet Huang Xiaolong after a gap of thirty-year would be equally shocked to discover that Huang Xiaolong had suddenly jumped from lower level of Ancient God Realm to a higher level of Ancestor God Realm strength, where he could defeat the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm Master.

Huang Xiaolong looked indifferently at Liang Ming. “Now, do I still need to kneel down and give you a thousand kowtow?”

Liang Ming kept silent and his face darkened nastily. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Punk, you are in the Royal Buddha World, so don’t be brazen!” One of the Fortune Gate’s disciples shouted angrily.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. Just as his voice fell, Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and others made their moves. Barely a second had passed, and all the twenty plus Fortune Gate’s disciples were knocked back in various directions, including the late-Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm Liang Ming.

Huang Xiaolong had no interest in beating up the Fortune Gate’s disciples anymore. He turned to the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the rest and said, “Let’s go!”

When passing by Wang Wei’s side, the little cow kicked Wang Wei right at the center, and sent him flying once again. Not a bad kick.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong had dared to fight in the city just because the strongest Ancestor of Royal Buddha World’s Fortune Gate branch was only a mid-level God King Realm master.

Therefore, with Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng on his side, Huang Xiaolong didn’t need to give face to Wang Wei and Liang Wei.

A while later, Liang Ming and the others finally got up to their feet, and looked venomously in the direction Huang Xiaolong had left.

“Huang Xiaolong, is it? If I don’t kill you, my surname isn’t Liang!” Liang Ming vowed through gritted teeth.

“Senior Brother Liang, what do we do now?” One of the disciples asked.

“Go back to the branch first!”

...

Huang Xiaolong bought a luxurious residence from a trading house, as the auction was going to take place after four months. He needed a place to stay until the auction and was obviously not short of the spirit stones.

The residence was very big, and located at the center of the city, right next to the auction house. This would make it extremely convenient to get to the auction house later.

Upon arriving at the new residence, Huang Xiaolong went straight to the room of his choice and began cultivating.

He hoped to break through to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm by the time he would have returned to the Vientiane World!

Once his cultivation would advance to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, he could then manipulate the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s core formation and enter its space for cultivation.

On top of that, if he could breakthrough to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm by that time, he could use the Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s lightning qi to expel the evil spirit from Li Lu’s body.
