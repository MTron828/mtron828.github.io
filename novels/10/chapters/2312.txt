Chapter 2313: True Reason Holy Gate!

The Holy Heavens City wasn’t located on a continent. Instead, it hovered somewhere in the air.

It was several thousand feet above the ground, and countless holy spiritual formations were laid beneath it. All of them were created by True Saint Realm experts in the Holy Heavens, and even peak-level experts at the True Saint Realm would find it hard to attack the city!

Despite their preparations, it went without saying that no True Saint was stupid enough to try something like a siege of the city.

In the Holy World, the Holy Heavens was the core, and the Holy Heavens City was the core of the core!

Huang Xiaolong stared at the city before him and light flashed in his eyes. Dense clouds of holy spiritual qi surrounded the city. They made the holy spiritual qi around the Holy Alliance Palace set up Jiang Tian look cheap.

One could only imagine Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed in the city! With the assistance of the Saint Fate memory imprint, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation would shoot up faster than sitting on a rocket! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi couldn’t help but admire the beautiful sight before them.

They weren’t the only ones who were reveling in the magnificence of the city sitting in the air before them. Even a True Saint like Di Huai had to admit that the Holy Heavens City was impressive. It was a pity he wasn’t accepted into the Holy Heavens in the past. If he could cultivate in the city, he would have already entered the Third Heavens by now! He wouldn’t need to remain stuck in the peak of the First Heaven True Saint Realm for such a long time!

Di Huai’s thoughts drifted back to the time when he had tried to enter the Holy Heavens.

After so many years, he couldn’t put down the happenings that had occurred.

“Xiaolong, let’s enter the city.” Di Huai spoke, and a trace of gratification washed over his heart. He was sure that Huang Xiaolong’s name would resound through the Holy World before he knew it.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong smiled and followed behind Di Huai.

He was finally here! He had finally arrived at the headquarters of the Holy Heavens!

They quickly made their way to one of the giant plazas located in front of the city.

Even though it was merely a plaza, it was built from one of the rare jade stone ores formed in the Holy World. The jade stones emitted pure holy spiritual qi, and a single piece alone was of astronomical value.

Of course, no matter how greedy one was, no one would be stupid enough to steal from the Holy Heavens.

They were met with crowds of people, and it was as though every race in the Holy World had gathered at the entrance of the Holy Heavens City. There were members of ancient races, along with peak experts of various super families.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had rarely noticed Fourth Tribulation half-True Saints after entering the holy ground, he was shocked to realize that tons of people around him were Fourth Tribulation half-True Saints or stronger! If he threw a stone into the crowd, it was more than likely that he would hit someone with a cultivation level higher than the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

There were even experts up to the Eighth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!

Ever since he had cultivated in the Holy River of the Emperor Yu Holy Grounds, Huang Xiaolong had realized that he could see through the cultivation level of anyone under the True Saint Realm.

“Are you surprised?” Di Huai asked.

“This is nothing. Wait till you enter the city. You’ll realize that experts are like the numerous clouds floating in the sky. Half-True Saints are everywhere. You’ll even meet low-level True Saint Realm experts occasionally.”

“In several cities in our Zhuoyuan Holy Ground, Venerables will be able to receive special treatment. They can fly through the skies and ignore most rules. However, even half-True Saints won’t be able to ignore the rules of the city here. Even Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints are no exceptions. Of course, that’s if you’re not a core disciple of the Holy Heavens.”

Di Huai led them towards the gates and explained.

Core disciples of the Holy Heavens.... Their status emerged from Di Huai’s lips once again.

Complicated light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Senior Di Huai, what about True Saint Realm experts? If True Saints of the various Holy Grounds enter the city, will they be able to experience special treatment?” Feng Tianyu asked.

It was also the question that plagued Zhang Wenyue and Xue Qi.

“It goes without saying that True Saints will be able to experience special treatment in Holy Heavens City. However, their privileges are determined by their strength. The difference in treatment between First Heaven True Saints and Second Heavens True Saints is pretty large.”

“Regardless, even peak-level True Saints are prohibited from flying in the skies above the city. The only ones who are able to fly in the city are the existences surpassing the True Saint Realm!”

A look of fear appeared in Di Huai’s eyes when he spoke of those who had surpassed the True Saint Realm.

Soon after, they approached the gates of the city. After a round of questioning and a series of identity verification, Di Huai and the others took out ten thousand holy bills each before entering the city.

“How can this be?! We have to pay ten thousand holy bills to stay in the city for a single year!

According to the regulations, the longest someone could stay in the Holy Heavens City was a single year.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly, “It’s going to be more than worth it....”

“Hahaha, that’s right! Even a single whiff of the holy spiritual qi in the air is worth ten thousand holy bills!” Di Huai laughed.

All of a sudden, the Rainbow Phoenix clinging onto Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders chirped happily and a look of satisfaction appeared on its face.

Patting its back, Huang Xiaolong said, “Alright, alright.... After I enter the Holy Heavens and become an inner disciple, I’ll buy a residence here. We won’t ever have to leave.”

“Hehe, what kind of country bumpkin are you?” A mocking voice rang out beside Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden. “Who do you think you are? You have to be really overestimating yourself if you think that you can enter the Holy Heavens! How can you dream about being an inner disciple?”

Piercing laughter rang in the skies.

Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai turned around at the same time to stare at the source of the laughter.

“True Reason Holy Gate!” Di Huai recognized them instantly and killing intent gathered in his eyes.

Feeling the hostility Di Huai had for the bunch of people, Huang Xiaolong felt a trace of shock running through his heart. He had never seen Di Huai getting angry before.

It seemed as though Di Huai really hated the members of the True Reason Holy Grounds. From what Huang Xiaolong observed, the hatred he had wasn’t small!

“That’s right! We’re from the True Reason Holy Gate!” The youngster raised a jade fan in his hand and laughed arrogantly, “Old man, your eyesight is pretty good.”

“Of course he recognizes us!” A voice boomed through the air as a middle-aged man appeared before them.

“Master.” The members of the True Reason Holy Grounds greeted the man.

As soon as the man appeared, Di Huai’s eyes turned red.

The middle-aged man was the patriarch of the True Reason Holy Gate! Walking towards Di Huai, the man chuckled, “Di Huai, it’s been too long. I’ve been looking for you all this while, and I had never thought that I would meet you here.” His gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong in the next instant. “What? Is this your disciple? Is he here to register to join the Holy Heavens?”
