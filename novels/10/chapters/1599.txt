Jiang Hong nodded to indicate that he had understood. Master’s soul force was extremely powerful, it was as easy as lifting a finger for his divine sense to cover tens of millions li radius. Hence Jiang Hong was not surprised at all when Li Tong told him that the Master had sent him to greet them.

Although he had surpassed the Emperor Realm, compared to Master, he was still too far behind.

“Let’s go see Master now.” said Jiang Hong.

“Yes, Senior Brother.” Li Tong and the others complied.

As for Huang Xiaolong, Li Lu, and the others’ identities, Li Tong did not dare to ask further. Even though he could be considered as half a steward on the Grandmist Lands, at the end of the day, he was only a steward. Whereas Jiang Hong was the King of Grandmist’s personal disciple, and it was not an exaggeration to say that Jiang Hong was the Grandmist Lands’ young lord.

Still, curiosity was bubbling inside Li Tong’s chest, why did Jiang Hong bring this group of people to the Grandmist Lands? In so many years, Jiang Hong had only brought his personal disciple Liu Rui here.

Who was this black-haired young man exactly?

Also, Li Tong had a vague feeling that cow by the black-haired young man’s side looked familiar, but he could not pinpoint where he had seen such a cow.

Huang Xiaolong and the rest followed Jiang Hong’s lead, flying towards one of the mountain peaks.

Along the way, some spiritual beasts approached Huang Xiaolong’s group, and they curiouslyscrutinized Huang Xiaolong, Li Lu, and the others with their big spirited eyes.

Upon seeing these spiritual beasts, the little guy Earth Bear ran around in excitement, raising his paw to greet them.

Huang Xiaolong felt powerless looking at the little guy’s antics.

A while later, the large group descended on one of the mountain peaks.

“The scenery here is beautiful.” Yao Chi exclaimed as she admired the surrounding views.

Every mountain, rock, tree, flower, and grass here gave people a comfortable feeling, regardless where they looked; the scenic beauty was mesmerizing.

“After so many years, this place remains the same.” The little cow sighed as she looked around, sounding melancholic.

Revisiting this place after several hundred million years, the little cow had a feeling that time was separated by two lifetimes.

Then again, her experience could indeed be considered as two lifetimes.

Li Tong and the others were stunned listening to the little cow sigh. Has this cow come here before? Li Tong couldn’t help taking a closer look at the little cow.

“The Grandmist Palace is just right in front.” Jiang Hong pointed to the front as he introduced smilingly to Huang Xiaolong. Then led Huang Xiaolong’s group flying towards the palace.

Seeing the Grandmist Palace grow bigger in their sights as they approached, Huang Xiaolong’s nervousness returned in full force.

Huang Xiaolong was nervous, so was Li Lu, Yao Chi, Xiang Xun, the Chaos Black Camel, Lei Budong, and Feng Chen.

Even though Lei Budong and Feng Chen had lived inside the Barbarians’ space for their lifetime, still, both of them had heard of the King of Grandmist from outsiders who had stumbled into the space.

Some time later, the group finally arrived in front of the Grandmist Palace.

The Grandmist Palace seemed like an ordinary palace on the surface, and there were several hundred sub-palaces. Above the main palace building, someone had written the words ‘Grandmist Palace’ with finger force.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the two words ‘Grandmist Palace’ and felt a rush of profound mysterious aura coming at him.

Although it was a simple glance, the shock it gave Huang Xiaolong reached his soul.

In the meantime, Jiang Hong had already walked through the palace’s doors. Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong pulled back his attention and quickly caught up with Jiang Hong.

The moment Huang Xiaolong stepped into the palace, he saw more than a dozen people sitting on the hall’s floor in an orderly manner. Right at the other end of the hall was an old man who looked like he was in his seventies, with robust complexion, bright spirited eyes, and a rounded nose.

The old man had a slight bit of a goatee with a physique that was neither tall nor fat, and he was walking leisurely as he preached. His voice was unhurried, yet it carried a kind of allure that one couldn’t help listening, even if they didn’t want to.

This old man was the King of Grandmist? His Master!?

Huang Xiaolong observed the King of Grandmist. Just like the little cow had previously described, judging from his appearance, the King of Grandmist was an ordinary old man. However, upon closer inspection, there was an unexplainable bearing, and this bearing made others feel an urge to worship him...!

Seeing Jiang Hong enter with a group of people, the King of Grandmist stopped preaching.

Jiang Hong hurried forward several steps, and saluted with utmost respect, “Disciple pays his respects to Master.”

The King of Grandmist stared fixedly at Jiang Hong for a good while before revealing a smile and said, “Good, you’ve finally surpassed the Emperor Realm. Looks like your Grandmist Parasitic Medium has advanced to the eighth stage?”

Jiang Hong replied respectfully, “Disciple’s success is all Master’s grace.”

At this time, the dozens of people listening to the King of Grandmist’s sermon stood up and retreated to the sides of the hall.

The King of Grandmist’s gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and others with him.

Looking at Huang Xiaolong, the King of Grandmist was slightly stunned, and his eyes soon lit up with ecstasy. “Grandmist godforce!” At a glance, he felt the grandmist godforce in Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Li Tong and several others were astounded as they stared at Huang Xiaolong.

Grandmist godforce?

Does that mean this black-haired young man has successfully cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium?

After their shock receded, Li Tong and the others were full of envy. The King of Grandmist had also taught them the Grandmist Parasitic Medium’s first stage, but they had been trying to practice it for countless years, but none of them had succeeded.

Jiang Hong explained to the King of Grandmist from the side, “Master, I met Junior Brother not long ago at the Floating Twilight Land. Not only has he succeeded in cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, but he has already advanced to the third stage!”

“What?!” Li Tong and the several others exclaimed out loud in shock.

He has actually advanced to the third stage?!

Even the King of Grandmist was taken by surprise hearing that.

Although he could sense the grandmist godforce inside Huang Xiaolong’s body, he could not tell Huang Xiaolong’s progress in cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

After snapping out from his shock, the King of Grandmist was taken over by ecstasy as he stared at Huang Xiaolong, “Excellent, excellent, I, the King of Grandmist, has another disciple!” After Jiang Hong, there had not been another person who could successfully practice the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, and he had been waiting for this day for far too long.

“Master, take a guess, how long it took Junior Brother to successfully practice the Grandmist Parasitic Medium’s first stage?” Jiang Hong asked merrily, acting mysterious.

The King of Grandmist blanked for a second, before he ventured with hesitation, “You’re saying, your Junior Brother spent less time than you did? Around ten thousand years?”

When Jiang Hong was cultivating the first stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium, he had spent more than ten thousand years.

Jiang Hong shook his head, smiling wryly as he said, “The word ‘less’ is insufficient to describe it! It took him less than a hundred years to successfully complete the first stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium.”

“What?!” Even someone of the King of Grandmist’s composure looked extremely astounded with disbelief. He himself had spent over a thousand years to successfully cultivate the first stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium. This new disciple had taken less than a hundred years?!!

This was too difficult for him to believe!

Li Tong and the others were already agape, staring stupidly at Huang Xiaolong.

All of them knew that the King of Grandmist had spent over a thousand years to successfully complete the first stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Jiang Hong went on, “More accurately, it only took Junior Brother less than fifty years!”

The King of Grandmist, Li Tong, and the others’ eyes widened as big as lanterns.

Jiang Hong was inwardly laughing with glee watching his Master’s shocked expressions. It had been quite a while since he had seen his Master show this kind of expression. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Master, guess how long Junior Brother has been cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium until now.” Jiang Hong asked the King of Grandmist again.
