Chapter 3163: The Four Pieces of Huang Long Set

The land quaked violently, and the sky above swayed.

Overwhelming destructive power swept in the four directions. Everyone backed away in a panic, including Cang Xun and Di Shuang.

Pressure coming from the two dragon of creations’ transformations caused the dry land in the ninth level to crack and sink!

The ninth level of Nether Grotto’s land cracked as if it was punched by numerous giant fists, causing the land to sink several hundred meters!

All the darkness, ferocious beasts, and devils in the ninth level crouched on the ground, trembling in fear, and their tongues hung out from the sides of their mouths.

Not only those beasts of darkness and devils couldn’t resist the pressure from the two in the air, but even Lei Yu, Black Devil Shadow, and others with strength rivaling experts on the Extermination List were pressed to the ground.

Li Shuo, ten beast kings, ten overlords, Jin Zin, and others fared slightly better than Lei Yu. Even so, all of them were panting, and had retreated as far to the edge as possible.

Huang Shuai was protected by layers of golden runes which blocked off the overwhelming coercive pressures from Huang Rong and Huang Xiaolong. Whereas, most of the Mystical Pavilion experts were the same as Lei Yu, Black Shadow Devil, and others as they were pressed to the ground and unable to move an inch. Merely a handful of them forcefully remained standing.

Only Yuan Tianyi looked relaxed under the double pressure. Then again, there was a protective layer of thirteen elements around him to block off the destructive energy from Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong’s collision.

“Kill!” A resounding growl thundered from Huang Rong’s dragon mouth as he pounced towards Huang Xiaolong in attack. Even before Huang Rong’s claws reached Huang Xiaolong, space fissures appeared all around Huang Xiaolong.

A new round of battle started.

The ninth level of Nether Grotto seemed to be struck by thousands of divine lightning due to the repeated collisions and out-swept destructive force. Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and the others watched the land break, mountains getting reduced to crumbles, and forests and rivers disappear. The original land had turned into bottomless abyss in various places, ferocious darkness beasts and devils exploded to their deaths in blood mists.

Strong stench of blood permeated the entire ninth level.

“Want to run?!” Huang Shuai was so close to escaping through the entryway when an enormous dragon claw slammed down on him, sending Huang Shuai flying in the opposite direction. Even with the powerful protective runes shielding him, he was reduced to a sorry state.

Huang Rong once again rammed towards Huang Xiaolong while laughing crazily, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re so great that you’re bullying a junior!”

“Junior?” Huang Xiaolong ridiculed, “Huang Rong, I’ve merely cultivated for several thousand years, and you have the cheek to claim to be my junior?!”

Huang Rong’s laughter choked in his throat.

The two started another round of battle, exchanging several hundred moves in moments.

Although Huang Rong had transformed into the body of a dragon-like Huang Xiaolong, it remained a fact that the purity of his Huang Long Bloodline was lower than Huang Xiaolong. The dragon of creation he transformed into, in terms of defense and power, both were weaker than Huang Xiaolong. Not to mention, he had merely comprehended twelve elements power that he was suppressed and beaten by Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Rong tumbled back uncontrollably.

Huang Shuai had tried escaping several times, but he was struck back by Huang Xiaolong each time.

The protective runes inside Huang Shuai’s body began to weaken, and Huang Shuai grew increasingly anxious as he watched the protective runes’ barrier dim because he knew very well that once the protective runes’ power was exhausted, he would die!

But no matter what methods he used, he was unable to escape Huang Xiaolong’s control. Every time he was close to the exit, Huang Xiaolong would appear by his side inexplicably and send him flying the other way.

Huang Shuai was incensed and filled with apprehension while he cursed and swore at Huang Xiaolong and his eighteen generation ancestors. Despite cursing until his throat burned, he was powerless to change reality.

Several hours later, the ninth level of Nether Grotto was full of craters and deep abysses, and destructive energy from Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong’s battle churned in the air.

Huang Rong was struck under his chin by Huang Xiaolong’s claw, and he was sent flying into the distance. The entire ninth level shook when Huang Rong crashed into the broken land, and Huang Rong’s transformation lost its effect, reverting into his human form.

Huang Rong struggled to stand on his feet, and there was hardly a part of his body that was uninjured with several hundred blade cuts. His armor was chipped and broken in many places as if he was hanging a piece of iron that was bitten by a mastiff twice over.

Huang Xiaolong returned to his human form as he descended, and strode slowly towards Huang Rong.

Huang Rong stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong without a trace of fear in his eyes, and there was only venomous hatred, “Huang Xiaolong, I will return one day, and that day will be the day you die!”

“Today’s humiliation, I will return it to you ten thousand times in the future!” Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank and just as he was about to resolve Huang Rong, resplendent rays shone from Huang Rong’s body as a small golden dragon flew out and wrapped around him. Waves of powerful energy belonging to a God of Creation swept out.

This small golden dragon was actually a rune! A rune created by a God of Creation expert!

When the small golden dragon finished wrapping itself around Huang Rong, it turned into a streak of light as it transported Huang Rong away right before Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong’s face darkened. His three dao souls spread out, trying to detect Huang Rong’s presence, but Huang Rong’s presence had completely disappeared. That creation dragon rune had most probably transported Huang Rong out of the City of Nether, maybe even out of the Golden Spider Black Region!

Fear and panic spewed out from Huang Shuai’s eyes when he saw Huang Rong disappear.

Huang Shuai had placed all his hope on Huang Rong, but now that Huang Rong had fled without him, it had extinguished the hope in his heart!

Huang Rong was rewarded with that creation dragon rune when he made a great contribution to the family one time, and that creation dragon rune could only take away one person.

Huang Shuai’s mind was in chaos when a figure appeared in front of him. When he looked up, he saw Huang Xiaolong, and quickly backed away in a fluster. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you want to do?”

“What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong sneered as grabbed Huang Shuai with one hand, and he directly sealed Huang Shuai’s strength and cut off Huang Shuai’s connection with the Huang Long Cape before throwing Huang Shuai into the Sun Moon Furnace.

A low sigh escaped Huang Xiaolong’s lips as he looked at the glimmering Huang Long Cape in his hand. He had traveled from the Divine Tuo Holy World to the Origin Holy World, until the Golden Spider Black Region, and the Huang Long Cape was finally in his hands!

There was also the Huang Long Heart!

Huang Xiaolong raised his head to look at the Huang Long Heart in the air that was emitting ripples of golden light.

Despite the intense battle between Huang Xiaolong and Huang Rong, the Huang Long Heart wasn’t affected or damaged in any way.

Cang Xun, Di Shuang, and others subsequently captured the remaining Mystical Pavilion experts, and brought them up to Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong easily subjugated them.

In a single step, Huang Xiaolong reached the Huang Long Heart in the air. He reached out and his hand passed through the layers of golden light with ease. His fingers traced the surface of Huang Long Heart, and felt a close connection. It was a warm connection, as the same blood.

“Father!” Huang Xiaolong called out in a low voice.

The Huang Long Heart seemed to have heard Huang Xiaolong’s call, the golden light around it throbbed. Although the Huang Long Heart wasn’t really his father’s heart, it was refined from the blood essence taken from his father’s heart.

Huang Xiaolong squeezed a drop of blood essence onto the Huang Long Heart immediately, and the Huang Long Heart emitted a burst of radiant light. Huang Xiaolong then sat cross-legged as he began refining the Huang Long Heart.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎
