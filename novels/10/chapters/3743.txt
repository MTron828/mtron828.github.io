Chapter 3744: Abducting the Treasure Sage Human Emperor

Huang Xiaolong let the fists land on his body, and at the same time, he struck out with his palm at the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

Shocked faces dominated the crowd watching Huang Xiaolong’s action. Is that young man planning to exchange injury for injury against the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?

When the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s fists landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, a barrier formed from the Thirteen Universes appeared around Huang Xiaolong.

Boom!

Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s fists’ force hit on the Thirteen Universes’ shadows instead.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong’s palm directly sent Treasure Sage Human Emperor flying, smashing an enormous hole in the Big River Mountain base. The Big River Mountain that was already on the verge of crumbling with cracks running through it, completely crumbled into pieces.

The crowd looked at the phantom images of the Thirteen Universes around Huang Xiaolong in astonishment and utter disbelief. Huang Xiaolong took on the full force of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s two punches and stood unscathed!

In truth, Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s punches did not hit Huang Xiaolong, hence, Huang Xiaolong was completely unaffected. The impact was blocked by the Thirteen Universes’ barrier.

In recent years, Huang Xiaolong had been researching the esoterics and laws of the Nameless Devil Mirror’s Thirteen Universes, which contributed significantly to the perfection and completion of his own universe. Now, when Huang Xiaolong circulated the Universe Transformation Art, he could employ the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws to condense the thirteen universes’ barrier when facing his enemy.

This was the first time Huang Xiaolong used the Thirteen Universes’ esoterics and laws to form a barrier against his opponent, and its power greatly exceeded Huang Xiaolong’s estimation.

Originally, Huang Xiaolong thought that the barrier could block most of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack and remnants of it would land on him, but the amount of energy that reached him just now was less than twenty percent. In other words, the Thirteen Universes’ barrier blocked off eighty percent of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack.

Huang Xiaolong’s current physical defenses were more than sufficient to withstand twenty percent of Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s attack, therefore, as everyone saw, he was unharmed.

The shock Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and the Supreme Golden Devourer’s group of three received after seeing Huang Xiaolong standing still unharmed was bigger than others present.

Because they were clearer than other ancient races’ and families’ experts about how terrifying the Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s strength was. Treasure Sage Human Emperor was born with an innate Treasure Physique. It was the highest grade of Treasure Physique in the entire Origin Universe, and it possessed formidable explosive power. Not to mention the various treasures the Treasure Sage Human Emperor had used over the years to temper and strengthen his body. Under the support of countless resources, his physical body was comparable to some 29.1 billion mark experts. Yet Huang Xiaolong was unscathed after being hit by his fists!

On the contrary, it was the Treasure Sage Human Emperor who crashed into the bottom of Big River Mountain from Huang Xiaolong’s strike!

Even though Treasure Sage Human Emperor was buried under a heap of rocks and stones, they spotted the palm print on his body! This palm print covered Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s entire torso, and his chest had caved in from the palm strike!

Strong as Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s physique is, his chest actually caved in under that palm strike! Needless to say, all his ribs must be broken.

The Treasure Saint Palace’s experts couldn’t believe their eyes.

The ten Human Emperors were the human race’s pillar of strength and belief in the Origin Universe, and Treasure Sage Human Emperor was the Treasure Saint Palace’s sky!

Now, the sky had fallen.

Fear and unease that they had never felt before gripped their hearts, making them feel lost, angry, and helpless, with all kinds of emotions jumbled up.

Especially, Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s one particular female disciple looked shocked and infuriated as she glared daggers at Huang Xiaolong. She was the one who said she’d pack Huang Xiaolong away so as not to disturb the Treasure Sage Human Emperor earlier.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the array of complicated, anguished faces of Treasure Saint Palace’s experts. After he put away the Nine Cauldrons, he arrived in front of the Treasure Sage Human Emperor in one step and pulled the man up into the air.

“You—! Let go of my master!” the female disciple shouted as she rushed up toward Huang Xiaolong.

But before she even got closer, she was repelled by the pulse of energy from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Raising Treasure Sage Human Emperor up by the collar, Huang Xiaolong tore up space and disappeared from sight faster than one could blink.

Old Granny Void, Domineering Blade Xihu, and Supreme Golden Devourer’s group wanted to chase after Huang Xiaolong by tracing his aura, but they soon discovered that both Huang Xiaolong and Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s aura had disappeared completely.

The experts left behind looked at each other in confusion, wondering what they should do.

Things ended… just like this?

Neither Old Granny Void nor any of the other four experts got a chance to compete for the Nine Cauldrons, nor did Treasure Sage Human Emperor. All they knew was that the Nine Cauldron was taken away by a mysterious young man of unknown origins except that he was called Huang Xiaolong!

Not only that, but the Treasure Sage Human Emperor was also injured and taken away!

A human race expert of Treasure Sage Human Emperor level was taken away, and it was probably the first time something like this ever happened.

“That Huang Xiaolong… Judging from his words, his target must have been the Heaven Sage Human Emperor, but since the Heaven Sage Human Emperor did not come, did the Treasure Sage Human Emperor became his substitute target?” Domineering Blade Xihu recalled what Huang Xiaolong said in the beginning and said it out loud.

When Huang Xiaolong had blocked the Treasure Saint Palace’s path, he had mentioned that since the Heaven Sage Human Emperor had not come, the Treasure Sage Human Emperor would do as well.

“What purpose does he have in taking away Lord Treasure Sage Human Emperor?” The Supreme Golden Devourer voiced his doubt.

There’s a grudge between them?

But it doesn’t look like it, because they do not know each other. Then, Huang Xiaolong did not come for vengeance. Had that been the case, he wouldn't have merely snatched away the Treasure Sage Human Emperor.

“Perhaps, he wants to find out some secret from the Treasure Sage Human Emperor?” Old Granny Void deduced. She could probably guess what secret it related to.

“Princess, what do we do now?” one of the Treasure Saint Palace’s Eminent Elder asked the female disciple.

“We will seek help from the Lord Dragon Sage Human Emperor to judge fairness for us!” The Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s female disciple decided.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor was the most powerful of the human race’s cultivators, and he was an existence infinitely close to becoming the God of Universe.

……

Half a day after Huang Xiaolong took away Treasure Sage Human Emperor, they came to a desert island. He simply threw the Treasure Sage Human Emperor after sealing his strength.

Treasure Sage Human Emperor glared ferociously at Huang Xiaolong from the ground. “Who are you really? Why did you kidnap me? We ten Human Emperors are of one mind. Therefore, kidnapping me means the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and the others will come hunting for you soon.”Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Dragon Sage Human Emperor? I’m looking forward to meeting him,” Huang Xiaolong responded with a hint of apprehension.

The Origin Universe’s Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s strength was comparable to Old Man Fortune, maybe even half a notch stronger than Old Man Fortune. If the Dragon Sage Human Emperor really came for him, Huang Xiaolong was truly interested to have a battle with him.

Although the Dragon Sage Human Emperor was the number one human race expert, he was not the number one expert in the Origin Universe. In the whole Origin Universe, the Dragon Sage Human Emperor ranked second.

After all, apart from the human race, there were countless other ancient races in the Origin Universe.

Huang Xiaolong did not waste time talking about irrelevant matters with the Treasure Sage Human Emperor. He directly branded Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s dao soul with his soul mark, however, branding his soul mark in an expert at Treasure Sage Human Emperor’s level took a little bit more time and effort.
