“You want us to submit to you? Punk, you’re f*cking daydreaming!” One of the hot-tempered Zhuang Family Elders was outraged.

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong smiled. When no one expected it, his finger lightly tapped the space in front of the Zhuang Family Elder and a small ball of divine fire fell on his body. Almost immediately, the Zhuang Family Elder let out a miserable scream.

Regardless of how intensely that Elder struggled, how much his godforce tried to suppress the fire burning his body, it became even more intense instead.

First, it was his legs. The fire rapidly burned up to his waist, then his chest, and in the next second, that Zhuang Family Elder was completely engulfed in burning flames, as if he was made of fire.

The whole time, that Elder was screaming until his voice was hoarse, his arms flailing as he tried to seek help from other four families’ experts around him, but these people swiftly retreated far away, fearing that the fire from his body would jump onto them.

After ten minutes of burning, that Zhuang Family Elder stopped struggling; in fact, he completely stopped moving. The human-shaped gray ashes on the ground were blown away by the wind, disappearing from the world.

Watching this scene, the four families’ experts turned chalk-white.

Just ten minutes ago, that Zhuang Family Elder was a robust living early Second Order Heavenly God Realm expert. In the Zhuang Family, his status was only below the Patriarch!

But, the consequences of one sentence erased his existence, not even an intact corpse left behind for burial!

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over He Hanyu, Su Yinhai, and the others, “My patience is limited, you have five minutes to consider.”

Five minutes!

He Hanyu, Su Yinhai, and the others’ expressions became even uglier, yt no one from the four families dared to make a sound.

The seconds ticked by. With every passing second, He Hanyu and the others’ hearts tightened even more. In the blink of an eye, four minutes remained.

Huang Xiaolong did not show any impatience, standing there indifferently as he waited for their decision.

Two minutes passed.

In this tense atmosphere, the little cow suddenly let out a long moo. It was so abrupt that He Hanyu and the others felt their hearts jump.

Fortunately, they had strong hearts, otherwise that fright just now would have taken their lives.

Huang Xiaolong helplessly looked at the little cow, ‘This cow!’

The golden horned little cow blinked its eyes at Huang Xiaolong, full of innocence.

Four minutes passed.

In the distance, all the Lin Family Fort’s guards and disciples stood rigid with tension, their nerves stretched thin.

“I, I’m willing, to submit.” Finally, the first person who could not withstand the pressure of death spoke. The Zhuang Family Patriarch has submitted to Huang Xiaolong.

As their Patriarch surrendered, all the Zhuang Family experts followed suit. Though a few hesitated, they soon stood on the same side, kneeling in submission.

Subsequently, it was the Deng Family Patriarch and his family’s experts.

Watching this, He Hanyu and Su Yinhai were left with no options but to submit to Huang Xiaolong. With just their strength, they had no chance of resisting Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, satisfied with the result, as he permitted the four families’ people to stand. He then branded all the Heavenly God Realm cultivators with his soul mark, completely holding the lives of He Hanyu and the other four families’ Heavenly God Realm cultivators in his hand.

Although they all wanted to object, recalling Huang Xiaolong’s horrifying strength as well as the tragic death of that Zhuang Family Elder, the thought of resistance was extinguished almost as soon as it appeared.

After their godheads were marked by Huang Xiaolong, He Hanyu, Su Yinhai, and everyone looked extremely forlorn.

“Young Lord, how should we deal with these traitors?” At this time, Lin Hang cautiously approached Huang Xiaolong, inquiring his opinion as he pointed at the group of Lin Family Fort guards and disciples who had previously surrendered to the four families.

Those guards and disciples looked nervously at Huang Xiaolong, unease gripping at their hearts.

“The Lin Family Fort has its own rules.” Huang Xiaolong coldly stated.

“Yes, Young Lord, this subordinate understands.” Lin Hang’s heart trembled but quickly complied.

The meaning behind Huang Xiaolong’s words was clear as day, ‘handle it according to the Lin Family Fort’s rules’!

In general, the majority of forces had a common way of dealing with traitors, death, and the Lin Family Fort was no different.

Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words, the Lin Family Fort guards and disciples immediately fell to their knees. Some even pissed their pants, while others cried and kowtowed to Huang Xiaolong, begging for mercy.

Huang Xiaolong leaped onto the little cow’s back, returning to the Lin Family Fort.

A second later, piercing cries resounded behind him, but the noise quickly died down.

After the traitors were dealt with, Lin Hang and the four families’ experts entered the Lin Family Fort, standing nervously inside the main hall.

Huang Xiaolong who was sitting on the main seat called out, “He Hanyu.”

“Yes, Young Lord!” A cold shiver ran down He Hanyu’s back as he stepped forward with his head lowered.

“Su Yinhai.” Huang Xiaolong then called out the names of the four families’ Patriarch one by one.

Su Yinhai and the Zhuang and Deng Families’ Patriarchs stepped forward, following He Hanyu’s example.

“You all tell me in detail the four families’ situation.” Huang Xiaolong said.

Hearing that Huang Xiaolong only wanted to understand the four families’ current situation, He Hanyu secretly breathed out in relief. The sweat on his forehead evaporated a little.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly amazed by the end of He Hanyu’s report, he didn’t expect the four families to actually control over nine-tenths of the Green Sun City’s economy. Other than the Green Sun City’s forces, the number of surrounding forces that had sworn fealty to the four families actually exceeded fifty!

These four families don’t have many of experts but their hands actually stretched so far. This was out of Huang Xiaolong’s estimation.

Before He Hanyu and the others left, Huang Xiaolong had them hand out all the herbs and divine pellets they had.

Even though the amount of herbs and divine pellets inside the Lin Family Fort’s treasury was sufficient to support Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation for some days, the more he had the better.

Despite feeling ten thousand times unwilling, He Hanyu, Su Yinhai, and everyone present dared not defy Huang Xiaolong. All of them obediently took out all the medicinal herbs and divine pellets from their spatial rings.

A short while later, rich spiritual energy filled the main hall as the herbs and pills piled high akin to hills.

Huang Xiaolong revealed a faint satisfied smile looking at the amount of resources in front of him. Even though this couldn’t compare to the Lin Family Fort’s treasury, as small as a mosquito was, it was still meat.

However, Huang Xiaolong did not have the four families clear out their own treasuries for him. The four families’ daily expenses were very high, so if he cleared out their treasuries, members of the four families would probably need to go out and beg.

Putting away all the herbs and divine pellets in the main hall into his spatial ring, Huang Xiaolong reminded He Hanyu and the other Patriarchs some matters before sending them off with a wave of his hand, leaving only a small number of the four families’ disciples to guard the Lin Family Fort.

Since almost all the Lin Family Fort guards and disciples were punished for their betrayal, there were only a scarce few guards and disciples left.

He Hanyu, Su Yinhai, and the other two Patriarchs respectfully acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s order and retreated from the main hall.

Stepping out from the Lin Family Fort, He Hanyu felt a pressure being lifted off his chest, sighing heavily. Shortly, the four families’ group headed back to Green Sun City.

Inside the He Family’s great hall, He Cheng whose meridians were severed by Huang Xiaolong was waiting anxiously for news.

“Young master He Cheng, you don’t need to worry. With the several Patriarchs’ strength, they will definitely annihilate the Lin Family Fort. That bastard won’t be able to escape.” Watching him, one of the He Family guards said.

“Young master He Cheng, the Patriarchs are back!” Suddenly, a He Family guard ran excitedly into the great hall, reporting at the top of his lungs.

He Cheng was elated hearing that, hurrying up to his feet. Walking out from the great hall to the main entrance, he instantly saw He Hanyu and the others who had just returned from the Lin Family Fort.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
