Chapter 2309: Holy River!

In the eyes of Emperor Yu, their statuses were too different! Huang Xiaolong was like an ignorant brat to him!

However, the other party was brought over by his good friend, and it wouldn’t be too good if he scolded the youngster. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, Di Huai didn’t feel that Huang Xiaolong did anything wrong. Turning around, he explained to Huang Xiaolong. “That’s right. Dou Rui’s talent is indeed amazing. He’s the most talented disciple that appeared in the Devil Palace in the past several billion years! His talent is comparable to the top Holy Princes. His saint attributes rank in the top ten!”

“Top ten?!” Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in disbelief.

Feng Tianyu and the others failed to hide their shock when Di Huai mentioned Dou Rui’s talent.

Even though they knew that Emperor Yu was injured by the other party, this was the first time they were learning of the other party’s strength!

“That’s right... His saint attributes rank in the top ten!” Emperor Yu sighed, “His talent should be ranked in the top even in the entire Holy World. His strength was unfathomable even before he entered the True Saint Realm a hundred thousand years ago! Who would have thought that he would have already progressed to such a point!”

Emperor Yu was someone in the Second Heavens of the True Saint Realm! Moreover, he was no ordinary Second Heaven True Saint. One could only imagine how strong Dou Rui had to be!

Emperor Yu sighed, “In a few thousand years, he should be able to consolidate his foundations in the Second Heavens True Saint Realm!”

Di Huai shared several pieces of interesting information with Emperor Yu after he explained the strength of Dou Rui to everyone present.

Even though the Devil Palace was messing around in the Hold World, as a True Saint, Dou Rui couldn’t leave the Devil Palace as he wished.

Emperor Yu didn’t wish to hide anything from the rest and he quickly spilled some interesting information. “A Golden Tortoise Bug appeared in the Purple Clouds Sea. When I located it, I was suddenly ambushed by Dou Rui, and he managed to take the bug away!”

Even though Emperor Yu didn’t explicitly state it, it was clear that he was injured in the exchange!

“Golden Tortoise Bug!” Huang Xiaolong and Di Huai exclaimed at the same time.

The Golden Tortoise Bug was a level-eight origin spiritual herb! It was one of the main ingredients to refine level-eight origin spiritual pills!

Emperor Yu stared at Huang Xiaolong as a trace of disbelief flickered in his eyes. It seemed as though Huang Xiaolong’s knowledge about the bug shocked him.

“After retreating back to the Holy Gate, I’ve been trying to regain my strength. The Devil Palace didn’t hold back as they infiltrated my holy ground to slay the experts under my command. In the past few years, they have exterminated several odd-dozen Venerable-level sects!” Emperor Yu said. “I feel much more reassured with Brother Di Huai here....”

As they spoke, they approached the headquarters of the Emperor Yu Holy Gate.

As soon as they entered the main hall, Di Huai turned to Emperor Yu. “I have nothing to hide from you. Anyway, we came to visit you because you were along the way. We should be heading to the Holy Heavens’ headquarters soon.”

“Why are you going to the headquarters of the Holy Heavens?” Emperor Yu jumped in shock. “Brother Di Huai, you...?”

Everyone in the hall sucked in a cold breath.

Pointing at Huang Xiaolong, Di Huai continued, “I’m bringing this little one there.”

The gazes of everyone in the hall landed on Huang Xiaolong.

“Oh? Does Holy Prince Huang Xiaolong possess saint attributes in the top one hundred ranks?” Emperor Yu asked.

“Nope!” Di Huai chuckled and shook his head.

Emperor Yu couldn’t help but laugh along with Di Huai. “Brother Di Huai, you should be more aware than all of us. No one with saint attributes outside of the top hundred ranks will be considered! You’re going to make a wasted trip there! The fees to register for the Holy Heavens’ test aren’t cheap!”

It was clear that he was persuading his friend to give up on a hopeless dream.

“Whatever the case, one can hope.” Di Huai didn’t explain the situation, and he simply brushed Emperor Yu’s concerns off.

“It seems like you’re pretty confident in the little brat. I wonder what saint godhead he has? Do you have some sort of special complete dao saint godhead?”

There were several members who managed to enter the Holy Heavens because of several special attributes. Even though their saint attributes didn’t rank in the top one hundred, they were accepted into the organization.

Even though Di Huai knew that Huang Xiaolong could constantly evolve his saint attributes, he had never seen Huang Xiaolong’s godhead in person. In fact, he had no idea about Huang Xiaolong’s progress!

“Senior Emperor Yu, my godhead ranks in the top nine hundred.” Huang Xiaolong reported truthfully.

As soon as he spoke, the hall turned silent. The members of the Emperor Yu Holy Gate stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

A ‘pfft’ was heard in the air, and someone burst into laughter.

Looking in the direction of the laughter, they discovered that it was a Holy Prince of the Emperor Yu Holy Gate.

“Nine... Nine hundred?” Emperor Yu’s expression changed. He stared at Di Huai and asked, “Is this the top talent of the Zhuoyuan Holy Gate?!”

If it was an ordinary Holy Prince, no one would have laughed at the fact that their saint attributes ranked in the nine hundred. However, Huang Xiaolong was the chief disciple of the Holy Princes! His talent was definitely lacking when they had to compare leaders of Holy Princes of the different Holy Gates.

In stark contrast, Di Huai’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. When Huang Xiaolong first entered the Holy Gate, his saint attributes ranked in the four thousand! How did he improve it by more than three thousand ranks in such a short amount of time?!

This...

It took less than twenty years!

Wouldn’t that mean that...?

Di Huai didn’t care to continue thinking in the direction as beads of cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

He finally realized that he had severely underestimated Huang Xiaolong’s talent!

“Brother Di Huai!” Emperor Yu’s voice suddenly rang in his mind, and he snapped back to reality.

“Brother Yu, may I inquire as to when the Holy River will be opening its gate?” Di Huai asked all of a sudden. “I wish to ask for a slot in the Holy River....”

This time, he wasn’t merely there to visit his old friend. He wanted to let Huang Xiaolong enter the Holy River of the Emperor Yu Holy Grounds along the way.

That was Di Huai’s main goal of the trip!

The Holy River of the Emperor Yu Holy Gate was extremely beneficial to those with high talent. If Huang Xiaolong could cultivate in the Holy River, he would gain a whole lot!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had already entered the Venerable Realm, his absolute strength was a little too lacking. After all, Venerables were merely weaklings in the eyes of Half Saints. Di Huai really wished that Huang Xiaolong could use the chance to enter the mid-level Venerable Realm!

According to his calculations, the Holy River would be opening soon!

“Holy River?” Emperor Yu stared at Huang Xiaolong for a second. Then, a troubled look appeared on his face, and he turned to face Di Huai. “This... Even though the Holy River will be opening in three days, I can only send five people into it!”
