The Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin was shocked and exclaimed in terror, “Your Majesty, how about we forget going to the Black Ant Clan ’s headquarters...”

Huang Xiaolong replied with candid laughter, “Nonsense! Of course, we’re going there! We need to head there openly.”

Compared to Huang Xiaolong’s calm demeanor, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin panicked. “Your Majesty, Chu Han might have surpassed the Emperor Realm! He isn’t Shi Wushuang... His actual strength might be way more terrifying than that of Shi Wushuang! If he makes a sneak attack, wouldn’t you...?”

Indeed, When Shi Wushuang had made a sneak attack back in the Nethersea, he had nearly killed Huang Xiaolong. Now that Chu Han was someone more terrifying than Shi Wushuang, it was almost impossible for Huang Xiaolong to survive an attack from him head-on.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the anxious expression on Hao Ren’s face, and he chuckled, “Relax. I have already run through all the scenarios in my head. I’m afraid Chu Han won’t get the chance to carry out a sneak attack.”

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong was extremely confident in himself, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin couldn’t help but turn speechless.

In half a day, the two of them managed to arrive at the Plains of Bones after crossing the Demon Bewitching Forest.

Along the way, Hao Ren kept trying to dissuade Huang Xiaolong from going to the Black Ant Clan ’s headquarters. However, it failed to change his mind.

After all, it was merely a mount...

As they traveled in the sky above the Plains of Bones, a white sea spread out beneath them. The white sea was formed with bones, and they belonged to many different groups of people. Some bones came from demonic beasts, Hell beasts, and some even belonged to members of Hell’s various races. There were even some bones from members of the Human Race!

All the bones emitted a dense white glow. Huang Xiaolong could feel a type of murky qi surrounding the Plains of Bones, formed with corrupted qi and death qi.

Ordinary God King Realm experts would find it difficult to defend themselves against a combination of both qis, and it wouldn’t be long before they too became part of the bones scattered around them.

Of course, the qi was nothing more than murky gas that was utterly harmless to Huang Xiaolong and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bother covering his body with his godforce. He rode on the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin and charged through the Plains of Bones.

Even though the death qi and corrupted qi stuck onto Huang Xiaolong’s body, a brilliant golden light would flash from time to time to purify it.

After obtaining the inheritance from the Heavenly Hall, his True Dragon Physique had gained the ability of purification. Regardless of the kind of nefarious qi or evil object, Huang Xiaolong’s body would purify them all.

Of course, even if Huang Xiaolong hadn’t obtained the Heavenly Hall’s inheritance, the corrupted qi and death qi wouldn’t have harmed him, anyways. The True Dragon Physique wasn’t something they could penetrate.

As they flew across the skies, they saw nothing but bones beneath them.

The Plains of Bones didn’t have a hint of green, and bones covered the earth. Even the ground that was exposed to the air was a dull grey.

As they flew about, the two of them encountered the attacks of some spirits. However, these spirits weren’t too powerful, and the strongest among them was at the Heavenly Monarch Realm. Huang Xiaolong and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin blew them away with a few attacks.

Even after traveling for a long time, they failed to see the end of the plains.

After flying for another hour, the two of them finally arrived at the central region of the Plains of Bones.

They saw a massive city constructed with bones, standing tall in the middle of the Plains of Bones. The city itself was massive, and if they wanted to cross the Plains of Bones, there was no other choice than to pass the city.

As they approached, they saw piles and piles of bones on the city walls. It was enough to cause one’s heart to palpitate when they looked at it. There were ancient symbols carved onto the bones, and the wall seemed to form some sort of ancient soul slaying formation.

Huang Xiaolong was afraid that if he flew over the city, they would be attacked by the ancient soul slaying formation.

The city lord was extremely mysterious, and his strength was unknown. The number of men under him was too many to be counted, and even the three superpowers didn’t dare to cause trouble when they were there.

It could be said that even if Liao Yuan were to visit the city personally, he wouldn’t dare to fly across it.

Before long, Huang Xiaolong and the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin arrived before the city gates.

“Your Majesty, are we going to fly across the city?” Hao Ren paused for a moment before asking Huang Xiaolong.

“We’re heading over directly,” Huang Xiaolong nodded, and his voice was calm. However, there was a sky-piercing arrogance that couldn’t be hidden no matter how hard he tried.

Even though Liao Yuan wouldn’t dare to fly across the White Bones City, it didn’t mean Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t dare to do so. After all, a single White Bones City didn’t scare Huang Xiaolong enough to take a detour. Walking across the city by foot was out of the question.

When the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin heard that Huang Xiaolong was preparing to charge across the city, it became a little excited. “Alrighty!” Stamping its feet on the ground, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin shot into the air.

Just as they were flying across the city, a rumbling sound entered their ears. The billions of bones located on the city walls emitted a chilly aura as death qi started to gather all around. It formed a peerless blade as it shot towards the two of them.

Seeing that they were under attack, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin chuckled and stomped downwards.

In an instant, the two blades formed with an insane amount of death qi crumbled and dissipated.

BOOM!

The death qi blades exploded with a massive bang, and even parts of the city started to crumble.

The two of them ignored everything that went down and continued to fly across the city.

Before long, a long whistle echoed through the air, and several figures shot up into the sky.

The explosion they had caused earlier had alerted all the disciples located in White Bones City.

“Audacious! Who dares to destroy White Bones City? Come down and prepare to die!” One of the disciples charged towards the sky and roared with anger. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Without missing a beat, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin swept its leg out and sent the disciple, who was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, into the ground.

Seeing that one of their fellow disciples had fallen, everyone could no longer hold back their anger as they charged towards Huang Xiaolong in a frenzy.

Flame surrounded the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin, and it didn’t bother attacking. Instead, it flew straight into them. The disciples of the White Bones City were sent flying, and when they came into contact with the scarlet flames, miserable cries filled the air.

All of a sudden, a figure shot through the air with frightening speed. An Emperor Realm expert finally appeared, and it seemed as though he was a mid-Second Order Emperor.

Of course, the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin didn’t hesitate as it rammed straight into him. Without suspense, the Emperor, who had just appeared, was sent flying.

The might of the qilin wasn’t something that could be matched!

Huang Xiaolong simply laughed out loud.

When all of that went down, there was a pretty massive looking middle-aged man located somewhere deep in the palace of White Bones City. There were swords made from white bones revolving around him, and there were times when the swords would fuse to form a massive blade. There were also times they would transform and create several White Bones Demon.

The middle-aged man was precisely the city lord of White Bones City, Yan Duo.

His eyes snapped open when he felt the fluctuations in the air. This power... How dare someone barge into the White Bones City?! A chilly light flashed through his eyes, and his body blurred as he shot towards the battle.

It had been too long since anyone had last tried to disrespect the White Bones City. Several hundred of the experts who had tried trespassing were turned into pristine white bones with his sword the last time that had happened. He had sliced off all the skin and flesh off their body and turned them into his White Bones Demon.
