Listening to Huang Xiaolong’s explanation, Bei Xiaomei asked happily, “Really?”

Huang Xiaolong answered with absolute certainty, “Really!”

“Alright then, pinky promise. After the apprenticeship ceremony ends, you follow me back to the Silver Fox Commerce headquarters. She released Huang Xiaolong’s hand and extended out her pinky finger, wriggling it in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong rolled his eyes in his mind, ‘Still need to do the pinky promise? That too, in front of so many people...’

But when he looked at Bei Xiaomei persistently extending her fair and slender pinky finger at him, with brightly shining eyes full of anticipation, he felt like she was looking like an adorable small pet. Huang Xiaolong’s finger twitched due to this. Just as he was about to make a pinky promise with Bei Xiaomei, a voice disconcerted the harmonious picture, “May I ask this brother’s name? I am the Solitude Emperor Palace’s Gudu Longyi.”

The Solitude Emperor Palace’s Gudu Longyi!

Huang Xiaolong looked over and saw a tall young man who could be considered as good-looking, enough to bedazzle quite a few young girls. And he was looking at him condescendingly.

Though the other side seemed to be inquiring ‘casually,’ his tone made several people uncomfortable just by listening to it.

Solitude Emperor Palace, Gudu Longyi!

The Solitude Emperor Palace’s Young Lord?

There was a big gap in identities between an Emperor’s Disciple and a young lord.

There were a lot of young lords, but each Emperor Palace only had one Emperor’s Disciple.

“I am Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong answered tepidly as he looked at Gudu Longyi in the eyes.

Gudu Longyi was briefly stunned by Huang Xiaolong’s tepid expression but quickly covered it with a smile, “Here, I was thinking that Brother is the new supreme Godhead genius disciple that the Fortune Emperor Palace recruited recently, but it seems you’re not. What did you say your name was? My memory is not very good, so I already forgot your name.”

Other Emperor Palaces’ young lords and Emperor’s Disciples snickered sarcastically.

Chen Hao couldn’t help taking a step forward and speaking for Huang Xiaolong, “I am Chen Hao, my Master is Zhao Lei, and this is my Junior Brother Huang Xiaolong. Since Young Lord Gudu’s memory is so bad, I think you probably should look for a healer?”

The other Emperor Palaces’ young lords’ expressions became fascinating, and some looked at Huang Xiaolong with surprise. Zhao Lei’s disciple?!

Even Gudu Longyi seemed surprised.

Gudu Longyi knew who Zhao Lei was. He had heard his father mention Zhao Lei before, and his father had said that in the Fortune Emperor Palace, other than Fang Gan, Li Shan, Zhou Chen, and Chen Yirong, there was also Zhao Lei who was worthy of his attention.

Zhao Lei was someone his father needed to pay attention to Zhao Lei as he was one of the big characters of the Divine World.

Bei Xiaomei giggled with a hand over her mouth, her laughter sounded crisp and sweet in everyone’s ears. She then said to Gudu Longyi, “Gudu Longyi, no wonder your brother said that his brother is not good, so it’s because of your bad memory?”

Gudu Longyi felt extremely awkward but he did not dare to vent it on Bei Xiaomei. He chuckled dryly and said to Huang Xiaolong, “So Brother is the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei’s disciple, pardon me. If Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei fancies Brother enough to accept him as his disciple, then I am sure Brother must be brilliantly talented.”

Huang Xiaolong knew what Gudu Longyi was trying to fish, hence he answered calmly, “Mine is the Five Elements Godhead.”

Though Gudu Longyi and the others’ faces did not show it, the disdain and ridicule in their minds towards Huang Xiaolong was obvious.

High emperor rank Five Elements Godhead, just this level of talent was accepted by Zhao Lei?

A disciple-in-name?

“So, this Brother’s godhead is the high emperor rank Five Elements Godhead ah, a brilliant talent indeed.” Gudu Longyi flashed a smile at Huang Xiaolong.

“Uncle, you’re going to the Fortune Great Hall, right? Let’s go together.” Bei Xiaomei interjected at this time, and gave Gudu Longyi a fierce glare.

Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement, “Okay.” He allowed Bei Xiaomei to pull his hand as they sped away.

Watching them leave, Gudu Longyi and the others’ faces sank and they hurried after them.

On the way, Bei Xiaomei continued chattering, asking Huang Xiaolong endless questions like a cheery little sparrow.

Some of her questions stumped Huang Xiaolong, not knowing how he should answer them.

Bei Xiaomei suddenly asked, “Uncle, how did you end up being the Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei’s disciple? Can you tell me about it?” She looked at Huang Xiaolong like a curious baby.

Gudu Longyi and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as they too were curious as to why Zhao Lei had accepted someone with merely a high emperor rank godhead like Huang Xiaolong as a disciple?

Huang Xiaolong thought for a second and answered in a concise sentence, “I took first place in the batch of disciples’ assessment.”

Only then did Gudu Longyi and the others understand, but at the same time, they were even more baffled. They could see that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was merely at the mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. An mid-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple had won the first place among so many other newly recruited Fortune Emperor Palace disciples?

Chen Hao was with them, so Huang Xiaolong won’t have the guts to lie, right?

“Huang Xiaolong, there aren’t any God King Realm disciples in your batch of disciples?” Gudu Longyi asked in a confident tone.

Another young man snorted, “I think this batch of disciples doesn’t even have a late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm or peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm disciple, so it seems, you’re very lucky, Huang Xiaolong.”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at the person who had spoken just now and noticed that there was a blooming flower emblem on his robe. Someone from the Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace?

“I am the Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace’s Sun Kaifei.” Sun Kaifei smiled and introduced himself as he noticed Huang Xiaolong glanced at him.

As expected, the Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong stated indifferently, “My luck has always been very good.”

Gudu Longyi, Sun Kaifei, and the others believed without any doubt that Huang Xiaolong had run into luck to get placed in the batch of disciples that didn’t even have a late-Tenth Order or peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm. That was the only reason he won first place.

Chen Hao opened his mouth to explain, but ended up keeping mum in the end.

Soon, the group arrived at the Fortune Great Hall.

There was already a large crowd there at this point, as various Emperor Palaces forces’s representatives were continuing to arrive.

For this apprenticeship ceremony, the Fortune Emperor Palace had been preparing since half a year. The Fortune Great Hall was decorated grandly in red and other colorful festive decorations made from rare chaos crystals from the top and all sides. Under the sunlight, these crystal decorations were reflecting bright and vivid colors, adding a liveliness to the atmosphere.

“The Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss Bei Xiaomei arrives!”

“The Solitude Emperor Palace’s Young Lord Gudu Longyi arrives!”

“The Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace’s Young Lord Sun Kaifei arrives!”

“Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace Emperor’s Disciple Chen Jianchen arrives!”

As Bei Xiaomei and her group arrived at the Fortune Great Hall, the supervisory disciple who was receiving guests outside the entrance, announced loudly.

Almost simultaneously, heads turned towards the entrance. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Fang Gan, Li Shan, and the others were dumbfounded seeing Bei Xiaomei and Huang Xiaolong walking into the hall together, even Zhao Lei was perplexed.

But Fang Gan, Li Shan, Zhou Chen, Chen Yirong, and Zhao Lei walked out to meet them. Even though Bei Xiaomei wasn’t an Emperor or a powerful master, her identity as the Silver Fox Commerce’s Second Miss was sufficient for Fang Gan, Li Shan, and the others to welcome her with courtesy.

After Fang Gan exchanged a few perfunctory words with Bei Xiaomei, Zhao Lei smiled and asked, “Did Miss Bei Xiaomei know Xiaolong before this?”

Bei Xiaomei smiled sweetly as she answered, “Yes, Chief of Hall Masters Zhao Lei; Uncle and I are good friends, and we first met each other at the Royal Buddha Great Worlds.”

Uncle? Good friend?!

Zhao Lei chucked happily, “So, it’s like that.” But it was inconvenient to ask further details at this time and place.

Bei Xiaomei was led to her seat in the great hall by one of the Fortune Emperor Palace’s Hall Masters located closer to the front of the hall. Thus, Huang Xiaolong and Bei Xiaomei had to separate. Though Huang Xiaolong was Zhao Lei’s personal disciple, he and Chen Hao’s seats were arranged in a corner of the great hall.
