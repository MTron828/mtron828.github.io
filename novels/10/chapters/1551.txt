“What? Late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, maybe even peak late-Tenth Order Emperor God Realm!” Hearing Lei Budong estimate that Jiang Hong could be a late-Tenth Order or maybe even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, Feng Chen, Huo Haibo, Shui Luosheng, and Guang Wenfang gasped in astonishment.

At the same time, they thought of another thing. If Jiang Hong was already so powerful, didn’t that mean that Jiang Hong and Huang Xiaolong’s Master was even more...?!

Someone above the Emperor Realm!

Feng Chen, Huo Haibo, Shui Luosheng, and the others felt their minds buzz and they shuddered subconsciously.

Although they had been isolated within this space for generations, they had learned through the years from the outsiders who stumbled into this space that there were only a handful of people who had surpassed the Emperor Realm in the outside world.

Lei Budong muttered under his breath, “Their Master must be a master that has surpassed the Emperor Realm!”

“If he really becomes our tribe’s king, does that mean that we Barbarians would have gained a peerless master that has surpassed the Emperor Realm as backing?!” Huo Haibo babbled with excitement.

“That’s right, if our tribe follows him, we definitely would be able to rise to the top of the world!”

The present Barbarians’ small chieftains were trembling with excitement discussing about the ‘new king.’ Feng Shili alone looked pale. To him, if Huang Xiaolong really became the tribe’s king, and decided to pursue the previous matter with him, the consequences for him...?!

Thinking of the tribe’s punishment, Feng Shili broke out in cold sweat.

While the Barbarians continued to talk about the topic, Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and the rest were already flying up the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak. The closer they got to the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong’s sense of the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura became stronger.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong, and the others were standing in front of an ordinary looking cave on the slope of the mountain.

Following their senses, the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura were likely to be inside this cave.

There were faint wisps of purple mists flowing out from the cave’s mouth, almost invisible to the naked eye. At a glance, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong could see that these faint purple mists were actually spiritual energy enriched by purple grandmist aura.

They stopped only for a moment in front of the mouth of the cave. Huang Xiaolong flew into the cave first riding on the little cow, followed by Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, and the others.

The cave tunnel was not big; it was a little dim, quiet and mysterious.

After flying for some time in the cave tunnel, the tunnel space gradually grew wider and brighter. Huang Xiaolong’s group saw more and denser wisps of purple mist. At the same time, Huang Xiaolong got a strong feeling that he was closer to the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura.

The group flew onwards for another ten minutes.

Suddenly, bright lights filled their path as they arrived at the bottom of the cave.

The group looked around and found themselves in a magical scenery, as if they had stumbled into paradise. There were numerous spiritual plants around them, bathed in rich spiritual energy. Each of these spiritual plants and trees were enriched by the purple grandmist aura and dragon qi.

Among these spiritual plants and trees were the purple dragon yew trees they had seen outside the cave.

The purple dragon trees outside were tall and imposing resembling purple primordial divine dragons, but the purple dragon yew trees inside this cave were several times taller and bigger! For a second, Huang Xiaolong had an illusion that he was facing a forest of giant purple primordial divine dragons.

The value of spiritual herbs and trees in this cave was tantamount to a thousand Emperor Palaces’ treasuries.

Clearly, this cave space was vast, so vast that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t even see the other end of the cave.

Following his senses, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong led the others and flew forward.

They barely flew for a few minutes when Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong stopped abruptly. Both were staring towards the front with ecstasy.

There was a ten thousand zhang long shining purple dragon swimming around the cave’s ceiling! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This shining purple dragon was a purple grandmist aura that had taken the shape of a purple dragon, similar to the purple grandmist dragon Huang Xiaolong had refined in the past.

On top of that, there was a long, river-like grandmist aura winding irregularly close to the purple grandmist dragon like a mischievous child.

Purple grandmist dragon!

Grandmist aura!

As expected!

Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong were trembling with excitement.

Huang Xiaolong’s reaction was slightly better, after all, he had previously refined both the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura. On the other hand, this was the first time Jiang Hong had come face to face with the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura, hence his was a bigger reaction.

Even though Jiang Hong had surpassed the Emperor Realm and possessed a resilient mentality, he could not contain his excitement upon seeing the purple grandmist aura for the first time.

It was with great effort that Jiang Hong managed to suppress his ecstasy after some time.

“Junior Brother, since we’ve found the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura, shall we begin ‘taming’ and refining them? The earlier we’re done, the faster we can get out of this space. What do you think?” Jiang Hong turned his head sideways and asked Huang Xiaolong.

“Sure.” Huang Xiaolong nodded with a smile.

It would take some time for him to ‘tame’ the purple grandmist dragon, so he needed to act quickly. Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San won’t last long in this space.

Huang Xiaolong had the little cow, Xiang Xuyn, Feng Er, and the rest wait for him and Jiang Hong where they were. Then, he and Jiang Hong flew towards the purple grandmist dragon and river of grandmist aura.

As Huang Xiaolong got closer, the initially calm purple grandmist dragon and grandmist aura river became agitated all of a sudden, emitting pulses of radiant light that were glaring to the eyes.

The abrupt changes made Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong stop in their steps.

Right at this time, the purple grandmist dragon moved, flying straight towards Huang Xiaolong. Then, the grandmist aura river too flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

Jiang Hong was speechless looking at this phenomenon. He said to Huang Xiaolong with a wry smile, “Looks like you are more popular than Senior Brother ah.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily.

Huang Xiaolong could feel the purple grandmist dragon and grandmist aura river were not malicious towards him. As for why they were flying towards him was likely because they sensed the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura’s energy that he had refined in the past. There was a familiar feeling that both came running towards him.

In this short moment, the purple grandmist dragon was already in front of Huang Xiaolong, turning into a streak of purple light and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body through his palm.

Despite Huang Xiaolong’s mental preparation, the moment the purple grandmist dragon entered through his palm, sharp excruciating pain took over his body.

Huang Xiaolong hurriedly sat cross-legged and circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Seeing that the grandmist aura river too wanted to drill into Huang Xiaolong’s body like the purple grandmist dragon, Jiang Hong had no choice but to grab the grandmist aura river from across the air to his side.

Sensing that the grandmist aura river was wriggling to break free from his grasp to run over to Huang Xiaolong’s side, Jiang Hong was more than a little depressed. He laughed awkwardly and appeased, “Little guy, you better follow me, I will definitely treat you well.” Then, he began circulating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium to absorb the grandmist aura river into his body.

As Jiang Hong circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, the grandmist aura river slowly calmed down, then flew intimately around Jiang Hong.

Some distance away, Huang Xiaolong grimaced in pain. Although he had prior experience in refining purple grandmist dragon, and his Grandmist Parasitic Medium had reached the peak of second stage, the overwhelming amount of energy from this purple grandmist dragon brought him excruciating pain.
