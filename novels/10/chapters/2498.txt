Chapter 2499: Meeting Zhang Yihui

The Furtive Lands was one of the forbidden regions of the Ghost Devil City, and it was larger than anyone could imagine. It was even bigger than the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds! One could only imagine how big it was when they thought of the countless continents housed in the Heavenly Master Holy Grounds!

Of course, no one had an actual map of the Furtive Lands. Therefore, no one knew how large it was, and it was comparable to the depth of the Profound River. There wasn’t a single individual in the Holy World, who knew the answer to the question.

Because of that, the Furtive Lands was a maze.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong entered, a late-Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm ghost devil charged at him.

Since the ghost devil qi in the Furtive Lands was several times denser than the other regions, the ghost devils in the area were a lot stronger. Of course, their numbers couldn’t be estimated.

Before arriving in the Furtive Lands, Huang Xiaolong had barely met any Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm ghost devils. Now that he had arrived, he realized that there were barely any ghost devils weaker than a Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t give it a second thought as he summoned his Golden Buddha Holy Soul to crush it. All it took was a second before he continued to advance deeper into the Furtive Lands.

Pushing his holy souls to the limit, he tried to look for traces of the Black Corpse Holy Emperor’s treasury. At the same time, he paid attention to any traces of the members of the Devil Palace.

However, the Furtive Lands was too large and even after an hour, Huang Xiaolong only managed to kill ghost devils. Not a single participant in the trial could be seen.

Despite his boredom, his rankings rose by quite a bit.

After all, the ghost devil he killed was at the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm. Killing a single one was equivalent to killing ten Eighth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm ghost devils. With the number of ghost devils in the Furtive Lands, he didn’t even need to seek them out. They would rush towards him as though they were afraid he didn’t have enough points in the Trial of Blood.

“It seems like I’ll enter the top hundred ranks in a day.” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Even though he only used the Golden Buddha Holy Soul, he could kill any ghost devils in his way. He didn’t pay too much attention to the points he gained, and he was a little surprised that his place on the jade stele had increased so quickly.

Several hours passed once again.

Half a day after he had entered the Furtive Lands, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the 150th rank. His speed was too terrifying to even mention.

Of course, Cao Nan and the others didn’t forget to laugh at Tyrant Chu.

Duan Xuan and the others shook their head and chuckled to themselves, “Huang Xiaolong is too arrogant.”

It didn’t matter if he cheated to enter the top three hundred ranks. No one would have thought that he would continue to push his rank into the top hundreds. Right now, he was close to surpassing Lin Xiaoying and Huai Po.

Shen Jiewen sneered, “Ever since the battle in the Mirage Pavilion, Huang Xiaolong’s prestige has increased out of proportion. He even dares to cheat in the Trial of Blood. Haha, when he emerges, his reputation will probably go down the drain!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was more than willing to see Huang Xiaolong’s fall from grace.

All of a sudden, Mo Cangli interrupted their thoughts. “Do you really think that Huang Xiaolong is cheating?”

“What if he isn’t?”

Duan Xuan and the others looked at Mo Cangli as their expression changed. Colorful expressions hung on their faces when they heard what he said.

Shen Jiewen coughed and revealed a sheepish smile. “Lord Mo Cangli has to be joking. Huang Xiaolong is only a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint. If he doesn’t resort to cheating, he can’t rise up the ranks. After all, his combat abilities cannot be compared to Huai Po.”

Duan Xuan continued, “Brother Jiewen is right. If Huang Xiaolong didn’t cheat, how can we explain the speed at which he killed the ghost devils?”

Mo Cangli didn’t refute them. However, he felt a nagging feeling in his heart that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t cheating. Of course, he didn’t dare to believe in that.

With his disciple Huai Po’s talent, he probably couldn’t compare to Tan Juan, but he wouldn’t lose to Ji Xinyi or Lin Xiaoying!

Even with Huai Po’s combat abilities, he had only managed to force his way into the 130s. How could Huang Xiaolong rank in the 150s with his strength at the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm?

There were tons of experts, who had a lingering fear in their heart. The thought of Huang Xiaolong being completely legit had flashed through their minds, but they didn’t dare to believe it!

They shook their heads and felt that they were being delusional.

…

While complicated emotions filled the members outside the city, Huang Xiaolong tore through the skies in the Furtive Lands. Just a second ago, he had managed to locate a holy herb!

Moreover, it wasn’t a common holy herb! It was called the Tidal Flower, and it was worth more than a Star Transferring Holy Pill! To put things in context, a Star Transferring Holy Pill was worth ten ordinary holy herbs. One could only imagine how valuable the Tidal Flower was!

Very quickly, Huang Xiaolong arrived above an island. With his holy souls, he locked on to the Tidal Flower at once.

When he obtained it, the flow emitted weird rays of light that seemed to resonate with the tides.

However, a whistling sound filled the skies before he could keep it. “Look! That’s a Tidal Flower! What a find!”

Two experts arrived with shocking speed and Huang Xiaolong turned to stare at them.

To his surprise, he noticed an ‘old friend’ among them!

One of them was from the Unparalleled Holy Gate, and the other was Zhang Yihui!

Huang Xiaolong quickly dug up the name of the person from the Unparalleled Holy Gate. He was called Cang Ping, and he was an early-First Heaven True Saint.

“Huang Xiaolong!” They recognized him at once and they felt a trace of excitement in their hearts.

Zhang Yihui roared with laughter when he noticed Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, what a small world! We’re really lucky to meet each other here!” A sinister smile formed on his face. In the past, he had failed to snatch the grandmist holy spiritual aura from Huang Xiaolong in the Purple Clouds Sea, and he had always been waiting for the moment to take revenge.

He felt that the grandmist holy spiritual aura should have landed in his hands.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw the look in Zhang Yihui’s eyes and said, “We are indeed fated to meet each other again.”
