Void devil beast Xu Baisheng and the rest retreated to the edge of the square. Xu Baisheng released his divine sense to cover the whole square.

Feng Er, Gui Yi, and Gui Er also stood guard in different corners of the square. All of them paid attention to the movements around them, even the little cow was alert for any disturbance.

Huang Xiaolong walked towards the petrified divine elephant in a slow pace.

Huang Xiaolong mentally adjusted himself and began to enter an ethereal state. As that happened, he circulated his grandmist godforce according to the second stage of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Grandmist godforce formed into a grandmist worm and flew out from his index finger.

In others’ eyes, that adorable light purple-colored worm landed on the petrified divine elephant’s forehead.

Huang Xiaolong then tried to manipulate the grandmist worm to penetrate inside the statue. But almost simultaneously, a small burst of yellow colored light covered the surface of the petrified divine elephant.

The grandmist worm was immediately blocked on the spot.

Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into a furrow, and he increased the flow of his grandmist godforce. At last, ten minutes later, the grandmist worm managed to penetrate the layer of yellow light and slowly inched its way into the petrified divine elephant.

The moment the grandmist worm successfully penetrated into the petrified divine elephant, it was as if the grandmist worm had entered an enormous stone chamber. The stone chamber was completely sealed, isolating all divine sense and secret exploring methods. The stone chamber could even block all the attacks and objects.

Huang Xiaolong was delighted as the grandmist worm moved; it’s speed was slow but it could still move onwards. The grandmist worm took approximately two hours to reach the divine elephant’s real body..

At this point, Huang Xiaolong, couldn’t predict how long it would take the grandmist worm to enter the divine elephant’s soul. If the divine elephant were to subconsciously resist the grandmist worm, it would surely take more than two hours.

Huang Xiaolong absolutely needed to concentrate for the next couple of hours. If he were to lose his concentration halfway, his overall efforts would be wasted and his soul would suffer injuries from the backlash from the interrupted process. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

While Huang Xiaolong was fully concentrating on guiding the grandmist worm deeper towards the divine elephant’s soul, the injured Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s disciples, including Xiang Li, had returned to their clan’s headquarters.

Several of the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders were furious upon seeing their miserable appearances and injuries.

“Who? Who was it?!” Grand Elder Xiang Yuan demanded in a low, sullen voice. Killing intent roiled in their eyes.

Someone dared to make trouble in the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City! Not to mention, this person had also heavily injured the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s core disciples! And to add insult to the injury, one of the injured disciples was Xiang Li!

Xiang Li answered through gritted teeth, “It was Huang Xiaolong!”

“Huang Xiaolong?!” The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders were confused, as they couldn’t put a name to the face.

Although, this name sounded familiar to them!

A thought suddenly flashed in Xiang Yuan’s mind and he blurted out, “Are you talking about Huang Xiaolong from the Fortune Gate?! Golden Brow and Blood Knife’s disciple?”

“Yes, Grand Elder Xiang Yuan. I am talking about the same Huang Xiaolong!” Xiang Li nodded.

The Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Grand Elders were inwardly shocked as they exchanged a look.

Naturally, they had heard about Huang Xiaolong.

The fastest rising star of the Fortune Gate in recent years—not only Huang Xiaolong had become the champion of the Fortune Mainland’s All-Islands Great War, but he was also the champion of the Four Mainlands New Disciples’ Battle and even Wangu Ziyi had lost to him. To top it off, Huang Xiaolong had given the Guo Family’s number one genius Guo Jun a severe beating in the sea tribe’s God of the Sea Grand Ceremony. At that time, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was just at peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm, while Guo Jun was a late Tenth order Ancient God Realm!

Barely a decade has passed since Huang Xiaolong entered the Fortune Gate when considering all of his achievements.

And now, Huang Xiaolong has grown strong enough to injure Xiang Li! What is Huang Xiaolong’s current strength?!

“Could it be that Huang Xiaolong has broken through to Ancestor God Realm? I remember that twenty years ago his cultivation was at the peak late-Seventh Order Ancient God Realm during the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony, am I right?” Xiang Yuan voiced his doubt aloud.

“That’s true as gold! Huang Xiaolong has not only broken through to Ancestor God Realm, but I even lost to him in one strike!” Although it was less than glorious, Xiang Li told the truth.

“What?!”

Xiang Yuan and the other Grand Elders exclaimed.

A long time later, Xiang Yuan finally exhaled. “I’ve lived for more than two hundred thousand years. During this time I have visited more than a hundred world surfaces and have seen numerous so-called elite geniuses, but none of them can be compared to Huang Xiaolong!”

“Huang Xiaolong’s a freak!” Another Grand Elder, Xiang Weizhen added, “Maybe, his talent even exceeds the Son of Heaven? Scary...!”

“No matter what, Huang Xiaolong still dared to disregard the Ten Thousand Elephant Royal City’s rules, and injured our clan’s disciples. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to leave the city!” Another Grand Elder stated coldly, his face turned gloomy as he went on, “We must first capture him, and then inform Golden Brow and Blood Knife to come and give us an explanation!”

Xiang Yuan’s eyes glimmered with a cold light as he nodded. “Let’s do that!”

After all, the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s prestige was at risk. They would lose respect, if Huang Xiaolong were to safely leave the royal city, despite injuring the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s disciples.

Had it been someone else instead of Huang Xiaolong, they would have killed him on the spot; whereas Huang Xiaolong’s identity was a little special, therefore, they could only detain him.

“Where is Huang Xiaolong right now?” Xiang Weizhen asked.

Xiang Li respectfully replied, “At that time, they were headed towards the petrified divine elephant’s square!”

“The divine elephant’s square?” Xiang Yuan asked doubtfully, “Why are they going there?”

“Why he went there is not important. We should just rush there and capture him.” Xiang Weizhen said.

With that said, all of them left for the petrified divine elephant’s square with one Great Space Teleportation.

Xiang Yuan, Xiang Weizhen, and the rest did not report this issue to the Ten Thousand Elephant Clan’s Patriarch and Ancestor because they didn’t want to trouble them with such a trivial matter.

They shortly arrived at the square.

Xiang Yuan, Xiang Weizhen, and the rest looked down at the square from high up air. They could see Huang Xiaolong standing in front of the petrified divine elephant. “Is that Huang Xiaolong?” They inquired Xiang Li.

“Yes, that’s him, that’s Huang Xiaolong!” Xiang Li said with eyes full of hatred.

Xiang Yuan nodded and faced down his palm with an intention to pull Huang Xiaolong upwards. His giant palm appeared in the air and flew down towards Huang Xiaolong.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others were completely ignored by Xiang Yuan’s group. They were confident that no one was powerful enough to stop them except Golden Brow, Blood Knife, or other Fortune Gate’s Ancestors.

Just as Xiang Yuan was under the impression that Huang Xiaolong was a fish on the chopping board, a roiling ghost fog suddenly formed a giant grey palm and rushed upwards, immediately blocking Xiang Yuan’s palm strike.

Muffled blasts rang high up in the air, creating turbulence.

Xiang Yuan’s group felt themselves staggering backward as an overwhelming force slammed towards them.

“What?!” Xiang Weizhen and the others were astonished by this outcome. All of them looked at Feng Er and almost simultaneously shouted, “She is a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm!”

Xiang Li subconsciously trembled as he heard the Grand Elders’ words. He looked at Feng Er with disbelief, ‘this alluring maid of Huang Xiaolong’s was actually a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm master?!’

Huang Xiaolong was merely a Fortune Gate’s disciple; how come there was a peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm master following him?!

In a short few moments, Xiang Yuan calmed down despite the flickering expressions on his face. All of them looked at Feng Er with a serious expression.

“Miss, who are you? How are you related to Huang Xiaolong?” Xiang Yuan asked solemnly.
