Chapter 2593: Grand Army!

Along with Zi Dongping’s final attack, an endless wave of purple qi slammed into Huang Xiaolong.

With nowhere to hide, Huang Xiaolong could only take it head-on.

Everything hinged on this last exchange!

With a terrifying light flashing through his eyes, Huang Xiaolong pushed his three holy souls to the limit along with everything he had. The twelve high-grade Saint Fates, the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, and the Holy Mandate Imprint were activated as a thousand arms appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

Devil runes swirled around the arms behind him, and Huang Xiaolong used his ultimate skills.

“Thousand Armed Holy Devil!”

“Prosperity of the Dragons!” “Epoch of Darkness!”

“Endless sea of Demons!” “Heavenly Master Incarnation!”

A thousand golden arms unleashed four Primal Ancestor Dao Arts, and countless heavenly dragons appeared in the skies. A world of darkness took over as demons poured out from the sea of demonic qi around him.

The space around Huang Xiaolong started to shatter as the ground crumbled inch by inch.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands together to form a strange diagram. He pushed his palms out all of a sudden, and the world lit up as it seemed to crumble under the blow.

“Cangqiong Strike!”

Zi Dongping nearly screamed in shock when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s final attack.

The Cangqiong Strike was the strongest attack in the Cangqiong Old Man’s arsenal. Could this human race brat be the disciple of the Cangqiong Old Man too?!

Boom!

As purple light surged out from Zi Dongping, the attacks from Huang Xiaolong ground away at the purple energy bit by bit.

However, Huang Xiaolong was forced to retreat even though he tried his best to resist the attack.

One step, two steps…&nbsp;

As Huang Xiaolong retreated repeatedly, he approached the limit of one hundred miles.

Finally, the purple light was scattered by the Cangqiong Strike and Huang Xiaolong’s ‘Epoch of the Dragon’ shattered.

With his chest heaving up and down, Huang Xiaolong felt some weakness in his limbs.

Despite his ugly appearance, Zi Dongping’s expression was even worse. He had almost managed to force Huang Xiaolong to leave the area!

There was only a several feet of distance before Huang Xiaolong crossed the boundary, and he would win the bet!

The last few feet formed an unending abyss that determined his end.

When Huang Xiaolong crawled to his feet, he stared at Zi Dongping and declared, “You have lost.”

Lost!

Zi Dongping clenched his fist tightly and complicated emotions filled his heart. Unwillingness and hatred flashed through his eyes.

When he was still feeling conflicted, Hei Luo appeared beside Huang Xiaolong.

…

Several minutes later, Huang Xiaolong left the forbidden region of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

He stretched out his hand and the Cangqiong Dao Palace shrunk and returned to him.

“Cangqiong Dao Palace…” Zi Dongping stared at the tiny structure with complicated emotions flashing through his mind.

“You can start asking your questions…” Huang Xiaolong turned to Zi Dongping and spoke.

“What’s the relationship between you and the Cangqiong Old Man?”&nbsp;

“I received his inheritance and I’m his successor!” Huang Xiaolong revealed everything.

Indeed!&nbsp;Even though Zi Dongping had already guessed the truth, hearing it for himself was a whole new story.

Complicated emotions flashed in his mind.

In the past, the Cangqiong Old Man had swept through the Alien Lands as he had headed over to the World River. He was lucky enough to obtain a pointer from the old man, and even though it wasn’t much, he was extremely grateful to the old man.

However, the Heavenly Master was his mortal enemy!

How could someone be a disciple of both of them at once?!

Looking at the shattered remains of the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds, Huang Xiaoong soared into the nine heavens as golden buddha holy energy swept across the lands.

Energy of all five attributes bathed the land and the shattered earth started to heal. Several hours later, other than some areas nearer to the Hong Zhen Holy Gate, almost everything had returned to normal.

By the time everything was done, the grand army assembled by You Shiheng was several billion miles away from the Hong Zhen Holy Gate.

“Domain Lord, we’ll be there in half a day,” one of the enforcers reported.

You Shiheng nodded his head. “Did that human leave the Hong Zhen Holy Gate?”

“According to the reports from our informants, the human has been living in the headquarters of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate. He is currently still there.”&nbsp;

“That’s good…” With a single order, You Shiheng ordered for the army to hasten their approach. At top speed, they would be able to arrive in two short hours. In addition, he ordered his men to maintain surveillance on the human.

Two hours passed in a flash.

The insanely large army that gathered in the space above the Hong Zhen Holy Gate was so large that they blotted out the skies. Even though they didn’t possess terrifying individual strength, the combined strength of the army released a horrifying aura that alerted everyone in the Hong Zhen Holy Grounds.

A smirk formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he noticed the massive army. Soaring into the skies with Hei Luo, Zi Dongping, Xiao Shan, Lin Cong, and the others, he went to meet with You Shiheng.

As soon as he laid eyes on Domain Lord You Shiheng, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “I was planning to head over to the heart of the Dissociation Domaion to smoke you out. Who would have thought that you would appear on your own? Whatever the case, I have to thank you for saving some of my precious time. However, you’re really too slow. I waited for two whole months for you guys!”

Even though You Shiheng had prepared a lengthy speech, he was dumbfounded after hearing what Huang Xiaolong said. His expression sank as he had never expected for a Second Heaven True Saint to act so arrogantly before him.

However, a sneer soon formed on his face. “You’re pretty damn arrogant. Are you planning to deal with me yourself? Heh, you’re probably relying on some sort of dao artifact to strut your stuff…”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second and a brilliant smile soon appeared on his face. “You’re absolutely right! I do have a dao artifact on me!”

You Shiheng rejoiced when he heard Huang Xiaolong’s confirmation. Xu Wen and Xu Hai were shocked, but smiles eventually formed on their faces.

“Hahaha! I was right! You killed Li Yapeng with a dao artifact!” You Shiheng chuckled.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head slowly and remained silent.

“Little brat, hand over your dao artifact, Xiao Shan, Lin Cong and the rest. Promise to serve under me, and I’ll forgive you!”&nbsp;

“Release them?” Huang Xiaolong stared at those behind him and continued, “Even if I release them, they won’t agree to serve you. After all, they accepted me as their master. All of them are my slaves now,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“What?!” You Shiheng was stunned for a second, but he roared with laughter along with the Xu Brothers.&nbsp;

As their laughter rang through the skies, Huang Xiaolong reached out and swiped the air. In front of everyone, You Shiheng, the Domain Lord, spat out mouthfuls after mouthfuls of blood. His body started to shake, and he seemed to have suffered a stroke as he foamed in the mouth.&nbsp;
