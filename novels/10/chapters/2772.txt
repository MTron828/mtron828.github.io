Chapter 2773: What’s Going On?

“How come it’s like this?!”

“Impossible, this absolutely can’t be true!”

“I don’t believe this is real!”

Some of the experts hiding in the vicinity were screaming inwardly.

They couldn’t believe what they had just witnessed, and none of them did.

Those were the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s forty-plus Primal Ancestor experts attacking together, but they were slapped into the air by a Ninth Heaven True Saint brat!

Don’t forget that there were more than ten high-level Primal Ancestors among the forty-plus of Ninth Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts!

How could this be real?!

“Who is this brat?! Is Ninth Revolutions Sacred Lands putting on an act to frighten us off?”

“That’s right, this must be a trap. Ninth Revolutions Sacred Land and this brat are setting up a trap for us! Maybe, the time that brat showed off his wealth in the auction was the first step! They wanted to lure us to deal with that brat!”

“That’s right. Without Nine Revolutions Sacred Land backing him, would a Ninth Heaven True Saint have dared to reveal so many Tuoshen Holy coins in public?! No one is so stupid!” some of the experts deduced with their companions.

But the majority of these people were astonished, and they thought that these people’s acting was a bit too real…. They could see that the Ninth Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts were really injured!

Real injuries! Not some scratches on skin!

More importantly, what was the reason for Ninth Revolutions Sacred Land to set this kind of trap?

Why would they want us to attack? Ninth Revolutions Sacred Land has no reason to do this, and there don’t seem to be any benefits to gain.

While everyone was trying to figure out the ins and outs, Huang Xiaolong took a step forward, arriving in front of Chen Hong and several others almost instantaneously.

Chen Hong and his group stared at Huang Xiaolong with frightened faces. Compared to those experts watching from the dark, they had first-hand experience of Huang Xiaolong’s terror that exceeded their imagination.

They even suspected that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t really a Ninth Heaven True Saint.

But through their dao souls, it was determined that Huang Xiaolong was indeed a Ninth Heaven True Saint, and there was no mistake.

“You, you’re not a Ninth Heaven True Saint?” one of the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s high-level Primal Ancestor asked in a quivering voice.

This high-level Primal Ancestor expert was Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Eminent Elder Cheng Feng, Chen Hong had specifically called over. Cheng Feng was also the strongest Primal Ancestor expert in Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, and he was a late-Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

Huang Xiaolong looked tepidly at Cheng Feng and asked, “Is this important?”

Is this important? Whether Huang Xiaolong was really a Ninth Heaven True Saint was not important.

Chen Feng, Chen Hong, and the others didn’t know how to answer that question.

Huang Xiaolong approached Chen Hong.

“What do you want to do?” Seeing this, Chen Hong panicked and retreated in panic, while snapping at Huang Xiaolong.

“What do you think?” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were filled with murderous aura.

“I am the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s young lord!” Chen Hong bellowed, “If you dare to hurt one hair on me, Nine Revolutions Sacred Land will…!” But, before Chen Hong could finish his words, his body exploded with one punch from Huang Xiaolong.

With one hand, Huang Xiaolong captured Chen Hong’s fleeing dao soul, and casually threw it into Cangqiong Dao Palace.

“What?!” Not only Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Cheng Feng and the rest were shocked, but even those watching from their hiding places were startled, and they paled unknowingly.

Aren’t they just acting? It’s for real?

The Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Young Patriarch Chen Hong’s dao physique was really destroyed? By a Ninth Heaven True Saint!!

‘How come it’s like this?’ an expert’s mind went blank, muttering inexplicably under his breath.

They couldn’t process how a Ninth Heaven True Saint had managed to destroy the dao physique of a Primal Ancestor. They were at a loss at how to digest what had happened before them! They even suspected that they had fallen into an illusion.

“You, you destroyed the young lord’s dao physique?!” Cheng Feng stared stupidly at Huang Xiaolong.

All the remaining Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts were furiously staring at Huang Xiaolong.

“I already gave him a chance earlier, but he didn’t appreciate it.” Huang Xiaolong went on tepidly, “Now, it’s your turn to make a choice, kneel and submit to me, and I can spare your lives!”

Cheng Feng, and the rest of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts were stunned for a second. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hillbilly, who the f*ck do you think you are to want us to submit to you!” One of the Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts, laughed loudly in ridicule. “Why don’t you look at yourself in the mirror!”

This Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s expert was the same person who had reprimanded Huang Xiaolong at the auction, ordering Huang Xiaolong to kneel and beg Chen Hong for mercy. He had claimed that if Huang Xiaolong failed to obey him, he would die a death worse than a mongrel and cause his own sacred land’s annihilation.

Huang Xiaolong looked at that expert, and pulled him across the space towards him. Then, with one palm strike, Huang Xiaolong shattered the expert’s head into pieces, leaving a ground splattered with brain mass, blood, and bits of bones.

Huang Xiaolong casually threw the expert’s dao soul into Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Then, he looked at the remaining Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts.

Cheng Feng stood dazedly. So did the other Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s experts. The experts hidden in the vicinity had similar reactions on their faces.

“You only have one minute to consider.” Huang Xiaolong’s cold eyes swept over their faces. “Submit or die fighting for Nine Revolutions Sacred Land!”

A Primal Ancestor wouldn’t die when his dao soul remained despite his destroyed dao physique, and although there would be a chance of rebuilding a new body, this was a very slim chance, almost equivalent to death.

Cheng Feng and the others’ faces were gloomy to the extreme.

Huang Xiaolong did not say another word after that, and his dao souls’ senses spread outward, covering several hundred million miles radius, mentally marking every expert hidden around him.

Time passed, and one minute seemed to arrive in the blink of an eye.

In a flicker, Huang Xiaolong made his move. The Cangqiong Blade and Flying Heaven Spear appeared in his hands.

Next came consecutive exploding noises reverberating in the air, jolting the senses of the experts in concealment. To their shock, the forty-plus Nine Revolutions Sacred Land’s Primal Ancestors either exploded, or were dismembered by Huang Xiaolong without exception.

Huang Xiaolong’s hands reached out and collected Cheng Feng and others’ dao souls, throwing all of them into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

At this time, sounds of whistling winds came from inside the Saint Devil City accompanied by a wave of terrifying Primal Ancestors’ might.

Sensing the terrifying force coming at them, Duan Feng, Cangqiong Old Man, and Chen Qi’s expressions worsened.

“Xiaolong, this is?!” Cangqiong Old Man was startled, “Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor? Let’s leave first!”

Such an overwhelming coercive pressure could only come from a Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. Moreover, there were more than one Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors coming towards them. Probably, the battle here had alerted the experts within the city.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. He had initially planned to deal with the experts that were spectating from the dark before leaving, but he hadn’t expected the Saint Devil City’s experts to get alerted so fast. Moreover, there were four Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors, and one of them was a peak late-Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Qian Haishan!

“Go!” Huang Xiaolong did not hesitate, and with Cangqiong Old Man and the others, they tore space and left the scene immediately.

Huang Xiaolong’s group had just disappeared, when several figures descended on the scene. One of them was Qian Haishan.

Qian Haishan and the other experts looked around with a slight surprise. Only now did the experts hidden in the vicinity dared to come out, looking pale.

“Speak, what happened?!” Qian Haishan pulled one of them up to him and demanded loudly.
