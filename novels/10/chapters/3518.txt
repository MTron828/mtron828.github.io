Chapter 3519: Huang Xiaolong?!

 

“Wang Meiqi isn’t here?!” Ao Guang was slightly taken aback by his revelation.

“That’s right. She didn’t come to the Bearded Dragon World with me,” Huang Xiaolong said simply.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong, Ao Guang didn’t know if the man was lying to him.

“Xiaolong, what’s going on?” Ao Xing couldn’t help but ask.

“It’s nothing. I killed several thousand subordinates of his back in the Bearded Dragon Palace. Oh right, he’s the second prince of the celestial empire, Ao Guang,” Huang Xiaolong introduced.

When those standing around heard what he said, they gasped in shock.

“Who the hell is he?! He’s crazy! He dared to kill His Second Highness’ subordinates in the palace?! He has to be lying!” someone yelled.

“Of course it’s bullsh*t! Why would the celestial empire keep such a huge matter hidden? Hahaha!” Someone else laughed.

“What if it’s real?”

Discussions flew all around, and everyone turned to look at Ao Guang for an explanation.

With his expression flickering, Ao Guang glared at Huang Xiaolong and growled, “Huang Xiaolong, since she isn’t here today, you can forget about leaving this place. Let me tell you right now. Our old ancestor is back, and he’s currently residing in the Bearded Dragon World! No one can save you now!”

“Is that so? It’s no wonder you dare to speak to me this way. If you’re so reassured by his presence, why don’t you take revenge for your subordinates?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Rage flashed through Ao Guang’s eyes when he brought it up. “Do you think I’m afraid of you?! I refuse to believe that you’re a God of Creation!” 

However, someone stopped him before he could make his move. 

“Second Prince, there’s no need for you to personally make a move against little ants like that. We’ll take him down in your stead,” an expert standing behind Ao Guang said.

He was an old ancestor of one of the creeds, and he was someone who had comprehended all thirteen elements to the grand completion stage. His brother was at the same level as him, and the two of them were famous beings in the Bearded Dragon World.

The two of them had only submitted to Ao Guang recently, and they were eager to fight for merits.

However, Ao Guang shook his head silently. “There’s no need for that. I wish to kill them myself to get rid of the rage in my heart!” He started walking towards Huang Xiaolong after speaking.

The aura around him started to tremble as he locked on to Huang Xiaolong. The dragon spike appeared in his hand, and even though it wasn’t a creation artifact, it was close. It possessed extreme might, and he had tempered it with poison for several million years. It was a weapon that possessed an extremely corrosive nature.

Anyone who was struck by it would have to kneel before him in pain.

“Huang Xiaolong, I will let you taste death!” 

The little dragon tilted his head to the side, and he looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Big Brother, do you want me to eat him?”

A helpless smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. The little brat had nothing on his mind other than eating

“Little b*stard, I’ll deal with you after!” 

Once he was done speaking, the spike in his hand pierced towards Huang Xiaolong. The power of an expert with several million units of grand cosmos energy was unleashed. Piercing rays of light emerged and many people retreated.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother stopping the man when he saw the spike traveling to his chest. Instead, he allowed it to strike him.

Bang!

The sound of metal scraping against each other rang out when the spike came into contact with Huang Xiaolong.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

A look of joy appeared on Ao Guang’s face, but it was soon replaced by utter shock. He failed to pierce Huang Xiaolong’s skin even with his strongest weapon!

The experts standing all around stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

As the second prince of the celestial empire, Ao Guang’s strength was known to all. No one standing in the crowd would dare to take on a strike from his spike as they knew that they would feel pain worse than death!

“Are you really…?!” A look of terror filled Ao Guang’s eyes.

Huang Xiaolong ignored the man as he grabbed the spike in his hand. It was at that moment Ao Guang realized that the spike in his hands was no longer under his control.

“This is pretty good…” Huang Xiaolong noticed that the person who refined the weapon was pretty good. It was definitely a God of Creation who created the spike.

“However, it’s not good enough.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. “If you’re not coming at me with a creation artifact, you might as well be holding corroded copper.” 

After speaking, Huang Xiaolong casually clenched his fist and shattered the spike into countless pieces. The shards scattered all over the land.

Silence fell upon the land, as no one dared to breathe loudly.

By the time Huang Xiaolong had crushed the weapon, many experts in the pavilion had gathered outside.

They couldn’t believe what they were seeing. After all, how strong did one have to be in order to crush an artifact at that level?

“This… This… God of Creation!”

God of Creation!

Everyone sucked in a cold breath as their hearts pounded in their chests.

There were even some who wanted to get to their knees.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ao Guang who was shaking in his shoes, and he muttered, “I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I really am a God of Creation. You should know the punishment for offending a God of Creation.”

Noticing the killing intent in Huang Xiaolong’s words, Ao Guang retreated hastily. “Huang Xiaolong, you won’t dare to kill me! The old ancestor…”

Before he could complete his sentence, a sea of light emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s fingertips. It swallowed Ao Guang, and by the time the light faded, Ao Guang was nowhere to be seen.

The experts who came with Ao Guang retreated in terror, and there were even some who fell to their knees.

The instant Ao Guang was killed, Xu Long, who was seated in the main palace of the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire, turned to look in the direction of the Zhao Long world. A frosty light flashed in his eyes.

“Lord Xu Long, this…” Celestial Emperor Ao Yu, who was seated below Xu Long, couldn’t help but ask.

“Someone killed Guang’er in the Zhao Long World.” 

The geniuses of the celestial empire had been branded with a restriction in their bodies. As soon as Ao Guang died, Xu Long learned about it.

The Gods of Creation present in the hall gasped in fright when they heard what Xu Long said.

Was there someone stupid enough to make a move on the most treasured grandson Xu Long had in the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire?! Not to mention the fact that they did it on the Zhao Long World! The Zhao Long World wasn’t located too far away from the Bearded Dragon World!

In an instant, Xu Long called for several men to investigate the matter, and he quickly received a report.

“Huang Xiaolong?!” Xu Long was stunned.
