Chapter 2437: Did Anyone Allow You To Do So?

“What?!”

Shen Jiewen, Zhan Zhiyuan, and the others yelled in shock.

Xie Bufan of the Devil Palace rose from his seat in excitement. “Huang Xiaolong, are you sure?”

From what Huang Xiaolong said, anyone could challenge him for the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura. Since that was the case, Xie Bufan no longer had to think of a way to force Huang Xiaolong to hand it over.

“That’s right!” Huang Xiaolong looked at Xie Bufan and nodded. “The Devil Palace and the Ancient Emperor Holy Gate will also be allowed to take on the challenge. As long as your cultivation base is below the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, I’ll take you on!”

Duan Xuan felt a trace of anticipation appearing in his heart when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

“You are allowed to use any means possible during the battle. As long as you end up as the victor of the challenge, you’ll be able to obtain the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura.”

“Can we send unlimited challengers?” Duan Xuan asked all of a sudden.

Everyone turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong with a fervent gaze.

A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he chuckled softly, “That’s right. You can choose to send as many disciples as you like. They can even challenge me in succession.”

A trace of excitement appeared in the hearts of everyone present.

However, Shen Jiewen snorted coldly in response. “Laughable.... Huang Xiaolong do you really think that you can forget the matter of killing my disciple by setting up a stupid challenge?”

“I don’t mind if your Beast Tamer Holy Gate refuses to take on the challenge.”

The words were stuck in Shen Jiewen’s throat immediately.

“According to your rules, will they be allowed to use holy artifacts?” Zhan Zhiyuan of the Black Inferno Race asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Of course they can! However, everything will belong to me as long as I kill the disciples you send to challenge me.”

Everyone frowned immediately.

“For the sake of being impartial, I will choose to not use my holy artifacts if you choose not to use it against me,” Huang Xiaolong continued, “I will only take on challenges for half a year once the arena is open. In the six months that the arena is open, you can send over any disciple under the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm to challenge me at any time.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Since the Trial of Blood was around the corner, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to remain in the Mirage Pavilion for a long time. As such, he set a time limit for the challenge.

Half a year later, he would return to the Holy Heavens whether they liked it or not.

“Half a year later, I should be able to push my saint attributes to the thirtieth rank, right?” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

For the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura, the various factions would definitely send up their strongest disciples. That would also mean that they possessed heaven-defying talent. It was basically a conveyor belt to feed Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes!

Huang Xiaolong finally revealed his true intentions.

Soon after, Duan Xuan, Zhan Zhiyuan, and the others confirmed the rules with Huang Xiaolong once again before they left.

After seeing their departing figures, a sneer finally formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips. Terrifying battle intent flashed in his eyes.

“Nice!”

With endless amounts of resources sent to him during the battle, Huang Xiaolong would be able to improve himself to a shocking degree by the time the challenge ended.

Chen Zhi, Yu Ming, and the others were similarly excited. When they thought about Huang Xiaolong’s master plan, they couldn’t help but observe a second of silence for the disciples of the various superpowers, who were going to be sacrificed by their respective leaders.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had said that he would only start the challenge a month later, they could already foresee the gruesome end of those ready to take up the challenge.

It didn’t take long for the news to spread through the Holy World.

In an instant, the entire Holy World seemed to shake with excitement.

“Is Huang Xiaolong really crazy enough to challenge the various superpowers? There are more than forty of them, who went to confront him in the Mirage Pavilion, and he raised a challenge to all the disciples under the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.... He’s even willing to use the grandmist holy spiritual aura as a reward! I’ve never seen anyone who is as stupid as him....”

“How long has it been since Huang Xiaolong entered the Holy Heavens? It hasn’t even been fifty years! Even if the four Primal Ancestors might have poured endless resources into him, he wouldn’t have entered the half-True Saint Realm. Isn’t he begging to be killed when he challenges everyone under the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm?”

“You’ve fallen really far behind the times.... Haven’t you heard? Huang Xiaolong has the ability to kill Third Tribulation half-True Saints with a single punch! His combat abilities are definitely comparable to a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint. Since he dares to raise the challenge, he should have a way to fight against them!”

“What?! He killed a Third Tribulation half-True Saint with a single punch? How can it be?! Is it even possible for his cultivation to advance so quickly?”

“The news is definitely true....”

“Whatever the case, even if Huang Xiaolong managed to kill a Third Tribulation half-True Saint with a single punch, the experts sent out by the various superpowers wouldn’t be as weak as those he killed in the past. Someone would definitely have the ability to kill Huang Xiaolong. Even if he has two complete dao saint godheads, it’s impossible for them to have evolved past the hundredth rank. It’s even possible for him to die on the first day of the challenge!”

Discussions broke out everywhere.

In the void around the Mirage Pavilion, Lin Xiaoying, who was rushing over, heard the news. A pout formed on her face, and she complained endlessly in her heart. “What’s his problem?! Isn’t he just asking to be killed?”

It was clear that even someone like her didn’t believe that he would be able to challenge all the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saints from the various superpowers gathered in the Mirage Pavilion.

He had even set a rule for himself such that he wouldn’t take a break during the entire challenge. He wouldn’t even be able to swallow divine pills to recover his injuries. Throughout the challenge, he would fight continuously until the challengers stopped coming.

When Lin Xiaoying heard the rules, she nearly fainted.

One had to know that fighting for six months straight wasn’t a good idea. There were times he would have to rest, and no matter how quickly he could recover, he wouldn’t be able to last for six whole months without rest.

Tan Juan and Ji Xinyi shook their heads at the side. They felt that Huang Xiaolong was acting too recklessly. No matter how talented he was, he wasn’t at an unbeatable level yet. Regardless of how quickly his two complete dao saint godheads could evolve, he couldn’t be a match for the talented disciples of the various superpowers.

As they continued to rush over to the Mirage Pavilion, Huang Xiaolong was standing in his courtyard as he listened to the reports of Lu Ruian and the others.

When he heard that Grand Hall Master Wu Ge would arrive with Li Chen and Xie Yao in the next few days, he nodded slowly and replied, “Alright. You are dismissed.”

“Yes, Your Highness....” Lu Ruian bowed before leaving the courtyard.

The four Primal Ancestors wouldn’t leave the Holy Heavens easily, and they could only send Wu Ge over to hold the fort. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t surprised by the Holy Heaven’s actions.

Two days later, the experts of the Holy Heavens arrived in the Mirage Pavilion.

The moment they met, Li Chen started to berate Huang Xiaolong. “Huang Xiaolong, as a Holy Prince of the Holy Heavens, how dare you make the decision to issue a challenge to the various superpowers? Did you ask anyone for approval? You even agreed to use the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura as the stakes of the battle... Did anyone allow you to do so?”

From the way he spoke, it felt as though Huang Xiaolong had stolen the strand of grandmist holy spiritual aura from Li Chen’s personal inventory and used it to bet against others.

Huang Xiaolong raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Did you ask for my permission when you ran your mouth off? Who gave you the permission to get in my face?”
