Chapter 2110: Who Gives A Sh*t About Huang Xiaolong?

When Huang Xiaolong and the others left the Grandmist Emperor Palace, the Gold Essence Emperor Palace’s main hall was bustling with activity.

There was an authoritative middle-aged man seated in the main seat of the hall, and he was clad in the robes with the City of All-Heavens’s insignia. He was precisely the envoy sent by the city, Yan Tianhai.

The City of All-Heavens had sent out an uncountable number of envoys, and they were stationed in most worlds. The old man who was killed by Huang Xiaolong when he had presented the All-Heavens Decree was also an envoy from the city...

As for Yan Tianhai, he was at the peak of the late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm, ready to enter the Sovereign Realm anytime.

The Gold Essence Emperor, Chen Jixuan, and the six ancestors of the emperor palace sat below him. Other than Chen Jixuan, there were also tons of hall masters and grand elders in the hall.

“Chen He, Chen Jixuan...” Yan Tianhai spoke up all of a sudden. “When you kill everyone from the Grandmist Emperor Palace, I will put in a good word for you in front of Lord Yang Gang!”

When they heard what Yan Tianhai said, a smile instantly appeared on their faces, “Many thanks to Lord Yan Tianhai!”

Of course, the six ancestors and Chen Jixuan hesitated for a moment when they thought about the repercussion of their actions. “As for Huang Xiaolong... Will he...”

Hugging onto the City of All-Heavens’s massive thighs was definitely beneficial for them in the long run. It was also the reason why they had sent their disciples out to hunt down the members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace. However, they had no idea how Huang Xiaolong would react when he returned to the Divine World!

Yan Tianhai roared with laughter, “Lord Wan Shi was cultivating his secret art in seclusion, and we allowed Huang Xiaolong to run wild. Now that Lord Wan Shi has left seclusion, we have no need to be afraid of a measly Huang Xiaolong. In Lord Wan Shi’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong is nothing but a clown!”

Chen Jixuan followed up with a sneer, “Lord Yan Tianhai is right! In front of Lord Wan Shi, Huang Xiaolong is nothing more than a bigger grasshopper! Lord Wan Shi can crush him with a stomp anytime he wants! With Lord Wan Shi around, there is no need to fear Huang Xiaolong! If we count the time he’s been alive, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t even be qualified to be my grand-disciple!”

Since the batch of disciples he had sent out were killed by the Flying Devil Python instantly, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s return had failed to reach the Gold Essence Emperor Palace. No one in the hall knew that Huang Xiaolong was back!

When Yan Tianhai heard Chen Jixuan’s description of Huang Xiaolong, he roared with laughter, “That’s right! If we speak based on seniority, Huang Xiaolong can’t even compare to my f*rt! Even my f*rt holds more weight than what Huang Xiaolong has to say! The only reason Huang Xiaolong managed to achieve so much in the past thousand years was because he stepped into dog sh*t and received several inheritances!”

“If not for his heaven-defying luck, who would give a sh*t about Huang Xiaolong?!”

Chen Jixuan chuckled, “Lord Yan Tianhai is right!”

Everyone quickly agreed as they praised whatever Yan Tianhai had to say to the high heavens.

“Is that so?” A chilly voice pierced through space and entered the ears of everyone present, jolting them all awake.

“I guess it’s true. I’m just a nobody...”

“However, in my eyes, Wan Shi and Wan Yue are equally useless! In my eyes, they are the nobodies!”

A cold yet forceful voice resounded in their minds.

There were only so many people in the myriad of worlds that had the guts to call Wan Shi and Wan Yue out...

“Huang Xiaolong!”

In an instant, the faces of everyone in the hall changed.

His name seemed to be a million-pound boulder that smashed into the hearts of Yan Tianhai, Chen Jixuan, and the others. Their bodies started to tremble as they found it hard to breathe. A look of fear flashed through their eyes.

As shock overwhelmed them, a terrifying wave of energy slammed into the hall as the Gold Essence Emperor Palace shook. A huge blast resounded through the air as the protective barrier around the emperor palace shattered.

Yan Tianhai and the rest felt their worlds turning upside down.

As the Gold Essence Emperor Palace trembled and shook, a black-haired young man rode on an azure cow as he slowly made his way towards the main hall. A middle-aged man and a massive python flew behind them.

When they saw Huang Xiaolong’s face, everyone’s expression changed.

In the blink of an eye, Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived in the space above the Gold Essence Emperor Palace’s main hall.

They didn’t bother hiding their aura as their Sovereign’s will surged towards everyone as it threatened to swallow them whole. They were like defenseless babies facing an incoming tsunami as endless fear gripped their hearts. A mountain-like pressure descended on everyone in the main hall.

Plop, plop, plop...

The overwhelming pressure forced Yan Tianhai and the others to their knees. No matter how loud Yan Tianhai roared and no matter how hard he circulated the godforce in his body, he failed to get to his feet. His back was forced into an arch as the robe on his body was ripped to shreds by the crushing force.

A crackling noise soon resounded through the air as Yan Tianhai’s spine was ripped out, piece by piece. Streams of blood formed as they dyed the floor red.

Yan Tianhai wasn’t the only one who was suffering. None of the experts in the hall managed to escape Huang Xiaolong’s wrath as their bodies started to crumble.

The feeling of death filled the hall, and Yan Tianhai raged, “Huang Xiaolong, now that Lord Wan Shi has emerged from seclusion, your doomsday isn’t too far away! If you’re strong enough, go fight him in the City of All-Heavens! What do you have to prove by killing an Emperor Realm cultivator like me?!”

A sneer left Huang Xiaolong’s lips. “Relax. I’ll head over to the City of All-Heavens to look for Wan Shi after killing you guys.”

“I was too lazy to deal with all of you when I returned to the Divine World. However, you had the guts to order your disciples to hunt down the members of my Grandmist Emperor Palace!” A wave of killing intent burst out from Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he spat, “None of you will be able to live past tomorrow!”

Huang Xiaolong raised his palm and slapped downwards.

With earth-shattering momentum, Huang Xiaolong’s palm came crashing down on the Gold Essence Emperor Palace. All the restrictions around the palace crumbled, and everyone in the main hall was smashed into the ground.

After twenty breaths of time, the Gold Essence Emperor Palace, which once held a lofty position in the Divine World, disappeared from the face of the earth. A giant palm print replaced the Gold Essence Emperor Palace that spanned across billions upon billions of miles.

“Let’s go. We’ll head over to the Appearanceless Emperor Palace.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t mess around, and he quickly decided on another target.

Several days later, the Appearanceless Emperor Palace, the Great Heaven Emperor Palace, and several dozen others were exterminated by Huang Xiaolong. The thing they had in common was that every single one of them had ordered their disciples to hunt down the remaining members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace.

When the news of Huang Xiaolong exterminating the Gold Essence Emperor Palace started to spread, the entire world shook. Everyone felt that as long as they submitted to the City of All-Heavens, they would be able to roam around the Divine World unhindered with Lord Wan Shi as their backer. They had never been more wrong as the news of Huang Xiaolong exterminating dozens of emperor palaces caused their hearts to tremble with fear.

When Huang Xiaolong settled the matters with the emperor palaces that hunted down the members of the Grandmist Emperor Palace, he returned to the Grandmist Lands in order to bring his family members to one of the safe spots he had created in Hell.

As for all the factions in the various worlds that submitted to the City of All-Heavens, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to handle them himself. He quickly passed down his order to the Netherworld King’s Organization, the Radiance Knight Corp, and the Heavenless Devil Legion to wipe them out.

After passing down his order, he left for the City of All-Heavens with the little cow, Cang Mutian, and the Flying Devil Python.
