After spending several hundred million, Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at Tiger Forest City.

This was one of the main cities of the Fortune Mainland. Because Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived through the transmission array, they were one step ahead of many other cultivators with the same destination. Thus, there were a lot less people in Tiger Forest City.

Even so, this was a prosperous and bustling city.

Before Huang Xiaolong could say anything, his expression froze as Yao Chi pulled his arm, requesting to stay in Tiger Forest City for two days.

Sweat trickled down Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, but as Yao Chi stared at him with her big eyes shining with anticipation, he woodenly nodded his head in agreement.

During the day, he was dragged out to go shopping with Yao Chi, while at night Huang Xiaolong cultivated, swallowing one hundred drops of Phoenix blood.

Ever since he returned from the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, every time Huang Xiaolong absorbed the purple grandmist aura, his comprehension deepened. Based on this manner of progress, Huang Xiaolong had a feeling that he would soon be able to step into the first stage of the Grandmist Parasite Medium!

At that time, he would be the third person in this universe who succeeded in cultivating the Grandmist Parasite Medium.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong’s group traveled onward.

Roughly two months later, they arrived at the Fortune City.

In order to have more time to cultivate, Huang Xiaolong spent several billions on transmission arrays along the way to shorten the traveling time.

The Fortune City was built on the centermost ancient plains of the Fortune Mainland. Its city walls pierced through the clouds, exuding an immemorial aura and a solemnity that was hard to describe.

Huang Xiaolong’s group stood for a long time at a distance of twenty thousand li outside of Fortune City.

Quite some time had passed when they moved toward the city, following the wide road leading to the main city gates.

On the road were various groups of cultivators heading in the same direction.

After paying the required entry tax, Huang Xiaolong’ group walked through the city gates into the Fortune City, a little over a month before the All-Islands Great War began. Thus, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry to register, instead focusing on finding an accommodation.

Although they had reached the Fortune City one month early, many of the restaurants were packed with guests.

After a day of bitter searching, Huang Xiaolong’s group finally rented a courtyard somewhere slightly far away from the main streets. By the time they settled down, the sky had completely darkened. Under the night sky, they familiarized themselves with the Fortune City as they planned to head to the registration location tomorrow.

The Fortune City was just as bustling at night, bright lights lit up the streets as if it was day.

Sitting cross-legged inside his room, Huang Xiaolong took out one hundred drops of Phoenix blood, swallowing them all before beginning to cultivate.

From the beginning until now, he had consumed over ten thousand drops of blood. Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation had advanced to peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

The problem was, breaking through to the Ancient God Realm would cause a big scene and might last half a year, perhaps even more. The All-Islands Great War was only a month away, therefore Huang Xiaolong decided to delay consuming the Ancestral Dragon Fruit.

After all, he was confident that his current strength was enough to grab the first place.

On top of that, Huang Xiaolong thought of suppressing his own strength, continuously accumulating energy. As such, when he consumed the Ancestral Dragon Fruit he could directly advance to late-First Order or peak late-First Order Ancient God Realm; perhaps even Second Order Ancient God Realm!

Although knowing that the probability of advancing to Second Order Heavenly God Realm in one go was a daydream, it didn’t mean it was impossible.

Just like in the lower realm, where no one was able to breakthrough from God Realm to Second Order Highgod Realm in one go. However, he who had the four divine fires managed to do it!

Remembering the four divine fires, Huang Xiaolong was a little vexed. Ever since he had ascended to the Divine World, the four divine fires had been slumbering in his body without any movement.

Could it be they would only awaken after he broke through to the Ancient God Realm?

In the lower realm the four divine fires could absorb chaos energy, what about now?

As he stepped closer toward the Ancient God Realm, Huang Xiaolong began to look forward with anticipation.

When Huang Xiaolong left his room and arrived in the yard, Lu Zhuo, Zhu Huan, Ren Changhai and the others were already waiting for him.

Yao Chi wasn’t participating in the All-Islands Great War, so it wasn’t necessary for her follow Huang Xiaolong and the others to the registration and assessment point, but she was adamant in going along and Huang Xiaolong could only concede.

The place they were staying at was a long distance from the registration square and they only arrived half a day later. When Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at the registration square, a sea of heads filled their sights.

Fortunately, other than the top ten islands having a quota of fifteen participants, the weaker islands were given five quotas each, limiting the total participating disciples under six hundred thousand. If all islands’ disciples were allowed to participate, forget this square, the entire Fortune City couldn’t hold them all.

A while after Huang Xiaolong arrived at the registration square, across them, a new group of people arrived as well.

Lu Zhuo and Yao Chi’s faces changed visibly seeing them—Ouyang Clan!

This group was none other than people from Ouyang Clan. Walking at the front of the group was the clan’s Young Lord, Ouyang Yunfei, while accompanying him were Grand Elder Ouyang Jiang, Ouyang Xun, as well as the other four participants.

The Ouyang Clan’s Ancestor, Ouyang Bin, and their Patriarch, Ouyang Xuguang, were nowhere in sight.

At the same time, Ouyang Jiang and Ouyang Xun also saw Lu Zhuo and Yao Chi. Ouyang Jiang leaned toward Ouyang Yunfei, whispering, “Young Lord, the Barbarian God Sect group, that’s the female disciple named Yao Chi.”

“Oh,” Ouyang Yunfei was surprised but that did not stop his gaze from falling onto Yao Chi’s body. His eyes lit up immediately and strode over towards Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Although Huang Xiaolong didn’t know how Ouyang Yunfei, or any of the Ouyang Clan people looked like, the robes they were wearing told Huang Xiaolong enough. His gaze was fixed on these people’s faces.

At this time, Lu Zhuo leaned closer to Huang Xiaolong, saying, “Those two are the Ouyang Clan’s Grand Elders, Ouyang Jiang and Ouyang Xun! That young man is likely to be their Young Lord, Ouyang Yunfei.”

Ouyang Yunfei!

A cold light flickered across Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Possessing Malapert Beast Physique, having already broken through to the Ancient God Realm, with a high chance of entering the top one hundred—Ouyang Yunfei!

Ouyang Yunfei ignored Lu Zhuo, Huang Xiaolong and the rest, going straight to Yao Chi with a smiling face saying, “I am Ouyang Yunfei, the Ouyang Clan’s Young Lord. I have heard from Grand Elder Ouyang Jiang about Miss Yao Chi’s unparalleled beauty; meeting you today, I have to say that you’re the most beautiful woman I have ever seen!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yao Chi glared icily at him, but did not speak, causing Ouyang Yunfei to merely chuckle. He looked around, finally noticing Lu Zhuo and the others’ presence, looking bemused when his gaze fell on Huang Xiaolong. “Peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm? Wow, I didn’t expect a small Barbarian God Sect to be able to nurture a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm disciple.”

In the past, among forces such as the Barbarian God Sect, disciples of Ninth Order and mid-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm were hard to come by.

Ouyang Jiang snickered, “Just a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm, in front of Young Lord, that’s nothing at all. This Young Lord’s pinky is more than enough to squash a hundred such common disciples!”

Ouyang Yunfei chuckled, then said to Lu Zhuo, “Lu Zhuo, don’t worry, for the sake of that Black Flame Sea Emperor Beast, I’ll look after your Barbarian God Sect disciples in the All-Islands Great War.”
