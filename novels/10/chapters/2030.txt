Chapter 2031: Six Winged Green Mosquito

Huang Xiaolong laughed when he heard what she said. Reaching the late-Sixth Order Emperor Realm came as a surprise to him as well. As long as he refined the Divine Artifact Devil Stele, there was a ninety percent chance of him breaking through to the Seventh Order Emperor Realm.

Seventh Order Emperor Realm!

The moment he entered the high-level Emperor Realm, anyone under the Sovereign Realm could dream on if they wanted to touch him!

With the five devil steles, six great chaos lightning pools, the City of Eternity, the Heavenly Hall, the Radiance Divine Scepter, the Nine Yin Magic Mirror, and other top-tier treasures, he would be confident of killing even peak late-Tenth Order Emperors.

Unless it was a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor who had extremely terrifying combat ability, no one would be able to fight Huang Xiaolong.

An example of someone who could fight him would probably be Di Jing if he broke through to the peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

“Let’s go. We’re going to locate the Divine Artifact Devil Stele!” Huang Xiaolong didn’t slow down as he turned to relay his order. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Since he had used four whole years to refine the Imperial Beast Devil Stele, Huang Xiaolong didn’t wish to waste any more time. He needed to locate the Divine Artifact Devil Stele as quickly as possible.

“Yes, Your Majesty!”

Wu Shaowu and the Emperors from the two emoires responded in unison. They followed behind Huang Xiaolong’s group of three as they continued their search.

Since Wu Shaowu had already searched through a whole bunch of places, they quickly excluded those areas. They quickly narrowed in on the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

Summoning the Undead Netherguards, twelve winged angels, the ice dragons, and the four odd beasts, Huang Xiaolong sent them out along with the Emperors from the two emperor countries to locate the devil stele.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor Wu Shaowu formed a group with all the surrendered Emperors, while the hundred Netherguards formed another. The angels were also sent out as a group, and so were the ice dragons.

With the strength of each group, Huang Xiaolong was sure that they wouldn’t run into any sort of trouble.

As for Huang Xiaolong, he left with the little cow and the King of Darkness.

As they flew forwards, the four devil steles in Huang Xiaolong’s body shook, and he turned his head to look at one of the divine planes not too far away. A look of joy appeared on his face.

“The Divine Artifact Devil Stele is up ahead!” Huang Xiaolong pointed at the world surface and exclaimed.

The little cow increased her speed and shot towards the world surface. In the blink of an eye, they arrived there. However, the little cow stopped and a frown formed on her face. “Xiaolong, you had best be careful. I’ve been here in the past, and there are ancient restrictions all around. This is the territory of the Six Winged Green Mosquito.”

“Six Winged Green Mosquitoes?” A trace of suspicion flashed past Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

This was the first time he had heard of the Six Winged Green Mosquitos.

However, he knew that he had to remain cautious if someone like the little cow reminded him about it. It seemed as though things were going to get troublesome.

The King of Darkness gasped in surprise when he heard what she said. “The territory of the Six Winged Green Mosquitos?” It was clear he knew about their existence.

The little cow nodded and continued, “That’s right... They are a type of venomous mosquito, and it’s said that the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race used to terrorize the Divine World in the Desolate Era. In the past, they were the most venomous of creatures in existence, and even the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had a huge headache when dealing with them.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned when he heard the news.

A solemn expression appeared on the King of Darkness’s face. “The poison from the Six Winged Green Mosquito is something no one can find an antidote for. Even Sovereign Realm experts couldn’t protect themselves from the poison. If they managed to sting any Sovereign Realm expert, their bodies would turn stiff...”

“The horrors of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race isn’t something we can describe with words.” The little cow continued, “In the past, they were invincible existences, and no one dared to mess with them. They were extremely arrogant, and because of that, they killed the prince of the Radiance World. It angered the Radiance Ancestor, and he personally made a move and wiped them out.”

Huang Xiaolong would have never expected that the Radiance Ancestor would be the one to personally exterminate the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race.

The King of Darkness continued, “Even though the Radiance Ancestor tried to wipe them out, not all of them died. They went missing after that, and everyone thought that they were extinct. I never thought that they would be hiding here...”

“In the past, I chanced across this place and found traces of them. Even though their poison is extremely unique and nearly incurable, you have the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance. Their poison can’t do a thing to you.” The little cow said slowly.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

However, even if the poison couldn’t affect Huang Xiaolong, the three of them became extremely careful as they entered the divine plane.

Huang Xiaolong rode on the little cow as they inched forward. He circulated the energy of the four devil steles as he tried to locate the fifth.

Very quickly, he felt something.

“There! It’s in the southeastern direction!” Huang Xiaolong transmitted his voice to the little cow.

The little cow turned into a streak of light as she flew in the direction Huang Xiaolong pointed out.

Following behind them, the King of Darkness restrained his aura. Even though they were both mid-level Sovereigns and were completely unafraid of the Six Winged Green Mosquitos, it was better to avoid clashing with them when Huang Xiaolong refined the devil stele.

After flying for some time, Huang Xiaolong pointed to a mountain range below them, and he said, “There!”

The little cow shook her head and swallowed a mouthful of saliva. “There’s no way...”

Huang Xiaolong and the King of Darkness turned their gazes over to her and waited for her explanation. “That’s the nest of the Six Winged Green Mosquitos... There are tons of restrictions there, and venomous creatures roaming the lands. Poison is everywhere in the air, and it’s a sort of restriction set down by the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race. They will notice us as soon as we enter the mountain range.”

“Is there no other way?” Huang Xiaolong frowned as he racked his brains for ideas.

“Unless we can form a stable space tunnel, it’s impossible to enter undetected. However, the space around the Devil Pool is extremely unstable. It’s incredibly dangerous to create a space tunnel. If anyone attacks us, the tunnel will collapse immediately.”

“If we barge in, how confident are you in stopping them?” Huang Xiaolong turned to the two Sovereigns and asked.

The little cow stared at the King of Darkness and pondered over it for a second. “The old ancestor had strength comparable to Shi Ming. However, he was heavily injured by the Radiance Ancestor. No one knows if he has recovered.”

The only being they were afraid of was the old ancestor of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race.

The King of Darkness piped up all of a sudden. “My injuries aren’t healed. If I return to my peak state, I can join hands with Old Ancestor Azure Cow to suppress them. Even if the old ancestor of the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race recovers, he won’t be a threat. But...”

A light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

In the end, he decided to kill his way in.

He had to obtain the Divine Artifact Devil Stele no matter the cost.

Huang Xiaolong instantly recalled all his forces.

When they finally arrived to regroup with him, Huang Xiaolong told everyone about the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race situation.

When Wu Shaowu heard the name ‘Six Winged Green Mosquito,’ he jumped in fright.

There were nearly no Sovereign Realm experts who didn’t know the Six Winged Green Mosquito Race’s terror.

The strength they had possessed in the past was no lesser than the current Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

“Advance!” After explaining the situation, Huang Xiaolong no longer hesitated as he gave the order to attack.
