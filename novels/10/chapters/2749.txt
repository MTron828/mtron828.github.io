Chapter 2750: Can a Lone True Saint Such as Yourself Resist the Three Sacred Lands’ Armies?

All-Heavens Sacred Land Patriarch Zhu Xu was a little awkward looking at his panting disciple’s excitement and admiration.

When he had guessed thatCangqiong Sacred Land had trump cards, he had definitely not considered Huang Xiaolong to be one of those trump cards.

How could it be Huang Xiaolong? It is actually Huang Xiaolong?!

For a moment, various thoughts sped across Zhu Xu’s head, and a surge of complex emotions rushed through his chest.

He watched Huang Xiaolong curiously. Did hee actually destroy a Seventh Heaven Primal Ancestor’s physical body? Even though the long spear in the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s ancestor’s hand was merely a low-grade dao artifact, the result was still very shocking.

How much stronger was this attack compared to the dao artifact to shatter it into pieces? How much stronger is his body compared to the spear to be able to do that?

Zhu Xu was unnerved, and so were the other spectators, especially the ones scheming to grab some bargains. Similar thoughts ran across their minds as Zhu Xu’s.

The ones fantasizing about picking a lot of bargains after the three sacred lands’ armies had annihilated the Cangqiong Sacred Land, suddenly felt their backs dampened by cold sweat.

Huang Xiaolong threw the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s ancestor’s dao soul into the Cangqiong Dao Palace before turning to look at Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the rest hiding amongst the three sacred lands’ armies.

“I already warned you that the three sacred lands’ armies are doomed, and they can’t protect you.” Huang Xiaolong went on calmly, “I don’t want to say it for the third time, so roll out here on your own, or do I have to make you?”

Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and the other three worshiped experts looked deathly pale, and they were absolutely terrified.

Tang Long, Han Mo, and Chu Yifan’s expressions were extremely ugly despite their shock from Huang Xiaolong’s display of strength. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was mainly because of Huang Xiaolong’s blatant disregard for them.

It was especially so for Tang Long. His expression was the most distorted of all. Huang Xiaolong had destroyed one of his most loyal and capable general’s body right before him.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even glanced at him from the beginning, even though he was the patriarch of Tang Dragon Sacred Land.

His subordinate was killed, yet Huang Xiaolong hadn’t bothered to look at him!

Tang Long felt suffocated and insulted. An overwhelming killing intent brewed in his chest as he fixed his deathly stare on Huang Xiaolong.

Compared to Tang Long’s fury, Han Mo, Chu Yifan, as well as Cangqiong Old Man himself and the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s experts behind him were more shocked rather than furious.

Cangqiong Old Man had been agape from the moment Huang Xiaolong had destroyed the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor expert.

Long Jianfei’s words from a few days back rang in Cangqiong Old Man’s mind. He had said that Tang Long was planning to annihilate Cangqiong Sacred Land, but he didn’t know that they were the ones waiting for his arrival, so that their Young Lord could take this chance to annihilate the three sacred lands in one fell swoop.

He recalled the time when Duan Feng had admitted that he was no match against Huang Xiaolong. These people had also said to him that Huang Xiaolong alone could handle the three sacred lands’ sixty-eight Primal Ancestors…

He looked dazedly at his disciple’s back, as if this was the first time he had really known this personal disciple of his.

Naturally, the shock other Cangqiong Sacred Land’s experts were experiencing was even greater.

Huang Xiaolong’s face sank after seeing that Cheng Yueyang, Gao Chen, and those hiding amongst the three armies had moved further inside rather than coming out voluntarily. “In that case, I’ll make you roll out here!”

Huang Xiaolong could even consider sparing the experts of three sacred lands’ armies, but he had no fraction of mercy for traitors like Chen Birui, Cheng Yueyang, and other worshiped experts, who had betrayed Cangqiong Sacred Land.

“Enough!” Before Huang Xiaolong could take further action, Tang Long, who had been silent so far, yelled angrily. “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you disrespect me? Do you really think you can fend off our three sacred land’s armies alone? I don’t believe a Ninth Heaven True Saint is capable of going against the three sacred lands!”

Tang Long didn’t believe that, neither did Han Mo.

The two of them summoned their dao artifacts almost simultaneously.

Tang Long held a huge dragon knife in his hand, and it looked like he was holding a great dragon mountain that seemed to be pressing down on him.

On the other hand, the dao artifact in Han Mo’s hand looked a little strange, like a clod of triangle-shaped soil! It was made using black grains of sand, compacted together in a triangle.

These two dao artifacts were the two sacred lands’ most powerful weapons, and they were called the Tang Dragon Knife and the Freezing Desert Mountain!

Both of them were mid-grade dao artifacts, the kind of mid-grade that was very close to high-grade.

The Tang Dragon Knife and the Freezing Desert Mountain had accompanied the two sacred lands’ patriarchs for numerous years, and they were stained with the deaths of many experts. Hence, the two dao artifacts were famous in their own rights. The experts watching from a distance lost their easy demeanor after seeing Tang Long and Han Mo taking out the Tang Dragon Knife and the Freezing Desert Mountain.

Chu Yifan hesitated after Tang Long and Han Mo took out their dao artifacts. Before departing, he had vowed that he would follow Tang Long all the way, which had stemmed from his confidence towards Tang Long. Now that he had seen Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess that was more terrifying than the Devil Holy Prince, his confidence swayed.

Perhaps, I can choose to adapt to the situation accordingly? Maybe even form an alliance with Huang Xaolong?

In all honesty, there wasn’t that big of a grudge between him and Huang Xiaolong. Chu Zhouyun, whose physical body was destroyed by Huang Xiaolong, was merely a personal disciple to an Eminent Elder of Chufan Sacred Land. At the end of the day, Chu Zhouyun was merely one of the many core disciples of Chufan Sacred Land. It didn’t really matter that he had died, and it was definitely not worthy to tear faces with Huang Xiaolong just for that reason.

Chu Yifan’s hesitation did not escape Tang Long’s notice. His face sank, and his voice hardened, “Chu Yifan, do you think Huang Xiaolong will spare your sacred land if you retreat at this point? Even if you retreat and seek peace now, Huang Xiaolong will annihilate your Chufan Sacred Land just the same. We can only succeed by having one united heart and sincere cooperation!”

“As long as our three sacred lands cooperate, we can absolutely kill this punk!” Tang Long’s voice hammered on Chu Yifan’s and the Chufan Sacred Lands’ experts’ hearts.

Chu Yifan frowned.

Then, Tang Long directed his words at the experts hovering in the distance, “I advise you all—don’t gloat. If Huang Xiaolong really succeeds in annihilating Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land, he will target your sacred lands next!”

The faces of these experts and sacred lands’ masters changed greatly, including the All-Heavens Sacred Land’s master Zhu Xu’s.

A moment ago, they were shocked by Huang Xiaolong’s combat prowess, but none of them had thought this far.

Although Tang Long’s words were slightly grasping at shadows, it remained the truth that there was such a possibility.

For a moment, some of these experts were persuaded. After all, Huang Xiaolong did seem like a bigger threat than Tang Dragon Sacred Land and Freezing Desert Sacred Land. They thought that if they could join hands with these two sacred lands and eliminate this risk, it might not be a bad thing.

“Master.” Ren Yifei looked at his master. Zhu Xu seemed calm on the surface and did not respond.

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly as he watched Tang Long trying to rope these spectating experts into his camp. In truth, he really didn’t care if there were a few more or a dozen more Primal Ancestors. Currently, he was only scrupulous against Dao Venerables.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong did not stop Tang Long. Instead, he watched with interest how these spectators were going to choose.
