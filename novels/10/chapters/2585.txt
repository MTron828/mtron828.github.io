Chapter 2586: Accident

Before the envoy could say anything, the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor raised his hand to stop him. As he looked at his disciple, who was ground into meat paste outside the hall, a terrifying aura emerged from his body as he stared at Huang Xiaolong.

“Do you know the consequences of your actions?!” He growled as he glared at Huang Xiaolong coldly.

He hadn’t thought that Huang Xiaolong would actually kill his disciple for merely blocking his way to the entrance, and his face was jet black.

“I have no idea. Why don’t you tell me what will happen?” Huang Xiaolong responded.

Everyone in the hall stared at Huang Xiaolong with a dumbfounded expression.

Teng Yan sneered at the side as he knew that the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor would do whatever it took to kill Huang Xiaolong even without his encouragement.

“Hehe! You’re just a Second Heaven True Saint from the human race. How dare you act so arrogantly in my territory?” Everyone from the Alien Lands was enraged when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s actions. The Dragon Fish Holy Emperor was the first to speak out. Pointing at Huang Xiaolong, he sneered, “Get to your knees right now and start crawling over! Otherwise, we’ll kill you right here and now!”

The Dragon Fish Holy Emperor wasn’t weak. He was at the peak of the late-Second Heaven True Saint Realm. It wasn’t surprising that he believed that he could kill Huang Xiaolong with a snap of his fingers.

However, the words barely left his lips when Hei Luo reached out to throw the man into his mouth.

Crunching down several times, Hei Luo swallowed the Dragon Fish Holy Emperor without batting an eyelid.

“What?!” Everyone screamed in shock. They stared at Hei Luo with a terrified gaze, and the envoy who had brought them there felt his legs going soft.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with them as he slowly walked deeper into the hall.

“You…!” The Hong Zhen Holy Emperor panicked, and he didn’t know how to react.

By the time Teng Yan and the others snapped back to reality, none of them dared to scream at Huang Xiaolong. Even though most of them were in the Third Heaven True Saint Realm or higher, they knew that they were no match for someone who could devour a late-Second Heaven True Saint in a matter of seconds.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong arrived at the main seat of the hall, a yell escaped from the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s lips. A sharp blade appeared in his hand as the holy runes on it lit up before he pierced it towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Die!”

Before the blade could enter Huang Xiaolong’s body, it was stopped between two fingers.&nbsp;

With his thumb and forefinger, Huang Xiaolong held the blade firmly in place.

As endless shock ran through the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s mind, and the others stared at the scene before them with their jaws agape.

With the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s strength at the late-First Heaven True Saint Realm, he would definitely be able to cause some damage to Huang Xiaolong in such close proximity.

“Are you surprised?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he exerted some force between his fingers, and the sharp blade snapped into several pieces instantly.

Teng Yan and the others stared at the remains of the blade with an incredulous expression.

That was a holy artifact they were looking at! Even if it was the lowest-graded holy artifact, it wasn’t something high-level True Saints could destroy! However, Huang Xiaolong had only used two fingers to turn it into scrap metal! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Wouldn’t that mean…

Reaching out with his other hand, Huang Xiaolong grabbed the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s neck, and he sighed, “You made one slight miscalculation when you decided to attack me.”

Under his terrified gaze, Huang Xiaolong’s Inextinguishable Dao Heart emerged before he could defend himself. As it pierced into the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor’s chest, the man started to wither at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Inextinguishable… Inextinguishable Dao Heart!” The various experts screamed as they fell to the ground.

As for the envoy of the Hong Zhen Holy Gate, he fainted instantly.

After killing the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at Teng Yan and the others.

However, they acted before he could react. Teng Yan rushed over and fell to his knees, “We greet Lord Primal Ancestor! We didn’t know that Lord Primal Ancestor would grace us with his presence, and we hope that he will show mercy!”

After seeing the Dao Heart, everyone assumed that Huang Xiaolong was a Primal Ancestor.

The various experts were stunned for a second, but they quickly copied Teng Yan’s actions.

In the Alien Lands, the alien race reigned supreme. Those from the human race were existences equivalent to ants, and they were only worthy of being slaves to the members of the Alien Race. It was impossible to see a member of the Alien Race kneeling to a human, even if they were a True Saint.

Reaching out suddenly, Huang Xiaolong dragged Teng Yan over.

“Lord Primal Ancestor, this…” Teng Yan screamed in panic.

“Didn’t you plan on asking me to pay for my sins?” Huang Xiaolong snorted. “You can die now.” With a wave of his arm, Teng Yan was devoured.

After devouring the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor and Teng Yan, Huang Xiaolong could feel a slight increase in the abilities of his three complete dao saint godheads.

Not a single person dared to hesitate after witnessing Huang Xiaolong’s actions of killing Teng Yan without the slightest remorse. They crawled over as their bodies trembled in fear.

In the plaza outside the main hall, the experts of the Scarlet Giant Holy Gate and the other factions stared at the entrance of the hall, expecting a good show to play out. After all, the main hall was covered with layers upon layers of restrictions, and it was impossible for people of their level to detect the changes inside.

“What do you think happened to the brat after he entered the hall?” someone asked.

“With so many holy emperors sitting in the hall, he’ll definitely be beaten up to the last inch of his life. He will definitely regret his actions of attacking the disciple guarding the door…” an expert from the Jade Cauldron Holy Gate spoke.

As discussions filled the air, the restriction around the gate opened.

Messages flew out of the hall unobstructed as the various holy emperors summoned the experts under them.

After receiving the order, not a single person dared to disobey no matter how weird they felt it was. Feeling a trace of joy appearing in their hearts, the experts rushed into the main hall.&nbsp;

However, everything changed when they entered.&nbsp;

They stared at their respective leaders who were kneeling before Huang Xiaolong and they didn’t understand what was going on.

Looking at the main seat in the hall, they noticed the brat from the human race! The Hong Zhen Holy Emperor was nowhere to be seen!

No matter how hard they tried, they failed to locate the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor.

“Patriarch, this…”

“Where’s the Hong Zhen Holy Emperor?”

Questions started flying around instantly.

…

Several minutes later, every single expert from the Alien Lands dropped to their knees before Huang Xiaolong.&nbsp;

Those who weren’t willing to submit were killed by Hei Luo.

With the restrictions covering the main hall, no one in the outside world noticed the change, and the experts of the Alien Lands were revelling in the festivities, not knowing that the heavens had already changed!
