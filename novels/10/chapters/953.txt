Watching that figure accelerating towards him, Huang Xiaolong’s forehead creased slightly. He could already guess what scheme the other side was trying to play out; it was clear as day that the figure wanted to unload those fierce beasts chasing him onto Huang Xiaolong, using Huang Xiaolong as a shield to block those fierce beasts so he could escape.

Even if Huang Xiaolong’s strength wasn’t sufficient, it would be enough to delay those fierce beasts for short while, which was enough to increase his own chances of escaping.

As the fleeing figure closed in, Huang Xiaolong could see that he was a middle-aged man with a round face, and small beady eyes. A single look at this middle-aged man and one could tell this was a scheming, calculating person.

From the distance, the middle-aged man shouted, “Hey, Brother, which sect’s disciple are you from? How about we cooperate and kill these ignorant fierce beasts, I’ll split half the treasures inside the city with you!”

Afraid that Huang Xiaolong would not help him, the middle-aged man threw out a bait, claiming there was some sort of treasure.

Huang Xiaolong suddenly lifted an arm, his palm striking out.

In one move, the several fierce beasts that were pursuing the middle-aged man split into pieces. Flesh and blood shot out like arrows.

In the next second, several black shadows escaped from the divided body parts, the fierce beasts’ yin souls. The fierce beasts in the Path to Hell didn’t have godheads, only the yin soul. Their yin souls were similar to the ghost souls of ghost creatures.

The ghost qi within the fierce beasts from the Path to Hell was an innate factor. Due to this, they were also called ghost beasts.

Seeing the several fierce beasts’ yin souls trying to flee, Huang Xiaolong’s hand extended, causing a powerful attractive force to bind them and bring them to him. Then, his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power came to life, swallowing them in an instant, converting them into godforce.

In fact, Ghost King’s Blood Pact Mandate that Huang Xiaolong had obtained back in Martial Spirit World also allowed him to devour all kinds of ghost creatures, it was just that the technique’s devouring speed was a lot slower compared to his Archdevil Supreme Godhead. Therefore, Huang Xiaolong did not use the Blood Pact Mandate technique.

The middle-aged man watched with mouth agape, then his body couldn’t stop shuddering.

Each one of those fierce beasts chasing him just now was almost as strong as a Fourth Order Highgod Realm human master.

But all of them were killed in an instant!

And that black-haired young man could actually devour their yin souls. Could he be...?!

The middle-aged man’s throat suddenly felt itchy from dryness. He swallowed several times before very, very cautiously stepping toward Huang Xiaolong, extremely polite as he inquired, “May I know which sect Senior is from? This one is a Spiriting Demon Gates’ Elder, Zhao Yucheng.”

“Spiriting Demon Gates’ Elder Zhao Yucheng?” Huang Xiaolong observed the middle-aged man for a moment, then said, “I just entered the Path to Hell from outside. Tell me, what is that so-called treasure you mentioned just now?”

The middle-aged man was stunned, then an obvious expression of relief appeared on his face when he heard Huang Xiaolong say he was from the outside. He then hurried to answer, “Replying to Senior’s question, this ruined city used to be the Path to Hell’s Mad Ghost Sect, a first rank force in the Path to Hell in the past. Its overall strength was the highest after the six super forces, but it was destroyed by the Ghost Refining Sect later on.”

“But, some time ago, I happen to read from an old record that the Mad Ghost Sect has one secret treasury hidden somewhere in the city. That’s why I am here, trying to search for it, but who would have thought that several fierce beasts would appear just as I found the treasure. Fortunately, there was Senior to lend a helping hand just now, otherwise, I’d have been torn to pieces by them!”

Mad Ghost Sect?

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered, “Take me there.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Yes, Senior.” The Spiriting Demon Gates’ Elder Zhao Yucheng immediately complied with respect and dared not play any tricks. He flew into the ruined city, leading the way for Huang Xiaolong.

As they flew into the city, Huang Xiaolong observed his surroundings. Although the city was badly damaged, from the architecture of these buildings, he could see the majestic shadow of a powerful, ancient sect.

On the way, they ran into a few Yin Ghosts of Third Order Highgod Realm strength. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be bothered with this level of prey, flicking out a sliver of fire element godforce to incinerate them in an instant.

Low-level Highgod Realm Yin Ghosts’ energy was too poor in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. Even if he devoured ten thousand of them, his strength would barely increase.

Watching Huang Xiaolong easily exterminate a group of Third Order Highgod Realm Yin Ghosts, Elder Zhao Yucheng was so terrified that he dared not even think about anything else.

Roughly a little more than an hour later, he brought Huang Xiaolong to a desolate courtyard.

Upon arriving, Elder Zhao Yucheng made a hard to understand hand seal, hitting it to the air. A black space tunnel appeared in front of them.

Without delay, both of them flashed into the tunnel.

The scenery changed before their eyes. They had arrived in a several thousand square meters magnificent hall.

All the drawers lining up the four walls were filled to the brim with various kinds of medicinal pellets.

With a sweep of his divine sense, Huang Xiaolong discovered that more than half of these medicinal pellets were sacred grade divine pills that had been lost in the flow of time. Moreover, most of them were rank eight and nine tribulation grade divine pellets!

Right at the center of the great hall was a bone-thin old man, sitting cross-legged.

From the appearance of his attire, he had probably been a Mad Ghost Sect expert, a peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm master, before his death. Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense swept over the old man, confirming that he was truly dead. The old man’s godhead was shattered into a dozen pieces.

Shattered by a person’s palm force! Huang Xiaolong was inwardly shocked.

This Mad Ghost Sect expert had been a peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm master before his death. The person who could shatter his godhead with a single palm, how terrifying was their strength?!

Huang Xiaolong had to admit that he himself might not be able to do it.

In comparison to this old man who was a peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm master, the devil clan Patriarch Mo Dingtian, a mid-Tenth Order Highgod Realm master, was still significantly weaker.

Had this old man been killed by the Ghost Refining Sect Master? The possibility flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.

On the other hand, ever since he entered, Elder Zhao Yuchang had been staring at the drawers filled with top sacred grade divine pellets with sparkling eyes. However, without Huang Xiaolong’s say so, he dared not touch them.

Cultivation manuals were stacked high in a corner of the great hall. From the looks of it, most of them were the Mad Ghost Sect’s heritage foundation.

Huang Xiaolong put all the cultivation manuals and the Mad Ghost Sect expert’s body into his Asura Ring, as for the medicinal pellets, he took half and left the other half to Zhao Yucheng.

Zhao Yucheng quickly thanked Huang Xiaolong, full of gratitude, without a word or a flicker of dissatisfaction. Of course, even if he did feel any resentment, he wouldn’t dare to show it in front of Huang Xiaolong.

Half an hour later, the two people exited through the black space tunnel.

Huang Xiaolong asked his question casually, “I have something else to ask you, do you know where the Ghost Refining Sect’s location is?”

“Senior wants to go to the Ghost Refining Sect?” Zhao Yucheng was flabbergasted.

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Zhao Yucheng lowered his head, then said, “Senior, although this Junior doesn’t know where the Ghost Refining Sect’s location, I do know something. The other day, the Ghost Refining Sect sent a message to our Spiriting Demon Gates’ Ancestor and Patriarch, ordering them to head to the Ghost Refining Sect to participate in their next Sect Master succession ceremony!”

Huang Xiaolong really didn’t have hopes he’d get any useful information, merely asking in an offhand manner.

But the result was surprising!

“If Senior wants to go to the Ghost Refining Sect, I can bring Senior to see my Spiriting Demon Gates’ Ancestor and Patriarch...” Zhao Yucheng added.

Receiving Huang Xiaolong’s nod of agreement, Zhao Yucheng led him out from the ruined city, rushing back to the Spiriting Demon Gates.
