Chapter 3539: Locating The Black Sea World

With a wave of his hands, the grand formations were activated. Layers of light surrounded the group, and the space they were in became completely separated from the universe.

Ao Yan and the others were shocked as they soared into the skies. They struck at the barrier with everything they had, but they were forced back.

“It’s useless. You won’t be able to break the barrier no matter how hard you try. This is the Sun and Moon Purple Lightning Grand Formation I created.” Huang Xiaolong started to walk towards them. “The formation is controlled by the Sun Moon Furnace and the Purple Lightning Peak, and the only way for you to escape is to obtain the treasures from me.”

Ao Yan and the other two looked at the treasures he held and knew that it was impossible.

Even a God of Creation at the grand completion stage would be unable to snatch the treasures from him!

The blood drained from their faces as panic filled their hearts.

“Huang Xiaolong, my father is nearby… If anything happens to me, he will definitely sense what’s going on! Do you think you can escape if he does?” Ao Yan frowned. “Release me right now! Otherwise, you’ll die a miserable death!”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh. “I might not be able to defeat your father right now, but do you think I’m stupid? Do you think I’ll believe that he’s nearby?”

It went without saying that Ao Yan made up the lie to scare Huang Xiaolong.

There was no way in the world Ao Ying would coincidentally be around the Black Sea.

Peak-level God of Creation Realm experts like Ao Ying would be holding the fort in the Creation Palace most of the time. They wouldn’t head out unless something serious happened, and even if he realized something was wrong, he would need more than half a month to rush over to the Black Sea.

“Ao Yan, the three of you should surrender.” Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of them with a single step. However, they moved the moment he did, and they summoned their creation artifact in an attempt to sneak attack Huang Xiaolong. A golden net appeared above him before he knew it.

The three of them had been planning it the moment they were forced back by the barrier above.

Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback to realize that the golden net was approaching. He didn’t expect it to avoid his senses, and it seemed as though only high-grade creation artifacts would be able to do that! Moreover, it had to be a treasure used to conceal auras!

He might be surprised, but in the face of absolute strength, no tricks would work. There was no way they could stop 6 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and the three of them were sent flying in an instant.

Ao Yan fared the best among the three, as the other two spat out mouthfuls of blood.

…

Half an hour later.

The three of them faced the same end as Chu Long as they were thrown into the Sun Moon Furnace.

After suppressing the three, Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate to leave.

Even though the Creation Palace wasn’t likely to send peak-level God of Creation Realm experts over, nothing was absolute. If they actually had experts who were passing through the area, things might get troublesome. As such, it paid to be safe.

Despite leaving the planet, Huang Xiaolong didn’t leave the Creation Palace’s territory.

Instead, he continued on his way towards the Black Sea.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The safest place to hide was always under the nose of one’s enemies. The Black Sea was the safest place he could be now. The experts of the Creation Palace wouldn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would remain in their territory after capturing five experts on their side.

Avoiding two groups of experts from the Creation Palace, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Black Sea several days later.

As its name suggested, the Black Sea was completely black in color. The water wasn’t the only thing that was black. Even the space above the sea was black in color! The skies were jet black, and one couldn’t see anything around them! Even if someone stood several feet away, they couldn’t be seen!

Huang Xiaolong also discovered that his dao souls were useless in a place like that.

He tried many different ways, but he failed to detect any object a hundred feet away. Not even the power of absolute flame could illuminate the area outside the radius.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong chose to use the four Universe Origin Fires. The moment they appeared, the darkness receded like a tide.

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. He was afraid that even the universe fires wouldn't be enough to pierce the darkness.

After a short pause, Huang Xiaolong entered the Black Sea.

As the fires hovered around him, Huang Xiaolong could detect everything in a hundred million-miles radius.

Not too long after he entered the Black Sea, more than forty figures appeared in the spot where Huang Xiaolong fought with Ao Yan and the others. They were experts of the Creation Palace.

The disappearance of five God of Creation Realm experts had evidently alarmed the Creation Palace. The leader of the group, who appeared, was Ao Ying, Ao Yan’s father!

His expression was sullen as his golden eyes swept across the surroundings. He released his dao soul to try to look for traces of the battle.

“Lord Ao Ying, the person who made the move was a God of Creation at the large completion stage. He should have 6 billion units of grand cosmos energy, and he might be someone Huang Xiaolong hid from the world. Could there actually be someone else working for Huang Xiaolong? Why didn’t Chu Long and Kong Wufang mention anything about him?” one of the experts exclaimed.

“I’m afraid so.” Another silver-haired expert spoke up, “There are three people in the Eternal Heaven Alliance with 6 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Ao Yan and the others had to be captured by one of them!”

“We’ll ask them to hand our members over!”

“It’s no use. They won’t admit to anything without evidence.”

When the members of the Creation Palace were discussing among each other, Ao Ying’s voice boomed through the air. “Listen up. Ten of you form a group and start to comb through the area. Look for Huang Xiaolong or any suspicious expert in the area!”

“Yes!”

Several months passed in the blink of an eye, and the experts of the Creation Palace could only return empty-handed. Huang Xiaolong was like a puff of smoke that disappeared from the world completely.

When Huang Xiaolong captured Ao Yan and the others, he transformed into the Star Dragon Divine Tree and escaped through the cracks in the universe. That was the only way he wouldn’t leave traces of himself. As such, not even the experts of the Creation Palace could discover his presence.

Huang Xiaolong had arrived in the depths of the Black Sea when they were looking for him, and a look of joy could be seen on his face as he looked at the spatial tunnel before him. Without a doubt, the tunnel was a way into the Black Sea World!

With the power of the four Universe Origin Fires and the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong managed to locate the Black Sea World!
