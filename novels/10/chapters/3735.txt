Soon after, a ray of light fell from the void and entered the space between Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows. A memory of the Universe Origin that never existed before in Huang Xiaolong’s mind appeared.

It told him everything he needed to know about the dangers of getting there.

“Many thanks to Senior Star Dragon Universe.” Huang Xiaolong was extremely grateful to the Star Dragon Universe. The piece of information was too important to him. Without it, no one knew how long it would take for him to locate the Universe Origin! Now, he even knew about the dangers that would come with his journey. It made things much easier and it would shorten the time he needed to travel there!

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong left the institution and boarded the Universe Boat. He charged straight for the Universe Origin.

Leaving behind a terrifying tear through space, the Universe Boat soared through the air at a terrifying pace. Huang Xiaolong didn’t care if anyone were to discover his presence.

Several years later, he finally arrived at the space outside the Thirteen Universes.

When he arrived, he discovered that there was nothing as far as his eyes could see. He used his dao souls in order to investigate what lay in the void, but there wasn’t a single sign of life.

After getting his bearings right, Huang Xiaolong continued northwards according to the memory left behind by the Star Dragon Universe.

Half a day later, he arrived at the first layer of natural world barriers.

The barrier was like an endless wall that extended to infinity. It was several hundred meters thick!

Even though it wasn’t as thick as he thought, it was incredibly sturdy! Any attacks that landed on it would be bounced back with increased power. It was nearly impossible for anyone to break a natural world barrier.

However, what might be impossible for most was definitely possible for Huang Xiaolong. With a single punch, he created a massive hole in the barrier.

Soaring forward, he quickly entered the gap he made.

The barrier might stop most half-step Universe Gods, but Huang Xiaolong stood firmly at the peak of the power spectrum in the Thirteen Universes.

Soon after, he ran into the second barrier.

Like before, he did the same thing.

After a whole month, Huang Xiaolong crossed one hundred barriers in total. After the first hundred barriers, it became a lot harder to break them. There were universe storms and black holes that would appear from time to time.

Huang Xiaolong’s speed started to slow down quite a bit. He used a little more than a month to break the next hundred barriers.

Soon came the third and fourth set of barriers.

Huang Xiaolong discovered that for every hundred barriers he broke, the difficulty would increase by a lot. There would be much more dangerous regions that appeared too. For example, there were sharp ice blades and backwinds that appeared.

Saturated Water appeared in the space around him after he crossed the one-thousandth barrier.

When he broke through two thousand barriers, golden rain started to appear!

The golden rain had terrifying corrosive abilities. It was the same as the one used by the Golden Cymbals King. The golden rain around the world barriers was much more terrifying than the ones used by the Golden Cymbals King!

Several dozen years later, Huang Xiaolong arrived at the third set of thousand barriers.

He heaved a long sigh when he arrived.

The first world barrier at the three-thousandth barrier mark was several tens of thousands of meters thick!

Moreover, there were countless runes inscribed on the world barrier. They were like golden earthworms that squirmed around on the barrier and they possessed terrifying strength. Formless pressure filled the space around Huang Xiaolong.

A serious look appeared on his face.

Even though Huang Xiaolong could definitely break a hole through the barrier with his current strength, he summoned the Universe Boat to be safe.

As the strongest universe treasure, Huang Xiaolong was more than confident in its defensive capabilities. 

Entering the third layer of formations on the Universe Boat, Huang Xiaolong circulated his grand cosmos energy as rays of resplendent light emerged from the Universe Boat.

Turning into a streak of golden light, he tore through the barrier. 

The moment he entered the space after the three-thousandth barrier, Huang Xiaolong felt a little suffocated. 

The pressure that came from the Universe Source itself tried to enter the Universe Boat, but Huang Xiaolong quickly poured a little more power into the Universe Boat to repel the weird pressure.

He traveled slowly towards the next barrier. Now, his speed was comparable to a mortal walking on the streets.

He would take several hours to finally cross the barrier.

After half a day, he crossed the world barrier and entered a world that was covered in light.

Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was thrown into an illusion when he looked at the world around him.

Reaching out to touch the light that was all over the place, he was stunned to discover that he couldn’t control the power of light in the area.

Using the power of space, Huang Xiaolong locked down the entire area around the Universe Boat. However, the ball of light wasn’t affected by his power.

He chose to continue onwards warily.

After a day, nothing around him changed. 

…

Even after a year of traveling, the light around him didn't seem to dissipate. Other than the odd light, there was nothing else.

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong felt that Star Dragon Universe might have made a mistake in the location!

Even so, he continued to travel onwards.

Another year of nothingness passed.

Huang Xiaolong felt as though he was the only one left in the universe.

Countess years passed just like that.

However, he felt a wave of fluctuations coming from the Universe Origin itself, and Huang Xiaolong quickly steered the ship towards the direction of the energy waves.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It didn’t take long for him to discover balls of energy hovering in the skies. Even though it was extremely pure, it was still lacking a little compared to the Universe Source Stone he obtained in the past.

Huang Xiaolong felt a sense of excitement buzzing in his heart. The Universe Origin should be close!

After all, the Universe Origin was the only place that could produce such power.

Huang Xiaolong increased his speed once again.
