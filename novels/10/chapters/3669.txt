Chapter 3670 – Nether Yang King

When Huang Xiaolong and the others were waiting, other experts started to arrive along the riverbank.

“That’s the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! The Heavenly Blood Ghost King has arrived!”

“Green Winged Ghost King! Evil Dragon Ghost King!”

Commotion broke out in the crowd as peerless experts started to arrive one by one.

Wang Yue Hong, the Heavenly Blood Ghost King Wei Guang, the Green Winged Ghost King, and Ao Fangwu, the Evil Dragon Ghost King arrived together!

The three of them were Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage. The three of them controlled countless large cities in the area.

“Lord Heavenly Blood Ghost King!”

The experts who hadn’t boarded the ships greeted them when the three of them arrived. Several ancestors who were about to board the ships froze on their spots.

Yue Hong, Wei Guang, and Ao Fangwu nodded at the crowd.

Yue Qing and the other young masters around them went over to greet their fathers.

“Father! You’re finally here!” Yue Qing grinned at Yue Hong.

“We ran into some matters along the way. Looks like we came at the right time!” Yue Hong laughed.

“Father, now that all of you are here, we can board the Supreme Ghost King Ship together!”

Yue Hong, Wei Guang, and Ao Fangwu looked at each other and Wei Guang shook his head eventually. “No. Lord Nether Yang King won’t be the only one arriving later. There are several more terrifying figures. I’m afraid that we won’t be able to board the Supreme Ghost King Ship this time!”

Yue Qing gasped. “Several more terrifying figures?!”

“Yes. I heard that Wu Zun will be coming too.” Wei Guang said in a solemn tone.

“Lord Wu Zun?!” Yue Qing and the others exclaimed in fright.

Wu Zun’s fame in the Green Ghost Lands was legendary! He was an existence who was barely weaker than Lord Nether Yang King!

“That’s right. Lord Wu Zun is coming! He’s not the only one. Senior Bing Yu will be coming too! Lord Jiu Yu is also part of the group.” Ao Fangwu explained.

“Senior Bing Yu!”

“Lord Jiu Yu!”

The expressions on the faces of Yue Qing and the others changed.

Even though Senior Bing Yu wasn’t as strong as Wu Zun, his status was exalted! It was said that he was the master of the Yin Reversal Ghost King! Even though it was just a rumor, that proved his seniority!

As for Lord Jiu Yu, he was Lord Gui Chi’s direct disciple!

That was Lord Gui Chi they were talking about!

Without the Green Ghost personally controlling the matters that took place in the Green Ghost Lands, Gui Chi was king! As Gui Chi’s personal disciple, Jiu Yu was considered the son of god!

Even the ten great ghost kings would dare to slight him!

“We have to wait for a little while more. We’ll choose a random ghost king ship later.” Yue Hong explained.

Ordinarily, there would be four Ghost King Ships when the Yin Ghost River was filled! One of them would be the Supreme Ghost King Ship!

Now that the Nether Yang King and other supreme beings were coming, the Nether Yang King would take one himself! Wu Zun would take another. Bing Yu and Jiu Yu would take the third, and the last one would belong to Yue Hong and the rest.

Anyone who dared to try to fight to board one of the four ships would be asking for death!

Yue Qing swept his gaze through the crowd and he saw Huang Xiaolong’s figure staring at the other side of the river. He turned to his father and complained, “Father, there’s one more thing I need to report.”

Yue Qing spoke about the event that transpired.

The three ghost kings stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Since he had his back to them, they couldn’t see his face.

“What is that kid’s background? Have you found it yet?” Yue Hong asked.

“No. However, the kid behind him is an eminent elder of a tiny Jiang Family in the Nanfeng City. The old ancestor of their family is a Dao Venerable!” Yue Qing explained.

“The ship is here!” Ao Fangwu cried all of a sudden.

Everyone turned to look at the river and they saw a massive ship floating towards them. It was large enough to contain millions of people, and the body of the ship looked much sturdier than the other ships!

It emitted a majestic air.

Yue Hong muttered, “Since the ship is here, let’s deal with the kid another time. The most important thing is to reach the other side!”

Yue Qing understood the seriousness of the matter and he nodded his head. Of course, he didn’t forget to shoot a glare towards Huang Xiaolong’s back. “He can thank his lucky stars!”

The three of them flew through the air and landed on the Ghost King Ship that arrived. Those who wanted to board could only return to the riverbank dejectedly.

With the three ghost kings working together, even ordinary half-step Universe Gods would have to back down.

Yue Qing and the young masters flew over to the same ship.

The Ghost King Ship was extremely fast, and it overtook the rest of the ships instantly. On the ship, Yue Qing didn’t forget to glare at Huang Xiaolong one more time.

Jiang Dacheng who was hiding behind Huang Xiaolong cowered in fear when he noticed Yue Qing’s gaze. He muttered softly behind Huang Xiaolong, “Lord, that… That’s the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! The Green Winged Ghost King and Evil Dragon Ghost King are beside him! I didn’t think that they would appear together!”

Huang Xiaolong snorted nonchalantly. “They look alright. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

Jiang Dacheng nearly cried from fright. “Lord, they might not look scary, but the experts who died in their hands number in the billions! Especially the Heavenly Blood Ghost King! No one knows how many supreme bloodlines he devoured!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded casually.

“Lord, why don’t… Why don’t we board a ship?” Jiang Dacheng asked cautiously. He saw that there were many ships already filled to the brim. Experts were starting to fight over the spots on the ships and miserable cries could be heard echoing through the air. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

There were several experts who would fall into the river from time to time and become a yin spirit!

Jiang Dacheng’s face turned pale when he saw the fate of those who fell into the water.

“We’ll wait for a little while more.” Huang Xiaolong said.

“Lord, are you waiting for the next Ghost King Ship?”

“No. we’re waiting for the Supreme Ghost King Ship.”

The Supreme Ghost King Ship would usually appear at the end, and Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t bother boarding any other ships.

“Supreme… Supreme Ghost King Ship?!” Jiang Dacheng exclaimed in shock. “Lord, the Heavenly Blood Ghost King and the other said that there were several other supreme beings coming other than the Nether Yang King!”

“I know.”

A commotion broke through in the crowd again.

“Lord… Lord Nether Yang King is here!”
