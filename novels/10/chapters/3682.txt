Chapter 3683 – Who Won?

The golden-robed young man jumped in fright.

He didn’t expert Huang Xiaolong to possess the third ranked universe treasure, the Three Gods Halberd!

The Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Reversal Sword might not be able to destroy the formation, but the addition of the Three Gods Halberd was more than enough to overpower it!

He was planning to reactivate the formation once again when countless branches gathered together before shooting outwards. The light barrier created by the formation was shattered in an instant.

The young man couldn’t reform the barrier in time.

Huang Xiaolong turned into a streak of light and charged out of the formation. The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd in his hand didn’t remain idle as they turned into streaks of light that tore through the void towards the young man.

Waving his hands desperately, two giant golden hoops appeared to smash into the two weapons.

The Reversal Sword and Three Gods Halberd returned to Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and the hoops returned to the young man. It might look like a draw, but there were visible marks on the young man’s golden hoops.

Huang Xiaolong’s form in the Star Dragon Divine Tree continued his assault on the golden robed man.

He retreated once again and a giant golden cloth appeared in his hand without warning. Tossing it out, it expanded to cover the entire sky above them! A rain of golden light emerged and fell on the lands.

That was right! It was raining golden light!

Countless rays beamed down on Huang Xiaolong.

Staring at the incoming attack, Huang Xiaolong turned serious. He could see that the golden light contained extraordinary power and it was countess times stronger than the power of gold!

It contained a shocking corrosive power and it was of an extremely poisonous nature.

It was at a level Huang Xiaolong hadn’t seen before!

Hastily using the power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, star dragon qi filled the skies. Giant branches appeared to shield the main body, blocking off the golden rain.

Black smoke rose from the surface of the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

The sturdy universe treasure became riddled with holes!

One could only imagine how terrifying the golden rain was.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After so many years of battle, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t met anyone who could scratch the Star Dragon Divine Tree, much less cause holes in them.

The golden rain wasn’t slowing down as they continued to pelt down on Huang Xioalong.

Tiny black holes continued to form on the tree.

Of course, the tiny holes would quickly close up with Huang Xiaolong’s constant injection of grand cosmos energy. It was impossible for the young man to injure Huang Xiaolong with his golden rain.

Not stopping there, Huang Xiaolong’s body flickered and the weapons in his hand shot towards the golden robed young man.

Destructive energy swept through the Netherworld.

The trillions upon trillions of evil devils that resided in the area failed to escape from the world-ending shockwave coming from the battle between the two supreme experts and they were vaporized completely.

As the battle raged on, the seventeenth level of the Netherworld was affected. The battle soon spread to the sixteenth and seventeenth level…

Yin Qi and Yin Guan who were waiting outside the first level felt the trembling coming from the Netherworld as they were discussing how they should deal with the matter of the evil ghosts.

They stared at each other in shock.

“What’s going on?!”

“It seems to be coming from the eighteenth level!”

“There’s a battle going on! I wonder who are the ones fighting… How can the battle spread up all eighteen levels?!”

Yin Qi and Yin Guan gasped in fright, along with the experts of the various families.

“City Lord, do you think Lord Huang…” Yin Guan spoke all of a sudden. Huang Xiaolong’s figure flashed through his mind the moment he felt the trembling.

Yin Qi raised an eyebrow in fright. However, he quickly shook his head. “I don’t think so. He might be stronger than me, but he isn’t that much stronger!”

The two energies that came from the eighteenth level of the Netherworld was far too terrifying!

In Yin Qi’s mind, there was no way Huang Xiaolong could possess such power!

While they were guessing the identities of the fighters, the ground shook once.

A frightening amount of power burst out from under the ground as it covered the city. Even with seventeen levels of the Netherworld between them, Yin Qi and the others felt suffocated.

The experts standing around felt their legs going soft.

The shocking thing was that the energy coming from the ground was growing stronger as time passed!

Finally, they were unable to bear the shockwaves coming from the ground and everyone started to escape from the city. When they finally left, the suffocating feeling receded.

“It’s too terrifying! The battle has to be between experts who crossed the 20 billion mark!”

“Who in the world are they?! Did Lord Zhu Chen start a battle with someone? DIdn’t Lord Zhu Chen enter the eighteenth level two million yeras ago? He hasn’t returned since then…”

“Who is the other guy?! Is Lord Green Ghost down there too? Or could it be the God of Death or the Dragon Overlord?”

Everyone started to guess.

Whatever the case, the shockwaves of the battle expanded once again and they were forced to retreat even further.

Finally, they retreated hundreds of millions of miles away from the city.

Half a day later…

The energy that came from the ground disappeared.

Everyone turned to look at each other with confusion in their eyes.

“Did it stop?!”

“I wonder who won…”

Another half a day passed without any changes in the situation and the experts eventually returned to the city.

…

On the eighteenth level, Huang Xiaolong held a piece of golden cloth in his hands. It was sliced off by his Reversal Sword.

Initially, Huang Xiaolong managed to fight the man to a draw with the three universe treasures. However, as time went by, the limitless recovery power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree allowed Huang Xiaolong to gain the upper hand. In the end, the golden-robed young man decided to escape.

When he was running away, Huang Xiaolong managed to make a clean strike with the Reversal Sword.

Of course, he didn’t choose to chase the man. With his current strength, he wouldn’t be able to restrain the young man even with the Universe Boat. There was no need to reveal the strongest universe treasure when it would be of no help to himself.

The Universe Boat was Huang Xiaolong’s trump card. He would use it in the future when he was sure of taking the golden-robed young man down!

Looking at the golden cloth in his hand, Huang Xiaolong eventually kept it away. When he meet Zhu Chen, the Green Ghost, or some other supreme overlords, he might be able to gain some information on it.

A weird burst of energy filled the eighteenth level of the Netherworld all of a sudden, and Huang Xiaolong turned to look in its direction.

It seemed to come from the Naihe Bridge…
