Chapter 2932: Get Lost!

When Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin heard what he said, they stopped dead in their tracks. Liu Xinxin sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, what do you mean by that?! Are you planning to move against us?!”

Lin Zhuoyi sneered coldly. He didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong had the guts to do anything to them as he was the young patriarch of the Dragon Fish Creed. If Huang Xiaolong attacked him, he would turn into an enemy of the Dragon Fish Creed!

However, Huang Xiaolong was indifferent, “You can’t say that I didn’t give you a chance. Make your move. I’ll give you one try to kill me with everything you got.”

Earlier, Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin had ridiculed him endlessly. He wouldn’t be called Huang Xiaolong if he allowed them to leave as they liked.

Their faces turned extremely ugly.

Zeng Lei and Hu Xiaoqian frowned. Huang Xiaolong dares to challenge the two of them by himself?!

Du Limei mocked, “Humph, you don’t know what’s good for you!”

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Du Limei. “Don’t worry, it will be your turn soon.”

At the same moment when Du Limei’s face sank, Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin yelled in unison. Their auras soared rapidly as cosmos energy poured out from their bodies frantically. Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle as he made his move.

A dao soul appeared above Lin Zhuoyi’s head along with nine high-level saint fates. A sky blue light shot out from his body, revealing his Cangqiong Dao Physique. It was ranked eighteenth among the dao physiques.

Even though Lin Zhuoyi was only a late-First Esteem Dao Venerable, the aura he gave off was even stronger than many Third Esteem Dao Venerables.

Even a mid-Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable like Hu Xiaoqian was secretly surprised.

Meanwhile, on Liu Xinxin’s body, nine high-order Saint Fates appeared. An icy black light emerged from her body, and the aura she gave off was no weaker than Lin Zhuoyi.

Kill!

The two of them attacked at the same time, and their combined strength was more than enough to rival a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable.

When they moved, the world felt as though it was going to split apart!

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re a mere Primal Ancestor, I refuse to believe that you’re strong enough to stop us!” Liu Xinxin exclaimed.

When the two of them attacked, even the various experts standing around were shocked.

“That’s cosmos energy! What’s going on?! Looks like someone is fighting in the Mystical Pavilion’s branch… Who’s crazy enough to do that?”

“That sounds like Liu Xinxin from the Dragon Fish Creed! Huang Xiaolong? Is she fighting him now?”

The experts outside were alarmed, but Huang Xiaolong stared at Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin indifferently. When the two of them lunged at him, he casually raised a single finger. Their expressions changed immediately.

That was especially true for Liu Xinxin, whose heart turned cold. It was as though she had seen the scariest thing in her life!

When their faces changed, Du Limei snapped back to reality, and she gasped, “Sh*t!”

Without thinking anymore about it, she attacked Huang Xiaolong.

The Dragon Fish Creed and the Red Fox Creed were allies. As a deputy hall master of the Red Fox Creed, she couldn’t sit around to see the two of them throw their lives away.

As a Late-Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, the grand dao laws started to churn when she unleashed her attack. The power contained in her strike was enough to turn a continent into dust!

When Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin saw Du Limei springing in to assist them, they were overjoyed. However, they celebrated a little too early as a palm emerged from the void to slap Du Limei away.

Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin were like shooting stars as they soared thruogh the air. They smashed into the pillars surrounding them before flying out into the plaza.

…

Right before they emerged, there was an uproar outside the pavilion.

“If Liu Xinxin and Huang Xiaolong were to fight, who do you think will win?” one of the experts asked, and his question sparked a discussion.

“Liu Xinxin is a First Esteem Dao Venerable! A mere Primal Ancestor like Huang Xiaolong is no match for her! Haha, everything that happened in the past should be fake! Huang Xiaolong can’t possibly win!” someone in the crowd laughed.

Just as they spoke, two figures crashed into the plaza before them.

When the spectators saw the two figures, they were dumbfounded.

Meanwhile, inside the main hall, Zeng Lei and Hu Xiaoqian stared dumbfoundedly as they looked at Du Limei, who was sent flying by the tiger-like beast standing beside Huang Xiaolong!

The paw belonged to the beast standing quietly beside him!

“Mid-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable!” Zeng Lei shouted in surprise.

Hu Xiaoqian’s expression sank instantly.

When Huang Xiaolong had left the Golden Sun Forest, he had casually subdued six Dao Venerable Realm vicious beasts. One of them was the tiger beast standing beside him. There was even one of them at the Late-Sixth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm! Based on Huang Xiaolong’s understanding of the area, he felt that the tiger beast would be more than enough to deal with any trouble that would arise.

While the two of them were still in shock, the disciples from the Dragon Fish Creed ran out to save the two.

Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin eventually regained their senses.

Even though the two were still alive, Huang Xiaolong had already shattered their meridians and their extinguishable dao hearts. Even if a peak Late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable were to treat them, they would never recover to their peak state! With their talent, they were more than capable of reaching the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm. But now…

Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin’s faces were extremely unsightly.

“Huang Xiaolong, my Dragon Fish Creed will definitely end you!” Liu Xinxin shrieked, “When my master arrives, she will definitely kill you!”

Killing intent flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

“Young Master Huang, this is my Mystical Pavilion. Please spare their lives…” Zeng Lei requested as he sensed Huang Xiaolong’s killing intent.

Even though he was the branch pavilion master and wasn’t scared of the Dragon Fish Creed, he would be in trouble if the two of them were killed under his watch.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Zeng Lei, causing goosebumps to appear all over his body.

“Get lost. If I see anyone from the Dragon Fish Creed in next ten seconds, all of you will leave your lives here today!” Huang Xiaolong growled.

When they saw the look in his eyes, no one dared to test his patience. They ran away as quickly as they could.

As for Hu Xiaoqian, she couldn’t act like nothing was wrong. Bidding Zeng Lei farewell, she stared at Huang Xiaolong hatefully.

The tiger-like beast beside Huang Xiaolong roared, causing Du Limei’s face to turn white.

After they were gone, Huang Xiaolong spoke about the pill refinement process with Zeng Lei. Not too long after, Zeng Lei brought Huang Xiaolong to a secret space with nothing but a gigantic furnace in it.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
