Chapter 3602 – Who Killed My Son?!

Lin Yi, who was seated beside him, looked at the silver streaks that emerged from his body and noticed his life force draining.

Sons of Creation from the other celestial empires were equally shocked at the sudden change in situation. No one expected Ying Wuyou to die just like that!

A moment later, someone stuttered, “Prince… Prince Wuyou is dead… What’s going on?!”

By the time he spoke, Ying Wuyou’s body had crumbled into specks of dust.

“Prince Wuyou is dead! Someone killed Prince Ying Wuyou!” Someone screamed and their voice rocked the entire pavilion. It was as though the world was crashing down on them.

Indeed, Ying Wuyou’s death was a disaster that could affect most people in the Limitless Land. Unfortunately, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t one of them.

As the Son of Creation of the Ying Ze Celestial Empire, he was also the most treasured grandson of the man himself! Many God of Creation Realm experts estimated that he would enter the God of Creation Realm before long, and he might even be able to do it in the upcoming million years!

However, he was killed in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire! No, he was killed in a restaurant in the Yin Yang Celestial Empire!

The news was sure to rock the Limitless Land.

If the Yin Yang Celestial Empire didn’t handle this well, a war between the two great empires might begin!

When Ying Wuyou was killed, Celestial Emperor Ying Wan was chatting happily with Celestial Emperor Lin Feng in the Yin Yang Palace.

They were speaking about the marriage between their children, and Lin Xian chuckled, “Wuyou is a dragon amongst men! It’s Lin Yi’s honor to be betrothed to him!”

After all, the marriage would benefit both parties. Lin Xian was extremely happy with Ying Wuyou talent.

That wasn’t all. No matter how talented one was, they wouldn’t be able to compare to Ying Wuyou in terms of background! However, Lin Xian looked at it, Ying Wuyou was the best son-in-law he could get!

Ying Wan roared with laughter, “Brother Lin Xian, I know that Lin Yi is the apple of your eye. It’s Wuyou’s honor to gain her favor.”

The two of them chuckled happily.

“Alright. I’ll agree to the marriage! However, let’s wait for the two little brats to return before asking for Lin Yi’s opinion.” Lin Xian smiled.

“Of course.” Ying Wan laughed.

Whatever the case, the marriage was basically set in stone now that Lin Xian had agreed to it.

When Ying Wan thought about it, happiness bloomed in his heart.

All of a sudden, a young expert ran into the hall in a fluster. He started yelling long before he arrived. “Father, something happened! Something big happened!”

The person who came running into the hall was Lin Xian’s second son, Lin Shaowei. He was also Lin Yi’s second brother.

Seeing the weird look on Lin Shaowei’s face, Lin Xian frowned, “What are you so panicky?! Hurry up and greet your Uncle Ying Wan!”

Kneeling before his father, Lin Shaowei stuttered, “Father, something… Something bad happened to Big Brother Wuyou!”

“What?!” Lin Xian and Ying Wan yelled in unison.

“What happened to Wuyou?!” Ying Wan asked as a bad premonition filled his heart.

Gulping in terror, Lin Shaowei started to hesitate.

“What are you waiting for?!” Lin Xian roared.

“Big Brother Wuyou was… He was killed in the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion!” Lin Shaowei knew how serious things were and he forced the words out of his mouth.

Ying Wan felt the entire world spinning around him.

Equally as shocked, Lin Xian stared at his second son in silence.

However, Ying Wan’s eyes turned completely red in the next instant as killing intent filled his heart. “I’ll f*cking exterminate your bloodline for killing my son!”

As soon as he spoke, he soared into the skies and turned into a streak of light that charged straight towards the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion.

He released his aura completely, and the city trembled under the might of a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. In an instant, every single expert in the city, including the Sons of Creation, felt the fury of a supreme expert. The rage of someone at his level wasn’t something everyone could take on.

Lin Xian hastily followed behind Ying Wan.

On the fourth floor of the Bathing Phoenix Pavilion, everyone felt Ying Wan’s aura long before he arrived.

“That’s Celestial Emperor Ying Wan! He definitely learned what happened here and he’s rushing here as we speak! We have to leave now! We can’t get caught up in this!”

“His Majesty is a God of Creation at the grand completion stage with 7.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy! God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage would be crushed if he comes after them!”

Everyone in the pavilion started to make their escape.

However, Ying Wan was too damn fast. He arrived long before everyone could leave, and the ground sank several inches the moment he arrived. The weight of a mountain seemed to crush everything in the vicinity.

Those who failed to escape in time fell to their knees.

“We greet Your Majesty, Celestial Emperor Ying Wan!”

Regardless of who it was, everyone keeled respectfully. Even Lin Yi and the two old experts behind her got to their knees.

“Who was the one who killed my son?!” Ying Wan’s bloodshot eyes scanned the crowd and he roared with rage.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother looking at the man as he continued to enjoy his wine and food. He said casually. “I killed your son. Are you here to take revenge for him?”

Ying Wan locked on to Huang Xiaolong when he heard the voice, and killing intent filled his heart. “I’ll kill everyone related to you and exterminate your bloodline!” A giant palm appeared in the air as terrifying flames surrounded it. It swept towards the pavilion as endless power came crashing down on the lands.

Everyone looked at the giant palm as their legs went soft.

Huang Xiaolong casually waved his cup as streaks of silver starlight formed in the space before him. They shot towards the giant palm and pierced through the powerful attack before landing on Ying Wan’s chest.

The God of Creation who was at the grand completion stage, the mighty Celestial Emperor of the Ying Ze Celestial Empire, was sent flying the moment he was struck.

When Lin Xian saw a figure shooting towards him, he dodged in fright. The shock in his heart peaked when he recognized Ying Wan’s face. Ying Wan was like a meteor that tore through countless structures before finally landing on the ground.
