Chapter 2902: Are you Crazy?

The poison spirits would be existences that could shake the foundations of many creeds. However, all of them were mercilessly sucked into Huang Xiaolong’s body without the slightest resistance!

After absorbing more than a thousand of them, he circulated the power of absolute poison and refined them all.

Not willing to let his guard down, Huang Xiaolong crossed his legs and sat down above the black pool. He circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium in order to turn the poison spirits into streams of pure energy.

When he had strolled around the immortal cave previously, he had devoured and refined the poison qi in the air casually. Things were different now that he was dealing with the poison spirits.

As the poison spirits were slowly refined by him, rays of black light emerged from his body and transformed into a multitude of shapes.

A trace of absolute poison qi emerged from the black pool and entered Huang Xiaolong’s body as he refined the poison spirits.

The trace of poison qi that came from the black pool was extremely pure, and it was several dozen thousand times stronger than whatever he absorbed around the immortal cave.

His body turned completely black the moment the trace of poison qi entered his body. From afar, one would mistake Huang Xiaolong for a human-shaped black diamond sparkling in the sun.

In the blink of an eye, ten whole days passed.

Huang Xiaolong opened his eyes slowly and took a deep breath. All the poison qi contained in the immortal cave swarmed towards him, and nothing could stop him as he absorbed all of them in a single breath.

In a matter of minutes, the poison qi in the immortal cave was sucked dry by Huang Xiaolong.

Slowly after getting to his feet, Huang Xiaolong casually pointed at the air in front of him. A ray of black light emerged to pierce through the structures in the immortal cave without any signs of stopping.

The structures in the immortal cave were created using the sturdiest spirit stones in the Divine Tuo Holy World, and they were reinforced by grand dao runes made by Dao Venerable Realm experts. Even Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables would find it difficult to shatter a single wall, but Huang Xiaolong’s absolute poison power tore through them like they were nothing!

Only after piercing through several hundred wall faces did the strand of energy start to dissipate.

Tearing through the walls wasn't the most frightening part of the absolute poison qi. After piercing through a single wall, the corrosive power it contained shattered the protective grand dao runes like they were nothing.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head in satisfaction.

He didn’t use the cosmos energy contained in him when he tried out the power of absolute poison, and he knew that its power would only multiply when he did.

With the power shown by the strand of absolute poison qi, there wasn’t a need to mention First and Second Esteem Dao Venerables. Even Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm experts wouldn’t be able to hold out for more than a second if he directed it at them!

Glancing at the black pool below him, Huang Xiaolong realized that his ability to control absolute poison would increase several times if he managed to refine all the black liquid!

However, there was something more important he had to take care of right now.

After releasing his dao souls, Huang Xiaolong saw that the restrictions around the treasury were almost completely dark. From what it seemed, they would take less than an hour to completely shatter the entrance. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

With a shake of his body, Huang Xiaolong tore through the skies and shot straight towards the treasury.

He appeared before them in the blink of an eye.

“Who?!” Since he wasn’t hiding his presence this time, the four of them quickly discovered him the moment he approached.

When they turned to stare at him, they were dumbfounded to discover a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor standing behind them. They had no idea how someone at his level had managed to enter the immortal cave.

Weren’t their Qiao Family disciples standing guard at the entrance?

The four of them stared at each other and stopped their assault on the gate.

“Brat, who the hell are you? How did you get in here?” The Third Esteem Dao Venerable’s expression sank as he snapped at Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t let down his guard as he summoned his dao soul to observe the space around him.

He was shocked to discover that there was no one else in the area.

Huang Xiaolong ignored their question and spoke to them with an expressionless face. “My identity doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the fact that I want the treasures in this immortal cave!”

All four Dao Venerables were stunned.

However, one of them soon roared with laughter. “Please say that again… Do you mean to say that you, a puny Primal Ancestor, plans to keep all the treasures here for yourself?”

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the four of them, and he continued, “I’m also missing several Dao Venerable Realm subordinates. If you submit to me, I can give you a few dao pills when we leave.”

The four of them didn’t know if Huang Xiaolong was pulling a prank on them, but they burst into uncontrollable laughter.

If not for the fact that Huang Xiaolong looked normal, they would have seriously wondered if he was dropped as a baby.

A mere Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor not only dared to lay claim to the entire immortal cave. He even wanted all four Dao Venerables to submit to him! Moreover, he would spare them several grand dao pills if they did! What did they look like to him? Beggars?

This…

Taking a break from laughing, one of them wheezed, “Brat, I might not know how you managed to get into this place, but I know that you won’t be leaving today!”

The moment he spoke, he decided to move against Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head before they could make a move, and he sighed, “All of you better come at me together. If you come alone, I’ll cripple you with a single strike.”

The four Dao Venerables were stunned silly by what Huang Xiaolong said.

Staring at him with a weird look on their faces, they wondered if Huang Xiaolong was really insane. Could his brain be filled with sh*t?

“Crippled by a single strike?” The Second Esteem Dao Venerable snorted in amusement when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Brat, I don’t care if you are actually stupid, or pretending to be a fool! You’re dead!” He reached out to send a slap flying towards Huang Xiaolong after he spoke.

As his palm shattered the space around it, it slammed into Huang Xiaolong’s body.

A massive blast rippled through the air, and the four of them felt that Huang Xiaolong’s grand dao physique was done for. However, their jaws dropped to the ground the next moment. The palm seemed to have struck the air! Huang Xiaolong stood his ground, and the clothes he wore weren’t even ruffled!

The Second Esteem Dao Venerable stared at his hands in horror.

“Who are you?” The Third Esteem Dao Venerable turned serious as he stared at the youngster standing before him.

“Huang Xiaolong.”

Huang Xiaolong? Who the f*ck was that? The four of them stared at him as though he was crazy. They weren’t to be blamed as they had already entered the immortal cave before the battle in the Monarch Yu Sacred Land.

“Young Master Huang, we are willing to split the treasures here with you.” The Third Esteem Dao Venerable shocked everyone with his decision.

“This... “ The Second Esteem Dao Venerable wanted to speak, but he was interrupted by the Third Creation Dao Venerable. “I know what I’m doing.”

“Young Master Huang, why don’t we split it up? This immortal cave was left behind by the Mysterious Yin Old Man, and a tenth of it is still a sizable amount!”
