After Huang Xiaolong devoured the ancient Thunder Maggots, he discovered that his strength had actually risen. Who would have thought that these ancient Thunder Maggots were a big supplement for him?

At this rate, it wouldn’t take long for him to advance to the mid-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

Though it was a small cultivation order between early Eighth Order and mid-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, the increase in strength was more than ten percent.

At Huang Xiaolong’s current cultivation realm, every small order advancement brought a drastic rise in strength.

Huang Xiaolong also used the Blue Spectre Eye to check every corner of his body in detail once again. He was inwardly relieved after confirming everything was intact.

Huang Xiaolong remained inside the cultivation room and continued to cultivate as he swallowed Heaven Suppressing Hundred Evil Pills.

Time flowed by.

Soon, more than two months had passed.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the cultivation room when the black dragon flying shark was close to arriving at the Fortune Emperor Palace.

As Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the cultivation room, Fang Gan and others Emperor Palaces’ Ancestors, onboard the black dragon flying ship, were looking at Huang Xiaolong with strange gazes.

In a little over two months since they had left the Fiend God Emperor Palace, they had already connected with their own sects and disciples. From their connections, these Ancestors had learned what Huang Xiaolong had in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. More importantly, they now knew that Huang Xiaolong was the King of Grandmist’s personal disciple and that Huang Xiaolong had obtained the Lord of Hell’s inheritance, making him the new Lord of Hell!

For a brief second, Fang Gan and the other Ancestors were at a loss about how to address Huang Xiaolong...

Your Majesty, the Nether King?

One look at Fang Gan and the others’ expressions, Huang Xiaolong more or less guessed their dilemma. He smiled and said, “Uncle Fang, just call me Xiaolong like you usually do.”

Fang Gan was dazed for a second but nodded his head in the end.

When Huang Xiaolong, Fang Gan, and the rest came out from the black dragon flying ship, everyone at the Fortune Emperor Palace, who had received the news, were already waiting for them outside.

“Father!”

Upon seeing Fang Gan, Fang Xuanxuan and Fang Mingyu rushed towards them, crying out in joy. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhao Lei, Li Shan, Chen Yirong, Peng Xiao, and the others also hurried forward right behind the siblings.

Reunited once again, Fang Gan, Fang Xuanxuan, and Fang Mingyu were naturally emotional and had a lot to talk about. Huang Xiaolong tactfully stood some distance away and did not disturb them as he watched them with a smile on his face.

A while later, Fang Xuanxuan stood in front of Huang Xiaolong with a demure but complicated expression and said, “Thank you.”

The news that Huang Xiaolong was the Lord of Hell had reached every corner of the Divine Realm, and Fang Xuanxuan had naturally heard the news.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “It’s not a big problem. There is no need to use formality and say ‘thank you’ between you and me.”

Fang Xuanxuan nodded her head docilely and did not ‘refute’ Huang Xiaolong. This was a rare occurrence.

“Xiaolong,” Zhao Lei walked over with a wonderful expression on his face as he teased, “You, kid, became the Lord of Hell after one trip to Hell. If you make a trip to the Devil World in the future, are you going to end up being the Devil World’s Archdevil Lord?”

Huang Xiaolong blanked temporarily then answered with a bright smile, “It’s a possibility.”

Since Huang Xiaolong needed to send Fang Gan back to the Fortune Emperor Palace, he had changed his original plans. Initially, he had intended to head to the Solitude Emperor Palace and the other four Emperor Palaces directly from the Fiend God Emperor Palace. From there, he had planned to go to the Devil World.

He had naturally planned to find the Devil World’s Six Devil Steles in the Devil World. He already had the Blood Eye Devil Stele, and if he could find the other five devil steles, it could very likely make him the Devil World’s Archdevil Lord.

Zhao Lei laughed, hearing his disciple’s narcissistic answer. “You, kid, really know how to brag. Alright then, when you become the Devil World’s Archdevil Lord, I, your Master, will call you Lord Archdevil.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled happily, “Then, I would have to call you Lord Archdevil’s Master.”

His words brought laughter from all around.

Everyone subsequently proceeded into the Fortune Emperor Palace in a merry atmosphere.

Huang Xiaolong, Fang Gan, and Zhao Lei walked in a row. Others followed them, and at the back of the group were other Emperor Palaces’ Ancestors that Huang Xiaolong had rescued from the Fiend God Emperor Palace.

After they were rescued from the Fiend God Emperor Palace, these Ancestors had already thought of forming a good relationship with Fortune Emperor Palace. Now that they had learned Huang Xiaolong’s layers of identities, it further strengthened their thought of having a good relationship with Fortune Emperor Palace.

Therefore, since Fang Gan had not ‘sent’ them away, these Ancestors decided to ‘cling’ onto the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Zhao Lei and Fang Xuanxuan had prepared a banquet early on while they had awaited Huang Xiaolong and Fang Gan’s return. Everyone took their seats, and soon after the banquet started, a joyous atmosphere diffused throughout the Fortune Emperor Palace.

First of all, they celebrated Huang Xiaolong’s first-place victory in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, coupled with Fang Gan’s safe return.

The Fortune Emperor Palace had yet to hold a celebration banquet for Huang Xiaolong’s victory in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

The banquet went on into the night until the next day before everyone dispersed.

Back in his cultivation palace inside the Fortune Divine Kingdom, Huang Xiaolong stood on the high mountain peak, immersed in deep thoughts.

During the banquet, he had learned that the Heavenly Emperor Di Jun had issued an imperial edict. He had sent troops to eradicate the Brightness Emperor Palace, Solitude Emperor Palace, Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, Thousand Venoms Emperor Palace, and Flying Blossoms Emperor Palace.

Because Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi and others had fled, the Heavenly Court had easily conquered them, and they had swept these several Emperor Palaces’ treasuries clean.

“Di Jun, Di Jing.” Huang Xiaolong muttered with an icy gaze.

Naturally, he wouldn’t forget about this matter.

Huang Xiaolong took out his communication symbol and contacted Bei Xiaomei, requesting her Silver Fox Commerce to find Brightness Emperor Lan Zhi and Fiend God Emperor Feng Chu’s whereabouts. Huang Xiaolong felt like a lump was blocking his chest as he hadn’t killed these two.

Hence, Huang Xiaolong stayed at the Fortune Emperor Palace as he waited for Bei Xiaomei’s response.

A month later, Huang Xiaolong made a trip to the Barbarian Space at the Floating Twilight Land.

Huang Xiaolong had an inkling that the Barbarian Space was not as simple as it looked because of the lightning bead he had found before.

Now, Huang Xiaolong knew that the realm above the Emperor Realm was called the Sovereign Realm.

His Master, the King of Grandmist, and Senior Brother Jiang Hong were both Ruler Realm experts, but what about above the Sovereign Realm? He had a gut feeling that the lightning bead was not something of this universe.

The natives of the Barbarian Space were ecstatic to see their Great King Huang Xiaolong return. Naturally, kneeling in salute and catching up was inevitable for them.

Huang Xiaolong stayed at the Barbarian Space for some time. However, he failed to discover the Barbarian Space’s secrets.

Several months later, Huang Xiaolong could only return to the Fortune Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong received news from Bei Xiaomei just as he returned to the Fortune Emperor Palace.

“Lan Zhi ran to the Radiance World?” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in surprise as he read Bei Xiaomei’s message, “Feng Chu went to the Devil World!”

Initially, Huang Xiaolong had thought that Feng Chu would seek asylum from Hell’s Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe, but Feng Chu had unexpectedly fled to the Devil World.

As Huang Xiaolong read Bei Xiaomei’s message, a big smile gradually spread over his face, “The Devil World’s Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele have appeared?!”

According to Bei Xiaomei’s message, the Silver Fox Commerce had found out that Feng Chu had fled to the Devil World as the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and Glaze Devil Stele were going to appear!

And it was very likely that these two devil steles would appear at the Devil World’s Eternal Devil Lands.

But the news required further verification.

“Eternal Devil Lands!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes sparkled. Without wasting any time, he rushed to the Fortune Emperor Palace’s library to find all the information about the Eternal Devil Lands.

Two days later, Huang Xiaolong gained a sufficient understanding of the Eternal Devil Lands.

The Eternal Devil Lands was the very end of the Devil World. The Eternal Devil Lands and Devil Holy Ground were considered as the axis of the Devil World.
