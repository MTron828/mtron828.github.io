Huang Xiaolong and the others turned around and saw a red-haired handsome young man standing at the front, leading the disciples from Fiend God Emperor Palace. Moreover, there was a Fiend God Emperor Palace insignia embroidered on the robe he was wearing. However, as a whole, he radiated a type of warmth that made people feel that he was extremely trustworthy.

Is he the young master of the Fiend God Emperor Palace, Feng Chan?

Moreover, he was also the disciple with the best talent in the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s history!

Huang Xiaolong shifted his gaze, and his eyes landed on another disciple from the Fiend God Emperor Palace, Wang Yongsen!

The Wang Yongsen, whom he had defeated at the Fortune Emperor Palace’s apprenticeship ceremony, was also present!

As if he had felt Huang Xiaolong’s gaze, Wang Yongsen walked over and looked directly at Huang Xiaolong. Even though he was startled, Wang Yongsen put on a smile that looked genuine and revealed his pearly white teeth as if he had just met a close friend of his.

“Senior Feng Chan, it’s Huang Xiaolong.” Wang Yongsen walked up behind Feng Chan and whispered.

“Oh!”

Feng Chan looked over, and when he saw Bei Xiaomei standing beside Huang Xiaolong, his eyes lit up slightly. He brought the disciples from the Fiend God Emperor Palace and flew towards Huang Xiaolong’s group.

“Young Lady Bei Xiaomei, what a coincidence. I didn’t think that I would meet you here.” Feng Chan greeted her as he arrived in front of their group.

Bei Xiaomei wrinkled her nose slightly and said, “Feng Chan, were you looking for me for something? Otherwise, if there isn’t anything, don’t disturb my uncle and me. Shoo!”

Uncle?

Feng Chan glanced at Huang Xiaolong before turning back to Bei Xiaomei and smiled, “Actually, I’m just wondering if your older sister is going to watch the Battle of the Heavenly Court?”

Bei Xiaoji?

Huang Xiaolong was startled.

It seemed as though Feng Chan was interested in Bei Xiaomei’s older sister, Bei Xiaoji.

Bei Xiaomei replied in irritation, “Why should I tell you whether my sister is going to watch the battle or not? Moreover, even if my sister is going, she’s not going to watch your battles. She explicitly stated that she most definitely wasn’t going to watch you.”

Feng Chan laughed loudly, “Really? I’m quite honored that Bei Xiaoji mentioned me.”

It was as if Feng Chan would never get angry. He always had a smile on his face. Moreover, his smile was very genuine, and others couldn’t sense a shred of pretense from him.

“Young Lady Bei Xiaomei, can you please relay my message to your sister that I have missed her every day for the past few years? Not one day has passed where I wasn’t thinking about her.” After that, Feng Chan then turned around to leave with the rest of the disciples. From the start till the end, he never spared a single glance at Huang Xiaolong.

Even though Huang Xiaolong might be somewhat famous, it still wasn’t enough for Feng Chan to notice him.

Just as they were about to leave, Wang Yongsen stopped beside Huang Xiaolong and smiled, “Huang Xiaolong, even though I want to defeat you personally, I don’t know if I will be lucky enough to meet you on the battlefield. After all, I have heard that many people will hunt you down during the Battle of the Heavenly Court. I hope that you will be able to pass the preliminary round.”

After speaking, he walked away without looking back and followed behind Feng Chan.

Huang Xiaolong had a face of indifference. He could tell with a glance that Wang Yongsen had already broken through to the Heavenly Monarch Realm. Moreover, he was even in the mid-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

However, even though Wang Yongsen was only a mid-First Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, he should be comparable to an expert in the mid-Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

With his strength, he should have no problem getting a pretty decent rank in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. However, to Huang Xiaolong, he was nothing more than an ant.

As for Feng Chan, he probably used some sort of ancient art to conceal his strength. However, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he would manage to take care of Feng Chan without much difficulty.

Bei Xiaomei snorted and said as she looked at the departing figures of the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s disciples, “Look at that sissy! Not only does he look like a toad, but he’s also an extremely hypocritical one.”

Fang Xuanxuan smiled, “Xiaomei, I reckon that you must be the only one who dares call Feng Chan a sissy. He is considered one of the top five handsome guys in the Divine World, and there are countless female disciples from various Emperor Palaces praying for him to take a second glance at them.”

“The Divine World’s top five handsome guys?” Huang Xiaolong squinted his eyes as he asked Fang Xuanxuan.

Peng Xiao smiled, “As you have been in Hell for the past few years, it’s natural that you have no idea what happened. In the past few years, some busybodies went ahead and ranked you, Feng Chan, the Brightness Emperor Palace’s disciple, Lan Tailong, Grandmist Emperor Palace’s disciple, Zi Liurui, and the Heavenly Prince, Di Jing, as the top five most handsome guys in the Divine World.”

Peng Xiao then teased, “Which means that you are currently the target of admiration for many girls out there as one of the top five most handsome guys in the Divine World...” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Huang Xiaolong felt his cheeks slowly heating up when he heard Peng Xiao’s words’ underlying meaning. However, he really didn’t know what happened.

The top five most handsome guys in the Divine World? Which busybody came up with this?!

Bei Xiaomei giggled, “How can that Feng Chan compare to my handsome uncle? That Feng Chan looks like a pretty flower boy while my uncle is manly and handsome!” Speaking to this point, she then revealed a face full of worry, “However, uncle, I think it’s better if you don’t participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. In any case, the rank you obtain in the battle will be pointless anyway. There’s no difference whether you are ranked in the top one thousand or the top hundred, and the rewards given out aren’t anything special as well. If you want anything, my Silver Fox Commerce will buy them for you!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled when he heard the doubt in her voice.

“Xiaomei, don’t worry, your uncle isn’t weak at all. Even though he isn’t a match for that Feng Chan, there shouldn’t be any problem entering the top hundred rankings. Moreover, Wang Yongsen is not his match.” Fang Xuanxuan comforted.

“Top one hundred?!” Bei Xiaomei was taken aback and yelled in surprise, “Really? Uncle, did you breakthrough to the Heavenly Monarch Realm?”

Fang Xuanxuan smiled and said, “Your uncle should be comparable to a mid-level Heavenly Monarch.”

Ever since Huang Xiaolong had returned, both Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao had only seen him send Sun Shihai flying with a finger. They had no idea what his real strength was. In their eyes, Huang Xiaolong had strength comparable to a mid-level Heavenly Monarch.

Despite that, Bei Xiaomei had revealed a face full of surprise. Is his strength comparable to a mid-level Heavenly Monarch?!

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Can you tell me more about this Feng Chan?”

In reality, Huang Xiaolong had no idea who he was up against.

“There’s a rumor going around saying that Feng Chan has a king of supreme godhead like uncle. However, our Silver Fox Commerce is unable to determine if this is true or not. However, what we are sure about is that he has an extremely high-grade Archdevil bloodline.” Bei Xiaomei regained her senses and said with a solemn look, “Moreover, he has broken through to the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm for quite some time now, and even my sister is unclear about his current strength.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up brightly when he heard what she said.

An extremely high-grade Archdevil bloodline?

Huang Xiaolong’s blood started to boil as he thought about how he would finally be able to devour someone’s bloodline. He planned to devour Fang Chan’s bloodline in front of everyone in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.
