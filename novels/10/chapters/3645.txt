Chapter 3646 – Ceremony

Zhu Jian and the others eventually left the auction venue, but before they did, Jian Bifei enthusiastically invited Zhu Jian to the Jian Family’s ceremony.

Laughing happily, Zhu Jian responded, “How can I possibly reject Brother Bifei’s invitation? I will definitely show up!”

After all, he had his own plans. He glanced at Tao Han’er at the side.

Soon after, Zhu Chen and the rest arrived back at their residence.

“Do you think the brat will really show up at the Jian Family?” Zhu Jian asked his fellow clansmen.

“Probably. The ceremony will be held in one month. Since Lord Gui Chi appeared, he should be headed over too.” Zhu Yun explained.

“Oh? Will Lord Gui Chi also show up at the ceremony?” Zhu Jian gasped.

“I’m afraid he will…” Zhu Yun sighed. “Since Lord Jian Wushuang broke through the 20 billion mark barrier, our Unknown Lands will only grow stronger. Lord Green Ghost might not come, but Lord Gui Chi will be here to send his congratulations.”

Zhu Jian nodded slowly. “Alas… Lord Gui Chi didn’t do anything to that brat today!”

“Lord Gui Chi might not do anything today, but we can look for opportunities for the brat to offend Lord Gui Chi during the ceremony. Countless experts will be present then. When that happens, Lord Gui Chi wouldn’t let him off easily! He’ll kill the brat on the spot!” Zhu Yun laughed.

“Great! We’ll do that then!” Zhu Jian continued, “My father will personally come for the ceremony, and he shall raise the topic of marriage on my behalf!”

“Before the brat dies, he’ll learn of the marriage between Tao Han’er and myself! He won’t be able to die a peaceful death!” Zhu Jian roared with laughter.

…

Huang Xiaolong had already returned to Zhu Fei’s residence when Zhu Jian’s thoughts were running wild. A formless figure appeared in the skies above and melded completely with the void. No one could tell that there was someone there!

Obviously, the only one who had the ability to avoid the detection of so many experts had to be Gui Chi! He hid his presence the best he could, but he was still discovered by Huang Xiaolong easily.

He stood in the skies, not knowing that he was already discovered. He looked into the residence, trying to find Huang Xiaolong.

The kid had successfully caught his attention. He could feel that there was some sort of secret hiding in the kid’s body, but he quickly saw the Unparalleled Sword Manual in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

“Isn’t that Jian Wushuang’s Sword Manual?!”

He couldn’t understand how Huang Xiaolong got his hands on it. Could he be Jian Wushuang’s successor?

That wasn’t possible. When thoughts were running through his mind, Huang Xiaolong raised his right hand slightly. No one knew if it was intentional, but he released a strand of sword qi that shot towards Gui Chi. The speed was so fast that Gui Chi couldn’t even dodge.

He released a strand of energy from his finger in a desperate attempt to stop the sword qi.

A loud blast rang in his ears as the two attacks collided. A shocking amount of power ripped through the air and it sent Gui Chi tumbling outwards. When he finally stabilized his footing, he discovered that he had flown countless miles away! He tried to suppress the shock in his heart.

The sword qi was clearly meant for him!

However, how could a casual wave from the other party send him flying?!

How strong did the other party have to be to do something like that?!

There was only one explanation. The kid he was trying to spy on had already broken through the 20 billion mark barrier! Moreover, he wasn’t a rookie like Jian Wushuang who had just broken through! Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to force Gui Chi back so easily!

A look of suspicion could be seen on Gui Chi’s face.

When in the world did such a terrifying expert appear in the Unknown Lands?! Moreover, no one noticed his arrival!

As he stood there, another strand of sword qi appeared. This time, it was several times stronger than before. Before he could react, a hole was torn through his clothes.

Was that intentional?!

Too scared to remain there, Gui Chi disappeared into the distance.

No one in the outside world saw what happened, and the shockwaves were suppressed by a formless aura Huang Xiaolong released. The only ones who noticed what had happened were Cao Dehong, Zhu Fei, and those standing near Huang Xiaolong.

All of them couldn’t tell the outcome of the exchange as they weren’t strong enough to detect Gui Chi’s presence, but from the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong had won! Shock battered their hearts.

They knew that Huang Xiaolong was stronger than the Limitless Master and the King of the Ocean Race, but they only had a blurry understanding of his strength.

Now, they realized that he was much stronger than they thought! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Was it possible that Huang Xiaolong had the ability to suppress Jian Wushuang alone?!

Perhaps, he could fight toe to toe with Zhu Chen! Even if he couldn’t, his strength shouldn’t be too far off…

“Is the date of the ceremony decided?” Huang Xiaolong asked all of a sudden.

Cao Dehong and the others snapped back to reality. “Reporting to the lord, the date has been set. It will take place in a month!”

“Alright. You can leave now. I’m going to continue studying the sword manual. You can call me when the time comes.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Cao Dehong and the rest left respectfully.

In the blink of an eye, twenty two days had passed.

Cao Dehong and the rest came to notify Huang Xiaolong as their journey to the Jian Family would take close to eight days! They had to leave soon if they wished to make it in time.

Keeping the sword manual, Huang Xiaolong left for the Unparalleled City.

Seven days later, they arrived.

“Lord, I heard that Mei Jie and the experts of the Zhu Family arrived in the city the day before.” Cao Dehong reported.

“Oh? Mei Jie?!” Huang Xiaolong was pleasantly surprised.

Cao Dehong nodded and continued, “Mei Jie represents the Zhu Family to congratulate Jian Wushuang. However, he dotes on his son a lot, and he probably came because of Zhu Jian.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled softly. “Haha, do you think the little brat called his father here to deal with me?”

Can Dehong lowered his head slightly. “Probably…”

An imperceptible grin flashed across Huang Xiaolong’s face.

Mei Jie!

He was the only one who escaped when Huang Xiaolong crushed the Creation Palace! Since Mei Jie chose to interfere, Huang Xiaolong decided that he would deal with the last of his problems with the Creation Palace during the ceremony. At the same time, he could settle the Jian Family.

Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree sneakily and hid it in the space around the city. Trillions of branches and roots extended silently around the city, enclosing it within.
