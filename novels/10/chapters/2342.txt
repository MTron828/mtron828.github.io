Chapter 2343: The Sacrificial Altar

Two days soon went by quickly, and the day of the apprenticeship ceremony arrived.

On this day, every corner and the location of the Holy Heavens City was extremely crowded.

That’s right, it was hyped up.

Experts from three hundred thousand holy grounds, numerous top ancient families, and several hundreds top desolate era’s races flocked to the Holy Heavens City.

The apprenticeship ceremony venue was not held at the Holy Heavens Manor but on the Holy Heavens City’s highest peak this time. It was also the biggest mountain within the Holy Heavens City, and it was called the Sacrificial Mountain!

Though the tall Sacrificial Mountain’s peak was spacious, and it had many palaces built on it, these palaces were quickly filled by people.

People were on every inch of the mountain. And the huge bustling crowd even spread to the several closest mountains. Everywhere was a sea of people.

As one of the top four forces in the Holy World, the Clear Snow Palace’s place was arranged on the first row closest to the Sacrificial Mountain peak.

The three ladies, Tan Juan, Ji Xinyi, and Lin Xiaoying stood on the palace terrace on the mountain peak, taking in the surrounding scenery.

Ji Xinyi noticed Lin Xiaoying had been staring at a certain spot of the mountain. She smiled and teased, “What are you looking at? You are so focused. I think Huang Xiaolong probably won’t be here for a while.”

Lin Xiaoying curled her lips and pouted her tender cheeks, “Who said I am looking for him? Who is he to me?”

Tan Juan joined in, “Yu Fujiang was reduced to being half-dead by Du Zhenjun a few days ago, and more than a dozen of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Princes are locked up in the dungeon. I’ve heard that in order to vent this anger, True Saint Shen Jiewen has ordered Liang Qin to go all out during the sparring exchange.”

Lin Xiaoying became nervous hearing that and blurted out, “Doesn’t that mean Huang Xiaolong will be in danger?”

Tan Juan let out a string of delicate laughter and said, “Well, I don’t think he would be in any real danger. No matter how much True Saint Shen Jiewen wants to vent his anger, he won’t order Liang Qin to deal Huang Xiaolong with a heavy hand. He merely wanted Liang Qin to humiliate Huang Xiaolong in front of so many experts, and I also heard....” Her words inexplicably stopped here.

“Heard what?” Lin Xiaoying urged.

“I heard he ordered Liang Qin to beat up Huang Xiaolong until he begs on his knees,” Tan Juan stated honestly.

“What?!” Anger rose in Lin Xiaoying’s alluring face, “How dare he!”

Ji Xinyi and Tan Juan exchanged a knowing smile, and Ji Xinyi directly teased, “I say, Junior Sister Xiaoying, didn’t you say that Huang Xiaolong is nobody to you. Why are you so concerned about him?”

Lin Xiaoying pouted and denied, “Who says I am worried about him? I merely couldn’t stand True Saint Shen Jiewen’s action. He’s obviously being shameless. It has always been an unsaid rule that when the winner and loser have been determined the sparring exchange should stop. But True Saint Shen Jiewen deliberately wants to humiliate Huang Xiaolong. What is this if not shameless?!”

“Although Huang Xiaolong has a complete dao saint godhead that can evolve, it is clear that his complete dao saint godhead is only the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead at this point. How can Huang Xiaolong be a match against that Liang Qin?”

After listening to Lin Xiaoying grumble angrily without the intention to stop, both Ji Xinyi and Tan Juan covered their lips and smiled knowingly.

“Are you still saying that you’re not concerned about Huang Xiaolong? Why are you so agitated then? Why are you so vexed?” Tan Juan teased.

Suddenly, there was a small commotion in the crowd on the mountain slope.

“It’s His Highness Huang Xiaolong!”

“Huang Xiaolong is here!” Among the packed crowd, a voice rang clearly.

The three ladies dazed for a second then looked towards the source of the commotion.

A dashing young man with thick masculine eyebrows was flying towards the mountain peak accompanied by a group of experts.

The young man was none other than Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong was positioned behind the Grand Hall Master Wu Ge, and beside Huang Xiaolong were the various Holy Heavens’ Hall Masters, Li Chen, and other core disciples.

Despite being in a group consisting of the Holy Heavens Grand Hall Masters and core disciples, Huang Xiaolong’s unique aura still made him stand out from the others. It gave others a feeling that he was a dragon among men.

“He is Huang Xiaolong?!”

From afar, Lin Xiaoying asked aloud as she looked at Huang Xiaolong with sparkling eyes, as if everything else in the world had disappeared except him. She could even hear the wind fluttering by Huang Xiaolong’s side, blowing in her direction.

“This Huang Xiaolong is really more dashing than the average man.” Ji Xinyi, who had been paying attention to Lin Xiaoying’s face, said with a giggle. “That Yu Fujiang is much worse compared to Huang Xiaolong.”

Lin Xiaoying’s face widened as she shot Ji Xinyi a fierce glare, “Senior Sister Ji, can you not compare Yu Fujiang with Huang Xiaolong?”

Ji Xinyi quickly found a retort, “Okay, forget Yu Fujiang, even Li Chen cannot be compared to Huang Xiaolong.”

“That’s more like it.” Lin Xiaoying smirked in triumph.

Tan Juan tried to suppress the corners of her mouth from rising

“Ei, those three people, aren’t they the ones we rescued at the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse a few days back?” Ji Xinyi suddenly said as she pointed towards the three people behind Huang Xiaolong. They were Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi.

Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi also come to attend the apprenticeship ceremony.

“It’s really them!” Lin Xiaoying exclaimed in surprise as well.

“It looks like they are the people under Huang Xiaolong.” Tan Juan deduced, then teased Lin Xiaoying, “Junior Sister Xiaoying helped Huang Xiaolong’s subordinates a few days back. It seems you really are fated to be with Huang Xiaolong.”

Ji Xinyi chimed in, “Who knows, Huang Xiaolong might be planning to come over and thank Junior Sister Xiaoying after the apprenticeship ceremony.”

While the three beauties were having fun teasing each other, Huang Xiaolong, Wu Ge, and the others were passing by the front side of the Clear Snow Palace’s accommodation. The three beauties standing on the terrace were an eye-catching sight.

“It’s the Clear Snow’s Three Beauties!” The Holy Heavens’ core disciples’ eyes shone.

Core disciple Lin Yijia nudged Li Chen and whispered sheepishly, “Senior Brother Li Chen, it’s Senior Sister Tan Juan!”

Huang Xiaolong naturally looked over and directly met the three ladies’ gazes. He smiled politely at them and nodded in greeting, as well as gratitude for helping Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi at the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse. He had been busy with preparing for the apprenticeship ceremony. Thus he had yet to thank them in person.

The three ladies were slightly surprised, but they lightly nodded their heads at Huang Xiaolong, then slightly curtsied at the Grand Hall Mater Wu Ge.

In the distance, among the Holy Lands Alliance, Yu Fujiang was watching this scene. He watched everyone gather around Huang Xiaolong as he stood in the center of the crowd of experts’ attention, and Yu Fujiang’s lips curled into a cold sneer.

“I will let you feel smug and proud now, but soon you won’t be able to beg even if you want to.” Yu Fujiang sneered.

At the summit of the Sacrificial Mountain, there was a massive plaza that spanned tens of thousands of li in perimeter. The square was paved with the Holy World’s holy spiritual jade stones, and these jade stones were all grade-five and above!

Rich holy spiritual qi roiled in the clouds above.

And in the center of the plaza was a magnificent sacrificial altar several thousand li wide. Walls of the sacrificial altar’s three floors were inscribed with a grand holy spiritual formation. Between the runes were carvings of majestic holy beasts.

Di Huai, Feng Tianyu, Zhang Wenyue, and Xue Qi stayed on the ground, while Huang Xiaolong, Wu Ge, Li Chen, and the Holy Heavens’ core disciples climbed up the sacrificial altar.

However, the Holy Heavens’ Hall Masters, as well as Lin Yijia, Li Yao, Chen Kaiping, and the rest of core disciples stayed on the first floor. Wu Ge and Li Chen, stopped on the second floor. Huang Xiaolong alone went up to the highest third floor.

A short while later, the Clear Snow Palace and Holy Lands Alliance’s experts began to fill the seats around the plaza. Then, experts from other forces, ancient families, and desolate era’s races took their seats. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Other than experts from the Clear Snow Palace, Holy Lands Alliance, other holy grounds, various ancient families and desolate era’s races, the rest of the forces were only allowed to bring three representatives into the plaza seating.

Even so, the seatings around the sacrificial altar were soon packed. The experts sat in an orderly manner, row after row, that one could barely see the other end.
