Chapter 2485: Eight - Sided Desolate Beast Ring!

“Xiaolong, Xie Yao and the others became extremely active after Li Chen’s return. It was especially so for Fu Yunjie. He invited various patriarchs of the superpowers to a feast in Li Chen’s name,” Feng Tianyu reported.

“Oh.” Huang Xiaolong merely laughed. “It seems like he’s finally able to do something now that his owner is back.”

Di Huai couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “It seems like Li Chen has forgotten about the matter of licking your boots. He even acts so haughtily the moment he returns from hiding.”

Ji Rui shook his head and explained, “Now that he’s acting so flamboyantly, he definitely has something to rely on. I received news that he managed to obtain some sort of great inheritance along with the treasury of some super expert. His strength has soared, and he’s aiming for the first place in the Trial of Blood.”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback for a moment, but joy filled his heart. “He received an inheritance from a super expert?”

Huang Xiaolong simply didn’t care about Li Chen’s increased strength and his goal for the Trial of Blood!

Previously, Li Chen was probably a Second Heaven True Saint. He might be at the peak of the early-Second Heaven True Saint Realm, and even if he managed to obtain an inheritance, he would have advanced to the peak of the mid-Second Heaven True Saint Realm at the very most.

Even if he had reached the peak of the late-Second Heaven True Saint Realm, Huang Xiaolong was confident of taking him down with a flip of his palm.

“That’s right. However, I have no idea whose inheritance he managed to obtain.” Ji Rui continued, “Since the rumors have already started to spread, there should be traces of truth in them. Whatever the case, Li Chen will definitely mess with you during the Trial. Your Highness, please be careful.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

That night, Huang Xiaolong held a massive banquet and invited several experts from the superpowers that were friendly with him.

Of course, those invited were in the True Saint Realm. With his current status, anyone under the True Saint Realm was no longer qualified to attend a banquet hosted by him.

The only exceptions were the leader of the holy princes of their respective factions, or the young masters of several ancient races.

Even though True Saint Realm experts were hardly ever seen in the secular world, more than a thousand of them attended Huang Xiaolong’s banquet!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked when he noticed the number of people who turned up.

Luckily for him, there were tons of people in the Blue Dragon Manor, and they could easily bring out additional tables for the attendees.

Along with a never-before-seen talent with three complete dao saint Godheads, Huang Xiaolong was also the disciple of all four Primal Ancestors of the Holy Heavens. He was the brightest star in the entire Holy World and everyone wanted to form connections with him.

When they heard that he was hosting a banquet, everyone who was eligible turned up.

If the news of Huang Xiaolong’s banquet were to spread through the Holy World, given enough time, more than ten thousand True Saints would turn up!

During the festivities, Huang Xiaolong downed cups of wine with the various True Saint Realm experts. Even though he was only at the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, not a single person dared to remain seated when he raised his cup in toast.

“Your Highness Huang Xiaolong’s talent is unparalleled! It hasn’t even been thirty years since the events in the Mirage Pavilion, but you managed to enter the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!” Chen Biting of the Six Dao Holy Gate stood up and proposed a toast to Huang Xiaolong as he roared with laughter.

Since Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother concealing his cultivation realm, everyone present noticed his speed of advancement.

Even though the Six Dao Holy Gate didn’t stand at the forefront of the Holy World in terms of strength, Chen Biting was still a reputable Fifth Heaven True Saint Realm expert.

As soon as the words left his lips, the various patriarchs stood up and raised their glasses. One after another, they praised Huang Xiaolong. Normally, every single one of them were emotionless robots in the eyes of their disciples. However, the smiles on their faces were exceptionally bright when attending Huang Xiaolong’s banquet.

In all honesty, they weren’t merely kissing up to Huang Xiaolong. His speed of advancement was truly too terrifying.

Huang Xiaolong could only cup his fists to accept the praises they showered on him.

As the banquet hosted by Huang Xiaolong was reaching its climax, Li Chen’s manor that should have been bustling with activity stood all by its lonesomeness. There wasn’t a single soul seen in the main hall.

When Li Chen saw the empty seats when he entered the main hall, his expression sank. Turning to Fu Yunjie and Xie Yao, he questioned them about the lifeless banquet.

“Huang Xiaolong returned today, and he organized a feast! Everyone rushed over to the Blue Dragon Manor the moment they received the invitation!” Fu Yunjie scowled.

Xie Yao continued with a sneer, “Huang Xiaolong has to be doing it on purpose! He knows that we have invited the experts of the various superpowers over, and he chose to hold his banquet today. He’s definitely doing it to make us look bad.”

Lin Yijia couldn’t help but frown. “Huang Xiaolong is getting more and more arrogant… Is he trying to show off his strength to Senior Brother Li Chen?”

Li Chen looked in the direction of the Blue Dragon Manor, and he sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re playing with fire here… You can’t blame me for what’s about to happen in the Trial of Blood…”

“Senior Brother Li Chen, Huang Xiaolong seems to have entered the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm,” Fu Yunjie reported. “I also heard that he’s determined to enter the top 100 ranks during the trial.”

Even though it was true that Huang Xiaolong had entered the Fourth Tribulation Half Saint Realm, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s determination to enter the top 100 ranks was fabricated by Fu Yunjie.

Xie Yao couldn’t help but roar with laughter when he heard what Fu Yunjie said. “It’s laughable for a Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint to say that he wants to pass the trial, much less enter the top 100 ranks. What a joke! Huang Xiaolong is really delusional!”

Lin Yijia couldn’t help but shake his head. “If what he says spreads to the outside world, everyone who enters the trial will despise him.”

Li Chen couldn’t help but laugh. Turning to Fu Yunjie, he ordered, “Since that’s the case, send out our men to spread the news.”

Since he had finally found a reason to smear Huang Xiaolong’s name, Li Chen was more than happy to do it.

“Yes, Senior Brother Li Chen!” Fu Yunjie chuckled.

When Xie Yao and the others left, Li Chen entered a secret room in his palace before sitting down on a jade bed. Mysterious energy swarmed out from his body and a ring slowly emerged.

The golden ring wasn’t technically a ring, as it had eight edges. It resembled the eight trigrams and sinister light flashed on its surface. Eight desolate beasts were carved on it, and every single one had the power to shake the heavens and earth.

As soon as it emerged, holy spiritual light emerged from the void and surrounded Li Chen’s body. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Li Chen chuckled sinisterly when he stared at the Eight-Sided Desolate Beast Ring floating before him. “With this, who’s going to fight with me for the top spot in the Trial of Blood?”
