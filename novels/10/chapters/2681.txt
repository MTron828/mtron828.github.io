Chapter 2682: Meeting Yun Fanger Again

Even while staying in the Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters, Huang Xiaolong still kept tabs on Yuan Qianxing’s movements. Of course, he couldn’t ignore the movements of Elder Ming and the others as well.

When Huang Xiaolong heard that Yuan Qianxing was returning to the Otherworldly Mansion, a sneer formed on his lips. It seemed as though they would be meeting soon…

Very quickly, one night passed.

When dawn broke the next day, Huang Xiaolong slowly opened his eyes to welcome the brilliant rays of sunlight.

Since his holy souls had transformed into dao souls and his physical body had evolved into a dao physique, the grand dao energy that he absorbed allowed his cultivation to soar.

However, he suppressed his cultivation, unwilling to take on the seventh dao tribulation.

It wouldn’t be too late if he took on the seventh tribulation after dealing with Yuan Qianxing.

As for the remaining four pieces of dao fruit, Huang Xiaolong planned to refine them in the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm. He would immediately raise his cultivation to the Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm when that happened.

Even though reaching the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm was pretty much impossible, entering the Eighth Heaven True Saint Realm was doable.

When he left his room, Huang Xiaolong noticed Long Jianfei standing outside. After bowing to Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei said, “Young Lord, it’s not every day that you get a chance to pay a visit to our Dragon Fish City. Would you like me to bring you on a tour of the city?”

“Alright.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Since he planned to return to the Otherworldly Mansion the day after, strolling about the streets of the Dragon Fish City would allow him to release some pent-up stress.

After hearing that Huang Xiaolong didn’t reject his act of hospitality, Long Jianfei rejoiced in his heart.

Along the way, they ran into Long Haiqin. After considering the fact that Long Jianfei hadn’t been around the city for a very long time, he volunteered to be their guide. After all, he was much more familiar with the city than either of them.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand slightly and declined his goodwill.

After all, Long Haiqin was the patriarch of the Dragon Fish Race. The number of people who could recognize him on the streets probably numbered in the millions. If he followed them about, they wouldn’t be able to walk around as they wished.

As for Long Jianfei, only a handful of Primal Ancestors and patriarchs in the World River would be able to recognize him. The odds of them being recognized on the street were slim to none.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong didn’t want him to be their guide, Long Haiqin didn’t insist.

After leaving the headquarters, they visited several places only the locals would know about. Even though the places they visited weren’t crowded, they were extremely interesting.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong asked about the matters of the Sky Opening Island.

“Sky Opening Island?” Long Jianfei pondered for a moment. “Young Lord, are you sure that there’s a high-level Primal Ancestor in the depths of the Sky Opening Island?”

Initially, Huang Xiaolong felt that someone at Long Jianfei’s level would definitely know of the existence of the high-level Primal Ancestor in the World River. However, from his reactions, it didn’t seem so.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head and spoke about his experience when he was leaving the Sky Opening Island.

A trace of suspicion flashed in Long Jianfei’s mind. “Could it be the Sky Opening Island’s spirit?”

“Sky Opening Island’s spirit?!” Huang Xiaolong was taken aback by his comment.

“Yes. According to the legends, the Sky Opening Island managed to gain sentience after its birth during the formation of the world. It apparently gained an Innate Xuanhuang Physique. With its physique alone, not many Primal Ancestors would be able to defeat it.

Huang Xiaolong sank into his thoughts. Wouldn’t that mean that only a handful of Primal Ancestors here possess the strength to defeat it?

It seemed as though he had to subdue the Sky Opening Island’s spirit after grabbing the Innate Xuanhuang Stone. As for the time, he could enter the Sky Opening Island again, he decided to only head over after entering the Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm.

“Young Master Long!” When Huang Xiaolong was thinking about the Sky Opening Island, a surprised yelp rang through the air. As they looked at the source of the voice, they saw a pretty little lady staring at Huang Xiaolong with a surprised look on her face. She quickly hopped over.

Who else could it be but the second miss of the Rising Clouds Commerce, Yun Fanger?

There were several experts from the chamber of commerce around her, and the crimson-haired young man, Chen Junhong, was also present.

Chen Junhong’s expression changed the moment he noticed Huang Xiaolong.

The scene of Huang Xiaolong decimating the members of the Thunder Serpent Race remained fresh in his mind.

As he stared at Yun Fanger, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “Nice to meet you again, Young Lady Fanger.”

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t expected to meet her in the Dragon Fish City after their last meeting several dozen years ago.

“Young Master Long, I didn’t expect you to know about the Starry Peak! Not many people in the Dragon Fish City know about this place!” Yun Fanger giggled.

Since the other members of the Rising Clouds Commerce had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was, they were extremely surprised when they noticed their young lady’s behavior. As they looked at Huang Xiaolong once again, their stares became a little more intense.

The only person who looked at Huang Xiaolong differently was Chen Junhong. He had a face full of fear when he looked at the monster in human skin before him.

While looking at the stars twinkling above the Starry Peak, Huang Xiaolong spoke to Yun Fanger, “I found this place after my friend brought me here. Otherwise, I would have never experienced such an amazing view…”

Yun Fanger looked at Long Jianfei and didn’t think too much about his presence. Instead, she chuckled softly, “I know of somewhere with good food in the city. Why don’t we head over together?”

“Sure,” Huang Xiaolong agreed with a smile on his face.

After all, he had come out of the Dragon Fish Race’s headquarters to enjoy himself.

“Young lady, we should leave the Dragon Fish City soon!” One of the experts couldn’t hold himself back, and he tried to persuade Yun Fanger. “If the experts of the Thunder Serpent Race come, we’ll be in serious trouble! We won’t even be able to leave the city when they arrive!”

“Thunder Serpent Race?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback when he heard the name.

After a slight moment of hesitation, Yun Fanger explained, “The Thunder Serpent Race wasn’t willing to give up. We came to the Dragon Fish City secretly in order to purchase some items. The members of the Thunder Serpent Race managed to find out, and they should be leading the experts of their race over as we speak…”

Before anyone else could speak, Long Jianfei interrupted, “This is the Dragon Fish City. Are the members of the Thunder Serpent Race daring enough to make a move on you here?”

One of the experts of the Rising Clouds Commerce chuckled, “You’re too naive. Super clans like the Thunder Serpent Race can do anything they wish in the city. The disciples of the Dragon Fish Race’s enforcement hall can be easily bribed by the members of the Thunder Serpent Race. They won’t bother with us even if we beg for help!”

Long Jianfei’s expression sank when he heard how a mere Sixth Heaven True Saint had called Huang Xiaolong and him naive. However, he felt that it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to lash out before Huang Xiaolong made a move.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Roaring laughter rang through the skies all of a sudden as the members of the Thunder Serpent Race arrived. The expression on the faces of those from the Rising Clouds Commerce changed and it was evident that they hadn’t expected the members of the Thunder Serpent Race to appear so quickly.

“It’s the patriarch of the Thunder Serpent Race, Lei Yin!” someone screamed.

Lei Yin was a pretty famous figure in the World River, and he was a Ninth Heaven True Saint. He was also the brother of Lei Long, whom Huang Xiaolong had killed previously.
