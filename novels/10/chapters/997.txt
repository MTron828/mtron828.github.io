“He went to the Volcano Isle?” Chen Jinzhi’s mouth curved into a ridiculing sneer, then he got to his feet and flew out from his cultivation dwelling toward Winged Tiger City.

Upon arriving at the Winged Tiger City, he headed straight to the flying ship dock and paid three thousand shenbi for the next departing ship to the Volcano Isle. In between, he contacted an inner disciple that was on the same flying ship as Huang Xiaolong, telling him to pay attention to Huang Xiaolong’s whereabouts.

Else, how was he supposed to find Huang Xiaolong on the big Volcano Isle?

Inside the flying ship, Huang Xiaolong who was sitting in a corner suddenly sensed that someone was observing him. Without any changes to his expression, he extended his divine sense, shortly discovering that the person watching him was an inner disciple, a late-Second Order Heavenly God.

After finding the inner disciple, Huang Xiaolong directed his gaze outside, watching the white clouds floating away in the sky.

This flying ship was akin to an airplane in his past life, but then again, it was many times faster than a plane. Even so, they flew for ten days straight before arriving at the Volcano Isle.

As the flying ship descended onto the ground, Huang Xiaolong alighted and headed straight to the isle’s green mountainous region.

Leaping from branch to branch on the giant trees, Huang Xiaolong’s godforce condensed into a sharp blade over his palm. With every swing of his arm, he ended a demonic beast’s life. It was clean and swift, all it required was a single slash.

As he was still on the periphery of the island, the demonic beasts he killed weren’t very strong, only between late and peak late-Tenth Order Highgod Realm.

But it was enough to astound the inner disciple tailing Huang Xiaolong ever since he got off the flying ship. This level of strength already rivaled an average early First Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator, right?

‘This kid is really one of the new outer disciples?’

Suddenly, Huang Xiaolong who had been leaping through the branches suddenly stopped and turned back, looking at a certain direction, “How long are you planning on following me?”

That Barbarian God Sect inner disciple froze in surprise, ‘This kid actually discovered me?’ While he was debating internally, mostly because he didn’t believe this new outer disciple really found him, Huang Xiaolong’s palm blade cleaved through the air. A terrifying blade qi roiled over, heading straight toward his hiding place.

That inner disciple was shocked. At this point, he couldn’t be bothered about exposing himself as he struck out a palm to counter the incoming blade qi.

In an instant, wind surged forward like a great tsunami, the force from his palm multiplied a thousand times over.

A second later, a heavy grunt sounded as that Barbarian God Sect inner disciple tumbled in the air like a broken kite. When he finally regained his footing, he stared at Huang Xiaolong with disbelief. They were equally matched!

‘How is this possible?!’

Such monstrous talent, even their new chief disciple Chen Hao would be hard pressed to contend with it!

Furthermore, Chen Hao was someone hailed as their Barbarian God Sect’s greatest genius of the last ten millennia!

Such a freakish talent had acutally appeared amongst their Barbarian God Sect’s outer disciples!

“Who is it that wanted you to tail me?” Huang Xiaolong ignored the other side’s shock, asking in his aloof voice.

That Barbarian God Sect disciple squeezed a stiff smile at Huang Xiaolong, explaining, “Junior brother has misunderstood, I have no other purpose in following Junior brother. It’s just a coincidence.”

“Coincidence?” Huang Xiaolong scoffed and had no interest to waste time here. His three supreme godheads rotated simultaneously.

He arrived right in front of that inner disciple in a flicker, striking out an Earthen Buddha Palm.

Looking at the sky above him being filled with ethereal images of golden Buddhas, the inner disciple’s face turned grim. Suddenly, pops and crackling noises came from his body as his palms turned crimson like burning flames, striking toward Huang Xiaolong.

A dark crimson flaming palm imprint flew up, colliding with the golden Buddha palm.

Although Huang Xiaolong hadn’t been in the Barbarian God Sect for long, the booklet he received did introduce most of the sect’s techniques and battle skills, thus he recognized the flaming palm the inner disciple struck out as a battle skill called Crimson Flame Heart-fire Palm!

The human internal organs were made up of five viscera and six bowels, while the heart represented the fire element.

In other words, the flames from this Crimson Flame Heart-fire Palm originated from the heart instead of the usual divine fire formed from one’s godforce.

This heart-fire flowed out from the body through a unique vein, much more overbearing than the common divine fire condensed from godforce.

When their palms collided in midair, another thunderous boom shook the forest.

Huang Xiaolong continued to attack after the collision without missing a beat. The battle between them escalated quickly, exchanging more than twenty strikes in a mere few breaths.

As the battle went on, that inner disciple became increasingly shocked and alarmed. He had gone all out in desperation, even exposing a fist technique he had cultivated in secret for many years, never using it in front of anyone before, yet he was still unable to gain the slightest advantage over Huang Xiaolong, forget wanting to suppress him.

Not to mention that Huang Xiaolong’s movements and attacks grew increasingly fierce and swift as time passed. From the initial equally matched power, Huang Xiaolong was gaining the upper hand.

If this trend persisted, he was going to be defeated for sure!

He, a Barbarian God Sect inner disciple, a late-Second Order Heavenly God Realm master, was on the verge of losing to an outer disciple who had just entered the sect!

Another dozen of moves later, the inner disciple leaped back, a low grunt escaping his throat.

Right at this time, he saw one thousand arms appearing from Huang Xiaolong’s back.

Huang Xiaolong’s thousand palms each condensed a godforce blade, swinging them toward the inner disciple.

The Asura Sword Skill’s Ninth Move: Wind Blade Volutions!

Frigid Asura qi wind sharp as blades, one wave higher than the other, locked down their immediate surroundings.

In the blink of an eye, the inner disciple was covered by waves of wind blades. Muffled wails were heard in between howling winds.

A vague shadow could be seen in the whirls of frigid Asura wind. At any time, no matter how the whirl turned, the inner disciple would suffer simultaneous slashes.

When the wind subsided, the inner disciple was laying there stiffly. His face was unrecognizable, and his Barbarian God Sect inner disciple robe had disappeared; he was naked, with blood flowing out from the countless cuts and slashes on his skin.

“Wh-who are you?” The inner disciple asked, his voice weak voice strained and hoarse. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Huang Xiaolong did not answer. A force from his palm pulled the inner disciple to his front, beginning the soul scouring.

Half an hour later, Huang Xiaolong had found what he wanted from the disciple’s memories. He then pierced a hole through his skull and dug out his godhead, collected his spatial ring, and lastly, flicked a ball of divine fire to burn his corpse before disappearing from the scene in a flash.

“Chen Jinzhi.” Huang Xiaolong muttered under his breath, a glint in his eyes.

From the inner disciple’s memories, he found out it was another inner disciple named Chen Jinzhi who wanted to deal with him, and this Chen Jinzhi was the Lin Family Fort Lord’s cousin!

Lin Chaoqun!

Huang Xiaolong sneered, no wonder he caught a glimpse of Lin Chaoqun when he was in the Pingyi City, his son also took part in the disciple recruitment test.

Lin Sheng, Lin Chaoqun’s son. Lin Sheng’s talent and strength weren’t bad, being one of the hundred disciples who passed the assessment with him, ranked thirty-something.

Though knowing that Chen Jinzhi wanted to kill him and was on his way to the Volcano Isle, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t anxious at all. One of his reason in coming here to train was his impending breakthrough to the Heavenly God Realm. At that time, a late-Third Order Heavenly God Realm like Chen Jinzhi would pose no threat.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong left, the flying ship Chen Jinzhi was on descended on the Volcano Isle. Despite the repeated messages he sent to that inner disciple, there was no reply.

Chen Jinzhi was inwardly baffled, feeling a little uncertain, ‘What is going on?’

Lin Chaoqun wasn’t exactly forthcoming about Huang Xiaolong’s strength with Chen Jinzhi, he merely said that Huang Xiaolong was a bit stronger, which was why Chen Jinzhi had never given it a second thought. Right now, he assumed that inner disciple had come across other matters and was unable to respond.

Most of all, in Chen Jinzhi’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong only had the talent to condense a top rank eight godhead, hardly posing any risk to him. Lin Chaoqun’s father, his uncle, had once saved his life, so Chen Jinzhi agreed to help Lin Chaoqun with this matter as a way to repay the kindness Lin Chaoqun father’s showed him.
