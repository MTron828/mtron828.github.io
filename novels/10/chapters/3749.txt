Chapter 3750: Surpass Yuan Fang

The crowd thought that if there was only one Human Emperor present, Huang Xiaolong would have probably dared to get ahead of him, but there were eight Human Emperors gathered, and the magnitude was completely different.

If the human race’s eight Human Emperors join hands, even an expert like the Lord of Ghost Desert would ashen.

A twenty-billion-mark expert snickered harshly when he saw Huang Xiaolong suddenly stop. “Looks like even Huang Xiaolong has to cower in front of the eight Human Emperors.”

Other experts snickered as if that would vent the anger in their hearts.

Right at this time, Huang Xiaolong lifted his foot and continued onward, rendering the crowd dumbfounded.

Buddha Sage Human Emperor’s eldest disciple rebuked Huang Xiaolong coldly, “Huang Xiaolong, if you dare to take another step forward, my master and other Majesties Human Emperors will absolutely kill you!”

Huang Xiaolong took a nonchalant glance at the Buddha Sage Human Emperor’s disciple. Just one glance from him knocked the disciple into the air for no apparent reason.

The crowd of experts in the Golden Gorge was stupefied.

The Buddha Sage Human Emperor had not expected Huang Xiaolong to suddenly attack. After the initial split second of shock, his face sank, and he stared fixedly at Huang Xiaolong as he said to the other seven Human Emperors, “Brothers, the Devil Mirror Palace is about to appear. The eight of us should join hands and swiftly deal with Huang Xiaolong. What do you think?”

The third-ranked Horned Sage Human Emperor nodded in agreement. “Brother Buddha Sage’s intention is exactly my meaning.”

Seeing that the Horned Sage Human Emperor agreed, the remaining six Human Emperors also nodded.

Immediately, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor, Horned Sage Human Emperor, and the rest of the eight Human Emperors’ momentum soared as they released their full force.

Boom!

Influenced by the eight Human Emperors’ momentums, the sky darkened, and the wind howled making sand swirl into a sandstorm.

Sensing the overwhelming momentums coming from the eight Human Emperors, everyone present paled and retreated as if they could not back away fast enough. Even the Lord of Ghost Desert looked solemn.

“Kill!”

When the eight Human Emperors circulated their energy to the limit, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor opened his mouth and thundered, and his voice shook heaven and earth.

Whilst everyone was shocked, the eight Human Emperors attacked at the same time.

All eight Human Emperors used their most powerful guardian treasures to attack Huang Xiaolong.

The Buddha Sage Human Emperor’s guardian treasure was an alms bowl!

Whereas the Horned Sage Human Emperor’s guardian treasure was a long curved horn that didn’t look like metal or non-metal material. The surface of the curved horn was densely covered with runes.

Some of the other six Human Emperors used blades, swords, and even a giant axe.

There were also strong and weak guardian treasures, and the eight Human Emperors’ guardian treasures were naturally top-tier powerful guardian treasures.

With eight powerful guardian treasures infused with eight Human Emperors’ power, the dazzling rays blinded everyone and lit up the entire desert gorge, and even the outside area.

The weaker God of Creation Realm experts felt pain in their eyes the moment they laid eyes on the light.

The eight Human Emperors’ guardian treasures arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong at lightning speed.

There was no ripple of panic on Huang Xiaolong’s face as a small golden boat appeared in his hand. The small golden boat took on the eight guardian treasures’ attacks as it expanded into a million zhang in length.

Rumble!

The giant golden boat collided with the eight Human Emperors’ guardian treasures one by one.

Consecutive blasts shook the sky.

To Old Granny Void and the others’ horror, the eight Human Emperors’s guardian treasures were knocked away.

When the Buddha Sage Human Emperor saw the golden boat, he was shocked to his soul, “Universe treasure!”

In the next second, the golden boat slammed into the eight Human Emperors, and the overwhelming destructive energy caused their faces to turn deathly pale. No one dared to hide their trump cards anymore and tried to parry the Universe Boat the best they could.

Boom!

Almost at the same time, the Universe Boat slammed into the eight Human Emperors.

Another wave of blasts thundered across the sky, shaking the land.

Some families’ old ancestors’ eardrums bursts due to the collision impact, and many more suffered concussions.

All of the eight Human Emperors possessed battle strength above the twenty billion mark, especially the Buddha Sage Human Emperor who had crossed the twenty-nine billion mark. One could imagine how terrifying the combined strengths of these eight Human Emperors were.

Even the Lord of Ghost Desert looked extremely solemn.

The Universe Boat was finally stopped right in front of the eight Human Emperors’ faces with their joined effort.

But the Lord of Ghost Desert, Old Granny Void, and the others’ eyes widened as they stared at Huang Xiaolong. Although the Universe Boat was stopped in its tracks by the eight Human Emperors, Huang Xiaolong had been standing in the same spot from the beginning, without moving an inch!

With one arm, Huang Xiaolong steadied the Universe Boat’s other side!

In other words, Huang Xiaolong merely used one hand to withstand the eight Human Emperors’ combined attacks without moving an inch.

Even Yuan Fang who had been watching everything with a blase expression couldn’t hide the shock in his eyes.

The eight Human Emperors’ eyes protruded in shock, staring at Huang Xiaolong on the other side of the Universe Boat.

Before the crowd recovered, Huang Xiaolong’s palm emitted brilliant rays as he circulated the Universe Transformation Art, and robust cosmos energy of 29.9 billion mark roared out.

The Universe Boat shone glaringly as a startling energy burst out from it, hitting the eight Human Emperors. The eight Human Emperors were alarmed and moved to dodge but their action was still a beat too slow, b-b-oom!

The Universe Boat quivered and shook off the eight Human Emperors, and Huang Xiaolong went on to push the Universe Boat forward.

The eight Human Emperors got the air knocked out of them.

“Pu!”

Eight figures crashed into the gorge like meteors, with blood spurting out from their mouths.

The eight Human Emperors soon disappeared into the gorge, and they were obscured from view by the golden fog.

“What?!” The Lord of Ghost Desert as well as the present family’s old ancestors and patriarchs shrieked.

Yuan Fang was genuinely shocked for the first time in his life.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent as he retrieved the Universe Boat, and continued onward towards the Lord of Ghost Desert.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong approach, apprehension flitted across the Lord of Ghost Desert’s pupils. His face darkened as he pondered if he should give way to Huang Xiaolong, but his decision was made swiftly as he stepped to the side.

When Huang Xiaolong passed by the Lord of Ghost Desert, he didn’t even give the Lord of Ghost Desert a direct gaze.

The Lord of Ghost Desert’s nerve twitched at being treated as invisible.

When Yuan Fang saw Huang Xiaolong come at him, he was stunned for a second. It seemed like Huang Xiaolong didn’t only want to stand in front of the Lord of Ghost Desert, but he wanted to bypass him as well.

Sharp golden light burst in Yuan Fang’s eyes.

All other experts held their breaths, watching Huang Xiaolong and Yuan Fang.

Their hearts twisted in nervous tension and faint anticipation.

There was no expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face as he got closer to Yuan Fang with each step he took, and soon, there was merely ten meters distance between them. Then it was nine meters, eight meters…

Four meters!

Three meters!

When he was one meter away from Yuan Fang, Yuan Fang suddenly took a step to the left, rendering everyone dumbfounded. Huang Xiaolong walked past the spot Yuan Fang was standing earlier, and stood in the first spot in the Golden Gorge’s center area.

Huang Xiaolong stood one hundred meters in front of Yuan Fang with his hands clasped behind his back.

Yuan Fang stared sullenly at Huang Xiaolong’s back.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
