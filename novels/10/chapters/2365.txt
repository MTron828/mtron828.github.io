Chapter 2366: Not Allowed to Leave Secretly

“It’s me.” Huang Xiaolong reiterated, smiling slightly.

“...You, how did you arrive here?!!” Lin Xiaoying blurted in astonishment. The mainland they were on was almost ten thousand zhang underwater in the Profound Water. Based on Huang Xiaolong’s strength, how could he arrive here?!

Many Eighth Tribulation, Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints lost their lives in the jaws of profound beasts just to get here, and one could even encounter True Saint Realm profound beasts. In Lin Xiaoying’s opinion, to get here based on Huang Xiaolong’s strength, he should have died countless times.

Huang Xiaolong smiled naturally and explained, “I have some treasures for self-protection, so I was able to reach here safely. I’m here to look for holy herbs, I sensed your aura when I was passing by the area, so I came to take a look.”

“Self-protection treasures?” Lin Xiaoying’s suspicious eye scruntinized Huang Xiaolong.

Upon seeing her suspicious gaze, Huang Xiaolong felt a little helpless and took out a protective ancient talisman, or it would be hard to convince Lin Xiaoying.

“That’s a holy grade Inextinguishable Talisman!” Lin Xiaoying was greatly shocked, and it showed on her face. With her eyesight, she recognized the protective ancient talisman in Huang Xiaolong’s hand at a glance. It was no secret that this kind of talisman could not be bought with money, even in big auction houses.

Huang Xiaolong smiled, “My luck is quite good, I once discovered a cultivation cave left behind by a True Saint, and this holy grade Inextinguishable Talisman is left behind by that expert.”

Lin Xiaoying’s suspicions did not reduce as she asked, “How did you detect my presence?”

“It is related to a secret art I practiced. I also have a saint artifact. By borrowing the saint artifact’s power, I can detect most of the things within a hundred million miles radius from me.” Huang Xiaolong explained and added, “Of course, it only works on cultivators below True Saint Realm.” Huang Xiaolong took out the Barbarian Space’s lightning bead and waved it in front of Lin Xiaoying.

Lin Xiaoying’s eyes widened, seeing the lightning bead, and she sounded a little disgruntled, “You, this saint artifact of yours, you won’t happen to have found it in the same True Saint expert’s cultivation cave...?”

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “I did.”

“Then you are really lucky!” said Lin Xiaoying.

“I’ll take that as a compliment, as my luck has always been good.” Huang Xiaolong smiled, and didn’t blame Lin Xiaoying for suspecting him at all. She had just been pursued by Long Zhengyu, Li Luo, and the others not long ago, and it was only understandable that her nerves were highly strung. Not to mention that he had suddenly showed up in front of her. It was simply too much of a coincidence.

“You’re injured.” Huang Xiaolong stated matter-of-factly as he took out a pill, “This is a Vitality Rejuvenating Pill, swallow it and your injuries will heal quickly.”

“Vitality Rejuvenating Pill!” She was once again astonished after seeing the round, shiny pill in Huang Xiaolong’s palm, exuding a rich holy spiritual qi.

Though the Vitality Rejuvenating Pill was not a holy grade pill, it was still a valuable level-ten origin spiritual pill, and more importantly, it was the best kind of healing pill available after the holy grade pill.

Refining the Vitality Rejuvenating Pill was not easy, and it required a special refining method. Thus only a handful of people were capable of refining it. This was also the reason Lin Xiaoying herself did not have it.

Lin Xiaoying had not expected Huang Xiaolong to have the Vitality Rejuvenating Pill.

This mere Sixth Order Venerable kid, whom she had helped twice at the Profound City, actually carried so many good things on him?

“You wouldn’t have gotten this Vitality Rejuvenating Pill by luck again, right? At some True Saint’s cultivation cave?” Lin Xiaoying asked.

Huang Xiaolong laughed in response, “You guessed right, didn’t I tell you just now? My luck has always been very good, so I came to the Profound River to try my luck, and see if I can stumble upon a holy herb or two.”

Lin Xiaoying felt more than a little speechless. “So, because you think your luck is quite good, you dare to risk your life and come here to look for holy herbs? Then, have you gotten any holy herb yet?”

“Not yet.” Huang Xiaolong smirked nonchalantly.

He had not found any holy herb, but he had found the golden lake that had aided his soul’s transformation to holy soul successfully. Additionally, he had found four sources of grandmist holy spiritual qi, which had enabled his Grandmist Parasitic Medium to advance to the eleventh stage!

Not to mention that he had collected many high-grade origin treasures along the way.

Huang Xiaolong gave the pill to Lin Xiaoying, but Lin Xiaoying pushed it away with both hands.

“You’ve helped me twice, so take this Vitality Rejuvenating Pill as my thanks for your help. Your injuries will heal faster after you swallow this pill, or it will be very dangerous for you to remain here in your condition.”

Huang Xiaolong added, “Don’t worry, there is no problem with this Vitality Rejuvenating Pill.”

Upon hearing that, Lin Xiaoying hesitated, but accepted the pill from Huang Xiaolong’s hand in the end. But she did not consume the pill immediately. She first checked the pill with her divine sense to ensure the pill had not been tampered.

“I’m leaving first.” Huang Xiaolong said. Since he had already sent the pill to Lin Xiaoying, he didn’t need to linger around.

“Wait!” After seeing that Huang Xiaolong had turned to leave, Lin Xiaoying stopped him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong stopped.

After some thought, Lin Xiaoying said, “This Profound River is extremely dangerous, many high-level half-True Saint profound beasts appear where we are at, and it is especially dangerous for a Sixth Order Venerable like you. I think it’s better you stick with me, we can take care of each other if something happens.”

Because Huang Xiaolong had converged his aura, and his holy souls concealing for him, Lin Xiaoying did not discover that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to Seventh Order Venerable.

Huang Xiaolong showed a troubled look at Lin Xiaoying’s request, “That!”

For other disciples, it was a dream come true to be able to accompany Lin Xiaoying, but to Huang Xiaolong, traveling with Lin Xiaoying was, honestly, inconvenient.

After looking at Huang Xiaolong’s troubled face and remembering that Huang Xiaolong had earlier refused to travel with her in front of the Profound City’s gates, she became annoyed, “That what that?! I’ll decide on this matter, and it’s decided!”

With that, she turned and returned to the cave without giving Huang Xiaolong a chance to refuse.

Huang Xiaolong was flabbergasted.

For the first time, Huang Xiaolong discovered that other than being kind, Lin Xiaoying also possessed the ‘domineering’ quality that many women had....

In the meantime, back in the cave, Lin Xiaoying restored the restrictions at the cave’s entrance, and then swallowed the Vitality Rejuvenating Pill to heal her injuries. But before that, she shot a fierce glare at Huang Xiaolong and warned sternly, “You’re not allowed to leave secretly!”

Huang Xiaolong opened his mouth, wanting to refuse, but ended up saying nothing at all. He looked at the billowing frigid wind outside, and grumbled inwardly, this little missy is so cruel to leave me waiting outside.

It would take Lin Xiaoying roughly ten days to absorb the Vitality Rejuvenating Pill, so Huang Xiaolong could only lay out an array to build a small safe area for himself. He sat cross-legged on the ground, and swallowed a level-ten origin spiritual pill before he started cultivating according to the Grandmist Parasitic Medium.

Under the circulating Grandmist Parasitic Medium, the surrounding spiritual energy howled. Small golden grandmist holy dragons hovered around Huang Xiaolong.

Once streams of spiritual energy came within close proximity to Huang Xiaolong’s body, this energy was immediately assimilated and absorbed by Huang Xiaolong in an instant.

After entering the eleventh stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium, adding his three holy souls’ traction towards the Holy World’s origin energy, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation speed was many times faster than before. The speed from before and after were totally two different concepts.

As Huang Xiaolong cultivated, he probed at the laws and energies that existed within the Holy World’s space.

Unknowingly, ten days already came and went. When Huang Xiaolong retreated from his cultivating state and opened his eyes, he saw Lin Xiaoying standing at the cave’s entrance while looking at him with a strange expression.
