“Master, is this it?” Huang Xiaolong inquired. A soft green light glowed in the palm of his hand, lighting the entire main hall green. Feng Yang experienced a sudden increase in spiritual energy, rushing at him like a tsunami.

The green glow even pierced through the four walls of the hall, enshrouding the entire hall where Feng Yang usually cultivated.

“This, this!” Feng Yang was flabbergasted as he stared wide-eyed at the spirit stone in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. Excitement, joy, shock, and bewilderment toppled over to the point where his hands were shaking and he became tongue-tied, unable to get a full sentence out.

Huang Xiaolong passed the green spirit stone to his Master Feng Yang. This green spirit stone was a small portion of the large jade column that was used to breed the innate spiritual embryo.

After he had refined the innate spiritual embryo and broke through to God Realm, Huang Xiaolong used the Blades of Asura to cut the jade column into a dozen pieces of similar sizes, conforming to the regular size of spiritual stones seen on the market.

“You, wh-where did you find this?!” A weak tremble could be detected from Feng Yang’s voice as he asked Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Yang’s dramatic reaction slightly baffled Huang Xiaolong. It seems like this sacred grade immortal spirit stone was very precious?

At his Master’s question, Huang Xiaolong did not conceal the truth, recounting how he found the innate spiritual embryo.

When Feng Yang heard Huang Xiaolong saying that he stumbled upon an innate spiritual embryo while rushing through the galaxy, he was literally dumbfounded for a full minute before shaking his head with a wry smile. The luck of this youngest disciple of his seemed a little overboard.

This innate spiritual embryo was hard to come by once in a million years. How many Ancestor level old monsters and prominent families’ Patriarchs had dreamt of it yet were unable to get their hands on it, but his youngest disciple actually stumbled upon it while rushing through the galaxy!

Feng Yang’s gaze turned somewhat strange scrutinizing Huang Xiaolong. Now he finally understood how his youngest disciple was able to break through to Second Order God Realm from half-step God Realm in three short years.

Feng Yang gradually calmed down, embarrassed by his own reaction earlier. “This, Xiaolong, this is a sacred grade immortal spirit stone. Master would like to... request two from you...?” by this point, Feng Yang’s old face was already red. He has great use for this sacred grade immortal spirit stone.

Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong took out ten pieces and gave them to Feng Yang without a word. To Huang Xiaolong, Feng Yang had given him much gracious guidance. Solely based on the fact Feng Yang helped resolve his parents’ Xiantian realm cultivation problem, he wouldn’t have hesitated even if Feng Yang wanted all of the remaining sacred grade immortal spirit stones.

After a brief bout of insisting and refusing, in the end, Feng Yang put away the ten sacred grade immortal spirit stones. His gaze slightly softened looking at his youngest disciple.

In exchange, Feng Yang gave Huang Xiaolong a spatial ring after taking the ten sacred grade immortal spirit stones, containing all the treasures he had collected for the past several thousands of years, insisting that he wouldn’t take his disciple’s things without giving something in return.

Thus Huang Xiaolong did not hesitate to accept it.

Subsequently, Feng Yang and Huang Xiaolong hatched a plan of taking out one piece of sacred grade immortal spirit stone to be auctioned in the Black Warrior Auction House one year later. When that Crazy Lady would hear news of the auction, she would definitely rush over to the Black Warrior City.

Although they were unable to resolve Shi Xiaofei’s physique problem right now, the possibility of it being solved in a year’s time made Huang Xiaolong feel more lighthearted. According to his cultivation speed, it probably wouldn’t take him too long to break through to Highgod Realm, and once he did so, he could ascend to the Divine World. Hence, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be staying long in the lower realm. Huang Xiaolong hoped that Shi Xiaofei’s Pure Luminance Enlightened Buddha Physique could awaken earlier, helping her break through to Highgod Realm earlier so that the both of them could ascend to the Divine World together.

In the month after, Huang Xiaolong mainly spent his days in the Misty Rain Mountain Range’s Yard No.1, condensing spirit stones.

Previously, Huang Xiaolong was able to condense more than twenty thousand spirit stones in a day, but now that his cultivation had improved, his speed became faster as well. By the end of the month, Huang Xiaolong had added over seven million pieces of top grade one spirit stones to his collection.

When Huang Xiaolong left Yard No.1, arriving in the Black Warrior City through the transmission array, he headed straight to the city’s Azure Sea Firm branch. When he stepped into the Azure Sea Firm branch, Supervisor Meng Xia, who gave Huang Xiaolong the supreme guest card, welcomed him warmly akin to a good old friend that he had not met for many years.

Meng Xia’s eyes shone brightly when he found out that Huang Xiaolong had once again come to exchange high grade one spirit stones. The last batch of high grade one spirit stones that he exchanged with Huang Xiaolong was judged to be of excellent quality by their firm’s appraiser, close to being top grade spirit stones. That transaction earned him a reward personally given by the Firm’s Elder. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“May I ask how many high grade spirit stones brother wants to change this time?” Meng Xia inquired with a bright smile.

“Over seven million pieces.” Huang Xiaolong replied nonchalantly.

This figure gave Meng Xia such a big fright that he fell off the chair he was sitting on.

“O-over seven million pieces?!” Meng Xia was more than astonished as he stared dumbly at Huang Xiaolong.

Over seven million pieces.... How much was that worth?!

10 billion!

Meng Xia sucked in a breath of cold air, keenly aware that the heart in his chest was beating rapidly out of rhythm. Despite being one of the largest firms in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, ever since its founding year several tens of thousands of years ago up until now, there had only been very few transactions that exceeded ten billion!

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Receiving a confirmation from Huang Xiaolong, Meng Xia jumped to his feet, his voice urgent: “Brother, please wait here for a moment, coincidentally our President is in the Black Warrior City these few days, I’ll immediately go invite our President over!”

Transactions of double digits in the billions far exceeded his scope of authority.

A short while later, Meng Xia returned, following behind an elegant looking middle-aged man. This elegant looking middle-aged man was the Azure Sea Firm’s President, He Zexin.

When He Zexin arrived, his footsteps paused slightly out of surprise seeing Huang Xiaolong. Then he laughed good-naturedly, saying, “I was wondering who could it be on the way over here, so it is the Black Warrior Institute Principal’s cherished disciple, Brother Huang Xiaolong ah!”

A few years back, He Zexin attended the Black Warrior Institute Principal Feng Yang’ apprenticeship ceremony for his youngest disciple, hence He Zexin was able to recognize Huang Xiaolong at a glance.

‘Black Warrior Institute Principal’s cherished disciple Huang Xiaolong?!’ Meng Xia, who was following behind He Zexin, felt like a thunder clapped in his brain. His eyeballs widened to the size of a fist staring at Huang Xiaolong. Only now did Meng Xia know Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

The following procedures went smoothly knowing who Huang Xiaolong was. A short while later his Asura Ring was packed with a little over 11 billion Xuanwu coins.

When business was concluded, Huang Xiaolong and Azure Sea Firm President He Zexin exchanged a few polite sentences before Huang Xiaolong left, sent off by Meng Xia and He Zexin personally.

“I didn’t expect this Huang Xiaolong to be so cherished by Institute Principal Feng Yang to this extent, actually giving him so many spirit stones!” Meng Xia looked at Huang Xiaolong disappearing back as he said this.

“With Huang Xiaolong’s monstrous talent, gaining the Institute Principal’s love is normal.” He Zexin added, “Instead, I’m feeling jealous of Feng Yang for receiving such an excellent personal disciple ah!”

Obviously, both of them assumed that Huang Xiaolong’s many high grade one spirit stones were given by the Black Warrior Institute Principal to his cherished disciple.

From the Black Warrior City’s Azure Sea Firm branch, Huang Xiaolong went to Changzhi City’s Azure Sea Firm branch. Meeting with Supervisor Fang, Huang Xiaolong was informed that there were three owners who were agreed to sell, the prices they requested were 200 million higher than their purchase price. Three properties, a total of 6.8 billion.

Huang Xiaolong waved his hands without saying a word, 6.8 billion Xuanwu coins flowed out like a milky way river from the void. It was like the undulating stirrings of first love in Fang Qunzheng’s heart. The bright glittering sparkles nearly blinded his eyes.
