Chapter 3638 – Forgetting Past Relations

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “Let them in. Let’s see how fierce they can be…”

Yu Xiaohong and the others laughed in response. That was true. Even if Jian Wushuang personally came, he wouldn’t be able to leave the hall unscathed!

Turning to the general who entered the hall, Yu Xiaohong ordered, “You heard the Lord! Bring Jian Xiyuan in!”

“Yes, Lord Ancestor!” The general replied before turning around to call for the members of the Jian Family.

“Head over to the main hall. I won’t be meeting him.” Huang Xiaolong lagged. He turned to the sword manual and he said, “This looks pretty interesting. I’ll continue to look into it.”

Bowing respectfully, Yu Xiaohong headed for the main hall. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong decided to send Zheng Shen and the others over to the main hall with Yu Xiaohong. After all, Jian Xiyuan brought several dozen experts with him. She might be able to suppress them alone, but Huang Xiaolong felt that they had to keep up with appearances. Since the other party brought more men, they would also show off their manpower!

After they left, Huang Xiaolong continued to flip through the sword manual. Unknowingly, he reached the eighth page.

If Jian Wushuang was present, he would probably smash his head into the wall after noticing Huang Xiaolong’s speed. Every single page contained profound sword dao that he comprehended after a long time! Even half step Universe Gods with terrifying talent would take several years to comprehend a single page!

Huang Xiaolong was a monster!

As he continued to read through the manual, the general who made the report spoke to Jian Xiyuan and the others.

“Lord Ancestor has summoned you.”

Jian Xiyuan’s expression sank and he sneered, “Who does she think she is? I came all the way here only for her to send a lowly general like yourself oer. Didn’t you tell her that I wanted her to personally come out to welcome me?”

“I am merely here to convey the ancestor’s orders.” The general said calmly.

“Preposterous!” Another eminent elder of the Jian Family, Jian Chengfeng, raged and sent the general flying with a single slap. When he landed on the ground, his head had swelled to the size of a pig’s.

“Do you really think that I won’t cripple you right here and now?” Jian Chengfeng roared.

However, he was stopped by Jian Xiyuan. “Enough. He’s a general of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire. You can’t kill him here. Just slap him a couple of times and send him away.”

Slapping the general until all the teeth were beaten out of his mouth, Jian Chengfeng finally sent him away.

The general was a God of Creation at the grand completion stage. He was no match for Jian Chengfeng who was at the peak of the grand completion stage!

When Jian Chengfeng finally stopped, he snapped at the general, “Bring us in right now or I’ll behead you!”

The general didn’t utter a word of resentment and he merely muttered, “You guys will regret this.”

“Humph. Do you really think that Yu Xiaohong will do anything to us because of you? Even if we cripple you here, she wouldn’t dare to touch a single hair on our heads!”

“Why aren’t you leading us in?!”

Jian Xiyuan kicked the general, causing him to fly into the hall. He was in an extremely sorry state after all the abuse by the members of the Jian Family.

When they saw his pitiful figure crawling to his feet, the members of the Jian Family roared with laughter.

Swallowing his grievances, the general led them into the main hall.

Jian Xiyuan sneered as he walked behind the man. “Look at all of you. You’re all losers! Your celestial emperor was nothing but a lowly slave, and your ancestor’s a b*tch! Hahaha! You’re so much worse than them! You don’t even dare to look at us after we beat you up! Hahaha!”

Soon after, they arrived in the main hall.

“Please wait a moment while I report to the ancestor.” The general said.

“Bullsh*t! What do you have to report? F*ck off!” Jian Xiyuan kicked the general aside before strolling into the main hall.

Yu Xiaohong noticed everything that went on outside and her expression sank instantly. “Jian Xiyuan, you’re going too far!”

She released her aura completely.

Even though Jian Xiyuan could feel the pressure coming off her, he snorted in response, “Yu Xiaohong, Yu Dawei was one of us after he surrendered to the Jian Family. How dare you cripple him? Whatever the case, hand over our sword manual and sword pills. You will also have to compensate us with twenty top-grade universe-level spiritual veins!”

“Nonsense! What if I refuse?” Yu Xiaohong sneered.

“If you refuse, you can’t blame our patriarch for forgetting his past relationship with you!”

“Humph. I’ll tell you right now. I won’t hand over a single item over to you!” Yu Xiaohong snorted in contempt.

Jian Xiyuan and the members of the Jian Family stared at her in shock.

They didn’t expect her to be so adamant about it.

“Yu Ming, how many times did they slap you?” Yu Xiaohong turned to ask the general.

“Jian Chengfeng slapped me a total of eight times.” Turning to point at Jian Xiyuan, he continued, “Including the kick outside the hall, Jian Xiyuan kicked me twice.”

Jian Chengfeng laughed in amusement when he heard what the general said. “Yu Xiaohong, are you really thinking of taking revenge for your subordinates? Don’t forget, our ancestor is the sixth supreme overlord of the Unknown Space!”

Yu Xiaohong ignored his threats and muttered, “Since you slapped him eight times, I’ll slap you eighteen times!” As soon as she spoke, she appeared before Jian Chengfeng.

He couldn’t react in time as eight slaps landed on his face immediately.

By the time she was done, he was sent flying out of the hall.

“It’s your turn!” Yu Xiaohong looked at Jian Xiyuan.

“Yu Xiaohong, how dare you! Lay down the sword formation immediately!” As soon as he spoke, sword intent filled the hall. The experts of the Jian Family spring into action.

However, they couldn’t even do a thing as more than thirty experts on Yu Xiaohong’s side appeared to suppress the members of the Jian Family.

Zheng Shen and the others weren’t there for show…

When Jian Xiyuan was still stuck in a state of shock, he was sent flying with a single kick from Yu Xiaohong.

“Yu Xiaohong, you sl*t!” He barely crawled to his feet before he was sent flying by another kick from Yu Xiaohong.
