After controlling Shi Yinyu with the grandmist worm, Huang Xiaolong began reading Shi Yinyu’s memories.

A while later, Huang Xiaolong obtained the method of opening the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury from Shi Yinyu’s memories and the grandmist aura’s information.

“There are so many treasures inside the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury! It truly deserves its reputation as the number one clan of Spirits World!” After reading Shi Yinyu’s memories, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help sighing in envy.

Within the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury, in addition to the grandmist aura, there numerous rare treasures that were hard to find. Most of these treasures were looted when the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had attacked the Divine World.

At that time, the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe had literally ransacked half of the Divine World! How many hundred thousands of world surfaces would have comprised half of the Divine World? How many Emperor Palaces and first-ranked forces were annihilated? The treasures inside these Emperor Palaces and first-rank forces’ treasuries were all looted clean by the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

One could imagine how wealthy the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury was!

Although the Netherworld King’s Organization’s Chamber of Commerce was the largest trading entity in Hell, in terms of wealth, it was poor compared to the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.

Huang Xiaolong did not linger around. He ordered the puppet Netherguards to clean up the scene quickly. After everything was done, he circulated the Asura Tactics to summon the Gate of Hell, then crossed over with Shi Yinyu in tow.

In the next second, Huang Xiaolong and Shi Yinyu appeared above the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong had not killed Shi Yinyu because he wanted Shi Yinyu to take out the grandmist aura from the treasury personally. After all, Shi Yinyu’s identity was helpful.

Once they were out of the Nine Yin Space, Huang Xiaolong flew straight towards the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s treasury with Shi Yinyu.

An hour later, the two stopped in the vicinity of the treasury.

“Go on.” Huang Xiaolong ordered Shi Yinyu.

“Yes, Master.” Shi Yinyu complied respectfully before speeding away.

Huang Xiaolong concealed himself within the void, waiting for Shi Yinyu’s good news.

Just as Shi Yinyu arrived in front of the treasury and opened its door, four figures appeared in a flicker. These four were the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestor guardians of the treasury.

All four Ancestors were peak late-Tenth Order Emperors!

This was the Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s deep foundation.

Concealed within the void, Huang Xiaolong watched everything with his Eye of Hell and was slightly astonished seeing the four peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Ancestor guardians.

“Young Lord, didn’t you enter the Nine Yin Space with the Old Ancestor and Patriarch?” One of the Ancestors asked. All four Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Ancestors were surprised, seeing Shi Yinyu in front of the treasury.

“The Old Ancestor and the others are forging the grandmist artifact and require a large amount of star sand and grandmist aura. They cannot extract these items at the moment, so they sent me to get the things from the treasury.” Shi Yinyu answered.

The four exchanged doubtful glances.

“That...” The four hesitated.

“May I ask if Young Lord carries the Old Ancestor or Patriarch’s sound token?” One of them asked. “Since the Old Ancestor requires a large amount of star sand and grandmist aura to forge the grandmist artifact, why didn’t the Old Ancestor take it with him earlier?”

Although the person in front of them was the genuine Shi Yinyu, something didn’t sound right. This was the reason why the four of them were doubtful.

“Insolent! I, as the tribe’s Young Lord, want to enter the treasury to get something, and you require the Old Ancestor and Patriarch’s sound token from me?!” Shi Yinyu glared at the four Ancestor guardians angrily and scolded, “As for why the Old Ancestor did not take the things himself, how would I know that? Are you suspecting that I am going inside to steal the star sand and grandmist aura from right under your eyes?”

“We dare not.” The four promptly denied.

“Quickly get out of my way.” Shi Yinyu snapped.

The four guardians exchanged another silent look.

“Get out of my way! If anything happens, I will take responsibility!” Shi Yinyu stepped forward domineeringly and waved the four Ancestor guardians away, barking with impatience, “If the grandmist artifact’s forging progress is delayed, can you all afford the Old Ancestor’s wrath?”

The four blanked for a second, then reluctantly nodded, “Alright then, however, we will have to accompany Young Lord inside.”

Indeed, as the Young Lord, it was not likely Shi Yinyu would be so foolish as to swagger into the treasury so openly to steal a large amount of star sand and the grandmist aura.

Then again, even though they relented, they needed to follow Shi Yinyu into the treasury. Only by doing so would they feel reassured.

Shi Yinyu did not object, acquiescing to their request.

Shi Yinyu proceeded to open the treasury entrance with the secret method and stepped inside with the four guardians following closely behind him. The treasury door closed behind them on its own.

Seeing that Shi Yinyu had successfully entered the Nine Yin Treasury, Huang Xiaolong inwardly heaved in relief. Huang Xiaolong believed that getting the grandmist aura was not a problem as long as Shi Yinyu managed to get into the treasury.

Shi Yinyu and the others soon reached the depths of the Nine Yin Treasury. There were winding galaxy rivers, glimmering in midair, and exuding incredible spiritual energy.

These galaxy rivers were formed by glistening star sand. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

One grain of star stand weighed ten thousand catties. It was one of the best materials for forging that was hard to find. Even some of the large auction houses rarely had this material to auction, and even if they did, it was no more than a hundred grains of star sand at one time. But inside the Nine Yin Treasury, there were a billion grains, or more than a trillion?

Shi Yinyu took out a small bottle and infused his godforce into it. Instantly, the small bottle generated a powerful suction force, sucking hundreds and thousands of star sand into its belly. He stopped when there were roughly a million star-sand grains inside the bottle. From there, Shi Yinyu flew deeper into the treasury space, almost near to the end.

Floating at the deepest part of the Nine Yin Treasury were more than a dozen spatial artifacts.

Shi Yinyu reached out and grabbed one of the spatial artifacts.

Inside this spatial artifact was the grandmist aura. Moreover, there were two of them!!

After getting the spatial artifact containing the grandmist aura, Shi Yinyu turned and flew back towards the entrance without delay.

The four Ancestors were inwardly relieved, seeing that Shi Yinyu had only taken the star sand and grandmist aura like he had stated earlier. Shortly after, the four of them stepped out from the treasury with Shi Yinyu. One of them said, “Young Lord, since you’ve got the star sand and grandmist aura required to forge the grandmist artifact, there must be no accident in between. We’ll send people to escort you to the Gate of Nine Yin.”

This Ancestor was still worried and decided to have Shi Yinyu escorted to the Gate of Nine Yin.

“Who has the guts to rob me inside our Nine Yin headquarters?” Shi Yinyu’s face darkened with great displeasure.

But the Ancestor insisted, “If the Young Lord is offended, please pardon me.”

In the end, Shi Yinyu could only nod in agreement with a gloomy expression.

Soon, the four Ancestors summoned six late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts and ordered them to escort Shi Yinyu to the square. At the same time, they exhorted the six Emperors to wait until Shi Yinyu had passed through the Gate of Nine Yin before leaving.

The six complied and escorted Shi Yinyu away from the treasury to the square where the Gate of Nine Yin opened.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, watching this but was in no hurry to make his move.

When the six Emperor Realm experts and Shi Yinyu arrived at the square, Huang Xiaolong sent the Heavenly Hall’s Radiance Angels to deal with them.

Seven twelve-winged Radiance Angels flew out from the Heavenly Hall at the same time, attacking the six Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s Emperor Realm experts with full force.

Although the six Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe’s experts’ strengths ranged between early to mid-Tenth Order Emperors Realm, they were caught off guard by the seven twelve-winged late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm Radiance Angels’ full-force attack. All six of them suffered heavy injuries in the first attack, whereas Shi Yinyu’s body exploded directly.

Concealed within the void, Huang Xiaolong was swift to collect the star sand and grandmist aura, as well as Shi Yinyu’s king of supreme godhead the moment Shi Yinyu exploded.

The six Ancestors saw Shi Yinyu’s body explode, and his godhead, the bottle containing grandmist aura and spatial artifact with the star sand being snatched away. They reacted swiftly

Their furious roars immediately alerted the entire Nine Yin Giant Corpse Tribe.
