Chapter 3511: Comprehending the Dragon Eye Cliff

 

“Big Brother, I know what to do!” The little dragon revealed a crafty little smile.

Huang Xiaolong felt beads of cold sweat dripping down his forehead.

The little dragon was a glutton indeed. Throughout the journey, Huang Xiaolong witnessed how much the little guy could eat. 

A look of fear formed in Chu Huaihua’s eyes, and he roared, “Little b*stard, you’re asking to die!” A whip swept towards the little dragon in an attempt to scare him off.

How could a desperate attempt by Chu Huaihua threaten the little monster? He dodged to attack in an instant as he appeared above Chu Huaihua. With his legs stomping downwards, Chu Huaihua’s head nearly exploded.

Half an hour later…

Chu Huaihao managed to escape, and Chu Huaihua fell captive to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Chu Huaihua whose face was no longer recognizable after the little dragon’s ‘friendly’ treatment. Shaking his head silently, Huang Xiaolong sighed. Ao Guang and the others were much more sympathetic.

Tossing Chu Huaihua into the Sun Moon Furnace, Huang Xiaolong suppressed him along with Chu Huaixiong. He heaved a sigh of relief as joy filled his heart. In the future, he could refine them both! When that happened, he would also refine the treasures he obtained in the Dragon’s Impasse. His strength was sure to take a huge leap forward!

Even if he couldn’t reach the peak of the small completion stage, surpassing 5 billion units of grand cosmos energy wouldn’t be a problem.

After cleaning up the scene, Huang Xiaolong and the others hurried back to the Submerged Dragon Institution.

Pangu and the others were elated to discover his return.

“Little brat, I knew you would make it!” Pangu roared with laughter.

“I told you I was confident of making it out alive…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. He quickly introduced Ao Guang and the others to Huang Long.

Pangu knew Ao Guang and Ao Shenghai, but the two had no idea Pangu was Huang Xiaolong’s master. They gasped in shock as they cupped their fists in greeting.

Huang Long’s eyes remained trained on the little dragon. 

“Hello, Uncle!” The little dragon called out in his sweet voice. Coupled with his obedient facade, Huang Long was instantly taken to the child.

“Hahaha! What’s your name?” Huang Long chuckled happily.

“Uncle, you can call me Starly!” The little dragon giggled.

“Starly? That’s a good name.”

Pangu laughed at the side, “That is a good name indeed…”

The little dragon jumped around like a little kid and continued, “Yeah! I think my name is pretty good too!” 

Ao Shenghai and those who were saved from the Dragon’s Impasse looked at each other as bitter smiles formed on their faces.

Along the way, the little dragon had already revealed his name to the rest.

“Xiaolong, about the Star Dragon Scales…” Pangu asked.

Huang Long and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong as completing the task meant that they would be able to gain a chance to look for the Star Dragon Essence.

Huang Xiaolong nodded happily in response, “I found it!”

In the years that he was gone, Pangu tried many ways to help Huang Long out. However, his condition showed signs of worsening, and there was no other way than to look for the Star Dragon Essence.

Huang Long and the others heaved a sigh of relief.

“Not only did I manage to obtain the Star Dragon Scale, but I also managed to grab more than one!” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Everyone stared at him in shock.

According to Huang Xiaolong, he managed to grab several Star Dragon Scales!

“Xiaolong, how many did you get?” Pangu gasped.

Could he have obtained a dozen of them?

Huang Xiaolong looked at Ao Guang as smiles formed on their faces.

“Nope. I managed to get a bit more than that.”

“More?!” Pangu stared at him in shock.

Could he have obtained several dozen of them?

That was Star Dragon Scales they were talking about! Pangu and Huang Long felt their heart pounding in their chests when they thought of the possibility.

That was…

Lu Qianqian stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

“Should we go and turn the mission in right now?” Lu Qianqian finally choked out the words.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong smiled, “Alright.”

Naturally, the faster he gained access to the Dragon Eyes Cliff, the better!

As such, they quickly made their way to the Missions Hall.

The moment he appeared, the hall master was alerted. After all, the Star Dragon Scale he brought out was too precious of a treasure.

However, Huang Xiaolong made a request when he handed it over to the hall master. “Hold it, I wish to meet with the principal!”

Everyone stared at him like he was a madman.

Chen Suan, the Missions Hall Master, frowned. Even though Huang Xiaolong completed the mission, the principal wasn’t someone they could meet as they wished.

“I can give you another Star Dragon Scale.” Huang Xiaolong was completely indifferent as he continued, “However, I have a condition.”

“What?! You managed to find two Star Dragon Scales?!” Chen Suan was shocked.

“That’s right. I can hand over two scales, but I wish to allow my master and the others to comprehend the Dragon Eyes Cliff too.” 

“Me too, me too!” The little dragon pestered at the side.

Huang Xiaolong nodded hastily. After all, the scales belonged to the little guy.

Chen Suan’s expression sank. In his eyes, Huang Xiaolong was being unreasonable.

“If you can’t make the decision, you can report this to the old freak,” Pangu said at the side.

Hearing how Pangu addressed the principal, Chen Suan was angered. However, he didn’t dare to do a thing as Pangu was someone he couldn’t afford to offend. Eventually, he made the report to Old Dragon Yu Long.

“The principal agreed…” A strange look could be seen on his face when he reappeared. He didn’t expect the principal to actually agree to Huang Xiaolong’s request. One had to know that Yu Long’s temper was notoriously bad. He would never change the rules he set, but he agreed to Huang Xiaolong’s request.

Could it be because of the extra scale?

Indeed, two Star Dragon Scales were indeed a tempting offer.

After receiving the old dragon’s agreement, everyone headed towards the Dragon Eyes Cliff.

The news of Huang Xiaolong’s return, along with his contribution of a second Star Dragon Scale quickly spread through the institution.

“What?! He came back with two Star Dragon Scales?!” Chen Kezhi yelled in fright.

Shan Fei’s expression was even uglier. He thought that Huang Xiaolong would meet his end in the Dragon’s Impasse.

“Contact your masters. I wish to meet them.” Chen Kezhi growled.

As such, Shan Fei quickly tried to contact Chu Huaihao and the others. However, he didn’t receive a reply even after a long time.

…

“Dragon Eyes Cliff!” When they arrived, Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock.

Like what Pangu said, the eyes on the cliff face were closed.

“This is the Dragon Eyes Cliff. All of you are allowed to comprehend its mysteries, but you can’t touch them.” Chen Suan warned, “Let me warn you now… If you touch the cliff face, I won’t be responsible for anything that happens after.”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
