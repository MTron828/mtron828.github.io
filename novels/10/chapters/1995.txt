When they saw the two massive phantoms formed from the light behind Dun Hao, everyone felt their blood boiling!

Even Ao Ping couldn’t believe his eyes.

Of course, Ao Ping was the number one genius in the Dragon World. Not only did he possess a supreme godhead, but he also had an innate Peculiar Dragon Physique. His talent surpassed his father, the current ruler of the Dragon World. It was a shame that the talent he prided himself paled in comparison to Dun Hao.

“Two supreme godheads and two Archdevil bloodlines! How can there be such a talented individual under the heavens?!” An ancestor-level figure muttered to himself.

After revealing his Archdevil bloodlines, the aura around Dun Hao’s body rose to another level. A horrifying pressure appeared in the air, and a brilliant glow surrounded him. Life force poured out from him, and he stood his ground as though he was the ruler who controlled everyone’s life and death in the Radiance World. He portrayed the image of the reincarnation of radiance itself! He was the embodiment of the radiance origin energy!

Huang Xiaolong stared at the two light phantoms behind Dun Hao and swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock. It was no wonder Dun Hao had managed to break into the Fourth Order Emperor Realm with less than thirty thousand years of cultivation.

However, joy soon overwhelmed his shock. He turned to stare at Dun Hao with a burning gaze, as though he had discovered some sort of priceless treasure.

Two Archdevil bloodlines!

It was clear that they were high-grade bloodlines. To Huang Xiaolong, Dun Hao’s Archdevil bloodlines were like potent tonics.

As long as he managed to devour Dun Hao, he would definitely be able to strengthen the three Archdevil bloodlines in his body!

Dun Hao glared at Huang Xiaolong with bloodshot eyes, and killing intent spewed out from every pore in his body. “I was planning on refining the Five-Colored Divine Pill when breaking through to the Sovereign Realm. You made me waste a Five-Colored Divine Pill!”

“I didn’t wish to activate my Archdevil bloodlines, but you forced me to!”

“Ao Li, let me tell you right now. You are going to die a miserable death!”

Dun Hao’s voice resounded through the plaza, and it dripped with bitter resentment.

“There is no way for Ao Li to escape this time!” One of the maidservants standing behind He Jingyi stared at the light phantoms behind Dun Hao and muttered in shock.

He Jingyi nodded her head. “Even though Ao Li has heaven-defying talent, there is no way he will be able to fight with Dun Hao, now that he has activated his two Archdevil bloodlines.”

“Young lady, Dun Hao has been extending his invitation for you to visit him in his manor. It’s clear that he is expressing his interest in you. In my opinion, Dun Hao is the only person capable of matching up to you!” The maidservant continued. “With His Highness Dun Hao’s talent, it’s a matter of time before he breaks into the Sovereign Realm. He might even be able to enter the high-level Sovereign Realm! The Radiance Divine City will definitely be able to unify the Radiance World, and with their help, our Misty Palace might be able to unify the Hell Asura World!”

A mysterious light flashed in He Jingyi’s eyes, but she didn’t respond.

It was true. That was a pretty good choice to make.

Even though she was a proud daughter of the heavens, her talent was far too lacking when compared to Dun Hao. If she managed to become Dun Hao’s woman, it would benefit both her and the Misty Palace.

Just when everyone felt that they had seen Ao Li’s sorry fate, the light around Huang Xiaolong’s body started to move. A supreme godhead slowly emerged, and it seemed to support the heavens with its presence alone.

Of course, everyone felt a little surprised when Huang Xiaolong revealed a single godhead. However, their shock soon subsided. After all, they had long realized his identity as a genius. It was nothing for him to be able to possess a supreme godhead. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was too bad that Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to hide his strength as another supreme godhead appeared in a flash of light.

“Two... Two supreme godheads!” The plaza erupted once again. “Ao Li actually has two supreme godheads!”

“So what if he has two supreme godheads? Even if he has two supreme godheads, he won’t be able to defeat Dun Hao! The Son of Light not only has two supreme godheads, but he also has two Archdevil bloodlines!”

Before they could convince themselves that Dun Hao would still emerge victoriously, another light flashed, and under the shocked gazes of everyone present, a third supreme godhead emerged.

“Three... Three supreme godheads!”

Everyone felt the blood draining from their faces.

Even Ao Ping felt his jaws dropping in fright. “Mother...”

Without waiting for their reaction, a massive golden phantom appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Arch... Archdevil bloodline!”

One of the ancestors behind Qin Huangzhong yelled in shock.

The expressions on the spectators’ faces changed once again.

“How can Ao Li possess an Archdevil bloodline? Doesn’t he already have three supreme godheads?!” The maidservant behind He Jingyi felt a bomb going off in her head.

Another phantom appeared behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Two... Two Archdevil bloodlines!”

Everyone felt their heart skipping a beat when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s second Archdevil bloodline.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong wasn’t done yet . When the third phantom appeared, the heavens and earth seemed to come to a standstill as everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence.

Three supreme godheads and three Archdevil bloodlines! The number alone completely suppressed Dun Hao’s ‘talent.’ So what if he had two supreme godheads and two Archdevil bloodlines?! Dun Hao, who had shocked the world with his talent, seemed to shrink in his spot.

The savage look of delight froze on Dun Hao’s face, and the bloodthirst was nowhere to be seen. The blood drained from his face as he felt suffocated.

“Are you Huang Xiaolong?!” No one knew when, but an ancestor-level figure in the crowd yelled in shock.

His question seemed to bring everyone back to attention as everyone in the plaza turned to stare at ‘Ao Li.’

“That’s right. I am Huang Xiaolong!” Huang Xiaolong removed the disguise on his face. He revealed his original appearance as he stood tall in the middle of the arena.

He had hidden his identity in order to enter the Reverence Moon Academy. Of course, the main reason was to look for the Radiance Ancestor’s treasures. Now that he had found it, it no longer mattered whether or not he hid his identity.

“What? Huang Xiaolong?! The King of Hell?!”

“Ao Li is actually Huang Xiaolong! The rumors about Huang Xiaolong possessing three supreme godheads and three Archdevil bloodlines are true!”

The experts who were present in the plaza broke out into discussion.

Dun Hao retreated several steps, and a look of terror appeared on his face. “Huang Xiaolong?!” Before he completed his sentence, he rose into the air to escape.

He no longer bothered about the bet nor the fight. Who the f*ck cares about those?! I need to get away!

“Running away?!” Huang Xiaolong stared at Dun Hao’s figure, and he chuckled. As he rose into the air, the four lightning pools in the space between his eyebrows started to shake. The three devil steles trembled, and Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to send a slap flying towards Dun Hao.

Under the horrified and desperate gaze in Dun Hao’s eyes, Huang Xiaolong’s palm came smashing down.

“NO!” Dun Hao roared with indignation as the Four Spirits Divine Armor on his body revolved at full power.

“Huang Xiaolong, you dare...” Several tens of figures appeared from the shadows as they charged towards Huang Xiaolong. They were precisely the guards who were sent to protect Dun Hao.

In an instant they appeared, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Heavenly Hall and City of Eternity. He welcomed their attacks with both treasures as the slap he sent towards Dun Hao went crashing down.
