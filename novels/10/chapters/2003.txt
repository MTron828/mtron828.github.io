When everyone stared in shock at the sudden appearance of the King of Shadows and Cang Mutian, a flying wheel broke through the air as it flew towards Huang Xiaolong. Initially, it was the size of a tiny palm. However, in the blink of an eye, it enlarged to the size of a massive continent! It brought with it terrifying momentum as it shot towards its target.

Before it could slice Huang Xiaolong and the others in half, everyone saw how it tore through the stable space of the Radiance World like it was nothing more than rice paper.

The spectators felt a tremor running through their hearts. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Even a Second Order Sovereign like Elan felt the heaven-destroying pressure coming from the wheel. The look on her face changed in an instant.

“Protect His Majesty!” Elan yelled as she reached out to block the sneak attack on Huang Xiaolong.

As a Second Order Sovereign, Elan’s spear could tear through a divine plane like it was nothing. However, when her spear slammed into the spinning wheel, she was sent flying like a kite whose string had broken. The divine spear was torn from her grasp, and it flew to god-knew where.

Even though Elan tried to block the blow, she barely managed to slow it down. After she was sent flying, the wheel slashed towards Huang Xiaolong.

A snort left the lips of Jiang Hong and the three Skull Ancestors in unison. In an instant, the four of them made a move at the same time.

Jiang Hong slapped forward, and resplendent rays of purple light lit up the air before him. The power behind his strike was many times more than that when he had smashed the barrier. The purple light quickly transformed into countless grandmist worms as they welcomed the spinning wheel. Displaying some of his might, the grandmist worms that appeared were comparable to thousand feet tall dragons.

The three Skull Ancestors didn’t remain idle. They reached into the skies and sent out a palm that contained poison corpse qi that could corrode half a divine plane flying towards the wheel. Two scarily strong attacks went to welcome the massive flying wheel.

It was too bad the mighty looking grandmist worms were smashed the instant they came into contact with the spinning wheel. They turned into specks of purple light and disappeared. The attacks that the ancestors had sent out were no different. The poison corpse qi dissipated into nothingness.

Seemingly unaffected, the flying wheel continued to slash towards the few of them.

Cang Mutian and Cang Zongyuan’s expression changed, and the looks on their faces twisted. Cang Mutian’s palm that seemed to be able to cover the heavens reached out and tried to stop the flying wheel.

“Cang Mutian, your opponent is me!” The King of Shadows sneered, and the spike in his hand obstructed the way of Cang Mutian’s palm.

Before the flying wheel could cut through Huang Xiaolong and the countless experts behind him, a staff materialized in its path. Even though it looked like a normal staff, the flying wheel that seemed unstoppable was sent flying the moment it collided with the staff.

Drawing a perfect arc in the sky, the wheel returned to the hands of a baby-faced giant man.

No one knew when he had appeared, but when Cang Mutian, Elan, Jiang Hong, and other Sovereign Realm experts saw the newcomer, a look of shock appeared on their faces.

“Old Monster Lun Zhuan!” Cang Mutian was the first to regain his calm, and he blurted out Lun Zhuan’s name.

As the kid with the giant head retrieved his weapon, a smile slowly appeared on his face. “Cang Mutian, it seems like you’re getting rusty.”

Cang Mutian’s expression sank.

He had no choice but to admit that he was no longer as strong as he was in the past.

Due to the black copper ghosts, his combat strength had been greatly affected.

All of a sudden, Lun Zhuan turned to stare at the space before him as a brilliant light flashed through his eyes. “Reverence Moon Old Man, it seems like you managed to gain quite a lot in the Rotting World.”

Old Monster Lun Zhuan’s voice pierced through space and resounded through the Reverence Moon Academy.

In the Reverence Moon Academy, every single expert present, student or teacher, heard his voice booming in their mind.

The Reverence Moon Old Man didn’t ignore Lun Zhuan. He replied in an indifferent tone. “The same can be said for you. Your gains on the Heavens Path can rival mine, but you should leave. Even though Lord Wan Shi spared your life in the past, it doesn’t mean that I’ll spare your life today!”

When Lun Zhuan heard the Reverence Moon Old Man mentioning the event that had happened in the past, his blood started to boil. A murderous gaze appeared on his face, and he roared, “You old thing! Do you really think that I’m afraid of you?! You old undying b*stard... If not for you, I wouldn’t have become the monster I am today! Let me tell you right now, I’m going to kill that Huang Xiaolong, and there’s nothing you can do about it! Even if you come, you won’t be able to stop me!”

As soon as the words left his lips, Lun Zhuan swung his weapon out towards Huang Xiaolong once again.

Brilliant rays of light emerged from the giant wheel, and every single ray seemed to come from a different world. Each ray of light contained endless might.

A horrifying might that contained the power to shatter the heavens surged out from the wheel as it shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

Space around it started to collapse, and it seemed as though everything that blocked its path would be eliminated without mercy.

“Humph.”

“Too stubborn...” The Reverence Moon Old Man’s voice broke through space and resounded in the minds of everyone present.

The staff that had stopped the wheel appeared once again. This time, it looked different from before. It emitted resplendent rays of light, and it was as though the old man’s stick from before had turned into a supreme treasure. It contained endless might, and runes with the laws of the world were inscribed on it. From the aura each rune was giving off, there was no doubt that a single one would be enough to destroy a world surface.

Boom!

The heavens and earth shook when the two weapons collided.

The world turned upside down, and it was as though Armageddon had arrived.

As the impact from the collision started to spread, the hundreds of divine planes around the battlefield shook. The experts who were hiding in the darkness to observe the battle felt their blood draining from their faces as they hastily retreated. Cang Mutian had to protect Huang Xiaolong and the others while they retreated from the scene of impact.

Like before, the giant wheel was sent flying. However, the Reverence Moon Old Man no longer held back. Previously, he had stopped after preventing the wheel from slicing Huang Xiaolong into two. Right now, his staff shot towards Lun Zhuan without any signs of slowing down.

Old Monster Lun Zhuan’s face finally changed.

“Brother Lun Zhuan, let me assist you!” The King of Shadow yelled suddenly, and he reached out to stop the Reverence Moon Old Man’s staff. With the King of Shadow’s assistance, Lun Zhuan gathered his strength as he sent both his palm flying out towards the incoming staff.

As four palms landed on the staff at the same time, the world seemed to lose its color.

Boom!

With the King of Shadows’ help, Lun Zhuan managed to block the Reverence Moon Old Man’s staff. However, blocking it didn’t mean that they managed to escape unscathed. Both of them were sent retreating, and they were sent flying several tens of thousands of miles away.

Staring at each other, Lun Zhuan and the King of Shadows saw the look of shock in each other’s eyes. It was clear that the strength the Reverence Moon Old Man displayed had wildly exceeded their expectations.

When Dun Ei and the Sovereigns on his side saw what had happened, the expressions on their face changed as well. They knew exactly how strong the King of Shadows and Old Monster Lun Zhuan were. When they saw the both of them flying away from a single strike from the Reverence Moon Old Man, they couldn’t believe their eyes.

Moreover, the Reverence Moon Old Man was sending his attack through space as he remained in the Reverence Moon Academy. If he came over, no one knew if they would be able to stand up to him.

Before anyone could react, the King of Shadows and Lun Zhuan retreated and returned to the side inside the barrier.

When they entered the protective barrier of the Ancient Heavenly Formation, they heaved a sigh of relief.

Lun Zhuan turned to the direction of the Reverence Moon Academy and sneered, “Old thing, I have to admit, your strength exceeded my expectations. It seems like you’re not too far off from the strength Lord Wan Shi displayed in the past. It’s too bad our Ancient Heavenly Formation can’t be broken. So what if you’re strong? You won’t be able to break our formation!” After he addressed the Reverence Moon Old Man, he turned to glare at Huang Xiaolong. “If you make Huang Xiaolong take out half of the Radiance Ancestor’s inheritance, I’ll leave. I will no longer bother with the matters of the Radiance World.”
