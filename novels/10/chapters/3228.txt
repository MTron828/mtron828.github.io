Chapter 3229: Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor!

Huang Shengdao roared with laughter when he saw that Huang Xiaolong merely raised a single finger in response to his attack. “Huang Xiaolong, if you manage to hold off my attack, I’ll…”

A look of terror started to spread across his face when he realized that something was very wrong. “Grand cosmos energy!”

Grand cosmos energy was contained in Huang XIaolong’s finger!

That would mean that Huang Xiaolong not only reached perfection level in all thirteen elements, he even reached the grand perfection level! That was the only reason he would possess grand cosmos energy!

Huang Shengdao couldn’t believe his eyes!

In the past, he took over thirty million years to reach the grand perfection leve!

In a mere million years, Huang Xiaolong, who only reached the perfection level in twelve elements, reached the grand perfection level!

A ray of light from Huang Xiaolong’s finger slammed into the spear light and sword light produced by his weapons by the time he was done thinking. Staring at Huang Xiaolong with his eyes wide, the two rays of light were torn apart.

Huang Shengdao felt a supreme wave of energy slamming into his chest!

Bang!

Like a shooting star, Huang Shengdao was sent flying. Under the shocked gazes of the members of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, he smashed through countless mountain ranges before flying out of the sacred land.

The two weapons landed on one of the random mountain peaks in the distance.

Everyone from the True Dragon Celestial Empire felt their bodies tightening up in fear.

Crawling to his feet, Huang Shengdao glared at Huang Xiaolong with blood staining the corners of his lips. “You… How the f*ck did you grow so strong?!”

A casual point from Huang Xiaolong revealed that he used at least six million units of grand cosmos energy.

That was a lot more than Huang Shengdao at his peak state!

A million years ago, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even started to produce grand cosmos energy!

How in the world did the punk train?! Huang Shengdao had no idea what was going on.

In the past few years, Huang Shengdao only managed to increase his strength due to the assistance of the treasures he obtained in the Mysterious Magician’s Treasury. His power level could be said to be ascending with the speed of a rocket, and he thought that he would be able to suppress Huang Xiaolong with a single hand! However, reality gave him a slap in the face when they finally met.

After he sent Huang Shengdao flying, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother following up. Instead, he started to walk towards the man slowly. “What unfulfilled wishes do you have left? I’ll help you finish them.”

With his expression sinking, a sinister smile slowly formed on Huang Shengdao’s face. “Unfulfilled wishes? Hehe, Huang Xiaolong, you’re dreaming! Do you really think that you have won?!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He shattered a transmission signal in his hands after he was done speaking.

When Huang Xiaolong saw what happened, his heart trembled slightly. However, he didn’t bother stopping Huang Shengdao.

After shattering the transmission signal, Huang Shengdao sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, thirty years ago, the experts of five celestial empires formed an alliance! The experts of the Excessive Darkness, Grand Myriad, Extreme Bliss, and Buddhist Yang Celestial Empire will appear soon! No matter how strong you are, you won’t survive against the onslaught of our celestial empires!”

The moment the words left Huang Shengdao’s lips, experts started to appear in the air around them.

Fu Luosen and the experts of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire were the first to arrive.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Fu Luosen screamed in joy.

Like Huang Shengdao, Fu Luosen had been looking for Huang Xiaolong the moment they entered the World of Departed Souls.

However, he nearly jumped in fright when he saw the state Huang Shengdao was in. He saw a gaping hole in the man’s chest as blood streamed down his body. The armor around Huang Shengdao’s body was shattered beyond belief, and his hair was disheveled. It was as though he fell into a ditch after suffering a terrifying blow to the chest.

“Brother Huang Shengdao, this…”

“Huang Xiaolong! He did it!” Huang Shengdao gasped in pain.

“What?!” Fu Luosen turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong. “You… You…”

How could Huang Xiaolong possibly injure Huang Shengdao? Not to mention the fact that Huang Shengdao was on the brink of death. One had to know that Huang Shengdao’s strength took a leap forward after he obtained the Dao Emperor’s Treasury and Dao Emperor's sword! Fu Luosen estimated that Huang Shengdao should have already reached four million units of grand cosmos energy.

“Did he enter the grand perfection level?!” Fu Luosen asked in disbelief.

“He reached six million units of grand cosmos energy when we exchanged blows previously!”

Fu Luosen sucked in a cold breath as the members of the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

The experts of the other three celestial empires arrived quickly, and they were equally as shocked when they realized how strong Huang Xiaolong was.

Even though they had surrounded Huang Xiaolong, no one wanted to make the first move. After all, the threat of the old dragon and Huang Xiaolong’s actual strength were real deterrents.

If it was before Huang Xiaolong reached the grand perfection level, they would have attacked him without the slightest misgiving. However, with six million units of grand cosmos energy, he was a force to be reckoned with.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across those present and sneered, “This is a grudge I have with the Excessive Darkness Celestial Empire and the True Dragon Celestial Empire. If all of you leave now, I’ll take it as though I didn’t see you here. Otherwise…”

The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor frowned. “Or else what?”

“Otherwise, I’ll kill everyone here!”

The experts of the three celestial empires felt rage burning in their hearts the moment the words left his lips.

“Preposterous!” The Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor sneered, “You’re a mere junior with six million units of grand cosmos energy! Do you really think you can take us all on at once?! I alone am enough to kill you! The only reason I help back was because of your master, you dumb*ss!”

It was clear that the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor was enraged by Huang Xiaolong’s threats.

As soon as he spoke, he released his aura completely. The power of eight hundred million units of grand cosmos energy was displayed to the world.

The energy fluctuations alone were enough to cause the space around them to crumble.

The mountain ranges in the distance shattered into tiny little pieces from the revelation of the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor’s power.

With eight hundred million units of grand cosmos energy, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor would be able to crush an entire holy world if he so willed it. Even if he wasn’t as strong as Huang Dinghai or the other super celestial emperors, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor was strong.

Fu Luosen and the others sucked in another cold breath in terror.

Locking down the space around Huang Xiaolong, the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor snorted, “Huang Xiaolong, I’ll give you a chance to kill yourself based on the fact that you’re the Blazing Dragon’s disciple. If you force me to make my move, you’ll die a horrible death!”

Fu Luosen followed up with a laughter filled with mockery. “Huang Xiaolong, did you not hear what His Majesty said? Kill yourself right now! If I were you, I'd blow myself up right this instant!”

His laughter rang through the air, but it was rudely interrupted by a chuckle from Huang Xiaolong.

“Is that really the case?” The shackle around the space formed by the Extreme Bliss Celestial Emperor started to crack as another terrifying aura descended on the lands.
