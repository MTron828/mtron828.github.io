Originally, Chen Xinde and Cui Wei could have easily broken free of Huang Xiaolong’s devouring power with their pinnacle of Heavenly Monarch Realm strengths, but to their despair, Chen Xinde and Cui Wei discovered that their godhead’s godforce were constrained by a mysterious force.

The source of this mysterious force was Xiang Xun.

Under Xiang Xun’s suppression, Chen Xinde and Cui Wei could do nothing but watch their blood essence, true essence, and godforce flow into Huang Xiaolong’s body; helplessly feeling their life force dwindle and slip away from their fingers.

It was extremely quiet in this part of the forest, except for the noises made by Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s feeble groans and struggles.

The rest from the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace watched powerlessly as Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s bodies slowly shrunk in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Tong Jiang gulped with much difficulty as he racked his brains for an escape route. But he noticed that whenever he made a subtle movement, Xiang Xun would coldly glance in his direction.

He wanted to send a call for help back to the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace but discovered that the space they were trapped in was completely segregated from outside. Messages couldn’t be sent out through the communication talisman.

“Everyone, we’ll fight them!”

“We’ll die anyways if we don’t do anything!”

“The Blood Gorefiend Descends!”

Finally, the several Grand Elders from the Martial Demon Emperor Palace could not endure it anymore. They bellowed as violent godforce surged out from their bodies, aiming their attacks at Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and the rest.

Several people attacked at the same time. Blood-colored godforce roared, turning into grotesque blood gorefiends that pounced towards Huang Xiaolong’s group. These Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Grand Elders were all Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm masters; under their joint attacks, they could deal a heavy blow to a Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch Realm master.

In a split second, the swarm of blood gorefiends reached Huang Xiaolong, Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, and the others.

Just as Xiang Xun was about to act upon seeing this, the swarm of blood gorefiends exploded into a mist of blood, and vanished without a trace all of a sudden.

Both the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s experts, the Demonic Python City’s Mayor, and three clans’ experts were dumbfounded.

What, what happened? Why did this happen?

Obviously, that elephant had no time to react.

But Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the rest realized the reason almost immediately.

There was only one person amongst them who was able to disperse those blood gorefiends without a trace—Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong. Forget those blood gorefiends, even the attacks that were several hundred times more powerful than the combined attack from these Sixth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Grand Elders, were nothing in front of Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong. He could eliminate these attacks with a single thought.

While the several Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Grand Elders were still in a daze, Xiang Xun’s kick landed on them. The Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Grand Elders exploded to their deaths in high air, including their godheads.

After seeing the several Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Grand Elders’ futile resistance that ended up with their deaths, hopeless despair gripped Tong Jiang, the Demonic Python City’s Mayor, and the remaining experts’ hearts.

Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Supreme Godhead continued to devour Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s blood essences, true essences, and godforce. This amount was not something that the three clan’s captain guards could compare with. Thus, it took Huang Xiaolong a bit more time to absorb these essences and energies into his body.

Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong watched Huang Xiaolong in shock for the whole time.

Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was just at the late-Third Order God King Realm. Someone with his level of cultivation dared to absorb two pinnacle Heavenly Monarch Realm masters’ blood essences, true essences, and godforce?

On top of that, simultaneously!

Not to mention, these two masters were at the pinnacle of the Heavenly Monarch Realm. It would be overwhelming for a late-Third Order God King Realm disciple to withstand the blood essence, true essence, and godforce of a God King Realm cultivator at the pinnacle.

But the truth was right in front of him. Huang Xiaolong continued to devour Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s blood essences, true essences, and godforce, without any repercussions.

Isn’t this a bit too scary?

This was the Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong’s thoughts, on the other hand, the impact was far greater on the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s experts. The fear in their hearts was reflected in their eyes.

In truth, this was because Huang Xiaolong had refined the Netherworld King’s Jade’s third restriction, obtaining the vast amount of darkness element energy from it, which had enabled Huang Xiaolong’s Archdevil Supreme Godhead to evolve in the process. Otherwise, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t have been able to devour the blood essences, true essences, and godforce from Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s bodies as he was doing at that moment.

Of course, another reason why Huang Xiaolong was capable of devouring Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s essences and godforce was due to his three king of supreme godheads and three avatars who too had king of supreme godheads!

Furthermore, Huang Xiaolong had the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool!

Close to an hour later, Chen Xinde and Cui Wei were reduced to dried corpses.

Huang Xiaolong’s blood essence and godforce coursed vigorously through his body after devouring their energies.

In the process, Huang Xiaolong’s late-Third Order God King Realm cultivation had risen to the peak late-Third Order God King Realm. It was merely half a step from advancing to Fourth Order God King Realm.

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly delighted. This way, even if he failed to find the lower half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele, he still could breakthrough to Fourth Order God King Realm.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong snapped fingers, and two wisps of divine fire burned away Chen Xinde and Cui Wei’s corpses before he turned his attention towards the Demonic Python City’s Mayor, He Clan’s Patriarch, Tong Jiang, and the rest.

“One person can live amongst you.” Huang Xiaolong said suddenly.

One person can live!

Xiang Xun, Xu Baisheng, and the others were surprised but soon understood that Huang Xiaolong was leaving one person alive so that person could return and report to the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace! He wanted the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace to send more experts after them!

......

Half an hour later, the Demonic Python City’s Mayor sped away. He was the one who had survived.

Huang Xiaolong watched the Demonic Python City’s Mayor fly away, then turned to Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong and said, “Senior Brother, you won’t blame me for letting that Demonic Python City’s Mayor go, would you?”

Once that Demonic Python City’s Mayor returns, the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s wrath would descend upon them. It was more than likely that there would be Emperor Realm masters pursuing them, in that case, Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong would get dragged into the water along with them. Would this make things difficult for Jiang Hong?

After all, this would form a grudge between Jiang Hong and the Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Palace’s Emperors.

Jiang Hong naturally understood Huang Xiaolong’s concerns. He grinned at Huang Xiaolong and said, “You still know how to be considerate towards your Senior Brother? Don’t worry about it, it’s merely a Magic Shaman Emperor Palace and Martial Demon Emperor Realm. Don’t mention them, even if you poke a hole through the heavens, Senior Brother will take care of it for you. What can I do, I’m your Senior Brother.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Warmth filled Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

“Alright, stop loitering here. Xiaolong, didn’t you want to go to the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range? Let’s go now.” The little cow interjected.

“Senior Azure Cow, you all are planning to head to the Scarlet Blood Mountain Range?” Grandmist Emperor Jiang Hong had not expected Scarlet Blood Mountain to be their destination.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and said, “We are looking for something in the Floating Twilight Land.”

Jiang Hong smiled. “Looking for something? Junior Brother, you won’t happen to be looking for the grandmist aura here, right? In truth, I came to the Floating Twilight Land to look for the grandmist aura.”

“Grandmist aura!” Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and the rest exclaimed in surprise.

“Senior Brother, you mean there is a source of grandmist aura in this Floating Twilight Land?” Huang Xiaolong asked with anticipation.

Jiang Hong spoke frankly as he nodded, “There likely is, but I can’t be certain. In the last several hundred million years, I’ve been searching for clues of the grandmist aura’s whereabouts. Some time back, a treasure appeared in the Floating Twilight Land and fell into the hands of an Emperor Palace’s Grand Elder. That treasure was taken out for auction. There were faint traces of grandmist aura on that treasure, which is why I surmised there might be a source of grandmist aura in the Floating Twilight Land.”
