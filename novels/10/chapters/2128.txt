Chapter 2129: Discovering a Chaos Lightning Pool!

“Lord Tian Chen!” The Dark Curses Old Ancestor stood up all of a sudden, and he cupped his fist towards the young man. “My disciple was killed by Huang Xiaolong! I hope Lord Tian Chen can seek justice on behalf of my Dark Curses Sect!”

The young man was precisely the younger brother of the Heavenly Master, Tian Chen! He was the groom marrying Wan Xiaorong the next day!

“I’ve heard of it. We will deal with him by following the rules of our Heavenly World.” Tian Chen nodded his head, and he didn’t display any emotions on his face. “Tomorrow, my older brother will leave seclusion. He will make Huang Xiaolong kneel to apologize for his mistakes.”

“Many thanks to Lord Tian Chen!” The Dark Curses OId Ancestor sat down after bowing to Tian Chen.

When Wan Shi thought about Huang Xiaolong, his expression sank, and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong is nothing without that lightning bead of his. Without it, he would already be a stream of chaos qi!”

Another ancestor quickly stood up to agree with Wan Shi, “Lord Wan Shi is right! Without that lightning bead, Lord Wan Shi, you will be able to kill Huang Xiaolong with a hand tied behind you! Huang Xiaolong is a mere Fourth Order Sovereign! Even a hundred of him wouldn’t be able to take Lord Wan Shi on!”

Everyone in the hall expressed their agreement as they threw shade at Huang Xiaolong.

After hearing everyone’s negative opinion of Huang Xiaolong, the look on Wan Shi’s face finally started to lighten up. “Tian Chen, you’re going to marry Xiaorong tomorrow. Huang Xiaolong will definitely turn up to cause some trouble! We have to take some precautions.”

Tian Chen chuckled, “Brother Wan Shi, you don’t have to worry about that. If Huang Xiaolong dares to cause trouble tomorrow, my big brother will kill him on the spot. After he dies, we will continue to carry out the ceremony. In fact, the festivities will heighten with Huang Xiaolong’s death!”

...

In a stone pavilion situated on the Solitary Horn Peak...

“Divine Burial Grand Art...” Huang Xiaolong looked at the clouds drifting before him, and he muttered to himself. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The news of the Divine Burial Grand Art had already spread throughout the lands.

“Divine Burial Grand Art?” A frown formed on the little cow’s face, and she asked, “Is the Divine Burial Grand Art really so strong?”

How strong did a divine art have to be in order to bury worlds at the level of the Divine World or even Hell?!

If an overlord went all out, a single punch would be enough to shatter a world surface. However, that was only a single world surface they were talking about. How many world surfaces did a single world boundary? There were hundreds of millions of world surfaces in a world boundary, and an overlord would take quite some time to destroy them all!

It was an extremely frightening fact that the Divine Burial Grand Art could an entire world boundary?

The King of Grandmist laughed coldly, “The strength of the Divine Burial Grand Art should be a rumor started by the members of the Heavenly World. They should be messing with Xiaolong’s head.”

Cang Mutian agreed, “That might be true. However, the only thing that we can be certain of is that the Divine Burial Grand Art will be a lot stronger than Wan Shi’s Great Purity Secret Art!”

Instead of agreeing or disagreeing with them, Huang Xiaolong changed the topic and started to talk about the Heavenly Road.

An hour later, the little cow brought up the idea of going out to stroll along the streets.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and agreed. After all, they had nothing to do, and a single day’s worth of cultivation wouldn’t do anything for someone at their level. Going out to take a stroll was a pretty good idea.

The few of them emerged from the courtyard and started wandering around aimlessly.

Along the way, they bumped into experts from the various factions. As soon as they approached, everyone would run far away.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother about those people in the slightest.

After walking around for half a day, Huang Xiaolong and the others decided to head back to the courtyard when he felt a short burst of activity from the lighting pools in his body.

This...?

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock. He had located another chaos lightning pool!

Why would a lightning pool be hidden in the Heavenly World?!

As he locked his gaze on a mountain range not too far away, Huang Xiaolong circulated his energy through all six lightning pools he had gathered. The feeling of attraction he felt confirmed that there was a chaos lightning pool up ahead.

His gaze pierced through the mountain peak before him, and he noticed nothing special about it.

“What’s wrong?” The little cow and the others couldn’t help but ask when they noticed the weird air around Huang Xiaolong.

“There’s a chaos lightning pool ahead.” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

Everyone stared at him in silence for a full second before smiles broke out on their faces.

“What?!” The little cow roared with laughter, “You were missing three before this! With the Fifth Earth Lightning Pool Map in your hands, you should be able to obtain it with ease. Now that you have located another one, there should only be one left!”

You will be gathering all nine chaos lightning pools!

When they thought of the possibility, everyone felt their hearts trembling in anticipation.

The King of Grandmist couldn’t help but cheer, “It seems like we didn’t make a trip to the Heavenly World in vain!”

“When Xiaolong gathers all nine great lightning pools, we will be able to hasten the growth of all the origin treasures!” A brilliant light flashed through Cang Mutian’s eyes as his breathing sped up. “By then...”

By then, there would be more than enough origin treasures for them to refine!

They could refine origin treasures like popping divine pills!

“Since there is a lightning pool up ahead, are we going to grab it now?” The Flying Devil Python asked.

The little cow nodded and continued, “We should grab it now... Who knows what will happen after the battle with the Heavenly Master? What if the lightning pool runs away?” Even though the little cow was joking, there was a real possibility of that happening.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong pointed towards the mountain peak before him. “Let’s go!”

Previously, he had seen troops stationed around the mountain range. There were tons of troops, and it seemed as though it was a heavily guarded installation of the Heavenly World. Regardless, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care about offending the Heavenly Master further.

Even if the old man were to appear to stop him, there was no way Huang Xiaolong would give up obtaining the lightning pool! After all, it concerned his senior brother’s life!

As they slowly approached, they were stopped by the guards around the mountain range. It was clear that none of them recognized Huang Xiaolong. “Stop right there! This is Lord Tian Chen’s personal cultivation grounds! Anyone who approaches will be killed! Get lost immediately!”

Huang Xiaolong and the rest were shocked.

They had never expected it to be Tian Chen’s personal training grounds.

Didn’t that mean that Tian Chen had already located the lightning pool in the past and sealed it in his cultivation grounds to increase the effectiveness of it?

Whatever the case, they couldn’t be bothered with the details. The Flying Devil Python opened its mouth and swallowed every single one of the guards.

As they continued to approach, countless soldiers charged towards them.

Before long, an ear-splitting gong rang through the skies of the Heavenly World.

In the main palace of the Heavenly World, Wan Shi and the others who were enjoying a pre-celebration banquet revealed a questioning look as Tian Chen’s transmission symbol trembled. The moment he swept his divine sense over it, Tian Chen’s face changed. Fire spewed out from his eyes, and he raged, Huang Xiaolong, you’re going too far!”

Wan Shi and the others turned to stare at each other in silence. What did Huang Xiaolong do again?

Tian Chen got to his feet and yelled, “Huang Xiaolong and the others barged into my personal cultivation grounds! They killed more than half of the guards I stationed there!”
