Huang Xiaolong was stupefied for a moment, “The Myriad Curses Devil Stele!?”

“That’s right. The Myriad Curses Devil Stele is the origin of all curses. If you obtain the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and become its master, not only the Blue Soul’s Curse, even the more terrifying Skull Devil Curse can be erased.” The Black Wolf Race’s Lu Xiaoqing interjected.

Huang Xiaolong shifted his gaze to Lu Xiaoqing.

Lu Xiaoqing took a deep breath and looked straight back at Huang Xiaolong with sincerity as she spoke, “I really do know, the rough location of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele. I can tell you, and we can recognize you as our master, but you have to promise me one thing.”

Huang Xiaolong’s inquiring gaze turned sharp as he spoke, “You should understand one thing here that it is I who saved your lives. Not to mention, I can also search your soul like Lan Bowei planned to do earlier. That way, I still would learn the whereabouts of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele. You are not qualified to bargain with me.”

Lu Xiaoqing remained calm. “Yes, you did save us, but your goal is also the Myriad Curses Devil Stele. Although you can search my soul like Lan Bowei, I can destroy part of my memories to make sure you won’t find clues about the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s location.”

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze remained fixed on Lu Xiaoqing as he nudged, “Speak, what request do you have?”

“I’ll tell you the whereabouts of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s location, but you must promise me to avenge our Black Wolf Race and obliterate the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire.” Lu Xiaoqing barely finished her words without gritting her teeth. At the mention of Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire, hatred roiled in her obsidian pupils.

Huang Xiaolong smiled knowingly. He shook his head and said, “According to what I know, the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire’s Great Emperor is a Sovereign Realm expert. Do you think I can kill a Sovereign Realm expert?”

Before arriving at the Eternal Devil City, Huang Xiaolong had taken the time to learn about the Kingdom of Devil Beasts’ nine empires from Gao Changran. So, he was not completely ignorant of the strengths of the nine empires’ Great Emperors.

The Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire’s Great Emperor was called Lan Chong, a Sovereign Realm expert comparable to the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had the City of Eternity, Heavenly Hall, and the four odd beasts, Huang Xiaolong did not have the confidence to claim he could kill this level of existence. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lu Xiaoqing hesitated and took a step back, “Then, you promise me that you will annihilate the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire before you die.”

She was aware it was difficult for the current Huang Xiaolong to kill an existence like Lan Chong.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and refused again. “I can only promise you that I will help you kill the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire’s important higher echelons and core disciples.”

The Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire controls about one-tenth of the whole Kingdom of Devil Beasts. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t go slaughtering one-tenth of the Kingdom of Devil Beasts.

Lu Xiaoqing nodded her head in agreement, “I’ll take it!”

In truth, the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire would get destroyed, sooner or later, after their important higher echelons and core disciples were killed, divided, and swallowed up by other empires. It was the same as destroying the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire.

Lu Xiaoqing subsequently requested Huang Xiaolong to swear an oath.

After Huang Xiaolong had sworn his oath, Lu Xiaoqing honestly told Huang Xiaolong the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s location.

“The Cursed Forest?” Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded for a moment.

“Yes, it’s at the Cursed Forest.” Lu Xiaoqing affirmed, nodding her head to emphasize her words. “More accurately, it’s at the ice lake on the north side of the Cursed Forest.”

The ice lake on the north side of the Cursed Forest! Huang Xiaolong inwardly repeated to himself.

Though the location had yet to be confirmed, it was more than enough for Huang Xiaolong, who possessed the Blood Eye Devil Stele.

If the Myriad Curses Devil Stele could really be found on the northern side of the Cursed Forest, Huang Xiaolong would manage to pinpoint the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s location based on the resonance of his Blood Eye Devil Stele with the Myriad Curses Devil Stele, as long as he entered within a certain range.

However, the Cursed Forest itself made Huang Xiaolong frown.

The Kingdom of Devil Beasts’ devil beasts and the Devil Race had always been on unfriendly terms. Thus entering deep into the Kingdom of Devil Beasts was a highly risky activity. Moreover, the Cursed Forest was at the deepest region of the Kingdom of Devil Beasts and was known as one of the most perilous lands.

The Cursed Forest, as its name indicated, was a cursed forest. According to some people, every inch of land and tree of the Cursed Forest contained the power of the curse. When this power of curse entered the body, it was tough to expel.

Moreover, the further north of the Cursed Forest one went, the more powerful the curse power was. A peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert would think twice before venturing in because he would have a hard time expelling the curse power from his body. In truth, even a Sovereign Realm expert would have to exert a lot of effort to expel the curse power out of his body if contaminated.

Seeing Huang Xiaolong frown, Gao Changran added, “Lord, I know something that can resist the Cursed Forest’s curse power.”

“Oh,” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up, “What is it?”

"It’s a stone called Heavenly Origin Stone.” Gao Changran went on, “The Heavenly Origin Stone is said to contain a mysterious power. When triggered, it can ignore the Cursed Forest’s cursed power inside the forest. The thing is, the Heavenly Origin Stone is the Heavenly Dragon Bear Race’s inheritance treasure, so...”

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow in surprise.

...Heavenly Dragon Bear Race?

The Heavenly Dragon Bear Race could be considered as the most mysterious among the many devil beasts’ races. They rarely appear, and no one knew where they lived.

“I know where the Heavenly Dragon Bear Race is.” At this time, the Black Wolf Race’s Lu Xiaoqing interjected from the side, but added, “However, the Heavenly Origin Stone is the Heavenly Dragon Bear’s inheritance treasure. I’m afraid that even if we reach their place, they might not be willing to lend it to us.”

Hearing that, Huang Xiaolong asked, “It’s easier if you know where they are. We’ll take things step by step.” With a wave of his hand, he threw out the Tushita Flying Ship.

“Is this the Tushita Flying Ship that was auctioned at the Eternal Devil City some time back?” The high-level Emperor Realm Black Wolf Race expert exclaimed in shock.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong confirmed.

The four Black Wolf Race members were astounded. Some messages related to the Eternal Devil City’s auction had reached the Kingdom of Devil Beasts. Lu Xiaoqing and the others had heard some of it, hence it was no surprise that they knew who had bought the Tushita Flying Ship.

Then, this black-haired young man in front of them was...?!

His Majesty, the Nether King Huang Xiaolong?!

The four of them nearly jumped out of their skin in fright and quickly knelt on their knees.

“Your Majesty, we...” Lu Xiaoqing began.

“Alright, it’s fine. Stand up.” Huang Xiaolong knew what Lu Xiaoqing and the other three wanted to say. “I do not blame you. Now, time is of essence. We should hurry to the Heavenly Dragon Bear Race and get the Heavenly Origin Stone as soon as possible.”

Everyone complied respectfully.

Without delay, Huang Xiaolong and the others quickly boarded the Tushita Flying Ship and departed to the Heavenly Dragon Bear’s hideout. To increase the Tushita Flying Ship’s speed, Huang Xiaolong used high-grade chaos spirit stones as fuel and had put the four odd beasts, twelve-winged Radiance Angels, and one hundred Undead Netherguards at the helm.

“Your Majesty, that Blue Soul’s Curse in that Lan Bowei’s body should be implanted by the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Great Emperor. The moment Lan Bowei died, the Great Emperor Lan Cong would have known about it.” As they set off, Gao Changran whispered to Huang Xiaolong, his face etched with anxiety.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. This was also the point he was most concerned about.

As long as the Blue Soul’s Curse remained in his body, Lan Ching would be able to locate him through the Blue Soul’s Curse’s position. From this moment on, he would be subjected to an endless pursue and assassinations from the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire.
