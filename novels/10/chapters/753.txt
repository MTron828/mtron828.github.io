Huang Xiaolong was stupefied by the extent of changes in his soul.

Even Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was exclaiming in envy, “This, this is too exaggerated! How can anyone’s soul reach this level of clarity?!”

If Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi wasn’t witnessing it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t believe that a person’s soul could actually achieve this level of clarity!

The radiance from Huang Xiaolong’s soul would absolutely shock the four galaxies if it could be displayed out of his body!

No, not only the four galaxies, but hundreds and thousands of galaxies!

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi could already imagine the shocking heavenly phenomenon that would appear when Huang Xiaolong condensed his godhead.

The higher the rank of a godhead, the more extraordinary the heavenly phenomenon that appeared would be.

Hearing Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s exclamation, Huang Xiaolong’s face split into a wide grin, “Based on my soul’s current clarity, I should be able to condense a godhead above rank ten, right?”

Huang Xiaolong was feeling quite proud of himself.

Think about it, within the four galaxies, in thousands and millions of years, no one had ever achieved the same level of soul clarity as him. Feeling proud and complacent was granted.

Watching Huang Xiaolong’s proud expression, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi chuckled, “If your current soul clarity cannot condense a rank ten godhead, then no one under the heavens can do it!”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, however, his ultimate goal wasn’t a rank ten godhead.

It was the rank above emperor, a supreme rank godhead! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The king of godheads!

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong checked his dantian. The space inside this dantian had expanded significantly, his true immortal essence force was even more boundless. Moreover, there were signs that it was evolving once again.

‘If I advance to the Highgod Realm, will my true immortal essence fire evolve to golden immortal essence force?’ Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

Something occurred to Huang Xiaolong and he suddenly asked, “Old Dragon, can the current me break the Dragon Pearl’s seal?”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was stunned by the question, falling silent.

“Maybe, we can give it a try?” A while later, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s voice sounded hoarse when he spoke. Despite wanting to remain calm, he still failed to hide the slight quiver in his voice.

For anyone who had been confined for tens of thousands of years, thinking that they would be free soon, excitement was only the tip of the iceberg.

“Alright, let’s give it a try!” Determination gleamed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Though in the past, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi had said that only Highgod Realm masters and above could break the Dragon Pearl’s seal, Huang Xiaolong’s current strength definitely surpassed an early First Order Highgod Realm master.

Even without using the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire, Huang Xiaolong was confident that the current him could defeat the Phoenix Clan’s Patriarch, Huang Hongtian!

Huang Xiaolong quickly composed himself and focused, carefully and slowly directing the force from the Black Tortoise Divine Fire and Vermilion Bird Divine Fire toward the Dragon Pearl between his brows.

Soon, the two divine fires had wrapped around the Dragon Pearl, inching toward the seal’s location.

Right at this moment, the seal inside the Dragon Pearl trembled. Lights flickered as a sealing force surged out, wanting to shake away the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires.

The space within the Dragon Pearl violently shook.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyebrows rose in surprise. He made the two divine fires remain still while fending off the sealing off from the Dragon Pearl, then gradually pushing its sealing force back to the grand sealing formation.

At the same time, inside the Dragon Pearl space, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi reverted back to his true golden dragon form, spewing out dragon qi. He was supporting the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires in pushing back and suppressing the sealing formation’s force.

Although the progress was excruciatingly slow, Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi saw hope.

Time passed... One minute, ten minutes...

Half an hour, one hour...

Lights glimmered endlessly on Huang Xiaolong’s body, his forehead furrowed from the strenuous effort. Even taking the Phoenix Clan Patriarch Huang Hongtian’s Nine Phoenix Scorching Sky Palm was easier than this.

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi was feeling the same as Huang Xiaolong. In fact, because he himself was being sealed inside the Dragon Pearl, the burden on him was heavier than Huang Xiaolong. It could be said that, to support Huang Xiaolong, Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi even managed to summon the strength used to suck milk.

Three hours passed in this manner.

After three long hours of suppression, the Dragon Pearl’s sealing force was finally pushed back into the sealing formation, and then onward to breaking the eye of the sealing formation.

Lights flickered unstably on Huang Xiaolong’s skin, wisps of white smoke were rising from the crown of his head.

Huang Xiaolong was already at the end of his tethers at this point.

Even the dragon qi from Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s golden dragon body was faint and intermittent.

When Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi were close to the point of collapse, both the Black Tortoise and Vermilion Bird Divine Fires’ spirit roared toward the sky.

Snow-white and crimson lights exploded from the two divine fire spirits, merging into a golden-purple light that slammed into the center of the sealing formation.

A faint yet clear crack sounded.

The dragon diagram at the center of the sealing formation cracked and crumbled. In the next second, the grand sealing formation disintegrated.

This abrupt change bewildered Huang Xiaolong and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi.

Half a beat later, the old dragon regained his senses. He laughed loudly with euphoria.

“The seal’s broken at last!”

“This Old Dragon is finally free!!”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi raised his head upwards, issuing a resounding roar to express the elation in his heart.

Huang Xiaolong let out a long breath in relief, a wide smile on his face.

He was happy for the Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi, he was free from the Dragon Pearl’s restrictions.

After so many years together, the old dragon was his teacher and also a friend.

Without his help, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be as strong as he was in less than a hundred years’ time.

“Come on, let’s return to the surface first!” Huang Xiaolong said. His figure disappeared in a blur as he flew toward the Phoenix Volcano’s crater mouth. It didn’t take him long to return to the outside world.

Once outside, a golden light flashed on Huang Xiaolong’s forehead and Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi’s golden dragon body flew out, rising toward the sky. He soared, piercing through the clouds.

Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly watching his antics.

It was quite some time later before the old dragon was willing to fly downward, hovering in front of Huang Xiaolong. With a twist of his golden body, he changed into human form, coming to a kneel before Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong hastened forward to help Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi up, slightly chiding, “Old Dragon, what’re you doing?”

Gratitude shone from the dragon’s eyes, “Little Huang brat, without your help, I would be trapped inside the Dragon Pearl for eternity.”

Hung Xiaolong waved his hand, smiling at him, “Without your help, there’s no way I could have killed the Deities Templar’s Preceptor, I wouldn’t have been able to get the Hailstone Treasure, and it would’ve been impossible to have any of my current achievements. There’s no need to mention these things between us!”

Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi laughed heartily and was finally willing to stand up.

“Come, we’re going to the Phoenix Clan’s headquarters!” Huang Xiaolong’s tone abruptly changed. Dragon Emperor Ao Taiyi nodded. The two of them leaped into the air, disappearing from the Phoenix Volcano in an instant.

Both of them had their divine sense spread out, and very soon, they found the Phoenix Clan’s headquarters.

Shortly, two figures were standing in the air above the Phoenix Clan’s headquarters.
