Chapter 2808: Three Small Worlds!

When Huang Xiaolong saw them again, a smile hung from his face.

Now that he had been successfully reborn, he could speak of the experience as one that nearly cost him his life. He had experienced the feeling of death, and he was no longer the Huang Xiaolong of the past. His understanding towards life, the grand dao, and everything around him were different.

Now that he had successfully entered the Primal Ancestor Realm, the small world in Huang Xiaolong’s dantian had taken shape. Cosmos energy filled his body, and Huang Xiaolong was shocked to discover the presence of two other small worlds!

There were a total of three small worlds in his body!

However, the other two had yet to grow fully, and they were unable to produce the cosmos energy the completed worlds could. Even so, Huang Xiaolong was shocked beyond belief.

Even the most talented Dao Venerables wouldn’t be able to hold two small worlds in their bodies, right?! Much less three!

However, like the number of dao souls he had, Huang Xiaolong managed to form three small worlds!

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong’s physical body had reached a whole new level of sturdiness after his rebirth. His Huang Long Bloodline had evolved to possess the power of nirvana!

That was the true power of nirvana! Before this, if they had expected Huang Xiaolong to gain the power of lesser rebirth to reform his body, he had exceeded their expectations. Like the first phoenix born during the creation of the world, Huang Xiaolong could completely reform himself, in both body and soul. But unlike the phoenix that could only undergo rebirth nine times, Huang Xiaolong would be able to do so an unlimited number of times!

The power of nirvana was one of the strongest traits one could ever possess.

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong not only possessed the power of nirvana, but he could control both absolute flame and absolute frost…

The grand dao energy contained in his three dao souls could be said to be purer than any other expert by a thousand times!

His twelve high-order Saint Fates had also undergone a transformation after tempering by the purple-golden lightning, black lotus flame, and the Light of Nirvana. They were even stronger than before, and the light they emitted was several times more resplendent.

“Late-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!” Someone yelled all of a sudden. Huang Xiaolong’s breakthrough hadn’t just allowed him to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm, but he had directly entered the late-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

That was something that had never happened before in the history of the Divine Tuo Holy World!

Even though some super-geniuses who possessed ten high-order Saint Fates could enter the peak of the early-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, the difference between an early-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor and a late-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor was wider than the heavens and earth!

Fu Daosheng and the other three half-step Dao Venerables stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief.

The Immemorial Qilins were equally as shocked. They had followed the Immemorial Dao Venerable for a long time, but they had never seen anyone entering the late-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm the moment they broke through.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in amusement when he saw the looks on their faces. “I devoured the grand dao spiritual vein in the treasury in order to reach my current level!”

There were a ton of reasons he had managed to enter his current cultivation level. One of them was because of the Light of Nirvana and his Huang Long Bloodline, and another reason was his three dao souls and twelve high-order Saint Fates. Of course, one of the most important reasons was that he had devoured six grand dao spiritual veins in the treasury!

After his rebirth, his Huang Long Bloodline had reached a terrifying level of power. He also discovered that the speed at which he had devoured grand dao energy was several times faster than before!

He had no idea how many times faster his cultivation had become, but he was sure that he had managed to devour all six grand dao spiritual veins in a couple of days!

The six veins included the Scarlet Dragon Grand Dao Spiritual Vein the Saint Devil Prince had coveted.

Huang Xiaolong had a sneaking suspicion that after his Huang Long Bloodline was mature, he would be able to devour everything under the heavens! Swallowing a sacred land wouldn’t be an exaggeration!

“What?! You devoured the grand dao spiritual veins in the treasury?!” The ice qilin couldn’t believe what it heard. “There were six grand dao spiritual veins in the treasury! You devoured them all?!”

Fu Daosheng and the others were stunned silly.

A single Scarlet Dragon Grand Dao Vein would take a Dao Venerable countless years to refine. However, Huang Xiaolong said that he had refined six of them in the span of several dozen years!

Of course, none of them would ever know that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t done it in several years, but he had taken merely several short days to devour the spiritual veins. He was afraid they would kill themselves in fright when they learned of the fact.

“What’s the situation out there now?” Huang Xiaolong asked. He no longer wanted to speak of his breakthrough, and he quickly changed the topic.

Since the time he had brought away the Immemorial Immortal Cave, the outside world was flipped over by several experts trying to locate him.

Indeed, Fu Daosheng and the others quickly made their reports.

From everything he summarized, Huang Xiaolong realized that he could describe the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave with a single word, ‘chaotic’. The entire region was basically in tatters trying to locate him. Not a single person had given up on their search, and when they had failed to locate him in the initial years, they had increased the intensity of their search.

“It’s especially so for Xu Dong of the Saint Devil Sacred Land. He sent out a notice saying that he wanted to locate you no matter the cost. According to him, you’ll die a miserable death if he manages to capture you. The bounty on your head has already risen to an unprecedented level! One can obtain ten trillion dao coins if they report any news on you!” Zhou Hong reported.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled in response, “To think that the Saint Devil Sacred Land will be willing to take out ten trillion dao coins for a piece of news!”

Ten trillion! That was a sum no one could scoff at.

Even several super sacred lands wouldn’t be able to bring out that amount even after selling the underpants on their disciples’ body! However, Huang Xiaolong knew that the reason they were being so generous was because of the immemorial treasury.

He then asked about the situation in the surrounding regions.

Without a doubt, the Blue Heaven Creed was also looking for him with everything they had. An uncountable number of experts had arrived in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave trying to search for him.

Cangqiong Old Man laughed when he thought about it. “Right now, the Blue Heaven Creed has ordered all the experts under them to look for you! Disciples were called out from seclusion to take a stroll around the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.”

Huang Xiaolong burst into laughter when he thought about it. “Seems like my reputation has already surpassed Xu Dong! Hahaha!”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of the search and capture operation spearheaded by the Blue Heaven Creed in the slightest. With his current strength, he didn’t fear someone at Yi Beihang’s level!

Of course, that didn’t mean that he wanted to emerge from seclusion. Huang Xiaolong planned to refine the Immemorial Sword to the best of his abilities and push his strength to the next level with all the treasures in the treasury.

According to his estimations, he would be able to enter the Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm after using all the grand dao pills he could find.
