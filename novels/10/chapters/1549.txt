Looking at the ball of purple dragon rain floating above his hand, Huang Xiaolong was even more certain that within this mountain, there was a source of purple grandmist aura!

In the next moment, Huang Xiaolong fell into a dilemma. Since it was certain now that there were both grandmist aura and purple grandmist aura somewhere within this peak, then who was going to take the grandmist aura, and who was going to take the purple grandmist aura?

He and his Senior Brother both cultivated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium, thus both of them wanted and required grandmist aura and purple grandmist aura.

“Senior Brother, the grandmist aura and purple grandmist aura, how are we...?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Jiang Hong, asking for his opinion.

Jiang Hong laughed watching Huang Xiaolong’s embarrassed expression and said, “Junior Brother is thinking how to divine the grandmist aura and who takes the purple grandmist aura? Junior Brother doesn’t have to worry about this matter. The purple grandmist aura goes to Junior Brother, and I’ll take the grandmist aura, how is that?”

Huang Xiaolong was stunned, that...!

Jiang Hong smiled as he went on, “In truth, Junior Brother need not feel troubled, or you have taken advantage of me. Even if you give me the purple grandmist aura, I won’t be able to refine it.”

“Won’t be able to refine it?” Huang Xiaolong was stupefied. Why not?

“That’s right, the purple grandmist aura is not something anyone could refine. In the vast universe, as far as I know it, only you, Junior Brother, have refined it.” Jiang Hong added, “Junior Brother will understand in the future.”

“Kiddo Grandmist is right, Little Brat Huang, don’t refuse. Even if you offer the purple grandmist aura on a silver platter to him, Kiddo Grandmist won’t be able to refine it anyways, nor could Old Man Grandmist. I couldn’t refine it either.” The little cow interjected. “So, your true identity is not so simple.” She went on half-jokingly, “Who knows, maybe you’re really the reincarnation of a peerless grandmist god or something.”

Huang Xiaolong gave the little cow a fierce glare, then looked at Jiang Hong, “In that case, we’ll do as Senior Brother said.”

Jiang Hong smiled, “In fact, if we have to calculate, I could be considered as the one taking advantage of you Junior Brother. If it’s not for Junior Brother, I won’t have had this chance to get the grandmist aura.”

Jiang Hong was not being perfunctory. If it wasn’t for Huang Xiaolong, it would have been difficult for him to find this space.

“Enough of talking, quickly go in to search for the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura, then let’s get out of this space.” The little cow was disgruntled, “The longer I’m in this space, the less I want to stay.”

Huang Xiaolong was rendered speechless.

Do we need you to say this? Which of us doesn’t want to get out of here as soon as possible?

“But, Senior Azure Cow, even if we find the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura, with my strength, it won’t be easy for us to pass through the Land of Lightning Penalty.” said Jiang Hong.

The little cow’s face split into a wide grin, “You would have a hard time crossing the Land of Lightning Penalty, but Little Brat Huang can probably do it.”

Jiang Hong was genuinely surprised by her words. “Junior Brother?” He looked at Huang Xiaolong. Even him, as someone who had surpassed the Emperor Realm, had no confidence to cross the Land of Lightning Penalty, but Junior Brother, a God King Realm, could?

Even though he admitted that Huang Xiaolong’s talent was amazing, crossing the Land of Lightning Penalty was not based on talent, but on strength.

It was Huang Xiaolong who faintly guessed what the little cow meant.

“You’ll know when the time comes.” The little cow acted mysterious, seeing the doubt on Jiang Hong’s face.

Jiang Hong smiled, “Since Senior Azure Cow says so, I shall be relying on Junior Brother then.”

However, just as Huang Xiaolong’s group was about to enter the purple mountain to look for the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura, Jiang Hong’s footsteps halted and he looked in a certain direction.

While the others felt strange, Jiang Hong explained, “The Barbarians’ experts have arrived, their actions are quite fast.”

Moments later, the others also sensed hundreds of powerful auras flying towards them speedily.

Judging from the five Barbarians tribe’s Head Chieftains’ momentum, who were right at the head of the group, it was probably stronger than Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel. Huang Xiaolong identified them right away, as the Barbarians five Head Chieftains.

But Huang Xiaolong hadn’t actually expected for the five Head Chieftains to join hands against them.

Seconds later, Huang Xiaolong’s group also saw hundreds of Barbarians’ experts arriving with the sounds of whistling wind.

This time, almost all of the Barbarians’ elite experts had come out to the Dragon Rain Mountains.

One of the experts behind the Head Chieftain Lei Budong, Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, and Guang Wenfang was Chieftain Feng Shili who was previously injured by Xiang Xun and Chaos Black Camel.

Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the rest of their group had already spotted Huang Xiaolong’s side who was about to enter the purple peak, and their faces tightened anxiously.

This purple mountain peak was their Barbarians’ Dragon Rain Sacred Peak.

The generations of Barbarians tribes had one ironclad ancestral rule that no one was allowed to approach the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak. Fury and killing intent soared in Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and others’ hearts.

These outsiders dared to stain their Dragon Rain Sacred Peak, this was unforgivable sin!

Die!

Die a million deaths!

Ribbons of lightning crackled around Lei Budong’s body as he stepped towards Huang Xiaolong’s group with Feng Chen, Shui Luosheng, Huo Haibo, Guang Wenfang, and the others following behind him.

Lei Budong stood with his hands clasped behind his back roughly ten meters from Huang Xiaolong’s group, absolutely in no hurry to attack. He stared coldly at Huang Xiaolong while saying, “Punk, you’ve got some guts, since you have actually dared to think of entering our Dragon Rain Sacred Peak. This Dragon Rain Sacred Peak is our Barbarians tribe’s sacred peak, and anyone who dares to take one step inside will be killed without mercy! So tell me, how do you want to die!”

Feng Chen too was staring at Huang Xiaolong with an icy glare. “A mere few outsiders actually have the guts to injure our Barbarian Chieftain. This kind of matter has never happened in the past. Do you think you can act arrogantly relying on two early First Order Emperor Realm demonic beasts!”

The Barbaric Fire Head Chieftain Huo Haibo’s sonorous voice rang, “What’s the use of saying so much to them, tie them up then punish according to our Barbarians tribe’s rules, end of the matter.”

Guang Wenfang stated, “I’ll do it!”

“Wenfang and I are enough to deal with them.” The Barbaric Water Settlement’s Head Chieftain Shui Luosheng quickly added. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Lei Budong shook his head, “Although these two demonic beasts’ strengths are at the peak of late-First Order Emperor Realm, their actual strengths are comparable to peak mid-Second Order Emperor Realm.”

Lei Budong’s words shocked Guang Wenfang and Shui Luosheng.

Feng Chen nodded in affirmation to Lei Budong’s words. “These two demonic beasts are quite strong, so better let me and Brother Huo Haibo deal with them.” Finished saying that, his momentum soared and violent tempests formed around him, covering the heavens.

On the other hand, a bright, fiery light burst out from Huo Haibo’s body, turning into various divine beasts around him. In an instant, the surrounding temperature rose sharply as if they had been thrown into a furnace.

Feng Chen and Huo Haibo both locked onto Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel by Huang Xiaolong’s side.

Feng Chen was a late-Third Order Emperor Realm, and even though Huo Haibo was slightly weaker, he was still a peak late-Second Order Emperor Realm master. Targeted by Feng Chen and Huo Haibo, Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel felt a big pressure squeezing them from every direction.

Feng Chen and Huo Haibo leaped forward at the same time. Their bellows rumbled like thunder from the ninth heavens, as they slapped down their palms on Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel.

The Barbarians tribe’s five Head Chieftains had been acquaintances for several billion years, thus had tacit understanding.

Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel were prepared to retaliate but stopped when they saw Jiang Hong shake his head. Though Xiang Xun and the Chaos Black Camel were strong, their strengths were still slightly weaker compared to Feng Chen and Huo Haibo. So, the matter fell onto Jiang Hong’s shoulders.
