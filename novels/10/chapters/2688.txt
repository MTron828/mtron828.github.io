Chapter 2689: Choice

“Main ingredient?” Huang Xiaolong looked at Long Jianfei, and they both started laughing. By turning to look at Elder Ming and Yuan Qianxing, Huang Xiaolong explained, “I was also planning to make a grand dao pill. Here I was planning to find several Primal Ancestors to become my ingredients…”

In the Holy World, Alien Lands, and the World River, there was no recorded method to refine a grand dao pill! However, Long Jianfei was someone from the Divine Tuo Holy World! As someone from the Dragon Fish Creed, he knew how to refine one!

No… He knew more than one method to refine a grand dao pill!

Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, and the others were shocked at Huang Xiaolong's revelation.

However, Elder Ming snickered in amusement, “Brat, it seems like you managed to become a little stronger after crawling out of the Death Cave.” With his gaze landing on Long Jianfei, Elder Ming continued, “What did Huang Xiaolong give you for you to be willing to die along with him? Even Mo Zhi had to escape with his tail tucked between his legs. I’ll give you a piece of advice. Leave Huang Xiaolong or you’ll meet your sorry end!”

Pushing the restrictions in his Magic Pagoda, powerful beams of energy shot towards Long Shengtian as miserable screams rang in the hall.

A cold light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he reached out to summon the Cangqiong Dao Palace. As the platform appeared once again, Mo Jincheng appeared.

“Mo Jincheng!”

Yuan Qianxing and the others were shocked once again. No one would have thought that Mo Jincheng of the Eight Claw Devil Eye Race would fall into Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

“It was you!” Yuan Qianxing glared at Huang Xiaolong. “You destroyed the Devil Eye City with Long Jianfei’s help!”

They turned their attention to Long Jianfei as they felt that it was impossible for Huang Xiaolong to take on the Devil Eye City by himself. After all, they were protected by their grand formation, and no matter how strong Huang Xiaolong could have become after his time in the Death Cave, he wouldn’t be able to fight Mo Jincheng head-on!

It went without saying that the Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor, Long Jianfei, was someone with extraordinary strength.

That would be the only reason Mo Jincheng would be captured by Huang Xiaolong.

Ignoring their misunderstanding, Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to explain himself. Instead, he activated the restrictions in the Cangqiong Dao Palace and a wretched cry escaped Mo Jincheng’s lips. His cries seemed a little worse than Long Shengtian who was trapped in Elder Ming’s Magic Pagoda.

“Elder Ming, save me!” Mo Jincheng yelled.

Upon sweeping his gaze across the hall, Huang Xiaolong sneered, “This is a personal grudge between me and Yuan Qianxing’s party. I hope that none of you will interfere in our matters, otherwise, you’ll end up worse than him!”

Other than Yuan Qianxing, Yuan Wanfei, Chan Yuli, Yao Chengxin, and Elder Ming, there were twenty other Primal Ancestors in the hall. Since they bore no grudge with Huang Xiaolong, it would be best if they left them alone.

He would be able to save a ton of effort if they remained quietly at the side.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong was showing them Mo Jincheng’s end in order to put some psychological pressure on them.

Despite his ‘warnings’, there were several Primal Ancestors who felt that Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a joke. A red-haired expert sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re overestimating yourself. You’re just a mere True Saint. In my eyes, you’re nothing more than an ant! Release Mo Jincheng right now and kneel before Elder Ming to beg for mercy. If you do that, Elder Ming might just spare your life!”

The red-haired elder was Teng Xiao of the Teng Yi Race.

Even though the Teng Yi race was one of the royal families, they were ranked at the bottom of the royal families. The person who had spoken, Teng Xiao, was also one of the weakest individuals in the hall at the early-First Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm.

He had always wanted to suck up to the Myriad Origin Race, and now that there was an opportunity, he jumped out at the first chance he had!

Of course, he had weighed his options carefully. With Huang Xiaolong’s strength at the True Saint Realm and the fact that Elder Ming and the others had managed to force him into the Death Cave previously, he was confident that he was standing on the right side.

“Brother Teng Xiao is right. Huang Xiaolong, hand Mo Jincheng over to us right now! Otherwise, you’ll die without a complete corpse if Elder Ming makes his move!” someone else snorted.

The person who had spoken was the ancestor of the Suoluo Race, Jiang Heng!

Previously in the ancient battlefield, Huang Xiaolong had subdued the young master of the Suoluo Race and Jiang Heng was their ancestor!

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ve heard that Shaohuang took you in as a brother. However, your relationship ends now!” Jiang Heng snorted. “From this point on, the members of my race will have nothing to do with you!”

Jiang Heng had also made his choice. He had decided to stand on Elder Ming and Yuan Qianxing’s side.

Since he had already made up his mind, there was no point keeping the relationships he had with Huang Xiaolong.

With a placid expression, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the others.

“It seems like everyone thinks the same way…,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

“Hahaha! Are you surprised by our answer?” someone else sneered at Huang Xiaolong. “Elder Ming is an unbeatable legend! Yuan Qianxing is the current Mansion Master of the Otherworldly Mansion, and your saint godheads and Saint Fates won’t be able to make a difference!”

“You’re crazy if you think that you can save Long Shengtian!”

The last person who spoke wasn’t a Primal Ancestor from the royal families. Instead, he was someone who had remained in seclusion for a long time, and his name was Guo Chen. He wasn’t too weak when compared to those present. He was at the peak late-Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm.

Even though the other Primal Ancestors didn’t reply, it was clear that they had made their decision.

Turning to Long Jianfei, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Ensure that no one manages to escape.” Since there were too many people present, Huang Xiaolong needed someone to stop those who tried to run.

“Yes, Young Lord!” Long Jianfei didn’t hesitate to acknowledge the order.

When the rest heard his reply, they were stunned.

“Huang Xiaolong, are you planning to take on everyone here by yourself?!” Yuan Qianxing couldn’t control his laughter when he realized Huang Xiaolong’s intentions.

“A bunch of weaklings… I do not require assistance to deal with people like you.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What?!” When they heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed them, those who had remained silent could no longer sit still.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re too arrogant! Elder Ming doesn’t even need to make a move to take you down! I alone, am enough!” Guo Chen roared as he charged towards Huang Xiaolong.

“If you can take this punch from me, you can be my ancestor!”

As waves of energy rolled off his fists, his grand dao energy surged towards Huang Xiaolong.

There was a type of tyrannical killing intent concealed behind his strike, and when he made his move, it was as though battle-thirsty spirits swam through the rivers of time to carry out his commands!

Seeing as Guo Chen’s fist was about to arrive, Huang Xiaolong reached out and stretched his fingers. When he opened his palm, it was as though every creature under the heavens fell under his command.

The fist containing Guo Chen’s killing intent was trapped between Huang Xiaolong’s fingers.
