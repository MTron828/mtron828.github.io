Chapter 3645 – Lord Gui Chi’s Rage

The faces of Cao Dehong and the others also changed greatly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Anyone with any bit of knowledge in the auction venue revealed a terrified expression. There were even some who got to their knees instantly! Among them were Gods of Creation at the great completion stage and the peak of the great completion stage.

That was how famous Gui Chi was!

Of course, he had long been noticed by Huang Xiaolong. Even at his level, he wasn’t able to avoid detection from Huang Xiaolong’s three great dao souls.

In the Unknown Space, the Ferocious Devil, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen stood at the very peak! Their strength were ranked in that exact order, and Gui Chi was the Green Ghost’s strongest general!

The Green Ghost had been in seclusion for countless years, and Gui Chi was the one taking care of everything. Seeing him was equivalent to meeting Lord Green Ghost!

Of course, Gui Chi possessed horrifying strength to back up his identity. His combat strength was close to 19 billion units of grand cosmos energy and he was one of the ten strongest individuals in the Unknown Lands!

After getting over their shock, Zhu Jian, Jian Bifei, and the others bowed. Even though he was Zhu Chen’s grandson, he had to show the man some respect.

The only person who remained seated other than Gui Chi was Huang Xiaolong.

Cao Dehong and the others were afraid of Gui Chi’s identity, but they didn’t dare to bow when they saw that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t moving.

His action, or lack thereof, became the most eye-catching thing in the auction venue!

When Zhu Jian and the others saw Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalance, they celebrated in their hearts. They were obviously waiting for Gui Chi to fly into rage and kill Huang Xiaolong with a single slap.

Gui Chi looked at Huang Xiaolong casually, but he refrained from doing anything. Instead, he turned to the auctioneer and said, “If no one else bids, I’ll be taking the batch of spiritual veins.”

The auctioneer nodded obediently. “Of course. According to the rules of our chamber of commerce, the goods will go to the highest bidder.”

After he revealed his identity, no fool would dare to challenge him.

Of course, those fools only referred to the weaklings who were weaker than himself.

“Eleven high-grade creation artifacts.”

When everyone turned to stare in the direction of the newest bid, they were shocked to discover that Cao Dehong was the one who called it!

He wasn’t in a great position either. Cao Dehong’s heart palpitated after calling the bid. It was clear that he only did what he did because of Huang Xiaolong’s order.

Gui Chi finally took a closer look at Huang Xiaolong’s pavilion. His gaze caused Cao Dehong and the others to feel their scalps going numb.

“Twelve.” Gui Chi stared directly at Cao Dehong as he made another bid.

“Thirteen.” Cao Dehong continued.

“Fourteen.” With his face remaining expressionless, no one could tell what he was thinking.

“Fifteen pieces.” There was no going back for Cao Dehong. He could only go all in. He swore that he had never felt so afraid in his life.

“Sixteen!” Gui Chi growled and his change in tone was clear to everyone.

Cao Dehong looked at Huang Xiaolong and received no response. He could only continue. “Seventeen…”

Gui Chi frowned and his gaze arrived on Huang Xiaolong. “Brat, I might admire your courage, but that doesn’t mean that I like it when other people go against me intentionally.”

Everyone could see that Cao Dehong was only acting on Huang Xiaolong’s orders.

Looking at Gui Chi from the corner of his eye, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “What a coincidence. I hate it when people go against me too.”

Gui Chi was stunned, and so was everyone else.

Were they mistaken?! Did Huang Xiaolong just declare war on Gui Chi?

A piercing laughter left Gui Chi’s lips.

Zhu Yun celebrated in his heart. He whispered to Zhu Jian, “The brat is done for now… Lord Gui Chi is completely enraged! That’s the only time he will laugh!”

“Brat, I don’t know where you’re finding the courage to go against me.” Gui Chi roared with laughter, “Haven’t those ants beside you told you who I am?”

Naturally, he referred to Cao Dehong and the rest.

No one in the crowd thought that there was a problem with how he referred to them.

Huang Xiaolong sighed softly, “Looks like you’re overestimating yourself. I can do whatever I like.”

?!

Gui Chi looked at Huang Xiaolong from head to toe again. He felt that Huang Xiaolong was the greatest clown he had met. How else was he supposed to explain the kid’s death wish of going against him?

He could tell that Huang Xiaolong was nothing more than a God of Creation at the grand completion stage.

The only thing he found weird was that Cao Dehong and the others were treating him with respect. From the looks of it, the kid wasn’t an ordinary expert at the grand completion stage.

When everyone thought that Gui Chi would make a move on Huang Xiaolong, he remained silent.

After some time, the auctioneer mustered the courage to break the silence. “Lord Cao Dehong bids seventeen high-grade creation artifacts. Are there any higher bids?”

The gazes of everyone present landed on Gui Chi.

He didn’t seem to notice the looks he was getting and he continued to look at Huang Xiaolong.

Zhu Jian and the others hesitated slightly, but Zhu Yun shot Zhu Jian a look and the latter lowered his head. He could only give up.

After tapping his hammer thrice, the auctioneer proclaimed that Huang Xiaolong was the winner of the auction.

At that point, the auction ended.

“Lord Huang, the auction has ended. Are you going to leave the city?” Han Tao’er asked reluctantly.

Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Relax. I’ll head over to your Jian Family for the ceremony. Tao Hang will be there too.”

Tao Han’er was stunned for a second, and so were Jian Bifei, Zhu Jian, and the others.

“Really?!” Tao Han’er beamed. “Great! I’ll be waiting for you!”

Huang Xiaolong smiled before leaving the venue with Cao Dehong and the others.

When Jian Bifei saw Huang Xiaolong’s leaving figure, a sneer left his lips. He couldn’t be happier if Huang Xiaolong came for the Jian Family’s ceremony.

A light flashed in Zhu Jian’s eyes. He made up his mind to do something at the ceremony, but when he looked at the corner where Gui Chi was, he noticed that the expert had already disappeared.
