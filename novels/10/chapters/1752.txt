When Sun Shihai was dragged before Huang Xiaolong, he could no longer hide the look of fear in his eyes. Especially when he looked at the four odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong, his legs turned soft, and his body trembled uncontrollably. He flailed around helplessly, hoping for a miracle to happen.

He had witnessed the four odd beasts killing the men in black and Zhou Chen earlier. He was already shocked out of his wits and had long forgotten about his unwillingness and hatred for Huang Xiaolong.

“Huang... Huang Xiaolong, no, no, no... Senior Huang, please forgive me. I won’t dare to do it again! I won’t fight for Peng Xiao with you; she’s all yours! You’re the only man suitable for her. I’m nothing but a toad lusting over a swan. Like you, I’m not a human; just treat me like a piece of turd on the ground and let me live! Please spare my life!” Sun Shihai cried and begged for mercy.

When Peng Xiao, who was standing at the side, heard what he said, she became both shy and furious. She tilted her head a little to the side to glance at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of her eye.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Sun Shihai with a face of indifference. He knew that Sun Shihai wasn’t pretending to be scared as he could feel the boundless fear in Sun Shihai’s heart. The scene had scared the soul out of his body.

However...

“Senior Huang?” Huang Xiaolong said casually, “Sun Shihai, what are you trying to imply? Do I look that old to you?”

Sun Shihai was dumbfounded as he corrected himself in haste, “No, no, it’s Young Hero Huang! Young Hero Huang! I’m stupid. I’m dumb. I must have been confused for a moment there!”

Looking at the comical Sun Shihai, who was panicking, Peng Xiao released the hatred in her heart and laughed out loud all of a sudden.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned when he looked at Peng Xiao’s tomato-like face.

Since he didn’t want to waste any more time with Sun Shihai, he forcefully searched through Sun Shihai’s soul if he found anything useful.

Huang Xiaolong finished searching his soul very soon.

However, he had gained nothing useful from Sun Shihai’s memory.

He then circulated the devouring energy inside his Archdevil Supreme Godhead and absorbed all the godforce and blood essence from Sun Shihai’s body.

In several breaths of time, Sun Shihai’s body was sucked dry.

Sun Shihai’s eyes were wide open, and his face was full of unwillingness, disbelief, hatred, and regret.

Huang Xiaolong effortlessly threw the corpse to the side.

Li Shan and Chen Yirong’s expressions changed drastically.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and thought about it for a moment before deciding against devouring everyone present. He circulated the darkness energy inside his Heart of Hell before pointing towards Zhou Chen’s glabella. The darkness energy corroded Zhou Chen’s entire body at an astonishing speed, starting from his forehead.

Zhou Chen’s body was corroded continuously by the darkness energy, and the pain he felt was beyond imagination. He screamed as he rolled about on the ground.

Even though Special Envoy He and Special Envoy Chen had a firm heart, their expressions changed drastically when they saw Zhou Chen screaming and thrashing around.

Huang Xiaolong repeated his actions and pointed at both the special envoys. Soon, the two of them were twitching and shrieking on the ground.

Throughout the ordeal, Huang Xiaolong wore an expression of indifference.

After he had broken through to the high-level Heavenly Monarch Realm and awakened the three types of Archdevil bloodline inside him, he could only devour the body of experts who had an Archdevil bloodline. That was also the reason why he killed Zhou Chen and the others instead of devouring them.

Even though Zhou Chen and the rest were high-level Emperor Realm experts, their bloodline was too diluted. If he devoured them, his bloodline would suffer from the aftereffects.

Very soon, the screaming and rolling stopped. When everyone turned to look, they could only see shallow pools of black mist in place of the three Emperor Realm Experts.

Huang Xiaolong looked Li Shan and Chen Yirong in the distance and said, “The two of you come over here.”

Li Shan and Chen Yirong felt as though a thunderbolt had struck their minds, and they scampered towards Huang Xiaolong in a hurry. They stared at him with a look of unconcealed fear in their eyes.

“If you want to live, get your ass here now!” Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flashed with a trace of coldness as he snapped.

Li Shan and Chen Yirong turned stiff, and their expressions changed. They moved even faster and appeared before Huang Xiaolong in a flash.

“Huang...Young Hero Huang.” The two of them said in a weak voice.

He found it pretty hilarious hearing the two of them calling him Young Hero Huang.

“Xiaolong, my master must have been confused for a moment... is it possible for you to let him off?” Peng Xiao gritted her teeth and pleaded as she arrived beside Huang Xiaolong.

When Li Shan heard what Peng Xiao said, a wave of guilt assaulted him.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head to Peng Xiao and gave her a reassuring look. He then turned towards Li Shan and Chen Yirong and said, “I will let you off if you make an oath to the heavens and swear that you will never betray the Fortune Emperor Palace again. Also, nothing that happened here today is to spread.”

When the two heard Huang Xiaolong’s order, they swore an oath without a second thought.

“We will always be loyal to the Fortune Emperor Palace and never betray the sect. We also promise not to disclose anything that happened here today.”

After the two of them swore an oath, Huang Xiaolong ordered them to clean up the scene before making all the disciples swear the same oath.

The two of them acknowledged Huang Xiaolong’s orders and left in a hurry.

After settling everything, Huang Xiaolong brought the two ladies to the prison to release everyone related to him.

Of course, the four odd beasts followed behind Huang Xiaolong. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

On the way, Huang Xiaolong explained about Fang Gan’s situation to Fang Xuanxuan.

Fang Xuanxuan couldn’t help but feel sad when she found out that her father’s whereabouts were unknown.

“Xuanxuan, don’t worry too much, Uncle Fang is definitely in the Divine World. I should be able to find him soon.” Huang Xiaolong tried his best to comfort her.

Fang Xuanxuan smiled and looked at Huang Xiaolong, “Xiaolong, thanks for your help. Also, I have yet to thank you for looking for my elder brother...”

“It’s a small matter. You don’t have to thank me.”

All of a sudden, Peng Xiao blinked playfully and teased, "Xuanxuan, if you really want to thank Xiaolong, how about repaying him with your body?”

Huang Xiaolong was startled.

Fang Xuanxuan blushed and muttered in a low voice, “You lass! Why aren’t you the one repaying Xiaolong with your body? Didn’t he save you previously?!”

Huang Xiaolong broke out in cold sweat as he did not dare to make eye contact with either one of them.

The two ladies continued bickering back and forth on their way. Fortunately, the prison wasn’t very far away. When the disciples guarding the prison tried to stop them, Huang Xiaolong sent them flying with a flick of his wrist.

Throughout their journey, no one dared to stop them. They saved Fang Mingyu on the first floor of the prison first. Even though Fang Mingyu was imprisoned on the first level, he hadn’t suffered any hardships. After Fang Xuanxuan’s quick explanation, he realized that the man in front of him was Huang Xiaolong, his benefactor.

After reminiscing for a short while, they continued on their way and soon arrived at the prison’s lowest level.
