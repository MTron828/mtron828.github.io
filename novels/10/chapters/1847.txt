The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate stopped spinning suddenly, and the wheel started to crack.

“CRACK!” The sound of his shattering attack echoed through the sky.

Along with the explosion of the Absolute Yin Yang Wheel, the old ancestor’s figure appeared before everyone. There was a look of absolute shock on his skinny face.

The black light on the four massive arms grew brighter, and a miserable shriek from the Absolute Devil Gate’s old ancestor resounded through the lands. He shot outwards, and he smashed into some random corner of Eternal Devil City.

The cries of all the cultivators who had dared to move against Huang Xiaolong rang out simultaneously. They were sent flying as well.

The weaker ones turned into a mist of blood on the spot.

Along with the rain of experts from the sky, explosions repeatedly sounded on the ground below them.

Countless structures collapsed, and many of them turned into dust.

The eight arms that stretched out from Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard seemed to disappear in an instant they sent everyone flying.

The heavens and earth seemed to turn quiet instantly.

The experts who were waiting around Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard felt the air getting stuck in their throats. None of them dared to breathe, and their bodies stiffened. Those who had decided to make their moves after the Absolute Devil Gate’s old ancestor felt their bodies shaking like a leaf in the wind.

While everything was happening, the radiance around the Yellow Springs Magic Robe didn’t dissipate. Instead, it glowed even brighter.

With the boost from the Devil Holy Water, the Yellow Springs Magic Robe seemed to be filled with endless vitality as though it was reborn from the ashes.

By the time the ninth drop landed on it, a buzzing sound came from the Yellow Springs Magic Robe. The radiance pierced through the heavens, and the ax-wielding devil became lively again. It broke free of the constraints of the robe and appeared on its surface.

The cracks on the Yellow Spring Devil Robe disappeared, and devilish light spread throughout the entire piece.

A satisfied smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. The Yellow Springs Magic Robe is finally fixed!

For the past few hundred years, Huang Xiaolong had been trying means and ways to fix it. He had finally managed to check it off his checklist.

Waving both his hands around, the Yellow Springs Magic Robe turned into a length of red cloth as it swirled around him. It was like a lively and naughty kid.

The ax-wielding demon also returned to the robe, and the glow around it started to fade.

When the robe finally landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body, the runes hid themselves, and the devil’s figure shrunk into a tiny black dot. On the surface, no one would be able to notice that it was the Yellow Springs Magic Robe!

Perhaps, only the Yellow Springs Archdevil Ancestor himself would be able to recognize it. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t the least bit afraid that anyone would be able to tell.

After restoring the Yellow Springs Magic Robe to its peak state, Huang Xiaolong calmly probed his surroundings. A sneer appeared on his face. With what had happened to the Absolute Devil Gate’s old ancestor, he was sure no one would dare to make a move against him anytime soon.

He took out the Devil Gourd next, and he held it before him.

There were countless lines and marks on the gourd, and they covered the entire item.

The Devil Gourd was something he had bought when he had purchased the Scarlet Flame Dark Qilin. It was a high-grade grandmist artifact.

However, due to the crack on the mouth of the gourd, Huang Xiaolong had managed to obtain it for the low price of fifteen million low-grade chaos spirit stones.

All these years, Huang Xiaolong had tried many methods to patch up the crack, but he had never managed to do so. Since he had so much Devil Holy Water left, he planned to see if it would be of assistance. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Devil Gourd had a great history. One of the most potent poisons in the Devil World, the Black Burial Water, was inside it.

The Black Burial Water was capable of corroding all existences in the Devil Races and members of the Devil Beasts. Any living being that absorbed devil qi wouldn’t be able to resist its corrosive abilities.

Just when Huang Xiaolong was about to use the Devil Holy Water to repair the Devil Gourd, the news about the outcomes of recent attacks on Huang Xiaolong spread throughout the Eternal Devil City. Everyone knew how the Absolute Devil Gate’s old ancestor and the other experts were sent flying by the eight massive arms.

Eternal Devil City quaked once again.

“What?! Even the old ancestor from the Absolute Devil Gate suffered a serious injury from a single attack?”

“Some of the ancestors were smashed into flying chunks of meat on the spot?! How is that possible?”

When Chen Weijian heard the report from the Hundred Transformation Gate’s ancestors, he felt as though he had braved through countless winds and charged through endless storms. His expression changed, and he leaped to his feet.

The various ancestors who heard the report also felt their hearts tightening.

The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate was one of the powerhouses in the Devil World! His strength was comparable to the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, but even someone like him had become seriously injured from a single attack!

“Yes, The old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate circulated his Absolute Yin Yang Wheel and tried to kill the black-haired young man for the Devil Holy Water and his treasures. He had never expected eight massive arms to pop out of nowhere. Four of them stopped him, and another four sent the rest of the experts flying.”

“With a single slap, the ancestors of the Absolute Devil Gate were sent flying, and the weaker ones exploded into a mist of blood right there and then.”

The disciples who had witnessed the scene spilled everything without concealing the facts.

Chen Weijian’s expression became extremely colorful as different emotions filled his heart.

“Eight massive arms meant four of them...” Elder Long’s thoughts returned to the four odd beasts serving Huang Xiaolong.

“Young master... what do you think we should do?” Elder Long asked.

Chen Weijian sucked in a cold breath and hesitated. “We’ll wait for Senior Heavenly Punishment to arrive before doing anything,”

Everyone present fell silent.

Even the Stone Ape Archdevil Ancestor, Violent Lightning Archdevil Ancestor, Black Killer Sect, Black Killer Archdevil Ancestor, and other superpowers didn’t dare to say a word when the Absolute Devil Gate was wiped out.

A single drop of Devil Holy Water landed on the crack of the Devil Gourd in the courtyard, and radiance bloomed around it. To Huang Xiaolong’s shock, the crack managed to close, albeit a tiny bit. Even though the repair was unnoticeable from afar, the effects were there.

Huang Xiaolong hastily dripped another drop on it, and radiance seeped into the crack. Resplendent light shimmered around the mouth of the gourd as the crack closed once again.

Then came the third, fourth, and fifth... drop.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t hesitate as he used drop after drop of the Devil Holy Water.

The crack on the mouth of the gourd became smaller and smaller.

When the twenty-sixth drop landed on the gourd, the crack was finally restored. Brilliant rays of light pierced through the sky, and it was at least three times stronger than when he had fixed the Yellow Springs Magic Robe.

Some experts who hadn’t left the area sucked in a cold breath when they saw the second coming of the light in the sky.

“This... Is this a high-grade grandmist artifact?!”

“How many d*mn treasures does he have?!”

Several ancestors felt their mouth go dry, and the fervent look in their eyes grew brighter. However, none of them dared to make a move if they became the next old ancestor of the Absolute Devil Gate. They knew that no matter how strong they seemed, they were way weaker than the group from the Absolute Devil Gate.

In the small courtyard, Huang Xiaolong’s palm rubbed against the Devil Gourd, and he looked at the swirling patterns on it. A smile appeared on his face. The Silver Devil Sect and Chu Han should be arriving soon... I’ll probably be able to test the might of this Devil Gourd soon.
