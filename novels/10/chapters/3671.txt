Chapter 3672 – Lord Nether Yang King?!

They didn’t mistake it. The universe around them did indeed turn upside down.

With Huang Xiaolong’s grand cosmos energy infinitely close to the 27 billion units mark, he had the power the reverse time, much less do something like that.

Huang Xiaolong’s strength had long exceeded their scope of understanding.

Bing Yu, who failed to keep his footing, felt the boundless heaven and earth qi in the surrounding charging towards him. The universe seemed to want to expunge his presence.

He tried to struggle and scream while circulating his grand cosmos energy frantically. To his horror, he discovered that his grand cosmos energy was frozen completely! Fear emerged from the depths of his heart.

Boom!

He felt his body trembling violently. A frightening power surged into his body and his body shattered from the inside out!

Bang!

He heard the rushing of water in his ears, and the next thing he knew, he felt like he was sinking.

Pain shot through his body and he felt like something was biting him.

Blinking his eyes, he returned to reality. He saw countless yin spirits around him and tried to yell. However, no sound came out of his lips.

On the riverbank, the Nether Yang King and the rest stared at Bing Yu in horror.

There were half-step Universe Gods who had fallen into the river, but never since the start of existence was there an expert who broke through the 10 billion units barrier who fell in!

Especially so for Bing Yu who had crossed the 16 billion units mark!

When everyone saw the yin spirits gnawing on Bing Yu and his subordinates, a chill filled their bodies.

The Nether Yang King felt his emotions fluctuating as he stood at the riverbank. He was clearly considering if he should try to save Bing Yu. The yin spirits were terrifying, but with his strength, it was possible for him to try!

Wu Zun and Jiu Yu stared on in silence.

Huang Xiaolong turned around and ignored the flailing experts in the water and their cries of help. In the blink of an eye, the Supreme Ghost King Ship disappeared into the horizon.

After they left, the Nether Yang King made his move. He tried to save Bing Yu from the river, but a strong backlash forced him back to shore.

That was the power contained in the Yin Ghost River!

No matter who it was, the strength in their body would start to fade once they fell into the river. They wouldn’t be able to pull them back to shore. That was why the Yin Ghost River was so feared! Anyone who tried to save those who fell in would face a terrifying backlash.

“The three of us joining hands should be able to save him!” The Nether Yang King said to Wu Zun and Jiu Yu.

The two of them nodded quickly.

Even though they joined hands, they were forced back by the mysterious strength contained in the river. After expanding a huge effort, they dragged him out of the river after taking on the enormous backlash. They looked at Bing Yu and saw that his body was starting to resemble a wrangled mess. Not a single spot was intact and the wounds were so deep they could see his bones!

They sucked in a cold breath.

With their level of cultivation, they could see that the meridians on Bing Yu’s body had been completely devoured!

The meridians of an existence at Bing Yu’s level were extremely sturdy. Not even peak-grade creation artifacts could damage them! Now, every single strand was in shambles!

Did it happen when the brat attacked him earlier?

“Senior Bing Yu, are you alright?!” Wu Zun asked. His grand cosmos energy poured into Bing Yu’s body and tried to restore his meridians.

How could it be so easy to restore the meridians of an expert at the level of Bing Yu?

However, the color returned to Bing Yu’s face with their help. The gaping wounds on his body slowly closed up.

Once they were bitten by the yin spirits in the river, a mysterious yin spirit energy would spread all around and start to corrode the expert’s body. If Bing Yu failed to expel all the yin spirit energy, he wouldn’t be able to fully recover.

Crawling to his feet, his face twisted with anger as he stared in the direction of Huang Xiaolong’s Supreme Ghost King Ship.

Killing intent filled his eyes.

“Senior Bing Yu, we don’t have any information on this guy and he possesses terrifying strength. Let’s leave it at this…” Wu Zun muttered.

“Brother Wu Zun is right.” The Nether Yang King added.

Even so, the killing intent in Bing Yu’s eyes didn’t fade. “I understand your concerns. He killed hundreds of my subordinates. If not for the three of you, I might have died in the Yin Ghost River. I must have my revenge!”

The Nether Yang King and the two others exchanged glances and frowned.

Bing Yu retrieved a transmission symbol. It was a transmission symbol given to him by the Yin Reversal Ghost King, and it could be used three times. It was something the ghost king gave him to thank him for his teachings. Now, it could only be used once more.

Bing Yu stared at it and hesitated for a second before crushing it.

The three of them raised an eyebrow in shock when they saw what Bing Yu did.

The Yin Reversal King was the leader of the ghost kings and his strength closed in on the 19 billion units mark.

When that happened, Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Dacheng were resting comfortably on the Supreme Ghost King Ship, fully unaware of what went down.

With the speed of the ship, they started to catch up to the Heavenly Blood Ghost King and the rest.

As the Heavenly Blood Ghost King and the others were standing at the bow of their ship and when they saw the Supreme Ghost King Ship, they sucked in cold breaths.

“Supreme… Supreme Ghost King Ship!” Yue Qing gasped. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Could he be Lord Nether Yang King? Is Lord Nether Yang King here?!” Yue Hong was also stunned.

“Of course it is! Who else will be able to obtain the Supreme Ghost King Boat? Even if it isn’t Lord Nether Yang King, it would be Senior Bing Yu or Lord Wu Zun! It might even be Lord Jiu Yu!”

Very quickly, the Supreme Ghost King Ship passed them.

They saw two figures standing on board the Supreme Ghost King Ship, and Yue Qing yelled in fright, “How?! There’s no way!”

The faces of Yue Hong and the others were a sight to behold.

On the Supreme Ghost King Ship, Huang Xiaolong glanced at them as he passed, but in the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the distance.
