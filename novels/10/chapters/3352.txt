Chapter 3353: Kill Yourself

 

More than thirty experts of the Nande Family surrounded them. Laha chuckled, “Your big brother should be pretty much monster feed by now.”

The blood drained from Alexis’s face, and she screamed, “What did you just say?!” 

“How can this happen?! Didn’t he go exploring with all of you?”

“You said that he was being stupid and that everyone in my family was stuck there! What do you mean by that?!” 

Alexis questioned Laha furiously.

Laha and the others roared with laughter.

“What did I mean?” Laha continued, “We told him that there is a huge amount of black diamonds in one of the mountain ranges. He thought that it was true, and he brought the experts of the Pier Family over. There’s nothing there other than a whole bunch of monsters!” 

Alexis and the members of her group felt their hearts filling up with fury.

“You… You caused my brother to die!” Alexis screamed and a pair of swords appeared in her hands. She charged towards him without a care in the world.

“Young lady, be careful!” Ayi and the others yelled. They protected her as they charged towards the members of the Nande Family.

However, one of the experts beside Laha released his aura and the members of the Pier Family were sent flying backwards.

“Nascent Soul Realm!” Keta yelled when he slammed into the ground behind him.

“What?!” Alexis and the others screamed in fright.

A Nascent Soul Realm expert was like an insurmountable mountain to those present.

“That’s right! We have a Nascent Soul Realm expert on our side!” Laha sneered. “Let me do the introduction. This is a grand elder of our Nande Family, Lord Mo Xuan!” 

“Lord Mo Xuan?!” 

He was the second-strongest expert in their old city! He was an existence at the peak of the late Ninth Level Nascent Soul Realm!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ife’s reaction was pretty much the same. He seemed to have heard of Mo Xuan too.

“Go capture the girl. Kill the rest,” Laha ordered.

Several dozen experts jumped at Huang Xiaolong and the others instantly. All of them were in the Golden Core Realm, and most of them were high-leveled ones.

“You guys…” Alexis and the others jumped in fright.

However, their assailants froze in mid-air. They fell to the ground all of a sudden. When they landed, their bodies turned completely black as though they were poisoned.

The members of the Nande Family were stunned. So were the members of the Pier Family.

What in the world is going on?!

Soon after, the bodies of those who fell from the skies started to corrode. They very quickly became a pile of sludge. The golden cores that were in their bodies turned into a pile of black dust.

Laha and the others who didn’t move earlier sucked in a cold breath. That was a golden core they were talking about! It was stronger than spiritual treasures! Even so, they crumbled into dust in the blink of an eye.

How terrifying was the poison?!

The Nascent Soul Realm expert felt his expression change as he glanced all around him in fright. “Who?!” 

Huang Xiaolong stepped forward slightly and the gazes of those present landed on him.

“You?!” Mo Xuan looked at Huang Xiaolong in doubt.

Alexis and the others were slightly taken aback.

“Are you someone from the Ghost Valley?” Mo Xuan asked.

Among the six factions on Earth, the Ghost Valley was the most mysterious. Other than the art of controlling ghosts, they were well-skilled in the art of poison.

“Nope,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Mo Xuan heaved a sigh of relief. Staring at Huang Xiaolong intently, his expression hardened, “You went too far by killing so many experts of the Nande Family…”

“They’re just a bunch of Golden Core Realm cultivators. Not even the ancient saints can bear the consequences of offending me.”

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Laha burst out laughing all of a sudden and a mocking smile formed on his face. “Not even the ancient saints are qualified to offend you?! Who do you think you are?! Do you really think you’re a god or something?!” 

Huang Xiaolong glanced at him as a bolt of lightning fell from the skies to turn him into a pile of ash.

Mo Xuan’s expression changed instantly. “Who are you?!” 

“Huang Xiaolong.”

“Huang… Huang… Huang Xiaolong?!” Mo Xuan yelped in fright. He fell to his knees instantly and his body trembled in fear. “Your… Your Highness, please spare my life!”

“Since you know who I am, destroy your physical body and I’ll allow your essence soul to live.”

Mo Xuan contemplated his choices for a moment, but he nodded eventually. In front of everyone, he blew his physical body up!

His essence soul flew out from his body, and he bowed respectfully towards Huang Xiaolong before leaving.

The disciples of the Nande Family stared at Huang Xiaolong, and they didn’t know what to do now that their only backup was gone.

“Alexis, you can deal with them as you wish,” Huang Xiaolong said to her.

“Me?!” Alexis snapped back to reality but there was a look of trepidation on her face when she looked at Huang Xiaolong. Even though she didn’t know why Mo Xuan would address Huang Xiaolong as ‘His Highness’, she knew that Huang Xiaolong had to be extremely important for Mo Xuan to destroy his physical body on command.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Alexis hesitated for a moment before retrieving her twin blades. She walked towards the disciples of the Nande Family with a trace of hatred in her eyes.

Even though they tried to escape, they realized that they couldn’t move a muscle.

Several dozen minutes later, Alexis looked at the bodies on the floor covered in blood and she sucked in a long breath.

“Let’s go. Your brother should still be alive,” Huang Xiaolong said.

All of them stared at him in shock.

“My… My… My brother is still alive?!” A look of joy appeared on Alexis’s face.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as he extended his divine sense to cover the entire region. He discovered a young man battling a bunch of monsters in one of the mountain valleys in the region.

Before any of them could react, the world started to spin around them. The next thing they knew, they were standing in the air above the valley.

“Brother!” Alexis exclaimed as she looked at the figure below.
