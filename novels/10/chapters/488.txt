Chapter 489: Assembling in Nine Dragons City

Half a day later, Huang Xiaolong and the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey both left Mystic Elephant Peak, heading to the Ape Deity Temple.

When Huang Xiaolong returned to the Ape Deity Temple, he summoned Ao Kun and Lei Ge to ‘gather’ the Ape Deity Deputy, its Elders, and Hall Masters in the great hall.

Inside the great hall, all of them were made to lower the barrier to their soul seas and were branded with a soul mark.

Those who refused, unwilling to submit, were all moved inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda as extra nourishment for the Poison Corpse Scarabs.

By the end of the day, Huang Xiaolong had taken full control of the Ape Deity Temple. With the three temples; Nine Dragons Temple, Violent Lion Temple, and Ape Deity Temple under his control, it could be said that Huang Xiaolong controlled nine-tenths of the whole demonic beast clan forces. However, Zhou Yunpeng was killed by Huang Xiaolong, leaving the Ape Deity Temple bereft of a leader.

After pondering over the matter, Huang Xiaolong inquired the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey’s opinion and later made him the Ape Deity Temple’s Master.

Although the Violet Spirit Devourer Monkey was only a Fifth Order Saint realm, given a hundred years to grow, his strength would definitely surpass Ao Kun’s.

The next morning, Huang Xiaolong sat on the main seat in the great hall. All three temples’ Temple Masters were summoned to the great hall.

Three great demonic beast experts assembled, filling the great hall with surging demonic qi. In the air above the Ape Deity Temple, abundant demonic qi formed thick rolling clouds.

Huang Xiaolong thought for a moment before speaking, “Ao Kun, Lei Ge, tell your subordinates to spread the news that the Nine Dragons Temple, Violent Lion Temple, and Ape Deity Temple have submitted to me to all corners of the Ten Directions Continent, to the whole Martial Spirit World.”

Since he had taken control of all three temples, it was time to let the whole Martial Spirit World be aware of this.

“Yes, Liege Lord Beast God!” Ao Kun and Lei Ge both answered with utmost respect.

“Another thing, in one month’s time, I want to hold a merging ceremony between the beastmen tribes and the demonic beast clans. Arrange for invitations to be sent to all the Ten Directions Continent’s experts, all the clans’ Patriarchs and their deputies, the Grand Elders and all Saint realm experts to witness the ceremony!” Huang Xiaolong’s sonorous voice reverberated in the great hall. This was the main reason why Huang Xiaolong wanted Ao Kun and the rest to spread the news about the three temples submitting to him.

Of course, the unspoken intention of inviting these experts over was to make them submit to him as well. And Huang Xiaolong trusted that those Patriarchs and experts that received invitations would understand the implied meaning as well.

At that time, the unwilling absentees, or those who attended but refused to submit, would be killed in the cradle to clear away unnecessary future annoyances. This was a world where the weak were prey for the strong. What Huang Xiaolong wanted was the total unification of the Ten Directions Continent’s forces under him.

“Yes, Liege Lord Beast God!” Ao Kun complied, immediately understanding Huang Xiaolong’s intention.

Orders continued to flow from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, passing down the ranks as preparations were being made.

Although with the merging of the beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans he had taken control of seven to eight-tenths of the Ten Directions Continent’s forces, he still needed to proceed with caution. Who’s to say that Deities Templar wouldn’t send people over to disrupt the merging ceremony, even inciting those Patriarchs to join hands with them to oppose Huang Xiaolong.

“What?! The Nine Dragons Temple, Violent Lion Temple, and Ape Deity Temple have submitted to Huang Xiaolong?!”

“All three temples submitted to Huang Xiaolong, that means he rules over the demonic beast clans, ah!”

“Huang Xiaolong has taken over the beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans, even without the Asura’s Gate, it’s Martial Spirit World’s most powerful force! That so-called beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans merging ceremony that he wants to hold, inviting all the experts on the Ten Directions Continent to witness, it’s so obvious he wants all of us to submit to him as well!”

“What should we do?! What can we do?!”

“Huang Xiaolong has conquered the Ten Directions Continent, that means he will be targeting our Cosmos God Cult next!”

After Ao Kun and Lei Ge ordered their subordinates to spread the news about the three temples submitting to Huang Xiaolong, the entire Martial Spirit World was in an uproar. Big and small forces alike were struck by a thunderbolt out of the blue.

The reaction to this news was even bigger than the time when Huang Xiaolong became the beastmen tribes’ new Beast God, even more astounding.

In an instant, the entire Martial Spirit World was awash with dread, unease, fear, despair, and a little delight mingled with happiness.

When the Cosmos God Cult on Starcloud Continent received the news, apprehension shrouded the sect from top to bottom, doubt began to emerge. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A similar atmosphere also descended upon the floating island of Deities Templar in the vicinity of the Dead Sea Gorge.

Ever since the battle at the Beast God Shrine, where Li Molin and sixty other Deities Templar’s experts were killed by Huang Xiaolong, Deities Templar had been amassing their forces in secret, aiming to annihilate Huang Xiaolong and his aides in one fell swoop. But now, unrest began to sprout from within.

Even the demonic beast clans on Ten Directions Continent had submitted to Huang Xiaolong, if he succeeded in conquering the Ten Directions Continent, then Deities Templar would have no place of existence in the Martial Spirit World!

The floating island above the Dead Sea Gorge.

In the central main hall, the Temple Preceptor, Ying Tian, shrouded in a rumbling black mist was staring coldly at the group of Deities Templar experts below the dais.

“This time, what are your thoughts on Huang Xiaolong holding the merging ceremony between the beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans?” Ying Tian spoke in a cold indifferent voice that didn’t disclose his emotions.

“Temple Preceptor, Huang Xiaolong planned this merging ceremony, inviting all clans and races Patriarchs and other experts. His main purpose is to have those forces submit to him. We absolutely must not allow this merging ceremony to complete successfully, if not, it would mean that Huang Xiaolong had conquered the Ten Directions Continent! He will definitely be targeting us next!” One of the Grand Elders stepped forward.

“That’s right, we absolutely must not allow this merging ceremony to be a success!” Other Grand Elders echoed the same words.

Ying Tian waved an arm to silence the hall. Speaking in a somber voice, he said, “Luo Wei, send someone to get in touch with the Cosmos God Cult, Distinct Void Door, White Phoenix House, and also Sin City.”

He knew that these forces wished to see Huang Xiaolong fail the merging ceremony just as much as he did.

“Yes, Temple Preceptor!” Deities Templar Grand Elder Luo Wei took another step forward to acknowledge the task given to him.

“Yang Yue, you arrange for people to communicate with the various Patriarchs on Ten Directions Continent.” Ying Tian issued another order.

“Yes, Temple Preceptor.”

A few days later, in the Elf Forest, underneath the tree of Life, Elf Queen Kelly was looking at the festive red invitation in her hand. This bright red invitation was sent over under Huang Xiaolong’s order by people from the Nine Dragons Temple.

“Your Majesty, are we really going to attend that merging ceremony?” The elves’ Grand Elder Celine couldn’t resist asking.

Elf Queen Kelly sighed with heavy lament, “What else can we do?”

Celine was at a loss for words. She understood what the Queen meant; absence meant that the entire elf race would be annihilated, whereas their presence there meant that the elves would be losing their freedom, becoming a subservient force to the beastmen.

Elf Queen Kelly stared at the Tree of Life in front of her, and Huang Xiaolong’s face flashed in her mind, ‘I wonder how he’s doing now?’ she thought to herself.

She had sent people to inquire news about that black-haired young man, but so far there had been no news. Of course, Elf Queen Kelly still didn’t know Huang Xiaolong’s identity.

“Tell the Elders to prepare, we’ll depart tomorrow to the Nine Dragons City.” Elf Queen Kelly looked over, instructing Celine.

“Yes, Your Majesty!”

Similar conversations like the one between Grand Elder Celine and Elf Queen Kelly took place in the dwarf race, Golden Giant race, Green Devil tribe, and many other big and small forces and tribes that received the same festive red invitation. All of them made preparations to depart to the Nine Dragons City.

The passage of time flows, and very soon more than twenty days had passed.

Only two days were left until the beastmen tribes and demonic beast clans’ merging ceremony.

By this time, the majority of invited parties on the Ten Directions Continent had arrived in Nine Dragons City.

In an instant, one could find experts in every corner of the already bustling streets.
