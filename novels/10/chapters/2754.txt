Chapter 2755: Golden Snake Sacred Land

“Everyone can feel rest assured. After the alliance is formed, you will still be the patriarchs of your own sacred lands, and your sacred lands will be under your own control,” Huang Xiaolong said as his gaze swept across the people at the banquet.

Zhu Xu and the others’ tensed nerves eased at Huang Xiaolong’s words. This was the crux of the matter that lied heavy on their minds, and they were worried that after an alliance was formed, the ‘alliance chief’ Huang Xiaolong would revoke their positions as patriarch of their own sacred lands.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently stated some of the rules, conditions, and authority level of the alliance.

Each sacred land’s patriarch would retain their positions, control the entire sacred land, but these sacred lands would be Cangqiong Sacred Land’s vassals, and serve the Cangqiong Sacred Land, and they were required to send a certain amount of spirit stones, holy pills, spiritual herbs and other resources to Cangqiong Sacred Land every one hundred years.

After listening to all of Huang Xiaolong’s conditions and rules, Zhu Xu and the others fell into momentary silence.

“Alright, I am willing to join the Cangqiong Alliance and serve Lord Huang as our master!” The All-Heavens Sacred Land’s Patriarch Zhu Xu was the first to state his stance. Although Huang Xiaolong had demanded each sacred land to provide Cangqiong Sacred Land with a certain amount of resources every one hundred years, the amount was not too much. It was within his acceptable range.

Moreover, after joining the Cangqiong Alliance, and working under Huang Xiaolong, All-Heavens Sacred Land would also get Huang Xiaolong andCangqiong Holy land’s protection. Zhu Xu could see it clearly that Huang Xiaolong would definitely become a prominent figure in the Divine Tuo Holy World not too long in the future.

Therefore, recognizing Huang Xiaolong as their master was not difficult to accept, and perhaps, it could also be an opportunity instead for All-Heavens Sacred Land.

With Zhu Xu taking the lead, the other five sacred lands’ patriarchs also expressed their willingness to recognize Huang Xiaolong as their master and joined the Cangqiong Alliance.

What Zhu Xu thought of was also what crossed their minds.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the other Primal Ancestors present. Other than the six sacred lands’ patriarchs, there were a dozen of other sacred lands’ Primal Ancestor Realm experts.

This dozen of people merely hesitated for a second before agreeing to join the Cangqiong Alliance.

When all was said and agreed upon, Huang Xiaolong branded their souls with his soul mark. As for the rest of these sacred lands’ disciples, such as Ren Yifei, Hunag Xiaolong merely had them make an oath on the grand dao.

Wine cups clinked and the banquet continued with the main business out of the way.

The banquet ended in the deep night, with the master and servants feeling satisfied.

Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man talked for a long time about many things after Zhu Xu and the others left. They especially talked about the future development route of Cangqiong Alliance and also the resources distribution that they were about to get from the three sacred lands’ treasuries.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t want to attract too much attention at this stage since he was still a Ninth Heaven True Saint. Hence, his master, Cangqiong Old Man assumed the position of Cangqiong Alliance Chief.

In the beginning, Cangqiong Old Man stubbornly disagreed to Huang Xiaolong’s proposal after hearing that he wanted him to take the Cangqiong Alliance Chief position, but under Huang Xiaolong’s logical persuasion, Cangqiong Old Man relented.

As for Huang Xiaolong himself, the identity of a sacred land’s young lord was sufficient.

“When are we going to take theTang Dragon Sacred Land’s and the other two sacred lands’ treasuries?” Cangqiong Old Man asked.

“We’ll set off at the break of dawn,” Huang Xiaolong answered without needing to think.

Now that the three sacred lands’ great armies were almost annihilated, they needed to hurry to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Chufan Sacred Land to collect the three sacred lands’ treasuries, while the matter hadn’t spread out.

Once news about it traveled out, the nearby sacred lands would definitely covet the treasures within the three sacred lands’ treasuries. It would be a great loss if the treasuries fell in others’ hands.

Currently, there were forty-six sacred lands closest to the Cangqiong Sacred Land. These included the Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, Chufan Sacred Land, and the six sacred lands that had joined the Cangqiong Alliance. Nine out of the sixteen sacred lands had submitted to Huang Xiaolong. Therefore, there were still thirty-seven outside forces.

On the same night itself, Huang Xiaolong had Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, and the others prepare.

Early the next day at the break of dawn, Huang Xiaolong and his master, Cangqiong Old Man, made their way to the three sacred lands. Their first stop was the Tang Dragon Sacred Land.

This time, Huang Xiaolong did not bring Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, or any other people with him. Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, and the other four were left to guard the Cangqiong Sacred Land and repair damages.

Fei Yanzi had chanted in Huang Xiaolong’s ears that she wanted to take a look at the nearby sacred lands, and Huang Xiaolong had failed to stop her, allowing her to follow him.

Other than Fei Yanzi and Cangqiong Old Man, there were also experts from the three sacred lands who had submitted to Huang Xiaolong, as well as the other sacred lands’ experts. After counting all of these people, there were a total of eighty-nine of them.

Huang Xiaolong had the experts like Zhu Xu, who had joined the alliance, return to their own sacred lands. He wanted to wait until he had settled the three sacred lands’ matters and completely subjugated them, before visiting the six sacred lands one by one.

When the time was right, Huang Xiaolong would subjugate the rest of these six sacred lands’ Primal Ancestor experts, and only then it could be said that these six sacred lands were truly Cangqiong Sacred Land’s vassals.

After Zhu Xu and the rest left, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and then set off to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land with Fen Yanzi, Cangqiong Old Man, and eighty-nine Primal Ancestors. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The Tang Dragon Sacred Land was the closest to Cangqiong Sacred Land, so naturally, that was Huang Xiaolong’s first stop. Not to mention that amongst the three sacred lands, the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasuries contained most treasures and amazing items.

However, when the three sacred lands’ experts entered the Cangqiong Dao Palace, they stared dumbly at the Cangqiong Dao Palace’s sky that was filled with holy spiritual veins, holy trees, and the bountiful holy fruits hanging off the branches.

Forget the three holy sacred lands’ experts, Fei Yanzi and Cangqiong Old Man himself were dazed.

Huang Xiaolong said to Cangqiong Old Man and Fei Yanzi, “These are the things I found on the Sky Opening Island in the past.”

Cangqiong Old Man recovered from his astonishment, and let out hearty laughter, “What the heck are the three sacred lands’ treasuries compared to these treasures here?”

Huang Xiaolong smiled as Cangqiong Old Man’s comparison was not an exaggeration. Indeed, even after adding everything inside the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasury, Freezing Desert Sacred Land’s treasury, and Chufan Sacred Land’s treasury, their worth couldn’t be compared to these holy spiritual veins and holy fruits within the Cangqiong Holy Palace.

Huang Xiaolong had the three sacred lands’ Primal Ancestors drive the Cangqiong Dao Palace’s core formation in full force. The Cangqiong Dao Palace executed its fastest speed, getting nearer to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land as time passed.

Feeling idle, Huang Xiaolong took Cangqiong Old Man and Fei Yanzi to tour his orchard. There, they tasted the various holy fruits, and discussed the grand dao and cultivation.

Several days later…

The Cangqiong Dao Palace stopped above the Tang Dragon Sacred Land.

Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Cangqiong Dao Palace after everyone alighted, and then flew straight down to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land with everyone.

At this time, Tang Long’s son, the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s Young Lord Tang Yixing, was busy greeting a very important guest. This important guest came from the Golden Snake Sacred Land, and the Golden Snake Sacred Land was one of the top ten sacred lands in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave.

There were tens of thousands of sacred lands in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, and the top ten sacred lands were naturally hegemons in their own rights in the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave. One could imagine how lofty the statuses of the disciples of these top ten sacred lands were.

“Lord Yang, you have graced our Tang Dragon Sacred Land by stopping by,” Tang Yixing raised his cup and toasted respectfully with a hint of flattery towards the young man in front of him.

Yang Shangchen nodded casually, “Where is your father, and the others?”

Although he was merely passing by the Tang Dragon Sacred Land, he wanted Tang Long to look for something.
