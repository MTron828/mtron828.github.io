Chapter 3595 – Meeting Lord Zhang Yun

Qin Feng sneered, “We made a great concession when we agreed to leave the creation pills and herbs. Don’t think about getting anything more from us! Otherwise, you won’t be able to afford the consequences of offending Lord Zhang Yun!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he heard how they tried to use Zhang Yun to pressure him into backing off.

“I’m going too far? Alright. I’ll show you what that actually means.” Huang Xiaolong reached out with a single hand and pulled all three of them towards himself.

They were frightened when Huang Xiaolong made his move.

“We’ll go all out! He might not be able to defeat all three of us when we work together!” Jin Shi yelled. After the words left his lips, golden light covered his body. The golden corpse qi he produced turned into golden corpse dragons that had sinister expressions on their faces. Corpse qi filled the air, and it was a hundred times more terrifying than the corpse qi that was once in the air.

Jin Chengguang and the others were taken aback when they felt the increase in power. He might be at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm after comprehending thirteen elements to the grand perfection level, but he knew that the corpse qi dragons would tear him to shreds in an instant!

Jade green light emerged from Qin Feng’s body and it contained the power to affect the souls of everyone present. They felt as though their dao souls had fallen into a quagmire, and it became extremely uncomfortable.

As for Bai Zhou, he summoned a ball of white light that possessed the power of a trillion suns that hung high above the city.

“Die!”

The three of them moved in unison, and they appeared before Huang Xiaolong in an instant. Jin Shi held onto an item that looked like a long bone spike. Bai Zhou used a pure white sword that could allow him to challenge Gods of Creation who just entered the large completion stage.

The white sword circled Huang Xiaolong and it sliced towards the back of his head.

His move was extremely unpredictable, and ordinary experts at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm might be surprised by his sneak attack.

Qin Feng’s axe slashed at Huang Xiaolong’s chest and he came with a vengeance.

Their combination was pretty great, and it was evident it wasn’t their first time working together.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard their assumption that they would be able to take him down when they worked together. They couldn’t even see Huang Xiaolong’s movement before they were sent flying.

By the time they landed, the entire area was a mess and their bodies were covered in rubble.

The three creation artifacts they held were stabbed straight into the walls of the city.

When Jin Chengguang and the others saw what happened to the three Gods of Creation, waves of shock battered their tiny little hearts.

Bai Zhou might not be at the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm, but he wasn’t any weaker than Jin Shi! When they worked together, the power of three God of Creation Realm experts at the large completion stage were unleashed to the maximum! Even so, they were crushed!

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even attack them!

As for the marshals of the retreating ghost corpse army, they were terrified.

Huang Xiaolong ignored everyone else as he appeared in the skies above the three of them. A gust of wind swept through the lands to reveal their sorry figures in the ground below.

Blood stains covered their bodies and their faces were covered in dirt.

Fear filled their hearts when they saw Huang Xiaolong standing above their heads.

“You!” Jin Shi was afraid, but rage soon filled his heart. Huang Xiaolong’s strength was far beyond his expectations!

With another wave of his hand, he dragged the three of them over.

Soon after, their spatial artifacts were taken from them and so were their creation artifacts that were stuck in the city walls.

“Who in the world are you?!” Bai Zhou roared, “Since you dare to steal our artifacts, we’ll report this to Lord Zhang Yun! He’ll hold you accountable for your actions!”

“Lord Zhang Yun? Never heard of him…” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Searching through their dao souls, he discovered that there were special restrictions laid down on it. However, the restrictions were much weaker than the ones placed on the dao souls of Huang Sheng, Zhu Qiming, and the experts around Meng Tian.

Carefully studying the restrictions around their dao souls, Huang Xiaolong realized that he had the ability to shatter them safely if he put his mind to it. He could easily brand their dao souls with his own to control the three of them.

Of course, that would alert the Limitless Master as the restrictions were probably laid down by him. He might even draw the attention of the Dragon Overlord, and he decided against shattering the restrictions.

Soon after, he brought the three of them towards their factions. He swept their treasuries clean without a second word.

The three of them could only curse at Huang Xiaolong silently.

When they were done, Huang Xiaolong released the three of them.

As they stared at his leaving figure, they gnashed their teeth in anger.

“Let’s report this to Lord Zhang Yun! We’ll go to Cloud Mountain right now!” Jin Shi growled as hatred flashed in his eyes.

Qin Feng and Bai Zhou nodded. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

…

When Huang Xiaolong was done, he returned to the Golden Sea City only to see the Golden Sea Army cleaning up the area.

“Lord, you’re finally back! The ancestors and patriarchs of the various families are currently kneeling outside the manor! They wish to meet you personally to thank you for saving the city.” Tao Hang reported the moment Huang Xiaolong returned.

Huang Xiaolong’s feat of defeating the three of them caused the hearts of the old ancestors to tremble.

“It’s alright. Send them back to their manors. I shall enter seclusion right now.” Huang Xiaolong instructed before telling Tao Hang and Tao Han’er to stay in the city. Before Tao Hang could react, Huang Xiaolong disappeared.

Now that he received the treasuries from the three great factions, Huang Xiaolong could power the grand formation on the Universe Boat for quite some time.
