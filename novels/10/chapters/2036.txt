Chapter 2037: Du Hai’s Shock

When Huang Xiaolong finally arrived on the piece of land at the bottom of the ravine, the feeling of soft soil under his feet made it feel as though he was standing on a bed of cotton. The soil was a light red in color, and it was a pretty little place.

Countless divine artifacts were strewn about the island.

All of them were shaped differently—some were earrings and some in the shape of shoes. There were even some fingernail shaped ones!

However, the only similarity between them was that they had long since lost the layer of shine on them. Some of them were even rusted.

Normally, a divine artifact wouldn’t lose its strength even after a hundred million years. However, it seemed as though all of the ones on the island had already turned into scrap metal.

From a single glance, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see the end of the pile of divine artifacts. He quickly estimated the number of divine artifacts on the ground, and it was definitely more than a billion.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

The ravine was somewhere even Sovereign Realm experts couldn’t come and go as they pleased. How did the divine artifacts get there?

Huang Xiaolong swept his divine sense through the area, and he realized that there was mysterious energy surrounding the tiny island.

Keeping the six chaos lightning pools, the three supreme radiance treasures, and his sixteen wings, Huang Xiaolong stopped circulating his Archdevil bloodlines and retrieved the Lotus of Darkness.

He controlled the four devil steles to locate the Divine Artifact Devil Stele as he flew towards it.

Along the way, he saw nothing other than scrapped metal.

After a few minutes, Huang Xiaolong finally saw something different. There was a pile of pure white bones sticking out like a sore thumb, and he had no idea who they belonged to.

It was as though Huang Xiaolong had managed to find a set of bones of one of the overlords from the Desolate Era.

Whatever the case, the bones were like the weapons. All the power contained in it had long since disappeared. It would crumble to dust if the slightest wind struck it. The only reason it was still intact was because there wasn’t any wind in the space below the ravine.

A light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

There was no doubt the person who had died there was an overlord in the Desolate Era. However, he wondered if a battle had broken out between the super experts over the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

The only question that couldn’t be answered was how the expert arrived at the bottom of the ravine.

Huang Xiaolong knew that the bones belonged to an Emperor Realm expert, and there was no way an Emperor Realm expert could make it to the bottom.

As he pondered over his question, more and more bones appeared along the ground.

Other than bones and decaying weapons, Huang Xiaolong saw nothing else.

The air was still, and it seemed as though no one had set foot in the space for several billion years. As Huang Xiaolong approached the end of the space, the rays of light emitted by the four devil steles in his body increased in intensity. It was clear that he was getting closer to the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

Another half an hour passed.

Huang Xiaolong finally arrived at the limits of the space under the ravine.

As soon as he arrived, he saw a massive stele erected in the middle on the ground, and there were halos of devil energy swirling above it. The devil light transformed into all sorts of divine artifacts.

Divine Artifact Devil Stele!

Looking at the devil stele before him, Huang Xiaolong finally revealed a smile. He heaved a sigh of relief. He finally found it!

Huang Xiaolong had thought that he would experience endless troubles after setting foot onto space under the ravine, but reality proved him wrong. He had never expected to obtain the Divine Artifact Devil Stele with such ease.

As though it could feel the presence of other devil steles on Huang Xiaolong’s body, the Divine Artifact Devil Stele rose from the ground and flew towards its brethren.

As the five devil steles gathered, a flash of light emerged and stirred the devil and poison qi in the space above.

Huang Xiaolong sucked in a long breath before placing his hand on the Divine Artifact Devil Stele.

Waves of darkness energy emerged instantly and tried to swallow him.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be more familiar with the darkness energy coming from the devil stele, and he quickly circulated the Grandmist Parasitic Medium in order to devour the energy entering his body.

He activated all three Archdevil bloodlines as well.

...

On the cliff high above the ravine, the little cow, the King of Darkness, and Du Hai stared at the bottom without so much as blinking.

Since the time Huang Xiaolong had left, three years had already passed.

“It’s been three years... Did the brat die down there?” A trace of suspicion flashed through Du Hai’s eyes as he asked.

Even someone like him wouldn’t be able to remain down there for three whole years!

He turned to stare at the little cow and the King of Darkness before saying, “Old lady, he wouldn’t have died down there, right? Why hasn’t there been any news of him? The poison and devil qi down there can corrode anything! Even a Sovereign Realm expert won’t be able to remain down there for three years. How can a late-Sixth Order Emperor like him stay down there? I’m afraid he’s already dead. His corpse has probably been swallowed by the poison qi...”

He felt that the only reason he couldn’t feel Huang Xiaolong’s presence was because the poison qi had long since devoured him down in the ravine.

“Even if that kid dies down there, you still have to cough up another hundred million mid-grade chaos spirit stones!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The only thing Du Hai cared about was the spirit stones. He couldn’t be bothered even if Huang Xiaolong died down there.

A frosty light flashed through the little cow’s eyes, and she snapped, “Old man, do you really think I’m afraid of making a move?”

Du Hai could only force a smile as he released awkward laughter.

“Old lady, do you really think I’m afraid of you?!”

In the past three years, the three of them had been bickering non-stop.

Just before they could come to blows, the situation changed. A rumbling came from the ravine, and cracks started to form on the ground under them. It was as though a terrifying beast was about to burst out from the earth.

“What’s going on?!” Du Hai turned his gaze back to the ravine and exclaimed in shock.

Clouds of devil qi and poison qi started to churn as pillars of devil light shot into the sky.

When the little cow and the King of Darkness saw the pillars of black light, they couldn’t help but celebrate. Smiles slowly formed on the faces of Wu Shaowu and the Emperors of the two emperor countries.

Before Du Hai could say anything, an ear-shattering dragon roar broke through space and echoed through the air. A single figure broke through the dense clouds of the devil and poison qi to appear in front of them.

“Xiaolong!”

“Master!”

The little cow, the King of Darkness, and everyone else ran up to welcome him.

The person who had emerged from the ravine was none other than Huang Xiaolong, who had stayed down there for three whole years.

When Du Hai saw Huang Xiaolong, he was stumped for words. However, an expression of shock soon appeared on his face when he realized the change that had happened. “You... You broke through to the Seventh Order?!”

He stared at Huang Xiaolong, and he couldn’t believe his eyes.

This...

From his experience, he had never seen anyone breaking through from the late-Sixth Order Emperor Realm to the Seventh Order in three short years!

If Huang Xiaolong had stayed down there for thirty thousand years and come up as a Seventh Order Emperor, he might have believed it.

Did he find a supreme treasure down there?! Could it be that he found a level three origin treasure?! Wait... It’s even possible for him to find a mid-rank origin treasure!

Mid-rank origin treasure. That was something only Lord Wan Shi from the City of All-Heavens had seen before!

The more Du Hai thought, the stronger the killing intent he emitted.
