Chapter 3125: Capturing the Black Shadow Devil

By the time the Black Shadow Devil discovered the abnormality and tried to escape, he was blocked off by a shocking wave of power.

“This… Genesis level formation!”

It was a genesis level formation that could separate the space they were in!

The Black Shadow Devil’s expression sank. Anyone who could lay down such a formation would be an expert in the art of formations. There weren’t that many people in the Origin Holy World that reached such a high level in the art of formations…

“Black Shadow Devil, we meet again.” A voice rang in his ears.

Turning around abruptly, the Black Shadow Devil’s face changed. “Huang Xiaolong, it’s you!”

Looking at the twelve people rushing towards him, his expression turned a little unsightly. “What do you want? Do you really think you can trap me with this piece of sh*t formation?”

In the past hundreds of years, he had been hiding in the region to enter secluded cultivation. He didn’t roam about at all, and he had no idea what went down in the outside world. He didn’t even know about the battle where Huang Xiaolong suppressed the nine beast kings and defeated Xiao Tianqi! If he knew, he wouldn’t dare to speak to Huang Xiaolong this way.

“You’ll see if this formation can trap you here…”

The Black Shadow Devil’s body started to flicker, and he turned into spots of light. The light spots shot towards the void as he tried to make a break for it.

Boom!

The space exploded instantly, and the shockwaves caused the entire space around them to shake. Despite that, the space around them remained completely solid and the light specks started to gather once again. When they disappeared, the Black Shadow Devil reappeared and he looked at the formation surrounding him in shock.

“This is the Space Suppressing Grand Formation. One of the ten strongest formations in the Origin Holy World.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Space Suppressing Grand Formation!

The Black Shadow Devil felt his heart sinking.

There was no way he hadn’t heard of such a famous formation.

However, he knew that only one person in the entire Origin Holy World could lay down such a terrifying formation.

He looked at Lei Yu, He Zhen, and the nine beast kings before turning to look at He Zhen once more. “You… Myriad Formation Devil?!”

“That’s right. I am the Myriad Formation Devil.”

The Black Shadow Devil felt as though someone smashed him in the chest with a sledge hammer and he retreated repeatedly.

“There’s no point trying to escape.” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “Submit to me and this will be over.” Before he could say anymore, the Black Shadow Devil reached forward and twisted the space before him. “Space Shatterer!”

A ray of light twisted the space around them, and a spatial tear ripped apart the space they were standing in.

The speed at which the spatial tear started to spread was extremely quick, and it soon arrived before Huang Xiaolong.

Reaching his hand out, the power of absolute frost poured out from his hands and froze the entire space they were in. A world of ice and frost was born, but no matter how hard he tried to stop the spatial tear, he failed to do so.

The Black Shadow Devil roared with laughter, “Huang Xiaolong, this is the power of space I comprehended! Even if you reached perfection level in the power of absolute frost, you can’t stop the space from tearing! Go to hell!”

As soon as the words left his lips, the nirvana flame appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand. He reached out and slapped the spatial tear approaching him, and it burned the space before him into nothingness. A massive black hole appeared, and the Black Shadow Devil’s strike was stopped.

The Black Shadow Devil was shocked, and he looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. “Power of nirvana at perfection level!”

In the Blue Lotus Pond, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t comprehended the power of nirvana!

However, it had only been several hundred years and he reached perfection level in the power of nirvana!

Staring at the Black Shadow Devil, Huang Xiaolong snorted, “Your Space Shatterer might be powerful, but your ability to control space hasn’t reached perfection level yet. I can burn space with my nirvana flame, you can’t shatter space if there's nothing left for you to shatter.”

Huang Xiaolong could see that the Black Shadow Devil had barely reached the major completion stage in the power of space.

However, that was shocking enough. Even experts ranked in the top twenty ranks on the Extermination List would find it hard to stop the Black Shadow Devil. They could only dodge his attack with everything they could.

Uncertain light flashed through the Black Shadow Devil’s eyes, and an idea formed on his head. “Huang Xiaolong, I know you’re here for Huang Shuai! If you let me leave, I’ll tell you his true identity!”

“Oh?” Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. Why would the Black Shadow Devil know about Huang Shuai’s true identity?

“That’s right! What do you say to that?” The Black Shadow Devil asked.

At that instant, the Black Shadow Devil stared at Huang Xiaolong with his beady black eyes. Dark light surrounded his figure, and no one could see his true features.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I might be interested, but after I take you down, I’ll learn about his identity all the same.”

The Black Shadow Devil’s expression changed and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong, you might have reached perfection level in the power of nirvana, and you might command the Myriad Formation Devil! However, I can travel anywhere within the sacred land. If you push me too far, I’ll just bring you along with me to hell!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother correcting the man and he addressed He Zhen and the nine beast kings behind him. “Do it.”

As the ten figures moved, they appeared beside the Black Shadow Devil in an instant. They were so quick that the Black Shadow Devil couldn’t even see them coming. Without any time to react, he started to fuse with the space around him.

It was too bad they punched out at the exact same time, shattering the space all around them.

“You… You…” The Black Shadow Devil looked at the nine beast kings and fear filled his eyes.

He could feel that every single one of them was stronger than the Myriad Formation Devil, and that in itself was an unbelievable fact.

When he was still stuck in a state of shock, the nine beast kings moved again. With He Zhen beside them, they attacked from ten directions. They sealed off the space around them, and the Black Shadow Devil was unable to leave! In the blink of an eye, the Black Shadow Devil was sent flying.

The Black Shadow Devil shattered the sacred land below him, and he spat out copious amounts of blood.

“Who the hell are you?!” The Black Shadow Devil wiped the blood from his lips and he stared at the nine of them in shock. He didn’t expect that nine monsters would appear in the Origin Holy World! All of them were stronger than the Myriad Formation Devil, but he hadn’t heard of them before! Wasn’t the Myriad Formation Devil ranked fourth on the Extermination List?! How could there be nine people stronger than him?!

A thought flashed through his mind and he felt the world turning dark around him.

“You’re the Death Beast Kings!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The Extermination List in the Origin Holy World didn’t include experts in two big regions. One of them was the Death Beasts Peril Lands, and the other was the Origin Lands!

From the legends, the ten beast kings of the Death Beasts Peril Lands and the ten overlords of the Origin Lands were existences who could rival the top three experts on the Extermination List. Since the experts of the two regions weren’t controlled by the World Master’s Manor, they wouldn’t be ranked in the Extermination List!

The nine beast kings remained silent and they punched out once again. The world trembled and the space around them shattered. Several minutes later, the nine beast kings and the Myriad Formation Devil brought the Black Shadow Devil before Huang Xiaolong.
