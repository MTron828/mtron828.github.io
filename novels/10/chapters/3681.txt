Chapter 3682 – Not From the Unknown Space

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother replying. Instead, he started to circulate his grand cosmos energy.

After five minutes, Huang Xiaolong knew that the young man would attack him instantly.

“Three minutes.” A frosty look slowly formed on the young man’s face when he saw Huang Xiaolong’s lack of reaction.

“Two…”

…

“One minute!” His voice rang in the air and his face turned unfriendly.

Seconds ticked by and five minutes were nearly up.

A short moment before the time was up, Huang Xiaolong sprung into action. A terrifying storm filled the space around him as starlight descended on the lands. 26.9 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body as the Star Dragon Divine Tree appeared. A branch several thousand miles long shot past at the young man clad in gold and sealed off all routes of retreat.

A sneer formed on the young man’s lips when Huang Xiaolong moved. He had long since expected Huang Xiaolong to try something when he didn’t surrender immediately. The Ghost Staff in his hand flew out to deflect the branch, but his eyes widened when he noticed what it really was.

He could feel the terrifying power of the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the universe source qi around it. Could it be?!

Without any time to think about it, he pushed himself to his limit in a desperate attempt to stop the strike.

The power of the staff emerged and countless fierce devils charged at the star dragon that had formed around the branch.

It was too bad the devils couldn’t even get close to the dragon. With a wave of its body, the star dragon phantom destroyed the devils before flying towards the golden robed young man.

Grunting, the man revealed the true form of the Ghost Staff that was countless miles tall. Several shadows of the staff appeared behind him to smash at the star dragons that were slowly forming around the branch.

The Reversal Sword that appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s hand a while ago turned into a streak of light that appeared before the young man’s chest. As the sword was too quick, it arrived before the man could react.

Using his grand cosmos energy to protect himself, he tried to stop the Reversal Sword.

It was too bad it was completely useless.

His defenses were comparable to a soap bubble that popped the moment the sword arrived.

Slashing into his chest, it didn’t matter that he was wearing a pseudo universe treasure-level armor.

The sword emerged from the young man’s back before returning to Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

Roaring in rage, the man flew backwards to create some distance between them before snorting, “You… That’s the Reversal Sword!”

He slowly raised his head to look at the giant tree above Huang Xiaolong.

“Star Dragon Divine Tree!”

“Yeah. I bet you didn’t expect to see the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Reversal Sword.” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly.

It was true. There was no way he would be caught off guard if he knew, but it was too late for regrets.

One had to know that his combat strength had reached the 28 billion mark! He was a force to be reckoned with!

He sneered after seeing the treasures. “I didn’t expect to see so many universe treasures. As it turns out, you’re the one who exterminated the bodies of the Yin Reversal King and the Yang Nether King!”

Huang Xiaolong obtained the Reversal Sword in the Yin Soul River where he exterminated the physical bodies of the Yin Reversal King and the Yang Nether King. The news had already spread through the Unknown Space and many people knew about it.

“Hehe…” A burning gaze appeared in the young man’s eyes. “Who would have thought that you would be lucky enough to obtain two universe treasures?! Aren’t you aware of the crime of harboring a jade ring?”

A question came out of Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, changing the atmosphere immediately. “Are you even from the Unknown Space?”

There was only a single existence in the Unknown Space whose combat abilities had crossed the 27 billion mark. Since the young man wasn’t the Fierce Devil, he definitely came from somewhere else.

Staring at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence for a moment, the young man eventually cackled, “You’re right, I’m not from the Unknown Space.”

Indeed… ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes. If he wasn’t from the Unknown Space, where did he come from?

He shouldn’t be someone from the Thirteen Universes either. Huang Xiaolong traveled all around the thirteen universes before coming to the Unknown Space. There was no way he wouldn’t know if an expert of the young man’s level was present.

“You don’t seem to be from the Unknown Space either.” The young man chuckled.

“That’s right. I come from the Thirteen Universes.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan on hiding it.

“Thirteen Universes?!” The young man was stunned for a solid second.

He knew exactly how strong the members of the thirteen universes were. All of them were garbage! They didn’t have a supreme expert among them! It was hard to find a single person who crossed the 10 billion grand cosmos energy level, much less someone with 20 billion!

A sneer soon followed, “Even with the Star Dragon Divine Tree and the Reversal Sword, you’re trapped in my Eighteen Hell Grand Formation. If you hand them over, I’ll allow you to leave.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the young man with a mocking smile, “You’ll allow me to leave if I hand them over? Do I look like I was born yesterday? Am I stupid or are you not thinking straight?”

With his expression sinking slightly, he narrowed his eyes and growled, “I was only injured because you caught me off guard. Do you really think that you can do it again?”

“I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over both treasures and I’ll swear in the name of the universe that I’ll allow you to leave.”

The words barely left his lips when Huang Xiaolong slashed at him once again. A billion light rays appeared and the Star Dragon Divine Tree swept at the young man.

Jumping back in fright, the young man left the grand formation. He pushed the formation to the limit as weird runes filled the space around Huang Xiaolong.

When the branch of the Star Dragon Divine Tree slammed into the light barrier, it didn’t manage to break through!

The young man heaved a sigh of relief and he chuckled, “If you really crossed the 27 billion units mark, you might really be able to break through the barrier. It’s too bad you’re not a match for me right now!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong muttered. With his aura soaring once again, waves of star dragon qi filled the grand formation. At the same time, the Three Gods Halberd appeared in his hand.

“Three Gods Halberd!” The golden robed young man was completely dumbfounded.

With the Reversal Sword in his left hand and the Three Gods Halberd in his right hand, he slashed at the barrier. At the same time, he fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree and sent countless branches into the barrier.

A massive blast resounded through the skies.

The formation stopped operating all of a sudden.
