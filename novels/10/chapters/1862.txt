Just as Huang Xiaolong’s figure appeared in the air, a sudden sharp bellow sounded with brimming killing intent, “Kill—!”

In the next second, a black arrow with startling destructive power cut across the void. It pierced everything hindering its path and aimed at Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

This black arrow was no stranger to Huang Xiaolong. During his stint in Hell, at the Black Ant Clan’s headquarters, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han had ambushed him with the same black arrow.

The moment this black arrow went straight towards Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, a torrent of chaos divine lightning struck down out of nowhere. These streaks of chaos divine lightning formed into a vast net covering almost a hundred thousand li radius of space with Huang Xiaolong as the center.

After the torrent of chaos divine lightning, numerous sword qi, fist imprints, and palm imprints shattered the void like an angry tsunami and flooded in from all four directions, sweeping towards Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong watched the black arrow that was coming at him, as well as the torrent of chaos divine lightning and curtains of sword qi, fist imprints, and palm imprints from all around, and snorted in disdain.

The owner of the black arrow was none other than the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han. The torrent of chaos divine lightning obviously came from the Violent Lightning Archdevil’s attack. Meanwhile, the surrounding sword qi, fist imprints, and palm imprints likely belonged to the Hundred Transformation Sect and Black Killer Sect’s experts.

Were these people aiming to kill him in one strike?

In the last few months, Chu Han, Violent Lightning Archdevil, and the others had not taken any action. They had been hiding in the vicinity, bitterly waiting, just for this moment, right?

When Chu Han, Violent Lightning Archdevil, and the rest attacked Huang Xiaolong, a burst of black light obscured Huang Xiaolong’s figure as the Black Dragon Divine Armor emerged. Simultaneously, the other two Black Dragon Clan’s treasures also appeared. Black-colored dragon qi condensed into tens and thousands of black dragon souls, flying out and colliding head-on with the attacks from the Hundred Transformation Sect and Black Killer Sect’s experts.

The City of Eternity flew out. A hundred Undead Netherguards poured their godforce into the City of Eternity and blocked the black arrow’s attack.

The Heavenly Hall whistled across the air while it expanded in size, dispersing all of the Violent Lightning Archdevil’s chaos divine lightning in the blink of an eye.

On the other hand, the four odd beasts did not take any action other than keeping close to Huang Xiaolong. They kept vigilance on the surroundings for any movements from Nine Ying Giant Corpse Tribe’s Old Ancestor Shi Ming and Chiyou Archdevil, as they hadn’t yet appeared.

Then, a massive flying ship flew out from the void, casting a shadow over the land. This was the famous top-grade grandmist flying artifact, Netherking Flying Ship. The moment the Netherking Flying Ship appeared, Huang Xiaolong, Gao Changran, Wang Fanning, and the four odd beasts boarded it in a flicker.

The four odd beasts wasted no time in sending their godforce into the flying ship’s core formation. The Netherking Flying Ship sped forward like a falling meteor.

Miserable screams reverberated in the air.

Blood splattered on the land like rain.

More than a hundred people plummeted from the void.

These were the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors and Black Killer Sect’s experts hiding in the void waiting to ambush Huang Xiaolong.

The Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors and Black Killer Sect’s experts were filled with unprecedented fear, watching the Netherking Flying Ship that covered the sky.

“It’s, it’s the previous Lord of Hell’s Netherking Flying Ship!”

As Huang Xiaolong had not disguised the Netherking Flying Ship, others recognized it in a glance. Many Devil Race’s experts were no stranger to the legendary Netherking Flying Ship.

After the Netherking Flying Ship rammed through the hidden experts, it flew onwards without stopping, speeding off into space with Huang Xiaolong and the others on board.

“Chase!!”

The Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han’s furious bellows echoed in the air as he lunged forward, chasing after Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Violent Lightning Archdevil and Black Killer Sect Chief Cui Huajie quickly followed.

Last in the pursuing group was the Hundred Transformation Sect’s Ancestors and other Devil Race’s experts.

But as they wanted to chase after the Netherking Flying Ship, the City of Eternity and Heavenly Hall suddenly made a turnaround and rammed into them from behind.

The Hundred Transformation Sect, Black Killer Sect, and other Devil Race’s experts turned deathly pale instantly and swerved away to dodge. Even so, many of them exploded to their deaths in the colliding force.

Blood shot out like arrows to various heights.

However, the City of Eternity and Heavenly Hall did not continue to attack after that, as they quickly chased after the Netherking Flying Ship and returned inside Huang Xiaolong’s body.

The Netherking Flying Ship sped into the void in a streak of black light, traversing several hundred thousand li in seconds.

Seeing this, the Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han hollered anxiously.

“Chase!”

“Kill Huang Xiaolong! He cannot be allowed to leave the Eternal Devil City!”

“Listen up, all experts within the Eternal Devil City. Whoever injures Huang Xiaolong will be rewarded ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones! The reward will be a hundred million for killing Huang Xiaolong!”

Massacring Gods Gate’s Old Ancestor Chu Han’s voice was infused with godforce. Hence, his words reached every corner of the Eternal Devil City, clear and loud in everyone’s ears.

They could get ten million low-grade chaos spirit stones if they injured Huang Xiaolong!

But if they killed him, they would get one hundred million! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, all the experts within the Eternal Devil City erupted in a manic furor.

Although killing Huang Xiaolong was easier said than done, injuring him was relatively easier in their opinion. It was possible.

Though Huang Xiaolong had quite a reputation outside, these experts believed that Huang Xiaolong couldn’t fend off attacks from so many of them.

Under the allure of low-grade chaos spirit stones, some Devil Race’s experts whistled into the air, flying towards the Netherking Flying Ship.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, watching this sight. He ordered the four odd beasts to hit these impediments simply. Moreover, the City of Eternity and Heavenly Hall flew out and swept off these naive experts.

Overwhelmed by the City of Eternity, Heavenly Hall, and Netherking Flying Ship’s power, the experts trying to stop the Netherking Flying Ship were nothing more than a mantis blocking a cart. Some of these experts were repelled back mercilessly while the weaker ones exploded on the spot.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong took out the Devil Gourd. He uncorked the gourd’s mouth and activated the chaos formation inside it. Devilish water rushed out from the gourd’s mouth, entangling around the surrounding Devil Race’s experts. To these experts’ horror, they immediately discovered that they actually could not break free from this water, as if they had fallen into a quagmire of viscous liquid.

Then, a powerful suction force came from the gourd’s mouth, sucking in the experts who were ensnared by ropes of black water.

The Devil Gourd glimmered in rays of bright light as muffled screams sounded from inside the gourd.

“Huang Xiaolong, let us out!”

“Do you really want to become enemies with the entire Devil World’s Archdevil Ancestors! I am the Sky Water Devil Sect’s Chief! Let us out!”

The experts who were sucked into the Devil Gourd were screaming and clamoring fearfully.

Huang Xiaolong ignored these screams and continued to send godforce into the Devil Gourd’s chaos formation.

The experts ensnared within the Devil Guard were shocked to see that the black sea under their feet had suddenly started roiling violently, raising ten thousand zhang high waves that swallowed them.

Blood-curdling screams rang as these experts were pulled into the black sea below. In the next second, these experts melted into black-colored water!

Dead!

Not a piece of intact bone remained! Even the godhead shattered into dust.

“What is this?!”

“What the f*ck is this stuff exactly?!”

The Sky Water Devil Sect’s Chief and the others dodged the waves in a fluster, cursing loudly.

"This is Black Burial Water!" Huang Xiaolong’s frosty voice sounded inside the gourd.

"What? Black Burial Water! The most poisonous water from the Devil World that not even a peak late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm can survive!?" The Sky Water Devil Sect Chief shrieked.

Other experts who had survived the first round of attack paled visibly.

Although they had not seen the Black Burial Water, the Black Burial Water’s terror was louder than thunder.
