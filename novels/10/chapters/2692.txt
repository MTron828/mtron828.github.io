Chapter 2693: Saving the Others

Even though Elder Ming had already imprinted his soul mark into the Magic Pagoda, Huang Xiaolong realized that he needed no more than several days to shatter all the restrictions contained within.

In the next few days, Huang Xiaolong ignored Jiang Heng, Teng Xiao, and the others as he focused on breaking the restrictions on the pagoda dao artifact. After several days’ worth of work, he finally managed to shatter all the restrictions left behind by Elder Ming.

If Elder Ming’s dao soul was the one guarding the pagoda, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t be able to devour it no matter how hard he tried. With his current abilities, he couldn’t even refine Mo Jingcheng’s soul, much less Elder Ming who was several times stronger. However, a soul imprint didn’t pose too much of a threat.

After shattering the restrictions, he saved Long Shengtian and the other Primal Ancestor of the Otherworldly Mansion.

As soon as Long Shengtian emerged, he grabbed Huang Xiaolong’s shoulders without saying a word. There were too many things he wanted to say, but he had no idea where to start. As such, he chose to remain silent. When he was captured by Elder Ming and thrown into the pagoda, he had thought that his fate was sealed. All the hope in his heart was destroyed when he had realized how strong Elder Ming really was. Before he was saved, he had already prepared himself for death.

The other Primal Ancestor of the Otherworldly Mansion was also extremely grateful to Huang Xiaolong.

Retrieving two holy fruits from the Cangqiong Dao Palace, he passed them over to Long Shengtian and the other Primal Ancestor.

“Are these nascent holy fruits?!” Long Shengtian stared at the fruit in his hand, and he widened his eyes in surprise. He had seen nascent holy fruits before, and he knew that they were treasures reaching the level of a dao fruit!

One could only imagine the quality of the holy fruit!

In the past, a single nascent holy fruit had appeared in the eyes of the public. A Primal Ancestor had auctioned it off for an obscene amount of money, and the royal races in the Alien Lands had taken part in the bidding war for the fruit. However, that was a story that had happened several hundreds of millions of years ago.

Even though the other Primal Ancestor of the Otherworldly Mansion didn’t recognize the fruit, he had heard of it before. When Long Shengtian mentioned the name 'nascent holy fruit’, he jumped in fright.

A casual smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he noticed the looks of surprise on their faces. “It’s just two nascent holy fruits. I obtained them in the Sky Opening Island previously.”

The Cangqiong Dao Palace was filled with holy trees ready to bear nascent holy fruits!

Moveover, there were a ton of holy trees ready to bear nascent holy fruits that were tens of times more valuable than the ones they were holding, and Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less about the ones he gave Long Shengtian and the other Primal Ancestor!

Even though he didn’t count the number of fruits he had obtained in the Sky Opening Island, he knew that there were close to ten thousand of them.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have allowed Long Jianfei to eat his fill!

“Just… Just two nascent holy fruits?!” Long Shengtian stuttered.

After they swallowed the fruits to treat their injuries, Huang Xiaolong entered the main hall where the Primal Ancestors were waiting for his arrival in trepidation. None of them dared to move, and they couldn’t help but kneel when they saw Huang Xiaolong’s appearance. “We greet the Mansion Master, Huang Xiaolong.”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback when he heard their greetings. “Mansion Master?”

“Your Highness was a Mansion Master Candidate in the past, and now that Mo Zhi isn’t back, the position of the mansion master is left empty. That cannot be allowed to happen! Mansion Master Huang, please take the position and lead us!” Jiang Heng revealed a brilliant smile as he explained the situation to Huang Xiaolong.

Teng Xiao and the others nodded hastily in agreement.

As he glanced at the Primal Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong knew that all of them had finally agreed to submit.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly and spoke. “Alright. When Mansion Master Mo Zhi returns, I shall step down and allow him to regain his position as the Mansion Master.”

In fact, he didn’t plan on killing Jiang Heng and the others.

If he killed them all, who would lead the royal families? Was he supposed to exterminate all the royal families in the Alien Lands?

When they heard that Huang Xiaolong planned to return the position of the Mansion Master back to Mo Zhi, they were shocked. However, their surprise only lasted for a moment. Since there was no use harping on the matter, they quickly presented the treasures in their collection to Huang Xiaolong in a show of loyalty.

All of them were the treasures their race had held for a long time. They were reluctant to use the treasures for themselves, but they had no choice but to hand them all over to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at their treasures, but he wasn’t tempted to accept them. No matter how good those things were, they were useless to him.

With the countless holy fruits and the thousands of holy trees in the Cangqiong Dao Palace, there was no need for him to look at the treasures they presented.

The only things that could move him were grand dao treasures. Only items at the level of the Tree of Grand Dao, dao fruits, or grand dao sources could catch his eye.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong wasn’t accepting their tributes, fear gripped the hearts of the Primal Ancestors once again. They didn’t dare to retrieve their treasures, and they forced them into Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Seeing as the Primal Ancestors wouldn’t be able to rest easy unless he accepted them, Huang Xiaolong agreed to take them all. Whatever the case, he could just give them all to Long Jianfei.

Even though he had no need for the treasures, it didn’t mean that Long Jianfei would treat those treasures as trash!

When Huang Xiaolong finally accepted their tributes, the Primal Ancestors heaved a sigh of relief. They felt as though they had finally crawled out from the gates of hell.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong ordered those in the hall to call out their dao souls before leaving a type of grand dao mark on them.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Unable to go against Huang Xiaolong, they could only do as they were told.

When he was done with the matters in the main hall, he finally made his way to the holy prison of the Otherworldly Mansion. In the time Yuan Qianxing had stood in his position of power, he had captured tons of disciples from both the Human Race and the Purple Spider Race.

When he arrived at the prison, he saw that the treatment of those from the Human Race and the Purple Spider Race were horrifying to say the least. Their eyes and hearts were dug out from their bodies and they were tortured by the members of the royal families.

As he looked at the scene before him, the killing intent in Huang Xiaolong’s heart grew a little heavier.

After releasing all of them, he went to look for Feitian Longpeng and Feng Jiu trapped at the bottom level of the holy prison. When Mo Zhi had fled from the Otherworldly Mansion the other day, Yuan Qianxing had immediately ordered for their arrest.

“Your… Your Highness! Huang Xiaolong!” Feitian Longpeng exclaimed in surprise when Huang Xiaolong appeared. “Didn’t you…?”

In the past, he was greatly saddened by the news of Huang Xiaolong’s death.

Feng Jiu stared at Huang Xiaolong with her pretty eyes as a trace of shock flashed in them.

“Hahaha. That was a rumor Yuan Qianxing spread.”

Roaring with laughter, Feitian Longpeng seemed to have returned to his usual cheerful self when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “I knew it! Hahaha!” However, his expression soon changed. “Yuan Qianxing is currently working with Elder Ming! Even Mansion Master Mo Zhi lost to them and had to escape! Long Shengtian was captured by Elder Ming in his pagoda, and there is no one left in the Otherworldly Mansion to stop them! You have to leave immediately!”

It was obvious that the two of them had no idea about what had happened in the outside world.

Chuckling in amusement, Huang Xiaolong casually waved his hand to shatter the restrictions around them.

“There’s nothing to worry about. I beat Elder Ming so hard that his mother wouldn’t be able to recognize him. He ran away with his tail tucked between his legs, and I managed to capture Yuan Qianxing.”

“How are you still in the mood to joke around?!” Feng Jiu snapped at him. “Everything we said is true! You have to leave now!”

“I’m telling the truth too.” Huang Xiaolong snickered.

Several minutes later, Feitian Longpeng and Feng Jiu emerged from the holy prison. When they arrived in the main hall, they were greeted with a scene that shocked and terrified them at the same time. All the Primal Ancestors were waiting for Huang Xiaolong and they addressed him as the Mansion Master the moment he appeared.

“What?! Your matriarch is missing?” When Huang Xiaolong asked about Fei Yanzi, he was shocked to discover that she went missing!
