Chapter 3428: Solitude of the Strongest

“I smashed your palace because it was in my way,” Huang Xiaolong muttered indifferently.

“In your way?!” The other party was shocked. He thought that Huang Xiaolong would come up a whole load of bullsh*t in order to justify himself. Now, he casually brushed them off with a stupid reason.

The experts of the Kunlun Kingdom glared at Huang Xiaolong. As the strongest power in the Kunlun Secret Region, when had they ever suffered such disrespect?

Now, someone came along and razed the Kunlun Palace to the ground!

That wasn’t simply being disrespectful!

“Do you know what’s the crime of destroying my Kunlun Palace?! You’ll have to die a thousand deaths to atone for your sins!” The expert who spoke earlier glared at Huang Xiaolong angrily.

Huang Xiaolong stared at them coldly before snorting casually. “You’re not strong enough to punish me.”

One had to know that the Kunlun Kingdom was the strongest power in the region! There were several dozen Void Immortals among the experts present, and there were more than three hundred Tribulation Realm experts!

They roared in anger when they saw that Huang Xiaolong was looking down on them.

“Are you ready?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he noticed the anger in their eyes.

They stared at him in stunned silence.

“I only need a single move…”

One move!

It was then that the experts of the Kunlun Kingdom realized what he meant. Their expressions turned ugly.

Sword qi started to gather around Huang Xiaolong’s body, and he was like a peacock spreading his feathers.

When the experts of the Kunlun Kingdom felt the power surrounding Huang Xiaolong, they gasped in shock. The sword qi around Huang Xiaolong was unbelievably strong!

“Retreat!” The person who was screaming at Huang Xiaolong was the first to order. He summoned his special immortal armor, and everyone did the same. They retreated in fright, and all of them started to use their weapons to stop the sword qi from assaulting them.

It was useless.

Huang Xiaolong’s sword qi tore through their defenses like paper! Holes were blown through the armors, their bodies were like beehives, riddled with holes.

Blood filled the skies, and not a single person managed to escape unscathed. Even though he didn’t kill anyone, they no longer had the ability to chase him.

The structures below crumbled and Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered with the survivors who chose not to confront him previously.

Turning around, he left.

This time, not a single person dared to stop him.

The army that was stationed around the city looked at Huang Xiaolong’s disappearing figure and none of them dared to breathe loudly.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Pfft!”

Blood sprayed from the mouths of the members of the Kunlun Kingdom.

Even though he spared their lives, they wouldn’t be able to recover in a short amount of time.

They looked at each other and thought to themselves, “When did such an expert appear in the Kunlun Secret Region?!”

“Is he a Ninth Level Void Immortal?!” a Fifth Level Void Immortal gasped.

“No…” someone else gasped. “He… He might not be a match for our great emperor, but he’s definitely close!”

The experts of the Kunlun Secret Region trembled in fear.

The Kunlun Emperor was the strongest person in the Kunlun Secret Region! He single-handedly built the Kunlun Kingdom, and he was a revered existence.

Now that someone comparable to him in strength had appeared, they were flustered.

“Hurry up and report this to the great emperor!” the Sixth Level Void Immortal stood out and ordered.

The Kunlun Emperor wasn’t in the kingdom, and he had left for the Golden Dragon Mountain Range more than a month ago. After he heard the news of the appearance of the treasure, he brought many experts over.

As such, there weren’t too many experts capable of stopping Huang Xiaolong.

Or so they thought.

After the experts made the report, someone muttered softly, “Can he be going to the Golden Dragon Mountain Range?”

They stared at each other in shock.

“Looking at the direction he’s headed, he might be!”

The news of Huang Xiaolong defeating the members of the Kunlun Kingdom shook the region not too long after he left.

“Who in the world is that guy? He’s too damn arrogant! He dares to destroy the Kunlun Palace, and from what we’ve seen, it can’t be fixed!”

“What about the experts stationed in the palace? What happened to the Kunlun Army?”

“Chen Yuqing, Chen Rui, and several hundred others were sent flying with a single strike! They suffered serious injuries and the army didn’t dare to hold the outsider back!”

Gasps of shock could be heard.

Chen Yuqing was a Sixth Level Void Immortal! Chen Rui was a Fifth Level Void Immortal, and one could only imagine how strong the assailant was if he could send everyone flying!

When everyone was speculating about Huang Xiaolong’s identity, many people deduced that he was heading towards the Golden Dragon Mountain Range.

“The Golden Dragon Mountain Range gave birth to an absolute treasure! The Kunlun Kingdom, Heartless Valley, Wind Dragon Valley, Hundred Extinction Immortal Gate, and Nine Nether Immortal Gate sent their men over! No one dares to enter the area now, and it’s clear that he’s there for the ancient treasure! We’re in for a good show this time!”

Many powers were celebrating happily.

As the powers sealed off the mountain range the moment news of the treasure was heard, the powers in the Kunlun Secret Region could only swallow their rage.

Of course, the members of the Kunlun Kingdom received the news of Huang Xiaolong’s actions.

The Kunlun Emperor swept his gaze across those present and asked, “What do you think about this newcomer?”

“His background is mysterious, and he shouldn’t be someone from our Kunlun Secret Region”

“Elder Li, do you think he’s an outsider? The entrance to our Kunlun Secret Region isn’t open yet… How did he enter?”

The Kunlun Emperor stood up all of a sudden and approached the cliff before him. As the wind blew against his dragon robes, the power of an absolute monarch filled the lands. “I will personally welcome him. Let’s see if he’s as strong as Chen Yuqing says…”

The experts of the kingdom bowed.

“Your Majesty is almighty!”

The Kunlun Emperor had reigned supreme for countless years, and he hadn’t met an opponent worthy of being his match.

That was the solitude the strongest had to endure!

Half a day later…

A streak of light tore through the skies and the snow parted to make way for him. The sword light stopped before the Golden Dragon Mountain Range.

A smile could be seen on Huang Xiaolong’s face the moment he arrived. From the buzzing of the Pangu Sword below him, it was clear the Pangu Axe was near.

He could feel that there was a terrifying power sealed beneath the mountain range.

There was only one item in the Pangu World that could possess such power.

As it turned out, the Pangu Axe was hidden below the mountain range!

However, the experts of the various factions charged towards him the moment he arrived.
