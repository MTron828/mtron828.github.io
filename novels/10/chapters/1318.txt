Yao Chi’s scared and trembling expression made Huang Xiaolong laugh loudly.

Yao Chi pretended to be angry after hearing the smugness in Huang Xiaolong’s laughter, and admonished, “You’re so bad. You only know how to bully me.”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression was full of wide-eyed innocence as he offered in return, “You can also bully me.”

But in the end, Huang Xiaolong didn’t manage to stay for three months,as he was summoned back to the Fortune Divine Kingdom by Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor on the ninth day.

Both of his Masters did not mention any reason for summoning him, when they sent the message in the communication talisman. They merely told him to return immediately.

Huang Xiaolong looked helplessly at Yao Chi, and saw the corners of Yao Chi’s lips raised in a faint smile.

Huang Xiaolong gritted his teeth ‘hatefully,’ “Just you wait, the next time I come, it’ll be three years.”

Three years!

Yao Chi trembled involuntarily.

Huang Xiaolong’s laughter echoed in the air as he sped away.

Yao Chi stood for a long time on the same spot as she watched Huang Xiaolong until he disappeared from her sight.

Huang Xiaolong returned to the Fortune Divine Kingdom on the little cow, and headed straight to the Assembly Shrine. However, when he arrived, he was surprised to see that Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor had additional company. Sky Sword Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, Lightning Hammer Ancestor, and Gate Chief Zhu Yi were also present in the Assembly Shrine; so were Zhu Feng, Wang Wei, Luo Yunjie, Tan Lin, and Zhou Xu.

Not to mention, Li Chaosheng and other Fortune Gate’s Grand Elders were also present.

The atmosphere in the hall seemed a little tense and heavy.

Huang Xiaolong grunted in his heart, ‘Has something big happened?’

When they saw Huang Xiaolong, their meaningful gazes veiled various thoughts.

The events of the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony had spread like wildfire. While Huang Xiaolong was at the Sea God City, he had pummeled the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s number one genius Li Zhi, the Black Region World’s Fortune Gate Wang Yu. And Guo Family’s Guo Gang was no secret at this point.

Above all that, even more startling was that Huang Xiaolong had actually transformed into a primordial blue dragon on the battle stage, and smashed the late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm genius Guo Jun into meat paste!

Guo Family’s number genius Guo Jun, a late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm master, was smashed into meat paste by Huang Xiaolong!

When the Fortune Gate had received this news, everyone was in an uproar from top to bottom. Many of the Fortune Mainland’s big families, and first-rank forces were astounded.

When Luo Yunjie saw Huang Xiaolong walk in, excitement and pride were shining on his face. He even gave Huang Xiaolong a look that said ‘you’re awesome, you’re f*cking awesome!’ Contrary to Luo Yunjie, Tan Lin, and Zhou Xu felt immense fear slithering up their limbs. Huang Xiaolong’s current strength could easily pinch them to death, if he wanted to do so.

Despite their diligent efforts in cultivation, neither of them had broken through to Fourth Order Ancient God Realm.

“Greetings Gate Chief, Masters, and Ancestors.” Huang Xiaolong walked towards the other end of the hall, and stopped a few meters away to greet.

Zhu Yi nodded with a faint smile on his face, then said, “No need to stand on ceremony. Xiaolong, take a seat.” He pointed at an empty chair at the side.

That seat was the first seat on the left side of the main hall, and the second chair was taken by Grand Elder Cheng Xiaoyuan, the strongest of all Fortune Gate’s Grand Elders.

Seated opposite from Huang Xiaolong in the first place on the right side was Wang Wei. On the second chair next to Wang Wei was Zhu Feng.

Huang Xiaolong was stunned, ’this...?!’

While Huang Xiaolong hesitated, Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, Myriad Flames Ancestor, and Lightning Hammer Ancestor all nodded warmly at Huang Xiaolong. Golden Brow Ancestor smiled and said, "Sit, it’s fine."

Only then did Huang Xiaolong acknowledge and sat down.

Zhu Feng’s expression looked a little ugly as he stared at Huang Xiaolong sitting on the first seat opposite to him.

Seating positions represented status, and Huang Xiaolong was placed on the first seat in the left row; didn’t that mean Huang Xiaolong’s status in Fortune Gate would be higher than him in the future?

Wang Wei was as calm as always, no one could see what he was thinking.

"Today, I have gathered everyone over here because there is something very important that I need to inform all of you.” After Huang Xiaolong sat down, Gate Chief Zhu Yi began.

Everyone turned their attention away from Huang Xiaolong, and looked at Zhu Yi.

“Normally, there would be over ten thousand years left until the Sealed Devil Entrance in the depths of the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield loosens, but we have received a message that some days back, something happened to the Sealed Devil Entrance. Numerous devils crossed over to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!” Zhu Yi stated.

Gasps of shock echoed in the main hall, Grand Elders in the hall were clearly astonished. Huang Xiaolong was equally shocked as there was a problem with the sealed entrance connecting to the Devil World in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield because this only meant that the devils were able to enter the Divine World!

Huang Xiaolong looked at Zhu Feng, Wang Wei, Luo Yunjie, and others. He could detect the shock on their faces, therefore it was obvious that they had just heard of this matter.

Whereas Golden Brow Ancestor, Blood Knife Ancestor, Sky Sword Ancestor, and other Ancestors looked calm, as if they had already learned about this matter.

“Gate Chief, do you know how many devils had rushed into the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield?!” The chief Grand Elder Chen Xiaoyun stood up and asked respectfully.

Zhu Yi shook his head, his expression solemn, “I’m not clear about the number, but it is a lot of them for sure. Most likely, the number of devils has exceeded ten thousand. From the description of various disciples at the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, the majority of these devils are Ancestor God Realm masters. There might also be devils above Ancestor God Realm.”

Devils above Ancestor God Realm! Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air.

If these devils with such higher levels run out from the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to the nearby world surfaces, the result would be catastrophic.

Even some super forces’ Ancestors would end up swallowed into these devils’ bellies.

“The surrounding world surfaces’ super forces have already learned about this matter, and some of them have already sent requests to their headquarters to send experts over to reseal the Devil entrance. However, until then, there would be endless streams of devils pouring out into the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield, and into the Divine World.” Zhu Yi went on solemnly, “Therefore, disciples are forbidden to leave Fortune Mainland, whether it is for tasks or experience.”

The atmosphere in the hall grew heavy.

Huang Xiaolong immediately thought of another matter, and blurted out, “Where’s Li Lu?!”

That Black Ice old hag had taken Li Lu to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Only then did the other Ancestors and Grand Elders remembered Li Lu.

Myriad Flames Ancestor answered, “The second matter that we are going to talk about concerns Li Lu. After we learned there’s a problem with the Sealed Devil Entrance, we immediately tried to contact Black Ice Ancestor and Li Lu, but we were unable to reach them. It seems that we’ve lost contact with them.” His brows were scrunched deeply in worry.

Huang Xiaolong’s heart sank with a sense of foreboding after hearing that.

Did they run into those devils that had run out from the Sealed Devil Entrance?! Otherwise, situations where one loses contact were rare.

The more Huang Xiaolong thought about it, the likelier his guess seemed to be true, hence, he started feeling more anxious.

“Master, I must go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!” Huang Xiaolong stood up in a rush.

After learning that Li Lu might be in danger, no matter what, he needed to make a trip to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield. Not to mention, he had already planned to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield to search for the grandmist aura after the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony.

“Not allowed!” Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor shouted simultaneously. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Xiaolong, we’re just as anxious as you are knowing that Black Ice Ancestor and Li Lu might be in danger, but, the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield is too dangerous right now. Not to mention, your current strength is too low, and even if someone must go to look for them, it would be us.” Myriad Flames Ancestor persuaded.

“Master, this time, I must go.” Huang Xiaolong said with determination.
