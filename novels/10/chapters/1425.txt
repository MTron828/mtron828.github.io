“Yes, this is the Lord of Hell’s Netherworld King’s Jade!” The little cow said with absolute certainty.

Huang Xiaolong was still in shock, which was intermingled with ecstasy as he looked at the Lord of Hell’s Netherworld King’s Jade! Lord of Hell was a great master who once ruled over the countless experts of Hell’s three worlds. How could a jade token of such a person be simple?!

“This Netherworld King’s Jade is originally a top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact, moreover, it’s not your average top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact. It’s something that was born together with the Lord of Hell!” The little cow couldn’t keep up her false calmness any longer as she said this.

Top-grade grandmist spiritual artifact!

Born together with the Lord of Hell!

Huang Xiaolong was awestruck as he repeated these words in his mind.

Based on the little cow’s explanation, this Netherworld King’s Jade, in other words is...?!

As if she was able to read Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts, the little cow nodded her head and said, “That’s right, if you can refine this Netherworld King’s Jade, you might inherit the Lord of Hell’s heritage and become the new Lord of Hell! Of course, this is only my assumption, I cannot be certain, however, it is the likest possibility.”

The Lord of Hell’s heritage!

Huang Xiaolong inhaled deeply, making an effort to calm his roiling emotions. Still, he felt dizzy from the magnitude of all this information.

“Then again, it’s not easy to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade. This Netherworld King’s Jade is originally an extreme yin and extreme cold element grandmist era jade. Moreover, even I can’t guess the abundance and quality of the darkness element energy stored within it. I think a cultivator would need at least a supreme darkness element godhead in order to refine the Netherworld King’s Jade.” The little cow added.

Huang Xiaolong was relieved to hear her opinion, as his Archdevil Supreme Godhead was a darkness element godhead which would fit the requirement.

“Not to mention, there are layers of restrictive formations within this Netherworld King’s Jade, and each layer is difficult to break!” said the little cow.

Thus, Huang Xiaolong tried to circulate his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s godforce and channel his godforce into the Netherworld King’s Jade. Indeed, his supreme godhead’s godforce was unable to pass through the outer layer of the jade token’s restrictive formations at all.

As a result, Huang Xiaolong’s burning motivation was extinguished by half.

“But don’t feel discouraged. You have the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool, therefore, there is a high chance you could break the Netherworld King’s Jade’s layers of restrictive formations.” The little cow said upon noticing Huang Xiaolong’s defeated expression.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up and he asked, “Are you saying that as long as my cultivation advances to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, with the ability to control the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool, I would be able to break the Netherworld King’s Jade’s restrictive formations and refine it?”

The little cow nodded. “You can say so, but I can’t say for sure how many layers of restrictions exist inside the Netherworld King’s Jade. Not to mention, even if you break through to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm with the assistance of the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool, it doesn’t mean you would be able to pass through all of these restrictions right away because of their increasing strength. On top of that, in the later stages, you might need to collect other chaos lightning pools to help you completely refine the Netherworld King’s Jade.”

Huang Xiaolong’s brows locked into a frown. He would need to collect other chaos lightning pools?

Where was he going to find other chaos lightning pools in this boundless universe?

“Maybe you would come across other methods in the future, so, no need to dwell on it right now. As long as you advance to the Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, and break one or two restrictive formations inside the Netherworld King’s Jade, it would be considered as preliminarily refined. You cannot imagine the benefits.” The little cow continued to motivate Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong grinned and summarized, “In other words, I would be able to refine and absorb the darkness element energy from it to nourish my body and godhead?”

The little cow grinned in response, “That’s right, as long as you can break one or two restrictive formations, you would be able to absorb the darkness element energy from the Netherworld King’s Jade, though it will only a small amount, it’s enough to let your strength rise exponentially. The darkness element energy would continuously nourish your body and godhead, and your True Dragon Physique and darkness supreme godhead’s defenses would be unimaginable!”

Huang Xiaolong finally revealed a smile.

Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, is it? Huang Xiaolong’s fists clenched with determination.

“Oh right, if you merge the Giant Shark Flying Ship with the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship, would the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship’s speed increase?” Huang Xiaolong asked suddenly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The little cow blanked for a second, and replied while contemplating the question, “Yes, but it’s a little bit tricky and needs some time, and it’s really not worth the trouble. The Giant Shark Flying Ship would be wasted for an insignificant increase in the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship’s speed. In order to fully restore the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship, you still need to make a trip to Heaven’s Avenue for the materials.”

“As long as it can increase the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship’s speed.” Huang Xiaolong shrugged nonchalantly. “How long will you need to melt and merge the two?”

“With my unique technique, roughly a year or so.” The little cow made a rough estimation and answered Huang Xiaolong.

“One year.” Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Alright.”

Though it would delay their journey by a year’s time, as long as the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship’s speed would improve, they would require the same amount of time to return to the Vientiane World.

With that decided, Huang Xiaolong had the little cow proceed with merging the Giant Shark Flying Ship and Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship, and had Xu Baisheng, Xu Yong, Xu Jiang, and Xu Shi assist her.

Whereas, Huang Xiaolong himself entered cultivation, striving to break through to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm as soon as possible, as he wanted to break the Netherworld King’s Jade’s first few restrictive formations.

After some consideration, Huang Xiaolong decided to go ahead and refine the remaining three Sea God’s spirits, followed by the ten pieces of high-level God King Realm masters’ Buddha Pastes he had gotten from the auction.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about Wang Tong or other experts making a move on him due to Bei Xiaomei’s earlier warning to Wang Tong, as well as her display of the Silver Fox Commerce’s silver token.

He was safe in the Royal Buddha Great Worlds’ territories.

Inside the room, Huang Xiaolong summoned his three avatars to form the four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation, and began refining one of the Sea God’s spirits.

...

In the blink of an eye, five days had gone by.

Inside a luxurious residence within the Esteemed Buddha City, Wang Tong had just finished listening to a subordinate’s report that Huang Xiaolong had remained in his residence after the auction. Wang Tong’s expression was slightly warped.

In Wang Tong’s opinion, Huang Xiaolong was deliberately holding him on his promise, that’s the reason he was blatantly staying in the Esteemed Buddha City.

“Keep watching him, report to me if there’s any changes.” Wang Tong ordered one of the Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciples.

The Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciple complied respectfully, “Please rest assured, Young Lord Wang, as soon as that punk leaves the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, I will kill him.”

However, as soon as the subordinate had finished talking, Wang Tong’s palm landed on his face, sending him tumbling into the air.

The Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciple and the other disciples were dumbfounded.

Chen Xiao snapped at them, “Each one of you is as stupid as a pig! Young Lord Wang meant for you to protect that punk, make sure he safely leaves the Royal Buddha Great Worlds, and doesn’t die here. Do you all understand?!”

All the Venerable Buddha Sect’s disciples were shaking as they complied.

“Quickly scram!” Chen Xiao barked.

The disciples scattered in the blink of an eye.

When all the disciples had left, Chen Xiao cautiously observed Wang Tong’s expression before venturing, “Young Lord Wang, in truth, we don’t need to take that young girl’s words so seriously.”

Wang Tong shook his head, “You don’t understand.”

Chen Xiao smiled and agreed perfunctorily.

However, Wang Tong had not expected Huang Xiaolong to actually stay in the Esteemed Buddha City for a year. Even after the year had passed, Huang Xiaolong’s group hadn’t shown any signs of leaving.

With each passing day, Wang Tong’s impulse for smashing cups was growing stronger.

A year later, Huang Xiaolong’s group finally departed after the little cow and the others had finished integrating the Giant Shark Flying Ship into the Cauldron Dragon Flying Ship.
