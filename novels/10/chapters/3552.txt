Chapter 3553 – Something Must Have Happened To Them

Ao Wanshan hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. “Ao Ying and the others were said to be dealt with by the experts on Huang Xiaolong’s side within half an hour. Even if we join hands, we might not be his match. Let’s wait for Lord Kai Dong before anything else.”

Wang Zaixu muttered, “If we join hands, we won’t be afraid of half step Universe Gods! Huang Xiaolong isn’t qualified to be our opponent. Even though we need to be cautious when doing things, being too careful can be a sign of cowardice. We’ll miss a lot of opportunities this way.”

“Huang Xiaolong has close to two hundred universe-level spiritual veins on him! He might also have close to a hundred Star Dragon Scales left! If we manage to obtain his treasures, we’ll be able to enter the half step Universe God Realm ourselves! There won’t be a need for us to submit to the Creation Palace!”

A light flashed in Ao Wanshan’s eyes. He was definitely tempted by what Wang Zaixu said.

Indeed. Once they broke through, there was no need to submit to the Creation Palace!

“Brother Wanshan, Kai Dong will arrive in an hour at most! There’s no time to think! We’ll deal with the kid right now!” Wang Zaixu hurried.

With a resolute gaze in his eyes, Ao Wanshan no longer hesitated. “Alright, let’s go!”

The amount of treasures Huang Xiaolong possessed was more than enough to make anyone lose their minds.

The experts they led poured into the Tight Stone Forest as soon as they made the decision. They released their dao souls to locate Huang Xiaolong.

“Find him! We have to capture him before Kai Dong comes!” Ao Wanshan ordered.

The moment the words left his lips, he noticed a strange look on Wang Zaixu’s face. He turned to look in the direction where Wang Zaixu was staring, and he saw four people staring at him while standing on the peak of a mountain.

“Huang Xiaolong!” Ao Wanshan gasped in shock.

He looked around, but he was quickly interrupted by what Huang Xiaolong said. “There’s no need to check for hidden threats. We’re the only ones here.”

Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu were shocked by his honest reply.

Huang Xiaolong stared at them as they approached him cautiously.

“Ao Wanshan and Wang Zaixu of the Hundred Empire Alliance?” Huang Xiaolong laughed. “Did Tao Shi tell you to come?”

A look of confusion could be seen on Ao Wanshan’s face, but he inspected the area once again. It was clear he didn’t trust Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right! Tao Shi told us to come here!” Wang Zaixu started to circulate his grand cosmos energy as he distracted Huang Xiolong, “Bring all your hidden experts out now!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head as a chuckle left his lips.

Wang Zaixu attacked before anyone else could react. His speed was astounding as he arrived before Huang Xiaolong in a split second.

He planned to catch Huang Xiaolong off guard.

However, he discovered that Huang Xiaolong raised his arm casually to receive the attack.

A frown formed on his face.

Huang Xiaolong called him out by name earlier, and there was no way he didn’t know that Wang Zaixu was an expert at the peak of the grand completion stage. How dare he meet the strike head on? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ao Wanshan and the others were equally as shocked.

“Is he tired of living?” Someone in the Hundred Empire Alliance asked.

When they were still questioning Huang Xiaolong’s sanity, the two of them clashed.

Huang Xiaolong no longer held back as he released all 11 billion units of grand cosmos energy in an instant.

By the time Wang Zaixu felt the terrifying wave of power pouring towards him, it was too late. His expression turned to one of fear.

Boom!

The next thing he knew, he was flying through the air.

The Tight Stone Forest in the Unknown Lands had existed for countless eons, and the entire region was abnormally strong. Ordinary experts wouldn’t be able to shatter a rock no matter how hard they tried, but Wang Zaixu crashed through boulders after boulders after being struck by Huang Xiaolong.

He crashed into the depths of the Tight Stone Forest and remained motionless on the ground.

“Three… Three great worlds!” Ao Wanshan roared in fright.

Three great worlds, more than 11 billion units of grand cosmos energy!

The experts of the Hundred Empire Alliance were so shocked that many of them felt their legs going numb.

Even though Huang Xiaolong only had 1 billion units of grand cosmos energy more than half step Universe Gods, his combat strength far surpassed them! Not even three half step Universe Gods would be able to suppress Huang Xiaolong!

“Relax. As long as you submit to me and be my subordinate, I won’t mistreat you.” Huang Xiaolong suggested.

Waves battered against the hearts of those from the Hundred Empire Alliance. Some of them were tempted by Huang Xiaolong’s offer.

Ao Wanshan’s expression sank in contrast to the others, and he roared with rage at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, they are my loyal subordinates! Do you really think that you can make them betray me with a few words? What a joke!”

“Is that so?” Huang Xiaolong approached the experts of the Hundred Empire Alliance and he spoke to everyone else other than Ao Wanshan. “Anyone who resists will be stripped of their bloodline and grand cosmos energy! You will suffer the same fate as Ao Ying and Ao Yan!”

Huang Xiaolong released the restriction around the Sun Moon Furnace to reveal the two sorry figures.

Gods of Creation were lofty figures, and they were standing at the peak of individual strength. If their bloodline and great worlds were sealed, they would be living a life no worse than death!

Ao Wanshan snapped angrily in response to Huang Xiaolong’s threats, “Do not listen to that man! If all of us join hands, we’ll be able to take him down! If we choose not to work with each other, he’ll capture us one by one! When that happens, he’ll do whatever he said to you guys!”

Ao Wanshan’s sudden outburst made the experts of the Hundred Empire Alliance steel their minds.

With a sneer leaving his lips, Huang Xiaolong no longer bothered speaking. He appeared before Ao Wanshan and sent a slap flying his way. Like Wang Zaixu, he was flung through the air.

The experts of the Hundred Empire Alliance who were about to listen to Ao Wanshan changed their minds yet again.

…

An hour later, Kai Dong and the experts of the Creation Palace arrived but failed to see Ao Wanshan and the others. A frown formed on Kai Dong’s face.

“Didn’t we tell them to wait for us here? Why don’t we see any of them? Could they have ignored Lord Kai Dong’s orders to surround the Tight Stone Forest?” One of the experts asked.

Kai Dong retrieved his transmission symbol to contact Ao Wanshan, but he failed to get a reply.

“Something might have happened to them…”
