Chapter 2712: A Flustered Yin Ming

“If he really has the Huang Long Bloodline, that will be great!” Yin Ming roared with laughter all of a sudden. “Brother Duan Feng, the heavens have given us a second chance!”

Duan Feng was stunned.

“If we capture him and refine his bloodline, wouldn’t we have struck the jackpot?!” Yin Ming continued.

Duan Feng couldn’t believe his ears as he stared at Yin Ming with a confused expression.

“If we manage to refine his bloodline, we’ll be able to enter the Dao Venerable Realm for sure!” Yin Ming continued to laugh in delusion. Killing intent started to emerge from his body as he failed to contain the joy in his heart. “Dao Venerable! That’s the realm of the gods! Even in the Divine Tuo Holy World, we’ll be able to do whatever we wish!”

Duan Feng’s expression sank when he looked at the delusional Yin Ming. All of a sudden, he felt that his teammate wasn’t as smart as he seemed. In fact, the Yin Borer King turned into an id*ot in his eyes.

Refining Huang Xiaolong’s God of Creation bloodline?! What the f*ck was he thinking?

Even if it was possible to refine the bloodline of the God of Creation, it wouldn’t be something Primal Ancestors like them could do. After all, they couldn’t even defeat the man when he was in the True Saint Realm! Even if Dao Venerables showed up, they might not be able to refine Huang Xiaolong’s bloodline! Only the strongest of Dao Venerables stood a chance…

Moreover, they didn’t even know if they could survive the oncoming assault by Huang Xiaolong! Even with his strength, Duan Feng was nearly killed in the previous exchange!

Huang Xiaolong had long since obtained the advantage in the battle.

When Yin Ming noticed the strange look on Duan Feng’s face, he felt as though a bucket of cold water was poured over his head. “Brother Duan Feng, you…?”

Ignoring Yin Ming, Duan Feng turned to Huang Xiaolong and yelled, “Mansion Master Huang, I am willing to end this battle here! Are you willing to do the same?”

“End the battle?!” Yin Ming and Huang Xiaolong were both shocked at Duan Feng’s sudden outburst. It was especially so for Yin Ming, who was thinking about taking Huang Xiaolong down and refining his bloodline.

“Brother Duan Feng, you… We are high-level Primal Ancestors!” Yin Ming started to panic. “He’s just a Triue Saint! How can you agree to stop fighting now?!”

According to him, Duan Feng was crazy!

However, Duan Feng ignored Yin Ming as he turned to stare at the other party with a cold gaze. He was already a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor when he had left the Divination Creed, and his status was way higher than both Yin Ming and Elder Ming. He knew about the legends revolving around the God of Creation’s bloodline, and he knew some secrets about it. He knew what it meant to run into someone with the Huang Long Bloodline.

As such, he was extremely fearful. He wasn’t afraid of the strength Huang Xiaolong was showing, but he was afraid of the existence behind Huang Xiaolong!

“Alright,” Huang Xiaolong interrupted his thoughts all of a sudden. “I’ll agree to stop the battle if you submit to me!”

Huang Xiaolong could see that Duan Feng wasn’t actually part of the Yin Borer Race, and he had only helped out because of his relationship with Yin Ming. Since the other party wanted to stop the battle, it would be great to gain a follower at the high-level Primal Ancestor Realm.

However, Yin Ming roared with laughter when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said. He looked at Huang Xiaolong like he was looking at a clown and sneered, “Huang Xiaolong, did you suffer some sort of brain damage when you were slammed into the ground just now? You have to be dreaming if you wish to take a high-level Primal Ancestor as your subordinate.”

According to Yin Ming, Huang Xiaolong’s desire to take Duan Feng as his subordinate was nothing more than a joke.

However, Duan Feng’s next words destroyed everything he knew about life. “I agree to submit to you and become your follower!”

Yin Ming’s laughter stopped suddenly as he turned to look at Duan Feng with a dumbfounded expression.

Did I hear wrong?!

Duan Feng, an existence stronger than him, agreed to submit to Huang Xiaolong?!

He agreed to submit with a single sentence from Huang Xiaolong… Is that even possible?

Yin Ming wasn’t the only one who was shocked. The ancestors of the various races couldn’t believe what they just heard.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The moment the words left Duan Feng’s lips, Yuan Wanfei made up his mind. He chose to escape. Unlike the ancestors of the various races, he knew that there was only one way things would turn out after the battle. Others might be able to live, but Huang Xiaolong would never choose to spare him!

“Brother Duan Feng, are you serious?” Yin Ming couldn’t help but ask.

That wasn’t part of their plan!

However, a sinister thought flashed in his mind. Perhaps, Duan Feng was pretending to submit to Huang Xiaolong. After gaining the other party’s trust, Duan Feng would make his move and capture the kid!

When he thought about it, Yin Ming’s heart started to pound with excitement.

Duan Feng stared at Yin Ming and didn’t respond.

“Alright. Make your oath now.” Huang Xiaolong was shocked by the sudden change in situation, but he knew that he had to see things through in case they were plotting against him.

“Sure!” Duan Feng promised, and he quickly made the oath in the name of the grand dao that he would serve under Huang Xiaolong, and he swore to never betray Huang Xiaolong under any circumstances. If he did, he would be punished in the most gruesome way possible.

Yin Ming, who thought that Duan Feng was merely putting on a show, couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath when he heard the oath.

“Brother Duan Feng, this…?”

Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the thorough oath sworn by Duan Feng, and he couldn’t help but feel that a large stone was lifted off his chest.

Since Duan Feng, the strongest opponent he had to face, had submitted, it was time to deal with the other. He turned to Yin Ming, a gold gaze flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Before anyone could react, Yin Ming’s figure started to blur as he turned into a tiny worm. A chilly light emerged from the body of the tiny worm and everyone managed to observe its pitch black appearance.

That was the true form of Yin Ming, an Yin Borer!

The Yin Borer was an organism who thrived in the frigid lands, and it was a terrifying existence.

However, Yin Ming didn’t plan on attacking Huang Xiaolong after transforming. Instead, he turned tail and fled into the distance.

The moment he escaped, Huang Xiaolong and Duan Feng rushed over in an attempt to stop him.

As for the other ancestors, they stared at the scene that played out before their eyes with a dumbfounded expression. The Yin Borer King ran away?!

Mo Zhi and the others who didn’t expect the battle to end like this looked at each other with question marks popping up in their minds.

This…?

None of them managed to understand what had just happened.

Previously, they had felt that after Huang Xiaolong was beaten into the ground, they would suffer a fate worse than death.

However, the change happened too quickly.

“Should we give chase?” Long Shengtian muttered all of a sudden.

After thinking for a moment, Mo Zhi stopped them. “There’s no need for us to go over. With our strength, we might even cause trouble for Xiaolong if we join in the battle.”

Several moments later, Huang Xiaolong returned with Duan Feng.

The moment he returned, Mo Zhi and the others rushed over to welcome his triumphant return.

“Young Lord, where’s the Yin Borer King?” Long Shengtian asked in excitement.

“He ran away,” Huang Xiaolong spoke and everyone’s expression changed instantly.

Of course, Huang Xiaolong was extremely displeased with the fact that Yin Ming managed to escape. After all, the other party was a high-level Primal Ancestor. Coupled with the fact that he had a dao artifact capable of hiding himself, it would be extremely hard for Huang Xiaolong or Duan Feng to discover his presence.

Now that Yin Ming had managed to escape, things might get troublesome.
