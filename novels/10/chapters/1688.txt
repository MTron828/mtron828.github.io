Chapter 1689: Precisely Ten Days

 

In a split second, the Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard was sucked into the wind vortex, and it roared in a fury. Glaring streaks of lightning enveloped its body, breaking the layers of wind vortex’s restraint as it aimed to pounce on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t at all flustered, watching this. Within the wind vortex, numerous wind blades emerged and slashed the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard into several pieces. 

But the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard did not die even after it was slashed into several pieces. The lightning on its body crackled intensely, and it seemed like its dismembered body was going to fuse.

These Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards’ thunder godforce consisted of the ability to recover and fuse!

This came as a surprise to Huang Xiaolong.

This kind of thunder ability was rare, and it bore some similarities to the little cow’s purple lightning power.

Then again, Huang Xiaolong would not stand back and watch the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard fused back together. About the same time, the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard was close to recovering, numerous giant wind blades slashed through it a second time. Following this, streaks of divine lightning within the wind vortex bombarded it. In the blink of an eye, the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard was drowned in the sea of lightning. 

The Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard lost its only chance to recover. It turned into a ball of energy, and Huang Xiaolong absorbed it.

As expected!

As Huang Xiaolong had estimated, this early Fourth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard’s energy was of the same quality as the Blackstone Monsters on the fourth floor. Still, it contained more energy, at least ten times more!Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Absorbing the energy from one Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard was equivalent to absorbing the energy of a dozen Blackstone Monsters.

As they watched this, the surrounding Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards became alert, and prepared to attack. Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were blazing with anticipation. After absorbing these ten thousand Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards’ energy, he would breakthrough from the peak early-Third Order to the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Huang Xiaolong’s figure spun in the air as he sucked in a second Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard into the wind vortex.

Although one of these Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards contained more than ten times the energy of a Blackstone Monster, killing them also consumed ten times more godforce than killing a Blackstone Monster. Due to this, Huang Xiaolong was in no hurry, and he took his time killing the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards one by one.

He would absorb the energy after killing one Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard and then kill another one.

Even then, Huang Xiaolong had to stop to rest for several hours, to recover his depleted godforce.

To avoid being attacked by the surrounding Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards while recovering his godforce, Huang Xiaolong executed space concealment, completely hiding within the void pocket. He only came out at his peak condition and started another round of killing.

The day passed by...

When Huang Xiaolong’s godforce was depleted a second time, he had no choice but to stop and rest. At this time, he had just killed his one thousand and sixth Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard.

He was still quite satisfied with his progress so far.

At this rate, he would be able to kill all ten thousand Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards within ten days. 

Counting the two and a half days he took to clear the first four floors, altogether, it probably won’t exceed thirteen days!

Huang Xiaolong remembered that Qin Fan had taken over five years and six months to clear the fifth floor.

On the next day, Huang Xiaolong maintained the same speed of killing the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopard as he had done on the first day.

This continued for the third, fourth, fifth day and so on…

As time passed, the number of Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards depleted from the fifth floor.

On the seventh day, Huang Xiaolong was enshrouded in dazzling rays of light as crisp breaking noises sounded from within his body. In the next second, his momentum soared.

He had advanced to the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

Even though Huang Xiaolong had foreseen that he would break through to the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm on the fifth floor, he couldn’t help feeling a rush of joy when he actually did it.

After all, ten days ago, when he had first entered the Holy Mountain, he was only a peak late-Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, and ten days later, he had broken through to the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm!

This speed was unprecedented!

Even Huang Xiaolong, who experienced everything himself, had a surreal feeling.

After Huang Xiaolong had broken through to the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, his speed in killing the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards exploded. Considering the previous rate, it would have taken him another two days to kill the remaining two thousand plus Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards. However, now that he had broken through to the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch Realm, Huang Xiaolong annihilated all of them in half a day.

Like the several floors below, after annihilating all the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in the air and adjusted his condition. He was in no rush to enter the next floor. 

While Huang Xiaolong was recovering his godforce after killing all the Wind Thunder Long-tailed Leopards on the fifth floor; Qin Huangzhong, Shi Yinyu, Song Litao, He Jingyi, Wu Deng, Peng Zhengfei, and others were still on the third floor.

Qin Huangzhong, Shi Yinyu, Song Litao, He Jingyi, and the rest no longer held back their strengths, going all out with their most powerful attacks.

“The three thousand six hundred and twenty-third beast!” Shi Yinyu counted as his palm shattered a bone beast, instantly killing it.

Qin Fan’s record was thirty-six days and four hours to clear the third floor, but according to his progress, he definitely could break Qin Fan’s record!

“Thirty-four days, no, not even thirty-four days, I can clear the third floor in less amount of that time!” The greenish light around Shin Yinyu intensified, and vigorous corpse qi slammed forth, raising sky-high waves.

“This time, the first one must be me!”

“I believe that I will be the first person this time!”

Qin Huangzhong also strongly felt the same. He was confident that he was going to be the first person to clear the third floor.

As for Song Litao, this pitiful child, exhausted the last shred of energy he had, killing the hell beasts in a frenzy. He, as the Asura World’s number one genius, had not gotten even one holy fruit! Not one!

Every time Song Litao killed a hell beast, he bellowed, “Your grandmother, if I don’t get a holy fruit this time, I’ll change my surname!”

He dared not dream of taking the first place anymore.

He hoped to get one at least holy fruit! One holy was good enough.

At this time, outside the Holy Mountain, the various forces’ experts waited quietly above the Nethersea. It had not been ten days since the ‘mysterious genius’ had entered the fifth floor, thus no one dared to take the risk to bet how long it would take the ‘mysterious genius’ to pass the fifth floor. At this stage, it was still too early to tell.

They were feeling a little bored when the Holy Mountain issued interminable buzzing and glaring rays, like an exploding sun, that reached the four corners of the Nethersea.

Everyone was stupefied as they stared at the shining sixth floor of the Holy Mountain, the rays of glaring light blinded their sights.

“This…!” Everyone was dumbstruck, and their minds went blank.

“The-the sixth floor! He, he has already cleared the fifth floor!”

“H-how long…?”

“It see-seems, t-ten days, exactly ten day! Ten days, he cleared five floors in ten days!”

“What about Castellan Qin Fan?”

“Castellan Qin Fan took five years and a little over six months!”

No one spoke again, the wind howling in their ears was loud and clear.

“I, I don’t want to live anymore.” Someone suddenly said.

“Then you can go die now.”

“Erm, then, it’s better for me to live on.” 

The news of the mysterious genius clearing the Holy Mountain’s fifth floor spread faster than wildfire.
