Chapter 2619: Huang Xiaolong, I’ll Kill You!

Huang Xiaolong felt a burst of joy in his heart when he noticed the evolution of his godheads. It seemed as though they were finally entering the top ten ranks!

However, he knew that the transformation had just started, and he needed even higher-quality materials!

“Twenty-nine!”

“Thirty!”

“Thirty-one!”

…

Huang Xiaolong continued his hunt as he devoured more and more saint attributes.

The howls from the experts from the four races turned from shock to anger, and they nearly went berserk.

As for Yuan Qianxing, his expression couldn’t be worse as his face was as black as the bottom of a pot when he noticed what Huang Xiaolong was doing. According to his estimations, he could deal with the Primal Ancestor Corpse Puppet within an hour. However, Huang Xiaolong’s strength had long since surpassed his expectations. There wasn’t a need to stop Hei Luo for an hour. It had barely been half an hour, and the experts of the four races were basically annihilated!

In the tens of minutes that passed, Huang Xiaolong devoured over thirty experts on their side! If he rampaged for another thirty minutes, then how many experts would be left?

Yuan Qianxing’s gaze solidified as another terrifying light emerged from his chest. The light filled the lands, and the faces of Yuan Wangfeng and the others finally eased up when they noticed the light.

“Inextinguishable Dao Heart!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in surprise.

Like himself, Yuan Qianxing had managed to form his Inextinguishable Dao Heart before reaching the Primal Ancestor Realm!

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t be more familiar with the light that filled the skies.

“That’s right!” Yuan Qianxing sneered at Huang Xiaolong. Anyone who wasn’t a Primal Ancestor was like an ant-like existence to him, including Huang Xiaolong.

Of course, he didn’t stop there. His complete dao saint godhead emerged.

As soon as it appeared, rays of multi-colored light pierced the heavens. A shocking pressure descended on the lands, and it was like the absolute ruler of the world was appearing to exert his dominance on the lands. Everyone could feel their saint godheads trembling in submission.

That was the Origin Saint Godhead that ranked number one among the godheads!

Even Huang Xiaolong’s saint godheads shook uncontrollably.

“Origin Saint Godhead!”

Huang Xiaolong’s expression finally turned serious.

As the top-ranked saint Godhead, the Origin Saint Godhead contained unquestionable power.

There was a rumor in the Holy World that if anyone could destroy the Holy World, it would be someone with the Origin Saint Godhead!

In the past, there were many people who had guessed that Yuan Qianxing possessed the rank-one Origin Saint Godhead, but none of them had managed to confirm their guess. Now, Yuan Qianxing revealed his talent for the first time!

With the Origin Saint Godhead propping up the heavens above him, the grand dao law from the origin of the world descended to cover a ten billion miles radius with the Chaos Essence Holy Peak in the center. The reason it didn’t affect a larger area was because of the Primal Ancestor Grand Formation laid down by Yuan Qianxing and the others before starting the assault. Otherwise, the fluctuations would affect the entire Otherworldly Mansion!

Returning to his senses, Huang Xiaolong frowned as he continued his killing spree.

As long as his saint godhead entered the top ten ranks, he believed that he would be able to suppress Yuan Qianxing even if the other party had the Origin Saint Godhead.

“Thirty-eight!”

“Thirty-nine!”

Boom!

A terrifying blast covered the lands when Yuan Qianxing slammed into Hei Luo once again. This time, Hei Luo was sent flying as he shattered countless mountain peaks in the distance.

The power Yuan Qianxing possessed was no laughing matter! He finally revealed his true strength!

Huang Xiaolong widened his eyes in shock, and there wasn’t a need to speak of Yuan Wangfeng and the others.

From what Huang Xiaolong had heard from Zi Dongping, Yuan Qianxing had managed to injure a First Resurrection Primal Ancestor when he was in the Sixth Heaven True Saint Realm. Even people who supported him didn’t believe that it was true.

However, the truth was displayed before their very eyes!

Focusing on his targets once again, Huang Xiaolong knew that all he had to do was to push his saint godheads into the top ten ranks! Even though he was surprised by Yuan Qianxing’s strength, it couldn’t affect him.

“Forty!”

When Huang Xiaolong devoured the fortieth expert, a terrifying wave of energy descended on him. It was clear that Yuan Qianxing had set his sights on Huang Xiaolong after blowing Hei Luo away.

“Die!” Killing intent surged in Yuan Qianxing’s eyes as he roared at the heavens.

Too bad for him…

Hei Luo might have been blown away, but he was still a Primal Ancestor Corpse Puppet. It couldn’t be denied that Yuan Qianxing was stronger than Hei Luo, but Hei Luo was a Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Corpse Puppet when all was said and done. He was millions of miles ahead of First Resurrection Primal Ancestors when it came to defensive abilities. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Another blast rang through the skies, but Hei Luo returned to battle instantly.

As a corpse puppet, Hei Luo didn’t care about his injuries at all! No matter how well Yuan Qianxing could control his emotions, he was utterly enraged by Hei Luo’s persistence.

He might have the Origin Saint Godhead and the Inextinguishable Dao Heart, but he was still a Seventh Heaven True Saint. It was impossible for him to deal with Hei Luo quickly.

“Fifty-eight!”

“Fifty-nine!”

“Sixty!”

When Hei Luo held Yuan Qianxing back, Huang Xiaolong decimated everyone in his way. The sixtieth person soon fell to Huang Xiaolong.

Even Jin Buji was devoured by Huang Xiaolong.

After refining so many saint godheads, Huang Xiaolong finally felt an intense jolt to his three saint godheads. Of course, something still seemed to be missing.

Ten… Perhaps twenty. Huang Xiaolong knew that he was about to experience a complete transformation soon!

Turning to weaklings like Yuan Yue, Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes.

Fear gripped Yuan Yue’s heart when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s sinister gaze. He felt powerless like a rabbit looking at a tiger standing right in front of it.

When they had first arrived, Huang Xiaolong was like a docile little lamb up for slaughter. However, he had turned into a terrifying beast that could end their lives the very next instant!

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t you dare! If you touch Yuan Yue, I will ensure that you die without a complete corpse!” Yuan Qianxing roared when he saw that Huang Xiaolong was planning to move against Yuan Yue. Even though he was held back by Hei Luo, he could still scream and shout at his opponents.

A light chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips as his figure blurred. He reached out to punch a hole straight through Yuan Yue’s chest and blood gushed out like a fountain.

“Yuan Yue!” Yuan Qianxing roared in anger.

Under Yuan Qianxing’s glare, Huang Xiaolong devoured Yuan Yue and turned him into another withered-up corpse.

“Huang Xiaolong, I’ll stop at nothing to kill you!” Yuan Qianxing roared as the aura around him started to rise once again.
