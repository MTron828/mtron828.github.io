Chapter 47: Sovereign Invincible Throughout!

Don’t have grade nine martial spirits? Huang Xiaolong listened to Marshal Haotian’s misunderstanding, shook his head, and smiled bitterly. After thinking for a moment, Huang Xiaolong said, “The truth is, it is not that my martial spirit doesn’t reach grade nine. I am worried about my martial spirit being exposed.”

Haotian and Fei Hou exchanged a glance; the Sovereign was worried about troubles that might arise if his martial spirit was exposed? In general, even if he possessed a grade ten martial spirit, he didn’t need to worry about this matter, right?

While Haotian and Fei Hou were still confused, suddenly a bright light shone from Huang Xiaolong’s body and subsequently, two small dragons, one black and one blue floated above Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Two oppressive auras that made the heart palpitate spread out from them and an aura that could sweep the world was exuded from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Both of them were dazed as they stared at the martial spirits floating behind Huang Xiaolong, their bodies trembling, not daring to believe the scene before them.

“Twin, twin martial spirits!” cried out Fei Hou in a shaky voice.

Sovereign’s martial spirit turned out to be the legendary twin martial spirits!

“A Dragon? Twin Dragons? Superb talented twin martial spirits!” Marshal Haotian quivered with excitement, his tongue knotted and he started to mumble incoherently.

Heavens, ah, twin superb martial spirits!

These are actually Sovereign’s martial spirits!

Both Haotian and Fei Hou became so excited that they felt faint.

Without warning, both of them jumped off their seats and prostrated before Huang Xiaolong.

“Sovereign invincible throughout!”

“Sovereign invincible throughout!”

They lauded the words every time they lowered their head in prostration, their usual calm and indifference lost in their excitement.

Huang Xiaolong was stupefied at the sight of Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou repeatedly bowing while shouting slogans. Speechless, he laughed bitterly in his mind. It’s just superb talented twin martial spirits, do you both need to be so excited, ah?

“Both of you, stand up.” said Huang Xiaolong finally.

But, both Haotian and Fei Hou did not stand up.

Marshal Haotian beamed in elation, tears welling up in his eyes as he said, “Sovereign, superb martial spirits, this is Heaven’s blessing to our Asura’s Gate, ah! Our Asura’s Gate will definitely rise again, rebuilding our past glory!”

Superb twin martial spirits!

Such a rare talent, not to mention the Duanren Empire or even the entire Snow Wind Continent, neither had one since they were so very few!

The Duanren Empire was built over two thousand years ago, and yet to date, there hadn’t been even one twin martial spirit emerging in its history.

Fei Hou was no exception, babbling nonsensically to himself.

It took ten minutes for their excitement to subside a bit before both of them were willing to stand up, but they still had not fully calmed down.

“The matter about my martial spirits must not be leaked out.” Huang Xiaolong reminded when Haotian and Fei Hou stood up.

“Sovereign, rest assured. Even if we die, we will not say a word about Sovereign’s martial spirits!” Fei Hou and Haotian once again knelt down in an oath.

Huang Xiaolong nodded: he revealed this secret because he trusted them due to the fact Fei Hou and Haotian were absolutely loyal to Asura’s Gate.

Huang Xiaolong told them to rise and asked, “Can you tell me the grade of my twin martial spirits?”

Haotian and Fei Hou were stunned and exchanged a look between themselves, but neither of them spoke. Some time passed before Haotian finally opened his mouth, saying seriously, “In general, black dragon martial spirits are graded ten. However, from what I can see, this black dragon differs from the usual black dragon. Sovereign’s black dragon should be a variation and as for the blue dragon, there is no record of it.”

“No record?” Huang Xiaolong was astounded.

“Yes, Sovereign. In the Snow Wind Continent, there hasn’t been a time where a blue dragon martial spirit appeared before. Although I can’t determine the grade of Sovereign’s blue dragon, I can say that the blue dragon is much stronger than the black variant dragon.” Haotian said.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised, a blue dragon martial spirit had never appeared on the Snow Wind Continent? Does this mean his blue dragon is unique, one of a kind?

Then Huang Xiaolong asked more questions about black dragon martial spirits.

A while later, both Haotian and Fei Hou left.

After both of them left, Huang Xiaolong remained seated in the garden musing. Although he was unable to determine his martial spirits grade, he could confirm that it was above grade twelve. Huang Xiaolong then thought of Duanren Empire’s Imperial City Battle, and Asura’s Gate internal strife, and in the end, Li Lu crossed his mind.

“Better not to think too much about these things, it’s better to train harder.” Huang Xiaolong stood up– he wanted to break through to Sixth Order before enrolling into the Cosmic Star Academy.

Huang Xiaolong returned to his room and took out the cold jade bed, he sat on the bed and began to run Asura Tactics while the twin dragons appeared behind him, devouring the emerging netherworld spiritual aura.

Battle qi roared in his meridians and veins and crashed against the sixth order barrier.

The situation continued like this as time flowed on without notice. Then, out of nowhere, a crack resembling the sound of an egg shell breaking that only Huang Xiaolong could hear broke the silence.

Joy was evident in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

Sixth Order breakthrough!

Battle qi flowed into wider meridians in waves through the body, flooding it with thicker battle qi.

The night passed.

Huang Xiaolong came out of his room, did some light warm-ups, and headed to the garden. His palm suddenly struck an iron stake; and a one-inch dent with his palm print appeared on the iron stake, making it vibrate endlessly.

After advancing to the Sixth Order, Huang Xiaolong’s battle qi now is equivalent to a dozen stones, and the strength of each palm reached two thousand jin.

At the same time, Huang Xiaolong noticed that when his palm struck out, his muscles’ explosive power was higher than it used to be and was much firmer.

To test his power and strength after advancing to the Sixth Order, Huang Xiaolong leaped up, the twin blades appearing in Huang Xiaolong’s hand, and he swung down. A myriad of sword rays transformed into a violent rain storm dominating the yard, the wind whistling as loud as thunder.

Despite that, the strange thing was that even though the whole yard was in the storm area, the grass and flowers weren’t affected, leading one to think that the attack did not affect the ground.

After the first strike, Huang Xiaolong swung the second strike; this time the myriad of sword lights became drizzles and each drop the size of a small fly. Without truly focusing, it was difficult to hear the sound of it. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The past few months of practice had increased his comprehension made understanding of Tears of Asura to rise even more.

He repeated this routine and two days were gone in a blink.

In these past two days, Huang Xiaolong did not once leave the yard. All his time was spent practicing the Asura Tactics, the Body Metamorphose Scripture, and the Tears of Asura.

On the third day, Marshal Haotian came to see Huang Xiaolong with a recommendation letter for the Cosmic Star Academy.

He stayed for a while, highlighting the things that Huang Xiaolong needed to pay attention to and then arranged for the same bodyguards to follow Huang Xiaolong and Fei Hou to Cosmic Star Academy for enrollment.

The Cosmic Star Academy was located to the north of Royal City’s center, not too far from the Marshal’s Mansion. One hour later, the group of four arrived at the huge Cosmic Star Academy gates.

What depressed Huang Xiaolong was that the moment he arrived, he ran into Li Lu’s group who were there for the same reason.

“Xiaolong!” exclaimed Li Lu when she spotted Huang Xiaolong at the gates, and just like she did the previous day, she ran into his arms.
