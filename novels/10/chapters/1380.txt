"When is the headquarters recruiting emperor rank godhead disciples?" Huang Xiaolong asked. It was not a bad idea if he could enter the Fortune Gate’s headquarters.

The identity as a disciple of the Fortune Gate headquarters’ disciple would add a layer of protection to him, and give him an opportunity to get close to the Fortune Divine Artifact. Thirdly, he could widen his horizon.

The Vientiane World surface was only a small corner in the far edge of the Divine World. The Vientiane World surface was equivalent to a poor village in an isolated corner in this vast Divine World.

Since advancing to the Ancestor God Realm, Huang Xiaolong had been aiming to step out from this far-off corner of the Divine World onto a bigger stage.

“It has already started.” Blood Knife Ancestor stated. “However, the headquarters’ current assessment is different from the past. This time, the headquarters is recruiting disciples by batches, and the recruitment process will span over thirty years. Hence, as long as you register within thirty years, it would be fine!”

Thirty years! Huang Xiaolong was relieved to hear that.

In that case, he would have ample time to go to the Royal Buddha Great Worlds and get a Buddha Pellet for Li Lu, before heading to the Fortune Gate Headquarters. It probably would take less than fifteen years for a roundtrip. He could then register to participate for the headquarters’ assessment after that.

“The Fortune Gate’s headquarters’ Elders and even Grand Elders will appreciate you based on your talent. Moreover, as a headquarters’ disciple, you would have a bigger chance of participating in the Battle of the Heavenly Court!” Said Golden Brow Ancestor. “More than ten thousand of the most elite geniuses of the Divine World participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, but the quotas are mostly allocated to the super forces’ headquarters. Branches like us hardly have any chances to get any quota.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded, but he asked curiously, “Masters, how much do you know about the headquarters?”

Both Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor shook their heads.

“We never got a chance to go to the headquarters, thus, we know very little about how the headquarters operate. However, we have learnt from other branches that Fortune Gate headquarters’ Emperor Disciple is a supreme godhead genius!”

"Supreme godhead genius!" Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered.

"Yes, that is our emperor’s disciple, the biggest talent in our Fortune Gate’s headquarters and all Fortune Gate branches’ disciples. He has the legendary supreme godhead. His talent is infinite within the whole Divine World. He’s one of the acknowledged peerless geniuses of the Divine World.” Blood Knife Ancestor added.

“Do Masters know which supreme godhead he has?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“This I don’t know. In the whole Fortune Gate headquarters, only the Fortune Gate headquarters’ Gate Chief and Ancestors know about it." Blood Knife Ancestor said as he shook his head.

"What is his name?" A person’s name appeared in Huang Xiaolong’s mind—Fang Chu!

Could this Emperor’s disciple be Fang Chu?

"We only know the Fortune Gate’s Gate Chief’s surname is Fang, therefore, the Emperor’s disciple must be surnamed Fang. We don’t know anything else." Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor both shook their heads.

Surnamed Fang!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed immediately.

Could it really be Fang Chu?

If not, how could it be so coincidental?

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong asked Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor about that Emperor disciple’s strength and others details, but neither of them knew anymore information about him.

"But, Xiaolong, although you only have the high emperor rank godhead, since you’ve obtained the grandmist aura and your True Dragon Physique can evolve continuously, you are not weaker than the Emperor’s disciple in terms of overall talent and strength!" Golden Brow Ancestor stated. “Even if you cannot be compared to the Emperor’s disciple, your talent amongst the Fortune Gate headquarters’ younger generation can be counted within the top ten!”

Huang Xiaolong could tell that his Masters were worried that he would suffer if his talent and godhead were lower than that of the Emperor’s disciple. Therefore, they were comforting him in advance.

“I know, Masters, rest assured. When the time comes, I definitely would participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, and get a good ranking.” Huang Xiaolong promised Golden Brow Ancestor and Blood Knife Ancestor half-jokingly.

Blood Knife Ancestor spoke, “Although your talent can be counted within the top ten in our Vientiane World’s Fortune Gate branch, don’t forget about the other enumerable in the whole Vientiane World. There are more than a hundred thousand for sure. We’re happy enough if you could participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court, and we won’t put too much pressure on you for the rankings.”

Golden Brow Ancestor nodded his head with a satisfied smile. “Your Second Master is right. The Divine World is vast and boundless, there are too many monstrous geniuses. Moreover, only the top ten thousand rankings in the Battle of the Heavenly Court would be rewarded. Based on the past results, only participants who were high-level God King Realm and above have gotten a chance to enter the top ten thousand!”

High-level God King Realm! Huang Xiaolong subconsciously clenched his fists.

Even though his strength could be considered as a hegemon in one part of the Vientiane World, he was still too weak in the entire Vientiane World. Thus, he needed to strive to improve his strength.

At the very least, he needed to breakthrough to God King Realm.

In the Divine World, only the God King Realm masters had the right to voice their opinions.

Huang Xiaolong learnt as much as possible about the Fortune gate Headquarters from his Masters before leaving. Additionally, he also gave them a lot of chaos spiritual pills. He then found Xiang Xun, void devil beat Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the others, and flew out from the Fortune Divine Kingdom.

Now that Huang Xiaolong knew the sea tribe had a top grade chaos spiritual flying ship, he couldn’t stay back any longer. He needed to get it before any unforeseen circumstances hampered his plans.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong learned from the Feng Family’s Patriarch Feng Kaiyun that the top grade chaos spiritual flying ship was called Giant Shark Flying Ship.

The body of the Giant Shark Flying Ship was the corpse of a chaos spiritual beast giant shark that was hunted by the ancient Sea God. A Flying Paradise Commerce’s forging master had refined the corpse by combining the numerous chaos spiritual iron, ores, and spirit stones to the build ship.

The ancient chaos spiritual beast giant shark’s strength surpassed God King Realm when it was alive.

However, Huang Xiaolong was a little upset about one thing. Feng Kaiyun had reported that the Giant Shark Flying Ship was heavily damaged in ancient times, which would greatly affect its speed.

However, Feng Kaiyun couldn’t estimate the decrease in the speed due to the damages. Only the ancient Sea God had used the Giant Shark Flying Ship, after that, it was sealed inside the Sea God Tower in the Sea God City.

I hope it’s not too badly damaged. Huang Xiaolong thought to himself. If the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s damages were too severe then it would be useless since its speed would be too slow.

Guo Jin and Guo Family’s Grand Elders were assembled inside the Guo Family’s main hall, while Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards the Sea God City.

One of the Guo Family’s Grand Elder asked, “Brother Guo Jin, what’s the matter? Why did you call everyone here?”

Guo Jin smiled and said, “I have assembled everyone to announce a big, good news!”

All the Guo Family’s Grand Elders quieted down and their attention was focused on Guo Jin. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I’ve received Big brother’s message, and he said that seven of our sea tribe’s Ancestors have broken through to the God King Realm!” Guo Jin smiled widely as he went on, “And, our Lord Sea God Feng Yingying is leading them as they are rushing back from the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield!”

The Guo Family’s Grand Elders were in an excited uproar, and everyone was laughing loudly.

“Our sea tribe actually has seven Ancestors who have broken through to the God King Realm! This is heaven’s blessings ah!”

“Seven great God King Realm masters, that’s enough to conquer the whole Vientiane World. We don’t need to be wary of that fart of a Ten Thousand Elephant Clan!”

Guo Jin raised his hand, calming the excited Grand Elders. He grinned, “Everyone rest assured, Lord Sea God, as well as our sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs have already gone to the Fortune Gate. I guessed they would have taken over the Fortune Gate by now. Next, it would be the Wangu Clan, and Dark Elf Tribe!”

It was apparent that the recent developments from the Fortune City had not yet reached the other places, especially the sea tribe. Therefore, Guo Jin was naturally under the false impression that Feng Yingying’s group had successfully suppressed the Fortune Gate...
