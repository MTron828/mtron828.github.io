Chapter 3533: Black Sea

 

As soon as they entered, Huang Xiaolong and the others saw the two heads of the alliance, Chen Yizhen, and Lin Tong. Other than the two of them, more than two hundred Gods of Creation were waiting in the hall!

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong gathered all of them, and Huang Xiaolong could feel the respect they were showing.

However, those weren’t all of the Gods of Creation who joined the alliance. The number of experts they had was more than the Creation Palace, and they had nearly four hundred Gods of Creation under their banner. That was also the reason they were considered the only power capable of matching up to the Creation Palace despite the difference in the number of half-step Universe Gods. 

Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong welcomed Huang Xiaolong, and the banquet instantly reached its peak. They joked about, and they didn’t ask Huang Xiaolong about his relationship with the Star Dragon Couple.

The feast lasted for an entire day. 

The four of them were arranged residences in the headquarters, and they eventually settled down.

Starlight poured down from the void, and Huang Xiaolong sat quietly in mid-air. He felt a little uncomfortable that they gave him such a warm welcome, but he didn’t plan to look too much into it. After all, he only cared about the Universe Boat and the naturally formed worlds in the First Universe. He could also check if anyone in the First Universe possessed the Huang Long Bloodline.

The ceremony for them to join the alliance would be held in a year, and the four of them had nothing to do till then. They could cultivate in peace and stroll about the headquarters whenever they liked.

With the scale of the headquarters, they could explore the entire area for a year.

It went without saying that the alliance took a year to look into their backgrounds. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid that they would be able to discover his greatest secret as he dealt with everyone that could reveal the fact that he had three great worlds. Those who knew were either his friends or dead.

In the year, Jin Shenglin didn’t slow down in his pursuit of Wang Meiqi. Huang Xiaolong got used to it, but Wang Meiqi wasn’t.

The year passed in a flash.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of four officially joined the Eternal Heaven Alliance, and since there were four of them, the ceremony was unusually large. Experts arrived in a never-ending stream, and even Kun Feng of the Creation Palace sent a subordinate over with some gifts.

There were two dragon-attributed universe-level spiritual veins among them, and they were as good as the Red Dragon Spiritual Vein he obtained in the past.

Even so, one could easily understand the reason behind the gift from the Creation Palace. There were four of them who joined the Eternal Heaven Alliance, but only two spiritual veins were given.

They weren’t the only ones. The Solitary Alliance sent a universe-level spiritual vein over as congratulations, and they were the third-ranked power in the First Universe. As they were established a little later, they managed to gather more than two hundred Gods of Creation under their banner. No one could belittle their abilities.

The ceremony ended, and the next day came.

Three universe-level spiritual veins were placed in front of Huang Xiaolong, and he turned into the Star Dragon Divine Tree. He sucked them in, and he started to observe them closely. The two spiritual veins given by the Creation Palace had something wrong with them. There were several high-level restrictions within, and it seemed as though Kun Feng personally laid them down. Not even Chen Yizhen and Lin Tong would be able to detect them.

Luckily for Huang Xiaolong, he had the Star Dragon Divine Tree. Otherwise, the restrictions in the spiritual veins would lay dormant in his body when he refined them. It went without saying that the results of that would be devastating. After all, restrictions laid down by half-step Universe Gods were not easy to remove.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly. There was no way Kun Feng expected him to be the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

After eliminating the restrictions in the spiritual veins, Huang Xiaolong started to refine them both. Since they were willing to part with such treasures, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t reject their goodwill.

As for the spiritual vein given by the Solitary Alliance, it was clean.

Several thousand years passed by the time he completed the refinement process.

In the years that passed, Wang Meiqi, Ao Guang, and Ao Shenghai had been cultivating quietly in their residence. They decorated the palace they were in, but according to Huang Xiaolong’s instructions, they didn’t put in too much effort. After all, they would only be there temporarily.

Jin Shenglin came over to visit Wang Meiqi every day, and so did Huang Zongquan.

On the day Huang Xiaolong’s group of four entered the alliance, Huang Zongquan returned from a forbidden land he was exploring. Since then, the two of them had been trying to gain Wang Meiqi’s favor.

In fact, there were more than the two of them who were interested in her. Huang Xiaolong counted more than several dozen who came more than a hundred times in the past thousands of years.

Chuckling slightly, Huang Xiaolong turned to Ao Shenghai and Ao Guang. “This is the first time I understood how attractive she is…”

“That’s because you interact with her every day…” Ao Shenghai laughed. “In their eyes, Wang Meiqi is an absolute goddess!”

“Did you find out anything about the Deep Sea Essence Stone, Radiant Horn, and the other treasures?” Huang Xiaolong asked. In the past few years, he named several ingredients he wanted in order to upgrade the Sun Moon Furnace and the Purple Lightning Peak.

“Your Highness, we managed to gather some information on them.” Ao Shenghai continued, “The treasury in the alliance possesses everything on your list. In fact, they have a ton of them!”

Huang Xiaolong gasped in shock. He didn’t hope for much when he made the list, but since the Eternal Heaven Alliance had everything he wanted, there was no need to look elsewhere. If he went out to search for them himself, he might use several million years to gather the treasures he needed!

Soon after, he asked about naturally formed worlds in the First Universe.

“There’s one in the Black Sea,” Ao Guang reported. “However, the Black Sea belongs to the Creation Palace, and if Your Highness wishes to go there, we will definitely draw their attention! It will be very dangerous if they make a move.”

“Moreover, the Black Sea World there teleports about. No one is sure of its location, and even if experts at the peak of the God of Creation Realm enter, they might not find anything even after tens of thousands of years! Your Highness, there is no need to risk going there,” Ao Shenghai continued.

Soon after, the two of them laid out all the reasons why they shouldn’t head to the Black Sea.
