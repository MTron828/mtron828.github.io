Chapter 3450: 2.5 Billion?

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t enraged when he heard the challenge. Instead, he laughed, “Alright, who’s coming up first? Why don’t you work together?”

Gu Yuan and Long Yi frowned while staring at Huang Xiaolong.

A trace of rage filled Long Yi’s heart. He glared at Huang Xiaolong and growled, “We don’t have to work together to kill someone like you!” He appeared before Huang Xiaolong with a shake of his body. “I, alone, am enough to kill you!”

His claws came crashing down towards Huang Xiaolong’s head after the words left his lips.

The power of nearly 2.1 billion units of grand cosmos energy descended from the void as it shattered the space around them.

The cave started to rumble violently.

As the master of the Dragon Cave, Long Yi’s rage could shake the entire space.

Seeing as Long Yi had already made his move, Gu Yuan chose to watch from the side. He wanted to watch how strong the arrogant kid was.

Huang Xiaolong remained calm as he looked at the giant claws falling from the skies. Revolving the Soaring Dragon Art, his first world started to rotate in his body. His fists flew out to welcome Long Yi’s attack.

A heaven-shaking explosion rang through the skies and Long Yi was sent flying into the mountain range below. He only stopped after landing countless miles away.

Gu Yuan stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. He didn’t expect Huang Xiaolong to be so strong!

“1.2999 billion units of grand cosmos energy!” Gu Yuan gasped.

Both Long Yi and himself were at that level. The number of people who could challenge them was close to none, and the only person Gu Yuan would admit as his opponent was Long Yi! Today, he found another one!

From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong seemed to be a lot stronger than Long Yi!

As the cave master of the Dragon Cave, Long Yi was a god-like existence! He was also the only Black and White Dragon in the universe, and his combat abilities were unparalleled! Even so, he was on the losing end when matched up against Huang Xiaolong.

When Long Yi got to his feet, he felt his entire body hurting as his claws trembled in pain.

He felt as though his claws slammed into an unbreakable creation artifact when they met Huang Xiaolong’s fists earlier.

Long Yi’s surprise was on another level compared to Gu Yuan. He didn’t expect anyone’s fleshy body to be terrifying to such an extent. Even with his one-of-a-kind physique that was regarded as unparalleled under the heavens, the youngster standing before him was several times stronger!

Long Yi widened his eyes as he stared at Huang Xiaolong. A trace of caution flashed through them.

Of course, he was merely cautious. He could feel that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t a God of Creation. As such, he didn’t think that Huang Xiaolong would be able to do anything to him.

Gu Yuan broke the silence, “Your strength has surpassed my expectations. You’re definitely stronger than both of us, but it won’t be easy for you to obtain the spiritual vein! If we join hands, we’ll be more than capable of defeating you!”

“Is that so? What makes you think that I used my full strength earlier?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Indeed. He only used the power of his first world.

If he used all three worlds, more than 3 billion units of grand cosmos energy would be released! Long Yi would have turned into mush!

No matter how special Long Yi’s existence was, it was useless against pure strength.

Gu Yuan and Long Yi frowned instantly. How could he be holding back? The strength he revealed was terrifying enough, and there was no way he was still hiding his power.

Earlier, he revealed 1.2999 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Unless he was a God of Creation, there was no way to be stronger… Or so they thought.

“Since you’re so sure, we shall work together.” Gu Yuan nodded at Long Yi, “What do you say?”

“Alright.” Long Yi agreed without a shred of hesitation.

No longer holding back, they released their aura completely. Long Yi’s body emitted brilliant rays of light that lit up the Dragon Cave. It was the first time Huang Xiaolong experienced the true power of a unique existence like Long Yi.

However, Gu Yuan’s revelation was more shocking to Huang Xiaolong. All six ancient bloodlines in Gu Yuan’s body were activated, and six heavenly rivers appeared above his head. It was as though he had turned into a true god capable of controlling the universe.

They snorted once before charging towards Huang Xiaolong in unison. All six pseudo-creation artifacts in Gu Yuan’s hand slashed at Huang Xiaolong while Long Yi utilized the dragon qi in the depths of the Dragon Cave.

A thousand black and white dragons were created from the dragon qi.

The combination of a soul-sucking darkness and a sea of endless white would bring despair to anyone who looked at them. They were also capable of attacking the soul.

Huang Xiaolong remained impassive as he looked at the two of them. With the Blazing Dragon Grand Art and the Soaring Dragon Art, two worlds started to spin in his body. A golden dragon appeared behind him and the might of a creation-level beast tore through the void.

Gu Yuan and Long Yu stared at the dragon behind Huang Xiaolong, and they screamed in terror.

“Golden Dragon of Creation!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother listening to their cries as he made his move. Of course, he didn’t use the Huang Long Armor Set or the Pangu Axe. He simply charged at them with his fleshy body.

Bang!

When he slammed into them, they felt as though they crashed straight into a massive holy world. The impact could only be imagined as they felt the bones in their body cracking.

Shooting through the space, the two of them felt their bodies breaking down. Not even their dao souls were spared.

They spat out mouthfuls of blood when they finally landed on the ground, and they disregarded their injuries as they stared at Huang Xiaolong in fear.

“You… How can you possess 2.5 billion units of grand cosmos energy?!” Gu Yuan’s heart was filled with terror as he asked.

If they knew that he was hiding the strength of his third world, they would probably feel a lot less amazed with his revelation. It was too bad they didn’t!

“2.5 billion?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. Slowly circulating the Pangu World Creation Art, Huang Xiaolong decided to show off a little.
