Chapter 2761: Transforming the Cangqiong Sacred Land

Huang Xiaolong gave the communication symbol to Long Jianfei so he, Mo Zhi, Fei Yanzi, Duan Feng, and the others could read the message.

Although Long Jianfei had received the communication symbol first, none of them had read it before Huang Xiaolong.

Long Jianfei and the others showed surprise after reading ‘the invitation’s content.

“The Spirit Devil Patriarch invites Lord Alliance Chief to discuss about coexisting peacefully at the Hongxuan Sacred Land?” Duan Feng sneered mockingly, “Only a ghost would believe such a poor excuse.”

“What does the Young Lord think?” Long Jianfei asked Huang Xiaolong and continued, “They must be plotting something. Although most people won’t dare to make any moves within the Hongxuan Sacred Land, there is always an exception.”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand nonchalantly, “It’s fine.”

Huang Xiaolong moved on from the topic and asked Long Jianfei questions pertaining to the Son of Creation. He also told Long Jianfei about the Son of Creation Huang Shuai.

“What?!! There is another Son of Creation called Huang Shuai?!” Long Jianfei was obviously very surprised to hear that.

Mo Zhi, Duan Feng, Fei Yanzi, and the others looked just as shocked.

This was the first time Huang Xiaolong talked about the Son of Creation Huang Shuai in front of others after learning about the matter from Yang Shangchen.

“Yang Shangchen, why don’t you tell us about it?” Huang Xiaolong said to Yang Shangchen standing behind him.

Yang Shangchen respectfully complied, and then spoke of what he knew to everyone.

After hearing Yang Shangchen’s explanation, everyone was surprised and baffled at the same time.

“That Huang Shuai is definitely a fake!” Long Jianfei immediately proclaimed his opinion with unwavering confidence.

“But, if Huang Shuai is a fake, how come the Dragon Fish Creed, Divination Creed, and the others did not notice it?” Fei Yanzi asked her doubts.

This was also the point that baffled Huang Xiaolong and everyone else.

“If I can return to the Dragon Fish Creed and see my master, maybe we will know what went on exactly,” Long Jianfei said seriously.

His master was a Dao Venerable expert within the Dragon Fish Creed, and being one of the Dragon Fish Creed’s higher echelons, he would know more details.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head as the Dragon Fish Heavenly Cave was a long way from the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave, and Long Jianfei wouldn’t be able to go back for a while.

Not to mention, there were still many things at the Cangqiong Sacred Land waiting to be taken care of. Hence Huang Xiaolong couldn’t leave the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave for the time being. However, he thought that they might get some clues from the Saint Devil Prince since the information Yang Shangchen knew about the Son of Creation Huang Shuai originated from the Saint Devil Prince.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered as he made a rough plan in his head.

The group flew as they spoke, and soon, the Cangqiong City’s outline emerged on the horizon.

Cangqiong Old Man was once again astounded looking at the transformed Cangqiong City. It was tall as a mountain and many times grander than it was before.

In the sky above the Cangqiong City were star meteorites hanging like the stars, forming a rotating Grand Cycle of Heaven Array. Strands of star power floated down, enveloping the entire city, forming a starry veil of illusion.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, praising Long Jianfei and the others, “You guys did a good job.”

He could tell that using these star meteorites to lay out the Grand Cycle of Heaven Array also increased Cangqiong Sacred Land’s spiritual energy. By cultivating in this place, one could obtain similar results as cultivating with the usual spiritual pills.

With the passing time, under the star power’s constant tempering, Cangqiong City’s environment would supersede Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s Tang Dragon City.

Long Jianfei and the others laughed happily after receiving praise from Huang Xiaolong. In order to expand the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s Cangqiong City, they had exhausted their brains and efforts in the last three months.

Upon entering Cangqiong City, Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man saw that the streets had been widened by three times their previous size, and the buildings all around had been rebuilt. Each building here was connected to the city’s grand formation, and Huang Xiaolong discovered that there was a steady flow of spiritual energy coming from under the city, ensuring that the city would be pleasant as spring regardless of the season.

“Is there a dragon flame spiritual vein underground?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“Yes, Young Lord. We buried one hundred dragon flame spiritual veins under the city,” Long Jianfei answered respectfully and added, “All of them are of the best quality.”

Long Jianfei knew that Huang Xiaolong had a dragon-attributed saint godhead, physique, and bloodline. Thus, when it came to choosing spiritual veins, he had specifically selected the dragon flame spiritual vein, which would benefit Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation.

These star meteorites and dragon flame spiritual veins were all taken from the Tang Dragon Sacred Land’s treasury.

Huang Xiaolong nodded as Long Jianfei and the others had put a lot of thoughts into this.

Although these dragon flame spiritual veins were not holy spiritual veins, they were infinitely close, and this kind of spiritual energy would help his cultivation in a small degree.

That night itself, there was a great celebration feast at the Cangqiong Headquarters.

As the date of the Spirit Devil Patriarch’s invitation was two months later, Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man decided to set off a month later.

With the Cangqiong Dao Palace, it would take merely twenty days or so to arrive at the Hongxuan Sacred Land from Cangqiong Sacred Land.

In the subsequent days until Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man were to set off to Hongxuan Sacred Land, Huang Xiaolong participated in the Cangqiong Sacred Land’s construction and focused on his cultivation at night. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Huang Xiaolong took out ten holy spiritual veins from the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and buried them deep underground below Cangqiong City. Then, he laid out a big array that linked with the Grand Cycle of Heaven Array in the sky. The two arrays complemented each other, and the result was obvious. In a short few days, the Cangqiong City’s spiritual energy had grown denser, and its effect even spilled to the land outside of Cangqiong City, nurturing every inch of the land.

At the same time, under the name of Cangqiong Alliance, Huang Xiaolong began outlining some policies and conditions to attract top trading houses and families to Cangqiong Sacred Land. These were then spread out by Cangqiong Sacred Land, Tang Dragon Sacred Land, Freezing Desert Sacred Land, and Ice Blue Sacred Land.

….

One month went by in the blink of an eye…

Following one month of reconstruction under Huang Xiaolong’s supervision, there were more noticeable changes around Cangqiong Sacred Land. Simultaneously, as the Cangqiong Alliance’s name spread, coupled with the policies Huang Xiaolong had set earlier, more and more trading houses and families opened branches in various locations around the Cangqiong Sacred Land.

One month later, Huang Xiaolong and his master Cangqiong Old Man set off to the Hongxuan Sacred Land.

There weren't many people in the traveling group this time. Other than Huang Xiaolong himself and Cangqiong Old Man, there were Duan Feng, Chen Qi, and lastly, Yang Shangchen.

It was a small group of five people.

There weren’t many people, but each of them was a high-level Primal Ancestor expert, except for Huang Xiaolong, who was merely a Ninth Heaven True Saint.

Huang Xiaolong and Cangqiong Old Man exhorted Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, and the rest with a list of tasks before leaving the Cangqiong Sacred Land under everyone’s send-off.

Cangqiong Dao Palace turned into a streak of light across the Divine Tuo Holy World’s starry space.

Standing inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace, Huang Xiaolong looked outward at the Divine Tuo Holy World’s space that seemed bigger and quieter.

His God of Creation Bloodline could sense the supreme will all around him.

Is this my father, the God of Creation’s will?

Huang Xiaolong’s thoughts were lost in space. A while later, he took out Tang Dragon Knife and Freezing Desert Mountain.

Tang Dragon Knife and Freezing Desert Mountain were dao artifacts that had accompanied Tang Long and Han Mo for many years. In the last few months, Huang Xiaolong had already erased the soul imprints on both dao artifacts and refined both dao artifacts enough to be able to use them.

He had been pondering to integrate these two mid-grade dao artifacts into the Cangqiong Blade to create a higher-grade dao artifact. It would be a new dao artifact with Tang Dragon Knife, Freezing Desert Mountain, and Cangqiong Blade’s powers that was compatible to him.

However, it was not easy to integrate dao artifacts; not only he would need Xuanhuang Water, but also several other kinds of innate treasures.
