Chapter 2401: Four Seas Holy Fruit

The Four Seas Holy Tree was located in a forbidden region deep in the Holy Gate. Under the constant care of the Holy Gate, a Four Seas Holy Fruit would mature every once in a while.

However, the number of fruits that would mature each time wouldn’t number more than three.

When Lu Ding heard Yu Fujiang’s comment about the fruit, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of irritation in his heart. It was no wonder he was so excited to visit the Four Seas Holy Gate. But as, it turned out, he was only there for the Four Seas Holy Fruit!

The more he thought about it, the more he felt his heartache.

The Four Seas Holy Fruit was something the Four Seas Holy Gate had managed to cultivate after spending a large amount of time and resources. According to his estimations, two fruits should be obtained this season.

Now that Yu Fujiang was heading over to the Four Seas Holy Gate, they would probably have to part with a single fruit.

“Hehe, that’s right. In just a month, the Four Seas Holy Fruits should be ripe. I plan to keep one for myself and give the other to Brother Fujiang.” Even though his heart ached from the thought of giving one of the fruits away, he could only maintain the smile on his face.

He knew that he needed to bring out some benefits in order to bring Yu Fujiang onto his side.

However, a frown soon formed on Yu Fujiang’s face. “I’ve heard that there should be two fruits that mature every season, am I wrong?”

Lu Ding was stunned for a second. His expression couldn’t help but change. Wasn’t Yu Fujiang forcing him to take out both fruits?! What a greedy b*stard?!

Of course, someone like Lu Ding had already lived for a long time, and he quickly regained his calm. “Indeed! There should be two fruits this time, but I am about to break through the twelfth level of my secret art. I need the Four Seas Holy Fruit to break through so...”

“Brother Lu Ding, you don’t have to worry about something like that! If you give me both fruits, I’ll invite an expert from my Beast Tamer Holy Gate to personally appear to help you break through the barrier!”

The smile on Lu Ding’s face finally froze. It was clear that Yu Fujiang was coveting both fruits. The matter about inviting an expert from the Beast Tamer Holy Gate to help him breakthrough was a blatant lie.

It was impossible for a True Saint to rely on external assistance to advance their cultivation!

Otherwise, it wouldn’t be difficult for anyone to advance up along the True Saint Realm.

“What’s the matter? Is Brother Lu Ding unwilling to part with a mere Four Seas Holy Fruit?” Yu Fujiang snapped when he saw the change in Lu Ding’s expression.

In the next instant, a brilliant smile appeared on Lu Ding’s face once again. “Brother Fujiang has to be kidding! Of course, I’m willing to give Brother Fujiang the other fruit.”

“Good.” A smile slowly formed on Yu Fujiang’s face. “Not to worry. I won’t take the fruits and not give you anything in return.”

“In the future, you can let me know if you meet with any troubles. My Beast Tamer Holy Gate will definitely send assistance.”

“Many thanks to Brother Fujiang....”

The two of them continued to chat as though they were best buddies as they made their way to the Four Seas Holy Gate. As for what they thought about each other, that was another story altogether.

One month later...

In the Four Seas Holy Manor, Huang Xiaolong finally concluded his cultivation after he absorbed all the holy essence energy contained in the statue.

After he completed the inheritance, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

This time, he had managed to gain a whole lot by receiving the inheritance. He not only had managed to push himself into the half-True Saint Realm, but he had even managed to start the creation of a Dao Heart during the tribulation process!

Even though the Dao Heart wasn’t complete, it possessed a trace of inextinguishable energy.

Slowly getting to his feet, Huang Xiaolong stared at the statue of the Four Seas Holy Emperor whose energy had been sucked dry. When he stared at the statue now, it was no different from those random statues crafted out of ordinary materials.

After bowing thrice to the statue, Huang Xiaolong left the Four Seas Holy Manor.

“Young Master, you’re finally out!” The two True Saints were overjoyed when they saw Huang Xiaolong emerging from the manor. The instant the gate opened, they jumped in joy.

“Congratulations on successfully accepting the Four Seas Holy Emperor’s inheritance and entering the half-True Saint Realm!” They didn’t miss a beat as they celebrated Huang Xiaolong’s success.

With a faint smile on his face, Huang Xiaolong asked, “Did anything happen in the Four Seas Holy Gate?”

Their expressions changed in an instant as they made the report to Huang Xiaolong.

“According to the reports, Lu Ding should be returning any day now!” The Departing Sword Sage reported, “We were afraid that Young Master wouldn’t be able to complete the inheritance by the time he returned. Now that you’re out, there is nothing for us to worry about.”

Now that Huang Xiaolong had accepted the Four Seas Holy Emperor’s inheritance, they could leave anytime they wanted.

“Young Master, should we leave now?” Chen Zhi asked. “Lu Ding had already sent a message to Yu Jingjian that he would be bringing the experts of the Beast Tamer Sect back to the Holy Gate. Yu Fujiang of the Beast Tamer Sect would be coming along with him, and there would be several True Saints accompanying them.”

With Yu Fujiang’s status as the leader of the Holy Princes of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate, there would definitely be several True Saint bodyguards by his side when he left the Holy Gate.

“Yu Fujiang...,” Huang Xiaolong sneered. “Since that’s the case, I’ll just wait for them here.” Of course, the reason he wanted to wait for Lu Ding and the others was because of the Four Seas Holy Furnace.

Hearing what Huang Xiaolong said, Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

Had their Young Master formed some sort of grievance with Yu Fujiang?

“Young Master, the Beast Tamer Holy Gate probably sent more than a single True Saint Realm expert.” The Departing Sword Sage tried to dissuade Huang Xiaolong. “They might even have sent Second or Third Heaven True Saint Realm experts.”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled as he shook his head. “It’s fine.” With the Darkness Holy Ring and the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, even if high-level True Saints came, he was confident of leaving in one piece.

As such, Huang Xiaolong quickly rode onto a profound beast as they returned to the headquarters of the Four Seas Holy Gate.

“Young Master, Yu Jingjian said that Lu Ding’s return probably had something to do with the Four Seas Holy Fruit!” Chen Zhi explained.

“Four Seas Holy Fruit?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned for a second. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yes, Young Master. Yu Jingjian even said that the Four Seas Holy Fruits would ripen tomorrow.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh. “It seems like lady luck hasn’t left us yet.”

Even though Huang Xiaolong had tons of holy herbs in his Darkness Holy Ring, with some of them being more potent than the Four Seas Holy Fruits, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t picky when it came to treasures. After all, the more the merrier.

Chen Zhi laughed. “When Lu Ding returns and realizes that the Four Seas Holy Fruits are missing, his blood would probably flow in reverse.”

Laughter filled the air.

When the three of them returned to the main hall, Huang Xiaolong asked Yu Jingjian about Lu Ding once again. After gaining a better view of the situation, he dismissed them.

One day later, he retrieved both Four Seas Holy Fruits and kept them in his Darkness Holy Ring.

When he was finally done Huang Xiaolong waited patiently for Lu Ding to return.

“Young master, they have already entered the Four Seas Holy Grounds. They should arrive in half an hour,” The Departing Sword Sage reported.
