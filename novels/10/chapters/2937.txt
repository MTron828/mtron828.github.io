Chapter 2938: The Strength of the Mystical Pavilion’s Main Pavilion Master

Poof!

He felt as though he was slammed by a train as his chest caved in.

Zeng Lei was a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable no matter what happened. His dao physique was much stronger than the other fallen Dao Venerables. With his giant blade, his chest managed to remain intact.

Together with the giant blade, he smashed into the ground heavily. The blade landed an inch away from his neck.

The experts of the Mystical Pavilion stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock. Fear filled their hearts.

Initially, they were hopeful that they would be able to come out of the battle on top. Now, their hope had vanished. Only desperation and fear remained.

“You… How did you grow so strong?!” Zeng Lei glared at Huang Xiaolong as he spat out a mouthful of golden blood.

He, a late-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable, was unable to block a single punch from Huang Xiaolong! The kid was a mere First Esteem Dao Venerable! If he was a Fourth Esteem Dao Venerable, Zeng Lei could accept the fact that he was defeated. He would accept the fact that Huang Xiaolong possessed the real Huang Long Bloodline. However, he couldn’t accept what had happened.

Even if Huang Xiaolong had the Dao Body of Heaven and Earth and Huang Long Bloodline, he should not have such terrifying strength.

Huang Xiaolong was indifferent and walked towards Zeng Lei. He said coldly, “What do you think?”

Zeng Lei struggled to stand up with the help of his blade. “I know you have eleven high-order Saint Fates and three dao souls! Even so, you should not have such battle power!”

Huang Xiaolong chuckled. He laughed at the fact that Zeng Lei only knew that he has eleven high-order Saint Fates and three dao souls. He has twelve high-orderl Saint Fates, and three small worlds!

He didn’t bother explaining himself.

“Kneel down. All of you, surrender to me,” Huang Xiaolong said calmly.

Everyone was taken aback.

Zeng Lei’s eyes flickered evasively, and he laughed grimly, “Huang Xiaolong, so what if you are the real Son of Creation. I will never betray the Mystical Pavilion and surrender to you! Our main Pavilion Master marked all of our dao souls! We will never betray the pavilion master!”

“Even without the restrictions, you must be dreaming if you want us to serve you. Humph, you can try to offer us supreme treasures in order to tempt us…” Zeng Lei said slowly.

“The branch master is correct! Huang Xiaolong, so what if you are the real Son of Creation? We won’t have to serve you because of that!” someone else spoke boldly.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in ridicule, “Zeng Lei, what makes you think I’m begging you to serve me? I gave you a chance, but I guess none of you know how to treasure it? Why do you think they submitted to me?” He pointed at the six beasts beside him and sneered.

Zeng Lei was stunned as he slowly turned to look at them. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Could it be?!” Zeng Lei was startled.

The eyes of the golden dragon behind Huang Xiaolong flashed brightly, and two majestic rays shot out. One of the Sixth Esteem Dao Venerables was trapped by the rays.

The rays soon disappeared into his body.

It took less than ten breaths of time for that expert to kneel down respectfully before Huang Xiaolong. “Xu Min pledges to follow Your Highness!”

Everyone was dumbfounded by the sight.

Very soon, the fear in Zeng Lei’s heart took over his sense of logic. He wasn’t afraid of Huang Xiaolong’s identity as the Son of Creation. Instead, he was afraid of Huang Xiaolong for what he could do!

“The entire Huang Long World was created by my father. Do you really think that you can imagine the might of the Huang Long Bloodline? If it’s unable to dominate every creature in the Huang Long World, it wouldn’t deserve its name!” Huang Xiaolong snorted.

Zeng Lei and the others felt their bodies trembling violently.

“What about the restriction by the main pavilion master?” A Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable asked weakly.

Zeng Lei and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong for a response.

Huang Xiaolong answered calmly, “It’s just a mere restriction.”

If he wanted to, he could easily erase it with the Huang Long Bloodline.

However, he didn’t do that. Instead, he fused his power with the restriction laid down by the main pavilion master.

That would allow him to control them without alerting the main pavilion master of the Mystical Pavilion.

He killed two birds with one stone.

Clearly, Huang Xiaolong did not feel the need to explain to Zeng Lei and the others.

Two more rays of light landed on two Dao Venerables behind Zeng Lei. They kneeled before Huang Xiaolong eventually.

The last shred of hope in Zeng Lei’s heart disappeared.

Waving his hand slightly, Zeng Lei summoned the array! He tore through the void in an attempt to escape. The only thing he wanted to do was to run as far away as he could from Huang Xiaolong!

Escape? Huang Xiaolong sneered. His body trembled, and he stopped Zeng Lei. With a punch, he sent Zeng Lei flying into the ground.

……

An hour later.

Zeng Lei and the other Dao Venerables were controlled by Huang Xiaolong’s Huang Long Bloodline.

As for the Dao Venerable, who was sent flying initially, Huang Xiaolong threw him into the dragon pearl. He would devour the man’s dao soul in the future.

After gaining control of Zeng Lei, Huang Xiaolong ordered him to retrieve the creation pills. They were called the Broken Heaven Pills, and Huang Xiaolong kept them all for himself. He also ordered Zeng Lei to retrieve the absolute origin qi and every other treasure he had.

He then searched Zeng Lei’s memory. From there, he found out all the different ways to use the genesis-level pills. He also obtained several secrets on the Mystical Pavilion.

A frown formed on his face when he discovered that even Zeng Lei had no idea who the pavilion master was. He only knew that the pavilion master was extremely powerful! Not even the alliance of the ten creeds would be enough to take the pavilion master down!

Huang Xiaolong was shocked.

One had to know that Bi Cheng and the others were peak late-Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables! How could all of them not be the pavilion master’s match?!

?!

His heart sank as a heavy-weight pressed down on his heart.

Huang Xiaolong thought that he would be able to move unhindered in the Huang Long World after entering the high-level Dao Venerable Realm. Now, it didn’t seem so.

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong calmed his mind, and he turned to look at the Sun Moon Furnace. Even though it was a treasure used to refine pills, it could also be used for cultivation!

There was still a year to Huang Shuai’s ascension ceremony. He could make use of the pill furnace to refine the strands of beginning qi he had obtained!
