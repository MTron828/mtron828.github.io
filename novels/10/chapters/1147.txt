Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed. It never crossed his mind that this Bladeless Gate Young Lord would hide and spectate, escaping everyone’s detection.

The Bladeless Gate’s Young Lord continued as he pleased despite Huang Xiaolong’s obvious wariness towards him, “I am Du Tao of Bladeless Gate. This brother came to search for the chaos lightning lagoon, right? Could you be interested in cooperating with me?”

“Not interested.” Huang Xiaolong’s rejection was blunt and straightforward. Leaving those two words behind, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow turned and left.

Du Tao was stupefied for a second by this respond.

Huang Xiaolong’s group of four disappeared amidst the streaks of lightning flashing around the Lightning Lagoon Mainland.

Some time later, the little cow curled its lips and said, “That brat wanted to kill you just now.”

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “But he’s uncertain if he could.” Huang Xiaolong had a feeling they would meet again in the future.

‘Du Tao.’ Huang Xiaolong committed the name to memory.

As they moved forward, a group of strange creatures made of energy, with First Order Ancient God Realm strength, rushed towards them in attack. Forgoing the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts and the Black Baboon, Huang Xiaolong dealt with them easily. With a wave of his hand, those strange creatures collapsed, completely swallowed by him.

Huang Xiaolong and the little cow continued onward, swallowing magic beasts, ghouls, and magic spirits’ energy to increase their cultivation as they searched for the chaos lightning lagoon.

Along the way, they didn’t come across the two Asura Kings Hun Dishan mentioned.

Huang Xiaolong was unwilling to give up, continuing to roam on the Lightning Lagoon Mainland for half a year, but he ended up with no harvest.

“Forget it, let’s leave!” Huang Xiaolong said, shaking his head.

The All-Islands Great War was around the corner, he had no time to waste on the Lightning Lagoon Mainland anymore.

He could only come again in the future to try his luck again after the All-Islands Great War.

Hence, the two of them left the Lightning Lagoon Mainland, stopping at an uninhabited planet one month later. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The planet was a dark golden color, as if it was made entirely out of metal.

“A very concentrated Luo metal element aura.” Standing in outer space, the little cow exclaimed as it looked at the planet below them. The Luo metal element was one of the rarer metal element auras in the Divine World, used to forge the higher grade divine armor, able to increase the divine armor’s defense.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow descended on the planet. When he feet touched the ground, a zheng sound of metal rang from his feet, resembling the sound of divine artifacts clashing.

Huang Xiaolong looked down, the sand below his feet like grains of metal.

“In the depth of this planet there is most likely a metal element spiritual vein, quite a high grade one as well. It should be at least grade five!” The little cow deduced as it looked around.

Grade five! And that was the lowest estimation!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart skipped a beat. In a flicker, he attempted to drill into the metal ground only to find that he couldn’t. Even his Eye of Hell could not see through the earth below.

“Do you have a way to find it?” Huang Xiaolong looked at the little cow.

“Let me try.” The little cow replied. This planet they were on was a little weird, the little cow wasn’t sure if it could find the spiritual vein.

At this time, the ancient lightning symbol on its forehead appeared and grew increasingly prominent, causing purple lightning to flicker and expand, gathering into a purple lightning aura that slowly flowed into the metal ground.

Currently, the little cow’s strength was still low, so its purple lightning could only expand in a thousand li radius.

A while later, the lightning symbol on the little cow’s forehead slowly dimmed, and the purple lightning aura receded back into its body. Panting, it shook its head at Huang Xiaolong.

This method of investigation consumed a lot of godforce.

Huang Xiaolong also did not force the little cow to continue searching.

Riding on the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow continued to move forward. Strangely, they did not come across any magic beasts, ghouls, or evil spirits; not a single one.

The whole planet seemed empty of living creatures.

However, just as Huang Xiaolong’s group came to a grassland, a swarm of insects similar to bees flew out to attack them.

This swarm had several thousand insects, but Huang Xiaolong noticed that they were weak, mostly around early and mid-First Order Ancient God Realm, so his palm struck out with an Earthen Buddha Palm toward the swarm of bees, not feeling much concern.

Golden Buddha images spread over the sky, causing a large number of those bee-like insects to plummet to the ground. However, Huang Xiaolong was astonished when he saw that those fallen insects flapped their wings and alighted again, joining the big swarm in attacking Huang Xiaolong and the little cow.

This reminded him of the time when he tried to tame a swarm of Poisonous Corpse Insects in the lower realm.

“Eh, these little guys look like the Golden Gorb Insects!” The little cow cried out in amazement.

Golden Gorb Insect?

Huang Xiaolong pointed a finger toward the flying swarm, sending out an Absolute Soul Finger, but it only left a faint fingerprint on one of the Golden Gorb Insects instead of piercing through its body.

“these Golden Gorb Insects are a variant ancient insect. Although their attack is not powerful, they are hard to kill, most annoying of all, they eat everything and anything. Once one of them is stuck on your body. Once that happens, there’s only death.” The little cow added, “Don’t underestimate this swarm of Golden Gor Insect because their First order Ancient God Realm strength, most Second Order, and Third Order Ancient God Realm cultivators are incapable of killing them.”

Huang Xiaolong looked at the little cow, shocked.

Even Second Order and Third Order Ancient God Realm couldn’t kill them!

No doubt, these Golden Gorb Insects’ defense was terrifying.

Ancient variant insect, right? They really had some similarities to the Poisonous Corpse Insects he tamed in the lower realm.

In that instant, the thought of taming this swarm of Golden Gorb Insects came to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong immediately took action. His palm pulled several Golden Gorb Insects to his front.

Unfortunately, despite his diligent efforts in cultivating the Grandmist Parasite Medium these past few years, he still couldn’t master the first stage, thus, his only choice was the Soul Mandate technique to control these Golden Gorb Insects.

With the little cow and the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts’ help, Huang Xiaolong spent almost four hours to tame this swarm of over three thousand and six hundred Golden Gorb Insects.

From the memories of these insects, this dark golden planet was the Golden Gorb Insects’ breeding ground. Deep underground, the number of Golden Gorb Insects surpassed hundreds of millions.

On top of that, their King’s strength exceeded the Ancient God Realm.

Cold sweat trickled down Huang Xiaolong’s forehead at the thought of this.

No wonder he did not notice any magic beasts, ghouls, or evil spirits on this planet, all of them were probably eaten by these Golden Gorb Insects.

Huang Xiaolong told the little cow about this, nearly causing it to jump out of its skin in shock.

The two were no longer interested in lingering around this planet, leaving with the swarm of Golden Gorb Insects.

In the blink of an eye, another year went by.

Huang Xiaolong had advanced to peak late-Ninth Order Heavenly God Realm, just half a step more and his strength would reach Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm.

At this point, there were less than two years until the All-Islands Great War.

The most disappointing factor of this trip was he did not find the grandmist aura, no clues at all. Huang Xiaolong decided he would return to the Green Cloud Island if he could not find the grandmist aura in the next two months.
