Not only Huang Xiaolong’s strength and physique had improved, but his cultivation of Grandmist Parasitic Medium had also increased and it was inching closer to the second stage.

However, he had completely refined the purple grandmist aura dragon by now.

Without the support of the grandmist aura, it would be hard for him to advance into the second stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium. Thus Huang Xiaolong planned to go to the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield after the God of the Sea Grand Ceremony to look for another source of grandmist aura.

During these three months, the little cow used her purple lightning to detoxify some of the Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue’s Poison of Thousand Corpses twice. Due to the little cow’s help, Gui Yue didn’t need to worry about the Poison of Thousands Corpses for the next three hundred years.

Gui Yue would have even less worries after three hundred years. This was because the little cow had assured him that she would be able to recover her high-level Ancestor God Realm strength by then, and she could then completely cure Gui Yue’s Poison of Thousand Corpses.

“You want to go to the Xiao Family’s headquarters?” Gui Yue was surprised when he heard Huang Xiaolong wanted to go to the Xiao Family’s headquarters.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and told his Master Gui Yue about the chaos five-colored heaven refining stone.

“Chaos five-colored heaven refining stone is with Xiao Teng.” Gui Yue frowned. A moment later, he said, “Xiao Teng is Xiao Zhangyu’s people, therefore even if he is in possession of the chaos five-colored heaven refining stone, I doubt he sell it to you.”

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed as killing intent flickered across his eyes.

Gui Yue understood Huang Xiaolong’s intention as he detected the killing intent coming from his body. He shook his head, “There are many experts at the Xiao Family’s headquarters, also not to mention the Xiao Family’s Ancestor. Even I cannot say with confidence that I could handle him. Getting what you want by force is definitely not an option.”

Huang Xiaolong said seriously, “I will pay Xiao Teng a visit first, if that doesn’t work, I can only wait until Xiao Teng leaves the Xiao Family’s headquarters before taking action.”

Gui Yue agreed, “That works too. How about this, I can accompany you when you pay Xiao Teng a visit?”

A warm feeling filled Huang Xiaolong. He understood this was because his Master Gui Yue was worried about him, but Huang Xiaolong shook his head and declined, “Master, no need.”

Although Gui Yue was powerful, his identity was too conspicuous. Moreover, after comparing Gui Yue’s identity with Xiao Teng’s, Huang Xiaolong didn’t want Gui Yue to ask for a favor because of him.

Gui Yue insisted solemnly, “Then I will have Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San to accompany you.”

Huang Xiaolong did not object to this arrangement.

Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San were less conspicuous than Ghost Manor Lord Gui Yue. On top of that, all four of them were high-level Ancestor God Realm masters, especially Feng Er. Her strength was almost at par with the Xiao Family’s Ancestor. It was much safer for Huang Xiaolong to go to the Stone Buddha Mainland with them.

There was also the void devil beast Xu Baisheng. The number of people in their group was enough, as too many people would attract unwanted attention.

In these three months, the void devil beast Xu Baisheng’s strength had returned to the peak-mid Third Order Ancestor God Realm and his battle power was comparable to a Fourth Order Ancestor God Realm master.

As the matter was settled, Huang Xiaolong’s group set off from the Ghost Manor to the Stone Buddha Mainland, early in the morning the next day.

Before Huang Xiaolong left, Gui Yue reminded him to be careful, and also told him everything he knew about the Xiao Family.

Huang Xiaolong committed Gui Yue’s words to memory.

As there were more than three Ancestor God Realm masters in the group, Huang Xiaolong took a shortcut to the Stone Buddha Mainland. They cut straight through to the Odious Ghosts Forest, and reached the Stone Buddha City in ten days.

“Manor Lord, Stone Buddha City is just up ahead. With our speed, we will arrive there in two hours.” Standing on a main path, Feng Er respectfully informed Huang Xiaolong as she pointed a slender finger in front of her.

Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er and Gui San had taken off their ghost masks long time back. No one could see a flaw in Feng Er’s alluring face under the sunlight.

In terms of beauty, Feng Er, Li Lu, Shi Xiaofei, and Yao Chi each had their own unique charms.

Huang Xiaolong nodded as his gaze moved away from Feng Er’s face to look in the direction of the Stone Buddha City.

The stone Buddha City was actually the biggest city on the Stone Buddha Mainland, instead of Xiao Family’s Xiao City. In fact, the Stone Buddha City was a territory of the Chen Family.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the dusky sky and said, “Increase speed, aim to enter the Stone Buddha City before the night falls. We’ll rest here for a day, and resume travelling the day after.”

The little cow was quick to cheer after hearing Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Huang Xiaolong lightly slapped the little cow’s head and urged, “Go on.” How could he not know the little cow’s personality, after having spent a long time together. If this cow were to go crazy, even he would have a headache.

With a sway of her tail, the little cow turned into a streak of purple light across the air, with Huang Xiaolong on her back.

Void devil beast Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest quickly followed behind her.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Stone Buddha City when the last rays of light disappeared into the horizon. Even before entering the city, Huang Xiaolong could sense a zeal of buddhism energy from years of accumulation.

Huang Xiaolong felt a closeness towards the Stone Buddha City’s buddhism energy.

After he paid the required shenbi, his group passed through the city gates.

The shop fronts in the streets of Stone Buddha City were lit with crystal lights, adding a touch of splendor. It was a very bustling city, even during the night.

Huang Xiaolong soon discovered that there were various sizes and forms of Buddha statues everywhere, and these Buddha statues provided people with a peace of mind whenever they looked at them.

The Stone Buddha City reminded Huang Xiaolong of the Blessed Buddha Empire in the lower realm, and inevitably of Shi Xiaofei.

“Master, it’s the Burning Sky Sect’s group.” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng suddenly spoke.

Huang Xiaolong looked in the direction where Xu Baisheng was pointing, and saw Guo Jie, Du Gao, and the rest of Burning Sky Sect’s group. He was happy. He hadn’t expected to run into them here.

Huang Xiaolong nudged the little cow with his knees, urging her to go towards the Burning Sky Sect’s group with Feng Er and the others trailing behind them.

“Guo Jie.” Huang Xiaolong called out from behind Guo Jie’s group as he got closer to them.

Guo Jie, Du Gao, and the rest looked over their shoulders.

“Xiaolong!” Guo Jie’s eyes shone in delight as she called out.

“You’re here too...?!” Huang Xiaolong and Guo Jie asked each other simultaneously. Both were stunned for a moment as they tried to speak simultaneously, but then they chuckled.

“I came to the Stone Buddha City to buy some natural Buddha Spirit Stone.” Said Guo Jie .

“We’re passing by Stone Buddha City on our way to Xiao City, so we decided to spend a day over here, before resuming our journey.” Huang Xiaolong explained to Guo Jie.

“Xiaolong, do you mind if we catch up somewhere else? This cow’s stomach is gonna go flat from hunger.” The little cow interjected.

Huang Xiaolong grinned, “I think it’s the wine-worm in your stomach that’s making trouble!”

Everyone laughed.

Soon, they found a restaurant and went inside. Before long, the tables were laden with food and wine.

Guo Jie looked at the Ghost Manor Ring on Huang Xiaolong’s finger. She smiled and said, “Looks like I have to call you Ghost Manor Lord Huang.” Then she asked curiously, “Are you going to Xiao City to buy something?”

Huang Xiaolong honestly disclosed to Guo Jie that he was looking for Xiao Teng. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t have any pressing matters that need my attention right now, so how about I make a trip with you to Xiao City? Xiao Teng would give me some face.” Guo Jie offered after some thought.

Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised. However, he did not doubt Guo Jie’s words. He had learned from Master Gui Yue that she was much more than just being a Burning Sky Sect’s disciple.
