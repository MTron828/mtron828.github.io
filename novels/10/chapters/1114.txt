Taking a hit from Bing Jiuyi’s palms caused a thick layer of green ice to cover the two Metal Carapace Searhinos’ bodies in the blink of an eye. However, what Huang Xiaolong did not expect was for them to escape being turned into ice statues.

A golden light similar to fire appeared on the surface of their skin, blocking Bing Jiuyi’s cold qi.

“These two Metal Carapace Searhinos have evolved, possessing certain abilities of divine beasts of the water and metal elements, such as turning their bodies into water or metal.” The little cow spoke.

Huang Xiaolong nodded; no wonder these two could turn into mist and escape into the void. If it weren’t for Bing Jiuyi, these two little scoundrels would have fled back into the Endless Sea.

But Huang Xiaolong did not immediately kill the two sea beasts. After all, there was bound to be some benefits in subjugating two evolved peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm Metal Carapace Searhinos that could manipulate the elements of water and metal.

Contrary to Huang Xiaolong’s wishes, the two Metal Carapace Searhinos would rather die than submit. Having no alternative, Huang Xiaolong devoured the two Metal Carapace Searhinos’ essence energy.

Before that, though, he scoured both sea beasts’ memories.

Half an hour later, the two Metal Carapace Searhinos shriveled up into dried corpses just like the other sea beasts.

A sliver of divine fire shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s finger, incinerating the remains of the two sea beasts. As he did so, the little cow heard Huang Xiaolong muttered, “The Clam Tribe.”

From the two sea beasts’ memories, Huang Xiaolong found out that the order to attack Green Cloud Island, Dralion Island, and the dozen human populated islands came from one of the sea tribes, the Clam Tribe!

This Clam Tribe controlled over a million miles of the Endless Sea’s territory, and the archipelago where Green Cloud Island was located fell precisely within this territory.

Huang Xiaolong was inwardly astounded. This Clam Tribe’s overall forces were so powerful, yet amongst the entire Endless Sea’s numerous tribes, it wasn’t even in the top one thousand!

He couldn’t even begin to imagine how terrifying the Endless Sea’s tribes were.

However, one point allowed Huang Xiaolong to loosen his breath slightly. With the death of the two Metal Carapace Searhino, the beast tide’s rhythm had become chaotic. Followed by the aggressive retaliation of Huang Xiaolong and the experts inside South Huai City, the sea beast tide finally retreated once more.

Watching the beasts retreat back to the Endless Sea, the cultivators of various forces erupted into a cheer.

Huang Xiaolong returned to the city riding on the little cow with Bing Jiuyi following behind them.

Yao Chi had a brilliant smile on her face, approaching Huang Xiaolong together with the Barbarian God Sect Elder Guo Xuan and the other disciples.

“Yao Chi, are you alright?” Huang Xiaolong asked when he got close.

Yao Chi smiled, her beautiful eyes shining as she answered, “I’m alright.”

Together with the rest, Huang Xiaolong went up to the city walls.

All the human experts gave Huang Xiaolong wide berth, looking at him with awe and flattery.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze then fell onto the Elephant Genesis Sect’s Hu Qing and Yang Yun. Feeling his cold gaze on their bodies, Hu Qing and Yang Yun’s knees went weak.

“Se-Senior Huang,” Hu Qing forced a smile on his face.

Yang Yun’s teeth chattered so badly that he couldn’t get a proper word out, his head lowered to his chest, not daring to meet Huang Xiaolong’s gaze.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes shifted away from them. Before nervous gazes from all around, he returned to the temporary Barbarian God Sect branch with Yao Chi, Elder Guo Xuan, and the Barbarian God Sect disciples.

Back in the Barbarian God Sect branch, Huang Xiaolong said to Yao Chi after some thinking, “In a couple of days I’ll be heading to the Endless Sea, why don’t you return to the Lin Family Fort first?”

“What? You want to go to the Endless Sea?” Yao Chi couldn’t believe what she was hearing.

Guo Xuan too was looking at Huang Xiaolong with widened eyes filled with shock.

The Endless Sea was the sea tribes and sea beasts’ domain, even an Ancient God Realm master would think thrice before venturing in.

“You don’t need to worry, I’m just going into the Endless Sea to check out the situation and purchase some things, nothing will happen.” Huang Xiaolong reassured Yao Chi.

He really was only going to check out the situation at the Endless Sea, to find out why the Clam Tribe was attacking the humans. He was also planning to search for the remaining few ingredients needed to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill.

A few days ago, the Golden Dragon Gate Chief and the Berserk Lion Sect Chief informed Huang Xiaolong that about a dozen herbs he needed could be found in the Endless Sea.

Because the herbs were in the Endless Sea, it would take too long for either one of them to purchase the materials under the current circumstances, thus Huang Xiaolong decided to make the trip to the Endless Sea himself.

Yao Chi teared up when she heard that Huang Xiaolong wanted to purchase herbs needed to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill, her small hands reached out to hold his hand.

Huang Xiaolong looked at her. Their eyes met and everything was understood without the need for words.

Two days later, Yao Chi sent Huang Xiaolong off. He left South Huai City and entered the Endless Sea.

As a precaution, he had Xiaoniū, Bing Jiuyi, Xie Tu, and Xie Du remain inside the Xumi Temple. Despite Xiaoniū’s pitiful objection, it was overridden by Huang Xiaolong.

After entering the Endless Sea, Huang Xiaolong altered his physical appearance to that of a Clam Tribe member and flew off in the direction of the Clam Tribe settlement.

Close to the seabed, Huang Xiaolong accelerated forward, watching various sea creatures blur past him.

Because he had altered his physical appearance, all sea creatures that saw Huang Xiaolong would scurry away in fear, for the Clam Tribe was the absolute sovereign within a million miles.

Occasionally, he came across those from smaller tribes such as the Snakemen Tribe, Water Weed Tribe, Fishman Tribe, Long Snout Gator Tribe, and a few others.

All these sea tribes were ruled by the Clam Tribe.

However, Huang Xiaolong was feeling terribly awkward at the moment. The Clam Tribe carried around a big shell that resembles a turtle shell. Carrying such a large shell and moving as fast as he could underwater felt weird to Huang Xiaolong.

As Huang Xiaolong moved along without any incident, he even had time to cultivate.

From the accumulation several days ago after devouring numerous sea beasts’ essence energy, especially the two peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm Metal Carapace Searhinos, Huang Xiaolong distinctively felt that his breakthrough to mid-Sixth Order Heavenly God Realm was just around the corner.

Four days later, he sat cross-legged inside an undersea mountain cave. His body was enshrouded in a resplendent light that suddenly expanded, shaking the entire mountain.

Huang Xiaolong did not stop there, continuing to absorb godforce from the Ancient God Realm godhead for two more days before he finally stopped.

In a moment of laziness, Huang Xiaolong flew up and made his way out of the cave through crushing a path to the mountain top. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Rocks rolled down from the undersea mountain top, scaring away the nearby creatures while Huang Xiaolong sped away.

Three days later, a huge city appeared in his line of sight, a city built on the seabed that was even larger than South Huai City.

The giant city walls were built from bricks molded from the Endless Sea’s golden corals, glimmering in soft golden light.

According to the two Metal Carapace Searhinos’ memories, this was one of the Clam Tribe’s most important cities, called Punishing Heaven City.

“Punishing Heaven City.” Huang Xiaolong sneered, this Clam Tribe was just a small tribe in comparison to the entire Endless Sea, yet they had the face to name this city Punishing Heaven.

Heaven usually referred to the Heaven’s Law.

Huang Xiaolong flew towards the Punishing Heaven City. Half an hour later, he stood across the city gates.

The sea tribes used sea shenbi which was different from what the humans used. In order to enter the Punishing Heaven City, he had to pay one hundred sea shenbi, but fortunately,

Huang Xiaolong was prepared. He cleaned off the spatial rings of some sea tribe disciples on the way here.

After paying one hundred sea shenbi at the gates, Huang Xiaolong strode into the city. Once inside, he was enshrouded by a faint water element qi.

“Master, I sense the Ancestral Dragon Tree’s aura!” At this time, the little cow’s gleeful shriek sounded in Huang Xiaolong’s mind.
