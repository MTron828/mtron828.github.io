Chapter 2728: Meeting Disciples From the Cangqiong Sacred Land

The Convent of the Wind and Clouds was going to be held in the Ice Blue Sacred Land, and they ranked among the top five powers. They boasted beautiful and unique scenery.

After Huang Xiaolong and the others left the Singular Sacred Land, they headed straight for the Ice Blue Sacred Land.

Since it wasn’t too far away, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother using the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

Stepping into the sky above the Ice Blue Sacred Land, Huang Xiaolong and the others felt refreshed. A peculiar qi blew across their faces.

“This is the rarely seen icy blue spiritual qi, it’s no wonder this place is called the Icy Blue Sacred Land!” Long Jianfei said in surprise.

Duan Feng nodded his head, “Looks like there are ice blue spiritual veins all around the region.”

Everyone nodded their heads in agreement.

After enjoying the breeze, Huang Xiaolong brought everyone forward.

He had obtained some of the ice blue spiritual veins when he had received the Sky Opening Island in the past. Theice blue spiritual veins there were of much greater rank than those around the region.

Spiritual veins were naturally split into different grades. They ranged from low, mid, high, to peak!

“According to those disciples, the Convent of the Wind and Clouds will be held at the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak. It will be heavily guarded, and only disciples who are participating will be allowed entry. Should we force our way in?” Long Shengtian asked.

Everyone turned to look at Huang Xiaolong. As long as he gave the nod, they would start a war with those guarding the peak.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head. “Let’s wait and see.”

As soon as they entered, they ran into a group of people who were fighting.

As all of them were Primal Ancestors, they were able to feel the fluctuations in energy before they saw those who were fighting.

“There are a couple of high-level True Saints fighting there,” Long Jianfei commented.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes flickered. His perception was better than Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi, and the rest. He recognized the power being used in the battle, and it was the Cangqiong Grand Dao Art his master practiced. Even though the person who used it wasn’t very proficient, he could tell that it was the secret art he had learned.

Disciples from the Cangqiong Sacred Land?

In order to learn the Cangqiong Grand Dao Art, the disciple had to be a disciple of the Cangqiong Old Man! As such, there was only one possibility. Wang Xueru was present.

“Let’s go take a look,” Huang Xiaolong said.

He couldn’t turn a blind eye to his fellow disciple, could he?

It didn’t take long for them to arrive.

One of the parties was clad in yellow, and the other was clad in red. The insignia of a dao palace could be seen on the yellow robes, and Huang Xiaolong recognized them instantly. It was the Cangqiong Dao Palace!

Undoubtedly, the people in yellow were from the Cangqiong Sacred Land, whereas the people in red should be from the Chufan Sacred Land.

In the surrounding sacred lands, the strongest were the Tang Dragon and Freezing Desert Sacred Land. The Chufan Sacred Land came after.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze fell onto two people who were currently fighting. There was a pretty lady, and she seemed to be Wang Xueru. Her opponent was probably the head disciple of the Chufan Sacred Land, Chu Zhouyun. He was a peak late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm expert.

Even after using the Cangqiong Grand Dao Art, Wang Xueru fell to a disadvantage.

“What Cangqiong Grand Dao Art is this? I think it should be called the stinky ass grand dao art! Your master should also change his name to the Stinky Ass Old Man,” Chu Zhouyun mocked Wang Xueru as he attacked.

The surrounding disciples from the Chufan Sacred Land broke out into laughter.

Similar to the Tang Dragon Sacred Land and the Freezing Desert Sacred Land, the Chufan Sacred Land detested the Cangqiong Sacred Land. Even though the hatred wasn’t strong, they were more than willing to hit them when they were down.

Wang Xueru’s chest heaved when she heard how they mocked the Cangqiong Sacred Land and her master.

“Wang Xueru, have you considered my earlier suggestion? I need some maidservants to serve me. It will be much more beneficial for you to come over to the Chufan Sacred Land to be my maidservant. If you remain in the Cangqiong Sacred Land, you will die a miserable death. Young Master Tang Jin and Yuan Yue are planning to deal with you during the Convent of the Wind and Clouds,” Chu Zhouyun said as he stared directly at her breasts.

“If you are willing to come over to my Chufan Sacred Land, I will definitely ensure your safety!”

He smiled lecherously and continued, “Amongst the numerous powers, only my Chufan Sacred Land has the ability to ensure your safety!”

Huang Xiaolong looked at Wang Xueru as he waited for her to make a decision.

If she chose to betray his master, then not to mention saving her, he would end her!

Wang Xueru looked coldly at Chu Zhouyun, “I don’t need you to worry about me, even if I die I will still stick with the Cangqiong Sacred Land!

When Chu Zhouyun heard it, he laughed mischievously, “If you insist, then I will capture you now, and enjoy you slowly. Anyway, death is only a matter of time if you insist on going to the Thunder Fire Sacred Peak, and since this is the case, why not let me enjoy you first?”

Wang Xueru was pushed around by him, and what made her even angrier was that he was aiming for her breast every single strike.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong signaled to Zi Dongping, and just as he was about to make a move, Fei Yanzi had already moved out.

With a wave of her hand, she slapped Chu Zhouyun with her slender hand and flew towards Wang Xueru, causing him to fly out and spit out blood.

“Shameless men!” Fei Yanzi sneered, “All men are the same!”

Huang Xiaolong was startled. Is she implying something else?

Long Jianfei, Mo Zhi and the rest of their foreheads started sweating as well.

After seeing the sudden attack unleashed by Fei Yanzi, the disciples from the Chufan Sacred Land were dumbfounded as they turned to look at Huang Xiaolong and the rest of them.

“Senior Brother Chu!” The disciples from Chufan Sacred Land quickly regained their senses as they arrived beside Chu Zhouyun and fed him pills.

Chu Zhouyun took the pill and looked at Fei Yanzi in anger. "Primal Ancestor?"

Fei Yanzi's pretty face was cold, and she didn't speak. Even though she still had the poison of the Yin Bug in her body, she could still clean up a few True Saints effortlessly. In fact, she wouldn’t have any trouble as long as she didn't fight fiercely with a Primal Ancestor expert.

Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, Fei Yanzi and the rest of them flew towards Wang Xueru and the disciples from Cangqiong Sacred Land.

“Many thanks for lending a helping hand!” Wang Xueru thanked in a hurry.

Huang Xiaolong smiled indifferently, “There’s no need to be so polite, as we are family after all.”

Family? Wang Xueru and the rest of them were surprised, shocked, and puzzled.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong summoned the Cangqiong Dao Palace.
