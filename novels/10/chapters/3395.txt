Chapter 3396: You Lost

 

Ordinarily, artifacts that received the blessing of the grand dao laws would surpass those that didn't. Not to mention the fact that the Sky Mending Five Colored Rock was an innate treasure, to begin with. The power it possessed was far too shocking.

After the Wudang Goddess revealed her Sky Mending Five Colored Rock, the Tortoise Spirit Goddess retrieved a pearl from her sleeves. The pearl might not be as eye-catching as the Sky Mending Five Colored Rock, but it emitted a soft glow. When it appeared, the entire space around them seemed to lose its color. The pearl became the only object in existence. It was like the sun, but it also became the moon. It changed again and again, as it emitted a soft silvery glow.

The demon kings felt as though their bodies were burning and freezing at the same time, and that was the power of the artifact! It was the Sun and Moon Pearl!

The Sun and Moon Pearl might not be an innate artifact, but it was a peak-grade chaos spiritual treasure! The offensive abilities of the pearl were off the charts!

When she revealed her artifact, a snort left her lips. “Fellow Daoist Huang, you can make your move now. Please remember that you agreed to let us work together. As long as we manage to block a single attack from you, the grand dao spiritual vein will belong to us. You will also leave without causing any more trouble.”

“In the future, you better not show yourself in front of us again!”

She added the final sentence in order to stop Huang Xiaolong from pestering them all the time in case he was a sore loser.

After all, they would have to use the Sky Mending Five Colored Rock and the Sun and Moon Pearl in order to stop Huang Xiaolong’s attack. Even if they won the bet, it was nothing to brag about.

They knew that if Huang Xiaolong turned serious and was hell-bent on taking them down, he would eventually be able to do it. That was the reason she wanted Huang Xiaolong to leave them alone.

“Alright.” When they thought that Huang Xiaolong would come up with ways to avoid their last condition, he agreed.

The two of them stared at each other in shock.

A frown soon formed on their faces. How can he be so confident?

When they realized that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t fazed by their final condition, they started to lay down countless grand dao formations around them. The light emitted by the two artifacts illuminated the lands.

Experts residing in the regions around them felt the change, and they were shocked by the pillars of light piercing into the high heavens.

“It’s the Sky Mending Five Colored Rock created by Goddess Nuwa! A Dao Ancestor is using the power of the Sky Mending Five Colored Rock!”

“The Sun and Moon Pearl is there too! It’s the Tortoise Spirit Goddess’ peak-grade chaos artifact!”

“Who is the crazy b*stard who dared to anger the Tortoise Spirit Goddess?”

The experts in the north exclaimed in shock.

…

With his hands clasped behind his back, Huang Xiaolong looked at the rays of light that were shooting up into the skies. The Nine Tailed Fox King and the others had already run a fair distance away as they were afraid that they would be caught in the crossfire.

The Ice Rhino did the same.

With his cultivation level at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Immortal Emperor Realm, he couldn’t even withstand the pressure coming from the two goddesses!

As a snort rang through the air, the Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Ancestor moved.

The Sky Mending Five Colored Rock flashed as it appeared in front of Huang Xiaolong before the demon kings could blink! The speed of the rock was too terrifying, and it planned to pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s body before he could unleash his attack.

The five-colored lights enveloped him completely as the Sun and Moon Pearl appeared above him. A river formed with silver and golden lights poured down on his body. 

As the golden light threatened to burn Huang Xiaolong alive, the silver moonlight tried to freeze him whole.

Huang Xiaolong sighed softly in response. “Petty tricks.” Raising his hand, a single palm shot out.

Beams of light froze in the air as the two artifacts fell towards the ground.

When the two goddesses were still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong flipped his palm around and the two artifacts shot towards them.

The goddesses yelped in fright as they pushed the grand dao energy in their bodies to the extreme. Like a geyser, grand dao energy emerged from their pores as it surrounded them. They tried their hardest to recall their treasures but to no avail.

The Sky Mending Five Colored Rock and Sun and Moon Pearl pierced through the grand dao formations around them as it crashed into their bountiful chests.

Like shooting stars, they drew perfect arcs through the skies.

Boom!

The skies trembled as the earth shook.

Mountain peaks crumbled under the impact as the two artifacts formed two massive craters in the land.

The Nine Tailed Fox King, along with everyone else, felt as though they were in a dream.

They looked at Huang Xiaolong with wide eyes, and none of them managed to speak.

“The two… The two… What happened to the two goddesses?” The Tiger King was the first to regain his senses, and he looked deathly pale when he asked.

The two goddesses who had already entered the Combined Dao Ancestor Realm were defeated just like that! They worked together, with two absolute treasures! Even then, they failed to withstand a single strike from Huang Xiaolong.

The demon kings felt their hearts trembling when they looked at the monstrous presence before them.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After a long time, the two ladies finally managed to crawl to their feet. They looked at Huang Xiaolong with frightened expressions plastered onto their faces. 

“Who in the world are you?” 

“You lost.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother answering them as he continued, “Tell me the location of your master.”

Huang Xiaolong retrieved his grand dao spiritual vein that was hovering in the air.

Lowering their heads, the Wudang Goddess spoke, “We accept our loss. However, our master left to roam the world after the ancient war. We have no idea where he is. It’s been a long time since we last saw him.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

He guessed as much, but it was still a little disappointing.

“What about your senior brother? Do you think the Myriad Treasures Dao Master and the Golden Spirit Goddess know of his whereabouts?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“We… We have no idea. It’s been forever since we last contacted them.” They shook their heads slowly.

Raising his arms, Huang Xiaolong locked the two of them in place as a ray of light entered the space between their eyebrows. He searched their memories for everything related to the Heaven Piercing Sage.

He stopped after he realized that they weren’t lying.

With a single step, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Ice Rhino’s back. They disappeared into the horizon as the two goddesses looked at him with complicated feelings building in their hearts.

…

“Breaking news! Huang Xiaolong slapped Immortal Emperor Chen Chong to death in the holy temple! He doesn’t respect the Crape Myrtle Heavenly Emperor!”

“What do you know?! The Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Goddess were beaten by him with a single move!”

Everything that happened started to spread the moment he left.

When the experts of the northern region learned that the Wudang Goddess and the Tortoise Spirit Goddess had already become Combined Dao Ancestors but were still defeated by Huang Xiaolong, they didn’t know what to think.
