Chapter 96: Arrest Him

Moments after Huang Xiaolong slit the throat of the Bandit Head, the ground started to shake and within seconds came the sounds of soldiers and of neighing horses. It seems like the Luo Tong Kingdom’s border garrison army arrived.

Just like how it was on Earth in his previous life, the police always comes after problems were solved.

A short while later, about a thousand soldiers from two brigades surrounded Huang Xiaolong and the rest. These soldiers arrived at the square and saw the mountain of corpses from the townspeople and the bandits, and the expressions on their faces changed.

Although none of them knew what took place, each of them could guess roughly what happened.

“General Qin, look. That one looks like the Martial Ning Family’s Ning Fei; the Martial Ning Family Patriarch’s brother.” A Lieutenant General suddenly pointed at the Bandit Head’s corpse while talking to General Qin Shi.

General Qin Shi’s gaze followed the direction of the finger, and when he saw the Bandit Head’s body, he frowned– yes, it was Ning Fei. This Ning Fei had crossed the border and did some crimes, but he escaped the last time, and this was the reason Qin Shi recognized Ning Fei.

“General Qin, with Ning Fei’s death, this matter will be difficult to handle. Ning Wang would definitely pressure us through the Baolong Kingdom’s King to make us handover the murderer.” That Lieutenant General said, and he added: “You see?”

Qin Shi nodded. If it was someone with no background then it was fine, but the one who died was Ning Fei, so it was bound to bring problems.

“Who killed him?” Qin Shi pointed at the Bandit Head and snapped.

“I killed him.” Huang Xiaolong replied indifferently.

“Go capture him!” Qin Shi signaled the soldiers to him.

“Yes, General!”

And several soldiers surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

“Stop! You dare?!” Chen Feirong snapped angrily, and came up with the students and teachers from the Cosmic Star Academy, glaring with wrath at Qin Shi and the soldiers. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There was a faint cold smile on Huang Xiaolong as he watched Qin Shi, and his calm-voiced sounded, “According to the kingdom’s law, killing border bandits is a meritorious deed that will be awarded. So, I would like to ask, why would you not follow the kingdom’s law and want to capture me instead?”

Qin Shi choked on Huang Xiaolong’s words.

“Presumptuous! Little brat, you committed a cruel murder, yet you’re still dreaming of meritorious award?” Qin Shi had yet to speak before the Lieutenant General next to him had already flared up: “Come, arrest that little brat!”

However, before they could get close to Huang Xiaolong, those soldiers were slapped away by Chen Feirong and the two Tenth Order teachers.

“You actually dare to rebel?!” That Lieutenant General saw the three people obstructing his soldiers, and questioned them aloud, accusing Chen Feirong and the two teachers of a capital crime.

“What an audacious accusation!” At this point, a voice sounded.

“Who? Roll out here!” That Lieutenant General barked.

A path opened amongst the students as a person walked out to the front, and it was Prince Lu Kai. When Qin Shi saw Lu Kai, the skin of his face was taut with tension. However, the Lieutenant General did not recognize Lu Kai, “Go and arrest him together!”

“Stop!”Qin Shi quickly roared, and before the shocked eyes of the Lieutenant General and the soldiers, Qin Shi jumped down from his horse and arrived in front of Lu Kai in hurried steps. He knelt down on one knee and saluted: “Qin Shi greets His Highness Prince Lu Kai!”

His Royal Highness!

That Lieutenant General and the soldiers were shocked into a daze; recovering, each quickly alighted their horses and knelt down: “Saluting His Prince Highness!”

That Lieutenant General bowed so low he was practically kissing the ground in salute, and cold sweat trickled down the side of his face.

“All of you rise, but as for you, continue kneeling!” Lu Kai permitted Qin Shi and all the other soldiers to stand up except for that one Lieutenant General that was told to continue kneeling on the ground.

Qin Shi stood up and came up beside Lu Kai whereas Lu Kai observed the Lieutenant General with cold eyes, “You ordered to have me arrested?”

The beads of cold sweat on the Lieutenant General’s face grew bigger, and kowtowing ruthlessly, he pleaded, “I did not realize it was Your Royal Highness! I hope Your Royal Highness forgives this one’s mistake!”

Lu Kai continued, “You said we wanted to rebel?”

That Lieutenant General ashen instantly, not knowing how to answer; in his heart, he was already prepared to die.

Then, Lu Kai turned around and looked at Qin Shi, a look that made Qin Shi’s hair stand up in fear.

“You wanted to arrest him. Do you know who he is?” Lu Kai asked Qin Shi as his eyes indicated towards Huang Xiaolong. Qin Shi obediently looked towards Huang Xiaolong.

“He is Huang Xiaolong!” Lu Kai stated.

“What? Huang Xiaolong!”

“He is that Huang Xiaolong?!”

Qin Shi, the Lieutenant General, and the many soldiers’ heads made an abrupt turn in Huang Xiaolong’s direction and without a doubt, each and every one of them was greatly shocked.

Huang Xiaolong, top grade twelve martial spirit, the Primordial Divine Black Dragon! The Luo Tong Kingdom’s first talent!

This message had spread far and wide throughout the Luo Tong Kingdom, from the commoners below to the Generals and nobles above– who did not know about him? Even some of the prominent forces in the neighboring kingdoms knew a talented monster of a youth had appeared in the Luo Tong Kingdom.

It was Qin Shi’s turn to break out in a cold sweat.

Huang Xiaolong had deep connections with Marshal Haotian, this, he already knew. Hearing Huang Xiaolong’s name, that Lieutenant General lost all color in his face. Earlier, he was prepared to die, but now, he wasn’t sure if he could die in peace.

“This matter, I will report to my Royal Father!” Lu Kai added.

Qin Shi and his little Lieutenant General quivered.

The two of them were still rooted to the spot even after the team from Cosmic Star Academy left.

And after leaving the little town, they did not return to the Royal City, and instead, they moved on to other small towns to kill bandits.

Two months later, the team headed back to the Royal City from the border.

As for the bet between Huang Xiaolong and Lu Kai, needless to say, Huang Xiaolong won.

Some months later, the team returned, due to meritorious deeds for annihilating bandits at the border, the rewards from the Luo Tong Kingdom were quickly awarded. According to law, the rate of one bandit was one hundred gold coins, and Huang Xiaolong received more than ten thousand gold coins in reward.

Not long after that, Qin Shi was demoted to Lieutenant General and the Lieutenant General was removed from the military with a notice.

When Huang Xiaolong returned to Tianxuan Mansion, his parents and little siblings were there with Li Lu too. On that same night, Tianxuan Mansion held a banquet to celebrate Huang Xiaolong’s success in passing the class advancement test.

The banquet was very lively, especially with the two little ones, Huang Min and Huang Xiaohai.

After the banquet ended, and everyone went back to their rooms to rest, Huang Xiaolong, Marshal Haotian, and Fei Hou sat in the main hall.

“During these past two months, did the Big Sword Sect’s people appear nearby?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

‘Replying Sovereign, no.” Marshal Haotian answered, “But, Subordinate found out that next month, Big Sword Sect will hold a Sect Leader Election Ceremony.”

“Sect Leader Election Ceremony?” Huang Xiaolong’s voice was sullen, “Who is Big Sword Sect’s next Sect Leader?”

“It’s Liu Wei’s Junior Brother named Lin Zhiren, a peak late-Tenth Order. However, Lin Zhiren’s talent is quite good, and it is estimated that within ten years’ time, he will probably breakthrough to Xiantian realm.” This time, it was Fei Hou who replied.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, and then he requested Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou to watch the Big Sword Sect’s movement closely.

“Please rest assured, Sovereign.” Both of them replied respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong withdrew twenty Fire Dragon Pearls from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space and gave Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou ten each so they could use it for their cultivation. When the two of them realized that Huang Xiaolong gave them the Fire Dragon Pearls from the Linglong Treasure Pagoda, objects born from the natural spiritual energy, both of them were endlessly grateful.

When Marshal Haotian and Fei Hou retired, Huang Xiaolong came to his parents’ courtyard, informing them he will be training in the Silvermoon Forest in two days and he left sixty Fire Dragon Pearls with them.

Back in his own room, Huang Xiaolong started his daily practice of Asura Tactics; in the two months of killing bandits, he had advanced to mid-Seventh Order.

Xiaolong entered the Linglong Treasure Pagoda space, swallowed Fire Dragon Pearls, and practiced his cultivation technique. The twin dragons martial spirits floated behind him, greedily devouring the netherworld spiritual energy.
