Chapter 3382: Let Chen Keyu Kill HImself

Lu Ming’s face flushed red as he pushed the immortal essence in his body to the extreme. No matter how hard he tried, his sword wouldn’t advance an inch.

In fact, he couldn’t even move his sword!

Everyone sucked in a cold breath as none of them knew what was going on.

Chen Keyu frowned at the sight. Just as he was about to speak, Lu Ming’s sword trembled and he was sent flying. He shot through the main palace of the Shushan Immortal Gate, and he crashed into god knows how many structures before coming to a stop.

His plight was similar to what happened to Wang Lin.

“Founding ancestor!” the patriarch of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate, Liu Zhaoran, yelled in shock. He tore through the skies as he headed straight for Lu Ming. When he tried to help the old ancestor up, they were sent flying by a shocking amount of force.

Chen Keyu and the others saw the two of them slamming into the cliff face on the other side before falling off it.

A loud thud came from the bottom after several moments.

With their jaws dropping in fright, silence fell upon the lands.

Even Wang Lin couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

Did someone help them from the shadows? There weren't any fluctuations of energy in the air, and from what it looked like, Lu Ming and Liu Zhaoran were sent flying by an invisible force.

Wang Lin wasn’t the only one who was confused. Everyone else couldn’t explain what happened either.

No one dared to move a muscle in their body.

“Which rat *ss b*stard dares to hide in the dark to carry out sneak attacks?! Get out here right now,” Chen Keyu roared, but that was as far as he got.

A scream left his lips as he was smashed into the ground. When they looked at him, they realized that there was a giant palm print on his face.

Blood was flowing from his mouth and his nose was crooked.

Lei Hongli and the others sucked in a cold breath.

Chen Keyu was at the peak of the late-Ninth Level Immortal King Realm. However, he was beaten up all the same!

When everyone was still stuck in a state of shock, three figures appeared in the skies as they walked towards the crowd. There was a young man among them, a teenager, and a kid!

“Mu Shuihan, the founding ancestor of the Shushan Immortal Gate!” someone cried in shock.

The people who appeared were Huang Xiaolong, Mu Shuihan, and Yan Bao’er.

As their faces changed, everyone seemed to realize something. Since the three of them came over, the person who moved against Lu Ming previously could only be the man they called ‘Senior Huang’!

As their gazes turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, question marks formed in their minds. Could the youngster with black hair be the person they were addressing so respectfully?

“Master!” Wang Lin jumped in joy as he rushed over. The members of the Shushan Immortal Gate seemed to have found the light at the end of the tunnel as they rushed over to welcome Huang Xiaolong and the others.

“Senior Huang!” Wang Lin and the others bowed respectfully.

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the other members of the factions who were present. They lowered their heads instantly in fright.

Next, he turned to look at Chen Keyu who was still spitting blood on the ground.

Struggling to his feet, Chen Keyu roared in anger at Huang Xiaolong, “You!” He couldn’t be sure if Huang Xiaolong was the one who slapped him previously.

“That’s right. I did it. What about it?” Huang Xiaolong clasped his hands behind his back and snorted.

With his expression sinking, Chen Keyu sneered, “Fine. I’ll remember this. In the future, I’ll return this favor along with the interest you owe me!” As soon as he spoke, he turned to order the members of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate, “Bring your ancestor and we shall leave this place!”

Song Zhipeng, Song Qianqian, and the other experts who watched Chen Keyu arriving guns blazing ready to exterminate the Shushan Immortal Gate, gasped in shock.

No one expected the youngest and most famous Immortal King in the Eastern Dongsheng Continent to retreat!

When Chen Keyu turned around to leave, his face flushed red as he felt humiliated like never before. No matter what, he knew that he would be helpless against Huang Xiaolong.

Right before he could actually leave, Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air. “Did I allow you guys to leave?”

Chen Keyu’s body froze in midair.

Song Zhipeng and the others looked at Huang Xiaolong with their mouths agape.

Turning around, Chen Keyu glared at Huang Xiaolong with an ugly expression hanging on his face. “What do you mean by that?”

“You killed so many disciples of the Shushan Immortal Gate, and you plan to leave after getting slapped once?” Huang Xiaolong remained impassive as he continued, “Alright. Seeing as you didn’t touch anyone here, I’ll allow you to reincarnate if you kill yourself right here and now.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“WHAT?!” Song Zhipeng and the others cried out in shock.

Huang Xiaolong wanted Chen Keyu to kill himself!

Sweeping his gaze across the disciples of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate, Huang Xiaolong sighed, “Everyone who killed the disciples of the Shushan Immortal Gate, surrender yourselves. As for those who didn’t, I’ll allow you to submit to the Shushan Immortal Gate as their slaves!”

“Everyone who doesn’t kneel in ten seconds will die!”

Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang in the ears of everyone present.

No one believed what they heard as they looked at Huang Xiaolong as though he was crazy.

Roaring with laughter, a sinister smile appeared on Chen Keyu’s face. “You motherf*cker, do you really think you’re some kind of big shot?”

Raising his arm slightly, Huang Xiaolong crushed Chen Keyu straight into the ground. A giant hole was formed before he could even scream.

Everyone felt their hearts pounding in fear when they saw what happened.

It was especially so for Song Qianqian and Sui Yun. All of them felt their legs going soft.

Looking at the disheveled Chen Keyu in the ground, they heard him spit out the words, “My master is a great general of the Heavenly Court, Zhao Qi!”

Huang Xiaolong sent another slap into the ground. This time, he used a little more force compared to before. Chen Keyu was sent to the deepest parts of the earth as he turned into a pile of flesh. Even his essence soul failed to escape.

“Even if your master is the Jade Emperor, he wouldn’t be able to save you,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Mu Shuihan stared at the meat paste that Chen Keyu had turned into, and he felt his eyelids twitching. He knew how famous Chen Keyu was, but now, the man was turned into ground meat in front of his very eyes!

Huang Xiaolong was naturally too lazy to care about someone at the level of Chen Keyu. He killed countless freaks like that back in the Blazing Dragon World and Huang Long World. They were nothing more than specks of dust in his eyes now.

“How many seconds have passed?” Huang Xiaolong turned to ask Mu Shuihan.

“Senior Huang, seven seconds have passed.” With his throat as dry as a desert, Mu Shuihan choked out the answer.

Seven seconds!

The disciples of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate felt their hearts trembling in fear and so did Song Zhipeng and the others.

“Disciples of the Heavenly Silkworm Immortal Gate, listen up! Everyone focus your attacks on that b*stard!” one of the eminent elders of the Silkworm Immortal Gate roared.
