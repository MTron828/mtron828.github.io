Chapter 2345: It Can’t Be Wrong, Could It?

On the battle stage, Zhao Ya exuded a coruscating white light as suns as white as snow rose around her and congregated above her head. There were exactly nine hundred snow-white suns; not one more or one less.

“It’s the Grand Dance of the Snow Suns!” One of the holy lands’ experts exclaimed.

The Grand Dance of the Snow Suns was one of the Clear Snow Palace’s top techniques, and it was also acknowledged as one of the top techniques in the Holy World.One required to have a cold element saint godhead, cold element saint bloodline, as well as saint physique to practice this technique.

Moreover, practicing the Grand Dance of the Snow Suns required a high comprehension ability.

Watching this sight on the sacrificial altar, Lord Long commented, “This Clear Snow Palace’s female disciple, Zhao Ya, hasn’t entered the Clear Snow Palace for long, but she actually succeeded in cultivating the Grand Art of the Snow Suns. Moreover, it has already reached the minor completion stage. It looks like Xiaolong, that kid, is destined to lose this match.”

The Heavenly Master, Tyrant Chu, and Elder Crow also shook their heads, agreeing with Lord Long’s comment.

Although Huang Xiaolong’s talent was amazing, it was still an undeniable fact that his cultivation time was shorter, and his complete dao saint godhead’s ranking was not very high.

Huang Xiaolong’s winning odds were low to begin with, and now that his opponent was the Clear Snow Palace’s female disciple Zhao Ya, who had cultivated the Great Dance of the Snow Suns, his odds were even lower.

However, Wu Ge’s personal disciple, Xie Yao was inwardly gloating at this sight from the sacrificial altar.

The more powerful Zhao Ya was, the faster Huang Xiaolong would lose this match, and they were more than happy to see this result.

Yu Fujiang had a similar smile as Xie Yao on his face.

“Eldest Senior Brother, it looks like Huang Xiaolong won’t last three moves!” One of the Beast Tamer Holy Gate’s Holy Prince Chen Chunlai snickered with malice.

Earlier, they had made a bet on whether Huang Xiaolong could last three moves against the Clear Snow Palace’s female disciple Zhao Ya. But now, judging from the current situation, all of them tacitly agreed that Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t last for even three moves.

Yu Fujiang grinned as he nodded his head.

“Eldest Senior Brother, I made a reservation for a private room at the Heavenly Fragrance Teahouse for today. We can enjoy ourselves and celebrate when this ends.” Chen Chunlai laughed.

“You are right, we should celebrate.” Yu Fujiang smirked.

At this time, a complete dao saint godhead flew out from Zhao Ya’s body. The moment this complete dao saint godhead appeared, the immediate space around the battle stage was dominated by ice lotuses.

These ice lotuses spun in the air, exuding a bright white glow and cold qi.

“It is indeed the Ice Lotus Saint Godhead!”

The Ice Lotus Saint Godhead ranked at seventy-three!

With the appearance of the Ice Lotus Saint Godhead, Zhao Ya’s momentum rose at a shocking speed, completely suppressing Huang Xiaolong. On the battle stage, Huang Xiaolong was akin to a small tree in the midst of a snowstorm that could be uprooted at any moment.

Subsequently, the lights around Zhao Ya became blinding in a burst, turning into a snow phoenix!

This was the snow phoenix condensed from the power of the Freezing Phoenix Saint Bloodline ranked at seventy-first place.

Then, everyone saw mysterious runes appearing on Zhao Ya’s skin, and these runes glimmered in the snow-white light.

This was the Snow Moon Saint Physique ranked seventy-ninth!

In the short time Zhao Ya had activated her saint bloodline and saint physique’s powers, the stage had turned into a space of howling snowstorm, and thick layers of ice formed around Huang Xiaolong, corroding the space around him.

Huang Xiaolong’s feet were already covered by a thick layer of ice, and it continued to crawl upwards and reached his waist in a short time.

The spectating experts all around the plaza shook their heads at this sight.

“Honestly, this sparring match does not even need to be battled out. Although Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead can evolve through time, it is merely ranked at eight hundred and ninety-six at the moment. Though there might be some improvement after the Holy Heavens’ holy pill he was given, that marginal improvement is not enough for him to become Zhao Yao’s opponent.”

“That’s right, just Zhao Ya’s saint attributes’ power has already reduced Huang Xiaolong to an ice statue. Soon the ice will cover his head and enter his soul. Huang Xiaolong has lost even before he could make a move!”

The crowd’s negative opinions became even louder.

Watching as the ice from her saint attributes’ power had covered Huang Xiaolong’s torso, Zhao Ya spoke, “Your Highness Huang Xiaolong, you lose!”

Huang Xiaolong replied calmly, “Not necessarily!”

Zhao Ya’s brows furrowed. Huang Xiaolong’s half of the body was covered in ice, yet he was refusing to admit defeat. Initially, her intention was to make Huang Xiaolong give up on his own, as this could be considered as leaving Huang Xiaolong some face. Naturally, this was also their Clear Snow Palace Master’s wish.

Exactly at this time, a brilliant light enveloped Huang Xiaolong as one complete dao saint godhead flew out of his body.

As soon as this complete dao saint godhead appeared, thousands of dragons circled it, and Huang Xiaolong’s immediate vicinity turned into a kingdom of dragons, exuding roiling dragon might.

The appearance of this complete dao saint godhead shocked the crowd, and they felt surreal.

“This, this complete dao saint godhead is the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead! How is it possible?! How can it be the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead??!!!”

“Isn’t Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead?!”

Even the Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun’s eyes widened in shock.

The Heavenly Master, Lord Long, the other two Primal Ancestors, Wu Ge, and the present Holy Heavens’ experts were just as dumbfounded.

The Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead ranked in the top three hundred complete dao saint godheads. It was ranked at two hundred eighty-ninth place!

But a year ago during the testing, the result for Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead was obviously the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead, which ranked nine hundred and sixty-eight!

The saint godhead that had ranked at nine hundred and sixty-eighth place, was now ranked at two hundred and eighty-ninth place!

Almost the difference of seven hundred places!

“Then, was the past year’s result incorrect?” The Clear Snow Palace’s Ji Xinyi voiced her doubt in a stupefied expression.

The Clear Snow Palace Master Xue Lingyun shook her head, “It cannot be wrong! Moreover, during the testing, there were a lot of holy lands’ experts present, who witnessed the whole process!”

“If nothing went wrong, then it means that within a year’s time, Huang Xiaolong’s saint godhead has evolved to the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead?!” Tan Juan surmised with an incredulous expression.

Evolved! In one year, from the Chaos Essence Divine Dragon Saint Godhead to the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead!

“This kid, could it possibly be...?” Tyrant Chu almost stuttered. Just moments ago, the four of them had tried guessing how far Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead could have evolved into the top five hundred. It was already an astounding result to think of in their opinion, yet...!

It was not in the top five hundred!

And it was not in the top four hundred either!

The crowd of experts around the plaza erupted in a furor.

On the stage, dragon qi roiled vigorously around Huang Xiaolong, morphing into countless blood-colored dragons.

“Blood Dragon Saint Bloodline! Rank two hundred and ninety-eight!”

In the next moment, thick and sharp black dragon scales appeared over Huang Xiaolong’s skin like an armor at rapid speed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“The Black Dragon Saint Physique! Rank three hundred and four!”

Upon seeing that both Huang Xiaolong’s saint bloodline and saint physique had also risen into the top four hundred rankings, the experts gasped in shock.

Di Huai’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest in shock. Huang Xiaolong’s saint attributes’ improvement earlier was already shocking enough, but who knew the shock it brought this time was even bigger!

“This, this is not real, right?” Chen Chunlai stammered.

Yu Fujiang sneered coldly, “Even if this is true, so what? Though his saint godhead is the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead, he still won’t be able to defeat the Clear Snow Palace’s Zhao Ya!”

Yu Fujiang’s ridiculing words failed to hide the shock in his eyes.

Then again, like what he said, even if Huang Xiaolong’s complete dao saint godhead had evolved to the Tuo Divine Dragon Saint Godhead, his strength was far from enough to defeat Zhao Ya.

In this short time, the thick layer of ice was still extending upwards in a slow but steady pace, inching up Huang Xiaolong’s neck.
