Chapter 2127: Meeting Di Jing Again

When the little cow heard the King of Darkness muttering under his breath, she puffed up her chest and declared, “Why don’t we just grab Wan Xiaorong today?! If you grab her today and ** her, they won’t be able to carry out the wedding ceremony tomorrow!”

Everyone stared at the little cow, and their backs were drenched in a cold sweat.

?!?!?!?!

Even someone like Huang Xiaolong, who was used to her nonsense, couldn’t help but turn speechless.

Despite the initial wave of shock they felt, Cang Mutian soon roared with laughter, “She’s right! We should just grab her today so that they won’t be able to carry out the ceremony tomorrow! Whether you do that or not, our enmity with the Heavenly World wouldn’t be affected. We’re arch enemies anyway, and the old b*stard wants to kill Huang Xiaolong. Why should we avoid triggering them any further?!”

“Since they want to carry out a huge celebration tomorrow, we’ll mess up their plans!”

It was extremely clear Cang Mutian sided with the little cow on this matter.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he heard their idea. A bitter smile appeared on his face, and he said, “Let’s talk about this tomorrow. Crashing the wedding ceremony was one matter, but kidnapping someone before the wedding would put them in a bad light.

Right as Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived at the mountain range, the disciples who were running back to report to their old ancestor ran into a group of disciples from the law enforcement faction of the Heavenly World.

The moment they saw the captain of the group, a light lit up in the eyes of all the disciples of the Dark Curses Sect. “We greet Lord Di Jing!”

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the captain they saw was the Heavenly Prince, Di Jing. With his relationship with Xu Yang along with his strength, he had managed to obtain the position of a captain in the law enforcement faction in the Heavenly World.

One couldn’t look at how he was just a mere captain of a small group in the Heavenly World. The authority possessed by members of the law enforcement faction wasn’t something other people could challenge. Even the Emperor Realm ancestors had to fawn over him.

The Dark Curses Sect’s disciple, who saw Di Jing, was called Li Jun. Several months ago, he had managed to get close to Di Jing, and their relationship couldn’t be considered too bad.

“Old brother Li Jun! What’s up!” Di Jing smiled and nodded at Li Jun the moment he saw the group of disciples from the Dark Curses Sect.

“Lord Di Jing, you need to uphold justice for our Dark Curses Sect!” Li Jun cried out as he described everything that went down when they last met Huang Xiaolong. Despite their sorry outcome, Li Jun didn’t exaggerate, and he told Di Jing everything that happened without altering a single detail.

When Di Jing heard the story, he swallowed a mouthful of saliva in shock.

The personal disciple of the Dark Curses Old Ancestor was killed in the Heavenly World?!

The old ancestor of the Dark Curses Sect was an overlord! The matter of his personal disciple being killed in the Heavenly World was no small matter.

“We hope Lord Di Jing will be able to capture the culprit!” Li Jun pleaded with Di Jing.

Without a second thought, Di Jing agreed. “Brother Li Jun, you don’t have to worry. Since the other party dared to ignore the rules of the Heavenly World, we will capture them for sure! We shall punish them according to the rules in order to uphold justice!”

He turned around and spoke to the other members of his group, “Go locate the murderers.”

“Yes, Lord Di Jing!” One of the disciples of the law enforcement faction bowed before leaving.

A look of joy appeared on Li Jun’s face as he thanked, “Many thanks to Lord Di Jing! You are the most impartial captain in the law enforcement faction!”

According to him, Di Jing making a move was better than his old ancestor moving against Huang Xiaolong and the others. After all, Di Jing was part of the Heavenly World’s law enforcement faction. His words carried the authority of the Heavenly World!

When Li Jun thought about Huang Xiaolong’s sorry expression when Di Jing caught him, a sneer formed on his lips. He refused to believe that a bunch of nobodies would be able to remain arrogant when Di Jing captured them.

Very quickly, the disciple of the law enforcement faction located Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard.

With Di Jing in the lead, everyone charged towards the courtyard.

It didn’t take long for them to barge their way over to the Solitary Horn Peak where Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard was located.

When the members of the Solitary Horn Peak realized that a group of law enforcers were at their doorsteps, they couldn’t help but stare at the group in shock and fear.

“It’s the law enforcement faction! Heavenly Prince Di Jing is personally leading them! What’s going on?!” Several old ancestors stared at each other, and a puzzled look appeared in their eyes.

“I have no idea. However, it has to be something important if the law enforcement faction moved out!”

“I got some disciples under me to investigate. As it turned out, someone killed the personal disciple of the Dark Curses Old Ancestor! They are currently located in one of the courtyards in our Solitary Horn Peak!”

“What?! Who has the guts to kill the Dark Curses Old Ancestor’s personal disciple in the Heavenly World?! Isn’t he just looking to die?! I’ve heard that Tian Chen invited the Dark Curses Old Ancestor to be one of the special guests at his wedding! Those people who killed his disciples are definitely in trouble. Everyone related to them might even be wiped out in order to send a message!”

Everyone on the Solitary Horn Peak started to discuss with each other.

When Di Jing and the others were charging towards Huang Xiaolong’s courtyard, he was seated in the pavilion in his courtyard as he enjoyed the beautiful scenery around him.

The pavilion was located in an awesome location, and Huang Xiaolong could see the Heavenly World’s beauty just by looking down the mountain.

“The Heavenly World is really pretty...” Huang Xiaolong sighed, “It wouldn’t be a bad thing to enjoy my last years here...”

The words came from the bottom of his heart, and if given a choice, Huang Xiaolong would definitely choose to live out the rest of his days in seclusion in the Heavenly World with his loved ones.

The little cow stared at Huang Xiaolong and snickered, “Wait till you beat that old man down. Once you chase him away, the Heavenly World will become yours! If you want to stay here forever, just do whatever you want!”

Even though she was joking around, that was the truth.

As long as Huang Xiaolong defeated the Heavenly Master, it didn’t matter what happened to the old man. He could flee, or he could die at Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Whatever the case, Huang Xiaolong could take over the Heavenly World, and no one would dare to say a word. Of course, the most important thing Huang Xiaolong had to do was to defeat the old man.

“Of course, the Heavenly World’s Treasury wouldn’t lose out to the All-Heavens Treasury!” The little cow licked her lips and chuckled.

With the Heavenly Master’s identity, his treasury would contain a shocking amount of treasures.

The King of Grandmist turned to Huang Xiaolong and warned, “Xiaolong, even though you’re at the late-Fifth Order Sovereign Realm, you need to be careful when dealing with the Heavenly Master. Even people like us have no idea how strong he is!”

“I know...”

It was true. No matter how prepared Huang Xiaolong seemed, he wasn’t fully confident in taking on the Heavenly Master.

He had only managed to absorb half of the energy contained in the lightning bead in his three years of seclusion. Huang Xiaolong wasn’t confident in sweeping through the lands unhindered with his current strength. Of course, if he had more time to refine the lightning energy stored in the bead, he would have refined the bead completely. When that happened, even if several Heavenly Masters popped up out of nowhere, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could take them all on at the same time.

“Brat, how dare you kill the personal disciple of our Dark Curses Old Ancestor?! Captain Di Jing of the law enforcement faction is here to judge your crimes! Get out here to receive your punishment!” A roar broke the tranquility and a frown formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face.

The person who yelled was precisely Li Jun.

Everyone stared at the space outside with a weird look on their faces.

“Captain Di Jing?” A smile soon broke out on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Let’s go meet our old friend.” It was true that he hadn’t seen Di Jing in a long time. The last time they had met, they had fought in the Battle of the Heavenly Court!

Before long, Huang Xiaolong brought everyone out to meet Di Jing.

The instant Huang Xiaolong appeared, Di Jing surrounded the courtyard with the other disciples of the law enforcement faction.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
