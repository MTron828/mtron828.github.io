Chapter 2930: Work for Huang Shuai?

As though she was afraid Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t recognize her, Liu Xinxin snapped, “I am the direct disciple of Grand Hall Master Li Xue, Liu Xinxin!”

“He’s the young patriarch of the Dragon Fish Creed, Lin Zhuoyi!”

Huang Xiaolong casually raised his eyebrows in response. “Oh? Are you here to take revenge for Yu Zhou?”

Liu Xinxin exploded with rage when she saw Huang Xiaolong’s lacklustre response to her revelation. Pointing at Huang Xiaolong, she growled, “Huang Xiaolong, do you think you’re better than all of us because you have eleven high-order Saint Fates?!”

“Do you have eleven high-order Saint Fates?” Huang Xiaolong finally turned to face her and he asked with an expressionless face.

Freezing on the spot, Liu Xinxin had no idea how to reply to his shameless question.

“I hate people who cuss me out when pointing at me. If you do it again, I’ll rip out all your fingers.” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Liu Xinxin was enraged and she yelled at Huang Xiaolong, “Who do you think you are?! You’re a mere Primal Ancestor, learn your place!” She prepared to make a move on Huang Xiaolong as soon as she spoke.

However, Lin Zhuoyi stopped her from making the worst mistake in her life. He turned to look at Huang Xiaolong, and he started to speak. “Huang Xiaolong, you committed a serious crime by destroying the body of a core disciple of the Dragon Fish Creed. I hope that you can hand over their dao souls now. During the ceremony, you shall apologize to the world and agree to submit to His Highness, Huang Shuai. If you agree to do this, my master will pardon you for the sake of your eleven high-order Saint Fates.”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but laugh when he heard what Lin Zhuoyi said. “You want me to serve Huang Shuai?”

When they heard how Huang Xiaolong addressed Huang Shuai by name, their expression sank. It was especially so for Liu Xinxin, as Huang Shuai was the person she looked up to the most. She refused to hear anyone disrespecting him.

Huang Xiaolong continued before she could speak, “Get Huang Shuai to submit to me. He should know his place.”

What?!

Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin weren’t the only ones who questioned their hearing when he spoke. Even Hu Xiaoqian and Du Limei’s expressions changed.

Huang Xiaolong’s words were enough to get his entire clan exterminated, and more.

Who was Huang Shuai?! He was the Son of Creation! How dare Huang Xiaolong ask someone of his level to submit to him?!

“How dare you!”

“Preposterous!”

The four of them yelled in unison.

“Enough!” A voice rang through the hall, and a middle aged man made his entrance.

When they saw the newcomer, everyone suppressed their anger.

“Branch Pavilion Master Zeng Lei!” The four of them greeted him respectfully as soon as he appeared.

Even though the four of them made their greetings, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother getting to his feet. With his strength and status, a mere Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable like Zeng Lei wasn’t worth his time.

A trace of rage flashed through Zeng Lei’s heart when he noticed Huang Xiaolong’s actions, but he quickly suppressed his anger. Even the Blue Lotus Dao Venerable had to bow respectfully in his presence.

However, he endured it as he needed Huang Xiaolong’s help to refine his pill.

“Young Master Huang…” Zeng Lei strode into the hall and greeted Huang Xiaolong with a smile on his face.

When the four saw how Zeng Lei treated Huang Xiaolong, they couldn’t help but feel that something was wrong.

“Pavilion Branch Master Zeng Lei…” Huang Xiaolong nodded slightly and he remained in his place.

Rage overwhelmed Zeng Lei, and he nearly made a move on Huang Xiaolong right there and then.

“Palace Master Zeng Lei, where’s the twenty strands of beginning qi you promised me?” Ignoring the smouldering Zeng Lei, Huang Xiaolong asked about his rewards instantly.

“Twenty strands of beginning qi?!” Lin Zhuoyi, Liu Xinxin, Hu Xiaoqian, and Du Limei gasped in shock. It was especially so for Hu Xiaoqian, as her eyes widened in surprise. The strands of qi were the reason she came!

Zeng Lei felt his lips twitching when Huang Xiaolong asked about the strands of qi. He chuckled in response, “Young Master Huang, I have long since prepared them.” He retrieved a spatial ring and passed it over to Huang Xiaolong as soon as he spoke.

When Huang Xiaolong checked the contents, he saw strands of beginning qi swirling in the space within as they emitted grey gas.

That was the beginning qi he was talking about, and there were exactly twenty strands.

Strands of beginning qi were split into different levels, and those in the ring were all of the mid-grade or higher! One could see the effort Zeng Lei put into gathering them.

Nodding his head in satisfaction, Huang Xiaolong kept them all.

“Hold it!” Hu Xiaoqian, who was standing by the side, yelled in haste all of a sudden. “Pavilion Branch Master Zeng Lei, how much are they? I will buy them all!”

Zeng Lei was stunned, but he shook his head and laughed slowly, “Young Lady Xiaoqian, I have promised to give them to Young Master Huang. They are no longer mine.”

“One hundred million Tuoshen dao coins! I will pay a hundred million for each strand!” Hu Xiaoqian didn’t give up.

Shaking his head again, Zeng Lei said, “I’ve made myself clear. They are no longer mine.” No matter how much money she offered, there was no way he could give them to her! Otherwise, he would have wasted his efforts for the past tens of years! He needed Huang Xiaolong to craft his pills, and that was of utmost priority!

“Branch Pavilion Master Zeng Lei, I know that you still have ten strands of beginning qi. I wish to buy them all with a billion Tuoshen dao coins.” Hu Xiaoqian gritted her teeth and made an offer.

Her sources told her that he managed to obtain thirty strands of qi, and she was right.

Zeng Lei turned to look at Huang Xiaolong and a crafty thought flashed through his mind. “Young Lady Xiaoqian, I will have to apologize. They will soon belong to Young Master Huang as per our agreement.”

Hu Xiaoqian and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

“Huang Xiaolong, our young lady will buy them off you for a hundred million a strand!” Du Limei snapped at Huang Xiaolong all of a sudden.

Of course, he wouldn’t bother staring at someone like her.

“You!” With rage brewing in her heart, Du Limei glared at Huang Xiaolong. No matter what, she was a vice hall master of the Red Fox Creed. She was also a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, and never had anyone dared to ignore her presence.

“What? Are you planning to snatch it from me?” Huang Xiaolong turned around all of a sudden to glance at her.

If she was planning to, he didn’t mind killing her off to warn the rest. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ahem!” Zeng Lei coughed dryly and interrupted, “Vice Hall Master, this is the Mystical Pavilion. Young Master Huang is my esteemed guest, and I hope you will control yourself.”

Du Limei glared at Huang Xiaolong, but she eventually decided against doing anything.

Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin stared at Huang Xiaolong and she spoke all of a sudden, “Pavilion Branch Master Zeng, we heard about the sale of the peerless dragon spear in the Mystical Pavilion. We are here for that.”

Huang Xiaolong’s heart trembled slightly when he heard what they said.

The Immemorial Sword was useful, but it was no longer able to withstand his energy. He had long since thought of changing a weapon.
