Chapter 3635 – Where’s Mine?

The experts she dragged over were peak-level Dao Venerables. They might be important figures in the region, but in front of a God of Creation with more than 14 billion units of grand cosmos energy, they were barely specks of dust. Facing her face, they felt their souls leaving their bodies.

With their lips trembling, the experts of the various families didn’t dare to utter a word.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but roar with laughter, “How are they going to reply you when you scare them like that?!”

Retrieving her aura completely, an embarrassed smile formed on her face. In front of Huang Xiaolong, she became a demure young lady. With her breathtaking appearance to back her up, the atmosphere changed immediately.

Yu Xiaohong created the celestial empire, but the celestial emperor wasn’t related to her by blood. He was a foster son she took in. Since the start of time, she hadn’t found a dao partner.

Zheng Shen and the others looked at Yu Xiaohong and weird looks formed on their faces.

“Alright, all of us wish to know about the recent happenings in the celestial empire. Please tell us all you know.” Huang Xiaolong addressed the Dao Venerables Yu Xiaohong dragged over. “Of course, we’ll give you something for your troubles.”

After speaking, he tossed over a bottle of pills.

“Creation… Creation level pills!” One of them gasped after opening the bottle

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong muttered and he asked about the matters regarding the celestial empire.

They replied respectfully, without any intentions of hiding a thing. Since he could take out creation pills like they were nothing, they didn’t dare to offend someone at his level.

After asking about it, Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother them. He left with Yu Xiaohong and the others after learning what he wanted to know.

The few of them only straightened their backs when Huang Xiaolong’s party left.

They couldn’t regain their calm even after a long time.

“Don’t… Don’t tell me… Are they all God of Creation Realm experts?!” Someone stammered.

“There’s no way! Whatever the case, I can confirm that someone in that group isn’t a God of Creation.”

It was true. Tao Hang was a Dao Venerable weaker than them and they could easily feel his level of cultivation.

“That woman… She seems to be the old ancestor of the Xiaohong Celestial Empire!” Someone gasped in fright all of a sudden.

Silence filled the lands.

“This… There’s no way…” Someone muttered in surprise. “Is that really Lord Yu Xiaohong?! Didn’t they say that she was trapped in the Bewilderment Island?! Everyone knows that! Even if Lord Zhu Chen makes a move, he might not be able to save her! If she really is the lord ancestor, why would she be that youngster’s subordinate?!”

“That’s true…”

“My eyelids can’t stop jumping… Seems like something huge is going to happen.”

…

After they left, Yu Xiaohong’s expression was extremely unsightly.

No one would feel great when they learned that the faction they created was going to submit to someone else!

They were betraying her in broad daylight!

Moreover, the person who betrayed her was her foster son! She gave him the best resources before she entered the Bewilderment Island, and she would personally look for treasures when he broke through in the past! After so many years, she didn’t expect him to throw himself under another banner!

“That’s his true nature…” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

“I was blind to treat him so well!” Yu Xiaohong paused for a second before she cotninued, “I need to get to the bottom of this! If he’s really going to submit to Jian Wushuang, I’ll personally clean out my celestial empire of the filth that has accumulated.”

Tao Hang looked at Yu Xiaohong and suddenly thought of Tao Han’er.

Tao Han’er was his foster daughter, but she turned into the princess of the Jian Family in the blink of an eye. He was a mere Dao Venerable of a small family! He was worried that she would turn her back on him when they met.

Complicated emotions filled his heart.

The group eventually made their way over to the imperial palace.

Just as they were about to head into the palace, Yu Dawei, the Xiaohong Celestial Emperor, was tasting a Purple Ice and Fire Dragonfruit in the main hall.

The fruit could only be obtained in the Purple Ice Valley in the region, and it contained the mysteries of the universe. One would benefit immensely if they consumed it often.

The crown prince of the celestial empire, Yu Bo, entered the hall all of a sudden and joked, “Imperial Father, the Jian Family sent over the sword pills their old ancestor personally refined. There is also a sword manual written by Jian Wushuang!”

He soon handed over a box and a bottle.

With his eyes lighting up, Yu Dawei retrieved the items. His gaze was burning and he yelled in joy, “The members of the Jian Family kept their promise! Jian Wushuang’s sword dao is definitely recorded in the manual. As long as I manage to comprehend the mysteries behind the manual, my grand cosmos energy will transform just like his did! I’ll definitely be able to break through the 10 billion mark!”

The items were the terms behind his agreement to submit to the Jian Family.

As for the sword pill, he would be able to cultivate in the way of the sword manual easily.

Yu Bo looked at his father and he started to hesitate. “Imperial Father, what if the old ancestor returns? Wouldn’t she be unhappy that we submitted to the Jian Family?”

That was something he was worried about since the start of their plan.

Waving his son off, Yu Dawei explained, “Do you really think that that old hag will be able to make it out of the Bewilderment Island? The Limitless Master and the king of the Ocean Race barely made it out after working with each other. She will never be able to escape!”

“Moreover, the Jian Family is our backer now! Jian Wushuang is the sixth supreme overlord in the Unknown Space, and she wouldn’t dare to touch us now that we’re under his banner!”

Yu Bo sighed, “Imperial Father is right… Now that we chose to submit to the Jian Family, it’s a matter of time before the rise of our celestial empire!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“That’s right! The envoys of the Jian Family will arrive tomorrow to secure our alliance. Get rid of everyone who tries to sabotage our union! Throw them all into prison! I won’t allow anyone to disrupt my plans!”

“Imperial Father, rest assured that everything will run smoothly.”

“I’ll be more than happy to hand it over to you. Relax. After we secure our place in the Jian Family, I will definitely reward you heavily!”

Before Yu Bo could leave, a sharp voice rang through the air. “Where’s my share? Aren’t you guys going to get some goodies from the Jian Family?”

Yu Dawei and Yu Bo felt a bomb going off in their heads when they heard the familiar voice. Panic flashed through their eyes.
