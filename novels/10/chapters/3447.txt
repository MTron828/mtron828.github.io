Chapter 3448: Northern Court Heavenly Empire

“Haha! The eggs are really here! There are even two of them!”

“The Fourth Princess will definitely be overjoyed by our discovery this time!”

Amidst their laughter, they passed the flying ship while ignoring Huang Xiaolong’s group completely.

When Li Wei and the others saw the insignia on their robes, their faces changed instantly.

“Northern Court Celestial Empire!”

By the time their yells filled the air, the six of them had already arrived before the eggs. Right before they accomplished their mission of obtaining the eggs, a shockwave sent all six of them tumbling through the air.

Setting with rage, all of them turned to stare at Huang Xiaolong.

“What do you mean by this?!” They snapped in unison while glaring at Huang Xiaolong.

“What do I mean?” Huang Xiaolong looked at them with an expression of mockery on his face. “Do I have to remind you that I’m the one who found the treasure?”

The six of them stared at him in shock.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

They hadn’t thought of that before.

After all, every expert in the area would clear out the moment they noticed members of the Northern Court Celestial Empire. No one would be crazy enough to fight with them over something.

“Are you sure you wish to fight with my Northern Court Celestial Empire for these eggs?” the beauty among them snarled. Even though she was threatening Huang Xiaolong, her voice was pretty soothing to the ears.

“Sorry, I haven’t heard of your celestial empire.” Huang Xiaolong crossed his arms behind his back and smiled. “You better get this straight though… Are you sure you wish to offend me in order to obtain the treasure?”

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t care less if he had the eggs or not. However, their actions irritated him. First, they ignored the entire group when approaching the eggs, and now, they were threatening him!

Those annoying flies really irritated him…

The faces of the six experts from the Northern Court Celestial Empire turned somber.

Li Wei and the others felt panic rising in their hearts.

“Sir, those people are from the Northern Court Celestial Empire! Shouldn’t we…” Li Wei tried to dissuade Huang Xiaolong from going any further.

That was the Northern Court Celestial Empire!

There were only two of those in the Shi Li World!

World Masters of holy worlds were abundant in the Shi Li World, and the Myriad Stars Palace was but a creed-level power. If the Northern Court Celestial Empire wanted to wipe them out, it was but a word away!

Huang Xiaolong stopped Li Wei before she could complete her sentence.

The rugged bearded man waved the axe in his hand, and he roared at Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, do you really think you’re special after comprehending ten elements to the perfection level? Hahaha, our Fourth Princess requested us to bring back the eggs. If you know what’s good for you, scram! Otherwise…”

Before he could finish his sentence, Huang Xiaolong flicked his finger and a ray of light stuck the axe the man was so proud of. Crashing through countless mountain ranges, his axe crumbled into a million pieces.

The other five stared at him with their eyes wide open and a seed of fear was planted in their hearts.

The man who was sent flying had comprehended nine elements to the perfection level, but he couldn’t even stand up against a single strike!

That wasn’t all. They were surprised by the shattered axe! That was a high-grade dao artifact they were talking about! Moreover, the bearded man had nurtured it for countless years with his blood essence.

“Don’t you think you went too far?!” The beauty in the group snapped with a frosty expression. “You won’t be able to gain anything from this!”

“Too far?” Huang Xiaolong remained extremely calm. “I already showed mercy by not killing him. In fact, you guys should be thanking me for my benevolence.”

Their expressions changed once again.

“She should be someone from our Shi Li World…” The lady looked at Li Wei and the flying ship they were on. “You might not be afraid of us, but what about them? Their entire faction might be exterminated because of your actions.”

Her threat couldn’t get any clearer.

Indeed… Fear appeared in the eyes of those from the Myriad Stars Palace.

A smile formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “So we’re resorting to threats now? Do you believe that I’ll strip you naked right now and seal off your true qi? I’ll leave you here as a gift for the beasts or anyone who passes by!”

Panic set in immediately as she took several steps back. Even though she didn’t believe that Huang Xiaolong would do as he said, she wasn’t willing to take the chance. If he followed through with his threat, wouldn’t that mean…

“I am the marshal of the Northern Court Celestial Empire, Lu Ting! How dare you?!” she roared angrily before releasing her aura. She was an expert who had comprehended ten elements to the perfection level!

Raising an eyebrow in amusement, Huang Xiaolong continued, “Oh? Marshal of the empire? This makes me even more inclined to try it out.”

“You!” The sword in her hands started to buzz as her face turned green with anger.

“Marshal, we’ll join hands to take him down!” One of her subordinates stepped forward while glaring at Huang Xiaolong.

Lu Ting’s expression sank, but she managed to suppress her fury. “We’ll meet again.”

After she spoke, she brought the other five away. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the vast space above.

Before the bearded man left, he sent one last glare towards Huang Xiaolong.

Watching them leave, a chuckle left Huang Xiaolong’s lips before he turned to look at the eggs. Even though the eggs wouldn’t be hatching any time soon, Huang Xiaolong could feel the shocking amount of life force growing within. Even if he refined the eggs, he might be able to gain some benefits.

“Sir, about the Northern Court Celestial Empire…” Li Wei squeaked.

“There’s no need to worry.” Huang Xiaolong laughed as he kept the eggs in the Sun and Moon Furnace. “Tell me more about them.”

“Yes.” Li Wei quickly told him everything she knew. However, the Northern Court Celestial Empire and the Myriad Stars Palace were existences on two different scales! She could only paint him a general outline.

There were two celestial empires in the Shi Li World. One of them was the Shi Li Celestial Empire, and the other was the Northern Court Celestial Empire. The Fourth Princess of the Northern Court Celestial Empire was extremely favored by the celestial emperor, and she was an expert who comprehended the twelve elements! Her reputation in the celestial empire was like a sun in the sky, and she was ranked among the top ten experts of the younger generation!

Li Wei felt her heart pounding with fear after she explained the situation to Huang Xiaolong.

“There’s nothing to worry about. If she moves against your Myriad Stars Palace, I’ll deal with it.”

Thanking Huang Xiaolong profusely, Li Wei had no choice but to believe him.

Traveling for another month, they closed in on the deepest part of the Dragon Cave.

“Sir… Shouldn’t we start heading out?” Li Wei hesitated slightly before asking Huang Xiaolong.

Dragon qi filled the space before them and everyone could feel a horrifying pressure coming from the deepest part of the Dragon Cave.

After thinking about it, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Wait for me here. I’ll be back in three days.” Laying down a formation to protect their flying ship, Huang Xiaolong flew deeper into the Dragon Cave alone.
