While Xing Tian made preparations to enter the Kingdom of Devil Beasts, Huang Xiaolong had the ten Undead Netherguards’ captains to maneuver the Netherking Flying Ship carefully through the dense miasma inside the Mara Plains. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although the miasma hindered a cultivator’s divine sense and other prying methods, Huang Xiaolong did not dare to be careless when his enemy was an existence like Shi Ming.

Inside the Netherking Flying Ship’s cabin, Huang Xiaolong involuntarily coughed up a mouthful of blood, and his face was deathly pale. He was too careless this time. Who would have thought that Shi Ming’s strength had reached such a terrifying degree? He had initially thought the four odd beasts’ strength was sufficient to deal with Shi Ming. Even if they were slightly weaker, he had anticipated leaving the Eternal Devil City unscathed...

He was lucky there were Xing Tian and Wang Teng to help him.

However, as the Heavenless Devil Legion’s captain, Wang Teng carried the responsibility of protecting the Eternal Devil City. Thus Huang Xiaolong wasn’t really surprised that Wang Teng had acted. On the other hand, Huang Xiaolong was genuinely astonished that Xing Tian had lent a hand in saving him.

No matter what, he owed them both a big favor.

Gao Changran and Wang Fanning, by Huang Xiaolong’s side, were looking worse for wear. Even though both of them were already high-level Emperor Realm experts, the injuries they had gotten were equally heavy as compared to Huang Xiaolong’s.

The four odd beasts suffered slightly lighter injuries in comparison.

Huang Xiaolong took out seven pellets of Great Brahma Sarira Pills and distributed them to Gao Changran, Wang Fanning, and the four odd beasts. He also swallowed a Great Brahma Sarira Pill and sat down to heal his injuries.

During this time, the Heavenly Hall appeared and hovered above Huang Xiaolong’s head. Under the fourteen Radiance Angels’ godforce, radiance energy rushed down like a waterfall onto Huang Xiaolong and the rest, enveloping all of them.

With the combination of the Great Brahma Sarira Pill and Heavenly Hall’s healing radiance energy, Huang Xiaolong and the others’ injuries healed at a fantastic speed.

Even so, it took several days before Huang Xiaolong’s injuries healed completely.

Luckily, there was the Heavenly Hall’s radiance energy that consistently purified Shi Ming’s overbearing death qi inside everyone’s body during this time. Otherwise, it would have taken them several years to heal and completely expel the death qi.

Huang Xiaolong and the four odd beasts’ injuries roughly healed around the same duration, while Gao Changran and Wang Fanning were still sitting cross-legged as their bodies continued to mend.

After some thinking, Huang Xiaolong had the Undead Netherguards’ captains drive the Netherking Flying Ship out of the Mara Plains and choose a secluded location to fix the flying ship.

While at it, Huang Xiaolong also mended the Black Dragon Divine Armor.

This time, the Netherking Flying Ship and Black Dragon Divine Armor had suffered a great deal of damage. Still, with the Undead Netherguards, the four odd beasts, as well as the fourteen-winged Radiance Angels, not to mention the treasures inside the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Treasury, Huang Xiaolong estimated he could patch everything up in ten days.

Ten days earlier or ten days later wouldn’t make much of a difference when it came to the two devil steles.

With the efforts of one hundred Undead Netherguards, four odd beasts, and fourteen Radiance Angels for ten consecutive days, the Netherking Flying Ship and Black Dragon Divine Armor were, more or less, mended. However, it couldn’t be said that both artifacts were as good as new. It was tolerable for Huang Xiaolong.

Ten days later, with the Heavenly Hall’s assistance, Gao Changran and Wang Fanning’s injuries were almost healed completely.

However, when Huang Xiaolong was about to embark into the Kingdom of Devil Beasts, strong energy fluctuations suddenly came from the distance in front of them.

More than a dozen auras were moving towards the Netherking Flying Ship at rapid speed in a short while.

“Your Majesty, someone is being hunted. Several of the pursuers are high-level Emperor Realm experts. Gao Changran listened to the surroundings’ movements attentively then reported to Huang Xiaolong. “They are within three million li range from us and would come upon us soon.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

“Your Majesty, should we make a detour to avoid them?” Wang Fanning inquired Huang Xiaolong’s opinion.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and gave a firm, “Not necessary.”

The Netherking Flying Ship’s defensive formations were activated, raising protective barriers over the flying ship. Even the high-level Emperor Realm experts wouldn’t be able to discover the Netherking Flying Ship even if they got close. Hence, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about that.

Then again, even if these pursuers discovered them, it was merely a few high-level Emperor Realm experts.

It didn’t take long for the two parties to appear within Huang Xiaolong’s sight. There were more than a dozen people about a hundred li away.

The destructive powers of their attacks damaged the mountain ranges around the Netherking Flying Ship, gravels, boulders, and the earth crumbled and cracked at the world’s end.

There were only four people in the group being hunted. One of them was an Eighth Order Emperor Realm, two Fifth Order Emperor Realms, and the last one was merely a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm.

All four were wolvesmen.

Their pursuers consisted of twelve people. There were just three high-level Emperor Realm experts, while the remaining nine people’s cultivation ranged between low-level to mid-level Emperor Realm.

However, as the four people in front got closer, Gao Changran exclaimed with a dramatic expression, “It’s people from the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire!”

Huang Xiaolong was a little astonished hearing that.

With the Mara Plains as the boundary, one side was the Kingdom of Devil Beasts, while the other side was the Devil Races’ haven. However, the Kingdom of Devil Beasts was merely a general term. In truth, there were several hundred thousand devil beast empires, both big and small. Among them, there were nine big empires.

More than half of this world of devil beasts were ruled by these nine empires.

The Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire was one of the nine big empires. Moreover, it ranked fourth amongst the nine empires.

In the vast world of devil beasts, one could imagine how powerful the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire was to be able to rank fourth.

It was by no means an exaggeration to say the Heavenly Punishment Archdevil and Heavenly Punishment Sect’s experts would have to yield if they encountered experts of the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire’s experts here, where devil beasts dominated.

The Devil World’s devil beasts could take human form. Despite that, they still retained specific unique characteristics. For example, even after taking human form, experts of the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire would have a blue lion’s tail, and their features, too, would carry traits of a blue lion.

The more common devil beasts’ height reached three meters on average after taking human form. This was much taller than normal humans.

There were both advantages and disadvantages for these devil beasts after taking human form; one of the benefits was using both human and devil beasts’ techniques and divine arts; however, their physical bodies were significantly weaker.

In their beasts’ form, these devil beasts wouldn’t be able to use any human race’s techniques or divine arts. On the contrary, they would have extremely powerful physiques, enabling them to use their innate abilities.

By this time, these two groups of people were merely a few li from the Netherking Flying Ship.

A young man from the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire fixed a fierce glare on the peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm young wolf-girl and spoke coldly, “Lu Xiaoqing, right? Knowing this would be the result, you should have obediently told the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s whereabouts. You all wouldn’t have suffered so much.”

“If you tell us the whereabouts of the Myriad Curses Devil Stele now, we promise to let you all die more comfortably.”

“Or else, hehe...”

This young man clearly headed the dozen Devil-eyed Blue Lion pursuers. Though this young man’s strength was only at the mid-First Order Emperor Realm, he undoubtedly held a high status in the Devil-eyed Blue Lion Empire.

Huang Xiaolong, Gao Changran, and Wang Fanning were wide-eyed as they listened to the other sides’ conversation. The Myriad Curses Devil Stele?Could it be that those four wolvesmen have clues about the Myriad Curses Devil Stele’s whereabouts?

The wolf-girl Lu Xiaoqing’s face was twisted as she smirked, but there was intense hatred in her eyes, “Even if we die, we won’t tell you one word where the Myriad Curses Devil Stele is, and if we survived this, there would be a day when I tear the flesh off your bones bite by bite!”
