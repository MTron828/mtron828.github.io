Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, “Of course.” He hadn’t shown interest in the Ancestor God’s Buddha bones to merely anger the Xiao Family’s disciples, but because he really wanted to buy them.

After Huang Xiaolong had gotten the Eidolon Crystalline Rocks, he had been meaning to reforge the Godly Mt. Xumi, Mulberry Sword, Heavenly Devil Snake Sword, Ghost-Buddha Ring, Ghost Buddha Divine Cauldron, and even the Devil Restraining Tablet and the Moon Jade Heavenly Spiral Shell.

Huang Xiaolong needed materials containing Buddhism energy in order to reforge the Godly Mt. Xumi and Phasless Divine Boat, and fortunately the Ancestor God’s Buddha bones were one of the ideal materials.

The shop owner’s apprehension disappeared, and he smiled brilliantly. He courteously requested Huang Xiaolong to wait for a moment as he hurried to the inner hall. He returned swiftly with a white jade box in his arms.

The white jade box was about the size of two palms, and it was neither too big or too small. However, when the shop owner opened the white jade box, it revealed the spacious interior of the box; and inside it, was a pile of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones, glowing in sacred aureate light.

Each piece of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones had a layer of Buddhism luminance around them that was filled with vigorous Buddhism energy.

Huang Xiaolong felt his Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead slightly quivered.

“All of these bones come from high-level Ancestor God Realm masters’ Ancestor God’s Buddha bones.” The little cow commented, “Pity, that none of these bones are complete.”

Every Ancestor God’s Buddha bones were either missing an entire arm’s bones, or a leg, or other parts.

Even so, Huang Xiaolong could barely contain his excitement. This batch of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones were all Ancestor God Realm masters’ Ancestor God’s Buddha bones, much better than what he had expected.

“This batch of Ancestor God’s Buddha bones, I want all of them. So, name your price.” Huang Xiaolong said to the shop owner.

The shop owner carefully quoted his price, “Five trillion, is that an acceptable amount for you? Or you can pay me with half of a low grade six spiritual vein.”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t even bargain in the slightest. He threw a spatial ring to the shop owner and said, “There’s six trillion shenbi inside that spatial ring, check it.”

As per his judgment, Huang Xiaolong could tell that the worth of these Ancestor God’s Buddha bones was more than five trillion, almost closer to six trillion.

“No-no-no, that’s too much. I, I’ll charge you 5.5 trillion.” The shop owner waved his hands shakily. Huang Xiaolong accepted the shop owner’s offer.

After putting away the white jade box containing Ancestor God’s Buddha bones, Huang Xiaolong inquired if the shop owner had any other valuable Buddhism related items. The shop owner hesitated for a while, before taking out a blackish round bead that was exuding a strong Buddhism energy. It was as big as both of the fists of an adult man. Huang Xiaolong couldn’t see anything peculiar about this item, except that it was a Buddhism item.

“I found this Buddhist prayer bead in an ancient cultivation dwelling. I have asked quite a few people to appraise this prayer bead, but no one was able to identify it precisely. Nonetheless, this Buddhist prayer bead is extraordinary. If Senior wants to buy it... my price is t-ten trillion...?”

Huang Xiaolong picked up the Buddhist prayer bead between his fingers and looked at it doubtfully from left to right. He turned to look at the little cow to seek her opinion and she nodded her head heavily.

In truth, Huang Xiaolong was surprised, but he absolutely believed in the little cow’s judgement. Thus, he paid ten trillion to the shop owner and bought the Buddhist prayer bead.

A while later, as Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the shop, he told the shop owner to contact him if he were to find more high-level Ancestor God’s Buddha bones.

The shop owner quickly nodded his head, as he warmly and courteously walked Huang Xiaolong out of his shop.

Huang Xiaolong finally asked the little cow after leaving the Buddhism Awareness Shop, “What kind of Buddhist prayer bead is it?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But the little cow’s answer was, “That is not a Buddhist prayer bead.”

“Not a prayer bead?!” Huang Xiaolong, Xu Baisheng, Feng Er, and the rest were equally surprised.

The little cow explained, “This is a Cloud-Winged Dragon Beast’s demon bead. The Cloud-Winged Dragon Beast is a rare grandmist spiritual beast of the Buddha World. The Cloud-Wind Dragon Beast is born with an innate Buddha body, and a demon bead forms inside their bodies like a beast core, called winged-Buddha bead. In other words, the bead that you just bought is called the winged-Buddha bead. This bead can be used to refine a grandmist spiritual artifact, and can also be used in cultivation. It is a rare and precious treasure for the people with Buddha physiques, or Buddhism element godforce.”

Huang Xiaolong and the others were a little surprised.

This round black thing was actually a demon bead from inside of a Buddha World’s grandmist spiritual beast!

In other words, it was definitely worth buying this winged-Buddha bead.

Anything that was in a tiniest bit related to grandmist spiritual beast would usually cost an exorbitant prices. Even if it was a grandmist spiritual beast’s fart, it would be a treasure that experts in the Divine World would fight head and feet for getting their hands on it.

Huang Xiaolong put the winged-Buddha bead away.

The group continued to stroll around the city, and only returned to the courtyard when the sky had darkened.

As planned, Huang Xiaolong’s group departed from the Stone Buddha City the next day and travelled towards the Xiao Family’s headquarters in Xiao City. Five days later, they arrived in the Xiao City.

Upon entering the city, Huang Xiaolong could see Xiao Family’s disciples everywhere; their cultivation realms ranged from low-level Ancient God Realm to Ancestor God Realm. There were also countless other forces’ people, but merchants were the most prominent group among them.

Even though Xiao City was the second biggest city on Stone Buddha Mainland, it was renowned as the largest medicinal pellets trading city in the Clear Spirit World as well as in the neighboring world surfaces. Everyday, people from other world surfaces visited Xiao City to buy or sell medicinal pellets.

Huang Xiaolong leisurely strolled the streets of Xiao City. Almost all the shops sold medicinal pellets of various sizes, from cultivation medicinal pellets to healing pellets, or even medicinal pellets for specific purposes. Huang Xiaolong was bedazzled by this extensive variety of pellets.

Although Xiao Teng was only the First Order Ancestor God Realm cultivator, his talent was excellent. Hence, his status in Xiao Family was very high, and he was considered as one of the top Xiao Family’s Elders. Xiao Teng’s residence was located at the most prosperous street in Xiao City, therefore, it was very easy to find it.

When Huang Xiaolong’s group arrived at Xiao Teng’s Meteoric Soar Manor, they saw a lively crowd in front of it. There was a joyous atmosphere in the air, seemingly, an indication of an on-going celebration.

Various forces’ experts had come to congratulate Xiao Teng, and were crowding the entrance of his manor.

Huang Xiaolong stopped a sect disciple who was walking towards Xiao Teng’s manor and asked him about the reason behind this crowd and the festivities. Soon, he learned that Xiao Teng was actually accepting a disciple, and it was the day of the apprenticeship ceremony.

“I have heard that this is Xiao Teng’s twenty-third female disciple, and she is quite a beauty.”

“Female disciple? In ugly words, she’s Xiao Teng’s twenty-third concubine. Which of the female disciples he has ‘accepted’ so far do not dual cultivate with him every night, while serving him day and night?”

“Also, it is said that when Xiao Teng was promoted as Xiao Family’s Elder after he broke through to Ancestor God Realm, he even ‘tasted’ his previous Ancient God Realm Master’s wife. Tsk, tsk, what a peculiar taste!”

“Ssh-h! Don’t talk about this anymore. There are too many people here, and if Xiao Teng hears us, we’re dead for sure. I have heard the Xiao Family’s Young Lord Xiao Zhangyu and Young Lord Chang Fang of the Hundred Tribulations Faction will also come to congratulate Xiao Teng. He’s got quite the favor.”

Not far ahead from him, the two sect disciples’ conversation fell upon Huang Xiaolong’s ears. A mischievous light gleamed in his eyes, ‘Xiao Zhangyu is coming? And Chang Fang too?’

That’s great!

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to step through the entrance to Xiao Teng’s manor, a person who looked like the steward blocked his path, “This guest, have you brought the congratulatory gift in order to pass through the Manor’s main entrance? Our Lord Xiao Teng has specifically ordered to forbid people from entering his manor, if they failed to bear the congratulatory gifts, irrespective of their identities.” He said while pointing at the main entrance.
