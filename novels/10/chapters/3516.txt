Chapter 3517: Higher

“Did you reach 5 billion units?” Huang Long probed.

Before entering seclusion, Huang Xiaolong had accumulated 4.6 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

However, he shook his head and smiled when he heard the question. “Higher.”

Everyone stared at him in shock.

How in the world did he pass the 5 billion mark?!

“5.3 billion?” Pangu asked.

“There’s no way.” Huang Long shook his head.

Huang Xiaolong had only been in seclusion for a million years, and it was impossible for him to improve so much! According to Huang Long, that was something no one could do! Even if Huang Xiaolong crossed the 5 billion mark, he would only barely have crossed it.

Everyone turned to look at him, curious about his improvement.

“5.9 billion,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“What?!” Pangu and the others screamed in fright.

The little dragon’s jaw dropped, and he stared at Huang Xiaolong in fright. “Are you serious?!”

He doubted what he just heard.

However, Huang Xiaolong responded with a casual smile. “That’s right.” In fact, he had crossed the 5.9 billion mark. To be exact, he accumulated 5.91 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

It wouldn't take long for him to break through the 6 billion mark!

Everyone’s eyes widened as they looked at Huang Xiaolong like they were staring at a monster.

Even if someone cultivated with the power of a rocketship, they couldn’t achieve what Huang Xiaolong did!

Not even Pangu and Huang Long would be able to improve by so much in ten billion years!

A look of embarrassment appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face when he noticed the looks he was getting. “Actually, I wasn’t too fast…” He used a lot of time to comprehend the universal laws contained in the Star Dragon Scales. Moreover, he refined all the artifacts he had twice over.

“What are you talking about?!” Pangu roared in shock, and his non-existent beard even trembled a little.

“You’re too damn fast!” Huang Long growled. “Even if I were to take ten billion years, I can’t do what you did!”

Huang Xiaolong grinned in response.

With his current cultivation speed, he would be able to enter the large completion stage of the God of Creation Realm in a hundred million years without the use of any treasures.

Of course, that was a conservative estimate. The star dragon qi was tempering his body and dao soul every second, and his cultivation speed would only grow faster.

With a treasure at the level of the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t cultivate slowly even if he wanted to.

He asked everyone about the events that happened in the past million years.

“The old freak is still waiting outside,” the little dragon snorted.

“Humph. That old man really doesn’t know when to give up,” Pangu sneered.

“Is there news on Chu Huaihao?” Huang Xiaolong changed the topic.

If he could capture Chu Huaihao, he would be able to refine the man’s bloodline and grand cosmos energy! When that happened, his strength would take a huge leap forward. His strength would be comparable to Wang Meiqi when that happened!

At the peak of the large completion stage, she accumulated nearly 7 billion units of grand cosmos energy.

“Chu Huaihao is hiding in the Bearded Dragon World,” Ao Guang revealed. “He entered the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire as a protector of the empire.”

Huang Xiaolong frowned.

He actually chose to submit to the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire in order to receive their protection!

That made things really difficult for Huang Xiaolong. After all, he would be making an enemy of the Bearded Dragon Celestial Empire if he made a move on Chu Huaihao. In the past, he killed countless subordinates of the empire’s second prince, and Xu Long wouldn’t let things slide if he went after a God of Creation level expert on their side.

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, and he looked at the little dragon, “Starly, are your parents back?”

The only people who could suppress Xu Long would be the little dragon’s parents.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

If he could meet with them, he might be able to convince them to assist him! After all, he was the Star Dragon Divine Tree!

“I have no idea.” The little dragon shook his head quickly.

Huang Xiaolong chuckled when he saw the look on the brat’s face. “Do you have a way to contact them?”

A reluctant expression appeared on the little brat’s face when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Knowing what the little kid was afraid of, Huang Xiaolong reassured him, “Relax. I’ll ask them to allow you to follow me around. They won’t force you to return to the Dragon’s Impasse.”

“Really?” The little dragon stared at Huang Xiaolong doubtfully.

“Yes.” Huang Xiaolong made an oath to the little dragon that he would do as he said.

Even though Pangu and the others had no idea what business Huang Xiaolong had with the little dragon’s parents, they couldn’t help but frown when they heard his question. After all, Huang Xiaolong had fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree. No one knew what would happen if they met the little dragon’s parents.

“Xiaolong…” Huang Long was the first to question.

“Don’t worry, it will be alright.” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and reassured everyone. He knew what they were afraid of.

Soon after, the little dragon contacted his parents and quickly received a reply.

“Big brother, they said that they would like to meet you.”

Nodding slightly, Huang Xiaolong accepted their condition. He told the little dragon to set a time with his parents, and he would meet them back in the Dragon’s Impasse.

“What?! You want to bring the little kid back to the Dragon’s Impasse?” Pangu and Huang Long shook their heads resolutely when they heard Huang Xiaolong’s plan. “No way!”

“Relax. I’ll be fine. Nothing will happen to me,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “I’m only going for a little negotiation.”

“Xiaolong, this is too dangerous! This isn’t like last time!” Pangu shook his head. “Even I’m not sure I can escape with my life if his parents came at me together!”

The little dragon slapped his little chest and pouted, “Uncle Pangu, you can rest assured! My parents won’t harm big brother! I like him, and they will too!”

A bitter smile formed on everyone’s face.

Less than half an hour later, everyone agreed with Huang Xiaolong’s idea.

The next day, all of them left the Golden Radiant World. Several days later, they left the river of light.

When Yu Long noticed Huang Xiaolong and the others appearing, a light flashed in his eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, you’re finally out!”

Ignoring Yu Long who had been hiding for a million years, they went towards the Dragon’s Impasse.

This time, Pangu and the others followed Huang Xiaolong all the way to the entrance of the Dragon’s Impasse.

“Alright, father, master, all of you should return. Wait for my news.” Huang Xiaolong winked at them before bringing the little dragon into the Dragon's Impasse.

After pausing for a second, Pangu and the others left.

The moment they did, Yu Long appeared from the void. His expression was dark, and he was clearly contemplating whether he should enter the Dragon’s Impasse to capture Huang Xiaolong or not.
