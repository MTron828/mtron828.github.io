Lin Yanhan’s lips curved up in a cold sneer watching Jia Liang rebuking him in public, “Jia Liang, do you remember your identity? How dare you question my decision? What a joke! Don’t assume that simply because that old monster of a Master of yours is a High Deacon I wouldn’t dare to cripple you. Even if that Master of yours comes here, he still won’t be able to protect you!”

Anger exploded in Jia Liang’s eyes, but he did not speak further.

“Roll to the side for this master!” Li Yanhan’s hand pushed Jia Liang out of his way.

Jia Liang staggered several steps before steadying himself, looking sullen, but then he sighed. He approached Huang Xiaolong with a respectful yet remorseful demeanor, “Senior, I’m sorry, I...”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head saying, “It’s nothing, you retreat first.” Jia Liang’s initial attitude indeed caused Huang Xiaolong to dislike him, but it became slightly better.

Jia Liang understood that even if he had the heart to help Huang Xiaolong, he was powerless. Hence, he silently retreated to the side.

Huang Xiaolong turned to Lin Yanhan, looking at him as if he was looking at a dead person.

When Lin Yanhan saw that Huang Xiaolong still dared to look at him with such a gaze, his prideful attitude instantly turned into fury. Pointing a finger at Huang Xiaolong’s face, he said, “Punk, don’t you have a lot of money? Let me tell you that today, regardless of how rich you are, it’s impossible for you to pass this assessment!” His tone was extremely arrogant.

A sharp light glinted in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, “I really dislike when people point their fingers at me.”

Lin Yanhan laughed loudly, bearing ridicule and arrogance, “So? You want to fight? We’re inside the Alchemist Grandmaster Association, if you dare to attack you’ll die miserably even if you have a hundred lives. Doesn’t matter who it is, no one can save you then!”

The subordinates standing behind Lin Yanhan also broke into raucous laughter.

Lin Yanhan added, “You’re here for the Alchemist Grandmaster Competition, right? Too bad, without a recognized Alchemist identity, I really want to see how you’re going to participate!” As he said this, his head tilted up akin to a rooster greeting the morning sun, “Of course, you can beg me. Get on your knees and beg this Young Master! Hahaha, you can start by calling me Ancestor!”

Another wave of laughter rang from Lin Yanhan’s subordinates. Some of the disciples were gloating at the misfortune befalling on Huang Xiaolong, joining in the laughter.

Just as a sharp killing intent flickered in Huang Xiaolong eyes and he was about to act, a yawn sounded in the hall. Although it wasn’t loud, it seemed to have an inexplicable power, attracting everyone’s attention.

Everyone looked over in the direction of the sound, but they only saw that the beggar old man who had been snoring earlier, smacking his lips while dreaming about wine, had awakened and was stretching lazily. Seeing so many people turn around to look at him, the old man touched his own thin face, muttering under his breath, “Could it be that I have grown more handsome again? Why is everyone staring at me?”

Every person in the hall nearly took a stumble; this old man’s face was really thick!

Ignoring everyone’s weird gazes, the Ascending Moon Old Man stood up, giving his waist a stretch, then he did some chest firming exercises before finally walking over to Lin Yanhan.

Shi Xiaofei followed right behind him.

As he watched the Ascending Moon Old Man approaching, Lin Yanhan was shocked and frightened. But, thinking of the number of subordinates that came with him, Lin Yanhan slightly relaxed. He brought more than enough manpower this time around, five Seventh and Eighth Order God Realm masters. On top of that, he also brought more than a dozen Fifth and Sixth Order God Realm masters.

Lin Yanhan’s gaze was cold and fierce, shouting an order to his subordinates: “Beat this old beggar till he’s crippled, then throw him out! If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility!”

“Yes, Young Master!”

Those behind Lin Yanhan answered in sonorous voices.

Watching his many subordinates making their move toward the old man, a smile bloomed on Lin Yanhan’s face, “Old man, I, Lin Yanhan, am going to teach you what the consequences of offending me inside the Royal Pill City are!”

But, just as the smile on his face spread, he suddenly saw that all of his subordinates stopped moving. They stood frozen in place, not moving an inch, as if they turned into idiots.

Lin Yanhan was stunned, barking at his subordinates, “What are all of you standing silly for?! Quickly cripple this old man for me!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Ascending Moon Old Man raised his left hand, striking out with a palm.

Lin Yanhan was struck by the Ascending Moon Old Man’s palm before he could react. His whole body spun on his legs like a spinning top from the force.

After more than a dozen circles, Lin Yanhan finally stopped. To the surrounding disciples’ horror, Lin Yanhan’s face was swollen to the point of being unrecognizable.

Whereas Lin Yanhan himself felt like the whole world was still spinning. His glaring gaze sharpened, roaring at the Ascending Moon Old Man, “Old man, you’re courting death!!”

But, just as his voice rang, the Ascending Moon Old Man slapped him again, exactly like what he did in the Royal Pill House earlier. The slap landed on the left side of Lin Yanhan’s face, sending him flying out through the hall’s entrance.

The Ascending Moon Old Man’s cold voice sounded, “If it weren’t because this old man is in a good mood today, I would have slaughtered you all with a palm earlier!”

Slaughter!

Shocking killing intent caused the atmosphere inside the hall to plummet. All the disciples present felt a cold shiver run down their spines as they looked at the Ascending Moon Old Man with astonishment. They were astonished that this old man dared to attack inside the Alchemist Grandmaster Association!

What did the Alchemist Grandmaster Association headquarters represent?! Everyone present was fully aware, which was why even super forces or families dared not act recklessly here!

Lin Yanhan struggled to climb up from the ground, pointing a finger that was trembling with anger, roaring at the Ascending Moon Old Man, “You, old man, you’re dead for sure! I want you dead! My father and the rest will arrive very soon, you’re dead!!”

He truly believed that his father and the other Elders would know what happened inside the Alchemist Grandmaster Association building, the association’s masters would surely rush over here!”

Lin Yanhan’s hatred grew thicker as he stared at the Ascending Moon Old Man.

But who knew that right when he had just finished talking, another slap struck over from the void, falling right on his chest. The force knocked Lin Yanhan into the building on the opposite side.

“Is that so? Then I’ll wait for your father and the others to come.” The Ascending Moon Old Man’s expression was chilling, “I really want to see how this old man is going to die!”

The Ascending Moon Old Man was really angered.

The Alchemist Grandmaster Association was quite important to him. He hadn’t been here for more than ten thousand years. Making a rare trip over only to have a junior like Lin Yanhan that committed all kinds of outrageous acts by relying on his elder’s influence, acting so arrogant in front of him, how could he not be angry? How could he not be furious?

Watching everything from the side, Jia Liang was plagued with worry. Stepping cautiously to Huang Xiaolong’s side, he persuaded, “Senior, won’t it be better if all of you leave quickly? When Elder Lin and the others arrive, I’m afraid...”

He already guessed that the beggar old man and this black-haired young man’s identities weren’t simple, but then again, regardless how ‘not simple’ their identities may be, injuring an association Elder’s son inside their headquarters, the consequences were extremely unfavorable!

Huang Xiaolong was calm, shaking his head, “It’s nothing, there’s no need.” Speaking of this, Huang Xiaolong flashed a bright jesting smile saying, “I’m here to get my alchemy skills assessed. When your Elders arrive, they can also oversee my assessment.”

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong had no intention to leave, Jia Liang became anxious, “Senior, it’s better if you all leave quickly, our Chief is a Highgod Realm master!”
