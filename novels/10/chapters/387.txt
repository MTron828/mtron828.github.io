Chapter 388: Poison Corpse Scarabs’ Evolution

Distinct Void Door Elder He retreated in panic.

Poison Corpse Scarabs! It was actually those damnable Poison Corpse Scarabs!

The Poison Corpse Scarabs resurfaced! Ever since the news about Huang Xiaolong killing seven Deities Templar Elders in the Luo Tong Kingdom battle spread, the Poison Corpse Scarabs had turned into an existence that made experts from all corners of the Martial Spirit World pale at the mere mention of their name.

However, when Distinct Void Door Elder He jumped back to avoid the Poison Corpse Scarabs, Huang Xiaolong’s silhouette appeared above him in a flicker, holding a giant saber in his hands that did not escape Elder He’s eye. There was an eye-catching blood red dragon inscribed on the giant blade’s body, vivid and life-like as if one’s soul would be sucked away by looking at it.

“That is?!” Elder He was hit by another ripple of apprehension.

This was the treasure blade that Huang Xiaolong got from the Ancient Dragon Clan ruins, the Great Dragon Saber.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glinted in menacing light staring at the old man below. His hands swung, and the Great Dragon Saber slashed down. Myriad rays of saber energy shot out like a torrent, emitting a lust for blood as they transformed into many tiny blood-red dragons that froze the air.

“Crimson Demon Palm!” That Distinct Void Door Elder He struck both palms skyward.

A thunderous explosion rendered the air.

Elder He’s body shook, but the impact force was too large, his body was sent flying as blood spewed violently from his mouth. By the time he crashed to the ground, nearly every part of his body bore cut wounds from the numerous rays of saber energy. Each cut was like a bone deep furrow, with blood spurting out nonstop, adding to the gruesome sight.

Elder He’s four companions looked over after hearing the his miserable screams, and what they saw appalled them. What horrifying saber qi! Able to pierce through the Crimson Demon Palm as if it was nothing but fragile paper!

Just when Elder He turned his body, trying to get on his feet, a swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs arrived. A pin-prick pain came from his thigh, and a numbing paralysis started to spread to other parts of his body. He was immediately terrified, for he couldn’t gather even a strand of battle qi!

Just like the rumors described the seven Deities Templar Elders’ condition before their death.

“No, don’t, Huang Xiaolong!” Just as he wanted to beg for mercy, he was submerged beneath the swarm of black Poison Corpse Scarabs. After that, only echoes of tragic screams could be heard.

Under the other four peoples’ eyes, the Poison Corpse Scarabs cleaned off that Distinct Void Door Elder at frightening speed. Even while battling Zhao Shu, Zhang Fu, and the two giant puppets, the four from Distinct Void Door and White Phoenix House were unable to conceal the fear in their eyes as they watched one of their companions being reduced to white bones, his tragic screams still echoing in their ears.

Huang Xiaolong returned to the ground, his eyes observing the Poison Corpse Scarabs. He noticed that their outer shell seemed to have grown darker, their elytron reflected an icy cold light, and each scarab seemed sturdier.

“What is this?” Huang Xiaolong was puzzled. ‘Don’t tell me that these Poison Corpse Scarabs are capable of evolving.’ These changes took place after they ate the seven Deities Templar Elders in Luo Tong Kingdom...

Ever since that time, Huang Xiaolong left them inside the Linglong Treasure Pagoda and did not check on them. Only now, after calling them out, did he detect the difference.

‘What can these Poison Corpse Scarabs do after evolving?’ Huang Xiaolong wondered.

By this point, Distinct Void Door Elder He’s soul was torn in many different pieces, swallowed by the swarm of Poison Corpse Scarabs, and Huang Xiaolong gave orders for them to attack one of the White Phoenix House experts.

That White Phoenix House expert was about to get his hands on the child when he caught a glimpse of the Poison Corpse Scarabs coming at him. He instantly paled, and couldn’t be bothered with the child anymore.

“Elder Feng, let us retreat!” He moved away in panic, urging his companion.

“Retreat!” The other expert battling Zhang Fu gritted his teeth and shouted.

Nearly at the same time, the Distinct Void Door old man that was battling Zhao Shu made the same retreat command.

The Distinct Void Door man blocking both giant puppets was secretly relieved to hear that. He leaped back, preparing to escape with the other three.

But Huang Xiaolong sneered coldly as he watched them, appearing in front of that Distinct Void Door man in a flicker, hindering his path. The Great Dragon Saber swung out, sending out a wave of saber energy and violent slaughter qi that distorted space. The Distinct Void Door Elder counter-attacked, but was forced back to the original spot.

Huang Xiaolong’s raised his right palm and struck out, aureate rings expanded through the air, layer upon layer. The space around the White Phoenix House Elder tasked to capture the child stagnated. His movements restricted in mid air.

Just as all his actions were restrained, the pursuing Poison Corpse Scarabs caught up. In the blink of an eye, the Poison Corpse Scarabs covered the man’s entire back. Moments later, all that remained from the White Phoenix House Elder was a white skeleton, plummeting to the ground.

The skeleton shattered into pieces as it hit the ground.

The other Distinct Void Door Elder forced back by Huang Xiaolong with the Great Dragon Saber was drained of all color as he watched the White Phoenix House expert being scraped clean by the Poison Corpse Scarabs.

He looked around, the other White Phoenix House Elder Feng had run far away, the other Distinct Void Door old man too had fled. Discounting the two dead ones, only he remained.

Seconds later, he was surrounded by Poison Corpse Scarabs from all directions. Scared and angry, he bellowed while executing attack after attack with both hands—palms and fists struck out frantically.

“Scram! Don’t come near me!” The fear in his voice was evident.

Those Poison Corpse Scarabs climbed back up again after being slapped away, relentlessly attacking the Distinct Void Door Elder. All of his palm and fist attacks were futile against the Poison Corpse Scarabs, causing the Elder to fall into even more despair, but there was still Huang Xiaolong guarding at the side. Every time he tried to make a run for it, he would be forced back to the same position with one swing from the greatsword in Huang Xiaolong’s hands. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Death inched closer and closer to him. It didn’t take long for him to end up like his two companions before him, a white skeleton. Only then did Huang Xiaolong keet the little black critters away.

Huang Xiaolong noticed that after the last time in Luo Tong Kingdom, not only were the Poison Corpse Scarabs studier, darker, and glossier, their speed and defense increased a significant level too.

This finding boosted Huang Xiaolong’s mood.

Previously, even though their defense was astonishing, some godly weapons could still penetrate through their defense, chopping off their heads, thus killing them! However, if these Poison Corpse Scarabs could evolve without limit, with their speed and defense both enhanced, not even divine grade weapons could harm them. At that time, they would be truly terrifying.

Huang Xiaolong collected the Distinct Void Door and White Phoenix House experts’ spatial rings, as for what was inside, he would check them later.

“Sovereign, two of them ran away.” Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu returned to Huang Xiaolong’s side and said with an apologetic tone.

Huang Xiaolong nodded.

Currently, the Poison Corpse Scarabs’ speed was still a tad too slow, once their speed evolved to the level of a peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm, not a single high-level Saint realm would be able to escape at that time.

Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the small child.

“Big brother, thank you for saving me, you’re amazing!” He came to Huang Xiaolong’s side, eyes shining with worship.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and patted the child’s head, saying, “We’re leaving, what about you?”

“Big brother, I have no place to go, can you let me go with you?” He looked pitifully at Huang Xiaolong, short fingers twisting the edge of Huang Xiaolong’s trousers.

“Follow me?” Huang Xiaolong was surprised. But looking at the child’s obsidian black eyes and the pleading in them, he thought for a moment, nodding: “Fine.”

Although a child traveling with them was slightly inconvenient, the child’s strength wasn’t weak, he was a late-Second Order Saint realm and couldn’t really be considered a burden. Later, after he settled the matters of Asura’s Gate, he would think of a placement for the child.
