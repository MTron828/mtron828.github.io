Chapter 2081: Devil World’s Holy Ground

“Why do you need to go to the Devil World?!” Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in surprise when they heard that he wanted to head over to the Devil World.

“Xiaolong, the most important thing you need to do now is to enter secluded cultivation. You need to increase your strength as quickly as possible!” The King of Grandmist spoke up all of a sudden, “If it isn’t a must for you to go to the Devil World right now, put it off till a later date...”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and explained, “No, it’s extremely important for me to head over to the Devil World right now. I have to go.”

Everyone stared at each other and saw the questionable look in each other’s eyes.

“Just as I was planning to bring you over to the Rotting World to mess with them...” The Reverence Moon Old Man continued, “Your luck is basically heaven defying. If the two of us join hands, we might really be able to obtain a level three origin treasure!”

In the past, the Reverence Moon Old Man had discussed his idea with Huang Xiaolong. His plan was to bring Huang Xiaolong treasure hunting in the Rotting World’s Corpse Pool after Huang Xiaolong entered the Sovereign Realm.

From what he gathered, there was definitely a level three origin treasure in the Corpse Pool.

“This...” Huang Xiaolong felt a little embarrassed as he had completely forgotten about the matter. However, a smile soon appeared on his face. “After I return from the Devil World, we can head over to the Rotting World.” Huang Xiaolong contemplated for a moment before replying to the Reverence Moon Old Man. Even though a level three origin treasure was tempting, it couldn’t compare to the rank four Thirty Six Petaled Green Lotus!

The difference between a level three origin treasure and a level four one wasn’t just a mere grade. It was like comparing a firefly to the moon!

The Reverence Moon Old Man stared at Huang Xiaolong with a look of realization on his face as he asked, “Are you planning on looking for the last devil stele? Did you manage to obtain news about the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele?”

The Concealed Scripture Devil Stele was precisely the final devil stele Huang Xiaolong was missing. After all, everyone had long since learned about how Huang Xiaolong had already gathered the other five devil steles.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. “Even though I cannot be certain of its location, there should be a sixty percent chance of it being hidden in the Devil World.” In the past few years, Huang Xiaolong had ordered his forces to look for the location of the last devil stele. With forces such as the Netherworld King’s Organization and the superpowers from the Radiance World, they had gone all out, looking for the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele. Even though they had failed to locate it, they were somewhat sure that it was hidden somewhere in the Devil World.

The Thirty-Six Petaled Green Lotus was the reason Huang Xiaolong wanted to go to the Devil World, and he wanted to find the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele while he was at it.

Even though the Concealed Scripture Devil Stele wasn’t the top ranked devil stele, Huang Xiaolong would be able to form the Archdevil Lord’s Stele after gathering all six of them. Not only would Huang Xiaolong receive a huge boost to his strength, he would also be able to take control of the origin energy of the Devil World! The position of the world leader of the Devil World would be his without a doubt.

It went without a doubt that locating the last devil stele would be very useful for what Huang Xiaolong wanted to do.

“Since that is the case, we should go with you.” Cang Mutian muttered in a low voice, “I’m pretty familiar with the Devil World anyway.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded. “Alright, I shall head over to the Devil World with Senior Mutian and the little cow.”

Soon after, Huang Xiaolong and the others made up their minds on the arrangement of the Divine World, Demon World, Hell, and some other worlds.

One day later, the three of them left for the Devil World.

Along the way, Huang Xiaolong returned to the Divine World to visit his family members and Shi Xiaofei. After spending a day with them, he left for the Devil World.

Several days later...

Huang Xiaolong’s trio arrived in the Devil World.

When he finally returned to the Devil World, Huang Xiaolong turned a little absent minded as the events from the past flashed through his mind.

When he had fought for the Myriad Curses Devil Stele and the Glaze Devil Stele with the other Archdevil Ancestors, he was merely a weakling. In the blink of an eye, two hundred years had passed.

Two hundred years ago, Huang Xiaolong was hunted down by Shi Ming, Chiyou, Chu Han, and the others. Right now, Chiyou and Chu Han had already died at his hands. He had even killed Shi Ming who used to strike a sense of unprecedented fear in his heart.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived, they didn’t dally as they sped towards the Holy Ground.

The Eternal Devil Lands was located in the northern regions of the Devil World, but the Holy Ground of the Devil World was located in the Saint Devil Region, in the middle of the Devil World.

The Saint Devil Region was the heart of the Devil World, and there were tons of restrictions guarding the place. It was also where most of the superpowers of the Devil World had built their headquarters.

The Heavenly Punishment Archdevil Ancestor’s Heaven Punishment Sect was but one of the powers who had their headquarters in the Saint Devil Region. Even Chiyou, who had died at Huang Xiaolong’s hands, had built the headquarters of his sect in the Saint Devil Region.

Of course, the three Skull Ancestors who had submitted to Huang Xiaolong were part of the superpowers who had built the core of their sect there.

After arriving in the Saint Devil Region, Huang Xiaolong retrieved his Ancient Heavenly Court as he rode on the little cow. They approached with Cang Mutian flying alongside them.

There was a massive city in the middle of the Holy Ground and it was called the Saint Devil City. It was the holy land of the trillions of experts in the Devil World, and it was the second largest city after the Eternal Devil City.

When they arrived, Huang Xiaolong flew towards the Saint Devil City and realized that it was also the location all the experts from the thirty six cities were gathering at.

A trace of suspicion formed in Huang Xiaolong’s heart. Had the news of the Thirty Six Petaled Green Lotus leaked? It should be impossible as the little cow and Cang Mutian were the only ones who knew about their objective.

When they saw how the experts of the superpowers gathered in the Saint Devil City, the little cow and Cang Mutian couldn’t help but feel that something was off.

After asking around, they finally realized that there were rumors going around that a level one origin treasure, the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia, had appeared in the Holy Ground.

As soon as the news had got out, the experts from the various superpowers had started pouring into the Saint Devil City.

“Four Spirits Jade Zoysia...” The little cow laughed, “It seems like our luck is pretty good. We managed to run into the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia right after our arrival here. There should be two of them appearing at once, a male stalk and a female stalk.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. Even though the mid-level one Four Spirits Jade Zoysia was of no use to him, the little cow and Cang Mutian would be able to benefit a little from it.

Very quickly, the three of them blended into the crowd and entered the city.

As soon as they entered, they saw tons of troops from the Heavenless Devil Legion patrolling the place.

“I’ve heard that the Archdevil Ancestors have all gathered here for the birth of the Four Spirits Jade Zoysia. Even experts from the Kingdom of Devil Beasts are here. The Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor and Princess Zhao Rou arrived recently...” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“That’s not all! I’ve heard that seven of the Great Emperors from the empires of the Kingdom of Devil Beasts have made their appearance. The only two missing are the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and the Blue-eyed Lion Great Emperor.”

“There were rumors that the Blue-eyed Lion Emperor met his end at Huang Xiaolong’s hand. As for the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, it seemed like he joined Huang Xiaolong’s camp. I wonder if that’s true.”

The chatter and discussion soon made its way into Huang Xiaolong’s ears.

A tremor ran through Huang Xiaolong’s heart. If Cang Mutian hadn’t reappeared, the strongest expert in the Kingdom of Devil Beasts would be Zhao Yuan, the Two-headed Devil Dragon Great Emperor. Since Cang Mutian’s reappearance, Zhao Yuan had become somewhat suppressed due to Cang Mutian’s prestige.

“I could have never thought that that kid, Zhao Yuan, would come.” Cang Mutian laughed. According to him, the Two-headed Devil Dragon Emperor was merely a junior.

When the three Skull Ancestors heard that Huang Xiaolong had arrived, they quickly rushed out in order to welcome him.

They knew that Huang Xiaolong liked to keep a low profile. Hence, they didn’t prepare a grand welcoming ceremony. The only people who came to receive him were the three of them.

With their invitation, Huang Xiaolong quickly made his way over to the Devil Skull Sect situated in the Saint Devil City.
