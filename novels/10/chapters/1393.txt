Others in the lobby also looked at Huang Xiaolong.

When Longwu Ling Er and Gudu Man were anticipating that Huang Xiaolong was going to hit on them just like everyone else, Huang Xiaolong suddenly made a right turn and said to the rest of his group, “Let’s go.”

Go...?!

Subsequently, everyone watched Huang Xiaolong’s group dumbfoundedly as he turned and walked towards the entrance.

Longwu Clan and Gudu Man’s eyes widened in disbelief. ‘Wasn’t this young master intending to get close to them?’

Others in the lobby finally came to their senses by the time Huang Xiaolong, Xiang Xun, and the rest of the group had reached the entrance.

Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s disciples shouted angrily, “Stop right there!”

These Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s disciples disappeared into a blur and were blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path in the next second.

Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept over these disciples’ faces. They were the same Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s disciples who had claimed that he was being pretentious in order to attract Longwu Ling Er and Gudu Man’s attention, and get close to the two young ladies.

"What is the meaning of this?" Huang Xiaolong asked calmly. "Could it be that you want to rob the top grade chaos sea spirit stones, Giant Shark’s blood essence, and sword wings?"

Meanwhile, the Finest Grade House’s Supervisor Duan Zhen came over with a sullen expression. He was extremely displeased at the glared at the several Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s disciples. "The Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s disciples are becoming more unruly nowadays, and you even have the guts to make trouble in my Finest Grade House! You also dare to block my Finest Grade House’s important guest! Now, roll to the side, or else I don’t mind throwing all of you into my Finest Grade House’s dungeon!"

The several disciples who were blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path ashened. Only then did they remember that they were at the Finest Grade House!

The Finest Grade House was one of the Divine World’s giant trading houses. Forget about them, even their clan’s Ancestors did not dare to let out a fart in the Finest Grade House.

Maybe, an Elder of Solitude Emperor Palace might be able to let out a small fart here.

In the meantime, Longwu Ling Er had approached the entrance and snapped at the several Longwu Clan’s disciples, “Quickly, step away!”

Gudu Yue and Gudu Man also came over and ‘reprimanded’ the Gudu Clan’s disciples who were blocking Huang Xiaolong’s path. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Longwu Ling Er said to Duan Zhen, “Supervisor Duan Zhen, I can assure that they are not blocking this Young Noble’s path out of malicious intent, but they merely want to inquire about something. Supervisor Duan Zhen, please soothe your anger.”

Gudu Yue and Gudu Man also chimed in and backed Longwu Ling Er’s words.

Supervisor Duan Zhen’s sullen expression eased. He prefered not getting on the wrong foot with Longwu Ling Er, Gudu Yue, and Gudu Man. He nodded lightly at them, then turned to ask Huang Xiaolong, “Young Noble, what do you think?”

“It’s alright.” Huang Xiaolong spoke flatly.

Even though it was obvious to everyone else as to why these Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s disciples had stopped Huang Xiaolong, they were still in the Longwu Clan and Gudu Clan’s territories. If it wasn’t absolutely necessary, then Huang Xiaolong preferred to avoid conflict with these two clans here.

A smile bloomed over Duan Zhen’s face when he heard that Huang Xiaolong did not want to make things worse, and took out a golden card. “This is our Finest Grade House branch’s VIP card. Young Noble can look for me on your next visit.”

Although it wasn’t likely that he would visit the High Martial World again, Huang Xiaolong did not refuse Duan Zhen’s goodwill. He received the golden card, and nodded at Duan Zhen. “Sure!”

After that, Huang Xiaolong turned and left.

Longwu Ling Er and Gudu Man watched as Huang Xiaolong stepped out of the Finest Grade House’s entrance, and both opened their mouths as if they had something to say, except they were tongue-tied.

Huang Xiaolong headed to the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall after he came out from the Finest Grade House.

This Myriad Circles Commerce Hall was also one of the Divine World’s giant trading houses.

There were three branches of giant trading houses’ in the High Martial World, all three were located on the same street of Martial Dragon City, and in short distance from each other.

Entering the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall, Huang Xiaolong basically used the same routine and calmly listed all the top grade chaos forging materials he wanted.

The experts and disciples at the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s lobby were equally shocked at Huang Xiaolong’s request.

Similarly, the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s supervisor came out and sold Huang Xiaolong all the top-grade chaos sea spirit stones, top-grade chaos spiritual beasts’ blood essence and wings that Huang Xiaolong requested.

Huang Xiaolong took out almost ten thousand high grade seven spirit stones in front of all the dumbfounded onlookers.

Huang Xiaolong was frowning slightly after he received the spatial ring from the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s supervisor. He had purchased dozens of the forging materials in large quantities, but there was still one item on his list that was unavailable at the Finest Grade House as well as Myriad Circles Commerce Hall!

Not even one!

He was still lacking the top grade chaos space velocity stone.

This top-grade chaos space velocity stones were essential for repairing the Giant Shark Flying Ship, and without these stones, the other purchased materials would be useless.

Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help but inquire about the top-grade chaos space velocity stones to the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s supervisor.

“Young Noble is looking to buy top-grade chaos space velocity stones? It’s simply too hard to find, none of the shops in High Martial World carry them. Not even the Finest Grade House or Flying Paradise Commerce Hall carry it.” The Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s supervisor said to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong’s good mood collapsed instantaneously.

“But, half a year later, the High Martial World would hold a great auction, and the auction items are rarer than usual. Perhaps, the top-grade space velocity stones might get auctioned during that time.” The Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s supervisor added.

A ray of hope shone into Huang Xiaolong’s heart.

If that was so, he could wait for half a year.

“Would the great auction announce the items on auction in advance?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

In general, a large scale auction would announce the items on auction two months in advance. The people would learn what treasures the great auction would auction, and prepare their budget accordingly so that things would progress more successfully.

“Probably three months in advance.” The Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s supervisor estimated.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. ‘If he waited for another three months, he would know if any top-grade chaos space velocity stones would be auctioned at the great auction.’

Huang Xiaolong subsequently bought several sets of top-grade chaos spiritual armors from the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall. Although he had a lot of divine armors inside his spatial ring, none of them was a top-grade chaos spiritual artifact. Not to mention, he could give them to Li Lu or Yao Chi upon returning to Fortune Gate.

Just as Huang Xiaolong, the little cow, and the others were about to leave, they ran into a group of people at the Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s entrance, and it was none other than the Longwu Clan and Gudu Man’s group.

Longwu Ling Er’s group was also surprised running into Huang Xiaolong.

“Supervisor Chen Yuan, I’ve heard that several sets of new top grade chaos spiritual divine armors arrived a few days back?” Longwu Ling Er asked as she took a few steps towards Supervisor Chen Guan. “I would like to take a look, and if they are suitable, I will buy them.”

The Myriad Circles Commerce Hall’s Supervisor Chen Guan looked a little embarrassed at her words. “Miss Longwu, you’re a step late. Those several top grade chaos spiritual divine armors were just bought by this Young Master.” He gestured towards Huang Xiaolong.

Longwu Ling Er and others turned to look at Huang Xiaolong in surprise.
