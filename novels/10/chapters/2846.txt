Chapter 2847: Probe

The elder grew increasingly uneasy at Yu Shaoming’s prolonged silence. A while later, he cautiously asked, “Patriarch, what should we do next? Should we send someone to capture that Young Lord Dragon Emperor, and that so-called Highness?”

Yu Shaoming did not speak, and there was a turmoil of complex emotions in his eyes. Just as the elder’s fear increased, Yu Shaoming finally spoke, “There is no need for that. For the time being, continue to keep an eye on the Long Family’s movements, especially that Young Lord Dragon Emperor. Send people to check if he’s the same Young Lord Dragon Emperor from the past! I am going to see the Old Patriarch now.”

See the Old Patriarch? The elder was genuinely shocked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Patriarch is going to notify the Old Patriarch about this?

At this moment, the elder realized that the Young Lord Dragon Emperor’s identity was not simple. Otherwise, Patriarch wouldn’t have gone to see the Old Patriarch about this matter.

Ever since the Old Patriarch had abdicted, and passed the patriarch position to Yu Shaoming, he had been cultivating inside the Yu Family’s forbidden land, focusing on stepping into Dao Venerable Realm like their old ancestor.

“You can retreat!” Upon seeing the elder dazed on the spot, Yu Shaoming ordered curtly, “Remember, do not take any action on your own and wait for my order!”

If it was really Long Jianfei who had returned, it still wasn’t a big deal, but what he worried about was Long Jianfei’s identity as the inner disciple of Dragon Fish Creed and senior deacon of Mission Hall.

The elder did not dare to have any other thoughts and quickly withdrew from the hall. After the elder left, Yu Shaoming went to the Yu Family’s forbidden land and met with his father, Yu Qi.

“What? Long Jianfei?” Yu Qi was genuinely shocked and asked, “Isn’t Long Jianfei dead?”

He couldn’t believe that Long Jianfei was actually still alive.

Yu Shaoming’s brows were tightly locked together, “When Long Jianfei had gone missing, a Dragon Fish Creed’s expert had tried to locate him through a secret method. I remember clearly that he had said that Long Jianfei’s aura had completely disappeared from the Divine Tuo Holy World. It was because of that the Dragon Fish Creed announced Long Jianfei’s demise and revoked his inner disciple and senior deacon’s identities. Who’d have thought that Long Jianfei would return after so many years. Although we haven’t confirmed it is Long Jianfei, nine out of ten it’s him!”

It was because the Long Family had only one Young Lord Dragon Emperor.

Long Chenfeng would only call Long Jianfei as the Young Lord Dragon Emperor.

Yu Qi’s eyes narrowed. “Even if Long Jianfei has returned, there is no need to panic. Nothing will happen. His master, Chen Xi, has been missing for a long time, and even if Chen Xi didn’t die inside the Bright Lightning Abyss, he’s probably trapped inside the unfathomable restrictions within the Bright Lightning Abyss, and he might never come out!”

“Don’t forget, we still have Zhou’er!”

Yu Zhou!

He was the Yu Family’s most talented genius of this era!

At the mention of Yu Zhou, Yu Qi couldn’t help showing a happy and proud expression.

Yu Zhou was one of his grandsons and also Yu Shaoming’s nephew.

Upon hearing Yu Qi speak of Yu Zhou, Yu Shaoming also smiled, and his worries were pacified.

“Father, now that Long Jianfei is back, he’s definitely going to ratify his Dragon Fish Creed inner disciple identity. Before he does that, do you think we should…?” Yu Shaoming made a cut-throat gesture.

“As long as we block the news, and kill everyone that knows of Long Jianfei’s return, the Dragon Fish Creed definitely won’t hear a word about it. We’ll make Long Jianfei really disappear without a soul knowing about his return!” Yu Shaoming said with a cruel glint in his eyes.

Yu Qi spoke solemnly after considering Yu Shaomig’s words, “You said that there are two more people who came back with Long Jianfei? Long Jianfei called one of them His Highness? And he looked extremely respectful?”

“Yes,” Yu Shaoming nodded.

This was the main reason he did not take immediate action.

“The young man Long Jianfei called ‘Highness’, who is he exactly? He must at least be a young lord of another powerful creed given that Long Jainfei is willing to call him ‘Highness’ respectfully, based on his knowledge as a Dragon Fish Creed’s inner disciple.”

“Send ten Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors there!” Yu Qi went on solemnly, “Tell them to probe Long Jianfei and that Highness’ current strength.”

Yu Qi’s order was to probe.

“Yes, father.” Yu Shaoming understood and nodded his head.

……

Night…

The Long Family’s main residence…

Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng stood in the air above the Long Family’s residence. Under the silvery moonlight, their shadows on the ground were elongated.

The wind felt cold to the skin.

“Your Highness, I didn’t expect my master to have also…” Long Jianfei started with a bitter expression on his face.

Originally, his plan was to ask his master for help after regaining his inner disciple identity to bring Huang Xiaolong into the Dragon Fish Creed, but now, with his master missing for many years, this plan wouldn’t work anymore.

“It’s alright,” Huang Xiaolong shook his head and added, “You go ratify your identity first thing tomorrow morning. We’ll talk about entering the Dragon Fish Creed later.”

Long Jianfei nodded.

Early the next morning, as the morning sun was shining radiantly, Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng left the Long Family’s residence.

Long Jianfei was going to the Dragon Fish Creed’s branch to report and register, whereas Huang Xiaolong and Duan Feng were idle, thus they went with Long Jianfei. The Dragon Fish Creed had a branch at the Blue Rainbow Sacred Land not far away from their current location.

It merely took them half a month to travel from the Monarch Yu Sacred Land to the Blue Rainbow Sacred Land with the Immemorial Ice and Fire Qilins’ speed.

However, Huang Xiaolong’s group of three was blocked just as they left the Dragon Emperor Continent. The ones blocking their path was the group Primal Ancestor experts sent by Yu Shaoming, and there were all ten of them. Their strengths were between early Ninth Resurrection to peak early Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm.

For a sacred land’s top forces like the Yu Family, they would have a certain number of Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors.

“Long Jianfei! It’s really you!” Amongst the ten people, the group leader stared at Long Jianfei in shock.

“Yu Chengming.” Long Jianfei’s eyes lit up as this was a familiar face from the past. Yu Chengming was one of Yu Xin’s cousins, and he had met Long Jianfei many times in the past.

Yu Chengming gave Long Jianfei a look from head to toe and exclaimed in shock, “Mid-Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor?”

He hadn’t expected Long Jianfei’s cultivation to have only reached the mid-Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm after so long. After all, his strength had always been lower than Long Jianfei in the past, and his talent couldn’t be compared to Long Jianfei. But now, he, Yu Chengming, had already entered the peak early Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm.

Although Long Jianfei had better talent, the Cangqiong Holy World that he had fallen in had thin spiritual energy, and it was far from comparable to the Divine Tuo Holy World’s spiritual energy. Greatly restricted by the environment, Long Jianfei’s cultivation progress was greatly affected. Hence, Yu Shaoming’s strength had surpassed Long Jianfei.

Yu Chengming checked Long Jianfei’s cultivation again with a secret method, and confirmed that Long Jianfei was truly only a mid-Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor. Then, he scanned over Huang Xiaolong and Duan Feng. Seeing that Huang Xiaolong and Duan Feng were both weaker than him, he was completely at ease. Defeating Duan Feng, who was merely a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor, was as easy as snapping his fingers.

Having seen through Long Jianfei, Huang Xiaolong, and Duan Feng’s strength, Yu Chengming laughed, “Long Jianfei, after so many years, your cultivation has only reached the Fifth Resurrection Primal Ancestor?! Looks like you’re not so great after all. The Long Family’s genius of an era is actually worse than me.”

“Also, are you that ‘Highness’ Long Jianfei respects so much?” Yu Chengming stared at Huang Xiaolong with a face full of mockery. “A peak mid-Fourth Resurrection Primal Ancestor ‘Highness’?”
