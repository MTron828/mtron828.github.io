Unlike everyone else around him, Huang Xiaolong seemed no different after Wang Biaoyuan’s display of power and might. A minuscule difference that went undetected was the iciness that glazed over his pupils when Wang Biaoyuan told him to kneel and beg for mercy.

Kneel down and beg? Huang Xiaolong sneered: “One move.”

One move?

All the gathered disciples were baffled by this sentence that came out from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, but when it finally dawned on them the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words, the whole arena looked as if it was about to split into half from the crowd’s reaction.

“One move? Is this Huang Xiaolong saying that he only needs one move to defeat Wang Biaoyuan?!”

“Damn, isn’t he acting too brazen?! Did he damage his brain knocking against a door somewhere? Is he blind as well? Didn’t he see Wang Biaoyuan’s late-Second Order God Realm strength right in front of him? He still thinks he can win over Wang Biaoyuan?! It’s already the greatest miracle if he can defeat Wang Biaoyuan, forget doing it in one move!”

“That’s right, if he really can defeat Wang Biaoyuan in one move, I’ll kill myself by slamming my head against this Hidden Dragon Arena.”

When Huang Xiaolong said that Wang Biaoyuan wasn’t his opponent in the beginning, and instead ‘suggested’ both Wang Biaoyuan and Gudu Leng to join hands, the crowd was already indignant with Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance. Huang Xiaolong didn’t seem that pleasing to the eyes anymore.

And now, Huang Xiaolong’s exaggerated claim of defeating Wang Biaoyuan in one move had completely drawn the crowd’s anger. This caused them to be in an extremely bad mood.

Some were enraged to the point of forgetting Huang Xiaolong’s identity, shooting a ferocious glare at Huang Xiaolong. Even those who had supported Huang Xiaolong in the beginning felt that Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance had gone over the limit.

Zhang Tianchuan didn’t even hide his disappointment, shaking his head on the platform. Indeed, this Huang Xiaolong was an outstanding peerless genius, a talent worthy to be nurtured by their Black Warrior Institute, but this little guy’s temperament needed a little bit more grinding.

Gudu Leng snorted in obvious contempt at Huang Xiaolong’s words. Similar to everyone present, he too felt that Huang Xiaolong’s pride had gone to his head. Did he think that defeating both Xie Ning and Luo Kao, allowed him to swagger without fetters? Did he take Wang Biaoyuan for the likes of Xie Ning or Luo Kai?

Wang Biaoyuan was a true blue late-Second Order God Realm!

After breaking into Second Order God Realm, he understood more than the other disciples here what a late-Second Order God Realm meant. Even him, who successfully practiced the Gudu Family’s Solitary God’s Infinitude until the hundredth layer, possessing the reborn power, wasn’t confident in being able to defeat Wang Biaoyuan. As for completing that feat in one move, that was ludicrous, a joke, the words of a fool!

After blanking out for a second, Wang Biaoyuan pointed a finger at Huang Xiaolong and broke out in wanton laughter. The laughter hid his indescribable fury. He wasn’t this freaking mad even when Huang Xiaolong defeated him in public three years ago.

“Good, good!” Wang Biaoyuan’s eyes were crimson like blood, “Huang Xiaolong, if you can really defeat me in one move, I shall kneel and beg for mercy before you!” Not waiting a moment longer, Wang Biaoyuan’s figure flew out, his fist aimed at Huang Xiaolong.

In the air, his figure flickered in an unpredictable manner, leaving more than a dozen afterimages in different locations, sometimes appearing, sometimes swerving away. From outside the stage, Wang Biaoyuan looked like an illusory butterfly that contained a horrifying murderous intent. An invisible energy rushed toward Huang Xiaolong.

“That is the Flower Butterfly Fantasy Maneuver movement technique!”

“Flower Butterfly Fantasy Maneuver movement technique?! If I’m right, this skill was created by Venerable Fantasy a hundred thousand years ago and has disappeared for more than ten thousand years. It is said that this Flower Butterfly Fantasy Maneuver movement technique is unpredictable, one can hardly defend against it. Could Wang Biaoyuan have found Venerable Fantasy’s immortal cave?!”

Those who heard this exclaimed in shock.

Just as the crowd exclaimed, the power in Wang Biaoyuan’s fists exploded, striking at Huang Xiaolong.

“Immovable Wisdom King’s Godking Fist!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Fists whistled through the air, each shrouded in a scary ball of flames that rippled in space. At this point, Wang Biaoyuan’s fists were no longer simple fists, more like catastrophic meteors falling from the sky, carrying a tail of scorching flames and a terrifying power of destruction, exuding an aura that would kill God if a God blocks, kill Buddha if Buddha blocks. Wang Biaoyuan’s only aim was to blast Huang Xiaolong into a million pieces in one attack!

Zhang Tianchuan’s frown deepened as he watched from the platform. Should he intervene? If this strike hit, although Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t die, he’d suffer grave injuries. How was he supposed to explain to the Institute Principal then? Moreover, great harm was not allowed to fall on Huang Xiaolong.

However, the rules prohibited anyone from interfering. As the overseer of this round’s assessment, if he was the one who broke the rules, then...?

While Zhang Tianchuan was caught in a dilemma, Wang Biaoyuan’s fists were only meters away from Huang Xiaolong. As he got nearer to Huang Xiaolong, a brutal light flickered in Wang Biaoyuan’s eyes, ‘Huang Xiaolong, go DIE—!’

Watching as Wang Biaoyuan’s fists were about to strike Huang Xiaolong, suddenly a vast, overwhelming energy surged out vigorously from Huang Xiaolong’s body. Before this wave of energy, the sky trembled as if it was about to collapse, the earth sinking in.

Everyone’s breaths were stuck in their chests, as if a great mountain was pressing down on them. Their souls trembled, an inexplicable intention to prostrate emerged in their minds. Confusion, bewilderment, apprehension, all mixed into one.

Wang Biaoyuan’s face tightened.

Gudu Leng’s face tightened.

So did Zhang Tianchuan’s expression.

A layer of black scale armor covered Huang Xiaolong’s body, two horns protruded from his forehead, the Wings of Demon spread majestically behind him as groups of blackish-red energy covered the entire Hidden Dragon Arena stage.

At this moment, Huang Xiaolong moved. The Wings of Demon flapped, revealing the profound golden hellish symbols on their surface.

Wang Biaoyuan barely caught sight of a blurry black shadow when two black fists grew bigger in his pupils. His eyes widened in alarm, then, rumble! A sharp ear-splitting blast resounded, as if heaven and earth split into two. His Immovable Wisdom King’s Godking Fist collided with the two black fists.

The high frequency stabbed at Wang Biaoyuan’s eardrums, and before he could react, an overwhelming, tyrannical power crashed against him like a giant tidal wave. At this moment, he had a feeling that he was nothing more than a pebble that fell into the vast sea.

That tyrannical power struck straight at his chest. His body quivered badly, tumbling backwards. One moment he was bouncing off clouds, and in the next moment, his body slammed heavily on the ground. Wang Biaoyuan lost his consciousness at that point, sinking into oblivion.

Huang Xiaolong landed gently back on the Hidden Dragon Arena, yet the stage groaned in protest. With Huang Xiaolong’s feet as the center, cracks spread out in all directions.

Although the Hidden Dragon Arena stage was built from extremely hard rock kernel, it had a limit of endurance, it couldn’t withstand the power of a Third Order God Realm. Because, in regular outer disciples assessment, the strongest would only possess the strength of a First Order God Realm, hence, from the Black Warrior Institute management’s perspective, no outer disciple could break the Hidden Dragon Arena that could withstand close to a Third Order God Realm master’s strength.

But now!

Dumbfounded!

Watching these events taking place, their dumbfounded brains were empty of anything else.

Wang Biaoyuan laid sprawled below the arena, his clothes torn to rags that were drenched with his blood. His Indestructible Vajra Physique had lost its use, his indestructible iron fists that everyone idolized were mangled to an unrecognizable degree. Even his bones seemed broken.

Huang Xiaolong stood on the stage, akin to an ancient overlord, exuding an irrefutable dragon might and the chilling cold air of a death god.

“God-God, Second Order God Realm!” Gudu Leng stammered incoherently, his tongue twisted into a knot and his face was ash-gray.

This time, Huang Xiaolong no longer hid his aura.

Second Order God Realm!

Everyone froze: they couldn’t believe, unable to believe, and dared not believe.

On the platform, Zhang Tianchuan was trembling all over, one he knew if it was because of excitement or shock.

One move, it was indeed one move!

Still, only one move!
