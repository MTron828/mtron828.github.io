Listening to Supervisor Lin’s ‘generous act’ of discounting six thousand three hundred gold coins, a faint smile emerged on Huang Xiaolong’s lips, “How could I accept that?”

Supervisor Lin chuckled sheepishly, “It’s something I should do.”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “Good, help me pack all these pill refinement ingredients into my spatial ring.” He removed an empty spatial and gave it to Supervisor Lin as he said that.

This spatial ring was taken off Yao Fei when Huang Xiaolong killed him. Supervisor Lin received the spatial ring from Huang Xiaolong and opened it. The instant the ring opened, his eyes widened.

This spatial ring, just the space inside was close to three to four hundred cubic meters, if he was to imagine the volume, how big was that? Once, he saw one their Aowu Shop Elders spatial rings, but the space inside was barely half the size of Huang Xiaolong’s.

Getting over his shock, a trace of regret wound around Supervisor Lin’s heart, if he had known earlier, he would have signaled his subordinate to hike the price up a little more. Such a super big fat sheep, if he didn’t make it bleed a little bit more, who knows when the next super fat sheep would visit their shop.

However, it was too late for regrets and Supervisor Lin recovered fairly quickly. He handed the spatial ring to Iron-Skinned Dog, who was standing at the side, so that he could transfer all the pill refinement ingredients that Huang Xiaolong bought into the ring.

Of course, if he knew that Huang Xiaolong obtained this spatial ring after killing a Deities Templar Elder, he would probably be terrified enough to throw the spatial ring back to Huang Xiaolong, lacking the courage to even hold the ring. His thoughts of bleeding a super fat sheep a little more would definitely vanish.

Moments later, Iron-Skinned Dog had placed all of the ingredients into the spatial ring, handing the ring back respectfully to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong took the spatial ring and kept it away into the Asura Ring.

Huang Xiaolong stood up. Suddenly, he hit his forehead, saying, “I forgot to bring it when I came here. I only have that one hundred thousand gold coins deposit that I gave you earlier.” At this point, Huang Xiaolong showed a remorseful expression looking at Supervisor Lin, “This, Supervisor Lin, this is really awkward. How about this, let me go back first, I will send my people here with the balance later.”

Supervisor Lin was thunderstruck, then a frown wrinkled his forehead, “Little Brother, this way isn’t right.” Pausing momentarily, he shifted his gaze to Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu. “What about your two subordinates if they brought money with them?”

Once Huang Xiaolong was allowed to go back, no ghosts would believe that he would send people back with money. Even if Supervisor Lin was a pig, this point was obvious to him.

Huang Xiaolong looked over at Zhao Shu and Zhang Fu, “Do you have money on you?”

Zhao Shu shook his head, saying, “Sovereign, your subordinate doesn’t carry much money with me, only a few hundred gold coins.”

Zhang Fu also shook his head, emulating Zhao Shu word by word.

Huang Xiaolong said, “Take out those few hundred gold coins you have, give it to Supervisor Lin first.” He then turned to Supervisor Lin, “Supervisor Lin, I’m really sorry, my two subordinates only have so much on them. Why don’t you take them as deposit? Later, I will send people with the money.” Finished saying that, Huang Xiaolong prepared to leave with Zhao Shu and the rest.

Supervisor Lin’s body flickered, blocking their path. Looking at the few hundred gold coins in front of him, anger rose from his heart; a few hundred gold coins, were they trying to send a beggar away?

The usual smile hanging on his face disappeared, his face sank, gloomy and cold, “Since there’s no way, kindly leave all the ingredients here. Whenever you bring the money, you can take them away.”

By this point, the guards around the Aowu Shop already noticed something wasn’t right, closing around the hall in a circle, blocking the exit.

Watching calmly, Huang Xiaolong replied, “Pill refinement Ingredients? What ingredients?”

A cold glint flashed in Supervisor Lin’s eyes at those words, sneering at Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, why do I feel like you deliberately come to our Aowu Shop looking for trouble?” At this stage, even a fool could see that Huang Xiaolong had no intention of paying from the beginning.

A faint smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face, shrugging nonchalantly, “If you want to think that way, it’s also correct.”

A devious chuckle came from Supervisor Lin’s mouth, “Our Aowu Shop has been in business for more than a hundred years, there has never been anyone blind enough that dared to come here looking for trouble. I’m giving you one last chance, take out all the pill refinement ingredients and leave all the things on your body as well as your spatial ring, then you can scram from here obediently after that.”

Huang Xiaolong was very calm, “If not?”

Iron-Skinned Dog interjected, “Kid, why don’t you ask around who our Aowu Shop’s boss is. Let me tell you, our boss is South Oblast City Castellan Manor’s Chief Steward, Mister Luo Yun!”

‘So it’s like that! The big boss behind this Aowu Shop is the Castellan Manor’s Chief Steward!’ Huang Xiaolong sneered. For a city of this magnitude, like South Oblast, a Chief Steward in the Castellan Manor was indeed a backing with high status, identity, and power. From a certain point angle, this person’s power was only below the Castellan.

Iron-Skinned Dog added, “When we started business, there were several blind people came in trying to make trouble, do you know how they ended up? Their dog legs were broken by us, the tendons after their hands and feet cut off, and their Qi Sea wasted. If it weren’t for Lord Duke pleading for them, they would’ve died long ago!”

A flurry of footsteps thundered in the hall as shadows moved around the shop. The Aowu Shop guards had the shop fully encircled, not even a fly could get out. There were about sixty of them.

Seeing this, Supervisor Lin’s confidence increased. He could see that Huang Xiaolong should be someone with high status, but then again, so what, this was the South Oblast City, those that had the guts to come in and make trouble in the Aowu Shop deserved death!

Huang Xiaolong took a quick glance around, these Aowu Shop guards around the hall were all Xiantian realm experts, but most of them were low-level and mid-level Xiantian. As for high-level, there were only three people.

In this situation, Lil’ Tian’s obsidian black eyes twinkled as he looked left and right, inquiring from Huang Xiaolong, “Big brother, what are they doing?”

Huang Xiaolong laughed, “They want to fight us.”

Hearing that, Lil’ Tian clapped his hands shouting, “Great, great, ah! I love fighting the most.” A delighted Lil’ Tian didn’t wait for another word from Huang Xiaolong, his little hands waved and a fist flew out, aiming at Supervisor Lin.

Supervisor Lin’s anger erupted seeing a small child actually dared to attack him, “Little wild bastard, you’re courting death!” With battle qi surging from his body, Supervisor Lin punched out.

Being able to take up the position of Aowu Shop’s Supervisor, Supervisor Lin was no weak chicken, he was a late-Xiantian Eighth Order.

Just when Iron-Skinned Dog and the guards thought that the insolent little punk was going to die, blasted to bloody pieces, a ‘kacha’ sound of breaking bone sounded in their ears. Supervisor Lin’s tragic screams rendered the hall. Then, Lil’ Tian’s small hands struck again, landing a punch on his chest.

Before the shocked faces of these Aowu Shop members, their Supervisor Lin was thrown out, crashing into one of the giant stone pillars in the hall. The whole hall shook as the stone pillar cracked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Supervisor Lin’s body slid down against the stone pillar, his entire chest caved in, coming out the other end. His heart had stopped beating, yet his eyes were wide with shock and disbelief.

The spacious hall instantly became deadly silent. Still, the rapid beating hearts of the Aowu Shop members were very loud.

The silence was broken by Lil’ Tian’s voice, “Ei, aren’t we fighting? Why, why so fragile to beating?” In the next moment, he turned to Iron-Skinned Dog, “Your turn now.”
