When they woke up from the shock caused by the impact of Cheng Guotao landing beside them, they saw how their leader spat out mouthfuls after mouthfuls of blood.

The blood stained their bodies red. The red color was so piercing that it hurt their eyes.

Hysterical cries sounded as they scampered away from Cheng Guotao’s body. They felt as though his blood was scarier than the god of death himself.

Huang Xiaolong stared at the disciples with a cold look in his eyes.

It was at that time where Huang Peng and Guo Xiaofan regained their consciousness.

“Xiaolong!” “Uncle!”

The two of them experienced unimaginable joy when they saw Huang Xiaolong.

Especially Guo Xiaofan. He leaped to his feet and cheered, “I knew that Uncle would come and save us all!” He hugged Huang Xiaolong and danced about, like a little kid who had managed to obtain a fun toy.

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao stared at Huang Xiaolong with a smile on their faces.

Huang Xiaolong forced a bitter smile on his face as he spoke to Guo Xiaofan, “Alright, little brat, your uncle isn’t a beauty. Why are you hugging me?! Hurry up and let go!”

Guo Xiaofan finally released Huang Xiaolong as he turned around to stare at the Heavenly God Realm disciples from the Earth Shattering Gang, who were trying to hide.

When he stared at the disciple who had whipped him, all the rage and hatred in his heart rushed to his head. He rushed up and stomped on the disciple’s chest, shattering all his ribs. As a miserable shriek left the mouth of the disciple, he tossed and turned about as he rolled on the ground.

“F*ck! Didn’t you say that you’ll eat the entire mountain if my uncle comes to save us? Get over there and start eating!” Guo Xiaofan’s eyes were bloodshot as he kicked and stomped on the disciple who had whipped them in the past. Despite the anger boiling in his heart, he controlled his strength such that he wouldn’t kill the other party by accident.

The Earth Shattering Gang’s disciple didn’t dare to resist. He cupped his fist and begged for mercy. “Mercy, Lord, please show mercy!”

“Lord?!” Guo Xiaofan’s anger rose to his head, and he chuckled in a cold voice. “F*ck! Wasn’t I a dog? Didn’t you call me your dog-slave?! Why don’t you try saying that again?! Huh?! Say it!”

After beating up the disciple to an inch of death, Guo Xiaofan looked at the metal whip lying on the ground beside them. Reaching out, he grabbed the whip before lashing out at the disciple. When the other disciples saw what happened to their friend, they felt their hearts twitching.

When the disciple he whipped finally stopped rolling, Guo Xiaofan sent another lash flying towards him. “Sure. I’ll spare you. As long as you finish eating the mountain in front of us, I’ll spare your life.”

The disciple rolled around on the ground as he screamed in pain. The metal whip cut deep into his skin, and he struggled to raise his head to look at the towering mountain in front of him. His face turned pale in an instant. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The metal mine was something even Ancient Gods wouldn’t be able to digest if they ingested it, not to mention a Second Order Heavenly God like him. There was no need to mention eating the mountain. Even eating several ores would kill him.

“Hurry up and eat!” Guo Xiaofan whipped him again.

Several lashes landed on his body. Before long, the disciple was covered in wounds. His flesh was torn open, and his bones were revealed.

If not for Huang Xiaolong’s timely arrival, Guo Xiaofan and Huang Peng would be nothing more than two corpses right now. There was no way Guo Xiaofan would allow the disciple to get off scot-free.

The miserable cries of the disciple slowly died down, and it finally stopped. He laid sprawled out on the ground as he was beaten to death. The scene looked familiar, as he had beaten the slaves in the mine to death before. He suffered the same fate as his victims.

The other disciples stared at Guo Xiaofan with a horrified expression as they begged Huang Xiaolong and Guo Xiaofan relentlessly.

Guo Xiaofan heard their pleas, but he walked over to them and started whipping all of them.

With his experience in the Lower Worlds, Guo Xiaofan was no longer the naive and kindhearted young kid he once was. When they had begged for mercy when the disciples of the Earth Shattering Gang had whipped them, no one had bothered to care about them.

In the end, every single disciple who was in charge of guarding the mines were whipped to death.

There was one who tried to resist. He grabbed Guo Xiaofan in an attempt to kill them both. He was blasted to nothingness by Huang Xiaolong’s Emperor’s will.

After an hour...

All the experts who had accompanied Hu Qingzhong and Cheng Guotao had turned into ice sculptures. After Huang Xiaolong crippled Cheng Guotao, he suffered the same fate as the disciples as Guo Xiaofan beat him to death.

Looking at Cheng Guotao’s miserable end, Guo Xiaofan finally felt the anger and hatred in his heart dissipate.

Cheng Guotao’s corpse lay on the ground as his eyes were wide open with disbelief, even in death. Never in his wildest dreams would he have thought that he would be whipped to death by a bunch of slaves.

When Guo Xiaofan was done, Su Yan, Huang Min, and the others finally woke up.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the thousands of slaves kneeling on the ground, and he didn’t feel like making things difficult for them. He gave them their freedom after providing them with a recovery pill each. No matter what, they could be considered his parent’s ‘colleagues.’

When the rest of the slaves left, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the others finally turned to look at the group of people standing behind Huang Xiaolong.

“Xiaolong, these ladies are...” Su Yan asked.

Guo Xiaofan chuckled in amusement. “There’s no need to ask! They are definitely uncle’s wives!”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao had their reservations, and Peng Xiao’s face flushed red. Even though Fang Xuanxuan was the young lady of the Fortune Emperor Palace, she couldn’t control her emotions as a look of pleasant surprise appeared on her face. They lowered their heads and stared at their feet, not daring to meet the gazes of the Huang Family members.

Huang Xiaolong glared at Guo Xiaofan from the corner of his eye before introducing the two of them to the others.

After they were done, Huang Xiaolong brought them to the Earth Shattering Gang’s headquarters and the Gu An Sect. They leveled both factions.

From that moment on, the Earth Shattering Gang and the Gu An Sect would cease to exist.

Of course, after destroying the Gu An Sect, Huang Xiaolong brought them to the treasure vault. When they saw the countless treasures and spiritual herbs lying around, Huang Min and the others grabbed everything they could. Not a single pill was left behind.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t lack spiritual pills or spirit stones. When he saw the excited looks on the faces of Guo Xiaofan and the rest, Huang Xiaolong didn’t feel like pouring a bucket of cold water over their heads. As long as they were happy, nothing else mattered.

The Earth Shattering Gang was a second rate faction, and no one cared about them even if they were annihilated. However, the Gu An Sect was different. They were a first-rate sect, and they were one of the strongest powers on the Fire Stone World. Their destruction shook the world surface.

“I’ve heard the Gu An Sect managed to obtain some heaven-defying treasure. They attracted a bunch of Emperors and were annihilated! Even their treasury was plundered!”

“You’re wrong. The Gu An Sect and the Earth Shattering Gang kidnapped Huang Xiaolong’s parents and forced them to mine for them! Huang Xiaolong exterminated both their factions.”

“Huang Xiaolong?! There is someone bold enough to enslave Huang Xiaolong’s parents?! How is that possible...? The Gu An Sect and the Earth Shattering Gang probably stepped into dog shit! Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t take his anger out on everyone on the Fire Stone World, right?... When someone angered the young master of the Brilliance Emperor Palace, he sent the Brilliance Emperor Palace to wipe out every last being on their world!”

Every single expert on the Fire Stone World started to tremble. They didn’t dare to believe what had happened. However, when they were still in a state of panic, Huang Xiaolong left the Fire Stone World.

On the way, Huang Xiaolong learned from his family how Shi Xiaofei was separated from their group due to a freak accident.

Knowing that Shi Xiaofei was blown away by a hurricane, Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief. It was a blessing that she didn’t ascend to the Buddhist World...

“Oh? The Silver Fox Commerce managed to locate Shi Xiaofei!” When Huang Xiaolong learned of Shi Xiaofei’s accident, he received Bei Xiaomei’s report.
