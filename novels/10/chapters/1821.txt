Raging fury burned in Liu Yuan, Zhao Wendan, and the other Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors’ chest as they watched Feng Chan die, devoured by Huang Xiaolong.

"Huang Xiaolong, I’m going to kill you!" Liu Yuan hollered in angst, and his eyes were scarlet with bloodthirst.

Liu Yuan had watched Feng Chan grow up from childhood. Moreover, he was the one who had guided Feng Chan’s cultivation along the way, and he could be considered as half a Master to Feng Chan.

Even though they were half-a-Master and half-a-disciple, their Master-disciple relationship was better than any full-fledged one.

Embroiled in his fury and angst, Liu Yuan once again rushed up to attack Huang Xiaolong, more desperately than ever.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong flickered to the side, letting a fourteen-winged Radiance Angel parry Liu Yuan’s attacks.

Then, the City of Eternity came slamming down.

Liu Yuan was smashed deep into the ground, then flew up and smashed down again. A large land surface sunk in, burying Liu Yuan deep in the earth.

Liu Yuan was deader than dead.

“Liu Yuan!” Zhao Wendan screamed hoarsely.

But the remaining Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors scattered and fled upon seeing this, except for Zhao Wendan. Like Liu Yuan, his desperate attacks on Huang Xiaolong renewed to the point of damaging his own blood qi.

The City of Eternity on the ground flew up again and hit Zhao Wendan.

Zhao Wendan was heavily knocked backward, crashing into some far-away palace ruins, and went quiet forever.

As for those Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestors who fled away, Huang Xiaolong sent the other fourteen-winged Radiance Angels and City of Eternity after them with the order of killing as many as they could.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong and the other fourteen-winged Radiance Angel continued flying further into the palace building in the center of Fiend God Emperor Palace and descended on one of the palaces.

According to the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s Ancestor, whom Huang Xiaolong had captured earlier, Fang Gan was imprisoned under this palace.

Huang Xiaolong ordered the fourteen-winged Radiance Angel to open up a path. The Radiance Angel stepped forward with a palm slashing across the palace building like a blade, cutting it off horizontally and revealing a dark hole going deep into the ground.

Huang Xiaolong opened his Eye of Hell to survey the situation. After confirming no immediate danger, he leaped into the dark hole, followed by the fourteen-winged Radiance Angel.

The moment they entered a dark space-hole, they entered another space.

This was a wide space, with a huge mountain range of many peaks and cliffs running across the land. Each of these mountain peaks was a cage one after another.

Most of these cages were empty, and merely a few of them were ‘inhabited.’

One cage imprisoned one person.

Those inside these cages were all-powerful existences. The pressure coming from them was palpitating, and the majority of these people were high-level Emperor Realm experts. Only a small number of them were low-level and mid-level Emperor Realm, and none of them were at the Heavenly Monarch Realm and below.

Those qualified to be imprisoned here by the Fiend God Emperor Palace were naturally people of high status, mostly Ancestors from other Emperor Palaces and large families. Thus it was impossible for a Heavenly Monarch Realm cultivator to appear here.

The captives inside these cages stood up upon discovering Huang Xiaolong’s presence.

It was evident to them that Huang Xiaolong was not a disciple of Fiend God Emperor Palace.

“Fourteen-winged Radiance Angel!”

“It’s actually a fourteen-winged Radiance Angel!”

These experts exclaimed in astonishment seeing the fourteen-winged Radiance Angel behind Huang Xiaolong.

On top of that, even more, bewildering to them was the fact that the fourteen-winged Radiance Angel was following behind a Heavenly Monarch Realm kid like a subordinate.

These people exchanged baffled glances with their neighbors, unable to figure out what was going on.

Also, where were the Fiend God Emperor Palace’s people?

This place was laden with layers and layers of formations and restrictions, and it was heavily guarded in every possible way. How did this kid and that fourteen-winged Radiance Angel make it inside here?

Huang Xiaolong ignored these people as his divine sense spread out to detect Fang Gan’s presence.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes lit up moments later when he found Fang Gan, and he hastened towards one of the mountain ranges in front of him. A few minutes later, Huang Xiaolong stopped in front of a certain mountain peak.

The cage above this mountain peak was the one imprisoning Fang Gan.

Fang Gan was dumbfounded when he saw Huang Xiaolong, and he thought that his eyes were playing tricks on him.

“Xiaolong?” He called out with uncertainty.

Huang Xiaolong smiled as he responded, “Uncle Fang, it’s me.”

Fang Gan stood up excitedly, with brightly shining eyes. “Xiaolong, it’s really you! How did you come in?” Then his expression changed as a thought occurred to him, “Were you ...?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He wanted to ask if Huang Xiaolong was also caught by the Fiend God Emperor Palace, but he noticed something was amiss. There were no Fiend God Emperor Palace’s experts escorting Huang Xiaolong, nor was Huang Xiaolong restrained.

Seeing the myriad of changes on Fang Gan’s face, Huang Xiaolong could tell what thoughts were racing through his mind. So he smiled and said to Fang Gan, “I’m here to save you.”

Fang Gan was stupefied, and his brain failed to register the meaning of Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Huang Xiaolong did not elaborate any further. The Radiance Divine Scepter appeared in his hand. Huang Xiaolong slashed off the cage imprisoning Fang Gan with the godforce infused within the scepter.

There was astonishment on Fang Gan’s face as he watched Huang Xiaolong slash the cage in two halves. The Fiend God Emperor Palace had forged these cages from numerous hard ores. During his time inside his cage, Fang Gan had tried various methods to break out, but he had failed. Yet Huang Xiaolong had slashed it open so effortlessly...?!

Fang Gan’s attention was altogether on the Radiance Divine Scepter in Huang Xiaolong’s hand.

“Uncle Fang, let’s go.” Huang Xiaolong reminded Fang Gan. His voice brought Fang Gan’s thoughts back to the present.

Fang Gan felt his body relaxed as he stepped out from the cage.

“Xiaolong, most of these people imprisoned here are other Emperor Palaces’ Ancestors, and many of them are acquaintances of mine. Why don’t we help them as well?” After stepping out from the cage, Fang Gan looked around and pointed at some of the other cages as he said to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded as it was merely an effort of waving his hand for him.

Huang Xiaolong subsequently slashed open the cages one by one, releasing other prisoners.

Many of these freed experts were extremely grateful to Huang Xiaolong. However, there were a few indifferent ones. They didn’t even utter a word of gratitude to Huang Xiaolong after they were freed. These people rushed outside in a hurry, treating Huang Xiaolong as air.

There were also some who faked gratitude towards Huang Xiaolong while their eyes were glued to the Radiance Divine Scepter in his hand. The greed in their eyes was blatant.

Perhaps they were wary of the fourteen-winged Radiance Angel behind Huang Xiaolong, so none of them dared to snatch unscrupulously on the spot.

Finally, several hundred experts were freed from the cages.

Huang Xiaolong led everyone as they flew towards the exit.

“The scepter in your hand is a grandmist treasure artifact, right?” Just as Huang Xiaolong was leading the way, a dozen people suddenly flew closer to Huang Xiaolong, and one of them inquired.

Huang Xiaolong cocked his head slightly and identified the person asking the question.

When he was freeing these people earlier, Fang Gan introduced each person to Huang Xiaolong. The person who had asked the question was an Ancestor from the South Boundary Emperor Palace, called Deng Kang.

The South Boundary Emperor Palace ranked twelfth among the other Emperor Palaces, which was quite high.

And those in the same group as Deng Kang were strong experts of late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm.

“Yes, it is a grandmist treasure artifact.” Huang Xiaolong was blase in his reply. Inwardly, he was sneering coldly, ‘Finally, there is someone who could not hold back their greed any longer!’

The instant Huang Xiaolong affirmed everyone’s suspicion, everyone’s eyes lit up with feverish greed and desire, especially Deng Kang’s. Deng Kang licked his lips subconsciously with anticipation, flashing Huang Xiaolong a charming smile as he said, “For how many chaos spirit stones would you be willing to sell this scepter? I desire to buy it!”
