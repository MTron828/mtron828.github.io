Even though Xiang Xun and the others had retreated some distance away, the luminous purple ball of light Huang Xiaolong continued to enlarge, extending over ten thousand li radius!

In the process, Huang Xiaolong’s purple light had merged with Jiang Hong’s purple light.

In the same moment the two luminous purple lights merged into one. The little cow, Xiang Xun, and the others saw a glaringly radiant purple light shoot out from Huang Xiaolong’s direction, straight up to the sky outside.

Rays of crepuscular purple rays formed a rotating light pillar that soared to the ninth heaven, breaking a hole in the void.

A huge purple energy vortex pulverized all the purple dragon yew trees into dust on the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak and nearby mountain peaks.

On the outside, the Chaos Black Camel and Barbarians experts watched with astounded expressions.

The purple energy vortex expanded.

This went on for roughly an hour. The purple energy vortex expanded until it covered the entire Dragon Rain Sacred Peak before its expansion halted.

The Barbarians breathed out in relief upon seeing this. For a moment, the Chaos Black Camel felt his back dampened with cold sweat from the purple energy vortex’s pressure.

Then, the purple energy vortex started to shrink at rapid speed before their eyes and vanished from sight.

Within the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak’s cave, the little cow, Xiang Xun, and the others saw the purple ray pillar where Huang Xiaolong had begun to shrink, and then vanished.

However, the purple clusters of light remained, splashing like angry waves again and again.

A few days later, the purple clusters of light dimmed, slowly revealing Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong’s figures within.

When the purple lights completely disappeared, the little cow and the others could clearly see Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong.

Feng Er and the rest immediately noticed that there were distinctive differences in Huang Xiaolong, as compared to before he had started refining the purple grandmist dragon, from his temperament to his aura.

Huang Xiaolong’s aura seemed ten times stronger than before, maybe even more.

Merging with the Blood Eye Devil Stele’s lower half had previously changed Huang Xiaolong’s temperament, adding a twist of devilish charm to him. This time around, after ‘taming’ the purple grandmist dragon, Huang Xiaolong’s temperament had evolved further, seemingly, he was even more captivating.

There was an unexplainable attraction.

Compared to Huang Xiaolong, Jiang Hong didn’t seem to have changed much on the surface, more like, no changes at all...?

Then again, only Jiang Hong himself knew if there was anything different. When Jiang Hong opened his eyes, they were filled with delight. After absorbing the grandmist aura river into his body, he had clearly sensed that his stage eight Grandmist Parasitic Medium cultivation had improved. Though the improvement was marginal, it was enough to bring a smile to his face.

With his Grandmist Parasitic Medium’s stage eight, this much amount of improvement would take him roughly a million years to achieve a similar level.. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Originally, Jiang Hong had no confidence at all that he would be able to advance to the ninth stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium, but it was different now. He felt a ray of hope that he would be able to do so in an unknown billions of years!

Jiang Hong readjusted his emotions, then looked in Huang Xiaolong’s direction and received a shock. He chuckled, “Congratulations on Junior Brother’s breakthrough ah.”

Huang Xiaolong had broken through from mid-Fifth Order God King Realm to early Sixth Order God King Realm!

Though it didn’t sound like much of an improvement, it brought great waves of shock to Jiang Hong’s heart.

When Jiang Hong had first taken notice of Huang Xiaolong at the Demonic Python City a few years back, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was only at the peak late of Third Order God King Realm! Only a few years had passed since then!

Huang Xiaolong grinned at Jiang Hong and responded, “Congratulations to both of us.”

Although Huang Xiaolong’s strength did not improve as much as the time he had refined the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele, the benefits were greater by far!

Firstly, Huang Xiaolong’s Grandmist Parasitic Medium cultivation that had been stuck at the peak of the second stage for the longest time had finally advanced to the third stage!

The third stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium!

This was much more than simply advancing a level!

At the third stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium, the grandmist worms that he condensed would be able to attack and kill enemies! Nothing could stop the gradmist worms! As grandmist worms were condensed from grandmist godforce, their attacks were unpredictable and unavoidable.

At the first stage and second stage of Grandmist Parasitic Medium, his grandmist worms had no attack ability.

Moreover, he had merely absorbed less than one-millionth of the purple grandmist dragon’s energy. At the moment, the purple grandmist dragon was coiling in his godsea. As he continued to absorb the purple grandmist dragon’s energy while cultivating the Grandmist Parasitic Medium in the future, he would be able to advance quickly. It was likely he could break through to the Seventh Order God King Realm in less than ten years!

Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong chatted merrily as they stood up.

At this time, the little cow, Xiang Xun, Feng Er, and the rest had flown over to Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong.

“Congratulations Master!

“Congratulations Manor Lord!”

“Congratulations Grandmist Emperor!”

Xiang Xun, Feng Er, and the others cheerfully congratulated Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong.

The little cow’s cow face was full of smiles looking from Huang Xiaolong to Jiang Hong as she said, “Congratulations to two kiddos, this old cow’s heart is brimming with envy towards you both ah.”

She was telling the truth, anyone would be envious watching Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong successfully subjugate the purple grandmist aura and grandmist aura. She was no exception.

Receiving the little cow’s congratulations, Jiang Hong dared not delay in responding at all. He quickly smiled and said, “Many thanks, Senior Azure Cow.”

“Why are you thanking me for?” The little cow chuckled. “Instead, I have to thank you, if it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have gotten an opportunity to enjoy so many snacks to pass the time.” She threw a top-grade chaos spiritual pill into her mouth after saying that.

The top-grade chaos spiritual pill was one of her snacks.

It was indeed as the little cow said, if it wasn’t for Jiang Hong, it would have been hard for her to get her hands on these snacks being where they were.

Jiang Hong and Huang Xiaolong exchanged a helpless look, both smiling wryly.

“Senior Brother, let’s head out.” said Huang Xiaolong.

Now that they had tamed the purple grandmist dragon and grandmist aura river, they needed to hurry and cross the Land of Lightning Penalty to leave this space. Huang Xiaolong could see that in the last one year or so, Feng Er, Gui Yi, Gui Er, Xu Baisheng, and others’ godforce had dispersed considerably.

“Agreed!” Jiang Hong nodded, he was aware that Huang Xiaolong’s companions were running out of time.

Without delay, Huang Xiaolong leaped onto the little cow’s back and sped towards the cave’s mouth. Jiang Hong, Xiang Xun, and the rest followed closely behind. They soon regrouped with the Chaos Black Camel and the Barbarians waiting outside.

When the Barbarians saw Huang Xiaolong and Jiang Hong, their eyes lit up. In the next second, their eyes widened in shock, for they noticed that Huang Xiaolong had actually broken through to early Sixth Order God King Realm!

When Huang Xiaolong had entered the Dragon Rain Sacred Peak, he was only a mid-Fifth Order God King Realm, a little over a year later, Huang Xiaolong was already an early Sixth Order God King Realm?!

“Master!” The Chaos Black Camel stepped forward and saluted Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong nodded. Without any nonsense, Huang Xiaolong turned his attention to Lei Budong, Feng Chen, and the rest of the Barbarians and said, “Lead us to the Land of Lightning Penalty now!” With a wave of his hand, the Dragon Shark Flying Ship appeared in midair.

Huang Xiaolong ushered Lei Budong, Feng Chen, chieftains, and the rest of the Barbarians onto the Dragon Shark Flying Ship. The Dragon Shark Flying Ship glided through the air, in the direction of the Land of Lightning Penalty.

Based on the Dragon Shark Flying Ship’s speed, they could reach the Land of Lightning Penalty in a month’s time. But Huang Xiaolong was not idle at all during this time, he persistently cultivated his Grandmist Parasitic Medium to absorb the purple grandmist dragon’s energy.
