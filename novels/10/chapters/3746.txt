Chapter 3747: I Heard You’ve Got a Devil Mirror Fragment

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor stared at the enormous cliff wall before him. Surging dragon qi appeared around him as he shouted towards it, “Ao Shan, stop hiding. This time, I will definitely subjugate you, and have you integrate into me.”

Ao Shan was the name the dragon soul was born with.

It was silent for a while after the Dragon Sage Human Emperor finished speaking, but they saw bright light emerging to the surface of the cliff wall after a while.

A dragon condensed from golden light, and this was the dragon soul source, Ao Shan.

“Ao Xuan, you think you’re capable of absorbing me?” the Dragon soul source Ao Shan sneered. “After so many years, you’re still dreaming when the sun is out!”

Dragon Sage Human Emperor wasn’t angered by Ao Shan’s mocking words. “I couldn’t do so in the past, but this time, I have collected materials from the Origin Universe and outside of the Origin Universe that can suppress Dragon Race’s dragon souls. I spent several hundred million years forging a Dragon Soul Bind. With this Dragon Soul Bind, you won’t be able to escape from me!”

A golden rope flew into the air as soon as he finished speaking. The golden rope wasn’t particularly thick but when the Dragon Sage Human Emperor channeled his dragon energy into it, the golden rope grew twice its size and length, standing vertically between heaven and earth as if it was about to bind the heavens.

The golden rope exuded a faint but bright glow, and under the scope of the glow, the dragon soul source Ao Shan was pinned on the spot.

Ao Xuan was genuinely alarmed.

“The rest of you guard the surroundings, and don’t allow anyone to approach this place,” Dragon Sage Human Emperor ordered the Dragon Saint Palace’s experts.

The Dragon Saint Palace’s experts respectfully complied and spread out a distance around the area to prohibit others from approaching.

Dragon Sage Human Emperor waved his hands in the air as if he was orchestrating the golden rope. The golden rope wriggled in the air and formed a loop that went after the dragon soul Ao Shan.

Just as the golden loop was reaching the cliff wall, the dragon light condensed by the dragon soul source burst in glaring rays of light that soared to the sky, and the startling dragon qi repelled off the Dragon Soul Bind.

Dragon Sage Human Emperor was inwardly startled.

This dragon soul has grown stronger again since the last time!

“Ao Xuan, this Dragon Soul Bind of yours can indeed suppress me, but do you really think you can capture me based on some rope?” dragon soul Ao Shan sneered. “If you’re able to capture me relying on a mere rope, I won’t be called the dragon soul source.”

Dragon Sage Human Emperor remained calm on the surface. “That’s because you still have not seen the true power of the Dragon Soul Bind!”

“I will have you witness the true power of this Dragon Soul Bind!” Dragon Sage Human Emperor rose to the sky, standing in the middle of the Dragon Soul Bind. The golden rope coiled around him, and dragon qi from his body surged and spread into an ocean of dragon qi. Glaring lights dominated the sky as countless phantoms of divine dragons flew out from the Dragon Soul Bind.

A shocking dragon might descend onto the land like a tsunami.

“This is?!” Dragon soul Ao Shan couldn't help but exclaim in shock and burning anger, “Ao Xuan, in order to forge this Dragon Soul Bind, you killed so many God of Creation Realm dragons, your sins are unforgivable!”

“Sins are unforgivable?!” Dragon Sage Human Emperor stood in the air with his hands clasped at his back. “Once I successfully comprehend the Devil Mirror Palace’s devil mirror, I can breakthrough to a Universe God. At that time, all the universes’ living beings will kneel before me, and I will rule them. Even Yuan Fang won’t be an exception. At that time, who will dare to say I have sinned?”

As the Dragon Sage Human Emperor spoke, his hands moved, and the numerous divine dragons’ souls formed the Grand Formation of Dragon. The Grand Formation of Dragon locked the immediate space around the dragon soul source Ao Shan. Ao Shan distinctly felt his strength and body being greatly suppressed, reducing his agility.

Dragon Sage Human Emperor blurred in a flicker and appeared above the dragon soul source with the Dragon Spear in his hand thrusting downward.

Dragon soul source Ao Shan struck out with his claw in panic.

In the past, his strike could easily scatter the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s spear qi, but this time around, the spear qi pierced through his attack and landed on his palm.

“Ao Xuan, you’re relying on the Dragon Soul Bind to suppress me, but you yourself have no ability!” the dragon soul source roared.

“A win is a win. To me, the process is not important,” the Dragon Sage Human Emperor stated nonchalantly.

“You’re right. A win is a win, and the process is not important,” right at this time, a voice repeated the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s words, applauding in agreement.

Both the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and dragon soul source were startled by the unexpected voice.

“Who is it?!” Dragon Saint Palace’s experts barked curtly from the four directions.

A figure approached leisurely from the horizon. He was a young man, and he reached the enormous cliff wall in the blink of an eye.

“Stop right there!”

A Dragon Saint Palace’s marshal shouted, trying to stop the intruder in his tracks, but no one saw what Huang Xiaolong did, and in the next second, that marshal was knocked into the air, and he fell into a dirt puddle not far away.

The air seemed to solidify.

That Dragon Saint Palace marshall was a supreme expert with 23.1 billion mark battle strength.

A thought flashed in the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s mind as he stared at the uninvited visitor. “Are you Huang Xiaolong?”

Other Dragon Saint Palace experts were shocked to hear that.

Only the dragon soul source Ao Shan seemed baffled as he had never heard of Huang Xiaolong’s name.

That’s right, the young man was Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong continued to walk forward, bypassing the Dragon Saint Palace’s experts and stood meters from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor. “Yes, I am Huang Xiaolong.”

He glanced at the Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s Dragon Soul Bind and the dragon soul source.

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor frowned slightly at Huang Xiaolong’s abrupt appearance as he was on the verge of successfully capturing the dragon soul source with the Dragon Soul Bind. Who knew the most crucial moment would be interrupted by Huang Xiaolong?

Huang Xiaolong easily defeated the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, proving that he was no walkover, and his strength was probably comparable to the second-ranked Human Emperor, the Buddha Sage Human Emperor. It would be troublesome if Huang Xiaolong joined hands with the dragon soul source.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re also here for the dragon soul force?” the Dragon Sage Human Emperor asked in a sullen tone. “How about this? We can cooperate to capture this dragon soul source and divide it between the two of us. I will take eighty percent and you can take twenty.”

But Huang Xiaolong shook his head and stated, “I didn’t come for the dragon soul source.”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Didn’t come for the dragon soul source?

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor and Dragon Saint Palace’s experts had not expected that.

Huang Xiaolong then said to the Dragon Sage Human Emperor, “I heard that you’ve got a piece of devil mirror fragment from the Devil Mirror Palace.”

The Dragon Sage Human Emperor’s face sank, and he laughed without mirth in his eyes. “Huang Xiaolong, are you telling me that you’ve come to the Dragon Soul Mountain for my fragment of devil mirror?”

As he spoke, his momentum rose dangerously and a suffocating dragon might rush towards Huang Xiaolong. He had not settled the account with Xiaolong for kidnapping the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, yet Huang Xiaolong had the audacity to covet the devil mirror fragment from him.

“That’s right.” Huang Xiaolong ignored the rising momentum from the Dragon Sage Human Emperor and went on casually, “Hand over the mirror fragment if you don’t wish to end up like the Treasure Sage Human Emperor, and don’t force me to take it.”

“Insolent!”

The Dragon Saint Palace’s experts were enraged by Huang Xiaolong’s words, and all of them lunged towards him. But, all of them were sent flying with a wave of Huang Xiaolong’s hand even before they got close, and they crashed to the ground in various directions.
