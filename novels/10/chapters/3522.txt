Chapter 3523: Universe Boat

 

Everyone fell silent when they heard his idea.

“Xiaolong, have you decided?” Pangu was the first to break the silence. “The First Universe isn’t as simple as you think! The universe is controlled by the Creation Palace!”

“The First Universe…” Ao Xing’s expression turned a little unnatural. “There are quite a few freaks in the First Universe!”

As someone who had half a step in the Universe God Realm, one could only imagine how strong the existences he classified as ‘freaks’ were!

“Brother Ao Xing, have you been to the First Universe?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

“I’ve been there with your sister-in-law. However, we didn’t choose to stay for long. We ran into several monsters of the First Universe not too long after we entered.”

Pangu continued, “Senior Ao Xing, are you talking about Kun Feng of the Creation Palace?”

Kun Feng was the first palace master of the Creation Palace! He established the Creation Palace, and one could only imagine how strong he was!

Ao Xing sighed, “Other than him, there’s Kai Dong and Hong Xuan.” His expression turned serious all of a sudden. “There’s also Mei Jie!”

Ao Meixia’s expression sank when he spoke of Mei Jie.

Pangu turned serious, but hatred flashed in Wang Meiqi’s eyes.

There were four palace masters in the Creation Palace, and Ao Xing just named all of them!

Kun Feng, Kai Dong, and Hong Xuan were half-step Universe Gods. Even though Mei Jie wasn’t one, he was the strongest among them all with two worlds!

“Xiaolong, you might have fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree, but you need to be careful if you meet any one of the four. It’s especially so if you meet Mei Jie.” Ao Meixia cautioned, “Mei Jie has two worlds, and he had accumulated nearly 18 billion units of grand cosmos energy. He can exterminate countless creeds with a single attack, and you won’t even be able to transform into the divine tree in time. Even if I join hands with Ao Xing, we won’t be his match!”

How strong were two half-step Universe Gods?

Even so, they weren’t his opponents!

18 billion units of grand cosmos energy was a terrifying concept. Even though Mei Jie wasn’t at the peak of the God of Creation Realm, he could easily defeat half-step Universe Gods!

Huang Long, Pangu, and the others were hearing it for the first time, and they were shocked to discover that Mei Jie was such a terrifying existence.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head when he noticed how serious Ao Xing and Ao Meixia were. “I will definitely take care of myself.”

Soon after, he asked about several matters regarding the First Universe.

Huang Long sighed and shook his head when he learned that Huang Xiaolong was planning to head over alone. “I’m coming with you.”

“That’s right. It’s too dangerous for you to go alone. We’ll all go with you!” Ao Meixia interjected.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the anxious looks on their faces, he chuckled, “It’s not like I’m going there to pick a fight with them… Why are you so worried? I’m going over to look for resources while looking for news on Meng Tian and Huang Sheng! You can rest assured I’m not going to the Creation Palace to look for a fight.”

“If we go together, we’ll draw a lot of attention to ourselves!”

“It’s more convenient for me to head over alone…”

Ao Xing and the others stared at each other in silence.

“Your Highness, allow me to go with you,” Wang Meiqi interrupted all of a sudden. “I wish to take a trip back, and I’m familiar with the First Universe.” 

A look of anticipation appeared on her face when she asked the question.

Huang Xiaolong could only sigh helplessly when he saw the look on her face. “Alright. However, you need to listen to me when we arrive. You are not allowed to seek out revenge on your own!”

Wang Meiqi sucked in a long breath and replied, “Your Highness, I know what to do.”

“Big Brother! I want to go to the First Universe too! You can’t just bring along a beauty and leave me behind!” the little dragon roared.

Staring at each other for a moment, everyone roared with laughter.

“Little brat, what are you talking about? There’s no way you’re allowed to follow him this time,” Ao Meixia snapped at the little dragon after some time.

Pouting unhappily, the little dragon tried to talk his way into following Huang Xiaolong. 

However, Ao Xing and Ao Meixia were adamant this time, and they refused to let him have his way.

Several days later…

Huang Xiaolong left the Hundred Spirits World with Wang Meiqi, but they weren’t alone. Ao Guang and Ao Shenghai followed quietly behind because of Huang Long’s insistence. Unable to change his father’s mind, Huang Xiaolong could only allow them to come along.

Before they left, Ao Xing handed a piece of Star Dragon Scale over and reminded Huang Xiaolong, “If you meet any danger, crush this scale.”

The scale was different from the ones Huang Xiaolong obtained back in the Dragon’s Impasse. Ao Xing had personally refined the scale he passed to Huang Xiaolong, and there were countless restrictions imprinted within. It was able to block a single strike when he ran into danger.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t refuse, and he kept the scale carefully.

“Also, if you get the chance, look for the Universe Boat!” Ao Xing thought of something, and he quickly added.

“Universe Boat?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

Ao Meixia chimed in from the side, “The Universe Boat is the treasure born in the First Universe. It might even be stronger than the Star Dragon Divine Tree! I’ve heard that Kun Feng ran into it once, but he failed to refine it. From then on, the Universe Boat disappeared and no one could see it again.”

“Kun Feng and everyone from the Creation Palace has been looking for the Universe Boat ever since. If they manage to locate it, the consequences will be unimaginable!”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ao Xing and Ao Meixia quickly told Huang Xiaolong everything they knew about the Universe Boat.

Half an hour later, the four figures disappeared into the sea of stars.

Huang Xiaolong and the others tore through the void and entered the First Universe after several years.

“Is this the First Universe?!” Huang Xiaolong looked around, and he saw that the laws of space in the First Universe were a little more restrictive than that in the Star Dragon Universe. The entire area seemed larger.

Since it was the oldest universe, it made sense that the laws were more complete.

The Star Dragon Universe might be covered in dragon qi, but there wasn’t a single trace of that in the First Universe. Instead, there was a different type of qi that was formed with the combination of dragon spiritual qi and spiritual qi.

“Your Highness, where should we go?” Ao Shenghai was the first to ask.

Looking at Wang Meiqi, Huang Xiaolong chuckled, “We’ll let Meiqi bring us around. Why don’t we head to the Fantasy Butterfly Race first?”

Wang Meiqi was from the Fantasy Butterfly Race, and her heart trembled when she heard what Huang Xiaolong said. “Many thanks, Your Highness!” It had been many years since she last returned, and she wanted nothing more than to return to her race.

Huang Xiaolong shook his hand and laughed, “There’s no need to thank me! Alright, we’re guests in the First Universe, and you can bring us around now that we’re here!”
