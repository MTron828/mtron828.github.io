Chapter 2303: Breakthrough!

As the spear was about to pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s skull, golden dragon scales appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s palm as he blocked the tip of the spear.

Clang!

A crisp sound of striking metals rang out.

Sparks flew in the air and Zhou Ze widened his eyes in shock when he realized that he failed to pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s dragon scale! Then, as he faced Huang Xiaolong’s unbudging palm, a wave of pain shot through his arm.

Zhou Ze finally realized that something was off, and he quickly retreated. In the blink of an eye, he retrieved his spear and glared at Huang Xiaolong. “You....”

He had never thought that Huang Xiaolong’s defense would be so strong!

He even wanted to ask Huang Xiaolong how he had managed to train his defense!

In fact, when Huang Xiaolong had devoured Yang Rong in the past, his saint attributes weren’t the only thing that Huang Xiaolong had assimilated. His memories were intact and Huang Xiaolong had pieced them all together to form another set of holy martial art. It was passed down to the Holy Princes of the Evolving Dragon Holy Ground, and it was called the Undying Dragon Art. As long as one had a dragon-attributed saint physique, one could cultivate the skill to increase the defensive capabilities of their fleshy body!

Along with Huang Xiaolong’s constant evolution of his saint physique, his body became stronger and stronger. Zhou Ze couldn’t destroy the scales on his body with a single strike.

Even if Zhou Ze wielded a top-grade supreme spiritual treasure, it wouldn’t be enough to pierce through Huang Xiaolong’s defenses.

“Zhou Ze, it’s time for you to unleash your Withered Glory Devil Art. Otherwise, you won’t be able to damage me in the slightest!” Huang Xiaolong slowly approached Zhou Ze and suggested.

The Withered Glory Devil Art was a semi holy martial art.

Of course, not everyone was like Huang Xiaolong. The semi holy martial art was the strongest weapon Zhou Ze had in his arsenal. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The look in Zhou Ze’s eyes condensed and killing intent flashed through them. “Did you use some sort of holy martial art to defend yourself? After I kill you, I’ll learn it for myself!”

Devilish light pierced through the skies as soon as the words left his mouth.

The pillar of devil light that pierced into the skies contained two opposing types of energies, and they surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

The ground beneath them started to crack, but they reformed themselves in the next instant.

“That was the Withered Glory Devil Art!”

“Withered Glory Devil Qi!” Zhou Ze’s spear shot towards Huang Xiaolong once again and with the assistance of the Withered Glory Devil Qi, it was no longer as weak as before.

“Die!”

The look in Zhou Ze’s eyes turned sharp as bark-like scales appeared around his body. It was formed from the energy from his saint bloodline and possessed extraordinary defense.

Deciding against taking the attack head-on, Huang Xiaolong was a little more cautious. His figure blurred as he dodged the spear.

Soon, the two of them were locked in a fierce battle.

Destructive shockwaves slammed into their surroundings, causing no small amount of damage. Mountain ranges crumbled and forests were swept clean.

Dragon roars filled the skies as devils’ shrieks rang out occasionally.

Their battle attracted the attention of the various experts around them.

“What’s going on?!”

“That’s the Withered Glory Devil Qi! Old Devil Zhou Ze is fighting someone! Someone actually dared to challenge the old devil himself! Who has the guts to do something like this? Several tens of years ago, the Ocean Emperor Sect’s sect leader had led a group of experts to kill Zhou Ze, but all of them had ended up paying with their lives for their foolishness!”

They gasped in shock as fear gripped their hearts.

Dozens of minutes later, the dragon roars stopped and the devils in the air dissipated.

Everyone stared at each other, at a loss of what to do.

“Did Old Devil Zhou Se kill the other party already? That’s fast....”

As they guessed the outcome of the battle, a figure tore through the skies with a certain object in his hand. As they looked at him approach, they saw that he was someone clad in golden dragon armor! The object in his hand was Zhou Ze’s head!

Jumping into the air in fright, everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. They retreated to the side, as though they were afraid of blocking his way.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t bother with the complicated looks they shot him. Getting onto the Rainbow Phoenix, he sped away.

Only after a long time did everyone regain their senses.

“That young man seems to only be in the half-step Venerable Realm....”

“How can that be?! Even Holy Princes in the Holy Gate wouldn’t be able to kill Old Devil Zhou Ze with such ease! How can a half-step Venerable accomplish such a feat?!”

...

When Huang Xiaolong returned to the headquarters, he quickly left for the mission hall.

After retrieving the heads of his targets and placing them on the counter, he called the Hall Master out to verify his accomplishments.

“This... Your Highness, you managed to complete them all!” Zheng Xu stared at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief. However, he realized that whatever he said was a little misleading, and he hastily explained himself. “I didn’t mean any disrespect... I was merely shocked...”

Huang Xiaolong waved his hand and laughed, “I understand. Make your verification. If there are no problems, I would like to retrieve my rewards. I have to return to the Myriad Dragon Peak to cultivate.”

Zheng Xu bowed and continued, “Your Highness, please wait a moment!” He verified the identities of those Huang Xiaolong killed before giving out the rewards for all the missions.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong left, he made a report to Li Wen and the other Eminent Elders.

Of course, that was what the doyens had instructed him to do.

“Young Master!” Zhang Wenyue ran out from the Myriad Dragon Peak the moment Huang Xiaolong approached, and she yelled in joy.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as a smile appeared on his face.

“Young Master, you’re finally back!” A sweet smile blossomed on Zhang Wenyue’s face as she slowly flew towards Huang Xiaolong.

“That’s right! I’m back!”

“Brother Huang...” Feng Tianyu and his beloved disciple, Xue Qi, appeared to greet him.

“Let’s enter the palace!” Huang Xiaolong knew that if he responded to them now, there would be no end to the questions. As such, he decided to return to the palace before speaking to them.

“Brother Feng, congratulations! You finally entered the Venerable Realm!” Huang Xiaolong turned to Feng Tianyu and chuckled.

With Huang Xiaolong’s abilities, he saw that Feng Tianyu had already broken through in the time he was away.

Feng Tianyu snickered, “It was by pure luck! All thanks to Brother Huang’s spiritual pills, I managed to break through!” The smile on his face froze when he looked at Huang Xiaolong once again. “You... You’re already in the half-step Venerable Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong had already entered the Half Step Venerable Realm in the short time he had spent away!

“Hahaha, I was lucky!” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. “I used the rank-five and rank-six origin spiritual pills to hasten my breakthrough!”

Lucky?!

Everyone stared at him in shock.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong arranged for a banquet to celebrate Feng Tianyu’s ascension to the Venerable Realm. He also celebrated the fact that he had managed to complete all twenty missions within the deadline. Moreover, he wanted to celebrate his rapidly improving saint attributes!

Even though he hadn’t tested them, he knew that his saint godheads, saint bloodlines, and saint physique should have already entered the top one thousand ranks after he devoured Zhou Ze.

In the dead of night, Huang Xiaolong sat cross-legged in a secret room in the Myriad Dragon Peak. He took out all eight level-seven origin spiritual pills Xu Jun had given to him.

Looking at the eight Golden Buddha Divine Pills before him, Huang Xiaolong sucked in a deep breath. He had decided to enter the Venerable Realm in one go!
