Hearing Chen Yifei’s words, Huang Xiaolong shook his head, looking unperturbed as he spoke, “Truthfully, you three really let me down. Had you sincerely submitted, I would have healed your injuries, but now...” The killing intent in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes was piercing cold.

Chen Yifei and his two brothers laughed even louder, thick with contempt.

“His mommy, did I hear right? What did this brat just say, that he’s very disappointed with us?” Chen Yifei laughed so hard that he was about to tear up. He then looked at Huang Xiaolong with a mocking smile on his face, “Brat, you want to kill us? Relying on your measly peak mid-Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm strength?”

Chen Yiguang guffawed, saying, “A peak late-Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm is saying he’s going to kill three Seventh Order Ancient God Realm masters? A bunch of people will die from laughter when I tell this joke! Now I understand why some people die without rhyme or reason, they died while laughing!”

Three people’s laughter echoed in the hall.

“Big brother, Second brother, this brat has a cow with him.” Chen Yicheng reminded his brothers.

Chen Yifei and Chen Yiguang’s laughter was renewed, now containing a trace of malice.

“Right, right, right, this brat still has a cow.” Chen Yifei snickered, “This brat and that cow want to kill us.”

Chen Yiguang grinned and walked toward Huang Xiaolong, “Brat, you must be thinking that our injuries are very heavy, that’s why you, with your little strength, dared to take advantage of us. Yes, our injuries were indeed heavy, as we now barely have a one-thousandth of our peak strength, but that’s enough to kill a Seventh Order Heavenly God Realm like you.”

“Tell me, how do you want to die? Seeing how you’ve saved us before, we’ll give you the right to choose how you die.” However, Chen Yiguang already circulated his godforce as he said this, a light shooting out from his index finger.

“Kill that brat, leave that cow for now. We still need it to bring us out.” Chen Yifei reminded.

“I know, Big brother.” A sword light shot out from Chen Yiguang’s hand, slashing vertically at Huang Xiaolong. Just as the sword slash was about to cut Huang Xiaolong into halves, all of a sudden, a giant paw slammed down onto the incoming attack, dissipating the sword light in an instant.

While Chen Yifei and Chen Yiguang were dumbfounded, two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts appeared in front of them.

“Ancient Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts!”

More importantly, there were two Fifth Order Ancient God Realm Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts!

Huang Xiaolong remained calm and indifferent as he looked at three brothers, “I do not have the strength the kill you all, but these two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts do, am I right?”

The three Chen Brothers’ faces turned gloomy in an instant.

If the three of them weren’t injured, they naturally wouldn’t be afraid of these two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts, but in reality, their injuries were quite heavy, and it was extremely easy for these two beasts to kill them.

Had it been other ordinary Ancient God Realm demonic beasts, they would still have hopes of escaping, but against two ancient divine beasts, there was no chance of surviving this time.

Chen Yifei’s eyes flickered, quickly saying, “We can give you all of our stuff, including the Chaos Fire Metallic Stone robes and also swear loyalty to you!”

They would wait until they were healed before taking back twice as much!

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “You think you have a second chance?” The two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts threw their heads back, roaring with ferocity. In the next second, their enormous paws slammed down on the three Chen Brothers from above.

Chen Yifei and his two brothers retreated in a panic.

However, the injuries from the Pill Blending Grand Formation caused their speed to decline significantly. The three brothers shot backward like meteors as blood spurted out from their mouths.

Before they could react, the two Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts’ enormous paws once again fell on them like small mountains.

The palace shook violently from the impact, and the three brothers’ bodies were distorted out of shape on the palace floor.

However, Huang Xiaolong was bewildered. Even after the Cloud Devouring Divine Beasts attacked, there wasn’t a single crack or dent on the palace floor, making him wonder what kind of material the floor was made of.

Over a dozen minutes had passed.

The three brothers were still lying on the floor, unmoving and not breathing. Under the two Cloud Devouring Diviner Beasts’ enthusiastic treatment, they had lost all human form.

Huang Xiaolong walked up to three unrecognizable meat patties, picking up three Chaos Fire Metallic Stone robes and spatial rings, whereas the little cow picked up the three godheads, crunching one of them happily.

Huang Xiaolong’s supreme divine fire flared, burning the three people’s remains.

Even though these three old men were Seventh Order Ancient God Realm masters, Huang Xiaolong did not feel any pity; once he advanced to Eighth Order Heavenly God Realm he’d able to refine that Black Baboon.

That chaos spiritual beast was definitely more powerful than these three brothers.

After erasing the three brothers’ remains, Huang Xiaolong undid the restrictions over the spatial rings and checked their contents. There was really quite a lot of good stuff inside. Medicinal herbs with ages above three and four million years, Ancient God Realm godheads, divine pellets refined by Ancient God Realm masters, more than twenty billion shenbi, and more than a dozen yellowed cultivation manuals enshrouded by haloes.

Huang Xiaolong flipped through several random manuals, judging from the contents, most of them were ancient sects’ cultivation manuals, most likely found by the Chen Brothers in the Extraterritorial Devil Battlefield.

Now, all of these belonged to Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong took out all the Ancient God Realm godheads and gave them to the little cow.

Now that he had the Phoenix God Palace’s chaos spiritual pills, these Ancient God Realm godheads were more useful to the little cow.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t anxious to start consuming these chaos spiritual pills. His attention fell onto the upper left Phoenix God stone pillar. This stone pillar was probably a transmission point to another space.

The little cow also looked at the stone pillar, saying, “The phoenix carved on that stone pillar hides the Chaos Vermillion Scarlet Heaven Formation, it needs blood from a chaos spiritual beast to activate.”

Chaos spiritual beast’s blood?

Huang Xiaolong nodded and extracted some blood from the Black Baboon corpse. With a wave of his hand, the blood scattered onto the Phoenix God stone pillar and disappeared before the little cow blew out a cloud of purple lightning. Phoenix flames rose, causing fire element spiritual energy to sweep out like waves; in the glaring red flames, Huang Xiaolong and the little cow were quietly transported to another space.

The place was also an enormous hall many times bigger than the one outside, and right above it was a phoenix!

A phoenix in deep slumber. Its body was a thousand zhang long with flames dancing around it; its feather glimmered with nine iridescent colors.

There were also four giant pillars in the enormous hall densely inscribed with symbols that released faint fire spiritual energy into the phoenix above.

“Chaos spiritual beast, the Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix. This phoenix has quite the background and is very powerful.” The little cow said. “But it was injured and entered deep slumber. These four pillars’ continuous supply of fire element spiritual energy helped it heal, but it still needs another three to four hundred years to wake up.”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised, he did not expect a slumbering Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix to be in this separate space. Since the little cow said it was very powerful, then Huang Xiaolong believed it must be. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He was curious who injured it to this extent, then he remembered the Pill Blending Tower that was almost completely destroyed by someone. ’Could it be the same person?’
