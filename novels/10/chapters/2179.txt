Chapter 2180: The Sword Race Patriarch

“It’s the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler!”

The arrival of Huang Xiaolong’s group immediately attracted the crowd’s attention.

“How did the Heavenly Saint Ruler and Mighty God Ruler come together? Did they also form an alliance? That golden pig under them, could it be the Golden Pig Treasure?!”

Many guesses ran through the crowd’s mind.

The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng and the others turned to look. When he saw that Huang Xiaolong was sitting on the Golden Pig Treasure, killing intent erupted in his eyes.

The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng strode towards Huang Xiaolong in slow strides.

The Giant Kun Ruler frowned faintly, watching Dong Cheng’s action, but he did not stop Dong Cheng. Honestly speaking, he too wanted to see if this Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength was as amazing as the rumors claimed to be.

Anyone who had not witnessed the battle with their own eyes would have a hard time believing a late-Sixth Order Sovereign had defeated an early Tenth Order Sovereign expert!

The Giant Kun Prince by the Giant Kun Ruler’s side fixed a deathly glare at Huang Xiaolong and said to the Giant Kun Ruler, “Father, it seems the Mighty God Ruler has also joined Huang Xiaolong!” Other than that reason, it was impossible for the Mighty God Ruler and the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts to travel with Huang Xiaolong.

The Giant Kun Ruler did not respond to his son, and there were no changes to his expression, making it hard for others to guess what he was thinking.

At the same time, several million miles away, was a group of experts clad in lightning robes. They, too, were staring at Huang Xiaolong, Heavenly Saint Ruler, and the rest.

“That young man is Huang Xiaolong? Is he really that strong?” A middle-aged man clad in a lightning robe asked. His tone fully displayed his doubt. He was one of the people who did not believe Huang Xiaolong was capable of defeating the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng.

Another middle-aged man scoffed, “Who cares about his battle strength? It’s fine as long as he doesn’t hinder us. If he dares to hinder the 33 Heavens Race, I won’t give a sh*t if he’s Huang Xiaolong or not. Even if he’s Huang Dalong, I’ll kill him just the same!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Kill!

A chilling air surged around the middle-aged man, exuding an overwhelming pressure.

The nearby experts quickly moved away from them under the overwhelming pressure from this middle-aged man. The fluctuations over here even attracted a few looks from the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s experts.

In the meantime, the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng and a group of the Heavenly Terror Country’s experts were already standing still in front of Huang Xiaolong. The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng stared at Huang Xiaolong like a poisonous snake staring at its prey.

“Huang Xiaolong, return the Golden Pig Treasure and Unbreakable Divine Shield to me. Then kneel and beg, and I might leave your corpse intact!” Dong Cheng demanded icily.

His words enraged the Heavenly Saint Country’s and Mighty God Heavenly Country’s experts.

Huang Xiaolong raised his hand to calm them down as he responded, “You can still save some face if you scram now, or you might not have the chance to do even that!”

The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng’s fuse lit up in an instant.

Suddenly, whistling sounds came from the horizon as a group of people clad in white robes arrived on an enormous sword. Although the group was still a hundred million miles away, they could feel the sharp sword qi coming at them, as if they were being cut all over.

The crowd stirred seeing this group of people.

“It’s the Sword Race!”

“The Sword Race has closed off from the outside world for three billion years, but they actually came out this time!”

“The one with the warfan seems to be the Sword Race’s Patriarch! A long time ago, I witnessed him killing a Ninth Order Sovereign expert with one slash! After that Ninth Order Sovereign got slashed, his body burst into numerous pieces. It was so tragic, I tell you!”

The person standing in front of the enormous sword carried a strange looking sword on his back. The sword was shaped like an open fan, swords were used as bones of the fan. There were exactly one hundred swords that were used as bones supporting the shape of the fan. On the surface of each sword were inscriptions of ancient sword runes that formed a supreme sword array.

Upon seeing the Sword Race Patriarch, whether it was the 33 Heavens Race’s experts, or the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s experts, their expressions became solemn.

When the Sword Race Patriarch used to sweep over the Heavens Path in the past, no one was his opponent. Even the current Black Dragon Ruler had admitted that he was not the Sword Race Patriarch’s opponent.

“Father, it’s that kid who injured me!” The young woman standing behind the Sword Race Patriarch yelled when she spotted Huang Xiaolong, pointing angrily at him.

The young woman’s voice was not low. Thus her words made everyone look at Huang Xiaolong in bewilderment.

The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng sneered hearing what the young woman said. He didn’t know that Huang Xiaolong wanted to die so badly that he had even dared to injure the Sword Race Patriarch’s daughter. The Sword Race Patriarch was known for his protective nature over his own people. One time, a disciple of his was injured by a super heavenly country’s expert. Later on, the Sword Race Patriarch had gone in person to kill that expert and razed the sect the expert belonged to the ground.

That matter had shocked the Heavens Path. That super heavenly country at that time was an existence that ranked in the top twenty.

As expected, the Sword Race Patriarch Jian Qintian looked at Huang Xiaolong with faint creases between his brows, “Kid, you are the one who injured my daughter?” His gaze was sharp as swords, exuding overwhelming pressure on Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong replied calmly, “That’s right, it was me.”

The Sword Race Patriarch Jian Qintian’s eyes narrowed, “I heard that you’re capable of defeating the Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng. How about this, I won’t bully a junior like you. You can make the first move. If you can take one sword slash from me, I won’t kill you!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and said, “There is no need, make your move!”

The crowd immediately held their breaths in anticipation, opening their eyes wide in case they missed something.

“Fine!” The Sword Race Patriarch Jian Qintian harrumphed.

Nobody saw how or when he made his move, yet the warfan hanging on his back suddenly shot out. Piercing sword qi lit up a thousand miles of space, and the stabbing pain in everyone’s eyes made them close their eyes.

For a second, there was only this sword qi in the entire universe.

Weng!

The warfan exploded as its many sword bones separated. All one hundred sword bones turned into one hundred warfans, slashing towards Huang Xiaolong at unpredictable speed. Even the Heavenly Saint Ruler failed to react in time.

Seeing this, the Heavenly Terror Ruler quickly ushered the experts with him to dodge far away.

Looking the storm of warfans coming at him, Huang Xiaolong snickered softly. He didn’t make any big movements but everyone saw a small chaos axe suddenly appear, chopping down mightily.

The crowd was absolutely shocked.

But, exactly at this point, the hundreds of warfans turned into thousands of sword qi resembling thousands of agile snakes. They twisted around and continued falling down on Huang Xiaolong.

The sudden change did not make Huang Xiaolong dodge or retreat. Bright rays burst out of his body, repelling the thousands of sword qi falling on him.

The sword qi that was repelled reverted back to its original shape, and returned to the Sword Race Patriarch Jian Qintian’s back.

The result astounded everyone that no one dared to make any noise.

The warfan hummed incessantly on the Sword Race Patriarch’s back, whereas Jian Qintian’s face sank. Clearly, Huang Xiaolong’s strength had greatly exceeded his estimation. That attack just now could have killed any average early Tenth Order Sovereign yet Huang Xiaolong parried it easily.

Not only the Sword Race Patriarch Jian Qintian, but also the Giant Kun Ruler, and 33 Heavens Race’s experts were looking at Huang Xiaolong in surprise.

“The heaven beyond heavens’ lightning qi has stabilized!”

Someone suddenly shouted, immediately attracting everyone’s attention. The heaven beyond heavens space that was originally filled with angry lightning had dispersed by half.

“Go!” The Giant Kun Ruler ordered upon seeing this, he swiftly tore the barrier towards the heaven beyond heavens space and led a group of experts in.

The Heavenly Terror Ruler Dong Cheng sneered at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, consider yourself lucky this time! If you run into me again, I’ll definitely kill you!” After throwing a few harsh words at Huang Xiaolong, Dong Cheng also led the Heavenly Terror Country’s experts into the heaven beyond heavens space.

The 33 Heavens Race, Sword Race, and other forces also rushed in as fast as they could.
