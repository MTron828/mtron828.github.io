In an instant, several million gazes landed on Huang Xiaolong.

There were ancestors from various superpowers who set their sights on Huang Xiaolong, and there were also sect masters and young sect masters, who stared at Huang Xiaolong.

With an indifferent expression, Huang Xiaolong ignored them and made his way towards an open spot.

The venue of the battle was a massive plaza. There were many zones in the plaza, and the Fortune Emperor Palace was allocated to the sixty-first zone, based on their ranking.

Huang Xiaolong and the others quickly made their way there.

“Uncle!”

When they arrived at the spot allocated to the Silver Fox Commerce, Bei Xiaomei waved and called Huang Xiaolong out.

Huang Xiaolong simply turned to her and nodded his head.

Since the Silver Fox Commerce’s members had left ahead of them, Bei Xiaomei and Elder Fu were already there when Huang Xiaolong arrived.

“Young Master Huang!”

When they passed by the Martial Demon Emperor Palace and Magic Shaman Emperor Palace, Mo Xiao and Peng Yi yelled out respectfully.

Huang Xiaolong turned to them and cupped his fists in greetings. That wasn’t a time to reminisce about the past events, and Huang Xiaolong continued on his way to the sixty-first zone.

When Huang Xiaolong and the others arrived, the expressions of Zhao Lei and the rest turned gloomy.

The members of the Solitude Emperor Palace were there, and they had taken up every available spot!

A frosty light flashed through Huang Xiaolong’s eyes, but his usual indifference returned in an instant. He walked towards them.

Everyone around them was waiting for the good show to start.

“Gudu Wuyi, what’s the meaning of this?” Zhao Lei glared at them and questioned the moment he arrived.

Gudu Wuyi simply laughed it off, “It’s nothing. Anyway, the sixty-first zone belongs to us, the Solitude Emperor palace.”

Zhao Lei, Li Shan, and Fang Xuanxuan nearly raged.

It didn’t matter if the Solitude Emperor Palace took their manor; however, they had gone too far this time!

They went too far!

If that was the case, wouldn’t that mean that the Fortune Emperor Palace couldn’t participate in the battle? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Wouldn’t they be chased out of the venue?

Everyone surrounding them turned their gazes to the members of the Fortune Emperor Palace, and all of them were superpowers in their own right. Wouldn’t they turn into a laughingstock of the Divine World?!

The more they thought about it, the angrier they became.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across and looked at the heavenly troops who turned a blind eye to the matter.

A cold sneer formed on Huang Xiaolong’s lips.

“Didn’t you hear? The sixty-first zone belongs to our Solitude Emperor Palace! You guys should get lost right now!” Gudu Canyang sneered.

Zhao Lei could no longer hold himself back, and he snapped. “F*ck your mother! You guys should be the ones leaving! Do you think that I won’t smash your b*lls right now?!”

Everyone stared at Zhao Lei in shock.

Gudu Canyang’s eyes turned red, and it seemed as though he was about to spit out fire.

“Zhao Lei, you’re talking big for a weakling of your caliber.” Gudu Wuyi laughed. “If you dare to make a move, I’ll kill you right here and now. Don’t think that I won’t dare to do anything in the competition arena!”

Gudu Wuyi was an early-Ninth Order Emperor Realm expert. Zhao Lei wasn’t even in the mid-stages of the Emperor Realm, and if Gudu Wuyi really wanted to deal with Zhao Lei, it was more than possible.

Zhao Lei fumed, and smoke nearly emerged from the top of his head.

Before Zhao Lei and Li Shan could continue, Huang Xiaolong appeared before them and stared at Gudu Wuyi coldly. Gudu Wuyi, I’ll give you three seconds to disappear from my sight. Otherwise, I’ll smash all your b*lls right here and now.”

Huang Xiaolong simply couldn’t be bothered to fight with them over a single manor.

In fact, Huang Xiaolong wasn’t afraid of anyone in the Divine World.

When everyone heard what he said, fervent discussions broke out.

“Huang Xiaolong is really as reckless as the rumors made him out to be. He dares to threaten Gudu Wuyi... Who does he think he is? Gudu Wuyi is an Emperor, while he is a mere disciple of the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

“He’s a retard, alright. He’s lucky to have the Silver Fox Commerce behind him. Without them, all the princes in the Heavenly Court would have probably killed him already. How can he stand here and bark like the dog he is?”

It was a unanimous decision to mock Huang Xiaolong, and not a single person spoke up for him.

Gudu Wuyi’s face darkened, and killing intent rolled off him in waves. He looked towards the Brightness Emperor Palace, and he saw the ancestor leading them nod at him slightly.

“Huang Xiaolong, there is no need to give me three seconds! I will cripple you right now!” Gudu Wuyi turned and sent his fist flying towards Huang Xiaolong in the next instant.

The moment Gudu Wuyi made his move, the entire plaza shook. The might of a Ninth Order Emperor shocked the world.

“It’s the Solitude Emperor Palace’s special move, the Nine Stars Emperor Fist!”

Cheers filled the plaza.

Before anyone could react, a massive figure appeared behind Gudu Wuyi. It was the phantom of an emperor, and nine stars materialized behind him.

“With Gudu Wuyi going all out, even Zhao Lei and Li Shan combined wouldn’t be his opponents. I want to see who can save Huang Xiaolong now!” The Azure Dragon Emperor, Chen Jianwei, laughed as he watched the amazing performance before him.

Seeing as Gudu Wuyi’s fists were about to land on Huang Xiaolong, a massive palm appeared in the sky. The palm was created from darkness, and it emitted a terrifying aura that seemed unsurmountable. It welcomed Gudu Wuyi’s Nine Stars Emperor Fist.

In an instant, the phantom of the emperor and the nine stars exploded.

As the palm connected with Gudu Wuyi after smashing his skill apart, the mighty Gudu Wuyi was sent flying.

As he knocked into the disciples behind him, all of them were sent flying like pins in a bowling alley.

Everyone stared at the scene with their mouths agape.

Even Chen Jianwei felt his jaws dropping to the ground, much less the members of the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace behind him.

The Fiend God Emperor Palace and the Brightness Emperor Palace were no exception as shock gripped their heart.

Elder Fu of the Silver Fox Commerce stared in dumbfounded silence, and Mo Xiao mirrored his actions.

“Father!” Gudu Canyang lunged forward and grabbed Gudu Wuyi’s body.

Gudu Canyang’s yell seemed to pull everyone back to reality.

“What happened just now?!”

Many experts looked at each other with a terrified look in their eyes as they had no idea what had happened. Only stronger Emperors like Elder Fu and Mo Xiao had managed to catch a glimpse of the palm.

They turned towards the source of the darkness palm, and their eyes landed on the beast behind Huang Xiaolong.

The expert who had made a move to stop Gudu Wuyi was precisely one of the four odd beasts!

The Tenth Order Emperor Realm experts from the Grandmist Emperor Palace, Fiend God Emperor Palace, Brightness Emperor Palace, and other superpowers felt their eyes light up.
