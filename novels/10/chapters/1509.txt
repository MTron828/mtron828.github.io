Huang Xiaolong laughed listening to the little cow, and said, “Wait till we’re at the Floating Twilight Land, I will break through to the Fourth Order God King Realm soon enough.”

As long as he finds the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele in the Floating Twilight Land, he would be able to break through to Fourth Order God King Realm in one attempt!

The little cow blanked for a second, then responded with a chuckle, “I say, you brat, do you think the Blood Eye Devil Stele is so easy to find in the Floating Twilight Land?”

Noticing the little cow was slightly gloating about his incoming frustrations, Huang Xiaolong snorted, “In the past, hadn’t you also said that I wouldn’t find the grandmist aura?”

The little cow dazed, then her shoulders slumped with dejection. She had no words to retort to Huang Xiaolong.

It was as Huang Xiaolong had said, he had indeed found the grandmist aura that no one had been able to find in billions of years. What could be harder than finding the grandmist aura? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Moreover, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t simply found the grandmist aura, but what he had found was the purple grandmist aura!

Speaking of the grandmist aura, Huang Xiaolong was ready to leave. He had gotten the Tianwu Treasure and successfully advanced to the God King Realm; next on his agenda was searching for the grandmist aura.

Just as Huang Xiaolong pondered where he should start looking for the grandmist aura, his communication talisman quivered. He took it out and saw it was a message from his Master Zhao Lei.

Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense swept over the communication talisman in his hand and he was astounded. “The Heavenly Court issued a public announcement, the Battle of the Heavenly Court will be held ahead of the originally scheduled time!”

The message from Zhao Lei contained information about the Heavenly Court’s announcement related to the Battle of the Heavenly Court. According to Zhao Lei’s message, the Heavenly Court had suddenly issued an official announcement to all the Divine World’s Emperor Palaces that the Heavenly Court was bringing forward the Battle of the Heavenly Court and it would be held in a hundred years!

In a hundred years! Huang Xiaolong was genuinely astonished.

So fast! From the rumors he had heard earlier, even if the Battle of the Heavenly Court would be preponed, it was still after a thousand years, wasn’t it? Yet, the Battle of the Heavenly Court was actually going to be held in a hundred years!

“What?” The little cow saw the strangeness in Huang Xiaolong’s expression and asked.

Huang Xiaolong passed the communication talisman to her. The little cow took it and was just as astonished after she read the message within the talisman using his divine sense.

“What are your thoughts on this?” Huang Xiaolong asked the little cow.

The little cow contemplated for a moment, then said, “There must be reasons why the Heavenly Court would hold the Battle of the Heavenly Court so soon, perhaps, it’s related to the catastrophe the Divine World is about to face.”

“The Divine World’s catastrophe...” Huang Xiaolong’s brows creased into deep furrows.

“Looks like there is another bloodbath coming.” The little cow sighed. “More than a hundred world surfaces were devastated in the last Divine World’s catastrophe. What is going to be damaged this time? However, I’m afraid the losses this time would be worse than the last catastrophe, some Emperor Palaces might not survive.” There was heavy worry in her voice.

In the next sentence, the little cow’s tone took a turn as she said to Huang Xiaolong, “The most essential thing right now is to still improve our own strength, and we’ll see what happens after the Battle of the Heavenly Court.”

“The Battle of the Heavenly Court is really so important?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow was stupefied by his question for a moment. She then answered with an eye roll, “Duh, if it’s not important, why would all the Emperor Palaces scramble to send their disciples to participate and get a good ranking in it? Firstly, there are the shocking lucrative prizes, and most importantly, it is the special treatment for the top one thousand disciples in the Battle of the Heavenly Court. That is enough to make the Divine World’s genius disciples strive to fight with fists and legs for a good ranking!”

“Oh, special treatment?” Huang Xiaolong repeated with interest.

The little cow nodded, “Disciples who enter the top one thousand rankings in the Battle of the Heavenly Court can enjoy treatment equivalent to a Heavenly Court’s heavenly general. The top ten disciples, they can especially enjoy the same benefits of a heavenly marshal, and the champion can enter and cultivate inside the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool.”

“The Heavenly Court’s lightning pool?” Huang Xiaolong’s interest deepened.

As if knowing what Huang Xiaolong was thinking, the little cow went on, “There is a high possibility that the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool is one of the nine chaos lightning pools, no, actually, two of the chaos lightning pools!”

Huang Xiaolong raised an eyebrow at the little cow, waiting for her to go on.

“Although I have never been to the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool, I have heard that the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool contains chaos lightning energy of yin and yang, a combination of water and fire. So, I suspect it is the combined form of the water lightning pool and fire lightning pool!”

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to calm his accelerated heartbeat. The combination of the two out of the nine chaos lightning pools—water lightning pool and fire lightning pool!

“Why haven’t I heard you mention this before?” Huang Xiaolong couldn’t help asking the little cow.

The little cow rolled her eyes at him, “I don’t need to tell you everything, okay? Moreover, it is only my guess that the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool is the combination of the water and fire lightning pools. So, I’m not certain if that is true.”

Huang Xiaolong was extremely speechless.

However, since the little cow had dared to make such a guess, then, the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool was very likely the combination of two chaos lightning pools!

To Huang Xiaolong, this was wonderful news!

The more chaos lightning pools he could gather, the stronger would be the lightning pools’ power, thus the more beneficial it would be for his cultivation. At this point, he had learned that there was one chaos lightning pool sealed in the Lord of Hell’s heritage land, and counting the Heavenly Court’s chaos lightning pools, there were already four!

Four!

With the four chaos lightning pools merged together, to what extent would the power be multiplied?

Looks like participating in the Battle of the Heavenly Court was now a must. However, only the champion could cultivate in the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool. This first place was no easy feat. Huang Xiaolong had no confidence to say he was certain to win the first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court that was just around the corner in a hundred years.

Based on his current strength, forget first place, he probably won’t even get into the top ten thousand rankings.

So, he needed to cultivate diligently in this one hundred years to further raise his strength.

“You’ve got quite the big appetite, as you have the guts to covet the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool.” The little cow could tell what Huang Xiaolong was thinking just by the expression on his face. She chuckled, “But the Heavenly Court’s lightning pool is not easy to take away ah. Not even a high-level Emperor Realm master could take it away even if he wanted to. Not to mention, even if you really succeeded in doing that, Heavenly Emperor that kid will surely find out immediately. One order from him, and there won’t be a place that could keep you safe from him.”

Huang Xiaolong stilled, he had not considered this problem when he was thinking of taking the Heavenly Court’s chaos lightning pool.

However, in the next second, Huang Xiaolong stopped entangling himself with the problem. Thinking too much about it was useless. He could think about this problem after getting first place in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

“Are you planning to return to the Fortune Emperor Palace now or to the Floating Twilight Land to look for the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele?” The little cow inquired.

Zhao Lei had mentioned in his message that after the Heavenly Court’s announcement, the Fortune Emperor Palace would hold a disciples’ selection competition. As long as they had an outstanding performance in this selection competition and they could enter in the top one thousand rankings, they would qualify to represent the Fortune Emperor Palace to participate in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

Irrespective of the disciple’s Master, if the disciple failed to participate in the selection competition, the disciple won’t qualify to represent the Fortune Emperor Palace in the Battle of the Heavenly Court.

Therefore, Huang Xiaolong needed to return to the Fortune Emperor Palace as soon as possible, if he wanted to participate in the selection competition.

“Let’s go to the Floating Twilight Land.” Huang Xiaolong pondered for a while then answered.

There were still ten years until the Fortune Emperor Palace’s selection competition, Huang Xiaolong hoped he could find the second half of the Blood Eye Devil Stele, refine it, and absorb the darkness element energy from it to break through to the Fourth Order God King Realm. This way, he would have a better grasp to enter the top one thousand rankings in the selection competition.
