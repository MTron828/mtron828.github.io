Chapter 495: Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique!

“It’s the Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique!”

“The Green Devil Patriarch actually succeeded in cultivating this technique!”

The surrounding experts paled at the sight of this, including Patriarch Chuck and Ao Kun.

Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique! This was the Green Devil Tribe’s top most unique skill, also the pinnacle of poison skills in the whole Martial Spirit World!

Success in cultivating this skill allowed a person to transform their whole body into poisonous liquid of extreme toxicity. The slightest contact with this poisonous liquid would corrode a peak late-Tenth Order Saint realm expert’s body into nothing! Furthermore, after turning into a liquid existence, the cultivator wasn’t subjected to any damage from physical attacks such as fists or palms, nor could any godly weapons kill them.

It was close to being invincible!

It was said that, during the ancient times, the Beast God battled for one day and one night with the Green Devil Tribe’s ancestor who succeeded in cultivating this Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique. In the end, due to battle qi exhaustion, the Green Devil Tribe’s Patriarch was unable to maintain his liquid form and was forced to revert to his original body, which enabled the first Beast God to defeat him.

However, in the following thousands of years, ever since the Green Devil Tribe’s first Patriarch succeeded in cultivating this Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique, there had been no other Green Devil Tribe patriarch that was able to do so.

No one thought that Mai Xiu would be able to do so!

After tens of thousands of years, the Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique once again resurfaced!

“Liege Lord Beast God, be careful!” Ao Kun shouted a warning.

At this point, the pool of liquid that Mai Xiu turned into was trying to wind itself around Huang Xiaolong. Wherever the poison liquid traveled, the space itself actually sizzled with green fumes—this poison could even corrode space! The toxicity was beyond anyone’s imagination.

Just as everyone was watching with bated breaths as the green poison liquid was closing in on Huang Xiaolong, mere millimeters from his body, he raised a palm and gently waved forward.

“God Binding Palm!” Multiple golden rings expanded out from Huang Xiaolong’s palm, halting the poison liquid’s movement. It was pinned in place in midair. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Next, a soft kindle of true essence fire danced in his palm before it flew out, stretching into a thin film of flames as it wrapped itself around the pool of floating poisonous liquid.

“Hahaha, Huang Xiaolong, you think this measly fire of yours can harm me?” A triumphant laughter came from the pool of poison liquid that is Mai Xiu, “I’ve been enduring ever since I’ve successfully cultivated the Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique, all of it just for today!”

“I am the real number one expert on Ten Directions Continent!”

“After I kill you, I’ll get the Beast God Scepter and fuse with the Beast God power, then I can be unrivaled under the Heavens!”

Mai Xiu’s words reverberated in all corners of the square.

Huang Xiaolong flashed a satirical sneer as he watched the true essence fire finally wrap up the pool of poison liquid.

Mai Xiu’s triumphant laughter stopped abruptly, choking in his throat as if he had just seen the most terrifying thing.

“No, no-not possible! What f*cking thing is this! How is this possible?!” His horrified shrieks rang sharp, continuing for some time.

This inexplicable turn of events baffled everyone present as they watched in astonishment the scene in front of them.

Wrapped in a layer of flames, the pool of poison that was Mai Xiu began to struggle violently as muffled pops sounded again and again. Strands of green energy mist evaporated, dispersing in the air.

The pool of green poisonous liquid continued to shrink in size, accompanied by Mai Xiu’s non-stop howling of pain, raising goosebumps down the experts’ backs hearing it.

“Huang Xiaolong, I, I beg you, spare me, my Green Devil Tribe is willing to submit to you!” Mai Xiu begged for mercy in between anguish howls of pain.

Huang Xiaolong was not moved. Ignoring Mai Xiu’s pleadings, he increased the energy channeled into the true essence fire from his dantian. True essence flames danced merrily as they continued to tease at the pool of poisonous liquid.

“Don’t kill me!” Mai Xiu wailed.

“Patriarch!” The Green Devil Tribe’s experts were looking pale and anxious like ants on a hot pan, but just as they took one step forward, Ao Kun and a group of beastmen and demonic beast experts forced them to retreat.

“Why aren’t you all attacking!” Mai Xiu shouted at the other patriarchs, “Everyone attack together, kill Huang Xiaolong and you’ll have a ray of hope, otherwise, no one can escape if Huang Xiaolong kills us off one by one!”

The shocked patriarchs woke up from their shock at Mai Xiu’s reminder. Each of them drew their weapons resolutely, displaying their most powerful move in attacking Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong remained unperturbed and did not dodge as he watched forty-four Saint realm patriarchs gang up on him at once, and he continued to rotate the energy from his dantian at an even faster speed.

In that short window of time, the forty-four patriarchs’ attacks were about to hit Huang Xiaolong.

A myriad of shadows of swords, sabers, fists, and palms struck Huang Xiaolong.

Zheng! Sharp clankings rippled in the air. Those sword and saber attacks sounded like they struck against the most adamant divine steel, issuing crisp echoes of collision with random fire sparks bursting here and there.

Then, in the eyes of the spectating crowd some distance away, those forty-four patriarchs were sent back flying. The weapons in their hands were knocked off, either flung high into the sky or stabbed into the ground. Some even flew into the crowd.

Poof! The weaker patriarchs vomited blood when they crashed to the ground.

The entire time, Huang Xiaolong stood on the same spot, unmoving. On his exposed skin, there was nothing more other than several white marks. They didn’t even pierce through his skin!

The experts’ mouths dried up, feeling as if their larynges were stuck to the roof of their mouths. Calm as they were, the shock was evident in these people’s eyes.

‘Is this still...human?’

To withstand a few dozen high-level Saint realm experts’ most powerful attacks at the same time, yet remain unharmed...!

Not to mention, they didn’t even draw a drop of blood out of Huang Xiaolong!

Huang Xiaolong did not show the slightest emotion as his right hand made a gripping motion, and Mai Xiu’s blood-curdling scream shook the square. When the screams stopped, the true essence fire had evaporated every last drop of the green poisonous liquid.

That year when Huang Xiaolong broke through to Saint realm, his true essence fire became powerful enough to incinerate even Poison Corpse Scarabs. Through the years, his true essence fire had evolved and enhanced many times over, and despite the extreme toxicity of the Green Devil Nefarious Poison Liquefying Technique, it still couldn’t withstand the burning from Huang Xiaolong’s true essence fire.

Having dealt with the Green Devil Tribe Patriarch, Huang Xiaolong’s next target was the Skeleton Tribe Patriarch. This time, he had to kill a few people to create deterrence. And these several people were none other than those that were in collusion with Deities Templar, Cosmos God Cult, and Sin City to induce other tribes and clan patriarchs to besiege him; a total of nine people, including Sea Emperor Vander and Green Devil Tribe Patriarch Mai Xiu.

Hence, regardless of how desperately the Green Devil Tribe’s Patriarch begged, he was destined to die!

The Skeleton Tribe Patriarch turned deathly pale watching Huang Xiaolong draw closer to him step by step. After subconsciously retreating a step, he suddenly lunged forward.

“Devil Burial Tomb!”

Surging death aura gushed out from the Skeleton Patriarch, transforming into an enormous coffin behind him that shot forward, slamming into Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong snorted with disdain as a thousand arms fanned out like a peacock’s tail from his back.

“Great Void Divine Fist!”

One thousand arms! One thousand Great Void Divine Fists!

Rumble~~!

A thunderous boom sent violent quakes through the square.

The enormous coffin was like a bubble pulled into a hurricane, exploding in an instant. The thousand Great Void Divine Fists pummeled onto the Skeleton Tribe Patriarch, blasting him into pieces.

With a wave of his hand, Huang Xiaolong gathered those flying blood and flesh pieces, and even the soul, sending them into the Linglong Treasure Pagoda to be swallowed by the Poison Corpse Scarabs and Devils and Ghosts Flag.

Subsequently, Huang Xiaolong picked off the remaining six one by one using only one move. When all was done, Huang Xiaolong walked toward Sea Emperor Vander, who was lying at the edge of the square. Earlier, although Huang Xiaolong had shattered his Sea God Protection barrier, he had yet to kill him. He merely left him unconscious.

Coming to a stop beside Sea Emperor Vander, Huang Xiaolong aimed a finger between his brows. The force pierced a finger-sized hole through Vander’s forehead, instantly waking the unconscious man. Seeing Huang Xiaolong the moment he opened his eyes, there was fury and fear in his eyes, but despite that, Vander still threatened with false bravado: “Huang Xiaolong, us forty-six patriarchs joining hands will definitely kill you!”

Immediately after his roar, he felt that the atmosphere around him was a little odd. His eyes rolled around to survey the surroundings and what he saw left him in a daze. Lying scattered on the ground, just like him, were the other patriarchs, each in a unique posture. Only, not even one of them was actually standing.

Sea Emperor Vander’s mouth opened and closed, but no words would come, as if there was something stuck in his throat.
