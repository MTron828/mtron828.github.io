Chapter 2933: Sun Moon Pill Furnace

Even though there was only a large pill furnace in the entire place, Huang Xiaolong could sense more than twenty hidden experts hiding around the area!

To be specific, there were twenty-six of them in the Dao Venerable Realm!

These twenty-six Dao Venerables had evidently used some formidable cosmos artifact to hide their auras before merging with the space around them. Even a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable wouldn’t be able to sense them.

Huang Xiaolong sneered inwardly. It was too bad that their target was him!

These twenty-six Dao Venerables were obviously from the Mystical Pavilion, and the reason they were there was obvious. Once he succeeded in refining the pill, Zeng Lei would take him down immediately.

Amongst the twenty-six experts, four of them were Sixth Esteem Dao Venerables, fourteen were Fifth Esteem Dao Venerables, while the rest were Fourth Esteem Dao Venerables.

Adding on Zeng Lei, who was a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable, the group was a force to be reckoned with! It was more than enough to sweep away every Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable who came knocking!

If he hadn’t broken through to the Dao Venerable Realm, and if he hadn’t obtained the Huang Long Armor, he might truly be in danger.

Too bad for them, he had already done both those things.

In fact, he had his reasons for helping Zeng Lei. After all, the man was willing to pay him thirty strands of beginning qi! From the looks of it, there was no way he was there to refine an ancient grand dao pill. No grand dao pill was worth so much.

Moreover, there was no way someone required both the power of absolute blaze and the nirvana flame to refine a mere grand dao pill. The pill Zeng Lei wanted to refine was definitely a genesis-level pill!

Genesis pill!

Even though genesis level dao pills were incomparable to a strand of genesis qi, it was much better than beginning qi. It was still much better than absolute origin qi! It was a rare cultivation treasure even for Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables. A single genesis pill was more than enough to last an expert of that level millions of years!

Imagine a furnace that made genesis level dao pills!

Huang Xiaolong’s heart started beating faster and faster.

Currently, he was a peak mid-First Esteem Dao Venerable. With a whole furnace of genesis level pills, he would be able to break through to the peak-late First Esteem Dao Venerable Realm! In fact, he had a chance to progress to the Second Esteem Dao Venerable Realm!

Items in the genesis level could be said to be going against the heavens. The ingredients used for genesis pills were precious beyond belief, and there were more than a hundred different types!

A single herb of that level was priceless, much less so many of them!

That was also the reason a genesis-level pill was way better than a strand of beginning qi. The value of a furnace of genesis-level pills was astronomical.

Zeng Lei then pointed to a furnace and smiled, “Young Master Huang, this furnace was used by the Sun and Moon Creed. We obtained it after expending a lot of effort, and we shall be using the Sun Moon Furnace this time!”

Huang Xiaolong was taken aback, “Isn’t the Sun and Moon Pill Furnace said to be able to refine everything in the world?!”

The Sun and Moon Creed was a peak level power in the Divine Tuo Holy World. Back when they were at their peak, they were no weaker than the Dragon Fish Creed!

They were known as the number one pill refining sect in the Divine Tuo Holy World. Back then, there was a saying that went, “The master of the Sun and Moon is the Supreme Pill Cultivator!”

Legend had it that more than half the grand dao pills that were produced in the past came from the Sun and Moon Creed.

As the sect defining treasure of the Sun and Moon Creed, the furnace was a high-level cosmos artifact! It was close to the peak level.

In the past, the Sun and Moon Creed had refined a furnace of genesis-level pills and drawn the attention of many experts. Those who lusted over the pills had formed an alliance and wiped the Sun and Moon Furnace off the face of existence!

When the furnace had gone missing back then, no one knew who obtained it! Who would have thought that it would be in Zeng Lei’s hands?

Seeing Huang Xiaolong’s shocked face, Zeng Lei laughed, “That’s right, the Sun and Moon Pill Furnace!” Originally he wouldn't have shown such a treasure to others so easily. For the sake of refining genesis-level pills, he could only use the pill furnace. After all, the better the quality of the furnace, the higher the possibility of creating the pills was.

He couldn’t afford a single mistake!

Of course, since he dared to show Huang Xiaolong the Sun Moon Furnace, he planned to kill the man after the deed was done.

Huang Xiaolong stood before the furnace, and he saw the etchings on the surface of the furnace.

Even though it wasn’t activated, he could feel the hidden power pulsating through the artifact.

“Good furnace!” Huang Xiaolong praised inwardly.

He was lacking a good pill furnace, and who would have thought that Zeng Lei would send one his way!

That was a windfall for him.

“Young Master Huang, if everything is ready, shall we start the refinement now?” Seeing Huang Xiaolong staring at the Sun Moon Furnace, Zeng Lei couldn’t help but sneer inwardly.

“Alright!” Huang Xiaolong nodded his head as a warm smile appeared on his face.

Following which, Zeng Lei took out the materials for refining the pills.

“Nine Heaven Silver Water!”

“Empty Ferry Grass!”

Genesis level herbs were placed before Huang Xiaolong one after another. Huang Xiaolong narrowed his eyes as he knew that he was right. Zeng Lei was definitely planning to refine genesis-level pill!

Exactly one hundred and eight herbs were placed before him.

After an hour, Huang Xiaolong activated the Sun Moon Furnace, causing the skies to change color. With the power of absolute blaze and the nirvana flame, phantom suns and moons appeared above him. The sun blazed on as a silvery glow covered the lands.

When Huang Xiaolong was starting to refine the pills, Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin returned to the Dragon Fish Creed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

When the upper echelons saw the state they were in, their expressions changed greatly. Even Bi Cheng, who could remain calm if the world collapsed, frowned.

“What’s going on?!” The person who spoke was Li Xue, the grand hall master of the Dragon Fish Creed.

When Li Xue saw her beloved disciple beaten up so badly, her charming smile disappeared, and her expression turned dark.

“Huang Xiaolong! Huang Xiaolong did this to us! Master, please avenge us!”
