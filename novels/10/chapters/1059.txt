Huang Xiaolong’s main purpose in entering the Barbarian God Sect was the All-Islands Great War, to reach the Fortune Mainland. He had never thought of reigning in the three most prominent sects on Green Cloud Island.

Would merging the Barbarian God Sect, Great Whale Sect, and Elephant Genesis Sect really be that easy? At the very least, his cultivation needed to reach the Ancient God Realm as deterrence.

Between the pages of the book was a map indicating the location of the mountain range where the Devil Restraining Sect’s headquarters on the Primal Chaos Mainland used to be. There was also a mark indicating the sect’s hidden treasury.

According to the words written by the three sects’ founders, the Devil Restraining Sect was one of the prominent first ranked forces of the Primal Chaos Mainland, with a heritage older than a hundred million years.

There were four enemy sects that allied to destroy the Devil Restraining Sect that year, the Dragon Tiger Gate, Devil Wind Sect, Ice Fiend Palace, and the Mirage Sword Sect.

Although the power of those four enemy sects wasn’t mentioned, it wasn’t hard to imagine. One point was certain, those four sects stood much higher in hierarchy compared to the current Barbarian God Sect, Great Whale Sect, and Elephant Genesis Sect combined.

Huang Xiaolong shook his head, thinking of the Devil Restraining Sect’s jade token.

He had been selected by the three sects’ founders as the keeper of the Devil Restraining Tablet and jade token. In other words, he was the future Devil Restraining Sect’s Chief.

Once his cultivation broke through to the Ancient God Realm, he would be able to fully refine the Devil Restraining Tablet as well as the jade token, solidifying his Sect Chief identity. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Sigh, forget it, let’s focus on the All-Islands Great War first.” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. First came the Fortune Mainland, then breaking into the Ancient God Realm. Only then would he take a look at the Primal Chaos Mainland.

Huang Xiaolong put the jade box, jade ring, map and everything else away.

At this time, a dazzling light flashed and the world turned upside down. In the next second, Huang Xiaolong appeared in the first hall where Lu Zhuo, Ren Changhai, and Zhu Huan were waiting.

Lu Zhuo smiled sweetly looking at Huang Xiaolong, sending a cold shiver down his spine.

The moment Huang Xiaolong appeared, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s eyes nearly exploded in fury, glaring at him as if their gazes could shred him to pieces. Their reactions baffled Huang Xiaolong, even if he successfully comprehended all the heritage tablets, was it necessary to direct such intense hatred at him?

Soon, Zhao Wuya, Deng Wei, and the rest were also sent out from their respective rooms.

Zhao Wuya spotted Huang Xiaolong almost immediately. He flashed a friendly smile at Huang Xiaolong, asking, “Huang Xiaolong, how many heritage tablets did you manage to comprehend? I was lucky enough to complete sixty-three!” His voice was filled with obvious complacence.

“Sixty-three tablets!” Deng Wei and the other eight disciples blurted out in shock, looking at Zhao Wuya.

According to their knowledge, in the last ten million years, the record was sixty-seven, yet Zhao Wuya actually managed to comprehend sixty-three heritage tablets! When this message spread out, it would definitely cause a commotion.

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s faces twitched seeing Zhao Wuya intentionally showing off in front of Huang Xiaolong. This seemed to be happening quite a lot as of late.

Huang Xiaolong glanced at Zhao Wuya from the corner of his eye and looked away, too lazy to bother with him.

Seeing that Huang Xiaolong did not answer him, Zhao Wuya’s first thought was that his performance was too mediocre to mention. Just as he was about to say something, Ren Changhai cut in with a cold harrumph, “Huang Xiaolong, since you’ve comprehended all one hundred heritage tablet, you must have opened that steel door at the end of the room.”

Zhao Wuya was instantly dumbfounded, his mouth agape with shock and disbelief.

One hundred heritage tablets!

Deng Wei and the other disciples had a similar expression.

“What is behind the steel door?” While Zhao Wuya, Deng Wei, and the others were still in shock, Zhu Huan barked fiercely at Huang Xiaolong, giving the impression he would get rough if Huang Xiaolong refused to answer.

Lu Zhuo walked to Huang Xiaolong’s side, facing Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan with a meaningful grin, “Hehe, Huang Xiaolong is a disciple of my Barbarian God Sect, what lies behind the door isn’t something you two can question him about.”

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s faces sank hearing Lu Zhuo’s words.

“This Primordial Celestial Shrine was built by our three sects’ founders. As Ancestors of the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect, we naturally have the right to ask what is behind that door!” Ren Changhai twisted reason to his favor.

Lu Zhuo drawled lazily, “Since you two are dying to know, why don’t you go in and try comprehending the heritage tablets again? As long as you two can comprehend all the tablets inside, you will naturally know.”

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan were stupefied, they did not expect this from Lu Zhuo. Anger took over reason and they bellowed at the same time “You!”

Comprehending all the heritage tablets mainly relied on one’s own talent, and the level of their talents was fixed, even if they tried to comprehend these tablets a hundred times over, the result would be the same, regardless of their cultivation.

In the past, during their youth, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan both reached the sixty-third tablet.

“Xiaolong, let’s go.” Lu Zhuo said to Huang Xiaolong, smiling sweetly. He ignored Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan, turning around and leaving while humming a little tune.

Huang Xiaolong wondered if that tune was composed by Lu Zhuo himself or someone else, but Lu Zhuo’s humming was quite good.

A myriad of complex emotions roiled in Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s hearts, but it was mostly fury.

“Oh right, I nearly forgot to inform the both of you. In two months, I will be making a trip to your Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect. During these two months, please do not empty out your sects’ treasuries.” Lu Zhuo smiled, “The rebound from the blood oath is no laughing matter.”

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s faces were especially dark watching Lu Zhuo.

Still, neither of them made a move to stop his group, watching unwillingly as their figures vanished from sight.

Although the three of them were Ancient God Realm cultivators, Lu Zhuo’s strength was higher than theirs, which was also the reason why Ren Changhai and Lu Zhuo were slightly apprehensive facing him.

Ten days later, Lu Zhuo’s group of three arrived back at the Barbarian God Sect.

By this time, the news of Huang Xiaolong comprehending all the heritage tablets inside the Primordial Celestial Shrine spread faster than wildfire.

Of course, this sensational news also reached Chen Hao, Cao Yang, Zhuang Huan, and Huang Junfei.

“That punk is simply too monstrous! One hundred heritage tablets in a hundred days, is he still human?!” Cao Yang’s face warped with anger, “I heard the punk has already reached peak mid-Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm in a few short days!”

“Not to mention the rumors flying around saying that he got some chaos spiritual herbs from the behind the sealed door!” Zhuang Huan said with hostility, “I wonder if it’s true. If it is, it will be much harder for us to kill him later.”

Chen Hao breathed in deeply, “Don’t worry too much, I received a message saying that the Ancestor made a bet with the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect’s Ancestors. The other two Ancestors lost a grade four spiritual vein each and half of their sect’s treasury. I don’t doubt the fact that the two sects’ Ancestors want to kill Huang Xiaolong more than us.”

Hearing this, everyone in the hall finally showed a trace of joy, “If both sects’ Ancestor are willing to take care of this, that Huang Xiaolong will certainly die!”

Back in the Barbarian God Sect, Huang Xiaolong did not return to his Mansion on the Stone Lion Peak. Instead, he entered the Barbarian God City and went to collect his core disciple robe.

Every core disciple of the Barbarian God Sect was entitled to a residence inside the Barbarian God City. After collecting the things he needed, he went back to his own cultivation dwelling.

Based on Huang Xiaolong’s talent, his residence was naturally located in an area filled with spiritual energy of the highest quality.

His new place was called Celestial Immortal Manor. The two words exuded an aura of vicissitude, ancient and domineering.
