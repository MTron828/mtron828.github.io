Chapter 3685: Finding Zhu Chen

There might be an endless number of evil devils, but they were up against the strongest power in the Unknown Space! The experts who arrived basically represented the apex of strength in the Unknown Space. No matter how many evil devils arrived, they were wiped out in the blink of an eye!

Naturally, there was no way they could advance faster than Huang Xiaolong when he came in previously. Huang Xiaolong charged in with the Universe Boat previously and his speed alone outclassed any one of them there! With their speed, the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death would need a year or two in order to arrive on the second level.

Half a year passed…

Huang Xiaolong arrived at the source of the disturbance on the Naihe Bridge.

When he saw what was there, he sucked in a cold breath.

There were countless Blood Tentacle Monsters and Poison Teeth Blood Monsters gathered together, and there were many other weird freaky creatures. There was an endless amount of them and they were comparable to the tide of evil devils outside.

These creatures were much stronger than evil devils and they were many times harder to kill!

Huang Xiaolong even noticed several giant creatures among them!

There was a Blood Tentacle Monster that was the size of a super mountain range standing in the middle of the cluster!

The Blood Tentacle Monsters that Huang Xiaolong met in the past were barely half a human tall. The one before him was millions of feet tall!

It was definitely a terrifying existence to say the least.

Of course, since there was a massive Blood Tentacle Monster, there had to be a similarly massive Poison Teeth Blood Monster.

Even if Huang Xiaolong used his butt to think, he would know that the two of them were the kings of the two creatures!

Every single creature on the Naihe Bridge had their own kings. The kings were the first creatures born when the Netherworld was created, and they were the most ancient of existences.

When the Green Ghost entered the Naihe Bridge in the past, even he was forced to retreat when he met them!

The creatures were far too strong. Their defensive and offensive capabilities far exceeded the Green Ghost’s expectations. If the eighteenth level of the Netherworld existed, they would never die!

Other than the two, there were the Black Locust King, Yin Yan King, and Golden Centipede King.

The five of them surrounded a youngster that Huang Xiaolong had never seen before.

Even though that was the case, Huang Xiaolong quickly recognized the man as the old ancestor of the Zhu Family, Zhu Chen!

Zhu Chen tried to break free from the encirclement, but no matter how hard he tried, he would be forced back into the circle.

The disturbance came from the battle between Zhu Chen and the five monsters!

Huang Xiaolong could see that it was the end of the line for Zhu Chen. With the strength of the five kings, Zhu Chen would never be able to escape. If he didn’t help the man, it was a matter of time before Zhu Chen turned into monster food.

“Golden Sun Circlet!”

Huang Xiaolong recognized the item at once. It was one of the thirteen universe treasures!

When they noticed Huang Xiaolong’s arrival, they were shocked.

Zhu Chen noticed the Star Dragon Divine Tree that Huang Xiaolong transformed into and a burning gaze appeared on his face. “Star Dragon Divine Tree!”

The five kings revealed similar expressions.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the greed in Zhu Chen’s face soon disappeared and he called out to Huang Xiaolong in excitement, “Fellow cultivator, please assist me! When we get out of here, I, Zhu Chen, will express my sincere gratitude!”

He knew that Huang Xiaolong had to be a powerful cultivator now that he made it all the way over to the end of the Naihe Bridge. With the Star Dragon Divine Tree, he felt that it was very possible for him to finally escape from the five monster kings!

“I can save you. But I want the Golden Sun Circlet!” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

Zhu Chen was shocked, but he soon roared in anger, “Are you crazy?!”

“If I refuse to do anything, do you think you will get the chance to emerge from the Netherworld? You’ll be turning into their food. When that happens, your treasure will end up with me.”

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t trying to scare Zhu Chen. It was true that he would die without Huang Xiaolong’s help. Next, he would deal with the five monster kings to retrieve the treasure.

With his expression sinking, Zhu Chen sneered, “Even if I die in their hands, do you think you can live?! Are you capable of escaping from all five of them?! You’ll be following me in death!”

Huang Xiaolong shrugged his shoulders and laughed, “Why would I need to escape?”

Zhu Chen was dumbfounded.

It was true. Huang Xiaolong never planned on escaping from the five of them. They would make excellent subordinates, and if Huang Xiaolong had to make a choice between the monster kings and Zhu Chen, he would choose them in a heartbeat.

Zhu Chen couldn’t help but frown in confusion when he heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Could the brat be planning to…

A terrifying thought flashed through his mind.

When he was still stuck in a state of confusion, Huang Xiaolong moved. His figure flashed and he appeared before the five monster kings. The Three Gods Halberd in his hand flew out along with the Reversal Sword. Terrifying waves of energy filled the space the weapons crossed.

Even though there wasn’t a proper sea in the Netherworld, there was an ocean of blood. The Three Gods Halberd had the ability to control any liquid, and it was easy to gain control of the blood ocean.

The Reversal Sword behaved the same. Countless monsters were sliced in half. The sword didn’t stop there as it flew towards the five kings.

Ignoring Zhu Chen completely, they started their assault on Huang Xiaolong. However, Huang Xiaolong was close to the 27 billion units mark and he was leagues ahead of Zhu Chen. With the Three Gods Halberd in hand, he sent all five of them flying at once.

Zhu Chen stared at him in shock.

Even if the Green Ghost came, he wouldn’t be able to do what Huang Xiaolong did!

Zhu Chen didn’t expect the youngster before him to be so damn strong!

He sneakily moved to the side as the battle raged on.

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong had his sights on Zhu Chen long before he engaged the five monster kings. A ray of sword light emerged and flew towards Zhu Chen without any warning. In a state of desperation, Zhu Chen raised the Golden Sun Circlets in his hand to block the strike.

A blast ensued as rays of light filled the space around them.

Zhu Chen felt a sharp pain shooting up his arms and he retreated in haste.

“You!” He glared at Huang Xiaolong with rage as he didn’t expect the man to move against him.

“Hand it over.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t plan to waste his time with Zhu Chen. After all, he knew what Zhu Chen was planning. He definitely wanted to escape when Huang Xiaolong was busy dealing with the five kings.
