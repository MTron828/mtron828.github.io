Chapter 2605: Zi Yutong

Killing intent burst out from Jin Kang’s body when he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s departing figure.

“Hall Master Jin, how dare that b*stard speak to you in that sort of tone? Why don’t we take him down right here before pinning some random crime on him?” One of the attendants behind Jin Kang spoke up.

The person who spoke was called Liu Jieyi, and he was someone from the Aliu Race. The Aliu race was one of the subordinate races loyal to the Golden Buddha Race, and it was no wonder he suggested something like that.

Jin Kang glanced at him from the corner of his eye, and he suppressed the killing intent in his heart. “There’s no need for that. Let him strut around for several more days. In the future, he will live a life worse than death!”

There were too many disciples in the hall right now, and it wasn’t a good time to lay his hands on Huang Xiaolong.

Even if he wanted to cripple the kid, he wouldn’t be able to answer to the higher-ups with so many witnesses.

Moreover, the Silver Purity Race was close to the Purple Spider Race. The power and influence of Yin Zhangguo and the mission hall wasn’t something he could ignore.

After Huang Xiaolong left the logistics hall, he headed straight to the Fallen Yang Peak.

The palaces on the Fallen Yang Peak were scattered all over the place, and a unique scene was painted. Other than the fact that the holy spiritual qi in the air was a little thinner than usual, the place was pretty good.

As soon as Huang Xiaolong arrived and spoke to the person in charge of the Fallen Yang Peak, Hu Wen, he received a warm welcome. Hu Wen wasn’t like Jin Kang who had a grudge with Huang Xiaolong. After all, the news of Huang Xiaolong’s talent had already spread through the entire Otherworldly Mansion. He quickly arranged for Huang Xiaolong to live in the best palace available in the Fallen Yang Peak.

When he arrived at his residence, Huang Xiaolong discovered that his residence was located at the peak of the mountain. A sea of clouds gathered under his feet and it felt like heaven on earth! Even though the courtyard he lived in was considerably small and housed only two rooms, it was enough for him.

Huang Xiaolong saw a decently sized platform outside his courtyard, and he looked at the sea of clouds tumbling under his feet as he stood at the edge of the platform.

As the golden rays of the setting sun illuminated the soft sea of clouds, a majestic scene was revealed.

Thoughts of the Huang Family flashed through his mind all of a sudden, and the figures of Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, and the other ladies appeared in his head.

In the past, he had felt that there was a possibility of him returning to the lower worlds after entering the True Saint Realm. However, he had learned from the Cangqiong Old Man that one couldn’t return to the lower worlds even if they became a high-level Primal Ancestor!

That was the source of Huang Xiaolong’s worries.

As such, he could only wait for members of the Huang Family to ascend.

“I guess it’s time for me to challenge the Dao Gate!” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

His plan was to succeed in the challenge before obtaining the approval of more than ten royal families. After that, he would challenge the others for a spot as the next Mansion Master.

His status would shoot up into the skies as soon as he became a candidate to challenge the spot of the Mansion Master, and it would be way more effective when compared to his identity as the young master of the Purple Spider Race. After he became a Mansion Master Candidate, even people like Jin Kang would have to bow respectfully before him.

In the past, the Otherworldly Mansion had only accepted disciples every hundred years. As such, the Dao Gate would only open every one hundred years. However, now that they changed their rule, the Dao Gate opened once every ten years.

There was only a year till the next opening of the Dao Gate!

However, not every disciple would be able to enter the Dao Gate the moment it opened. Only disciples who were under the age of a hundred thousand years would be eligible for entry. Moreover, there was only a single slot every time the Dao Gate opened!

As such, everyone would have to risk everything in order to fight for the spot.

The rules changed every time the Dao Gate opened.

However, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he would be able to obtain the slot no matter what rules were implemented.

“I wonder, how are they doing in the Holy World?” Huang Xiaolong muttered softly. Since the great war between the two worlds was about to begin, they were making preparations for the battle.

Huang Xiaolong had already explained the incident that had happened in the ancient battlefield. Since the connection between the Holy World and the Alien Lands was severed, no one knew about his situation in the Alien Lands. As such, he could use his name however he wished.

Of course, he wasn’t afraid that the members of the Otherworldly Mansion would have gained some intelligence of the matters over on the Holy World’s side. After all, the Holy World had already stationed a massive army around the ancient battlefield and there were countless restrictions stopping any attempts to gather intelligence.

As night fell, Yin Zhangguo appeared on the Fallen Yang Peak. He was there because he had learned of Huang Xiaolong’s allocation and rage burned in his heart the moment he received the news.

“Let’s go speak to the vice hall master of the logistics hall! I refuse to believe that the Golden Buddha Race can do as they wish in the Otherworldly Mansion!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head in response. “It’s nothing much. The atmosphere around me doesn’t affect my cultivation speed in the slightest. There is no need to mess with them for such a small matter.”

Yin Zhangguo stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Finally, after Huang Xiaolong’s persistence, Yin Zhangguo found a seat in his mansion, and they both started drinking.

Taking out a jug of wine he treasured, Huang Xiaolong poured a cup for Yin Zhangguo. Initially, the vice hall master was skeptical about the quality of the wine, but his eyes lit up as soon as it went down his throat. Grabbing the jar, he downed half of it before stopping.

Of course, the jug of wine was brewed by Huang Xiaolong himself, and he had used the best wine fermentation technique Earth had to offer along with the ancient methods available in the world to brew his wine. The most important reason was also that Huang Xiaolong had added several dozen stalks of holy herbs during the fermentation process.

In the Alien Lands and the Holy World, there wasn’t anyone else who dared to do anything similar to what Huang Xiaolong had done.

Unable to control himself, Yin Zhangguo asked Huang Xiaolong about the origins of the wine. After hearing the truth, his hand trembled as he stared at the wineglass in his hand.

He only managed to calm down after a long time, but he didn’t forget to glare at Huang Xiaolong with a complicated gaze.

When he left, Huang Xiaolong took out several jugs and handed them over to him. After hesitating for some time, Yin Zhangguo eventually accepted them.

When dawn broke the next day, there were tons of people coming over to visit Huang Xiaolong. There were members of the Purple Spider Race, and there were also several humans.

In the past, the Purple Spider Race was flourishing at its peak and the number of disciples who had managed to join the Otherworldly Mansion was considerable. However, most of them were looking for Huang Xiaolong to complain about their treatment. Ever since Zi Dongping’s injury, their race had started to decline and the members of the Purple Spider Race in the Otherworldly Mansion had lost their backing. With the added suppression from the Golden Buddha Race, they had suffered a whole bunch.

As for the humans, they didn’t even need the Golden Buddha Race to suppress them.

Several days passed in a flash, and nothing eventful happened. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

During the nights, Huang Xiaolong would swallow holy pills in order to cultivate, and he would entertain guests in the morning.

Other than the disciples of the Purple Spider Race and the humans, there were disciples of other races paying him a visit. However, they were not there to mess with him. Instead, they were there as a sign of goodwill.

One fine day, Huang Xiaolong finally left the Fallen Yang Peak and headed straight to the mission hall. He entered and declared his intention to challenge the Dao Gate without the slightest hesitation.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong had appeared, ripples swept through the hall.

However, before Huang Xiaolong could leave the hall, a lady surrounded by disciples of the Otherworldly Mansion approached the hall. Her appearance was nearly flawless, and her beauty was capable of toppling nations. From her dressing, one could easily tell that her status in the Mansion wasn’t low.

Despite her beauty, Huang Xiaolong was more intrigued by the purple rune between her eyebrows.

Purple Spider Race?

“Zi Yutong! She’s one of the four beauties of our Otherworldly Mansion! She was from the Purple Spider Race, but ever since Lord Zi Dongping’s injury, she joined the Golden Buddha Race’s camp!” Someone in the crowd screamed.
