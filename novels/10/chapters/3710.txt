Chapter 3711: Suppressing Yin Xue

Yin Xue and the others looked at the experts who were kneeling along the street. They couldn’t help but widen their eyes in shock.

Almost every single person who kneeled on the ground was a city lord on the Snow Continent. Yin Xue’s generals and trusted aides were also among them.

All of them surrendered to a mere slave!

“Who the hell are you?!” Yin Xue leaped to her feet as a fire burned in her eyes. The gaze when she looked at Huang Xiaolong was no longer as indifferent as it once was. He had to be a true expert if he could control all of these people.

One had to know that there were two generals under Yin Xue whose combat prowess had crossed the 19 billion units mark! Even they weren’t spared!

How could Huang Xiaolong be an ordinary slave?

The three other experts beside her also got to their feet.

They stared at Huang Xiaolong cautiously.

Even so, they couldn’t understand how a mere God of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage could control so many powerhouses from the Universe First Race!

“You’ll find out about my identity soon,” Huang Xiaolong muttered. “After all, you’re going to become my slave too!”

He might have called all those who submitted to him his subordinates, but he had no mercy towards people like Yin Xue and the like.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Rage filled their hearts when they heard what Huang Xiaolong said.

Jin Long was the first to respond as he snorted with contempt, “Our Universe First Race has always been the rulers of the universe! Every single member of the Thirteen Universes is our slave! Brat, you’ll die a horrible death for what you just said!” A golden spear appeared in his hand as he slowly walked towards Huang Xiaolong.

“I’ll teach you the rule that existed since ancient times. Your race was destined to be slaves of our Universe First Race! You’re no exception!”

After he spoke, his spear stabbed at Huang Xiaolong.

A blinding light filled the space before him.

As though it stabbed into the dao hearts of everyone present, those standing around felt a sharp pain shooting through their chest.

It was too bad he was a weakling compared to Huang Xiaolong. With his bare hands, Huang Xiaolong grabbed the spear. The spear was nothing more than a toy in Huang Xiaolong’s hands.

With his expression changing drastically, Jin Long felt as though he had driven his spear through a world barrier!

When he was still stuck in a state of shock, Huang Xiaolong’s palm arrived above his head.

Even though it looked like an extremely ordinary attack, Jin Long felt as though the entire universe was crashing down on him! The boundless universe contained the strength of every single being in existence and he felt like an ant before it. No matter how hard he tried, he knew that there was no escaping the frightening blow!

Not even his special techniques of traveling through space would allow him to escape!

“Save me!” Jin Long yelled at Bi Qing and the others.

Leaping at Huang Xiaolong in unison, the three of them defended Jin Long from the terrifying blow. A divine halberd appeared in Bi Qing’s hand and a snow-white sword appeared in Yin Xue’s palm. A giant flaming fan appeared before Chi Feng.

Without batting an eyelid, Huang Xiaolong casually swept the three of them away as though they were merely annoying flies blocking his way.

As he swung his arms out to shoo them away, the three of them felt their brains tingling. They couldn’t help but dodge.

It was too bad that the three of them were still struck by the powerful blow as they were sent flying. They smashed into the ground quite a distance away.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t loosen his grip on Jin Long.

When he saw the look of terror on Jin Long’s face, Huang Xiaolong muttered, “Nothing is eternal in the universe. You might be the representation of absolute power in the past, but that might change in the future. Humans might be the slaves of the Universe First Race in the past, but in the future, your race will become my slaves! You’ll be slaves of Huang Xiaolong!”

“Huang Xiaolong?! You’re Huang Xiaolong?!” Yin Xue yelled in the distance.

The faces of Bi Qing and the others changed.

When the Golden Cymbals King was defeated by Huang Xiaolong back in the Netherworld, the Universe First Race learned about it. That was the reason the Heaven Devouring King and the Golden Qilin King were dispatched to the Unknown Space in order to deal with the man! Eventually, their plan was thwarted by the appearance of the Ferocious Devil! When that happened, the higher-ups of the Universe First Race raised their caution to the maximum.

Their evaluation of Huang Xiaolong placed him as the second strongest expert in the Unknown Space.

People like Yin Xue and the others learned about it and they were extremely shocked to hear his name.

“That’s right, I’m Huang Xiaolong.” Huang Xiaolong looked at them and continued, “Today, none of you will escape.”

Shattering their transmission symbols, Yin Xue, Bi Qing, and Chi Feng wanted to send a message to their masters to rescue them. However, endless starlight fell from the void. It covered the lands as countless roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree extended to cover the skies. The Golden Sun Circlet turned into a massive golden dragon that sealed off the continent.

They realized that their cries for help were blocked off completely.

“That’s the Star Dragon Divine Tree!” When the Golden Cymbals King returned, he said that Huang Xiaolong possessed several universe treasures when they fought. As such, they knew that Huang Xiaolong had the Star Dragon Divine Tree, Golden Sun Circlets, Universe Origin Fires, Reversal Sword, and Three Gods Halberd.

“Huang Xiaolong, if anything happens to us, our masters will learn of it immediately! Do you really think you can escape then?” Yin Xue roared.

Huang Xiaolong spoke indifferently, “There’s no need for you to worry about that. Do you really think that I’ll allow your masters to learn about this?”

Yin Xue and the others felt their hearts thumping in their chests.

When they were about to go crazy and unleash everything they had on Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong moved. He activated all three great worlds within him as 29 billion units of grand cosmos energy poured out from his body. As soon as it appeared, Yin Xue and the others felt the weight of the universe pressing down against them and they were forced to the ground.

They couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

“How… How is this possible?!” Yin Xue cried. “Don’t you only have 27 billion units of grand cosmos energy?!”

Bullsh*t! Huang Xiaolong was far stronger than they described! Not even the Heaven Devouring King was as strong as Huang Xiaolong!

“Well, that’s because your information is outdated.” Huang Xiaolong sighed.

?!

The four of them didn’t know what was going on. Just three million years ago, Huang Xiaolong was a God of Creation with less than 27 billion units of grand cosmos energy. Now, he reached the 29 billion mark!

He effortlessly suppressed all four of them and he branded their souls to control them.

When he was done, Huang Xiaolong got Yin Xue to gather all the experts of the Snow Continent. He gained complete control over the Snow Continent easily.
