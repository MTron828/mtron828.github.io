The two soaring snakes looked fearfully at Xu Baisheng. In a split second, both of them turned to flee, but Xu Baisheng captured and threw them at Huang Xiaolong’s feet, with a grab and throw gesture with his hand.

Lin Bi and these two soaring snakes were akin to babies who had just learned to crawl, against Xu Baisheng strength.

Lin Bi lifted his head as he struggled from the ground. There was fear, disbelief, and denial in his eyes as he looked at Xu Baisheng. ‘This seemingly cute demonic beast was actually a mid-level Ancestor God Realm master? Maybe even a high-level Ancestor God Realm master?!’

How is this possible?!

‘How could a high-level demonic beast be willing to serve a human master who is not an Ancestor God Realm master?’

“Kiddo, you didn’t think this would come to pass when you were relentlessly trying to kill us, did you?” The little cow’s face split into a wide grin that showed off her sparkling white teeth.

Lin Bi forced down his fear and said, “I am an Elder of Short Blade Gate. If you kill me, you won’t be able to escape the Short Blade Gate’s pursue. We have our sect’s experts everywhere on this Devil Prison Mountain, not to mention, our Gate Chief and Vice-Gate Chief are just nearby.”

The Yellow Springs Road was just ahead of them, therefore, Huang Xiaolong did not doubt Lin Bi when he said that a lot of Short Blade Gate’s experts as well as the Short Blade Gate’s Chief and Vice-Gate Chief were nearby.

‘Then again, so what?’ Huang Xiaolong sneered.

Just as Huang Xiaolong was about to order Xu Baisheng to kill Lin Bi, several sounds of whistling winds could be heard. Five figures were flying towards them at an alarming speed, and reached Huang Xiaolong’s group in a few breaths.

Lin Bi couldn’t hide the joy on his face as he saw these five people. He smiled in relief, as he thought that he had escaped death.

The five people were none other than the Short Blade Gate’s Grand Elders as well as the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders.

The strong energy fluctuations from when Xu Baisheng had killed the three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Elders had alarmed them.

With the emergence of the Yellow Springs Archdevil’s Treasure, the Short Blade Gate and Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s higher echelons had decided to form an alliance, thus all of the experts from both forces were grouping together. As a result of this alliance, the Short Blade Gate and Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders had appeared, alerted by the commotion.

“Grand Elder Wang Xiao!”

“Grand Elder Lin Chen!”

Lin Bi hastened to the two Short Blade Gate’s Grand Elders, and stood respectfully in front of them.

Short Blade Gate’s Grand Elder Wang Xiao, Grand Elder Lin Chen, and the other three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders were all inwardly shocked at Lin Bi’s heavy injuries.

“Lin Bi, what’s going on here?!” Lin Chen demanded sternly, while he was stared at Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Lin Bi lost his composure and half screamed, “Elder Sun Tong and the others are dead! It’s them! They killed Elder Sun Tong and the others, that black, that black demonic beast! It was that demonic beast!” He pointed shakily at Huang Xiaolong and the void devil beast Xu Baisheng.

W-what—?!

All five Grand Elders’ eyes were wide in shock. ‘Sun Tong is dead?’

Sun Tong was their Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Head’s personal disciple! But he had died, and on top of that he was killed by the people in front of them!

"That kid, had stolen a lot of our Short Blade Gate’s Eidolon Crystalline Rocks, and had also killed our Short Blade Gate’s disciples almost two years ago. Today, he killed Sun Tong and the others for the Chaos Yin Spirit Fruit!" Lin Bi quickly added.

Eidolon Crystalline Rocks!

Chaos Yin Spirit Fruits!

Wang Xiao, Lin Chen, and the rest turned to look at the cliff wall in the distance. They could see a dozen dark green glowing Chaos Yin Spirit Fruits, with greed shining in their eyes.

“But, Grand Elder Wang Xiao, that demonic beast’s strength is not low, I’m afraid it’s probably a high-level Ancestor God Realm.” Lin Bu added at the end through voice transmission to Wang Xiao.

Wang Xiao’s gaze swept over Xu Baisheng, he then sneered, “It’s merely a demonic beast that has just broken through to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm.”

The heavy stone in Lin Bi’s chest disappeared at Wang Xiao’s reply.

Wang Xiao was a late-Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm master. His strength ranked second among all of Short Blade Gate’s Grand Elders. Since Wang Xiao had claimed that the black demonic beast had just broken through to Seventh Order Ancestor God Realm, then it must definitely be true.

As Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others had concealed their strengths, they appeared no higher than mid-level Ancestor God Realm masters on the surface.

Wang Xiao’s gaze moved from Xu Baisheng and finally stopped on Huang Xiaolong as he spoke icily, “The Short Blade Gate has existed for thousands of years, this is the first time someone had the guts to kill our Short Blade Gate’s Elder. You will soon know what the consequences are.” Then he turned to the Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s three Grand Elders and said, “Three brothers, I will kill that demonic beast, but I leave the rest of them to you three. We’ll deal with the boy later, what do you think?”

The three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders answered in unison: “Sure!”

Wang Xiao stopped speaking and attacked first. In a split second, his palm had struck towards Xu Baisheng. This palm strike contained the full force of Wang Xiao’s strength as he intended to kill Xu Baisheng in the shortest amount of time.

In his opinion, as long as Xu Baisheng was out of the picture, then dealing with the rest would be easy.

Short Blade Gate’s Grand Elder Lin Chen extended his hand through the air, and a force from his hand entangled Huang Xiaolong and the little cow. While the three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders lunged towards Feng Er, Gui Yi, and the others.

Right at this time, Feng Er who had been quiet for this whole time, suddenly raised her slender hand and pushed lightly in the air.

The force from Lin Chen’s hand that was aimed at capturing Huang Xiaolong and the little cow was forced back by a whelming power. Lin Chen couldn’t even think to retaliate against this power. Lin Chen looked at Feng Er, as he tracked the source of this overwhelming power, and his eyes widened in astonishment.

In the next second, Lin Chen shrieked as he flew down like a broken kite.

Lin Chen’s shriek was so sudden and unexpected that Wang Xiao as well as the three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders turned to look, and saw a miserable Lin Chen embedded into the ground. Their faces turned sullen at this sight.

Feng Er did not stop at that. Her wrist turned and her palm forced rushed towards Wang Xiao. At the same time, Gui Yi, Gui Er, and Gui San all simultaneously swung their fists at the three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders.

In an instant, frigid ghost qi covered the sky above them, taking the shapes of ghost kings.

Wang Xiao and the others’ pupils contracted in fear, as they were punched into the air, and soon they also ended up like Lin Chen, embedded in the ground.

The tide had turned too quickly. Lin Bi turned woodenly to look at Wang Xiao and the other four Grand Elders who were half buried in the ground. A moment later, Lin Bi came to his senses, but coldness numbed his limbs. He quivered uncontrollably.

Huang Xiaolong looked coldly at Lin Chen then signaled the void devil beast Xu Baisheng. Xu Baisheng’s palm slammed down. The ground shook from the impact as Lin Bi was flattened on the ground.

But at this time, a figure flew out and as it tried to escape Huang Xiaolong’s group. However, his strength was much weaker than Lin Bi’s original strength, merely at the peak of late-Tenth Order Ancient God Realm. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Avatar!” Huang Xiaolong and the others exclaimed in surprise.

In general, rarely any Ancestor God Realms kept their avatars within their own main bodies. This was risky, as the avatar could still survive, even if the main body was killed.

For instance, Sun Tong and the others did not have their avatars within the main bodies when they were killed.

Xu Baisheng instantly destroyed Lin Bi’s avatar with a flick of his fingers.

A few minutes later, Huang Xiaolong collected the dozen Chaos Yin Spirit Fruits, as well as the spatial rings belonging to Lin Bi, Wang Xiao, Lin Chen, and the three Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s Grand Elders. Huang Xiaolong did not forget their godheads. Without bothering to clean up the scene, he sped off on the little cow, with Feng Er and the rest following behind them.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong’s group had left this scene, space rippled as another powerful presence descended on it. They were the Short Blade Gate and Golden Phoenix Pavilion’s experts.

Roughly an hour later, Huang Xiaolong’s group appeared at the beginning of a bloody road.

Unknown beasts’ blood flowed on this bloody road, and on the two edges of the bloody path was roiling yellow-colored water. This yellow-colored water could make any cultivator’s heart palpitate, as a strong stench from this yellow-water permeated the air.

This was the Yellow Springs Road!

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes narrowed solemnly.
