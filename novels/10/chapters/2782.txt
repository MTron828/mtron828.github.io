Chapter 2783: Saint Devil Prince Takes a Master!

As Saint Devil Heavenly Cave shook from this news, everyone spoke about the formations master behind Cangqiong Old Man and Huang Xiaolong. Even though the experts, who had witnessed the battle, said that Huang Xiaolong hadn’t utilized the power from a formation world, they were mocked mercilessly. No one believed anything they said.

A Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm expert defeating several hundred Primal Ancestors wasn’t something possible!

Moreover, the Primal Ancestors were from Nine Revolutions Sacred Land in Saint Devil Heavenly Cave!

No one believed something as absurd as that.

As such, they treated it as a joke and laughed it off.

No matter what, no one seemed to believe that Huang Xiaolong had emerged victorious in the battle because of his strength. While they were laughing at him, Huang Xiaolong was casually ransacking the treasury of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land. By casually subduing all the Primal Ancestors he could, he suppressed the dao souls of those he couldn’t and threw them into the Cangqiong Dao Palace.

After he was done, he returned to Cangqiong Sacred Land.

By the time he returned, several months had already passed. He gathered the patriarchs from the Spirit Devil Alliance, and he got them to gather all the Primal Ancestors under them in Cangqiong Sacred Land. After a round of cleansing, he controlled the twenty-two powers in the Spirit Devil Alliance.

Adding the Primal Ancestors from Nine Revolutions Scared Land, the number of Primal Ancestors working for Cangqiong Sacred Land increased to over a thousand! There were a little more than one thousand and one hundred of them!

Even the sacred lands ranking in the twenties in Saint Devil Heavenly Cave didn’t possess such power. If they compared the number of Primal Ancestors, Huang Xiaolong’s Cangqiong Sacred Land would rank in the top fifteen superpowers!

Qian Haishan’s Mountain Sea Sacred Land couldn’t even come close to the number!

After controlling the Spirit Devil Alliance and Nine Revolutions Sacred Land, Huang Xiaolong didn’t continue to expand his power. Instead, he asked Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, and the others to consolidate their power. He wanted to lay down a massive formation above their various headquarters so that they could reinforce each other as quickly as possible. At the same time, he gathered the various experts under his subordinates in order to speed up the construction of Cangqiong Sacred Land.

One fine day…

Huang Xiaolong sat in the space inside the Cangqiong Dao Palace, and a pill glowing pure gold appeared in his hands. The pill seemed to contain a world of its own, and a frighteningly powerful wave of grand dao energy pulsed from it occasionally. Strands of grand dao law swirled on the surface of the pill.

The pill in his hands was one of the True Flow Dao Pills that he had bought in the auction previously.

The battle with Chen Sen and the others had allowed Huang Xiaolong to feel the pressure, and he wanted nothing more than to increase his strength as quickly as he could.

As such, Huang Xiaolong handed everything over to Cangqiong Old Man, Duan Feng, and the others after ensuring that Cangqiong Sacred Land was on track, and he entered seclusion immediately.

Huang Xiaolong looked at the pill in his hands and sucked in a long breath before swallowing the pill.

Even though his body was extremely sturdy, and he could easily withstand refining two True Flow Dao Pills at once, he chose to do it one by one.

As soon as the pill entered his body, it turned into a wave of grand dao energy as strands of grand dao laws surrounded him. They diffused through his body to fill every cell.

If any Primal Ancestor was present and saw the way Huang Xiaolong refined the dao pill, they would be shocked out of their minds. Experts at the Dao Venerable Realm had to expend a ton of effort in order to refine dao pills, filling it with a frightening amount of grand dao energy. Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors wouldn’t even think of swallowing something with that amount of power.

Ordinarily, they would slowly refine the grand dao energy and grand dao laws bit by bit.

If True Saints had the fortune of refining one, they would be extremely cautious, as a slight overestimation of their abilities would cause them to explode from the surging waves of grand dao energy. Huang Xiaolong was the first and probably only person who could do anything like it.

As he slowly refined the True Flow Dao Pill, the phantom of a giant golden dragon slowly appeared behind him.

While he was deep in seclusion, Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qingreturned to the Blue Heaven Creed. The first thing Yi Xiaotang did was to report the battle between Huang Xiaolong and the members of Nine Revolutions Sacred Land to her father, the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable.

“A Ninth Heaven True Saint fought against several hundred Primal Ancestors? There were even high-level Primal Ancestors among them?! You’re telling me that the strongest one was at the peak of the late-Eighth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm?!” The Blue Heaven Dao Venerable stared at his daughter in disbelief.

However, he broke into laughter. “Alright, Xiaotang, you’re not allowed to make up jokes like this anymore.” After pausing for a second, he continued, “Yan San brought the Saint Devil Prince over to visit me. Since you’re here, follow me to meet them.”

Seeing as her father was unwilling to believe her, she hastily exclaimed, “Father, it’s true! Huang Xiaolong is really a Ninth Heaven True Saint!”

“Enough!” Interrupting her, the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable snapped, “They’re here.”

A pout formed on Yi Xiaotang’s face when she saw that her father was unwilling to believe her. Moreover, she also knew the reason her father wanted her to meet the Saint Devil Prince. He was definitely planning on getting them together.

“I have something I need to attend right now… I’ll take my leave first,” Yi Xiaotang spoke quickly, and she left before anyone could react. By the time the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable turned to stare at where she once stood, she was already gone.

By shaking his head helplessly, the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable realized that he couldn’t do anything to his daughter. As the Blue Heaven Dao Venerable, he controlled several hundred thousand sacred lands. Not a single sacred lands’ or ancient races’ patriarch dared to show him the slightest disrespect, but the only person who could give him a headache was his daughter.

…

In the blink of an eye, a year and a half passed.

Huang Xiaolong slowly emerged from the Cangqiong Dao Palace after refining the True Flow Dao Pill.

Even though Ninth Resurrection Primal Ancestors would need several thousands of years to refine a single dao pill, Huang Xiaolong did it in a mere year!

After emerging from the palace, his master, Cangqiong Old Man, came over to greet him along with Duan Feng, Long Jianfei, and the others. They spoke of the news that the Saint Devil Prince was about to be accepted as the disciple of the grand hall master of the Blue Heaven Creed.

“Oh? Is Grand Hall Master Yan San planning to accept him as a disciple?” Huang Xiaolong was slightly taken aback.

“That’s right!” Cangqiong Old Man snorted, “His apprenticeship ceremony will be held in four years at the headquarters of the Blue Heaven Creed!”

The expressions of Cangqiong Old Man and the others were ugly. In the past, the news on the Saint Devil Prince was nothing more than rumors. However, it was confirmed to be true now, and he wasn’t just the disciple of the vice grand hall master! He would be the disciple of the grand hall master of the Blue Heaven Creed!

It wasn’t great news for the sacred lands of the Saint Devil Heavenly Cave now that Saint Devil Sacred Land had found such a huge backer.

“Since the news of the Saint Devil Prince being accepted as Yan San’s disciple has started to spread, the various sacred lands are sending their experts over to Saint Devil Sacred Land to show their respects. They are probably planning to hug the Blue Heaven Creed’s big thigh…” Mo Zhi said.

“Xiaolong, about this…” Cangqiong Old Man muttered.

“There’s no need to care about him.” Huang Xiaolong remained expressionless. As the saying goes, when the water comes, the dam shall block it. When the soldiers come, the general shall hold them back. The most important thing to him was to enter the Primal Ancestor Realm. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After gaining an understanding about the happenings in Cangqiong Sacred Land, he returned to refine another True Flow Dao Pill.

Another forty years passed before anyone knew it.

In the forty years, Huang Xiaolong refined all sixteen True Flow Dao Pills, and he took out everything from Nine Revolutions Sacred Land that could increase his cultivation realm. His cultivation soared and finally stopped at the peak of the late-Ninth Heaven True Saint Realm.
