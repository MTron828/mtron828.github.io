Chapter 3555 – Huang Xiaolong, You Dare?!

The laws of the universe gathered around Kai Dong. When that happened, Huang Xiaolong felt that his three great worlds were slowing down.

To his surprise, he felt extremely restricted by the universe laws! He could only use NINETY percent of his original power!

“Huang Xiaolong, what do you think?! Do you feel suppressed?” Kai Dong roared with laughter as he approached Huang Xiaolong. A burning gaze could be seen in his eyes as he continued, “Three great worlds… Huang Xiaolong, you surprise me time and time again.”

A jade-blue spike appeared in his hands as he spoke.

“This is a top-grade creation artifact I nurtured all these years. It hasn’t seen blood in many years!” Kai Dong sneered. “It can pierce through anything in the thirteen universes!”

Stabbing straight towards Huang Xiaolong’s glabella.

If it connected, Huang Xiaolong’s dao soul would be completely destroyed!

Before what Kai Dong anticipated could happen, a giant tree appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. Starlight fell from the crown of the tree, and the universe shifted. The purple lightning that filled the grand formation was completely covered up.

He fused with the Star Dragon Divine Tree, and the spike landed on the trunk instead of his head. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Thunk.”

A frightening amount of starlight was released from the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

Kai Dong felt a sharp pain shooting up his arm, and he realized that he only managed to cut off a tiny piece of bark.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t remain idle as he commenced his retaliation instantaneously. The roots of the Star Dragon Divine Tree swept at Kai Dong and they sent him flying. He tried his best to dodge, but there were too many roots to take care of!

By the time he stabilized himself, perspiration drenched his armor.

“Star Dragon Divine Tree!” The experts of the Creation Palace yelled in unison.

Kai Dong felt his head going numb when he stared at the massive tree standing before him.

Huang Xiaolong actually managed to obtain the Star Dragon Divine Tree!

If the Universe Boat didn’t appear, nothing would be able to suppress the Star Dragon Divine Tree!

His initial confidence to suppress Huang Xiaolong turned to dust instantly as despair filled his heart.

Layers upon layers of starlight emerged from the Star Dragon Divine Tree to engulf the space they were in.

…

Half a day later, Tao Shi frowned as he asked one of the experts beside him, “Did the Creation Palace say anything?!”

“Not yet…” Qian Shaolin sighed. “Do you think that they changed their mind? Did Kai Dong not make a move on Huang Xiaolong?”

“This is the best chance they have to get rid of him! They won’t give it up no matter what happens.” Tao Shi shook his head. “I’m afraid that an accident might have occured.”

Feng Tianquan chuckled in response, “What accident can there be? There is no way Kai Dong, Ao Wanshan, and Wang Zaixu can lose to Huang Xiaolong! Kai Dong is a half step Universe God! It won’t be easy for anyone to deal with him!”

Tao Shi nodded slowly.

Another hour passed but everything remained quiet.

“This won’t do. We have to head over to take a look.” Tao Shi snapped.

Nodding in acknowledgement, Qian Shaolin growled, “Alright, we’ll go together.”

The experts of the Eternal Heaven Alliance’s fourth team returned to the Tight Stone Forest to check up on the outcome of the battle.

By the time they returned, they noticed that the area was eerily quiet. There were no signs of battle!

The silence caused Tao Shi’s heart to palpitate.

Looking at each other in silence, everyone felt uneasy.

“Did Kai Dong really change his mind?” Feng Tianquan frowned. “It’s too quiet! Not a sign of battle can be seen!”

“Huang Xiaolong might have already cleaned up the battlefield…” Qian Shaolin guessed.

His words were met with ridicule from Feng Tianquan. “Lord Qian, Huang Xiaolong cannot possibly bring along three half step Universe Gods with him. With Kai Dong, Ao Wanshan, and Wang Zaixu, they would be able to hold their own even against three half step Universe Gods! There’s no need to question their abilities!”

“Let’s enter.” Tao Shi suddenly suggested. However, they were greeted by Huang Xiaolong’s party before they could enter the Tight Stone Forest.

Tao Shi and the others stared in shock as Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards them unscathed.

Was Feng Tianquan right? Did the Creation Palace change their mind?!

“Did… Did nothing happen?!” Tao Shi couldn’t help but ask.

“Of course not? Are all of you feeling unwell? Your complexion looks pretty bad…” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“We ran into a group of wild beasts earlier… We’re fine now.”

“That’s good to hear.” Huang Xiaolong nearly failed to contain his laughter.

As such, the entire group from the Eternal Heaven Alliance continued on their way.

It didn’t take long for Tao Shi’s transmission symbol to tremble. It was a message from an expert from the Creation Palace!

After reading the report, Tao Shi’s expression changed. He felt a chill running down his spine. In the message, it was said that Kai Dong’s group of sixteen lost all contact with the Creation Palace. They were questioning Tao Shi on the disappearance!

Since the Creation Palace could say something like that, there was no mistake about it! Kai Dong definitely made a move!

This…

Tao Shi looked at Huang Xiaolong from the corner of his eye, and he felt goosebumps all over his body.

If their disappearance had something to do with Huang Xiaolong, they were in deep sh*t! He felt as though he was looking at the most terrifying beast hidden in human skin at that moment.

Huang Xiaolong caught the look of terror in Tao Shi’s eye and a smile formed on his face. “Fellow cultivator Tao Shi, is there something wrong?”

Shaking his head violently, Tao Shi stuttered, “No… Nothing’s wrong!”

Qian Shaolin signaled to Tao Shi with his eyes, and Tao Shi quickly passed the transmission symbol over. Like Tao Shi, Qian Shaolin felt his limbs going cold.

Ignoring the two of them, Huang Xiaolong stopped suddenly as he stared in a certain direction in shock. Just a second ago, he felt a reaction from the universe sphere! It might not be too strong, but there was definitely something!

There was only one explanation. The universe sphere felt the existence of the cosmos sphere!

No longer bothering with Tao Shi and the rest, Huang Xiaolong shot through the air in the direction of the calling. Wang Meiqi and the others followed closely behind.

When Feng Tianquan saw Huang Xiaolong leaving the group, he roared in anger, “Huang Xiaolong, how dare you leave the group without Lord Tao Shi’s order?!”
