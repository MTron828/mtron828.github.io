That Berserk Lion Sect Elder complied and flew toward Huang Xiaolong.

Precisely at this moment, Huang Xiaolong’s body flipped backwards while the Mulberry Sword in his hand thrust forward like a dragon emerging from the sea, piercing into Wei Chao’s chest in the blink of an eye. That single sword attack sent Wei Chao flying back, wailing in pain, causing blood drops to splatter into the air.

“Kill that dog Huang Xiaolong for me—!” Clutching at the wound on his chest, Wei Chao shouted at the Berserk Lion Sect Elder.

Huang Xiaolong sneered, “Oh? If I remember correctly, just now you said that if I withstood one sword attack from you, you’d let me go.” Huang Xiaolong’s voice was thick with ridicule.

Wei Chao’s face turned slightly red, infuriated, he shouted, “Huang Xiaolong, you’re already at death’s door yet you’re still so arrogant. I’m waiting to see how that late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm expert is going to save you.”

In this short moment, that Berserk Lion Sect Elder had arrived in front of Huang Xiaolong, unsheathing his long sword. A cold light glinted on its edge, it was apparently another ancient divine sword.

The Elder’s momentum rose to a peak, causing the sword in his hand to also shine brighter as if it had devoured all the color from the surrounding area, before attacking without another word.

Almost in an instant, the tip of the Elder’s long sword was already a meter away from Huang Xiaolong’s forehead.

As a Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm cultivator, he was many times stronger than Wei Chao, and many times faster as well.

Still watching from the distance, the Three Evils were paying close attention to the any movement in close proximity to Huang Xiaolong. As long as that hidden expert protecting him make a move, the three of them would jointly attack, targeting to kill that expert in one lethal strike!

Just as that Elder’s longsword was close to piercing into Huang Xiaolong’s forehead, space rippled and a giant green ice hand reached out. To the Elder’s horror, the long sword in his hand was encrusted in ice in an instant!

Not only that, his arm that was holding the sword lost all feeling as layers of green ice climbed up his skin, covering every inch of his body.

In less than a breath’s time, the Elder felt his soul and his consciousness freeze up.

After this, that giant ice hand slapped down, causing the Elder’s body to shoot down straight into the bottom of the sea, raising a pillar of water into the air.

The moment the giant green ice hand appeared, the Three Evils who had been observing Huang Xiaolong’s surroundings moved at the same time, cold metallic light glimmered in their hands as they attacked.

Three sword lights crisscrossed, forming a mysterious diagram, powerful sword qi taking over the sky.

However, all of a sudden, the three old men’s expressions turned rigid. Their attacks halted forcefully as their incredulous gazes stared at the space behind Huang Xiaolong where a huge green iceman was standing.

That green iceman was exuding an overwhelming divine might, causing green frigid coldness spreading out in the surroundings at a rapid speed. The sea water below froze into green ice at a speed visible to the naked eye.

In front of this huge green iceman, the peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm Three Evils actually felt their souls tremble.

An icy coldness spread to their four limbs, ‘This is...!’

An Ancient God Realm master!

The hidden expert protecting Huang Xiaolong was neither a late-Tenth Order nor a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm, but an Ancient God Realm master! A motherf*cking Ancient God Realm master!

The other remaining Berserk Lion Sect Elder, the Three Evils, Wei Chao, as well as Zhao Wuya were jarred out of their senses, fear seizing their hearts.

Huang Xiaolong snickered watching their reactions and chose to approach Wei Chao first.

Wei Chao’s complexion had turned bloodlessly pale, stammering as he tried to think of what to say to Huang Xiaolong, “Huang, Huan-g, Huang Xiaolong, we didn’t, didn’t know...”

“Didn’t know that I have an Ancient God Realm master protecting me?” Huang Xiaolong finished Wei Chao’s sentence with stinging satire.

Wei Chao was panicking. Fear, regret, and killing intent filled his heart as his gaze fell on Zhao Wuya in the distance. Everything was this damn Zhao Wuya’s fault, saying that the expert protecting Huang Xiaolong could only be a peak late-Tenth Order Heavenly God Realm at most. If it wasn’t for this Zhao Wuya tempting him, today they wouldn’t have....!”

Imagining the impending consequences, Wei Chao looked even worse.

“Huang Xiaolong, you might have an Ancient God Realm Green Ice Hail Devil protecting you, but with us Three Evils together, you won’t be able to stop us if we want to escape.” At this time, Evil Devil who recovered his senses and quickly suppressed the fear in his heart, solemnly saying. "About today’s matter, we’re willing to apologize to you. Rest assured, after we leave, we will not speak a word of this.”

After all, the Three Evils were invincible under the Ancient God Realm when working together. Although their strength was lacking against an Ancient God Realm master, there was a good chance of escaping, and they had succeeded in doing so in the past.

“Not speak a word of today’s matter?” A derisive snort sounded from Huang Xiaolong’s mouth, “You think I’m a three-year-old child?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The Three Evils suddenly turned into three streaks of sword light, scattering off. One of them rolled Wei Chao up and fled a thousand li away in the blink of an eye. As for the two Berserk Lion Sect Elders, they had already been abandoned by the Three Evils.

Watching this, Huang Xiaolong let out a cold sneer.

’Want to run?’

At this time, the Green Ice Hail Devil Bing Jiuyi behind Huang Xiaolong moved. In the next moment, he appeared in the path of the Three Evils.

In the Divine World, Heavenly God Realm cultivators could fly, and only those who broke through to the Ancient God Realm were capable of teleporting.

Bing Jiuyi struck a palm at the Three Evils, sending the four people back in Huang Xiaolong’s direction. The Berserk Lion Sect robe on their backs turned to pieces, revealing a huge green palmprint on their torsos.

“You, your strength is higher than early First Order Ancient God Realm!” Evil Devil’s shocked words resounded, broken by the blood spurting out from his mouth.

Evil Ghost and Evil Blood felt an ominous doom wrap around them and their hearts threatened to explode.

Even though they were apprehensive when they first saw Bing Jiuyi, they had been confident they would be able to flee safely, hence, the Three Evils did not feel a genuine danger. However, now, they truly felt despair.

They indeed could flee facing an Ancient God Realm master, but that depended on their cultivation. The possibility was high if it was an early First Order Ancient God Realm, but when it came to a mid-First Order Ancient God Realm and above, they were dead for sure!

“Huang Xiaolong, spare me, I’m the Berserk Lion Sect Chief’s personal disciple!” Wei Chao shrieked in a voice several octaves higher, “What do you want? As long as you let me go, I can make an oath with heaven’s law, I swear on my life that I will absolutely not tell a word of what happened today to anyone!”

The Three Evils did not speak, but their agreement to Wei Chao’s words was obvious from their expressions.

Yet Huang Xiaolong remained cold, “I can spare your lives on the condition that I brand your godheads with a soul mark.”

Huang Xiaolong was currently searching for a lot of medicinal herbs to refine the Reverse Incarnation Pill, especially the five essential chaos herbs, so taking in these people would ease his effort in searching.

Wei Chao and the Three Evils’ expressions turned ugly in an instant at Huang Xiaolong’s words.

Branding a soul mark into their godheads!

“I’ll give you five minutes to consider it.” Huang Xiaolong stated, unhurried at all. Then, his right arm extended, pulling Zhao Wuya to his front.

“Huang Xiaolong, don’t kill me, I’m willing, I’m willing to let you brand my godhead with a soul mark!” Zhao Wuya screamed anxiously, his legs shaking uncontrollably.

But Huang Xiaolong was indifferently silent, his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power roaring to life. Before Wei Chao and the Three Evils understood what was happening, Zhao Wuya let out a blood-curdling scream, his body shrinking right before their eyes.

Fear gripped Wei Chao, the Three Evils, and the two Berserk Lion Sect Elders like never before.
