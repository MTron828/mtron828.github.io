Originally, Huang Xiaolong hadn’t planned on fighting with this ten-winged pegasus. After all, he didn’t lack a mount. With his current status and identity, what kind of mount couldn’t he get if he wanted to?

Hence, Huang Xiaolong dodged in a flicker by reflex.

But the result surprised Huang Xiaolong. When he made a move to dodge, the ten-winged pegasus had already arrived by his side, and he wouldn’t leave!

It actually stood intimately by Huang Xiaolong’s side, snorting in excitement and pleasure.

His actions utterly stupefied Huang Xiaolong.

No, it can’t be!

“Little guy, I’m not your master. Why are you following me so closely?” Huang Xiaolong joked.

The ten-winged pegasus blinked his sapphire blue eyes and spoke, “Who said I’m young? It’s just that the energy from your body is very comfortable. I have seen many pontiffs, but the energy from their bodies isn’t as comfortable as yours.”

Huang Xiaolong was surprised by the ten-winged pegasus’s reply. Energy? Could it be the Heavenly Hall’s energy?

In other words, could this pegasus sense the Heavenly Hall’s energy in him?

Then again, it was not impossible. Legend had it that elite sacred beasts like the pegasus were born from the Radiance World’s origin radiance energy.

By this point, the group pursuing from behind had caught up. They immediately spread out and encircled Huang Xiaolong and the pegasus.

“Punk, get lost, don’t hinder us!” One of them barked impatiently at Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong made a quick sweep around him and asked in an unhurried tone, “And if I don’t...? Get lost?”

The person snickered at Huang Xiaolong’s retort, “Not going to get lost? I told you to get lost for your own good, giving you a chance to run to save your life! Since you don’t know how to appreciate it, then, you might as well go to hell now!” He swung his blade at Huang Xiaolong.

This person was quite powerful, a peak late-Seventh Order Heavenly Monarch, just half a step from advancing to late-Eighth Order Heavenly Monarch Realm. In any church of the Radiance World, he would be a candidate of focused nurturing.

Huang Xiaolong’s gaze turned frosty, watching the blade falling towards him. A ruthless light gleamed, and in the next second, everyone saw the man who had slashed his blade at Huang Xiaolong suddenly split into two halves from the middle. Blood spurted high into the air and rained to the ground. The man was already dead before he could grunt in pain.

His companions were startled, and they looked at Huang Xiaolong in shock and wariness.

All of a sudden, the surroundings went deathly quiet.

“You, you dared to kill my Half Moon Church’s Senior Deacon, you—! You’re so f*cking dead!” One of them pointed angrily at Huang Xiaolong angrily as he shouted.

The several hundred people behind him were glaring murder at Huang Xiaolong.

The Half Moon Church was part of the Radiance World’s most powerful one hundred church forces, one of the arms under the Radiance Lord Dun Ei.

“I killed him, so what?” Huang Xiaolong sounded as if he was talking about eating lunch. “If your Half Moon’s pontiff is here, I’ll kill him just the same.”

Everyone looked strangely at Huang Xiaolong because of his words.

The Half Moon Church’s pontiff was a late-Tenth Order Emperor Realm expert.

The man let out a whoop of laughter, “Punk, you would kill him, relying on your strength? Don’t you know that our Half Moon Church’s pontiff is a late-Tenth Order Emperor? You don’t even qualify to carry our Half Moon Church’s pontiff’s shoes, but you have the cheek to speak of killing him.”

Huang Xiaolong simply tapped a finger in the air just as the man finished, and the man burst into a fog of blood.

“So what if he’s a late-Tenth Order Emperor?” Huang Xiaolong repeated nonchalantly, “Even if he’s a late-Tenth Order Emperor, I’ll end him just the same.”

It wasn’t as if he had not killed a late-Tenth Order Emperor before. Whether it was above Hell’s Nethersea or the Devil World’s Famish Devil Ancient Battlefield, he had killed several late-Tenth Order Emperors. Truth be told, he had actually lost count of many late-Tenth Order Emperors he had killed to date.

Although Huang Xiaolong had consecutively killed two people and showed his startling strength, the several thousand experts, encircling him, perceived his words to be presumptuously arrogant. Huang Xiaolong’s words especially infuriated the Emperor Realm experts.

Among these several thousand people, there were four Emperor Realm pontiffs. Though none of them were high-level or even mid-level Emperor Realm, one of the four was an early Second Order Emperor Realm expert.

“You really got a big tone there. Do you think that killing a late-Tenth Order Emperor is just the same?” The early Second Order Emperor Realm pontiff questioned as his expression grew icier by the second, “Do you think you are our Radiance Ancestor? I really want to see how you are going to kill me, an early Second Order Emperor?!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Huang Xiaolong had not concealed his aura when he had killed the two people earlier. Thus, this early Second-Order Emperor Realm pontiff was able to determine that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was merely at the early First Order Emperor Realm. Moreover, he could clearly tell that Huang Xiaolong had just advanced not long ago.

A punk that recently advanced to Emperor Realm actually had the guts to talk in a big tone in front of them, claiming he could easily kill a late-Tenth Order Emperor. It would be strange if they weren’t outraged.

That pontiff leaped into the air, and the sword in his hand slashed out towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Punk, take my Ten Thousand Radiance God Slash!” Layers upon layers of sword qi rushed forward with just one slash, numbering exactly ten thousand layers. Every layer of sword qi was powerful enough to kill any First Order Emperor.

“This is the Fire Worshipper Church’s ultimate technique!”

“The Fire Worshipper Church is an ancient supreme church that had disappeared for a billion years. Indestructible Pontiff actually got the Fire Worshipper Church’s ultimate technique!” The other three Emperor Realm pontiffs exclaimed almost in unison.

It could be said that the Radiance Lord Dun Ei ruled half of the Radiance World, and the Radiance Knight Corp ruled the other half. Then again, this was a very general description of the overall situation. In truth, still, a large number of Radiance World’s super churches did not attach themselves to Dun Ei or the Radiance Knight Corp. The Fire Worshipper Church in ancient times was one such example.

This aspect alone spoke volumes of the Fire Worshipper Church’s power. As the Fire Worshipper Church’s ultimate technique, the Ten Thousand Radiance God Slash was an overbearingly powerful attack technique.

Since Indestructible Pontiff had used such a big move in his initial attack, he clearly intended to kill Huang Xiaolong in one move. One reason for him to do so was to deter everyone, so the process of taking away the pegasus would be smoother. Secondly, he detested Huang Xiaolong’s arrogance, who had just broken through to Emperor Realm.

In a split second, the Ten Thousand Radiance God Slash attack reached Huang Xiaolong. Huang Xiaolong snickered ironically. Without employing his Emperor’s will or using the three devil stele’s power, he punched out with his bare fist and dispersed the Ten Thousand Radiance God Slash in an instant. He rushed forward and punched the Indestructible Pontiff squarely on the chest.

Huang Xiaolong’s fist pierced a hole through Indestructible Pontiff’s chest and came out his back. Huang Xiaolong slowly withdrew his fist.

At the same time, a group of experts was flying towards them. This was the group that had invited Huang Xiaolong to join their team.

Lu Feng and his team saw Huang Xiaolong’s fist pierce through Indestructible Pontiff’s chest from afar and came to a sudden halt in midair. Shock and disbelief were written all over their faces. The shock was mainly visible on the mid-Third Order Heavenly Monarch middle-aged man who had claimed to teach Huang Xiaolong a miserable lesson. His complexion turned pallid.

All around was an unnatural silence. This eerie silence had descended due to overwhelming shock as no one could move their gazes away from the gaping hole in Indestructible Pontiff’s chest.

“You, how is it possible?!” Indestructible Pontiff shrieked sharply. Even at this point, he denied reality. He, an early Second Order Emperor, had his chest penetrated by a punk who had newly advanced to the Emperor Realm. Moreover, there was a destructive force that was frenziedly shredding away his body’s vitality.

A few breaths passed and Indestructible Pontiff’s body exploded into splatters of blood and flesh.

Dead!

Ignoring the astounded faces, Huang Xiaolong’s cold gaze swept around, and he asked, “Anyone else wants me to get lost?” Then he pointed at the ten-winged pegasus and added, “I want this ten-winged pegasus, anyone wants to snatch it?”

Originally, a ten-winged pegasus was negligible to Huang Xiaolong, and he didn’t care about possessing it. But now, he had decided to take it.
