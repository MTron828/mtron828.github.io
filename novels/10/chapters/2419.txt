Chapter 2420: Strongest Undead Spirit

Even though they were protected in the Winged Dragon Holy Ship, the three True Saints felt a trace of fear surfacing in their hearts. As for the half-True Saints, they felt as though their hearts were about to leap out their throats.

The only person, who could remain composed, was Huang Xiaolong.

Even though the undead spirit seemed strong, it was only in the Third Heaven True Saint Realm at best. Undead spirits had no holy soul, and they couldn’t draw upon the energy of the world. A Third Heaven True Saint undead spirit was far weaker than a living expert of the same level.

Despite that, Huang Xiaolong brought the ship to a stop.

Very quickly, a massive figure tens of thousands of feet tall tore through the space and shot straight towards them.

The undead spirit had eyes that flashed an eerie green color.

As the undead spirit approached, the death qi in the air grew thicker.

Luckily for them, they were protected by the formation of the Winged Dragon Flying Ship. Otherwise, even existences like Yu Ming would be forced to retreat.

Soon, the undead spirit turned around and left.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they noticed that it had left.

Huang Xiaolong stared at its departing figure as a weird light shone in his eyes. After obtaining the Dao Heart upon crossing the fourth tribulation, he would probably return to subdue all the undead spirits there.

Even though it no longer had a holy soul, it should be comparable to a weak Third Heaven True Saint in strength. Moreover, it was easier to subdue the undead soul than a living Third Heaven True Saint Realm expert. A Third Heaven True Saint Realm undead soul would prove to be a substantial assistance.

Of course, he didn’t speak of his thoughts. If the three True Saints around him heard his plan, they would probably go crazy.

Huang Xiaolong only continued to travel deeper into the Holy Gate when the undead spirit was gone.

Upon seeing that there were no other obstructions, Huang Xiaolong’s three holy souls pierced deeper into the Holy Gate.

However, he failed to notice anything even after pushing them to their limit.

An hour later...

“This used to be the forbidden region of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate,” Yu Ming pointed towards one of the mountain ranges and introduced.

When Huang Xiaolong looked over, he saw a mountain range filled with cracks as blade qi pierced into the air. This was evidently where the supreme experts had exchanged blows.

He noticed the waves of death qi rolling around under him, and it was even more terrifying than the death qi the undead spirit emitted.

The look in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes hardened. He pushed his holy soul towards the mountain range, but he realized that there was an undead spirit hovering in the depths of the forbidden region. It was absorbing origin energy contantly as death qi raged around it.

Compared to the undead spirit they had met the day before, it was several dozen times stronger.

The undead spirit in the forbidden region of the All Extinguishing Holy Gate was definitely in the Fourth Heaven True Saint Realm!

When Huang Xiaolong was shocked at his discovery, the undead spirit opened its eyes and killing intent surged out from them.

“Oh no!” Huang Xiaolong yelled.

“Let’s go!”

Without the slightest bit of hesitation, Huang Xiaolong controlled the Winged Dragon Flying Ship, and they sped away.

As they made their escape, a thunderous roar echoed behind them and the ground beneath trembled uncontrollably. The undead spirit in the forbidden region tore through the earth as death qi filled the skies.

Huang Xiaolong and the others poured their energy into the main formation of the Winged Dragon Flying Ship when they felt the disturbance around them.

Only after half an hour of running and ensuring that the undead soul wasn’t behind him did Huang Xiaolong stop the ship. By the time they stopped, the True Saints felt cold sweat dripping down their foreheads.

“That was close...,” Huang Xiaolong heaved a sigh of relief.

With the concealment aura of the Darkness Holy Ring, it was impossible for the undead soul to detect them. However, it had managed to capture traces of Huang Xiaolong snooping around with his holy soul.

...

After getting away, Huang Xiaolong and the others only remained in the All Extinguishing Holy Gate for two more days before taking their leave.

Even though he had already expected to leave empty handed, Huang Xiaolong still felt a wave of disappointment that he had failed to locate the All Extinguishing Holy Symbol.

As soon as they left the All Extinguishing Holy Ground, Huang Xiaolong ordered Chen Zhi and the others to control the ship. They would only notify him when they neared the Devil Palace’s branch.

When he had left the Holy Heavens previously, he had only managed to learn the basics of whatever the four Primal Ancestors had taught him. However, the evolution of the Heart of Hell had allowed him to better comprehend it.

Choosing one of the holy martial arts and divine techniques they had passed on, Huang Xiaolong swallowed a level-ten origin spiritual pill and continued his comprehension.

Since he was out of holy pills, he could only make do with level-ten origin spiritual pills.

Of course, if anyone else were to learn of his complaints, they would gather around and drown him in their spit.

Ever since he had swallowed the Star Transferring Holy Pill, he felt that level-ten origin spiritual pills were no longer as effective.

Moreover, he had entered the Second Tribulation half-True Saint Realm. The energy he needed to push himself further along the road of cultivation had increased by several times, and level-ten origin spiritual pills were indeed no longer as effective as they once were. When he entered the Fourth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm, level-ten origin spiritual pills might no longer assist him in his cultivation! Only holy pills would be of use.

“Holy pills...,” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself.

It seemed as though he needed to look for ways to gather holy pills.

No matter how he racked his brains, he knew that locating holy herbs were a million times easier than looking for proper holy pills.

As for the method of refining holy pills, he didn’t even need to think of it. With his current cultivation level, he wouldn’t even be able to refine half a holy pill.

Whatever the case, there were definitely superpowers in the Holy World in possession of some and Huang Xiaolong immediately set his sights on them.

“Devil Palace....”

It seemed as though he really needed to head over to their headquarters to take a look when he was done with the Cangqiong Holy Manor.

Several days later...

“Your Highness, we are about to arrive at the Fengning Branch of the Devil Palace.” The Departing Sword Sage stood outside the secret room and reported.

Huang Xiaolong quickly emerged. When he arrived in the main hall of the ship, he noticed a massive continent below him. Compared to the regions controlled by the Holy Heavens, the holy grounds controlled by the Devil Palace was shrouded in devil qi. Dark light filled the space around them and several ghosts and spirits could be seen floating about.

“The Devil Palace is too cruel! The ghosts and spirits roaming the lands can only form if they refined the souls of experts. With the number of creatures down there, we can only imagine the number of disciples they have killed!” Chen Zhi raged.

Everyone on the ship turned solemn as rage filled their hearts.

“Why don’t the Holy Heavens, Clear Snow Palace, and the Holy Lands Alliance join hands to destroy the Devil Palace?” Huang Xiaolong frowned.

“It’s probably because of an agreement signed by all the Primal Ancestors in the Holy World.”

“What’s that?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Yu Ming nodded and explained, “It’s true that they formed an agreement, but we have no idea what it consists of. Whatever the case, it’s a rule that Primal Ancestors wouldn’t make a move unless the situation called for it.”

“Your Highness, do we...?” Chen Zhi hesitated for a moment.

“We’re entering.” Huang Xiaolong’s cold voice rang through the hall.

The Winged Dragon Flying Ship continued to soar towards the Devil Palace’s branch and it breached the defensive restriction easily.

With the Darkness Holy Ring, Huang Xiaolong concealed the ship perfectly. The cities all around immediately entered Huang Xiaolong’s field of vision.

“One... Two... Three...”

In an instant, Huang Xiaolong managed to locate three experts with some sort of saint attribute.

Reaching out, he grabbed them and threw them into the ship. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He devoured them in an instant, and he continued to charge towards the headquarters.

Wherever he went, the experts of the Devil Palace with saint attributes disappeared.

In half a day, Huang Xiaolong had devoured several hundred people, who had saint attributes.

Even though it was extremely effective for him to refine so many experts from the Devil Palace, Huang Xiaolong knew that it wasn’t wise for him to stay for a long time. After half a day he decided to head towards another branch.

The longer he stayed, the larger the risk of being discovered by a high-level True Saint. If they were detected, things would get mighty troublesome.

As the Winged Dragon Flying Ship headed for the Purple Clouds Sea, they would stop along every branch of the Devil Palace for half a day.

When they arrived at the Purple Clouds Sea three months later, Huang Xiaolong had managed to improve his saint attributes by quite a bit.
