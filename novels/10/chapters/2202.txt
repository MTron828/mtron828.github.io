Chapter 2203: Leaving the 33 Heavens

In the blink of an eye, a thousand years passed.

It was finally time for Huang Xiaolong to meet Feng Tianyu of the 33 Heavens Race.

As it was time for Huang Xiaolong to depart, the atmosphere in the Blue Dragon Divine Palace became depressing.

Huang Xiaolong hugged Shi Xiaofei, Li Lu, Yao Chi, Fang Xuanxuan, and Peng Xiao as he bade them farewell.

“Xiaolong, once you reach the Holy World, you have to be careful! Remember to take care of yourself since we won’t be there with you!” Shi Xiaofei started to tear up.

Initially, all of them wanted to accompany Huang Xiaolong to the Holy World. However, the spatial lightning storm was truly a little too powerful, and he wasn’t confident that he could protect them all. Eventually, everyone concluded that the ladies could only stay behind.

Huang Xiaolong wiped the tears from the corner of Shi Xiaofei’s eyes and nodded, “I will. You need to take care of yourselves too...” Huang Xiaolong put his arms around them, and he wiped the tears off their faces.

No one knew how long Huang Xiaolong would be away. After all, it wasn’t easy for anyone to descend to a lower world.

If he were to return, he had to be in the True Saint Realm.

Moreover, from Wan Zhuoyuan’s memory, he knew that even True Saint experts would find it difficult to descend back to the lower worlds.

After the girls, it was the turn of the Huang Family members.

Su Yan hugged Huang Xiaolong tightly and refused to let go.

After an hour, Huang Xiaolong flew into the skies and left under the reluctant gazes of everyone present. The members of the Huang Family soared into the air after him, but none of them could catch up with him.

Soon, his tiny figure disappeared past the horizon.

Huang Xiaolong wasn’t worried about the safety of his family. In the past thousand years, he had made a ton of arrangements. As long as the 33 Heavens Race, the Heavenly Saint Country, the Mighty God Heavenly Country, and the Heavens Path were around, there was no chance of them facing any true danger.

Moreover, he had spared no effort in raising the overall strength of his family members. He had left behind a huge number of resources for them, including high-grade spiritual pills, divine pills, top-grade chaos spirit stones, origin treasures, etcetera. The Huang Family didn’t lack anything. With the resources Huang Xiaolong had left for them, he was confident that they would break through to the Emperor Realm. There was even a chance for them to enter the Sovereign Realm!

When the Blue Dragon Heavenly Country could no longer be seen, Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He headed straight for the space outside the 33 heavens.

Whatever the case, he had agreed to meet Feng Tianyu at the 33 Heavenly Gates.

When Huang Xiaolong entered the space outside the 33 heavens, he didn’t summon the Grandmist Lightning Pool. Instead, he rode on the Golden Pig Treasure, and he cleaved a path through the chaotic bolts of lightning.

In the past thousand years, Huang Xiaolong had searched the entire Heavens Path for purple grandmist aura in order to further his progress in the Grandmist Parasitic Medium. With his efforts, he had managed to reach the tenth layer of the Grandmist Parasitic Medium while pushing his cultivation all the way to the early-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm. He wouldn’t be afraid of the lightning spiritual qi with his current strength even without the Grandmist Lightning Pool.

It didn’t take long for him to cross the space.

Soon, the 33 heavens disappeared from his sight.

Feng Tianyu and Feng Yao were standing before the 33 Heavenly Gates as they waited patiently for Huang Xiaolong’s arrival.

When they felt the overwhelming aura behind them, they turned to face Huang Xiaolong.

“Greetings, Master Huang Xiaolong!” Feng Yao turned around quickly and greeted.

“Brother Huang!” Feng Tianyu smiled.

Huang Xiaolong smiled and bowed towards the two of them.

“It looks like Brother Huang’s current strength is far beyond my reach.” Feng Tianyu laughed, “Even if we join hands, we won’t be able to challenge Brother Huang.”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and laughed, “Brother Tianyu, you don’t have to be modest. You’ve already reached the half-step Venerable Realm. When we arrive in the Holy World, it won’t take long for you to break through to the Venerable Realm!”

Feng Tianyu was already a half-step Venerable. Due to the restrictions in the lower world, he wasn’t able to enter the Venerable Realm for real. His deep accumulations throughout the billions of years were enough for him to enter the Venerable Realm the moment he entered the Holy World!

Feng Tianyu laughed, “Even after entering the Venerable Realm, I won’t be Brother Huang’s match.”

In the past thousand years, Huang Xiaolong and Feng Tianyu had exchanged pointers frequently. Their battles could last up to several days and the two of them were extremely familiar with each other’s strength.

Of course, Feng Tianyu wasn’t being modest. Even if he were to enter the Venerable Realm, he wouldn’t be Huang Xiaolong’s match.

Despite the fact that Huang Xiaolong was only at the early-Ninth Order Sovereign Realm, he had three complete dao saint godheads and three saint bloodlines. With his saint physique, it was more than enough to suppress a First Order Venerable.

They laughed and bantered for quite some time before turning to look at the 33 Heavenly Gates. Turning to look at each other, they realized that they were thinking of the same thing. In unison, they took a step towards the gate.

The two of them stood still in front of the 33 Heavenly Gates.

“Yao’er, the 33 Heavens Race will depend on you in the future!” Feng Tianyu turned around and continued, “You and the Huang family must support each other!”

“Don’t worry father!” Feng Yao’s eyes reddened as he kowtowed. Who knew how long it would be before he could see his father again.

Following which, lightning flashed above Huang Xiaolong’s head and the Grandmist Lightning Pool appeared. As Huang Xiaolong commanded the pool to crash against the gate, resplendent rays of light emerged and blinded Feng Yao.

The lightning spiritual qi from the 33 Heavenly Gates grew more and more intense and lasted for several minutes. However, a gap slowly appeared in the middle of the gate and not too long after, the gates started to creak open.

When the gates finally opened, a spatial vortex appeared as it spat out berserk lightning qi. Despite their strength, Huang Xiaolong and Feng Tianyu felt their scalps going numb when they felt the destructive might of the lightning bolts coming from behind the gate.

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath and then summoned the lightning bead he had obtained in the Barbarian Space in the Divine World. Feng Tianyu summoned an enormous lightning flower that was covered in layers of pulsating lightning bolts.

“Let’s go!”

Huang Xiaolong and Feng Tianyu leaped into the spatial vortex at the same time.

The moment they entered, terrifyingly strong bolts of lightning shot towards Huang Xiaolong. Wave after wave slammed into him and Huang Xiaolong felt as though he had fallen into an endless sea of lightning.

Inside the endless sea of lightning, Huang Xiaolong reacted quickly as he tried to activate the Grandmist Lightning Pool. To his horror, he failed to detect the presence of the Grandmist Lightning Pool.

In fact, he couldn’t even sense the general location of the Grandmist Lightning Pool, and it was as though it had assimilated itself into the sea of lightning.

Fortunately, he was still protected by the lightning bead, and he was able to resist the waves of lightning bolts rushing towards him.

Unable to rely on the Grandmist Lightning Pool, Huang Xiaolong summoned the next best thing, and the four great divine fires appeared beside him.

“Brother Tianyu!” Huang Xiaolong yelled as he headed deeper and deeper into the sea of lightning.

“I’m here!” Feng Tianyu’s voice echoed out intermittently from afar. Due to the deafening roar of thunder, they knew that they wouldn’t be able to hear each other clearly even if they were to shout till their throats ran dry. Huang Xiaolong decided to move in the direction of Feng Tianyu’s voice the moment he heard it.
