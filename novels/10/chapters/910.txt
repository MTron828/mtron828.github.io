Chapter 911: Zhou Yao’s Talent Is Actually This Amazing!

Before the excited eyes of the large crowd, a shocking burst of devil qi was released from Mo Su’s body, sweeping out in all directions.

Sensing the soaring devil qi, the cultivators who came to challenge the Hellion Tower tensed up, and so did the crowd.

Several disciples who were dissatisfied with Mo Su’s arrogance, such as Zhou Yao and Jiang Xiaosu, now had deep fear in the depths of their eyes.

Although Zhou Yao and Jiang Xiaosu couldn’t see through Mo Su’s true strength, they could still roughly estimate that his strength had entered the high-level Highgod Realm!

Mo Su laughed, enjoying the shocked expressions on the crowd’s faces, then he gathered a small amount of godforce in his palm and pressed it against the Hellion Tower’s entrance. Almost instantly, the entrance to the first floor released a brilliant light. He then turned into a streak of light, flying into the Hellion Tower.

After Mo Su disappeared into the entrance, the Hellion Tower’s first floor emitted a bright light. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The ancient devil race symbols on the walls of the first floor glimmered, emitting a mysterious force.

After Mo Su entered, another devil clan disciple followed, until all of the registered devil clan disciples entered. Only then was it the human race disciples’ turn, but because challenging the Hellion Tower relied on one’s talent and had nothing to do with the time one entered the tower, none of the human cultivators raised any objections.

Shortly, Zhou Yao, Jiang Xiaosu, and Lu Dongwei disappeared into the Hellion Tower one by one.

Seeing that Zhou Yao and a number of other people had already entered, Huang Xiaolong was about to step up to the line when the second floor of the Hellion Tower emitted a bright light, causing the ancient devil race symbols inscribed on the walls to glimmer brightly.

Huang Xiaolong was surprised by this.

“It’s Devil Son Mo Su! He actually reached the second floor in such a short time!”

“So fast, he has only entered for a few minutes! It is said that his Ancestor, the Devil King of that year, took more than twenty minutes to pass the first floor. Does this mean that Mo Su’s talent is higher than his Ancestor?!”

“The usual amount of time the other genius disciples take to pass the first floor is about one month, yet this Mo Su took less than ten minutes, amazing!”

The spectating crowd gasped and exclaimed loudly.

The cultivators who had yet to enter the tower were shocked.

Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered, but there were no changes to his expression as he reached the entrance. Godforce swirled in his palm as placed it against the tower walls, followed by a great suction force pulling Huang Xiaolong into the Hellion Tower.

The scene in front of Huang Xiaolong changed in an instant, arriving at an empty plain. Before he could take a look around, a burst of light shone right above him, condensing into a group of ten devils.

Their bodies were entirely black, with devil qi floating on the surface of their skin. Two bat-like wings grew out from their backs, while their eyes were crimson red; each of them held a long black blade in their hands.

Those long black blades were formed from pure concentrated black devil qi, with devil race characters moving on their surface.

The moment those winged devils appeared, they started raining attacks on Huang Xiaolong.

However, their strength wasn’t that high, the leader was just a mid-First Order Highgod Realm while the rest were between early First Order to peak early First Order Highgod Realm.

Huang Xiaolong’s current bone-age was less than three hundred years. According to what he knew, the power of the devils created by the Hellion Tower was based on the challenger’s skeletal age.

On average, the top one thousand disciples in the Highgod Advancement Tournament would at least have a cultivation between early to peak early First Order Highgod Realm at the age of three hundred. Hence, those top one thousand geniuses would be able to pass the first floor of Hellion Tower after some arduous effort.

Watching the ten devils attacking him, Huang Xiaolong lightly blew out. The light element godforce he emitted spun into a twister, pulling the devils inside, reaping their lives and turning them into pure energy to be swallowed by Huang Xiaolong.

“Such pure underworld energy!” Huang Xiaolong exclaimed in surprise after absorbing the purified energy.

This level of pure underworld energy wasn’t any lower than the shimmering gray energy gathered by the combined four divine fires.

What kind of treasure was this Hellion Tower? It was actually able to channel such pure underworld energy!

In the next second, another bright light shone above Huang Xiaolong like a gate, sending over the second wave of devils.

This time, twenty devils appeared with two leaders of mid-First Order Highgod Realm, the rest had cultivations between early and peak early First Order Highgod Realm. This time, Huang Xiaolong directly used his Innumerable Buddha Supreme Godhead’s light element godforce and Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power, pulling those devils toward himself.

In the blink of an eye, they were cleanly devoured by Huang Xiaolong.

After he dealt with the twenty devils, another burst of light appeared above the plains as the third wave emerged. It was a group of thirty devils with three mid-First Order devils as leaders.

As if settled into a pattern, Huang Xiaolong completely devoured this group of thirty devils in the blink of an eye.

Then the fourth wave appeared; forty devils, four of them having mid-First Order Highgod Realm strength. Wave after wave passed, and soon the tenth wave appeared, which had ten mid-First Order Highgod Realm leaders.

From what the Ascending Moon Old Man told him, there was a total of ten waves on the first floor. In other words, this was the last wave of devils he would need to kill before passing through to the second floor. Huang Xiaolong still defeated them by directly ‘devouring’ them.

When the tenth wave of devils was gone, the sky above the plains no longer released any light, but a shocking amount of spiritual energy flowed out like a river from the space above, nearly drowning Huang Xiaolong.

This was the reward for passing the first floor!

Every gulp of this astonishing spiritual energy was equivalent to the energy contained within a two-million-year-old medicinal herb. This astonishing amount of spiritual energy flowing at him was no different from tens of thousands of two-million-year-old medicinal herbs raining down on him from the sky.

Huang Xiaolong wasted no time in accelerating his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power, swallowing this energy madly.

In a dozen breaths, every last strand of spiritual energy went straight into his body.

The spiritual energy rewarded on the first floor could last for a day’s time, however, in one day’s time, the average disciple could barely manage to refine one-millionth of it, perhaps even less.

What Huang Xiaolong did, cleanly devouring all the spiritual energy in a few short breaths’ of time was unheard of.

Huang Xiaolong did not rush to the second floor. Instead, he sat down cross-legged in meditation for one hour before walking toward the end of the plains, entering the pathway connected to the second floor.

When he stepped into the second floor, the ancient devil race characters on the external walls of the second floor glimmered brightly.

Watching this, the spectating crowd was in an uproar.

“Someone actually passed through to the second floor!”

“In a little over an hour! Could it be the Highgod Advancement Tournament’s third-placed Zhou Yao? This Zhou Yao’s talent is actually this amazing!”

For a second, Zhou Yao was the topic on everyone’s mouth.

Some Zhou Clan disciples waiting outside the tower were proudly beaming.

“I didn’t expect this Zhou Yao’s talent to be so high, it looks like we’ve underestimated him.” Outside the tower, an ancient devil clan Elder named Mo Shirong muttered with a frown.

“Although this Zhou Yao might be highly talented, he’s still far from being in the same league as our Devil Son.” Another Elder disagreed, “The highest he could reach is probably the fifth floor.”

Huang Xiaolong was ignorant of the uproar he caused. After stepping into the second floor, he came to a primitive forest.
