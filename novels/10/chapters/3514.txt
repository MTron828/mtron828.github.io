Chapter 3515: Huang Long’s Injuries Stabilizing

“Huang Xiaolong, let’s see what you’re hiding…” Yu Long’s voice was cold.

Since Huang Xiaolong could leave the Dragon’s Impasse unharmed while saving five Gods of Creation, Yu Long became interested in the secrets he was hiding. Moreover, he even got the little dragon to follow him like an obedient child!

Yu Long tore through the restrictions around the river of light, and he entered a multi-colored world the moment he did. There was nothing but light, and they swirled around without following the laws of the universe. A frown formed on Yu Long’s face as he realized that the innate formations around the river of light were changing positions with the different rays.

As a golden flame emerged from Yu Long’s body, he blew a massive hole through the river of light. He released his dao soul to look for traces of Huang Xiaolong and Pangu, but he failed to do so with the interference of the light.

“Huang Xiaolong, even if I can’t find you now, I’ll wait outside the river of light! Humph! Let’s see how you escape!” A sneer left Yu Long’s lips as he retreated out of the river of light.

When that was happening, Huang Xiaolong brought Pangu and the others towards the Golden Radiant World. They shuttled through space, and they saw the massive world sitting before them after several days of travel.

Pangu and the others were dumbstruck when they saw the entrance to the world.

“Is this… Is this a natural world?!” Huang Long asked.

Huang Xiaolong nodded and chuckled, “Yes. It’s called the Golden Radiant World.”

“How can there be an undiscovered world in the Star Dragon Universe?!” Pangu gasped. In the past, he had remained in the Star Dragon World for some time, and he never heard of anything like it.

“The existence in the Dragon Eyes Cliff told me about its location,” Huang Xiaolong explained. “No one else in the universe other than us knows of its location.”

“There’s an object here that can stabilize my father’s condition,” Huang Xiaolong continued.

Pangu and the others were curious. If Huang Xiaolong said that the Star Dragon Essence wasn’t enough to stabilize Huang Long’s injuries, what else could there be in the Golden Radiant World?

Several moments later, all of them entered the world.

Even though the World of Departed Souls in the Blazing Dragon Universe only allowed existences below the God of Creation Realm to enter, the Golden Radiant World had no such restriction.

As soon as they entered, Huang Xiaolong left for the core of the world.

The moment he refined the formation in the core of the Golden Radiant World, looking for the Star Dragon Divine Tree would be a walk in the park.

Several months later…

Huang Xiaolong arrived at the core of the world, and he summoned the four universe origin fires.

…

Several years passed in the blink of an eye.

When Huang Xiaolong arrived at a specific space within the Golden Radiant World, he was greeted with the sight of a giant tree. The tree was indescribably large, and star dragon qi could be seen surrounding the tree. They transformed into tiny Star Dragons that danced about the trunk of the giant tree.

Huang Xiaolong tried to suppress the excitement in his heart when he looked at the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

That was a universe-level treasure, and it was the only one of its level in the Star Dragon Universe!

According to the universe, the little dragon’s parents were born from the star dragon qi surrounding the tree!

One could only imagine how precious the divine tree was based on that fact itself!

As Huang Xiaolong arrived on a branch near the crown of the tree, he realized that the branch alone was as large as a creed in the ordinary universe.

The area covered by a creed was insanely large, but one could fit countless creeds onto the tree if they so wished!

Sucking in a cold breath, Huang Xiaolong circulated the Soaring Dragon Art, Blazing Dragon Grand Art, and Pangu World Creation Art. He started the refinement of the divine tree.

The refinement process went exceedingly well, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t know if it was due to the three creation-level art he practiced, or the presence of the Huang Long Bloodline in his body.

In four years, Huang Xiaolong managed to refine the Star Dragon Divine Tree, and he controlled the star dragon qi around it.

Stretching his arms out, the massive tree shrank to the size of his fist.

Holding the sparkling Star Dragon Divine Tree in his hand, a smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. He might only have gained an initial understanding of the tree, but it wouldn’t be a problem to use the star dragon qi to help his father.

Half a month later, Huang Xiaolong reunited with the others. He summoned the tree, and Pangu gasped in shock.

“This.. This… This is the Star Dragon Divine Tree!”

As an existence at the peak of the God of Creation Realm, he knew that every universe would possess a unique treasure.

The Star Dragon Divine Tree was the universe-level treasure of the Star Dragon Universe, and peak-grade creation artifacts were like trash before it.

The little dragon was equally as shocked to discover the Star Dragon Divine Tree.

“This is the tree my parents have been talking about…” The little dragon looked at the tiny tree with a sparkle in his eyes.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even though his parents were born from the tree, they had no idea where it was. They had been looking for the tree since a long time ago as it would greatly increase their chances of breaking through.

As for Ao Shenghai and the others, they looked at the tree in stunned silence.

Huang Long might not know what the Star Dragon Divine Tree was, but he knew that it was an absolute treasure after looking at their reaction.

“Is this what you were looking for to stabilize my condition?” Huang Long asked.

Pangu roared at the side, “Yes, yes it is!”

Huang Xiaolong hadn’t even said anything, and he could only reveal a helpless smile.

As Ao Shenghai and the others nodded at the side, they were in complete agreement with Pangu.

“Let’s look for a place to treat your injuries,” Huang Xiaolong chuckled.

“Alright!” Huang Long could no longer wait. After all, he had suffered for a long time ever since Huang Sheng devoured his bloodline.

It didn’t take long for them to locate a sacred land.

Huang Xiaolong summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree, and he gathered the star dragon qi into his palm. It slowly grew to the size of a storm as it battered against Huang Long’s body.

In just several hundred years, the injuries that plagued Huang Long started to show signs of stabilizing. The color returned to his face, and the sickly appearance was gone!

Slowly getting to his feet, Huang Long waved his fist and the void trembled.

“Nice!” A smile appeared on Huang Long’s face.

Even though he wasn’t fully recovered, he knew that fighting would no longer pose a problem now that his injuries would not worsen.
