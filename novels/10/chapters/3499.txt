Chapter 3500: Dragon’s Impasse

Huang Xiaolong turned his head to look at Luo Feng. He asked in an indifferent voice, “Are you planning to stop me?” Even so, Huang Xiaolong didn’t release his grip.

Luo Feng opened his mouth slightly, and he eventually croaked, “I was planning to remind you about Shan Fei’s origins. He has a massive backing, and it wouldn’t be wise for you to offend him.”

He might be an examiner, but his strength was comparable to Lu Qianqian at best. He knew how strong Huang Xiaolong was when he barged through the entire library. He knew that even if he used everything he had, he wouldn’t be able to stop Huang Xiaolong.

“You won’t have to worry about this,” Huang Xiaolong muttered.

A frown formed on Luo Feng’s face, but he chose to remain silent.

Shen Dong and the others were shocked to discover Huang Xiaolong’s domineering ways.

“You’ll regret this!” Shan Fei roared as his face twisted in anger. His body was starting to crumble, and he knew that his fate was sealed.

“Are you starting to regret your actions now?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

Shan Fei roared with laughter, “I, Shan Fei, have never regretted anything!”

“Alright. Neither will I.” Huang XIaolong sneered and he increased his strength. Shan Fei’s body exploded, and he turned into a pile of flesh.

His miserable cries filled the skies.

“You!” As Shan Fei’s dao soul flew into the skies, he roared at Huang Xiaolong with the intention to kill.

However, Huang Xiaolong was not one to put up with someone like Shan Fei. He casually pointed at Shan Fei’s dao soul and another miserable cry could be heard. Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop Shan Fei from leaving, and the dao soul soon disappeared.

Everyone felt a weird feeling forming in their hearts when they saw Shan Fei fleeing.

As the leading disciple of the Submerged Dragon Institution and the most talented disciple among them, Shan Fei was someone no one wanted to mess with. Moreover, the backing he had was something that could deter Gods of Creation at the peak of the large completion stage. He had never suffered such grievances, and he was crippled by someone who appeared out of nowhere!

Many people also left after Shan Fei.

“We should leave too…” Shen Dong glanced at Huang Xiaolong before bringing his group of core disciples away.

Eventually, half the crowd left.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind, and he approached Huang Long.

“Seems like we won’t be able to live the quiet life we wanted…” Huang Long chuckled.

Even though they had no idea who Shan Fei’s masters were, they were definitely experts in the God of Creation Realm.

“It’s great to make things more lively.” Huang Xiaolong smiled. “After all, I can’t always remain idle.”

Huang Long snickered before heading into the library.

Like Huang Xiaolong, he took less than half an hour. He took the exact same time Huang Xiaolong did.

Soon after, Wang Meiqi, Gu Yuan, Long Yi, and the Ice King entered the library. The only difference between their timing and Huang Xiaolong’s was a single minute.

Lu Qianqian didn’t know what to say when Luo Feng announced that all of them passed.

By the time they were done, Shen Dong and Shen Shijie had already returned to their residence.

“Second Uncle, do you think that guy has already broken through?” Shen Shijie hesitated for a moment before asking.

He naturally meant that Huang Xiaolong had broken through to the God of Creation Realm.

Experts like Shen Dong wouldn’t be able to exterminate Shan Fei’s body even if they were tens of times stronger.

“I have no idea…” Even so, Shen Dong’s face was unnatural.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

From the power he showed, Huang Xiaolong was most likely a God of Creation!

A trace of uneasiness filled his heart.

There were tons of students and teachers in the Submerged Dragon Institution, but there were only slightly more than ten Gods of Creation!

He had been stuck at the peak of the Dao Venerable Realm, and he hadn’t even seen the entrance to the God of Creation Realm.

A disciple ran into the hall all of a sudden to make an urgent report. Like Huang Xiaolong, the other five with him took less than half an hour to reach the end of the library! Shen Dong stared at the disciple in a daze.

“Second Uncle… Do you think they…” Shen Shijie felt his throat going dry.

“There’s no way! Impossible! They might just understand the art of formations! That’s right! That’s definitely the case!” Shen Dong roared.

However, for one to cross the entire library in half an hour required one to reach the peak level in the art of formations.

That in itself was an accomplishment.

After passing the test, Huang Xiaolong and the others chose not to return to Lu Qianqian’s residence. They went to the mission hall in the institution.

When the elder in charge of the mission hall heard that Huang Xiaolong and the others wanted to accept the highest-level mission, he picked the ten scrolls at the top.

There had always been ten missions ranked at the top, and whenever someone managed to complete one, another would be created.

However, even the six Gods of Creation felt their expressions falling when they saw the missions.

The missions were practically impossible, even to people of their level!

Huang Xiaolong finally understood why Pangu said that the missions were at an unreasonable level.

For example, one of the missions was to locate a piece of Star Dragon Light!

The Star Dragon Essence was hard to find, and the Star Dragon Light was something even more precious than that! If someone could actually find a piece of Star Dragon Light, they wouldn’t be stupid enough to hand it to the institute!

Huang Xiaolong finally settled on the sixth mission among the ten.

When Huang Long noticed his son’s gaze, he couldn’t help but shake his head. “Xiaolong, this mission is too dangerous! It’s not possible!”

The sixth mission was to locate a dragon scale on the Dragon’s Impasse.

The Dragon’s Impasse!

It was the most dangerous region in the Star Dragon Universe, and it got its name because not many members of the Dragon Race managed to leave the place alive. The number of survivors who came out of the Dragon’s Impasse could be counted on two hands!

Even though Huang Xiaolong and the others hadn’t been in the Star Dragon Universe for long, they knew how terrifying the Dragon’s Impasse was!

“Father, I wish to have a go at it.” Huang Xiaolong sighed. That was one of the easier missions out of the ten as he knew that there was definitely a piece of dragon scale in the Dragon’s Impasse. Even though it was dangerous, Huang Xiaolong was confident in his ability to get out alive. A huge part of the reason behind his confidence was the four origin divine flames.

He was also sure that there were universe-level spiritual veins in the Dragon’s Impasse. He wished to obtain them to increase his strength.
