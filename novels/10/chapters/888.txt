“He was heading to the Black Warrior Institute?” Gudu Batian’s gaze turned sharp and chilling, “Then I shall make a trip there and ask that biddy Wang Na.”

While Gudu Batian was prepared to consume a large portion of his godforce to perform Greater Space Teleportation all the way there, an indifferent voice rang in the hall, “I don’t think that’s necessary.”

The unfamiliar voice was too abrupt, startling Gudu Batian and the group of Grand Elders.

Before the wary eyes of Gudu Batian, a figure slowly walked into the hall through the entrance. When he got a look at that person’s face, Gudu Batian was dazed for a second, then a bit doubtful, “Huang Xiaolong?”

This figure was naturally Huang Xiaolong.

After killing Gudu Ye, Jiang Wuhuang, Wang Dingyi, and Zhu Chu, he knew it would alert the Jiang, Gudu, Wang, and Zhu Families, thus he decided to deal with these four families’ Ancestors before they could react.

As Huang Xiaolong walked into the hall, his gaze swept over the faces of the Grand Elders present and Gudu Batian, commenting, “Everyone’s here, all the better.”

Gudu Batian’s face tightened, “Huang Xiaolong, what are you doing here in my Gudu Family’s main residence? Don’t get arrogant just because you have Feng Yang and the Ascending Moon Old Man as Masters, thinking I won’t dare to kill you. Roll out of here now! Remember, not walk, not run, but roll!”

After Gudu Batian found out that his son Gudu Ye had been murdered, his reason was close to breaking point. He was blinded by fury and killing intent, and this Huang Xiaolong suddenly appearing in his territory and saying something inconceivable like ‘everyone’s here, all the better’ incensed him further.

If it was any other person, Gudu Batian would have slapped the intruder to death without a word instead of wasting effort in telling that person to roll out.

Huang Xiaolong flashed Gudu Batian a faint smile, “And if I don’t?”

Gudu Batian’s pupils needled, “Then you can go and die!” His palm had already struck toward Huang Xiaolong even before his last word sounded, followed by earth element godforce flooding out from Gudu Batian’s body.

Affected by Gudu Batian’s earth element godforce, the entire hall’s floor crack and sank into the ground. The present Grand Elders swayed unsteadily, sinking together with the floor, few unlucky ones were even buried into the soil up to their waist.

Watching Gudu Batian’s palm closing in, Huang Xiaolong responded with a casual wave of his palm.

That seemingly horrifying palm strike imbued with roiling earth element godforce trembled and burst softly in midair, whereas Gudu Batian himself was blasted in the opposite direction as if he were hit by a sledgehammer. His body slammed heavily into the wall behind him.

The whole section of the wall crumbled, burying him in a heap of rubble.

Looking at Gudu Batian’s sorry state, the Grand Elders looked at Huang Xiaolong wide-eyed, confounded. In that moment, their minds were blanked even as they saw Huang Xiaolong approaching Gudu Batian.

“You, who are you?” Gudu Batian’s voice came from underneath the rubble as he pushed his way out, struggling to his feet. Disregarding the thick dust all over himself, Gudu Batian warily watched Huang Xiaolong.

Around two hundred years ago, Feng Yang held a grand apprenticeship ceremony, receiving Huang Xiaolong as his personal disciple, and Gudu Batian attended that ceremony. At that time, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation hadn’t even reached the God realm. In Gudu Batian’s eyes, an ant had more worth than that Huang Xiaolong. At most, he was just ordure left behind by an ant.

He couldn’t believe, refused to believe that, in a short two hundred years, that same Huang Xiaolong could grow to the point of sending him flying with a single palm.

Huang Xiaolong remained silent. He pulled Gudu Batian before him, and his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power roared to life.

Similarly to Gudu Ye, Jiang Wuhuang, and the others, Gudu Batian immediately sensed his body’s blood essence and godforce slipping away at a rapid rate, out of his control. Panic, fear, and despair clutched his heart.

“In fact, the other reason I came here today is to tell you that I’m the one who killed your son.” Huang Xiaolong spoke in a flat tone.

“You!” Gudu Batian’s eyes rounded in fury.

“Your Gudu Family will be erased from the Black Tortoise Galaxy very soon.” Huang Xiaolong coldly added, “Naturally, other than your Gudu Family, there are also the Jiang Family, Wang Family, as well as the Zhu Family.”

Not wanting to delay any further, Huang Xiaolong increased the speed of his Archdevil Supreme Godhead’s devouring power.

Almost in the blink of an eye, all of Gudu Batian’s blood essence and godforce had dried up. Then a small fireball shot out from Huang Xiaolong’s finger, landing on Gudu Batian’s dried corpse and burning it to ashes.

The hall’s silence was broken by a sharp shriek, the group of Grand Elders could be seen fleeing from the hall in terror.

Huang Xiaolong watched this without much interest, he didn’t even bother to move his hands. In a split second, more than a dozen soul force swords pierced through those Grand Elders, causing their bodies to halt in midair as if frozen, then plummet to the ground. There were no wounds on them, but they were no longer breathing.

“Should I go to the Jiang Family next or Wang Family?” Huang Xiaolong muttered to himself. The space around him rippled and his figure vanished from the hall.

One day later, a piece of news that shook the whole Black Tortoise Galaxy began to spread. The Jiang, Wang, Gudu, and Zhu Families that had existed and grew into super forces of the Black Tortoise Galaxy in the last millions of years had their Grand Elders, Patriarchs, and Ancestors killed!

The news first spread from the Cloudsea Mainland, shocking the most prosperous location in the Black Tortoise Galaxy, which raised doubt, confusion, and rebuttals as more and more people continued to talk about the rumor, spreading it even further.

Some claimed that the four families had offended a super master, whereas there were whispers claiming it was Huang Xiaolong who did it.

Of course, there were even more people who refuted the possibility of it having been done by Huang Xiaolong. Amongst the Jiang, Wang, Gudu, and Zhu Families’ Ancestors, there must have been one or two peak-mid Second Order or late-Second Order Highgod Realm masters, hence, no one really believed that Huang Xiaolong possessed the required strength to kill them.

Very soon, another piece of news followed.

The ranking list for the this term’s Highgod Advancement Tournament involving elite geniuses from close to a hundred thousand galaxies had been announced, and at the top of the list, the first place winner was Huang Xiaolong!!

“What? The first place winner is Huang Xiaolong? It must be someone with the same name, right? It cannot be our Black Warrior Institute’s Huang Xiaolong.” When the news spread, after the initial astonishment, ten out of ten people would then shake their heads, denying the possibility.

When everyone concluded that it must be someone with the same name, even more rumors sparked discussions everywhere: it was said that, during the tournament, the Azure Dragon Institute’s Xiang Mingzhi died in Huang Xiaolong’s hands!

Xiang Mingzhi wasn’t the only one, there were also the Saint Lord Galaxy Yelu Family’s most brilliant genius in the last ten million years, Yelu Tianfeng, as well as the Beitang Family Patriarch’s son, Beitang Wuji, both of whom died in Huang Xiaolong’s hands!

Yelu Tianfeng was a peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm master, and so was Beitang Wuji.

And the one who killed them was none other than their Black Tortoise Galaxy’s Huang Xiaolong!

Not someone with the same name!

The whole Cloudsea Mainland was in an uproar!

Shocking, shocking, shocking! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

While every corner of the Cloudsea Mainland was boiling from this consecutive set of news, Huang Xiaolong was rushing back to the Martial Spirit World.

...

Inside the Huang Clan Manor’s main hall, Huang Peng, Su Yan, and the main members of the family were looking troubled and anxious.

They received news that Wang Na had taken over the Black Warrior Institute Principal position! Moreover, she would soon form an alliance with the Jiang, Wang, Gudu, and Zhu Families. No doubt, the Huang Clan Manor would be their first annihilation target.

“I wonder how Xiaolong is now...” Huang Peng sighed.

Su Yan’s soft-arched eyebrows were scrunched together, “I heard before the tournament started that there were some conflicts between Xiaolong and disciples from some Yelu Family, who even let out word that they will not let Xiaolong have an easy time inside, and that Yelu Tianfeng is even a peak late-Third Order Highgod Realm master. Could Xiaolong be...?”

Su Yan’s unease deepened.

Because they had just heard the news from the Cloudsea Mainland today, everyone in the Huang Clan Manor was still unaware that Huang Xiaolong was already back in the Black Tortoise Galaxy.

Looking at his wife’s woeful expression, Huang Peng comforted, “Don’t worry too much, nothing will happen to Xiaolong. The venue for the tournament is in the Divine World’s Overflowing Lightning World, which is too big to measure. Those people won’t necessarily be able to locate Xiaolong. Moreover, even if he cannot enter the top one thousand, ensuring his own safety shouldn’t be a problem for him...” Huang Peng’s voice trailed off, not knowing what else to say.

He knew that, even if the Overflowing Lightning World may be boundless, there were countless lightning beasts. Could his son really protect himself?
