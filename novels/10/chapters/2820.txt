The four of them revealed an expression of disbelief when they heard Aunt Qing’s confirmation.

“Are you sure it was Huang Xiaolong who did it? Isn’t he a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor?” Yi Beihang questioned again. He couldn’t believe what he heard. “Are you sure it’s him and not the Immemorial Qilins?!”

Aunt Qing knew that the truth was hard for them to take in as she found it hard to believe even though she had personally witnessed the fight. She gathered her thoughts and said firmly, “Huang Xiaolong of Cangqiong Sacred Land did it alone. The qilins didn’t appear even after the fight started.”

Since the qilins weren’t there, how could they have assisted him?!

However, Ancestor Wang Jin was still reluctant to accept the fact, and he asked once again. “Wasn’t Xu Jian’s grand dao physique destroyed by the power of absolute frost and flame? How can Huang Xiaolong use their power? Also, how is he able to use both energies?!”

Even if Huang Xiaolong possessed only one of the two powers, the Divine Tuo Holy World would tremble from shock. Therefore, it was not surprising that no one could believe that he could use both, the absolute flame and frost!

No one in the Divine Tuo Holy World could weild both powers at once!

Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing looked at each other in silence.

“This… We have no idea how he managed to control both energies. However, he actually did it!” Yi Xiaotang muttered. When Huang Xiaolong blasted a hole through Xu Jian’s chest, her mind had stopped functioning.

When she realized that they didn’t believe what she had just said, she repeated everything that had happened in detail. The more she spoke, the more agitated she became.

Yi Beihang and the others felt a trace of suspicion rising in their hearts when they heard the story for the second time.

Of course, they still didn’t believe her. That was because everything she said was too abstract! As a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor, Huang Xiaolong had managed to shatter Xu Jian’s grand dao physique without the use of any external help! That in itself was unbelievable, but the presence of the absolute flame and frost made everything even more confusing.

Even if she repeated her story to everyone in the Divine Tuo Holy World, including the peak experts at the Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable Realm, no one would believe her!

Turning to the other experts of the Saint Devil Sacred Land, the four of them continued their questioning.

When they were finally done, they stared at each other in disbelief. Their stories were exactly the same as Yi Xiaotang and Aunt Qing!

From what they were hearing, Huang Xiaolong, a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor, had dealt with Xu Jian using several punches!

With the power of absolute frost and flame, Huang Xiaolong had ended the battle and shattered the other party’s grand dao physique with two punches!

The four of them couldn’t locate their thoughts for quite some time.

“Xiaotang, did you say that there might be a formations master backing Cangqiong Sacred Land?” Yi Beihang asked.

When Yi Xiaotang spoke of it, every single one of them laughed it off. Right now, he couldn’t help but second guess himself.

Staring at her father in shock, Yi Xiaotang felt that they were thinking of something completely off-topic.

During the entire battle, she hadn’t taken her eyes off Huang Xiaolong. There was no way for anyone to assist him, nor had he received help from a mysterious source!

Aunt Qing replied in her stead, “Big Brother, I know what you mean. You might be thinking that a formations master helped Huang Xiaolong to crush Xu Jian’s grand dao physique, but all of us watched the battle earlier. It didn’t look like he received help from anyone!”

Yi Beihang shook his head. “There is no way for a Second Resurrection Primal Ancestor to destroy Xu Jian’s grand dao physique. Not even the geniuses with ten high-order Saint Fates will be able to do something like that, much less Huang Xiaolong with only eight high-order Saint Fates.”

“Even if a formations master was really present, he couldn’t have possibly used both the absolute frost and absolute flame!” Wang Jin shook his head slowly and explained.

Nothing of this sort had happened in the past, and they believed that no one would be able to wield both powers!

“What if there are two formations masters…” He Yugui muttered.

Turning to stare at him, Yi Beihang was the first to shake his head.

“Impossible. There is no way that’s possible…” In the past, he haddn’t believed that Cangqiong Sacred Land had a formations master backing them. However, the events that had just played out made him rethink his assumption. However, the presence of two formations masters would never be possible. In the Divine Tuo Holy World, the number of formations masters could be counted on one’s fingers! Then, how could a tiny sacred land possess two of them?

“Bullsh*t. Cangqiong Sacred Land will never be able to bring out a formations master.” Yan San sneered. “We’ll learn how he managed to destroy Xu Jian’s grand dao physique after we capture him. There’s no need for further guesses.”

“After snatching away the Immemorial Immortal Cave from our Blue Heaven Creed, he has challenged our authority time and time again. I don’t care if he’s a genius with eight high-level Saint Fates! He has to pay the price!”

Killing intent surged out from Yan San’s body.

…

As soon as he left, Huang Xiaolong thought about Cangqiong Old Man and the others. Quickly sending them an update of his current status, he requested for them to return to the Immemorial Immortal Cave.

Heading to one of the uninhabited regions around the Silver Dragon River, Huang Xiaolong decided to refine the dragon scale before he did anything else.

It wouldn’t make sense for him to return to the Immemorial Immortal Cave as refining the dragon scale was something that could be done in a couple of hours. After all, he had fully awakened his Huang Long Bloodline. After he entered seclusion, he took one entire day to refine the dragon scale.

As soon as he was done, a location appeared in his mind.

“Dragon Fish Creed!”

Huang Xiaolong didn’t expect that the Huang Long Armor would be hidden in the Dragon Fish Creed!

It was in a sealed space somewhere within their territory!

When he thought about it, Huang Xiaolong realized that it made sense. After all, the Dragon Fish Dao Venerable was one of his father’s greatest aides. Where else would his father hide the armor?

Looking at the dragon scale in his hand, Huang Xiaolong also learned that the dragon scale was the key to opening the sealed space.

With a feeling of joy blooming in his heart, he was surprised yet again when he realized that there was a drop of his father’s blood essence contained in the scale!

That was a drop of blood that contained the cosmos energy left behind by his father, a God of Creation! It contained the cosmos laws!

If he could refine the drop of blood containing cosmos laws…

“I can probably enter the Third Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm, right?” Huang Xiaolong thought to himself.

A Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable’s blood essence might be of limited use to him, but the blood essence of a God of Creation was a whole new story.
