Compared to two months prior, the aura around Huang Xiaolong had become much stronger.

It hadn’t been long since Huang Xiaolong broke through to Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm when he first entered the Primordial Celestial Shrine, but in the short two months he spent comprehending these heritage tablets, his cultivation had risen to peak early Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm!

If Lu Zhuo, Ren Changhai, and Zhu Huan knew this, they wouldn’t be able to sit still in the hall outside.

Even though other disciples’ cultivation also improved as they comprehend the heritage tablets, it was definitely far less shocking than Huang Xiaolong’s speed.

Five days later, when Huang Xiaolong began comprehending the sixty-eighth heritage tablet, his body trembled all of a sudden. A brilliant radiance burst out from his three supreme godheads.

He actually broke through to mid-Fourth Order Heavenly God Realm!

Outside in the hall, Lu Zhuo, Ren Changhai, Zhu Huan were alarmed by the movement behind the steel door, for they had never seen any disciple reach the sixty-eighth heritage tablet. The highest record was the sixty-seventh tablet!

Huang Xiaolong had just broken this record! Moreover, from the one hundred days allocated for comprehension, there were thirty-five days left!

Whilst feeling shocked, Lu Zhuo’s laughter became more frequent. Truly, a joyful occasion lifts one’s spirit. This disciple Huang Xiaolong truly surprised him again and again.

Lu Zhuo began to anticipate the moment when Huang Xiaolong finished comprehending all hundred tablets and opened that legendary big steel door inside the room.

“Lu Zhuo, let’s have another bet on whether Huang Xiaolong can finish comprehending all hundred heritage tablets in one hundred days!” At this time, Ren Changhai spoke with a gloomy light in his eyes, bearing a taste of madness.

Lu Zhuo looked at Ren Changhai in surprise, as he didn’t have much confidence.

As far as he knew, ever since the Primordial Celestial Shrine came into existence over ten million years ago, there had yet any disciple from the three sects who succeeded in comprehending all hundred heritage tablets!

Despite recognizing Huang Xiaolong’s talent and great comprehension ability, Lu Zhuo wasn’t confident he could comprehend all the tablets in one hundred days. The chances were just too slim that it was closer to impossible.

“You don’t have the guts?” Zhu Huan taunted, sneering coldly.

Ren Changhai also shot Lu Zhuo a derisive look.

Lu Zhuo was aware that Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan were stimulating him on purpose, but he couldn’t resist saying, “Fine, I’ll bet with you guys, but what do you two want to bet?” He added in a derisive tone, “Or do you have more grade four spiritual veins on you?”

Lu Zhuo mentioning the grade four spiritual vein was no different than rubbing salt on Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s wounds. While feeling pained in their hearts, anger brewed.

“We bet our two sects’ treasuries!” Ren Changhai nearly spat out in anger. “If we lose, you can take half of the Great Whale Sect and Elephant Genesis Sect’s treasuries! On the other hand, if you lose, we’ll take your Barbarian God Sect’s treasury!”

They actually wanted to bet the sect’s treasury!

Lu Zhuo sucked in a breath of cold air looking wide-eyed at the other two people in the hall. ‘These two have gone mad!’

With the long history of their three sects on Green Cloud Island, the wealth in their treasuries was far from being able to compare to a mere few grade four spiritual veins.

They had only bet grade four spiritual veins earlier, which was still acceptable to Lu Zhuo, but betting the sect’s treasury was a stake too high for his tolerance, scaring him.

“What? You really don’t dare?” Zhu Huan snickered disdainfully.

“Timid as a mouse.” Ren Changhai added fuel to the fire.

Hesitation flickered back and forth on Lu Zhuo’s face.

“Fine, since you two dared to bet, why wouldn’t I dare?” Lu Zhuo gritted his teeth and agreed in a spur, “I’ll bet!”

Zhu Huan laughed merrily, “Good, Brother Lu Zhuo’s courage is admirable!”

“Then, let us three make a blood oath!” Ren Changhai grinned. He was afraid Lu Zhuo would go back on his back later after he lost, refusing to take out the Barbarian God Sect’s treasury. However, if a blood oath was made, he couldn’t renege on his promise even if he wanted to.

Blood oath! Lu Zhuo’s face tightened.

Before he could do anything, both Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan had begun the blood oath ritual following the ancient method, forcing out a drop of their own blood essence and drawing a mysterious symbol with it as ink.

“Brother Lu Zhuo, your turn!” Zhu Huan urged.

Lu Zhuo’s face was darker than muddy water, but he too squeezed out a drop of blood essence, flicking it into the mysterious symbol drawn by Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan.

After Lu Zhuo’s blood essence had completely blended into the symbol, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan began chanting an old incantation invoking the blood oath. The mysterious blood symbol flashed bright red, splitting into three streaks of light that flew into the three people’s bodies.

Lu Zhuo was already feeling regretful the moment he saw the blood-red light flying toward him. If he lost, he would be reduced to a pauper overnight. At that time, the hundreds of thousands of Barbarian God Sect disciples would spit on him behind his back.

Noticing the obvious regret on Lu Zhuo’s face, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan exchanged a gloating smile.

“Brother Lu Zhuo, I really didn’t expect you to be so foolish as to take the Barbarian God Sect’s entire treasury out as bet stakes!” Ren Changhai erupted in malicious laughter. “Tell me, you really think Huang Xiaolong will be able to comprehend all heritage tablets in a hundred days?”

“For the last ten million years, the highest record was sixty-seven heritage tablets, I don’t believe this Huang Xiaolong can comprehend all of them in a hundred days!” Zhu Huan threw his back in laughter. He then looked at Ren Changhai, saying, “Brother Changhai, I heard there are quite a few treasures inside the Barbarian God Sect’s treasury!”

Ren Changhai chuckled in good mood, “Soon, it will all be ours. If the Barbarian God Sect founder knew that Brother Lu Zhuo actually lost the whole treasury in a bet, he’d probably die again from anger in the underworld!”

Two sounds of laughter reverberated in the hall.

Lu Zhuo interjected solemnly, “Isn’t it too early for you two to celebrate?”

“Hehe” Zhu Huan snickered, “I don’t think so.”

Lu Zhuo didn’t say anything further, nervously watching the the steel door leading to Huang Xiaolong’s room.

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan also placed their attention on it. Contrary to Lu Zhuo’s anxiety, the two were much more relaxed. However, when they saw the steel door shining brightly once every day, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan’s calm and relaxed demeanor gradually vanished.

By the time another twenty days passed and Huang Xiaolong had reached the ninetieth heritage tablet, their expressions were as ugly as they could be.

Lu Zhuo who had been dismal and regretful recovered his spirits, his eyes grew brighter as Huang Xiaolong progressed.

“The ninety-first tablet!” When room number one steel door once again released a radiant light, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan clenched their fists so hard that their the knuckles turned white, fury spewing from their eyes.

In less than a day’s time, there was movement from Huang Xiaolong’s room again.

“The ninety-second tablet!” Lu Zhuo’s face was ruddy with excitement.

“Ninety-third!”

“Ninety-fourth!”

...

When Huang Xiaolong reached the ninety-ninth heritage tablet, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan jumped to their feet, roaring in fury, “Impossible! Impossible! How did he do it?! I refuse to accept this!”

Although Huang Xiaolong had just reached the ninety-ninth heritage tablet, there were still four days left.

Four days!

At Huang Xiaolong’s speed, reaching the hundredth heritage tablet was a certainty!

Lu Zhuo chuckled, “You don’t accept it? Do both of you want to go back on your word? Should I remind you that we made a blood oath?”

Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan turned horribly pale.

Blood oath!

“However, I need to thank the both of you instead for suggesting the blood oath ah.” Lu Zhuo finally burst out laughing, “Otherwise, I could really do nothing if the two of you refused to pay up.”

At this moment, Ren Changhai and Zhu Huan looked like they were about to vomit blood. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The sect’s treasury! Half of the Elephant Genesis Sect and Great Whale Sect’s treasury! How many hundreds of millennia of accumulation, blood, and sweat was that?!
