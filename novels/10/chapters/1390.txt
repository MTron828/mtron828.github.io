Xiang Xun and void devil beast Xu Baisheng wanted to chase after the Blood Wolf Gang’s Head, but before they could do that, glaring lights burst out from the remaining seventy to eighty flying ships. These lights were composed of numerous formations, canons, and violent light beams, as they shot out almost simultaneously at Huang Xiaolong’s group.

Seeing this Xiang Xun bellowed, and spat out a giant black fireball. This was Xiang Xun’s Black Infernal Divine Fire.

All canons, violent light beams, sword qi, and everything else were destroyed wherever the Black Infernal Divine Fire swept through. A dozen or so flying ships that were too slow to avoid it were contaminated with Xiang Xun’s Black Infernal Divine Fire. In an instant, the flying ships’ defensive barriers were burned away leaving a burnt holes in the flying ships.

In the blink of an eye, the dozen flying ships were filled with holes.

Screams could be heard from all directions as the pirates ran out from the flying ships in panic, but they were incinerated into ashes by the Black Infernal Divine Fire.

Watching this, the rest of the space pirates felt their blood run cold and their minds were jarred awake, and all of them turned around their ships and sped away.

“Chase!” Huang Xiaolong ordered coldly.

Everyone swiftly returned to the Giant Shark Flying Shark’s control hall.

Huang Xiaolong made a grabbing gesture and spiritual energy swirled and condensed inside the pieces of high grade seven spirit stones from the depths of the void. Ten thousand pieces of high grade seven spirit stones were placed into the flying ship’s formation in the blink of an eye.

The formation roared to life.

The Giant Shark Flying Ship quivered slightly as its body’s blue light lit up the four directions. In a whoosh, it chased after the pirate ships like an ancient divine beast Giant Shark.

“Activate the Giant Shark’s sword wings!” Huang Xiaolong commanded.

“Yes, Master!” Void devil beast Xu Baisheng complied respectfully, and was quick to activate the Giant Shark’s sword wings, and two extremely sharp sword wings extended from the sides of the ship.

As the Giant Shark Flying Ship made a line across space. The pirate flying ships on both sides were sliced by the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s sword wings. Some of the flying ships were completely sliced into two, and the space pirates who were too late to dodge were split into half.

And the Giant Shark Flying Ship’s long fin pierced a pirate flying ship’s body, and the fin rotated, forming a frightening wind vortex that pulverized the flying ship into pieces.

One could imagine the tragic ending of the sea pirates onboard the destroyed ship.

Although the Giant Shark Flying Ship had suffered damages in the past that affected its speed, the ship’s body and attack power were many times sturdier than the space pirates’ low and mid-grade chaos spiritual flying ships. In fact, the sea pirates’ flying ships were akin to thin paper when compared to the Giant Shark Flying Ship.

Soon, Huang Xiaolong’s Giant Shark Flying Ship had destroyed seventy to eighty pirate flying ships in the blink of an eye.

Shattered remnants of flying ships floated in the Divine World’s vast space.

There were a lot of spirit stones, divine pills, and divine artifacts floating amongst the wreckage. These items were most likely robbed by these pirates. Huang Xiaolong decisively collected all these into his spatial ring with a wave of his hand.

“Pity that Blood Wolf Gang’s Head escaped!” Xiang Xun sighed.

When the Giant Shark Flying Ship was destroying the fleet of pirate flying ships, the Blood Wolf Gang’s Head had taken this opportunity to escape out of sight.

"Which of you know about the Gudu Clan?" Huang Xiaolong suddenly asked. He remembered that one of the three Blood Wolf Gang’s three Heads had mentioned about the Gudu Clan’s Gudu Man.

"In the vast Divine World, there are a lot of Gudu Clans, and in the High Martial World not far away from here, there is also one Gudu Clan.” The little cow stated. “This Gudu Clan is a super force of the High Martial World, even though they cannot be compared to forces such as the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace or the Fortune Gate’s headquarters. Still, they are a powerful force in the High Martial World and its neighboring world surfaces!”

The Fortune Gate’s headquarters was called the Fortune Emperor Palace.

"The High Martial World’s?" Huang Xiaolong repeated in doubt.

The little cow nodded and explained, "This Gudu Clan is one of the five big clans of the High Martial World, but it’s merely a branch of the Solitude Emperor Palace.

Huang Xiaolong nodded, then a thought flashed across his mind. He asked, “How strong is the Solitude Emperor Palace’s power?”

"Very strong. Your Fortune Emperor Palace, the Nine Dragons Emperor Palace, and Solitude Emperor Palace are the top one hundred Emperor’s Palaces in the Divine World. There are tens and thousands of Emperor Palace forces in the vast Divine World, and those who rank in the top one thousand are already a first-rank force in the whole Divine World, therefore, those in the top ten are very strong. And the top ten Emperor’s Palace are hegemons of the Divine World!" The little cow explained.

“You will know after you enter the Fortune Emperor Palace.”

Huang Xiaolong took a deep breath to adjust his mind.

Huang Xiaolong started realizing that his strength was too weak as his knowledge of the Divine World widened. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Blood Wolf Gang was a good example. He learnt that some common pirates were also the God King Realms, and the Blood Wolf Gang had three God King Realm masters.

If he had come across them alone, without Xiang Xun, void devil beast Xu Baisheng, and the others, he would have ended up dead.

Therefore, it was crucial for him to advance to the God King Realm as soon as possible, as this was the only way for him to have the most basic strength to ensure safe living in the Divine World.

Even if he still was going to need a long time before he could break through to God King Realm, at least, high-level Ancestor God Realm was within his grasp.

With his three supreme godheads and True Dragon Physique, once he would break through to Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm, he would then become capable of killing a First Order, even Second Order God King Realm!

...

The Giant Shark Flying Ship continued onward to the High Martial World.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong returned to cultivation room number one and continued to cultivate in a frenzy, and he was even frenzier than he had been before. Earlier, he had refined six Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm Sea Gods’ spirit, and there was still one peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm Sea God’s spirit left.

Huang Xiaolong summoned out his three avatars, and that sat cross-legged around Huang Xiaolong to form a four-colored spiritual energy gathering formation. The main body and three avatars strived to absorb the Sea God’s spirit’s pure energy.

As Huang Xiaolong and his three avatars absorbed the pure energy in cultivation room number one, air blasts could be heard from inside the room.

...

Time flowed by, and five days went by in the blink of an eye.

Xiang Xun and Xu Baisheng stopped the Giant Shark Flying Ship some distance away from the High Martial World, then stood respectfully outside the cultivation room number one. They did not dare to disturb Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation, and therefore they waited quietly for Huang Xiaolong.

Huang Xiaolong finally stepped out from the cultivation room after a month.

Even though Huang Xiaolong had spent this one month devouring the peak late-Tenth Order Ancestor God Realm Sea God’s spirit’s pure energy, he had not broken through to peak early Third Order Ancestor God Realm. But he could feel a significant increase in his strength.

Huang Xiaolong stepped out from the Giant Shark Flying Ship. A tiny light glimmered on his forehead as he transferred the Giant Shark Flying Ship into the chaos Golden Dragon Lightning Pool’s space. Then, he leaped onto the little cow’s back and passed through the High Martial World’s barrier with Xiang Xun and the rest following his lead.

Huang Xiaolong looked around and saw that the High Martial World’s airspace was busy with various forces’ flying ships flying in all directions.

On the other hand, there was a faint fire element aura coming up from the ground. This fire element aura was likely due to someone triggering the fire element energy that was being used for forging.

After a brief stop, Huang Xiaolong’s group flew towards the biggest mainland in the High Martial World. Three days later, Huang Xiaolong’s group reached the Martial Dragon Mainland.
