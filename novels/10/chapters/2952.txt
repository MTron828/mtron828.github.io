Chapter 2953: Ice Tombs

The group looked at the towering ice peak in front of them for a while, and then Huang Xiaolong threw the Eye of Frost into the air. When the Eye of Frost reached the ice peak slope, it burst out in glaring icy blue light.

Seemingly triggered by the Eye of Frost, a bright light flashed on the slope as an icy-blue hole that was ten persons wide emerged.

Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the others were delighted, and Huang Xiaolong showed a smile.

“Let’s go inside.” Huang Xiaolong spoke, and flew towards the ice peak’s slope. The group disappeared into the icy-blue hole in a flicker.

Huang Xiaolong and the others felt the scenery before them change completely. It was no longer the icefields they had seen along the way, but evergreen mountains and gurgling rivers with all kinds of spiritual birds and beasts, as well as peaks with spiritual fruits and spiritual herbs, that one could not bear to look away.

Rich ice element spiritual qi filled this piece of paradise, giving them a cool and refreshing feeling.

“So beautiful,” Feng Yue exclaimed in awe, and Huang Xiaolong nodded in agreement. He collected the Eye of Frost from the air and returned it to Feng Yue.

Feng Yue hesitated but did not refuse in the end, and put it away for safekeeping.

“Young Lady Feng Yue, shall we separate and look for treasures?” Huang Xiaolong spoke. It was previously agreed that they would act separately after entering, and each person’s harvest depended on their own luck.

“Xiaolong, why don’t you come with us?” Feng Yue added, “There are dangerous restrictions everywhere in this Frost Eye Race’s treasury, and we have a secret method to avoid these restrictions. This greatly reduces our risks. It’s too dangerous for you to go around alone. Rest assured, if we find the treasury, we’ll split it equally.”

Huang Xiaolong smiled amiably but shook his head, “It’s alright. These restrictions can’t do anything to me.” He understood that Feng Yue said so for his own good, but he didn’t want to take advantage of Feng Yue.

In the end, Feng Yue and Huang Xiaolong had made an agreement, and if something progressed smoothly, they would meet again on the same spot three years later, and leave together.

Although the Frost Eye Race’s treasury space was quite big, three years were enough for them to explore.

Huang Xiaolong then turned and left, whistling across space. But before he left, Feng Yue gave Huang Xiaolong an ice talisman and reminded him that if he met with danger, the ice talisman could protect his life.

Huang Xiaolong accepted it generously, and thanked her. Feng Yue remained on the spot long after Huang Xiaolong’s figure disappeared beyond the horizon.

“Young Lady, let’s move on.” Elder Tong reminded, “His Highness Huang Xiaolong has twelve high-order Saint Fates, and his cultivation is now at late-First Esteem Da Venerable Realm with combat power comparable to a Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable. Therefore, as long as he does not step into that place, there won’t be any dangers he can’t handle.”

At the mention of that place, there was obvious apprehension on Elder Tong’s face.

That place was the Frost Eye Race’s forbidden land, and it was the most dangerous one amongst the forbidden lands. Most Ninth Esteem Dao Venerables would think twice and again if they wanted to enter that place.

As Huang Xiaolong had converged his aura for the entire journey, Feng Yue, Elder Tong, and the rest took it for granted that Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation was the same as the time he had battled Huang Shuai at the Creation Ceremony.

When Huang Xiaolong had battled Huang Shuai, various forces’ experts had estimated that Huang Xiaolong’s battle strength was comparable to a mid-Seventh to late-Seventh Esteem Dao Venerable expert.

Feng Yue heard Elder Tong’s words and nodded her head, “Alright, let’s go.”

Feng Yue’s group sped off in another direction. She wasn’t worried that Huang Xiaolong would stumble into that place as that place was covered with icy lightning. If Huang Xiaolong wanted to enter that place, he would need to pass a region of ice lightning. Huang Xiaolong’s current strength was insufficient to do so.

Not long after Huang Xiaolong and Feng Yue’s group separated, Ancestor Xuan, the young man, and a group of people entered the treasury space with the other Eye of Frost.

“We’ve finally reached here!” Ancestor Xuan looked around, and his usually indifferent eyes showed excitement. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“As long as we find the Holy Staff, we will have full control of this space, and members of our race can come back here to practice anytime they want.” The young man laughed, “With the Holy Staff, I am the new generation of Ice King, and when that time comes, Xu Zu and the others won’t be able to say anything!”

Ancestor Xuan nodded his head in agreement.

Shortly after, they proceeded in the same direction as Feng Yue and Elder Tong’s group.

In the meantime, Huang Xiaolong had wandered to a purple-colored mountain range.

As he looked at luscious holy herbs growing freeling on the purple-colored mountain range, Huang Xiaolong sighed in admiration, some of these holy herbs had reached dao grade. He couldn’t begin to estimate the value of these holy herbs growing on this purple mountain range, and he would bet that a top-tier creed like the Dragon Fish Creed would salivate if they saw this.

But these holy herbs weren’t of much use to Huang Xiaolong. Thus, he merely looked around and flew onward.

He had entered this place with one goal which was to find a top-grade dao pill. At his current strength, only top-grade dao pills could benefit his cultivation.

Of course, he wouldn’t mind a top-grade dao spiritual vein either.

Even better if there was a genesis level pill, but Huang Xiaolong understood that one could only hope for treasures at the genesis level. Even a powerful race like the Frost Eye Race during the creation era did not necessarily have it.

Huang Xiaolong’s three dao souls scanned the surroundings as he flew ahead, and all the ice-attributed restrictions around him could not escape his three dao souls. Huang Xiaolong easily avoided them.

In truth, he could break these restrictions with a single punch at his current strength, but it would merely waste some energy.

Huang Xiaolong flew onwards for several days until he saw a cemetery.

This was a big cemetery with the other end nowhere in sight. There were various sizes of tombs, some tall and majestic, and some only tens of meters tall, and all these tombs were built with ice stones with a triangular roof. These ice stones were rare ice-wind stones, and the lowest grade of these were holy-grade ice-wind stones.

These ice-wind stones were beneficial to cultivators cultivating ice and wind elements techniques, and even a low-rank holy grade ice-wind stone, the size of a palm, could cost ten thousand Tuoshen holy coins.

Then, how could there be a tomb over thirty meters tall built from ice-wind stones? And one could find many tombs over ten thousand meters tall!

Huang Xiaolong slowed down, but continued flying while using his dao souls to check the situations inside the tombs.

Although these ice tombs were heavily surrounded by restrictions, they couldn’t hinder Huang Xiaolong’s dao souls.

As Huang Xiaolong had expected, inside these ice tombs were the corpses of Frost Eye Race’s experts, from True Saint Realms, Primal Ancestor Realm, and even some perfection half-step Dao Venerables.

Huang Xiaolong frowned. What exactly happened to the Frost Eye Race? Why did so many of them die?

These Frost Eye Race’s experts had clearly died from being besieged by people stronger than them, and he could still see the ghastly injuries on their bodies.

Under careful observations, Huang Xiaolong found that the injuries on these Frost Eye Race’s corpses were a mixture of dragon's claw and also phoenix claws.

The Holy Dragon Race? Heavenly Phoenix Race?

“Ei!” Huang Xiaolong suddenly discovered that inside a majestic ice tomb lay a peak late-First Esteem Dao Venerable Frost Eye Race expert’s corpse!
