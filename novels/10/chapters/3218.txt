Chapter 3219: The Blazing Dragon World’s Son of Creation

When Di Xiaolong thought that Di Cangtian would immediately leap into battle to help Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao, a slap made his vision go black.

Of course, the slap landed heavily on Di Xiaolong’s face, and he felt the world spinning around him.

Grabbing his face in pain, he stared at his father in disbelief.

The experts of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire felt their jaws dropping in shock when they witnessed the scene before them.

Celestial Emperor, Di Cangtian, actually slapped his favourite son, Di Xiaolong!

There were even some who felt that Di Cangtian was placed under an illusion! Did he mistake Huang Xiaolong as his son?!”

“Father, you…” Di Xiaolong stammered.

Like everyone else, he had no idea what just happened.

A cold snort left Di Cangtian’s lips. “You’ll be punished accordingly when we get back.” After he spoke, he turned to look at Huang Xiaolong.

“Punished?!” Di Xiaolong was stunned. He didn’t understand what his father meant. However, from the looks of things, his father didn’t seem to be hallucinating.

He wasn’t the only one who had no idea what was going on. The other experts standing around were equally as clueless.

“Big Brother, do we make our move now?” Di Yu asked.

He was asking if they should make their move to save Huang Xiaolong. After all, he was the Son of Creation of the Blazing Dragon World. Regardless of what he did, they couldn’t allow anyone to kill him.

However, Di Xiaolong thought that his father and his uncles were planning on killing Huang Xiaolong.

Turning to look at them, a trace of anticipation could be seen in Di Xiaolong’s eyes.

After thinking about it for a second, Di Cangtian shook his head. “There is no need.” He could see that Huang Xiaolong wasn’t even on the losing end of the battle.

A trace of shock flashed through his heart when he realized that Huang Xiaolong was evenly matched against the two of them. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Di Cangtian was extremely clear on how strong they were, but his eyes narrowed all of a sudden as he turned to look at the void before them.

It was precisely where Huang Dinghai and the members of the True Dragon Celestial Empire was coming from.

When Huang Dinghai saw the battle from afar, he was as shocked as Di Cangtian. However, a snort formed on his lips as he waved his hand through the void. A terrifying amount of power shot towards Huang Xiaolong.

As Huang Dinghai made his move in secret, not too many people managed to catch it.

As the Celestial Emperor of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, Huang Dinghai’s strength wasn’t something Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao could compare to. If his strike landed on Huang Xiaolong, Huang Xiaolong would lose a layer of skin even if he didn’t die.

Seeing as the palm strike was about to hit, another terrifying blast appeared from nowhere and stopped it.

A massive blast rocked the entire region, and everyone stared at the space before them in stunned silence.

Huang Dinghai was shocked. He didn’t expect anyone to stop him.

Turning around, question marks formed in his mind when he realized that it was Di Cangtian.

“Brother Di, this…” Huang Dinghai couldn’t help but ask.

Huang Xiaolong seriously injured his son, and Di Cangtian should be more than happy to watch Huang Xiaolong die! However, he did the exact opposite and saved the kid!

Could he be planning to kill Huang Xiaolong himself?

When Huang Dinghai was making wild guesses in his mind, Di Cangtian sneered, “What an amazing celestial emperor you are. You even dared to make a sneak attack on someone of the younger generation! Don’t you think you’re humiliating yourself and the name of the Blazing Dragon World?”

Huang Dinghai and the others stared at him in shock.

A trace of anger formed in Huang Dinghai’s heart after the ‘lecture’ by Di Cangtian. Was the other party actually scolding him, the Celestial Emperor of the True Dragon Celestial Empire, in front of so many people?!

Frost flashed in his eyes and he glared at Di Cangtian, “Di Cangtian, are you sure you’re clear headed right now?!”

Ignoring the ugly look on Huang Dinghai’s face, Di Cangtian snorted, “Huang Dinghai, we have to do things openly. Everyone saw the despicable move you committed. Are you planning on denying your actions?!”

The experts who were standing about stared at him in shock.

Even Di Xiaolong couldn’t believe what his father just said.

“Princess, do you think Celestial Emperor Di is making sense right now?” One of the attendants behind Zeng Ying scratched her head in confusion.

Shaking her head, Zeng Ying had no idea what was going on either.

She wasn’t the only one. Even the patriarchs of the various ancient races and super experts present had no idea what Di Cangtian was thinking.

They didn’t understand why Di Cangtian was hell bent on going against Huang Dinghai!

Even Zeng Le, the Celestial Emperor of the Excessive Heaven Celestial Empire, frowned.

Things were getting too weird.

Could Di Cangtian be thinking of saving Huang Xiaolong? Was he planning on pulling Huang Xiaolong over to his camp? Could that be the reason behind his actions?

Huang Dinghai felt a trace of irritation rising in his heart when he heard Di Cangtian bringing up the matter over and over. However, a massive explosion brought all of them back to reality. In the space above, Fu Luosen and Huang Shengdao were sent flying backwards by Huang Xiaolong’s claw strike.

At that instant, Huang Xiaolong’s back was exposed to Huang Dinghai, and the man decided to make another move. Right before his strike could land, Di Cangtian stopped it.

Glaring at Di Cangtian, Huang Dinghai would have killed him if he had the ability to.

Ignoring Huang Dinghai once again, Di Cangtian and the other four experts of the Blazing Dragon Celestial Empire flow towards Huang Xiaolong. When everyone was curious as to what they planned to do, the five of them cupped their fists in greeting. “We greet Your Highness!”

Di Xiaolong felt his brain going blank.

Huang Dinghai saw the world spinning before him.

As for Fu Luosen, Huang Shengdao, Zeng Ying, and the others, their jaws dropped in fright.

“Your… Your… Your Highness?!” Di Xiaolong screamed in fright.

What the hell did he just hear?! His father was addressing Huang Xiaolong as His Highness! Why would he be so respectful?!

Huang Xiaolong turned to the five of them and nodded, “You’re here.”

?!

What the f…

Di Cangtian looked at Di Xiaolong whose mouth couldn’t close and he snorted, “Why aren’t you kneeling in His Highness’ presence? Kneel and apologize!”

“ME?!” Di Xiaolong gasped in shock.

Could it be?!

A terrifying thought flashed through the minds of everyone present.

“In the future, His Highness, Huang Xiaolong, will be the Son of Creation of our Blazing Dragon World!” Di Cangtian announced.

Di Xiaolong, Zeng Ying, Fu Luosen, Huang Shengdao, and everyone of status felt a bomb going off in their minds.
