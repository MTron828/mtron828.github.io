Chapter 2846: Could It Be He Has Returned?!

Not only Long Chenfeng, but the rest of Long Family’s disciples were also paralyzed with fear as they stared dumbly at the pieces of saint godhead Long Jianfei had shattered, along with the glimmering speckles of dao soul light.

Speckles of light drifted down from the sky, making a pretty sight.

However, Long Chenfeng and all Long Family’s disciples looked like they had fallen into a death abyss, and a chilling coldness took over their bodies.

All Yu Family’s disciples looked dumbly at the falling golden light speckles.

De-dead?

They couldn’t accept what they had seen.

They couldn’t believe that someone from the Long Family really had the guts to kill their young lord.

“You guys, you guys, how could, how could you?!” One of the Yu Family’s disciples was spewing fire from his eyes. He stared at Long Jianfei as if he could incinerate Long Jianfei with his look.

Long Chenfeng also looked at Long Jianfei in utter despair and lamented, “Young Lord, that person is Lady Yu Xin’s grandnephew. He’s called Yu Yi, Patriarch Yu Qi’s great-grandson!”

Yu Qi was the Yu Family’s patriarch before Long Jianfei had gone missing, and Yu Qi was the same person who had proposed the marriage between Long Jianfei and Yu Xin.

Long Jianfei sneered upon hearing that, “So what if he’s Yu Qi, that old fogey’s great-grandson?”

After Yu Qi had hired a Dao Venerable from the Mystical Pavilion to curse his parents and the others, he had immediately sent people to break off the engagement between the two families the moment something had happened to his father. On top of that, not long after the engagement was broken off, the Yu Family had formed another alliance through marriage with another family. Yu Xin had married that family’s young lord, becoming the young mistress.

“Also, Yu Xin that sl*t, don’t ever mention that sl*t in front of me again!” Long Jianfei ordered icily.

Long Chenfeng and the others stiffened with dread.

“Impeteous, how dare you speak the name of our Old Patriarch!” The Yu Family disciples all shouted angrily when Long Jianfei called their old patriarch old fogey while using his full name.

Long Jianfei laughed grimly as he walked towards the Yu Family disciples.

The Yu Family disciples’ expressions changed greatly, and they looked flustered.

“You, you, what do you want to do?!” Upon sensing the murderous aura coming from Long Jianfei’s body, the Yu Family disciples panicked, and their eyes widened in fear.

Long Jianfei did not speak, and he soon stood in front of one of the Yu Family disciples. Then, with one punch, his fist entered the disciple’s chest and came out from the back. This disciple received the same treatment as the golden-haired young man—one, two, three punches... The fourth and last punch shattered the disciple’s skull.

The sixth punch shattered the disciple’s saint godhead and destroyed his dao soul!

Hair-rising screams continued to ring across the streets.

After killing one disciple, Long Jianfei went on to the next Yu Family disciple.

At Long Jianfei’s strength, he could easily kill all these Yu Family disciples with one palm strike. However, Long Jianfei chose not to do that. Instead, he killed the Yu Family disciples one by one, venting off his fury, hatred, and roiling killing intent.

In the beginning, there were still many Yu Family disciples who were throwing angry threats at Long Jianfei, but after witnessing Long Jianfei’s killing spree, fear completely took root in their hearts. It was written on their faces as clear as day.

In the end, the remaining Yu Family’s disciples began to beg for mercy, and they even cried and wailed.

Long Jianfei continued to kill until the last person was dead and there was no expression on his face.

Long Chenfeng and the other Long Family disciples had grown numb during this time, and their faces were drained of blood. Long Chenfeng was mumbling something under his breath as he looked at the ground full of scattered flesh and blood.

In Long Chenfeng’s opinion, the Yu Family would definitely be outraged upon learning that Long Jianfei had killed these disciples, and at that time, the Yu Family would surely send experts over… The current Long Family wouldn’t be able to withstand the Yu Family’s wrath!

That would be a catastrophe for the Long Family.

In so many years, even though the Yu family had miserably suppressed the Long Family, the Dragon City had still remained, and the Long Family’s main residence was still standing. The Long Family hadn’t been wiped off completely.

But now!

Long Jianfei ignored these people’s faces and went straight to Huang Xiaolong, and knelt respectfully before him, “Your Highness, I am sorry. This subordinate has caused trouble for you.”

One didn’t need much brain power to know the Yu Family would send their experts over soon, and at that time, Huang Xiaolong would get dragged into the matter whether he wanted to or not.

This made Long Jianfei feel guilty towards Huang Xiaolong.

“Don’t think too much about it. It’s just a Yu Family,” Huang Xiaolong said as he pulled Long Jianfei up from the ground.

One of the things Huang Xiaolong had learned from Long Chenfeng was that the Yu Family did not have any Dao Venerable experts. The strongest person was merely a perfection half-step Dao Venerable, and Huang Xiaolong didn’t consider this level of strength to be a threat.

The foreseeable problem would be the Yu Family’s genius who had seven high-order Saint Fates, Yu Zhou. After all, Yu Zhou was the Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall Master’s personal disciple.

Not to mention that Yu Zhou was someone under Huang Shuai. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Let’s go back.”

Huang Xiaolong, Long Jianfei, and Duan Feng turned around and returned to the Long Family’s main residence. When they were passing by Long Chenfeng, Huang Xiaolong’s voice sounded, “Have people cleanup the scene.”

His voice jolted Long Chenfeng to his senses.

One hour later.

At the Monarch Yu Sacred Land’s Yu Family headquarters, Yu Shaoming was looking at the reporting elder in disbelief, “You, you’re saying, Yi’er was killed at Dragon Emperor Continent?”

Yu Shaoming was Yu Xin’s elder brother, and also the Old Patriarch Yu Qi’s eldest son. Several million years ago, Yu Qi had handed over the patriarch position to Yu Shaoming.The golden-haired young man Yu Yi, who was killed, was one of Yu Shaoming’s many grandsons.

“It is so, Patriarch,” The Yu Family’s elder did not dare to look at Yu Shaoming as he replied truthfully.

“What about those disciples with Yi’er?” Yu Shaoming suddenly thought of one point.

“All, all died!” The elder quickly fell to his knees and his voice trembled in answer.

Yu Shaoming’s eyes protruded in disbelief, staring fixedly at the elder before him. Suffocating silence wrapped around them and the elder couldn’t stop trembling because Yu Yi’s safety was one of his responsibilities. Although Yu Shaoming had many grandsons, Yu Yi was one of those with better talent. Hence Yu Shaoming was quite doting towards this grandson.

Yu Shaoming’s icy voice cut across the suffocating silence, “Tell me in detail what happened?”

The Yu Family’s elder didn’t dare to hide anything, and he hurriedly reported what he knew to Yu Shaoming.

“What? An unfamiliar young lord suddenly appeared in the Long Family? And a so-called Highness? That young lord is the one who killed Yu Yi and the others?”

There was confusion on Yu Shaoming’s face after hearing the report. In all these years, they had already killed every single of the Long Family’s young lords, and those who had survived were now lying inside ice coffins.

Since when did another young lord jump out from the Long Family?

“Oh right, Patriarch, that old man Long Chenfeng seemed to call that person as Young Lord Dragon Emperor!” the elder suddenly added.

“What did you say? Dra-Dragon, Young Lord Dragon Emperor?!”

Yu Shaoming shook as if he was struck by a bolt of lightning, and his face paled unnoticeably. The Yu Family’s elder was a newly promoted elder, thus he might not have known who Young Lord Dragon Emperor was, but Yu Shaoming knew.

At that time, the Young Lord Dragon Emperor had nearly become his brother-in-law! Could it be that he has returned?!

No, not possible! Even the Dragon Fish Creed had announced his demise, how could it be that person!
