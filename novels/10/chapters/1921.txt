Huang Kebin and the other disciples felt rage boiling in their hearts.

“Wangu Rui, you’re a b*stard!” Huang Kebin yelled in a fury. “You ganged upon us! Zhang Wei and I are engaged for a hundred years! I can’t give up on our marriage now! I won’t agree even if I must die!”

Wangu Rui snorted in contempt. “Engaged? All you have is a blank sheet of paper. Tomorrow, the Zhang Family will withdraw from the engagement with your Huang Family. Do you really think that the Zhang Family is stupid enough to go through with the marriage? Your Huang Family is about to face extinction. The Zhang Family isn’t stupid enough to get on board your sinking ship.”

“Since you would rather die than to withdraw from the engagement, I will cripple your third leg right here and now! Let’s see if you can still lust over Zhang Wei with your little birdie broken!”

As soon as he spoke, a malevolent expression appeared on his face. With big steps, he walked towards Huang Kebin.

The faces of the other Huang Family disciples changed.

“Wangu Rui, how dare you?!”

“Huang Kebin is the grandson of our family head! Our Huang Family will never live under the same sky as your Wangu Clan!”

When Wangu Rui heard what they said, a sneer formed on his lips. “Do you really think that my Wangu Clan has to care about your Huang Family’s stand on this matter?”

Wangu Rui approached Huang Kebin under the gaze of everyone present.

Mu Junyue shook his head and sighed. “If this was when the Huang Family was at its peak, who could have dared to speak to them in such a way... Right now, the Huang Family is really finished.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wangu Rui roared with laughter as he brought his foot up. He stomped viciously towards Huang Kebin’s crotch, and everyone surrounding them couldn’t help but turn their heads.

Just as everyone was expecting the sound of eggs shattering to fill the air, a miserable shriek entered their ears.

Everyone felt a wave of confusion wash over them. The person who had screamed didn’t seem to be Huang Kebin...

They turned around, and the shock before them knocked them silly.

They saw Wangu Rui lying flat on the ground, and the leg that he had wanted to use to stomp on Huang Kebin was mangled beyond belief. It was nothing more than a pile of crushed flesh.

When everyone snapped back to attention, they saw a black-haired young man standing in front of Huang Kebin. Of course, the person who had made a move was Huang Xiaolong.

Everyone stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Even Mu Junyue couldn’t help but stare at Huang Xiaolong with a dumbfounded expression. He had failed to catch Huang Xiaolong’s movements when he had saved Huang Kebin. He was even more surprised at the fact that Huang Xiaolong had dared to make a move on the members of the Wangu Clan. Didn’t he explain everything clearly to him on the way there?!

He shook his head in disbelief. Wangu Rui was a core disciple of the Wangu Clan. Now that Huang Xiaolong had crippled Wangu Rui’s leg, it was impossible for him to save Huang Xiaolong. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t be strong enough to stand up for this newfound ‘brother’ of his.

The other Huang Family disciples were no different. They stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

The disciples of the Wangu Clan mirrored their actions.

“Kill him! Tear this dog b*stard to pieces!” Wangu Rui screamed as he grabbed his right leg in his arms. He pointed towards Huang Xiaolong with his other arm, and he screamed.

When all the disciples from the Wangu Clan were about to rush towards Huang Xiaolong to carry out Wangu Rui’s order, he stopped them. “Hold up! Don’t kill him! I want you to cripple him before scraping off all the skin on his body! Tear all the flesh off his body, especially his third leg!”

“I want to make him experience a living hell!”

“After you tear his little birdie off, hang it on the city gates! Let it rot under the weather!”

“When you find out which family he is from, kill everyone related to him!”

A vicious light burst forth from Wangu Rui’s eyes. As the core disciple from the Wangu Clan and the nephew of Wangu Wudi, how dare someone butt into his affairs?! He had even dared to cripple my right leg!

After acknowledging Wangu Rui’s orders, all of the disciples from the Wangu Clan surrounded Huang Xiaolong.

“Brat, you will soon know the meaning of despair!” One of the disciples sneered. He sent a ferocious punch towards Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

“Eternal Fatal Fist!”

As power surged out from his fist, killing intent filled the air. The space around his fist started to tremble.

The disciple wasn’t too weak. He was at peak of the late-Tenth Order God Realm.

Despite that, Huang Xiaolong didn’t even look at him. He simply slapped out and sent the disciple flying. As the disciple drew a beautiful arc in the sky, everyone saw how a single slap from Huang Xiaolong flattened his face.

After his head spun several rounds around his neck, it finally stopped. He faced the back, and his face was no longer recognizable.

His mouth was wide open as a scream tried to escape his lips. However, it was too bad he died before he could utter a single word.

Everyone felt as though a bomb had gone off in their heads.

Wangu Rui, Huang Kebin, Mu Junyue, and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong with their jaws agape.

One had to know that even though the disciple Huang Xiaolong had killed didn’t possess any sort of special status in the Wangu Clan, he was still one of them! Right now, Huang Xiaolong had killed him with a single slap!

All the disciples who were about to make a move on Huang Xiaolong froze.

“You... you dared to kill him?!” After taking several deep breaths, Wangu Rui finally processed what had happened before him. He stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock.

Huang Xiaolong stared at him with an indifferent expression. “Are you blind? Obviously, I killed him...”

A trace of rage emerged on Wangu Rui’s face. He pointed at Huang Xiaolong, and he snapped, “You... you... you’re dead! Your entire family will die because of you!”

Huang Xiaolong shook his head and he stared at Wangu Rui before ridiculing. “I don’t know if you can kill me, but there is something I do know. You will definitely die today!”

It was as though Huang Xiaolong had decided what to eat for lunch when he pronounced Wangu Rui’s death.

However, it was as though a bolt of lightning smashed into the minds of everyone present. They stared at Huang Xiaolong with a weird expression on their face.

As for Wangu Rui, he broke into laughter. It was as though Huang Xiaolong had cracked the funniest joke in the world.

“Brat, what did you just say? Someone like you will kill me?!” Wangu Rui grabbed his stomach as he laughed, as though his leg no longer hurt. “Would you really dare to kill me? Are you very sure you would dare to kill me?”

Before his last word could enter the ears of everyone present, Huang Xiaolong had already waved his arm. Wangu Rui’s body was sent flying, and he slammed into a nearby wall. He turned into a human pancake in the blink of an eye.

Blood dyed the wall red.

“Too noisy.”

Everyone stared at the wall in shock. They didn’t dare to believe what they had just witnessed.

Wangu Rui was dead!

The black-haired young man had really killed him!

If Wangu Rui had learned of how Huang Xiaolong had murdered Feng Chan, the young master of the Fiend God Emperor Palace, like he was killing a dog on the street, he probably would have changed the way he had spoken to Huang Xiaolong.

After Huang Xiaolong turned around, he stared at the tens of disciples from the Wangu Clan.

They felt their legs going soft. It seemed as though no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t muster an ounce of energy to go against Huang Xiaolong.

“You... you...” They opened their mouths, but nothing useful came out.

Huang Xiaolong was too lazy to deal with them, and he simply flicked his fingers. All of them shouted instantly, and they burst apart in midair; a rain of blood filled the streets.

Only when they started to explode did the other disciples react. Everyone around Huang Xiaolong started to scream and flee.

Only one person was left on the street, and it was Mu Junyue who stared at Huang Xiaolong, dumbfounded.

“You’re Mu Junyue, right?” A smile appeared on Huang Xiaolong’s face. “Thanks for filling me in on everything that has happened.”

No matter how hard Mu Junyue tried to squeeze the smile onto his face, he failed.
