Chapter 2394: 100 Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Profound Beasts!

Huang Xiaolong revealed a faint smile after feeling the auras coming from the experts of the Four Seas Holy Gate. “It seems like the Four Seas Holy Gate is still underestimating us.”

Even though the members who had approached weren’t weak, they had only sent out a single high-level half-True Saint to face Huang Xiaolong’s group. The number of half-True Saints weren’t too many and the bulk of the group was made up with Venerables. After looking at the high-level half-True Saint, he had to be Teng Yunlong’s teacher, Eminent Elder Bi Cheng.

In an instant, they surrounded Huang Xiaolong’s group.

The people pouring out from the headquarters seemed to have no end, and they quickly filled the skies. Just a casual glance would tell Huang Xiaolong that they had activated more than a hundred thousand experts.

As he stared at the old man leading the group, Huang Xiaolong quickly came to the conclusion that the expert was Bi Cheng.

Conversely, Bi Cheng scanned Huang Xiaolong’s group of three and failed to recognize the Departing Sword Sage. Even though the Departing Sword Sage had once challenged the current patriarch of the Four Seas Holy Gate, he had already changed his appearance such that no one would be able to recognize him.

Finally, Bi Cheng locked his gaze onto Huang Xiaolong and a frosty light flashed through his eyes. “Are you the one who killed my disciple? You must be out of your mind to come over here.”

“The Four Seas Holy Gate isn’t a forbidden zone in the Holy World. Why wouldn’t I dare to come?” Huang Xiaolong continued, “Even if it is, what do you think you’ll be able to do to me? My appearance has nothing to do with your disciple’s death. I’m here to look for Lu Ding. Call him out here.”

When Bi Cheng heard what Huang Xiaolong said, he couldn’t help but roar with laughter. “Are you crazy? Do you really think that you have the qualifications to look for the Patriarch?”

Like the group of guards before, everyone roared with laughter. None of them felt that Huang Xiaolong was serious. After all, it was really a joke for a Venerable to look for a True Saint.

Even those at the peak of the Ninth Tribulation Half-True Saint Realm wouldn’t be able to meet with their patriarch, much less Huang Xiaolong!

Even as an Eminent Elder in the Four Seas Holy Gate, Bi Cheng couldn’t meet with the patriarch as he wished!

It was even worse when he thought of the Patriarch. Lu Ding wasn’t an ordinary First Heaven True Saint. He was at the mid-First Heaven True Saint Realm!

Huang Xiaolong seemed to ignore the mocking look on their faces. He continued, “If he refuses to appear, I’ll beat everyone in the Four Seas Holy Gate until he appears!”

“Brat, this is the headquarters of our Four Seas Holy Gate. It’s not a place for you to speak as you wish!” Before Bi Cheng could speak, his eldest disciple raged, “Master, please allow me to take this outrageous b*stard down!”

Nodding his head, Bi Cheng agreed. “Fine. Do anything you want as long as he doesn’t die. As for the two followers behind him, kill them both!”

He was extremely confident in his eldest disciple’s ability. After all, Feng Kun was a peak mid-Second Tribulation half-True Saint!

Since the opponent was a mere Venerable, it was impossible for a half-True Saint like Feng Kun to lose! In fact, it would probably take him a single strike to defeat the opponent!

Feng Kun bowed respectfully before heading over to Huang Xiaolong. Staring at him with a cold gaze, Feng Kun snapped, “Brat, I’ll let you make the first move.”

“Alright.”

Since Feng Kun was tired of living, Huang Xiaolong had no reason to show any mercy.

Jumping off the back of his profound beast, Huang Xiaolong appeared in front of Feng Kun in an instant as thousand arms appeared behind him.

Thousand Arm Holy Devil!

In unison, all one thousand arms slapped downwards.

Eight Desolate Holy Light Palm!

Boundless light filled the land in an instant.

Boom!

Like the guard captain, Feng Kun was sent flying through the air. He pierced through god knew how many mountain peaks before slamming into the ground.

“What?!”

The faces of the various hall masters, grand elders, and elders changed in an instant.

Even the half-True Saints couldn’t help but stare at each other in shock.

“You’re seeking death!” Bi Cheng roared as the aura around his body started to expand. A golden glow surrounding him as a golden phantom appeared behind him.

The giant phantom of a battle god raised its palm to the skies, and it came crashing down on Huang Xiaolong in the next instant.

Blocking out the entire sky with its palm, it contained earth shattering might as it slammed downwards.

Just as the palm was about to touch Huang Xiaolong, the profound beast under him welcomed Bi Cheng’s attack with one of its own.

Boom!

The mountain range trembled when the two colossal attacks collided.

Terrifying might swept through the ranks of those from the Four Seas Holy Gate, and several weaker disciples exploded into a mist of blood. Bi Cheng failed to withstand the wave of energy, and he retreated several miles before regaining his footing. By the time he calmed himself down, the golden phantom behind him had already disappeared.

Feeling the blood in his body churning, a sweet taste formed in his mouth. As soon as his lips parted, fresh blood spewed out.

The hall masters and elders around were in no better shape as they spat out mouthfuls of fresh blood.

Silence filled the lands.

Suppressing the uncomfortable feeling in his body, Bi Cheng stared at the profound beast under Huang Xiaolong. “Peak of the Ninth Tribulation! A profound beast at the peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm!”

Demonic beasts were known to be stronger than cultivators at the same level. Even though it wasn’t a holy beast, the talent of the profound beast captured by Huang Xiaolong wasn’t lacking in the slightest. It was able to suppress Bi Cheng with no problems whatsoever. In fact, one wouldn’t be able to challenge it even if they were in the same realm unless they had saint attributes ranking in the top hundred!

Pillars of light emerged from the main hall of the Four Seas Holy Gate and several figures emerged. It seemed as though the strength of the profound beast had alerted the strongest experts of the Four Seas Holy Gate. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

One, two, three....

A total of three hundred and six half-True Saints appeared!

Among them, there were eighty three high-level half-True Saints!

Out of the eighty three, there were fifty Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints! There were two of them at the peak of the Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint Realm.

It seemed as though the Four Seas Holy Gate was finally going all out.

However, a frown slowly formed on Huang Xiaolong’s face. Despite so many experts making their appearance, there was no sign of Lu Ding!

Chen Zhi and the Departing Sword Sage stared at each other quietly.

“Brother Bi Cheng, are you alright?” Another Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint approached Bi Cheng and asked with concern.

Shaking his hand, Bi Cheng coughed, “I’m fine!” Looking at the profound beast under Huang Xiaolong, he roared, “He’s the one who killed Yunlong! Be careful! The profound beast, the kid is riding on, is close to being a holy beast!”

The Eminent Elders nodded, and their expression turned serious.

“First you killed a disciple of our Holy Gate. Next, you came all the way here to cause trouble! Do you really think that our Four Seas Holy Gate won’t be able to take you down?” One of the peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saints glared at Huang Xiaolong coldly.

The Eminent Elder was called Yu Jingjian, and his combat ability was several times stronger than Bi Cheng.

However, his expression fell as his eyes widened in shock the moment the words left his lips. A look of fear formed on his face as a hundred more profound beasts appeared behind Huang Xiaolong. All one hundred of them didn’t bother concealing their aura and a terrifying wave of pressure descended on the Holy Gate.

“One... One hundred peak Ninth Tribulation half-True Saint profound beasts!”
