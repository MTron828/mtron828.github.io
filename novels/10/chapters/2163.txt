Chapter 2164: You are not Qualified

Clearly, the Giant Kun Prince meant Huang Xiaolong was not qualified to be spoken of in the same sentence as him.

Huang Xiaolong smiled faintly, shaking his head as he listened to his words.

Perhaps, the Giant Kun Prince’s talent was extraordinary. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be hailed as the number one person amongst the younger generation in Heavens Path. However, a mid-Seventh Order Sovereign Giant Kun Prince was no different than a grasshopper in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes.

The Giant Kun Prince’s face sank, seeing Huang Xiaolong shake his head with a perplexing faint smile, and an icy killing intent flitted across his eyes.

Sun Po seized the right timing, stepping out and pointing a finger at Huang Xiaolong, “Punk, what are you smiling about? Who do you think you are? Someone like you is not even qualified to be spoken about in the same sentence as the Giant Kun Prince. Do you really think that after killing Chen Tianhao and Hu Jin, you have the qualifications to be compared to the Giant Kun Prince? That’s just some idle people putting you on a pedestal. You’re not even worthy of carrying the Giant Kun Prince’s shoes!”

Sun Po barely finished his words when Huang Xiaolong raised a finger and tapped in Sun Po’s direction. In the next second, Sun Po’s blood-curdling cry reverberated in the air. A red patch bloomed over the chest of his robe as his body was sent flying back, crashing into the distant mountain.

Loud rumbles came from the mountain as boulders rolled to the ground.

The others were dumbfounded.

The Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s experts stared at the mountain Sun Po crashed into in astonishment. Never could they have imagined that Huang Xiaolong would dare to attack first!

“You actually dared to attack my people in front of me?!” The Giant Kun Prince’s was extremely gloomy as killing intent sparked in his eyes.

Huang Xiaolong’s attention was on Sun Po in the distant mountain instead of the Giant Kun Prince. “Didn’t I tell you before that I would go to the Heavenly Terror Country and hang your head on the Heavenly Terror Divine Palace’s roof. So, I won’t kill you yet. I will leave your dog life till the day I go to the Heavenly Terror Country!”

Lying amidst the half-crumbled mountain, Sun Po looked at Huang Xiaolong with fury and fear, and his depression made him vomit a mouthful of blood.

The Giant Kun Prince’s anger rose to the peak, seeing that Huang Xiaolong was ignoring him for the second time. The phantom of a great beast emerged behind him and the sky above them darkened in an instant as if twilight had descended.

However, just as the Giant Kun Prince was about to attack, a Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s general behind him spoke, “Young Lord, let me do it. Young Lord doesn’t have to take action personally with your noble status.”

This Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s general was called Zhou He. He was a peak early-Seventh Order Sovereign. Among the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s generals, his strength ranked within the top ten. Though his strength couldn’t be compared to Giant Kun Prince, he was far stronger than the Mighty God Heavenly Country’s General Hu Jin.

After seeing it was Zhou He who had volunteered, the Giant Kun Prince hesitated for a second but then nodded his head, giving his permission, “Alright, I’ll trouble General Zhou He to act, but this kid is not weak. General Zhou He should take care.”

Zhou He nodded and replied, “Please rest assured, Young Lord,” he went on full of confidence, “This subordinate will capture him for Young Lord’s punishment!”

Although Huang Xiaolong was no weakling, he was still a merely late-Sixth Order Sovereign. In comparison Zhou He was already a peak early Seventh Order Sovereign. Zhou He believed that he could handle Huang Xiaolong with his strength.

Although the difference between the late-Sixth Order Sovereign and the peak early Seventh Order Sovereign was only two small orders, the gap was akin to heaven and earth in terms of actual strength. Once one entered into the Seventh Order Sovereign, his strength would rise exponentially.

Zhou He turned to face Huang Xiaolong, speaking in an icy tone, “Punk, you’re acting overconfident. You shouldn’t have angered Giant Kun Prince, and you definitely shouldn’t have disregarded our Giant Kun Heavenly Country. Even though Sun Po is not from our Giant Kun Heavenly Country, he is a relative of our Miss Zhan Ting. So he’s considered as half a Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s people.”

“I’ve heard that your relationship with the Heavenly Saint Country is not bad. Didn’t any of them tell you that you can offend anyone but the Giant Kun Heavenly Country in Heavens Path?”

In this Heavens Path, you can offend anyone but the Giant Kun Heavenly Country!

It was an ironclad rule in Heavens Path!

Every person had to adhere to this ironclad rule. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Even existences like the Heavenly Saint Country and Heavenly Terror Country adhered to this ironclad rule.

Huang Xiaolong once again shook his head and smiled, “Among my ironclad rules, anyone who provokes me must die!”

He then looked at the Giant Kun Prince and went on, “I know what you came for. You want the Great Treasure Dragon Pill, right? You can still make it alive if you take these dog-slaves of yours and leave now.”

Huang Xiaolong’s words instantly enraged Zhou He, Giant Kun Prince, and the others.

When Zhou He and the others heard Huang Xiaolong calling them ‘dog-slaves,’ they almost could not rein in their fury. No one had the guts to call them such names.

“Punk, you’re dead!” Zhou He bellowed and killing intent erupted in his eyes. In a flicker, he crossed the distance in between them and reached Huang Xiaolong.

“God Breaking Sword River!” Ten thousand sword qi exploded out from his body with a wave of his hand. It turned into a river of sword qi, piercing towards Huang Xiaolong.

The river of sword qi was endless, with the momentum of submerging heaven and earth and drowning gods and devils in its path.

Under this sword river’s rush, Huang Xiaolong resembled a grain of sand that would get submerged anytime.

As the terrifying river of sword qi was about to perforate Huang Xiaolong, he raised a finger and tapped forward. It was merely a light tap in the air, but the shocking currents of sword qi exploded and scattered in the air, except for one ray of sword qi. This sword qi sped back towards Zhou He.

Zhou He still had not reacted when his body was pierced by the sword qi and knocked backward by the impact. He was still spurting blood as his body crashed next to Sun Po.

Shattered rocks were bombarded into the air.

Sun Po was just struggling to get up on his feet but was hit by the flying rocks and was once again buried under.

“What?!” Giant Kun Prince and the Giant Kun Heavenly Country were shocked looking at where Zhou He fell. Initially, Giant Kun Prince had thought that even though Huang Xiaolong’s strength was amazing, with Zhou He’s strength at the peak early Seventh Order Sovereign, he would have no problem suppressing Huang Xiaolong. Even if Zhou He failed to suppress Huang Xiaolong, they would at least fight for several hundred moves.

Yes, the two sides fought, but there were no several hundred moves exchanged but just one!

He was defeated in one strike!

Giant Kun Prince’s face was extremely gloomy.

His icy cold glare was fixed on Huang Xiaolong.

“Who are you really?” Giant Kun Prince questioned coldly.

Huang Xiaolong responded, “Who am I is not important, so you can scram now. If you don’t, I don’t mind making you scram, or I might kill you directly!”

“Punk, you!” The several Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s experts shouted in anger.

Giant Kun Prince raised a hand, stopping them.

“Fine, I’ll take today as my loss.” Giant Kun Prince was making an effort to suppress the killing intent in his chest as he added, “But, don’t think because you’re a little bit stronger, you can disregard other experts in the Heavens Path. We will meet again.” With that said, he led the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s experts away.

Before leaving, they picked up Zhou He and Sun Po.

Watching the Giant Kun Prince leave decisively, Huang Xiaolong was genuinely surprised. It had crossed his mind that Giant Kun Prince and his group might refuse to leave. He didn’t mind sending them off with a few strikes.

After the Giant Kun Prince’s group left, Huang Xiaolong continued onwards to the Heavenly Saint Country.

On the other hand, Giant Kun Prince’s group did not return to the Giant Kun Heavenly Country but headed to the Heaven Valley instead.

“Young Lord, that kid is too arrogant. We all can suppress him together with one order from you!” On the way, one of the Giant Kun Heavenly Country’s mid-Seventh Order Sovereign generals gripped angrily.
