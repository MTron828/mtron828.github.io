When Huang Xiaolong saw the disheveled look on his mother and sister’s faces, boundless rage filled his heart. His family members looked like beggars living on the side of the street!

Huang Xiaolong’s figure blurred as he appeared before Su Yan. “Mother!”

Mother!

Hu Qingzhong, Cheng Guotao, and the rest felt their hearts clench and their bodies trembling when they heard what he said.

One of the slaves they had kidnapped was Huang Xiaolong’s mother!

They had kidnapped Huang Xiaolong’s mother and forced her to work at their mines!

Cheng Guotao would never have thought that there was someone who had managed to hide their identity to the point where no one knew she was Huang Xiaolong’s mother!

However, reality caught up to them quickly, and they felt the blood draining from their face. They had caught Huang Xiaolong’s mother and forced her to mine for them! She was treated as their slaves, and they had treated her like how they would treat a dog on the street.

Huang Xiaolong hugged his mother before turning to Huang Min. “Second sister!”

Second sister!

Huang Xiaolong turned to the Heavenly Buddha Emperor and Empress standing behind Huang Min and greeted them respectfully. “Father-in-law, mother-in-law...”

Father-in-law! Mother-in-law! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Cheng Guotao felt his hands trembling, and no matter how hard he tried to stop it, he couldn’t.

“Wait for a moment. I’ll save father and Xiaofan before doing anything else,” Huang Xiaolong turned to Su Yan and said.

Su Yan snapped back to reality, and she grabbed Huang Xiaolong’s sleeves. “Right, right! Xiaolong, hurry up and save your father and Xiaofan! They are about to die!”

Huang Xiaolong rushed towards the two of them as they lay unconscious on the ground.

The hearts of everyone from the Earth Shattering Gang fell. A single phrase repeatedly rang through Cheng Guotao’s mind. Father! That was Huang Xiaolong’s father!

He had gotten several disciples from his gang to bury Huang Xiaolong’s father!

It’s over!

When Huang Xiaolong approached Huang Peng and Guo Xiaofan, the disciples nearly fainted from shock.

He glared at the several Heavenly God Realm disciples, but he didn’t do anything to them. Saving Huang Peng and Xiaofan was more important than anything else. If he really wanted to deal with them, he could do so at any time.

After reaching out to hold his father’s body, Huang Xiaolong retrieved the Great Reincarnation Pill.

Even though the Great Reincarnation Pill was a pill used to treat injuries, it was a grandmist grade spiritual pill. There was no way for Huang Peng and Guo Xiaofan to ingest it. After grinding a small part of the pill to dust, he fed it to Huang Peng and Guo Xiaofan.

Even though he only fed them some shavings from the Great Reincarnation Pill, the effects were shocking. Life essence filled their body, and it crashed around their bodies like massive waves.

Huang Xiaolong didn’t dare to be careless. He hastily placed his hands behind them, and he poured radiance godforce into their bodies unceasingly. He assisted them in swallowing the medicinal effects from the Great Reincarnation Pill.

The wounds on their body healed at an astonishing rate, and the wounds that were so deep that fresh blood poured out of them without end closed in a second. Under the shocked gazes of everyone present, all the injuries on their bodies closed, and even the scars disappeared. It was as though they were never hurt.

Color returned to their face, and their breathing slowly stabilized. Vitality once again filled their bodies.

Su Yan, Huang Min, and everyone else rejoiced.

Even Peng Xiao and Fang Xuanxuan revealed smiles when they saw that Huang Peng and Guo Xiaofan were saved.

Despite all of that, Huang Xiaolong didn’t stop as he poured radiance godforce into their bodies without end.

Very quickly, their bodies started to shake as popping sounds resounded through the air. The skies began to change as lighting clouds gathered.

Huang Peng and Guo Xiaofan broke through the Heavenly God Realm and attracted tribulation lighting as they remained unmoving on the ground.

Under the pleasantly surprised looks on the faces of Su Yan and the others, lightning tribulation fell. Lightning dragons fell from the sky, bringing with them the strength to annihilate the earth! It was too bad Huang Xiaolong was present. With a single glance from him, the mighty lightning dragons that were about to descend dissipated, and the heaven and earth returned to their ordinary state.

Of course, it was Huang Xiaolong who unleashed his Emperor’s will to stop the tribulation from slamming down.

Like other Emperors, Huang Xiaolong’s Emperor’s will could attack his enemies formlessly. However, he could also turn in into a tiny ax formed from primal chaos to slash at his enemies.

When Huang Xiaolong fully unleashed his Emperor’s will, ordinary Third Order Emperors would be annihilated without a single trace of them remaining in the world. There was no need to mention the lightning tribulation of a mere Heavenly God.

When Su Yan and the others stared at him with an incredulous look, Huang Xiaolong turned around to speak to them. “I’ll help you guys break into the Heavenly God Realm too.”

“Us too?” Su Yan and Huang Min stared at Huang Xiaolong with their mouths agape.

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head. Before long, everyone related to Huang Xiaolong broke through the Highgod Realm and became a Heavenly God.

All of them were stuck at the peak of the Highgod Realm for a long time. For someone like Huang Xiaolong, helping a few of them to break into the Heavenly God Realm was nothing more than raising his arms.

When Huang Xiaolong assisted all of them in their breakthrough, Hu Qingzhong and Cheng Guotao felt their bodies stiffening. They didn’t dare to move a muscle. Even if they were to fall on sharp rocks, none of them would dare to shift their bodies to make themselves more comfortable.

After Huang Xiaolong assisted everyone in their breakthrough, Hu Qingzhong felt his heart pounding non-stop. He started crawling over to Huang Xiaolong as he planted his face into the ground. “Gu An Sect Leader, Hu Qingzhong, greets Your Majesty, the King of Hell!”

As for the members of the Earth Shattering Gang, none of them dared to approach Huang Xiaolong. They kneeled on the ground as their bodies curled up into a ball.

Huang Xiaolong stared at Hu Qingzhong coldly as he spoke. “I know that you’re the sect leader of the Gu An Sect. It was you who requested for the amount of gold to be doubled. That’s the reason my parents were pushed to the limits. They didn’t get to rest as they dug non-stop for an entire month.”

Hu Qingzhong felt his heart stop beating for a moment. A look of terror filled his face, but before he could open his mouth again, Huang Xiaolong raised an arm to point at him. A hole appeared in the space between his eyebrows as his body froze in place. As he fell, his body started to disintegrate with the hole between his eyebrow as the source.

A weird stench filled the air all of a sudden. When Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the origin of the smell, he saw that the experts of the Earth Shattering Gang had wet their pants.

He stared at the trembling Cheng Guotao on the ground, and a chilly killing intent burst out from his eyes. “Leader of the Earth Shattering Gang, Cheng Guotao, are you not going to introduce yourself?”

Cheng Guotao raised his head abruptly, and he bawled his eyes out. “Mercy! Please, show mercy, Your Majesty! I won’t dare to do this again! No... No... No! There will be no second time! I won’t dare to do anything like this! Please! I didn’t know who they were!” He spluttered.

“The only thing I know is that you gave the order to bury my father.” Huang Xiaolong raised his hand once again. Cheng Guotao was sent flying, but Huang Xiaolong had no intentions of killing him. He merely wasted Cheng Guotao’s cultivation.

There was no way he would allow them to die so easily.

When Cheng Guotao landed, he coincidentally arrived beside the disciples who were in charge of the mines. Even though they had already fainted from shock, they were jolted awake by the impact.
