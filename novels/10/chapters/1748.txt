“Huang Xiaolong, I exhausted my potential to cultivate a forbidden art so that I can kill you today! Before I do, I want to personally defeat you to wash away all the humiliation you gave me!” Sun Shihai’s killing intent peaked, and he growled, “Huang Xiaolong, make your move. I don’t believe that you will be able to harm a single hair on my body!”

Thinking back to the competition, he remembered how Huang Xiaolong had slapped him, turning him into a pig head. The suppressed killing intent in his heart erupted. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

His body started to transform, and dense bloody qi surrounded him. Streaks of red light turned into a blood sea, and his body ballooned as crimson battle armor appeared on him.

Strands of golden hair appeared on his body, as though golden swords were materializing on him.

It was Sun Shihai’s Celestial Blood Ape Physique.

A hundred years ago, Sun Shihai had reached the sixth rank of his celestial physique. Right now, he had broken through to the eighth rank!

Sun Shihai’s strength increased by many folds with every level his Celestial Blood Ape Physique grew. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Sun Shihai would be able to wipe the floor with any Second Order Heavenly Monarch Realm cultivators.

After the Celestial Blood Ape Physique, another type of tyrannical energy erupted from his body. When it appeared, even Gong Sunchi’s expression changed.

“Archdevil bloodline!”

Gong Sunchi and the others exclaimed in surprise.

They were right. Sun Shihai had activated the Archdevil bloodline in his body to deal with Huang Xiaolong.

The Archdevil bloodline’s energy and might in Sun Shihai’s body burst forth, and he no longer held anything back.

He wanted to thoroughly defeat Huang Xiaolong and step on his body after his triumphant victory!

He wanted to show Peng Xiao that he was much stronger than this piece-of-sh*t Huang Xiaolong!

He pulled out his Devouring Dragon Spear as well.

“Huang Xiaolong, go to hell!!!” Sun Shihai roared, and he thrust the spear in his hand towards Huang Xiaolong. He circulated all his energy and godforce to the limit when unleashing his ultimate skill.

The Devouring Dragon Spear howled towards the heavens, and it shot out.

In an instant, it appeared right before Huang Xiaolong’s chest.

“Xiaolong, be careful!”

Fang Xuanxuan and Peng Xiao yelled in shock as the blood drained from their faces.

Huang Xiaolong looked at Sun Shihai, who was unleashing everything he got with an indifferent look in his eyes. Even if he stood still and allowed Sun Shihai to poke him with the Devouring Dragon Spear a million times, Sun Shihai wouldn’t be able to cause the slightest bit of injury to him.

With his True Dragon Physique combined with the three Celestial Demonic Physiques, Sun Shihai wouldn’t be able to scratch his skin.

Even the hair on his body was sturdy enough to withstand Sun Shihai’s attack.

However, Huang Xiaolong reached out before the spear could touch him. He flicked his finger and sent the Devouring Dragon Spear flying. The Heaven Devouring Beast phantom that had originated from the spear dissipated in the next moment. A terrifying wave of energy shot towards Sun Shihai, and he couldn’t even dream of defending himself against it.

As the spear flew into the sky, Sun Shihai suffered a horrifying fate. It was as though he was run over by a massive flying ship, and he slammed into one of the palace walls. Due to the impact’s force, the wall fell as he continued on his journey outwards, and he eventually landed outside.

Fang Xuanxuan stared at the scene before her, dumbfounded.

Peng Xiao’s jaw dropped.

Gong Sunchi and the rest stared at the scene before them in shock.

Everyone looked at Sun Shihai, sprawled on the ground outside the palace, and their minds blanked.

The two ladies looked at Huang Xiaolong, and they were speechless. He managed to deal with Sun Shihai with a single flick of his finger?!

They were extremely clear that Sun Shihai’s strength had grown explosively in the past years. They even thought that Huang Xiaolong would be the one suffering the injury when Sun Shihai attacked!

But now...

Huang Xiaolong ignored the gazes on him as he walked towards Sun Shihai.

Sun Shihai had already started crawling up from the ground, and he spat out mouthfuls after mouthfuls of blood. He looked at Huang Xiaolong in disbelief, with a face full of terror. However, he yelled in indignation, “Why?! It’s impossible! How are you stronger than me?! This is b*llshit! I am the supreme genius! I am the one who possesses an Archdevil bloodline! I am a descendant of an Archdevil! How can you surpass me?! This is not possible! NOT POSSIBLE!!”

Sun Shihai roared at the heavens.

“Archdevil’s descendent?” Huang Xiaolong chuckled. He looked at Sun Shihai, who had a malevolent expression with a mocking expression, and he sneered, “In my eyes, you’re nothing more than trash.”

Indeed. Since the start, Huang Xiaolong had never placed Sun Shihai in his eyes.

Who cared if he was a descendent of an Archdevil?

Huang Xiaolong had three Archdevil bloodlines in his body, and every one of them was of a higher grade than Sun Shihai.

When Sun Shihai heard how Huang Xiaolong was calling him trash, he raged. He was like a crazed beast as he lunged towards Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, I’m going to kill you!”

The crimson light around Sun Shihai’s body glowed brightly once again, and a terrifying might emerged from him. His aura doubled, and it seemed as though he used some sort of forbidden method to raise his strength temporarily.

Huang Xiaolong casually slapped out towards Sun Shihai whose aura had doubled.

As a massive palm print appeared in the air before him, and an explosion resounded through the air as Sun Shihai was slammed into the ground once again.

“Elder Sun!”

Gong Sunchi and the others finally reacted, and their expression changed. They charged to help Sun Shihai.

However, before they could move, a horrifying wave of energy sent all of them flying.

Gong Sunchi and the rest vomited mouthfuls of blood as they looked at the four odd beasts behind Huang Xiaolong. It was one of them who had made a move just a moment ago.

Huang Xiaolong had explicitly ordered them to allow Gong Sunchi and the others to live. Otherwise, even if a high-level Emperor Realm expert were standing there, they would be blown to pieces.

Even though that was the case, Gong Sunchi, Fang Xuanxuan, Peng Xiao, and the others were shocked.

“Emperor Realm!”

Gong Sunchi sucked in a cold breath.

The four experts behind Huang Xiaolong were all in the Emperor Realm! At least, there was one of them in the Emperor Realm.

No matter how they thought about it, they couldn’t think of why an Emperor Realm expert would follow behind Huang Xiaolong. Why would they submit to him?! Huang Xiaolong was a mere Heavenly Monarch!

Huang Xiaolong walked towards the massive crater in the ground where Sun Shihai was and said, “If I want to kill you, it’s as easy as flipping my wrist. Even if your master comes, he won’t be able to save you.”

“Someone’s talking big right now!” A cold harrumph boomed in the ears of everyone present.

In the next moment, whistling sounds could be heard as the void broke apart.

Zhou Chen, Lu Shan, and Chen Yirong appeared before everyone, and other than the three of them, there were several other black-clothed men.

Strong energy fluctuations came from all around the Fortune Emperor Palace as all the experts started to gather. It was clear that Huang Xiaolong was surrounded.

Huang Xiaolong merely swept his gaze around before fixing it on the black-clothed men around Zhou Chen.

All of them were Emperor Realm experts! There were even some high-level Emperors among them!

A light flashed through his eyes. From the souls of the disciples he had searched earlier, he knew that they were experts invited by Zhou Chen.

When Zhou Chen arrived, the only thing he saw was Sun Shihai on the ground, and a frosty light flashed in his eyes.
