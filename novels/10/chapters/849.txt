Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Looking at buildings inside the megapolis in front of him, Huang Xiaolong couldn’t guess what they were made of. The city walls reflected a faint black light, thick layers of dark clouds seemed to hover permanently above the city with lightning weaving across them like dragons.

From Huang Xiaolong’s current location, the megapolis looked like a city that rose from hell, exuding a violent killing aura that made one’s heart palpitate.

Even though he was at a far distance from the city, the overwhelming destructive force coming from the giant dark clouds with streaks of lightning exuded a pressure he felt down to his soul.

Huang Xiaolong hesitated for a second before he flew toward the intimidating city.

As he was flying toward the city, three figures were hidden close to the city gates.

These three figures had concealed their auras and presence, their bodies emitted a strange radiance that allowed them to become one with their surroundings. Even when walking right beside them, one wouldn’t be able to detect their presence.

These three were all peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm disciples from the Prestige Galaxy’s Water Clan!

It was an ancient clan, one of the few most powerful clans of the Prestige Galaxy. These three figures were part of the Water Clan disciples that entered the tournament, the stronger ones of that group, and heir current rankings were somewhere between three to four thousand.

The three of them had been hiding close to the city gates for over a month, preying on disciples who passed by. However, the three of them weren’t greedy, only killing disciples below Third Order Highgod Realm.

With the three of them cooperating, a peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm that strayed off from the main group wouldn’t be able to escape from their hands, not to mention the fact that all three of them possessed an ancient divine artifact that could isolate the space and energy fluctuations around a person. Even if they fought and killed someone, no one on the outside could detect anything, and there was no way to investigate who killed them.

Hence, even after leaving the Overflowing Lightning World, they weren’t afraid of anyone coming to find trouble with them.

In a little over a month, the number of disciples who died in their hands probably reached a hundred, maybe even more. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“His mother, it’s already been two days since a disciple last came this way.” One of the three, Lue Pang grumbled.

“Waiting like this is not a solution, I think we’d do better enter the city a few days later.” Another companion suggested.

“En, someone’s coming.” The person who glanced outside suddenly exclaimed in a hushed voice. When he took another closer look, disappointment filled his face, “Just a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm?”

“His mother, we waited two full days for this shrimp? Even if we kill him, how many points can each of us get?” Lue Pang was feeling disgruntled.

“Getting something is better than not getting anything at all.” Another person stated, “The kid’s coming, let’s move!”

The three figures flew out from their hiding place to attack.

Regardless of the other party’s strength, the three of them always attacked together. Only then would the points be evenly distributed amongst them after the opponent was killed.

While the three thought the other side would instantly die under their joint attack, the figure in front of them blurred away in a flicker, dodging their attacks, leaving three Water Clan disciples dumbfounded.

The other party was none other than Huang Xiaolong.

“Kid, you unexpectedly have some skill. You most likely cultivated some secret technique to conceal your true cultivation and appear as a perfection stage late-Tenth Order God Realm, right?” The disciple named Lue Pang narrowed his eyes dangerously, observing Huang Xiaolong.

The three of them naturally didn’t believe that a mere God Realm ant could dodge their joint attack, hence, they were convinced that Huang Xiaolong used some secret technique to conceal his cultivation.

“But I like this much better! You’re probably a late-Second Order Highgod Realm disciple? Or a peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm?” One of the three smirked, “I bet you’ve accumulated quite a lot of points, yeah.”

The three moved tacitly; one of them secretly took out his ancient divine artifact to lock and veil this area from being detected.

Huang Xiaolong did not miss this person’s sneaky movements, yet did not move to stop that disciple.

He laughed faintly in reply, “Not much, just a little over three hundred thousand points, currently ranked somewhere in the 4,300 range.”

“Over three hundred thousand!” Hearing this, three pairs of eyes lit up. As long as they killed this kid, each of them could gain more than fifty thousand points.

Currently ranked four thousand something? The three of them estimated Huang Xiaolong’s strength to be around late-Second Order Highgod Realm.

“Be careful, don’t hold back, finish this quickly.” Lue Pang cautioned his companions using voice transmission. Huang Xiaolong’s serene attitude gave him a strong sense of unease.

“Don’t worry, Senior Brother Cheng. With the three of us going all out, we’ll be able to finish him off in ten minutes.” One of them confidently said.

Just as that disciple stopped talking, a glaring sword of light pierced through space. Before the disciple could react, Huang Xiaolong’s soul force blade had slashed down on him, starting from the head.

A vertical thin line of blood emerged from that disciple’s head to his lower body. A beat later, blood spurted in the air; this Water Clan disciple’s body was split in two.

A godhead flew out and was sucked into Huang Xiaolong’s palm, then a sliver of true immortal essence fire instantly burned away the soul residing inside the godhead.

A large mass of light flew out from the Water Clan disciple’s body into the jade token inside Huang Xiaolong. Immediately, Huang Xiaolong’s token glimmered as his points soared.

“You!” The other two disciples came to their senses, but they were filled with fear.

The three of them were equally matched in terms of strength, so if this young man wanted to kill them both, it would only take one move.

‘Run!!’

Only one thought filled the remaining two disciples’ minds, yet just as this thought emerged, two soul force swords were already whistling toward them

Despite the two of them being on guard, they were still pierced by Huang Xiaolong’s soul force swords.

Those swords made of soul force were not only capable of causing physical damage, they also contained a soul attack.

However, the ancient Water Clan descendants possessed a unique soul. Despite the damage from Huang Xiaolong’s soul attack, their souls managed to survive. Two godheads fell into Huang Xiaolong’s hands and a sliver of true immortal fire emerged from his finger, cleanly burning away the two Water Clan disciples’ souls.

“So many spatial rings!” With a sweep of his divine sense over the three disciples’ spatial rings, Huang Xiaolong was astonished to discover that each one of the three spatial rings contained several dozens of other spatial rings. This was a delightful surprise.

He put all of them into his Asura Ring. Then, with a casual point of his finger, a cyan-colored bead fell into his palm.

This was the ancient divine artifact that the three Water Clan disciples used to lock the surrounding space. Huang Xiaolong did not give it more than a single glance before throwing it into his Asura Ring as well.

After killing the three disciples, Huang Xiaolong bathed in glimmering light as his points shot up rapidly, causing his ranking to soar up on the list.

At the end, his name stopped right at the 3,000th spot.

“3,000.” This result wasn’t unexpected to Huang Xiaolong. Based on the three people’s strength, half of their accumulated points pushed his rank to the top three thousand.

Huang Xiaolong’s divine sense left the jade token and he flew toward the city gates.

At the same time, at the Aeon Square.

At the bottom of the ranking list, on the last 3,000th position, Huang Xiaolong’s name appeared after a soft glimmer of light.
