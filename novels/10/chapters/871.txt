As You Wuye watched Huang Xiaolong coming closer with every step, his face became a fraction paler. Then, as if remembering something, he exclaimed, “You, you’re that Huang Xiaolong?!”

He had seen Wangu Yanhui, Fang Chu, Zhou Yao, Mu Qi, and the others, moreover, he was quite familiar with their attacks and power. You Wuye really couldn’t think of anyone amongst the participating disciples who could be this terrifying.

In that case, this black-haired young man in front of him could only be the person who had entered the top ten in the recent days, ranked 8th on the list, that unfathomable Huang Xiaolong.

“Correct.” Seeing You Wuye already guessed his identity, Huang Xiaolong did not bother to conceal it, there was nothing worth concealing after all.

Listening to Huang Xiaolong’s nonchalant admittance, You Wuye’s fear deepened. In the last two days, he had been paying attention to the changes on the ranking list, thus he was aware that the death of Yelu Tianfeng, Beitang Wuji, and disciples of these two families’ was related to Huang Xiaolong.

In other words, both Yelu Tianfeng and Beitang Wuji were killed by Huang Xiaolong!

“You...” You Wuye hastily slid backward on his butt, trying to get far away from Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong, y-you want to k-kill me?!”

Watching the fear on You Wuye’s face, Huang Xiaolong shook his head, “Although killing you will give me half of your points and my ranking could rise up to the top three, maybe even the first place, I have confidence in reaching the top three or first place even without killing you.”

Huang Xiaolong was not speaking arrogant words. He was currently ranked in the 8th place, but the gap between his points and the first ranked Wangu Yanhui wasn’t that huge. Based on his speed of killing lightning beasts, catching up to the disciples above him and surpassing Wangu Yanhui was possible within ten days’ time.

Within a month, Huang Xiaolong was confident that he could exceed Wangu Yanhui by miles.

“Then you, what do you want?” You Wuye detected a slim hope of surviving, and he calmed down a little.

“You can live as long as you sign a blood contract with me, serving me for a hundred years. That’s all.” Huang Xiaolong replied.

Soul branding was probably unacceptable for a disciple like You Wuye, and to Huang Xiaolong, soul branding or blood contracts had no difference.

“Sign a blood contract?” Hope thickened in You Wuye’s eyes, nodding in agreement a while later.

For a Highgod Realm master, a hundred years’ time was tantamount to entering seclusion for a short period.

You Wuye’s agreement did not come as a surprise to him.

Following that, the two signed a blood contract. When You Wuye made an imprint on the blood contract with a drop of his blood essence, he immediately felt a restriction of the Heavenly Laws appear in his soul.

After the blood contract was signed, Huang Xiaolong took out a bottle of pills and threw it to You Wuye so that he could heal.

“Undying God Pill!” At first, he didn’t really care until he opened the bottle and saw the pill inside. He was dumbstruck, this Undying God Pill was extremely precious. Even with his identity, You Wuye couldn’t afford to consume this grade of healing pellets. For the tournament, he merely brought a few Spring Autumn Hundred Life Divine Pellets.

Looking at You Wuye’s dumbstruck expression, Huang Xiaolong waved his hand in the air. Instantly, a pile of spirit stones fell from the void, filling the entire hall with rich spiritual energy.

“This-this, sacred grade immortal spirit stones?!!” You Wuye stared at the pile of sacred grade immortal spirit stones in front of him, stupefied.

“These here are one hundred sacred grade immortal spirit stones, the payment for your hundred years of working for me.” Huang Xiaolong stated without any emotion.

Now that he had stepped into the Highgod Realm, he was able to condense sacred grade immortal spirit stones.

Sacred grade immortal spirit stones were rare treasures to You Wuye, but to Huang Xiaolong, they were akin to pebbles on the roadside.

“Payment for a hundred years’ work...” You Wuye repeated dumbly. He now felt a bit of regret, was signing a blood contract for a hundred years a little short?

While You Wuye was still dumbstruck, Huang Xiaolong turned to look at the lightning dragon floating high in the palace hall and the bone fragments that resembled translucent crystals; his Archdevil Supreme Godhead started to quickly rotate, forming a devouring power.

Instantly, the bone shards floated down toward Huang Xiaolong, a total of a hundred and eight pieces.

A hundred and eight lightning dragon bone fragments floated around Huang Xiaolong in a circle.

Astonishing lightning force flowed out from them, drilling into Huang Xiaolong’s body from every angle.

Streaks of lightning were converted into godforce, causing the three supreme godheads to flicker brightly.

Finally, Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation, which was at peak mid-Second Order Highgod Realm, advanced to late-Second Order Highgod Realm. Still, the lightning force from the bones did not stop entering Huang Xiaolong’s body, his strength continued to rise.

Roughly an hour later, the lightning force from dragon bones subsided. Following that, the one hundred and eight bone fragments integrated into Huang Xiaolong’s body, fusing with his bones and flesh.

When the lightning dragon bones completely become a part of him, Huang Xiaolong distinctively felt that his True Dragon Physique had become even more powerful.

He breathed out a mouth of foul lightning qi, causing the entire hall’s lightning force to become chaotic and the palace building to shake with a low rumble. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Although his cultivation had yet to reach peak late-Second Order Highgod Realm, it wasn’t that far away. The benefits of obtaining the lightning dragon bones were evident.

Huang Xiaolong turned to check on You Wuye; after consuming the Undying God Pill, his injuries had completely healed and was looking at him with his jaw dropped to the floor. Huang Xiaolong understood that You Wuye must have seen him refine the lightning dragon bones.

Indeed, it was as Huang Xiaolong thought. After You Wuye’s injuries healed, he saw the scene of Huang Xiaolong refining the lightning dragon bone shards and great waves crashed against his heart. You Wuye didn’t even know how to describe the overwhelming shock he felt.

‘Your mother, those were a Heavenly God realm lightning dragon’s bones ah...’

Even a Fourth Order Highgod Realm cultivator like himself needed a decade to refine a single piece, perhaps even a few decades. But this Huang Xiaolong, just now, he merely spent roughly an hour to refine a hundred and eight! All of them!

This was fiercer than the fiercest beast.

You Wuye began to wonder if even a giant chaos beast’s devouring speed was as frightening as Huang Xiaolong’s.

“Let’s go, we must seize the time to locate the central formation.” Huang Xiaolong didn’t mind You Wuye knowing about his refining speed, he turned and flew out of the hall to go looking for the formation.

You Wuye snapped to his senses, chasing after Huang Xiaolong. A glimmer of fear appeared in his eyes as he looked at Huang Xiaolong’s back.

Two days went by quickly.

In these two days, within the Lightning God’s Palace grounds, Huang Xiaolong found a few stalks of three-million-years-old medicinal herbs and some treasures that did not exist in the lower realm, but there was still no clue about the central formation.

This made him a little depressed.

On the third day, Huang Xiaolong and You Wuye came to another palace building.

Just as they reached the hall, a figure flew in from another entrance.

“You Wuye!”

“Wangu Yanhui!”

You Wuye and that person exclaimed at the same time, both of them were taken aback by the other’s presence in the hall, not expecting to meet here.

Wangu Yanhui? Huang Xiaolong gave the other party another look. He was a young man clad in a scarlet robe, on the chest of which was a blooming fire emblem, exuding overwhelming pressure and disdain toward lower beings.

‘This is the current leader of the ranking list, Wangu Yanhui?’ Huang Xiaolong’s eyes glimmered with interest.

At this time, Wangu Yanhui glanced at Huang Xiaolong. The two people’s gazes collided in midair.
