Chapter 2687: Mansion Master Yuan Qianxing!

“What?!” Long Shengtian nearly flipped the table in rage.

Even Mo Zhi, who was trying to keep his calm after seeing Elder Ming’s appearance, felt anger boiling in his heart when he heard the terms.

“Elder Ming, you’ve been out of the game for too long! In the past, I basically exchanged my life to obtain the Tree of Grand Dao! What’s the meaning of this? You dare to ask for the entire tree after stepping in here…?! Do you really think that my Otherworldly Mansion is something you can step over as you please?!” Mo Zhi glared at Elder Ming with a trace of malevolence flashing in his eyes.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A terrifying aura emerged from Mo Zhi’s body, and the skies above the mansion changed color instantly. A red glow enveloped the land, and a demonic air pervaded the lands.

When Yuan Wanfei and the other Primal Ancestors felt the horrifying aura coming from Mo Zhi, their expressions changed. Even Yuan Qianxing was taken aback.

Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

Mo Zhi was an expert at the Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

If there wasn’t a high-level Primal Ancestor in the Alien Lands, someone at the Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm was a supreme existence! There was no one above them! Of course, no one would dare to blatantly challenge a Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor.

However, that was when they had no reason to.

Today, things were different!

Elder Ming’s eyes flashed red and black as he glared at Mo Zhi. “You’re pretty good. Early-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor… Little kid, it seems like you managed to improve really quickly due to the Tree of Grand Dao! However, I have to leave you with the same sentence I said before! Even if you don’t plan to hand it over, you have no choice!”

Elder Ming released his aura completely, and the earth shook in response.

Every single disciple in the Otherworldly Mansion felt as though a horrifying beast had made its way into the mansion from the depths of hell.

Elder Ming’s aura completely eclipsed Mo Zhi’s.

The faces of everyone changed, and Mo Zhi was no different. “Mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!”

He should be an existence reaching the peak of the mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!

Even though Mo Zhi and Elder Ming were separated by a small difference in cultivation level, it was comparable to the difference between the heavens and the earth!

So what if Mo Zhi had a Primal Ancestor Dao Artifact?! Elder Ming would also be able to bring out a dao artifact!

“That’s right...” Elder Ming sneered. “I’m about to reach the peak of the mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm!”

If he could obtain the Tree of Grand Dao, reaching the peak of the mid-Sixth Resurrection Primal Ancestor Realm could be done in the blink of an eye!

Yuan Qianxing interrupted all of a sudden, “Mansion Master, the royal families were the ones who created the Otherworldly Mansion in the past. Everything the mansion has belongs to the royal families. Elder Ming is extremely reasonable in his request. You can’t put everyone in the mansion in danger because of your personal gain!”

“If you come to blows, you will kill everyone in the Otherworldly Mansion!”

“As the Mansion Master, you should be thinking of how to protect us, the disciples of the mansion!” Yuan Qianxing continued.

Mo Zhi’s face sank and turned a shade darker. An enraged chuckle left his lips. “Yuan Qianxing, you’re a p*ece of sh*t disciple of my Otherworldly Mansion. Are you teaching me how to do things right now?”

After Yuan Qianxing had lost the battle, he had lost his qualifications as a Mansion Master Candidate. Even though he had managed to retain his position as a disciple of the Otherworldly Mansion, and he had considerable power, he was nothing more than an ordinary disciple.

Yuan Qianxing’s expression turned ugly.

“Even if I fail to protect the Tree of Grand Dao today, I’ll kill you!” Killing intent swelled in Mo Zhi’s heart as he made a move against Yuan Qianxing.

In order to obtain more authority in the mansion, Yuan Qianxing had leaked the news of the Tree of Grand Dao. He had threatened the stability of the mansion, and he had crossed Mo Zhi’s baseline a long time ago. His intentional taunts to provoke Mo Zhi had worked since he had decided to kill Yuan Qianxing before doing anything else.

Holding nothing back, Mo Zhi used everything he had in his attack.

Crimson light poured out from his palm and the space around him started to crumble the moment he unleashed his attack.

Even Yuan Qianxing, who had the Inextinguishable Dao Heart at the peak of the Seventh Heaven True Saint Realm, panicked and used everything in his power to defend against the attack.

“Return of the Origin! Destruction!”

A figure flashed and appeared beside Yuan Qianxing.

The person who had appeared was Yuan Wanfei, the patriarch of the Myriad Origin Race.

Boom!

Their attacks collided and the space around the point of impact crumbled.

The expression of everyone in the hall changed as they beat a hasty retreat.

Unable to withstand the impact of the blast, the hall turned into dust instantly. No matter how reinforced the hall was, it was unable to contain the full-powered strike of Mo Zhi, Yuan Wanfei, and Yuan Qianxing.

Yuan Wanfei fared a little better. However, Yuan Qianxing was sent flying into the mountain ranges in the distance, shattering them all.

Slowly emerging from the debris, Yuan Qianxing vomited mouthfuls of blood, and he glared at Mo Zhi.

Even though his strength had progressed quickly, and he no longer feared Long Shengtian, Mo Zhi was another story altogether. If Yuan Wanfei hadn’t made his move in time to protect him, he would be in deep trouble.

“Mo Zhi! You… You’re crazy!” Yuan Wanfei screamed.

No one had expected Mo Zhi to act against Yuan Qianxing all of a sudden, and they knew that if he had managed to land his attack, Yuan Qianxing would have been dead!

Mo Zhi snorted, “I’m crazy? Do you think I’m stupid? Yuan Qianxing and your Myriad Origin Race plotted against my Otherworldly Mansion! Do you really think that you’ll be able to swallow up the mansion along with the other races after the battle for the tree?!”

His figure blurred once again and another palm slammed towards Yuan Qianxing before anyone could react.

“Elder Ming, please save me! I know the location of the Tree of Grand Dao!”

After hearing what he wanted, Elder Ming finally made his move…

…

Several days later, when Huang Xiaolong and Long Jianfei returned to the Otherworldly Mansion, they saw signs of battle that had torn the land in half. No, it was more appropriate to say that there was no longer a piece of intact land in the mansion.

“It seems like we’re too late.” Long Jianfei frowned.

“Let’s go!” Huang Xiaolong’s expression sank as he headed towards the heart of the mansion.

However, a group of disciples from the Myriad Origin Race could be seen forbidding entry to the mansion as they stood guard all around the region.

“Hold it right there!” someone stopped Huang Xiaolong before he could enter the Otherworldly Mansion. “The Mansion Master ordered that no one is allowed to enter the mansion right now! Trespassers will be killed!”

“Mansion Master?” Huang Xiaolong was stunned.

Did Mo Zhi pass down the order?

“Mansion Master Yuan Qianxing personally laid down the order! Right now, he is taking over the entire mansion! We shall make the announcement to the Alien Lands soon!”
