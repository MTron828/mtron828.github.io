Chapter 2018: The Lotus of Darkness

Huang Xiaolong stared at the Heart of Darkness on the sacrificial table with a suspicious look in his eyes. However, the Heart of Hell pounding in his chest was already emitting rays of brilliant light.

The King of Darkness was brothers with his master, the King of Hell. Right now, it was as though the two hearts were meeting each other after a long time. It was no wonder the Heart of Hell was acting weirdly when he approached the palace. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Little cow, do you think that my master is still alive?”

In fact, Huang Xiaolong had a burning question in his heart for a long time. He felt that his master, the King of Hell, should still be alive. That was because his master was the owner of the Heart of Hell.

As long as the three worlds in Hell were still standing tall and the Heart of Hell was alive, and well, there was no way for his master to die!

The little cow shook her head after a short period of consideration. “It’s hard to say. Your master, the King of Hell, had already separated the Heart of Hell from himself. That’s the only reason you managed to refine the heart in the first place! After you received the complete inheritance and obtained the Heart of Hell, it’s even harder to determine whether or not your master is still alive!”

“Whatever the case, when someone reaches the level your master was at, nothing else is of much threat to him. Even if he no longer possesses the Heart of Hell, he might still be alive. As for why he separated the Heart of Hell from himself... The only person to know the answer to that question should be your master himself.”

Huang Xiaolong nodded his head slowly.

However, the little cow’s words rang, again and again, deep in his mind.

Even though there wasn’t much that could threaten a being at his master’s level, nothing in the world was absolute. It was like what the little cow had experienced in the past. Didn’t her soul nearly scatter?

While Huang Xiaolong was thinking about the different possibilities, the little cow explored the space they were in. When she saw a tiny black lotus growing out from the back of the sacrificial table, she released a yelp of surprise.

The black lotus had a total of thirty-six petals, and every single one of them contained immeasurable power. They emitted a magnificent glow and looked as though they were formed from the purest of dark crystals. It held a certain charm that mesmerized everyone who laid their eyes on it.

The part that shocked Huang Xiaolong was the fact that every single petal contained astounding amounts of origin energy!

This!

The lotus was definitely a type of origin treasure!

“Lotus of Darkness... The Lotus of Darkness has actually appeared!” The little cow exclaimed animatedly. She rushed towards the lotus, and saliva poured out from the corner of her lips.

When Huang Xiaolong saw the little cow’s behavior, he knew that the Lotus of Darkness was no ordinary origin treasure.

“This is good stuff, real good stuff!” The little cow pressed her face closer to the lotus and complained in a low voice, “Why! Why will you let me find these treasures?!”

Huang Xiaolong was dumbfounded when he stared at the little cow.

Isn’t it a good thing for her to find such treasures? Why does it sound like she’s complaining?

Despite the question in Huang Xiaolong’s mind, he didn’t ask about it. When the little cow finally calmed herself down, she turned around and raged, “The Lotus of Darkness is a level three origin treasure!” However, she sighed and stared at Huang Xiaolong in the next instant. “Do you even know what is a level three origin treasure?”

Huang Xiaolong felt as though a bolt of lightning had struck him, and he stared at the lotus with his jaws agape.

Level three origin treasure!

It’s something more precious than the purple grandmist aura!

Even someone like Huang Xiaolong, who had seen all sorts of precious treasures, couldn’t help but feel his heart speeding up.

A look of melancholy appeared on the little cow’s face as she sighed. “Now I know why the King of Darkness chose to remain in seclusion here.”

“Are you saying that the King of Darkness had long since realized the presence of this Lotus of Darkness? Is that why he chose to build his palace here to treat his Heart of Darkness?” Huang Xiaolong asked.

The little cow nodded, “That’s definitely the case. With this sort of heaven-defying treasure, even if his physical body was blasted to pieces and his godhead broke into a million pieces, his Heart of Darkness would slowly recover. In fact, there is also a possibility for his Heart of Darkness to strengthen itself by absorbing the energy coming from the Lotus of Darkness!”

“However... The Lotus of Darkness wasn’t mature when he first discovered it. Even if he had swallowed it, he couldn’t have improved his strength by much. Now that several billion years have gone by, the lotus has finally bloomed. You’re really lucky... Everything belongs to you now!”

The little cow stared at Huang Xiaolong with a jealous expression and snorted.

There was no way for her to congratulate him from the bottom of her heart. She would be lying to herself if she said that the Lotus of Darkness didn’t move her. After all, that was the rank three origin treasure they were talking about.

There wasn’t a single Sovereign Realm expert who could remain aloof when a rank three origin treasure was placed before them!

“Let’s split this Lotus of Darkness...”

The little cow stared at Huang Xiaolong in shock the moment he said that. She felt a wave of warmth wash over her heart, but she shook her head in the end. “There is no way for me to refine the Lotus of Darkness. My godhead isn’t of the darkness attribute. Only someone with a darkness attributed godhead will be able to refine an origin treasure born from the darkness of the world.”

A sudden realization dawned on Huang Xiaolong. It was no wonder the little cow was complaining when she saw the Lotus of Darkness. Even though there was a level three origin treasure sitting in front of her face, she couldn’t refine it! Looking at a treasure and being unable to touch it was the worst type of torture!

The little cow turned to Huang Xiaolong and said enviously, “If you refine the Lotus of Darkness, you will be able to bring your Heart of Hell to the next level. If you’re lucky enough to find several other treasures like the Lotus of Darkness, the Heart of Hell might mutate and turn into something stronger than the Ancient Heavenly Court!”

One could only imagine. Huang Xiaolong was able to control anyone below the Fifth Order Emperor Realm with the Heart of Hell with its current power. Even the Radiance Heart Cleansing Mantra was unable to stop him! If the Heart of Hell transformed and became stronger, how terrifying would it become?

“Alright. We don’t have much time left. Hurry up and refine the Lotus of Darkness. I will protect you during the refinement process!”

“What about the King of Darkness?” Huang Xiaolong stared at the Heart of Darkness, and a curious look appeared on his face. Didn’t the little cow say that the Heart of Darkness was healing itself by absorbing the darkness energy coming from the Lotus of Darkness?

The little cow chuckled, “There is no need for you to worry about the King of Darkness. After several billion years of recovery, he should have long since restored himself to his peak state. He should be even stronger than before. The only thing left for him to do is to construct his body and godhead. After you refine the Lotus of Darkness, help him to construct another body with the darkness energy from your Heart of Hell.”

After hearing what the little cow said, Huang Xiaolong felt a wave of relief flood through his heart.

He quickly made his way towards the Lotus of Darkness, and he floated into the air with his feet tucked beneath him. The Archdevil Supreme Godhead started to spin, and it started to devour the Lotus of Darkness.

In an instant, energy poured into Huang Xiaolong’s body like water out of a broken dam. Facing the sudden surge in energy, Huang Xiaolong tried his best to remain cautious. Despite all the precautions he took, the wave of energy nearly suffocated him.

The darkness energy coming from the Lotus of Darkness was just too strong. It was god knew how many times stronger than the energy contained in a purple grandmist aura strand. Thinking about the time when he had refined the purple grandmist qi in the past, Huang Xiaolong felt that even if he tried to refine ten strands of purple grandmist qi at once, it wouldn’t be worse than refining a single Lotus of Darkness.
