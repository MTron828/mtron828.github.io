Chapter 3648 – Weak

In the main hall, everyone looked at Huang Xiaolong like he was some sort of monster. What he said was too crazy! Moreover, he killed yet another grand elder of the Jian Family!

In the eyes of a peak-tier family like the Zhu Family, tens of billions of dao coins was nothing much. However, Huang Xiaolong killed grand elders of the Jian Family. That wasn’t a smart move at all!

The three remaining grand elders felt the blood draining from their faces. Eventually, they sent out messages to the higher ups of their family.

“We contacted the experts of our Jian Family! Just wait for them to come!” One of them yelled.

The news of a grand elder’s death quickly spread through the city and many experts learned about it.

Zhu Jian was also able to learn of the news. He stared at Zhu Yun in disbelief. “Someone killed a grand elder of the Jian Family under their noses?!”

“Yes. It just happened in the Zhu Family Tea House. I heard that it happened because the Jian Family owed them several billions.” Zhu Yun explained.

“Just because of a few billion?” Zhu Jian frowned.

The amount wasn’t even enough for him to spend for several days!

Zhu Yun laughed, “Young Master, you wouldn’t believe who killed them…”

Zhu Jian looked at Zhu Yun curiously.

“It’s that kid!” Zhu Yun laughed.

“What?! That brat really came?” Zhu Jian was pleasantly surprised.

Obviously, he knew that Zhu Yun referred to Huang Xiaolong.

“Yes! He entered the city with Cao Dehong and the others, and they went to the Zhu Family Tea House and killed the grand elders of the Jian Family! He also said that they wouldn’t be able to leave unless they paid up.” Zhu Yun laughed. “Lord Jian Weifeng has already been notified. In a fit of rage, he sent Eminent Elder Jian Shengdong over to deal with the problem.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Lord Jian Shengdong?” Zhu Jian was slightly taken aback.

There were four experts in the Jian Family who had broken through the 10 billion units mark. They were Jian Wushuang, Jian Weifeng, the leader of the eminent elders, Jian Xiyuan, and Jian Shengdong!

Even though Jian Shengdong might not be as strong as Jian Xiyuan, he had broken through countless years ago! It was said that he had close to 10.5 billion units of combat strength! In the Zhu Lan Lands, Jian Shengdong was a force to be reckoned with.

Zhu Yun grinned, “Yes. Lord Jian Shengdong brought two half-step Universe God Realm eminent elders of the Jian Family over to the tea house! The brat is dead!”

…

Zhu Yun was right. Jian Shengdong indeed brought the experts of the Jian Family over. Other than two half-step Universe Gods, there were ten Gods of Creation at the peak of the grand completion stage!

The thirteen of them exuded a monstrous amount of sword qi as they barged over.

“Isn’t that Lord Jian Shengdong of the Jian Family? What’s going on?!” Someone on the streets asked when they noticed what was going on.

“Didn’t you hear? Someone killed two grand elders of the Jian Family in the Zhu Family Tea House! Three other grand elders are currently held hostage there!”

“What?! Is the person crazy?”

The news quickly spread through the city and many people learned of what happened. The experts who had arrived in the Unparalleled City rushed over to the Zhu Family Tea House in order to watch the show that would play out when Jian Shengdong arrived. They were extremely curious about the identity of the person who was insane enough to do something like that!

Very quickly, Jian Shengdong arrived.

With expressionless faces, the thirteen experts of the Jian Family entered the Zhu Family Tea House. Those inside were smart enough to take their leave.

Those who knew what was going on had already hid themselves quite a distance away to watch the show.

Jian Shengdong’s gaze swept across the hall as soon as he entered. When he saw the corpses of the grand elders, his expression sank.

“Eminent Elder Jian Shengdong!” The three other grand elders of the Jian Family revealed hopeful expressions when they noticed his arrival.

The three of them went over to the thirteen God of Creation Realm experts and fell to their knees.

Allowing them to get up, Jian Shengdong’s gaze landed on Huang Xiaolong’s group. He was slightly taken aback when he saw Tao Hang among them. He didn’t understand why a Dao Venerable was part of that group.

Whatever the case, he had to get to the bottom of the matter. “Are you the one who killed the grand elders of my Jian Family?” Jian Shengdong growled.

The experts behind him stared at Huang Xiaolong, waiting for his reply.

“Did you bring enough money?” Huang Xiaolong replied with a question of his own.

Everyone was shocked by his nonchalant attitude.

“This brat… He’s still thinking about the money now!” One of the old ancestors of another family shook his head as he observed the situation in the hall. “If I were him, I'd start thinking about how I want to die…”

“That might not be so. Since he dared to kill grand elders of the Jian Family, he has to possess some type of special status. His expression didn’t even change when he spoke to Jian Shengdong!”

“Special status?” Lord Jian Wushuang had broken through the 20 billion mark. Other than Lords Ferocious Ghost, Green Ghost, Dragon Overlord, God of Death, and Zhu Chen, no one will dare to go against the Jian Family! He obviously isn’t someone sent by the various Lords. Moreover, their relationship with Lord Jian Wushuang isn’t bad.”

Discussion broke out in the surroundings.

As Jian Shengdong stared at Huang Xiaolong, his brows furrowed together. A look of suspicion could be seen in his eyes.

“Isn’t it just tens of billions of dao coins? You won’t be alive to spend it anyway…” One of the half-step Universe Gods beside Jian Shengdong sneered. “As long as you take a single strike from me, I’ll give you the money!” Sword qi filled the space around him as soon as he spoke.

Everyone was shocked by his sudden action.

Before they could react, a ray of sword light shot towards Huang Xiaolong. He didn’t move as the sword light sank into his body.

Staring at him in shock, everyone thought that the battle was over just like that!

Jian Shengdong and the rest didn’t believe it either.

“Lord Jian Chao is really strong indeed! I’m afraid ordinary half-step Universe Gods won’t be able to resist his sword qi either.” One of the old ancestors in the distance sighed.

“Is that it?! Lord Jian Chao took care of it so easily! What a joke… I thought he had something to rely on when he acted so cockily. I was even waiting for a massive battle to take place! Hahaha! The kid is really something else. He challenged the prestige of the Jian Family when he couldn't even resist a single strike from Lord Jian Chao!”

Everyone burst out laughing, but it didn’t take long for them to realize that something was wrong.

Huang Xiaolong’s voice rang through the air, “I’m sorry, was that the strike you were talking about? It’s so weak I thought I mistook it for a breeze…”

Weak?!

Everyone who laughed stared at Huang Xiaolong in stunned silence. Was that it?!
