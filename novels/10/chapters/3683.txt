Chapter 3684 – Arrival of the Dragon Overlord and the God of Death

Huang Xiaolong quickly rushed over only to discover that the fluctuations had disappeared.

A frown formed on his face as he released his dao souls to look for any traces of the disturbance.

Could he be mistaken? However, several minutes later, the disturbance came again. This time, it was much stronger than before!

A light flashed in Huang Xiaolong’s eyes as he stared at the Naihe Bridge filled with Blood Maggots.

Shrill cries came from every part of the bridge, and it was extremely unnerving. There were cries of ghosts accompanied by creepy laughter of children.

Slowly approaching the bridge, Huang Xiaolong thought about the stories he heard from Jian Wushuang and Gui Chi. He knew that one wouldn’t be able to leave the bridge the moment they stepped foot on it.

Sucking in a long breath, Huang Xiaolong took the first step onto the Naihe Bridge.

Even though it was a forbidden zone for many, Huang Xiaolong had a multitude of universe treasures. With the Universe Boat as his trump card, he was confident that he could emerge unscathed.

When his foot landed on the bridge, a massive wave of blood qi charged towards him.

Huang Xiaolong might not be afraid, but he didn’t dare to be careless either. He summoned the Star Dragon Divine Tree to create the star dragon world. As they formed a protective region one hundred meters around him, nothing could harm him. The blood maggots might possess terrifying corrosive power, but they couldn’t compare to the golden rain summoned by the young man previously.

No matter how strong the blood maggots were, they couldn’t do a thing to the star dragon world!

Huang Xiaolong released his dao souls and he discovered that they were suppressed by a special type of power coming from the bridge. Despite his powerful dao souls, he could only notice the situation ten thousand miles around himself.

Moreover, his dao souls used an insane amount of energy whenever he tried to scan his surroundings.

As he continued forward, Huang Xiaolong looked at his surroundings carefully.

The Blood Maggots weren’t the only creatures he needed to be aware of. There were countless other monsters residing on the bridge, and one of the scariest beasts in the Unknown Space was said to live on the bridge itself!

Not too long after Huang Xiaolong ventured onto the bridge, a ray of green light shot towards him. The green light was shockingly fast and it seemed to ignore the defensive star dragon world around Huang Xiaolong! It arrived beside Huang Xiaolong’s neck as the creature within chomped down!

It was too bad Huang Xiaolong had been prepared for any unexpected strikes.

The Reversal Sword in his hand swept outwards to slice the creature in two.

When it landed on the floor, Huang Xiaolong discovered that it was a weird monster with two massive fangs and creepy red eyes. It was the size of a fist, and there wasn’t much face to speak of.

The freak was called the Poison Teeth Blood Monster.

It possessed much stronger abilities than the Blood Maggots and if it managed to bite someone, they would suck out their victim’s blood essence!

The creature was covered in a ball of green light that made them extremely hard to kill.

Huang Xiaolong was lucky to possess the Reversal Sword. Otherwise, he might have to waste a little effort if he wished to kill the Poison Teeth Blood Monster.

After killing it, Huang Xiaolong continued onwards.

Not too long later, another weird creature attacked Huang Xiaolong.

The creature was silent and it was similar in color to the Blood Maggots. Even if one used their dao souls, they wouldn’t be able to discover it easily. When it arrived behind Huang Xiaolong, it expanded by many times before coiling around the man. However, Huang Xiaolong chopped it up into a thousand pieces with a swing of his Reversal Sword.

The creature was something similar to a squid. Due to its color, it was called the Blood Tentacle Monster. It could control one’s body and dao soul after latching onto its victim!

When it controlled its victim completely, it would become the new owner of the body!

The expert who was controlled would no longer be themselves.

As such, no one would dare to mess with the Blood Tentacle Monster.

Half a year passed in an instant.

In the time that passed, Huang Xiaolong killed an uncountable number of weird creatures.

Huang Xiaolong approached the source of the disturbance.

By then, the Dragon Overlord, the God of Death, and several other masters of their regions arrived in the Green Ghost Land as they rushed towards the Fengdu City.

There was an army of dragons following behind the Dragon Overlord, but there were only several dozen thousands of them.

The Death God Army followed behind the God of Death and they were similar in numbers.

The masters of the other regions brought along their strongest subordinates as they made their way over to the city.

More than half the Gods of Creation in the Unknown Space gathered in the Fengdu City and they had one goal and one goal only. They wanted the Reversal Sword!

The God of Death looked at the Dragon Overlord and he snorted, “Old dragon, you obtained the Yin Yang Fire Wheel. You should be more than content with what you have. Why are you here?! Go away!”

When the Dragon Overlord stole the map of the universe treasure from the Limitless Master, he managed to locate the treasure and refine it before anyone else got to him.

The Dragon Overlord roared with laughter and he continued, “You have the Blade of Death too. Since you’re here for the Reversal Sword, why can’t I look for it too?!”

Blade of Death!

That was also one of the thirteen universe treasures.

Actually, all five supreme overlords had a universe treasure each.

The God of Death snorted slightly and he didn’t continue to bicker with the Dragon Overlord.

“According to Yin Qi, Huang Xiaolong is currently in the eighteenth level of the Netherworld. Zhu Chen is down there too.” The Dragon Overlord changed the topic and continued, “Don’t tell me the kid has the same goal as Zhu Chen…”

The God of Death shook his head and sighed, “Huang Xiaolong’s goal might be Zhu Chen himself…”

“Huh?!” The Dragon Overlord stared at the God of Death in shock.

However, the God of Death’s attention was no longer on the dragon. He looked at the entrance of the Netherworld that was covered with several layers of restrictions. “From the looks of it, Huang Xiaolong is probably as strong as me.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Dragon Overlord snorted in contempt. “It’s just several restrictions. They can’t stop me!” After he spoke, he sent a punch flying towards the entrance. Like what happened previously when Huang Xiaolong came, the evil devils near the entrance were exterminated with a single hit. The punch only stopped when it went deep into the first level of the Netherworld.

“Kill your way in. Even if you have to flip the Netherworld over, find him!” The Dragon Overlord waved his hand and ordered the army behind him to advance.

He stepped into the entrance and the army followed close behind.

The God of Death waved his hand and gave the same order.

When the two of them entered, the masters of their various regions entered with their subordinates.

The experts of the Unknown Space flooded the Netherworld. No matter how many evil devils there were, they couldn’t stop the supreme overlords advancement.
