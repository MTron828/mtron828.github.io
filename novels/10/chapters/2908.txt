Chapter 2909: Awaken

When Duan Feng and the others saw that Di Bai was working with Qiao Sheng to attack the motionless Huang Xiaolong, they screamed in horror.

“No!” The roars of Duan Feng and the others boomed through the skies.

Di Bai was a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, and Qiao Sheng’s strength wasn’t too far off.

With the two of them working together to harm a vulnerable Huang Xiaolong, he would be seriously injured even if he didn’t die!

Moreover, he would suffer from the backlash of the failed refinement process, and his fate looked extremely bleak.

Di Bai and the others had no idea who Huang Xiaolong was. Therefore, their thought process was different!

If Huang Xiaolong really suffers from an injury…

Just as they were about to strike, an unending river of energy emerged from Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Slamming into the two Dao Venerables, a massive blast resounded through the air.

The heavens trembled and the earth shook, but what shocked the two Dao Venerables was the fact that Huang Xiaolong was only sent retreating several hundred feet. His eyes were still closed and he didn’t seem to suffer from the slightest injury.

As they stared at each other in shock, they didn’t believe what they experienced.

Of course, neither did the members of the Qiao Family and the Boundary Emperor Creed.

“Was that… Was that cosmos energy?!” Di Bai asked after getting over his initial shock.

He couldn’t confirm whether or not the energy was cosmos energy as the wave of energy that repelled them was a little different from the cosmos energy they were familiar with. However, it indeed gave off the feeling of cosmos energy.

The experts who came along with them were shocked.

“God damn it! He’s f*cking with us!” Di Bai suppressed the suspicion in his heart and the killing intent in his eyes grew a little stronger. “Huang Xiaolong, regardless of your identity, you will have to die here today!”

“All of you, kill him!” He signaled for the other Dao Venerables to take action.

Rushing over instantly, the eight Dao Venerables of the Boundary Emperor Creed gathered around him.

“Do it!”

“Die!”

With a guttural roar, Di Bai rose into the skies with eight other Dao Venerables. With the nine of them working in tandem, cosmos energy filled the skies. Nine streaks of light tore through the skies and arrived before Huang XIaolong in an instant.

“Emperor’s Extermination!”

Qiao Sheng’s expression changed.

Emperor’s Extermination was the strongest attack in the Boundary Emperor Creed. Rumors had it that when Di Bai and the experts of the Boundary Emperor Creed had used the move in the past, they had shattered several dozen sacred lands at once.

The sacred lands in the Divine Tuo Holy World weren’t something the holy grounds of smaller holy worlds could compare to. They were extremely sturdy, and one could only imagine how strong the strike was to shatter several dozens of them at once. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Stay your hand!” Long Jianfei could no longer contain the anxiety in his heart. “His Highness is…”

Before the words could leave his mouth, the strike had landed.

Ice storms and countless bolts of lightning landed on Huang Xiaolong’s body.

Qiao Sheng and the members of the Qiao Family chipped in at the last moment, and they activated the Ice Devouring Lightning Hammer with all their might to get rid of the threat once and for all.

Qiao Jin’s expression mirrored Long Jianfei’s as he knew how terrifying Qiao Sheng’s attack was.

No matter how strong Huang Xiaolong’s defenses were, there was no way he could take on both ultimate attacks at once!

Boom!

Like a cannonball, Huang Xiaolong was sent flying through the air.

Duan Feng and the others felt the blood draining from their faces.

When Di Bai saw what happened, a sinister smile formed on his face. “Hahaha! Huang Xiaolong, you’re definitely dead now!”

After their attack, he would have to suffer from the backlash from the remnant energy in the tribulation. His dao soul would suffer serious injuries, and Huang Xiaolong would be nothing more than a cripple.

All of a sudden, the laughter in the air stopped. Di Bai stared into the distance with an incredulous look. He saw that Huang Xiaolong didn’t suffer from the slightest bit of injury, and his posture didn’t differ from the time they had started their attack. If there was one thing their ultimate attacks did, then it was to only shift Huang Xiaolong away from his original position.

Qiao Sheng and the others were unable to believe their eyes.

“This… This isn’t possible!” Di Bai screamed. A long sword appeared in his hand as he slashed at Huang Xiaolong’s head. “I refuse to believe you can’t die! How can I be inferior to a Primal Ancestor?!”

If they were in their peak states, he would accept the fact that he wouldn’t be able to kill a freak like Huang Xiaolong. However, Huang Xiaolong was sitting there motionless, and he couldn’t even scratch the kid’s skin!

If news of his failure got out, he would turn into the laughing stock of the world!

Before anyone could react, his sword arrived above Huang Xiaolong’s head.

Two fingers reached out to stop the sword in midair, and they prevented it from going any further.

With an expression of disbelief, Di Bai saw that Huang Xiaolong’s eyes were staring straight at him. The frosty expression on Huang Xiaolong’s face caused him, a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable, to feel a sense of unprecedented fear.

Huang Xiaolong slightly flexed his fingers and sent a trace of energy into Di Bai’s arms. With his arms trembling from the sudden intrusion, he released his sword.

As a finger was pointed at his head, the feeling of death overwhelmed Di Bai. He felt as though the grand dao in the world was turned against him as yin and yang reversed. The surrounding space formed a wall around him, and he seemed to be rejected by the heavens and earth!

Retreating with all his might, he summoned countless bodies to cover his escape. As several bodies appeared in midair, no one managed to discern if they were his true body!

It was too bad that his move was ineffective against Huang Xiaolong!

With a single point, the space around the bodies started to fold in on itself. The clones were shattered in an instant, and Di Bai was revealed.

Puff!

A single hole emerged in Di Bai’s body, and he was sent smashing into one of the swathes of land in the treasury.

When he landed, the entire area shattered and treasures were thrown all around.

“What?!”

Qiao Sheng and the others couldn’t believe their eyes. How could a simple point from Huang Xiaolong pierce through Di Bai’s grand dao physique?!

That was a Fifth Esteem Dao Venerable they were talking about! Moreover, Qiao Sheng knew that Di Bai had cultivated a supreme body strengthening technique. His body was stronger than cosmos artifacts, and the artifacts could barely injure him! Yet, Huang Xiaolong pierced a hole through the man’s body easily!

Getting to his feet slowly, the space around him started to tremble. Huang Xiaolong didn’t release his aura, but every single Dao Venerable in the area found it hard to breathe.

This…

A look of terror appeared in Qiao Sheng’s eyes. Even when he met Seventh Esteem Dao Venerables, he wouldn’t feel that way! However, a mere Primal Ancestor was able to scare him so much that he found it hard to breathe!

Is he really a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor?!

The answer was yes. However, he was a Seventh Resurrection Primal Ancestor with two worlds in his body capable of producing cosmos energy!
