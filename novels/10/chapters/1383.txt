“If I refine all these Sea God’s spirits inside the Sea God Tower, would that enable me to breakthrough to high-level Ancestor God Realm?!” Huang Xiaolong asked excitedly.

The little cow rolled her eyes at him, and snorted, “You think these Sea God’s spirits are holy treasures ah? I say, Master, you’re only a late-First Order Ancestor God Realm!”

Huang Xiaolong grinned, looking a little embarrassed; he surely had gotten a little carried away.

As the little cow had said, he’s still a late-First Order Ancestor God Realm. Based on the horrifying amount of energy he needed to advance one small order everytime, how much energy would he need to absorb to breakthrough to high-level Ancestor God Realm? Even just to breakthrough to mid-level Ancestor God Realm, he would need to consume several tens of thousands of chaos spiritual pills.

Tens of thousands of chaos spiritual pills!

The entire Vientiane World’s forces’ resources would probably be insufficient to rear him.

Not to mention, the higher Huang Xiaolong’s cultivation climbed, the more terrifying amount of energy he would need.

Even Huang Xiaolong couldn’t estimate how much energy he needed to advance to God King Realm.

The sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders who were assembled on the square were enraged by Huang Xiaolong and the little cow’s conversation. Huang Xiaolong actually wants to devour their generations of Sea God’s spirits!

These Sea God’s spirits were the remnants of their generations of Sea God’s souls!

Even the twelve prominent families’ Ancestors and Patriarchs worshiped these spirits respectfully, and didn’t dare to utter such blasphemous words.

“Huang Xiaolong, you’re dead!”

“Kill Huang Xiaolong—!”

“Kill him!”

The sea tribe’s various families’ Grand Elders and Elders clamored with fury, and rushed to attack Huang Xiaolong.

Feng Jingxi, Ma Family’s Ancestor, Ma Family’s Patriarch, and others launched a counter attack.

Resounding blasts shook the square, and undulating screams ensued from the sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders.

The sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders who had attacked Huang Xiaolong were slapped out of the square by Feng Jingxi, Ma Family’s Ancestor, and others.

“What?!” Other families’ Grand Elders were astounded by their actions.

"Patriarch! This, you all...!" A Feng Family’s Grand Elder couldn’t believe his eyes.

“Today, we have gathered everyone to make an important announcement—from now on, our sea tribe will submit to Huang Xiaolong, and he is the sea tribe’s new Master! Whichever family, Grand Elder, or Elder that dares to defy or disrespect our Master Huang Xiaolong will end up dead!” Ma Family’s Ancestor’s voice drummed through the sky as his cold gaze swept over the shocked faces of people gathered on the square. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The moment Ma Family’s Ancestor finished talking, the whole Sea God Square erupted in a furor.

There were more than a thousand of the twelve prominent families’ Grand Elders and Elders, and they couldn’t believe what they had just heard.

They needed to submit to Huang Xiaolong!

Their entire sea tribe was expected to ‘submit’ to Huang Xiaolong!

Did these words really come out from the Ma Family’s Ancestor’s mouth?

“Ancestor, you, you, just now...?” A Ma Family’s Grand Elder couldn’t hold himself back from questioning the Ma Family’s Ancestor, but he stammered due to Ma Family’s prestige.

At this time, another sea tribe’s Ancestor who had submitted to Huang Xiaolong spoke, “Ma Family’s Ancestor is right, our entire sea tribe submits to Huang Xiaolong!”

Other sea tribe’s Ancestors on Huang Xiaolong’s side also stated their stance.

The outraged sea tribe’s families’ Grand Elders and Elders were all stupefied.

Feng Family’s Feng Jingxi’s cold gaze swept over the assembled Grand Elders and Elders. “Those who object or defy would be punished with a death penalty as a traitor!”

The noisy Sea God Square fell into a deathly silence.

If it was a couple of Ancestors or Patriarchs, these Grand Elders and Elders could have still resisted them. But it was a different scenario since all the Ancestors and Patriarchs were supporting Huang Xiaolong. None of the Grand Elders or Elders objected to their demands due to this.

“Order them to lower their souls’ barriers!” Huang Xiaolong ordered Feng Jingxi, Ma Family’s Ancestor and the others. This was a precautionary measure to ensure Huang Xiaolong was left undisturbed while refining the Sea God Tower.

Not to mention, the sea tribe would completely belong to Huang Xiaolong in the truest sense only after he had total control over all of the sea tribe’s Elders and Grand Elders!

This would not only allow him to refine the Sea God Tower in peace, but even if he wanted to take away the entire Sea God City, no one would dare to stop him from doing so!

At Huang Xiaolong’s command, Feng Jingxi, Ma Family’s Ancestors and the others complied respectfully and fiercely ordered all the Grand Elders and Elders on the Sea God Square to lower the barrier to their souls.

Hearing this, some of the sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders’ last string of reason snapped.

“Want us to lower the barrier to our souls, impossible! Huang Xiaolong, even if I must die for defying your order, I’ll make sure to pull you to hell with me!”

“Huang Xiaolong, go die for me!”

A dozen sea tribe’s Grand Elders pushed their godforce to the limit with the intention of killing Huang Xiaolong in one strike. Some of their godforce was violent and chaotic as they bore the intention to explode in the hope of killing Huang Xiaolong along them.

These sea tribe’s Grand Elders had high-level Ancestor God Realm cultivation. Therefore, if they were to explode, they could inflict severe and irreparable injuries to Huang Xiaolong even if he was not killed by the impact.

However, divine elephant Xiang Xun blocked their attack by raising his trunk and resonating a roar. His body expanded several hundred zhang in the blink of an eye, and his front foot kicked at the incoming Grand Elders. At the same time, his long trunk swept out.

The dozen of the sea tribe’s Grand Elders were sent tumbling backwards without any resistance.

Divine elephant Xiang Xu’s high-level God King Realm’s momentum enveloped the whole Sea God Square, and the other sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders were astonished as they stared at Xiang Xun who was standing beside Huang Xiaolong.

In their eyes, Xiang Xun was an existence that had surpassed an early God King Realm.

The sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders could faintly guess why the Feng Family’s Patriarch Feng Jingxi, Ma Family’s Ancestor, and the other higher echelons had chosen to support and submit to Huang Xiaolong.

“Who else wants to kill me?” Huang Xiaolong asked as his gaze swept over the sea tribe’s Grand Elders and Elders.

They finally felt fear at this moment.

...

A little over an hour later on the Sea God Square...

With Xiang Xu and Feng Jingxi’s assistance, Huang Xiaolong had everyone from the sea tribe under his control with his grandmist worm.

After that, he turned around towards the Sea God Tower and began refining it.

However, he required Xiang Xun’s help to suppress the Sea God’s spirits inside the Sea God tower in order to refine it. Fortunately, none of these Sea God’s spirits’ strengths were at high-level God King Realm, allowing Xiang Xun to suppress them.

Even so, suppressing so many Sea God’s spirits was not an easy task for even Xiang Xun, thus, Huang Xiaolong had the five sea tribe’s God King Realm Ancestors as well as the Patriarchs to assist Xiang Xun from the side.

The sea tribe’s Ancestors and Patriarchs formed the Sea God’s Heavenly Beasts Formation. Waves of robust godforce formed various images of divine beasts, bearing down on the Sea God’s spirits inside the Sea God Tower. Xiang Xun also circulated his godforce to the extreme and suppressed the Sea God’s spirits..

The Sea God’s spirits inside the Sea God Tower roared in anger.

The Sea God Tower shone in bursts of lights, lighting up a thousand li radius.

Seeing this, Huang Xiaolong acted decisively, and circulated his godforce according to the Grandmist Puppetry Technique to refine the Sea God Tower.

The Grandmist Puppetry Technique was the most sophisticated technique for refining the puppets, and this technique made it easier to refine the Sea God Tower.
