Chapter 3386: Killing an Immortal EmperorAall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When they arrived at the entrance, they saw a golden-robed young man walking towards them under the escort of various disciples. He held a golden scepter in his hands.

Zhao Qi cupped his fists as he roared with laughter, “Brother Yang Kai, it’s an honor.”

Chuckling happily, Yang Kai returned the greeting. “Brother Zhao Qi is too kind. It’s definitely time for celebration now that Brother Zhao Qi entered the Immortal Emperor Realm. It’s a happy occasion for the Immortal World. How can I be absent from such an important event?”

The two of them laughed happily.

Those standing around joined in the laughter as they offered their greetings.

All the founding ancestors and experts present might be monstrous presences in their own right, but they lowered their heads when speaking to Yang Kai.

With a grand welcome from Zhao Qi and the various experts, Yang Kai entered the main hall. He was arranged a seat higher than Zhao Qi.

“Brother Yang Kai, please enjoy the spiritual dragon wine I prepared. It’s something I keep for grand occasions.”

With his eyes lighting up, Yang Kai chuckled, “I’ve long since heard of your famous spiritual dragon wine. Who would have thought that I would get to enjoy it today? This wasn’t a wasted trip!”

Laughter filled the hall.

All of a sudden, Chen Baolai rushed into the hall all flustered. He didn’t care about Yang Kai’s presence as he rushed over to Zhao Qi. In a terrified voice, he stuttered, “Lord Zhao Qi, the… The troops... They were… They were killed! All of them are dead!”

The entire hall fell into complete silence.

Everyone frowned in surprise.

How could heavenly troops die like that? Who in their right mind would kill people related to the Heavenly Court?

Even Zhao Qi didn’t think that he was talking about the troops that were sent to the Shushan Immortal Gate.

“What are you talking about?”

“Lord Zhao Qi, the troops you sent to the Shushan Immortal Gate! All one million of them have been killed!” Chen Baolai gasped for breath.

“What did you say?!” The cup in Zhao Qi’s hand fell to the ground as he widened his eyes in shock.

Immortal Emperor Yang Kai was equally as surprised.

“What about General Cao Kun and the others?” Yelling in panic, Zhao Qi jumped to his feet.

“General Cao Kun and the others were killed! Not a single one managed to escape!”

Zhao Qi felt his brain buzzing as he fell back into his seat.

The founding ancestors of their respective factions and the experts present sucked in a cold breath.

Even Yang Kai frowned at the news.

Everyone knew that Zhao Qi had ordered a million troops to surround the Shushan Immortal Gate. They also knew that the army would kill anyone who tried to leave the mountain. However, they never expected the entire army to be decimated!

“Did Huang Xiaolong kill them?” Zhao Qi asked in disbelief.

Wasn’t he just a high-level Immortal Venerable?!

“Yes! Huang Xiaolong killed them alone!” Chen Baolai replied.

“How dare Huang Xiaolong do this?!” Yang Kei snorted. “He committed a heavenly sin by killing a million heavenly troops! Not even a holy being will be able to save him!”

One of the present founding ancestors harrumphed, “That’s right! He deserves death if he dares to kill a single heavenly soldier! Now, he killed a million of them along with several generals! We should join hands and send a devil like him to the depths of hell! He shall never be allowed to reincarnate!”

The person who spoke was the founding ancestor of the Southern Zhanbu Continent’s Extreme Star Sect. He was someone who had been famous for a long time, and his reputation was considerable.

“That’s right! We should banish them to the deepest part of hell!” another founder yelled. “Look into his family and dig out everyone related to him! All of them will have to die!”

In an instant, Huang Xiaolong became the topic of discussion.

Recovering, Zhao Qi growled, “I will meet the Celestial Emperor tomorrow. I will request for all four heavenly kings to make a move. We will end him once and for all!”

The four heavenly kings were Dhritarashtra, Virudhaka, Virupaksa, and Vaisravana.

They were the experts who protected the four continents, and all of them had been an Immortal Emperor since ancient times. When they joined hands, not many Immortal Emperors could be their opponents.

“When the time comes, I shall meet His Majesty with Brother Zhao Qi,” Yang Kai said.

“There’s no need for all of you to go anywhere.” A voice rang through the skies before Zhao Qi could say anything else.

Everyone stared at the source of the voice in shock.

When Zhao Qi and the others finally focused their sights, they saw that a figure had appeared at the entrance. It was the body of a young man, and he was clad in a weird dao robe. There were runes inscribed on it that confused Zhao Qi and the others.

A weird aura surrounded him as he stood there, unwavering.

“You… Are you Huang Xiaolong?!” A terrifying thought flashed through Zhao Qi’s mind and he gasped.

If he had met Huang Xiaolong an hour ago, he wouldn’t have been as afraid. However, the news of his annihilated troops got to him. Now, the look in his eyes changed when he looked at Huang Xiaolong.

Yang Kai frowned and snapped, “Huang Xiaolong?”

How could Huang Xiaolong be at the Heavenly Frost Palace?

Everyone, who was seated in the hall, jumped in fright. They retreated to the corner of the hall as they huddled together. It was as though they would be safer if they did that.

Huang Xiaolong swept his gaze across the entire hall before finally settling on Zhao Qi. “Seems like I’ve interrupted your banquet.”

Sucking in a cold breath, Zhao Qi’s face sank. “Huang Xiaolong, what do you want?”

“I want to kill you,” Huang Xiaolong muttered, as though taking Zhao Qi’s life was nothing special.

The faces of everyone changed.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes as he glared at Huang Xiaolong, “Huang Xiaolong who do you think you are? Do you know the consequences of killing a great general of the Heavenly Court?!”

Huang Xiaolong ignored him as he walked towards Zhao Qi.

Seeing as Huang Xiaolong dared to ignore him, the scepter in his hands shot outwards. In an instant, brilliant gold light filled the hall. They turned into a mini golden sun that suppressed everyone. It contained extremely condensed Buddhist energy, and anyone who was trapped in the light would be unable to move a single muscle.

Seeing as Yang Kai made his move, everyone in the hall heaved a sigh of relief. Since he became an Immortal Emperor a hundred thousand years ago, Yang Kai’s strength was unfathomable!

Moreover, Yang Kai’s arts were extremely powerful. Cultivators of the same realm would be unable to fight back if they were affected! Even as a Second Level Immortal Emperor, he could fight Third Level Immortal Emperors if he pushed himself to the limit!

However, Huang Xiaolong was in a whole other league. Raising his hand slightly, Huang Xiaolong pointed casually at Yang Kai. The latter was sent flying, and when he landed, there weren’t any signs of life left in his body. When everyone turned to look at him, they saw a hole between his eyebrows.
