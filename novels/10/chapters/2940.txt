Chapter 2941: Huang Xiaolong’s Here!

Right when Huang Xiaolong arrived at the Dragon Fish Creed headquarters, within the Dragon Fish City’s certain luxurious residence, Lin Zhuoyi, Liu Xinxin, and also many of the creed's young patriarchs were gathered in the main hall, talking merrily.

Naturally, Xuanyuan Creed’s Xuanyuan Potian and Blue Lotus Creed’s Yang Jia were amongst the present.

After the Monarch Yu Sacred Land’s battle, Yang Jia had made a trip back to Blue Lotus Creed. His master, Blue Lotus Creed Patriarch Lin Rui had ordered Yang Jia to be imprisoned for one hundred thousand years!

However, when the Dragon Fish Creed and nine other top-tier creeds as well as Huang Shuai jointly ordered Huang Xiaolong to be captured, Yang Jia was released by Lin Rui. This time, he came to the Dragon Fish City, accompanying his master to participate in the Creation Ceremony.

No doubt, Yang Jia’s identity only qualified him a seat in a corner of the hall.

“Tomorrow is the Creation Ceremony, do you guys think Huang Xiaolong will show up?” Suddenly, the Misty Rain Creed’s Lu Chengfeng threw out the question.

The hall came to an abrupt silence due to Lu Chengfeng’s question.

Lu Chengfeng was Yu Yue’s eldest senior brother, one of the most talented disciples of Misty Rain Creed. Although his talent couldn’t compare to Xuanyuan Potian, or Lin Zhuoyi, he was someone with eight high-order Saint Fates, an excellent bloodline, and supreme dao physique.

Liu Xinxin let out an unladylike snort, “He’ll come! No one dares to defy His Highness Huang Shuai’s order, and Huang Xiaolong is no exception! Unless he really stands opposite His Highness! His Highness Huang Shuai told him to submit before the Creation Ceremony, so, he’ll definitely come to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai before the Creation Ceremony!”

Xuanyuan Potian’s eyes narrowed, gleaming coldly as he spoke, “Hope he knows what’s good for him, or else, my Xuanyuan Creed will guarantee that he dies without a burial place!”

“In recent days, I’ve been using various torture methods on that Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng, and it’s letting me feel refreshed all over.” Liu Xinxin giggled, “Pity that Huang Xiaolong didn’t get to see it.”

Huang Xiaolong had broken her entire body’s dao veins and inextinguishable dao heart, so she had vented all her fury and hatred on Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng’s bodies.

The Blue Lotus Creed’s Yang Jia, who was sitting in proper posture interjected, “In my opinion, His Highness Huang Shuai is too magnanimous to give Huang Xiaolong a chance to submit. If it was me, I would have sent Huang Xiaolong on his way with one strike.”

Liu Xinxin let out a giggle and responded, “Do you think His Highness Huang Shuai would accept Huang Xiaolong’s submission so easily? Huang Xiaolong has repeatedly provoked the Dragon Fish Creed, and this is blatant disrespect to our Dragon Fish Creed, as he has shown disregard towards His Highness Huang Shuai. When Huang Xiaolong comes, His Highness Huang Shuai would definitely make him kneel for ten days and ten nights, and kowtow a hundred thousand times before accepting Huang Xiaolong’s submission.”

Xuanyuan Potian sneered coldly, “Merely ten days and ten nights, and one hundred thousand kowtows aren’t going to do it. If it was up to me, Huang Xiaolong would kneel for a whole year where the various forces’ disciples would spit on him, and I would test if he is really sincere in submitting. If Huang Xiaolong were to endure this, then only, it would prove that he’s submitting sincerely. On the other hand, if he failed to endure, it would show that there’s no sincerity in his submission at all.”

Liu Xinxin’s eyes lit up and a smile blossomed over her face, “Young Patriarch Potian’s idea is absolutely wonderful, I shall bring it up to His Highness Huang Shuai later.”

Other young patriarchs and core disciples in the hall applauded the idea, shouting their full support, and flattered Xuanyuan Potian while they were at it.

While everyone in the hall showed their support for Xuanyuan Potian’s idea, a Dragon Fish Creed’s disciple rushed into the hall and reported in a hurry, “Senior Brother Lin Zhuoyi, Senior Sister Liu Xinxin… Huang Xiaolong… Huang Xiaolong’s here!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What? You’re saying that Huang Xiaolong’s here?!” Lin Zhuoyi, Liu Xinxin, Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jia, and the others jumped up from their seats in shock.

Clearly, all of them were actually shocked that Huang Xiaolong had really dared to come.

“It’s true, Senior brother Lin Zhuoyi!” The disciple stressed, “Huang Xiaolong has already reached the headquarters’ area, and he will soon enter Dragon Fish City.”

Liu Xinxin laughed harshly, “What did I say earlier? Huang Xiaolong will surely come to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai. Didn’t you guys hear that? There are still two days before the Creation Ceremony, yet Huang Xiaolong couldn’t wait to come and submit!”

-

Numerous creeds’ patriarchs, and genesis races’ patriarchs had convened to participate in the ceremony. Hence, during this time, there were many more Ninth Esteem Dao Venerable experts in the Dragon Fish City than any other place or time. In Liu Xinxin’s opinion, Huang Xiaolong wouldn’t have the guts to come and make trouble at this juncture, and there could only be one reason Huang Xiaolong had come, and it was to submit to His Highness Huang Shuai.

“Since Huang Xiaolong has come, let us go out and give him a present.” Xuanyuan Potian suddenly said.

A present?

Everyone blanked for a second but caught on to Xuanyuan Potian’s meaning fast enough.

Liu Xinxin turned her head to a disciple standing at the side of the hall and ordered, “Bring Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng out from the dungeon. We’ll have them meet Huang Xiaolong with us.”

“Yes, Senior Sister Liu Xinxin!” The disciple smartly replied and withdrew from the hall. He soon returned with Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng, dragging them up to Liu Xinxin.

Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duang Zheng’s eyes were sluggish with no focus point, and they exuded a rancid stench all over their bodies. It was obvious from a single glance that they were broken from the tortures.

The three of them were Primal Ancestor Realm cultivators, to be reduced to this state… One could only imagine what kind of tortures they had been subjected to.

With brimming anticipation, Liu Xinxin and the others brought Long Jianfei, Duan Feng, and Duan Zheng out of the residence, and headed to the point Huang Xiaolong was bound to pass.

Naturally, Huang Shuai was promptly informed of Huang Xiaolong’s arrival by the Dragon Fish Creed Enforcement Hall Master Zhu Hui.

When Huang Shuai received the report, he was with the Dragon Fish Creed Patriarch Bi Cheng and others, discussing the final details of the Creation Ceremony.

“Oh, Huang Xiaolong’s here,” Huang Shuai’s eyes lit up and a sly smile flashed across his face, “There are two more days until the Creation Ceremony. Not bad, he’s quite smart.”

Huang Xiaolong had arrived two days before the Creation Ceremony to submit to him in front of numerous creeds’ experts, that naturally put Huang Shuai in a good mood.

“That is so, Your Highness,” Zhu Hui agreed smilingly, “Lin Zhuoyi, Liu Xinxin, Young Patriarch Xuanyuan Potian, and the others went out when they heard Huang Xiaolong was there.”

Huang Shuai chuckled, “Let them be. Send a message to Zhuoyi, Xinxin, and the others, and just tell them not to let Huang Xiaolong enter the Dragon Fish City too easily. First, let him kneel outside the city for two days until the day of the Creation Ceremony before letting him in to see me.”

Zhu Hui laughed softly as he complied, and stepped out from the hall. He immediately sent Huang Shuai’s order to Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin.

At the same time, Lin Zhuoyi, Liu Xinxin, Xuanyuan Potian, Yang Jia, Lu Chengfeng, and the others were already outside the city gates. Lin Zhuoyi and Liu Xinxin laughed audibly when they saw the message Zhu Hui sent them. After that they handed over their communication symbol to share with Xuanyuan Potian, and the others.

After reading the message, Xuanyuan Potian joked, “Just kneeling for two days… Huang Xiaolong gotten a bargain.”

Liu Xinxin giggled softly, “It’s two days for now, but Huang Xiaolong definitely still has to kneel on the day of the ceremony.”

Amidst Xuanyuan Potian and the others laughter, a figure arrived with the whistling wind, ebony hair fluttered in the wind, and his eyes were bright like eternal shining stars.

“It’s Huang Xiaolong! Huang Xiaolong’s here!”

The experts who saw Huang Xiaolong broke out in a commotion.

Xuanyuan Potian, Liu Xinxin, Lin Zhouyim, and the others stared at Huang Xiaolong fixedly, and an obscure glint of hatred flickered in the depths of Xuanyuan Potian’s eyes.

Inside the Dragon Fish City, blood receded from Yin Yue’s face who had just learned of Huang Xiaolong’s arrival…
