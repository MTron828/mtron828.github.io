Chapter 2205 – Glory of the Spirit Bead

...

...

...

In these years, during the great war between humanity and the saints, the might and prestige of the Grandmist Spirit Bead had spread throughout the 33 Heavens. It was without a doubt the most famed and illustrious divine tool in the 33 Heavens. After all, not many people knew of the Origin Amethyst Crystal or the Stone of Eternal Life.

“This Good Fortune Saint Sovereign has finally dropped any semblance of shame and wants to use the Grandmist Spirit Bead to deal with Lin Ming...”

Some human martial artists said with angry indignation. The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s cultivation surpassed Lin Ming’s by a great deal to begin with, and he was tens of thousands of times older than Lin Ming, and yet he now wanted to use the Grandmist Spirit Bead; these actions were far too despicable.

“The winner is king and the loser is the villain. Since ancient times, all that has ever mattered is victory. Any ideas of shame or face are completely insignificant!”

Dark Demon Monarch said, his eyes shining as he looked at the Grandmist Spirit Bead. He turned his gaze towards Lin Ming. He believed that Lin Ming already anticipated this occurring before the battle began, because if one wished to defeat the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign they would have to deal with the Grandmist Spirit Bead in his hands.

“Lin Ming! Today I will use your blood to further build up the Grandmist Spirit Bead! I believe that with the quality of your blood, the might of this bead will rise to new heights!”

The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s eyes overflowed with killing intent. During these years, he had been arduously refining the Grandmist Spirit Bead.

Divine tools also needed to be nurtured and raised, but of the three great divine tools, only the Grandmist Spirit Bead hadn’t been held by a Beyond Divinity level powerhouse. This was because the three great divine tools were born in the 33 Heavens and life had existed in the 33 Heavens for only several tens of billions of years. Moreover, the true pinnacle of the martial arts civilization had been 10 billion years ago, but at that time only two Beyond Divinity level powerhouses had appeared.

The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign wanted to nurture the Grandmist Spirit Bead to its highest state. If he could nourish it with the blood vitality of a peerless genius, then it would naturally obtain immense benefits.

Facing the Grandmist Spirit Bead, Lin Ming took a deep breath, his eyes darkening, turning earnest. When he originally set up talks with Good Fortune, he never thought to rely on any good results coming from it. The collapse of the talks was already a 99% assured occurrence, and once that happened, what Lin Ming wanted to obtain the most was the Grandmist Spirit Bead!

With this bead his desire of breaking into the eighth Dao Palace would come to fruition. In truth, when he was in the Demon God’s Tomb, he had nearly broken into the eighth Dao Palace. However he had diverted most of the world strength into consolidating his True Divinity boundary, thus the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace had fallen slightly behind.

At this time, a sound transmission echoed in Lin Ming’s ears. “Lin Ming, if you need me to help then just tell me. Although I cannot deal with Good Fortune myself, I can support you. Diverting his attention shouldn’t be a problem at all.”

This voice held a tone of concern, causing Lin Ming to feel warm. This was Sheng Mei’s voice. In the 33 Heavens, if one didn’t consider Good Fortune or the Soul Emperor, then Sheng Mei was a peerless powerhouse only inferior to Lin Ming.

Between her and Lin Ming, the difference was at most a small True Divinity boundary.

“I should be able to deal with this. The three divine tools are not invincible. In the past, the Asura Road Master and Immortal Sovereign each held divine tools and yet they were not able to cut down the Demon God Tomb’s master. Similarly, Good Fortune has the Grandmist Spirit Bead but he might not necessarily be able to do anything to me! If I really cannot handle it and obtain victory, then it won’t be too late for you to help.”

In a battle of life and death, Lin Ming naturally wouldn’t care about something so stupid like fighting one against one for the sake of some martial arts spirit. Moreover, even if he and Sheng Mei added their ages together, this old freak Good Fortune was still thousands if not tens of thousands of times older than they were. There was just no need to care about the ideals of martial arts.

First, Lin Ming didn’t want Sheng Mei to help because he wanted to test the limits of his strength. Second, and more importantly, he didn’t want to expose Sheng Mei’s identity with so many people around.

In these past days Lin Ming had seen that Sheng Mei didn’t want to mix in with humanity.

After all, in the eyes of humanity’s martial artists, Sheng Mei was a spiritas, someone that belonged to an enemy race.

Sheng Mei followed Lin Ming and wasn’t relying on humanity. Out of the entire human race, the only person she cared about was Lin Ming. As for whether the others lived or died, she didn’t care at all.

As for the reasons that Sheng Mei followed Lin Ming, they were all extremely complicated situations. For instance, her union with Lin Ming at the Sky Spill Planet, the relationship between her past life and Immortal Sovereign, these types of things couldn’t be explained to the public, and nor could they be clearly explained.

Thus, in the eyes of the public, the reason that Sheng Mei followed Lin Ming would be just one – a woman had betrayed her own race to run off with a man from an enemy race.

Even if everyone was respectful to Sheng Mei because of her strength and Lin Ming’s status, they would all inevitably develop such an idea in their hearts.

Lin Ming didn’t want Sheng Mei to be criticized like this, even if it were only the subconscious thoughts of people. This was because fate already weighed far too deeply on Sheng Mei’s shoulders.

At this time, in front of Lin Ming, the Grandmist Spirit Bead rapidly revolved. A blood pond hell seemed to be sealed within it!

Even though they were separated by a space of 10 miles and numerous chaotic space storms, Lin Ming could still feel his blood vitality restlessly stirring in his body!

It was like the Spirit Bead was invisibly devouring his blood vitality.

“I will use the Grandmist Spirit Bead to pierce through your heart!”

The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s eyes were blood red. His astral essence surged to the limit. With a roar, his joints emitted explosive crackling sounds. “Fist to rule the world!”

The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s fist smashed into the Grandmist Spirit Bead!

This was the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s strongest fist strike. It carried all of his energy as he poured it into the Grandmist Spirit Bead. Then, the Grandmist Spirit Bead was sent hurtling outwards as it shot towards Lin Ming!

Its speed reached the extreme, so fast that it surpassed almost everyone’s reactions. Even for Soaring Feather, all she felt was a flash of light in her eyes; she simply couldn’t tell what had happened.

In the darkness of space, the Grandmist Spirit Bead drew a perfectly straight line as it fired into Lin Ming’s chest!

This ultimate attack didn’t need to come from some tricky trajectory, because its speed was so fast that no one could avoid it!

Puff!

The Grandmist Spirit Bead crashed into Lin Ming’s chest!

Lin Ming’s protective power of divinity and demons instantly shattered. The Spirit Bead continued with unstoppable force, directly tearing into Lin Ming’s flesh and blood and thrusting into his body!

Its speed was almost as fast as light. As the Spirit Bead entered Lin Ming’s body, it immediately stopped, as if it were caught on something!

However, this didn’t matter, because in this moment the Grandmist Spirit Bead began to wildly swallow up the strength of Lin Ming’s blood vitality!

The Grandmist Spirit Bead’s fearfulness didn’t rely on the physical impact of its attack, but on its ability to suck a person dry into a withered corpse!

In that moment, everyone felt their hearts skip a beat. The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign diabolically grinned. Although he didn’t understand why his attack couldn’t pierce through Lin Ming’s heart, that was unimportant, because as long as the Grandmist Spirit Bead entered his body, Lin Ming’s flesh and blood would be sucked dry.

“Lin Ming!”

Xiao Moxian cried out in alarm. The minds of all the human martial artists tightened and they held their breaths. Lin Ming was the pillar of humanity. If he were to perish here, humanity would perish along with him!

Everything happened within a spark of light before they could respond. And at this time, Lin Ming’s mortal body began to rapidly change!

His body began to grow, his skin turned black, his muscles bulged out, and spikes drilled out from him. In the blink of an eye his appearance turned cruel and hideous, into the form of an abyssal!

Lin Ming had transformed into his demon avatar, using the strength of it to withstand the attack of the Grandmist Spirit Bead!

In terms of the strength of blood vitality, Lin Ming’s demon avatar had swallowed a part of Famine’s strength and its blood vitality was several times more powerful than his true self’s.

As the Grandmist Spirit Bead swallowed the blood vitality of Lin Ming’s demon avatar, Lin Ming’s demon eyes flashed with a cold brilliance. With a roar, he hurtled towards the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign!

After forcefully withstanding the swallowing power of the Grandmist Spirit Bead, the demon avatar’s lips were stained with blood but it still rushed ahead!

This was like a confrontation between two martial artists in which one martial artist pierced through the other with a spear. But, not only did that severely wounded martial artist not retreat, but he pushed forwards into the spear instead, allowing the spear to pierce through his body in order to give his opponent a final fatal strike!

“What!?” The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign was shocked. He didn’t think Lin Ming would be so ruthless and aggressive, and he also couldn’t imagine why the Grandmist Spirit Bead hadn’t passed through Lin Ming’s heart.

Even this powerful abyssal demon in front of him shouldn’t have such potent defensive powers. In front of the Grandmist Spirit Bead, there was no flesh and blood mortal body that should be able to withstand such a strike!

However, the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign didn’t have time to think of such things; he faced Lin Ming’s desperate death strike. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Humph, you are already at the end of the road, rushing up here just means a faster death!”

The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign sneered. But in the next moment, the sneer froze on his face.

He stared helplessly on as the demon Lin Ming who was hurtling towards him suddenly stretched out a claw and thrust it into his own chest.

The scales were torn apart by the sharp claws; fresh blood sprayed out!

And then, a situation occurred that left a creepy tingling on everyone’s scalps. The demon Lin Ming actually drew out a spine from his chest, one that was dripping with blood!

As this spine was torn out from Lin Ming’s chest, an alarming amount of blood and ruined flesh sprayed out with it. And, the Grandmist Spirit Bead was caught in the center of the spine!

What was able to block the Grandmist Spirit Bead from piercing through Lin Ming’s heart was the evil bone he obtained from the Demon God’s Tomb!

Lin Ming’s demon avatar had already refined this demon bone. He fused it into his mortal body, and by relying on it he could resist the attack of the Spirit Bead!

In this moment, the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign was left panic-stricken!
