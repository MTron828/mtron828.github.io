Chapter 1688B – The Shadow In the Vortex

…

…

…

Everyone was stunned and looked towards the Gate of Laws. They saw that it was the exit of the heaven-step difficulty that was shaking.

“Mm? Someone else came out?”

Before everyone had time to respond, a black-clothed young girl came hurtling out!

This young girl had a simple and beautiful appearance. Her body was slender and her complexion was only slightly pale. There was a bit of blood that stained her clothes.

It was clear it hadn’t been easy for her to pass the Gate of Laws!

This young girl that looked to be 17-18 years old was actually Xiao Moxian!

“Eh… she also passed?”

Many people were surprised. They originally believed that if Xiao Moxian were to enter the heaven-step difficulty, the chances were she would have more misfortune than good luck. But they never imagined she would successfully pass the trial.

“It isn’t strange. If I enter the heaven-step difficulty I can also pass, but my completion percent would be far too low. The benefits simply aren’t worth the cost,” the Divine Void Crown Prince suddenly spoke at this time.

Although it sounded like he was boasting, he was actually correct. If he could perfectly complete the earth-step difficulty, that meant that even though he could pass the heaven-step difficulty, he would at most obtain a 40-50% completion rate. But with this completion rate, the rewards wouldn’t be as good as perfectly completing the earth-step difficult.

“That woman was with Lin Ming, right?”

“Yes, she’s likely Lin Ming’s woman. I really underestimated her. Even so, look at her… It seems she has reached her limits. She probably barely passed.”

“Haha, that might not be so.” The Divine Void Crown Prince shook his head. As he looked at Xiao Moxian, there was a hint of appreciation in her eyes. “It’s already impressive for her to pass the heaven-step difficulty. Now, I’m curious as to what her completion percent is. 20%? 30%? Or perhaps she just barely managed to pass?”

“Little sister Xian’er, are you okay!?”

Seeing Xiao Moxian’s bloodstained clothes, Mo Brightmoon felt her heart tighten. When Xiao Moxian had chosen the heaven-step difficulty, she had indeed felt nervous. But because she had experienced Xiao Moxian’s strength, she knew that even though Xiao Moxian couldn’t compare to Sheng Mei, she should still be able to survive the Gate of Laws without a problem.

Now, she saw Xiao Moxian come out. Although it seemed Xiao Moxian had approached her limits, at least she was safe and well. Mo Brightmoon could finally relax.

“I’m good.” Xiao Moxian gripped her fists. Although her tumbling blood vitality was in an extremely poor state, she still had an excited expression on her face.

“Little sister Xian’er, you must make haste and adjust your condition.”

Suya quickly took out a wound recovery pill. She and Mo Brightmoon didn’t ask about Xiao Moxian’s completion percent. This was not the right time to ask about such matters. Xiao Moxian’s wounds came first, and they were also still worried about Lin Ming.

“Really, women are no inferior to men. I must say I admire her…”

Duke Fullmoon rubbed his chin, watching Xiao Moxian with a brilliant light in his eyes.

This woman’s talent was far too amazing. Even though she barely passed, she still surpassed over 95% of those present!

Moreover, she had outstanding looks. This caused Duke Fullmoon to feel not so good in his heart. How had such a good piece of cabbage been grabbed up by a pig? That boy Lin Ming was far too blessed when it came to women!

Luckily, Lin Ming was far too stupid and entered the Asura level difficulty like the fool he was. Chances were, he had already died by now. If this was true, this woman was now alone!

Thinking of this, Duke Fullmoon began to develop tempting thoughts. He thought of taking Xiao Moxian under his wings. Since he was rising to fame, he needed to build up his own power and forces. If he could capture Xiao Moxian’s body and mind, she would undoubtedly be an excellent dual cultivation partner. Not only could he drink deep in his lust for her, but it would also be a great help for himself.

“This miss is called Xian’er, right? What amazing abilities you have! It seems we have had some misunderstandings before, but to meet today in the final trial could be called a stroke of luck. As they say, you won’t know someone unless you fight them. No matter what problems we’ve had in the past with each other, allow me take the initiative to apologize for anything I might have done wrong. How about we clean away any past animosities we might have?”

Xiao Moxian was already sitting down, about to enter meditation to restore her wounds. After she received Suya’s pill and was about to swallow it down, she heard this disgusting and repugnant voice sound out in her ears. As she looked up, she saw Duke Fullmoon swinging his fan, looking down at her with a proud and happy expression.

It was like Xiao Moxian had just finished a wonderful meal, and just as she was basking in the enjoyment of it, she discovered a giant fly on her plate. Not only did any happy feelings she had had disappear, but she was even a little enraged.

“You want to apologize? Isn’t your skin too thick? Who do you think you are? I don’t even remember who you are,” Xiao Moxian icily said, not bothering with Duke Fullmoon.

“Haha, Miss Xian’er is too playful. Don’t we martial artists have photographic memories? How could Miss Xian’er possibly not remember me?” Duke Fullmoon said, putting on his most noble and elegant demeanor. Since he had thoughts of taking in this woman, he naturally had to endure her temper a little.

But who knew that Xiao Moxian wouldn’t fall for his act? She ignored him, treating him as if he was nothing more than empty air. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xiao Moxian swallowed the pill and started to meditate.

Duke Fullmoon frowned. Even he had limited patience. In front of so many people, Xiao Moxian had done the same as slapping him across the face. He naturally didn’t feel good about this.

He spoke, his voice much icier, “Smart birds and beasts know where to make their home, and wise men understand their circumstances. You aren’t counting on your lover leaving the Gate of Laws, right? Hehe! If he kept a little lower profile, with his little cheap tricks in the divine runic arts he might have caused some small influences to have some interest in him. But what a pity…”

Duke Fullmoon coldly sneered.

But this sneer actually caused a deep killing intent to flash in Xiao Moxian’s eyes. She was originally a daughter of the demon and monster race, and towards her enemies, she would feel no pity, nor would she show mercy. In particular, this Duke Fullmoon had actually touched upon her reverse scale of rage, cursing Lin Ming to die!

It had to be known that even though Xiao Moxian had 120% confidence in Lin Ming, this final trial was still established by the Asura Road Master. The difficulty Lin Ming chose was the hardest one there was, so how could it be easy to pass?

Xiao Moxian feared Lin Ming would try to chase perfection and choose to challenge some test that surpassed his limits, finally meeting danger. As Xiao Moxian heard Duke Fullmoon speak such words, a deep and profound killing intent began to swell up within her!

She subconsciously traced her spatial ring. But this action caused Suya’s heart to skip a beat. Suya quickly stopped Xiao Moxian by saying, “Little sister Xian’er, don’t be impulsive. There are many people here, you absolutely cannot start a fight!”

Duke Fullmoon’s complexion had completely darkened. He finally became aware that this woman belonged to Lin Ming until her death and would never submit to anyone else. If so, he was done being kind to her.

“You want to kill me? How interesting! It seems you would rather do things the hard way! I urge you to consider your circumstances some more. With your strength and your background, do you have the capital to contend with me? If that little beast Lin Ming were still alive and the Divine Runic Masters Guild was here to support you, I might fear you a little. But now, who else do you have?”

As Duke Fullmoon spoke, the Gate of Laws trembled once more.

Duke Fullmoon was startled. He turned to look. At this strange time, just who would come out? As Duke Fullmoon saw what was happening, surprise flitted across his face. This time, it was the exit to the Asura level difficulty that was shaking!

For a time, the noisy crowd calmed down. Even the Crown Prince and Bigflame who were ready to soar towards their immortal palace rewards stopped, surprised that there was something occurring at the exit to the Asura level difficulty.

The deep red Gate of Laws was the color of blood. It’s shaking was abnormal. Not only did violent surges of energy start spinning around, but even the power of Laws nearby stirred up.

The feeling it gave off was as if there was a terrifying storm developing within the Gate of Laws!

“There’s a change in the Asura level gate, or could it be…”

The Divine Void Crown Prince felt his heart turn cold. This sort of feeling was as if there was a problem itself with the Asura level gate! As if some extraordinary accident was about to occur!

As for the words yet to be spoken, he didn’t finish them. He thought it might be Lin Ming coming out, but he soon overruled these thoughts.

As the Divine Void Crown Prince’s voice fell, all of the other martial artists immediately raised their guards. In the final trial, anything was possible. If there was a problem with the Asura level gate, it could be a multitude of things. For instance, there could be a terrifying flow of energy rushing out, or it could even be some of the powerful enemies used to test trial challengers! Nothing would be strange!

In this sort of situation, no one was willing to bet their lives on chance. In particular, the weaker young elites began to retreat.

And at this time, with a loud bang, an explosion that shook the heavens and earth blew out. The Asura level gate violently detonated!

A savage flux of energy swept out. All of the martial artists outside were surprised. They quickly raised shields of true essence or astral essence to protect themselves, but many of them were still sent flying backwards.

There were some of them that already planned to turn tail and run. Even the Divine Void Crown Prince and the others were completely vigilant of their surroundings.

As for that violent flux of energy, it didn’t last for long. It soon gathered back together, converging at the Asura level gate, forming a blood red vortex!

Everyone was bewildered. As they looked towards that blood red vortex, they immediately saw a silhouette appear. This person had disheveled hair and ruined clothes, slowly stepping out and dragging a spear behind him. Every step this person took seemed to resonate with the heartbeats of all martial artists outside!

The flexible armor covering his body had been shattered to pieces and his boots were nothing but strips of barely intact cloth. It was hard to imagine what sort of ruinous battle he had just been in. But in contrast to his harried appearance, his eyes flashed like bolts of lightning in the night sky. Even the blood red light of the Asura level gate was unable to cover up the blinding light of his spirit!

His eyes shook everyone present, as if they were all seen through by him.

The moment this person’s shadow appeared, Duke Fullmoon froze like statue. For a long time, the only movement was his wildly twitching throat. He gulped again and again, and then finally said with a trembling voice, “That person… that man… that is Lin Ming!??!”

“Lin Ming! The Divine Runic Masters Guild’s Lin Ming!”

Many people cried out together with Duke Fullmoon.

Lin Ming had come out! He had come out from the Asura level difficulty Gate of Laws!?

This was… unbelievable!

In this moment, as Suya saw Lin Ming, her eyes became wet. Her understanding of Lin Ming was far worse than Xiao Moxian’s. She originally thought Lin Ming’s chances of survival were slim, with nine chances of death and one chance of life. But now that she saw Lin Ming appear, she was ecstatic!

Lin Ming’s completion percent was unimportant. As long as he could emerge alive, that was all that mattered.

“Big Brother Lin, you really passed!”

Xiao Moxian happily shouted. She ran towards Lin Ming and flew into his arms like a gust of wind.

According to what she knew of Lin Ming, since Lin Ming was able to come out, he would inevitably have obtained a massive harvest from the Asura level difficulty. Lin Ming’s character was that of one who didn’t concede easily. No matter what he tried to do, as long as he did it he would put his all into it!

“Big Brother Lin...” At this time, Xiao Moxian sniffed. Even though she was confident in Lin Ming, emotions were irrational. She feared that Lin Ming might have experienced some accident. Only upon feeling Lin Ming’s warm and solid chest did she feel relieved.

“I’m fine.” Lin Ming gently rubbed Xiao Moxian’s head. He let out a long sigh. This trial hadn’t been easy at all. Facing the Black Asura’s last attack, he had nearly lost his life then and there.
