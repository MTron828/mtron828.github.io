Chapter 1079 – To Make Things Difficult

…

…

…

“What Mirrorjade said makes a great deal of sense!” As the Great Elder heard White Mirrorjade’s words, he praised him without hesitation. “Good. Then, if we do not return the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree, that is the same as protecting him! Also, we’ve paid no small price in order to defend the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree these past years. Although we’ve managed to block off all news of the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree and keep it highly confidential, this news did leak out 10,000 years ago. Because of that, a powerful influence tried to move against our Carefree Island and steal away the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree. The old Island Master paid a great price to invite a half-step World King master here to personally manage the array formations of Carefree Palace; only then were we able to repel that powerful influence. Without us, how could the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree still be safe!?”

The Great Elder suddenly recalled the great war that had been stirred up 10,000 years ago for the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree and found another reason to keep it.

From the start, Xiao Skywhite had been watching on from the sidelines with icy eyes. As he heard the Great Elder mention the war of 10,000 years ago, he sneered and said, “The truth is that there is a matter I’ve hidden from you all. 10,000 years ago, in the war of our sects, it wasn’t my father who hired a master to come and help us. Rather, that half-step World King was significantly related to the mysterious person who left behind the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree and that was the only reason they helped us. Really, did you all think it was so easy to invite a half-step World King powerhouse?”

“What?”

As Xiao Skywhite spoke, everyone was left shocked. The Great Elder’s eyes widened like he had swallowed down a pound of arsenic, staring on speechlessly with flummoxed eyes.

The Great Elder thought for a moment and said, “Impossible! That’s impossible! If that mysterious person really had the ability to take back the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree, then why would he wait for such a long time? Just who would leave such a divine tree at some place without taking it back for 50,000 years and even help to protect it! I do not believe that someone would be kind-hearted to such an extent! Moreover, he actually sent an eighth stage Life Destruction junior to come and request to take back the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree! Isn’t that just a joke? Island Master Xiao, I know that the old Island Master is your father and you do not wish to violate the promises you made, but that doesn’t mean you have to come up with such baseless reasons like this! If you feel sorry then there are also other ways in which we can compensate that boy Lin Ming.”

After hearing Xiao Skywhite’s words, the Great Elder’s expression softened a bit but he clearly didn’t believe the given reasons.

At this point, White Mirrorjade seemed to nonchalantly say, “That Lin Ming is extremely talented. In the future, the boundary he reaches might be no less than mine. If we give him too many benefits and also allow him to leave Carefree Island, he might not remember our kindness nor understand that we are trying to protect him. On the contrary, he might bear a grudge for not being able to take back the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree. After a thousand years, when he’s grown, he might return and…”

White Mirrorjade let his words trail off as he spoke. However, those present weren’t idiots; they naturally understood the meaning behind them. This move was truly ruthless. This man was merciless to the extreme!

Great Elder Xiao Haogan’s eyebrows jumped up. But, what White Mirrorjade said was true. If they gave Lin Ming some compensation and allowed him to leave then that was the same as releasing the tiger to the mountain. This would only bring trouble in the future. It would be good if he didn’t manage to grow, but once he did he would surely bring a calamity back to them. This was what people meant when they said that a truly great man had to be ruthless and their actions also had to be decisive. They could not allow themselves to be shackled down by ideas of morality and justice, otherwise they would reap what they sowed!

“Island Master Xiao, how about this. If you want to follow the wishes of the old Island Master then you can return the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree to that boy, and then you can be considered as having completed your father’s will. Then, I will send some people to take back the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree. Wouldn’t that be perfect? The Divine Realm is a jungle where strength is the only law. Isn’t people killing and robbing others something that happens all the time?”

As Xiao Skywhite saw Xiao Haogan and White Mirrorjade become increasingly cruel in their words, his eyebrows jumped up. Mo Riverbliss was also watching this meeting from Carefree Palace!

However, Mo Riverbliss had a special status; she couldn’t appear before these people. In the war of 10,000 years ago, she had changed her appearance and risked herself to help when she had no other choice. But if she appeared again, and with the ruckus around the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree added on, then that would surely arouse a great deal of interest and make things that much more dangerous for her!

After all, Mo Riverbliss was a character who was just a bit away from becoming a World King. Even though the Divine Realm was immeasurably vast, this news would spread far.

Xiao Skywhite certainly didn’t want Mo Riverbliss to appear, but he was not the only one in Carefree Island. It was difficult for him to handle all of these people. Even though there were many Elders that wouldn’t outwardly oppose returning the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree because of their ideas of morality, they would still pull their support after being convinced by Xiao Haogan and White Mirrorjade.

Xiao Skywhite deeply glared at the Great Elder and White Mirrorjade. Then, he slowly said, “You want to kill someone and steal their wealth? I fear that before you can do that, you will have already died! Some matters are beyond the scope of your understanding. She will have scruples about some matters, but if you dare to touch her bottom line you will die without even having known how you died. Do not blame me for not having reminded you!”

Xiao Skywhite’s words began to contain a clear killing content. The Great Elder shrank back, his back going cold, and even White Mirrorjade stiffened, fidgeting about. Xiao Skywhite’s words seemed random, but they weren’t lies meant to scare them.

Who was this ‘she’?

If there really was such an existence, then why would she place the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree at Carefree Island for 50,000 years, and then send some junior to take it back when she wanted it returned?

After Xiao Skywhite spoke, he left in a fit of anger. The old Island Master was his father, but thousands of years ago he had gone wandering the universe to seek adventure and a turning point to break through to the next boundary. As for Xiao Skywhite, his records of qualifications and merits were lacking, thus he couldn’t control the situation in the sect.

Moreover, Xiao Skywhite knew that behind Great Elder Xiao Haogan, there was actually the three Highest Elders supporting him. In other words, if he wanted to return the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree then he would have to suppress these three Highest Elders first. Each one of them was a cornerstone of Carefree Island.

“Senior Mo…”

As Xiao Skywhite returned to the mystic realm in Carefree Palace, he stood in front of the bamboo house and called out with a bit of shame.

“Mm… there’s no need to say anything. I have an approximate understanding of the situation. In truth, when I agreed to place the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree in the keeping of Carefree Palace 50,000 years ago, I already expected that something like this would happen. But, I still did so because Carefree Island is the escape path for the Verdant Feather Holy Lands. In the future, if Eversnow wishes to reform the Verdant Feather Holy Lands she must take Carefree Island as the foundation. Thus, Carefree Island’s strength is naturally important.

“The Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree is Carefree Island’s dragon vein, its vital treasure. To take it away is the same as tearing out that dragon vein, and it will also have an enormous effect on Carefree Island’s destiny; it will even slow down Carefree Island on its path to becoming a Holy Land. I naturally wouldn’t make such a decision easily, and I definitely wouldn’t use brute strength to kill those factions that oppose it. This is because my decision is related to whether or not the Verdant Feather Holy Lands will be able to smoothly reconstruct itself in the future. I can’t be careless with the choices I make.”

Xiao Skywhite relaxed and let out a sigh of relief upon hearing Mo Riverbliss’ words. He had thought that Mo Riverbliss would support Mo Eversnow without reserve, but as he thought about it, to Mo Riverbliss, both Carefree Palace and Lin Ming were important; both were the meat of her palm. Even with Mo Eversnow here she wouldn’t immediately or easily give the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree to Lin Ming. Rather, she needed to observe him to make sure that he had enough talent and strength to shoulder the great responsibility that was the future reformation of the Verdant Feather Holy Lands. Only after doing that would she make her decision.

As for the meeting today, that was just to make sure that the Elders of the opposing factions were mentally prepared, lest there be confusion in the upper echelons of Carefree Island if the Ten Severing Dao Fruit Tree was suddenly taken away.

Xiao Skywhite felt much more at ease as he thought of this. At the minimum, he didn’t have to worry about some people enraging Mo Riverbliss and causing her to kill some of them in secret. This would place Carefree Palace, which was already experiencing troubles, in an even more tenuous position! Moreover, if high level powerhouses of Carefree Island were to suddenly die, this would surely cause panic. With the threat of Splintersoul Mountain and the Occult Bone Clan constantly looming over them, if they weren’t careful this would even cause damage to Carefree Island’s very foundation.

Xiao Skywhite excused himself. Then, in that bamboo house, Mo Eversnow appeared in front of Mo Riverbliss, her soul form slowly floating in the air. With her slender feet peeking out of her long dress, she seemed like an immortal fairy fluttering through the wind, elegant and untainted by the world.

“Aunty… you seem like you don’t believe Lin Ming?” Mo Eversnow said in a soft tone. Although her face was calm, there was a trace of exasperation in her eyes, barely perceptible. She was clearly not too pleased with Mo Riverbliss’ methods.

As Mo Riverbliss caught sight of Mo Eversnow’s expression, she chuckled and serenely said, “I naturally trust Little Snow’s judgment. It’s just that… aunty is already old. I wouldn’t be able to withstand a mistake again, otherwise I fear that I won’t be able to see the day that the Verdant Feather Holy Lands will be reformed. In the past, your grandfather made a mistake, and that was that he didn’t kill Tian Mingzi upon discovering the seed of ambition that grew in his heart, finally ending with the worst result possible…”

As Mo Riverbliss spoke to here, she let out a deep sigh. Mo Eversnow also let out a sigh, no longer saying anything.

…………..

At this time, Lin Ming was still training at the spirit spring at Free Ming Pavilion, completely unaware of the matters occurring at Carefree Palace. He couldn’t be blamed for being dull-minded. He simply didn’t know that the resources Mo Eversnow spoke of were already being used by Carefree Palace, and that taking them away would affect Carefree Palace’s foundations.

Lin Ming had originally thought that these resources were kept solely by Mo Riverbliss and that the Elders of Carefree Palace didn’t know of them. Also, since Mo Riverbliss seemed to love her niece very much, she wouldn’t have much resistance in passing the resources to him.

As Lin Ming was training, a few miles away from Free Ming Pavilion, several core disciples of Carefree Island appeared. Ye Rosewater and White Mirrorjade were among them.

“Free Ming Palace? Haha, is that the boy Lin Ming’s residence? Did you change the signboard for him?”

The one who spoke was a disciple named Liu Yun. After arriving at Carefree Pavilion, he was the first one to spit out these words. He glanced at Ye Rosewater, a faint smile on his face as he spoke. He was also a direct disciple of Carefree Island and his talent was quite good, just a bit worse than Ye Rosewater and White Mirrorjade’s.

“Yes, I changed it.” Ye Rosewater frowned, not too comfortable with the sly look that Liu Yun was shooting her.

“Okay. Senior-apprentice Brother White, this is the boy you spoke of? He’s just an eighth stage Life Destruction nobody, someone whose existence is no different from an ant’s. And yet he actually came to my Carefree Island and he wants to take away the divine tree? That is just the funniest joke I’ve heard in my entire life. Come on, let’s go and take a look at just what sort of pure-hearted fool this boy is.”
