Chapter 853: So Cool, I Want To Marry Him!

He…spoke…

Everyone was stunned.

Guan Ziyao looked surprised. Guan Zhichen, who was still yelling a moment ago, was silenced.

He had really spoken…

This dumb kid actually said that he was not worthy of him to speak!

Guan Rui’s confidence was shattered in an instant.

How was that possible!?

He had spent a lot of time investigating the child even before he came back to the country and he was sure that the kidnap had left a severe psychological scar on the child, leaving him mute in the past two years…

He even had such a low self-esteem and ran away by just listening to Guan Ziyao and Yan Ruyi’s conversation, yet now, not only did he not lose control, he even spoke…

The tables had turned.

"So…so cool…" someone from the crowd commented.

The comment worked like a switch and it sparked exciting discussions…

"Oh my God! He is just five years old! He looks so soft and cute, but that moment was just so cool!"

"I want to marry him! I wish I had been born 10 or 20 years later!"

"Lu Tingxiao is too hard to deal with, I hope Little Treasure doesn’t mind a girl older than him…"

…

Little Treasure’s fluffy face had the same expression as his father. He did not even look at Guan Zhichen and just walked away from the crowd calmly while holding Ning Xi’s hand.

The small silhouette left a large impact. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Oh…Little Treasure is so neat!" Lu Jingli hugged his own brother.

Lu Tingxiao looked through the crowd and his eyes met Ning Xi’s. He pushed Lu Jingli away as his cold expression softened like the snow melting in spring.

"Is it just me or did that feel satisfying? Guan Zhichen was overdoing it just now. Even if Little Treasure is really autistic, he really shouldn’t be doing that! He’s forcing him to talk! How could he talk if he’s autistic? Does he feel very happy to prove that Little Treasure is sick?"

"That’s right, so what if he’s a genius? How can a top student really be so rude? It was just only one question that he couldn’t solve and he got that angry! Who does he think he is? The world doesn’t revolve around him!"

"Not only is he jealous, he’s very unkind as well…what was he thinking when talking to a five-year-old kid? The Little Master was right, he’s not worthy!"

"Thank goodness it was just rumors. The Little Master is well, and extremely talented! His IQ and EQ is way superior than Guan Zhichen's!"

…

Some people were unhappy with Guan Zhichen’s behavior, especially when they saw a cute child like Little Treasure being bullied. Their motherly instincts surfaced and they harshly criticized Guan Zhichen’s personality.
