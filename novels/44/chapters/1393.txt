Chapter 1394: Don’t Let Him Get Near

Annie then repeated her examination and said, "But, Bro Xi, don't worry. Fortunately, you told Bro Shen to let me go for a month. In this month, I'll help you nurse your cousin. I'll also use acupuncture to help her remove some toxins in her body.

"As long as she follows what I say, takes her medicine on time and rests properly, at most, it will take three to five years. If she's lucky, she can probably recover in one to two years. Then, it might be possible for her to get pregnant successfully."

The tensed Ning Xi was relieved."That's great… As long as there's hope! Annie, thank you!"

"You don't have to thank me, Bro Xi. Your cousin is my cousin as well! Oh, right…" Annie looked at the girl on the bed and she reminded, "Under this situation, the patient's psychological state is important as well. I'm not sure what she went through but, Bro Xi, you have to take care of her, and make her stay happy most of the time. If necessary, hire a professional psychiatrist!"

"Okay, I get it. Thanks for reminding! I'll contact one later. I know someone!" Ning Xi looked a little worried as she looked at Ning Tianxin.

Suddenly, her phone rang. It was Xiao Tao.

Ning Xi then remembered that today was the opening ceremony for "Nine Realms", so she quickly picked up the phone. "Hello, Xiao Tao?"

"Bro Xi, are you up yet? The ceremony is starting in two hours. Don't forget about it!"

"Alright, got it." Ning Xi ended the call.

"Bro Xi, if you're busy, you can leave first. I'll take care of her!" Annie assured.

Ning Xi hugged her gratefully. "Thank you, Annie. If it wasn't for you, I really don't know what to do. I'll leave first and I'll get back as soon as possible. If there's anything, do give me a call. If you need anything, call this number and he'll help you out!"

Ning Xi then passed Xiong Zhi's number to her.

"Okay, go now!"

After she left the room, Ning Xi called Xiong Zhi.

"Miss Xiao Xi, anything I can help?"

"My cousin is in the hospital right now. I'm fine with just Shi Xiao for now. Do help me out at the hospital. There's another girl in the room called Annie. She's my friend. If she needs anything, help her… But the most important point is not to let Mo Lingtian get near her! Remember that!"

Ning Xi especially focused on the last part of her sentence.

"Got it, Miss Ning Xi! I'll not let him get near her!" Xiong Zhi did not ask why and promised her.

"Okay, that's all for now. Thank you."

Ning Xi left the hospital after she had settled everything.

At Movie City, Ning Xi changed into her outfit and put on her makeup. She had reached half an hour earlier.

Ceremonies like these would usually have a blessed day and time picked out and being late to such a function would be deemed unlucky.

The main cast, director, filmmakers, and producers all came one after another. There were also several important investors, and of course, the media partners. The place was buzzing.

The table was all prepared, covered with a red cloth. A Guan Di figurine was put on it, and beside it was an incense burner together with some fresh fruits and a roast pig as an offering.
