Chapter 73: Continue, Don’t Stop

The girls who were watching on set started going crazy again.

"Ahhh! Muye bondage play! In my dreams I want to tie Muye up and throw him onto the bed!"

"What are you so excited about, you’re not the one going up there later!"

"I’m so mad! So mad! Why does it have to be that hateful vixen?!"

"Seriously, it sucks, can't Muye tell the director to switch her out? She doesn't deserve Muye at all!"

…

"Ahem…" Guo Qisheng coughed to signal for everyone to be quiet, then he clapped his hands and shouted, "Okay, everyone get ready! Three, two, one, action!"

Ning Xi was not the slightest bit affected by the talk around around her. At the director’s words, Ning Xi’s eyes suddenly changed.

They were the eyes of a 16-year-old girl, clear and lively. The lazy, devil-may-care expression on her face was also perfect.

She lifted the hem of what she was wearing, raised one foot, and kicked open the door to her room.

The camera then cut to Jiang Muye.

Seeing the young man with his hands and feet tied, lying on top of the red covers of the bed, the color making his face look paler and weaker, really made people want to ravish him.

Hearing the kick at the door, Sun Huanqing slowly opened his eyes, and looked dazedly at the girl approaching the bed, silhouetted against the light.

Meng Changge sat down beside the bed, and from her bosom, she plucked out a small bag made from oil paper. "Sugar-fried chestnuts from the Fuxing building, I had to queue for an hour to buy them. Want any?"

Sun Huanqing turned his head away and closed his eyes, refusing to respond. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meng Changge peeled a chestnut and tossed it into her mouth with a twinkling smile. "Not eating? Then I'll feed it to you! And I’ll do it in a way that might make you shy…"

"You…" Sun Huanqing immediately opened eyes that were filled with three parts anger and seven parts humiliation. "How can you be so shameless as a girl?!"

Meng Changge slanted him a sideway glance and raised her eyebrow. "Shame? What use is shame? Can shame slay your enemies, or get you a daughter-in-law?"

Sun Huanqing's face was full of indignation. "The Meng family has been loyal for generations, your ancestors always fought on the frontlines, but you… you spend your days being a good-for-nothing and a tyrant, how can you face your ancestors?"

Meng Changge had already heard too much of this sort of talk from the people around her, and she stuck her fingers in her ears. Then she said loudly around the chestnut in her mouth, "You’re so old and you’re still unmarried; among the three ways to be unfilial, having no sons is the worst. Can you face your Sun ancestors?"

Sun Huanqing was infuriated by her twisting his words back on him, and said sternly, "This and that are two different things. Moreover, I have an ambition beyond this!"

Meng Changge braced herself on the edge of the bed with one foot and lashed Sun Huanqing over and over again with a whip she held in one hand. Finally, she lifted his chin in a gesture that was neither soft nor rough. The expression on her face was like that of a little, cunning, naughty fox. "Doctor Sun, what about this? I’ll be your wife. When I become your wife, then I’ll listen to everything you say. If you want me to go east, I won’t go west. If you want me to learn to be good, I’ll also obediently listen to you. This way, won’t we all be able to face our ancestors?"

Sun Huanqing was stunned, and a flash of urgency slipped over his face. "You… don’t talk nonsense!"

Meng Changge looked like she had discovered a new world. She drew closer to him until she was almost right up in his face. "Hmm? Doctor Sun, you’re blushing! You actually like me, don't you? So why don’t we do something that cannot be undone?"

"Cut —"

Until the director yelled "cut", everyone had been full of anticipation. Why did they stop, why don’t they continue?! We want to keep watching! We want to see what cannot be undone, done!
