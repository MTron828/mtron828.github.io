Chapter 69: So Handsome My Legs Are Weak

The production crew today was the same as usual, and didn’t act differently just because the second male lead would be joining them today.

The main male lead Zhao Sizhou was surrounded by girls whose faces were worshipful as they listened to him talk about his glorious history in the entertainment industry. Jia Qingqing and Ning Xueluo’s relationship had recently been getting better, and they were cheerfully talking about the diamond bracelet her dad had bought her.

It was only Ning Xi who was on tentherhooks. After all, she had a lot of scenes with the second male lead, and the quality of his acting would have a huge impact on her.

Jia Qingqing played with the sparkling diamond bracelet around her wrist, a scornful look on her face. "Sister Xueluo, look at how she’s waiting so eagerly! She actually believed the director’s words; does she think that if she waits like that, a Pan An will appear?"

Ning Xueluo said helplessly, "You, don’t always pick on Ning Xi. She has the most scenes with the second male lead, it’s natural that she would be more concerned than we are!"

"Hehe, yes, so many kissing and bed scenes! Luckily I didn’t take the role from the start, otherwise who knows how much I would be taken advantage of!" Jia Qingqing rejoiced. She then looked admiringly at Ning Xueluo.&nbsp;"Sister Xueluo, you are still the luckiest, your boyfriend is so handsome, your partner is also so handsome…"

…

At that moment, Director Guo Qisheng’s excited voice could be heard at the studio entrance —

"Come, come, everybody come here! Our second male lead who is the actor for the miracle doctor Sun Huanqing is here! Come and greet him!"

There was hardly any response from the crew. Zhao Sizhou didn’t look like he wanted to stand up at all; the girls were still gathered around him, scrambling to have him read their palms.

Jia Qingqing made a dismissive sound and didn’t even bother to look outside. Ning Xueluo touched up her makeup before getting up and saying persuasively, "We should greet him, we are all colleagues, after all."

Reluctantly, Jia Qingqing followed her out.

Ning Xi had naturally flown over at the very beginning and was craning her head to take a look. In the next second, her whole body felt like she&nbsp;had been struck by the Ninth Heaven God of Lightning.

The guy beside the director was…

That eye-catching golden hair… she couldn’t deceive herself that her eyes were mistaken, even if she wanted to…

Why would the second male lead be that guy…

This. Is. Not. Real…

At the entrance, the production assistant Xiao Li suddenly screamed as if he was being murdered. "Ah— ahhh…" Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jia Qingqing furrowed her brow. "Are you crazy?! What are you shouting about?"

As soon as she spoke,, out of the corner of her eye, she saw the man behind the director at the entrance…

"Ah…" She couldn’t help screaming either.

"What’s wrong?" Ning Xueluo asked.

"Jiang… Jiang Muye! Sister Xueluo! It’s actually Jiang Muye!" Jia Qingqing excitedly pinched Ning Xueluo’s arm.

"What?" Ning Xueluo followed her gaze.

The director was walking ahead with a cheerful and hospitable attitude. Following next to him was a blonde man in trendy shorts and a T-shirt. Hands in his pockets, his face showed his special brand of yuppie arrogance, and when he smiled, he showed his very cute canines…

Jiang Muye… the second male lead was actually Jiang Muye…

Even Ning Xueluo was astonished at this outcome.

The girls who had been around Zhao Sizhou earlier now rushed the entrance like hungry wolves:

"Wowww! Jiang Muye! Is it really Jiang Muye? Am I going blind? Quick, somebody pinch me!"

"My god! He really is sex on legs! He’s crazy handsome! So handsome my legs are weak! I heard he even has granny fans! Even eighty-year-old grandmothers can’t escape!"

"No one stop me, it’s so hard to meet the real person, I must sleep with him! A life where I can’t sleep with Jiang Muye isn’t any different from the life of a salted fish!"
