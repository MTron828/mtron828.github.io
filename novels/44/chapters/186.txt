Chapter 187: Mysterious Package

"Darling, were you scared?" A little worried, Ning Xi looked at Little Treasure.

Little Treasure shook his head, and clung to her arms. He didn’t seem frightened, and in fact, looked a little depressed.

Why was he only five years old?

He really wanted to grow up quickly.

That way, he could protect her, and not just watch from afar.

Lu Tingxiao obviously saw right through his son's thoughts: This is your father's job, stop trying to do it.

"Only a few people know my address, who would send me these packages…" Ning Xi grunted as she picked up one of the express boxes. She looked at the name of the sender, but the handwriting was so indistinct that she couldn’t make it out clearly.

Lu Tingxiao was about to ask her if she needed a knife, but Ning Xi had already skillfully ripped the package open by hand.

This was probably a skill every girl should have.

After opening the outer layer of the package, she saw a bottle of very nice-looking perfume in an exquisitely wrapped gift box. There was also a very simple note: Happy birthday.

In the rearview mirror, Lu Tingxiao looked at Ning Xi’s extremely happy expression: "Friend?"

Ning Xi carefully put the perfume back, and then said, "It's my cousin! I told you before that my second uncle has a son and three daughters, right? The son is not his, and two of his daughters are illegitimate children which he had with women outside. My second auntie only had one child, my cousin Ning Tianxin!"

Lu Tingxiao looked a little relieved. So it was her cousin. Good, a cousin was very good.

Ning Xi had a longing expression on her face. "When I was living with the Ning family, she was the only one who was good to me. Although she looks very cold, it’s only on the outside, she’s actually a warm person.

"It was a pity that at the beginning I didn’t get too close to her because she looked too cold. I didn’t take her words to heart when she considerately reminded me several times to be wary of Ning Xueluo…

"In fact, Sister Xin’s character is very similar to yours. You both look very cold but actually are very nice!"

Lu Tingxiao: "…"

He had been praised. But he didn’t know if he should be happy. Was this the legendary nice guy status?

After Ning Xi said that, she opened the second package.

While the writing wasn’t illegible, the name of the sender wasn’t written anywhere at all.

"Eh? An anonymous package… I’ve been slammed so badly recently, isn’t it better if I don’t casually open an anonymous package?" As Ning Xi spoke, she shook it. There was no sound from inside, and she couldn’t hear anything.

"Let me open it for you." From the driver's seat, Lu Tingxiao stretched out his hand.

"Ah?" Just as Ning Xi was about to remind him that he was driving and so couldn’t help her, she saw Liu Tingxiao take his hand off the steering wheel, but the car continued to travel along steadily, even turning itself when they reached an intersection.

Ning Xi was completely stunned. "What… what is with this car?"

Lu Tingxiao replied indifferently: "Its system was modified a bit."

Ning Xi: "…"

It was not unusual to have a car that could drive itself nowadays. But you actually modified it yourself???

Only then did she realize that, while the car looked like a several hundred thousand yuan model of a generic, mid-range brand on the outside, the features inside the car were quite different.

Did Lu Tingxiao wind up just using the shell and changing everything inside?

Was the seat under her butt actually real leather? The metal armrest was so lustrous, was it made from some high-tech material? The jade pendant hanging in the front for protection was exceptionally translucent, was it… an ice jadeite…

She simply didn’t dare to continue thinking…

Ning Xi came back to herself with some difficulty, and then nervously reminded Lu Tingxiao, "Lu Tingxiao, you must be careful! In case the package is really…"

Just then, there was the sound of a "bang"…

The jadeite is perhaps the world’s most expensive gem, and the ice jadeite the rarest of them all.
