Chapter 63: Fight Three Hundred Rounds

The car drove through the main gate, and Ning Xi asked casually, "Jiang Muye, what number is your villa?"

"No. 6."

"…"Ning Xi’s expression was slightly stunned, it was actually No.6.

Villas at the Platinum Palace were divided into different classes. The best was undoubtedly Big Demon King Lu’s No.8 castle. It covered the most territory, with a big lake and flower garden behind it, and a personal golf course. The next was Lu Jingli’s No.7 villa. No.6 was of the same standard as No.7.

Nobody knew who the owner of villa No.6 was. She hadn’t expected that it would actually be Jiang Muye this guy.

Seeing Lei Ming about to go right, Ning Xi instinctively reminded him, "Ai, Brother Ming, don't go this way, it’s blocked…"

"How do you know it’s blocked?" Jiang Muye asked instantly.

Ning Xi’s heart thumped, but on the surface, she calmly gave him a haughty look. "Didn’t you see the warning sign on the side?"

Actually, some drunk rich heir had had an accident on that road; she had seen it with her own eyes when she passed through there yesterday.

Jiang Muye saw the "Construction Ahead" sign by the side of the road, and said, "Oh".

Ning Xi secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Even though she had a proper reason to stay at Lu Tingxiao’s, it was still too troublesome and too complicated to explain; she might as well save herself the trouble!

When they arrived, Ning Xi was feeling bitter; how she wanted to sneak home directly and hug Little Treasure!

Lei Ming got out of the car and said to Jiang Muye, "You can move in directly since someone has been keeping it clean while you were gone. Do you want to stay here or at the apartment that the company arranged for you? If you stay here, it might be a little inconvenient for you to get around. "

Nearby, Ning Xi was thinking privately, don’t stay here! What if one day they ran into each other?

"I’ll see, let’s decide later!" Jiang Muye waved his hand impatiently, and looked at Lei Ming as if urging him to get on with it.

Lei Ming sighed as he looked at both of them, and gave a worried reminder: "Don’t stay up too late, the both of you. Muye, don't forget tomorrow, you have…"

"Got it, got it!" Jiang Muye didn't pay much attention to him, and dragged Ning Xi inside the house, like a bandit vanishing in a wisp of smoke.

Lei Ming: "…" He already knew the two of them wouldn't be able to get up early the next morning… Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After entering, Jiang Muye pulled his fingers one by one, with the face of someone preparing for battle. "Don’t listen to Brother Ming, Ning Xiao Xi, you have to fight three hundred rounds with me tonight! See if I don’t torture you to death!"

Ning Xi looked at him disdainfully. "Hehe, as you wish! You’ve already suffered defeat at my hands, you still dare say such big words! I’ll make you beg to call me granny!"

"You wish! You are the one who’s going to call me grandpa!" Jiang Muye buried his head in his huge travel case as he searched it. "I brought back the latest equipment from overseas, no need to thank me!"

Saying this, he looked at her in pain. "Can you go and freaking wash your makeup off, it’s killing my eyes! You want to use this to lower my fighting strength? Shameless! I’m telling you now, if I lose, I won’t admit it!"

"Lower my butt, I’m the one who had to lower myself, you think I enjoy being like this?" Ning Xi took the heavy wig off with a harsh pull and unbuttoned her collar. This was a lose-lose situation for both her and him equally.

Jiang Muye turned on the mega-screen TV in the living room, and started to hook up the cables. "I have clothes in my room, go and look for something to wear yourself! Hurry, hurry! My battle soul can’t endure the thirst and hunger anymore!"

"…"Ning Xi looked speechlessly at his excited appearance.

Other people would look for a hot girl to hook up with after returning from abroad, but this guy had dragged her here by all means necessary to play games with him, and even wanted to play through the night! What a maniac!
