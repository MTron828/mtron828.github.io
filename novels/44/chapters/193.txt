Chapter 194: First Day At The Company

Ning Xi hadn’t slept well after hearing Lu Tingxiao’s words last night.

She had had weird dreams the whole night, even dreaming of that night when Zhu Xiangcheng had drugged her. She dreamt that she had lost control and pushed Lu Tingxiao onto the bed, and the scene had continued to spiral completely out of control…

Ahhhhh! Why would she have this kind of dream!

Ning Xi grabbed and pulled her hair.Turning on the tap, she splashed her face with cold water.

Cheer up, today was the first day at her new company!

Just as she was leaving, Big Bun and Little Bun gave her encouragement.

Lu Tingxiao: "Good luck."

Little Treasure raised his tablet: fighting!

The robot next to Little Bun let off fireworks, and also said in a mechanical voice, "fighting, fighting".

"Thank you, thank you!" Ning Xi kissed Little Bun and bowed to Big Boss, but was unable to look him in the eye.

Because in her dreams last night, she had almost assaulted him…

Finally. she reached Glory World Entertainment.

Standing in front of the grand, tall building, facing a whole new beginning, new opportunities, and new challenges, Ning Xi’s blood boiled in her chest and pumped her up.

As she walked into the Glory World building, she only had one thought in her mind.

No. Freaking. Mercy!

This resplendent and magnificent decor, she didn't even need to think about it to know that this was that dumbass Lu Jingli’s taste.

Following Lu Jingli’s instructions, Ning Xi took the lift directly to the seventeenth floor, and made her way to the last office on the level.

"Come in,"a woman inside said in a formal tone.

After entering the room, Ning Xi felt that her eyes had been purified.

She had nearly been blinded by the decor earlier, while this office was mainly in black, white and gray hues, and was decorated in a very simple style.

She saw a woman wearing black-framed glasses and a champagne-colored suit sitting at the desk.

"Hello, Sister Lin, I’m Ning Xi, I’ve come to report for duty!"

"Hello, Ning Xi. From today onwards, I’m your manager, Lin Zhizhi. I think you already know that I wasn't taking on new artistes, but now that Manyun has decided to retire, the company needs to nurture a new person to succeed her," Lin Zhizhi explained simply. At the same time, her eyes swept her from head to toe like a searchlight. While it gave Ning Xi a sense of pressure, it didn’t make her feel uncomfortable.

The girl in front of her was completely different to Leng Manyun, who was plain in appearance. At first glance, this girl was beautiful, and it was an extraordinary and unbridled beauty. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This quality would undoubtedly be her selling point in the entertainment industry, but at the same time, it was also a double-edged sword; it would be easy to slap the label ‘flower vase’ on her, and even easier to become entangled in messy gossip and sex scandals.

Ning Xi was a bit alarmed when she heard Lin Zhizhi’s words; she was to be nurtured to succeed Leng Manyun?

Wasn't this standard a bit too high?

However, the more difficult it was, the more excited she became. Plus, this had been her goal all alone!

"Although the company will nurture you towards becoming her successor, let me be straight with you. The test period is six months, if you can’t meet my expectations by then, you are out. You can stay in the company, but I won’t be managing you anymore. Understood?" Lin Zhizhi spoke coldly.

Ning Xi immediately nodded her head seriously. "Understood."

At this time, someone knocked on the door, and a chubby, amiable-looking girl walked in.

"This is the assistant I’ve arranged for you."

"Sister Xi, hello, I’m Hu Tao, you can call me Little Peach!" The girl introduced herself timidly.

"Hello!" Ning Xi had a very nice first impression of her chubby little assistant.

‘Flower vase’ is a term for someone who is just a pretty face.
