Chapter 212: Could He Be An Ex?

When Lu Tingxiao heard his words, he didn’t even blink, and coldly spoke two words with his thin lips. "Destroy it."

Lu Jingli immediately felt like a basin of cold water had been dumped on him. "What? Even God is helping you! You won’t even listen to this?"

Lu Tingxiao looked colder. "Need I say it twice?"

Noticing that his brother was really angry, Lu Jingli hurriedly nodded like a chicken pecking rice. "Okay, okay, okay… I’ll destroy it… I’ll destroy…"

Ai, he didn't know what to say about his brother. Apart from when he was in front of Xiao Xi Xi, he was too principled and inflexible at any other time!

Nevertheless, he was different from him. He said yes, but in his heart, he knew he wouldn’t really destroy it.

Tsk, it was ok to secretly keep it…

It would come in handy someday!

While Lu Jingli was sighing, a small figure suddenly ran like the wind downstairs and outside…

"Is Xiao Xi Xi back?" Lu Jingli hurriedly followed Little Treasure.

When he reached the gate, he saw that it really was Ning Xi, sitting in Jiang Muye’s car.

He couldn’t see anything unusual about their expressions, but Jiang Muye seemed to have drunk a lot, while Ning Xi seemed to have drunk very little.

Ning Xi left the car and picked up Little Treasure, who had rushed to greet her, saying with resignation and love, "Darling, it's already eleven o'clock. Why did you stay up so late again? Didn’t we agree that you wouldn’t wait for me!"

Little Treasure clung to Ning Xi’s arms, tightly wrapped his arms around her, and stared at Jiang Muye behind her. His little face was full of vigilance and rejection.

Jiang Muye curled his lips. How freaking unfair! This was an incomparable aid for Lu Tingxiao! An incomparable aid!

Lu Jingli read Jiang Muye’s mind with just one look, and came to pat him sympathetically on the shoulder. "My condolences, that you have no son!"

Jiang Muye’s heart jolted. "What do you mean?"

Lu Jingli came close to his ears and whispered, "Don’t pretend. You like Ning Xi, don’t you?"

Jiang Muye panicked, then put on a straight face. "Second uncle, are you kidding me? How could I like her!"

Lu Jingli touched his chin with a contemplative expression.

It was strange, really strange. What the hell had happened between them? It was obvious that Jiang Muye that guy liked her, but he wasn’t willing to admit it even now…

Ning Xi was about to walk inside with Little Treasure in her arms, when the phone in her bag rang.

She casually pressed the answer key. "Hello, who is this?"

"Hello, is this Miss Ning Xi? Your boyfriend got into a car accident and is currently being treated at the hospital! Please come immediately!"

Ning Xi looked puzzled: "What? My boyfriend?"

Immediately, Lu Jingli, Jiang Muye, Lu Tingxiao, and even Little Treasure all focused their eyes on Ning Xi. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ning Xi coughed, embarrassed. "Ahem, aren’t you mistaken? I don’t have a boyfriend!"

"But the number that the patient left before passing out was yours, you had better come soon! Our hospital’s address is…" After that, the person on the phone hung up in a hurry.

Ning Xi held her phone and stood there with an overwhelmed expression. "Holy sheet! Who the hell is he?"

Jiang Muye leaned against his car and hummed as he looked askance at her. "He’s one of your exes, isn’t he? He left your number when he almost died in an accident! He really is desperate for you!"

Ning Xi kicked him. "Be less sarcastic!"

"Then, Xiao Xi Xi, will you go?" Lu Jingli’s eyes were sparkling. Although he was asking her, his expression said that he really hoped she would go!
