Chapter 50: Sarangheyo

"You can put it down, help me thank your little young master!" Ning Xi said. She took out her cellphone to send a text message to Little Treasure.

While the people in the production crew looked like they were busy doing their jobs, all of them were actually staring in Ning Xi’s direction, very curious about what had been sent to her this time.

In the end, it seemed to be three bottles… of juice?

The first time, Ning Xi had looked troubled by the roses. The second time, she hadn’t seem very surprised or pleased with the diamond. But now, she had a happy expression on her face, and was texting cheerfully.

Everyone exclaimed:

"Ah, sure enough, money doesn’t work on beauties these days, it’s the heart that matters the most!"

"That’s right, didn’t you hear the girl say just now that the juice was personally handmade! That’s so sweet!"

"I bet the one who sent the juice will be the one to win the heart of the beauty in the end!"

"Then I bet it’s the one who sent the diamond!"

"Why is no one betting on the person who sent the flowers?"

…

…

After drinking the fruit juice and green bean soup, Ning Xi was fully revived as they continued filming.

At the same time, Lu Tingxiao was at home, having taken the time off to accompany his son, when his cellphone sounded with a ding.

It indicated that there was a new text message from Ning Xi.

Lu Tingxiao opened it, and then the corners of his mouth tilted upwards slightly.

[Darling, thank you for your juice and green bean soup! They were super super delicious! Sarangheyo!]

Lu Tingxiao looked at it for a long while before beckoning to his son, who was motionless as he looked blankly out the window. "Little Treasure, come here."

Little Treasure ignored him.

Lu Tingxiao sighed slightly. "It’s a message from your Auntie Xiao Xi."

Little Treasure ran at him like a rocket, and jumped up to reach for the cellphone.

Lu Tingxiao raised it out of his reach. "I can show it to you, if you call me ‘dad’." Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Little Bun’s face was full of protest as he refused to cooperate.

It was only until his son was so fitful that he almost cried, that Lu Tingxiao finally relented and handed him the phone.

Looking at his son read the text message with pure satisfaction on his face, Lu Tingxiao’s expression was worried.

It was probably because there was very little in the world that could distress him, that god had sent Little Treasure to test him.

Little Treasure was very clever; he had only been six months old when he started speaking. Although he had a quiet character and didn’t speak much to begin with, ever since that accident, he had not spoken ever again.

He had missed too many parts of Little Treasure’s childhood, and when he wanted to make up for it, he found that it was too late.

He wondered if the day would ever come that he could hear him call him ‘dad’ again…

Little Treasure stared at the phone for a long time, as if there was something that he didn’t understand. Then he went over to his father, and pointed at the phrase "Sarangheyo" with his little finger, probably asking him what it meant.

"Modal particle, it doesn’t have any special meaning," Lu Tingxiao replied seriously.

"Pu - oppa, you’re not cultured, don't misguide Little Treasure! ‘Sarangheyo’ means ‘I love you’ in Korean, okay?" Lu Jingli skipped over, making the shape of a heart with his hands.

When Little Treasure heard this, he gave his father a disdainful look, then ran off to continue juicing fruit.

Lu Tingxiao was fluent in twelve languages. If Ning Xi had written in Korean, he would have definitely known it, but written this way, he didn’t understand it at all.

"You don't have to work?" Lu Tingxiao looked askance at Lu Jingli, with the expression of a boss managing his employee.

Lu Jingli immediately moved a chair over to sit in front of him, a thrilled expression on his face. "Boss, I have something very important to report to you!"

Lu Tingxiao couldn’t be bothered to speak, his expression indicating that if Lu Jingli wanted to fart, he should just do so.

Lu Jingli waved his hands with extreme excitement. "Do you know what I just heard? Today, Xiao Xi Xi’s admirers sent her gifts on set!"

"The fruit juice and green bean soup that Little Treasure sent her," Lu Tingxiao answered calmly.

"I know, but before those, other people had also sent her gifts. Furthermore, it was two of them. One sent red roses which covered the whole film site, and the other sent a big diamond!"

Lu Tingxiao’s slowly started to grow cold; on such a hot summer day, it helped immensely to relieve the heat.

…

While ‘oppa’ means brother in Korea, it’s only used by women to address men older than them.

Ning Xi used the transliteration of the word ‘Sarangheyo’ into Chinese pinyin.
