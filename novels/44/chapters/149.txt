Chapter 150: The Most Romantic Birthday

"Let’s go." Lu Tingxiao held her hand and walked inside.

It was an extremely natural gesture.

Ning Xi looked at their joined hands. Even though she knew that Lu Tingxiao was just worried that something else would happen, there was a small, strange feeling inside her heart.

The lighting in the control room was really dim; the only illumination present was the cold light from dozens of working computers.

Ning Xi followed Lu Tingxiao as they walked pass the computers, and finally found Little Treasure beside the biggest machine.

Beneath that colossal machine, with countless wires attached to it, Little Treasure looked so small as he sat in a custom-made chair and stared numbly at countless sequences flashing across the screen. Standing next to him was a robot that looked like a smaller version of him. In its hand, it held a gun barrel which was pointed in Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao’s direction.

Looking at the cold, lifeless expression on Little Treasure’s face, Ning Xi felt as if her heart was being squeezed tightly by iron claws, and she almost couldn’t breathe from the pain.

"Little Treasure…" she said shakily.

Staring at the screen, the little guy didn't react at all.

Ning Xi was really scared, she had only heard Lu Tingxiao and the others talk about it before; she had never seen with her own eyes what Little Treasure was like when he was ill.

"What should we do… this is all my fault…"

"Ning Xi, don’t blame yourself, it’s alright, this happens to him quite often. Call his name a few times, and he’ll be fine," Lu Tingxiao comforted her.

In reality, it was only because it was Ning Xi that Lu Tingxiao said that to her. If it had been anyone else, there was no way it would be that easy.

With some effort, Ning Xi calmed herself down, and step by step, carefully drew closer to Little Treasure.

The little robot’s head turned with Ning Xi’s every move, but Little Treasure still didn’t react.

When Ning Xi reached Little Treasure, she bent over slowly, and carefully held one little hand. "Little Treasure… Auntie’s back… I’m sorry… something happened last night, so Auntie couldn't come back in time…"

Ning Xi couldn't explain to him what happened, and could only hang her head in pain.

She didn’t know how much time had passed until suddenly, a little fist appeared in her field of vision.

Then, that little fist opened slowly, and in the middle of that soft little palm was a pink hair clip. The clip had a hundred little diamonds on it, which formed the shape of a heart, and it twinkled brightly under the cold machine lights.

"This…" Ning Xi immediately lifted her head, both surprised and happy, even though there was still no expression on the little guy’s face.

On the side, Lu Tingxiao looked at the hair clip in his son’s palm, and said, "This is Little Treasure’s birthday gift to you."

"For me…"It really was diamonds!

At that moment, Ning Xi felt a little uncomfortable.

Lu Tingxiao understood her feelings, and explained, "They’re just normal crystals, and not expensive. But Little Treasure glued on all ninety-nine crystals himself."

Ning Xi was immediately deeply moved after hearing that. She didn't take the hair clip, but said to Little Treasure, "Can you help Auntie put it on?"

Little Treasure was a little sluggish when his gaze moved to the hair clip. Then he reached out one small hand, and clumsily pinned the hair clip next to her ear.

Ning Xi touched the clip with happiness written all over her face. "Does it look good?"

Little Treasure nodded.

Finally getting a response from Little Treasure, Ning Xi could no longer help herself, and pulled the little guy into her arms.

At the same time, the little robot beside them shot out colorful ribbons with a bang, and started to play a birthday song.

Ning Xi teared up when she lifted her head to look at the colorful ribbons fluttering in the air. "Thank you darling, this is the most romantic birthday I’ve ever had!"
