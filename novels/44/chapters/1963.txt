Chapter 1964: Darling Follow Me Home

“Careful.”

Lu Tingxiao immediately pushed Ning Xi behind him to protect her.

They knew in their hearts that Han Xiao’s white tiger was familiar with humans. From the moment the tiger brought Han Xiao over and the way the tiger acted afterward, they could already tell that it was not vicious.

However, almost out of instinct, humans would still maintain a certain level of vigilance towards wild beasts who were at the top of the food chain.

Ning Xi stared at the Bengal tiger and probed by gently calling out, “Darling!”

When it heard Ning Xi calling out, the white tiger clearly hesitated. It slowly got up and was waving its white tail at Ning Xi.

Lu Tingxiao looked at the white tiger and he could not help but exclaim in admiration.

He had many friends abroad who reared wild beasts like brown bears, lions, tigers, and leopards, but ones that seemed to be able to communicate with humans were incredibly rare.

Very soon, the white tiger walked over to Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi. It was very quiet.

“Darling, don’t be afraid. Follow us home.” Ning Xi could not help but touch the white tiger with her hand.

The white tiger shook its shaggy body. It appeared very tame.

“Darling is superb!”

She would never have thought that the way she used with Little Treasure would work with the white tiger too. Of course, most importantly, it should be because Han Xiao’s odor had been rubbed on her, so it knew that she had no malicious intent and was Han Xiao’s good friend.

Ning Xi could not help but admire Han Xiao once again. How had he tamed a wild beast at the peak of the food chain like this?

“Let’s go.”

Lu Tingxiao dared not relax, he protected Ning Xi on the side and they walked towards their house.

On the way, Ning Xi could not help but turn around to look at the white tiger from time to time, if it was not for the tiger’s huge size, Ning Xi wished she could pull the tiger into her embrace.

“Darling, I want to raise a tiger too!” Ning Xi could not help but exclaim.

“Only if Han Xiao helps you tame it,” said Lu Tingxiao.

A normal cat or dog was fine, but it was best not to provoke animals such as lions and tigers who were at the peak of the food chain, even if they had been hand-reared since young. When the tiger grew up, if they were slightly careless, it could lead to tragedy.

“Hire him to help me tame it? I’m afraid I won’t be able to afford him.” Ning Xi shook her head. After Han Xiao helps her tame it, would it even still be hers?

However, it was really so adorable and cute!

As she watched the Bengal white tiger wag its long, snowy tail at her and its gentle gaze staring at her, Ning Xi felt like her heart was about to melt.

This was not some ferocious beast. This was a super cute mythical beast!

Forget rearing a cat or dog… If she wanted to rear something, it would be a tiger!

…

When they returned home, half an hour had passed.

Thankfully, the building was designed with a double door, or else, with the Bengal white tiger’s colossal body, it would not even be able to squeeze in.

Even then, it was not easy for the white tiger to enter the house either.

“Oh my God…”

Lu Jingli stared at the white tiger in the living room and felt his scalp go numb. Goosebumps erupted all over his body.

Once in a while, when the domineering gaze of the white tiger made eye contact with him, Lu Jingli’s body would shudder.

“My baby, my darling!”

Since Ning Xi returned, she had been sticking to the tiger. Her hands kept stroking it. Its soft fur was just so comforting!

It was the most wonderful feeling in history!

“Shake my hand!”

Ning Xi held up both hands against the tiger’s giant claws and touched its soft pads, relishing the super undefeatable enjoyment… ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

What was most astonishing was that this tiger’s sharp claws had unexpectedly retreated back into its pad when playing around with Ning Xi as if it was afraid of accidentally hurting Ning Xi.

“My little baby, I really love you to death!”

Ning Xi very soon familiarized herself with the tiger. She held the tiger’s head dearly and planted a kiss on its forehead.
