Chapter 1528: Bloodbath

A troop donning black suits surrounded the room. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Who the heck are you guys to ruin my fun?! Prepare to defend your lives!" The man, who seemed to be the leader, spoke. He looked drunk.

As he finished his sentence, a cold gun was pointed at his forehead. "Pledge your allegiance to us, or die."

"You… Who are you people? Do you know who I am? I'm the boss of the White Tiger Section from the Qing Xuan Gang. I…"

The sound of a gunshot rang out in the night. A bloody hole appeared on the man's forehead and he fell to the ground. The gun was equipped with a silencer, so the sound was muffled but it packed enough impact to render everyone in the room pale.

"Murder…"

"Boss!"

"Oh no! They killed Wang Hu!"

…

"Anyone has any objections?" The shooter in the black suit looked at everyone in the room coldly.

No one uttered a word.

Another person in a black suit crossed out "White Tiger Section" on a piece of white paper…

"Next."

…

At the same time, many similar incidents happened all over Imperial. That night, a thick fog covered Imperial.

In the study room of a luxurious house by the hillside.

A person barged in as he slumped to the ground. "Boss, it's bad… Things are bad!"

"Why are you freaking out? What's wrong?"

"Just now, an unknown party invaded our bases in Imperial… Within just an hour, they've taken control of 11 branches…"

"What did you say?" Meng Zhenhuan stood up in fury and disbelief. "Who are they? How dare they?!"

"They were too quick. We still don't have a lead yet! But I seem to have seen a monogram of the letter 'S' on their outfit…"

"What?" Meng Zhenhuan's expression changed. "Are you sure?"

"I'm very sure! Boss, could it be… Are they from Satan?" The henchman shivered a little.

To have the ability and guts to raid their bases this quickly, he could not think of anyone else besides that man.

"Impossible." Meng Zhenhuan rejected his subordinate's guess.

They had met each other when that man entered Imperial. Even then, he had questioned his intentions too.

He did not seem to be interested in the underground powers in Imperial. They even said that they need not be concerned and could just carry on as usual.

Then, why would they suddenly do something like this?

"Then, did we offend someone lately?" The henchman looked confused.

"Wait, I'll make a call…" Meng Zhenhuan muttered to himself, then he called a number from his phone.

However, no one picked up.

Meng Zhenhuan was getting uneasy. He made another call.

It got through this time.

"Hi, Master Ye. I'm sorry for bothering you this late at night. My man told me that many of our branches were invaded and that the invaders seem to be from your organization."

"It's Satan's orders." A cold voice came through the phone.

Meng Zhenhuan could not immediately react to what he just heard. His face drained of all blood. "What?! Why would Satan do this? Last time, he said…"

"About this, I suggest you find out about it on your own, Mr. Meng." The call was then hung up.
