Chapter 233: Instead Of Being Happy Alone, It’s Better To Be Happy Together

Ning Xi’s technique was perfect, her movements natural and fluid, as if she did this a lot…

In the end, she left one foot planted on the man’s back, and rested one arm on her knee. The seductive genie from earlier had completely turned into a gangster. "Give me your phone!"

The scumbag had been beaten until he couldn't tell up from down. He had no strength to fight back, and hearing her words, he hastily begged, "It’s in my pocket, my wallet too, and there’s a ring inside my wallet, everything is yours! Please spare my life, Wonder Woman!"

He wouldn't have thought in a million years that he would get robbed while out looking for a hookup! And the robber was a knockout! From her skills and her murderous aura, he could tell that she was a professional!

Ning Xi didn't care if this scumbag was misunderstanding the situation. She took his phone out straightaway, then waved it in front of him, "Put your hand out, unlock it for me!"

"Un… unlock it? What do you want to do?"The scumbag said warily.

Ning Xi slapped him hard with barely a pause. "I told you to unlock it, so much rubbish! You don’t believe I can disable that thing three inches under your belly button?"

"I’ll unlock it, unlock it! Right now!"The scumbag was scared sheetless, and he quickly unlocked it.

Ning Xi found his wife’s number in his contacts, and facetimed her.

She picked up quickly.

A woman’s face appeared on the screen. She could tell that the woman’s foundation was not bad, but maybe it was because she had stayed home too long doing housework and had neglected her skincare, she she looked sallow like wax. It was a typical housewife’s face, the kind that scumbags loathed.

"Who… who are you?" The woman’s expression changed instantly when she saw Ning Xi’s stunning beauty, but then she said in an extremely exhausted voice, "I don't care who you are, from now on he can love whoever he wants or be with whomever he wants; I’m ready to divorce him, and I don't want any money from him. Whatever he does after this has nothing to do with me anymore! So leave me alone!" 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Hearing this, Ning Xi shook her head in disappointment. "Tch, you’re going to let him off so easily? Sister, you’re too kind!"

That woman hadn’t expected Ning Xi’s unconventional attitude, and she couldn’t help but stare blankly, before she asked warily, "What… what do you mean?"

The corners of Ning Xi’s mouth ticked up, and she pointed the phone’s webcam at the scumbag she had beaten black and blue, lying under her foot. "See that?"

After getting a clear view of the man on her phone, the woman was completely dumbfounded. "You… the two of you… what is this?"

Ning Xi laughed lightly. "So? Does that feel good?"

That woman recovered her senses after a long while, and even though she didn’t understand what was going on, she looked at that man all banged up, and subconsciously said, "Yes!"

After saying that, her lips twisted with a trace of bitterness.

Not so long ago, if he had gotten even a small scratch, she would have been worried to death. But now, seeing him cut such a sorry figure, she was unexpectedly pleased…

"Heh, that’s great! I didn’t have any other reason to call you, just that instead of being happy alone, it’s better to be happy together, which is why I wanted to show this to you.Now everyone can be happy together!" Ning Xi said in a careless manner.

"…"The woman was still in a daze, and didn't know how to react to this bizarre situation.

As for the man under Ning Xi’s foot, that pig’s face was all twisted up. He hadn’t expected that this woman would insult him not only physically, but also mentally, and that she would show his wife, who had always admired him, this ugly state he was in…
