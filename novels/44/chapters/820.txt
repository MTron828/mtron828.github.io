Chapter 821: Strip Off Your Top And Do Some Pushups

After Lu Tingxiao entered, everyone became more reserved; it suddenly became quiet, like an office meeting.

Yet, the culprit Lu Tingxiao did not realize it at all. He just sat there on his own accord, while holding his girlfriend’s hand, admiring her angry face and relaxing…

"Hey, don’t let it stop, we should continue!" After the crisis was solved, Lu Jingli quickly continued the game. As long as his brother was here, nothing bad would happen to Xiao Xi Xi, so now he could go all out!

Following Lu Jingli’s lead, everyone relaxed.

As they continued, Su Yan came back and sat down beside Ning Xueluo, but he occasionally looked over at Ning Xi’s direction. The girl seemed to be afraid of Lu Tingxiao. She sat there quietly and cautiously, her cheeks red from the wine she drank just now, but it also seemed like she was shy from the kiss…

Seeing this image of Ning Xi broke Su Yan’s heart…

Ever since Ning Xi had returned, she had changed. He had forgotten when was the last time he saw Ning Xi show this obedient side of her.

Back then, when Ning Xi was still a little girl, she would blush every time she saw him, not even daring to look him in the eye when talking to him…

But five years later, he now saw the Ning Xi that he used to know, but her gaze was not for him; it was for another man…

Could she be…with Lu Tingxiao…

"Hahaha…Senior Jiang, it’s your turn again! Truth or dare?"

Jiang Muye was not in a good mood right now, so he just splurted out, "Dare!"

"I like your attitude, Senior Jiang! Alright, then! Please strip off your top and do ten sets of pushups on the Ace of Clubs!"

"Ohh…"

Everyone was excited.

"Pushups, hahaha…" A few people threw over some suggestive looks.

"Ohh, the Ace of Clubs! Who’s the Ace of Clubs? How lucky!"

"Could it be a guy? Hahaha!"

…

Ning Xi’s expression darkened.

Damn it, she had drawn the Ace of Clubs! What now?

Ning Xi stared at the devil.

Realizing the girl’s stare, he looked over and saw Ning Xi’s Ace of Clubs.

"Hmm? Who’s having the Ace of Clubs?" Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was urging, but just as Ning Xi was about to raise her hand, her card disappeared. In the next moment, her card changed into 8 of Diamonds.

Someone laughed. "No wonder the Ace of Clubs isn’t talking! It is you, Second Master!"

Lu Jingli stared at his brother with bitterness…

How could you!?

Well, he was the one who suggested to play this game anyway.

Lu Jingli looked at Jiang Muye with determination. "Come at me!"

Everyone laughed.

Jiang Muye sat just beside Lu Jingli. He had already seen that he was not holding the Ace of Clubs, but it was his card now. It was obvious that who had the card earlier…

Jiang Muye forfeited his dare and drank three glasses of alcohol.

The crowd was disappointed.

There was nothing to look forward to now!
