Chapter 104: Who Doesn’t Have Dirt On Themselves

Feng Haoyang pinched the skin between his eyebrows and finally gave up on communicating with her. Trying to compete with a fool was the most idiotic thing to do.

The company had spent a lot of effort on Jia Qingqing, but because of this matter, things were beyond recovery. However great the loss was, she could only be discarded.

Seeing that Feng Haoyang had made up his mind, Jia Qingqing rushed to Ning Xueluo, clutching at straws. "Sister Xueluo, help me! Let Sister Chang manage me! I guarantee I’ll definitely be obedient! I promise that I’ll post a letter of apology!"

When Chang Li heard this, she instantly became frightened. Get her to take over Jia Qingqing? Ning Xueluo wouldn’t trap her like that, right?

Of course, Ning Xueluo wasn’t as brainless as Jia Qingqing, so she put on a troubled expression and she lamented regretfully, "Qingqing, it’s not that I’m not helping you. You heard Ning Xi’s words just now, she’s not willing to help. Besides, this is the company's decision, I also have no choice."

After this issue had come out, she knew Jia Qingqing was finished, but she still wanted to use her to the very end to drag Ning Xi down with her. It was a pity that Feng Haoyang had realized early on that an apology would be completely useless, and might also drag another company artiste into trouble; in the end, he just directly gave up on Jia Qingqing.

She had thought Jia Qingqing would be a good knife to use in dealing with Ning Xi, who knew she was stupid enough to get pulled in herself, and even make Ning Xi’s popularity soar. There was no way she would continue wasting energy on this type of person.

"Ning Xi! You b*tch! B*tch! B*tch! Wait and see! Even if I die, I’ll drag you down to die with me!" Jia Qingqing finally lost hope, and took her anger out on Ning Xi, until Feng Haoyang called security and she was dragged away.

Towards this kind of person, Ning Xi didn’t even bother to hate her, and could only pity her; even until now, she still didn’t know that she had been used as cannon fodder.

Feng Haoyang looked at Ning Xi with a far more relaxed expression on his face. "Ning Xi, act well in this movie. If the outcome is good, the company will focus on cultivating you. But what Ning Xueluo said just now makes sense. You should keep your head down for now, and don't stir up unnecessary trouble."

The whole affair was simply the perfect public relations crisis management scenario, from Ning Xi being knee-deep in scandal to being washed completely clean, and instead Jia Qingqing being forced to leave the entertainment industry.

Although Feng Haoyang suspected that someone was working behind the scenes, he couldn’t find the slightest flaw, and could only attribute it to Ning Xi’s good luck.

"Thank you, Director Feng, I will." Ning Xi pretended to be surprised and nervous.

After coming out of the meeting room, Ning Xi went to the washroom, and Ning Xueluo followed her in.

Ning Xueluo crossed her arms over her chest and sneered at her. "Ning Xi, you’re so good at digging up dirt on other people, aren’t you afraid your own unsavoury past will be exposed one day?"

Ning Xi's eyes narrowed slightly and turned cold. She turned around, and said unconcernedly, "Who doesn’t have dirt on them, in this industry? You don’t? Eldest Miss Ning!"

Ning Xi deliberately emphasized this form of address, Eldest Miss Ning, then pretended to be suddenly enlightened. "Ah! I’ve just realized, Jia Qingqing’s title ‘fake daughter, real mistress’ unexpectedly is also very suitable for describing you! When the time comes for me to expose you, doesn’t it save me the trouble of finding a title for you?"

This hit Ning Xueluo’s sore spot, and she immediately got furious. "What false daughter real mistress! Since I was born, I’ve always been part of the Ning family. I’m the only daughter Father has recognized. As for Su Yan, you’re the one who was useless and couldn’t keep his heart. Do you think anyone would believe your nonsense?"

Ning Xi heaved a long sigh. "Then… shall we test it? Go ahead and expose that dark part of my past! There are so many people out there, so I haven’t been able to find the whereabouts of the two male hookers you bought off. Who knows, perhaps the general public might help me strike unexpected gold."
