Chapter 171: The Most Beautiful Princess~

This guess was instantly like a tossed stone stirring up a thousand ripples:

"How is that possible! Lu Tingxiao is single, alright? He has a son, but he definitely does not have a woman by his side!"

‘If it really was him, then that was really big news, tut tut tut…"

"No matter how big it is, so what? Would you dare report it? Did you forget how VIO Magazine crashed and burned back then?"

"Eh… of course I remember, it was because they secretly took a picture of Lu Tingxiao, and even dared to publish it…"

At this point, everyone gave up on this juicy piece of news, and hands that had been quick to take photos were now shaking as they started to delete all of them.

Lu Tingxiao was famous for being low-key in the circle, and he refused to do any media interview. The little prince was protected even more tightly. Although they were very curious about today’s circumstances as well as about that woman’s identity, no media outlet would dare touch that lethal headline.

In the elevator.

Ning Xi tilted her head in Lu Tingxiao’s arms. She looked at Big Bun, and then at Little Bun, with mixed feelings.

So this was how it felt to be protected by someone…

"Are you alright? I’ll get you moved to another hospital!" Lu Tingxiao’s face was still a little dark. He had come here in a hurry, and had also only just realized this unpleasant coincidence.

"No need for the trouble, I’m okay now, how about we go home? Actually, I really hate being in a hospital…"

"Alright."

"By the way, where did those two bodyguards come from?" Ning Xi asked suspiciously.

"They are always nearby. Given your particular situation, I had them guard you, just in case." Like when she had been attacked and hurt by fans — he wasn’t going to allow something like that to happen a second time.

"I haven't signed with Glory World yet, and already I can enjoy this type of privilege?" Ning Xi felt spoiled. As she finished speaking, she suddenly saw herself in the elevator’s mirror…

Ning Xi touched her own face in the mirror, "Mm, were those reporters blind? They didn't recognize me even when I was standing in front of them! And they even said… I look like a good wife and loving mother, so fresh, gentle and cute? Clearly the stepmother in Snow White, or the Big Bad Wolf in Little Red Riding Hood is a more suitable description of me!

She checked herself in the mirror as she spoke, then realized that she didn't have any makeup on at the moment, and was wearing a loose-fitting hospital gown. Her hair was pulled back into a messy braid for convenience sake, and she had on the pink hair clip that Little Treasure had given to her. The expression on her face did appear gentle and refined…

Damn it! She really had become a gentle girl!

Ning Xi was surprised by herself.

Had she been like this all along in front of Big Bun and Little Bun? This wasn’t like her at all!

At this time, after hearing what Ning Xi said, Little Bun suddenly took out a pocket-sized notebook, and bent his head to scribble in it for a bit, then urgently held it up in front of her.

"Darling, what are you trying to say?" Ning Xi took the notebook, and after reading it, she blushed.

"What is it?"By her side, Lu Tingxiao asked the question after seeing the strange expression on Ning Xi’s face.

Ning Xi covered her burning cheeks, her eyes full of accusation. "It’s all your fault, Lu Tingxiao! Look at what your son wrote!"

"What is it?"Lu Tingxiao had been unjustly blamed when he was innocent, so he took a look at what Little Treasure had written. After reading it, he was silent.

Carefully written in the notebook:

[You are the brightest star in the sky, your eyes are sweeter than chocolate, whenever I look at you, I see a fairytale princess who has eternal beauty.]
