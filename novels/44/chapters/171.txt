Chapter 172: The Pupil Surpasses His Master

After hearing Ning Xi’s self-deprecating words, Little Treasure had resolutely played his best hand…

Ning Xi was moved and worried at the same time. "Lu Tingxiao, Little Treasure definitely got this from you. He’s too good at making girls happy! What is he going to be like when he grows up! I don’t dare imagine how much more infatuated I’m going to be when he starts talking!"

Especially that last sentence, it had hit her straight in her heart. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He actually said she was a princess…

She had always wanted to be a queen, because only then would she be able to face all her hardships fearlessly.

But in front of Little Treasure calling her "princess", the little girl which she had been hiding deep inside her was drawn out…

There wasn’t a girl who didn’t want to be a carefree princess; she just hadn’t been in a position to choose that option.

Lu Tingxiao looked at his own son and felt rueful in his heart. This wasn’t a case of genetics anymore, but of the pupil surpassing his master.

Seeing Little Treasure standing there looking at her with an earnest face, Ning Xi gave a soft, helpless laugh, and then bent over to hug him. "Okay, okay! I understand! I know I’m the most beautiful in your eyes! I won’t undervalue myself anymore, okay?"

Only then was Little Treasure satisfied, and copying what she always did as a reward for him, he kissed her gently on the cheek.

Ning Xi couldn’t help squeezing Little Bun in a hug again. "Ai, what am I going to do, I so badly want to steal you away when your dad’s not paying attention!"

Little Treasure blinked and looked very expectant. He nodded approvingly, as if to say, "Hurry up and steal me away!"

Ning Xi: "Pu…"

Lu Tingxiao: "…" Why did he feel like he was the third wheel?

At the same time, in Ning Xueluo’s ward.

The reporters could only return to continue interviewing Ning Xueluo when chasing Ning Xi hadn’t resulted in anything.

Everyone was now searching high and low for Ning Xi, but she seemed to have vanished off the surface of the earth, without a single trace. The reporters camped out at her apartment, on set, at the company, but all for nothing.

If they knew Ning Xi had actually been on the same floor as Ning Xueluo in the same hospital, and that they had even encountered her briefly, they might go crazy.

Su Yan was worried about Xueluo’s health, and interrupted the reporters after a few more questions. "I’m sorry, everyone, Xueluo is still recovering from her injury, and her body is weak, this is the end of today’s interview!"

"Yes, I’m not feeling so well, sorry everyone!"

While the reporters were unwilling to go, they could only express understanding and hope for a good recovery, before leaving in unison.

Chang Li walked them out politely. "Thank you for all your concern towards our Xueluo, I believe that justice is naturally ingrained in a person’s heart, and all of you are able to judge fairly. It must have been inconvenient for everyone to come here in such hot weather, this is a small token of gratitude for you!"

After saying that, the assistant Cui Caijing started to distribute red packets.

The reporters were well aware of the situation, and one after another expressed that they would definitely help Ning Xueluo find justice.

In bed, Ning Xueluo had a suspicious look on her face as she thought of something. "Brother Yan, what happened with those reporters earlier? Why did all of them suddenly run out? Was it really Ning Xi?"

"No, they mistook someone else for her." Su Yan tucked her in. There was a slightly absent-minded look on his face.

Those reporters hadn’t seen Ning Xi in person before, but he was different. When he caught a quick glimpse of that figure, it really had looked like Ning Xi, and he was almost sure that it was Ning Xi herself.

But how could that be possible? Why would Ning Xi be so intimate with a man, and furthermore even have a kid with them?
