Chapter 750: Boss, You’re So Sharp!

Looking at the horrible score, Ning Xi was stunned. "My outfit must’ve affected my performance today!"

Mo Lingtian laughed, then comforted her, "That’s pretty good, at least you hit the target!"

Lu Tingxiao patted her head and tried his hand at shooting as well, scoring 6.2 points. Just slightly lower than Ning Xi's. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Lingtian patted Lu Tingxiao’s shoulder and sighed, "Brother! I’m impressed! This is probably the toughest score you’ve hit in your lifetime!"

Lu Tingxiao got a 6.2…which was even more surprising than a 10 pointer…

Ning Xi ignored Mo Lingtian’s teasing as she happily went up to Lu Tingxiao to gush, "Boss, you’re so sharp!"

As Lu Tingxiao was about to say something, his phone rang. It was a call from home.

Any sign of expression was wiped off his face as he turned to Ning Xi. "You can play on your own first, I’ll go and pick up a call."

He then signaled to Mo Lingtian, asking him to take care of Ning Xi.

Mo Lingtian gave him a shooing gesture. "Just go and pick up your phone call quickly! Go!"

The moment Lu Tingxiao left, the people who were wary of him suddenly spoke in much louder voices.

"That’s hilarious! Even the girl who didn’t know anything within our group got a 7 and Lu Tingxiao's girl dares to claim that she’s good at it?" Lu Xinyan said scornfully.

Another girl shrugged. "Maybe it’s already good enough for her! At least she hit the target! I’m quite surprised that she didn’t miss!"

Why would Lu Tingxiao be with such a useless woman? I’m really curious! Someone go and ask him!"

"I’m not going to! I’m just being polite because of Lu Tingxiao but I refuse to be friendly with her!"

…

Ning Xi calmly wiped her gun while listening to their discussion. These people were from the wealthy circle of Imperial. They were either the heirs of a wealthy organization or the prince or princesses of some high-ranking government officials. They were just being fairly nice to Ning Xi because of Lu Tingxiao.

At that moment, someone told Guan Ziyao, "Ziyao, you and Mo Lingtian are closer to Bro Xiao. Why don't you try to talk to him and tell him not to be fooled by a woman like her!"

"He will eventually find out himself," Guan Ziyao replied.

"That’d be too late. The moment he finds out, he would’ve been deceived!"

As Lu Xinyan listened to them, her face turned bright red. She felt embarrassed and could not accept the fact that her perfect cousin was being fooled by this woman…

Boiling with anger, Lu Xinyan could not hold it in anymore. She walked up to Ning Xi and demanded, "I don’t care what did you do to be with my cousin! Tell me what it takes in order for you to leave him!"

Mo Lingtian quickly stood in between them and tried to defuse the situation. "Hey, what are you doing? We’re here to have some fun! Stop making a fuss!"

"I’m not making a fuss! Seriously, how is this woman worthy of my cousin?"

As Mo Lingtian was trying to convince Lu Xinyan to calm down, Ning Xi curled her fingers around the gun in her hand and blinked innocently. "Leaving your cousin? It’s easy! You just have to defeat me!"
