Chapter 336: Tender Or Cherishing

Guo Qisheng looked at Fang Ya impatiently, "Xiaoqi doesn’t come from an acting school. It's already very commendable that she could perform this way!"

He saw that Fang Ya was unsatisfied and continued, "Later on, please put in more effort into your scene with Xiaoqi. She can only follow if you're focused, understand?"

"Director, it’s her…" Fang Ya was exasperated. Was now her fault that Guan Xiaoqi had bad acting skills?

Suddenly, everyone around started to change their attitude. "The director makes sense, at first I thought it was all Guan Xiaoqi’s fault, but think about it, Fang Ya had some problems as well!"

"Sure is! Otherwise, how would Guan Xiaoqi be able to do a one shot take with Ning Xi!"

"Guan Xiaoqi has bad acting skills, but Fang Ya isn’t that great either, it’s like the pot calling the kettle black!"

…

After the scene was over, Guan Xiaoqi skipped happily back to the resting area.

One assistant helped fanned her and the other gave her water, gladly welcoming her.

"Miss, you were great just now!" 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Yeah, you got it at the first shot! Marvelous acting!"

Guan Xiaoqi said proudly, "I told you that my acting has no problem! It’s just that I couldn’t act well when I see Fang Ya’s face, it makes me sick! Don't you trust me now?"

"Yes, I do! Miss, you’re the best! It’s all Fang Ya’s fault!"

…

Ning Xi glanced at Guan Xiaoqi’s direction, then walked over to Guo Qisheng’s side, "Director, how was the scene? Were there any problems?"

"No problem! It was great!" Guo Qisheng said with a face full of life.

Ning Xi acted casually and said, "Director, I think Guan Xiaoqi is in shape right now. Wouldn’t it be better to start shooting the next scene right now?"

"Mmm, you have a point, I’ll let them prepare the next scene immediately! Oh right, you should attend to your urgent matter now!"

"Alright, thank you, director!" Ning Xi nodded before she left.

Xiao Tao followed Ning Xi with a doubtful look, "Sis Xi, what’s up with Guan Xiaoqi? She passed on first take! Must be her luck?"

"Maybe…"

"I knew it! Sis Xi you have something urgent? Do you need my help?"

"No, you can get off work now!"

"Alright, thank you, Sis Xi!" She thought she would have to work overtime tonight, but in the end she could get off earlier, so Xiao Tao left happily.

…

Ning Xi finished removing her make up and changed her outfit, then walked along the corridor towards the hotel.

Suddenly an arm reached over and hooked onto her shoulder, "Tsk tsk, Ning Xiao Xi, how nice of you, playing the hero now?"

Ning Xi pushed Jiang Muye’s arm away and brushed off the non-existent dust on her shoulder. "Why, do you have a problem with it?"

Jiang Muye just put his arm over her again, "Aren’t you the type to not meddle in other people’s business? Why are you helping the nasty Guan Xiaoqi this time?"

Ning Xi touched her chin, "Guan Xiaoqi kind of helped me before, so I'm just returning the favor. I don’t like to owe people. Moreover, not taking into account of her behavior and personality, I can see that she really loves acting…"

She felt positive about people who truly loved and were passionate about acting.

Jiang Muye was speechless, "You’re so tender and cherishing towards her!"

"You don’t need to care if I’m tender or cherishing!" Ning Xi rolled her eyes at him, "I thought there weren’t any scenes of you today? Why are you here?"
