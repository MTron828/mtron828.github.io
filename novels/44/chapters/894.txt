Chapter 895: They're…Boobs!

What?!

Just as Qi Fang was about to shake hands with who he thought was Ke Mingyu, he froze when he heard the director’s introduction. He asked carefully, "Director, what did you say just now?"

Ji Yumeng said suspiciously, "Director, are you sure you’re not mistaken? Isn’t he Ke Mingyu?"

Chen Mian laughed at the three of them. "Who told you that?"

Chen Hanchen reevaluated the "man" in front of him again and gasped, "He…she’s Ning Xi?"

"The female lead?" Qi Fang asked again.

"Director, are you sure? Don’t try to fool us!"

Chen Mian smiled and shook his head. "Ning Xi, explain to them!"

Ning Xi looked helplessly at the director. "How do I explain? I just spent two hours to finish my preparation for this!"

It was not funny to ask her to change into a female outfit just for them right now.

Chen Mian had no words…

"How could he be the female lead…and he doesn’t look like Ning Xi…Fine, maybe some key features do resemble her but something’s wrong! Director, did you just find a guy to act as the female lead?" Ji Yumeng asked.

Qi Fang and Chen Hanchen suddenly considered this possibility as well.

Chen Mian was annoyed. Were kids nowadays all so imaginative?

Ning Xi held her forehead and put up a helpless smile, then she reached for Ji Yumeng’s hand. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ji Yumeng’s heart raced. "You…what are you…?"

Qi Fang’s eyes widened unhappily. How dare this guy just hold a girl’s hand just like that!? Do something, Director!

The next moment, Ning Xi put Ji Yumeng’s hand onto her chest, then asked, "Is it okay now?"

"They’re…boobs!" Ji Yumeng cried out as she was touching Ning Xi’s chest. "She’s really a woman! You’re really the female lead!"

Although there was a thick layer of cloth wrapped around Ning Xi's chest, she could still felt the unmistakable soft curve under her fingers…

Both of them were women, so they must have had the experience of touching or being touched by another girl before, so why was this so awkward!?

Qi Fang’s eyes flew open even bigger and his face was all red. Chen Hanchen did not look very comfortable either.

Mmm, there could only be one top dog, unless there were a male and a female…

Director Chen was still being rational…

Chen Mian knocked Ning Xi’s head. "That’s enough, stop fooling around!"

Ning Xi blinked. How was she fooling around? This was the quickest way to prove herself!

"Sorry, I’m late!" Suddenly, there was a panting voice behind them.

The real Ke Mingyu had arrived. As expected, Ke Mingyu looked more run-of-the-mill and seemed to be the gentle, far from the aggressive type, unlike Ning Xi. The way she behaved herself could steal all the girls' hearts away…

After confirming that she was a woman, Chen Hanchen looked at Ji Yumeng, who was too excited that she almost passed out. There was also the director’s assistant who kept peeking over. Although he still did not feel very comfortable, he felt much better than just now.

She was still a woman, so no matter how good she was at acting as a man, she was still acting. She could never overtake him in being a man, so his confidence was not eroded that badly…
