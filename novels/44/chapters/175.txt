Seeing that Ning Xi had shown up, Chang Li’s expression was predictably smug. "Our big star Ning is finally willing to make an appearance! You really made me wait!"

As she spoke, she gave the cold-looking man next to Ning Xi a funny look. "Who is this man? Don't you know that you can’t simply bring strangers into the company?"

Ning Xi looked askance at her: "My lawyer."

"Heh, you even have a lawyer!" Chang Li thought she had simply hired one for appearance sake, and she snorted disdainfully. "Even now you’re still putting on airs and defying me. Do you know how badly you’ve blundered this time? If I hadn’t interceded with the company for you over and over again, you would have been blacklisted a long time ago!"

Ning Xi raised an eyebrow slightly and chuckled. "Heh, you, intercede for me? Then please, what was the result of your intercession?"

Chang Li threw a document at her. "The company will hold a press conference. As long as you give a public apology at the news conference, and leave the <The World> production of your own accord, Lady Xueluo will be the bigger person and won’t prosecute you, and will give you an opportunity to turn over a new leaf. But for a morally bankrupt artiste like you, even if I do everything to protect you, I’m afraid no production team will ever dare use you again."

After condemning her, Chang Li then offered a way out, as she spoke with a meaningful expression, "But don't lose heart. If you repent sincerely, the company won't cast you aside. You know that there are some directors who don't care about scandal, and about this, I've already accepted another film role for you. As long as you behave well, you will still have a chance to stage a comeback!"

Ning Xi looked at her with a disingenuous smile, and said indistinctly, "A big-budget production… which big-budget production has Sister Chang accepted for me?"

Seeing that Ning Xi had taken the bait, Chang Li gave her a disdainful look as she said, "Are you still afraid that I’ll trick you? Have you heard of <Laughing In The Spring Breeze>?"

Ning Xi tapped her fingers fitfully on the arms of her chair. "Jiang Penghai's new film?"

"That’s it, it’s Director Jiang! You also know, Director Jiang’s films might not sell well, but he was already making films in Hong Kong when Guo Qisheng was still unknown!"

Listening to Chang Li praise Jiang Penghai so earnestly, Ning Xi almost laughed aloud, and her eyes flashed coldly. "Sister Chang, if you want me to sell myself, just say so! You don't have to beat around the bush!"

This Jiang Penghai started his career by filming X-rated videos, and could never completely clean up his image. The thing people reviled Jiang Penghai for the most was his behavior.

The man was especially lecherous, and had slept with almost all the actresses he had worked with. Last year, he had nearly been taken to court for having sex with a minor.

She really had to hand it to them, they had taken such great pains to dig up such a movie for her to do, and with such a director.

Hearing her words, Chang Li frowned. "What telling you to sell yourself! Isn’t the rating only just a little high? What, you aren’t willing? For trash like you, if it wasn’t for my strong recommendation, he might not even have wanted you at all! Think about how much you’ve caused the company to lose this time. Are you thinking of leeching off the company, if you can’t get any roles?"

"Sorry, I won't be taking it." Ning Xi didn’t feel like continuing listening to Chang Li as she reached new lows, and straightaway refused.

Chang Li lost her temper on the spot, and she slapped her palm down hard onto the table. "Ning Xi, again and again, you never listen to my arrangements for you. Do you see me as your manager or not? I’m telling you, even if you don’t want to, you have to take the role in Director Jiang's movie!"

"Manager?" Ning Xi smiled coldly. "Soon enough, you won't be any longer."

"Heh, you still want to change managers? It also depends on whether there’s anyone in Starlight who would dare take you!" Chang Li had nothing to be afraid of.

"What I want to change, is the company."
