Chapter 556: Worried About The Wife Being Alone

If Ning Xi became the legitimate heir, then…

Ning Xueluo could not accept the thought of how she would live a life of poverty back in the poor village! Even if the Ning family kept her, she could not bear the thought of being under Ning Xi!

She was the Ning family’s daughter and she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. There was no way she would allow this witch to take away all of that from her!

That’s right, she was the one and only daughter of the Ning family! Even bloodline could not change that!

Ning Xueluo took a deep breath to calm herself down, then she went up to Ning Xi and held her arms, saying in a trembling voice, "Sister, please don’t leave, alright? Please don’t be angry with Father and Mother! They have been preparing to announce your identity a long time ago, but you didn’t want to come back and join the company…

"You can put all the blame on me, it’s all my fault, do whatever you want to me. If you really don’t want to see me here, I’ll leave now! But please, sister, don’t go!

"Even if you don’t want to see us, think about Grandfather! Grandfather really missed you! At least take a bite of Grandfather’s birthday cake! What could possibly make you miss Grandfather’s birthday?"

Ning Xueluo’s words were phrased cleverly, indirectly blaming matters on Ning Xi, at the same time expressing her awkward position in the Ning family, and most importantly, showing how filial she was towards Grandfather…

Zhuang Lingyu felt sorry for her. "Xueluo, what are you talking about? Where are you going? You shouldn’t be the one leaving!"

The elder looked much kinder now, seeing Ning Xueluo ask Ning Xi to stay as well. Of course, he would not chase Ning Xueluo away, so he went along with her. "Xiao Xi, it's such a rare occasion that you’re back. Stay for a while more, alright?"

Ning Xi looked at the elder’s eyes silently, and in the end, she nodded. "Okay."

It was already clear that she would disappoint him by never fulfilling his wish of giving birth to a great-grandchild for him.

It would be impossible for her to go back to the Ning family or to join the company, so she was not cruel enough to decline his simple request uppfront.

"That’s great! Come inside! It’s cold outside!" The elder delightedly went back into the house with the help of Ning Tianxin and Ning Xi.

Ning Xueluo was left behind. She gave them a cold stare when she saw Ning Tianxin and Ning Xi helped Ning Zhiyuan back inside.

Seeing that the elder was settled, Zhuang Lingyu let out a sigh of relief. She walked up to Ning Xueluo kindly and held her hands apologetically. "Xueluo, it must be hard for you!" Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

No matter what happened at home, she was always mature and cared about everyone’s feelings.

Ning Yaohua felt heartbroken for her as well. He sighed, "Xueluo, don’t take it personally, your grandfather just missed Xiao Xi too much and was excited. He did not mean what he said, I’m still in charge of the company right now, don't worry!"

"Thank you, Father, Mother…I understand!"

…

After Grandfather had calmed down, Ning Xi sent Lu Tingxiao a message: [I need to stay here with my grandfather for a little while more. Will be late. Take Little Treasure back home first, I’ll pick him up from Platinum Palace later.]

Lu Tingxiao’s face fell when he read her message in his office.

Lu Tingxiao understood that no matter how strong Ning Xi looked, she still had her soft spot, which was the Ning family.

He knew a thing or two about what had happened to her in the Ning family…

Although Ning Xi sounded casual in the text message, how could he be not worried about leaving her alone at that place?
