Chapter 232: You’ll Turn Green If You Don’t Do Anything

Out of the corner of her eye, Ning Xi looked at the man’s ring finger on his left hand.

Even though he wasn’t wearing a wedding ring, the skin color around that area was obviously lighter. Obviously he took it off when he was picking up girls.

"I am!" Ning Xi answered lazily, one hand supporting her head.

The man’s face lit up. "May I join you?"

"Sure." Ning Xi smiled lightly, an obvious suggestion lurking in her eyes.

That man was almost unable to conceal his pleased look, and he opened with an outdated pickup line, "Bad mood?"

Ning Xi sighed, "Yup, bad breakup!"

"Who would break up with a beauty like you? Which kind of man doesn’t know how to cherish what he has?" The elite had an astonished expression on his face.

"I dumped him."

"Cough cough… then he must have pissed you off!"

"That’s right! I just came to pick up guys to fool around with now and then, and when he found out, he made such a big deal out of it, isn’t that so ridiculous?" 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

"Eh…"The elite finally couldn't say a word.

Why did he find these lines so familiar?

It was like how he had been complaining to his comrades just now about how his wife nagged him the whole day…

But he was so taken by this woman's every gesture, as if he had been bewitched, that he completely didn't realized that he was being played with.

After a few drinks, the two of them walked out of the bar together.

"Where to? Royal Riveria or Pearl?" The elite couldn't wait any longer.

"What hotels! Here’s good!" Ning Xi dragged the man into a small side alley.

The elite panted with excitement, and pressed her into the wall, "Mm, you’re right… here’s more exciting…"

While the two of them were talking, they didn't notice at all that five steps away from them, a black car without car plates was parked there like a ghost.

In the car, no matter how calm a person Lu Tingxiao was, this time his entire being was already covered in a thick layer of frost.

In the front passenger seat, Lu Jingli was regretting his decision so much that his intestines had turned green with repentance.

He had had a strong feeling that something big was going to happen tonight, so he hadn’t gone to bed at all. In the end, he happened to see out his window Ning Xi and his brother leaving the house at different times, so he had shamelessly followed them. But he had never expected in a million years…

Something this big would happen!

He couldn't stand his brother’s horrifying face anymore, so horrifying that it could stop an infant from crying at night.

In the alley, that man’s hand was already on Ning Xi’s waist. Even if Lu Tingxiao was a god that had descended to their level, his endurance should be breaking by now.

Lu Jingli could tell that Lu Tingxiao’s patience was hanging by a single strand of hair. "Brother, what are you still waiting for?"

Lu Tingxiao said in a voice cold as iron: "Wait a little longer."

Lu Jingli was panicking. "It’s already at this point! What are you waiting for? You’ll turn green if you don't do anything! Xiao Xi Xi restrained herself these last two years, but she has a history of being wild. Learning to be good is not easy, but it’s too easy to become bad again…"

Lu Tingxiao: "Shut up!"

Just as Lu Jingli closed his eyes and didn't dare to watch, suddenly there was a terrible scream opposite them…

"Huh? That sound’s not right…" Lu Jingli opened his eyes immediately, and saw that man covering his manhood as he screamed like a pig being slaughtered.

Ning Xi immediately gave him another harsh kick, and the man fell to the ground. Just as he got up, Ning Xi stepped on his back, and his jaw hit the ground hard, blood flowing out of his mouth…

Lu Jingli felt pain just looking at the scene, and he covered his eyes when he couldn’t bear to watch it anymore. "Sister-in-law is too brutal, ow ow ow…"

…

‘To turn green’ is to make yourself sick.
