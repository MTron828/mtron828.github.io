Chapter 225: Failing At Provocation

Her eyes made Su Yan’s heart feel as if it was being nibbled on by lice, and he hurriedly drew Ning Xueluo away from Ning Xi. "Xueluo, calm down a little."

Ning Xueluo did not notice Ning Xi’s little action, her tears falling down. "Brother Yan, help me talk to sister. You know best how much I’ve hurt and blame myself these last few days. I really hope she can forgive me! Otherwise I really…"

Looking at the woman crying brokenheartedly in his arms, Su Yan finally relented. "Xiao Xi, I'm sorry, Xueluo blames herself very much for this."

When Ning Xueluo heard this, her mouth twitched with the hint of a smug smile. While she wept sadly on the outside, inside she was secretly expecting Ning Xi to explode.

Every time she had asked for forgiveness before, Ning Xi would definitely become very agitated, and she would say every nasty thing possible, which made Su Yan dislike her even more.

It would definitely be the same this time…

Ning Xi tiredly pinched the skin between her eyebrows, and then sighed. "Forget it, Ning Xueluo, I saw your apology and I also received it. Since it was a misunderstanding, then forget it. I forgive you."

"What… what did you say?" Ning Xueluo’s face changed instantly, full of disbelief.

On the other hand, Su Yan was very delighted. "Xueluo, are you relieved now?"

Ning Xueluo couldn’t say a single word, her face turning the color of liver.

On the other side, the door of the dressing room opened, and Little Treasure stepped out in the clothes he had tried on.

A hint of warmth instantly flickered over Ning Xi’s fake mask. She walked over to pick Little Treasure up with a smile, and then said to the salesgirl, "I want all the clothes that he just tried on, and he’ll directly wear this one out."

"Understood, I’ll ring them up for you right away!" the salesgirl answered with a dimpled smile. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ning Xi nodded to Su Yan to indicate she was leaving, then with Little Treasure in her arms, walked directly out of the store.

Behind them, a bodyguard in black settled the bill, picked up all the shopping bags, and followed after them.

Ning Xueluo was struck dumb at this scene. Then an extremely excited expression appeared on her face. "Is what Fanglin and Xuanxuan said true? Last time they told me they saw Ning Xi buying children’s clothes at the mall, but I didn't believe it! Sister she… don’t tell me she really has become the mistress of an old rich man, and even gave him a son…"

It was a pity that Ning Xi had left so quickly; she hadn’t been able to see the child’s face clearly, and also wasn’t in time to secretly take photos as evidence…

"Xueluo! Stop talking nonsense!" When Su Yan heard this, he immediately interrupted her with a solemn face, looking in the direction of Ning Xi’s departure. "I saw this child once. Xiao Xi already said, he’s just the son of a friend!"

Ning Xueluo said hurriedly, "Brother Yan, you are too na?ve. Can she be so good to him if he is just the son of a friend? Look, she has a bodyguard following her, and she paid with a black card. This sort of family would have plenty of nannies and bodyguards, why would she need to help take care of the kid?"

A hint of struggle and hesitation appeared on Su Yan’s face. But then he seemed to think of something, and in the end he still said in a determined voice: "Xueluo, in my heart, Ning Xi is my little sister. If you insult her, you insult me. Don't let me hear such words again! Other people can doubt her, but we can't, understand?"

Ning Xueluo had completely not expected Su Yan's attitude towards Ning Xi to change so drastically after what happened this time.

Damn it! What kind of spell had Ning Xi cast on him in the hospital that day? Su Yan suddenly had so much faith in her, even turning a deaf ear to Ning Xueluo’s words…
