Chapter 254: What’s My Score Now?

As if that wasn’t enough, Lu Tingxiao gave her yet another cold-blooded stab: "What’s my score now?"

"How can I tell you that! You think I’m dumb? I’m hanging up! My assistant’s waiting for me!" Ning Xi hung up quickly.

She was pathetic! As expected, she shouldn't have any contact with Lu Tingxiao for now!

On his end, when Lu Tingxiao finished speaking to Ning Xi on the phone, the smile on his face still hadn’t faded. Suddenly on the side, a big face popped into view, complaining bitterly —

"Brother~ tell me~~ are you hiding something from me?" Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lu Tingxiao didn't deny it, and lifted an eyebrow, "That obvious?"

Lu Jingli was struck a blow, and he almost lay down to roll around on the floor. "Argh, you really are keeping something from me! I’m your brother, your best right-hand man, your warm jacket! How can you hide things from me!"

"Aren’t you very good at guessing?"

"Huh! Fine, I’ll guess, then!" Lu Jingli paced back and forth in the room. After three minutes, he stopped abruptly, and looked in Lu Tingxiao’s direction. "The day before yesterday, you deliberately sent Little Treasure away. At that time, that was two days before Ning Xi would start work, and she would be busy getting ready for it, which meant that you didn't have much time either, so these two days, you would definitely do something big! Something big… don’t tell me it was a confession?"

Lu Tingxiao: "Go on."

Did that mean he had guessed right?

Lu Jingli’s eyes lit up, and he continued guessing: "The result? Most likely you failed! Otherwise how could you still be at the company, you would definitely be in bed…"

Lu Tingxiao: "…"

In the end, Lu Jingli made a finger gun at him, and concluded confidently, "There can only be one truth! You confessed, Xiao Xi Xi didn't accept it, but she didn't reject you either, and she’s thinking about it. Furthermore, the possibility at the moment that she will give you a positive reply is very high! That’s why you’re in such a good mood!"

Lu Tingxiao looked at his little brother’s glowing face, and the corners of his mouth twitched with imperceptible gentleness…

He had an aloof personality and was bad at getting along with people; even his emotional connection to his own biological parents was very thin. The only exception was this little brother. When other people avoided him and were afraid of him, only his little brother would follow him around the whole time; he never cared or got angry that Lu Tingxiao, who always had a cold face on; he went right on making his own guesses since Lu Tingxiao didn't like talking, and when it came to Lu Tingxiao, he always guessed right…

Lu Tingxiao already felt that he was blessed, and had never expected that destiny would also allow him to encounter Ning Xi…

Next day.

From mid-summer to early autumn, after experiencing so many ups and downs, the production crew of <The World> was finally about to start shooting again.

Because of changes to the script, Ning Xueluo and Zhao Sizhou had much fewer scenes, and the three remaining fight scenes which Ning Xueluo and Ning Xi had yet to shoot had also been taken out, meaning that from now on, Ning Xi would no longer encounter Ning Xueluo on set. That was a huge weight off Ning Xi’s shoulders, and she could finally focus on her acting.

Today they would mainly be filming two climatic scenes with Ning Xi and Jiang Muye. It wasn’t just Ning Xi’s manager Lin Zhizhi who had come, Jiang Muye’s manager Lei Ming had also made an appearance, which was telling of how important these two scenes were.

Ning Xi and Jiang Muye arrived at almost the same time.

"Hello, Senior Brother Jiang~" Ning Xi greeted him sweetly, obediently changing her address of him from "Senior Jiang" to "Senior Brother Jiang."

"Mm, hello, Junior Sister!" Seeing Ning Xi act like a good little girl gave Jiang Muye goose bumps, and he shuddered.

After that, his gaze swept carelessly over the person standing next to Ning Xi, Lin Zhizhi…
