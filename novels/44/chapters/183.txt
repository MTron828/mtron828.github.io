Chapter 184: A Special Date

On the road, Ning Xi rolled down the car window. The morning breeze was cool, and it felt nice on her face. It also blew away the depressed mood she had been in for days.

Lu Tingxiao turned on the radio, and instantly, light music floated out of the car.

Confession balloon / blown across the street by the wind / I saw a smile in the sky Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

You said you were difficult to chase after / you wanted me to give up

You don't need the dearest gift / but you want leaves from the Elysee

Oh / I will take you on a romantic date / not afraid to screw everything up

Owning you is owning / the whole world

My love / I love you / since I met you / everything is sweet

My love / Don’t refuse / your eyes

Are saying you agree.

…

The melody of this song was very sweet; it was as bright and crisp as a summer day, but listening to it, Ning Xi felt something was strange.

They were just going out to buy groceries, why was it turning out to feel like a date?

And the lyrics… for some reason, listening to them made her feel strangely bashful.

After half an hour of this strange atmosphere, they arrived at the market.

"Do we need to buy you a mask?" Lu Tingxiao asked her with some worry. In order not to be disturbed, this time he did not have bodyguards follow them.

"No need. The people who come here don't have so much time to care about gossip. Besides, today I’m dressed like such a lady, definitely no one will recognize me. Compared with me, I think you and Little Treasure need the masks more!" Ning Xi teased.

Although it was still very early, there was already a lot of people at the market. It was bustling with activity, as crowds of people came and went.

Worried that Little Treasure wouldn’t be used to it, Ning Xi bent down to pick him up.

It was Little Treasure’s first time in a place like this, and there was so much to see around him. His little head shifted from her left shoulder to her right shoulder as he looked around very intently.

However, Little Bun had recently put on a little more weight, and was really getting a little heavy. After a while, Ning Xi was starting to feel the strain.

Next to her, Lu Tingxiao took Little Treasure away from her just in time. "I’ll hold him."

Little Bun was already in Lu Tingxiao’s arms, but his hands still clung tightly to Ning Xi’s neck.

Lu Tingxiao looked solemn. "Do you know you're very heavy?"

Hearing this, Little Bun immediately looked like he had been dealt a huge blow, like a girl who had been told that she was fat.

Ning Xi found it very funny, but still hurriedly comforted him. "Don't listen to your father’s rubbish. You are not heavy at all, and you can still be a bit fatter. But your dad can hold you a little more steadily. He's also taller, so you will have a better view if he carries you!"

Little Treasure reluctantly agreed, but he wasn’t in the mood to look at the scenery. Instead, he stared fixedly at Ning Xi the whole way, for fear that she would be pushed out of his sight by the crowd. As soon as she was a little further away, he would stretch out his hands towards her.

"Wow, the fish over there looks really fresh!" Like a loach, Ning Xi bored her way through the crowd to reach the front of one stall.

Lu Tingxiao gave the girl a look, and then freed up one of his hands to hold hers.

"…" Ning Xi was startled, and instinctively looked at their joined hands, her palm burning a little.

"Little Treasure is very worried that you’ll get lost," Lu Tingxiao said with a resigned expression.

Ning Xi gave Little Treasure a look, and only then realized how anxious his expression was.

"Hey, madam, do you still want this fish?" the fishmonger auntie asked.

Ning Xi hurriedly said: "Yes, yes, yes! I’ve looked around, Elder Auntie, your fish is really fresh!"

"Madam, you have a good eye. You can ask anyone, everyone knows that our fish is the best in the whole market!" The elder auntie was very proud.

Only after quite a long while did Ning Xi realize that something was wrong — this elder auntie called her "madam"?

It was obvious that she had mistaken them for a family of three…
