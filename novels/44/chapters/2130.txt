Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The current head of the Lu family was no ordinary man. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Everything about the Rothschild family was kept confidential. No one had ever seen any child of the European King before.

Yet the person before him now had been able to find out his true identity…

“Haha, you’re really well-informed, Mr. Lu.” The man smiled.

He was not the European King, but the third son of the European King.

“Your point?” Lu Tingxiao was straightforward with him.

The man said politely, “Mr. Lu, Mr. Yun, I invited the both of you today for some business matters.”

“What is it?” Yun Shen asked indifferently.

The man did not seem to mind Yun Shen’s attitude. He wiped his hands with a napkin. “I hope that I can… acquire the Lu Corporation and the Yi Lan Innovative Investment Group.”

An European lady then placed two thick documents on the table right before Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen.

“This is the initial contract. Mr. Yun and Mr. Lu, you may take a look at it first. We can modify it if there’s anything you’re doubtful of or not satisfied with.”

Yun Shen glanced at the two contracts. He snorted, “Ha, acquire our companies? That’s really bold of you! Aren’t you afraid of taking in too much?”

Lu Tingxiao did not say anything. He quickly browsed through the contract, then he put it down and said, “I’m sorry, I’m afraid I can’t agree to your proposal.”

The man was not surprised by Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen’s refusal. “Mr. Lu, is it because the remuneration isn’t good enough? It’s alright. This is just an initial contract. We can continue discussing it. Mr. Lu, you can feel free to tell me what you want.”

Lu Tingxiao looked at the man in his eyes.

Lu Jingli walked up from behind Lu Tingxiao, taking two contracts out as well. He smiled wryly. “Why don’t you take a look at the contracts we have, Mr. Rothschild?”

The man glanced at the contract’s contents, his expression darkening.

Were these two nobodies trying to acquire his company? What an insult!

“Mr. Lu, Mr. Yun, I came all the way to Asia only to acquire your companies. Your attitudes are making things more awkward than it needs to be!” Baron Rothschild’s gentleman-like attitude was nowhere to be seen now. His eyes looked cold.

“Oh? What do you want to do now?” Yun Shen smiled coldly.

The man looked at them ruthlessly. “I just want the two of you to sign the contract. If not, I’m afraid… you guys will never leave Heavenly Spring Resort.”

Yun Shen laughed out loud. “Would you believe if I say that you’ll never be able to leave China?”

The man grinned questionably. “What will happen to me in China?”

“No matter what, I’m a little disappointed that your father isn’t here…” Han Xiao, who had been busy eating in the corner, spoke up. He looked at Baron as he licked his lips.

“Han Xiao?!” Baron was stunned to see who the person at the corner was. He never expected Han Xiao to be present and his surprise was apparent.

The only people he had focused on there were Yun Shen and Lu Tingxiao. He had ignored all the others, but who knew Lu Tingxiao and Yun Shen would be able to ask him for help!?

He knew that Han Xiao was helping Lu Tingxiao, but he never expected that Han Xiao would get involved like this.
