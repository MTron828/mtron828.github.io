Chapter 186: Sweet Nickname

She didn’t know what twisting move Lu Tingxiao made, and only saw the man’s whole body spin horizontally as he was tossed aside. He fell to the ground like a sack, and didn’t move after that…

It was probably because Lu Tingxiao had been so savage in his attack, that the other three men looked at each other before instinctively retreating.

"Are you alright?" When Lu Tingxiao turned in Ning Xi’s direction, there was still a hint of violence in his eyes.

Ning Xi nodded blankly. "I'm fine…"

She had never seen Lu Tingxiao fight, and had even assumed that for the large part, he was a mild and refined person. She had never thought that he would be so good… at fighting…

Just then, a black Ferrari pulled up nearby and slowed to a stop. A person stepped out of the car.

Dressed in a high-end, tailor-made Giorgio Armani suit, it was Ning Yaohua.

Ning Yaohua looked at the man beside Ning Xi as if he was looking at trash, and then glanced contemptuously at their parked car. "Ning Xi, is this the man you're been dallying with these last days, and the reason why you’ve never returned home? Driving a shabby car worth just several hundred thousand yuan!"

Hearing this, Ning Xi was so angry that she almost laughed aloud. "You judge a man’s worth by the car he drives?"

From his words, it turned out that he didn’t care about her becoming a mistress, only whether the person was powerful and influential enough.

Was it more noble for her to be the mistress of a man who drove a Bentley instead?

"If I don't judge by the car, am I supposed to judge by his face? I thought you had found someone distinguished, it turns out he’s some no-good boy toy! Really, the more you live, the worse you become!" Ning Yaohua cursed at her.

The man’s looks were not bad, but since he drove this kind of car, at the most he was only a small-time businessman of a small company.

Ning Xi: "…"

He actually called Lu Tingxiao a boy toy…

After scolding Ning Xi, Ning Yaohua gave Lu Tingxiao an overbearing and arrogant look. "Who are you? Do you know who she is? You dare to fool around with my, Ning Yaohua’s, daughter! Don’t you know that I can destroy you in the capital!" Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ning Xi: "…"

In front of outsiders, Lu Tingxiao never spoke needless words. In front of Ning Yaohua, he appeared even more condescending as he looked askance at him, not even bothering to give him a proper look.

Ning Yaohua was about to continue berating and humiliating him, but for some reason, a sliver of fear flashed in his heart, and he was suddenly unable to speak.

He was just a small-time boss, why was he so imposing…

Hmph, this good-for-nothing daughter of his must have definitely been deceived by this pretentious appearance!

"Ning Xi, what I said last night is still valid, it’s not too late if you choose to go back with me now!" Ning Yaohua said, as if he was performing an act of charity.

Ning Xi curled her lip and held onto Lu Tingxiao’s arm in an intimate gesture. "Sorry, I choose my boy toy! You should just go back to wherever you came from!"

"Ning Xi! You'll regret this!" Seeing them leave arm-in-arm, Ning Yaohua flew into a rage, then with a dark face, ordered the bodyguard next to him, "Follow them!"

Too many things had surprised him today, one of them being Ning Xi’s skill in martial arts. He had had the impression that this daughter of his was physically very weak.

The other was that man.

For some reason, he felt something was off about that man’s identity…

Back in the car.

Ning Xi immediately scratched her head and apologized to Lu Tingxiao. "Sorry! You were scolded for no reason because of me…"

"It’s fine." Although Lu Tingxiao had been scolded, at that moment, he was not angry at all.

The reason, naturally, was because of the way Ning Xi had hugged his arm at the end. Even the words "boy toy", because she had added "my" in front of them, became a sweet nickname.
