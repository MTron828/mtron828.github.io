Chapter 168: Love Her a Little More

"I got it myself, alright? But after that, Lu Tingxiao did help me a lot."

"Got it, as long as you’re okay. I’m hanging up! Remember to check the email I sent you!" Taking into consideration that she was still sick, Jiang Muye suppressed his anger with effort. He wasn't in the mood to ask how Lu Tingxiao had swept in like a hero to rescue her, and simply ended the call forcefully.

Damn it! If Lu Tingxiao hadn’t used dirty tricks to stall him, right now he should be the one standing by her side and helping her through this crisis!

Shameless, he was too shameless!

"Jiang Muye called?" Lu Tingxiao asked casually.

"Yes, he asked me if I needed help! And he also said he emailed me, I’m don’t know what it is, but he kept reminding me to take a look. He was all mysterious about it, I’m guessing it must be some kind of trick birthday gift. He did the same thing last year, and sent me an especially scary video. I was so angry I beat him up three times before I was satisfied…"

Ning Xi grumbled to herself and wasn't in a hurry to read the email. She continued scrolling through her texts and missed calls to see if there were any she needed to reply to.

The missed calls were mostly unknown numbers, which would definitely be from the media and press. As she scrolled down, she saw a name; the call had been made on her birthday.

Seeing the two characters, Ning Xi’s indifferent expression turned warm and soft. "I thought he forgot my birthday!"

"Who?" Lu Tingxiao tensed unconsciously.

"My little brother, Tang Nuo."

Lu Tingxiao nodded, and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

He was already jittery at the thought that it could be yet another ex-boyfriend.

Ning Xi called back immediately. "Hi, Xiao Nuo~"

"Sis, you finally returned my call! How are you? Is everything alright? Did those people give you a hard time? I saw it in a newspaper article…"

"Don’t worry, I’m fine!"

"But that woman said she was going to sue you!"

"Your sister is not someone to be trifled with, we’ll see who gets sued in the end!"

"Are you really okay?"

"I’m really alright! If you keep worrying about me, I’m going to suspect that you’re not seventeen, but seventy years old instead!" Saying this, Ning Xi paused. "But do you really trust me that much? Maybe I really did lose my mind, and stabbed Ning Xueluo on purpose?"

On the other end of the phone, the young man’s voice was clear and bright: "Who would I trust if not my own sister?"

At these words, warmth spread in Ning Xi’s heart. "You brat, you’re good with words!"

"I’ll stop worrying now that I know you’re okay. Ah, that’s right, I still haven't wished you happy birthday, but it’s past already…"

"No big deal, saying it now is the same. Thank you, my dear handsome, thoughtful little brother~"

"Don’t be so sappy! I won’t talk to you anymore, school’s going to start soon, I need to catch up on my holiday homework!"

"Go, go! Fighting, young man!"

After the call, Ning Xi’s mood was instantly sunny.

Seeing her good mood, Lu Tingxiao’s own mood was also lifted. "The two of you are very close?"

"That’s right! Even though we’re not related by blood, we’re very close. My grandmother favored boys over girls when I was little, right? Back then, only Xiao Nuo got to eat all the good food at home. I couldn’t even eat at the table, but Xiao Nuo would always hide some food away for me. And every time Grandmother found fault with me, he would always come out to protect me. He’s such a good brother!" Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Saying this, Ning Xi felt a little downcast. "Isn't it strange? My own blood treats me like the enemy, while the one I have no blood relations with is my family. I should’ve known from the start, interests always outweigh family in that circle…"

Lu Tingxiao gently patted the cute little hair bun on top of the girl’s sad, drooping head. "You’ll find better."

Every time he heard her speak about her childhood, he couldn’t help wanting to love her a little more, to dote on her a little more, to give her back double of everything that she had lost.
