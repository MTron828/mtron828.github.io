Chapter 203: A Huge Plot Reversal

The first to speak was Lu Jingli. "First, allow me to introduce you to the newest member of our Glory World, Ning Xi."

Ning Xi stood, bowed to the media and the cameras, then sat back down. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The photographers shot photos one after another.

Today, Ning Xi was wearing a black woman’s suit with neutral makeup on, very suitable for formal occasions.

Lu Jingli continued, "Next, the questions regarding our Leng Manyun that many netizens have asked will be answered by her agent, Miss Lin Zhizhi, one by one."

If it had been before, anything about Leng Manyun would definitely be the focus of attention, but now it unexpectedly became a topic that everyone hoped would finish as soon as possible…

Luckily, Lin Zhizhi’s style had always been very efficient. She used a few words to simply announce Leng Manyun’s marriage and her intention of focusing on her family in the future, which affirmed people’s guesses that Ning Xi was indeed being trained as Leng Manyun’s successor.

At that moment, a reporter spoke up, asking, "We only want to know why Glory World wants to sign an artiste with no morals, and even set her up as Leng Manyun’s successor! Isn’t Glory World afraid that doing so will ruin you?"

He was echoed by other reporters.

"Aren't you ruining Glory World's good name, a single rotten apple can spoil the whole barrel!"

"Have all your senior managers been bewitched by witchcraft?"

"Glory World, I would like to see if you can explain this properly!"

…

Lu Jingli and Chen Jing eyed each other. "Now we will be hearing from Lawyer Chen. Please, keep quiet."

Lawyer Chen?

They had been wondering why a lawyer would be invited to this press conference, so they all curiously turned to Chen Jing.

Chen Jing used his mouse to click something on the laptop screen before him, then everyone heard a voice through the speakers —

[It wasn’t Ning Xi! Ning Xi wasn't the one who bribed me! It was someone else who asked me to tamper with the prop! But I don’t know who that person is! I received an anonymous email with all the instructions in it, and ten thousand yuan was deposited directly into my account. They said that I would receive another ten thousand after it was done!]

The voice paused and there was three seconds of silence, then the audience screamed.

Lu Jingli’s eyes became cold. "Keep silent, please."

The reporters reined in their shock and breathed hard, staring.

Then, the big screen behind Chen Jing lit up to display two images. One was of the IP address which sent the anonymous email; it was unexpectedly at the Regal Riviera Hotel where Ning Xueluo was staying. The other image was of the anonymous account which had been cracked. It belonged to Ning Xueluo’s assistant, Cui Caijing.

At that moment, the shouting could no longer be suppressed.

However, it wasn’t over yet.

Chen Jing next displayed Ning Xueluo’s certificate of injury and her doctor's diagnosis report, proving that at the time of the incident, Ning Xi had quickly pulled back her hand, withdrawing her strength almost immediately after realizing that something was amiss. As a result, Ning Xueluo had only sustained a very light skin injury and could have left the hospital that same day.

Despite this, Ning Xueluo had remained in the hospital for several days, pretending to be very weak due to her ‘serious’ injury and blood loss.

After displaying the evidence, Chen Jing brought out a lawyer's letter and said that he had filed a formal complaint against Ning Xueluo for slandering Ning Xi.
