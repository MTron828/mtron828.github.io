Chapter 207: How Can I Continue to Trust You?

The remote control dropped on the floor, Ning Xueluo’s whole face was colorless and twisted.

She’d thought the worst-case scenario would Ning Xi successfully proving herself innocent; she wouldn't have expected in a million years that Ning Xi would be able to find concrete evidence to expose herself.

The sender of that anonymous email benefited from both sides? Blackmailed her for 8 million and then turned around and sold the evidence to Glory World right after?

On the TV, a reporter was asking Ning Xi: "Ning Xi, as far as anyone knows, you have a close relationship with Ning Xueluo. What is her motivation? Is there a misunderstanding between you two?"

Ning Xueluo’s fingers quivered and she quickly turned off the TV, threw away the remote control, and then tightly grasped Su Yan. "Brother Yan, let me explain…"

Ning Xueluo felt Su Yan trembling all over after she hugged him, his tightened fists creaking, and his gentle face looked extremely pale and awful…

She had never seen Su Yan like this before!

Profound fear swallowed up Ning Xueluo’s heart, she could only grasped Su Yan tighter and explain in a rush, "Brother Yan, it wasn’t me… It truly wasn't me… I didn't know anything about it… I didn't expect that Cui Caijing would do such thing! Maybe she wanted to set me up because I called her names several times when I wasn’t feeling well?"

Su Yan let her grasp him however she wanted, but he didn't move at all and his voice was without warmth as he spoke. "If Cui Caijing was framing you, then why would she ask Zhang Qiang to set up Ning Xi? What benefit could she get?"

Ning Xueluo’s face froze and she spoke up again immediately, "She wanted someone to be a scapegoat! She followed me everywhere and knew that Ning Xi treated me horribly in private, so if she put the blame on Ning Xi, I wouldn't suspect her at all…" Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Even if I believe your far-fetched explanation, what about your injury?" Su Yan continued asking.

Ning Xueluo had managed to calm herself down a bit and explained as if she was the one who had suffered an injustice, "I said from the beginning that I was fine, daddy and mummy were just too worried about me and asked me to stay in the hospital all that time. Brother Yan, you know that I was mentally and physically exhausted at that time and felt horrible. How could they blackmail me like that!"

Deep sorrow flashed across Su Yan’s numb face. "Xueluo… how can I continue to trust you?"

Ning Xueluo bawled her eyes out, grabbing his hand tightly and looking at him as if he was her only redemption. "Brother Yan! Trust me! Please trust me! People must be criticizing me everywhere out there, if you don't trust me, how will I be able to move on? The people who don't know me, I don't care about them, but don't you know me? You think I would do something like this to Xiao Xi? Brother Yan, please… please… don’t abandon me…"

Su Yan looked sluggish and absentminded; he had no reaction.

Ning Xueluo stared at him nervously.

After half an hour, Su Yan finally took a deep breath and pushed her hand away, then staggered out the door.

Ning Xueluo panicked. "Brother Yan, where are you going?"

"Don’t follow me, I need some peace and quiet."

"Bang," the door was shut.

In the room, Ning Xueluo, like a piece of rotten clay, crashed to the floor like she had just been struck by a huge disaster, then swiftly called Chang Li…
