Chapter 834: Little Treasure Has Gone Missing

Nevertheless, she knew that Guan Ziyao was being nice, so Yan Ruyi patted her hands and thanked her, "Thank you, Ziyao, Little Treasure is doing well now. If there’s a need, I’ll surely look for you!"

Before Little Treasure’s condition stabilized, she would not let anyone be in contact with Little Treasure easily, even if it was Guan Ziyao.

Guan Ziyao still felt hopeful and she asked, "Is Little Treasure going to school now?"

"Yes, he is."

"Which school?" Guan Ziyao asked again.

"Glorious Kindergarten."

"As far as I know, it’s a good school, but it is just a normal kindergarten…with Little Treasure’s condition, he should go to a special needs school! I know a school specially designed for kids with autism. I’ve personally gone there before for a project. It’s really well planned and most of the children have had positive changes after they went there. I know the principal. Do you want to have Little Treasure transferred there?" Guan Ziyao probed.

Although Yan Ruyi did not think Little Treasure was autistic, if there was anything that could help him progress, she would be willing to try.

She was slightly tempted by Guan Ziyao’s persuasive tone, but she hesitated again, "Well, I need to talk to Tingxiao about it before making a decision."

Guan Ziyao quickly clarified, "Of course, it’s not an urgent matter, just contact me anytime you need me! I’ll talk to Tingxiao about this later and see what he thinks!"

"Alright…thank you, Ziyao!" Yan Ruyi was relieved.

Not only did Guan Ziyao not mind about Little Treasure’s existence, she was so concerned about him, pleasing Yan Ruyi immensely.

…

As they were chatting casually, a maid suddenly rushed towards them. Whispering into Yan Ruyi’s ears, she said, "Madam, Little Master…Little Master has gone missing!"

"What? What did you say?" Yan Ruyi’s expression changed drastically.

Guan Ziyao looked over. "What happened?"

A while later, Yan Ruyi, Guan Ziyao, Lu Chongshan, Lu Tingxiao, and Lu Jingli all appeared in the room Little Treasure was in.

Lu Chongshan looked displeased. "Why would he suddenly go missing? What were you doing?"

The maid looked at Yan Ruyi, then at Guan Ziyao, her expression troubled. In order to avoid Lu Chongshan’s anger, she replied honestly, "Actually, Little Master came out a little while ago, but when he overheard Madam Lu’s conversation with Ms. Guan, he suddenly ran away. There were too many people at that moment and I was unable to catch up, then I couldn’t find him anywhere…"

The maid was sobbing. The Little Master was the core of the family! If anything happened to him, she would be done for!

"What were you both talking about?" Lu Chongshan stared sharply at Yan Ruyi and Guan Ziyao. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yan Ruyi’s face went pale. "Could it be…"

Guan Ziyao’s expression changed as well.

"Say something!" Lu Chongshan looked at Yan Ruyi anxiously.

As Lu Chongshan was asking Yan Ruyi, Guan Ziyao’s voice sounded out from Lu Tingxiao’s phone.

"Aunty, Little Treasure’s condition…I knew a little…special needs child…when Zhichen was five years old…I knew a school designed for children with autism…"

As they were talking, Lu Tingxiao had calmly accessed the CCTV system and checked through the footages…
