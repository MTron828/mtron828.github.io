Chapter 39: Not Thick At All

"Screw him! Who do they think they are?!" All of a sudden, Ning Xi threw a violent punch. If Lu Tingxiao hadn’t reacted fast enough, based on the strength of that punch, he would have ended up with a broken jaw.

"Girls shouldn’t say vulgar things." Lu Tingxiao frowned.

Although, she was also very cute when she was swearing.

Ning Xi was incredibly drunk, but she still had some awareness left. She felt that the person hugging her meant her no harm and was incredibly gentle, so she slowly let her guard down. She remained in his lap and no longer struggled in his embrace, only continuing to speak in her drunken stupor. "This old woman doesn’t think it’s worth doing… otherwise, otherwise based on this old woman’s face… I can find an even bigger… the biggest and thickest thigh to hug… you all think you can suppress me… then I’ll go out and find… I’ll go now…"

Hearing this, Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrows, then roughly took hold of her hands and placed them between his thighs. "The one with the thickest thighs in the capital is right here. Do you still want to go and look for one?"

Ning Xi randomly squeezed the muscles in his thigh and felt around before exclaiming loudly, "Not thick! Not thick at all!"

Lu Tingxiao: "…"

He was actually given the cold shoulder because his was not thick enough.

There was no way that any man would accept this.

What was worse was that her hand had touched a place that shouldn’t have been touched, and she had even patted him there. "Hm, what is this… so annoying… it poked me…"

Her tone was filled with disdain.

Lu Tingxiao’s expression turned ugly.

If he let her continue on like this, he might do something that would go against his morals.

The person who had been outside was already long gone, so Lu Tingxiao immediately opened the door and carried Ning Xi out.

They reached the underground parking.

The one who smugly opened the door for them was Lu Jingli.

"Why is it you?" Lu Tingxiao frowned. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

"I went over to your place to find you, but both you and Little Treasure weren’t there, so I came over to look for you two! Brother, you really don’t know the bro code. When did you even buy this car? It’s even cooler than the one you gave me! I feel like I don’t know anything!" Lu Jingli looked like he had been wronged.

Lu Tingxiao ignored him and carried Ning Xi into the back seat.

Lu Jingli was sitting in the front, and turned his head to scrutinize Lu Tingxiao and Ning Xi’s disheveled clothing, his face that of a gossipmonger. "Where did you pick her up? Why did you take so long? Look at Little Treasure, he almost became the Amah Rock!"

Little Treasure had pressed himself against the glass window as soon as he had seen Ning Xi.

Lu Tingxiao was originally worried that Ning Xi would be a rowdy drunk, but who knew that when Little Treasure approached her, she didn’t react in any extreme way, only looked at him and then hugged him like a comfortable pillow.

Lu Tingxiao was not the type to feed gossip, and he slowly took off his tie and jacket. "What happened today?"

At the mention of what he was best at — investigation — Lu Jingli immediately lit up. "According to my sources, everything went well. You even used Arthur, so of course Ning Xi successfully wowed the whole crowd, and the media responded positively towards her!"

"Who did she see tonight?" Lu Tingxiao asked another question.

Lu Jingli tried to remember. "Besides the cast and crew, there was Ning Yaohua, and there was…"

Lu Jingli glanced at his brother’s expression, and gulped before continuing. "Su Yan… my guess is that she got drunk like this because she saw her ex-boyfriend, who is now with her arch nemesis, Ning Xueluo, so she probably didn’t feel good…"

Although Lu Jingli had deliberately taken care to speak carefully, Lu Tingxiao’s face still darkened in a flash.

He was really terrifying.

‘To hug a big / thick thigh’ is to curry favor with someone, usually a person with more power or status.

Amah Rock is a natural rock formation in Hong Kong — the Chinese name 望夫石 means ‘keeping watch for her husband’.
