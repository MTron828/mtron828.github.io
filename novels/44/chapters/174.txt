Chapter 175: Finally Make An Appearance

Chang Li calmed down and comforted her: "Calm down, Xueluo. The email said that we have twenty-four hours to send eight million yuan to that account, so obviously it’s about money! Just give them the money! Anything that can be solved with money is not an issue!"

Ning Xueluo said agitatedly, "Eight million yuan! And only a day to get it! Where am I going to get so much money?"

Although she was made of money, she spent extravagantly. To keep up appearances in order to curry favor with the Ning family and the people in the industry, all of that required money.

"If we collect it from different sources… we can somehow gather that amount!" Chang Li muttered. Privately, she thought that the other party had really quoted the right price; that was just about the maximum amount they could come up with.

Just then, Ning Xueluo suddenly thought of something: "Since the other party was able to trace our information, why can't we do the same?" Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Chang Li shook her head. "Is an anonymous account so easy to trace? We have to hack into the bank’s system! Even if we pay someone to do it, we don’t have the time to look for a hacker with that type of skill. Besides, even if we find out who it is, then what? They have blackmail material on us. This money… no matter what, we would still have to give it to them!"

"Damn it…" Ning Xueluo glared fiercely at Cui Caijing, who was hiding in a corner. "You can’t accomplish anything, but can spoil everything!"

If it wasn’t because she had blackmail on the woman and could use her without fear of being betrayed, she would have kicked her out a long time ago.

Cui Caijing wanted to retort, but didn’t dare say anything no matter how angry she was. She really was completely innocent, alright…

With some effort, Ning Xueluo recovered from her earlier fright, and struggled to remain calm as she urged, "Sister Chang, help me go and raise the money now! Hurry! Also, hire more water army to make sure that within a week, there is no longer any room for Ning Xi to turn around and clear her name!"

"Xueluo, we have Zhang Qiang's confession anyway, do you think… should we just have her thrown in jail once and for all?" Chang Li tentatively suggested.

"No, even if the Ning family don’t care for her, they won’t go so far as to have her go to prison. Remember, don't let her cancel her contract. It's better that she remains in the company her whole life, otherwise, if she's desperate enough to run back to the Ning family, it’ll be harder for me to control her then…

Also, in case something unexpected happens tomorrow, I’ll arrange a capable lawyer for you!"

Ning Xueluo racked her brain and gave instructions for every aspect she could think of. Only after she was certain that she had missed nothing did she relax.

Everything had been going smoothly, and she had never expected such a huge mess to crop up halfway through. Fortunately, Chang Li was right; anything that could be solved with money was not an issue. For what was to come, she definitely wouldn’t allow another mistake to happen again!

…

The second day.

Ning Xi received the eight million yuan without a hitch. At six o'clock in the evening, together with the lawyer Lu Tingxiao had arranged for her, she headed for Starlight Entertainment.

It also happened to be the time when employees were getting off work, and everyone who saw Ning Xi were stunned, before they immediately started crazily spreading the news. Messages and photos popped up in online groups on Weibo - Ning Xi, who had previously vanished without a trace, had finally appeared!

"My god! Ning Xi! It really is her! She actually dared to show up!"

"That’s right! She’s really bold! If I were her, I would definitely have run away, what’s she trying to do, coming back now?"

"That’s right, there’s no way she can survive in the entertainment industry after this, she might even be charged and imprisoned, she should have just run away!"

"Did you see the man with her? He clearly looks like an elite! What’s his background?"

"He doesn’t seem like a lover. Is he her assistant?"

"No way! She’s already fallen to this extent, can she still hire an assistant?"

"Don’t you think she could just sleep with a sponsor?"

"Hehe, I’d like to see what kind of sponsor is able to fix such a huge problem for her!"
