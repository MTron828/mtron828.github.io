Chapter 1150: Such A Brother!

What a wonderful feeling to have a friend to share worries with and to share a bed together…

"Xiao Xi, thank you so much. I’m really not scared anymore. I was pretty scared and in despair at first… but I’m really glad that you came! It’s alright now. You don’t have to worry about me anymore!" Zhuang Keer eased Ning Xi’s worries as she was comforting her.

"Alright then, let’s go to sleep!"

"Mmm, goodnight."

…

At night, the two girls slept beside each other.

Although Ning Xi closed her eyes, she did not fall asleep until a stable breathing sound came from beside her.

Zhuang Keer slept peacefully with a warm expression on her face and no signs of fear or any symptoms of a nightmare.

Ning Xi’s worried heart eased.

That was fortunate…

She did not want to see another one like herself…

She tried her best to avoid something like this from happening, so she comforted Zhuang Keer as if she was saving her former self…

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Ning Xi shifted her body up slightly. "Come in."

The door opened and Zhuang Rongguang came in quietly. "Sis Xi, is my sister asleep?"

"Mm-hmm."

"I…" Zhuang Rongguang looked at Ning Xi cautiously. "Sis Xi, can I talk to you for a bit?"

Ning Xi looked at him and left the bed. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the living room, Zhuang Rongguang was standing awkwardly in front of Ning Xi. He quickly took a chair and gestured to Ning Xi. "Please sit, Sis Xi."

He then got her a glass of water before standing in front of her awkwardly again. He did not know how to initiate a conversation with her.

Ning Xi took a sip of water from the glass and glanced at the young man. "Speak your mind!"

Zhuang Rongguang chewed on his lip. After some time, he spoke quietly, "Sis Xi, can I still be saved?"

Ning Xi studied him. He seemed like a nervous young man awaiting his life sentence. "The world will save the one who wants to save himself. Now that you’re still here and asking me this question, there’s still hope for you."

Zhuang Rongguang’s tensed up back relaxed a little and his eyes watered. "I know about the story of the boy who cried wolf. I understand that no matter what I say, no one will believe me again…but this time, I will prove myself through my actions…"

Zhuang Rongguang looked at Ning Xi shyly. "Sis Xi, I want to become a man like you in the future!"

Ning Xi’s mouth twitched. "Your ambition…"

Wait, she was a woman, alright!?

"Sis Xi, what were you doing before? Are you really just a normal actress?" Zhuang Rongguang asked her curiously.

Ning Xi’s eyes brightened. "What if I said no?"

Zhuang Rongguang was a little taken aback, then he said with determination, "No matter who you were before, good or bad, you’re treating my sister so well and have helped us so much. You’re a good person in my heart! Moreover, giving the enemy kindness is being cruel to yourself! You became my brother when you opened fire!"

"Thank you…"
