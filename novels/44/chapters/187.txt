Chapter 188: Do You Like This Style?

Sparkling powder exploded in a mushroom cloud, covering Lu Tingxiao’s head and clothes.

A closer look revealed that scattered in the mess that had exploded were lots of shiny objects that… looked like… diamonds…

This familiar way of sending things, she didn’t need to ask, she already knew who the sender was.

It was just that his taste had become worse.

While a certain someone crushed people with money, this person crushed them with diamonds! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Although the carat size wasn’t large, there were so many of them, that if each one was made into a ring, there would be hundreds of thousands of young men who could propose marriage to their sweethearts!

It wasn’t just Lu Tingxiao, Ning Xi and Little Treasure in the back seat had also been caught a little in the exploding mess, and their bodies flashed and glittered with it.

Ning Xi: "…"

Lu Tingxiao: "…"

Little Treasure: "…"

Ning Xi wiped her face, and then helped Little Treasure wipe his. Then she quickly leaned over to help pick at the mess that was stuck to Lu Tingxiao. "I'm sorry, I’m sorry… are you alright? Did any of it get in your eyes?"

Lu Tingxiao ran a hand through his hair, shaking loose a small shower of tiny diamonds, and a piece of paper.

He picked it up and read what was written on it: Dearest, happy birthday. You still like this sort of thing, right? - YS.

"You…" Lu Tingxiao looked at her with a slightly complicated expression. "Do you like this style?"

He started to reflect on himself; compared with the simple and straightforward methods which other people used, was the way he expressed his intentions too vague?

Ning Xi was speechless. "Do I look like I like this type of thing? While you can still call it a surprise, but this is a horror thriller, alright? Lu Tingxiao, although you are very rich, you must not ever chase a girl like this in the future! If you want to chase someone, I can teach you later! It’s a promise!"

When Lu Tingxiao heard this, the corners of his mouth tilted upwards slightly. It was exactly what he wanted: "Okay."

At this moment, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a car following them in the rearview mirror.

It looked like Ning Yaohua’s car.

Seeing something off in Lu Tingxiao’s expression, Ning Xi followed his gaze, and also saw the car. "F***! This guy just doesn’t stop!"

"Do we need to throw them off?" asked Lu Tingxiao.

Ning Xi thought about it gloomily, then shook her head. "Forget it, ignore him, they can't get in anyway. And Little Treasure is still in the car, it would be too dangerous to drive fast."

"Mm."

Ten minutes later, Platinum Palace.

Lu Tingxiao's small black car, which completely did not match the luxury cars coming and going, slowly approached the front gate.

When it was a few meters away, the guard saluted respectfully and then gallantly opened the gate for them, and kept watching the car until it drove out of sight.

But Ning Yaohua, who was following them closely, was immediately stopped.

"Hello, please show me your pass." The guard had a business-like expression on his face.

Ning Yaohua looked anxiously at the black car, which disappeared around a corner, and asked impatiently, "What pass?"

"If you don’t have a pass, you may have the resident inside call to let us know to let you in," said the guard.

Ning Yaohua frowned. "Then why could that car just now enter so easily?"

"He is our resident," the guard answered.

"What?" Ning Yaohua’s face instantly changed.

Was there a mistake?

It was Platinum Palace! The gathering place for the wealthiest people in the capital! Not just anyone could live there!

How could that boy toy driving that shabby car be a resident here?

Or… or could he be a housekeeper or assistant, or someone’s illegitimate son?
