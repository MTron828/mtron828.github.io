“It doesn’t matter what I’m going to do about it. What matters is what you’re going to do now!”

Xu Tao pivoted away happily and broke eye contact with Zheng Anru.

Zheng Anru’s expression darkened. She stood there and remained silent. It was a mess inside her head.

She was freaking out for real this time.

…

“Ms. Ning Xi, how did you get the role of the female lead in this movie?” The reporters asked Ning Xi.

Before Ning Xi could answer, the assistant director Simon Joseph replied, “Simple, that’s because Ms. Ning Xi’s image fits the image of the female lead, Anna.”

“This is the first time Hollywood is using a Chinese actress as the female lead in a movie. As the most popular star in China as of now, we believe she’s the best choice,” Weir added on.

This was a big slap on Han Zixuan’s face.

“Mr. Weir, have you seen any of Ms. Ning Xi’s work before?” A male reporter asked.

While they were really a team now, it was still unbelievable.

“Yes, after I found out that I’m going to act with Ms. Ning Xi, I looked through her work. ‘The World’ has a really strong flavor of China; while I don’t fully understand it, Meng Changge’s character is fantastic, and the blind mother she played in the movie ‘Mother’… She really expressed humanity and motherhood to the fullest.

“As for Ms. Ning Xi’s performance in the male outfit in the movie ‘Dream Chaser’, it further proved that she has the capability to handle the role of Anna in a male outfit!” Weir analyzed carefully, showing that he was really informed about Ning Xi’s past work.

Actually, Weir had watched Ning Xi’s work and was really fond of her performance.

“In a way, I’m a fan of Ms. Ning Xi’s. I’m really looking forward to work with her.” Weir smiled.

“Thank you, Mr. Weir,” Ning Xi said to Weir.

It was out of Ning Xi’s expectation to receive such a high praise from Weir.

“It’s surprising that Mr. Weir would be a fan of Ms. Ning Xi’s.” The reporters were shocked after they listened to Weir’s comment.

“Thank you for your answer, Mr. Weir. I have another question. If you had a choice, would you rather be in a scene with Ms. Ning Xi or Ms. Han Zixuan?”

“What?” Weir was confused.

“Ms. Ning Xi and Ms. Han Zixuan: who would you prefer to work with…”

The reporter thought Weir did not catch his words, so he repeated it again.

“I understand what you mean, but… the Ms. Han Zixuan you mentioned… I’m sorry, I’ve never noticed her before,” Weir said.

Top international stars like him would never sugar coat their words at public events.

If they knew, they knew, and they would just admit so if they did not.

The expressions on Zheng Anru’s and Han Zixuan’s faces were darker than the bottom of a kettle at the moment.

The assistants were starting to complain.

“Mr. Weir, Ms. Han Zixuan is also a top star in our country. Well, her popularity is on par with Ms. Ning Xi’s.” The reporter sounded awkward.

“I’m sorry, I’ve only see the works of Ms. Ning Xi before and don’t know about Ms. Han Zixuan. If any chance arises in the future, I’ll definitely look at them and answer your question by then,” Weir replied.
