Chapter 214: It’s All Over

They finally arrived at ward 307.

Out of breath, Ning Xi bent over, and unable to wait any longer, Lu Jingli pushed the door open before she could straighten up.

A second later, Ning Xi still hadn’t seen who was inside when Lu Jingli’s face suddenly sank and he closed the door. He grabbed her shoulders and pushed her outside, saying, "Xiao Xi Xi, go, go, go… forget about it! This Junior Master was looking forward to it all this time, but it turned out to be this thing! Let him die!"

"Who is it, why are you acting like this?"

"Well, you won’t regret leaving, regardless!"

"Su Yan?" guessed Ning Xi.

Lu Jingli straightened his face. "Hell yeah, it’s him! Now we can go!"

"We can’t leave if it’s him!" Ning Xi pushed Lu Jingli’s hands off her shoulders and turned to walk inside the ward.

Lu Jingli anxiously stomped his feet. "Xiao Xi Xi, why do you care about him! You, you, you… it’s still not over between you two?

Ning Xi didn't answer and walked straight into the ward.

It was Su Yan in the ward. Lying quietly on the bed, his head was covered by a thin veil and an IV drip was in his hand.

Ning Xi lightly sat on the edge of the bed and reached out to fix his hair. The look on her face was gentle, and she spoke even more gently, "Brother Yan…"

Lu Jingli: "…!!!"

What the f*** did I just see! What did I hear!

Ning Xi still liked this guy? Luckily, his brother wasn't with them, otherwise he would get mad!

As Lu Jingli was thinking, a wave of iciness blew in from behind him. He turned his head and saw…

His brother was right there!!!

"Bro… bro… why are you here?"

Little Treasure was in his arms and Jiang Muye was behind him; all three of them had come.

He imagined that Little Treasure had been unable to wait any longer and wanted to come up, so his brother brought him and Jiang Muye followed them.

Now… it was over!

In bed, Su Yan looked pale and frowned, slowly opening his eyes. "Xiao Xi…" Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"How are you feeling?" asked Ning Xi.

Su Yan looked at the girl before him in a daze. "Am I dreaming?"

Every time he met Ning Xi, they argued and things would end unhappily. He couldn’t remember how long it had been since she last spoke to him so nicely.

The moment he woke up, he saw concern for him in her eyes. She even called him Brother Yan…

Ning Xi stood next to the bed and returned to being her cool self. "You just had an operation, the doctors said that you’re fine now. You only have a small concussion remaining and need to stay in the hospital for a bit longer to recover. If there’s nothing else, I should go…"

She turned away as she finished speaking, but suddenly her wrist was grabbed—

"Don’t leave me! Xiao Xi, don't go…"

"Anything else?"

"I…" Su Yan struggled, then watched her as he let everything out in one breath. "Although I know you don't care for or need it, I’m sorry… I still want to tell you that I’m sorry! I misunderstood you! You know what? When I thought I was going to die, at that moment, I couldn’t think of anything except how I still haven't had a chance to apologize to you…"

Outside the door, Lu Jingli looked at Ning Xi’s wrist, which was being grabbed by Su Yan. He quaking in fear and swallowed, then turned and saw his brother's face. As expected, it was abnormally scary…

He was really mad, what was Xiao Xi Xi thinking?
