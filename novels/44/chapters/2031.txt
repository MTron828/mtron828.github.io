In Deer Town.

“Ah, what should I do? It’s vomiting milk again!” Ning Xi had a milk bottle in one hand and a white tiger cub in another.

Little Treasure freaked out as well. He almost cried as he saw the white tiger cub suffering.

Lu Tingxiao pinched the space between his eyebrows. “Let me do it.”

He carefully took the cub and patted its back, then he changed positions and continued feeding it.

This time, the white tiger cub finally gulped the milk smoothly.

How loving!

Ning Xi was impressed. “Darling, did you feed Little Treasure like this when he was little?”

Before Lu Tingxiao could answer, Little Treasure shook his head wildly. “He has never fed me milk.”

Ning Xi laughed. “How do you know? Do you remember the things that happened when you were little?”

Little Treasure continued with his offense in a determined tone. “It’s a reasonable speculation.”

Lu Tingxiao looked at his child and coughed lightly with a helpless expression, yet he could not say anything.

Well, he had been really busy back then, and… he had no feelings for this son who had not been part of his life plan.

Little Treasure looked up at his mother. “The heavens had plans for me. My will would be burdened, my body would be worked, my stomach would be starved. I had to empty myself and cleanse myself through thoroughly. Fate must’ve made me undergo those experiences to meet you, Mommy.”

Ning Xi was feeling bad for him, yet Little Treasure’s eyes lit up and told her those words with such an honest pair of eyes. She hugged the little guy and gave him a kiss. “Baby, how are you so cute?”

Lu Tingxiao was speechless.

Burden his will, work his body, starve his stomach? Was he torturing him?

He felt oddly wronged…

At the same time, by the lakeside, deer were drinking from the lake and a flock of birds flew past.

Gong Shangze was sitting on the grass with the lake behind him as he focused intently on the loving family. He held paper and pen in his hand, and his eyes were glittering.

As if blessed with life, the pen tip was dancing swiftly across the draft papers.

Lu Jingli hid from Ning Xi and his brother. He held half a watermelon in his hand and was eating it with a spoon as he watched Gong Shangze work.

After a long time, the sweetness in the air was almost suffocating but Gong Shangze still did not move one bit.

Lu Jingli could not hold it in anymore. He looked at Gong Shangze like how a person would look at God and said, “Bro, you’re… really courageous!”

It was the first time he had seen someone request to watch people display their affection to each other and even watched it so seriously.

Gong Shangze gave him a doubtful look. He did not understand what Lu Jingli was talking about. “Second Master, what’s wrong?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Jingli patted his shoulder. “As a single person, don’t you feel your heart ache watching them?”

Gong Shangze looked at Lu Jingli in surprise. “Why? I’m very happy.”

Lu Jingli’s mouth twitched.

The mind of a genius was very different from others!
