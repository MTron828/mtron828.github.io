Chapter 2001: I Can’t Protect Myself

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

An evil intention passed right through Ning Xueluo’s eyes, yet her face looked innocent as ever. She pasted a bitter smile on her face and shook her head.

“Why would I leave if I could make the decision? I’ve been in Starlight for so long that it has become my second home. You’re just like my sister. I wanted to stay in the company too, but…”

Halfway through her sentence, Ning Xueluo suddenly sighed, the wry smile on her face worsening by the second.

“It’s fine. The fact is that I’ve left. Nothing else I say will change the situation, but now, because of me, you’re affected.”

Ning Xueluo stopped and looked at Han Zixuan oddly as if she had just said something she should not have.

Han Zixuan was not stupid. It was obvious that Ning Xueluo had something else to say and that it was related to her. She would never let this go, so she quickly held Ning Xueluo’s hand tenderly. “Vice CEO Ning, what happened? You’re the one who brought me up. Can’t you trust me?”

Ning Xueluo shook her head. “Zixuan, you’re like my sister. There’s no way I don’t trust you. It’s just that the times have changed. In the past, I could protect you no matter what happened, but now…”

“I don’t want to tell you because I don’t want to involve you. After all, I can’t even protect myself now.”

Ning Xueluo’s words shocked Han Zixuan. Ning Xueluo was now the daughter-in-law of the Su family. With her position, who could pose a threat to her?

Unconsciously, Ning Xi’s face flashed through in Han Zixuan’s mind. Was Ning Xi the reason for Ning Xueluo’s retirement? Could it be…

Han Zixuan looked at Ning Xueluo in doubt. She hesitated for a while, then asked, “Is it Ning Xi?”

Ning Xueluo’s shoulders trembled when Han Zixuan mentioned the name Ning Xi. She lowered her head and put on an expression as if she had suffered a lot and was just surviving it.

Ning Xi again?!

Han Zixuan was determined that it was related to Ning Xi based on Ning Xueluo’s reaction.

“That witch messed with you? You were the top star back in the days. If it weren’t for her, you’d never have to quit. You’re already out of the industry and she’s still pestering you?! Just how shameless is she?!” Han Zixuan responded angrily. She was not exactly sympathizing with Ning Xueluo; it just so happen that their common enemy was Ning Xi.

Her anger was real.

Ning Xueluo observed Han Zixuan’s reactions. Obviously, she knew what Han Zixuan was thinking about, but she did not show it. She looked up with a bitter smile and peered at Han ZIxuan with her helpless and lonely eyes as she patted her flat stomach with her hand.

“It’s not her fault. It’s my own problem. I got pregnant some time ago. Su Yan is worried that I might be too tired, which is why he wanted me to leave Starlight and focus on the baby.”

Ning Xueluo hesitated with a lonely and forlorn vibe lying in her tone.

“You’re pregnant?” Han Zixuan’s eyes flew wide open. She quickly changed to a joyful tone. “Congratulations, Vice CEO Ning is really blessed! CEO Su loves you so much and you’re having his baby now. CEO Su must be treasuring you even more from now on. I’m envious!”
