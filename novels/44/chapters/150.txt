Chapter 151: Couldn't Love Him Enough

Little Bun had carefully prepared a birthday gift and surprise for her. He had been eagerly looking forward to it at first, then his anticipation had started to wane, then when he panicked and became scared when he couldn‚Äôt get in touch with her‚Ä¶

Wasn‚Äôt this too cruel a thing for him to experience?

Thinking about this, Ning Xi felt a knife twist in her heart, and for a moment she hugged Little Treasure and refused to let him go.

Lu Tingxiao didn't want to disturb the two of them, but out of one last bit of brotherly concern, he reminded her, "Ning Xi, ask Little Treasure to call back those robots."

"Oh oh oh‚Ä¶ right‚Ä¶"Only then did Ning Xi remember that there was still an army of robots out in the front destroying the house, and Lu Jingli‚Äôs arm was still being held hostage!

So she hurriedly said to Little Bun, "Darling, can you call them back?"

Little Treasure nodded, then faced the screen, his tiny fingers moving swiftly on the keyboard.

Ning Xi was very impressed by his skills, and gasped in admiration. "Darling, how are you so amazing, I thought you could only draw! This is too too too amazing! These last few years, I‚Äôve been studying so much, and I went crazy trying to learn everything and anything, but this is the one thing I could never grasp. What programming, what C language, C++, it was a real nightmare for me, but you‚Äôre only five years old, and you‚Äôre so smooth! You‚Äôre a genius!"

Little Bun‚Äôs expression was still wooden, but the light in his eyes brightened.

But nearby, Lu Tingxiao could no longer leave things as they were, and sighed slightly. "Ning Xi, this is not the time to praise him."

"Eh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs right!" Ning Xi finally reacted to the huge mess that Little Treasure had caused.

Troubled, she scratched her head and looked at Lu Tingxiao. "You‚Äôre not going to make me instruct him not to do this again, are you? He did everything he promised me he would. He‚Äôs not starving himself anymore, he‚Äôs not throwing things around. In the end, he elevated his methods! If I tell him not to do this anymore, what are we going to do if next time, he comes up with something even more advanced?"

Lu Tingxiao: "‚Ä¶" With Little Treasure, it was very possible.

Ning Xi spread her hands. "To summarize, I think it‚Äôs better that I don‚Äôt say anything."

Actually, she was being selfish. She didn't want to criticize Little Bun for what happened today. She loved him too much, and just couldn‚Äôt love him enough; how could she say anything harsh to him?

Fortunately, Lu Tingxiao in the end didn't insist.

Basically, in front of Ning Xi, his principles became nothing.

The three of them took the open-top car back to the entrance of the Lu residence.

Ning Xi was surprised to see that all the robots, which had been causing so much chaos just now, had lined up neatly in two rows, one on each side, as if to welcome them. It was a pretty grand scene.

The only thing to spoil it were the anguished wails nearby ‚Äî

"Brother, what took you so long! My freaking arm is dislocated!"

"You scream like this for just a dislocated arm!" Ning Xi looked at him disdainfully and jumped out of the car. She pressed down on his arm, and pulled and lifted it with a kaba sound.

"Ouch‚Äî" Lu Jingli screamed like a pig being slaughtered.

Ning Xi patted his shoulder. "Stop screaming! It‚Äôs done, check it!"

"Huh?" Lu Jingli blinked, and moved his arm; it really was fixed.

But he was still worried, and he murmured, "Did you put it back in the right spot?"

"Of course! I‚Äôm very experienced!" Ning Xi said confidently.

Lu Jingli‚Äôs face was full of suspicion. "May I ask why are you experienced with this type of thing?"

Ning Xi: "Because I used to fight with Jiang Muye a lot, and he dislocated his arm quite a few times. I was the one who helped him put it back!"

Lu Jingli: "‚Ä¶"

Are you sure they were fights, and not you beating him up one-sidedly? Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

He really worried for his brother's future, would it contain domestic violence? Forget it, what was he worried about, even if his brother got beaten up, he would definitely take it gladly‚Ä¶
