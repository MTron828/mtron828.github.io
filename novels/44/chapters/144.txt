Chapter 145: Become Your Brainless Fan

"What is it?" Ning Xi tilted her head.

Was it because he liked her, so no matter what she did, he thought it was cute? Lu Tingxiao couldn't help touching her little head lovingly. "Do you like diamonds?" 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Ah?" Ning Xi hadn’t expected that he would suddenly ask such a strange question. "Why do you ask?"

"Today is your birthday, Little Treasure helped me prepare a birthday gift for you. It seems he picked out diamonds. I’m helping him ask in case you don't like it." Lu Tingxiao acted normal.

"So it’s like that…" Ning Xi scratched her head, then said, "Well, diamonds are supposed to be a girl’s best friend, right? But it’s just a birthday, and he’s a little kid, he shouldn’t be getting me something so expensive, so I’ll have to say no. Something handmade would be better!"

Lu Tingxiao said casually, "It’s not something so costly, unlike the one you received on set that day, which was truly valuable. I’m just worried that after seeing that, anything else would pale in comparison for you."

Hearing that, Ning Xi immediately facepalmed. "So you also know about that! News really does travel fast… don’t compare yourself with that weirdo, he’s mental!"

"Is that person your boyfriend?" Lu Tingxiao asked.

Ning Xi almost choked on her own saliva. "Cough… no way! What made you think of something as scary as that?"

"Because you seemed really close," Lu Tingxiao said in a slightly despondent voice.

Ning Xi’s head hurt. "My God! How is that close? Is scolding someone for being mental considered being close?"

Lu Tingxiao nodded. "To me it is. You are always so polite with me, and have never been frank or sharp with me."

Ning Xi simply didn't know what to say. Was Big Demon King Lu secretly a masochist? Did he like being treated a little more harshly?

"In short, he has nothing to do with me now! He… he’s just mental, and stupidly likes to throw diamonds at people! If I ever see him again, I’ll definitely throw it right back at him!" Ning Xi said in a relaxed tone, but there was a hint of dread when she was talking about that person.

"Nothing to do with you now, then does that mean there was something there before?" Lu Tingxiao picked up on this point specifically.

Ning Xi coughed. "That… you could maybe say we dated before… if just one day counts…"

For some reason, Ning Xi cared about Li Tingxiao’s opinion of her. She grabbed her hair. "Lu Tingxiao, do you think it’s bad of me to have dated so many guys before?"

Lu Tingxiao looked very serious, and replied as if he was answering an extremely important question: "No, everyone has their own way of living, and they have things they don’t want anyone else to know. People who don’t know the truth have no right to stand on a high pedestal and punish or denounce other people."

Ning Xi’s heart was warmed, and she smiled. "Lu Tingxiao, you sound like my brainless fan, no matter what I say, you’ll think I’m correct, right?"

"Brainless fan?" Lu Tingxiao didn't quite understand what this meant.

"That’s right, it describes those completely irrational fans who support their idols whether they’re right or wrong!"

Lu Tingxiao thought for a while, then murmured, "Mm, that’s very accurate."

Ning Xi: "…"

Ning Xi looked like she was silently struggling to contain some kind of emotion, and after a long beat, she sighed deeply. "Lu Tingxiao… do you know…"

"What?"

"Do you know, you are scarier than the aphrodisiac!" The look on Ning Xi’s face was twisted as she pulled on her collar painfully.
