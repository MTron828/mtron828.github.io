With her phone to her ear, Ning Xi crossed her fingers on her other hand, then said, "We’re at your 2 o’clock." Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Oh…I see you! But why aren’t there any girls? Where're they? Little Junior Sister, what’s wrong with your eye? Are you alright?" Tang Lang walked over, still focused on his objective of picking up chicks and not noticing Ning Xi trying to signal him with her eyes.

Ning Xi sat in a dark corner, and from his point of view, he could only see Ning Xi alone on the sofa. There was no one with her.

What!?

"What’s that on your right?!" He saw a man with gold-framed glasses sitting quietly beside her with a wine glass in his hand and Tang Lang freaked out.

Ning Xi said in a weak voice, "As you can see, it’s First Senior Brother."

"Damn you, Tang Xi! What about the girls!? You betrayed me! You’re so dead!" Tang Lang yelled as he was tried to look for an escape route.

How naive.

As he turned around, he felt pressure on his waist. A silver whip was wrapped around him and he was pulled backwards. He rolled on the floor and crashed into a cold, sinister person.

Tang Lang tried to get the whip off but it was not working. He turned his head around and forced a smile. "Hey, baby, long time no see. I didn't expect such a warm welcome from you, you're making me embarrassed…"

Ning Xi covered her face…

He was still trying to flirt right on the doorstep of death!

Tang Ye said coldly and slowly, "I have something even more welcoming. Want to try?"

Tang Lang’s wrist was about to break, so he cried, "Be gentler, baby! Who’s going to fight with you if you break me!? We still have a long way ahead!"

"Shut up!" Tang Ye held him firmly and they left the bar. Tang Lang walked in front while Tang Ye controlled him from the back; to anyone else, they just seemed like close friends on a night out.

Ning Xi tried to take the opportunity to sneak away but the both of them spoke to her simultaneously.

"Did you forget what I said?" Tang Ye said.

"You bastard, I’ll never forgive you if I die tonight!" Tang Lang yelled.

Ning Xi was speechless.

Ning Xi followed them obediently and mumbled, "What can I do here? The difference is just watching you die and not watching you die…"

"You betrayed me knowing that I’d die?" Tang Lang roared.

Ning Xi was incensed. "Don’t you know how scary he is? If you were in my position, would you have done anything else?"

Tang Lang yelled frustratedly, "I’d surely betray you! I’m not stupid!"

…

Moments later, Tang Ye led him into a quiet alley. It was a dead end and there were high walls on both sides. plus the only way out was blocked by Tang Ye.

What a perfect spot to dispose of someone…

After he got free of the whip, Tang Lang rubbed his wrists sourly. "Come on, Tang Ye, I just beat you that one time. What do you want now?"

Ning Xi’s mouth twitched. Stupid, arrogant fool, mentioning his victory now…

As expected, Tang Ye’s expression darkened and his hand reached for his glasses. "Choose a way to die."

Tang Lang gulped. "Can I die happily?"
