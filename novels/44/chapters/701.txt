Chapter 702: Parental Activity

Ning Xi wore Lu Tingxiao’s windbreaker and wrapped herself in it tightly. As she was about to ask Lu Tingxiao if he was going to go back to his office, she felt a vibration coming from the jacket.

"Lu Tingxiao, your phone is ringing."

Lu Tingxiao took his phone out from the pocket of the jacket, frowning at what he saw.

"What happened? Who’s calling?" Ning Xi asked.

Who was it that could make Lu Tingxiao pull an "I-can’t-handle-this" face? How rare…

"It’s Little Treasure’s teacher," Lu Tingxiao replied.

"Isn’t it school hours? Why would the teacher call now?" Ning Xi questioned.

Lu Tingxiao gave it some thought, then he handed his phone to Ning Xi. "You should take it." 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Obviously, Lu Tingxiao had no idea how to deal with a foreign creature like his son’s teacher,

"Me?" Ning Xi scratched her head. "Okay…I guess it’s better that I pick it up anyway…"

She could not imagine the conversation between Lu Tingxiao and Little Treasure’s teacher. The teacher might speak a lot and he might just reply with a grunt.

It would be even more possible that the teacher got frightened by Lu Tingxiao’s voice…

Ning Xi did not decline and put the call on the speaker for Lu Tingxiao to listen.

"Hello, is this Lu Qingyu’s father?" a female teacher’s voice said.

"Hello, Teacher Wang, I’m Lu Qingyu’s mother." To make things easier, Ning Xi did not give it much thought and just said it as it was.

She did not realize…how intensely Lu Tingxiao was feeling at that moment.

"Did something happen to my kid in school?" Ning Xi asked nervously.

"That’s not it, Madam Lu, I’m just calling to confirm if you and Mr. Lu really do not have time this afternoon. It’d be great even if just one of you can attend! It’d be so pitiful if both of you can’t come!" The teacher sounded disapproving.

For Little Treasure to experience school life like any normal children, no one in the school except the principal knew about Little Treasure’s real identity. Even the teachers were not informed of who he was.

The teachers only knew that this kid was from a well-off family and preferred to be quiet. His parents were busy and did not seem to have a good relationship because ever since the first day of school, they were not seen at school together again.

Ning Xi asked in confusion, "This afternoon? Is there something going on in school?"

"Don’t you know about it?" The teacher sounded surprised.

Ning Xi stared at Lu Tingxiao and he shook his head, signaling that he was unaware as well.

Ning Xi replied, "Both of us are unaware of this. Little Treasure never mentioned it to us."

"He didn’t? How could this be? I even confirmed with him a few times…"

The teacher started to explain, "Here’s the thing. There will be a parental activity today. We’re organizing a masquerade party. I’ve told the children a few days ago to inform their parents, and I even gave them a letter for their parents. A few reminders were given out too. From the name list yesterday, only Lu Qingyu’s parents will be absent. All the other children have at least one parent attending."
