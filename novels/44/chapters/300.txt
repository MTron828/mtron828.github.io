Chapter 301: Nothing A Kiss Can't Fix

As Ning Xi was about to leave, Mother Lu noticed that Father Lu was silent with a cold expression on his face.

Lu Tingxiao stood up and walked towards Little Treasure, then carried him to Ning Xi, "Go send Aunty Xiao Xi off."

Little Treasure nodded and held Ning Xi’s hand.

Ning Xi looked at Lu Tingxiao gratefully, then walked off with her little bun to the courtyard.

Lu Chongshan was about to get up, but was stopped by Mother Lu. She shook her head and said, "Let them be, he’s just sending her off."

Lu Chongshan’s expression was still unhappy, but he gave in anyway.

Ning Xi and Little Treasure walked along a short green pebbled path. It would take them 10 minutes to reach the courtyard gate.

Along the path, Ning Xi kept thinking about words to comfort the little bun, but she was unable to come up with anything.

The little bun looked down, refusing to lift his head up.

After a while, he took out his writing board, and started writing. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The little bun showed Ning Xi the board after he was done with it, on the board it was written—

[Tagore once said: If you love her, let your love surround her like sunlight, and set her free.]

Ning Xi's sadness vanished after she saw what Little Treasure wrote, "Baby, you even know about Tagore! Where did you learn this from?"

Ning Xi squatted down and hugged the little bun tightly and with a heart full of warmth, she told him, "Thank you…I’m really thankful for you…"

She really did not expect Little Treasure to show her something as heart-touching as this. As she was hugging Little Treasure, she saw a familiar shadow closing in.

She quickly kissed the little bun and told him that she would find a chance to visit him again, then she ran away…

Lu Tingxiao felt forlorn when he saw the girl running away swiftly.

Lu Jingli laughed out loud, "Bro, Xiao Xi runs faster than a mutant rabbit when she sees you!"

He then looked at the little bun and said, "It’s really unfair! I understand now that no matter what I say it can never be on par with a kiss from Little Treasure. If there’s something a kiss cannot solve, then two kisses!

"So, bro, why don't you let Little Treasure do his thing and change our parents' mind. Won't it solve the huge issue between you and Xiao Xi?"

"This isn’t the biggest problem between us", Lu Tingxiao replied coldly.

He knew clearly that the suggestion to have Ning Xi resign and become Little Treasure’s tutor was the best compromise the old man could make.

However, his ultimate goal was accomplished, when he saw how much influence Ning Xi had over Little Treasure. He knew that Father Lu would not try to do anything to her.

After Ning Xi left, Lu Chongshan called both sons into his study room.

"Seeing that it’s all for Little Treasure, I will not pursue what happened last night further, but there will be no next time!"

"Father, why are you so troublesome! Just let brother marry her already, then everything will be solved. How awesome would that be?"

Surprisingly, Lu Chongshan did not get angry at Lu Jingli, instead he sighed, "Jingli, if it had been you, I would have agreed to the marriage."

Lu Jingli shivered, "Father, can you stop making such terrifying statements?"

This was just causing him more trouble!
