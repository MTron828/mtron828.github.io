Chapter 59: The Second Male Lead Is A Very Handsome Big Star

Although Ning Xi had proven her acting skills this time, her reputation hadn’t improved in the slightest; because she had performed too well, making people see her as a vixen, they even thought she wasn’t acting, but just portraying herself.

Director Guo was afraid that her mood would be unstable, and went to console her before she left. "Ning Xi, take it easy. Your second male lead will join us next month, there is more to come!"

Ning Xi smiled bitterly. "Director Guo, who on earth is my second male lead? You have been very secretive from the beginning, no hint of it at all. I can understand if you’re keeping it from the media as a gimmick, but can’t you tell even us?"

"I can't say it, what if someone spilled the beans? Anyway, what I can tell you is that the second male lead is a big star!" Guo Qisheng said mysteriously.

Jia Qingqing was passing by when she heard this, and she muttered with a disdainful expression, "It’s just a second male lead, how big can he be? Can he be as famous as king of the movies Zhao Sizhou? Sister Xueluo, don’t you think so?"

Ning Xueluo smiled and didn’t say anything, but it was clear that she also felt that Director Guo was exaggerating.

Ning Xi ignored Jia Qingqing's taunt, and stuck closely behind Guo Qisheng as she started asking questions. "Then is he handsome? You can tell me this, right? In the script, the second male lead is supposed to be so handsome that all the young ladies in the capital pretend to be sick in order to see him!"

She would have quite a number of intimate scenes with the second male lead. Not only would she have to flirt with him, there were also several sex scenes. What was more, they would always be cuddling and kissing, so it was hard for her not to care about this.

"Of course he’s handsome, I’m sure you’ll be very satisfied! When the time comes, if you don’t pass out from the excitement, that would be a surprise!"

"No way, Director Guo, don’t trick me! I’ll take it for real!"

…

Time passed in a flash, and it was now August. She had been living at the Lu residence for two weeks, and her relationship with Little Treasure was getting better and better. Her work on set at the moment was also going pretty smoothly.

Ning Xueluo and Jia Qingqing had formed an alliance, and now and then would play tricks on her. Though she had seen through all of them, it was too tiring being wary of them every day, so she was looking for the right opportunity to defeat them once and for all.

Talking about this, it was strange, but she had the feeling that there was someone on the production team who was helping her behind the scenes. There had been several times when she had missed something, but was given very subtle hints. It was likely that there were people who disliked Jia Qingqing's arrogant and domineering way of doing things. Ning Xi didn't think too much about it.

Right now, the biggest headache for her was going to the airport tonight to meet a certain annoying guy.

The whole of today, while she was on set, that guy had continued calling her to death to remind her.

After finishing work, Ning Xi went back to the Lu residence first because she wanted to get her equipment.

"You’re back. A nice hotpot restaurant opened recently, shall we take Little Treasure out to eat tonight?" Lu Tingxiao was sitting on the sofa reading a newspaper. Seeing she had come back, he asked her the question in a very natural manner, as if he was asking a wife.

Ning Xi was surprised by her thoughts. It was only just over half a month, but she was already used to the way she and Lu Tingxiao got along. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The two of them, along with Little Treasure; it really did feel like they were living as a family of three.

Ning Xi shook her head to get rid of those strange thoughts, and said awkwardly, "I'm afraid I can't tonight. I'm just about to go to the airport to meet someone, and I’ll probably be back very late. Does Little Treasure want to have hotpot? Why don’t you take him out to eat?"

"If you’re not here, he won’t go out with me."

"Cough… alright. Then let’s have it next time!"

Lu Tingxiao put down the newspaper and looked at her with dark, deep eyes. "Meeting a friend?"

"Well, kind of…" Ning Xi nodded a little reluctantly.

"Man or woman?"

"Uh…" Wasn’t this question overstepping a boundary?
