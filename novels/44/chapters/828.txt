Chapter 829: I’ll Do Anything To Sleep With Him For A Night

Ning Xi’s heart melted as she saw the little bun pinching himself. She held the little guy in her arms and cooed, "Hey, my baby, why are you so cute!? You’re not dreaming!"

Father was meeting Mother secretly without him again!

After he noticed his son’s hostile stare, Lu Tingxiao smirked and patted his head. "I’ll leave her to you tonight."

Turning Aunty Xiao Xi to half a mother, and then to one whole mother, the little guy had been spending a lot of time with Ning Xi.

Lu Tingxiao covered the both of them with the sheets. "Sleep earlier, I still have some work to do."

Ning Xi frowned. "This late?"

Lu Tingxiao nodded. "Mmm, I need to earn money for the sake of my wife and kid."

Ning Xi was speechless.

Lu Tingxiao smiled again and kissed her on the forehead. "Go to sleep, I’ll be done soon."

After she put the little bun sleep, Ning Xi was about to turn off the lights, but suddenly the phone buzzed with an incoming call. Ning Xi pressed the button before it rang, then she walked to the balcony quietly.

"Hello?"

"Xiao Xi, where are you? Why are you not home?" Su Yan’s impatient voice demanded.

"How do you know that I’m not home?" Ning Xi raised her eyebrows.

"I’m in front of your apartment," Su Yan replied.

"What’s up?"

"Xiao Xi, where are you now?" Su Yan repeated his question.

"Where do you think I should be right now? Sleeping with another man?" Ning Xi gripped the coat she was wearing to pull it tightly around her and looked at the little bun who was fast asleep. She could not lose her temper even when Su Yan used such a questioning tone with her. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Ning Xi!" Su Yan became serious all of a sudden. "I don’t mean that, I just want to remind you to protect yourself, especially against Lu Tingxiao. You should get away from him. Su Yimo has an ambiguous relationship with him, and rumor has it that the Lu family have picked a fiancè for him. Moreover, he already has a child…"

As the best boyfriend in town, in order to prevent Ning Xueluo misunderstanding, he had tried to avoid Ning Xi as much as possible, but something was wrong with him tonight. He had actually gone to her apartment to wait for her, and even called her to ask her whereabouts…

Ning Xi did not really care about him anymore. "Master Su, I have to remind you again, you’re in no place to mind my business. And about Lu Tingxiao, I would do anything just to sleep with him for a night…it’s much better than marrying someone like you!"

She hung up right afterwards.

Su Yan stared at his phone and his face crumpled.

What did she mean by that? That was the biggest humiliation to a man!

Especially for Ning Xi, someone who had once admired him so much before to say so.

It was true that he was not as wealthy and as powerful as Lu Tingxiao, but he was not a nobody either, yet he could not even score a seat in her heart…
