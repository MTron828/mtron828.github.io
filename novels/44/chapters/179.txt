Chapter 180: Sold To You And Help You Count Money

This felt too much like the emperor sending a state official to help a peasant like her find out who stole her pig…

"Just in case," Lu Tingxiao answered calmly.

When it came to her, no matter was too small.

Ning Xi already didn't want to say anything else, the Big Demon King always had his own extraordinary way of doing things.

"Have you looked through the contract I gave you this morning?"Lu Tingxiao asked.

Ning Xi grabbed her hair. "It’s so thick, I read it until my head was going to burst. Anyway, I skimmed through it, and signed it already, I’ll give it to you later!"

Lu Tingxiao frowned. "Do you trust me that much?"

Ning Xi shrugged. "The worst thing that could happen is that I get sold off to you. If that’s the case, I’ll help you count the money!"

Lu Tingxiao smiled indulgently.

Lu Jingli: "…" Ouch, my dog eyes! I’m going to go blind! It’s impossible to remain in this house any longer!

"If everything goes well, you can report to the company the day after tomorrow. Tomorrow, take the day off and rest at home," Lu Tingxiao said.

"Oh, okay!" Ning Xi nodded.

Lu Jingli wanted to smash his head in when he heard this. The day after tomorrow? Didn’t that mean he only had one day to convince Lin Zhizhi?

This was too inhumane!

It was as if Lu Tingxiao could hear Lu Jingli’s internal complaints. He looked at him and said: "After this, you can take a vacation."

"Awesome! I’m on it!" Lu Jingli was immediately revived.

…

That night, in the VIP ward at the First People’s Republic Hospital in the capital.

Ning Xueluo was staring daggers at the woman on the TV screen.

At the main entrance of the Starlight building, Ning Xi, who had been missing for several days, made an appearance. Not only did she not look weak or haggard, she had shown up looking radiant. She was tightly protected by five bodyguards in black, and her expression was firm as she faced the horde of reporters: " Firstly, I’m not guilty, so there’s no need for me to turn myself in for anything, and I have nothing to be ashamed of; secondly, the incident with Jia Qingqing … Fourthly, want to blacklist me? They can try."

Hearing the last sentence, Ning Xueluo threw the bedside lamp hard at the TV. The screen fizzled and smoked a bit before turning black.

"Chang Li! What is this? Cui Caijing was bad enough, even you can make this kind of low-level mistake! I already told you so many times, we cannot let her terminate her contract!" Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ning Xueluo was the type to blame others whenever things went wrong. Chang Li was already used to it, but her face still darkened. "I warned you a long time ago, with Ning Xi’s traits, if she found herself a powerful and influential sponsor, even I wouldn’t be able to suppress her! Now that you’ve pushed her to this point, we should have expected this result…"

"So was I supposed to do nothing and just watch her reverse the situation? I forked out so much! I paid eight million for nothing!" Ning Xueluo was hysterical, unable to bear setback after setback.

"Xueluo, things are not as bad as you think. Ning Xi’s reputation has already been ruined in this industry. Even a sponsor can’t save her image. Besides, who would dare use an artiste that has been blacklisted by Starlight? This is the end of her career!

"Not only that, think about it, this incident has left a huge impact on the industry. She spent eight million like it was nothing, had bodyguards to protect her, and was picked up in a classy car. Who wouldn’t think that she’s become a mistress? Can the Ning family accept her even after this? Do you think she’ll still be able to return to the upper-class circle?"

Hearing this, Ning Xueluo’s rage finally cooled a little. "With the water army, have you made arrangements yet?"

"Don’t worry, when this happened, I already handled it; we won’t need to lift a finger, and those reporters will definitely depict it the way we want in their articles!" Chang Li said with certainty.
