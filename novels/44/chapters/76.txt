Chapter 77: Want To Kidnap Him Home

Jiang Muye’s interrogative tone made Ning Xi uncomfortable, and she knit her eyebrows together. "So what if I am? So what if I’m not?"

Jiang Muye paced angrily in a circle, then glared at her. "Ning Xi, you really want to get yourself killed. You even dare to play games with Lu Tingxiao, aren't you afraid you’re playing with fire?"

"I’m happy to play with fire, what’s it to you?" Annoyed at Jiang Muye’s words, Ning Xi’s attitude also turned bad to match his.

"You…" Jiang Muye almost got carried away by his anger, and in the end he punched the pillar behind her. "Ning Xi, I’m not trying to scare you, I’m giving you a friendly reminder, otherwise you won't even know how you died when the time comes! Don't you know who Lu Tingxiao is? You think he’s the same as all those fobs you dated in the past?"

Ning Xi rolled her eyes. "Do you think I’m an idiot? Of course I know!" Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

"Then why are you still…"

"Still what? What’s it to you if I’m sleeping with Lu Tingxiao?"

"You…" Jiang Muye slowly calmed down; actually, deep down, he knew that Ning Xi wasn't silly enough to do that, so he tried to curb his anger, and took a deep breath. "Then tell me, what is going on?"

Ning Xi also knew she was being childish, bickering with Jiang Muye. It was just that she had just been too provoked by seeing this person today, and she was so irritated that the smallest thing set her off.

Ning Xi also calmed down, and explained, "I saved Little Treasure previously."

Jiang Muye was a little shocked. "You saved Little Treasure? What happened to Little Treasure?"

"About half a month ago, Lu Jingli took Little Treasure to a bar. In order to escape the noisy crowd, Little Treasure accidentally hid in the storeroom, and the staff locked him in without knowing he was there…"

Jiang Muye gaped slightly. "Lu Jingli took Little Treasure to a bar? That does sound like something that my unreliable second uncle would do. And then? What did that have to do with you?"

"That time, I was preparing to go to the <The World> audition, but Chang Li locked me in the same storeroom to stop me from going…" Ning Xi briefly explained what happened after that.

Jiang Muye patiently listened to the end. "OK, I understand now, you got to know Lu Tingxiao because you saved Little Treasure. Then what should have happened next is the Lu family giving you a huge compensation as thanks, and then GAME OVER, the two of you go your separate ways! Why are you still in touch with Lu Tingxiao? You even moved into his house!"

Ning Xi had omitted the part about Lu Tingxiao wanting to repay her with his body. "Because Little Treasure suffered a shock and I saved him, he’s very reliant on me, so Lu Tingxiao asked me to stay at the Lu residence until Little Treasure’s condition is stable again. I have to be prepared at any time to act like a sedative for Little Treasure, understand?"

Hearing this, the anger in Jiang Muye’s expression finally started to fade, but he still felt a little uneasy. "Are you sure that’s all? So many women want to marry into the Lu family, and right now, you’re in the position with the best chance to do so. Do you really have no designs on him?"

Ning Xi lifted an eyebrow, and said half-jokingly, "If we’re talking about that, I do have designs on Little Treasure; he’s just too cute, I want to kidnap him home to become my little sweetheart!"

Jiang Muye looked at her speechlessly, then touched his forehead. "Anyway, it’s best that you don't think about things you shouldn’t be thinking about, powerful families are not what you think they are!"

Ning Xi laughed coldly. "As if you know what I think about powerful families."

She hated those people in the upper-class circles the most, who only pretended to be civil and wore fake masks…

It hadn’t been easy to leave the Ning family, why would she jump into the fire pit again?
