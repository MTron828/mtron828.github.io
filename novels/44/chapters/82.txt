Chapter 83: Woken Up By Wild Kisses

Late at night, Ning Xi lay in bed with her thoughts flying around.

As if she would bring a guy home — in the case of the guys who had wanted to mess around with her or sleep with her, she’d dragged them into alleys and beaten all of them up.

Especially the married men with the mark of a wedding ring on their fingers, those she beat the hardest until they cried for their mothers.

As for her sex life…

It sounded sad, but the only time she had sex was that night five years ago…

Maybe that experience of her first time really traumatized her; she felt like vomiting whenever she thought about having sex.

She really pissed Lu Tingxiao off tonight, but there was no other way; she would have had to bring it up sooner or later, might as well get it over with now before things got out of control.

It was better that she distance herself first, before he shunned her after her ugly, naked side was exposed.

Because of her restless heart, her night was tangled up in bad dreams. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

In her confused dreams, she could hear different voices in her ears…

"Ning Xi, what makes you think you can fight me? Apart from your blood connection, you are nothing!"

"You still have face to ask about that bastard, what are you trying to do? Don’t tell me you actually planned to give birth and raise him?"

"That kid was premature, and died as soon as he was born, I’ve already dealt with the body!"

"Ning Xi, I’m telling you, from now on, I, Ning Yaohua, no longer acknowledge you as my daughter! You have nothing to do with our Ning family any longer!"

"Xiao Xi, I’m sorry, let’s break up! I won't stop caring about you, I’ll treat you like my own little sister…"

…

She ran and ran with all her might, trying to escape those horrible voices…

She ran to the top of a hospital; below her was an endless abyss which seemed to have some dark attraction, luring her closer, step by step…

At last, she closed her eyes, and jumped…

The moment she fell, she didn't wake up from her dream as she usually did, but instead fell into another surreal dream…

This time it wasn’t a nightmare, but a… a wet dream…

She had had this kind of dreams before, and they were always accompanied by tremendous fear and helplessness, but this time, something seemed different.

One after another, cool, reverent kisses fell on her forehead, her eyes, nose, lips…

She didn't find it disgusting or filthy this time, but instead felt that she was being cherished by the other party, like the most precious treasure.

Who… was he…

Ow, that hurt…

Why did he bite her?

Even though Lu Tingxiao had done his best to restrain himself, in the end he still couldn’t stop himself from entering her room. He knew he shouldn't wake her up, but his actions had unconsciously become a little aggressive.

This woman drove him crazy so easily!

"If I meet a good-looking guy, it’s unavoidable that I’ll bring him back for the night." These words were like a meteorite crashing at high speed, smashing all his reason to dust.

As he kissed the girl’s neck, he could no longer contain the rapid swell of desire in his chest, and he bit down hard, like a beast conquering its prey in the most primitive way…

"Eh… that…"

The instant the taste of blood pervaded the air, he heard the girl’s weak voice…

Lu Tingxiao’s back instantly stiffened, and his whole body felt like a bucket of icy water had been poured over him.

The man still had his head buried in the crook of her neck. Ning Xi had almost screamed at the pain of the bite on her neck, but she could only endure it and awkwardly remind him: "Cough, that… I was just sleeping, not dead asleep, your…your actions were more than enough to wake me up…"

At first, she had wanted to pretend for a bit, but in the end she really couldn’t take it, that bite really hurt!

Meanwhile, Lu Tingxiao’s deep, dark eyes had already blended with the night. He raised his head slowly and locked eyes on her. With one finger lightly caressing her jaw, he spoke as if he was an incubus from hell, "Mm, I woke you… so what?"

As soon as he said that, he grabbed her hands tightly and pushed them above her head, pressed down, and kissed her without hesitation…
