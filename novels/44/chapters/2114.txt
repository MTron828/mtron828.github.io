Chapter 2117: Clouds of Doubt

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After the birthday banquet, Ning Xi invited Tang Lang, Tang Ye, and Feng Xiaoxiao out to treat them to a proper meal.

Well, the meal was just an excuse. The true purpose was to boast that she had given birth to such an adorable child.

Besides, she also needed help from the three of them. She wanted them to check if they could find out who had sent Little Treasure to the Lu family back then.

No one else could probably do it since even Lu Tingxiao could not, but she wanted to feel more hopeful about it.

Afterwards, Ning Xi and Lu Tingxiao got back on their busy schedule. At the same time, they waited for news from Lu Jingli.

There had been some issues with the recovery of the video and the progress had gotten stuck. In addition to Little Treasure being down with a fever lately, Ning Xi was somewhat affected.

She could not rest easy as the matter was still unclear. They still did not know if it was an ally or a foe who had done it and what their intentions were.

How come that person knew that Little Treasure was Lu Tingxiao’s son when even she and Lu Tingxiao had no inkling of it?

Why did that person send Little Treasure to the Lu family?

If that person had just done it out of goodwill, there was no need to hide his or her identity.

There were too many unexplained doubts waiting for an answer.

As Ning Xi was deep in her thoughts, she gently caressed Little Treasure. She became more anxious when she took a glance at the thermometer. “38.5, that’s still a little high.”

Lu Tingxiao put his arm over Ning Xi’s shoulders and comforted her, “Don’t worry. The doctor said that children fall sick easily in this season. It’s just a small matter.”

Ning Xi nodded. “I understand.”

It was difficult for her to not be affected with that matter still unresolved.

Lu Tingxiao sighed when he saw Ning Xi had so much to worry about. He regretted telling her too early. “Jingli told me that the video will be completed in three days.”

Ning Xi took a deep breath. “Mmm.”

Three more days, and everything would be revealed.

However, before they got to see the results from Lu Jingli’s side, something happened to Little Treasure.

What they thought to be just a normal flu and fever did not get better even after several days.

Little Treasure had been in a similar condition before because of psychological trauma, but he had been fine ever since Ning Xi appeared.

However, now that the same situation happened again, his fever was not getting any better.

Nothing worked this time, even with Ning Xi staying by Little Treasure’s side all the time.

Everyone in the room looked worried.

Lu Jingli scratched his head. “That doesn’t make sense. Little Treasure just found out Xiao Xi Xi is his mother and he’s really happy about it. It’s not possible for him to get sick because of psychological reasons!”

Dr. Zhao then said, “I’ve already conducted a thorough check up with Little Treasure. Everything seems normal and nothing’s wrong.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Then, how is his fever not going down? Something must be wrong!” Ning Xi was really anxious. The little guy was breathing rapidly with a red face. He seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness, spending more and more time sleeping in the past few days.

Dr. Zhao thought about it. “Don’t worry so much about it. It’s not uncommon for children to be like this. If the fever still doesn’t go down by tomorrow, bring him to the hospital for another check up again.”

Lu Tingxiao replied, “Okay.”
