Chapter 70: A More Intense Connection?

Who was the hottest young hunk in the entertainment industry at the moment?

No matter who you ask, everyone will give you this name, Jiang Muye!

Jia Qingqing still couldn’t accept the fact until now, and she paced back and forth irritably. "Is this a mistake? Shouldn't Jiang Muye be filming overseas? Even if he’s come home, how could he act as a minor second male lead?"

Ning Xueluo said thoughtfully, "Everyone says that Jiang Muye doesn’t play any other role apart from the male lead. Also, the main investor for this movie is Starlight. Why would he, a Glory World artiste, act in it?"

Jia Qingqing, who had just been thinking how lucky she was that she wouldn't be taken advantage of, was about to go crazy. "Damn it! Why is it like this? How did Ning Xi get so lucky? Jiang Muye should be mine, he’s mine! It’s because she shamelessly stole my role!"

Everyone around her looked at her with sympathy, and weren't surprised by her frenzy.

Because everyone in the entertainment industry knew that Jia Qingqing liked Jiang Muye; she had publicly expressed her affection for him before on Weibo. Even though Jiang Muye paid no attention to her, she still frequently forwarded information related to Jiang Muye on Weibo like a fan.

It took Guo Qisheng a great deal of effort to finally calm the crazy girls down. He couldn’t help teasing, "Muye, look how you’ve captured our girls’ hearts! A handsome boy is really treated so well!" Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Muye went along with the director’s teasing and joked, "Director, didn’t you hear it just now? They only want to sleep with me, so you must protect me!"

"Hahaha… relax, your partner is the goddess of war Meng Changge, she can protect you! That’s right, where’s Ning Xi? She kept hounding me before about who her co-star would be. Why hasn’t she appeared yet?" Guo Qisheng looked around.

Jiang Muye gave a strange half-laugh. "Don’t tell me I scared her away?"

"That really is possible, almost all the girls are your fans, and Ning Xi might be one of them. Perhaps she was surprised at seeing her idol!" Guo Qisheng said with a smile.

As they talked, Ning Xi came over.

Within a short time, the expression on Ning Xi’s face had become impenetrable, and she offered her hand to to the person in front of her with a smile. "Senior Jiang, hello, I’m Ning Xi. I’m honored to be able to work with you."

Although they were the same age, Jiang Muye had started his career earlier and was her senior, so he should be treated with more respect.

"Hello…" Jiang Muye smiled and gently gave her his hand. In the next second, he almost threw her hand away.

This damn girl, she almost crushed his bones.

It was an effort for Jiang Muye to maintain his cool expression, and he pretended to suddenly realize something. "Ah, Ning Xi, it’s you…"

"What? You know each other?" Guo Qisheng was surprised — not just the director, now the rest of the film cast and crew had their eyes fixed on Jiang Muye.

He smiled meaningfully. "Naturally."

Hearing his flirtatious tone and seeing everyone stare at her strangely, Ning Xi was so angry that her hands started shaking. She almost couldn’t control the primal urge to hit him!

Noticing how her face paled with anger, Jiang Muye said slowly, "We worked together before on ‘The Blue Bird’."

"Hmm? Why didn’t Ning Xi mention that?" Guo Qisheng was surprised.

Ning Xi felt like she had just had a narrow escape; her back was drenched in sweat. She answered humbly, "Director Guo, I was just the martial arts stand-in for the first female lead. I never thought that Senior Jiang would remember me."

Guo Qisheng was pleased to hear that. "Oh, who knew the two of you would share such a fate! That’s good, since you’ve worked together before and you know each other, you shouldn’t need too much time to get used to each other. Shall we directly try a more intense connection?"

Ning Xi: "Uh…" Connection? More intense? No, director! They’re not familiar with each other!

Jiang Muye smiled joyfully. "Ok!"

Seeing his evil little canines, Ning Xi really wanted to pull them out with her bare hands.
