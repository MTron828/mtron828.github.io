Chapter 182: Because She No Longer Cared

Lu residence.

After coaxing Little Bun to sleep, Ning Xi applied a facial mask, and was just about to get some beauty sleep, when the screen of her cellphone suddenly started flashing with an incoming.

The call was from Ning Yaohua…

Ning Xi narrowed her eyes, then walked out onto the balcony before picking up the call.

"Hey…"

"What hey! Don't you know how to greet your father? Where are your manners!"

"Are you sure you want to fight with me over this again?"

"How I wish the Ning family didn’t have someone like you, but the Ning blood runs through your veins, and no matter how much I try, that can’t be erased! The dirty things that you do outside, in the end reflects back on our Ning family, and we’re the ones who lose face!" Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"Heh, the dirty things I do… was it something Ning Xueluo said again?"

"Does it have to be from Xueluo? It’s all over the Internet now! They say that you’re poisonous and completely unrepentant, and… and that you’ve even become someone’s mistress. You don’t think it’s shameful, you actually think it’s an honor, and you flaunt it off publicly in front of people!

"Don’t say that I’ve accused you wrongly again, I had people waiting outside your apartment for days, but you never returned. Why don’t you tell me where you’ve been staying these last few days? And where did you get that money from?

"I’m warning you, Ning Xi, this is your last chance, come back at once and apologize to Xueluo! Also, I’ve arranged proper work for you at our Singapore branch. I’ve booked the flight ticket; pack your things and leave the day after tomorrow!"

Heh, he had banished her once five years ago, and five years later he actually wanted to banish her again…

Ning Xi enunciated every word as she spoke: "Chairman Ning, I do have the Ning blood running in my veins, but apart from donating one single sperm, you have done nothing for my upbringing. Even if you lose face, and lose it all the way at the very bottom of the Pacific Ocean, it’s not for you to lecture me, and even less for you to meddle in my life!"

"Ning Xi! You impudent…! Think carefully about the consequences of making me angry! You…"

Ning Xi hung up directly, cutting off the roar from the other end of the line.

This time, she felt unexpectedly peaceful inside; there was no anger, no disappointment, and definitely no sadness.

"Ning Xi…" Suddenly, there was a gentle call from the side.

Ning Xi turned her head, and saw Lu Tingxiao looking at her worriedly from the balcony of his room next door.

Ning Xi was surprised. "Eh, Lu Tingxiao… why are you still awake?"

Lu Tingxiao walked to the edge of his balcony where it was closest to her. "I heard noises on the balcony, so I came out to take a look. Are you alright?"

Ning Xi’s looked the same as she shrugged. "I’m fine, it was Ning Yaohua, and the same old speech every time he calls me. I can even recite what he’s going to say."

Lu Tingxiao wasn’t so good at comforting people, but he reached out over the balcony rail to touch her head gently. "Don’t be sad."

Ning Xi smiled, and under the light of the stars, her countenance was light and serene. "I’m not sad at all. In this world, the only people who can hurt us are the ones we care about. The more you care, the more you get hurt. But now, I won’t get hurt anymore."

Because she no longer cared.

That time at the hospital was the last time she would feel sad because of those people. That wasn’t going to happen anymore.

"Okay! I’m going to bed! I still have to get up early tomorrow morning! Good night!" Ning Xi waved at him.

"Early morning? There’s nothing on tomorrow, you can sleep in."

"I’m waking up early to go grocery shopping!"

"Groceries for what?" Lu Tingxiao didn't understand.

"Of course to cook! Last time, I promised to cook for you and Little Treasure. It kept getting put off, and till now, I still haven't done it yet!"

"You just recovered, there’s no need to rush."

"I’m just going to buy some groceries and cook, it’s nothing tiring, plus it’s just nice that I have time tomorrow, so that’s settled! Oh, right, remember not to eat too much for breakfast, save some space in your stomach, I’ll definitely make you wish you had two of them!"

Looking at the girl’s pleased face, Lu Tingxiao smiled. "Okay."
