Chapter 78: That Scared Of Me Becoming Your Auntie

Jiang Muye felt relieved when he saw Ning Xi’s look of loathing; he understood Ning Xi, and he knew that she hated being tied down the most.

To Ning Xi, the Lu family background was probably as scary as severe floods and fierce beasts…

"OK, you've asked your questions, now it’s my turn." Ning Xi looked at him with her arms crossed.

Jiang Muye shrugged his shoulders. "What do you want to know?"

"Doesn’t Lu Tingxiao only have one younger brother, and no sisters? How are you his nephew?" Ning Xi asked.

Jiang Muye lit a cigarette and slowly answered, "I’m not related by blood to the Lu family, it’s because my grandparents were family friends with them. They died in a car accident when my mother was still young, and the Lu family adopted my mother. So based on order of seniority, I have to call Lu Tingxiao uncle!"

"I see…" Ning Xi said as she stared fixedly at him. "I’m trying to quit smoking, don't tempt me!"

"You’ve been alright with it all this time, why are you quitting?" Jiang Muye knitted his eyebrows together.

"Do I need a reason to quit a bad habit?"

"Who was it once told me, that smoke when you can smoke and drink when you can drink, and whoever wants to quit smoking and drinking is a dumbass…" Jiang Muye stubbed out his cigarette as he made fun of Ning Xi. "I’ve told you whatever I can, is there anything else you want to ask?"

"Of. Course.There. Is!" Ning Xi gritted her teeth as she glared at him. "Tell me honestly, why did you take the Sun Huanqing role? It’s only the second male lead, and not even the type of character you like."

Implying that he was here to deliberately give her trouble!

Jiang Muye answered with an innocent face, "What’s wrong with me playing the second male lead? Who says I can’t? And what’s wrong with me playing Sun Huanqing? I want to expand on my acting and challenge myself, is that not allowed? Isn’t it boring always playing the same type of character? Didn't I do well in the shoot today? You tease me, I tease you, it was so much fun!"

"Fun your head!"

At the very latest, she was going to cry tomorrow…

"That’s it, no more chit-chat, I have to go, I promised Little Treasure we’d have hot pot today." Ning Xi looked anxiously at the time on her phone.

Jiang Muye looked unhappy. "With my uncle, too?"

"Of course, I don’t dare take Little Treasure out alone, what if something happens?"

Hearing this, Jiang Muye got incredibly angry. "So you know, right? Little Treasure is the very life of the entire Lu family, and especially to the two elders, he’s the apple of their eye; if anything happens to him, they might very well bury you alive! Why do you still want to hold this hot potato in your hand?"

Hearing this, Ning Xi became unhappy. "What nonsense are you spouting, what hot potato? My Little Treasure is the cutest!"

Jiang Muye laughed coldly. "Seems to me your head’s been turned by a certain someone’s beauty. He just opens his mouth to ask you for something, you forget everything!" Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ning Xi didn’t have the patience to deal with him. "Whatever…will you stop nagging? How can I dare say no to Big Demon King Lu’s request? Would you? Look at how scared you are now, are you that scared of me becoming your auntie?"

"Aun… tie…" Jiang Muye felt so much unbearable pain at the word "auntie" that he was struck speechless.

"Good boy!" Ning Xi patted his head like a puppy and skipped off after successfully gaining the upper hand.

After grabbing her bag and explaining to the director and everyone else that she had plans for the night and couldn’t join them, Ning Xi took her leave.

Looking at this girl leave in such a hurry, a thick layer of frost formed on Jiang Muye’s face.

‘Severe floods and fierce beasts’ is an idiom for things that are extremely dangerous or threatening.

‘A hot potato in the hand’ is a difficult or troublesome problem.
