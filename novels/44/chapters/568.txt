Chapter 569: Lu Family’s Second Master Lu Jingli

As Lu Tingxiao and the little bun were here, Ning Xi excused herself after finishing the birthday cake.

"Grandfather, it’s late, I need to go back!" Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The elder had no more reason to keep her here, so he held her hand reluctantly and told her, "Remember to come back and visit often!"

"Of course!" Ning Xi nodded.

"You always give me empty promises, I wonder when will be the next time you actually come back! Well, it’s time for you to go now, it’s late already. I’ll ask a driver to send you back!"

"It’s okay, Grandfather, a friend is here to send me back."

"Okay, be careful on the way back!"

"Mmm, goodbye, Grandfather!"

…

After bidding farewell to Grandfather and Ning Tianxin, Ning Xi rushed out with a giddy sort of happiness.

Oh, to see the little bun! Precious little bun!

As she reached the entrance, she almost bumped into Ning Yaohua, Zhuang Lingyu, and Ning Xueluo.

Ning Xueluo went up to her as soon as she saw her. "Sister, are you leaving now?"

"Mmm." Ning Xi grunted impatiently, the little bun was just right in front of her and she was being blocked, irking her greatly.

"Sister, it’s difficult to get a taxi here this late. Why don’t you wait for a little while? I’ll have Bro Yan send you back after the banquet is finished!" Ning Xueluo suggested because she knew that someone would definitely be someone against this idea.

Zhuang Lingyu quickly pulled Ning Xueluo aside. "Xueluo, you silly child, why are you so naive?"

"Mother, it’s really late now, it’d be dangerous for Sister to go back alone!"

Zhuang Lingyu signalled Ning Xueluo not to say another word, then she walked up to Ning Xi with an unkind expression and questioned her in a straightforward manner, "Ning Xi, what are you trying to do?"

Ning Xi calmly crossed her arms and answered slowly, "What do you think I’m trying to do, Madam Ning?"

Zhuang Lingyu sneered at her disdainfully, "All you want is just money, isn’t it? And here I was thinking how diligent you could be. It’s not that you don’t want to join the company, but you’re so ambitious that you only want to join the main company!"

Ning Xi raised her eyebrows. "I want to join the main company?"

"Don’t you dare tell me that you didn’t think about it! Otherwise, why would you do all the things you did today to please your grandfather? Always using all these tricks! Now that you know how difficult it is to survive in the outside world, you want to come back? It’s too late!"

Suddenly, the door of the Maybach opened slowly.

When Zhuang Lingyu noticed the door opening, she totally ignored Ning Xi and pushed her behind, then nudged Ning Xueluo to the front. "Seems like Assistant Cheng is coming down, Xueluo, go!"

Ning Yaohua was astounded to see the one disembarking from the car…was not Cheng Feng…it was…it was the Lu family’s Second Master, Lu Jingli!

Unlike the elusive Lu Tingxiao, Lu Jingli led a high profile life. His face was so well known that no one could ever mistaken it.

The Lu family Second Master was here personally. What an honor!

His heart was racing just thinking about the reactions of the guests, his father’s shock and Ning Yaobang’s jealousy when they all saw Lu Jingli…
