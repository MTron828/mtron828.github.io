Chapter 193: What Am I Going To Do After You’re Gone

Lu Jingli gave his brother a meaningful look, but Lu Tingxiao didn't give him a single glance, and was unsympathetic to Lu Jingli’s ploy when he answered: "Lin Zhizhi."

Lu Jingli: "…" Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

My poor little heart! Didn’t your wife feed me just one rib? And even for that you needed to immediately take revenge!

Hearing this, Ning Xi was astonished. "Lin Zhizhi? Who single-handedly made a plain nobody like Leng Manyun into an international movie star, that Lin Zhizhi? She's my manager? Lord Boss, don’t tell me you opened the back door for me again? Isn't Lin Zhizhi managing Leng Manyun only, and not taking on any new artistes?"

Lu Jingli’s heart was full of unspoken criticism. No kidding, of course he opened the back door!

Because his brother had ordered him to, last night he had flown to H City and spent the whole night persuading her!

"Because Leng Manyun wants to retire," Lu Tingxiao said, as if it was just a coincidence. He didn’t mention the fact that Lin Zhizhi was on leave and had refused to take on new artistes.

Ning Xi was a little alarmed. "So the rumors are true, that Leng Manyun is retiring?"

"Yes, she decided not too long ago." Lu Tingxiao nodded.

Regret was written all over Ning Xi’s face. "Then that’s a real pity. At the peak of her career, she chose to get married and have kids… but she had the best chance of breaking Senior Song Lin’s record of twelves awards to become the first actress to win every major acting award!"

An actress who would win all the major awards, that was also Ning Xi’s ultimate goal!

After saying this, Ning Xi. "But everyone has different goals, it’s not for other people to judge! So, Lin Zhizhi agreed to manage me? I heard that she’s very strict!"

"She did, but only if you pass the test she will set for you later. Only then can she decide on how to develop your training and image," Lu Tingxiao answered.

"Oh, oh, okay, I will do my best!" Hearing Lu Tingxiao mention that she still needed to take a test later, Ning Xi conversely felt a little relieved.

Nearby, Lu Jingli tutted as he listened to their conversation.

It looked like his brother had already set his heart on Ning Xi for life. Every time he helped her, he would rack his brains for an honorable and fair way of doing it. He didn’t give her the slightest pressure, or make her feel indebted to him… he really was infatuated…

Seeing how Ning Xi was starting to trust his brother more with each passing day, he felt that the day he could call her his sister-in-law for real wasn’t that far away anymore.

Great, then he could eat good food all the time after that, hehehe!

At night.

Little Treasure slept early after playing hard all day. It took Ning Xi less than five minutes to put him to bed.

Ning Xi kissed the little guy on the forehead gently, then softly closed the door behind her.

Lu Tingxiao was leaning on the banister outside the door, and looked up when he heard the door shut. "Little Treasure’s asleep?"

"Yup, sound asleep."

"Thank you for today."

"It was nothing, I also had a good time!"

"That was the first time that Little Treasure ate two bowls of rice."Lu Tingxiao looked gratified.

Ning Xi laughed. "I must thank Little Treasure for his support! As long as I’m not busy, I’ll definitely cook lots of good food for him to eat."

Lu Tingxiao frowned, then refused: "No."

"Why not?" Ning Xi didn't understand.

Lu Tingxiao looked at her, and there was a lingering sense of melancholy about his appearance. "If you feed him so well now, what am I going to do after you’re gone?"

What am I going to do after you’re gone…

It sounded like any normal sentence, but the meaning behind it hit her heart hard like a heavy hammer…
