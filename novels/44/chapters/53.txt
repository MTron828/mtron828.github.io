Chapter 54: Sister-in-law

The next morning.

After Ning Xi left, an uneasy Lu Tingxiao gave Lu Jingli a call.

"Send someone on set."

"Bro, are you worried someone’s bullying Sister-in-law? This is something anyone who wants to become a star has to go through, it’ll make her tougher! If she doesn’t experience this for herself, she’ll never be able to stand on her own!" Lu Jingli used the same tone Lu Tingxiao would take when he was lecturing someone.

Lu Tingxiao: "She doesn't need those."— meaning, he would be the one to protect her.

Lu Jingli: "…" Hehe.

Lu Jingli’s heart was desolate at his brother’s biased treatment.

Last year without saying a word you threw me into the mess that was Glory World, and wouldn’t even let anyone help me.

"OK OK, I’ll arrange for someone to be on set to make sure not even a single strand of her hair is harmed!"

"You can take a week off next month," Lu Tingxiao suddenly said.

"Huh… bro, what did you say?" Lu Jingli couldn't believe his ears. "You’re letting me take time off, and it’s even a whole week? You haven’t let me take leave in three years!"

"Don't want it?"

"Want, want, want! Of course I want it! But… why are you suddenly treating me so well?" Lu Jingli didn't understand, and tried to recall their earlier conversation.

Finally, he realized: it was all because of that word — Sister-in-law.

Just because he had called Ning Xi Sister-in-law?

This break was making him both happy and sad.

"Eldest Young Master, Doctor Qin is here." The maid’s voice came from outside the study.

A slim man in a simple suit was standing next to the maid; he had a gentle look and a warm smiles, and seemed a very pleasant person.

Lu Tingxiao hung up the phone and turned to the visitor. "You’re here, have a seat."

Qin Mufeng put his bag down and sat on the sofa. "What is it? Is Little Treasure not feeling well?"

"You can see for yourself, he’s in the kitchen," Lu Tingxiao answered.

"Kitchen?" Qin Mufeng lifted an eyebrow, and then headed to the kitchen.

A moment later, Qin Mufeng came back smiling. "When did Little Treasure pick up juicing as a hobby? Also, he seems happy!&nbsp;Did something happened?"

"Something did happen recently. A few days ago, I was too busy to look after Little Treasure, and then Jingli took him to a bar without my knowing…" Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Tingxiao explained the situation to the doctor simply.

Qin Mufeng’s face changed as he listened to Lu Tingxiao, and in the end, he said happily, "Something good came out of abad situation for Little Treasure! I’ve mentioned before, he’s too uninterested in everything; something that interests or motivates him is good for his recovery.What’s more, this is a living person! You didn’t have that girl stay on as Little Treasure’s nanny or tutor?"

Lu Tingxiao: "Because she is Little Treasure’s future mother."

"Cough cough cough…" Seeing Lu Tingxiao’s expressionless face, Qin Mufeng was astonished. "What did you say? Are you doing this for Little Treaure, or for yourself…"

The cold expression on Lu Tingxiao’s face melted slightly. He looked outthe window and said, "Doctor Qin, I think your previous conclusions were correct."

"You… you’ve fallen in love with this girl?" Qin Mufeng got very excited. "I knew I was right! How could you be an asexual! Tell me more, when you see her, does your heart speed up and your blood boil? Does it make you want to get closer to her and make love to her?"

Lu Tingxiao thought about it for a bit, and said, "That’s basically correct!"
