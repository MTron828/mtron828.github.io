Chapter 208: When Did I Flirt?

Su Yan tumbled downstairs and drove aimlessly on the busy streets.

All he could think about was that day when Ning Xi had covered Ning Xueluo’s wound and called out for help, and how he had rudely pushed her away…

About how Ning Xi had been stubborn at the hospital, refusing to lower her head in front of the unfair accusations from Mr. and Mrs. Ning…

About all those hurtful and accusatory words he had sent to her, word by word, sentence by sentence…

After the incident, he hadn’t considered for even a second to stand by Ning Xi’s side and to listen to her explanation.

He’d said himself that he would treat her like his own little sister even though they were no longer in a relationship, but he had been hurting her all this time.

Xueluo had him, her loving parents, the company, and her fans…

What about Ning Xi? She had been blamed by the whole world and bore everyone’s accusations, bore all the injustice, all by herself.

In the end, it was a complete stranger who had found her justice, not those who claimed to care for her…

Through the car window, he could see Ning Xi answering the reporters’ questions on the shopping mall’s big LED screen with a serious face: "I plan to work hard and make more money for my boss, to thank him for his appreciation and prove him right."

He knew that she wasn’t saying those things for show. She was being sincere. That’s how she was; those who showed her even just a bit of kindness, would in turn be treated with all her heart…

He’d thought that she was the one who had changed, but the truth was, it was him who was no longer the same.

Like crazy, the image of Ning Xi walking out of the hospital gate all by herself kept repeating in his head…

That helpless, lonely view of her back…

His heart hurt like it was being twisted by a knife…

…

At night, VIVI Bar.

This wasn’t a big bar, not in a good location, either, but it was very tastefully decorated. All the industry people went there. It was private enough, so they could relax and have gatherings.

When Ning Xi arrived at the box, Jiang Muye was already there, sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed. There were a few empty wine bottles on the coffee table.

Ning Xi removed her mask and sunglasses. "Hey, hey, hey, started all by yourself?"

Jiang Muye made a disdainful sound. "Didn’t you quit drinking? What’s the point of waiting for you, I would be drinking by myself anyways!"

Ning Xi shrugged. "Ok, forget it, you go on! Ordered me some fresh juice yet?"

"Order my ass! How can you find fresh juice in a bar?" Jiang Muye stared at her impatiently. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Then Ning Xi pressed the service button.

A handsome young man came in and smiled. "Miss, what can I get you?"

Ning Xi took out a big bill, put it in his pocket, and winked. "Handsome, can you go buy me two bottles of juice?"

Stunned, the young man blushed and smiled. "At your service."

Jiang Muye opened his eyes so wide that his eyeballs looked like they were going to fall out. "Ning Xi! Stop it, why do you flirt with all the good looking guys?"

Ning Xi instantly gave him a kick. "Screw you! When did I flirt! A dirty mind makes for dirty vision!"

Jiang Muye dusted the dirt off his pants. "Don’t talk about meaningless things! Get to the point!"

"You started the meaningless talk first!" Ning Xi gave him a contemptuous look and leaned on the back of the sofa, then let out a long sigh. She could no longer hide the exhaustion she had been suppressing all day, and released it all out from between her eyes…
