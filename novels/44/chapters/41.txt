Chapter 42: Goodnight, My Girl

Coughing, Ning Xi stared at Lu Tingxiao angrily like he was a huge bastard.

"Heh." Ning Xi’s cute look made Lu Tingxiao laugh; humor rippling in his eyes. He stubbed out the cigarette and breathed out all the smoke before turning his head and leaning in again to cover her lips.

Ning Xi’s first instinct was to escape, but a hand on her waist held her still, and that low, hoarse voice was in her ear again. "I’ll do it slowly this time."

And then before she knew it, her senses were overwhelmed by fierce, almost violent, tobacco-flavored kisses…

Ning Xi was kissed until she was completely addled and dizzy, as if she was floating on a cloud.

The only thing she was still aware enough to be sure of was that this man was more dangerous than cigarettes.

Bang. The seat back was lowered, and a man’s burning hot body followed her down.

Ning Xi could hardly breathe; she felt her whole body start to fall, deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper, until she hit the bottom of the ocean…

When the person under him stopped moving around, Lu Tingxiao lifted his head to see that she had heartlessly fallen dead asleep, and was even snoring slightly…

Lu Tingxiao’s red eyes turned back into their usual black, and the flaming rage in his heart disappeared completely.

Heh, was he insane? Getting all serious with a drunk…

It’d only been three days.

They’d only known each other for three days.

What was he rushing for?

His attraction to this little girl made no sense.

The first time he had laid his eyes on her, he had the crazy feeling that he had been brought back to life.

Even though they’d never met before, it felt like she was someone he knew from the past.

The moment he picked her up in his arms in the bar storeroom, he had felt complete, as if she had been the one thing that had been missing before in his world.

He wanted her, all of her, for his own, and did not want to wait one second more.

He couldn’t afford to lose her, so waiting was his only option.

Lu Tingxiao grabbed a blanket and a pillow from the back, and adjusted the temperature of the air conditioning before lying down next to her, kissing her gently on the forehead.

"Goodnight, my girl." Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Early next morning.

Ning Xi woke up wrapped in warm arms.

She rubbed her eyes a bit, and through the window above her head, she saw green leaves, bright sunshine streaming in between their gaps to warm her body, the sound of birds singing in her ears…

Hm, where was she?

She looked around and was surprised to find herself sleeping in a car — or more precisely, in Lu Tingxiao’s arms.

Oh my freaking God!

Ning Xi scrambled up, hitting her head on the roof of the car roof hard.

She… Lu Tingxiao… in a car…

Damn it, what the hell happened last night? Why did she have to deal with all this crap right after waking up?

It was hard not to misunderstand what she was seeing!

"What are you thinking?"

Ning Xi bit her finger nervously, her brain spinning, and answered without thinking, "I’m wondering if I really had car sex with the Big Demon King last night… that would be horrifying…"

"Big Demon King… car sex…? If that was really the case, you think you would still have the energy to jump around and imagine ridiculous things the next morning?" The man sounded like he was gnashing his teeth.

"AH—" Only now did Ning Xi realize that Lu Tingxiao was awake. She jumped in surprise, and almost hit her head again. Luckily, Lu Tingxiao anticipated it, and covered her head with his big, strong hand.

"Mister… Mister Lu…"

"Use my name." Lu Tingxiao sounded a bit cold.

She called him "Mister Lu" when she was hiding things from him and "Master Xiao" when she didn't want to piss him off, and he despised both.

Maybe she was imagining things, but after one night, she felt that Lu Tingxiao somehow seemed different…
