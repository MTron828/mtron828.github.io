Chapter 269: The Ice Cold Devil Who Left Angrily

Under the bridge, with lanterns that lit up the surroundings, the wind blew steadily as a young girl kissed a stunned young boy, separated by a mask…

This scene was unexpectedly more beautiful and moving than a direct kiss…

"Cut! Good!" Guo Qisheng came to his senses and called the scene to a stop.

"Not bad, Ning Xi, the way you dealt with this by hiding half of your face actually resulted in a better effect!" Guo Qisheng complimented, while the other crew members also nodded their heads in agreement.

"Director, as long as you’re satisfied, all’s good," said Ning Xi, forcing herself to smile. Dang you! I was just acting out a romantic kiss scene, not a crime scene, yet I had to act till I was physically and mentally exhausted! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Her eyes then involuntarily shifted to a certain direction…

Opposite her, the producer was saying something to Lu Tingxiao while he sat there quietly, like a dull oil painting that had been sitting in a dark corner of an old castle for many years, cold and lonely. Somewhere within his eyes, there was a heart-wrenching sort of loneliness…

Ning Xi was taken aback by that sight, hurriedly turning around to leave.

"Sister Xi, where are you going?"

"The toilet!"

…

Ning Xi quickly sent a text message to Lu Jingli as she walked down the corridor —

[Senior Vice President, what is your brother trying to do???]

Lu Jingli replied her swiftly, "How would I know? He was already acting weird yesterday when he saw the TV play your interview and behind-the-scenes footages. Then, this morning he saw the tabloid news about the both of you playing video games all night, so he immediately postponed a meeting and came here to inspect!"

[Did he let you know what he’s thinking about doing, or if he has any plans?] Ning Xi quickly asked, since she knew that the best strategy to win was to know her enemy!

[It’s not like you don’t know how my brother is like - he would never tell me this kinda things!]

[Then…then was there anything that was odd about him? Try to recall anything!]

[Odd…yes, I think there was one incident! Yesterday, after he finished watching TV, he suddenly glared at a plate of carrots coldly, and then told the butler to never serve this dish! Isn’t that weird? As smart as I am, I can’t seem to understand what this odd behaviour means!]

[…] Ning Xi’s head immediately flashed across the words "harvest the carrot". It looks like Lu Tingxiao had entirely misunderstood her and Jiang Muye!

Ning Xi thought for a while, and typed again, [How’s your brother now? He should be okay, right?]

She had already used up all her brain juices to come with the idea of kissing through a mask…

[No way. The moment you kissed him, the air turned so chilly that I felt like I was ten million meters underground in some thousand year old ice cave.]

[Uhh…]

[Oh, right, little Xi Xi, where are you? Be careful! My brother’s currently not in sight, and I don’t know where he went. My guess is that he’s probably gone to look for you, be careful okay!]

As soon as Ning Xi finished reading that last sentence from Lu Jingli, a silhouette fell from behind her, and someone was forcefully pulling her away.

She felt a hand grabbing her waist and when the world seemed to be spinning around her, she was pushed into the toilet, and she heard the sound of a door closing. Then, she felt her back pressed up roughly against the door and before she could call out in pain, her voice was muffled by a hot, crazy, and hungry mouth…

At that moment, because Ning Xi could barely breathe, the only thought that crossed her mind was —

"Dang you, Lu Jingli! You did this on purpose, didn’t you!"

She refused to say out loud, "You could have warned me earlier!"
