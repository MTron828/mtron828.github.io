Chapter 1153: Rumored Fear Of Wife?

As Zhuang Rongguang heard her, he went along with her. He then looked at Lu Tingxiao nervously. "Pardon my intrusion, Brother-in-law Xi."

Lu Tingxiao’s expression obviously softened when he heard how Zhuang Rongguang addressed him.

Ning Xi let out a sigh of relief when the emergency was settled. She subtly signaled a "good job" sign to Zhuang Rongguang.

Zhuang Rongguang’s expression was indescribable…

After knowing her for so long, she had always acted arrogantly. This was the first time seeing her so afraid of someone.

So, was this the rumored…fear of wife? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Zhuang Rongguang had a lot of plastic bags in his hands. He bought a wide variety of breakfast, more than enough for the five of them to eat.

"Sis, have some buns! I bought your favorite crab meat bun from Restaurant Yi Xing! You can’t get them even if you went and queued up for it. Luckily, the owner recognized me and reserved a box for me!" Zhuang Rongguang then passed Zhuang Keer a colorful little box.

He then went up to Ning Xi. "Sis Xi, I’m not sure about what you like to eat, so I bought some of everything. Just eat whatever you like! I bought these from the famous shops in the city!"

Zhuang Rongguang was really familiar with these sort of things. These were popular items from the renowned restaurants in Imperial and you would not be able to get them if you did not go early enough to queue up for it.

"Thank you!" Ning Xi gave the little bun his favorite shrimp bun, then fed the devil beside her a slice of fried pancake. "Boss, you've probably never tried this before! Take a bite, it’s really delicious!"

She was feeding him personally. Seeing how the girl was treating him, the devil was happy now, so he took a bite.

"How's it? Good?" Ning Xi asked.

"Brother-in-law Xi, while it’s really cheap, that's the best fried pancake in town!"

"Not bad." He did not care where was it from. It tasted good because his wife was feeding him.

While they were having breakfast, Zhuang Rongguang could not take his eyes off Lu Tingxiao. He felt more respectful towards Lu Tingxiao as compared to Ning Xi. He had heard about Lu Tingxiao from before. When he realized that his family might arrange his sister to get married to him, he simply thought that Lu Tingxiao was just a richer businessman.

His perspective was totally changed now. To be able to tame Sis Xi and make her act like a real woman meant he could not be just an ordinary person!

He was really curious… How did he do that?

After breakfast, the siblings prepared to leave as they knew Ning Xi had just returned from work outstation, so they did not want to bother their family time.

Before they left, Zhuang Rongguang went up to Lu Tingxiao when Ning Xi was talking to Zhuang Keer. He asked the question he was pondering about over breakfast, "Well…Brother-in-law Xi…can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"I’m just a little curious. You…how did you manage to handle Sis Xi?" Zhuang Rongguang was like a student awaiting enlightenment.

Lu Tingxiao glanced at the young man as he gave the question some thought.

Zhuang Rongguang waited for his reply patiently.

Lu Tingxiao replied after a while, "With my beauty."

Zhuang Rongguang was speechless.
