Chapter 76: Almighty Sister-in-law!

After Lu Tingxiao had unplugged the cable, Lu Jingli couldn’t hear what Ning Xi was saying, and could only guess that she was asking Lu Tingxiao to go back.

Hearing his bother’s cold answer, he screamed inside: No! Why didn't even Ning Xi getting personally involved work?! Do the heavens really want me to die like this?

Ning Xi’s voice became even gentler. "But I’m worried about taking Little Treasure out by myself. What if something happens? Little Treasure definitely wants you to come too! Come back, ok? Ok?"

Lu Tingxiao was silent for three seconds, before he opened his mouth: "Alright, I’ll be back soon."

Lu Jingli was stunned, and then suddenly felt the radiance of the sun shine down on him — he was in heaven!

Sister-in-law is almighty!

I knew she could do it!

He had thought his brother was really unmoved, but it turned out he was only pretending to be annoyed!

After ending the call, Lu Tingxiao said two words: "Meeting adjourned."

Everyone looked at each other, not daring to believe they’d been let off just like that!

Lu Jingli was so proud of himself: everyone thank me, I’m the one who called our life saver, all of you were saved because of me!

Shortly after the meeting ended, Lu Jingli was surrounded: Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

"Second Young Master, did we hear wrong just now? A woman actually called Boss Lu!

"Who was it? With just a phone call, she got Boss Lu to leave in the middle of a meeting!"

"I know, right? Does Boss Lu actually have someone by his side? Which family’s young miss is it? Second Young Master, tell us everything!"

…

Lu Jingli stared at all of them warily. "What! Asking me who it is, what do you want? Want to hug her thigh now? No way! Only I can hug my future sister-in-law’s thigh! You people don't even think about it!"

Everyone:"…" Couldn’t they hug even just one toe?

…

In the corner of the studio backlot, Ning Xi ended the call feeling relieved.

Finally, it was sorted…

There shouldn't be any more problems after this, right?

It clearly had nothing to do with her, it was really selfless of her to help!

Just as she was about to leave, her phone rang; it was Lu Jingli again.

"Second Young Master, what is the matter now? Wasn’t that enough?"

"No no no, Xiao Xi Xi, your honey trap was just too perfect! It solved the problem beautifully!"

Ning Xi’s face turned black at his words. "What honey trap! That was luring the tiger from his cave! Have some common sense!"

"Whoops, I understand, I understand! That’s it, I’m hanging up. I’ll treat you to food the next time you’re free!"

Ning Xi was speechless as she looked at the disconnected phone.

What did this person understand?

"Ning Xiao Xi, why are you hiding here? Let’s go eat!" She hadn’t noticed Jiang Muye coming over.

Looking around nervously, Ning Xi relaxed after making sure no one had seen him come look for her. Wearily, she leaned on a big, red palace pillar behind her. "I have something on tonight, you guys go, I don't think I can make it."

"What?" Jiang Muye’s face changed after hearing this. "It’s my welcome dinner, and I’m your film partner! You’re actually not coming?"

Ning Xi knitted her eyebrows together. "I know, I know, my fault, but I really have something very important on tonight, I’ll treat you next time, alright?"

"Not alright!" Jiang Muye did not buy her explanation in the slightest, and looked intently at her. "What do you have on that’s so important? Who are you going to see tonight?"

Ning Xi’s voice turned a bit stern. "Who I see is noneof your business."

After she spoke, Jiang Muye’s face immediately turned ugly. "You’re going to see Lu Tingxiao, aren't you?"
