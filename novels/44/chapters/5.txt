Chapter 6: The Sparkling Golden Prince

"President Lu, this…" The bar owner felt helpless; he didn’t understand at all how this situation had come about.

Lu Tingxiao glanced coldly at the female manager’s guilty expression, then looked at the ladder, which was under the skylight in the ceiling, big enough to allow a child through. He could roughly deduce what had happened here. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He waved his hand to dismiss everyone, then walked over and directly picked the woman up in his arms.

In his embrace, the soft, cool scent from before returned, and was even more distinct.

Seeing Lu Tingxiao pick her up, Little Treasure did not stop him, but his expression showed his unwillingness. It appeared as though he was saying that if he wasn’t so small, he’d pick her up himself.

…

In the First People’s Republic Hospital in B City.

By the time Ning Xi woke up, it was already the next morning.

When she opened her eyes, she could see a man sitting on a chair by the window.

His long legs were casually crossed. He wore a slim-fitting tailored suit which emphasized his broad shoulders and slender waist. His white shirt was buttoned all the way up to the collar. He was bathed in sunlight, but his body appeared to be shrouded in an ancient frost. His cool and calm demeanor was like that of an olden day emperor.

The man noticed her observing him, and directed a gaze as deep as the ocean at her. His chilling stare seemed to pierce through her.

The look he gave her felt intrusive, like a sharp surgery knife dissecting her piece by piece; it made her bones shudder.

Ning Xi decided to join the battle, unwilling to lose to this stranger and his uncomfortable gaze. She asked impatiently, "Mister, if I may ask, how did I end up here? Did you see a little boy? He’s four to five years old, doesn’t like to speak, appears white and soft but also a bit dull!"

Dull…

The man raised an eyebrow at her description, then glanced to her right, his voice as cold as his appearance. "Are you talking about Little Treasure?"

Ning Xi quickly followed his line of sight and saw a white, soft little bun lying asleep on the small bed by her side.

"Right! That’s him! His name is Little Treasure?"

Ning Xi let out a sigh of relief and reached over to feel Little Treasure’s forehead. His fever had already subsided.

Before, when she had helped the child escape, she had regretted it a bit. He was just a child, and with a fever, in such a rough place like that wine bar, what would she have done if something had happened to him?

Ning Xi then turned around to face the ice statue. "You are this child’s…?"

As soon as these words left her mouth, Ning Xi realized she didn’t even need to ask.

The man and the child seemed to have come from the same mold. It was apparent that they were father and son.

Still, the ice statue replied, "Father."

"Hi beautiful, you’re awake. I’m Little Treasure’s Second Uncle!"

Abruptly, a large face rushed over towards her, causing her to retreat backward until she saw the man’s face and stopped. "Lu… Lu Jingli?"

He was the Lu Corporation’s second prince, Glory World Entertainment’s boss, but leaving his stunning looks and titles aside, he was a playboy. He had made more scandalous appearances in the media than many celebrities and artistes.

She could never mistaken his face.

If the ice statue was Little Treasure’s father, and Lu Jingli was Little Treasure’s second uncle…

Then wouldn’t the ice statue be Lu Jingli’s older brother, Lu Tingxiao?

Lu Tingxiao was Jing City’s famous God of Fortune. His existence was like a king sans a crown!

Who would have thought the child she had saved was the mysterious illegitimate son of Lu Tingxiao, the sparkling golden prince…
