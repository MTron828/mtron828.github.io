Chapter 1669: I Love You

Ding! Ding!

Ning Xi received two message notifications consecutively.

[Naughty King: Fine, I'll move now! Goodbye!]

[Prince of Koi: Woof!]

Ning Xi chuckled out loud.

After the fireworks ended, Ning Xi sent Little Treasure back to the Lu Residence with Lu Tingxiao.

When they returned to Platinum Palace, Lu Tingxiao suddenly took out a square box covered in black swan feathers from his pocket and gave it to her.

Ning Xi blinked her eyes. "What?"

"A present," Lu Tingxiao replied.

Ning Xi accepted it suspiciously. "It isn't a special day today. Why're you giving me a present?"

"Do I need a reason to?" Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrows, his expression saying, "Do I really need a reason to give you a present?"

Ning Xi grinned. The moment she opened the box she almost went blind. "Oh my God!"

Lu Tingxiao had given her a diamond necklace, which seemed like a new design from TFN called "Starry Night".

As the name went, it was incredibly shiny…

"Uhh…" Ning Xi had an indescribable expression when she saw the sparkling diamond necklace.

"What's wrong?" Lu Tingxiao asked.

"Darling, you… like diamonds?" She was surprised that he had the same interest as a certain someone!

Lu Tingxiao replied casually, "I don't really like diamonds. I just like how they look on you."

Ning Xi felt like Cupid had just shot his arrow through her heart.

Her darling was the best! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Him and his magical words!

Ning Xi closed in gladly and kissed him on the cheek. "Thank you. Put it on for me!"

"Mm-hmm." Lu Tingxiao took the necklace and carefully helped the girl wear it.

"Does it look good?"

Ning Xi mostly wore jades and stones, and rarely diamonds because she was really sick of diamonds, but at the moment, she felt that this necklace was extremely beautiful. No wonder all women loved diamonds!

Lu Tingxiao gently hugged the girl by her waist. There was a tint of darkness in his tone as he comforted firmly, "Xiao Xi, give me a little more time. Believe me and I'll solve everything. The tea party will happen in a few days' time, but Little Treasure bought me enough time to solve everything."

"Mmm, I believe in you!"

Ning Xi expression looked a little troubled. She did not know what Lu Tingxiao was up to and how far he would go. The other party was not an easy opponent. If he were forced into a corner…

That person had saved her life after all. If his life was in danger, she was afraid that she could not just be a bystander anymore…

Lu Tingxiao seemed to be able to see through her. He spoke as he caressed the girl's hair. "The Lus have a house rule. We forbid siblings from hurting each other."

Ning Xi was relieved when she heard that. She understood what Lu Tingxiao meant. He was saying that if it ever reached that point, no matter what the other side did, he would not kill him off.

Not just because of the Lu family house rule, it was probably… because of her… because he was afraid that she would feel troubled…

"Lu Tingxiao, thank you…"

"Mmm?" Lu Tingxiao raised his eyebrows. "You sure that's what you're trying to say?"

Ning Xi smiled and kissed the man on his lower lip. "Okay, it should be… I love you!"
