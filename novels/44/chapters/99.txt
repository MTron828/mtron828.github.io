Chapter 100: Aiming For The Stars

"Jump straight down, quickly! Don’t pretend to be a lady!" Jiang Muye urged her agitatedly.

Ning Xi’s mouth twitched with speechlessness. Placing her hands on the sill, she jumped down from the window.

Jiang Muye immediately dragged her over, spun her around a few times to see if she had any suspicious marks on her, then stared at her with bright eyes. "Did anything happen last night?"

Ning Xi almost passed out from him spinning her round, and she said crossly, "Jiang Muye, what's wrong with you? It’s still early in the morning, shouldn’t you still be asleep? I was sleeping so well, what could have happened to me?"

The veins on Jiang Muye's forehead popped violently. "Ning Xi! Are you a pig? Don't tell me you don’t know how you got back here last night!"

"I really don't know!" Ning Xi had an innocent look on her face.

Jiang Muye took a deep breath as he calmed down. He gnashed his teeth. "How is it you haven’t been sold off when you’re this stupid? Last night it was Lu Tingxiao who personally carried you back here!"

Ning Xi was a bit alarmed to hear that, and immediately argued, "So what? It was definitely because darling Little Treasure was reluctant to wake me up, so he asked his father to carry me back!"

Because it was like that time in the bar. Little Treasure wouldn’t allow anyone to touch her except Lu Tingxiao, so she didn't think it was anything strange. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Muye was half-dead with anger. "Ning Xi, can’t you be a little more careful? Lu Tingxiao obviously has a thing for you, okay?"

Ning Xi sighed deeply, then placed her hands on Jiang Muye's shoulders, and said earnestly, "Brother, this sister is aiming for the stars, I won’t stop for the flowers or grass. Therefore, even if you kneel down to cry and beg me to become your Eldest Auntie, I won’t give you this opportunity, okay? Please stop being delusional, go back, take a shower, and sleep!"

Hearing this, Jiang Muye’s mood became very complicated. He sighed in relief, but at the same time, looked at her with confusion. "Are you really prepared to be unmarried forever? What if you meet someone you like? Miss Little Ning Xi, your way of thinking is dangerous and no good, do you understand? Let me tell you, even though work is important, for a woman, it’s marriage that… ah—"

Ning Xi couldn’t stand it any longer and kicked him. "Jiang Muye, are you done? Did you deliberately come here to pick on me? It looks like it’s been too long since your last beating that your body can’t stand it!"

"You just beat me up the day before yesterday!"

"Obviously I didn’t beat you enough last time. Today, this sister has to beat you into submission. Let’s see if you still dare to spout nonsense all day!" Ning Xi rolled up her sleeves, ready to take action.

Jiang Muye covered his head and fled in terror, but he suddenly looked behind her and said, "Uncle…"

Ning Xi smiled darkly. "Rescue? However hard you yell today, no one will come to rescue you!"

Before Ning Xi’s devil claws dropped down, Jiang Muye shouted, "No… it's my uncle!"

Ning Xi’s back stiffened. She turned her head mechanically, then saw Lu Tingxiao standing against the light, dressed in a tracksuit. Sweat was rolling off his skin; it looked like he had just finished his morning run.

Caught red-handed about to beat his nephew up, Ning Xi racked her brains, then immediately pointed at Jiang Muye and opened her mouth. "Mister Lu, this person came running early in the morning to smash your house window. In the end, I found out, and I was just about to help you beat him up!"

Jiang Muye stared at her. "Shameless…"

"You still dare say you didn't!" Ning Xi spoke in a righteous tone.

Lu Tingxiao reached out a hand to remove a blade of grass in the girl’s hair, then his big palm rubbed her head in a natural gesture. "Don’t be mischievous, go wash up, it’s time for breakfast."

"Yes, right away!" She made a face at Jiang Muye and ran away.

At that moment, Jiang Muye really wanted to grab Ning Xi and yell at her: Once! Twice! Three times! Lu Tingxiao is so obvious, are your titanium alloy dog eyes blind?

In Chinese, the words ‘uncle’ and ‘help’ share the same pinyin (phonetic alphabet), jiu.

This is actually a pun on the actual expression ‘亮瞎我的钛合金狗眼’, which literally translates to ‘so bright it blinds my titanium alloy dog eyes’, and describes something incredibly mind-boggling or shocking.
