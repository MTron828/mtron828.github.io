Chapter 1104: Lu Tingxiao’s Woman

Ning Xi smiled coyly. "It’s exactly as you think it is."

Wang Shengzhe was speechless.

Wang Zhengzhe quickly went to Mo Lingtian. "Damn you, Mo Lingtian! Why didn’t you tell me that that girl is Lu Tingxiao’s woman?"

"Didn’t I tell you earlier?" Mo Lingtian saw that the man was panting and sweating like he had been chased by a beast.

"When?!" Wang Shengzhe almost broke down.

"I told you to not mess with trouble. Think! Just how many people could give you trouble in Imperial? You'd know after some careful deduction," said Mo Lingtian as a matter-of-factly.

Wang Shengzhe freaked out. "Oh no! What should I do?! I actually flirted with Lu Tingxiao’s woman! Should I buy something for her as an apology? She seems to like Spirit’s clothes. Should I buy her a few?"

Mo Lingtian stared at him like he was an idiot. "That girl is the owner of Spirit!"

Wang Shengzhe was once again speechless.

From an outsider's point of view, they had seen Wang Shengzhe flirting with the girl and then, Lu Tingxiao walked over. As it was a corner, everyone could only see Lu Tingxiao’s back as he blocked Ning Xi, so everyone thought Lu Tingxiao had said something to Wang Shengzhe. The supposed Casanova ran away like that corner of the room was haunted…

What exactly did Lu Tingxiao say to him?

Still, there were also people who understood what had happened.

"Hahaha… Wang Shengzhe is really looking for trouble! He even flirted with Lu Tingxiao’s woman!" Ling Fei roared.

Most people did not know what had happened because only a few people who were close to Lu Tingxiao knew the girl’s identity.

Zhao Haisheng held his wife close. "But you can’t blame Wang Shengzhe. Who would’ve thought a girl here would turn out to be Lu Tingxiao’s girlfriend!?"

"Speaking of which, do Lu Tingxiao and Miss Ning plan to keep their relationship hidden?" Ling Fei asked.

"I heard that because of Miss Ning’s career, they can’t publicize their relationship!" Zhao Haisheng said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ling Fei looked at the girl’s direction. "I actually think this girl is pretty nice. If any other female celebrity were to hook up with Lu Tingxiao, she would surely announce it to the whole world. Do you know Su Yimo from Glory World Entertainment? She’s totally unrelated to Lu Tingxiao, but she always calls herself Mrs. Lu or Lu Tingxiao’s true love… But in truth? Lu Tingxiao probably doesn't even know who she is!"

"That’s true! Although we’ve just met twice, she’s pretty nice and quite special, always scaring us with her stunts, hahaha…"

…

At a quiet corner in the garden, Guan Rui was holding a wine glass, looking absent-mindedly in the direction of the pond.

Guan Ziyao looked nervous. "Father…are you sure that this method…is really okay?"

Guan Rui sipped some wine. "There're a lot of government officials among the guests today. There’s even a personnel from the law department and Judge Liang is also here… If she killed someone here, even Lu Tingxiao can't help her! While he might be able to spare her from death, do you think a murderer could ever enter the Lu family?"
