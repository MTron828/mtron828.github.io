Chapter 127: Will Do Whatever You Want

When Ning Xi arrived on set, she was informed that the whole filming schedule had been changed because Jiang Muye had asked for extended leave to attend to family matters.

That guy would chatter constantly about every little thing to her, but this time when such a big thing happened, why hadn’t he said anything to her at all?

Ning Xi immediately called him to ask.

From his tone, Jiang Muye sounded in a very bad mood. "Why would I need to tell you? Don’t you hate me causing you trouble, or being a busybody? Weren’t you eager for me to stay as far away from you as possible? Now you’ve gotten your wish!"

Hearing this, Ning Xi also got angry. "Jiang Muye, why are you in such a temper?"

Jiang Muye felt depressed; he was angry at himself for being too stupid. Finally, he forced himself to calm down as he spoke. "I'm at my dad's company at the moment, and today I’ve been working like a dog, there is definitely no way I’ll be able to get away. If you’re free in the evening, log into the game, I sent you something. Happy birthday!

Also, I sent a few things to your inbox. Go see it for yourself, whether you believe it or not is up to you! That's it! Bye!"

"This guy…" Ning Xi looked helplessly at the phone after he hung up.

At this moment, Guo Qisheng came to let her know, "Ning Xi, you probably know about Muye! We were going to continue to shoot your kissing scene from yesterday, but given the adjustments, we’ll be doing the scene where you fight Ning Xueluo. Later I’ll get someone to give you the new shooting schedule!"

Ning Xi nodded. "Got it, Director!"

After speaking with him, she found a secluded corner under the shade of a tree to read the script.

While she was absorbed in her reading, she heard the sound of footsteps, and out of the corner of her eye, she glimpsed a figure that disgusted her. It was Su Yan who had come over.

Su Yan had sent Ning Xueluo to the set today. Because it was her birthday, Su Yan had specially taken a day off to spend the whole of it accompanying her, and the girls in the production crew were all going crazy with envy.

Ning Xi had no patience to speak to him, and only lifted her gaze as a way of asking him what he wanted.

Su Yan offered her a bottle of iced drink, and asked carefully, "Xiao Xi, will you be coming to Xueluo’s birthday party?"

Ning Xi didn’t take it, and looked at him like he was an idiot. "Are you sure you want to ask me such a brainless question?"

"Xiao Xi, today is also your birthday. If you can come back, we can help you celebrate! I’ve already spoken to Uncle and Auntie, they’ve already agreed!"

Ning Xi rolled her eyes. "Thank you so much for helping me celebrate my birthday in passing!"

Su Yan frowned slightly and heaved a deep sigh. "Ning Xi, I really hardly recognize you anymore. When will you return to the kind and considerate Ning Xi… back then it was all my fault. If it wasn't for me, Xueluo wouldn't have done that. If you want to blame someone, blame me, Xueluo’s innocent. She has been living with the guilt all these years, and her biggest wish is to receive your blessing. I really hope you will be able to come!"

"Guilt?" Every time Ning Xi spoke to Su Yan, she felt like she was listening to a joke. "Guilty of snatching my identity? Guilty of stealing my parents? Guilty of sleeping with my man? Then she has a lot of guilt! Also, don't mention the word ‘kind’ to me. Back then I wasn’t kind, but stupid!" Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Su Yan’s face was unsightly, and then he said firmly, "Xiao Xi, as long as you can forgive Xueluo, I’ll do whatever you want, except for testifying in court!"

"Are you sure?" Ning Xi raised an eyebrow.

"Yes." Su Yan nodded.
