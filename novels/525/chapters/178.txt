Chapter 179 179-The Rules

"Thank you, Uncle Master!"

Howard quickly took the book, expressing his gratitude, and then immediately started examining its properties.

"!!!"

"Another physical-type skill, are they trying to steer me towards the path of a melee magus?"

Howard couldn't help but roll his eyes.

However, upon further thought, he realized that, after all, it was an S-level skill ‚Äì rare and valuable.¬†

Plus, his own physical strength was quite formidable, so even utilizing this skill would yield impressive results. Why disdain it?

With this in mind, Howard eagerly learned the Lotus Palm skill.

Rick and Sickly Sprout, noticing this, nodded their heads with smiles on their faces.

Seeing his gift being readily used made him very happy.¬†

Had Howard discarded the gift, Sickly Sprout might not have broken ties with Rick, but their future interactions would certainly have been limited.

At that moment, numerous awakened also reached the base of the stone platform.

Sensing the arrival of the awakened, Glutton flashed onto the top of the platform and said with a light laugh, "Gentlemen, if any of you can climb this stone platform on your own merit, you'll be qualified to join the contention for the Starry River Map."

"Really?"

"Just a stone platform, watch me!"

"Here I go!"

Upon hearing Glutton's words, an awakened couldn't help but take a few steps back, then charged forward with a burst of speed, attempting to rapidly scale the slippery stone wall.

However, the stone wall was exceptionally slick, and coupled with its height of over thirty yards, the awakened barely made it halfway up before slipping, tumbling back down.

"Ha ha ha!"

Laughter erupted instantaneously.

At level 50, though the awakened hadn't mastered the ability to fly, they possessed methods for brief aerial suspension.¬†

Normally, a tall platform like this wouldn't pose a barrier to them.

This was precisely why they laughed when they saw the awakened fall.

"This..."

The fallen awakened, hearing the mockery, turned red with embarrassment and explained, "It's not my fault; that stone wall is just too slippery!"

Despite their laughter, the other awakened didn't underestimate the challenge of the stone wall.

If it were that simple, Rick and the others would never have chosen this location for the contest.

Consequently, the numerous awakened began to display their unique abilities, attempting to ascend the stone wall.

However, while the idea was appealing, the reality proved to be much harsher.Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

Almost every awakened who tried to force their way up the wall fell back down when they reached about halfway or three-quarters of the way up.

The stone platform had been cleverly rigged by Rick and his team.¬†

Only those who could ascend it using their skills without touching the wall, or whose speed was so fast that it negated Rick's restrictions, could reach the top.

After witnessing many failed attempts, the crowd exchanged looks of uncertainty, with no one daring to rashly step forward.

At this moment, a woman wearing an eight-eyed devil mask suddenly let out a coquettish laugh, "Since everyone seems reluctant to reveal their true abilities, allow me, a mere woman, to be the first to climb this stone platform."

As her words fell, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask stamped her right foot on the ground.¬†

Surprisingly, she spun and soared into the air, covering a distance of nearly five yards in an instant.¬†

The next moment, a chain whirled out of her hand, continuously swinging through the air.

With a rapid series of clangs, the chain collided against the stone wall, the force of the impacts astonishingly allowing the woman to climb upward step by step.

In just about ten breaths' time, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask retracted her chain and somersaulted gracefully, landing steadily on the stone platform.

"What a splendid display of skill!"

"Hisss... The way she handled that chain was incredible!"

As this scene unfolded, countless awakened expressed their amazement.

Even Glutton showed a look of surprise, followed by a nod of satisfaction.

Simultaneously, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask also noticed Howard and nodded slightly towards him as a gesture of goodwill.

As the saying goes, one does not strike a smiling face.¬†

Howard likewise responded to the woman with a friendly smile.

After the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask successfully climbed onto the stone platform, other awakened no longer concealed their strength and followed suit in ascending the platform.

At this moment, the difference between top-tier forces and ordinary awakened became evident.

Despite the levels of these awakened not being much lower than those from the top forces, the skills they had mastered and the equipment they possessed were in a completely different league!

For instance, a girl from Black Tortoise City simply summoned a shadow of a turtle and floated up to the stone platform on it.

Then there was Corinna Maya, who only had to punch the ground and used the immense recoil to perform a triple jump up onto the stone platform.

Examples like these were numerous.

In just less than half a quarter of an hour, the stone platform was already crowded with hundreds of awakened.

Various discussions and conversations started to emerge.

Earlier, everyone was scattered and did not recognize each other's identities.¬†

Now, with most of the ordinary awakened left below the stone platform, these awakened from various powerful factions could easily recognize one another.

"So it's the young lady from Black Tortoise City, a pleasure to meet you!"

"Cousin, I didn't expect that you would lead the team from White Tiger City here."

"The chief disciple of Trifold Sect? I heard you were cultivating an SS-level skill. Have you succeeded and come to test its power?"

"The young lord from House Benos?"

"The captain of the guard from Solono City, known as Ironman Nars?"

Hearing these conversations, Howard immediately realized that those who had come here were likely from various cities within the Alliance, or significant figures from other powerful factions.

He also finally understood why Rick and his group, though they could have directly given him the Starry River Map, chose to go through this process.¬†

Firstly, it was to provide him with experience, and secondly, to give a justification to the members of the Alliance.

If they were defeated by Howard, they would have no grounds for complaint. Otherwise, Rick and the others could even face punishment from the Alliance.

Being Rick's disciple, simply handing over the Starry River Map without a battle could indeed seem like favoritism.

Understanding all this, Howard felt even more impassioned and eager for the battle ahead.

What did it matter if he faced awakened from various cities and factions?

As long as the level difference wasn't too great, Howard was confident in his ability to prevail.

Moreover, he didn't plan to rush into the fray immediately.¬†

The competition format, as Rick had explained, was about who could last till the end to be declared the winner.

Howard intended to observe and wait, only making his move when there was one person left.

And what if everyone else thought the same and no one was willing to step forward?

Then Howard would be even happier!

If no one else stepped up, Rick could directly hand the Starry River Map to Howard.¬†

Any complaints could be dismissed by Rick simply stating that no one else was willing to fight for it.

Therefore, Howard was sure to gain an advantage!

After waiting a moment longer, Glutton glanced over the people on the stone platform and said with a smile, "It seems no one else can make it up here. Well, then it's time to get down to business!"

As he spoke, another voice rang out: "Who says no one else can come up?"

Accompanied by the sound of slicing through the air, Sword Seven, standing on a giant sword, flew directly into the sky.¬†

He then turned his gaze towards Howard and smiled.

Seeing Sword Seven safe and sound, Howard breathed a sigh of relief, simultaneously astonished by his Sword Art.

Riding a sword blade through the air was just too cool!

"Ah, a natural sword body?" Glutton observed Sword Seven closely and laughed, "If an old friend of mine saw you, he would be very pleased."

"Alright, now that everyone is here, the contest for the Starry River Map can officially begin!" Glutton scanned the assembled awakened and continued,¬†

"Everyone who has come here is below Level 60 and possesses exceptional abilities. With your talents, whoever obtains the Starry River Map can contribute significantly to our Alliance. I hope you will all strive hard for it!"

"The rule is simple. See the arena in the center? Whoever can remain standing there at the end will claim the Starry River Map!"
