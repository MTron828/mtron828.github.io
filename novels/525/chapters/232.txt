Chapter 233 Chapter233-Howard's Calculations

After running a great distance, the trio finally dared to stop, confident that Kaedwyn wouldn't be able to catch up.

During their earlier looting, Howard had found a decent knife, which he decided to use temporarily as a weapon.

After traveling for a while, they came across an inn situated in a desolate mountainous area, which struck them as odd.

The presence of a household in such a remote location was surprising enough, let alone an inn conducting business where there seemed to be no potential customers.

Yet, the inn's signboard clearly indicated it was open for business.

"Howard, what do you think?" Kellman and Tina both turned to him for guidance.

After several nights of continuous battles, they were all exhausted.

Although they had rested briefly, none had managed a good night's sleep.

If this inn was safe, it would be an ideal place to recuperate, especially since they didn't know what dangers lay ahead.

"Let's go in and take a look. If something's off, watch my cues and be ready to fight," Howard suggested.

Kellman and Tina nodded solemnly, trusting Howard's caution.

Entering the inn, they found a simple and unassuming interior.

It was deserted except for the innkeeper, an elderly man with white hair.

The old man seemed slightly taken aback to see guests, as if he himself hadn't expected anyone to visit such a remote location.

He chuckled and came over to greet them.

"Guests, would you like to stay?" he asked.

"Yes," Howard replied, his eyes carefully scanning the old man and the inn, searching for anything amiss.

"The cost for a night's stay is one gold coin each. What do you think?" the innkeeper inquired.

"One gold coin!" Tina exclaimed in surprise.

Having previously managed logistics for the Frostwolf Mercenaries, she was well-acquainted with the pricing of various commodities.

A single gold coin was far too much, enough to cover not just one, but a hundred nights of accommodation.

She and Kellman finally understood why this inn, located in such a remote mountainous area, hadn't gone out of business ‚Äì it was undoubtedly a rip-off.

"I think we should..." Tina was about to suggest they leave when Howard unexpectedly chuckled and handed over three gold coins to the innkeeper.

From his time with the Frost Raven Tribe, Howard had acquired a whole bag of them, so this small expense was insignificant.

Compared to the elusive value of money in the future, a good night's sleep was his current priority.

Given Howard's usual cautious nature, Tina and Kellman didn't object to his decision.

However, Kellman still harbored some doubts and whispered to Howard, "If we stay here, what if Kaedwyn catches up with us?"

Only then did Howard realize this oversight.

Although the mountain paths were intricate and Kaedwyn might not find this particular route, the possibility remained.

Kaedwyn had stationed people at every junction leading to Holy Light City, indicating his thorough knowledge of the area's geography.

It was plausible he knew of this inn and might decide to take a chance on it.

With this in mind, Howard changed his decision and said to the innkeeper, "Keep the three gold coins, but we won't be staying. Just prepare us some food for a hearty meal."

Upon hearing their request, the innkeeper was momentarily taken aback before smiling and responding, "Of course, no problem. My guests, please wait a moment."

Though they had decided not to stay the night, having a meal was perfectly acceptable.

Even if Kaedwyn was highly capable, it would take him some time to find this place.

"We'll leave right after eating," Howard stated as he sat down.

Kellman and Tina nodded and took their seats.

Food was essential, especially after a day of eating only raw meat.

Now that they had the chance to enjoy cooked food, they certainly weren't going to pass it up.

Once the meal was served and Kellman and Tina were about to dig in, Howard's gaze fixed on the old man who had brought the food.

"You eat first," he said.

The innkeeper, along with Kellman and Tina, immediately understood Howard's intention.

He was testing for poison again, this time directly with the person serving the meal.

Howard's caution wasn't unfounded, especially since having such an inn in a remote mountain area was suspicious.

The food had to be ensured poison-free, especially after Howard had openly displayed wealth while paying.

The innkeeper laughed, "You worry too much, guest. I value my reputation in business. Although my inn is located in a secluded place, I do have customers. If I had no credibility, how could I sustain my business?"

"Enough talk, eat," Howard insisted firmly, leaving no room for negotiation.

Under the watchful eyes of the trio, the innkeeper reluctantly sampled each dish.

After seeing the innkeeper eat, Kellman and Tina were about to start their meal but were stopped by Howard again.

He pulled out a rat from his pocket, which he had caught in the mountains the day before, knowing it would come in handy eventually.

Kellman's face soured immediately, and Tina also glared at Howard in annoyance.

If Howard had a rat for testing poison, why bother the innkeeper in the first place?

And even after the innkeeper had tasted the food, Howard still wasn't convinced?

Given the innkeeper's experience, Howard had every reason to suspect he might have taken an antidote beforehand, so the risk of food being poisoned couldn't be dismissed.

Carefully, Howard used the rat to meticulously retest each dish for poison.

Finally, when the results indicated the food was safe, Howard felt relieved to enjoy the meal.

However, the innkeeper, an elderly man, was visibly offended.

He had never encountered such a distrustful young man.

Wasn't this level of suspicion a direct insult to him, especially when he prided himself on his reputation?

"Sorry about that," Tina apologized with a smile, understanding that Howard's actions must have hurt the innkeeper's feelings.

Despite running what seemed to be a 'rip-off' inn, Tina could empathize with the old man's situation.

After all, what was this place?

A desolate wilderness where even a hearty meal was a rarity and a challenge to procure.

Given the dangers and the remoteness of the location, charging a premium seemed somewhat justifiable.

"It's alright," the innkeeper chuckled, though his words were superficial.

Deep down, he marked Howard in his memory, unlikely to forget him for a long time.

This young man had left an indelibly deep impression on him.

The innkeeper, with a respectful demeanor, said, "My guests, you really can stay at the inn. I'm aware of a bandit group led by Kaedwyn in the vicinity. You must be worried about encountering them, right?"

He was keen on offering assistance to Howard and his companions, recognizing their formidable abilities.

It wasn't hard to guess; few who ventured to his remote establishment were ordinary folk. Geett the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After saying this, the innkeeper couldn't help but glance at Howard, expecting him to be reluctant to agree.

But, to his surprise, Howard responded, "Alright, we'll stay."

Kellman and Tina were taken aback.

Why this sudden change? This wasn't like Howard.

Tina looked at Howard with a hint of unfamiliarity; this must have been one of many times she had to reassess her understanding of him.

When Howard elaborated on his conditions, Kellman and Tina grasped his plan.

"I can give you fifty gold coins, but only when we leave tomorrow. Until then, you need to ensure our safety. If Kaedwyn shows up, just tell him we aren't here."

Kellman and Tina looked at Howard with renewed respect, and so did the innkeeper.

However, the risk was significant ‚Äì if the innkeeper decided to betray them to Kaedwyn, he could earn a substantial reward.

Howard must have considered this, so why take the risk?

A meaningful smile appeared on Howard's lips; he had discovered a secret.

The innkeeper was more than happy to agree, as either way, he stood to make a substantial profit.

In the large inn, he was the only staff member and arranged three separate rooms for Howard, Kellman, and Tina.

Afterwards, the trio gathered together.

"Why did you agree to stay at the inn?" Kellman couldn't help but ask Howard.

"Didn't you notice that the innkeeper bears a resemblance to Kaedwyn?" Howard replied.

At his words, both Kellman and Tina were shocked, then fearful.

"Now that you mention it, he does look a bit like him, but doesn't that make it more dangerous?"

Kellman was puzzled, trying to understand Howard's plan.

Howard looked out the window.

"It's almost night."

"So what?" Kellman asked.

"I remember you telling me," Howard began, "that at night, the stench of blood from battles attracts Night Demons."

"So even if Kaedwyn gets the message, he won't come back tonight. He'll most likely ambush us tomorrow."

"But that still leaves us in danger!" Tina stood up, wondering if Howard had lost his mind.

She reached out to touch his forehead, checking if he was feverish.

"You're not running a fever."

Howard caught her hand, causing Tina to blush and quickly withdraw it.

Howard continued, "How about making a big profit?"

His comment only added to Kellman and Tina's confusion.

In the midst of such peril, how could they possibly think about making a profit?
