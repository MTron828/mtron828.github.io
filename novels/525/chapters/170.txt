Chapter 171 171-Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess

"Soul Fusion!"

In an instant, Howard shouted, and a dazzling golden light burst forth from within him, radiating brilliantly.

As the dazzling golden light burst forth, the frost encasing Cameron shattered.¬†

Just as he was about to react, he saw a golden Oriental Divine Dragon emerging from within Howard, his face revealing a look of surprise: "What is this? A flying serpent? No, it can't be, serpents don't have four legs! And its scales, they're just like dragon scales!"

Cameron, having never ventured to other regions of the Alliance, showed his lack of worldly knowledge.¬†

He was taken aback by the sight of the Oriental Divine Dragon, causing his offensive momentum to falter momentarily.

And in that brief pause, he lost his chance.

With a mighty roar, the sound of the dragon resonating powerfully, Howard's Soul Fusion skill was fully activated without any chance of interruption.

As the golden light dissipated, Cameron swept his gaze around, only to be astonished to find that the golden brilliance wasn't fading away but transforming into a liquid-like substance, gradually flowing into Howard's body.

Simultaneously, golden armor began to spread upwards from Howard's feet.¬†

The patterns on the armor, indistinguishable from dragon scales, exuded a terrifying aura.

Even Cameron, with his formidable strength, felt a sense of oppression in that instant, as if being targeted by some peerless ferocious beast.¬†

A chill ran down his spine and his heart quivered with unease.

The clanging sound lasted only for two breaths.¬†

When the sound ceased, Howard was fully clad in golden armor, appearing both regal and powerful, inspiring an almost instinctive urge in onlookers to bow in reverence.

"Absurd! How can one's skills increase so drastically in such a short time?"

Feeling Howard's aura not much weaker than his own, Cameron was profoundly shocked, hardly able to believe what he was witnessing.¬†

His eyes turned fierce, and he swept his spear horizontally, the fiery glow erupting as he thrust it towards Howard.

Boom-

Ting!

However, when Cameron's spear struck Howard, it clanged as if hitting steel, the spear itself trembling violently.

And the bursting flames?

They scorched against the dragon-scale-like armor without any effect!

"Impossible!"

His pupils dilating, Cameron became even more ferocious, roaring as he leaped forward.¬†

He swung his spear repeatedly, the roaring flames transforming into a giant bear, imbued with astonishing strength, and then smashed towards Howard's head.

Clearly, Cameron was also unleashing a skill.

At the same time, Howard, impacted by the immense force, finally reacted.¬†

There was no way he would use his body to withstand Cameron's skill.¬†

He immediately sidestepped, clenched his right fist, bent his waist, and as Cameron neared him, he swiftly stood up and delivered an uppercut right into Cameron's stomach.

Bang!

Struck fiercely, Cameron grunted, unable to resist being sent flying and spiraling towards the ground.

Witnessing this, Howard couldn't help but clench his fist, filled with immense excitement.

The last time he used the Soul Fusion skill, it was the Oriental Divine Dragon controlling the actions, and he couldn't even feel the surge of power.

This time, executing it personally and suddenly wielding such immense power naturally stirred his emotions profoundly.

However, Howard also realized that the state of Soul Fusion not only consumed MP at an astonishing rate but was also linked to his own HP.

Cameron's recent attack seemed to have no effect on him, but Howard noticed a slight decrease in the resilience of the Soul Fusion state.

Clearly, in that state, sustaining a certain amount of damage would also cause an exit from that mode.

"Crack!"

While Howard was pondering the mechanics of Soul Fusion, the group of cavalry nearby finally broke free from their frozen state and quickly charged toward him on their horses.

After Cameron landed, he sprang up with a kip-up, but instead of launching another rash attack, he scrutinized Howard with a piercing gaze.

Having taken a punch to the stomach, Cameron was well aware of how terrifying Howard's attack power was at the moment.F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He could probably deduce that Howard's current state couldn't last very long, so naturally, he refrained from attacking.¬†

His eyes turning icy, he bellowed, "Form up, attack the enemy!"

As his command echoed, the hundred or so cavalry immediately formed a neat square formation.¬†

They raised their long spears together, shouting loudly in unison.

In an instant, a chilling aura of imminent slaughter emerged, swiftly converging from all directions.

A blood-red tiger phantom suddenly coalesced above the cavalry.

"Is this... War Formation Magic from the military?"

Seeing this, a chill ran down Howard's spine.

In this world, high-level powerhouses are ultimately a minority.¬†

Relying solely on these individuals would be insufficient to repel the countless demons and Alien monsters.

The key to humanity's success lies in the existence of armies.

While many soldiers may not be of high level individually, when they come together and execute War Formation Magic, the power they unleash can rival that of some peerless warriors.

However, War Formation Magic has its limitations.

It requires the practitioners to cultivate the same techniques.

Furthermore, the power of War Formation Magic is correlated with the number of people involved.

With a small number of people, War Formation Magic cannot exhibit much effect.

Of course, this applies in the context of a battlefield.

At this moment, considering Howard's current state, coupled with Cameron watching like a tiger ready to pounce, even a War Formation of just twenty people - the minimum scale - poses a substantial challenge to Howard, let alone one composed of a hundred.

"Roar!"

The roar echoed as the blood-red tiger phantom, controlled by the multitude of soldiers, leaped forward.¬†

Swinging its massive paws and baring its sharp fangs, it charged directly at Howard.

Cameron, too, fiercely threw his spear, closely following the phantom tiger.

Seeing this, Howard understood that he must eliminate those soldiers.

Otherwise, Cameron would be difficult to deal with.

Within the War Formation, the strength displayed by those generals is unbelievably formidable.

Taking a deep breath, Howard, just before the tiger phantom could strike, executed his skill - Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess!

Almost instantaneously with the casting of the skill, Howard's form began to blur and fade into translucence.

The next moment, his figure completely vanished from everyone's sight.

The attack of the tiger phantom missed its mark, hitting nothing but air.

"Huh?!"

"What's happening?"

"Where did he go?"

Howard's sudden disappearance astonished the soldiers, and even Cameron's brow furrowed in perplexity.

However, Cameron didn't just stand idly by. A fiery red glint flashed in his eyes as he slowly scanned the vicinity.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh -

Simultaneously, the sound of a gentle wind arose, immediately alerting Cameron, who was in a heightened state of tension.

What surprised him even more was that the sound of the wind gradually grew louder.

At the spot where Howard had vanished, a small azure whirlwind appeared, spinning continuously.

With each rotation, the size of the azure whirlwind grew, expanding to the height of a person in just five or six breaths.

Not only did its size increase, but the strength contained within the whirlwind also multiplied geometrically.

"This is bad, it's an Anemo skill!"

"Quick, retreat!"

In an instant, Cameron reacted, urgently signaling his soldiers to withdraw.

While he himself might withstand Howard's skill, it didn't mean that the group of soldiers could.

After all, those soldiers might have their levels, but they lacked high-tier equipment.¬†

Their attributes couldn't even match a normal state Howard, let alone Howard under the Soul Fusion state!

However, Cameron's warning came too late!

The azure whirlwind expanded once again, now towering to a height of ten feet.¬†

Spinning continuously, it unleashed an intense pulling force, instantly sucking in the soldiers at the forefront of the War Formation into the air, and then engulfing them within the whirlwind.

With the soldiers pulled into the whirlwind, the War Formation was also disrupted.

At this moment, the soldiers all displayed expressions of terror.

To them, the whirlwind was like a tornado!

Meanwhile, after more than ten seconds of brewing, the Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess was finally fully unleashed.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Howard's physical form had transformed into a tornado, spinning rapidly and charging towards the group of soldiers.

The howling wind turned into wind blades, rampaging through the air.

Thwack!

As the wind blades struck the soldiers, even their armor shattered. Before they had a chance to flee, the wind blades slashed at their limbs.

In an instant, screams filled the air, blood splattered, and their limbs were severed!

Even Cameron was not spared.¬†

Despite his attributes still being higher than Howard's, under the onslaught of the SSS-level skill, his clothing and skin were torn apart.

Had it not been for Cameron's decisive action, summoning a flame to envelop his entire body at the first instance, he too might have had his limbs severed by the wind blades!

However, Howard still wore a smile.

He could clearly see the damage numbers appearing above Cameron's head, which were no longer negligible.

"-892!"

"-902!"

"-917!"
