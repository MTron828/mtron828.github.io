Chapter 175 175-Seizing the Treasure

Startled by Glutton's words, Howard's heart skipped a beat. 

He scanned his surroundings, but couldn't spot Glutton anywhere.

"Tsk, tsk, kid, no need to look for me. Just get ready to seize the Starry River Map!"

The voice by his ear startled Howard even more. 

How could Glutton speak so precisely to him amidst the crowd?

Moreover, Howard was panicking. 

Even if those level 70 awakened were injured by Glutton, the moment Howard grabbed the Starry River Map, their desperate counterattack would be more than he could handle. 

He could only hold out for so long.

Once they regained some strength, Howard would be no match for them.

"Don't worry, we won't let you face danger. Just take the Starry River Map and get some distance away from here. Then we'll have a chance to intervene. Otherwise, acting now might provoke the major powers' dissatisfaction."

"Ah, don't be fooled by the Alliance's grandeur. Behind the scenes, it's tough managing the balance among various powers!"

Glutton's words completely astonished Howard. How could he hear Howard's inner thoughts?

"The ability to communicate precisely and hear one's inner thoughts is a power attained after touching the Power of Law. So, in the future, when you encounter strong beings around level 95, be careful with your thoughts, or you'll have nowhere to hide. Of course, if your spirit is focused enough, you can avoid such mental probing."

"Alright, get ready. The others will guide you along the way!"

With these words, Glutton fell silent.

Howard also looked up and noticed that many skills were already bombarding the moonlight guarding the Starry River Map. 

Although Pallor Swift had used the blood mist to obscure the connection between the moon and the Map, the previous moonlight was still protecting it, glowing brilliantly and resisting countless attacks.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A meteor hammer striking it was deflected away, and many skills were swallowed by its luminescence.

However, with the situation having escalated to this point, the multitude of awakened didn't give up and continued to deploy their skills.

Howard, meanwhile, was eagerly anticipating how Glutton would intervene. 

After all, he needed to remain concealed. If his intervention was too overt, it would surely be detected by the others.

As it turned out, the capabilities of a powerful being were indeed inscrutable to lower-level awakened.

Howard saw no sign of Glutton's action, yet the moonlight protecting the Starry River Map suddenly burst apart just before the awakened's combined onslaught.

A terrifying force swept out, striking each awakened's skill and transforming into a shockwave that howled as it hit the higher-level awakened.

It should be noted that Howard, aware of Glutton's plan and watching intently, was the only one to sense something amiss. 

The rest of the awakened didn't notice; they thought their attacks had finally breached the Starry River Map's protection.

As for the backlash? It was expected. 

However, they hadn't anticipated the backlash to be so powerful that it sent them flying, spewing blood, their energies significantly diminished.

Particularly for Pallor Swift, who had already strained himself to the limit by spilling his own heart's blood to sever the connection between the Starry River Map and the moon, the impact of that force left him gravely injured. 

His HP plummeted by four-fifths, leaving him critically weakened.

Luckily, the Holy Maiden accompanying him seemed quite concerned. 

She simultaneously directed her healers to tend to Pallor Swift's wounds and commanded others to seize the Starry River Map.

Not just them, but almost every awakened, except those high-level ones who were injured by the shockwave, prepared to snatch the Starry River Map.

This too was part of Glutton and his allies' deliberate plan.

While they intended to give Howard the Starry River Map, they also wanted to ensure he had the capability to claim it. 

Otherwise, it would be a waste of a Supreme Treasure.

Therefore, they had only injured the higher-level awakened, using the lower-level ones as a whetstone for Howard.

Understanding their intent, Howard's expression turned solemn as he readied himself to seize the Map. 

However, at that moment, a bizarre sound suddenly echoed through the air.

"Whoosh!"

A clear sound of flowing water rang out. 

Looking up, they were astonished to see that, having lost the protection of the moonlight, the Starry River Map had begun to move on its own, fluttering through the air like a sprite.

"Holy Shit?!"

"What the fuck?!"

"What's going on? Isn't the Starry River Map supposed to be an inanimate treasure? How can it move on its own?"

In that instant, all the awakened were taken aback, their movements momentarily frozen.

It was too bizarre for them to comprehend!

Even those around level 70 were encountering such a phenomenon for the first time, their eyes widening in disbelief.

However, as the numerous awakened gaped in astonishment, the Starry River Map, after fluttering for a moment in the air, suddenly darted towards Howard's location.

"Damn!"

"The Starry River Map is descending! Hurry, grab it!"

At this moment, many awakened snapped to action, surging forward in an attempt to snatch the Starry River Map.

Yet, the vast majority were struck down by a barrage of AOE skills just as they got close, forcefully knocked back. 

Some of the less powerful awakened even perished instantly.

But with a Supreme Treasure in sight, not even death could deter the multitude of awakened. 

Like moths to a flame, they continued to rush forward relentlessly.

Many hadn't even gotten close to the Starry River Map before they found themselves embroiled in fierce battles with nearby awakened.

Just as Howard was preparing to make his move, battles erupted around him, flames bursting into existence.

Fortunately, with quick reflexes, Howard swung his wand in an instant, unleashing Multiple Wind Blades. 

The gusts were not only razor-sharp but also carried a wind effect, blowing the flames away in an instant. 

Mixed with the wind blades, they struck several awakened nearby.

The flames were one thing, but the sharp wind blades tore through their flesh, eliciting pained screams.

Simultaneously, a shield materialized around Howard.

Sword Seven didn't hold back either. 

He turned around, drew his sword with a swift motion, and a surge of intersecting blade auras immediately spread out, repelling the awakened approaching them from behind.

Noticing this, Howard nodded slightly to himself, grateful that Sword Seven hadn't turned against him. 

With a sword master's assistance, his chances of successfully seizing the Starry River Map would significantly increase.

To be cautious, however, Howard asked, "Brother Sword Seven, do you have any designs on the Starry River Map?"

Hearing Howard's question, Sword Seven immediately responded with a laugh, "I'm here merely for experience and have no intention of fighting for the Starry River Map. Besides, you saved me earlier; I wouldn't want to be ungrateful and treacherous!"

In truth, Howard didn't really need to ask. 

He was well-equipped with protective skills and had been keeping a vigilant eye on others. 

Even if Sword Seven had harbored any ill intentions, Howard was confident he could fend them off. 

He just wanted to clarify things and, in doing so, enlist Sword Seven's help.

"Do me a favor and draw their attention!"

"Just give me a moment, and I can grab the Starry River Map!"

Howard was no fool. A single glance told him that reaching the Starry River Map amid the chaos would be extremely challenging.

Despite his numerous fortunate encounters, his class limitations still existed. 

His HP and defense were, at best, comparable to a level 50 tank, and if those around him couldn't withstand the onslaught, he certainly couldn't risk it. 

Going in recklessly would be tantamount to suicide.

Howard's advantage lay in his Spirit Veil Skill and the Blink ability. 

If he could manage to grab the Starry River Map amidst the crowd and then escape from the level 70 awakened, he could proceed with the next phase of his plan.

The group of level 70 awakened were currently seated on the ground, receiving healing from the medics of their respective factions, while also recuperating their own strength.

They understood that the chaotic battle wouldn't end quickly and were in no hurry. 

Once they had recovered, the number and fervor of the lower-level awakened wouldn't matter. 

Their only fate would be a regretful exit from the fray. 

Otherwise, they'd be risking death in their attempt to compete for the prize.

It could be said that Howard had only one chance: to seize the Starry River Map while the higher-level awakened were still recuperating. 

He needed to escape the vicinity while they were weak and seek support from Glutton and his group.

Sword Seven gazed at Howard for a moment, sensing his sincerity, and nodded, "Alright, I can buy you some time, but I can't guarantee for how long."

With that, Sword Seven raised his greatsword, and a strong gust immediately formed around him, with strange forces converging from all directions.

Seeing this, Howard also activated his Spirit Veil Skill, his figure instantly blending into the void.
