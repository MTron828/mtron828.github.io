Chapter 196 196-The Frequent Emergence of Space Rifts

Just how terrifying can a centipede over thirty yards in size be?

It appeared even more colossal than a dragon!

Its eyes alone were as large as a human, shimmering with an eerie light. 

This formidable presence instilled a sense of dread in Howard and his companions, causing their scalps to tingle with fear.

Howard quickly cast a Divination spell to discern the gigantic centipede's specific attributes.

[ Mortality Murderer Chieftain ] (BOSS)

[ Level: 80 ]

[ Tier: Epic ]

[ Description: The Chieftain of the Mortality Murderer clan, possessing far more powerful attributes and strength ]

[ HP: 1050000/1050000 ]

[ Attack Power: 91000—112740 ]

[ Defense Value: 80000 ]

[ Skills: Death Thrust, Fatal Strike, Terror Venom Mist, Death Roll, Death Hunt ]

The skills were familiar, but the daunting attributes made Howard's expression turn grave.

Faced with such a disparity in attributes, Howard could only hope to contend by once again using the Soul Fusion skill, and it would have to be an SSS-level skill at that!

Holding back was not an option. To battle this foe, he had to give it his all.

However, just as Howard was about to deploy the Soul Fusion skill and reveal his ability to transform into a dragon, a sudden whooshing sound came from behind.

Turning around, he saw two figures cutting through the sky, approaching at incredible speed.

"Mentors?!"

Seeing this, Howard's eyes lit up.

His heart, too, relaxed completely.

Wales's strength far exceeded his apparent abilities. 

With him present, not just a Level 80 BOSS, but even a Level 100 BOSS could be easily vanquished.

After all, with the right equipment and talents, a person's potential strength can far surpass that of monsters of the same level.Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Even if they are Extraplanar creatures!

Extraplanar creatures come in various forms, including humanoid and beastly monsters. 

Only humanoid monsters possess the ability to don equipment and comprehend talents much like humans.

As for Tana?

Although Tana was formidable, in Howard's view, she still fell short of Wales's prowess.

Indeed, this was the case.

Even in terms of speed, Tana was significantly slower than Wales.

Wales, like a meteor, managed to reach the Mortality Murderer Chieftain before it could even launch an attack. 

His body passed right through the Chieftain's frame.

In the next instant, a dazzling silver-white blade aura burst forth from within the Mortality Murderer Chieftain, causing its body to disintegrate into pieces.

Bathed in blood, Wales emerged from the shattered remains of the Mortality Murderer Chieftain.

Following this, a white light appeared, and the Mortality Murderer Chieftain, who had just uttered its threats, began to dissipate.

It was a one-shot kill!

This scene completely astounded all the students, who stared at Wales with a mix of awe and surprise.

Even Tana, witnessing Wales's full power for the first time, couldn't help but widen her eyes in shock, covering her mouth with her hand.

Wales wasn't as concerned about the students as he was about Howard. 

Only after seeing Howard safe and sound did he let out a sigh of relief, then turned his attention to the other students.

Ensuring that no student had been harmed, Wales immediately asked, "What exactly happened?"

Howard quickly stepped forward and recounted the events that had transpired.

Upon learning that the space rift had yet to be destroyed, Wales instructed Tana to take care of Howard and the others. 

He then once again entered an invisibility state and set off to destroy the space rift.

Seeing this, the students couldn't help but express their amazement.

Even Tana couldn't help but marvel, "This is the first time I've realized just how powerful Wales really is."

"Ah?"

Hearing their mentor praising Wales, the students became curious. 

They had assumed that mentors like Tana and Wales were of similar strength.

Noticing the students' gazes, Tana gave a wry smile and said, "My strength, though sufficient to handle that Mortality Murderer Chieftain, certainly couldn't achieve an instant kill. I would have had to engage in a prolonged battle."

"You could say that Wales's strength far surpasses mine!"

Hearing Ms. Tana herself admit her inferiority to Wales, the students began to regard him as an even greater figure of strength.

They silently resolved that the next time Wales held a class, they would do whatever it took to foster a good relationship with him.

"Only three survivors left at the base?"

"It's so tragic... I never expected Extraplanar creatures to invade the human race at this time!"

Tana, with a stern expression, said directly, "Everyone did well this time. Hurry and collect the bodies of those Extraplanar creatures. Later, I'll help you exchange them for rewards!"

Hearing that collecting the bodies of Extraplanar creatures could earn them rewards, the students' eyes lit up. 

They were overjoyed and quickly set about gathering their spoils of war.

Meanwhile, Howard silently awaited Wales's return.

He was acutely aware of the formidable nature of Extraplanar creatures. 

Until he saw Wales return, his heart would not be at ease.

Fortunately, Wales's strength was more than sufficient to handle Extraplanar creatures.

In a short while, Wales reappeared, taking a seat next to Howard and Tana.

"How did it go?"

Feeling Wales's return, Tana quickly asked, "Is the space rift destroyed? Are there any hidden Extraplanar creatures remaining?"

"I've already used my skills to confirm that there are no living Extraplanar creatures left," Wales nodded. 

"The space rift has been destroyed. However, have you noticed that the frequency of Extraplanar creatures appearing recently seems to have increased?"

"Now that you mention it…" 

Tana nodded thoughtfully, speaking in a low voice, "In the past, within our Adia City, we might not encounter a space rift even once a year. But this year isn't even over, and I've already come across three space rifts. It's genuinely surprising."

Hearing their conversation, Howard also chimed in, "About two months ago, near the Dark Mausoleum in Saint City, I encountered a space rift. Fortunately, the monsters within it were relatively weak and I managed to eliminate them."

"…"

Upon hearing this, both Tana and Wales's expressions grew more solemn.

"There's a problem!"

Wales spoke gravely, "Extraplanar creatures might be scheming something. We must inform the Dean about this!"

Tana became anxious, "But we can't contact the Dean right now. What should we do?"

Any situation involving Extraplanar creatures was of such gravity that it was beyond the capacity of a mentor, even someone of Daniel's caliber, to handle alone.

Wales turned his gaze towards Howard, speaking softly, "Howard, perhaps… we might need you to introduce us to Rick."

Rick was a powerful figure within the Alliance. 

The reason he had stayed in Adia City was to seek revenge on his nemesis.

Now that Rick had avenged his great foe, he was in the process of returning to the internal operations of the Alliance. 

Even though he was still in Adia City, his status was such that only direct subordinates of the Oversight Department, heads of major institutions, or individuals of the rank of the Mayor of Adia City could engage in equal dialogue with him or convey messages to him.

Hearing this, Howard's brow slightly furrowed.

Wales was aware of his relationship with Rick!

It was noteworthy that Howard had only recently become Rick's apprentice. 

This implied that even when Howard was involved in the Starry River Map incident, Wales had been keeping an eye on him. 

Perhaps he didn't know the specifics, but he was certainly aware of the general situation.

Even though Howard knew that Wales had always been protecting him and providing benefits, a sense of irritation stirred deep within him. 

Being constantly monitored by someone was indeed hard to accept.

However, Howard also understood the urgency of the current situation and did not dwell on it further. 

He nodded and said, "After we return, I will take you to meet my teacher."

"My teacher?!"

Hearing Howard's words, Tana was instantly surprised, "You… you've actually taken Rick as your teacher?"

"Yes."

Howard replied with a light laugh, "The academy hasn't set any rules against students taking masters, has it?"

"No, not at all!"

Tana responded excitedly, "I just can't believe it. You… you actually took such a high-level powerhouse as your teacher! No wonder, no wonder your strength as a student is so formidable, far surpassing your peers. Not just that, even students in their fifth or sixth year might not be able to best you!"

"Now is not the time to discuss this." Wales interjected seriously. "This mission is over. Once we return to Adia City, you take the students back, inform Daniel about the situation, and have him try to contact the Dean. Howard and I will go to meet Lord Rick."

"Understood!" Tana replied, "If you come to any conclusions, remember to let me know. We've finally encountered Extraplanar creatures, and I want to contribute my part as well!"
