Chapter 237 237-The Formidable Chris

"No, I will handle this myself," Howard declared with unwavering determination.

Seeing his resolve, the steward had no choice but to consent.

Turning to the young girl, he spoke sternly, "Chris, be especially careful. Do not harm this nobleman, or you will face severe consequences."

Chris lifted her gaze to Howard, biting her lip as she nodded in acknowledgment.

Having grown up in the slums, she had always harbored a deep disdain for the aristocracy.

Even now, reduced to slavery, her desire to strike down any noble she encountered was undiminished.

In her eyes, Howard, clad in his ornate armor, was nothing more than a feeble noble, utterly useless in combat.

His desire to engage with her without suffering any injury was, to her, an indication of his utter ignorance of what true battle entailed.

He was nothing more than a wealthy fool.

Despite her intense dissatisfaction, as a slave, she was not at liberty to voice her objections.

She was forced to comply with the steward's arrangements, maintaining a facade of respect.

Any sign of disrespect would lead to inhumane punishment.

Two months had passed since she had been captured and brought to this dark, filthy place.

She was weary of it all.

Even a nobleman, as loathsome as they were, would be a welcome means to an end if he could take her away from this misery.

Concealing her rage deep within, Chris focused on Howard, who now stood opposite her.

The steward had cleared enough space for their confrontation and had positioned a dozen formidable guards around the perimeter to ensure Howard's safety.

"Please, do not hold back. Show me your worth," Howard said coldly.

Chris looked at Howard with disdain.

She knew she could easily crush the man before her if she unleashed her full strength.

Yet, she restrained herself; Howard's death would bring her no advantage.

Outwardly, she couldn't defy Howard either, as she recognized that he might become her master in the future.

Once enslaved, it was nearly impossible to escape that fate.

But compared to an eternity confined here, the outside world, with its open skies, seemed far more appealing.

"Fine, I will prove it to you," Chris said, her expression impassive.

The steward, standing nearby, shook his head in resignation, internally lamenting yet another nobleman's ignorance of the harsh realities of the world.

He had already informed Howard about the girl's rare orcish bloodline, which granted her immense strength.

Any warrior worth their salt would know what that implied: she was not an adversary to be taken lightly by a single individual.

Yet, Howard had insisted that she not hold back, clearly demonstrating his naivety.

Was this his first time wielding a sword? The steward grew increasingly worried.

What if Howard was seriously injured? It could ruin the deal, not to mention potentially offend a nobleman.

Thus, he reminded Chris once more, "Remember, do not injure this gentleman!"

Chris, already annoyed by the repeated cautions, replied tersely, "I know."

Howard's request for Chris to exert her full strength was not born out of overestimation of his abilities.

He wanted to gauge her strength, and he believed that with his current equipment, he could stand a chance even against a Kaedwyn warrior.

After all, his gear was worth an entire Frostwolf Mercenaries troop.

In this moment, Howard also sought to test his own mettle, to get a sense of his capabilities in combat.

Picking up his shield and weapon, Howard fixed his gaze on her.

"Don't you need a weapon?" he asked.

Chris and the steward couldn't help but reveal a mocking smile.

A weapon?¬†

"No need. You may begin," she responded, letting Howard make the first move, aware that her attacks were too much for most to withstand.

Without any hesitation, Howard, clutching his equipment, charged towards Chris.

Despite her shackles still clasping her wrists and ankles, they did nothing to impede her agile movements.Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

She easily dodged Howard's initial assault.

Chris's expression shifted as she observed Howard.

His armor, shield, and weapon were evidently heavy, yet he maintained a swift pace.

He didn't seem to be the useless noble she had assumed.

Before she could fully process her surprise, Howard launched another attack, faster than before, leaping and slashing with his sword.

Chris, slightly underestimating her opponent, couldn't dodge in time and had to block with the iron chains binding her hands.

But the chains were effortlessly severed by Howard's sword.

Howard felt a surge of elation.

When his sword cut through the chains, he hadn't felt any resistance ‚Äì his purchase was indeed worth it.

At this moment, Chris realized she had underestimated Howard.

Her dormant combat spirit ignited.

Freed from the shackles, she clenched her fists and struck Howard's abdomen with astonishing speed.

Howard, intending to continue his assault, neglected his defense.

He hadn't anticipated Chris's rapid response and was struck squarely, sent flying backward.

Upon landing, he felt pain coursing through his body.

Had it not been for his armor, that punch could have been lethal.

The steward, witnessing this scene, was terrified yet quickly summoned people to assist Howard.

Meanwhile, Chris was harshly reprimanded, a fierce keeper lashing her with a whip mercilessly.

Through it all, Chris remained stoic, not uttering a sound.

"My lord, are you alright?" they asked Howard.

Upon getting to his feet and seeing Chris being punished, Howard immediately shouted, "Stop!" The keeper, taken aback, halted his action.

The steward interjected, "My lord, she injured you. She deserves to be taught a lesson."

Howard glanced at his armor, now slightly dented from Chris's punch, astonished by her strength.

He hadn't expected such a frail-looking frame to contain such immense power.

The mark on the armor wasn't overtly noticeable, further testament to Chris's formidable ability.

When Howard had purchased the armor, the equipment store's owner had assured him that even a hundred blows with a sledgehammer would leave no mark.

Though he knew merchants often exaggerated, the defensive capability of this armor was indeed exceptional, perhaps even surpassing that of the Empire Knights' commanders.

"I've decided to purchase her," Howard declared.

"How she is treated is my decision."

The steward was visibly relieved.

He had expected Howard to be furious after the injury, as young nobles were often pampered and temperamental.

Surprisingly, the deal was still on, much to everyone's surprise, including Chris.

The price was steep - 250000 gold coins, amounting to two large chests, so Howard had them brought from the bank.

He could have opted for banknotes, but the process was too cumbersome.

Watching the steward count the gleaming gold coins, Chris realized her own worth for the first time in her life.

She had never seen so much money before.

Afterward, Howard took Chris and left.

He spent his entire savings on purchasing clothes and equipment for her.

Chris was surprised that Howard would spend tens of thousands of gold coins right away to buy her equipment.

Now, the enchanted armor and battle robe she wore, along with a two-handed sword, were worth far more than what Howard himself possessed.

Even the clothes he bought for her were enchanted treasures, which made Chris curious about Howard's true identity.

She had thought he might be a duke's son, but Howard's residence was on an unassuming street, modest at best.

It didn't match the profile of someone who could casually spend hundreds of thousands of gold coins.

Was he hiding his true status?

With these thoughts, Chris followed Howard to his temporary abode.

He told her to pick any room she liked, informing her that a significant battle awaited her the next day and that she should rest well.

The upcoming confrontation with Kaedwyn, though seemingly secure with hostages in hand, still posed risks.

Kaedwyn himself was a formidable warrior with hundreds of followers, none of whom were to be underestimated.

Chris's survival the next day was uncertain, so Howard was exceptionally kind to her today.

He not only bought her beautiful and practical clothes but also asked what she wanted to eat, promising to get it for her later.

Chris had always thought that as a slave, nobles wouldn't treat her as a human being.

However, she didn't expect Howard to be so kind to her.

Growing up in the slums, she was strong but had no means of earning money.

Her impoverished status and military service were consistently marred by suppression, to the point where she rarely had enough to eat.

Afterward, she was made a scapegoat by her commanders following a defeat and became a prisoner.

The executioner, noticing her strength and some degree of beauty, sold her to a slave trader.

For two whole months with the slave trader, she endured harsh conditions.

Each day, she slept in a filthy and dim space, bearing unbearable things.

Now, suddenly being treated with such kindness was incredibly moving for her, even though she knew Howard had his motives.

But, that was to be expected.

During dinner, Howard sincerely said to Chris, "You might die tomorrow, so if you have any last wishes, tell me. If you really do die, I will fulfill them for you."¬†

Chris was surprised that Howard would say these things to her.

Even if she remained silent, bound by the contract, she had to obey his commands.

But Howard still prepared her mentally, even asking if she had any unresolved grievances.

"However, you don't need to worry too much. After all, there's only a possibility of death. I will do my best to avoid such a scenario, but I can't completely rule it out, given that our opponent is Kaedwyn."
