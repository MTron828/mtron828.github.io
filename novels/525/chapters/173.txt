Chapter 174 174-On the Verge of Breaking?

How alluring is the pull of a Supreme Treasure?

In less than a quarter of an hour, Howard was astonished to find that over ten thousand awakened had already converged in the vicinity. 

During this time, many had attempted to seize the Starry River Map, but the beautiful and dazzling moonlight revealed a terrifying lethality.

Strong warriors above level 70 and well-equipped heirs of top forces, regardless of their prowess, were either maimed by the moonlight or repelled. 

Not a single awakened could approach within a yard of the Starry River Map!

Despite this, not one of them left. 

They all gathered nearby, discussing strategies to break through the moonlight that protected the Starry River Map.

Of course, while they appeared harmonious for now, the moment the Starry River Map was within grasp, every awakened would engage in the most intense battle. 

After all, no one would willingly relinquish a Supreme Treasure of legend!

Howard alone knew that the Starry River Map was firmly in the hands of Rick and his associates, watching the ongoing efforts of the other awakened with an amused detachment.

Another quarter of an hour passed, and the multitude of awakened, seeing the moonlight still guarding the Starry River Map, grew increasingly impatient.

Corinna Maya, Pallor Swift, and several camp leaders stepped forward.

"Fellow awakened," they announced, "as long as the moon is in the sky, the moonlight will continuously absorb more power, becoming ever more formidable. We cannot continue like this!"

Pallor Swift, one of the most formidable figures in the open, proposed, "With our individual strength, we cannot break through the moonlight. Why not join forces?"

"I can temporarily block the moon's radiance. Is there anyone else who can tear apart the moonlight?"

As his words fell, the gathered awakened exchanged uncertain glances, each grappling with hesitation. 

They were wary of making a move now, only to have others reap the benefits.

However, they also sensed the truth in Pallor Swift's words. 

As time progressed, the moonlight barrier protecting the Starry River Map seemed only to grow stronger.

Initially, the barrier's attacks merely repelled the awakened, but now, there was a risk of death.

"That's right, I agree with Bishop Pallor's suggestion," voiced someone from Black Tortoise City. 

With their lead, numerous powerful figures gathered together, their identities recognized by onlookers who gasped in surprise.

Even Howard felt a chill upon hearing the identities of these individuals. 

They were all level 70 or above, holding high-ranking positions in major powers. 

Their equipment was undoubtedly superior, and their presence exerted a palpable pressure on those around.

In that moment, Howard could only pin his hopes on Rick and his companions, formulating rules that would favor him. 

Otherwise, the prospect of him facing off against these renowned level 70 powerhouses seemed utterly hopeless.

Even if he hadn't encountered Cameron and his Soul Fusion ability wasn't cooling down, he still saw no chance of victory.

After all, securing the Starry River Map would undoubtedly involve more than just a single battle!

As Howard surveyed his surroundings, seeking Glutton and his group, his eyes chanced upon Sword Seven. 

Hesitating briefly, he quickly donned a smile and hastened over.

"Howard, you're here too!"

Sword Seven's keen senses detected Howard even before he reached his side. 

However, Howard also noticed that Sword Seven seemed to be evading something.

With a playful glint in his eye, Howard chuckled, "Looks like you're trying to escape from someone. Are you being hunted down?"

"Not exactly," Sword Seven replied with a wry smile. "I ran into a woman who, upon seeing me, declared I was her future husband. No matter what I said, she just wouldn't leave me alone. Now, I have no choice but to hide from her."

Hearing this, Howard's eyebrows raised slightly. Such an experience seemed straight out of a novel, the kind that would make Sword Seven the protagonist!

Howard became more convinced that Sword Seven must be destined for great things. 

Resolutely, he decided to stick close to Sword Seven, hoping to gain some advantage for himself.

If others knew Howard's thoughts, they would be exasperated to the point of spitting blood. 

His own fortune was already outrageous, far surpassing Sword Seven's by several magnitudes, yet he still sought to leech off someone else's fate?

"How does this woman look?" Howard teased. "If she's attractive, I think you might consider exploring things with her. If she has ulterior motives, you can always run away later. If she's not... well, best to start running now!"

Sword Seven showed a resigned smile and swiftly changed the subject, "Let's not talk about that. Howard, with so many veteran powerhouses here, do you think we stand a chance at seizing the Starry River Map?"

"As long as the Starry River Map hasn't been claimed, anything is possible," Howard replied with a light chuckle. "Who knows, maybe in the end, it will be you and I who get our hands on it."

Before Sword Seven could respond, a sudden shout echoed among the crowd, instantly drawing the attention of the many awakened.

There, Pallor Swift was seen letting out a skyward howl. 

As he waved his wand, he conjured a blood-red mist that grew increasingly dense and even began spreading towards the sky.

However, as the mist expanded, Pallor Swift's complexion turned paler, his energy seemingly draining, leaving him looking feeble.

"Are Bishop Pallor and the others making their move?"

"Go for it, break through the Starry River Map's protection!"

Countless awakened cheered for Pallor Swift, almost wishing they could transfer their own strength into his body. 

After all, if the protective barrier around the Starry River Map couldn't be broken, they had no chance to snatch it in the ensuing chaos.

Even the level 70 and above powerhouses were watching Pallor Swift with intense gazes.

If Pallor Swift could disrupt the connection between the moonlight and the Starry River Map, they would be able to unleash their full power and break through the Map's defense. 

This was the strategy they had agreed upon earlier!

Humming eerily, the blood mist, fueled by Pallor Swift's power, ascended slowly but steadily. 

Unfazed by the moonlight shining upon it, the mist didn't waver or diminish in any way; it just kept rising, step by step.

10 yards… 20 yards… 50 yards…

Particularly when the blood mist overlapped with the Starry River Map, the tens of thousands of awakened present, including Howard and Sword Seven, found their breathing quicken. 

Their eyes blazed with intensity, fixated on the sky above, fists clenching involuntarily.

Pallor Swift was visibly tense. 

He was prepared to unleash his trump card at a moment's notice, should the blood mist be affected by the moonlight.

Fortunately, the moonlight, tasked with guarding the Starry River Map, lacked the capability to attack proactively. 

Even as it became enveloped by the blood mist, there was no response.

Relief washed over the awakened as they witnessed this scene.

Pallor Swift immediately continued to elevate the blood mist. 

It spread out, severing the connection between the Starry River Map and the moon. 

In an instant, the starlight swirling around the Starry River Map dimmed significantly.

Just as everyone's faces lit up with excitement, they were shocked to see Pallor Swift's body suddenly tremble.

In the sky, the obscured moonlight started to glow even brighter, resembling a flame on the verge of eruption, continuously scorching the blood mist.

"Quick! Act now, I can't hold on much longer!"Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Pallor Swift roared, and in the next moment, he transformed his right hand into a palm and fiercely struck his own chest.

Thump!

This forceful blow to the chest made him spew a mouthful of blood, which splattered onto his wand. 

Instantly, the wand absorbed all the blood, and the blood mist in the sky, as if invigorated by some potent drug, flared up even more fiercely, resisting the moonlight's rays.

Simultaneously, a host of top-tier warriors also sprang into action. As they levitated in the air, a flurry of skills was unleashed.

A massive, deep aquamarine turtle phantom appeared. 

This time, instead of exuding mountain-like pressure, it seemed more like a thunderous beast, fiercely charging towards the Starry River Map.

"Cross Slash!"

A swordsman slowly drew intersecting crosses in the air before him. 

Blade aura emerged, brimming with an unstoppable force, and sliced towards the Starry River Map.

With their lead, a myriad of magical skills, arrows, spears, and even one awakened who hurled a meteor hammer that spun through the air followed suit.

For a moment, the light from the plethora of skills erupted brilliantly, overshadowing the Starry River Map, causing the countless onlookers to tense up.

It was then that Howard suddenly heard Glutton's voice by his ear: "Kid, I'm going to break the protective barrier soon and trigger an explosion among those guys. They'll be injured and won't be able to recover to their peak state for a while. You need to seize this moment to snatch the Starry River Map from them!"
