Chapter 178 178-Sickly Sprout

Ice Ghost's decisive and lethal actions instantly shocked the awakened ones who had hoped to slip through unnoticed.

"Anyone who dares deceive me again will see every person above level 60 slain!" Ice Ghost stated indifferently, "Do not force me to stain my hands with blood."

His icy murderous intent left the multitude of awakened feeling as if they had plunged into an abyss of ice.¬†

They shivered uncontrollably, utterly convinced by Ice Ghost's words.

After all, the intensity of his killing intent was almost palpable!¬†

Even those among them accustomed to the frontlines of battle, clashing with demons and extraplanar beings, had never felt such oppressive force and aura as that of Ice Ghost.

Thus, his words profoundly stunned them, rendering them too fearful to make any further move.

Around thirty seconds passed, and the strong ones previously frozen by Ice Ghost finally managed to break free from their icy prisons, shattering the ice that encased them.

However, during their entrapment, their senses had not been severed.¬†

They too had heard Ice Ghost's words and, even after regaining their freedom, dared not act rashly.

The fact that Ice Ghost had been able to freeze so many of them in an instant, and maintain control for a full thirty seconds, was testament to his terrifying strength.F·ªãùíèdd ùíèew updùíÇtùíÜs on n(o)v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

Those who had survived to around level 70 were almost all cunning and experienced individuals, having endured various life-and-death situations.¬†

Why would they willingly provoke someone clearly stronger than themselves?

Still, after exchanging glances, the gathered awakened couldn't help but ask, "May we know which power this senior hails from?"

However, in response to the inquiries of the many awakened, Ice Ghost remained silent.¬†

He swept his gaze over them and then placed his ice-blue longsword beside him, crossing his legs and closing his eyes, as if no one else existed in his presence.

Although the multitude of awakened ones felt anger at being ignored, they dared not confront Ice Ghost.¬†

Glancing around, they contemplated bypassing him to continue their pursuit of Howard.

Before they could act, the ice-blue longsword suddenly trembled, emitting a crisp, resonant sword cry.

The next moment, countless deep blue ice spires materialized out of thin air, whistling down like raindrops, even tearing through the air with a sonic boom.

The terrifying force made all the awakened targeted by the ice spires feel as if death was imminent, their legs going weak.

However, just as the ice spires were about to strike them, they halted abruptly in mid-air.

Although no harm was done to the awakened, the sensation of narrowly escaping death left them profoundly shaken.

They realized that Ice Ghost not only had the ability to kill them instantly but also to prevent any of them from escaping.

"Make another move, and you shall be shown no mercy!"

Ice Ghost wouldn't truly kill these people, as he was a member of the Alliance, and his actions had to uphold the reputation of the Alliance.

Unless, of course, these individuals were truly beyond persuasion and sought their own demise.

"May I ask, senior, what is your level, and which sacred faction do you represent?"

"We admit defeat today and hope the senior would grace us with his name!"

Some of the awakened, feeling indignant and unreconciled, raised their voices to question.

"Any more noise, and everyone dies!"

Ice Ghost suddenly opened his eyes, his cold gaze and frenzied killing intent thoroughly terrifying the multitude of awakened.¬†

At this point, regardless of the powers backing them, they dared not utter another word.

Their only hope now lay with the younger generation.

Meanwhile, Howard, carrying the Starry River Map, was sprinting away.¬†

Noticing that only awakened around level 50 were following him, and not the higher-level ones, a smile couldn't help but break across his face.

With this turn of events, Howard felt confident that he could stand victorious in the upcoming confrontation and seize the Starry River Map.

However, the news of the Starry River Map's emergence had spread far and wide.¬†

Many awakened were only now arriving at the scene.¬†

Naturally, they bypassed Ice Ghost's location and directly encountered Howard.

Among these newcomers were several high-level players.

When they saw Howard sprinting at high speed, holding the Starry River Map that rustled with the sound of flowing water, they were instantly elated.

"Ha ha ha!"

"Lucky me, just arrived in the Dark Mausoleum and stumbled upon the Starry River Map!"

"Kid, you're done for!"

As the words fell, one of the awakened leaped forward, fists clenched.¬†

A massive hammer materialized out of thin air into his hands and he violently smashed it towards Howard's face.

Just as Howard was about to use his Blink skill to dodge the attack, a muffled groan abruptly rang out.¬†

The awakened who had launched the sneak attack appeared to be struck hard in the chest, hurtling backward through the air.

Old Smokey's figure quietly emerged on the other side, leaning against a tree root, leisurely puffing on a long-stemmed pipe.¬†

His eyes were half-closed, exuding an air of contentment.

Yet, the terrifying power emanating from him was like ceaseless waves surging forth from his being.

"Uncle Master Old Smokey!"

Seeing this, Howard couldn't help but show a look of joy. It had to be said, the feeling of being protected was truly marvelous.

The group of awakened who were pursuing Howard slowed their pace upon realizing that such a formidable figure was Howard's Uncle Master.¬†

They feared that getting too close might result in Old Smokey taking them out.

After all, their own protectors hadn't caught up with them!

A wise man does not stand under a collapsing wall; they naturally wouldn't put themselves in a perilous situation.

Seemingly aware of the concerns of the group of awakened, Old Smokey spoke with a hearty laugh, "Folks, no need to worry. As long as you are below Level 60 awakened, we will not intervene!"

Hearing Old Smokey's words, the eyes of the many awakened lit up.

Generally, the words of a powerful being were reliable. Without much hesitation, they resumed their pursuit.

Under Old Smokey's escort, Howard swiftly arrived at a massive rock with the Starry River Map in hand.

The rock towered over thirty yards high. Hesitating for a moment, Howard directly used his Blink skill to leap onto the stone platform.

Upon reaching the top of the rock, Howard noticed that Rick, Glutton, and another man, who appeared exceptionally pale and weak, were already seated on the highest stone.

Rick, noticing Howard, immediately waved at him.

Howard, curious about the identity of the pale, frail man, quickened his pace and leaped onto the stone platform.¬†

He grinned and said, "Master, mission accomplished. I've brought the Starry River Map!"

In truth, if Howard had been alone, he could have left with the Starry River Map after escaping the pursuers.¬†

However, entirely reliant on Rick and the others' assistance to evade the awakened, he had no choice but to follow their method in seizing the Starry River Map.

Another point was that if he could obtain the Starry River Map under the direct witness of everyone, and with top-tier fighters like Rick backing him, who would dare challenge Howard for the Starry River Map?¬†

That would be akin to courting death.

Should anything befall Howard, the perpetrators would face the relentless pursuit of several top-level masters.

"Not bad at all," Rick said with satisfaction, then turned to the frail man and spoke, "Sickly Sprout, what do you think of the disciple I've taken?"

Hearing this, the weak man couldn't help but glance at Howard.

Howard was already accustomed to such scrutiny; after all, he had been examined many times before!

"Under eighteen years old and already cultivated to over level 30, with a physique comparable to a level 50 physical-type awakened ‚Äì impressive, kid! Where did you find such a promising sprout?" The weak man's eyes sparkled as he spoke.

For fighters of their caliber, finding a successor was of utmost importance.¬†

Otherwise, should they fail to break through to level 100, not only would they perish, but they would also leave behind no disciple to inherit their mantle and protect their families ‚Äì a truly tragic fate.

"Hahaha!" Rick laughed heartily, clearly detecting the envy in the weak man's words. "It's all about timing and fate. Don't worry, I believe you'll soon find a disciple of your own."

"Ah... it's difficult!" Sickly Sprout sighed. "Finding an awakened who is naturally frail yet has survived long enough to awaken their talent is exceedingly rare. If I take a normal person as a disciple, they wouldn't be able to fully utilize my techniques."

Hearing the conversation between Rick and Sickly Sprout, Howard's curiosity was piqued.¬†

What kind of training did Sickly Sprout undergo that required a naturally sickly person as a disciple?¬†

Generally, those born frail and sickly would struggle to survive past the age of ten, let alone live long enough to awaken their talents!

No wonder he seemed so envious and somewhat disheartened to see Rick with a disciple suited to his liking.

"Young fellow, first time meeting you, here is my... cough cough... my gift to you as your Uncle Master!"

While speaking, Sickly Sprout suddenly broke into a severe coughing fit, his face turning bright red.

After a lengthy bout of coughing, he recovered and pulled out a book from his chest.
