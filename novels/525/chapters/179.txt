Chapter 180 180-The Archer in Plate Armor

The moment they heard the rule, many of the awakened thought about delaying their entry onto the stage.

After all, this rule was quite disadvantageous for those who ascended the platform first!

Unless an awakened was strong enough to consecutively defeat all the challengers by themselves, the latecomers who conserved their strength would likely have the upper hand.

Consequently, the awakened exchanged glances, but no one was willing to step forward.

Even those confident in their strength hesitated, standing still and staring at each other.

"Of course, any awakened who ascends the stage and wins five consecutive matches can step down to rest. Furthermore, only those who have achieved five consecutive victories can challenge each other!"

"If no one is willing to come forward, then we will have to assume that none of you are interested in the Starry River Map, and we might just have to keep it for ourselves."

Glutton said cheerfully, but his words shocked all the awakened.

"Since no one wishes to go first, allow me to lead the way!"

Sword Seven abruptly flung his giant sword behind him and leapt onto it, landing steadily on the stone platform.CHùíÜCk for ùíèew stùíêries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This act instantly caught the attention of many female awakened, their eyes sparkling with admiration - it was just too cool!

However, as cool as his moves were, Sword Seven's appearance couldn't match Howard's, causing the female awakened to shift their gazes back to Howard.

Fortunately, someone soon challenged Sword Seven, diverting everyone's attention to the unfolding battle.

Even among those from powerful factions, the difference in strength between awakened individuals was significant.

The person who challenged Sword Seven didn't last three moves before being sent flying by Sword Seven's giant sword.

The second and third challengers met similar fates, and it wasn't until the fourth person stepped onto the stage that Sword Seven's expression turned serious.

This challenger was an archer, yet he wore extremely heavy Plate Armor. His face bore a radiant smile, but it sent shivers down the spine.

"That seems to be Engert Pani, the young master of the Divine Arrow Sect. It's said that he's only thirty years old and already at level 59, just one step away from level 60!"

"That's odd though. If he's an archer, why would he wear such heavy armor? Shouldn't archers prioritize agility and high mobility?"

The gathered awakened exchanged glances, murmuring among themselves.

Even Howard looked surprised. This defied conventional wisdom!

In reality, while the equipment worn by each class isn't fixed, there are certain norms.

Cloth Armor generally offers low Defense Value and is usually enhanced with wisdom or skill bonuses, making it the typical choice for classes like magi.

Leather Armor, falling somewhere between Cloth Armor and higher defenses, stands out for its lightness and snug fit, not restricting the wearer's movements.¬†

It's commonly used by classes like archers and warriors.

Chain Armor, only second to Plate Armor in Defense Value, usually comes with strength bonuses.¬†

It's often chosen by classes like warriors, who need to balance self-protection with offensive capabilities.

As for Plate Armor, it's the heaviest with the highest Defense Value, usually providing HP bonuses, and is typically worn by classes like shield bearers.

Using equipment meant for other classes, even if it's of higher grade or has better attributes, often doesn't match the efficiency and comfort of class-specific equipment.

These considerations were common knowledge, so many of the awakened were taken aback upon noticing Engert Pani's choice of equipment.

Only a few who knew the reason behind it adopted a knowing air, remarking, "The Divine Arrow Sect is a leading force among archers, rivaling even the Archer Guild. Their approach is not something you ordinary folks would understand."

The crowd below murmured amongst themselves, while on the platform, Sword Seven and Engert exchanged glances, both introducing themselves.

Clearly, they both regarded the other as a formidable opponent, feeling a sense of mutual respect. Otherwise, they would have already engaged in combat.

Since there were no specific rules for the battle and no adjustments made for class-based positioning, Sword Seven and Engert were less than ten yards apart.

Seeing this, many awakened shook their heads slightly, doubting Engert's ability to withstand Sword Seven's onslaught.

After all, a swordsman's Charge skill is not only instantaneous but also comes with a powerful control effect.¬†

Being hit and stunned, even an archer clad in Plate Armor, not just Chain Armor, could only endure a few more hits at most.

Sword Seven harbored similar thoughts.¬†

His eyes turned icy, and the moment Glutton announced the start, he immediately executed his Charge skill.¬†

Transforming into a bolt of lightning, he swung his giant sword towards Engert's face.

Simultaneously, Engert didn't retreat.¬†

The moment Sword Seven surged forward, he raised his hand and fired five feathered arrows.

Whoosh‚Äî

The five arrows shot out in quick succession, striking the charging Sword Seven with precise accuracy.

The next moment, a scene that shocked all the awakened unfolded.

The Charge skill, universally acknowledged as unbreakable during execution, was unexpectedly interrupted by Engert's arrows, leaving Sword Seven stunned in place.

"This..."

"How did Engert manage to hit Sword Seven? The speed of a charging skill is extremely fast. Even a distance of 20 yards can be covered in just a second. How did Engert hit him at such close range?"

The way the many awakened looked at Engert suddenly changed, filled with intrigue and curiosity.

As Sword Seven was stunned, Engert struck again.¬†

His arrows, like a continuous stream, kept hitting Sword Seven, astonishingly pushing him back and even causing consecutive control effects.

"What's surprising is that when Engert's arrows hit Sword Seven, they actually managed to push him back continuously, even causing stunning effects."

"I get it now!"

"While Plate Armor mainly boosts HP, it also significantly increases vitality and strength compared to Leather Armor. With a stronger physique, each arrow can have a knockback effect and even stun the target!"

"So that's the strategy!"

"However, this kind of tactic is difficult to master. The attack speed is too slow. Unless you can ensure that every arrow hits the target, once you're approached, you become an easy target."

"Poor Sword Seven. He probably never encountered this kind of archer before and didn't react in time, falling into a series of control effects."

"Hmm, I wonder how Sword Seven will break out of this?"

"I remember warriors should have the Indomitable Will skill. It's just a matter of when he uses it."

Witnessing this unusual combat style, the awakened were filled with curiosity.

Engert, hearing the discussions below, remained composed, methodically drawing his bow and shooting arrows, each one effectively pushing Sword Seven back.

After attacking fifteen times, Sword Seven's HP bar had dropped to around 30%, and he was even driven to the edge of the arena, seemingly on the verge of falling off at any moment.

At this point, Engert finally showed a smile.

However, just as Engert was about to shoot another arrow to force Sword Seven off the platform, Sword Seven let out a furious roar.¬†

The stunning effect instantly dissipated, and he abruptly raised his giant sword, blocking the incoming arrow.

"Breaking control now, haha, too late!" Engert laughed. "Bow of Ruin, strike!"

As his words fell, Engert finally executed his skill. The arrow on his bowstring glowed with a dark purple light, resembling a monster that devoured vitality.

Sword Seven took a deep breath, gripped his sword hilt with both hands, and thrust his giant sword into the stone floor of the arena with great force.

Almost instantly, hundreds of sharp blade auras burst from within Sword Seven, howling towards Engert.

The dark purple arrow also flew out, but before it could reach Sword Seven, the multitude of blade auras had already torn it apart.

The next moment, all the blade auras struck Engert.

Engert wasn't foolish.¬†

Seeing his skill countered, he quickly covered his head with his hands and crouched on the ground, allowing the blade auras to hit his heavy Plate Armor.

It must be said that the Defense Value provided by the Plate Armor was astonishing.¬†

Hundreds of blade auras did not inflict significant damage on Engert, reducing only about a quarter of his HP.

Of course, this was also due to the extraordinary effects of the Plate Armor Engert was wearing.¬†

It constantly flickered with light whenever he was under attack.

However, Sword Seven had not intended to defeat Engert with just that move.¬†

While Engert was crouching and defending against the blade aura assault, Sword Seven had already rushed to his front, swinging his giant sword heavily onto him.

"-782!"

Even so, the damage caused by Sword Seven was relatively minor, leaving him somewhat incredulous.

Yet, upon seeing Engert continuously in a defensive posture, Sword Seven used his waist to power a turn, swinging his giant sword again for another heavy hit on Engert.

Bang, bang, bang!

Engert, like a percussion instrument, produced loud and rhythmic sounds under the onslaught, compelling many of the watching awakened to involuntarily tap their feet!
