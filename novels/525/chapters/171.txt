Chapter 172 172-The Terrifying Draconic Magic Skill!

Despite the damage numbers appearing meager, Howard's heart surged with ecstasy!

Nearly a thousand points of damage indicated that Howard could now penetrate Cameron's defenses!

No matter how high Cameron's level or how exceptional his attributes, his HP could at best hover around a hundred thousand or so. 

After all, not everyone is like Howard, blessed with the augmentation from the Divine Dragon.

Twenty thousand HP might sound substantial, but in reality, without a healer, it's not much.

Consider, for instance, Howard's use of the 'Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess'. 

This skill lasts an incredibly long time, and coupled with its high frequency of attacks per second, it was more than capable of slaying Cameron.

Of course, this was under the assumption that Cameron would stand still, remaining within the range of the 'Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess' skill.

Another point to note is that the 'Soul Fusion' skill comes with its limitations. Given Howard's current physical state, he couldn't sustain it for too long.

Therefore, Howard wouldn't continuously use the 'Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess' skill.

This was a tactic he employed specifically for annihilating the ordinary soldiers. 

To confront Cameron, he needed to enter the Draconic state and unleash Draconic Magic.

With the formidable power of Draconic Magic, Cameron was sure to be cast into the depths of hell.

Cameron, fully aware of the terrifying implication of his defenses being breached, let out a fierce roar. 

He immediately swung his long spear towards the storm incarnation of Howard.

However, when the sharp blade of the spear, imbued with blazing flames, ferociously struck the continuously swirling storm, it was astonishingly deflected. 

The weapon's direction was reversed, viciously striking Cameron himself.

In an instant, Cameron was sent flying, coughing up blood profusely. Above his head, blood-red damage numbers emerged.

"-37882!"

Witnessing the nearly forty thousand points of damage, Howard couldn't help but feel a sense of relief, grateful for his wisdom in not giving Cameron the chance to strike his true form, opting instead to immediately use his skill.

Otherwise, once the immunity effect of his equipment ended, coupled with the disappearance of the protective amulet, receiving an attack from Cameron would have undoubtedly been fatal for Howard.

Fortunately, when deploying Annihilation of the Tempest Goddess, Howard himself entered a state where he was unattackable and untargetable, and he could even reflect back the damage he received.

As a result, it was Cameron who suffered a severe blow, with his HP plummeting by about a quarter.

Howard didn't continue to pursue Cameron but instead chased after the group of soldiers.

No matter how fast those soldiers were, how could they possibly outrun the movement speed of a storm?

Moreover, this skill continuously grew in power and range with time, reaching a peak state where it could affect an entire city.

Thus, it wasn't long before the soldiers were engulfed by the storm, their flesh relentlessly sliced by the fierce winds, blood spraying out like a rain of blood.

In a short span of time, their flesh was reduced to minced meat by the wind blades.

Witnessing this, Cameron's heart trembled, filled with panic. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although Howard still couldn't inflict severe damage on him, it was visibly evident that the damage was increasing. 

If Howard continued, Cameron wasn't sure he could withstand it.

Moreover, watching his own soldiers die under his command exerted a significant psychological pressure on Cameron.

The most frightening thing for a person is the eerie unknown!

On the surface, Howard's cultivation might seem inferior, but this is offset by his bizarre and potent skills!

Had it not been for Cameron summoning flames to envelop himself, shielding against the relentless, ravaging winds - and thus proving Howard still weaker - Cameron would have certainly contemplated fleeing.

However, as the damage numbers above his head steadily climbed, Cameron finally took note of the gradually intensifying storm manifested by Howard, and panic swiftly seeded in his heart.

He wanted to counter Howard, but Howard was in a special state, impervious to attacks. How could he then deal with this tempestuous skill?

Just as Cameron was engulfed in confusion, the rampaging wind blades beside him abruptly dissipated.

The colossal storm in the sky also gradually ceased, eventually reverting back to Howard in his golden armor.

Witnessing this, Cameron's pupils sharply constricted. He couldn't believe that Howard would voluntarily interrupt his skill at this crucial juncture!

Could it be that Howard's MP was insufficient to sustain the skill further?

Or perhaps... did Howard possess an even more enigmatic skill?

While his mind was awash with speculation, Cameron's actions didn't falter. 

Years of combat experience had him instantly vibrating his long spear, the flames blossoming like fireworks, before he surged towards Howard with incredible speed.

However, before the flames could reach Howard, a resounding dragon's roar suddenly filled the air. 

The golden dragon scale armor transformed once again. Howard's originally upright figure started to hunch, and a dragon tail emerged from his posterior.

It was the Draconic State!

"These are ... dragon claws ... dragon tail?!"

Although Cameron had never seen an Oriental Divine Dragon, he was familiar with Western dragons. 

Witnessing such distinct dragon characteristics, he couldn't help but be profoundly shocked, blurting out, "Could it be that you are a dragon transformed into the human form?"

Hearing Cameron's words, Howard's expression remained cold, offering no response. 

Instead, he directly executed the Draconic Magic skill - Thunder Dragon Domain!

Crackling and rumbling thunderclaps filled the air as countless bolts of lightning burst forth, instantly creating a domain that enveloped both Howard and Cameron.

Following that, a dragon composed entirely of thunder emerged. As soon as it appeared, it lunged towards Cameron with bared fangs and claws.

Facing a dragon for the first time, even someone as powerful as Cameron couldn't help but feel intimidated.

Taking advantage of this moment, Howard's MP slowly depleted, and he executed a second Draconic Magic skill - Thunder Dragon Roar.

Howard knew that Cameron would be extremely cautious at this point, so he couldn't afford to use skills with low hit chances.

With his current MP, a slow recovery would take considerable time. 

But since the Thunder Dragon Domain was continuously draining his MP, to quickly replenish it and use other skills, he needed to successfully hit Cameron, thereby triggering the health recovery effect of his equipment.

Thunder Dragon Breath, a breath-type skill, had a smaller coverage area and was easier to dodge.

Thus, Thunder Dragon Roar, being an instant-cast AOE skill, was more likely to hit its target, especially with Cameron entangled by the dragon of lightning. 

It would be much harder for him to avoid this attack.

Howard's guess was remarkably astute. 

Cameron, in fact, had been vigilantly monitoring Howard's every move. 

Witnessing Howard deploy his skill once again, Cameron instinctively retreated, eager to create distance between them.

Unfortunately for Cameron, he was unaware of the true extent of Howard's skill's reach. 

Even as he backed away, his speed was no match for the sweeping force of Howard's instantaneous skill.

In a mere instant, Cameron's body was engulfed in a cascade of lightning, forcefully hurled through the air. 

A number appeared above his head, a figure that sent a surge of excitement through Howard's veins - 

9782! 

Though not extraordinarily high, this number represented damage inflicted by Howard himself. 

It signified a steady increase in the damage dealt to Cameron, enhancing the likelihood of Cameron's defeat with each passing moment.

Following the momentous strike, Howard's MP saw a significant restoration. 

Seizing the opportunity while Cameron was still airborne and immobilized, Howard unleashed another ability from his repertoire - the Draconic Magic skill known as 'Thunderous Dragon Breath'.

Taking a deep breath beneath his mask, Howard opened his mouth. 

What followed was a spectacle of raw power: a vivid purple stream of lightning, like a pillar of light, burst forth, striking Cameron with unerring accuracy.

In that electrifying moment, Cameron's body convulsed uncontrollably, succumbing to paralysis and rendered incapable of movement.

"-1082!"

"-929!"

"-1327!"

"-1017!"

"..."

The Dragon Breath, inherently a continuous assault, inflicted consecutive bouts of damage. 

Each segment of the attack not only weakened Cameron further but also replenished a substantial amount of Howard's MP, fueling his relentless assault.

In just a few breaths, Cameron was paralyzed in place, unable to move. 

This allowed Howard to fully restore his MP.

Howard's lips curled into a smirk, and he immediately unleashed his final Draconic Magic skill - Thunderflame Dragon Wrath!

A deep rumble resonated as the skill was activated. Howard's body surged with both Electro and Pyro elements, distinctly different yet merging seamlessly within him.

At that moment, Howard felt an overwhelming surge of power coursing through him. 

Looking at Cameron, his gaze was cold and indifferent, as if staring down at an insignificant ant.

Sensing this piercing gaze, even the immobilized Cameron felt his heart rate slow. 

A premonition dawned upon him that he might not be a match for Howard in this state.
