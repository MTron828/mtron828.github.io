Chapter 173 173-Emergence of the Starry River Map

Howard imbued with the Thunderflame Dragon Wrath skill, wields two starkly different elemental forces within him. 

Even more formidable is the 500% increase in all his attributes!

But what does this truly entail?

It means that each of Howard's attacks inflicts damage twenty times the normal amount - a concept staggering in its potency.

Moreover, this amplification isn't limited to mere attack power, HP, or MP. 

It extends to speed, fundamentally altering the dynamics of combat.

In the blink of an eye, at speeds unfathomable, Howard's figure becomes a blur to Cameron. 

He scarcely perceives movement before feeling the intense heat of flames and the fury of thunderclaps, seemingly blossoming right upon his cheek.

With this terrifying burst of power, Cameron is sent flying, crashing heavily onto the ground.

A red imprint of a fist marks his cheek.

"-16272!"

An explosive damage figure of sixteen thousand points, enough to make Cameron reel in pain and drop his health by about a tenth.

Witnessing the staggering damage he's inflicted, Howard can't help but feel a sense of astonishment.

However, such fearsome damage comes at a steep price - a rapid depletion of MP values.

Under the dual strain of the Thunder Dragon Domain and Thunderflame Dragon Wrath skills, Howard's MP drains at an alarming rate, akin to a rollercoaster plummeting downwards.

In such a critical moment, Howard doesn't waste time pondering other matters. 

He launches into action, relentlessly assaulting Cameron with a barrage of attacks, each more fierce than the last.

Howard, learning from his previous mistake of talking too much, remained silent this time. 

He simply swung his fists, charged with two distinct elemental powers, relentlessly pounding Cameron's head.

Thud - 

After an indeterminate number of blows, Cameron's head burst open like a shattered balloon.

[Ding-dong! Congratulations Awakened Howard, you have successfully slain Cameron Bartel. Experience points reward: 20,000!]

Defeating a top-tier adversary above his own level brought Howard a substantial experience point reward. 

The system's notification confirming Cameron Bartel's demise eased the tension that had been gripping Howard's heart.

With the system's announcement, it was clear: Cameron was irrevocably dead, with no possibility of resurrection.

As the mental strain eased, Howard could no longer maintain the Draconic State and Soul Fusion. These states were not only draining his MP but also his spirit.

Had it not been for the dire threat to his life, forcing Howard into a state of heightened mental focus, he would have likely succumbed much earlier.

The golden glow faded away, and Howard returned to his normal state, though his ashen face was testament to the life-and-death battle he had just endured.

Truth be told, despite Howard's seemingly effortless use of several skills to vanquish Cameron, the process was fraught with peril.

Throughout the ordeal, a single misstep could have plunged Howard into an irreversible doom. 

Without the support of Draconic and Soul Fusion, Howard's current attributes meant that enduring even one attack from Cameron would spell certain death. 

The previous battle was akin to a high-wire act for Howard.

Even after successfully employing the Soul Fusion skill, Howard's strategic skill deployment was critical. 

He first activated Thunder Dragon Domain, using the summoned lightning dragons to divert Cameron's attention. 

Then, employing the instantaneous skill, Thunder Dragon Roar, he managed to knock Cameron off balance. 

Only at that juncture did the Thunderous Dragon Breath become a viable option, ensuring a hit with its high frequency of attacks and swiftly replenishing Howard's MP.

In essence, every move Howard made was the optimal solution in combat, the only path to victory. Any deviation from this strategy would have resulted in failure.

Fortunately, Howard withstood the pressure and did not panic, flawlessly executing his skills to subdue Cameron until death.

Breathing a sigh of relief, Howard waited for his MP to partially recover before brandishing his wand. 

He conjured a fireball and hurled it at Cameron's corpse, instantly engulfing it in flames.

Once a person dies, their innate power gradually dissipates. 

Cameron's physical body, devoid of its former strength, stood no chance against the relentless fire. 

It wasn't long before his remains were reduced to ashes.

As the gentle breeze stirred, Howard's gaze was caught by the glimmer of a Space Ring, the sole remnant in the aftermath of the battle.

Swiftly picking up the ring, Howard was about to probe its contents when a sharp pain shot through his head, akin to being pricked by needles.

"This must be the Space Ring's protective restriction," he mused. "I'll have to ask Master to break it. Ah, Cameron, a man of nobility, his Space Ring is bound to be filled with treasures."

The thought brought a sly smile to Howard's face. 

In this dog-eat-dog world, what could be a quicker path to power than seizing the spoils from the fallen? 

The riches owned by a powerhouse like Cameron were undoubtedly valuable.

Regrettably, in his battle with Cameron, Howard had exhausted his most potent skills - the SSS-level and Draconic Magic abilities. 

"If the Starry River Map emerges soon, I'll have few skills left at my disposal," he pondered.

"I just hope my next adversary is weaker. Otherwise, failing to secure the Starry River Map would be embarrassingly disappointing, especially after Master's unwavering confidence in me."

With a resigned shake of his head, Howard acknowledged the necessity of his actions. 

Using those ultimate skills was a matter of survival. Compared to the threat of death, the importance of the Starry River Map seemed lesser.

Nonetheless, Howard remained confident in his chances, especially with the aid of Rick and other strong allies. 

These were powerhouses above level 90, capable of manipulating circumstances to his advantage. 

With such top-tier forces backing him, securing the Starry River Map should be considerably easier.

Such was the advantage of having formidable allies.

Gathering his thoughts, Howard stored Cameron's Space Ring in his own and swiftly retraced his steps, his mind already strategizing his next moves in this treacherous game of power.

Fortunately, the formidable aura unleashed by Howard's skills while in the state of Soul Fusion had a daunting effect on the nearby skeletal monsters. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Even the slumbering bosses were stirred, binding the creatures in the vicinity and posing no threat to Howard.

Before long, the cautious Howard found himself back in the territory of the skeletal monsters below level 70. 

Facing these lesser adversaries, Howard finally felt a sense of relief, confident in his ability to confront them.

However, at that moment, the nearby mountains began to tremble violently.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

It was as if an earthquake had erupted. The thunderous roar that ensued caused the entire mountain range to quiver. 

Even Howard, with his robust physique, swayed unsteadily, unable to maintain his balance.

"What's happening?" he wondered, concern etching his features. "Could it be that a top-tier BOSS is awakening?"

Howard knew that the Dark Mausoleum harbored some extremely powerful bosses, and this thought sent a wave of apprehension through him. 

Most of his skills were currently cooling down, and even the Soul Fusion ability couldn't be deployed again so soon. 

Without the capacity to unleash his full power, Howard felt uneasy at the prospect of encountering a top-tier BOSS at such a time.

As Howard furrowed his brows in worry, the moon in the sky began to shine even more brightly.

The next moment, moonlight poured down like liquid, casting a luminous sheen directly upon the mountains.

Boom! 

The mountain range exploded suddenly, followed by the gentle sound of flowing water. 

Amidst the illumination of the moonlight, a scroll slowly rose and hovered in the air.

"This... could this possibly be the Starry River Map?!" 

In that moment, as stars twinkled and adorned the scroll, Howard and all the nearby awakened widened their eyes in realization. 

The Starry River Map had emerged!

Instantly, countless awakened let out roars of excitement.

Many of the awakened, especially those above level 70 or possessing the ability to fly, sprang into action, rapidly moving towards the Starry River Map floating in the sky.

However, before they could get close, the silvery-white moonlight falling from above sliced through the air like blades, striking all the awakened who attempted to approach the map.

A series of crisp sounds echoed, followed by spurts of blood. 

The group of awakened screamed in agony as they were violently repelled backward.

This scene caused a collective gasp among the onlookers. 

They immediately realized that the Starry River Map was currently under the influence of some mysterious power.

To obtain the Starry River Map, one would have to break through this enigmatic force.

Meanwhile, back in the dilapidated palace where Howard had previously been, Glutton, Ice Ghost, and Old Smokey abruptly stood up, their gazes fixed on the sky, eyes filled with hesitation and doubt.

"It's impossible. The Starry River Map was supposed to emerge the night after tomorrow. How could it appear ahead of schedule?"

"Hiss... It seems like some special force has triggered the Starry River Map!"

"Something's off. To possess power on par with that contained within the Starry River Map, how could it be within the Dark Mausoleum? Unless... has an awakened nearby used a skill beyond the SS-level?"
