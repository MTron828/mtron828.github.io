Chapter 241 241-The Greedy Mercenaries

At that moment, Kellman hadn't realized what Howard was planning to do.

A glint of coldness flashed in Howard's eyes as he said, "Kellman, you understand that this matter must not be exposed, right?"

Staring into Howard's eyes, Kellman shivered.

After these days of interaction, he understood too well what that look in Howard's eyes meant.

It was the look of someone ready to kill, reminiscent of the time when Tina was bullied by the Empire Knights Order.

"You're planning to kill them? But they're innocent!"¬†

Kellman couldn't let such an act happen.

Integrity was vital, especially among mercenaries.

Promising payment for a job and then betraying them after the deed was done ‚Äì that was unthinkable.

"Brother Howard!" Kellman's voice was stern as he stared intently at Howard.

He could overlook past incidents as they were acts of necessity, but now he would not yield.

"These are men I brought. You can't kill them. If you insist on doing so, then please take my and Tina's lives as well!"

Howard sighed.

"Leader Kellman, what are you saying? You and Tina have both saved my life; how could I possibly kill you? Since you find it inappropriate, I won't touch them."

With Kellman so protective of his men, Howard reluctantly decided to let the matter go.

He hoped these men would be trustworthy.

After parting ways with the others, Chris couldn't help but say, "My lord, we can't let those men go. Sedge was backed by an even greater power."

Although Chris was technically a slave, she didn't accept this fact in her heart, and therefore didn't address Howard as 'master'.

Howard himself lacked a sense of master-servant mentality, so he didn't mind.

After Chris spoke, Howard, who had initially decided not to harm the mercenaries, found himself deep in thought again.

Should he really risk their lives? A flicker of resolve crossed his eyes, but soon, recalling Kellman's words, he felt compelled to abandon the thought.

"Let it be," Howard finally said.

"If I do this, how am I any different from people like Sedge? If the truth ever comes out in the future, I'll find another way. Right now, these men are innocent. I can't kill them just because they might betray me in the future."

Chris stared at Howard, surprised, finding his reasoning very sound.

...

Meanwhile, Keadwyn, anxiously waiting outside the city, had yet to receive any news from Sedge.

Logically speaking, with the Empire Knights Order ruling the city, it shouldn't have taken Sedge long to eliminate a few targets.

But now, dawn was breaking...

"Boss, something's wrong!" a spy Keadwyn had sent into the city reported back.

"Boss, Sedge is dead!"

"What? What did you say?"¬†

Keadwyn couldn't believe his ears.

He thought he had misheard.

The Vice-Commander of the Empire Knights Order, favored by the Duke of the capital, holding sway over half the city, was dead just like that?

"The Vice-Commander of the Empire Knights Order, Sedge, is dead!" the spy repeated, and Keadwyn was forced to accept the reality.

This spy was his confidant, unlikely to lie, and such significant news must have been thoroughly verified.

With Sedge's death at this juncture, it couldn't be unrelated to Kellman.

"That Sedge, such a waste, to die at the hands of a mere Kellman," Kaedwyn muttered in disbelief.

"What do we do now?"

Gazing into the night sky, gritting his teeth, he steeled himself and said, "Prepare six carts full of treasures. We'll go to the agreed place tomorrow."¬†

Kaedwyn had decided to compromise; there seemed no other option left.

He had to admit that he had underestimated Kellman and his associates' capabilities.

Even if Sedge was incompetent, he wasn't easy to kill, especially with the Four Knights around, whom even Kaedwyn wasn't sure he could defeat.

Now, the best course of action was to follow the instructions in the letter.

However, his subordinates were less enthusiastic about this plan.

Six carts of treasures represented their long-term savings, to be given away just like that?¬†

But they were all Kaedwyn's trusted men, and he had treated them well over the years.

Seeing their leader making such a sacrifice to save his father, they had little to complain about.

Sensing his men's reluctance, Kaedwyn sighed and said, "I know you brothers have been through a lot with me over the years.

Consider this as a debt I, Kaedwyn, owe you."

"Boss, don't say that. For the sake of saving the old man, what are these worldly possessions worth!"

"Exactly!"

While Kaedwyn believed Kellman and Howard were only after wealth, in reality, Howard had even contemplated killing him.

...

The next day, as the appointed time arrived, Howard and Kellman, along with their group, were already waiting.

Kellman brought the same men as the day before, and Howard instructed Chris to keep a close watch on them.

If they showed any suspicious behavior, she was to act without seeking his approval first.

Howard had Chris wear a helmet to prevent Kaedwyn from recognizing her, aiming for a surprise attack on him.

As time passed, Kellman remarked, "Could it be that Kaedwyn won't show up?"

"He will," Howard confidently assured.

They waited a bit longer until they finally saw a caravan slowly approaching, led by Kaedwyn himself.

Kaedwyn had initially not planned to exchange the treasures for the hostages, which was why he had rushed back the previous night to prepare, causing a slight delay.

Howard was certain that by now, Kaedwyn knew of Sedge's death and would be highly vigilant, evident from the dozens of elite troops he brought with him.

However, as long as he was unaware of Chris's presence, Howard believed they still had a chance.

Upon arriving, Kaedwyn glanced at Howard, standing at the forefront, with suspicion.

He thought to himself, could this young man be the mastermind behind everything?¬†

Even Kellman was obediently standing behind him‚Ä¶

Without saying a word, Kaedwyn gestured to his men to bring the caravan forward.

Howard asked Chris to check the boxes in the wagons to ensure they were filled with treasures.

As Chris opened each box, everyone, including her, was stunned.

The chests full of gold coins, jewels, and silverware shone dazzlingly in the sunlight.

The mercenaries Kellman had brought were especially astonished.

They had never seen, nor even dreamed of, such wealth in their lifetimes.

It was unbelievable that Kellman was involved in such a deal.

When the stakes are high enough, there are always those who will take risks, and this was exactly what Howard was concerned about.

If he didn't need the manpower, he wouldn't have allowed anyone other than Kellman, Tina, and Chris to come along.Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

He wasn't worried about Chris betraying him; the thought wouldn't even cross her mind.

Besides, she was Howard's slave, her life hanging on his whim.

After confirming that there were no issues, Howard released the hostages.

At this moment, Chris, escorting an elderly man, approached.

Kaedwyn, upon seeing his father unharmed, breathed a sigh of relief.

His gaze then shifted to Chris.

Something about her seemed familiar, but with the helmet and armor, he couldn't recognize her.

Thus, he relaxed his guard, mistaking her for an ordinary warrior, and hurried over to greet his father.

The old man, unaware of Howard's plan to kill Kaedwyn, was prepared to witness his son's death.

He had long anticipated such an outcome, knowing all too well Kaedwyn's character.

Yet, when Kaedwyn rushed over eagerly, the old man found himself hesitating in his resolve, feeling a pang of unwillingness.

His mouth was gagged, unable to speak, but he tried to warn Kaedwyn with his eyes not to come closer.

Kaedwyn, who knew his father well, instantly sensed danger.

He looked around but found nothing amiss.

Where was the threat?

In his moment of confusion, Chris had already closed in on Kaedwyn.

In a swift motion, she drew her sword and struck.

Chris's strikes were always clean and forceful, and this time she exerted her full strength.

Kaedwyn was cleaved in two, falling lifelessly to the ground.

The onlookers were shocked beyond belief.

Kaedwyn had just died like that?

"True to her orcish bloodline, Chris is terrifying," someone murmured.

The mercenaries, who had been eyeing the six carts of treasures, began to weigh their options, considering whether the risk was worth taking.

"Boss!"¬†

The men Kaedwyn had brought with him, undoubtedly loyal to him, charged towards Chris upon seeing him killed, seeking vengeance.

"Let's help them out, brothers!" Kellman and Tina quickly moved to assist.

However, the mercenaries hesitated, not following suit.

Their eyes lingered on the six carts filled with treasures.

This was the perfect opportunity.

With Chris engaged and potentially overwhelmed by Kaedwyn's men, her survival was uncertain.

Kellman and Tina were also tied up in the fight, leaving only Howard.

They had witnessed Howard's strength, which, while not weak, was not particularly exceptional compared to theirs.

"Brothers, fortune favors the bold," one of the mercenaries said, his eyes shining with a sharp light.

The others immediately understood his implication.

Even if they completed this job with Kellman, they would only receive a few dozen gold coins at most.

But now, there were millions of gold coins, perhaps even more, within their grasp.
