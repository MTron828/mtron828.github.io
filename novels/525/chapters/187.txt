Chapter 188 188-Starry River Map, Synthesis!

"Huh?"

At these words, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask, now revealed to be Monica, turned in surprise towards Ice Ghost, examining him closely.

"So it's Grandfather Three. I apologize for not recognizing you earlier."

Faced with an elder, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask, now known as Monica, didn't dare to keep her mask on.¬†

She quickly removed it, revealing a beautiful and delicate face.

In fact, had Ice Ghost not spoken up, Monica would never have recognized him.

It couldn't be helped; Ice Ghost held such a high status in the family!

His position was so elevated that even a direct descendant like Monica Alva had to address him as grandfather.

Furthermore, Ice Ghost had been absent from the family for a long time, with only a single photograph of him placed in the family shrine.

Although Monica had seen the photo, it was decades old.¬†

She instinctively overlooked the possibility that the man before her could be Ice Ghost.Gett your ùíáavorite ùíèovels at no/v/e/lbùíän(.)com

Only after being reprimanded by Ice Ghost, who spoke with the authority of an older and much-respected elder, did she think of Ice Ghost's identity.

Even so, Monica Alva was still astounded. She couldn't believe that her family had such a top-tier powerhouse capable of retaining a youthful appearance.

Hearing Monica Alva's words, Pallor Swift finally let out a sigh of relief.¬†

Since their Holy Maiden was related to one of the top-tier powerhouses in this way, perhaps he wouldn't have to face death.

Howard, too, was surprised and curiously observed the interaction between Ice Ghost and Monica.

"Hmm." Ice Ghost's demeanor towards Monica, his junior, was not particularly affectionate.¬†

In fact, he seemed quite indifferent to everyone.

Even towards Howard, his tone was always calm, though the gifts he had given to Howard were exceptionally valuable.

And that skill he had given was incredibly useful!

"I never expected Monica to be related to Uncle Master Ice Ghost. I should work on building a good relationship with her in the future."

"It seems their family must also be quite powerful."

Howard nodded slightly to himself.

"Alright, let's not dwell on that. Finally, this matter is concluded."

Rick took out the Starry River Map and handed it to Howard, smiling, "This is yours now. You snatched it from the crowd, and now you truly own it!"

Taking the Starry River Map, Howard couldn't help feeling excited.

Monica, with her sparkling, curious eyes, was also eager to see what effects the Starry River Map would have.

"We'll guard you while you do this," Rick said with a smile. "Go ahead."

Hearing this, Howard glanced at Sword Seven, giving him an apologetic look, then firmly clenched his fists and unfurled the Starry River Map.

Whoosh‚Äî

The sound of flowing water rang crisply in his ears as a deep blue starlight engulfed the space in front of Howard.

At that moment, Howard's vision was devoid of Rick and the others, as well as the stone platform.¬†

All that existed were countless twinkling stars.

Deep and endless, the vista evoked a sense of insignificance.

Howard could distinctly feel his entire body trembling.

With a sudden roar, a loud dragon's cry echoed through the heavens, and the phantom of a golden Oriental Divine Dragon appeared, actively moving about in this starry expanse.

Howard felt as if his soul had taken flight, soaring higher and higher, until he completely merged with the starry sky.

[Ding! Congratulations to awakened Howard for successfully merging with the Starry River Map and activating all its abilities!]

As the crisp system notification sound rang out, Howard finally came back to his senses.

His body shuddered abruptly.¬†

Where was the starry sky he had just seen?¬†

It was merely an unfurled scroll laid out before him

Now, the scroll displayed only a background pattern of stars, nothing more.

Monica, surprised, said, "You're finally awake. What were you looking at for over half an hour? There's really nothing much to see here!"

"Half an hour has passed already?"

Howard was taken aback.

Rick, Glutton, and the others exchanged glances and then smiled, "The Starry River Map, being a Supreme Treasure, creates a mental impact on the one who opens it. Only an awakened who withstands this impact is qualified to merge with it."

"We prevented everyone from fighting over it for this reason. If we had allowed a chaotic battle for possession, surely someone would have tried to activate the Starry River Map first. Entering that state while under attack would have been suicidal."

Rick chuckled, "So, did it succeed?"

"It did!"

Howard nodded, "I'll check it carefully now to see what effects it has."

With that, Howard began to examine the attributes of the Starry River Map in detail.

[Starry River Map ‚Äî‚Äî Supreme Treasure]

[Level: 1]

[Grade: Mythical]

[Equipment Attribute Bonuses:]

1. Allows the choice to become one of four classes: Stellar Swordsman, Stellar Magus, Solitary Stellar Marksman, or Stellar Paladin.

2. When under the starry sky, receive the empowerment of the power of stellar, increasing all attributes by 20%.

3. When under the starry sky, receive the nourishment of the power of stellar, gaining 100 experience points per second.

4. When under the starry sky, receive the cultivation of the power of stellar; every 100 seconds, gain 1 point of vitality, and every 600 seconds, gain 1 point each in strength, wisdom, HP, and MP.

5. When under the starry sky, capable of casting on a single target, sealing them within the Starry River Map, preventing escape. If the target fails to break free from the Starry River Map within 300 minutes, they will die, and the essence of their blood and flesh will transform into the purest power, nourishing the holder.

6. Stellar Realm: Upon activation, creates a starry sky scene, which can activate the aforementioned effects. Additionally, within this starry sky scene, any hostile targets are suppressed, reducing their all attributes by 10%.

"!!!"

Six attributes, four passive, all incredibly powerful, even offering unlimited enhancement of Howard's attributes and level.

With the Starry River Map, even without grinding for levels, Howard could steadily advance.

The active skill of the map allowed Howard to seal a target within the Starry River Map.¬†

If the target didn't escape in time, they would be killed, and their flesh and blood would transform into power for the holder.¬†

Though it sounded somewhat eerie, Howard knew this was a significant boon to his own power.

As for the Stellar Realm ability, it would allow Howard to fight in a home ground scenario at any time.

"Phew, truly worthy of being a Supreme Treasure.¬†

These attributes are insanely powerful. I love it!"

"But how should I choose among those four classes?"

Howard furrowed his brows, feeling quite hesitant.

Stellar Swordsman, Stellar Magus, Solitary Stellar Marksman, Stellar Paladin.

From the names of the classes, it was apparent that they represented physical close combat, magical ranged combat, a likely combination of assassin and archer for the Solitary Stellar Marksman, and possibly a combination of shield bearer and priest for the Stellar Paladin.

"Even though my magus class isn't a hidden class, my Supreme Synthesis talent allows me to learn mythical skills even in a standard class. So, Stellar Magus won't add much to my abilities."

"Stellar Swordsman is just that, a swordsman! Both Solitary Stellar Marksman and Stellar Paladin have dual functions. It seems choosing Solitary Stellar Marksman might be better. Coincidentally, I've also learned the Spirit Veil Skill, which should pair well with the Solitary Stellar Marksman."

Eventually, Howard made his choice: Solitary Stellar Marksman!

[Ding! Congratulations to awakened Howard for successfully becoming a special hidden class ‚Äî Solitary Stellar Marksman!]

[Ding! Since awakened Howard has already mastered a stealth-related skill, the new skill Moonlight Stealth will merge with Spirit Veil Skill to form a new ability. Do you wish to confirm?]

"Hmm?! Skills of a similar nature can actually merge together?"

Seeing this prompt, Howard's eyes lit up with excitement, and he quickly chose to confirm.

[Ding! Congratulations to awakened Howard, you have successfully mastered the SSS-level skill ‚Äî Stellar Stealth!]

"This... it directly advanced to an SSS-level skill?!"

Howard was so excited that his breathing quickened.

An SSS-level skill, even if it was just a supportive type, would undoubtedly have astonishing effects.¬†

This instantly filled Howard with anticipation. Just the first skill had brought him such a huge surprise.

What kind of powerful skills would he comprehend next?

[Ding! Congratulations to awakened Howard, you have successfully mastered the S-level active skill ‚Äî Celestial Descent!]

[Ding! Congratulations to awakened Howard, you have successfully mastered the S-level active skill ‚Äî Supreme Star Dominion!]

[Ding! Congratulations to awakened Howard, you have successfully mastered the SS-level active skill ‚Äî Celestial Annihilation Arrow!]
