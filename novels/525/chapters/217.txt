Chapter 218 Chapter218-A Plot? Breaking Through the Siege!

However, Howard was uncertain about how to activate such a teleportation crystal array, having no knowledge of Celestial Ore.

Fortunately, Aurelia decisively said, "To activate the teleportation crystal array, we just need to infuse it with spiritual power or magic. Let's do it!"

With Aurelia taking the initiative, Howard no longer hesitated.

He pulled her forward and channeled his power into the jade of the teleportation array.

Although Howard's cultivation system was different from that of the Obscured Celestial Realm, the essence of power was the same.

The jade was activated, beginning to flicker and promptly teleporting both Howard and Aurelia away.

Meanwhile, back in the secret chamber, the blue-robed man took out the Delusion Breaking Disc.

However, before he could use it, the woman in the wolf-head mask spoke up, "No need. Aurelia and her guard have already used the teleportation array to go to the mines."

"What?!"

Hearing the words of the masked woman, the blue-robed man's expression changed drastically.

He quickly responded, "They entered this room? How is that possible! The guards at the main door are Level 70 Cultivators. How could they possibly get in?"

"‚Ä¶"

The woman in the wolf-head mask glanced at the blue-robed man and said indifferently, "Send the message. Dispatch a few people to pursue them and deliberately leak some information to them. Make sure they return to Stormwind City alive!"

"Yes, Lady, I will see to it immediately!"

The blue-robed man, not daring to meet the gaze of the wolf-head masked woman, bowed his head and retreated, leaving the secret chamber.

After the blue-robed man left, the woman in the wolf-head mask softly mused, "Interesting. Judging by Aurelia's gaze, that fellow doesn't seem like a mere guard. And how could a guard possess such strength? Even I couldn't penetrate his Invisibility skill and could only sense their presence using my Power of Soul."

"If we could persuade him to join us, spreading the use of that Invisibility skill, wouldn't we possess the capability to assassinate high-ranking officials of the Empire?"

"‚Ä¶"

Unbeknownst to Howard, their presence had already been detected by the woman in the wolf-head mask, nor was he aware of her new plans.

Transported through space, Howard and Aurelia's figures appeared in a new location.

Immediately, the sound of clanging and banging filled their ears.

Howard and Aurelia looked around, realizing they were now in a mine, surrounded by dust and debris.

Before them, over a hundred individuals were laboring intensely, shirtless, wielding pickaxes and hammers, extracting light purple ore.

Their arrival seemed to have no impact on the workers, who continued their arduous toil, sweating profusely.

"Hmm? What kind of ore is this? Could it be the Shattered Stellar Ore the woman mentioned?"

Aurelia was no fool. Seeing the purple ore, she immediately connected it to Shattered Stellar Ore.

Unfortunately, with only Howard and Aurelia present, even if they had discovered a new mine, they were powerless to do anything about it.

In fact, their immediate concern was to find a way to leave as soon as possible.

"Hey, why are you two just standing up there? Not coming down?"

"Did Lady send any instructions?"

These sudden words echoed from nearby, and a muscular man, as burly as a bear, approached Howard and Aurelia.

Startled by the unexpected voice, Howard and Aurelia instantly tensed up.

They were about to turn around when the man spoke again, "Wait, that's not right. Lady never allows women into the mine. You aren't sent by her!"

"Enemy attack! Enemy attack!"

With his sharp cry, the nearby miners were alarmed, their attention shifting toward them.

Realizing their cover was blown, Howard understood they couldn't hide their identities anymore.

Taking advantage of the fact that the miners weren't particularly strong, he stepped forward and conjured a dozen wind blades, slashing them in different directions.

Especially towards the muscular man, Howard sent three wind blades his way, colliding with him to prevent any approach towards Howard and Aurelia.

At that moment, Howard swiftly pulled out a short-range spatial teleportation scroll from his backpack.

With a swift tear, Howard and Aurelia's figures were enveloped and then vanished in a flash of white light, just as the wind blades shattered.

Dozens of miners, wielding their pickaxes, charged towards where Howard and Aurelia had been, only to find them gone, their faces registering shock.

"Teleportation? No, the teleportation crystal array didn't flash. It must be short-range teleportation using an artifact!"

"Quick, inform the Elders about this!"

"Also, light up a signal flare to alert our brothers to capture those two! We absolutely cannot allow the news of the mine to be leaked!"

...

The successive spatial teleportations left Aurelia violently vomiting the moment they reappeared, her body convulsing uncontrollably.

Inevitably, Aurelia's strength was too weak, her physique unable to bear the tearing sensation of space.

One teleportation might have been manageable, but continuous teleporting had rendered her incapacitated.

At that moment, a large point of light suddenly soared into the sky nearby, bursting open and illuminating the entire area with its brilliant radiance.

"This is bad, that must be their signal flare. We need to leave quickly!"

Howard glanced at Aurelia and immediately scooped her into his arms, then charged forward with all his might towards the direction ahead.

Right now, Howard's sole objective was to evade their pursuers, not to return to Stormwind City!

At least not until they were safe, only then could he consider changing their course.

Moreover, the current situation was somewhat favorable for Howard.

He secretly wished to spend more time with Aurelia, hoping to spark some romantic feelings.

As for Stano?

He was indifferent to whether Stano was deceived or able to retain his position as city lord.

After all, given Stano's family status, obtaining information about the Obscured Celestial Realm was entirely feasible.

Other concerns were irrelevant to Howard.

With this in mind, Howard began to flee without even considering the direction.

However, the teleportation distance of the scroll was too short.

Howard and Aurelia were still within the boundaries of the mine, only having moved from inside the mine to a forest above it.

Unfortunately, the forest was also patrolled by the same faction.

Upon seeing the signal flare, they immediately entered a state of high alert.

Everyone was ready for battle, with their jade-crafted armor and equipment flickering with light, primed to unleash their power.

It wasn't long before Howard burst out of the forest, only to be met with the sight of at least a hundred people.

"Enemy attack!"

"There really are intruders, attack!"

The group had been waiting for some time and launched their assault almost the instant they saw Howard.

Weapons crafted from jade glinted menacingly, with dozens of blade auras and whooshing arrows aimed directly at Howard.

Others wielded wands or crystal balls made of jade, chanting incantations, as dense elemental forces converged from all directions.

Fortunately, Howard had previously cast a wind blade spell, creating a protective shield around him.

He tightly embraced Aurelia, using his body and the shield to block the barrage of attacks.

Despite the shield absorbing much of the damage, Howard still felt a burning pain on his back.

If not for his formidable physique, just these few attacks would have exhausted him.

After enduring the onslaught, Howard also realized the advantage of the jade-crafted weapons.

Their attacks carried a persistent force that continuously eroded flesh and blood.

It was only due to Howard's extraordinary physical strength, coupled with the characteristics of his Draconic State, which granted him remarkable self-healing abilities, that his wounds began to heal within a few breaths.

However, the strange power of the attacks made Howard wary of being hit again.

Without waiting for the magus group to finish their incantations, he swiftly executed the Roar of the Fire God skill.

Boom‚Äî

The advantage of quick skill release became evident.

Even though Howard started later, he acted faster, releasing his skill successfully before the magus group could react.

A loud explosion resonated, as scorching flames burst forth from Howard's body.

The powerful wave of heat enveloped everyone nearby, the intense high temperature instantly engulfing them. ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

Jade-crafted armors indeed provided comprehensive defense, and their defense was related to the wearer's own strength.

However, they had a weakness: they couldn't isolate elements.

Therefore, as the blistering heat enveloped them, sweat immediately began to bead on their faces.

Following that, a phantom image of a fire god appeared behind Howard.

The group had never seen such a skill before.

The sudden appearance of a gigantic figure, emanating an immensely terrifying power, left them completely stunned.

"What the heck is this?"

"How can there be a person made entirely of fire?"

"Hiss‚Ä¶ Could that be a deity?"

"Gulp! Why do I feel an urge to kneel before this figure?"

Sounds of swallowing nervously filled the air as the group was utterly shocked by the fire god's phantom, forgetting to attack or defend.

In the next moment, under Howard's control, the phantom of the fire god let out a roar towards the sky.

Boom‚Äî

The powerful sound waves, mixed with searing flames, struck the people like cannonballs.
