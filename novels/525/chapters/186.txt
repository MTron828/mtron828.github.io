Chapter 187 187-The Finale

﻿

Howard's expression gradually became more resolute as he decided to use the Shattered Timepiece. 

This artifact had the ability to slow down the flow of time within its sphere of influence. 

In other words, as soon as Howard activated the Shattered Timepiece, the passage of time for other awakened within the area would seem incredibly slow from his perspective, including their thoughts and movements.

"If your reaction speed also becomes sluggish, I refuse to believe that the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask can still dodge my attacks!" he thought.

Taking a deep breath, without any hesitation, Howard decisively activated the Shattered Timepiece.

In an instant, his MP value began to plummet rapidly, and the space around him, in his eyes, also underwent a sudden change.

The ongoing discussions and noise of the battle around him completely disappeared. 

All the awakened stood frozen in place, motionless, without a sound.

The woman with the eight-eyed devil mask appeared the same in Howard's view, utterly unable to move.

"Hisss... Is the effect of this artifact really that powerful? They say it slows down time, but it looks like they can't even speak, as if they're frozen in place. It seems like a long time passes for me, while in reality, only a single breath has passed?"

Howard's pupils dilated, a realization dawning on him.

He glanced up at Rick, Glutton, and others, noticing that they too showed hardly any movement. 

The profound impact of the Shattered Timepiece's powerful effect struck him even more intensely.

However, there was a noticeable change in the expressions of Rick and the others.

With a significant disparity in strength, it seemed the effect of the artifact was substantially reduced.

Additionally, since Rick and his companions were familiar with Howard and hadn't activated their spiritual power in defense, the Shattered Timepiece activated by Howard probably wouldn't have affected them much under other circumstances.

Observing the rapid depletion of his MP value, Howard knew he couldn't delay any longer. 

He needed a swift and decisive victory. 

Leaping high, he swung his wand and executed the skill – Death Six-Step Throw – on the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask.

At this moment, even her thoughts were controlled by the altered flow of time, rendering her incapable of reacting. 

Naturally, Howard seized her arm and repeatedly slammed her to the ground.

Regrettably, none of the awakened witnessed this scene.

Only after Howard had completed the six consecutive throws, and the woman with the mask appeared dazed and confused, did he deactivate the Shattered Timepiece.

In an instant, the flow of time returned to normal.

The scene before the eyes of the many awakened seemed as though it had shifted through time. 

Just a moment ago, Howard was locked in fierce combat with the woman, and in the blink of an eye, she was on the ground, unconscious.

While they were filled with hesitation, Howard let out a sigh of relief.

He had finally defeated the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask!

Setting other things aside, she was undoubtedly the strongest of the younger generation Howard had ever encountered.

Had Howard not recently acquired a host of advantages, he might not have been a match for her.

Glutton and the others, aware that Howard had used the Shattered Timepiece, were not overly surprised. 

They simply smiled and said, "Now that Howard is the only one standing at the end, is there anyone among you who dares to challenge him?"

Hearing Glutton's words, the many awakened exchanged glances, and then, almost in unison, they all took a step back.

Judging by Howard's recent display, which left them clueless as to what had actually transpired, it was evident that his strength far surpassed theirs. 

Therefore, none dared to step up for another challenge.

Moreover, considering that just a plainly dressed man had managed to brutalize them, and now Howard had directly defeated a higher-tier opponent with ease, how could they recklessly challenge him?

Sighs echoed among the strong representatives of various factions.

"Since no one else dares to challenge, the Starry River Map shall belong to Howard. Should I learn that any of you dare to attack Howard in secret and attempt to take the Starry River Map, we, the few of us, will personally visit your families to deliver them to Howard and demand an explanation!"

Upon hearing this, the gathered awakened couldn't help but inhale sharply.

That was harsh!

As harsh as it was, not a single awakened dared to speak up, their hearts faltering.

With several top-tier powerhouses above level 90, all from the inner circle of the Alliance, who would dare to provoke them? 

Angering such individuals was unwise unless one was prepared to abandon their family and clan.

Glancing around and noticing the expressions of the many awakened, Howard couldn't help but smile. 

It seemed that even if news of the Starry River Map being in his possession spread, he could rest easy now.

Apart from being cautious of potentially reckless mercenaries, he didn't have much to worry about. 

Moreover, Howard was still a student. 

As long as he returned to Adia City and stayed within the academy, who could harm him?

"Alright, everyone disperse," came the words of Rick, Glutton, and others. 

With this, the gathered awakened began to leave.

It was then that the group suddenly realized the plainly dressed man who had been lying unconscious beneath the stage had vanished.

"Hey, where did that jerk go?"

"I was thinking of teaching him a lesson for his arrogance. How did he just disappear?"

"What the fuck!"

"Chase him, dig three feet into the ground if you have to, but find him!"

"Ugh, such an annoying pest."

Curses and complaints filled the air as the awakened fumed with frustration, yet there was nothing they could do but silently depart.

It had to be said, the plainly dressed man was incredibly clever!

He knew that many would be focused on the battle between Howard and the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask. 

By feigning unconsciousness and then slipping away when attention was diverted from him, he executed a perfect escape.

After all, with no chance of getting the Starry River Map, staying would have likely meant his demise!

In a short while, only Howard, Rick and his group, Sword Seven, and the members of the Solomon Sacred Assembly remained on the stone platform.

Once everyone else had left, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask, who had been feigning unconsciousness, opened her eyes and languidly said, "You really don't know how to be tender towards women."

"I'm curious, what trick did you use to catch me off guard and cause me internal injuries without me noticing?"

Even with the mask on, the determination in the woman's eyes was evident.

Howard shook his head and replied, "Tha's my special ability, and I prefer to keep it to myself."

After a moment of silence, the woman with the mask suddenly changed the subject with a laugh, "We had a bet earlier. If you had lost, you would have married me. Now that you've won, I'll take the loss and marry you."

At her words, Pallor Swif's mouth twitched.

The Holy Maiden of his order had seen many handsome and powerful men before and had never been the type to act so infatuated. 

Why was she persistently clinging to Howard today?

Could it be that just having a handsome face allowed one to do whatever they pleased?

"I never agreed to that bet," Howard replied calmly, declining the offer.

Unbeknownst to him, this response made the woman with the mask grit her teeth in frustration.

Pallor Swift spoke up coldly, "This is the Holy Maiden of our Solomon Sacred Assembly. Show some respect, young man!"

"Tsk, tsk, tsk, Holy Maiden or not, since when does my disciple, Rick's apprentice, need to act according to your wishes?"

Rick snorted coldly, and in an instant, a tremendous pressure descended, forcing Pallor Swif's knees to buckle, making him involuntarily kneel before Howard.

Fear surged in his mind. Had he actually just threatened the disciple of a top-tier powerhouse?

The realization that Howard had also been accepted into the Holy Abyss Academy left Pallor Swift utterly stunned. 

What kind of talent did Howard possess to be taken in by both a top-tier academy and a top-tier powerhouse simultaneously?

Normally, to preserve the purity of their students, elite academies do not allow them to join any other organizations or take another as their master, to prevent any betrayal of the academy.

Similarly, the disciples of top-tier powerhouses are usually groomed to inherit their mantle and not to learn from others.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

These two paths are generally conflicting!

Yet, Howard had achieved this, backed not only by a top-tier force but also having a powerful master.

Even the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask was astounded. 

Ignoring Howard's indifference towards her, she walked up to his side, attempting to link her arm with his.

Unfortunately for her, Howard leaped away and returned to Rick's side.

Ice Ghost suddenly spoke up, "Monica, stop being mischievous! Show some restraint in front of your elders!"
