Chapter 185 185-The Woman with the Eight-Eyed Devil Mask Makes Her Move!

The woman with the eight-eyed devil mask drew her long whip but did not immediately engage. 

Instead, with an agile flip, she leaped onto the arena.

The plainly dressed man scrutinized her form and suddenly remarked, "I've heard you always wear that mask. I wonder what kind of scenery lies hidden beneath?"

As his words fell, the gazes of numerous awakened shifted towards the woman. 

Even those who had been defeated and were feeling dejected perked up with interest at this comment.

The people of this planet naturally had a fervent curiosity for gossip. 

Everyone was eager to know what the Holy Maiden of the Solomon Sacred Assembly, hidden behind the mask, truly looked like. 

After all, those who become Holy Maidens are rarely lacking in beauty.

Not to mention, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask had an exceptionally graceful and well-proportioned figure.

Sensing the intense stares of the awakened, the woman turned towards Howard and said with a light laugh, "Friend from the Kennedy family, if you happen to win against me or this gentleman later, I'll remove my mask for you. How about that?"

"No, thank you," Howard replied calmly. "I have no interest in your appearance."

Hearing Howard's response, the corners of the mouths of many awakened twitched.

We want to know, even if you don't!

Besides, how can you not be interested in a beautiful woman with such a figure? Are you even normal?

"That's truly a heart-breaking statement," the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask feigned a crying expression and sighed, "I suppose my looks are too hideous to catch your eye, young master."

Howard paid no attention to the woman's words.

Seeing his indifference, the woman turned her attention back to the plainly dressed man and chuckled, "Turning back to our conversation, while you're curious about my appearance, I'm equally intrigued about your origins. Which power do you hail from, and how do you possess such formidable skills?"

"I belong to no sect or school; I am merely a beneficiary of a magus's legacy," the plainly dressed man replied, waving his hand dismissively. "I never expected that the so-called geniuses from major powers would be so weak, unable to defeat even someone like me who emerged from obscurity."

His words immediately kindled anger among the many awakened present – a blatant provocation.

"As for my name, I'd rather not disclose it. Otherwise, I fear I would have to live my life looking over my shoulder, possibly being hunted down by the major powers."

The tone of mockery in the man's voice became more pronounced. 

Had it not been for the presence of powerhouses like Glutton overseeing the proceedings, the representatives of the major powers might have already rushed to the stage to attack him in their fury.

Even so, they had made up their minds. 

As soon as the duel concluded and the Starry River Map found its owner, they planned to capture this plainly dressed man.

Even if they couldn't kill him, they were determined to give him a harsh beating – he couldn't be allowed to remain so arrogant!

"Interesting... then, let the battle commence!"

The woman with the eight-eyed devil mask showed no further interest in the plainly dressed man's identity. 

The moment she finished speaking, she fiercely whipped out the long whip from her waist. 

It lashed out like a venomous serpent, swiftly striking towards the man.

"Stone Wall!"

As a magus facing a long-range attack, the plainly dressed man had an effective countermeasure. 

With a wave of his wand, a tawny glow transformed into a solid earth wall.

Even as the whip struck the wall, it splattered fragments of rock in all directions.

However, the woman's move was merely a probing attack. 

Seeing this, she immediately leaped up, her wrist flickering rapidly. 

The whip in her hand vibrated intensely, creating a phantom-like effect with dozens of overlapping shadows lashing out from all directions towards the man.

"Damn, no wonder I sensed danger from you; you're also a long-range attacker!"

"That whip looks so short, how does it extend so far?"

Sensing the barrage of attacks coming his way, the plainly dressed man cursed under his breath, but his hands moved quickly. 

He continuously waved his wand, muttering incantations.

This time, he employed both the Anemo skill Whirlwind Defense and the Pyro skill Fire Resistance Ring.

A deep blue whirlwind materialized beside him, spinning continuously, emitting a strong repulsive force capable of keeping many attacks at bay.

Furthermore, when the Fire Resistance Ring skill activated, the flames didn't spread outward but instead merged with the rotating whirlwind.

The next moment, the whirlwind swirling around the man turned a fiery red.

Just then, dozens of Shadow Whips relentlessly assaulted, colliding with the fiery red whirlwind.

Crack, crack, crack—

Crisp sounds echoed as the combined force of the fire and the whirlwind violently surged, incinerating the Shadow Whips that came into contact.

Witnessing this, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask let out a cold snort. 

With a flick of her wrist, the original Shadow Whips all snapped apart. 

However, with just a swift whip of her long whip, she unleashed a burst of purple light, summoning even more Shadow Whips. 

This time, instead of lashing at the fiery red whirlwind around the plainly dressed man, they encircled and trapped it.

Fire and wind both require air to sustain their existence.

The woman's whipping was incredibly fast, compressing the air in the space and within moments, the flames dissipated, and even the wind ceased.

In this scenario, it was the plainly dressed man's turn to panic.

He hadn't anticipated that the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask wouldn't play by the rules. 

Normally, to defeat a magus, one would think of engaging in close combat.

But the woman opted for a barrage of long-range attacks instead.

What was more astounding was that in terms of long-range offensive capability, he, a magus, was actually outmatched by the woman!

This spurred him into action. 

Utilizing his Blink skill to escape the flurry of whips, he raised his wand and conjured a fiery red spear, hurling it with a roar towards the woman.

However, before the fiery red spear could reach the woman, the Shadow Whips burst forth again. 

The purple whips, like venomous serpents, leapt forward and swiftly entwined around the spear, firmly binding it.

It was only after the fiery red spear exploded that the purple whips finally dissipated.

"Giggle, giggle!"

"Little brother, do you want a battle of spells, or do you prefer close combat? I can satisfy either!"

The woman with the eight-eyed devil mask let out a sinister laugh. 

Abruptly, a ray of light appeared beneath her feet, and in the next moment, she was levitating in the air. 

This allowed her to control her whip over an even greater distance.

With just a flick of her wrist, a purple whip lashed towards the plainly dressed man's face.

He used his Blink skill once again to dodge the attack.

For a while, the battle between the plainly dressed man and the woman became increasingly bizarre. 

One was a terror with a wide attack range; regardless of the opponent's skill, she could use her Shadow Whip to shatter it before it even reached her.

The other continuously utilized his Blink skill, creating a surreal and chaotic scene.

At first, the many awakened watched with great interest. 

However, as time wore on, they began to feel bored. 

How long would this fight go on?

Only Howard noticed something crucial: the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask was about to win!𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Despite the plainly dressed man's consistent evasion using Blink, this skill had a distance limitation. 

His movement range was steadily being compressed by the woman.

Once his Blink skill became too constrained to escape her onslaught, he would struggle to withstand her fierce attacks.

Indeed, just as Howard had predicted, the moment the plainly dressed man's Blink skill was restricted to a certain range, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask immediately unleashed her skill.

"Storm Serpent Dance!"

In the next instant, her hair fluttered wildly as the power of thunder erupted from within her. 

As her arms swung, lightning followed the course of her whip, shooting out ferociously.

Instantly, a sea of thunder enveloped the area, covering a radius of 50 yards. 

It wasn't just the lightning; the Shadow Whips, like venomous serpents, wildly lashed throughout the region, unleashing astonishing power.

In that moment, the plainly dressed man was completely engulfed.

Even with his use of duplication and Blink skills, he found it impossible to escape the reach of the woman's abilities.

His body was struck by the lightning, leaving him paralyzed on the spot.

Then, countless whips, sensing their prey like venomous serpents, converged upon him, entwining and binding his body, squeezing and compressing him mercilessly.

A scream of agony immediately erupted from his mouth.

In just a few breaths, the plainly dressed man lay twitching on the ground, his skin charred and blackened.

Given that it was a competition, the woman with the eight-eyed devil mask did not deliver a killing blow, sparing his life. 

Then, with a sly smile curving her lips, she turned her gleeful gaze towards Howard.
