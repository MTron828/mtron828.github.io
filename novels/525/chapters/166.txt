Chapter 167 167-Will We Meet Again?

Despite Howard having received gifts like Epic-grade and Legendary-grade equipment, it was because he interacted with individuals of high stature.

He was either in contact with the strongest tier academies across the continent or with top-tier powerhouses within the Alliance.

Although the Solomon Sacred Assembly was a first-class power, it was still considerably weaker compared to entities like the Church and Holy Abyss Academy.¬†

For Pallor Swift to offer Diamond-grade equipment was a significant investment on his part!

Besides Howard and a few from Black Tortoise City, the nearby awakened were all wide-eyed and excited upon hearing about Diamond-grade equipment.

Even the young man was no exception!

Although Howard was indifferent to the Diamond-grade equipment, his goal was not focused on that.¬†

He aimed to help the young man and forge a strong bond of friendship.¬†

Thus, he didn't refuse the offer and nodded, "You are, after all, a renowned magus who has been powerful for many years. Attacking us younger folks with skills, wouldn't that be bullying?"

"I think the rules should be changed! If you can withstand my three skills and still stand on the ground, then you win. Otherwise, it's my win."

Howard spoke with full confidence. Pallor Swift raised his eyebrows in amusement and said, "Little guy, it seems you came prepared!"

After a pause, Pallor Swift didn't decline the offer but instead asked, "Before you launch your attack, may I apply shields or buffs to myself?"

"Of course!"

Howard nodded and smiled, "Actually, I am also a magus."

Saying so, Howard took out his Soul Nurturer, and immediately, forces of different elements converged.

Seeing this scene, Pallor Swift couldn't help but laugh.

If Howard had been a Physical Class, he might have been somewhat worried, given his own frail physique.

But a magus attacking him? That was something he didn't need to worry about at all!

His body had the ability to absorb magic!

Nevertheless, to ensure his victory in the wager, Pallor Swift remained cautious. He waved his wand, casting several protective shields on himself.

Even the surface of his skin was enshrouded in a faint blue glow.

At the same time, the many onlookers were filled with curiosity, not understanding when the Solomon Sacred Assembly had become so amenable to negotiation.

However, as they saw Howard and Pallor Swift both making preparations to engage in the wagered duel, their curiosity peaked, and they scrutinized the two combatants closely.

Taking a deep breath, Howard directly executed his skill - Mighty Thunder!

Crackle and pop!

Crisp sounds resonated as countless bolts of lightning erupted around Howard, resembling venomous serpents poking their heads out, their tongues flickering. A formidable force burst forth from within Howard.

"An S-level Electro skill?!"

"Not bad, indeed a powerful Electro magus!"

With his wealth of experience, Pallor Swift instantly recognized the strength of the skill and his regard for Howard grew even more, surpassing his interest in the young man.

The onlookers, hearing Pallor Swift's remark, also showed expressions of astonishment.

S-level skills were extremely rare!

Among the thousands of awakened present, probably less than ten possessed an S-level skill!

The young lady from Black Tortoise City, along with a figure being protected by the crowd from Solomon Sacred Assembly, were all taken aback by Howard, stepping forward with amazed gazes to observe him.

Meanwhile, Howard rapidly advanced towards Pallor Swift.

The lightning swirling around his body grew increasingly intense!UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

Just when Pallor Swift thought Howard was about to launch an attack, a scene that astonished everyone unfolded.

Howard rapidly charged towards Pallor Swift, and to everyone's surprise, he embraced him with both arms.¬†

Then, with a sudden movement, he executed the skill - Death Six-Step Throw!

As soon as the skill was deployed, Howard exerted force with his arms and thrust his waist backward, astonishingly executing a bear hug and slamming Pallor Swift fiercely onto the ground.

Not only that, but Mighty Thunder was simultaneously triggered, with a bolt of lightning exploding and striking Pallor Swift.

Despite most of the damage being absorbed by the shield, the impact of his head against the ground left Pallor Swift dazed and disoriented.¬†

After all, the head is one of the most vulnerable parts of the human body!

"Holy shit!"

"He's a magus, right? How can he fight like a warrior?"

"Damn... Is this guy really a magus?!"

The onlookers' eyes widened in shock, their faces etched with astonishment.

No one had anticipated that after pulling out his wand and casting a skill, Howard would, in the very next second, retract his wand and switch to physical attacks.

Even more unexpectedly, Howard's attack was effective!

What stunned everyone even more was that after throwing Pallor Swift, Howard did not cease his assault. Instead, he fiercely threw Pallor Swift again.

Bang, bang, bang -

Loud explosions resonated continuously as Pallor Swift was repeatedly slammed into the ground by Howard, like a punching bag.

Each throw triggered another blast of Mighty Thunder, causing lightning to strike Pallor Swift each time he hit the ground.

In the beginning, the passive effect of Mighty Thunder could still be resisted by the shield summoned by Pallor Swift.¬†

However, after several attacks, the shield dissipated, leaving him thrown to the ground, with no time to replenish it.

It's fair to say that every subsequent slam and flash of lightning struck directly upon Pallor Swift.

After enduring six such strikes, Pallor Swift was left utterly dazed.¬†

Even though his HP hadn't fallen significantly, his body had grown weak, unable to even stand.

Left with no choice, Pallor Swift applied defensive attributes to himself.¬†

Although his strength was still inferior to the enhanced Howard, his ample HP allowed him to withstand the barrage without life-threatening injuries.

The dizziness was merely the result of his head being repeatedly struck!

However, the other awakened beings didn't know this!

Seeing Pallor Swift collapsed on the ground, unable to rise, they gasped in shock, mistakenly believing he had sustained severe injuries.¬†

The members of the Solomon Sacred Assembly were particularly alarmed and hurried over, attempting to rouse Pallor Swift.

At that moment, a figure wearing an eight-eyed devil mask emerged from the crowd.

Howard, caught off guard by this scene, raised his eyebrows in surprise.

The figure was notably slender and short. It was only when she extended her hand, summoning a vine of green leaves, that Howard realized she was a woman.

"An eight-eyed devil mask... The Holy Maiden of the Solomon Sacred Assembly, perhaps?"

"Another key figure arrives!"

Instantly, Howard understood the significance of this development, reflecting on the immense allure the Starry River Map held for even non-top-tier forces.

The woman brushed Pallor Swift's cheek with the green vine, swiftly bringing him back to consciousness.¬†

Shaking his head vigorously, he quickly got to his feet.

Remembering the events that had just transpired, Pallor Swift's face flushed with embarrassment.¬†

However, in the presence of such a large crowd, he dared not go back on his word.

After a moment's hesitation, he reluctantly accepted the outcome, grinding his teeth as he spoke, "Kid, you've won. I won't take the spoils of war!"

"These are two Level 50 Diamond-grade equipment!"

With that, Pallor Swift casually tossed a Storage Bag toward Howard and then turned to walk towards the woman in the eight-eyed devil mask.¬†

Waving his hand, he led his group of awakened away.

After inspecting the Storage Bag, Howard couldn't help but exclaim, "I thought the Solomon Sacred Assembly was more like a cult. I didn't expect them to honor a promise!"

"You exaggerate, sir."

The woman in the eight-eyed devil mask responded with a melodious voice, "The Solomon Sacred Assembly is not a cult, just a bit obscure in name!"

Unperturbed, Howard was about to turn and look for the young man when he heard the woman in the eight-eyed devil mask speak again, "May I ask, sir, was the move you executed just now the Death Six-Step Throw?"

"Hmm?!"

Howard paused mid-step.¬†

Though he didn't respond, his reaction was enough for the woman in the eight-eyed devil mask to understand.¬†

She smiled and said, "So you are a friend of the Kennedy family. We shall meet again someday!"

With these words, the woman in the eight-eyed devil mask also followed Pallor Swift and departed.

The surrounding awakened also expressed their surprise: "No wonder this guy, despite being a magus, can execute such impressive combat skills. Turns out he's from the Kennedy family!"

"Has the Kennedy family, dormant for decades, started to rise again?"

Hearing the discussions among the awakened, Howard's eyebrows slightly furrowed.

Clearly, the woman in the eight-eyed devil mask had mistaken his identity!

But why did she say they would meet again in the future?

With these questions in mind, Howard maintained his composure and walked straight up to the young man.¬†

Handing over the Storage Bag, he smiled lightly, "Are you alright? There's a share of the spoils here that belongs to you!"

"This... This doesn't seem right," the young man replied, his eyes filled with hope yet shaking his head, "Without your help, I probably wouldn't have been able to get away. Those two pieces of Diamond-grade equipment are yours! Besides, I should also share some of my spoils with you, as a token of my gratitude!"

"After all, without you, I wouldn't have been able to keep these spoils!"
