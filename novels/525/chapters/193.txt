Chapter 194 194-Mortality Murderer

Howard's mind raced with speculation – could there be a BOSS among these monsters?

However, this wasn't the time for pondering. 

Howard continued to lead the students, maintaining their formation as they advanced.

The archers and magi's firepower barrage left the Sneaky Murderers without a chance to retaliate.

On the rare occasion that they managed to get close to the students, they were promptly blocked by the meat shield class. 

Several shields came crashing down, their heads clanging resoundingly.

With their ranged skills effectively sealed and their melee attacks burdened with a preliminary swing, the monsters were left virtually helpless!

At this point, the students began to exude an air of arrogance.

"Is this what Extraplanar beings are like?"

"Our elders always talked about how powerful Extraplanar beings are. These are too weak, aren't they?"

"Tsks, it seems we are really quite formidable!"

Hearing these remarks, Howard's brows slightly furrowed. 

He wanted to remind the students, but struggled to find the right words. 

After all, judging by the current performance of the Sneaky Murderers, they did seem exceptionally weak.

Or perhaps, Sneaky Murderers were better suited for small team battles. 

In situations with a larger number of awakened, their abilities couldn't be fully utilized, leading to their suppression.

"Keep pushing forward; I just need to be cautious. Even with this foreboding feeling, we must stop their slaughter. Otherwise, if the survivors in the base were to die, that would be a true tragedy."

Howard couldn't bear the thought of the survivors being killed. 

He firmly resolved to continue commanding the students in their relentless assault.

In just half a quarter of an hour, even before mentors Wales and Tana could arrive, Howard and his team had already cleared all the Sneaky Murderers near the base.

However, only fewer than ten survivors remained.

After the demise of the Sneaky Murderers, they finally stopped fleeing, collapsing onto the ground, gasping for air with heaving breaths.

"Are you folks from the base? What happened earlier? How did so many Extraplanar beings appear?" Howard quickly approached them. 

Of course, he was uncertain whether these people were friend or foe, so he kept all his shields at maximum. 

This way, even in case of a sneak attack, his own safety was assured.

"We... we don't know either," the survivors lifted their heads upon hearing Howard's words. 

Carefully examining him and seeing he didn't appear to be a foe, they sobbed, "We were just normally hunting and surviving in the mountains. Unexpectedly, one day while fetching water, a space rift abruptly emerged beside the stream!"

"Then, these terrifying monsters leaped out from it. They killed anyone on sight and chased us all the way to the base. Even the warriors who had gotten elite equipment and learned skills from the city folk were killed. We simply couldn't resist them!"

"Right, many monsters have also invaded the base. Can you go back inside and save the others?"

Hearing this, Howard and the other students' expressions subtly changed. 

They turned and looked back towards the base.

The base, in reality, was a cave, its entrance appearing quite large.

It was estimated that the supplies given to them by the Alliance had all been stored inside this cave.

However, upon seeing the terrain, Howard's expression grew serious.

Initially, the peculiar abilities of the Sneaky Murderers were quite special. 

Their relentless advance was purely due to the geographical advantage they had - being able to easily spot them prevented the full utilization of their Space Jump ability. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

They were either forced into melee combat or suppressed by the magus and archer teams.

If Howard were to lead the students into the cave, their formation would be compromised. 

Even the archer and magus teams would struggle to create an effective offensive environment, and there was a high likelihood of being counter-attacked by the Sneaky Murderers.

Realizing this, Howard's face turned grave as he shook his head, outright refusing the survivors' request.

"Why not?"

"You've already saved us, please, do us another kindness and save our friends and family too?"

The survivors all looked at Howard with eyes full of hope.

"We can't save them!" Howard said solemnly. "The terrain inside the cave doesn't suit us. If we rashly enter, it's highly likely that not only would we fail to save anyone, but we would also end up losing our own lives."

The survivors' breaths hitched, and their faces immediately showed expressions of sadness.

However, they weren't foolish. 

They knew they had been rescued by Howard and at this point, didn't dare to contradict him or forcefully ask him to continue the rescue.

After all, angering Howard could potentially cut off their own chances of survival.

"Don't worry, our mentors will be here soon. They are very powerful and can help rescue your people."

In times of non-internal conflict, Howard genuinely didn't wish to see humans die. 

After all, these fallen humans could potentially have been the main force in resisting demons and Extraplanar beings in the future!

Hearing this, the survivors finally showed a hint of a smile.

After Maithus and his group had swept the area, confirming no living Sneaky Murderers remained, they too joined Howard, speaking in a low voice: "Those bizarre monsters have been cleared out, we now... "

Before he could finish, a deafening roar erupted, followed by a violent trembling of the earth.

Everyone, including Howard, staggered, struggling to maintain their balance.

Boom, boom, boom!

Before Howard, Abby, Ying Chan, and the rest could react, the ground was abruptly torn asunder. 

A colossal body then emerged from beneath the earth.

Howard and the others glanced at it, their eyes widening in disbelief.

It resembled a giant centipede, its body covered in sharp serrations. Its head and tail were indistinguishable, adding to its eerie appearance.

In an instant, Howard cast a Divination spell on it.

[ Mortality Murderer ]

[ Level: 60 ]

[ Tier: Diamond ]

[ Description: A Mortality Murderer that has undergone multiple evolutions. Every inch of its skin contains poison. Each of its limbs is incredibly sharp, capable of slicing through steel. Furthermore, its vitality is strangely robust, able to survive even with a severed head. ]

[ HP: 284850/ 316500 ]

[ Attack Power: 17749—20085 ]

[ Defense Value: 15000 ]

[ Skills: Death Thrust, Fatal Strike, Terror Venom Mist, Death Roll, Death Hunt ]

The total of five skills caused Howard's pupils to contract.

While the number of skills doesn't necessarily represent the strength of a BOSS, a BOSS with numerous skills is definitely not to be underestimated!

"Roar!"

Just as Howard and the students were cautiously examining the attributes of the Mortality Murderer, it launched an attack.

Its body coiled, its sharp, blade-like limbs moving at an incredibly fast speed towards the survivors.

In an instant, the Mortality Murderer reached the survivors. 

Its razor-sharp limbs struck with astonishing speed, continuously piercing them and even creating afterimages, splattering blood everywhere.

"Damn it!"

"How dare it kill in front of us!"

Witnessing this scene, Howard and the others were filled with anger. 

Despite facing a formidable level 60 Diamond-grade BOSS, the students resolutely initiated their attack.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh —

Arrows whistled through the air, creating a sky-filled barrage of rain, intermingled with the glow of various elemental lights, raining down upon the Mortality Murderer.

"-12!"

"-31!"

"-19!"

"MISS!"

However, due to the vast difference in attributes, the group of awakened, mostly around level 20, struggled to inflict significant damage. 

Only Howard, with his astonishing attributes, managed to deal over 600 points of damage with a single Frost Arrow Spell!

But that was just the extent of it.

The control effect of the Frost Arrow Spell barely took effect. 

The spreading ice had just begun when it was shattered by the Mortality Murderer.

In the next moment, the Mortality Murderer roared angrily, its body dropping down. 

Its two rows of knife-like sharp limbs swiftly stabbed into the ground, rapidly advancing towards Howard and the others at an incredible speed.

Witnessing this scene, Howard quickly raised his wand, unleashing three bolts of lightning that fiercely struck the head of the Mortality Murderer.

With the enhancement of his skill level, the damage dealt increased by about 300 points, reaching just over a thousand.

Not only that, but the Mortality Murderer's entire body was enveloped in lightning, causing it to convulse violently.

Seizing the opportunity while the Mortality Murderer was paralyzed, Howard immediately switched to the Bow of the Songweaver. 

Drawing the bowstring back, he deployed the SS-level skill, Mighty Strike of Destructive God, with the casting bar on his head rapidly filling.

Although this was an SS-level skill, it came with armor-piercing effects, making it ideally suited for use at the start of the battle!

Unless, of course, he learned another lower-level skill with similar armor-piercing effects.

Hum—

As the casting bar filled, a massive arrow, shimmering with black and purple light, materialized on the bowstring in Howard's hands.
