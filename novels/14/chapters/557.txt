Chapter 557: Fate Really Knows How To Crack A Joke

The Black Qilin’s body soared towards the sky and flew above the clouds. Chiffon looked in awe at the surroundings because this was the first time she had flown in the air.

She was like a little child that was taken on a field trip, and currently enjoying the sights and sounds around her.

“Big Brother, I heard that Qilin’s are only native to the Silvermoon Continent,” Chiffon said. “Where did you find this Black Qilin?”

“I kille-, I mean, I tamed him when I was in the Southern Continent,” William replied. “It had a very nasty personality, so I was forced to beat the crap out of him until he submitted to me.”

“Big Brother is so amazing!”

“Yes. I am amazing.”

The Black Qilin didn’t show any kind of reaction to the two passengers in its back, and continued to fly in silence.

The Qilin was the former Guardian of the Silvermoon Continent, Eneru, who was killed by the angry Protectors of the Kraetor Empire.

William took the Qilin’s corpse and its soul-which was trapped in the Altar inside the Hellan Royal Palace-and used his Necromantic power to bring it back to life as a servant.

Supposedly, Eneru should have turned into an Undead Qilin after William had brought him back to life. However, something happened within his Sea of Consciousness.

The King Chess Piece glowed, and the Black Strand that had laid dormant within his Spiritual World, lent its power to bring Eneru back to life, which allowed the Qilin to be reborn as a Black Qilin.

William wasn’t aware that these two pieces of Divinity had worked hand in hand to create a very rare Mythical Beast that was known for its power to wield black lightning.

Raiden was the name William had bestowed to the newly born Eneru, who had no memories of his past life. The Qilin’s personality was like a man with few words. It would only talk if William was the first to initiate a conversation.

The Qilin’s Myriad Core had been taken out of its body and given to Ella. She, along with the other goats that also received Millennial Cores from William from the Beasts that were slain during the war, were currently hibernating in the Kyrintor Mountains.

Takam had volunteered to watch after them as they completed their evolution. William didn’t know when the first members of his herd would wake up. Although he was going to miss them, he knew that this was also a good opportunity for all of them to grow stronger.

He hoped that the next time they met, All of them would have taken on their human forms, and would come to accompany William on his journey through the Central Continent.

“And that is Chiffon’s current state inside the Academy,” Dickie reported through a communication crystal. “She’s still as miserable as ever.”

“Is that so?” an arrogant voice replied. “Did you see something unusual? Like, an odd behaviour from her?”

“No, Sir. I didn’t see anything of the sort.”

“Very well. Continue to monitor her. Also, be mindful of the news, and rumors that are currently spreading in the information network of the Kraetor Empire. No matter how unbelievable the news, make sure to take it down and report it to me as soon as possible. I’ll see you in a week.”

“Understood, Duke Ryder.”

-

Somewhere in the Demon Continent…

“How peculiar. Based on the current time line, she should have already gone berserk by now…,” Duke Ryder tapped his desk with a frown. “Did we make a mistake in our calculation?”

The Duke activated the ring on his ring finger.

“Sir, it is me,” Duke Ryder said in a respectful voice. “I have called you to give a report.”

A beam of light shot from the ring and created a projection in front of the Duke. There, a man sitting on a throne made of skulls looked back at him with a serious expression.

“Did that vermin finally lose control of her powers?” the man asked. “Did she devour the entire Silverwind Academy?”

Duke Ryder shook his head. “No, My Lord. According to the report, the Vermin is still living off the trash in the Garbage Dump of the Academy. So far, aside from her miserable condition, her Divinity remains dormant.”

The man frowned. This was not the report he was waiting for. According to the calculations of his warlocks, the Sin of Gluttony should have already gone berserk at this point in time.

They had sent Chiffon to the Kraetor Empire in order to give them a surprise that they would never forget in their lifetime. The man sitting on the throne made of skulls was Chiffon’s father.

He used Emperor Leonidas’ sentiment for Chiffon’s mother to bring the little girl under his care.

Chiffon’s father readily agreed to send her daughter away, but gave Emperor Leonidas two conditions. First, Chiffon must be enrolled at the Silverwind Academy, and second, she would not receive any form of support from Emperor Leonidas’ Empire.

Their goal was to let Chiffon’s Divinity go berserk and devour the entire academy. That way, all the members of the young generation, including countless prodigies and heirs of noble families, would all die a tragic death.

This would weaken the Kraetor Empire for at least twenty to thirty years because of the loss of their young prodigies. This was a blow that no Empire wanted to bear.

If only Emperor Leonidas knew of the sinister plan that his former companion had prepared for him, he wouldn’t have brought Chiffon back to his Empire.

Chiffon’s father wanted to weaken one of the pillars that kept the peace of the Central Continent. If one of those pillars crumbled, chaos would once again prevail and the other major powers would swarm the Kraetor Empire in droves like vultures and hyenas, looking to eat some scraps from a dying wild beast.

“Well, no matter,” the man sitting on the throne said after some time. “If it doesn’t happen now, it is still bound to happen later. At most, it will only take one more month before our plan comes to fruition.”

“I agree, My Lord.” Duke Ryder nodded his head. “I will continue to monitor the Kraetor Empire. Once I get wind of any good news, I will report it to you right away, My Lord.”

“Good.” The man on the throne nodded. “We’ve been experiencing a lot of setbacks lately. The plan to get Broodmares in the Southern Continent also failed…”

“My Lord, have you heard about the news regarding the Elves?”

“I did. I already sent people to verify whether the news was true or not.”

The man sitting on the throne had heard a very interesting rumor from the Southern Continent. According to the information he got, the Elves tried to conquer the Human Kingdoms, and failed miserably. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Aside from losing millions of elves, their Demigod, Sepheron disappeared, and one of their Guardian Beasts, Eneru, died in battle. If this news was true then it would greatly weaken the forces of the Silvermoon Continent.

The man still hadn’t forgotten the time when he almost succeeded in conquering the Elves and making them their slaves. It was quite unfortunate that a Human Hero stood before them and trampled his ambitions into the ground.

The man rubbed his left arm that had been regrown using the power of Dark Magic. They had suffered greatly in that war. Due to the Demon Race’s slow reproduction rate, they decided to capture Humans who had strong magical and spiritual powers.

They were to be their broodmares that would help them increase their numbers. Although the Human Empires and Kingdoms in the Central Continent were always at odds with each other, they would set aside their grievances and unite if their peace was threatened.

This was why the Lord of the Demonic Continent didn’t dare to capture the prodigies in the Central Continent, and just settled for the ones in the Southern Continent. Unfortunately, this plan had failed as well.

In the end, they resorted to dealing with slave traders in order to get their hands on promising slaves that had the potential to give birth to powerful demons. Although slave trading was banned in some parts of the continent, there were still places where the underground auctions were held.

The Slave Traders didn’t care who bought their wares as long as the money was good. Some of them even formed a partnership with the Demon Race who always bought their slaves in bulk.

“My Lord, I have other things to report,” Duke Ryder said with a smile. “I heard from a credible source that the son of our nemesis is also in the Kraetor Empire.”

“Son of our nemesis?” The man eyed the Demon Duke with an appraising look. “Are you talking about Maxwell’s son with the Saintess?”

“Yes, My Lord. according to one of my business partners in the Kraetor Empire, the Half-Elf is currently enrolled in Silverwind Academy.”

A devilish smile appeared on the man’s lips. Soon, he roared in laughter.

Duke Ryder smiled as he watched his Lord laugh to his heart’s content.

“Fate really knows how to crack a joke,” the man said after laughing. “I can’t wait to see the day when that girl, Chiffon, will devour everything, including that bastard’s son. I wonder how the Saintess will react after hearing this news.”

The man laughed once again. He had long wanted to have his revenge on Maxwell, and Arwen, but there had never been an opportunity.

Now that the boy was inside Silverwind Academy, it was only a matter of time before his name would be added to the list of people that died due to his daughter’s Deadly Sin.
