Chapter 332: Our Battle Will Be Legendary [Part 2]

Lugh laughed when he heard William’s snarky reply.

His laughter only lasted for a brief moment before he threw his shield towards the boy without warning.

William stepped aside to dodge the attack, but his battle instincts told him to get away as soon as he could. The Half-Elf didn’t think twice and jumped back decisively.

It was at that moment when Lugh’s body materialized and swapped places with the shield. The God then thrust his spear in William’s direction, shooting a beam of light.

William somersaulted in the air to evade Lugh’s attack before making a sweeping motion with the golden staff in his hand. The staff extended and swung towards the God who was looking at William in disdain.

Before the staff could even hit him, Lugh disappeared from the ground and reappeared a hundred meters above William.

He then spread his hands wide as he looked up into the heavens.

“Praise the Sun!” Lugh shouted.

Suddenly the darkness of the night disappeared, and a giant blazing sun appeared in the heavens. Lugh’s body turned golden as the spear in his hand turned dark red.

“Bloom in the battlefield!” Lugh declared with arrogance. “Fleur du Soleil!”

The hair on William’s neck stood on end as he faced the familiar attack that he had used back in Hestia. He already had his suspicions that the Sun Knight Job Class and Lugh were connected with each other.

He just didn’t expect that even his weapon, Soleil, was an artifact that originally belonged to the Sun God!

Naturally, the spear that Lugh used wasn’t Soleil. He had lent Soleil to Astrid who, in turn, gave it to one of her warriors who fought for Humanity during the Dark Era in Hestia.

However, since the weapon originally belonged to him, Lugh was able to use Soleil’s power, just like William was able to use the “Lightning God War Arts” in battle.

The flaming spear flew towards William, leaving trails of flames in the sky. This attack was similar to a nuclear strike that could wipe out entire armies with a single attack.

William’s Sun Knight Job Class was only able to bring out a fraction of Soleil’s true power. The Half-Elf didn’t dare to try and find out how strong this attack could be after being used by a God.

“Quick Shot War Art… Fusion Form.” William said with determination. “Blitzer Railgun!”

William fused with his weapon and shot towards the heavens, evading the flaming spear. While he was soaring towards the sky at the speed of sound, a thought crossed through his mind.

‘I feel like I’m forgetting something,’ William thought as he traveled thousands of meters above the ground in a matter of seconds.

Meanwhile on the ground…

“Fck! Oink!” Zhu exclaimed as he realized the great danger that they were about to face. “Run!”

The Pig Demon ran with everything he had because he had no intention of turning into roasted pork.

“Fool!” Sha grabbed his friend’s arm before using his ability to dive under the ground.

A few seconds later, a world shaking explosion erupted on the battlefield. The Celestial Army, who tried to flee, was immediately enveloped by a radiant light before their bodies turned into ashes.

Despite Zhu’s and Sha’s attempt to escape underground in order to prevent injury and death, they were not spared from the explosion. The two received serious injuries as the shockwave from the blast descended on them with a vengeance.

Fortunately, the two of them were strong individuals and the powerful attack didn’t take their lives.

William had already cancelled his ability mid-flight and looked down on the devastation on the ground.

A blazing ten-mile-crater had formed in the ground where the spear landed, turning everything around it into a sea of flames. William had to admit that it was quite an impressive sight, and he hoped that there wouldn’t come a time when he had to use a similar attack back in his world.

It was an attack that had the potential to wipe out entire cities off the face of the Earth.

After the initial shock had passed, William summoned a cloud using the Monkey King’s power and mounted it. He then charged at Lugh, who looked back at him with a contemptuous gaze.

“Immolate! Solar Flare!” Lugh pointed his finger at William.

Immediately after that, a thirty-meter miniature sun formed in front of William. The sun expanded its size and was about to explode when William thrust his spear towards it.

“Not happening!” William roared. The golden staff in his hand extended and its thickness expanded to over tens of meters. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The golden tip collided with the miniature sun and pushed it along with its descent towards the arrogant Sun God, whose expression immediately became serious when his own attack was directed back at him.

Not only that, William’s attack was right behind the Solar Flare, which made the Sun God take these two attacks seriously.

“Aegis!” Lugh stood firm and held the shield in front of him.

The shield expanded until it was three-meters wide, shielding Lugh’s entire body behind it. A powerful explosion made the sky tremble as the Solar Flare erupted right in front of Lugh’s Golden Shield.

A few seconds later, the nearly forty-meter-thick-staff slammed against the shield, sending Lugh crashing towards the ground along with it.

The moment his two feet landed on the ground, Lugh shouted as he resisted one of the most dangerous weapons in existence. The weapon of the Monkey King could injure Gods, and it was something that all of the Gods in the Temple were aware of. This was why Lugh had to treat it seriously, or else he would suffer terribly.

The ground under his feet cracked as he held up his shield to combat the staff that was pinning him to the ground.

Lily’s mouth opened wide as she looked at the staff that extended thousands of meters long, and nearly forty-meters thick.

William roared as he channeled his aura into the staff to crush the annoying God like a bug.

Lugh gritted his teeth as he endured William’s unreasonable attack that broke all the rules of the Heavenly Domain. However, what he didn’t know was that the Half-Elf’s attack wasn’t over yet.

“Quick Shot War Art, Fourth Form!” William shouted, “Grand Bazooka!”

Issei, Lily, and David’s eyes widened in shock because they had completely forgotten that William’s ability could be channeled through his weapon.

The Immortal Heroes and the Gods watching the battle unconsciously shuddered because they, also, just remembered this fact. Everyone who was watching this scene from the Heaven’s knew that they wouldn’t want themselves to be at the receiving end of this unreasonable attack of epic proportions.

Just as they expected, another world-shaking explosion, that wouldn’t lose to Lugh’s full-powered-attack earlier, broke out from the tip of the Golden Staff.

Zhu and Sha, who was seriously injured and lying on the ground, raised their middle fingers in William’s direction. The two of them cursed the Half-Elf for not thinking about their well-being when he fired the Gigantic Bazooka at point blank range.

Soon, the entire battlefield, including the Heavenly Gate, was bathed in a fiery blaze that extended up to the Heavens, destroying everything in its wake.
