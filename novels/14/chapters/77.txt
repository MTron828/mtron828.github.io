Chapter 77: Are We Now Friends?

Three days after William and Est cleared the trial, their group finally left the Holy Temple.

Although William was feeling down that he suddenly got nerfed, he decided to not think too much about it. The group was currently taking a short break by the river, before continuing their journey downstream.

‘It’s only five years,’ William thought as he swam on the river. “Once those five years are over, I’ll charge down the road in order to become the OP Protagonist!”

Perhaps it was due to his frustrations, but he said the last sentence out loud.

Ian who was cooling his feet by the riverside wasn’t able to resist the urge to bring him down a peg.

“OP Protagonist? Do you think you’re some kind of Hero in a fairy tale?” Ian said in disdain.

William angrily glared at his mortal enemy and swam in his direction.

“Hey, are you really a boy?” William asked. As he stood a few meters away from Ian. “How come you’re acting like you’re always having a period?”

Ian’s face darkened when he heard William’s words. A part of him wanted to refute him, and the other half suddenly became anxious.

‘D-Did he notice?’ Ian looked at William anxiously. ‘No. it’s impossible. Only a handful know about our secret!’

“What’s the matter?” William was feeling smug. “Cat got your tongue?”

It was very rare for him to make Ian speechless. Seeing the annoying boy unable to make a comeback made William’s frustration decrease by a good margin.

“Hmp! I will not argue with an idiot like you,” Ian replied as he grumpily walked towards the carriage, leaving the smug looking William in his wake.

Est watched this exchange and helplessly shook his head. He had already told Ian not to be too mean to William, but the latter just couldn’t resist quarelling with him every chance he got.

The handsome boy with light-brown hair and eyes, appraised the red-headed boy from where he was sitting. Like most boys, William’s body was still developing. His wet red-hair glistened in the sunlight, and his pale white skin shimmered with water droplets.

As Est observed his body, he noticed a black rose tattoo on William’s chest. It was as big as an adult’s hand, and was quite eye-catching.

“William, did you always have that tattoo on your chest?” Est asked.

“Tattoo? What tattoo?” William asked back.

“That tattoo on your chest,” Est said as he pointed at his own chest.

William lowered his head and looked at his chest. When he saw the black rose tattoo, a frown appeared on his face. He had a hunch where the tattoo came from, but he still asked the system for confirmation.

‘System, do you know where this black rose tattoo on my chest came from?’

[ To answer the Host’s question, the black rose tattoo is a powerful seal that prevents you from using your magic power. ]

‘I knew it.’

William looked at the tattoo on his chest with a complicated expression. In the end, he sighed and answered Est’s question.

“This is the first time I’m seeing this tattoo,” William replied. “I guess this is the side-effect of using the forbidden power during the trial of courage.”

“I see…” Est looked apologetic as he stared at William’s face. “Sorry, it’s because of-“

“Alright, you can stop right there.” William shook his head. “I already told you and I’ll say it again, I didn’t do it just for you. You might not believe me, but I was also tasked with clearing the trial of courage. Maybe the reason why it became so difficult is because there are two people taking the trial at the same time.

“Besides, the one who killed the Cyclops was you and not me. I should be the one thanking you for successfully completing the mission.”

Est knew that William would just keep downplaying the part he played during the Cyclops subjugation, so he decided to not pursue the topic any longer. Even if William denied it, he was still Est’s benefactor and that wouldn’t change no matter what the red-headed boy said.

Est wanted to know more about William. If possible, he wanted the two of them to become friends. Aside from Isaac and Ian, Est never had a peer of the same age. His days were spent inside their estate studying and practicing swordplay.

This was the first time he wanted to be close to another person. He wanted to know more about him. After making a decision, he decided to take the initiative to prolong their conversation.

“What are your future plans?” Est asked. “If you like, you can come with us to the capital. I still haven’t rewarded you for saving my life.”

“My only plan right now is to return to Lont and live a happy and peaceful life,” William answered as he walked towards the side of the river. He was done swimming and it was time for him to put on some clothes. “As for the reward that you want to give me, I’ll pass on that. Receiving a reward from a friend feels awkward.”

“F-Friend?!” Est’s eyes widened. “Are we now friends?”

“You don’t want to be?”

“I want!”

William chuckled when he saw Est’s reaction. He didn’t mind being friends with someone who had fought side by side with him in a battle of life and death.

William walked towards Est with a refreshing smile. Water droplets were still falling from his hair as he extended a hand to the handsome boy in front of him. The latter also extended his own hand and held William’s hand in a firm grip.

“Hello, my name is William Von Ainsworth, just call me Will.”

“Est Wells Newmont. Just call me Est.”

“Is that your real name?” William asked.

“For now,” Est answered. “Sorry, I want to tell you my real name, but I am not at liberty to do so.”

“It’s fine. So how about your two sidekicks?” William inquired. “What are their real names?”

“T-That…” Est averted his gaze. “I am also not at liberty to answer that question.”

“So they’re just Isaac and Ian for now?”

“Yes.”

“Understood.” William nodded his head.

Everyone had their secrets and it would be wrong of him to pry. Since Est and him were now officially friends, he decided to ignore Ian’s rudeness for the time being.

“Very well, I have decided!” Est looked at William with determination. “I will escort you back to Lont.”

“Eh? Escort me back?” William tilted his head in confusion. “Why?”

“Because it will be dangerous for you to travel alone,” Est replied. “Since you can’t use your magic power, I will ensure your safety.”

William could tell that Est was dead serious when he said that he wanted to escort him back to Lont. For a brief moment, he thought about rejecting his offer. However, the strong grip on his hand made him feel that Est wouldn’t take no for an answer.

“Thank you,” William said with a smile. “We don’t have any fancy food in Lont. However, if you don’t mind eating porridge, and drinking goat milk then I’ll be more than happy to become your host for a few days.”

“Deal.” Est smiled.

The two handsome boys looked at each other with a smile.

“Hey, just how long are the two of you going to hold hands?” Ian asked in annoyance. “Also, red-head boy, are you an exhibitionist? Why are you still not wearing any clothes?”

Est’s face reddened as he unconsciously looked on William’s body. He wasn’t thinking about anything earlier, but Ian’s comment made him realize that William still hadn’t put any clothes on.

William, on the other hand, just rolled his eyes as he walked towards his Mama Ella. ‘I’m wearing pants okay? Who are you calling an exhibitionist?’

He wanted to say those words, but decided to just let it be.

‘I wonder how Grandpa and the rest will treat my new friends?’ William mused as he thought about the loving family that was waiting for him back in Lont.
