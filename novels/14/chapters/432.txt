Chapter 432: So, You Chose, Death

A week later, Floyd brought a hundred men with him to travel to Lont. He still needed to tie up a few loose ends in his laboratory and assigned his subordinates to take care of the experimental subjects that were currently in their Final Stage

Floyd was aware that Celine was a powerful Dark Sorceress.

Although he idolized her, he was someone who would do anything to get what he wanted. It doesn’t matter if he used force, schemes, or deceit to get his way. As long as it worked, he was fine with it.

Since that was the case, he decided to bring his seasoned elites to assist him in his endeavor. Although settling things peacefully was the ideal result, having a Plan B when things didn’t go his way was a very normal thing for him to do.

Anyone who wielded Dark Magic should always be treated with caution. What people didn’t know was that Dark Magic had two branches. Dark Magic, the regular dark magic which most Dark Magicians were capable of using and True Dark Magic that was imbued by the power of the Ancients.

If a Dark Magician and a True Practitioner of the Dark Arts fought, the winner would always be the latter. There was simply no chance that someone who wielded Dark Magic, bereft of True Darkness, could win against those whose very hands and feet were bound by an entity that was darker than black.

Celine was one of those who wielded True Dark Magic and was not afraid to use it if anyone dared to tick her off.

Some say that there were three strict requirements before one could wield the true power of Darkness.

The first one was betrayal.

The second, enslavement.

And the rumored third requirement was to completely, and utterly, surrender oneself into Darkness.

Whether these rumors were true or not, nobody knew. Only those who wielded the true power of Darkness knew these secrets, for they do not share this with the unworthy.

After several days of travel, Floyd and his men finally arrived at the border of Lont. However, they couldn’t proceed any further for they noticed several strong existences guarding the small town that they were planning to visit.

“A Millennial Beast and over a dozen Wyverns,” one of Floyd’s subordinates said with a frown. “What kind of town is this?”

Although they were not afraid of having a brawl with the Ourobro and the Wyverns, that didn’t mean that they could just provoke them willy nilly. They were still powerful beasts in their own right and one mistake could lead to a tragic ending.

“What now, Sir?” a skinny man wearing a black robe asked.

Floyd frowned. The reason why he brought a hundred men with him was to ensure that he could subdue Celine if their talk got out of hand. He had no intention of sending them to fight against these strong beasts and risk any casualties on their side.

“Kell, Kazz, Kurt,” Floyd called out.

“”Sir!””

Three men with identical faces stepped forward and bowed their heads respectfully.

“Kell. You have already met Celine in the past right?” Floyd inquired.

“Yes, Sir,” Kell replied. “I’ve delivered two letters to her under Sir Conner’s order.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Good. Now, give this letter to her. Make sure to wait for her reply before you return to me.

“Yes, Sir!”

Kell took the letter and merged with the ground.

He and his brothers had the unique ability to become completely one with the Earth. This allowed them to travel unimpeded to many places. Because of this, they were assigned many missions to spy on and infiltrate heavily guarded locations that other people wouldn’t be able to bypass.

Floyd smiled because he couldn’t wait to meet his idol in the flesh. He just hoped that Celine would agree to his request. That way, he wouldn’t be forced to use his Plan B.

Celine was lazing around on her sofa when she heard a knock on her door. She immediately stood up because the knock that was used was the hidden code made by the members of The Organization when they planned to communicate with each other.

When she opened the door, she didn’t see anyone, but she wasn’t the least bit bothered by it. She casually picked up the letter that was left on the doorstep and read its contents.

‘Upgrading the Super Soldier Project?’ Celine mused. ‘So, someone picked up the research I tossed aside when I was still active in the organization. Conner also wanted to meet with William to talk to him?’

Celine read everything in the letter and frowned. She had no intention of working with The Organization at this point in time because she was only interested in dealing with the Elves.

Aside from helping them with the creation of the Artificial Miasma and giving them some half-finished projects, like the Super Soldier Project, Celine had chosen to distance herself from them.

She devoted herself to doing experiments after receiving the organization’s payment of the extremely rare ingredients that she had lost because of the unexpected attack of the Golden-Scaled Crocodile.

Celine had also busied herself in training William, so she didn’t have time to participate in the discussions and planning within Deus.

Also, the fact that Conner wanted to meet her Disciple made her raise her guard. If possible, she didn’t want William to meet Conner at this point in time. Celine was afraid that William would immediately become hostile with the leader of Deus after what their Organization had done to his family and kingdom.

The beautiful Elf entered her house once more to write a short letter, which she left on her doorstep.

A minute after Celine closed the door, the letter merged with the ground and disappeared completely.

-

“She dares to refuse my proposal?” Floyd read Celine’s handwritten letter with a dumbfounded expression. “How absurd! Such a waste of God-Given Talent! This won’t do.”

Floyd carefully folded Celine’s letter before placing it inside his storage ring.

‘If I remember correctly, that William boy had two cousins,’ Floyd thought. ‘Celine might change her mind if I take them as hostages. I’m sure she doesn’t want her disciple to feel sad, so she will compromise and agree to talk with me face to face.’

He then stared at the town in the distance as he decided to proceed with plan B.

“Kell, Kazz, Kurt,” Floyd said. “Go pay a visit to the Ainsworth Residence first. Capture any red-haired person you see and bring them here. One of them is a teenage boy, the other, a child not more than five years old. If you are discovered, escape immediately. Do I make myself clear?”

“”Yes, Sir!”” The triplets said in unison before they merged with the ground.

They were Deus’ best Infiltration Agents that could practically go anywhere because they had mastered being one with the Earth. Floyd believed that if any of them wanted to escape, no one in the small town of Lont could stop them.

“Eyah!” Eve shouted as she pointed her small wooden stick forward. The seven ducklings, and one goose, followed behind her, as they marched around the garden of the Ainsworth Residence.

‘To think that I, the feared Millennial Beast of the Eastern Regions, would become a Beast Companion of a little girl. If my acquaintances discover this, I’m going to die in shame.’ The White Goose lamented his fate as he followed Eve around like a pet.

While the White Goose was weeping internally, it felt something off with the surroundings. As a Millennial Beast that specialized in sensing Magic and Spiritual Power, it immediately noticed the unwanted pests that had intruded upon the Ainsworth Residence.

One of them made a beeline towards Eve, while the other two made their way to the main residence.

Eve and the ducklings were unaware of the approaching danger and were parading around the garden like little soldiers off to war.

The White Goose was not far behind them and was paying close attention to the person that was buried deep beneath the Earth.

‘Such an adorable little child,’ Kell, the eldest of the three triplets thought as he observed Eve from the ground. He didn’t snatched Eve right away because he was scanning the surroundings for possible dangers that he may have overlooked.

As one of the Organization’s best infiltration agents, their specialty was infiltrating heavily guarded places. Being cautious was part of their creed. After observing his surroundings for five minutes, Kell deemed that it was safe to continue his mission.

He had already scanned the ducklings that were following the little girl around like obedient children. They were just ordinary livestock, and Kell didn’t pay too much attention to them. Even the White Goose that was trailing a few steps behind them was nothing special.

After making sure that the coast was clear, he finally moved in to capture his target.

Half of Kell’s body emerged from the ground. He then stretched out his hand to grab the adorable girl and drag her away by force.

He was just about to grab Eve’s arm when a white blur appeared in front of her. Instead of grabbing Eve, Kell grabbed the neck of the White Goose who was looking at him with disdain.

“So, you chose, Death,” the White Goose said in a tone filled with malice. It had long wanted to vent out the frustrations in its heart. With such a good opportunity at hand, how could it possibly let it go?

A bloodcurdling scream rang out from the garden of the Ainsworth Residence, making anyone who heard it shiver.

Not long after, two more screams reverberated from within the main residence.

Eve was currently lying on the ground asleep and being protected by her seven ducklings. The White Goose had cast a sleeping spell on her, because it was afraid that David would once again descend from the Heavens if he showed Eve something that might give her trauma.

The three screams continued to resound within the town of Lont for two full minutes before the surroundings quieted down.

Vlad walked out of the Main Residence holding a man in each hand. He then tossed them aside as if they were pieces of trash before returning inside the house. Jekyll arrived just in time to see his father close the door.

He then stared at the two unconscious men who had ghastly expressions on their faces.

The Dentist of Lont grabbed the two men before proceeding to the garden. There, he found a bloody body and a White Goose whose feathers were now stained with blood.

“Don’t worry, I didn’t kill him… yet,” the White Goose said as he stepped on the man’s hand, crushing all of his bones.

A hoarse scream filled with pain escaped the man’s lips before his eyes rolled up into their sockets as he fainted.

Jekyll appraised the White Goose and nodded his head in appreciation. “You’re not half bad. Are you Eve’s protector?”

“You can say that,” the White Goose replied as it flapped its wings to clear the blood from its feathers. It then used a water spell to clean the blood off of the ground.

“Are you done with him?” Jekyll inquired.

“Yes, you can have him,” the White Goose replied before walking towards Eve. It then used a floating spell to lift the girl from the ground and used the water spell to clean the dirt from her clothes.

He then maneuvered the floating girl back to the residence where she could sleep in her own room. The seven ducklings followed behind Eve and chirped happily as they watched their mother float in the air.

Jekyll chuckled before turning his head to the side.

“Are these friends of yours?” Jekyll asked.

Celine looked down on the three men before firmly nodding her head. “It seems that we have some uninvited guests snooping around.”

Jekyll smiled as he pressed his hand over the heads of the two men. He planned to forcefully scan their memories, which would bring them great pain, but the Dentist couldn’t care less.

Celine watched from the side and looked at Jekyll’s interrogation technique with great interest.

A minute later, Jekyll dropped the two men on the ground and flashed Celine a dazzling smile.

“It seems that we have caught a big fish,” Jekyll said. “Are you familiar with a man named Floyd?”
