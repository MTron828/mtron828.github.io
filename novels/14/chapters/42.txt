Chapter 42: A Father’s Love

The Ainsworth family along with their guests gathered for an early dinner. Although the dishes that were laid out on the table weren’t extravagant, all of them were delicious. When dinner ended, James, Cedric, and Leah went to the living room to relax.

William excused himself and went out to take a stroll with his Mama Ella. Mordred also left the house to check on the survivors from Fushia. He wanted to know if they were in need of other necessities aside from the current supplies that they had provided for them.

Seeing that her “Grandpa” James was in a good mood, Leah decided to ask the question that had been bothering her ever since she arrived at Lont.

“Grandpa, William said that he was the one who landed the killing blow on the Millennial Beast. Is that true?” Leah asked.

Cedric who was seated beside her perked his ears in attention. Although he accepted William’s reasoning, he wanted to know how the little boy managed to do it.

“Yes,” James replied with a smile. “The little bastard almost gave me a heart attack. However, if not for him then Lont might have also ended up in ruins.”

James grinned as he reminisced William’s courageous charge on the battlefield. It was something that made a lasting impression on him.

“Uncle, What kind of Millennial Beast was it?” Cedric asked. His father, Sebas, had taught him a lot when it came to identifying the monsters that belonged to the Forbidden Lands.

“It was a Strathmore Thunder Horned Wolf,” James answered. “That critter is a pain in the bum. One mistake and everything will go boom.”

“Strathmore Thunder Horned Wolf…,” Cedric muttered. “Wait! Thunder Horned Wolf? THAT Thunder Horned Wolf? The one that can use Storm Annihilation?”

“Yes.” James nodded. “That pesky and annoying wolf that only knows how to bring others with it to the afterlife. The bastard is a scummy vermin I tell you. If not for Will, we would have been grievously injured from the explosion.”

“Grandpa, could it be…” Leah looked at James with disbelief. “When William said that he landed the last blow, do you mean it was during the time when the Thunder Horned Wolf was about to unleash its suicide attack?”

“Yes.” James grinned. “The boy got lucky and managed to hit the wolf where it hurts. He was able to cancel the suicide attack. This gave Ella the opportunity to deliver the Death Blow which ended the bastard’s life.”

“Ella?” Leah’s eyes widened in shock. “Will’s Mama Ella? She gave the Death Blow to the Millennial Beast?”

“Unbelievable right?” James chuckled. “Frankly, if I wasn’t there to witness the scene, I wouldn’t have believed it either. It was simply a miracle.”

The siblings exchanged a glance at each other. It never crossed their mind that the narcissistic boy whom they had known for a few years was capable of such a feat.

He was about to say more when he felt a familiar presence just outside the house. James didn’t feel any hostility coming from that presence. Instead, he felt a sense of familiarity.

The “guest” lingered for a time before disappearing completely.

“Grandpa? Is there something wrong?” Leah saw the sudden change in James’ expression and wondered if their questions had somehow offended this kind old man.

“No,” James replied with a smile. “I’ll go out to patrol the town for a bit. The two of you can do anything you want for the time being. Please, make yourselves feel at home.”

James casually walked towards the Eastern side of Lont while humming a tune. The full moon and the countless stars in the heavens illuminated the path in front of him. Soon, he arrived at a grove of trees.

A man wearing a traveler’s cloak was leaning against a tree with his arms crossed over his chest. He had a sturdy build and his aura was that of an expert fighter.

“Aren’t you going to see them?” James asked. “They are very worried about you, you know?”

“Maybe I’ll meet up with my daughter,” the man answered. “As for my son, he needs to stand on his own two feet and see the world for what it really is. I have pampered him long enough.”

Sebas, Cedric’s and Leah’s father, stepped out of the grove and faced James with a determined expression.

“What are your plans?” James raised an eyebrow. “Do you want me to help your son rebuild Fushia?”

“Lord Ainsworth, I leave my children in your hands,” Sebas bowed his head. “I plan to visit some of my old friends and see if they are still alive and well. As for the rebuilding of Fushia, you can talk to my children about it. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Sometimes, I wish that Leah was a boy. She has a good head on her shoulders and she’s talented in magic as well. Although Cedric isn’t a bad candidate… he is just far too naive.”

“You spoiled him too much,” James commented. “Flowers raised in a greenhouse are beautiful, but they will not survive in the wild.”

Sebas nodded his head and thought for a while. “Lord Ainsworth, if possible, please, enroll my son in an academy in the central continent. Maybe, that environment will become beneficial for his growth.”

James nodded his head after careful considerations. He had the same opinion as Sebas. Although Cedric was already twenty years old, he still needed to learn the ways of the world. Both men were worried that he would be taken advantage of by nobles if he remained the same.

“That can be arranged, but how about Leah?” James asked.

“Leah can also be considered a young genius,” Sebas replied with pride. “It would be best if she were to enroll at the Hellan Royal Academy in the capital. I believe that little Matthew is currently studying there, isn’t that right, Lord Ainsworth?”

“Indeed. My grandson is currently studying at the Royal Academy.”

“Then it’s settled. I’m sure that Matthew will look after Leah.”

“Oh? So you knew?” The corner of James’ lips curled up into a smirk.

“How could I possibly not know?” Sebas helplessly shook his head. “Whenever Matthew is in Lont, that good daughter of mine would sneak out of the house to meet him. To this day, I still don’t know what that little girl sees in your grandson.”

James laughed as he patted Sebas’s shoulder. Clearly, he was also very impressed on how Matthew managed to win the affection of the genius girl from Fushia.

“It’s because Matthew inherited my charisma,” James bragged. “I’m sure that Leah saw that he has a lot of potential, so she decided to call dibs on him. Your daughter has good eyes for men.”

Sebas simply nodded his head. He had already accepted that his daughter was smitten with Matthew. The Ainswoth family had a good lineage, so Sebas didn’t have a problem with their union.

His only concern was whether their feelings would stay the same as they grew older. For him, it didn’t matter who Leah married in the end. As long as she was happy, Sebas would give her his blessings.
