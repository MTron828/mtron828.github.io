Chapter 467: Where Do You Think You’re Going?

A few minutes after William left the throne room, the Three Protectors of the Kraetor Empire took their leave as well.

They wanted to see the interesting event that would happen shortly. As Myriad Beasts, they fully understood that Eneru wouldn’t let William get away after he had suffered humiliation in his hands. He would definitely prepare to ambush him, as soon as he left the safety of the Royal Palace.

“Too bad, I kind of like that red-headed brat,” the woman with purple hair said as she narrowed her eyes to observe the Half-Elf who was about to take his leave from the palace.

Nero and the teenage boy with light blue hair didn’t say anything and merely spectated from where they stood. Now that they had formed a Non-Aggression Pact with both parties, they couldn’t extend their help to either side.

Still, the three Myriad Beasts had no doubt in their mind that Eneru would be able to capture William and torture him to his heart’s content.

“The Young Empress seemed to favor him,” the teenage boy commented. “Should we not tell her that the Half-Elf she is interested in is in danger?”

Nero shook his head. “Let’s stay out of this. Besides, isn’t it more interesting this way? We get to see how a Myriad Beast bullies a child. Although I don’t condone this behavior, Eneru is pretty pissed now that you’ve taken his whiskers from him.”

The teenage boy smiled and nodded his head. He didn’t think that he would be able to accomplish his goal so easily. Fortunately, Eneru was under a powerful suppression and was unable to resist him.

William walked without a care in the world and was even whistling as he headed in the direction of the Main Gate that led outside the city.

Naturally, Eneru and the Elves were already waiting for him there. They had even formulated a fool-proof plan in order to prevent the Half-Elf from escaping their grasp.

When William was only a few hundred meters away from the gate, he took a left turn and entered an inn. Naturally, this inn was no longer in business, and only served as a place where the Kraetor Army would spend their time leisurely when they’re not on duty.

Eneru had already locked onto William’s body using his powerful Spiritual Sense. As long as he was inside the City of Veritas, he wouldn’t be able to escape his grasp.

‘The brat is simply delaying the inevitable,’ Eneru snorted. He was very tempted to capture the boy immediately, but he knew that the Half-Elf would fight back. If they were to rampage in the city, and destroy a few properties then the Kraetor Army would not sit idly and fight back.

Eneru didn’t want to experience being handled by the teenage boy with light-blue hair again, so he was willing to endure and just wait for the Half-Elf to leave the city before he moved in to put him in his place.

‘I’ll make sure to torture you first before I end your pitiful life.’ Eneru vowed in his heart.

William was an existence that threatened Eneru’s safety. Because of this, he had already decided to kill him as soon as possible, so that there would be no future complications. Although he would suffer a powerful backlash for killing the Shepherd’s Scion, he wasn’t afraid.

He’d rather suffer a backlash than forever be suppressed by someone’s presence.

“All of you can go back to the Zelan Dynasty,” Eneru ordered. “I am more than enough to deal with the boy.”

“Your Excellency, I also have a grudge against him,” Elandorr replied. “My greatest wish is to see him being tortured and die a very slow, and painful, death. Let me accompany you in dealing with that filthy half blood.”

Eneru had felt Elandorr’s genuine desire to see William’s suffering so he agreed to let him stay. The other Elves were also on the same page, including Alessio, who currently had his arms crossed over his chest.

All of them were waiting for William to appear so that they could teach him a lesson that he would carry with him to the afterlife.

A few minutes passed…

Half an hour passed…

An hour passed…

Two hours passed…

William had still not left the inn and it was already making Eneru, the Elves, and even the Three Protectors impatient.

“Should I go in there and drag him out myself?” the teenage boy proposed. “I don’t like waiting.”

Nero and the purple-haired woman frowned. They, too, were not too fond of waiting, and the boy had already been inside the inn for two hours.

Fortunately, there was someone who was more impatient than them and decided to just get it over with.

Eneru entered the city and headed straight towards the inn that William had visited a few hours ago.

After setting foot inside the inn, Eneru scanned the crowd to look for the boy. However, he only saw the young warriors of the Kraetor Empire enjoying their food and drinks at their leisure.

“Did any of you see the red-headed boy that came in here a few hours ago?” Eneru inquired everyone inside the room. Although he felt beneath him to ask teenage Humans about the whereabouts of the boy, he had no choice but to compromise, since he could feel the pressure of the Three Protectors that were locked onto his body.

“Are you talking about the boy who went to the bathroom to take a dump?” One of the warriors answered. “Now that you mention it, he hasn’t ever come out of the bathroom since then.”

Eneru nodded his head and hurriedly walked towards the bathroom. Tendrils of lightning crackled in his right hand as he pushed the door using his left. He was about to unleash the concentrated lightning bolt in his hand when he noticed that something was wrong. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘He’s not here!’ Eneru’s eyes widened. ‘How could that be?!’

Ever since William entered the inn, he had focused his spiritual sense inside it and made sure that the Half-Elf wouldn’t be able to leave undetected.

However, even with that, William was still able to escape from right under his nose!

The Three Protectors were also surprised. They had already lit a candle inside their hearts for the arrogant Half-Elf, but the latter was nowhere to be seen.

Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away from the Capital City of Veritas…

A loud explosion reverberated in the air followed by a neighing sound filled with pain. A few moments later, a four meter tall, Dark Blue Horse, fell on the lake’s surface, creating a big splash, and sending the rest of its herd running.

Even though it was in great pain, the Dark Blue Horse forced its body to dive deeper in the lake to escape the red-headed boy that had appeared out of nowhere.

“Where do you think you’re going?” William asked as he summoned a hundred-meter long water whip that fished it out of the Dark Blue Horse from the water, before hurtling it towards the shore.

The Dark Blue Horse tried to break free from its binding, but William’s Water whip held it in place. The red-headed boy then raised his right hand and aimed it at the struggling beast that was a few meters away from him.

“Beast Taming!”

An orb of light shot out from William’s hand and collided with the fallen Beast, who had no power to resist. Soon its entire body was enveloped by a white light.

While all of this was going on, a certain Qilin was very close to unleashing a lightning storm in the City of Veritas in order to force William to come out from his hiding place.

The Three Protectors had also arrived and ordered the people inside the inn to evacuate. They were also there to investigate how the boy had managed to escape from their surveillance.

Empress Sidonie looked at the crystal ball in her hand, and watched the commotion happening inside the inn with a smile. Although she didn’t know how William was able to leave the city undetected, she was still happy that the boy she liked was safe from harm.

If only she knew that her beloved was busy plundering the resources of her Kingdom, Empress Sidonie might have immediately ordered the Three Protectors to apprehend him and bring him back to the capital in chains.

That way, she could ensure that he wouldn’t do anything mischievous behind her back, as well as keep him safe from a Qilin, and a few Elves, who were dead set on hacking him into pieces.
