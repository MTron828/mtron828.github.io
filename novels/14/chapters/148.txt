Chapter 148: Might Over Magic [Part 2]

When Layla announced the start of the battle, the first thing that Spencer did was to take a few steps backwards.

The students of the Martial Class didn’t understand why he acted this way. However, they soon found out the reason for their representative’s actions.

Several two-meter-tall steel spikes protruded in a straight line from the place where Spencer stood a while ago.

“Slaughter Domain!” Wendy shouted as she stabbed her spear towards the ground. Her magical power exploded and hundreds of steel spikes appeared all over the coliseum. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the entire battleground was similar to the back of a porcupine that had all its quills standing up.

Spencer found himself inside a steel forest with no path to advance nor retreat. This was not the first time that Wendy had used this move against him, but, back then, she didn’t intend to hurt him. Now it was different.

Spencer could feel the pent up anger in his twin sister’s words earlier and knew that she wanted to vent her frustrations on him. Even though Spencer was quite a capable fighter, he really couldn’t find it in his heart to hurt his little sister.

The cool-looking boy channeled his strength into his spear and spun it around him creating a whirling storm. The steel around him was sliced off like bamboo poles as he advanced towards his sister, who was looking at him from the center of the Coliseum.

Wendy jabbed the spear in her hand in her Big Brother’s direction and the Slaughter Domain answered her call.

The steel spikes shot out from the ground and rained down on Spencer like a hail of arrows.

Spencer roared and spun his spear in front of him to deflect the incoming barrage. Tinkling sounds could be heard as Spencer’s spear deflected the downpour of steel spikes that seemed to be unending.

It was then that he heard a mighty roar as the steel that he had deflected flew up into the air to form a Blade Liger.

‘She’s really going all out!’ Spencer thought as he gritted his teeth.

The Blade Liger roared once more before charging towards him with a vengeance. It was over four-meters tall and each part of it was as deadly as Wendy’s eyes, who were looking at him with the intention to kill!

“Good thing, I don’t have a little sister.” William gulped as he watched this scene unfold. “Mama, our little Eve is a good girl, right? She won’t do these kinds of things to me when she grows up, right?”

“Meeeeeh.”

“Phew. I better send her some candies in our next package headed for Lont.”

“Meeeeh.”

Spencer did his best to resist the attacks of the steel rain and the Blade Liger, but it was to no avail. Actually, it was not impossible to win the battle. However, he would have to force himself to kill his little sister.

This was something that Spencer couldn’t do even if there was an enchantment inside the Coliseum.

Soon, the steel spears embedded themselves inside his body. Spencer did his best to protect his vitals as he fended off the persistent attack of the Blade Liger.

Wiliam sighed as he closed his eyes. The cool-looking boy had already apologized to him. Spencer had no intention of winning the battle. His purpose in accepting the challenge was to endure his little sister’s hatred and try to ease her heartache.

“Meeeeeeh.” Ella bleated softly as if to tell William that the battle was over.

Spencer’s body turned into particles of light and the members of the Magic Division cheered for their victory.

“This leaves a bad aftertaste,” Drake spat on the ground. Although he felt bitter, he had already seen the outcome of the battle when he saw Spencer’s lonely back as he went to confront his little sister. That was the back of a man that had no intention of winning.

It was not only him, Conrad and his lackeys had spent a lot of time with Spencer, Drake, and Priscilla during the past two weeks. Their relationship had grown a bit closer and, although they were still rivals, they had accepted each other as members of the Martial Class Division.

“Head Prefect, allow me to fight next,” Drake said as he stepped forward.

“Go.” William waved his hand. “Show them the might of our Martial Class Division!”

Drake grunted in affirmation as he took center stage. His eyes then locked on Est who was standing in front of the Magic Class Division. He wanted to challenge him, but he was afraid that William wanted to fight Est as well.

As if sensing his hesitation, William called out from behind him.

“Challenge anyone you like,” William ordered. “Don’t worry. Even if you lose, I am more than enough to secure our win.”

Drake silently thanked William inside his heart as he pointed his greatsword towards Est.

“I, Drake Vi Craig, challenge the Head Prefect of the Magic Class Division,” Drake shouted. “Do you dare to accept my challenge?”

Est glanced at William, and the latter only gave him the thumbs up sign. Seeing that William had no intention of interfering in the challenge, Est nodded his head and walked forward to meet the one who challenged him. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Go Head Prefect!”

“Beat that ugly boy and show them the power of Mages!”

“Show them our superior might!”

The students of the Magic Class Division cheered for their handsome Head Prefect. Although they didn’t know who Drake was, they were sure that their Head Prefect wouldn’t lose to a muscle-brained barbarian boy.

Est gave Drake a brief nod of acknowledgement as he unsheathed Rhapsody, the sword that was given to him by the Goddess Astrid. The sword rang the moment its body had been fully exposed as if announcing its presence to the world.

Est took a pose holding Rhapsody in his right hand, while holding the sheath in the other. With a glance, one could tell that he planned to fight using both of them at the same time.

‘Dual wielding? Not bad.’ William grinned. ‘I guess the battle against the Cyclops made you realize your shortcomings. This is gonna be good.’

William focused his attention on the battle that was about to take place. It had been four years since he last saw Est fight and he was hoping that his first friend outside of Lont had grown stronger. There were only a few people that he could trust inside the Academy and Est was one of them.
