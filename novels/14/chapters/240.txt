Chapter 240: I’m Rolling!

‘Did its power degrade after being frozen in Ice?’ William inquired. He then looked at the rainbow-colored creature that had been confined inside the block of ice for thousands of years.

[ It is highly possible. According to the simulations that I made, it would take at least, tens of thousands of years before a Demigod would degrade to this level.]

‘The poor thing,’ William thought. The Half-Elf had a good impression of the Kasogonaga because it was a Demigod that aided humanity during their time of need. He thought of Spire back in the enchanted forest.

The Guardian of the Herd was a Pacifist and disliked conflicts. However, it would not take a step back if someone threatened the safety of its herd. William had a feeling that the Kasogonaga was similar to Spire, and decided to set the creature free on behalf of the humans that it had saved in the past.

‘Just what kind of being could freeze a Demigod?’ William asked the system.

[ Host, only a Demigod can fight a Demigod. Maybe the Kasogonaga was defeated in a fight against Demigods and was imprisoned in this block of ice. According to my hypothesis, the Magic Crystal Mine was used to keep the seal in place. Now that it’s gone, it is only a matter of time before the Demigod will break free. ]

William scratched his head, “Should we break it ourselves, or wait until the seal is completely broken?”

Before the system could even give an answer, a cracking sound reverberated in the cavern.

William took a defensive stance as several cracks appeared on the surface of the ice prison in front of him.

Soon, the block of ice shattered into a hundred pieces, creating a misty cloud of ice.

William’s breath grew ragged as the temperature around him drastically lowered. A minute later, the mist disappeared and a creature that was considered a myth stared at him with bloodshot eyes.

Before William could even say anything, the Kasogonaga raised its head and shouted…

“I’m Rolling!”

The small Anteater then curled its body into a ball and flew in William’s direction. Clearly, it was pissed off, and the Half-Elf just happened to be there to become a medium for it to vent out its anger.

-

William dodged to the side and evaded the “rainbow-colored-scaled-ball” that was only slightly bigger than a basketball. The Kasogonaga hit the wall of the cavern, but it simply bounced off and resumed its pursuit of William.

“Wait! Why are you attacking me?” William asked in frustration as he rolled to the side to evade the crazy Deity of the Sky.

“You long-eared bastards! How dare you and that stupid, big-boobed, Elf Goddess imprison me?!” The enraged Anteater shouted as it continued to attack William. “Bunch of ingrates! Humans are much better than you long-eared hypocrites! Even if the other Demigods forgive you, I won’t forgive you!”

As if answering to its anger, its speed gradually increased with each bounce it made on the walls of the cavern. At the start, William could still evade it, but the drastic increase in its speed made the Half-Elf resort to desperate measures.

‘System!’

[ Spearman Job Class now activated! ]

William summoned his wooden staff and used it like a baseball bat to hit the rolling anteater that was not planning to listen to reason.

When the staff hit the beast, a loud clap reverberated in the cavern creating a mini-shockwave.

William skidded on the ground as he prepared to hit the Kasogonaga for the second time. Just like a never ending tennis match, the two fought in a ridiculous manner. However, it seemed that the Kasogonaga realized that it was not strong enough to beat William in its current state.

Although its power had degenerated due to being imprisoned for tens of thousands of years, it was still a Deity and had plenty of tricks up its sleeve. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

William was about to hit it again with his wooden staff when he immediately rolled to the side to make an emergency evasion. There was no way he would dare to face the rolling disaster head-on after it had made last minute changes in its physique.

The Kasogonaga had increased in size, and it was now a two-meter-tall, rainbow-colored-wrecking ball!

The Kasogonaga bounced off the wall and this time, the rebound was so fast that William had no time to evade. The “rainbow” wrecking ball hit him in the chest which sent him slamming towards the wall of the cavern, creating a cloud of dust.

William only received minor injuries because he was able to equip his Golden-Scaled Armor at the last minute before he was hit by the rolling disaster.

‘System, is there a way we can beat this thing?’ William inquired. Although he was in a disadvantageous situation, he didn’t panic and decided to consult the system.

[ This cavern is still unstable and under the influence of the God Domain. If the host wants to take a risk, there is a way, but it is equally dangerous.’

‘What is it? If I am able to escape this predicament then I will cooperate.’

[ Very well, what we are going to do is this… ]

While the two were talking, the Kasogonaga didn’t follow up with another attack and simply hovered in the air a few meters away from where William had fallen.

“Hahaha! Foolish Elf,” The Kasogonaga roared while still spinning in mid-air. “You and your stupid Goddess will pay the price of imprisoning this Deity! When I regain my Divinity, I will drown your continent until all of you bastards start to grow fins!

“However, since you were the one who freed me from that prison, I will end your life and give you a proper burial. Be thankful because a Deity will personally bury you! Now, Die!”

William extended his hand with the intention of “catching” the two-meter wrecking ball that charged towards him.

The moment his hand touched Kasogonaga’s curled up body, the enraged Sky Deity disappeared from the cavern.

-

[ Transfer successful! ]

[ Kasogonaga has been successfully relocated to the North of the Thousand Beast Domain! ]

-

William sighed in relief as he lay on the ground while panting. Fortunately, the God Domain that they had created to transfer the Magic Crystal Mine was still active. With its help, the system was able to forcefully transfer the Sky Deity to William’s Thousand Beast Domain.

Although the Half-Elf and the System were worried that their guest would turn their domain upside down, it was a risk that they had to take. They had been left with no other alternative. All they could do was trap the enraged Deity inside the domain to keep William from getting hurt more.

William closed his eyes and observed his domain from the sky. The Kasogonaga had landed near the Candelabra Tree, which was the territory of the Rainbow Birds, but due to the fact that they reminded him of a certain game he played back on Earth, he gave them the nickname Angray Birds.

As soon as it felt that it was in a different environment, the Kasogonaga landed on the ground while still in its curled up state and observed its surroundings.

The Angray Birds that were nesting on their tree looked down at the “unwanted guest” that appeared in their home turf.

Angray Bird 1: “Wtf?”

Angray Bird 2: “F*ck off!”

Kasogonaga: “Where am I? Speak dumb birds!”

Angray Birds: “Say what?!”

Angray Birds: “F*ck off!”

The Angray Birds were only Class E (Mid) Beasts, but they were a very rowdy bunch. All of them had different colors and abilities, but they all had one thing in common, and that was that they were all “aggressive birds”.

They flapped their wings and attacked the Kasogonaga by ramming it with their bodies. William was surprised because what the birds were doing was practically suicide, but what happened next made his eyes widen in shock.

When a red colored bird hit the Kasogonaga, it exploded like a grenade. Red feathers scattered in the air showing that the bird had been completely decimated by the explosion. However, on top of the Candelabra Tree a red egg appeared. This egg would hatch after twenty four hours and the Angray bird that died would be reborn again.

The other birds also attacked the Kasogonaga with a vengeance. The orange birds inflicted Earth Damage, the yellow birds inflicted a Stunning Effect, and the green ones inflicted Wind Damage.

When the blue birds exploded, they inflicted Water Damage. The indigo colored birds inflicted “Slashing” Physical Damage, and the violet ones dealt Blunt Physical Damage.

William “almost” felt sorry for the pitiful Kasogonaga who was forced to run away due to the relentless assault of the Angray Birds. Shouts of “Fck you!, Fck Off!, Say What?!” and the likes accompanied the fleeting Sky Deity as it rolled away to escape the birds that gave it a culture shock.

“You bastard Elf! If you have guts, come and face me! Let’s fight two-hundred rounds!” the Kasogonaga roared in anger. “Come out and fight me!”

William snorted as he let his consciousness return to the real world. He still had things to do, and the Rainbow Anteater wouldn’t be going anywhere anytime soon.

Since that was the case, he would just focus on the task at hand, getting to the Third Peak before dealing with this creature that seemed to have a very strong grudge against the Elven Race.
