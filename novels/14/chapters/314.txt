Chapter 314: The Next Stage Of The Shepherd Job Class

Great Chief Evander personally welcomed the arrival of Prince Ernest and his Granddaughter to the Kyrintor Mountains.

The Oracle had informed him a day ago that representatives would arrive from the Hellan Kingdom and they should be treated as VIP Guests.

After the last incident with William, Great Chief Evander had regained his calm and understood what he needed to do.

The residence of the Great Chieftain was located at the Middle of the Mountain, while the rest of the tribes were near its base. They only went to the Third, Second, and First Peaks during special events, so they spent most of their days within their corresponding strongholds.

Great Chief Evander didn’t say anything when he saw William’s current state. He just made sure that the order of the Oracle was carried out properly. Also, in order to prevent any mishaps, he ordered his second son, Connal to go to Cadell’s stronghold at the base of the mountain to prevent anyone from entering their domain.

The Oracle had given all the Tribes explicit orders to not leave the mountain while the war between the Hellan Kingdom and the Two Dynasties was taking place. This was in accordance with the decree that was passed by their Sovereign, which everyone in the Kyrintor Mountains obeyed with reverence.

Ian was in the midst of changing William’s clothes when the little loli, Brianna, barged inside the room.

“Oh, sorry,” Brianna said when she saw Ian taking off William’s shirt. “Please, don’t let me disturb you. Carry on with what you are about to do.”

Ian couldn’t possibly allow the little girl to see his lover’s naked body, so he decided to ask Brianna the reason for her visit.

“Is there something you need, Lady Brianna?” Ian asked.

The little loli smiled mischievously as he approached William’s bed. “Do you need help taking his clothes off? I can help you do that.”

“I can manage them myself, Lady Brianna. Please, don’t bother yourself with the Commander’s needs because I will be here to take care of him.”

“Is that so…”

There was a hint of disappointment in Brianna’s voice. Even so, her disappointment didn’t last long as her small hands caressed the sides of William’s face.

“I haven’t had the time to see him after the incident at the Grand Coliseum,” Brianna commented as she marvelled at the softness of William’s face, which was the complete opposite of his rough hands.

“Ernest gets jealous easily, so I didn’t get the chance to check his condition up close while we were inside the carriage during our journey. How is he? Do you know when he’ll wake up?”

“He’s recovering,” Ian replied as his eyes focused on Brianna’s hands that were caressing William’s cheeks. He was very tempted to pry the little Loli’s hands away, but he knew that he couldn’t make a scene inside the Great Chieftain’s residence. “As for when he will wake up, I have no clue. I hope he wakes up soon.”

Brianna nodded her head sadly. “I hope for that as well. Big Brother is a good person. If he hadn’t been there during the ceremony, I don’t know what might have happened to me by now.”

Ian sighed internally and cursed the unconscious Half-Elf who was being pampered by the Tribes’ little princess.

After a minute had passed, Brianna’s hands had moved from William’s cheeks to his ears then to his neck then back to his cheeks.

For some reason, Ian felt uncomfortable with other girls touching William so intimately. Especially girls whom William hadn’t acknowledged as one of his lovers. Although he knew that Brianna and William shared a close relationship, it was more of a “brother and sister relationship” than lovers.

“Say, do you like him?” Brianna suddenly asked as she shifted her attention to the older boy.

“I do,” Ian replied without batting an eye.

Brianna nodded as if she had already expected this answer from Ian.

“I can see it in your eyes. The way you look at him is that of tenderness and affection. However, does Big Brother know?”

“Yes.”

“Really?” The little loli’s eyes sparkled as if she had discovered a very juicy piece of gossip. “Big Brother is fine with it?”

“Yes,” Ian replied.

“I see.” Brianna smiled before reluctantly pulling her hand away from William’s face. “You and Big Brother are our special guests. If you need something, don’t hesitate to ask. The residence of the Great Chief will do our best to accommodate your needs.”

“Thank you.” Ian nodded. “I will take note of it.”

Brianna gave William one last glance before leaving the room. She couldn’t stay for long because she knew that Ernest would come looking for her. The Youngest Prince of the Hellan Kingdom was very wary of William.

Prince Ernest was afraid that the Half-Elf would take his Big Sister’s affection away from him, and make Brianna his fiance. Because of this, the Prince was feeling anxious which made Brianna, as well as Simon, shake their heads helplessly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Five minutes after Brianna left the room, Ian resumed changing William’s clothes into more comfortable ones. He then laid beside William and used Synchronization.

It was unsafe for her to transform inside the residence of the Great Chieftain, so she just settled with having her mermaid form inside William’s Sea of Consciousness. She hoped, more than anything, that the boy she had loved for four years, would once again open his eyes and hold her in his warm embrace.

Meanwhile in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods…

“You look more manly now, Big Brother,” Lily said as she eyed him up and down. “I guess being trained by the Goddess of Lust would turn even the meekest of sheep into a raging bull ready to battle.”

William smiled and patted the loli’s head. “And you’re still as cute as ever, Lily.”

Lily giggled as she allowed William to pat her head. It had been many years since a mortal had done that to her and it made her feel nostalgic.

“Very good.” Issei nodded in appreciation. He also felt the change in William’s aura and it made the red-headed boy look more confident. After entering Eros’ Domain, the Teddy Bear that was used to hold William’s consciousness, had been remodeled to become a near-perfect replica of his body.

Because of this, he didn’t need to return to his “cuddly form” in order to continue his training.

David cleared his throat and made a gesture for William to follow him. He was the boy’s final instructor, and the last hurdle before William could return to his own world.

It didn’t take long for the two of them to arrive at David’s Residence. Issei and Lily followed David because they were curious about what kind of training the God of Shepherds would give William. David didn’t mind them tagging along because they were his good friends and William’s supporters.

The God of Shepherds took them to a room where a golden portal glowed brightly.

Seeing the portal, William remembered when he stood beside the Cycle of Reincarnation. If not for that incident with Truck-kun, he might have entered a different portal and lived a different life than the one he currently had.

“William, your Shepherd Job Class has reached its max level, correct?” David asked as he looked at the Golden Portal at the center of the room.

“Yes,” William replied.

David turned his head to look at the boy with a smile. “Since that is the case, you need to ‘Upgrade’ your Job Class to its next stage. Usually, Shepherds are not supposed to have any Advanced Classes or anything, but since you are a good boy, I prepared three Advanced Classes that you can choose from.”

“Thank you, Sir David.” William grinned. ‘I always wondered what the next stage of the Shepherd Class would be. Now, I will finally see it with my own eyes.’

David waved his hand and three choices appeared in front of William.

The boy excitedly checked the new classes that David had given him with a big smile on his face. He felt blessed that David had taken his time to prepare special classes just for him.

However, a few seconds later, the smile on his face became stiff as he finished reading the information of the classes that were presented to him.

-

[ Advance Job Classes ]

[ Option 1 ]

[ Big Daddy Shepherd ]

“Spank me Daddy One More Time.”

-

[ Option 2 ]

[ Big PP Shepherd ]

“The Bigger they are, the Harder they are!”

-

[ Option 3 ]

[ Small PP Shepherd ]

“It’s not the Size that matters. It’s the Performance!”

——

William almost spat blood then and there after reading the information of each Job Class. He would rather keep the Shepherd Job Class in its basic state than choose any of the horrible classes that David had prepared for him.
