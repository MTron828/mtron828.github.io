Chapter 443: A War Cannot Be Won By A Single Individual

Sounds of weapons clashing echoed inside the wide cavern as Elves, Humans, Goblins, Beasts, and members of the Minotaur Race, fought with wild abandon.

The teleportation gates of the Elves were built deep under the ground, protected by several layers of enchantment. These enchantments should have been enough to prevent the Freedom Fighters from barging in.

However, these solid defenses broke apart in the face of…

“I’m Rolling!”

Kasogonaga slammed against the Elven Barrier and broke it instantly. Its rainbow-colored scales were not only incredibly hard and sturdy, they were also capable of destroying barriers with ease.

Aside from being called the Rolling Calamity, it was also known by another title, which was none other than Shield Breaker.

The two-meter-tall rainbow-colored wrecking ball slammed against the Elven Defenders without any intention of backing down. Its hatred of the Elves had superseded every other emotion it had as it killed, killed, and killed more!

Due to the Millennial Ants it had eaten and the Magical Energy it had absorbed within the Magic Crystal Cavern, Kasogonaga had managed to reach the Centennial Rank. it was now a force to be reckoned with and its hate fueled its power even further.

“Wow, scary,” Psoglav commented as he pierced the body of an Elf girl with its bastard sword made from Dark Energy. After the Elf breathed her last, the Demonic Dog sneakily tossed her corpse inside the special ring in its possession.

It had promised William that it wouldn’t eat Humans. But, Psoglav didn’t say anything about not eating Elves, especially dead Elves that it had slain with its own hands.

The heated battle continued for an hour before the Alliance breached the Elves’ final line of defense. Hundreds of dead bodies laid on the cavern floor. There was a mix of Humans, Goblins, Beasts, and Elves.

Paul panted as he stared at the gate that was nearing completion in the distance.

“You’ve done well in reaching this far,” one of the Archmages said as his hands glowed with power. “But this is where your journey ends.”

Two Blademasters, two Archmages, and hundreds of Elves stood to protect the gate that would connect them to their homeland.

The other two Blademasters and Archmages had been left in the Zelan Capital to oversee its protection. They didn’t expect that a bunch of ragtag misfits would dare to intrude upon the place where they decided to build their teleportation gate.

“Really?” Jekyll inquired with a mischievous smile plastered on his face. “You think the four of you are enough to stop us?”

“More than enough,” one of the Blademasters snorted as he unsheathed his blade. “As for you, we will deal with you as well, traitorous b*tch!”

Celine covered her lips and chuckled. She ignored the Blademaster who cursed at her and eyed the gate with great interest.

“We should have killed you when you were still a child,” one of the Archmages spat on the ground. “Filth of the Elven Race.”

The two Blademasters unleashed their Sword Auras, which pushed back the teenagers who were standing behind Jekyll and Celine. Psoglav, who bullied the weak and feared the strong, stood behind the children and watched from afar.

Kasogonaga, who was at the forefront of the Alliance, narrowed its eyes as it prepared to strike.

“Paul, take the others and guard the entrance of the cave,” Jekyll ordered. “We will handle the rest.”

“Understood,” Paul replied. He knew that he and the other Freedom Fighters would only be a burden in a battle of this magnitude. The only way they could help Jekyll and Celine was to stay far away, so that they wouldn’t be caught in any friendly fire.

In the end, only Jekyll, Celine, and Kasogonaga remained to face off against the strong Elven Force that was stationed to protect the teleportation gate.

“I’ll handle the two Blademasters,” Jekyll said. “Can you handle the Archmages?”

“Naturally,” Celine replied. “Kasogonaga, I’ll leave the small fries to you.”

“Very well.” The Rainbow-Colored Anteater stomped its foot on the ground as it transformed into a two-meter tall wrecking ball. “Ready when you are.”

Jekyll laughed as he transformed into his true form. A giant beast that stood ten-meters tall roared as it opened its massive mouth.

“It’s you!” one of the Archmages yelled in anger. “You’re that hateful Human’s Beast Companion!”

Dark Energy enveloped Celine’s body and transformed her clothing into a black latex armor that highlighted the curves of her body. If this was any other time, the young Elves might have stopped to admire her beauty. However, knowing who Celine was, made them look at her in a hateful manner.

Celine didn’t care what they thought, because she didn’t care about the opinions of the soon-to-be-dead Elves that looked at her in disgust.

She summoned a Deathscythe and twirled it around before taking a fighting stance. It was not only Kasogonaga who hated the Elves. Celine hated them too, which was why she joined Deus in the first place.

He wanted The Organization to help her massacre the hateful Elves who made her life a living hell.

Meanwhile inside the Palace of the Zelan Dynasty…

[ … Darling is amazing ]

Morgana muttered as she watched the vision that Empress Sidonie had shared with her. She watched as William pounded the Silver Dragon repeatedly, leaving only a strand of life in its body.

Empress Sidonie, on the other hand, observed the capabilities of William’s clones with a serious expression. As a military strategist, she needed to get as much information as possible about the important people that could tilt the scales of the war in any direction. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Originally, she thought that William was strong. Her guess was that the boy she loved was in the middle stages of the Platinum Rank, which was already considered a True Prodigy, even among the empires within the Central Continent.

However, the fighting prowess that she had witnessed had surpassed her initial estimate.

“A Saint,” Empress Sidonie muttered softly.

She then narrowed her eyes as she appraised every move that William made.

‘This might be some kind of ability that can only be used for a short period of time. Also, I believe that Sir William has just recently gained this ability,’ Sidonie thought. ‘If he had this before the Demon Invasion, he wouldn’t have suffered from a coma.’

Empress Sidonie was a rational individual. There were several artifacts that could boost a person’s strength drastically for a short period of time. These were abilities that were only used as a Last Resort due to the extreme penalties that they had.

[ Well, I believe that you are right in your hunch. ]

Morgana chimed in because she could also read Sidonie’s thoughts.

[ But, that doesn’t change the fact that the difficulty of conquering Darling will have to be raised due to this Heaven Defying ability of his. I mean, if he used that golden metallic-rod against us then the Ant Queen would have been dead by now, right? ]

Empress Sidonie agreed with her other half’s conjecture. Somehow, she felt slightly irritated because William’s abilities seemed to perfectly counter her own.

The Half-Elf was immune to her Charm.

William also had Kasogonaga, that rainbow-colored Anteater that could send all of the Warrior Ants running away in fear.

Lastly, this new ability of his gave her a headache. It was so domineering, that she felt her heart beat wildly inside her chest. Her desire to beat the boy she loved ignited the Power of Lust that laid dormant within her body.

‘One step at a time,’ Empress Sidonie mused as she shifted her attention to the battle that was currently happening on the other side of the Zelan Dynasty.

‘A war cannot be won by a single individual.’ Empress Sidonie was well aware that no matter how strong William was, he was not invincible.

The corner of her lips curled up as she observed the intense battle that was being waged at the location of the Elven Teleportation Gate. Just like watching a movie, Empress Sidonie wanted to see whether this attack against the Elves would have a good or bad ending.

Her finger lightly tapped the armchair of her throne as millions of chirping sounds reached her ears. These were the replies of her million strong army that she could command anytime, anywhere.

They waited, ever patiently, for the time that they would make their presence known, and trample those who dared to stand in their way under their feet.
