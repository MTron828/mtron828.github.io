1259 He Who Must Not Be Born [Part 2]

“Gavin! Knock that boy unconscious!” Eros said as she stood between Ahriman and William, while unleashing purple fireballs at the Primordial God, who was being bombarded by beams of light descending from the heavens.

Adephagia, Astrid, and Lyssa, also surrounded Ahriman and attacked him simultaneously, using the cover fire from the Constellation in the sky to their advantage. This was a heaven-sent opportunity, so the Goddesses didn’t hesitate and attacked the Primordial God of Darkness without any shred of mercy.

Being besieged from all directions, Ahriman decided to ignore that Half-Elf for now and focus on pushing back the Goddesses whose attacks were doing a good number on his body.

“Snap out of it boy!” Gavin shouted as he smacked William’s head, who was like a wild animal that was out for blood.

The black-haired teenager roared in anger after his head was struck, making him glare at the God of All Trades who was already missing a left arm.

“Graaaaaaaaaah!” William clawed Gavin’s head in order to retaliate for attacking him, but the God nimbly dodged his attack by stepping to the side before kneeing the Half-Elf’s stomach, making the latter’s body bend like a cooked shrimp.

Gavin delivered another powerful blow on the black-haired teenager’s head, making the latter faceplant on the ground, rendering him unconscious.

The God of All Trades was prepared to give another smack to William’s head, but stopped when he noticed that his follower had already stopped moving.

“Goodness, just what happened back there?” Gavin muttered as he rolled the Half-Elf over so he was facing the sky.

William’s face slowly returned to its previous self. His fangs decreased in size, and his face became a lot more peaceful.

Gavin looked at William’s clothes, which no longer offered any kind of protection. They were more like rags rather than clothes, which showed just how intense the fight the Half-Elf had was back in the Central Continent.

‘What to do?’ Gavin thought as he glanced at the unconscious Half-Elf before shifting his gaze to the four Goddesses that were slowly being pushed back by the Primordial God of Darkness and Chaos.

Ahriman’s strength may not be at his peak, but he was still a God that had been in Hestia for thousands of years. Unlike Adephagia, Eros, Astrid, and Lyssa, who had descended to the mortal realm, the Primordial God’s powers were still stronger than them because the Goddesses’ powers had been decreased drastically in order for them to materialize in the mortal realm.

They didn’t use any special tools like the Celestial Raiment that allowed them to use more than half of their powers whenever their Divine Bodies descended to the world. Even so, the four of them were still able to prevent Ahriman from advancing towards the unconscious Half-Elf who was now being guarded by his Patron God, Gavin.

While the God of All Trades was pondering what to do next, a pained moan reached his ears.

William, who was lying on the ground, opened his eyes and looked at his Patron God with a face filled with injustice.

“That hurt, Gavin,” William complained. Although his hair was still as black as darkness, his eye color had changed to green.

“Will, I’m sorry,” Gavin replied as he crouched down and helped his follower prop himself up from the ground. “Are you alright?”

“No,” WIlliam answered. “The other half of my soul is temporarily knocked out, so I took this opportunity to help.”

The Half-Elf’s gaze landed on the Primordial God of Darkness and Chaos. His curled up fists made cracking sounds as he looked at the God who was responsible for the deaths of his wives.

“Will, I know how you feel, but you being here isn’t helping anyone,” Gavin stated as he rested his hand on William’s shoulder.

He knew that now was not the time to sugarcoat things and comfort the Half-Elf. More than anything else, he wanted William to leave so that the five of them could focus on attacking Ahriman without worrying about his safety.

“I understand your concern, Gavin,” William commented while his gaze was still fixed on Ahriman’s face that looked back at him with contempt. “But, this is something that I need to do. Don’t worry, I have no intention of getting captured. I am able to think clearly now, so you don’t have to worry about me.”

“Are you sure about this?”

“Yes. Please, don’t stop me.”

Gavin sighed before reluctantly nodding his head.

“I understand, but as you can see, we are unable to defeat him in a short time,” Gavin stated. “We lack the final nail in the coffin to finish him off.”

William chuckled after hearing Gavin’s words. Instead of answering, he closed his eyes as he accessed the system.

‘Optimus, temporarily unlock the functions of the system and prepare to merge all the Job Classes we acquired together,’ William ordered. ‘Unlock the 4th Subclass in my Status Page.’

Gavin’s eyes widened in shock because he had completely forgotten the power of his Divinity that lay dormant inside William’s body.

Optimus had temporarily sealed the power to merge all the Job Classes that William had acquired, and several other functions of the system due to the possibility that the corrupted Half-Elf would use it to cause havoc within the world of Hestia.

Right now, the part of his soul that was still untouched by the corruption had temporarily taken control of his body in order to deal with the Primordial God that had killed his wives.

As the multiple Job Classes merged together to create the ultimate Job Class for William to use, his ranks also started to rise at a rapid pace until he made a breakthrough and reached the Middle-Stage Pseudo-God Realm.

‘Optimus, make sure to add the Divinity that sleeps in my soul,’ William commanded. ‘Even if you merge all the Job Classes together, it will be of no use if you don’t add something that will actually hurt this bastard.’

< ... Understood. But, if you do this this Job Class will be sealed for an indefinite period of time. >

‘That’s fine,’ William replied. ‘After using this ability, I will hibernate inside the Bell of Amalthea. Also, my other half isn’t stable right now. Allowing him to use this Job Class will threaten the balance of the Divine Realm. It is best that it be sealed indefinitely. Besides, I made a promise to her...’

William glanced at the constellation that was shining brightly in the heavens. In order for William to emerge from the Bell of Amalthea without being corrupted, the Constellation ceased attacking Ahriman and focused on protecting his soul instead, in fear that the Primordial Goddess would take this opportunity to merge the two halves of William’s soul together, corrupting them completely.

<... Understood. >

< Adding Ancient Divinity to Merging of Job Classes. >

< Due to the host’s incomplete soul, the end result failed to reach its Max Potential. >

< Final Job Class unlocked >

William’s eyes turned golden as the power that resided inside him burst out from his body.

“Assal, Come to me,” William ordered.

The spear, Stormcaller, appeared beside William with lightning enshrouding its entire body. The reason why the spear was called Stormcaller, was due to the fact that no mortal could call upon its true name.

However, William had temporarily surpassed being a mortal. Because of this, he was able to call forth Stormcaller’s true name, which was Assal.

It was one of the four magical items that belonged to the Gods of Tuatha Dé Danann.

No battle was ever victorious against it, or against the man who held it.

William grabbed the spear in his hand that belonged to the Gods of Old. A spear that belonged to the Sun God, Lugh, whom the Half-Elf held a grudge with.

“This is for my wives...,” William said as a thunderous clap of thunder, followed by tens of thousands of lightning bolts descended towards the spear in his hand, making the sands under his feet churn up, and the entirety of the Demon Continent shake uncontrollably.

“Lightning God War Art Final Form...”

Gavin, who was standing beside William, had to retreat as far as he could because the lightning that was surrounding the Half-Elf had started to cause injuries to the God of All Trades’ Divine Body.

The black-haired teenager whose eyes were glowing golden focused his attention on the Primordial God of Darkness whose expression had become grim after sensing the incredible amount of Divinity that was being stored inside the Lightning Spear’s body.

“Make the World tremble in your presence,” William declared. “Annihilate all opposition, Assal!”
