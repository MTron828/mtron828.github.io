Chapter 445: Ignorant Child

“What’s with all the shaking?” Wendy asked as she sat on top of Thor.

They were guarding the entrance of the cavern and their role was to stop any reinforcements coming from the outside.

Est, Isaac, Dave, Conrad, Crown Prince Alaric, Princess Aila, and Sharx-the Goblin Marauder-were also keeping watch outside the Cavern.

They had already repelled several groups of Elven reinforcements who had been notified that a small army composed of Humans and Beasts had launched a surprise attack on their Teleportation Gate.

The tremors intensified and all of them had to grab onto something to steady themselves from the constant shaking.

Suddenly, the tremors grew stronger as they heard something like a giant running at them from behind.

A Draconic Lion’s head appeared behind them, but before any of the teenagers could even react, all of them were being sucked up into its wide and gaping jaw.

Jekyll had no time to explain things, so he dumped all of them in the same space where Celine and Kasogonaga were being held. As soon as he arrived at the surface, he immediately unfurled his wings and soared towards the skies.

A few seconds later, a loud shout came from the cave entrance as a giant lightning bolt flew after Jekyll.

“You’re not getting away, Jekyll!” Eneru roared in anger.

Jekyll knew that he couldn’t outfly his pursuer because the Qilin was among the fastest beasts in the world.

“Scram!” Jekyll roared as he slashed at the incoming lightning bolt with his claws. A powerful collision ensued in the heavens as both beasts were pushed several meters away from each other.

Suddenly, a giant boulder the size of a hill was hurled in Jekyll’s direction. The timing of the attack was so precise that Jekyll was unable to evade it in time. Blood seeped out of the corner of Jekyll’s lips as the hill-sized boulder collided with the side of his face.

‘Dirty bastard!’ Jekyll cursed internally as he allowed his body to fly away using the rock’s momentum.

The sky suddenly turned dark as Eneru summoned a massive lightning storm. Jekyll was bombarded by giant lightning bolts left and right as he flew towards the West.

Like all Demonic Creatures, lightning was Jekyll’s weakness. However, he was strong enough to endure them because of his superior rank. Still, being constantly bombarded by massive lightning bolts was doing a number on him. That and Drauum, who was an Ancient Earth Golem, followed him on the ground like a carriage that had been given wind sails.

Jekyll knew that the moment he landed on the ground, the Ancient Earth Golem would make his life extremely difficult, so he gritted his teeth and endured the beating as he flew West.

The Qilin had no intention of letting Jekyll escape, so he repeatedly harassed him with long range attacks. He knew that he was a level weaker than the Taotie so he just focused on hurling lightning bolts at him as he made his escape.

“Die!” Eneru shouted as the single horn on his head glowed brightly, like a small sun. He then fired a lightning bolt that was big enough to swallow the retreating Taotie.

Jekyll’s scales glowed faintly as he increased his resistance against magical attacks. He knew that he needed to endure this attack no matter what, so he braced himself for the impact.

A loud clap of thunder reverberated as a bright flash illuminated the heavens. It was so bright that Princess Eowyn, who had arrived at the Zelan Palace not long ago, saw it in the distance.

The Qilin’s eyes glowed in power as he looked in the direction of the Taotie whom he had forced into a corner.

Drauum crossed its arm over its chest as it looked up into the sky. Its ancient eyes waited patiently for the light to recede to see the outcome of its’ comrade’s full powered strike.

Lightning snaked in the sky and thunder roared in the heavens. Soon, Jekyll’s figure once again reappeared in their sights. However, he was no longer alone.

*Burp*

William wasn’t able to stop himself from burping after getting hit by the overwhelming lightning attack that was unleashed by a Myriad Beast.

“Thank you for the experience points,” William said as he stood on top of a cloud. He then looked at the Qilin with a devilish smile as tendrils of lightning snaked across his body. “Can you do that one more time? It’s quite addicting!”

Eneru suddenly felt an overbearing presence that made his body unconsciously shudder. He looked at the red-headed boy in disbelief because he could feel his power was being suppressed by an ancient force that had existed alongside his race’s creation.

It took the Qilin half a minute to realize the reason why his power was being suppressed.

“You! Are you his protege?!” Eneru asked in disbelief.

William activated his appraisal skill and looked at the beast in front of him.

“I see, so you are a rebel,” William narrowed his eyes as he looked at the Draconic Unicorn in front of him.

It was at that moment when a giant boulder flew towards William’s direction. The Half-Elf, casually waved Ruyi Jingu Bang and smashed the boulder to pieces.

“And you are?” William glanced at the Earth Golem on the ground and once again used his appraisal skill.

“Oh? A Pseudo-Demigod?” William rubbed his chin with interest. “Might as well give it a try.”

William thrust the golden metallic rod in his hand towards the ground.

“Break all the walls that stand before me!”

“Ruyi Jingu Bang!”

The golden staff extended and increased its size. Its width was over fifty meters as it descended towards the ground, with the intention of crushing the golem into pieces.

“Ignorant child,” Drauum said softly as it stomped its foot on the ground.

A stone pillar that had the same size as William’s golden staff jutted out of the ground and met it head-on.

The two attacks collided and William was surprised because the Earth Pillar managed to block his weapon effectively and cancel the force behind it.

“It’s no use, Will,” Jekyll said as he flew near the boy. “As long as Drauum stands on the ground, it can borrow the power of the land to defend against any attacks. Only the attack of a Demigod would be able to break through its defenses.

William nodded. The purpose of his attack was to gauge how strong the Golem was. Also, his Heroic Avatar was nearing its limit, so he couldn’t possibly engage it in battle.

William channeled the remaining power of the Monkey King in his staff as he prepared a powerful attack.

“Quick Shot War Art Fourth Form.”

“Grand Bazooka!”

The tip of the golden staff, that was currently being suppressed by the Earth Pillar, emitted a burst of light.

Drauum’s eyes widened as it immediately merged with the land and buried itself deep in the ground.

Not long after, a powerful explosion took place, making the surroundings tremble.

The Earth Pillar collapsed entirely as the power of William’s attack made its way to the ground, creating a giant mushroom of light.

Eneru was forced to retreat due to the blazing flames that scorched the land, and reached into the sky at the same time.

He looked in disbelief at the two-mile-wide circular devastation from the sky. When he regained his senses and glanced in the direction of the boy and the Taotie, both of them were gone.

William made the attack flashy in order to fool the two powerful beings as he and Jekyll made their escape back to the boundaries of the Hellan Kingdom.
