Chapter 364: I Was Born Ready

After ending their meeting, William headed towards Princess Sidonie’s quarters to talk about how they should handle their current enemies.

“I know I already asked back at the Antheilm, but are you sure you don’t want to see the representatives of the Kraetor Empire?” William inquired.

“Have you already grown tired of me, Sir William?” Princess Sidonie asked in a teasing tone. “Do you love your Knight so much that you want to get rid of the third wheel?”

William shook his head. “Frankly, I need your help. But I don’t know if I can entrust my back to you. Princess, be honest with me. What do you really wish to accomplish?”

Princess Sidonie raised her hands to remove the veil covering her face.

“What do I want to accomplish?” Princess Sidonie asked back. Her mesmerizing hazel eyes stared straight into William’s own as she made her true feelings known. “I thought I knew what I wanted to accomplish. However, reality is very different from my expectations.”

Sidonie’s eyes glowed, not because she was using her charm, but because of her overflowing feelings that were rising up to the surface. The Seven Sins had their own specialty and she was born to be the embodiment of Lust.

She was happy and sad that her powers didn’t work on William. Princess Sidonie finally found what she wanted, but she was not what he wanted. This made her feel hurt, because she was used to being the apple of everyone’s eye.

Even the Crown Prince of the Hellan Kingdom, Lionel, would do anything to have her good graces.

“Sir William, I want to know what Love is,” Princess Sidonie said softly. “I want to know what it means to fall in love with someone, and be loved in return. Can you give me what I want? In return, I will give you my everything.”

William looked back at the Princess with a serious expression before shaking his head. “I’m sorry. I cannot give you what you want.”

Princess Sidonie lowered her head and clenched her fist. She was not disappointed, because she had already expected this answer. In fact, it would be her who would be disappointed if William had nodded his head and agreed to her request.

[ As expected of Darling. ]

‘Yes. we didn’t choose the wrong person.’

[ However, you also understand what we need to do, right? He will never look at us the way he looked at Wendy. ]

‘I know,’ Princess Sidonie replied. ‘Since I can’t be his favorite then I just have to be his…’

William and Princess Sidonie talked, but the two couldn’t come to an agreement. Knowing that nothing more would happen in their discussion, William respectfully asked to end their talk.

Princess Sidonie was in agreement and even bid William goodnight.

As soon as the door of his room closed, a single tear slid down the side of Princess Sidonie’s face. She felt regret that things had to end this way, but she and Morgana had already resolved themselves with their decision.

-

“Are you sure, Princess?” Priscilla asked as she opened the door of the flying carriage.

“Yes,” Princess Sidonie replied. “We’re going back to Freesia. It’s time to return home.”

The Blade Wyvern opened its wings and flapped them a few times in order to warm them up. When it felt that everything was ready, it soared up into the air, pulling the flying carriage behind it.

It didn’t utter a screech because the Princess wanted to leave silently. Due to the dark clouds in the sky, blocking the light of the moon and the stars, it was quite easy to leave undetected.

Princess Sidonie glanced at the ground one last time before closing the curtains of her flying carriage.

‘Goodbye, Sir William.’

[ If we can’t make you pay attention to us as your ally… ]

‘Then we will become your enemy.’

[ Let’s see if you still ignore us when our Army comes knocking on your door! I will look forward to the expression you’re going to make then, Darling! ]

Princess Sidonie smiled at the thought of the man she liked thinking about her all day as she devastated his precious Hellan Kingdom. Since she couldn’t use the soft approach to make him submit, she would use force in order to get him to kneel.

She was one of the Seven Deadly Sins afterall and it was perfectly fine for her to commit a sin. Princess Sidonie had long embraced her true self and she would not shy away from using her God-Given talents to have her way.

Hundreds of portals appeared beside the flying carriage as countless numbers of Winged Ants appeared and flew in a formation with it at its center.

Princess Sidonie knew that the next time she would meet her beloved Half-Elf was when they faced off as enemies. For some reason, the mere thought of it thrilled her, making her heart beat wildly inside her chest.

Morgana laughed loudly within their Mindscape because she and Princess Sidonie were connected. She clearly felt that one of the seals, that bound their powers, had been broken the moment Princess Sidonie fully embraced the source of her Sin and Power.

[ I wonder, will Darling be disappointed when he finds out what we are planning? ]

The corner of Princess Sidonie’s seductive lips curled up into a smirk as her eyes glowed with power. She didn’t bother to answer her other half’s question, because she didn’t care whether William would be disappointed or not.

The only thing she cared about was the moment when she sank her fangs into William’s tender heart.

-

William watched as Princess Sidonie’s entourage disappeared in the distance. Ashe, who was currently merged with him, appeared behind his back like an apparition.

‘Although I don’t like it, I would have endured if you made her your lover in order to gain control of the Ant Army under her command,’ Ashe said with regret. ‘Right now, we are lacking in manpower. I’m sure that Wendy, and Young Master Est, would understand.”

William sighed as he turned his head to look at his mermaid lover. “I don’t want to do things half-heartedly, especially when it comes to relationships. This would be unfair to her, and to all of you as well.”

Ashe caressed the side of William’s head as she nodded her head in understanding. “Let’s face that Pseudo-Demigod together. I will not let you go alone.”

“Okay,” William replied as he focused his attention towards his Thousand Beast Domain.

Soon, he disappeared from where he stood and reappeared in the valley where the monument stood.

Although he felt sorry for Princess Sidonie’s departure, now was not the time to worry about her.

“Ready?” William inquired.

“I was born ready,” Ian replied.

“That’s not what you said last night,” William countered. “Last night, you said you were born to be with me. Were you lying to me back then?”

Instead of answering him, Ashe pinched his ears out of embarrassment. “Stop talking nonsense. Let’s go!”

William stopped his teasing as he took deep breaths in order to calm himself. When he was ready he took the sheathed dagger out from his storage ring and placed his hand over the monument.

A bright flash of light appeared that would send William and Ashe into the domain where a strong adversary was waiting for them.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
