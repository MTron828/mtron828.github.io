Chapter 132: Is Goat Milk Really That Good?

The two combatants came to a standstill as they panted for breath. Both sides weren’t willing to use their trump cards this early in the game. Although they had used their most standard abilities to the fullest, it wasn’t enough to declare a winner between the two of them.

“Enough,” Drake said as he sheathed his blade. “We will settle this inside the Enchanted Forest. At that time, you will not be as lucky as you are now.”

“My words exactly,” Spencer replied. “I can’t wait to see the look on your face when you bow your head in front of me.”

The two boys snorted at the same time and left the arena. Seeing that the fight was over, the peanut gallery had also started to disperse.

William was reluctant to part with Ella and the latter felt the same way. When Kenneth saw this tear-jerking scene, he decided to clear his throat and offer a solution.

“You know, as long as both parties sharing the dormitory room agree then bringing Ella to our room is not a problem,” Kenneth stated.

“Really?” William immediately grabbed Kenneth’s hand which made the delicate boy flinch. “Oh! Sorry, I forgot that my rough hands can hurt you. However, can I believe your words when you said that Mama Ella can stay in our dormitory room?”

“She can, but you have to take proper care of her,” Kenneth replied after regaining his composure. William’s action was so quick that he was caught by surprise. “Also, make sure to tell her not to go over to my side of the room. I don’t want Ella to start munching on my precious herbs.”

“Don’t worry, Mama Ella wouldn’t do that.” William patted his chest in assurance. “Isn’t that right, Mama?”

“Meeeeeeh!” Ella bleated in acknowledgement.

Kenneth couldn’t help but smile as he watched this exchange between the mother and son pair. When Ella entered the dormitory building, the guard guarding the gate gave her a weird look, but he didn’t stop her from entering the Solaris Dormitory.

Ella walked along the hallway, climbed the stairs, and followed William’s back like a tail. The students living in the dormitory looked at this scene with amusement. Since Ella was not in her War Ibex Form, her height was only a meter tall, and her body length was only over a meter.

Also, her coat was so white and fluffy that the girls who saw her were tempted to give her a hug. Of course, they didn’t dare do that and only stared at Ella as if she were a walking plush toy.

When Ella was safely inside William’s room, she obediently went to the side that contained William’s bed and stood beside it.

William took out a small wooden bowl from his storage ring and crouched beside Ella. He then started to milk her.

“I haven’t had a drink of your milk today, Mama, and it is making me feel uncomfortable,” William said as he filled the wooden bowl in his hand.

“Meeeeh.” Ella bleated softly as if reprimanding William for not drinking his milk on time.

“You really are a shepherd.” Kenneth looked at the two with interest. ‘I haven’t drank goat milk before. I wonder what it tastes like?’

After filling up his bowl, William thanked his Mama before drinking it slowly.

“Mama, your milk is really the best,” William praised as he finished his bowl of milk.

“Meeeeh.” Ella bleated as if saying “isn’t this a fact?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The familiar notification sounded and a row of words appeared on William’s screen.

-

[ Daily Quest: Drink Milk has been completed! ]

[ Rewards: 6 Exp Points. ]

[ Additional Reward: 2 God Points ]

-

“Um?” William rubbed his eyes and double checked the notification. ‘It’s really there!’

William didn’t know what kind of sorcery was happening to the notifications, but he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t secretly happy for the additional reward from drinking his Mama’s milk.

Somewhere in the Temple of Ten Thousand Gods…

“Are you sure about this?” Gavin asked. “Isn’t this too much of a freebie?”

“It’s fine,” David replied. “Even if he drinks milk for a year, at most he would only get 730 God Points. This isn’t a big deal, especially with you, Issei, and Lily giving him Special Quests from time to time.”

“So you say, but you were the one that gave the two hidden quests last time.” Gavin pointed out.

“Well, since it was proposed by Ella and William decided to listen to her, I decided to add those two quests on a whim,” David admitted. “I don’t regret it though. William performed spectacularly in that fight. His four years of training hasn’t come to naught.”

Gavin nodded his head as he gazed upon his follower, who was being displayed in a large crystal ball. He wanted William to be safe and happy, but the world he chose was different from the one Gavin had envisioned for him.

God Points: 2

William opened the God Shop and confirmed that he had indeed received God Points from drinking his Mama Ella’s milk. His brain started to calculate the amount of points he could get over the span of a year and it made him realize that it wasn’t that much.

It was not even enough to buy an Elemental Arrow with the necessary add-ons.

“Even so, I’m still thankful,” William muttered.

Kenneth heard William’s mutter and thought that he was thankful for drinking Ella’s milk.

‘Is goat milk really that good?’ Kenneth’s curiosity had been piqued. However, he was too embarrassed to ask William if it was possible for him to have a taste of Ella’s milk.

Three days passed swiftly and there was only a day before the battle for the position of Head Prefect of the Freshmen in the Martial Class.

Excitement and determination could be seen on some of the faces of the students who intended to try their luck and win this prestigious position. As for people like Kenneth, who weren’t interested in joining the event, they were just waiting patiently for the results.

After thinking things through, William decided to join the competition as well. His reason for joining was quite simple.

“If I become the Head Prefect then no one will say anything about Mama Ella staying inside the Solaris Dormitory!”

That was what William thought. Although he wasn’t too sure if he could win, he would still do his best in order to gain the rights to have Ella stay by his side in the Royal Academy. He didn’t want her to spend her days in the stables, while he went to his Martial Classes.
