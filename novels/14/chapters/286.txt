Chapter 286: On The Verge Of Collapse

While the massacre was rampaging in the Grand Coliseum, a few individuals had appeared inside the academy grounds and scattered in different directions. No one saw them come, and no one would see them leave.

“Princess, rest assured, none of these foul beasts will touch a single strand of your hair.” The Knight Captain of the Aerial Cavaliers stood in front of Princess Sidonie with his sword drawn.

The rest of the Knights also didn’t move from their position and created an impenetrable defense to protect the young lady seated behind them.

“I’m not worried,” Princess Sidonie replied. “As long as the Knights of Freesia stand before me, I will not be afraid of anything.”

The magic Knights among the Aerial Cavaliers fired their long range spells in order to attack the gargoyles that flew near their location. Even though they wanted to help, their Princess’ safety was their top priority.

Also, their flying mounts were not with them at the moment, so they couldn’t engage the flying monsters in the sky. Since that was the case, they focused on the one thing that they could do and that was to protect Princess Sidonie at all cost.

When the attack started, Prince Lionel was seated beside Princess Sidonie. However, after seeing the traitorous magicians attract their classmates, the Knight Captain of Princess Sidonie’s Royal Guard, politely asked the Crown Prince to return to King Noah’s side.

In fear that Prince Lionel would suddenly turn coat and attack the Princess, they used a diplomatic approach to make the Prince evacuate.

Seeing that the Knight Captain was firm in his decision, Prince Lionel decided to take a step back and agree to their request. However, deep inside, he was feeling irritated because an opportunity to “save” Princess Sidonie was lost due to the Knight Captain’s interference.

[ I wonder what he would think, if you told him that you’d rather let a gargoyle snatch you away than chat with him for a minute longer? ]

‘Although I agree with your words, I can’t possibly say that to a Crown Prince of a Kingdom. Big Sister, what are your thoughts about this incident?’

[ Something is very fishy about this incident. Sidonie, swap with me for now. I want to be ready just in case of an emergency. ]

‘Okay.’

Inside the Underground Cavern…

William lay on a small altar, near the lake. A black liquid dripped from the side of his lips, as Carter poured the contents of an eighth vial in the Half-Elf’s mouth.

This vial was specially made to weaken a person’s soul, forcing it into a lethargic state. Usually, Carter only used two of them whenever he changed vessels, but William was special. The Professor wouldn’t underestimate someone that had God Essence in them, so he prepared a dozen “Soul Suppressing Serum” to make William’s soul unable to even lift a finger to stop him.

After emptying the twelfth vial, Carter ran a diagnostic spell into William’s body. Soon, a triumphant smile appeared on his lips as he prepared to leave the vessel he had been using for the past few months.

Carter opened his mouth, and a two-foot long purple worm emerged from it. It had three eyes on its head, and the blood-red pupils gazed at William as if he was the most delicious meal that it had seen in its life.

After successfully disengaging itself from Carter’s body, the “Professor” fell on the ground. Although the body was still alive, it was now an empty husk, bereft of any spirit. The Astral Worm had devoured the soul of the original “Carter” months ago and had stayed in his body up to this day.

The Worm thought that it would be using the Professor’s body for many years to come, but William’s sudden appearance made it change its plans completely.

It then flew towards William’s mouth, and forced itself inside it. The Half-Elf was in an unconscious state and was unable to offer any kind of resistance. Soon, the Worm arrived in William’s Sea of Consciousness and immediately felt the Divinity that it had longed for in its dreams.

‘Yes! Yes! Yes! Finally!’ the Worm happily screeched as it flew toward the center of William’s Sea of Consciousness.

There, he saw a boy, kneeling on the ground, and gasping for breath. The worm didn’t waste a single moment and immediately attacked the boy. It planned to devour William’s soul and take over his body completely.

William’s eyes stared at the seven-meter-long Astral Worm that was rushing towards him, and activated his appraisal skill.

William tried to stand, but his legs refused to move.

[ Host, your soul has been weakened by 80%. Currently, you don’t have the capability to fight this Spirit Beast. Even in your peak power, you are still not a match for it. ]

‘I know.’ William replied. Even communicating with the System was hard because his spirit energy had decreased drastically. He gathered all the magic power that he could currently muster in his current state.

At most, he could use it to initiate one full powered attack, and hope that it would work.

‘We will proceed with the last resort.’

[ Host, that is suicide. ]

‘I’d rather commit suicide, than be devoured by this bastard. Activate it, now!’

The System knew that William was right. Now was the moment of life and death. Both of them had no other choice, but to confront the Centennial Beast with everything they got.

William clenched his fist as he summoned Stormcaller in front of him. The spear of the Ainsworth Family shone with defiance as lightning snaked around its body.

“Lightning God War Art, Thirteen Form…”

[ Merging… Failed. ]

[ Merging… Failed. ]

[ Merging… Failed. ]

[ Merging… Failed. ]

“Go for the kill…,” William said through gritted teeth. “Gaebolg!”

William also channeled all the magic power he currently had and boosted Stormcaller’s power as much as he could.

The lightning spear charged towards the approaching Astral Worm like a railgun. It roared and thunder followed in its wake. It was a weapon that had gained sentience long ago, and was only waiting for someone that had the affinity of lightning to wield its powers.

After William unlocked the Disciple of Thunder, the Ainsworth Family Heirloom once again appeared on the battlefield, like it did, thousands of years ago. It had realized William’s current situation, and the threat that was fast approaching its current Master.

Empowered by William’s Lightning God War Art, and his magic, it flew towards the Astral Worm like a raging lightning bolt.

It was the only thing that stood between the Devourer of Souls, and a helpless Shepherd, that was on the verge of collapse.
