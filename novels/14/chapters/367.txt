Chapter 367: William’s King’s Legion [Part 3]

After seeing that the battle on the ground was going smoothly, William then shifted his attention to the great battle that was currently happening in the sky.

Dave and Conrad were currently waging war against the Deathknight and its powerful mount, the Bone Dragon.

William’s two knights had Chocolate Lollipops inside their mouth which prevented them from getting intimidated by the fearsome aura of the Death Knight and the Bone Dragon. At first, the Bone Dragon activated its special skill, Dragon Fear.

However, due to the Chocolate Lollipop’s ability to grant Immunity to Fear and increase Resistance against Mind Affecting Spells, the two boys were able to battle without being affected by the Bone Dragon’s powerful aura.

Dave, the Crusader of the Sky, and Conrad, The Dragon Knight of War, worked hand in hand to prevent the most powerful threat on the battlefield from aiding the Skeletal Army on the ground.

Each time the Bone Dragon would try to dive towards the ground, one of the two boys would activate the skill Duel-Ex to force it to clash with them, which frustrated the Death Knight.

“Careful, it’s going to use Dragon’s Breath!” Conrad warned Dave, who was currently in the Bone Dragon’s line of sight.

Black flames erupted from the Bone Dragon’s Jaw and flew straight towards the annoying Gryphon and its rider.

Dave summoned a spear into his hand and took aim. This was the same spear that William had used to “tame” Lionheart back at the Southern Forest.

Although the spear had been tainted due to William’s unique way of taming, it was still a good weapon and Dave had no other option but to wield it.

“Light that shines upon the world, bathe us all in your Eternal Glory!” Dave roared as the spear in his hands shone with a radiant light. “Grand Cross!”

The chubby boy threw the spear directly in the path of the Dragon’s Breath. Soon, the two forces collided. One Light, the other Dark. Both countering the other.

The collision lasted for a few seconds before both attacks cancelled each other out.

Lionheart charged forward as Dave reclaimed the spear mid-air.

Conrad wasn’t being idle either, right after the Bone Dragon used its Breath Attack, he had activated one of the special abilities that he had gained after he had obtained his Job Class from William’s Knighting Ceremony.

“Flames that were birthed in the Heavens, make your mark now! Conrad shouted. “Dragon Meteor!”

A five-meter wide flaming fireball descended from the sky and slammed directly into the back of the Bone Dragon, hitting the Death Knight in the process.

The Bone Dragon roared in anger, but it managed to keep itself airborne despite the fact that some of its body parts had been destroyed.

Dave and Conrad exchanged a glance with each other. Both boys nodded their heads simultaneously as they prepared to finish off their opponent once and for all.

“Tornado Descent!” Dave ordered.

Lionheart started to spin, mid-air, as it obeyed its Rider’s command. Soon, a green tornado enveloped the Gryphon as it flew towards the Bone Dragon.

“Dragon Descent!” Conrad ordered his Wyvern to initiate one of its special moves that coincided with Dave’s Tornado Descent.

Instead of spinning, the Wyvern folded its wings and descended from the sky like a missile. Its body was enveloped with purple flames as the mighty roar of a dragon echoed across the heavens.

The Death Knight cast a magic barrier to protect itself and its mount from the collision. However, the barrier broke seconds after the two powerful attacks collided with it.

A powerful explosion erupted, sending shockwaves in all directions.

William’s robe fluttered as he looked at the sky with a serious expression. Ashe was doing the same as well, because this was the first time she had seen Dave and Conrad fight together.

It was an eye-opening experience because the mermaid didn’t know that the two boys were very capable fighters.

Although the majority of the students in the Magic and Spirit Divisions looked down on the Martial Division, Est, Ian, Isaac, and Wendy were some of the few students who recognized their potential.

Seeing the two boys face off against a powerful opponent made Ashe realize that she still had greatly underestimated the knights under William’s command.

“They are the only knights I have in my current King’s Legion,” William said softly as if reading Ashe’s thoughts. “In the future, I plan to add more. I look forward to the day when all my knights can sweep over the battlefield and turn the tides in my favor.”

Ashe pondered for a brief moment before nodding her head. “I want to see it, too. However, I also hope that the day arrives when you don’t have to fight anymore. I don’t want you to get hurt.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

William felt something warm spread in his chest as his mermaid lover wrapped her arms around him. The union between their souls held a very intimate feeling. It was as if both of them really were sharing a single body with their hearts beating as one.

“I can’t promise you that I won’t get hurt,” William said as he continued to look at the sky. “However, I will do my best to come back in one piece. I don’t want you to cry a river when something happens to me.”

“You’re too full of yourself.”

“Thank you.”

“I’m not praising you,” Ian nagged, but she still kept her arms wrapped around her handsome lover. She was already used to William’s teasing and knew that it was already part of his character, one she had unknowingly fallen in love with.

“It’s over,” William said as Dragon bones fell from the sky.

The two Knights circled in the air once before joining their comrades, who were still fighting on the ground.

William knew that this was only the beginning of his battle against the Pseudo-Demigod that was imprisoned within the fortress of Avalon.

A mere appetizer for the true battle that was about to come.
