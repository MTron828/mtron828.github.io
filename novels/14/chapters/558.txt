Chapter 558: You Also Carry A Sin

“Big Brother, is that the Tower of Babylon?” Chiffon asked as she pointed in the distance.

They had just exited an underground tunnel, and the first thing that they saw was a Giant Tower that extended towards the sky.

“Yes,” William replied. “If that is not the Tower of Babylon, I don’t know what it is.”

The Qilin gave his silent agreement as he flew towards the tower. Their month-long journey was about to come to an end. Along the way, they visited several cities, and stayed for a day or two to rest.

During their journey, Chiffon became more lively, suitable for a girl of her age. Without being constantly monitored and restricted by other people, the pink-haired girl’s latent curiosity burst forth.

William liked this change in Chiffon’s personality. Although she still couldn’t smile, the subtle rise at the corner of her lips were becoming more and more evident as time went by. The Half-Elf hoped that there would come a day where Chiffon would show him a smile that came from the bottom of her heart.

A smile that will definitely melt the heart of anyone who would see it.

“It’s massive,” Chiffon looked in wonder at the giant tower that was getting bigger and bigger. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”

William nodded in agreement. The tower was indeed very impressive, and in a way, intimidating. It was like a Giant that was looking down on the entire world and daring everyone to climb to its highest floor.

After an hour, the Dark Qilin slowly descended from the sky.

At the base of the tower, a massive city was built. This was where people of all ages and various ethnicities gathered to challenge the floors of the tower.

There were a total of fifty conquered floors inside the Tower of Babylon. Those who managed to conquer these floors became the ruling families who governed it. One can even say that they were the Kings of their own domain, and not even the Emperors of the different Empires held control over them.

Because of the riches and other rewards that the Tower offered, many would challenge it from time to time, in order to break past the 51st Floor which was deemed to be impossible to conquer.

In the end, most people gave up and settled to work for the families who had already managed to conquer a floor of their own.

The city at the base of the tower became the hub of these ruling families. This was where they sold, or auctioned off the products exclusive to their respective floors, and they profited immensely from it.

The city was ruled by a council, which was composed of fifty members. Each of these members hailed from the family of each floor and worked together to create the city that was known as the City of Babylon.

William landed a mile away from the city because the Black Qilin was too catchy. He made Chiffon wear a black hooded robe, and a mask to cover her adorable face.

Gilbert had been to the city before and he said that it was a place where slave trading was encouraged. William was a Half-Elf and Chiffon was Half Dwarf-Half Demon. Both of them were good looking, so their chances of getting captured were very high.

William wasn’t afraid of slave collars, because enslavement magic didn’t work on him anymore. This was one of the benefits of wearing the Collar of Wisteria in the past. Celine confided that one of the reasons why she made William the collar was to prevent others from enslaving him.

Since Celine and Celeste had also worn the collar when they were younger, they had also gained the immunity from enslavement magic. This was the preparation made by their Grandfather to prevent the two girls from being enslaved and used for notorious deeds.

The only concern he had was Chiffon’s safety. He didn’t know if one of the Seven Deadly Sins could be enslaved. He just hoped that nobody would be stupid enough to make their moves on her. Otherwise, William would erase them from the face of the Earth.

William and Chiffon had just reached the gate when the Half-Elf suddenly stopped walking.

The reason?

There was a familiar face looking at him with a smile.

“Master?” William asked as he watched the beautiful elf walk towards him in a daze.

Out of everyone he knew, he didn’t expect to see Celine in the City of Babylon. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It is me,” Celine replied before ruffling William’s hair. “You’ve grown a little taller since we last met.”

Chiffon looked at the lady in front of her. She could tell that she was quite close to William because her Big Brother seemed happy to see her.

“Master, why are you here?”

“Because a bird told me that you would be here.”

“Huh?” William blinked as he looked at his shadow. “Second Master?”

Celine covered her lips and chuckled. She was just teasing William and the latter didn’t betray her expectations.

“Oliver is not here,” Celine commented. “He is watching over my room in the inn for me. I know that you have a lot of questions, but this is not a place for them. Come, I’m sure you’re also tired of your journey.”

Celine didn’t wait for William’s reply before walking away. The Half-Elf glanced at Chiffon and the latter nodded her head.

William followed Celine while he firmly held Chiffon’s hand. The streets of the City of Babylon were quite crowded, and he was worried that he would be separated from her if he didn’t hold her hand.

Soon they arrived at an elegant looking inn that was away from the main streets of the city. Celine led them to her room without a word.

“It has been a while, Little Will,” Oliver greeted William as soon as the latter entered Celine’s room.

“Second Master, I hope you’re doing well,” William replied.

“I’ve been well.” Oliver nodded his head. “I just didn’t expect that you would be visiting this place, so Mistress and I took a detour.”

Celine started to brew some tea, while William chatted with Oliver. Chiffon had already taken off her hood, and mask and listened to their conversation with interest. This was the first time that she had seen a strange creature like Oliver that was Half Parrot, Half Monkey.

After filling their cups with tea, Celine sat on the table and stared at William.

“It looks like your hobby of picking up girls in the Dungeon still hasn’t changed,” Celine said.

William lightly cleared his throat, “Master. You’re talking about a different protagonist. I don’t pick up girls in the Dungeon.”

“Well, why don’t you introduce me to your new companion?” Celine asked. The beautiful Elf had already sensed Chiffon’s uniqueness. Even though she didn’t have Oliver’s eyes, she still had a spell that could identify a person’s origins.

Unlike the Elves of the Silvermoon Continent, Celine held no bias towards other races. She was even mildly surprised when she found out that Chiffon had demonic blood running in her veins.

“Master, this is Chiffon Val Gremory,” William said. “Chiffon, this is my Master, who taught me how to use Dar-Darts Magic. Her name is Celine Dy Wisteria.”

Chiffon stared hard at Celine, and the latter stared right back at her. The beautiful elf ignored the part where William was about to tell the little girl that she taught him how to wield Dark Magic.

After what seemed to be an eternity, the little girl opened her adorable lips and made a statement.

“You are just like me,” Chiffon said softly. “You also carry a Sin.”
