Chapter 531: Wrapped In Tender Feelings

The sound of kissing reverberated inside the bathtub.

William felt the urgency in Princess Sidonie’s kisses, and knew that she was at her limit. He then embraced her smooth and seductive body as the power of lust overflowed from within her, sending shivers down her spine.

“Will, please…,” Princess Sidonie pleaded as she pressed her naked body over him.

Although the bathtub was filled with cold water, the heat inside her body continued to burn unabated.

“I understand,” William replied as he kissed her forehead.

The Half-Elf then started caressing the Princess’ body in order to release the pent up lust that it had accumulated since he left to conquer the Mirage Cavern in Silverwind City.

The beautiful lady surrendered her body to her beloved, and allowed him to do whatever he wanted. Just like an itch behind her back that she couldn’t scratch, Princess Sidonie had felt her frustration build while William wasn’t around.

Seeing her current state made the Half-Elf’s heart ache, so he used his expertise to kiss, suck, lick, and bite the itch that the Princess wasn’t able to reach. It didn’t take long before Princess Sidonie’s body shuddered, as her beloved brought her to the peak.

However, once was not enough. It was not so easy to sate the Power of Lust, and both of them knew it.

“Darling, let’s take this to the bedroom,” Morgana whispered in William’s ear. “It’s my turn now.”

“Okay,” William replied and kissed her.

They were currently inside the Villa located in the Dungeon of Atlantis. A day in the outside world was equivalent to three days inside the Dungeon. William thought it would be best to absorb all the overflowing divinity from his lover’s body, in order to stabilize her condition completely.

After drying themselves with magic, William sat on the bed, while Morgana kneeled on the floor in front of him. Princess Sidonie’s other half, lowered her head and lovingly kissed William’s…

If other people were to see her now, they would be surprised because the beautiful lady that all the men and women adored in the academy, was currently servicing a Half-Elf with her seductive lips.

Although both girls were still inexperienced, that didn’t stop them from doing their best to make William feel good.

It didn’t take long before the red-headed teenager uttered a soft grunt, before releasing his essence inside her mouth.

Morgana ceased all actions and focused on taking in William’s precious seed. She didn’t intend to waste even a single drop of it because it belonged to the man that she, and Princess Sidonie loved.

Two minutes later, the two lovers were on top of the bed and seeking each other’s warmth. The power of lust was continuously being absorbed by the gem on William’s chest, easing the discomfort that the Princess was feeling as the time went by.

Although they still didn’t cross the last line, that didn’t prevent them from having their fill of each other’s love, through words, and actions.

A few hours later, Princess Sidonie slept peacefully in William’s embrace. Her smooth, and near-perfect body, that would drive both men and women crazy, laid on top of the man she loved, and the latter held her firmly, unwilling to let go.

William looked at his lover’s sleeping face. He realized that parting with her for a long period of time would put her and the people around her in grave danger, if her power suddenly flared out in the wrong place, and the wrong time.

‘System, can you make it so that Sidonie can go to the Thousand Beast Domain even if we are far apart?’

[ It is possible. ]

‘I want you to make it happen.’

[ Certainly. However, for that, the host will need to pay 50,000 God Points. We will need to tweak the Collar of Wisteria and add a waypoint that will allow it to connect to the Thousand Beast Domain, regardless of how far the two of you are apart. ]

William nodded. ‘Do it.’

[ Understood. ]

[ Deducting 50,000 God Points in order to embed a mini teleportation gate inside the Collar of Wisteria. ]

Remaining Points: 4,450,642

The collar on Princess Sidonie’s neck glowed, but its wearer was currently not aware of what was happening.

Half a minute later, the glow disappeared and everything returned to normal.

William breathed a sigh of relief because with this added feature, his lover would be able to teleport inside his Thousand Beast Domain to seek his help if her Divinity suddenly started to go out of control.

The Half-Elf kissed the sleeping Princess’ forehead once before closing his eyes to sleep. He was also exhausted because Princess Sidonie’s, and Morgana’s, stamina almost rivaled his own.

Clearly, the two girls were born for love making, and William looked forward to the day when he would finally become one with her.

Back in Princess Sidonie’s Room inside the Girl’s Dormitory… Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Chiffon hummed as she scrubbed her body with soap. She had not taken a proper bath since she had explored the dungeon with William, and it made her feel uncomfortable.

After properly washing her body, she donned a new set of clothes that Princess Sidonie had bought for her, and laid on top of the bed to sleep.

She hadn’t had a proper sleep as well, so she took this opportunity to catch up. Ian promised to pick her up so they could have dinner together. The little girl was surprised when the Princess of the Kraetor Empire suddenly disappeared from on top of the bed.

Chiffon had wanted to ask William what happened, but the latter only said that he would explain it at a later time. Back then, William had a worried look on his face, so she decided to not pry any further and watched him leave in haste.

Ian had also accompanied William to return to the dormitory. Both of them were boys, so they couldn’t possibly stay inside the girl’s dormitory for a long time.

‘I hope they will take me with them again when they go to the dungeon,’ Chiffon thought as she hugged Princess Sidonie’s pillow. ‘I didn’t know that exploring dungeons with other people was that much fun.’

She had always been alone most of the time, and stayed away from people. When William asked her if she wanted to accompany him to the dungeon, she readily said yes.

Back then, she only agreed because she didn’t want to be lonely. Chiffon didn’t expect that in those days battling inside the dungeon, she would feel things that she had never felt before.

It was not her first time fighting monsters. In the Demon Continent, fighting was a way of life. However, this time, she hadn’t fought alone. There were people who treated her as their equal, and William even held her hand most of the time.

The little girl placed her hand over her chest as she pondered on what the source of this warmth that she was feeling inside her chest was.

She wished, with all of her heart, that there would be more opportunities where she would experience this feeling again.

“I don’t want to be alone again,” Chiffon said softly as the tender feelings wrapped itself over her cold body.

She had been alone for a very long time, and longed for the warmth of someone that would stay by her side… forever.
