Chapter 394: Return To The Kingdom Of Freesia

A swarm of flying ants entered the airspace of the capital of Freesia, but none of the defenders barred their way.

Prior to her arrival, Princess Sidonie had written a letter and asked Priscilla to take it to the Commander of the Kraetor Empire, Prince Jason, who was currently commanding the city.

After Prince Jason received the letter from his cousin, he personally went to meet her and tell her about the mission that was given to him by his grandfather, Emperor Leonidas.

There had been a subtle change in Princess Sidonie’s attitude and presence after she had left the Kyrintor Mountains. She no longer hid her face behind a veil and allowed her beauty to be seen by all. The power of her Charm had also increased twofold, which would turn average people into mindless slaves who would follow her every command.

Naturally, Princess Sidonie held this power back, only allowing a tiny bit of her power to be released into the surroundings. Even so, it was still more than enough to make those with weaker willpower infatuated with her beauty.

Prince Jason came prepared and was wearing many protective artifacts that decreased the power of Charm spells. Even so, when he first saw Sidonie, he wasn’t able to stop himself from drawing a deep breath because of her sensuous beauty.

Princess Sidonie didn’t care whether her cousin would be Charmed by her beauty or not. For her, those with weak willpower were just meant to be used as cannon fodder[delete s] in order to accomplish her goal, which was to make William see her as the greatest threat he was going to face.

“I’ve been warned by our spies that your beauty can bring down nations,” Prince Jason said as he stared at the sensuous beauty in front of him. “However, I didn’t expect that they still failed to accurately describe how beautiful you truly are, Cousin.”

Princess Sidonie’s lips curled up into a sweet smile. In the past, she didn’t like it when people flattered her because of her beauty, but after being firmly rejected by William, she lost a bit of her confidence.

Hearing people affirm that she was beautiful once again sparked the flames that burned inside her chest, fueling her seductive powers to grow by the day.

“I already read the plans in the letter, but is it true that Grandfather planned to make me the Empress of the Southern Continent?” Princess Sidonie inquired. “I find this hard to believe.”

Prince Jason pressed his closed fist over his chest as he stared straight into the Princess’ eyes.

“This is what the Emperor decreed,” Prince Jason stated with pride. “I swear upon my dignity and honor that there is no falsehood in his desire to make you the ruler of the Southern Continent!”

Before he set out on his journey, Prince Jason was still doubtful about why his Grandfather decided to ask his distant cousin to become the ruler of an entire continent. Prince Jason would be lying if he said that he didn’t have any complaints about his mission.

However, all of those complaints vanished the moment he laid his eyes upon the most attractive lady he had seen in his life.

As a Prince of the Kraetor Empire, Jason never lacked the company of beautiful women. He was also not a vegetarian. He had spent many nights with these beauties to quell his sexual desires.

This was why he became enamored with the Princess, who was also his cousin. In the Kraetor Empire, it was not forbidden for relatives to get married.

The Royal Family of the Empire had a bloodline trait which made their offspring immune to any disability or genetic defect that came from marrying their relatives. There were also times when such practices were favored because countless powerful members of the Royal Family had been born due to this method.

Although Princess Sidonie was unaware of the thoughts that were currently swirling inside Prince Jason’s mind, she was able to sense the desire that had bloomed inside the Prince’s heart.

Morgana giggled internally as she teased her other half about making Prince Jason their Mister.

(A/N: A Mister is the counterpart of a Mistress. I was tempted to use Paramour, but decided to just make it Mister to make things easier. Take note that this term is only viable to anyone linked to Princess Sidonie or Morgana. If you read the word Mister, in this story, it will not have the meaning of a “Male Mistress” unless the one saying it is Princess Sidonie or Morgana.)

“Thank you, Cousin, for your praise,” Princess Sidonie replied with a smile that was sweet enough to rot anyone’s teeth. “I’m tired from my journey. Can you please escort me back to the capital?”

Prince Jason unconsciously drew in a deep breath before taking hold of his senses. Princess Sidonie’s smile made his heart skip a beat and he had to use all of his willpower to stop himself from kneeling at her feet.

“It will be my pleasure, Cousin,” Prince Jason replied. “Please follow me.”

The Bronze Dragon that the Prince was riding led the way towards the capital. The Flying Ants returned to their formation with the flying carriage at the center. If Princess Sidonie’s father, King Redmond, saw her right now, his heart would definitely be filled with pride.

His daughter had managed to make a Myriad Beast her Beast Companion, which was something that not everyone could do. Only a handful of Emperors and Empresses that ruled the Central Continent had achieved such a feat, and none of them had been able to do it when they were only sixteen years old.

Princess Sidonie was warmly received by the Kraetor Army. The Princess’ little brother, Prince Carl, hugged his elder sister the moment she stepped out of the flying carriage.

Morgana had already placed a spell on her other half’s sibling to prevent Prince Carl from getting Charmed by anyone. Both of them were born from the same mother, and Princess Sidonie, as well as Morgana, loved him very much.

“Don’t leave me again, Sister,” Prince Carl said as he hugged his sister tightly.

Princess Sidonie could feel her clothes becoming wet from the tears of her little brother. She affectionately patted the crying child’s head as she assured him that she would stay in the capital for the time being.

Prince Jason watched this scene and wished that he could swap places with the young Prince. His desire to hold the Princess in his arms burned deep inside his chest.

The Princess of Freesia excused herself and dragged her little brother to her room. She didn’t want the members of the Kraetor Empire to witness Prince Carl’s sorry state, so she deemed[decided] it best to have a talk with him in private.

Priscilla followed behind the Princess since all of Sidonie’s other attendants had been left in Ravenlord Citadel when she escaped. Both of them could only hope that they didn’t suffer at the hands of the Crown Prince as he vented his anger due to the Princess’ escape.

Princess Sidonie’s goal was to rally the Kraetor Army and start her own conquest of the Southern Lands. Her first target was the Anaesha Dynasty where the Ant Queen resided. This was her first step in the master plan that she had prepared to ensnare the arrogant red-headed boy who had dared to reject her.

A Half-Elf that dared to reject the most beautiful lady in the Southern Continent. Princess Sidonie vowed that the next time she met William, she would make him understand that he had made the wrong choice in not choosing her as his main lover.
