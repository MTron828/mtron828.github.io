Chapter 141: The Fight For The Position Of Vice-Prefect

William was praising himself for thinking of such an amazing strategy in order to deal with the bastards who dared to challenge his authority.

‘Hmp! Since you dare to fight then you should be prepared for the consequences!’ William laughed inside his heart as he watched Drake’s and Spencer’s faces turn red from anger.

“Honored instructors, I know that this might be sudden, but can you allow this fight to happen?” William asked. “I need to fill up the other positions so that the management of the First Years will go smoothly.”

“… I will allow it,” Grent said with amusement. “Let’s go to the coliseum. Since it is another battle royale, it will be the best place to hold the competition.”

Drake and Spencer were cursing William internally. If not for the presence of the instructors, they might have already given him the middle finger.

They were already regretting the fact that they had dared to challenge such a shameless person. Even so, since they had already made a declaration they had to go along with it even though they were bound to lose.

“This William is very sly,” Andy muttered. “With this, no one will dare to challenge his authority in the future.”

The instructors, who heard him, nodded their heads in agreement. This was the first time they had seen such a character appear in the Martial Classes and it gave them a very refreshing feeling.

The students of the Magic and Spirit Divisions noted this strategy in their hearts. If they were to become the Head Prefects of their own Dormitories then imitating William’s approach would ensure that their position would remain safe and secure.

“William has grown a lot since the last time we saw him,” a beautiful young lady with midnight blue hair said as he held her lover’s hand.

“My cousin usually likes to act in a low-key manner, but since he was forced to be in the spotlight, he is milking it to the fullest.” The handsome young man with short red-hair nodded his head in agreement. “I never thought that he’d become the Head Prefect as soon as he entered the Royal Academy. I’m very impressed.”

“So you say, but were you not also the Head Prefect during your First Year?”

“Ah, it’s because there weren’t any strong individuals back then.”

“It’s not because there was a lack of strong individuals,” the beautiful lady said as she leaned her head on his chest. “You’re just too strong.”

“Perhaps.” the handsome red-head replied as he kissed his lover’s forehead. “We will visit him after the selection for the Head Prefect of our year is over. Make sure not to tease him too much when we meet up with him, okay?”

“I understand. Don’t worry, I will support you this year as well.”

“Thank you.”

Inside the coliseum, Drake and Spencer stood with their heads held high. The other students, on the other hand, were gripping their weapons in anticipation. If they could kill even one of these boys then the chance to become the Vice Prefect is assured!

The coliseum had an enchantment placed on it, similar to the Enchanted Forest. Anyone who died would automatically be ejected off of the battleground and taken to a safe location.

“Let the battle, begin!” William raised his fist and announced the start of the competition.

The students roared as they rushed toward the two boys with blood-shot eyes.

Drake and Spencer held their ground and unleashed their full power. Since they were about to die anyway, why not take as many of these bastards as they could with them?

The battle didn’t become as one-sided as William initially guessed. Sure, Drake and Spencer were disadvantaged, but they were two of the strongest students among the First Years in the Martial Division.

Both of them went all out and wore their enchanted armors, accessories, and weapons. It made them more formidable and more deadly.

Spencer danced across the battlefield using his superior mobility in order to dodge and attack his pursuers. Everytime he thrust his spear, a pain-filled scream would follow. Drake on the other hand, was like an immovable mountain. The pressure he gave off was not something that a regular student could hope to attain.

Even so, he received several injuries from the united attacks that were coming his way.

“Not bad,” William muttered as he observed the battle. “The two of them are quite capable. Don’t you think so, too, Mama?”

“Meeeeeeh.” Ella nodded in agreement. Although the two boys were weaker than her in her War Ibex Form, she had to agree that they were very competent fighters.

For a moment, those who were spectating thought that a miracle would happen. However, all of these expectations disappeared when a soft buzz reached Drake’s ears.

“Sh*t!” Drake cursed when he realized that the one who had killed him inside the Enchanted Forest had struck during a critical time. He was currently fending off four attackers, and the archer chose to attack just as he unleashed his attack.

It was impossible to dodge, so all he could do was endure. He hoped that his armor would be strong enough to block the arrow from the hateful black-haired-girl who had backstabbed him for the second time!

The arrow hit its target, and Drake’s body stiffened before turning into particles of light.

“Adamantium arrow?” William raised an eyebrow. “This girl really is scary. She still has trump cards up her sleeve.”

After killing Drake, Priscilla raised her head to look at William for a brief moment before aiming at Spencer in the distance. She fired four arrows consecutively forming beautiful arcs in the air.

When the arrows neared Spencer, they all detonated and gave a blinding flash of light. All the students, including Spencer, were momentarily blinded by the attack.

Priscilla nocked another adamantium arrow on her bow and took aim. The moment she released the arrow, a gust of wind followed suit. Her black hair danced as she narrowed her eyes to look at her target.

Spencer’s head was blown apart like a watermelon before turning into particles of light.

“So decisive,” William commented. “Not bad.”

Andy rubbed his chin with a smile as he looked at Priscilla. He had already intended to make her and William his apprentices during their stay at the Royal Academy. He was very satisfied with their performance and he hoped that they would continue to grow to become experts in the field of archery.

“The students this year are quite competent,” One of the martial instructors commented with a grin. “Looks like, this year, we will have a chance to teach those arrogant magicians a thing or two.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The other instructors nodded their heads in agreement. They had long accepted that they would remain in the lowest ranked position again this year, but the appearance of William, Priscilla, Drake, and Spencer brought them hope.

Priscilla tucked her hair behind her ear as she gazed at the boy that had beaten her during the competition. Unlike Drake and Spencer, she experienced first-hand how strong William was. She would definitely not underestimate him ever again.

Seeing the beautiful girl’s passionate gaze, William casually flipped his hair and nodded his head in acknowledgement.

“From this moment onwards, I declare Priscilla Nerelle Grandfall, the new Vice-Prefect of the Solaris Dormitory,” William announced.

“Also, I will be selecting a few more students to become the officers under my management. Even though the position of the Vice-Prefect is already taken, there are still other slots to fill! So, everyone, do your best. Those who perform well after a month’s time will become the next batch of officers for the First Years!”

The students cheered in unison. They were quite happy that they would be given a fair chance to show off their abilities and win an official position instead of having to use bribes, or lower themselves to become William’s lackeys in order to raise their ranks in the Solaris Dormitory.
