Chapter 468: Do You Have Good News For Me?

The Dark Blue Horse used its willpower to resist, but its injuries and William’s suppression prevented it from dispelling the Taming Skill on its body.

This was the first time that William had used this skill after Ascending his Job Class to the Quick Shot Shepherd. William was very curious about how strong this taming skill was.

Soon, the light receded and the red-headed boy immediately felt a connection with the Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie that had the rank of a Class A (Low) Beast.

It was one of the Powerful Beasts that the System had marked when the Angray Birds had flown over the region. Since William was planning to add more members to his army, and was itching to test his Beast Taming Skill, he decided to visit it first.

After healing the Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie’s injuries, William ordered it to gather the members of its herd. The Beast nodded its head and uttered a neigh that reverberated through the area near the lake.

Soon, members of its herd appeared to answer its call and they stood several meters away from their leader, while giving William a guarded look.

“Welcome to your new home,” William said as he opened his Thousand Beast Domain to welcome the new additions to his herd. “I’m sure that you will find the Dungeon of Atlantis to your liking.”

The Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie was the Alpha of its own herd, which allowed William to automatically gain over two hundred Water Kelpies to his King’s Legion.

At first, the Water Kelpies were hesitant, but due to William’s benevolent aura and the encouragement of their Alpha, they all entered the portal as they were told. The Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie was the last to enter the Domain, and William followed behind it.

There was already a lake inside the Thousand Beast Domain, so he didn’t have to buy another. Also, after teaching them how to travel to Atlantis, the Water Kelpies were like fish in the water. Even the Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie was quite satisfied with William’s arrangement because all of them were carnivorous creatures.

The Siokoys as well as the Nagas were the perfect beasts for them to hunt because neither of them couldn’t outrun or overpower the water horses in any bodies of water.

After making sure that the new members of his herd were satisfied, William returned to the real world and asked the System about the matter in the Capital City of the Anaesha Dynasty.

“Are they still looking for me in the City of Veritas?” William inquired.

[ Yes. The Qilin, Eneru, is currently above the city, frantically looking for your presence. ]

William chuckled before sending a telepathic message to his, ever lively, spy that was currently inside the city.

“Aethon, good job,” William praised the small bird who was always there to serve as his eyes during critical moments. “You can leave the city now. Make sure to fly towards the East, so that the stupid Qilin won’t get suspicious.”

“Chirp!”

After chirping its acknowledgement, Aethon flapped its wings and flew away. William would come to pick it up at a later time when he traveled to the Eastern Region of the Anaesha Dynasty.

Before William entered the capital, he already knew that he would be facing danger. This was why he had thrown Soleil towards the sky, where it passed through the dark clouds and basked in the sunlight.

Since the weapon was soul bound to William, it allowed him to instantly teleport to wherever it was. This was one of the countermeasures that he had made beforehand just in case he needed a way to escape the capital undetected.

After discovering the location of the Malevolent Nightmare Kelpie, in the Northern Region of the Dynasty, William controlled Soleil remotely and ordered it to head in that direction.

William knew that Eneru and the Elves would do everything in their power to capture him. Fortunately, he had already anticipated this scenario. The red-headed boy even thought of using this opportunity to piss them off further, and delay their return to the Zelan Dynasty.

William then activated the ring that was given to him by Conner as a means for the two of them to be able to communicate with each other over long distances.

Since the two of them were in a temporary alliance against the Elves, William decided to set aside their grudges for the time being, and collaborate with him to put an end to the war that they had started.

“Do you have good news for me?” Conner asked as soon as the connection was established.

William nodded his head and reported the things that happened in Veritas. Conner was surprised when he learned that the Elves had also tried to form an alliance with the Kraetor Army.

“Fortunately you have arrived in time,” Conner commented after hearing William’s report.

Although he had already established in his mind that William and Empress Sidonie had a good relationship with each other, he still had misgivings about the Kraetor Empire’s stance in regards to the Hellan Kingdom, and the Elven Army that was based in the Zelan Dynasty.

“How long do you think it will take before the Elves build their Teleportation Gate?” William inquired.

Conner pondered before giving a rough estimate, “At most we have a month’s time. Although it is short, there’s nothing we can do about it. I will continue to make arrangements for the defense of the City of Gladiolus. How about you? What do you plan to do?”

“Recruit more allies to fight by our side. I will keep in touch and return before the war reaches the walls of Gladiolus.”

“Very well. If there is anything that comes up, I’ll inform you right away.”

William nodded. “Alright, I’ll also keep in touch if anything happens on my side. Bye.”

The red-headed boy cut off the connection with a sigh.

“After a month, the real thing begins. We don’t have much time,” William muttered as he looked at his status page. The markers where the tameable beasts were located flashed before his eyes.

“System, prepare for flight synchronization.”

[ Flight Synchronization Activated. ]

William channeled his aura on Soleil and pointed its tip towards the East.

[ Host, please, raise Soleil to match your eye level. ] Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

William did as he was told and held the weapon in his hand steadily.

[ Move its tip three inches towards the right. ]

The Half-Elf followed the System’s instructions obediently in order to prevent himself from flying in the wrong direction.

[ Flight Pattern is now in Perfect Sync! All Green and ready for take off! ]

“Quick Shot War Art Fusion Form…,” William said with a serious expression.

“Blitzer Railgun!”

William and Soleil merged as one and shot out towards the sky. Their next destination was the Adamantium mine that the System had discovered.

Although the possibility was low, he didn’t want Empress Sidonie’s Worker Ants to accidentally bump into the Adamantium mine, as they traveled to the locations that William had written out for them.

William knew that he couldn’t possibly gather all the other resources located in the Aenasha Dynasty during that one month period. Although he was traveling five times the speed of sound, he had no doubt in his mind that the Ant Queen would soon discover the smuggling expeditions he was doing around her turf.

In order to prevent conflicts from arising, he decided to target the most important resources first, before shifting his attention to the Herd Type Creatures that he could capture along the way.

William felt regretful about divulging the location of the Mithril Mine, but he also understood that it was needed to entice the Young Empress, as well as the high-ranking officers of the Kraetor Empire to look favorably at him.

If he only knew that the beautiful Empress, and her mischievous other half, had made their decision long ago. He would have definitely kept the location of the Mithril Mine to himself, and used it to forge weapons and armor for his army instead.

Fortunately, he didn’t know that the two girls had one-upped him, or else he would have already spat a mouthful of blood, due to heart-ache and regret, for sharing so many resources with them. The list was long enough that it would have made his Grandfather, James, dance and laugh out loud for an entire day while shouting “We’re Rich!” over and over again.
