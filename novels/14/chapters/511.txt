Chapter 511: When The Past No Longer illuminates The Future, The Spirit Walks In Darkness [Part 1]

“Twenty thousand God Points!”

“Twenty five!”

“Thirty!”

William looked at the noisy surroundings as he sat in his VIP box inside the Auction House of the Gods.

This was a place where the followers of the Gods, as well as the Gods, bid for items that caught their fancy. Naturally, there were restrictions placed on the Gods that forbade them from bidding on any item that they saw.

Since the currency used were God Points, the Gods were clearly at an advantage. In order to balance things out, a clear-cut rule was made, so that certain items could only be bought by their followers.

The Auction of the Gods was separated by two schedules. The morning auction, and the evening auction. The morning auction as an exclusive auction for their followers. The evening auction, on the other hand, allowed both the Gods and their followers to bid for the items that they wanted.

Right now, William was seated on an expensive couch, with Lily’s head resting on his lap, as he waited for his auctioned entry to make an appearance.

Yes. This was also a place where the Gods, and their chosen candidates, could mingle and see each other freely.

Issei and David were also in the VIP room with William, and seated on special seats beside his couch.

William lightly patted Lily’s hair as he listened to the bidding war that was happening right now. If the disciples of the Loli Goddess could see the adorable loli right now, they would, without a doubt, raise a ruckus and conspire for William to get stabbed to death by kitchen knives.

“Sixty thousand God points! Going once! Going twice! Sold to bidder Number 69!”

The beautiful auctioneer smiled as she lifted her small wooden mallet and hammered it on her desk, which signaled the end of the deal.

Right now, William was a beggar. He had used up all of his God Points in order to seal Sepheron for a few seconds. This had given the System ample time to send it to the Auction House to be auctioned.

After receiving the confirmation of his entry, the Auction House gave him his own VIP room because the item that he had sent them for auction was a very hot commodity. Naturally, the Gods who favored William wouldn’t miss out on the fun and would participate in the war to buy the Demigod of the Silvermoon Continent, Sepheron, the Fire Phoenix.

The atmosphere inside the auction house was very lively. There were times when William was tempted to bid for an item, however, he didn’t have any God Points with him right now. Although Issei, Lily, and David were with him, his skin wasn’t thick enough to ask them for another loan.

William still owed them two hundred thousand God Points each, and he didn’t want to abuse their kindness.

The hours passed by as the bidding war heated up. William gulped because the highest amount of God Points that he had managed to acquire was one million God Points. But, he had used them all to merge the Undying Lands to his own domain.

Right now, a dozen Pills of Awakening, that were personally made by the Alchemist God, were being auctioned and the price had already reached two million.

Pill of Awakening was a special pill that allowed mortals to unlock their latent potential that couldn’t be brought out using normal means. This was a pill that the Gods favored to possess in order to distribute to their loyal followers, to help them succeed in the words where they currently resided.

“Pills of Awakening sold to esteemed bidder Number 007 for five million God Points!”

It didn’t take long for William to realize that when the auctioneer said the words “esteemed bidder”, it meant that the winner of the bid was a God. Several items had been bought by these esteemed bidders, and sometimes, their bidding wars would reach in the tens of millions.

“And now, we come to the highlight of tonight’s event!” the beautiful auctioneer announced. She then waved her hand and an image of a Phoenix appeared in a projection.

“This Mythical Beast is of the Demigod Rank,” the lady said with a smile. “Bidding starts at five million God Points with a minimum increment of one million.”

Lily, who was resting her head on William’s lap, raised her head with a mischievous glint on her eyes. She had come to the auction because she wanted to buy the Phoenix, Sepheron, in order to teach it a lesson that it would never forget.

As soon as the host announced that the bidding was now open, Lily immediately raised her hand and made her bid known.

“Six Million God Points!” Lily shouted.

“Seven Million!”

“Eight Million!”

“Nine Million!”

William wasn’t able to stop himself from grinning ear to ear because he had never expected that a Demigod could be sold for a high price.

‘I should have also captured Drauum,’ William thought.

The Half-Elf had no love for the Ancient Golem. However, for the sake of the Silvermoon Continent, he didn’t follow through with his plan.

Now that Sepheron was out of the picture, and Eneru had been turned into a Dark Qilin using his powers, the Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent had lost a big chunk of their powers.

If not for the fact that his mother and father were still in the Elven Continent, William wouldn’t have shown the Guardians any mercy and captured all of them.

Also, Skyla had told him that the Demons were still eyeing the Silvermoon Continent. The Elves still needed the remaining guardians to safeguard their lands. Right now, only the The Ent King, Myrendor, was left to safeguard the Silvermoon Continent, while they were away.

Fortunately for the Elves, the Demons didn’t know that Sepheron had been captured and that the other Guardians were trapped in the Southern Continent. Of course, they knew about the movement of the Elves, but no one knew that the portal that the Elves had made was a one way portal.

It meant that although Elven reinforcements could come to the Southern Continent, they couldn’t go back even if they wanted to.

“Ten Million!” Lily bid valiantly in order to deter the other Gods from fighting against her.

However, her adorable voice was silenced when a crisp and clear voice spread across the auction house.

“Thirty Million.”

Lily, and the other Gods turned their heads to the direction of the voice. Their eyes landed on an unassuming VIP Room that floated in the distance. The blinds of the room blocked anyone from identifying who the bidder was.

There were Gods who liked to keep their identity anonymous when they came to the Auction House. This allowed them to freely bid without being singled out by the other Gods who wanted the same item.

“Thirty Million!” the auctioneer repeated with a smile. “Anyone else?”

A few sighs of frustration echoed inside the Auction House, and Lily’s sigh was one of them.

“We got a big spender,” Lily bit her nails as she looked at the VIP room in the distance. “I have a feeling that even if I bid higher, that person will still outbid me.”

William who was seated beside the Loli Goddess patted her head. “It’s fine. You don’t need to bid higher. The current price has already exceeded my expectations. This is already enough.”

Lily nodded her head as she leaned back on the couch and allowed William to spoil her.

“Going once!”

“Going twice!”

“Sold!”

The resounding clap of the gavel signaled the end of the auction.

William glanced at the VIP room that had made a bid of thirty million for Sepheron, and bowed his head in gratitude.

The Auction House took a cut of 5% for every item that they had auctioned, leaving William with 28,500,000 God Points.

“Big Brother, you are now rich!” Lily said with a smile as she hugged William.

Issei and David also nodded their heads in agreement. They admired William for having the guts to send a Demigod to the Auction House of the Gods.

Ever since William succeeded in his first attempt to send Elandorr’s Beast Companion, the Silver Dragon, Deoldreoss, to the Auction House, the Half-Elf had considered using it as a means to deal with his opponents. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The only downside was that William also lost the pocket cubes that he had used to capture them.

Right now, he only had four remaining pocket cubes with him. Out of those four, one was already in use and held Xerxes, the Hobgoblin Arcane Doctor.

(A/N: Previously, Xerxes was only a Hobgoblin With Doctor. However, after receiving William’s blessing, its rank rose and it successfully evolved to a Hobgoblin Arcane Doctor.)

He had already asked Sancus, the God of Contracts, if he could get replacements, but the latter denied his request.

The God of Contract told William that he had already given him the maximum amount that was allowed by the rules that bound them. Adding more would put him in a difficult spot and he didn’t want to risk it.

William felt that it was a shame because he wouldn’t be able to use this tactic repeatedly. Although it was regrettable, William didn’t regret auctioning Sepheron to the Auction House of the Gods.

The Elves had grown very arrogant as of late, and it was good to bring them down a peg. Without the protection of their Demigod, and the loss of one of their Guardians, they would need to think thrice before planning to wage war on anyone again.

William knew that the Elves would no longer act as wantonly as they had in the past. A Demigod’s deterrent was the real deal. Without it, the Elves would have no choice but to strengthen their defenses in fear of another invasion from the Demon Race.

“Lily, is it possible for me to have a transaction with a God?” William inquired. “I plan to use my God Points to free some people.”

“Free some people? Lily tilted her head in confusion.

A smile appeared on David’s face because he had a hunch on what William was planning to do. Because of this, he placed his hand on the Half-Elf’s shoulder as he confirmed his guess.

“Is it about Zhu and Sha?” David asked.

William nodded his head in confirmation. Issei who was standing by the side crossed his arms over his chest as he thought of a plan inside his head.

“How about you let me handle this,” Issei proposed. “I’m good friends with the Jade Emperor. I’ll put in a good word for you and try to secure a meeting today.”

“Thank you, Brother Issei.”

“This is but a small matter. Leave it to me.”

William thought of the two demons that had helped him during his fight against the Celestial Army. He was indebted to the both of them, and the red-headed wanted to repay them in full for the debt he owed them.

‘This is the only thing I can do for the two of you,’ William thought. ‘May both of you find happiness in your next life.’

William’s wish was for Zhu and Sha to enter the Cycle of Reincarnation. He knew that this was the only way for the two of them to have a fresh start, and William was more than willing to pay the price for their freedom.

He just hoped that the Jade Emperor would listen to his request.

He hoped that he would show mercy and compassion to the two retainers that were forever loyal to his cause.
