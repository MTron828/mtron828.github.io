Chapter 424: Est’s Innocence [Part 2]

“Will? Is there something wrong?” Est reached out to touch the side of his face.

The moment the warm and soft hand touched his skin, William unconsciously drew a deep breath as he looked at his lover’s beautiful crimson eyes. He could see his reflection in them and it made him have a sense of pride, knowing that she would only look at him with eyes filled with affection. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes,” William replied in a hoarse voice. “You are driving me crazy.”

Before Est could even understand what William meant by the words “driving him crazy” she found herself pressed against his body as William held her in a tight embrace.

William had equipped the Incubus Job Class earlier in order to let Est have a taste of what it was like to share an intimate moment with him. However, there was some kind of force inside Est’s body that seemed to be at odds with the powers of the Incubus Job Class.

This power wasn’t hurting William, because Est didn’t perceive him as an enemy. However, her body had been blessed by the Goddess Astrid, imbuing it with Holy Power. Astrid was a member of the Righteous Faction and Est was her devout follower.

The Righteous and Evil Factions naturally repelled each other and this was what was currently happening between Est and William. The red-headed boy was getting the overwhelming desire to corrupt Est and conquer her.

This was something that he didn’t want to do, so he had to keep these lustful feelings at bay using his willpower. In the end, William decided to switch his Subclass and the desire to corrupt the beauty in his arms immediately subsided.

William’s body suddenly had a subtle glow of light in it, which resonated with Est’s own Holy Power.

“Will? What’s wrong? You look pale,” Est stared at him anxiously.

William smiled as he patted his lover’s head while trying to regain his composure. William had equipped his Sun Knight Job Class, which was also part of the Righteous Faction and the uncomfortable feeling went away.

“I’m fine,” William said as he hugged Est close to him. “Don’t worry. I was just…”

“Just?”

“Just… suddenly had the urge to kiss you again?”

“Then kiss me and don’t scare me like that.”

Est raised her head and closed her eyes. She waited for William to initiate the kiss because she liked the feeling of letting the Half-Elf take the initiative to kiss her. It made her feel that the love she had for the boy was mutual.

Est knew that William was just making an excuse, but she didn’t want to let this moment of intimacy slip away. She had endured long enough and wanted to be together with William as much as Ian and Wendy had been.

Just the two of them.

Without her retainers.

Without anyone watching.

Without any obstacles that prevented her from feeling loved.

Even though she couldn’t surrender her everything to William due to their age, she was still willing to do her best to understand what it was like to become lovers with the boy that she had loved for so many years.

Even without the Incubus Job Class, William was proficient enough to give Est what she wanted. The two kissed, and kissed, and kissed some more until Est found herself lying on the sea in William’s Spiritual World.

William looked down on her with undisguised love and affection.

Once again, William didn’t need the Incubus Job Class to mark the silver-haired beauty as his lover. He lowered his lips to kiss the nape of her neck which made Est’s body shudder. He kissed, and suckled that part and gave it a light bite, leaving a mark on her smooth, and pale, skin.

He could see Est’s skin reddened from the kissmark that he had left on her neck. He wanted to add more, but decided to hold back because he might not be able to stop himself if he continued with his line of thought.

“Will,” Est said as she reached out to wrap her arms around William’s head. “Don’t hold back. I am not a vase that will break easily. I am strong.”

The pair of crimson eyes that looked straight into his own light-green eyes made William’s heart beat faster inside his chest. The little snow rabbit was offering herself to him, and the red-headed boy was on the verge of turning into a wolf that would eat her up until nothing was left.

“Est…”

“Will?”

“Don’t say those words while you look at me with those eyes filled with yearning,” William stated as he planted a kiss on her forehead. “It’s a crime. I don’t want to be a criminal and…”

William whispered in Est’s ears which made the latter cover her face in embarrassment.

‘Seriously, how can my lover be this cute?’ William thought as he rested his head on Est’s soft chest to feel her heartbeat. Although both of them were still wearing clothes, William’s sensitive hearing could still hear his lover’s wildly beating heart.

He could also feel her warmth, her softness, and the subtle fragrance of her body. William took all of this in as he allowed himself to be lost in these tender feelings that both of them shared.

Suddenly, a pair of soft and slender hands rested themselves on William’s head and held him in place.

The two of them didn’t talk, for no words were needed. Est felt very happy because she was finally able to embrace William. Not in his unconscious state, but in a state where the other was able to reciprocate her feelings.

She prayed that once the war was over, William would be able to lift the curse on her body. That way, the two of them would be able to hold each other, not only in his Spiritual World, but in the real world as well.

Until then, she would hold on to his sweet kisses and whispers of love that made her realize that the words that her mother had told her long ago were indeed true.

“Est, when the sky falls down. There will always be people who will step up and carry its weight on their shoulders,” Elizabeth said with a smile.

“Will I be able to meet such a person?” Est asked. His face was half in doubt and half curious of the possibility of meeting someone who could create a miracle.

“Of course you will.” Elizabeth chuckled. “If it’s you, you are destined to meet such a person. Just know that if he really appears in your life, you’d better… hold him close and never, ever, let
