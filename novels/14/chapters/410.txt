Chapter 410: The Aftermath Of A Night Of Passion

Ashe looked at Wendy who was sitting inside the big bathtub. The blonde beauty had a very satisfied smile on her face and was currently humming a tune as she soaked herself in hot water.

“You seem happy today,” Ashe said with a smile. “Did something good happen?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Wendy giggled before nodding her head. She even gave Ashe a mischievous gaze which piqued the latter’s curiosity. The mermaid also noticed that Wendy was like a changed person after she had woken up.

Ashe could sense that the current Wendy was brimming with confidence and energy, which was quite different from how she had been just a few days ago.

‘I wonder what happened?’

Ashe was genuinely curious about this sudden change in her friend’s character. She also linked Wendy’s current bubbly self to the Half-Elf who was currently inside the Thousand Beast Domain to take care of some important matters.

“What happened?” Ashe inquired. “Spill it.”

“Not telling!” Wendy playfully stuck out her tongue as she dreamily closed her eyes. The events that had transpired inside the dream were still in her memory. Originally, she thought that she would forget about this passionate dream the moment she woke up.

She had told this worry of hers to William as they held each other after their passionate lovemaking.

William smiled and promised her that he would ensure that she would remember the dream even when she was awake. Although she didn’t know what William did, the events of what happened last night were very fresh in her memory.

In fact, she felt that she could recall this memory anytime, and the images would flow inside her head as clearly as the night they whispered words of love to each other.

Ashe knew that she wouldn’t be getting any answers from Wendy, so she decided to just interrogate William later. She had a nagging feeling that whatever was causing Wendy’s radiant expression was something major.

‘I will get into the bottom of this later,’ Ashe vowed as she joined Wendy inside the bathtub. ‘Whatever is making Wendy act this way, I want some of it as well.’

Inside the Thousand Beast Domain…

A sudden chill passed down William’s spine as he checked the conditions of Dia, Thor,and Ragnar.

“Mama, did you suddenly feel a cold breeze pass through here?” William asked.

“Cold breeze?” Ella tilted her head. “I don’t feel anything.”

“Must be my imagination.”

“Make sure to take a hot shower later just in case. We are high up in the mountains, so it’s natural to feel cold from time to time.”

William nodded his head. Although his body was already strong, and he had Lily’s lollipops to protect him from the common cold, he still thought that he should take precautions just in case there was something wrong with his body.

He had visited the Thousand Beast Domain because there had been changes in Thor’s and Ragnar’s bodies.

The stripes on Thor’s body had become more pronounced as if they were real lightning bolts. Ragnar, on the other hand, had grown a little bit. He was now about the same size as Thor. Only Dia remained the same and there were no visible changes in her body.

“Do you think they will wake up soon?” William inquired.

Ella nodded her head. “Yes. I can tell that Thor and Ragnar are about to finish their growth phase.”

“I’m worried about Dia. She’s still in a deep sleep and I see no changes in her body.”

“Don’t be. Dia is fine. Her body is taking sufficient magical energy from the Magic Crystals. Perhaps, her next phase requires more energy, so no visible changes can be seen at the moment.”

William scratched his head because he was not an expert in Magical Beasts. If Ella was telling him that Dia was fine then it must be true.

“Have you connected the new dungeon with the Thousand Beast Domain?” Ella inquired. “Chronos, Aslan, and the others are getting excited about their new playground.”

William shook his head. “I’m still in the middle of relocating the Bestiary from the Goblin Crypt to the first floor of the Atlantis Dungeon. It is a very delicate process. According to my estimate, it will take at least six more hours before everyone can travel there.”

Ella nodded her head in understanding. She didn’t ask how William was able to do the things he was able to do because there was no need for her to ask him. David had already passed all the information he knew about William’s Divinities to her, so she left him to his own devices.

“Mama, are you also excited to explore this new dungeon?” William asked.

“Yes,” Ella replied. “I think the other goats are also nearing their limit. Perhaps they will be able to evolve in a month or two.”

William smiled, “I hope for that as well.”

Ever since the Wolf Tide, he hadn’t raised any other goats again aside from the thirteen survivors of his herd. He made sure that they gained enough experience points so that they would become stronger and evolve just like Ella did.

The only dungeon that they had officially explored was the Goblin Crypt. William was looking forward to leveling up his Job Classes in order to prepare for the inevitable war that would come knocking on their doors sooner or later.

William bid Ella goodbye and left the Magic Crystal Cavern. There were many things that he had to take care of and one of them was the good news that he received from The System after waking up.

After his passionate night with Wendy, the System had come across a very interesting development that made William extremely happy.

For some unknown reason, Wendy was registered as William’s second Familia member. Although they did the deed inside the dream, William didn’t expect that the King’s Chesspiece would activate and register Wendy’s name as part of his Familia.

This opened up new possibilities for William because it allowed him to add a Subclass to his First Wife Candidate, which would increase her battle prowess. Not only that, Wendy would also be able to use the Experience Points inside the dungeon to increase her Rank as well as increase the levels of her Job Class.

However, there was some additional information in Wendy’s stats that made William feel like scratching his head in confusion.

-

Name: Wendy Cy Armstrong

Race: Human

Age: 16

Job Class: Magic Lancer (Level 28)

Subclass: None

Locked Prestige Class: Valkyrie

(Requirements not met)

[ Valkyrie ]

— Requirements to unlock Job Class

— Soul Mate Skill

— Imperial Lancer

— Celestial Bloodline

-

William didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry after seeing this hidden Prestige Class that Wendy could unlock once its requirements were met.

The Imperial Lancer was easy to understand, because it was the second stage of the Magic Lancer. However, he didn’t know where he could get the Soul Mate Skill and the Celestial Bloodline that was also needed to unlock this Prestige Class, which William believed had a deep connection with Wendy.

‘Asgard…?’ William thought.

At the beginning, he thought that the dreams were just dreams. But, now, he felt that he needed to keep an eye out for any developments that might happen in his dreams.

Wendy’s Hidden Prestige Class was a clear indicator that there was a deeper meaning behind the dreams they were encountering.

It was quite possible for Wendy to live her life without discovering this hidden power inside her body. However, since William had already discovered it, he would certainly do his best to help Wendy unlock this power inside her.

William exited the Thousand Beast Domain and returned to his room within the Great Chieftain’s residence. He was just about to look for Wendy when he noticed Ian sitting on the bed.

“Are you finished with your tasks?” Ian inquired.

William nodded. “There are still things that need to be done, but I am free for now.”

Ian smiled and walked towards Will. “Since that is the case, can you explain to me what happened to Wendy? She’s practically glowing today as if she had been injected with some kind of powerful serum that will keep her young and springy for years.”

William’s body stiffened when Ian transformed into her mermaid form and pressed her hand over her chest. Although he was wearing clothes, Ashe’s hand rested directly over the gem embedded in his chest.

“I don’t know what special serum you gave her, but I want some of it too,” Ashe demanded. “Will, you can’t play favorites. Are you going to give it to me? Or must I make you give it to me by force?”

Ashe’s hands then wrapped around William’s waist as she gave him a firm hug. Clearly, she had no intention of letting the Half-Elf go unless her demands were met.
