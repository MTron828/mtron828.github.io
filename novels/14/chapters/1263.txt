1263 A New world Order

Three days later under Invidia’s and Princess Aila’s care, William finally woke up.

He had no recollection on what happened during his fight against Felix, and what happened when he disappeared on the battlefield

Astrape, Bronte, Titania, and the Nymphs, told him about how his fight with the Heir of Darkness transpired.

They also told him about the powerful Demon who had taken over Felix’s body, Aka Manah, who pierced William’s chest with his Demonic hand, in an attempt to make him submit to Ahriman’s control.

A frown appeared on William’s face when Titania told him that he had almost attacked Chloee and Astrape in his berserked state.

Fortunately, something caught his attention, making him turn into a lightning bolt, and head towards the North where the Demon Continent was located.

After his subordinates finished their report, he asked everyone to leave him for an hour, so that he could process the things that they had told him. Even though everyone knew that there were other pressing matters to be discussed, they decided to give William some time to organize his thoughts before consulting him on what their next course of action would be.

‘Optimus, did you record these events?’

< Yes. Do you wish to view them? >

‘I do.’

Immediately, the obsidian gem in William’s chest glowed before a projection appeared in front of him.

The Half-Elf watched everything unfold with a serious expression on his face. The moment he went berserk, William noticed that his strength had surpassed what he could normally do when he was in a normal state.

After the Crimson Crown of Darkness that held Aka Manah in place was destroyed, the Half-Elf saw how his berserked state had tortured Felix before killing him and absorbing his heart.

‘He should have suffered more than that,’ William clenched his fist. The black-haired teenager could only lament that he wasn’t in full control of himself when the Heir of Darkness died.

Although Felix’s death had been gruesome, the Half-Elf wasn’t satisfied by it. He had long wanted to skin Felix alive, and let him suffer other torture methods. William would repeat this over and over again until he was satisfied before finally ending the green-haired Demon’s life.

The next scene however surprised him.

It was the battle in the Fortaare Desert where Gavin, Adephagia, Eros, Astrid, and Lyssa, fought together in order to corner Ahriman.

He watched how he tried to attack Gavin when the latter tried to stop him from charging at Ahriman in his berserked state.

The black-haired teenager’s eyes widened in shock when he saw how his other half took control of his body for a short period of time in order to deal a lethal blow to Ahriman.

Everything ended at the part where William’s other half had lost consciousness and entered a state of hibernation, leaving the Half-Elf with a few unanswered questions.

The first question of course was whether Ahriman was dead or not.

The Primordial God of Darkness and Chaos was someone that William wanted to kill more than he wanted to kill Felix. However, he also knew that it was impossible for him to kill a God, unless the Job Class, Pseudo-Godslayer was equipped.

With this Job Class currently grayed out, just like his Familiamancer skill. The black-haired teenager had no way to use it.

Even after the projection had long disappeared in front of him, William was still in a state of daze. His body felt so heavy, and he felt so empty.

Unable to personally torture Felix, and not knowing whether Ahriman lived or died, he felt as if a gaping hole was left in his heart. He was at a loss on what to do because the goal that he had set for himself had suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Only when he heard a knock on the door did William break out of his daze.

“Come in,” William said before rubbing his face with his palms in order to organize his thoughts.

“We met again, Lord William.” a woman wearing a veil to cover her face entered the room with steady steps. “I hope that you’ve been well since our last meeting?”

“I’ve never felt better in my life, Lady Nisha,” William replied in a tone dripping with sarcasm. “To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?”

Nisha ignored the sarcasm in William’s words and sat on the opposite couch, facing the black-haired teenager.

“I came to talk to you about matters of the state,” Nisha said calmly. “As much as I want to let you rest for a while longer, we cannot afford to delay the important issues that plagued the Elun Empire.”

“What issues?”

“Several. But, the most pressing one is the need to have a new Emperor sitting on its throne.”

William frowned before leaning on the couch and eyeing the veiled woman whom he had embraced before he left the Floor of Asgard.

“You already know that I have no interest in governing lands,” William replied. “Let my grandfather deal with it.”

Nisha chuckled as if she had just heard a funny joke. After her fit of laughter ended, she rested both of her hands over her lap and stared at the black-haired teenager who seemed to be thinking of other things aside from her.

“Your grandfather has already left the capital city,” Nisha stated. “He said that there are still places he needed to go, and he won’t be back for a long time. His Excellency, James, also asked me to rename the Elun Empire to Ainsworth Empire as soon as possible. He added that you shouldn’t look for him because he will just appear when he feels like it.”

William shook his head helplessly. It was very typical of his grandfather to come and go as he pleased.

“We’ve already talked about this. As long as you keep your end of the bargain, you may rule the Elun Empire as you deem fit,” William commented. “I will not tolerate the harassment of innocents. Do I make myself clear?”

“Of course,” Nisha replied in a heartbeat. “However, you will still need to attend the coronation ceremony to formally declare the founding of the Ainsworth Empire. This is something that must be done, even if it’s just a formality. The role I will play is that of a Minister, who will handle things in your absence, is that acceptable?”

William nodded. He didn’t have any complaints with this kind of arrangement.

“Now that the important issue has been dealt with, let’s talk about the second important issue,” Nisha said as she stood up from the couch and made her way to where William was to sit beside him.

“What major issue?” William asked as he glanced at the mature lady who was now sitting beside him. “Are you talking about the Alliance and the Holy Order of Light?”

Nisha nodded. “Actually, this next issue is truly important and it concerns the Demon Continent.”

William frowned. “What about the Demon Continent?”

Nisha didn’t reply right away. Insead, she summoned a black, round mirror and tapped its surface with her finger.

“Now that the Demon Continent has lost their leader, and Ahriman’s hold on the Demon Army has disappeared, civil strife is happening within the Demon Realm. Your cousin, Eve, has gone to the Demon Continent in order to pacify the uprisings and prevent further bloodshed.

However, that is not the main concern. The Holy Order of Light is planning to conquer the entire Demon Realm and make it their exclusive territory. Right now, the Demon Army has suffered major losses, and their casualties numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It will be impossible for them to resist the Holy Order of Light’s vanguard, which is now being held back by the Black Dragon that governs the Amberfang Fortress...”

Nisha paused long enough to allow William to digest her words. Although William wasn’t the smartest of person, it was quite clear on what the beautiful woman wanted him to do.

“Are you saying that I should be the next Demon Lord?” William snorted. “I don’t see any benefits in doing so.”

Nisha nodded her head as if to agree to William’s words.

“True, there are no immediate benefits that you may gain if you came to their rescue.” Nisha then removed the veil covering her face and gave William a very sweet smile. “But, doing so will make things difficult for the Pope that leads the Holy Order of Light. Now that the Heir of Darkness is out of the picture, her next target is none other than...”

“Me,” William commented. “Very well. I’ll play along with this plan of yours.”

“Good,” Nisha said with a mischievous glint in her eye.

She had long hated how the Holy Order of Light did things, and she would jump at any opportunity to make them suffer losses.

Now that William was awake, and his army still intact, it was time to make the world know that a new World Order was about to be born from the ashes of the war that took the Central Continent by storm.
