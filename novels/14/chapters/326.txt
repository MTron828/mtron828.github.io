The Giant Golden Ape stood when it saw the Blood Wyvern approach the airspace of Lont. After seeing Jekyll riding behind its back, it lowered its guard and sat near the entrance of the village.

“Good Job, Lufie,” Jekyll greeted the Golden Ape. “Have there been any troublemakers as of late?”

The Ourobro shook its head and patted its chest twice to say that everything was in order.

Jekyll nodded and thanked the Guardian of Lont for doing its duty. The Blood Wyvern then landed in the center of the village where the Town Hall was located.

A lady, wearing a black dress, was standing near the entrance. Celine watched as the Blood Wyvern landed in front of her before giving Jekyll an inquiring glance.

“James, Damian, and Gideon, have been turned into crystal statues,” Jekyll said. “This spell is slightly different from the one that The Organization had planned.”

Celine nodded. As a member of The Organization, she was not affected by the Continental Spell because of the oath that she had made when she joined the group.

“I think it has something to do with that golden light,” Celine replied.

“Yes.” Jekyll agreed. “I don’t know how it happened, but I’m quite satisfied with the result. With this, the important figures of each Kingdom are unharmed. However, I can’t say the same for their heirs.”

A black mist separated from Jekyll’s shadow. A few seconds later, Ezio appeared in front of the two with his trademark hood covering his face.

“How about the others?” Ezio asked.

Celine sighed and waved her hand.

The doors of the Town Hall opened and several statues were found inside.

Jekyll scanned the statues and saw several familiar faces. The most noticeable one was Owen. The old bastard had a lecherous smile on his face and had given the two thumbs up pose before he was turned into a crystal statue.

A small chuckle escaped Jekyll’s lips because he understood the old man’s antics. All the fighters of Lont had been gathered inside the Town’s Hall. Barbatos, and the other veterans of Lont had placed a powerful formation around and inside the Town Hall to prevent those who were not affiliated with Lont to enter its premises.

“How about the kids?” Jekyll asked. “How’s Eve?”

“The kids are fine,” Celine answered. “Eve is sleeping with the other kids in the underground shelter. All of them are safe.”

Jekyll and Ezio both nodded. They had already made enough preparations, so they were not worried about the safety of Lont. What they were worried about were Matthew’s, Leah’s, and William’s conditions.

Celine had sent Oliver to watch over William. The Parrot Monkey had sent her several messages these past few days and told her that William was safe for the time being.

As for Matthew and Leah, Ezio would be flying towards Ravenlord Citadel to look for them. He would then bring them back to Lont, so that they would be protected by Jekyll and Celine.

The only reason he had returned with Jekyll to Lont first was to make sure that the town was still in one piece. They were afraid that The Organization would take this opportunity to attack the town while the veterans of Lont were in their helpless state.

Although they couldn’t destroy the statues, they could still carry them away from the town, in order to deal with them at a later time.

“Go and bring Matthew and Leah here,” Jekyll said to Ezio. “I’ll watch over the town while you are away.”

Ezio nodded and jumped onto the back of the Blood Wyvern. It screeched once before flapping its wings to soar towards the sky. Jekyll and Celine watched as the Assassin disappeared from the Horizon before exchanging information with each other.

“William is in the Kyrintor Mountains?” Jekyll inquired.

“Yes,” Celine answered. “He’s… being well taken care of right now.”

“Is that jealousy I hear from you, Celine?” Jekyll teased. “Our Little Will is so popular with the ladies. I’m sure James will be laughing out loud when he marries many wives.”

Celine sighed and rubbed her forehead. When it came to William, her feelings were a bit complicated. The Half-Elf was her only Disciple and she cared for him. Perhaps, she even cared for him more than she would care for her own family.

This was why she had sent Oliver to watch over William and keep him safe, while she stayed in Lont to protect its residents from possible attacks from The Organization.

Since all of the veterans were out of commission, only Celine, Lufie, the Wyverns, the Mountain Trolls, Jekyll, and Ezio were left to protect the town. Although they were few, they were a force to be reckoned with because all of them had the fighting force of Centennial Rank Beasts and above.

Seeing Celine’s complicated expression, Jekyll decided to stop his teasing. He was about to discuss their next course of action when he felt a powerful presence nearing the town’s gates.

Lufie’s roars echoed throughout the town as the sound of fighting ensued. The Wyverns that were patrolling the skies screeched as they, too, descended to join the Ouroboro in battle.

Jekyll and Celine glanced at each other before charging towards the gates to reinforce the Beasts, who seemed to be fighting a hard battle. They still didn’t know who, what, or how many attackers there were.

All they knew was that they were more than capable of dealing with a Millenial Beast, and a dozen Centennial Wyverns, with ease.

When Jekyll and Celine arrived at the gates, Lufie had already fallen on the ground with a broken arm, and leg. He’s hateful roars, even in his injured state, showed that he was still prepared to fight this enemy that had appeared out of nowhere.

The Wyverns, on the other hand, were currently in a variety of injured states as they tried to prop themselves off the ground.

In the midst of this carnage, a handsome middle-aged-man, with long black hair-that rested behind his back-glanced at the two new arrivals.

Celine’s face paled because the presence the man was radiating was a rank that she was very familiar with.

“D-Demigod!” Celine gasped.

The black-haired, middle-aged man raised an eyebrow as he looked at Celine. He eyed her from head to foot before shifting his gaze to the Dentist of Lont who was glaring back at him.

“Stand back, Celine,” Jekyll stepped forward to confront the man. “I’ll handle him.”

The Dentist of Lont changed into his true form and roared before charging fearlessly at the Demigod who was causing a ruckus in his domain.

The middle-aged man snorted before flying towards the sky. Jekyll followed suit and soon, a world shaking battle of epic proportions was fought over the skies of Lont.

Celine watched in awe as the gusts of wind buffeted her from the ground. This was the first time she had witnessed a battle of this level. Seeing that the two powerful beings were not holding back their punches, she hurriedly activated the defenses of Lont to prevent any damages from befalling the town.

Although the children were safe inside the shelter that they had made long ago, Celine didn’t want to take any chances.

Why?

Because a single attack from the Demigod could easily wipe the entirety of Lont from the face of the Southern Continent. Celine was also not confident that she would be able to survive an attack of such magnitude.

Right now, the only thing that stood between total annihilation and survival lay in the hands of the Dentist of Lont… who always had a smile on his face.
