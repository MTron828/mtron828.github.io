Chapter 425: Pillar Of Support

“Where did the two of you go?” Wendy asked when William and Est returned to the Villa in the Thousand Beast Domain. “You’ve been gone for a few hours.”

William smiled and sat on the couch beside Wendy. “Est and I did some training. Right, Est?”

Est nodded. Her face was calm and collected, which was vastly different from the silver-haired lady within William’s Spiritual World, who melted with happiness because of William’s kisses.

Ian looked at her Young Master with an understanding gaze. After spending time with William over the past few weeks, she knew how passionate the Half-Elf could be when the two of them were together.

She assumed that her Young Master had been able to share an intimate moment with William based on the slight smile that could be seen at the corner of Est’s lips.

Wendy rolled her eyes at the Half-Elf’s futile attempt to hide things from her. If she hadn’t seen Est’s true form, as well as the affection that she had shown William when the boy was still unconscious, Wendy would definitely brush off William’s excuse like the passing breeze.

Even so, she just kept silent because she had already accepted that her lover was destined to have multiple lovers aside from her.

‘At least, I am his First Wife,’ Wendy thought as she leaned on William’s shoulder. ‘I will not give away my position to anyone.’

William didn’t know what his lovers were thinking. He just thought that he handled the situation really well and was giving himself a thumbs up in his heart for a job well done. His time with Est was truly sweet.

The Half-Elf enjoyed teaching her how to kiss and the latter, although a bit passive still, did her best to learn.

‘Still, I shouldn’t use the Incubus Job Class when I am with Est,’ William mused as he patted Wendy’s head while looking at Est. That was the first time William had felt the overwhelming desire to conquer and, in a sense, corrupt his lover by making Est fall into the throes of pleasure.

After consulting the System, both of them came to the conclusion that the polar powers of the Righteous and Evil Factions affected different Job Classes to a certain extent.

William didn’t want to conquer Est in that kind of manner because she was surprisingly innocent when it came to relationships. She was like a sheep and William was like a wolf. The poor sheep was unaware that the Wolf was planning to eat her whole, not even leaving the bones behind.

“A day’s travel in that direction, you will arrive at the Town of Lont,” a teenage boy said as he pointed at the distance. “I am one of Sir William’s Knights, so I have been in his hometown once. Do you still want me to accompany all of you or can you manage on your own?”

“If it’s not a bother, can you please accompany us till the end?” Paul, the new leader of the Freedom Fighters from the Zelan Dynasty replied with a smile. “I will ensure that you get enough food to last for your return journey.”

“Very well. I will guide you safely to Lont.”

“Thank you.”

Paul and the other fighters from the Zelan Dynasty had traveled for several days on horseback. They used teleport gates and asked many people for directions until they found a teenage boy riding on top of a Hippogriff in one of the towns located in the South Eastern Side of the Hellan Kingdom.

All of them were already losing hope, but Paul still urged them forward until they found the boy who was part of William’s Knight Order.

A day later…

“I-Is that a Millennial Beast?!” a pretty girl gasped when she saw the giant golden ape in the distance.

“W-Wyverns! And there are more than one of them!” another boy exclaimed as he pointed at the flying lesser dragons that were patrolling the skies.

Paul’s face became grim as he looked at these powerful creatures. Although there were more than two hundred of them in their group, they didn’t stand a chance fighting against the Ourobro. Adding the Wyverns to the equation would just lead to one ending, suicide.

“What’s wrong?” the teenage boy asked as he tilted his head in confusion. “Aren’t you going to Lont? We’re almost there.”

Everyone looked at the teenage boy as if he was insane.

“Can’t you see that Millennial Beast over there?” Paul asked back. “Also, those Wyverns. We will be dead if they fly in our direction.”

“Ah! So that’s it. I understand.” The teenage boy nodded his head as if he finally found the answer to his question.

“I had the same reaction as you guys when I first got here,” the teenage boy replied with a smile as if remembering a very fond memory. “Don’t worry. Lufie and the Wyverns won’t hurt us. Sheathe your weapons and let me do the talking. None of you are allowed to provoke them. Of course, if you want to die then go ahead.”

Everyone glanced at Paul as if waiting for him to give an order.

Paul hesitated for a while before returning his sword to its scabbard. He made a gesture for everyone to do the same and everyone followed suit.

“Are you sure it’s going to be fine?” Paul asked for confirmation. “Once we get in the range of those Wyverns, none of us can outrun them.”

“It will be fine,” the teenage boy replied as he patted his chest. “Just leave everything to me.”

The teenage boy took the lead and everyone followed behind him. The Wyverns had long noticed the group of teenagers from far away, but they ignored them. After living in Lont for so long, they had already grown accustomed to seeing people. They would not randomly attack anyone unless they sensed that they were a threat to the townspeople.

Lufie stood up and eyed the approaching company of young warriors. He gave a mighty roar as a warning to prevent them from going closer. The horses immediately panicked after hearing the Millennial Beast’s roar.

Fortunately, the teenagers were very capable and managed to reign in their horses before they could run away in fright.

The Wyverns also started circling the teenagers. They were ready to swoop down and attack if any of them did something funny.

“Lufie, I am one of Sir William’s Knights,” the teenage boy shouted. “Is he in Lont?”

The Hippogriff also screeched to inform Lufie and the Wyverns that it was an ally.

After hearing the boy’s and the Hipogriff’s calls, Luffy scratched his head as he made a gesture to one of the Wyverns circling in the air. The latter screeched back and flew towards the town.

Several minutes later, Matthew, Leah, and Celine stepped out of the gates of Lont. Ironically, Crown Prince Alaric and Princess Aila also came to see what was going on. They had nothing to do in Lont, so sudden changes in the routine immediately caught their attention.

When the Wyverns screeched and headed outside the town, they knew that something was going on, so they immediately went out to investigate.

Paul immediately recognized his Crown Prince and shouted the slogan of their Kingdom.

“Let the Sun of Zelan always shine brightly!” Paul shouted.

“”Let the Sun of Zelan always shine brightly!”” the teenagers shouted in unison to hail their Crown Prince.

(A/N: In the Zelan Dynasty, they refer to their Monarch as the Sun.)

“Paul!” Prince Alaric shouted in joy as he ran towards his loyal retainer. He had felt very guilty for leaving him behind during their escape from the capital. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It’s good to see that you are safe, Your Highness,” Paul dismounted from his horse and kneeled in front of Prince Alaric.

The other teenagers also dismounted and kneeled. Some of them were crying. Finally, they had found their Crown Prince. He was their last pillar of support after their leader, Arslan, had stayed behind to allow all of them to escape.
