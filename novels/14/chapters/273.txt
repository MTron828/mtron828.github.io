William sat in a meditative position inside a spacious cavern at the Thousand Beast Domain. This is where he had deposited the Magic Crystal Cavern that he had acquired in the Kyrintor Mountains, during their special mission.

Not far from him, Dia, Thor, and Ragnar lay in a special nest where they slept peacefully.

They were still in the midst of their hibernating period. The System told William that letting the three kids stay inside the Magic Crystal Cavern would greatly help them with their growth. Since that was the case, William decided to let the three rest inside the cavern for the remainder of their hibernation.

The other beasts within the domain also didn’t want to miss out on this and gathered inside the cavern as well. The Kasogonaga, Fenrir and the Trollhounds, the Blood Eagle, Cercopes Monkeys, as well as the Angray Birds were all inside the cavern to strengthen their bodies.

All of them were magical beasts, so having a steady source of magic power was beneficial for all of them.

Ella laid beside the nest of the three kids and looked at them with gentle eyes. She hoped that Dia, Thor, and Ragnar would soon awaken from their slumber and aid William in his undertakings.

With the help of the Magic Crystals and the three Centennial Ants that it had eaten, the Kasogonaga’s Rank has increased to a Class B Beast. It was currently the strongest creature that resided inside the Thousand Beast Domain, followed by Fenrir and the Blood Eagle, Scadrez, who both became Class C Beasts not long ago.

The Trollhounds, Angray Birds, and the Cercopes Monkeys, had also increased their ranks to the middle stages of Class D Beasts.

William was very satisfied with the rapid growth of his small legion that would become his main fighting force, aside from his Knight Order.

Everytime the Half-Elf visited the Thousand Beast Domain to check on the kids, and his legion, he had spent an hour or two absorbing the Magic Essence in the air, to increase the level of his Ice Wizard Job Class.

When he was inside the cavern, he would gain a thousand experience points every five minutes. With such an ideal place to cultivate, William wished that he could stay there for a long time.

Sadly, he was too busy and could only stay for a few hours inside the domain everyday.

After exactly an hour, William stood up and left the cavern. Like always, he visited the different places inside his domain and consulted with The System about possible add-ons they could include after they gained more God Points.

Suddenly, William’s body trembled and a searing pain spread across his chest. The pain was so intense that William felt that his chest was being ripped apart by an invisible force.

“System, what is happening?!” William asked through gritted teeth.

[ Host, the seal on your magic powers is about to break. The pain you are feeling right now is due to the reemergence of the magical power that had been suppressed for the last five years. ]

William’s eyes widened in shock when he heard The System’s reply. Soon, the surprise was replaced by happiness, but the pain he was currently experiencing made it hard for him to laugh out loud.

It was then when realized that the seal on his powers broke a few weeks earlier than he initially estimated. When he asked the system about this matter, the latter told him that it was due to the absorption of the dark energy from the twin dungeon cores, which sped up the seal’s duration.

As if waiting for that exact moment, a powerful shockwave pulsed around the Half-Elf as the shackles that bound his magic powers broke one by one.

The ground froze solid and Ice Spikes protruded out from the ground as William’s first magic based Job Class, Ice Wizard, resurfaced. A blizzard suddenly appeared out of nowhere, covering his surroundings in a snowy haze.

The sky of the Thousand Beast Domain darkened as thick storm clouds covered the sun. Dark energy oozed out from William’s body as the chains binding his Dark Magic broke apart as well.

Thunder rumbled and lightning snaked across the heavens. Some lightning bolts descended into the dark blizzard that was rampaging on the ground. A few seconds later, a terrifying tornado of ice, darkness, and lightning spiralled towards the heavens.

Kasogonaga opened its eyes after sensing the disturbance within the domain. It hurriedly ran outside the cavern to investigate when a white blur streaked past it. Ella had also felt that something was happening to William, so she decided to temporarily leave her wards as she went out to check on his condition.

The other creatures, except the three hibernating beasts, also rushed out of the cavern to see what was going on.

When they saw the giant tornado in the distance, they instinctively knew that William was at the center of it all.

“T-This?!” The Kasogonaga’s mouth dropped open as it sensed the overwhelming magic power that was congregating in the location of the dark tornado. As a Demigod, it had seen many things in its long life, but it had never seen someone wield so many powers inside their body.

Aside from the prevalent Ice, Darkness, and Lightning Magic, Kasogonaga also felt several powers which belonged to Fire, Wind, Earth, and Water. What was surprising was that it also felt that there were other powers in the mix that were almost too subtle to notice.

‘Can a Half-Elf really wield all of these powers inside his body?’ the Kasogonaga thought as it tried to understand what it was currently seeing. ‘No. Even those bastard Elves could only wield three kinds of powers at most, and they were among the races that are proficient in wielding Magic and Spirit powers.’

The Deity of the Sky shot down its initial assessment because William’s current state was something that it had seen for the first time. After their talk during the battle at the Kyrintor Mountains, the Kasogonaga understood that William wanted to visit the Silvermoon Continent to see his mother and also find a way to save his father.

Because of this, the two had come to an understanding that they were not enemies and could even cooperate with each other in order to return Kasogonaga to its former glory.

‘This is also a good thing,’ the Kasogonaga mused. ‘Currently, I don’t have the power to drown those long eared bastards to oblivion. However, having a strong ally would help me get stronger as well.’

While the Kasogonaga was deep in its thoughts, the denizens of the Thousand Beast Domain looked at their master with awe and admiration.

‘I knew that following him was not a mistake,’ Fenrir, the leader of the Trollhounds looked at the violent tornado with happiness. After it received William’s blessing, it became smarter and stronger than the average trollhounds.

After it hit Rank C, it unlocked the ability to communicate with William, and the other members of his King’s Legion via telepathy. Fenrir glanced at the other trollhounds. Sensing their leader’s gaze, the Trollhounds looked back at Fenrir with undisguised happiness.

‘Grow strong, My Brothers.’ Fenrir gave a low growl. ‘Someday, our Master will need our strength. We mustn’t disappoint him!’

The Trollhounds howled in unison in reply to Fenrir’s words. All of them vowed that they would become strong in order to fight by their Leader’s and Master’s side whenever their aid was needed.

The Cercopes Monkeys, who were usually rowdy, had quieted down. The same could be said for the Angray Birds who liked to curse at others.

Scadrez, the Blood Eagle, perched on top of the Hyperion Tree as its bloody eyes locked onto the Half-Elf that was at the center of the tornado. Unlike the others, it was a creature that could see past through most things and focus its gaze on anything that had “blood” in it.

William had promised it that he would supply it with Beasts to eat in order for it to become stronger. So far, it had only preyed upon the Goblins inside the Goblin Crypt. To be honest, it was growing tired of eating Goblins.

It hoped that in the future, William would be able to let it eat its fill of stronger and more powerful monsters outside the Thousand Beast Domain.

Half an hour later, the unprecedented phenomenon had ended.

William stood with his eyes closed as orbs of power made up of Ice, Darkness, Lightning, Fire, Wind, Earth, and Water, circled around his body.

A ray of light fell from the sky, as the dark clouds parted. The golden radiance of the sun joined the other elements as they moved around William’s body as if they were dancing.

It was as if they were celebrating that they had regained their freedom and could once again aid the Half-Elf in the battles that he was about to face in the future.

William opened his eyes as the flow of magic power circulated inside his body.

“Glacial Lance,” William said softly. Although he could summon the lance with just a thought, he decided to voice it out loud in order to declare that he was once again able to use his magic powers.

With a thought he shot it towards the sky, leaving a trail of white mist as it ascended into the heavens.

William threw several more glacial lances in rapid succession as he once again tested the extent of his powers.

The red-headed boy then bought a giant solid boulder from the God Shop that cost one God Point. He planned to use it for target practice to test his other powers.

William pointed his finger at the boulder as his hand imitated that of a gun.

“Bang!” William shouted as he shot a void arrow at the giant boulder. Although this skill’s main purpose was to blind its target, it also dealt a bit of dark magic, making it a nice alternative to deal both status and damage to William’s enemies.

The black arrow hit the boulder and small shrapnels of rock burst from its body.

Feeling like a child again, William fired Void Arrows using both hands like a gunslinger in one of the movies that he watched when he was still back on earth.

Seeing his playful attitude, the Kasogonaga decided to join in on the fun as it curled up into a ball and charged towards William’s direction.

Soon, the two engaged in a mock battle sending spells flying in all directions.

Ella shook her head as she watched the two “children” play their hearts out while they cursed at each other. It had been a while since she last saw William this happy. She hoped, more than anything else in the world, that the Half-Elf would continue to smile for more years to come.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
