Princess Sidonie kissed William’s lips passionately. It had been a while since the two of them shared intimacy because William had been so busy climbing the Tower of Babylon.

As the two of them shared a deep lingering kiss, William’s left hand rested on top of Ashe’s head. The mermaid was busy kissing Little William, who was very eager for her attention.

A few minutes later, Ashe straddled William and lightly moved her hips. Princess Sidonie was not the only one who was eager to make love with him. The beautiful mermaid had also been looking forward to this moment.

Ever since she and Princess Sidonie had given their first time to him, the two had come up with a plan on how to share William between the two of them. The current set-up was something that the two beautiful girls had agreed on beforehand, which made William very happy.

After a few rounds of lovemaking, the three laid on the bed with the two girls resting their heads on William’s chest. All three of them were very satisfied with their bonding session and were now talking about Kenneth’s reappearance within the Kraetor Empire.

“He has something important to tell me?” William inquired.

Morgana nodded her head. After Sidonie had reached her limit, the seductive succubus finished what her other half started.

“At least, that is what she told us,” Morgana replied. ” What should we do next, Darling?”

William closed his eyes as he pondered what to do next. If he were to believe what his two lovers told him, Kenneth’s purpose for coming to the Southern Continent was to spy on him on behalf of the Elders of his family.

The Half-Elf already had a hunch that this was indeed the case. Even so, he allowed Kenneth to stay close to him while they were in the Hellan Royal Academy. The reason for this was simple, for some reason, he felt that Kenneth had no intention of hurting him.

Even though he was a spy, he only reported what was on the surface, and not about William’s deepest secrets. This had made the Elders of his family not pay too much attention to the red-headed teenager.

Their opinion of him only changed when they had read the reports of what had transpired in the Southern Continent. Because of this, they had changed their stance on him and delegated him a target that should be placed at the top of their priorities.

“Maybe he came to warn me that the Elves are going to target me from the shadows,” William said after careful consideration. “What I did in the Southern Continent definitely ruffled their feathers.”

Princess Sidonie and Ashe nodded their heads at the same time. If the Elven Race still thought of William as a pitiful Half-Elf in the past, now they regarded him as someone whom they should pay extra attention to.

There were even talks about asking Arwen to be a negotiator in order to patch up the relationship between the Half-Elf and the Elves in the Silvermoon Continent. Not all Elves supported the Clans that had invaded the Southern Continent.

There were also rumors flying around that William had inherited his father’s position as the Dungeon Conqueror. This brought another round of headache to the Elven Council because this was a threat that they couldn’t ignore.

They had already seen what a Dungeon Conqueror could do. If they were to make one their enemy then they didn’t have to wait for the Prince of Darkness to appear in the world. William was more than enough to raze their continent to the ground if he felt like it.

The other Guardians, especially Escalor and Zyphon (the Guardian Deer), were quite adamant that the Elves should send an envoy to make peace with William. Both had been on the frontlines of the war and experienced the might of William’s Undead Army, which still brought them chills to this day.

Drauum had secluded himself in his domain and refused to come out. Sepheron’s disappearance weighed a lot on the Ancient Golem’s mind because the two had known each other for thousands of years.

Perhaps, due to the laws of the Silvermoon Continent, Sepheron’s disappearance had triggered a phenomenon.

The sole Guardian that had remained to protect the Silvermoon Continent, while the others were away, had transformed into a Demigod.

The Ent King, Myrendor, was once a World Tree.

After living for thousands of years, a seed had been born from its body. This seed had taken most of its powers, allowing it to grow.

After losing its strength, the Elves thought that the World Tree had died, and did their best to care for the new sapling that would take its place. Hundreds of years later, the first World Tree broke out of its empty husk and was born anew as an Ent.

Now, this same Ent had been blessed by the Silvermoon Continent, and transformed to a Demigod, replacing Sepheron as the pillar of support for the Elven Race.

“Sidonie, Morgana, I will leave Kenneth in your hands,” William stated. “Don’t hurt him, okay? He’s one of the few friends I have. In regards to his background as a spy, this is not a big deal. After all, the Elves have to think thrice if they want to mess with me again.”

“Understood,” Morgana replied. “Darling, what would you do if…”

Morgana didn’t finish the words she wanted to say, because she didn’t want to think of such a possibility.

William, who had been waiting for her to finish her sentence frowned.

“What is it?” William inquired. “Is something on your mind?”

“No. it’s not important,” Morgana replied. “Forget what I said, Darling.”

Ashe, who had her eyes closed, slowly opened them to look at Morgana. The two ladies exchanged a knowing glance. Both of them had discussed the possibility of Kenneth being cursed just like Est, Ashe, and Isaac.

If that really were the case, they would stop at nothing to ensure that the silver haired teenager would not pose a threat to their beloved.

A few minutes later, William fell asleep with both girls in his embrace. The Tower of Babylon was unforgiving and even with his Trump Cards, the challenges proved to be quite difficult.

Although the Agnis Family had stopped sending High-Rankers to hunt William down, the other ruling families had taken notice of him and Chiffon. Because of this, the two had to always be on guard against possible attacks from every direction.

Princess Sidonie and Ashe watched William’s sleeping face with gentle gazes.

After having their fill, both ladies kissed their beloved’s cheeks at the same time before closing their eyes to sleep.

Chiffon, who was sleeping in the guest room in William’s Villa, tossed and turned on her big bed. She had always slept by the red-headed teenager’s side, and sleeping all by herself made her feel uncomfortable.

It was as if something was missing in her life.

Chiffon sighed as she covered her eyes with her left arm. She knew that William was spending the night with Princess Sidonie and Ashe. The pink-haired girl had insisted that she would sleep with them, but William’s two lovers politely turned her down.

The two ladies told Chiffon that they wanted to be with William till morning, and humbly asked her to not disturb them during that time.

As someone who had never been in a relationship before, Chiffon was clueless why she couldn’t join them on the bed. Even so, she respected her friends’ requests because they had taken good care of her as well.

‘I wish morning would come soon,’ Chiffon thought as she sighed internally. ‘Big Brother, I want to eat you soon.’
