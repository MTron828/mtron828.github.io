Chapter 129: The Lance that Shines to the Ends of the World

After filling out his registration form, William officially became a student in the Royal Academy. The staff gave him his uniform as well as the key to his dormitory room. Of course, the dormitory room in the Royal Academy was shared by two people.

This meant that William had a roommate whom he would be spending time with for a whole school year.

Right after getting his key, William had locked himself inside his room in the Solaris Dormitory. Est, Ian, and Isaac weren’t able to see him because they lived in a different dormitory belonging to the Magic Division.

Est was still worried that William would hate him because he had chosen to become Ian’s accomplice in tricking him. The Young Master was feeling down and even Ian, who had a smug expression a few hours ago, looked at him anxiously.

“I-If there is a need to apologize then I will apologize to him,” Ian said after thinking things through. “Knowing William, he won’t really hate the Young Master. At most, he will just hate me and think of a way to make me suffer for the things I did to him.”

Est sighed and nodded his head. He knew that he couldn’t do anything right now. He intended to give William some time to cool down before going to find him so he could give him a proper apology. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

What Est didn’t know was that William wasn’t thinking of them at all at the moment. He was busy checking the “God Shop” inside his system and looking for things to buy with the God Points that he had accumulated.

The red-headed boy had received a mission to save the Merchant Group while he was traveling towards the capital of the Hellan Kingdom. This act of heroism had given him 500 God Points.

Also, he acquired two hidden quests during the Academy’s entrance exams. One was to save as many children as possible and help them reach their destination. The points for this mission were calculated by the number of survivors multiplied by 10.

All fifty students had survived thanks to William’s help, which netted him another 500 God Points.

The one that gave William a pleasant surprise was the hidden quest “Beat the Ruler of the Forest”.

[ Defeat the Ruler of the Forest ]

[ Reward: 1000 God Points ]

This unexpected surprise made William very happy. With 2,000 God Points in hand, he immediately went to open the God Shop to see what interesting things he could buy.

Over the past four years, he had received God Points through the completion of his training and additional points that the system treated as “Bonus” God Points for William’s performance. All in all, he managed to accumulate 5,000 God Points.

Back then, he jokingly asked the system to give him a recommendation on the first thing that he needed to buy. Naturally, the system complied and the item that appeared in the God Shop was something that William wasn’t able to pass up.

The system had recommended a weapon that cost 50,000 God Points and it was none other than Rhongomyniad, The Lance that Shines to the Ends of the World.

It was the Holy Lance that belonged to King Arthur according to the legends. However, this particular lance was forged by a God. For some reason, the weapon was also able to bestow the Cavalier Class on other people, if the right conditions were met, and if William allowed it.

Another good feature of the lance was that it was imbued with the Holy Property. After the fight with the Cyclops, William realized that he was severely lacking in Elemental weapons against certain types of creatures.

The original cost of this lance was 50,000 God Points. However, since William received a special discount coupon from the God Shop, he could buy one item with a 90% discount.

William could have ignored the system’s recommendation, but after seeing the information on the Holy Lance, the red-headed boy bought it right away.

His reason for buying it?

Because there was a special class attached to it and it was none other than the Cavalier Class.

The Cavalier Class gave him the ability to fight side by side with Ella while mounted on her back. Another good feature of this Job Class was that it didn’t rely heavily on Mana. Most of the skills in the Cavalier Class were passive skills, which made William very happy.

As for why he didn’t use Rhongomyniad during the battle against Psoglav, it was due to the many “spectators” that were watching the battle. Rhongomyniad was a weapon forged by a God. It would be stupid to show it off in front of others while William was in a weakened state.

Now that he had 2,000 God Points in his possession, William scrolled through the God Shop in search of any items that he could buy with his current funds.

It didn’t take long for him to realize that there were very few things that he could buy with 2,000 God Points. Most of the items that William wanted were priced at 10,000 God Points at the minimum.

In the end, William decided to use his trump card in order to get the best deals in the God Shop.

“System, can you give me any recommendations on what to buy with my current funds?”

[ Certainly. Please, wait for a while as I search the God Shop for possible items that you might need. ]

‘… System, I got to admit that you are good at sucking all my God Points dry.’

[ Thank you for your praise. Please, leave a five-star review after you make your purchase. Thank you for your patronage~ ]

William sighed and purchased the two arrows and added them to his quiver. With this, he would be able to increase the trump cards in his arsenal. Even if he used these two arrows in public, no one would think that it was strange.

There were plenty of elemental arrows sold in the market and William having a few of them wouldn’t make other’s eyes go green with greed.

The only difference between the elemental arrows sold on the market and William’s was that the red-headed boy’s arrows were forged by a God. Naturally, their efficiency couldn’t be compared to those that were forged by mortals.

While William was admiring his two arrows, a soft knock was heard on the door. The red-headed boy hurriedly returned his items inside his storage ring and went to answer the door.

When William opened the door, he saw a delicate silver-gray-haired boy wearing glasses. He was holding a small backpack on his back and wearing expensive clothing.

“H-Hello, is this room 401?” the young boy asked in a timid voice. “I have just arrived today and the registrar’s office told me to go to this room after I finished my registration.”

“Yes, this is indeed room 401,” William replied with a smile. “Please come in.”

“Thank you.” the young boy bowed and entered the room.

When William closed the door, he smelled a faint scent of herbs. He didn’t think much about it and sat down on his bed while looking at his roommate. William had a feeling that his roommate and him would get along well during their first year inside the Royal Academy.
