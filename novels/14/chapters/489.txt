Chapter 489: I. AM. NEVER. ALONE! [Part 2]

Two portals appeared behind William and fourteen goats stepped out from it. They positioned themselves in a line in front of the boy, with Ella taking the lead.

More portals appeared and the Trollhound Cavaliers, led by Fenrir, flanked William’s right side. Mohawk and the Cercopes monkeys flanked his left.

The Centaurs lined up behind William, and hundreds of Rainbow Birds circled the sky above them. Psoglav whistled as he saw the massive army in front of it.

“The rewards should be worth all of this effort,” Psoglav muttered as it grinned. It had accompanied William for a very long time, and had gotten used to all the ups and downs of being with him.

Psoglav knew that this time, it would be risking its life, but it was also looking forward to the rewards it would gain after the battle was over.

Scadrez, the Blood Eagle, shrieked mightily as it hovered in the air. Kasogonaga sat on its back and eyed the Elves with killing intent.

A beautiful Elf stepped out of the portal and stood beside William as she gazed at the Elves in the distance. She was wearing her black, latex, armor that highlighted the curves of her body, that would make any man look at her with infatuated faces.

Celine summoned her Deathscythe as she stared fearlessly at the army in front of her. Oliver landed on her shoulder, as it too, looked at the Elven Army with a smirk on its face.

Not long after, Wendy also appeared and stood at William’s right side, followed by a husky with a lightning bolt stripe on its fur. She held her spear firmly on her hand, and a determined look could be seen on her face.

Est stood beside Wendy and held a plain looking sword in his hand. This was the sword that a Human Hero had wielded during the Era of the Gods to protect the Human Race from complete annihilation.

Isaac stood beside Est, and beside him was Ragnar, whose tongue lolled outside of its mouth. It was his duty to protect his Young Master, and he wouldn’t allow him to fight alone.

“Remember your promise.” The apparition of a lady with light-blue hair embraced William from behind. “I will fight by your side, so you can leave everything to me.”

William nodded as he raised his hand to caress the side of Ashe’s face. The beautiful mermaid had decided to fuse with him in this battle with the Elves. Although his Spiritual World had recovered, she was still worried about a relapse.

William didn’t reject her proposal because he knew that his lover was only worried about him. Besides, having Ashe with him put his mind at ease as well.

While the two were showing off their public display of affection, hundreds of portals continued to appear behind them.

Thousands of Goblins that were mounted on Scavenger Goblin Dogs also arrived at the scene.

Spire, along with its herd, also appeared. It promised William that it would help him three times, and this was one of those times where it would extend its hand to aid the boy and fight by his side.

The Kelpies, Wild Bisons, and other Beasts that William had tamed in the Anaesha Dynasty also made their appearances. The army grew, in the thousands, and more was pouring out of the portals.

The faces of the Elves remained unimpressed, because a few thousand new enemies wouldn’t be able to change the outcome of the war. However, all of their faces stiffened when tens of thousands of portals appeared once more behind the boy.

Lamassus’ flew in the hundreds of thousands, covering the sky with their mighty wings. Erchitu, along with the minotaur race, stepped forward and their presence made the Defenders suck in their breaths in anticipation.

Millions of Minotaurs stepped out of the portal; and when the Forest Wolves saw them, they unconsciously took a step back due to the Minotaur Races’ passive Intimidation Ability.

Suddenly, Drauum’s, Eneru’s, and Ezaklaros’ expressions became serious when they felt a powerful presence coming out from one of the portals.

Two Minotaurs that were three-meters tall stepped out from a golden portal that appeared in the sky.

Icarus and Daedalus looked down on the Elven Army while holding their Great Axes with both hands. They were the Two Great Champions of the Minotaur Race and fighting was their forte.

A buzzing sound spread across the battlefield as a three-meter-tall Black Minotaur stepped out of the Golden Portal.

He was none other than King Minos. The Sovereign of the Minotaur Race, and just like Drauum, he was a Pseudo-Demigod.

The Kraetor Empire, that was watching from the side, was dumbfounded by the sudden appearance of the Minotaur Race. They had heard that the Minotaurs had sealed themselves inside their Sanctuary, so they didn’t expect that they would appear in this war against the Elves.

William’s Passive Skills, Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing, Beacon of Hope, and Heroism had all been activated to raise the stats of his entire Herd and King’s Legion. Right now, King Minos had given William complete command of the Minotaur Race, so all of them had been temporarily registered as part of his King’s Legion.

Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing and Beacon of Hope gave everyone +60 to all of their stats. However, Heroism was the skill that trumped everything. This skill increased everyone’s stats by 50% if they were fighting against opponents that were stronger than them.

William had assigned Drauum as the strongest opponent in the battlefield, which had dramatically increased the strength of each member of his army.

“Ox’s Strength,” William said and an orange glow enveloped his forces, increasing their Strength Stat by an additional 20 points.

“Leader of the Herd.”

Ella’s body glowed faintly as her stats increased by ten.

This was William’s very first buff that had made Ella become his main fighting force during his younger years. Although ten stat points didn’t seem to make any difference right now, it was still an important buff that made everyone recognize Ella as the Leader behind this mighty Legion.

“Show them the power of the Angorian War Sovereign!” William ordered.

The fourteen goats bleated in unison and their bodies grew up to ten meters tall. Their massive horns glinted with a deadly hue as they lowered their heads and prepared to charge.

This was the next form of the Angorian War Ibex, and it was one of the reasons the Hellan Kingdom wasn’t able to conquer the Kyrintor Mountains. These Behemoths were all Centennial Ranked Monsters, and their destructive power couldn’t be underestimated.

William jumped onto Ella’s back as he looked fearlessly at the opponents whom he had thought to be unbeatable many weeks ago.

Elandorr hastily made an order for the vanguard to regroup with their main army. This was no longer a battle where they could use their numbers to their advantage. The pressure that William’s King’s Legion presented to them made their hearts shudder.

Drauum, Eneru, and Ezkalor, along with the other beasts also returned to the main army as they prepared themselves to clash with the sudden reinforcements that arrived out of nowhere.

“Trample all those who stand before me!” William pointed his staff at the Elven Army as he activated one of his skills that received a massive upgrade after his King’s Legion crossed over the million mark. “Set Forth!”

“Unstoppable… Million Beast Charge!”
