Chapter 349: Unexpected Turn Of Events

After getting a One Million God Point Loan from several sponsors, William decided to bring the entire Hidden Valley inside his domain.

Since the Ancient Monument was merged with the land itself, it would be impossible not to bring the valley along when he moved the entrance of the Undying Land inside his domain. When Jekyll heard William’s explanation, he thought that the boy had gone crazy due to the killing.

“Can you repeat what you said?” Jekyll asked as he looked at William in a weird manner.

“I will be taking this entire Domain with me,” William replied with a smile. “I know that it sounds unbelievable, but trust me, I can make it happen.”

They had already exited the Hidden Domain and were currently standing in front of the Monument that served as its entrance.

Ian and Psoglav were also looking at William as if he had lost his marbles. Although they had only spent a brief time inside the Undying Lands, they understood that it was something that couldn’t be taken as a whole as if it was just a cabbage from the farm.

William knew that none of them would believe him, and he wasn’t surprised about it one bit. Frankly, he also didn’t know how The System would do it. The only thing he could do was believe that it would become a reality.

“Okay, so what are we going to do now?” Jekyll inquired. Although he was still in doubt, he decided to trust William just this once.

He also wanted to see how the red-headed boy was going to pull it off. Jekyll knew that he himself wouldn’t be able to carry away the entire domain, even if he used his true form.

“Please bring Ian and Psoglav to where Dave is and leave the valley as soon as you can,” William explained. “I don’t want any of you to be caught up in what is going to happen.”

Jekyll reluctantly nodded his head and took Ian and Psoglav with him. Ian gave William a worried glance, but the latter only smiled back and told him that everything was going to be fine.

When the three had left the Hidden Valley, William focused his attention on the Monument in front of him.

‘System, I’m ready.’

[ Host, please brace yourself. ]

[ Initializing Domain Merging… ]

[ Pooling resources… ]

[ First Phase Commencing… ]

As soon as the System finished his announcement, the entire Hidden Valley started to shake. The Beasts that were living in it roared in confusion and fear as the land they had lived in for many years suddenly suffered from an earthquake.

The flying beasts immediately took to the skies, while those who roamed the land ran away in panic. All the inhabitants of the Hidden Valley started to flee in different directions.

William didn’t have time to worry about them because he was busy trying to keep his footing. He had already embedded the wooden staff on the ground and used it as support to prevent himself from being tossed about with the shaking of the ground.

The System had told him that he should remain as close to the Monument as possible in order for the transfer to work. William just didn’t realize that the entire ordeal was, literally, going to be an Earth Shaking experience.

Ian, Jekyll, Psoglav, and Dave, who were currently flying not far from the Hidden Valley, saw an unbelievable sight.

The valley started to break free from its surroundings and slowly rise. While this was happening, several beasts jumped off the edge of the valley, while it was still a few meters above ground.

The majority of them were Class D and Class C Beasts. There were even a handful of Class B Beasts in the mix. They were all dumbfounded by what was happening to their old hunting ground.

[ First Phase Completed! ]

[ Starting the Second Phase… ]

Just like what had happened back in the Kyrintor Mountains, the system temporarily established a pseudo-God Domain. This was the only way to forcefully merge the Thousand Beast Domain and the Hidden Valley.

Meanwhile inside the Floating Fortress in the Undying Lands…

“… Someone is trying… to bend reality,” a hoarse voice said with undisguised surprise. “… Foolish Mortal… Do you think… that you can take… the Undying Lands… as you please?”

A gigantic beam of dark light shot from the fortress towards the Gateway of the Undying Lands. It passed through the gate and travelled across space and time.

[ Emergency! ]

[ Emergency! ]

[ A powerful wave of Dark Energy is about to pass through the Monument. Host! Brace yourself! ]

Just as soon as The System warned William of the incoming attack from the domain, a surge of Dark Energy erupted from the monument and descended on William like a tidal wave.

Just before the wave was about to fall upon him, the collar on William’s neck glowed brightly. At the same time, the blue gem embedded in his chest shone with a radiant blue light.

A Black-Rose-Tattoo, with the blue gem at its center, appeared on William’s chest and forcefully swallowed the Mass of Dark Energy at a rapid pace. Soon, a giant dark-magic barrier enveloped the entire valley that was still floating in the air.

The spectators watching from the outside didn’t know if this was part of William’s plan or not. Jekyll frowned because he had briefly sensed the presence of a very powerful being within the valley.

The Dentist of Lont was certain that it didn’t belong to William because the presence he felt was in a realm that was well beyond the boy’s current capabilities.

‘Pseudo-Demigod!’ Jekyll narrowed his eyes. ‘I’m certain, it belonged to a Pseudo-Demigod.’

A Pseudo-Demigod was a being that had reached the peak of the Myriad Beast Realm. They were just a step away from becoming full-fledged Demigods and Jekyll was sure that the one responsible for this phenomenon was a being that was as stronger than him.

However, this understanding didn’t help the current situation. Jekyll didn’t hesitate and made up his mind to save the boy from harm. After all, William was the one-and-only son of That person.

A person whom Jekyll had acknowledged as the most precious companion in his life.

“Get as close as you can to the valley!” Jekyll ordered. “I’m going to save William!”

Dave gritted his teeth as he and Lionheart flew towards the valley that was floating in the sky. However, just before Jekyll was about to jump, the entire Hidden Valley disappeared right in front of their eyes.
