Chapter 441: William Vs Elandorr [Part 2]

The Elves watching the battle from the forest drew in a deep breath when they saw the attack that William had pulled back at the last second.

Although they were quite far away, they instinctively felt that they would have also been affected by the powerful attack that the Half-Elf had unleashed, if he hadn’t stopped it like he did. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Elandorr calmly dispelled the barrier protecting him and eyed William with a serious expression. His earlier composure could no longer be seen and one could tell that he now took his opponent seriously.

“I see that you can back up your arrogance,” Elandorr said as he activated the enchantments on his armor.

“And you can’t back up yours,” William replied snarkily. “I expected more from the Commander of the Elves, but I guess I was hoping for too much. You ain’t worth sh*t.”

A second later, the two teenagers clashed. The ground under their feet broke apart and pieces of soil and rocks were launched into the air around them.

Elandorr unleashes several swift strikes of his sword, which William countered with strikes of his own. Due to the staff’s longer reach, Elandorr had no choice but to take a few steps away to distance himself from William’s fierce and relentless strikes.

As Elandorr backed away, the tip of his sword skid across the ground, creating magical sparks. He then swung it upwards in an arc, creating a wave of soil and rocks that headed in William’s direction.

William stomped his feet on the ground and thrust his staff forward. The wave of soil and rocks froze in place before blowing up into a thousand pieces.

Suddenly, these pieces of soil and rock merged together and hardened, transforming into Stone Bullets. With a wave of his staff, these Stone Bullets rained down on Elandorr, leaving no room for him to maneuver.

With a loud shout, the Elven Commander created a Wind Tornado with him at its center. All the Stone Bullets aimed at him were all sucked up and returned to William with twice as much force thanks to the tornado’s momentum.

William flicked his arm and a wind funnel appeared in front of him. Just like what Elandorr did, he sucked up all the Stone Bullets, but this time, instead of sending them back, he merged them together.

“Quick Shot War Art, First Form,” William said as his hand made a gesture to imitate a handgun. “Destroy everything in your path…”

“Railgun!”

Due to how fast this attack was, Elandorr had been unable to react right away. If not for the fact that his life saving artifact activated automatically, he would have been impaled by William’s Earth Spear, that traveled at the speed of sound.

A loud explosion took place and the Elven Commander was blown away due to the force of the impact. He received no injury due to the barrier that protected his body, but he was still blown tens of meters away from where he stood, slamming into the trees in the forest before finally coming to a stop.

William summoned Stormcaller and lightning crackled upon its blade tip.

“Lightning God War Art, Thirteenth Form,” William roared. “Go for the kill!”

“Gaebolg!”

The lightning spear flew towards the fallen Elven Commander without mercy. William had already decided to kill Elandorr because he could tell that the latter also wanted him dead. Since that was the case, there was no need to show mercy.

The red-headed boy had no compassion for those who deserved to die.

Even though the barrier protected Elandorr, the impact of William’s attack had briefly paralyzed his body. The barrier had also disappeared, leaving him exposed to the Half-Elf’s killer blow.

The sound of metal clashing against each other reverberated within the forest as Stormcaller’s blade tip collided with a shield made from adamantium. The Blademaster that served as Princess Eowyn’s Guard had appeared in front of Elandorr to block the strike that was meant to take the Elven Commander’s life.

“Hah!” The Blademaster shouted and the shield in his hand glowed brightly. With one powerful push, he repelled Stormcaller’s attack, sending it hurtling towards the sky.

William snorted and raised his hand to recall Stormcaller. He then looked at the fallen Elven Commander in disdain as he rested the handle of his spear on his shoulder.

“Weakling,” William said in contempt. “If that’s all you can do then you’d better pack up and return to the Silvermoon Continent. Make sure to tell your Patriarch that I, the son of the Hero that saved your race, used your face to wipe the floor.”

William twirled the spear in his hand and pointed it at Elandorr’s direction. “Feel free to challenge me in a hundred years. Maybe, you will stand a chance by then.”

The young Elven Prodigies who saw William’s dominating performance felt their hearts tremble. They thought that they were already the strongest teenagers, not only in the Silvermoon Continent, but in the entire world of Hestia as well.

“He really is the son of our hero,” a pretty Elf said softly. “He’s so strong!”

The Elves near the girl nodded their heads in agreement. Elandorr was hailed as one of the strongest Prodigies in the Elven Race, and William dealt with him in a manner that made him look like a fledgling warrior who was fighting for the first time.

“I’ll kill you!” Elandorr shouted as he forced himself to stand. “You filthy Half-Blood!”

Elandorr’s face was now distorted with rage due to the embarrassment and humiliation that he suffered from William’s words.

Princess Eowyn almost didn’t recognize the young Elven Commander because this was the first time she had seen Elandorr’s rage-filled expression. She unconsciously took a step back due to how scary Elandorr’s expression was.

“Come and help me turn this scum into ashes!” Elandorr roared as he pointed his finger towards the sky. “Hear my call, Deoldreoss!”

A silver beam of light shot out of his fingertip and formed a Giant Magic Circle in the air.

Moments later, A ten-meter-long Silver Dragon emerged from the magic circle and gave an intimidating roar.

“Kill him for me! Deoldreoss!”

The Silver Dragon who was at the apex of the Millennial Rank opened its massive jaw and prepared to fire a Dragon’s Breath. Erchitu immediately stepped in front of William and took a defensive stance to protect the Half-Elf.

Deoldreoss was about to unleash its ultimate attack when a cry of a crane sounded from the heavens.

Suddenly, a blue comet slammed into the Dragon’s head, making it stagger and preventing it from executing its attack. The blue comet repeatedly attacked the Dragon’s head with a vengeance, not giving it any chance to resist.

Soon, the Silver Dragon crashed on the ground, due to a powerful blow that made it unable to stay airborne.

Elandorr glanced at his fallen Beast Companion before shifting his gaze to the one responsible for thwarting his plan on killing this hated Half-Elf.

A white crane flapped its wings in arrogance as it uttered a loud and deafening cry.

“T-That crane!”

“It’s her Excellency!”

“What is she doing here?!”

The Elves gasped in shock when they recognized the majestic Crane in the sky. Everyone in the Silvermoon Continent knew who this crane was because she was the Beast Companion of their one and only Saintess.

She was none other than the Royal Silvermoon Crane that was known to make even Dragons cower in fear.

Skyla glared hatefully at Elandorr who had tried to kill William by summoning a Millennial Beast. Although she was gentle by nature, she was more dangerous than an Elder Dragon when someone tried to hurt the people that were important to her.

Right now, she was looking at the young Elven Commander filled with killing intent.

She didn’t care if it was a Human, Dragon, or Elf. Anyone who dared to touch one of her reverse scales had only one fate and that was… Death!
