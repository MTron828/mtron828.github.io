Chapter 419: Princess Sidonie’s and Morgana’s Versions Of Love [Part 2]

“Very well. Send the Crown Prince to me and I will turn a blind eye on our grievances of the past,” Princess Sidonie replied. “As for your proposal for an alliance… that will depend on what he will think.”

Conner frowned. “He?”

“Yes.” Princess Sidonie. “My… acquaintance. Are you familiar with the young Knight Commander, Sir William Von Ainsworth?”

Conner remembered Calum’s report that he had seen William and the Princess together at Antheilm. Based on his subordinate’s report, it seemed that the two of them had a good relationship with each other.

As to what the extent of their relationship was, Calum didn’t know. However, the Princess’ attitude towards the boy made him think that they were close to each other.

“What about him?” Conner inquired. “Is he perhaps your lover?”

Conner asked his last question in a teasing tone, but to his surprise, the Princess’ smile stiffened when she heard his words. However, Princess Sidonie quickly regained her composure and answered his question.

“Sir William and I have a Non-Aggression Pact,” Princes Sidonie replied. “If you form an alliance with him then I will not step foot on the borders of the Hellan Kingdom.”

“Oh?” Conner raised an eyebrow.

He had a deal with Celine that he wouldn’t touch the Half-Elf if she didn’t turn on them. So far, Celine had kept her distance and hadn’t involved herself in the affairs of The Organization. Although she didn’t help them with the Continental Spell, she didn’t get in their way either.

Celine was an important asset to their Organization and, if possible, Conner wanted to keep it that way.

“I’ll consider it,” Conner stated after careful consideration. “I will send the Crown Prince to you shortly. I’ll even throw his brother, Prince Rufus, in as a freebie. In return, please spare my subordinates and let them return to my side. I will also send additional compensation when we deliver the two Princes to you, Your Highness.”

Princess Sidonie nodded her head. “Very well. I will spare your men. Also, as a sign of good faith, I will also not attack the Hellan Kingdom for two months. Naturally, if you can convince Sir William to ally with you then we can form a Non-Aggression Pact indefinitely.”

Princess Sidonie then gave Conner a smile sweet enough to rot his teeth.

“Thank you for your mercy, Your Highness.” Conner gave a brief bow. “I will try to reach out to Sir William and negotiate with him.”

“Good. I’ll keep this communication stone, so tell me when you have succeeded in convincing him.”

“Very well.”

Princess Sidonie gave Conner a playful wink before cutting off the connection.

Conner released a long deep sigh after his conversation with Princess Sidonie ended. With this, he had secured the lives of his men. Also, if he could prevent the Kraetor Empire from attacking the Hellan Kingdom, he could focus all of his attention on the Elves that he hated the most.

“William Von Ainsworth,” Conner muttered as he activated a different ring in his hand. This ring allowed him to communicate with Calum who was currently stationed at their Headquarters.

He ordered him to send men to William’s hometown, Lont, to look for his whereabouts. He added that if he was not there, they should look for Celine and ask her if she knew where her Disciple was.

Conner also didn’t hide anything from his most trusted subordinate and told him about his conversation with the Princess. Calum listened patiently and waited for Conner to finish before giving a suggestion.

“Sir, I think that we should ask Celine to act as an intermediary to have a dialogue with the boy,” Calum proposed. “This way, our chances of convincing him will be higher.”

Conner pondered for a while as he eyed his right-hand man with approval. It was indeed a good proposal, however, there was one thing that might hinder the negotiation from pushing through.

‘We don’t know how the boy will react if he finds out that we are the ones responsible for turning the adults into crystal statues,’ Conner thought. ‘Also, I don’t think Celine wants him to know that she is a member of The Organization.’

A sinister smile appeared on Conner’s face as he thought about what William’s reaction would be when he discovered that his Master was one of the members of The Organization that had turned the continent upside down.

Conner was faced with another choice. Should he look for William without consulting Celine and use the fact that the Half-Elf’s Master was a member of The Organization to coerce him to join their ranks?

Or, should he just let Celine talk to the boy in their stead? Either way, the boy and his Master would have a falling out, which would be beneficial to their Organization.

“For now, search for the boy’s whereabouts without looking for Celine,” Conner ordered. “If you don’t find him within a week, send some men to Lont and let them look for her.”

“Understood.” Calum nodded in understanding.

Although he had concerns in regards to Berthold being part of the Kraetor Army, he didn’t give him too much importance. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As leaders of the Organization, Conner knew more than anyone else that Berthold didn’t hold the final say in the Kraetor Army. As long as the Princess was on his side, the leader of the Organization stationed in the Kraetor Empire couldn’t do anything reckless that might jeopardize his position.

Conner wanted to exploit the Princess to prevent Berthold from making moves against him. For him, this was the perfect plan to lower the number of enemies that he had to fight in the future.

Princess Sidonie giggled as she placed the communication crystal inside her storage ring. Several young knights of the Kraetor Empire stood around her in a daze as they waited for her orders.

Prince Jason felt the danger of being around his Cousin and stayed far away from her reach. He had already thought of forming a close relationship with her, with the intention of asking for her hand in marriage.

However, he didn’t intend to become one of her mindless slaves that would cater to her every whim. Prince Jason glanced at Princess Sidonie from afar and felt the blood boil in his veins. He had already conquered the hearts of many women in the Kraetor Empire and had enjoyed their affection and their bodies.

Still, Princess Sidonie’s allure was too strong for him to resist.

‘I want to conquer her,’ Prince Jason thought. ‘I want to pin her down on my bed and hear her beg for me to shower her with my love and affection.’

Prince Jason had done this numerous times in the past. His feelings for Princess Sidonie soared as he licked his lips in anticipation.

It was quite unfortunate that the moment he laid his eyes on the Princess, the power of Lust had already seeped deep inside his heart.

Even though he was wearing protective artifacts to prevent himself from being fully Charmed by Princess Sidonie’s power, they were unable to stop the subtle workings of the power of Lust in the young Commander’s state of mind.

As one of the Seven Deadly Sins that stood at the Apex, Lust was the most primitive power of all. Under Princess Sidonie’s gaze, even the most disciplined and proud Monks, who practiced celibacy, would perform the most depraved carnal acts in order to win her smile.

Feeling Prince Jason’s fiery gaze, the Princess turned her head to look at him. Deep inside her Mindscape, Morgana was laughing her heart out.

“Darling, you will regret turning us down,” Morgana said after laughing. “You should have just accepted our love back then. If you had, you would have already been the Emperor of this Continent. Still… it is more interesting this way, isn’t that right, Sidonie?”

Princess Sidonie nodded her head as she hugged her other half. “It’s strange. This feeling of wanting to conquer someone, I’ve never felt this feeling before.”

“Good.” Morgana returned Sidonie’s hug and kissed her lips. “Let’s compromise. I’ll let you have Darling first then I’ll have him give birth to our babies at a later time.”

Princess Sidonie smiled. The image of the handsome Half-Elf, kneeling in front of her while licking her feet, awoke the sadistic nature that was sleeping deep inside her.

“I look forward to that day, Big Sister,” Princess Sidonie cupped the side of Morgana’s face. “Please, do your best to make our Prince… love us with all of his heart.”

“I will,” Morgana said as her eyes glowed with power. She, too, couldn’t wait to get her hands on William. The thrill of conquering the arrogant, and narcissistic Half-Elf made Morgana’s Lustful Heart… skip a beat.
