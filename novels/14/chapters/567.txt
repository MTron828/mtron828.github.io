Chapter 567: Trial Of Dominion [Part 2]

The Goblin Paladin and the Dark Goblin Warmonger faced each other.

William and the Goblin Army stood far away from both combatants in order to not get in the way of their battle.

The Dark Goblin Warmonger was a meter taller than The Goblin Paladin and looked more intimidating. However, Jareth’s holy presence wasn’t something that could be ignored either.

Both fighters had taken their fighting stance and circled each other. At the blink of an eye, both Goblins clashed against each other, making the ground under their feet burst apart. A second later, Jareth jumped to the side and evaded The Goblin Warmonger’s follow up attack.

After the initial clash, Jareth realized that the Goblin Warmonger was stronger than him in regards to body strength. Although the Goblin’s Paladin’s rank was higher than his opponent, he was an all rounder.

The Dark Goblin Warmonger, on the other hand, was a creature that specialized in physical strength. This gave it an upper hand in their initial clash.

Emboldened that it was stronger than its enemy, the Goblin Warmonger unleashed a flurry of blows that forced Jareth to dodge and keep his distance.

Seeing that their champion had the advantage, the goblins raised their weapons and cheered. Xerxes, Sharx, and Rex, also started to cheer for Jareth. They had full confidence in him for he was the strongest Goblin in their ranks.

After a minute of dodging, Jareth suddenly took the initiative to close the distance, and used his shield to bash the body of his opponent, breaking the Goblin Warmonger’s momentum.

This attack caught his enemy by surprise, and was unable to regain his balance right away. Jareth didn’t miss this opportunity and thrust his sword towards his opponent’s chest to claim his victory.

However, something unexpected happened.

Sensing that its life was in danger, the Goblin Warmonger immediately activated its Titan Form, increasing its body size instantly.

Jareth’s sword pierced through the Titan’s knees, missing the opportunity to end its opponent’s life.

The Goblin Warmonger roared and kicked its opponent away with the intention of breaking all of Jareth’s bones.

Unfazed by this sudden change of events, Jareth used his Supernatural Mobility to blink behind his opponent, and slashed the Goblin Warmonger’s calves.

‘Too shallow,’ William thought as he observed the battle from afar.

Just like he thought, Jareth’s attack was only able to deal a flesh wound to his opponent. The Goblin paladin hastily backed away because it realized that its current tactics won’t work against its oversized opponent.

‘I’ve never seen a Goblin as smart as this one.’ The Guardian rubbed his chin in appreciation. ‘I want to add him to my collection.’

The enraged Goblin Warmonger ran towards The Goblin Paladin with the intention of stomping him to death.

Thanks to his Supernatural Mobility, Jareth was able to evade these frenzied attacks. The Goblin Paladin distanced himself from his enemy, while gathering the energy in his surroundings to deliver a lethal blow to its adversary.

William didn’t expect that he would be able to witness this kind of battle against two combatants, whose power levels had been downgraded to the bare minimum.

The blue sword in Jareth’s hand glowed brightly. Light extended from its tip, forming a longer blade that shone brightly, amidst the dark-red sky that loomed over their heads.

“Rise at the face of Adversity,” Jareth shouted as he pulled back his sword, just like a baseball bat preparing to be swung. “,and overwhelm all opposition! Laugh for me! Joyeuse!”

(A/N: I translated it to make things easier for everyone. No need to thank me *wink wink*)

Jareth released the shield in his hand and held his sword, Joyeuse, with both hands. A humming sound reverberated in the battlefield as the blade of light extended several meters in length.

The Goblin Paladin then swung it with all of its might at the approaching Titan, whose weapon was ready to meet his blow.

A blinding flash of light illuminated the surroundings when the two weapons clashed, which forced everyone to cover their eyes.

Only the Guardian of Genesis didn’t avert his gaze to see the final conclusion of the battle. Within that white world, the giant war axe was split in two. Joyeuse went past the Goblin Warmonger’s body, drawing the conclusion to the battle.

‘Good!’ the Guardian grinned happily at the wonderful display that the Goblin Paladin had shown in battle. However, the grin on his face disappeared when he noticed something unexpected.

The white world receded, and William once again opened his eyes. The Dark Goblin Warmonger had returned to its normal size and laid face down on the ground.

Jareth, on the other hand, stood straight and tall with its cape fluttering in the wind. His blue sword had already regained its normal form. A soft hum was heard in the wind. It was as if the Joyeuse was saying that it had enjoyed the battle that had transpired.

The Goblin Paladin faced the million strong Goblin Army and raised his word up high. A few seconds later, a resounding cheer spread across the trial floor as the Goblins swore their allegiance to their new leader.

“Why?”

A hoarse sound reached Jareth’s ears. The Goblin Paladin glanced at the Goblin Warmonger that was still lying on the ground. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Why didn’t you kill me?” the Goblin Warmonger asked.

The Goblin Paladin sheathed his weapon before walking towards his fallen adversary.

“I didn’t kill you because I admire your strength,” Jareth said. “If possible, I want to fight side by side with you on the battlefield.”

“You will regret this. When I recover my strength, I will challenge you again. This time, the victor will be me.”

“Go ahead. Challenge me as many times as you want. The result will still be the same.”

The Goblin Warmonger raised its head to look at the Goblin Paladin that had knelt beside him.

“Where is your confidence coming from?” the Goblin Warmonger asked as it forced itself to try to stand. However, due to its injuries, it wasn’t able to lift its body from the ground.

Jareth extended his hand to help as a gesture of friendship. The Goblin Warmonger looked at his hand for a moment before firmly grabbing it with its own hand.

The Goblin Paladin smiled, while pulling his new comrade to stand by his side.

“You ask where my confidence is coming from, right?” Jareth asked. “My confidence lies in him.”

The Goblin Paladin’s gaze landed on the red-headed teenager who had a confident smile on his face.

“I see,” the Goblin Warmonger replied. “Fine. Let me see if this confidence of yours will stand the test of time. When that confidence of yours wanes, it will be my time to make you my subordinate.”

Jareth didn’t reply, and simply nodded his head. Deep inside, the Goblin Paladin was smiling evilly. He was looking forward to seeing the expression of his new comrade at arms when the latter discovered the forces under William’s command.

By then, all the doubts in the Goblin Warmonger’s mind would disappear. Perhaps, it would even become his rival, in getting the good graces of the Half-Elf that had a penchant for attracting all kinds of troubles that came his way.
