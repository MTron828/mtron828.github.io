Chapter 514: William’s First Day At Silverwind Academy

“Good morning everyone, my name is William Von Ainsworth,” William introduced himself to his new classmates. “I hope to get along with everyone till this year is over.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The girls in the class looked at William with curious gazes, while the guys looked at him as if he was their rival in love.

“Greetings, my name is Ian Dy Moxie,” Ian said with a smile. “I am Sir William’s retainer. I hope to get along with everyone as well.”

“Tsk, two good looking transfer students. How are we supposed to get ourselves some beautiful girls if they are around?”

“I know, right. They should have gone to the other classes, but why were they placed in Class A? Are they that good?”

“Hmp! I know the names of all the nobles in our Empire, and I don’t remember any noble household with the surname Ainsworth. He must be an upstart.”

“Maybe he used some connections to get in?”

“That’s possible. Just look at his face. Maybe he is one of the female professors’ pets.”

The murmur grew louder and the Homeroom Professor of Class A cleared her throat, which made all the students shut their mouth and focus their attention on her.

“Sir William, please take that seat at the far right on the back row,” Rita Geiss, the homeroom professor of Class A said with a smile. “Since it’s a three seater, Sir Moxie can also share the seat with you.”

William nodded and thanked Professor Rita. He then walked towards the back of the Class and sat in the seat that was assigned to them.

Ian sat beside him and acted as a proper retainer to a noble heir. She had been trained since young to become Est’s retainer, so it wasn’t hard for her to play her part perfectly.

Just like William, several of the nobles also had their retainers inside the classroom. Some of them stood outside the room, while those of similar age to their masters stood in the back corners of the room as they watched over their masters.

“Will you look at that,” a teenage boy wearing glasses smirked. “An upstart and his retainer are seated side by side. Don’t they even know the etiquette of nobles?”

“That is why he is an upstart,” a Chubby boy chuckled. “Seriously, he doesn’t even understand the hierarchy of subordinates and their master.”

Ian frowned. She didn’t want to stand out, so she decided to go with the flow and stand in the corner of the room, where the other retainers were staying.

(A/N: From this moment onwards, I will refer to Ian as she. Don’t get confused by the pronouns. Only I am allowed to get confused by it xD!)

However, before she could even stand from her seat, a hand held her waist, preventing her from standing up. Ian looked at William in askance, and the latter just shook his head.

“You don’t need to listen to these little pricks,” William said. “Since I am your employer, you will only follow my orders. I order you to sit and attend class with me. Do you understand?”

Ian smiled and nodded her head. “Yes, Young Master.”

Ian had forgotten that William could be adamant when it came to things that were important to him. This made her feel warm inside her chest, because her lover didn’t want to treat her like a retainer, like the rest of the nobles in the Kraetor Empire did.

Of course, although she thought this way, she also knew that the Kraetor Empire was different from the Hellan Kingdom. There were certain rules that they needed to follow in order to prevent themselves from getting ostracized by the nobles of the empire.

The guys who heard William’s words raised their eyebrows, while the girls looked at him with weird expressions on their faces.

Although what William was doing wasn’t uncommon, very few had the guts to call the noble heirs of the Kraetor Empire little pricks.

“Wow, this plebeian is a feisty one,” the chubby boy remarked as he looked at William with a mischievous smile.

“This just proves that he’s an upstart.” the teenage boy shook his head in disdain. “Don’t worry. He will soon understand the error of his ways.”

The boys inside the classroom exchanged glances and nodded their heads in agreement. They had singled William out and decided to teach the transfer student a lesson when the professors were not around.

Professor Rita turned a blindeye on what was happening inside their classroom, because she was also looking forward to seeing how William would deal with his classmates.

The Kraetor Empire encouraged rivalry and competition because they were a nation of warriors. The Emperor would watch over these promising students and pick the best among them to be trained and to serve in important posts when they graduated from Silverwind Academy.

Just as Professor Rita was about to start class, the door of the classroom opened.

“Sorry, I’m late, Professor,” a beautiful lady, with long reddish brown hair and hazel eyes, said with a smile.

The newcomer then scanned the room until her eyes landed on the red-headed teenager that was looking outside the window. She was very tempted to go to his seat, but as a member of the Royal Family, she needed to show restraint.

Everyone in the room sucked in deep breaths as they laid their eyes on the sensuous beauty in front of them. Men and women couldn’t help themselves from staring at her face, which made them unable to take their eyes off of her.

“My name is Sidonie Val Freesia,” Princess Sidonie introduced herself. “Starting today, I will be your classmate. I pray that all of you will take good care of me for the rest of the year. Thank you.”

“… I think I’m in love.”

“I call dibs on her.”

“In your dreams. Do you think you stand a chance with your pig face?”

“Hah… this is the first time I’ve seen such beauty. Just where did this lady hide all these years? I need to ask my father to arrange a meeting with her family.”

It was not only the men that had been charmed by Sidonie’s presence, even the girls were looking at her as if they had seen their idol.

Princess Sidonie’s smile made their faces redden, and some of the girls even wanted to stand up and call her My Lady, even though they were nobles of the Empire.

“Princess Sidonie, it is an honor to finally meet you,” Professor Rita bowed respectfully. “You may sit anywhere that you please. I’m sure that your classmates will do their best to help you in any way that they can.”

“P-Princess?!”

“I knew it! Such a beauty couldn’t be someone ordinary.”

“The moment she stepped in, I already felt her royal bearing. This must be fate. The two of us were fated to be together.”

“… Didn’t I tell you to stop daydreaming? Next time, please, buy a mirror. Perhaps that will wake you up from your delusion.”

The class became rowdy due to Princess Sidonie’s appearance. William kept looking outside the window and didn’t dare to look in her direction.

Seeing that the Half-Elf was purposely ignoring her, the corner of Princess Sidonie’s lips curled up into a smirk as she walked towards the back of the classroom. Ashe was seated on William’s left, so the Princess mischievously sat on his right.

However, it didn’t end there.

Princess Sidonie moved closer to William and gave him a kiss on the cheek, which made everyone freeze in place, including the Half-Elf that had just received Princess Sidonie’s kiss.

Moments later, chaos erupted inside the classroom. Professor Rita had no choice but to step in and stop the ruckus because the noise might disturb the other classes. If that were to happen, it would reflect badly on her as a professor and she didn’t want that to happen.

“Morgana, you are really making things difficult for me from the get go,” William whispered as he held the naughty girl’s hand from under the desk. “Can you behave and not stir up trouble? Switch with Sidonie for now.”

William had grown used to Princess Sidonie’s other half, who would always pounce on him whenever she managed to take control of the princess’ body.

“I’ll think about it if you kiss me,” Morgana replied with a mischievous smile.

“Later.”

“No. I want it now.”

William sighed as he gave the naughty girl a quick peck on the cheek before telling her to behave.

Morgana knew that William had already compromised, so she decided to just rest her head on his shoulder before closing her eyes. If one were to look at her, they would only see happiness and contentment on her face.

Ian, who was seated beside the two, rubbed her temple. She had already accepted Princess Sidonie and Morgana as William’s lover. However, she was still not used to Morgana’s antics whenever she was around.

Sometimes, even she was embarrassed by how bold, and open, Princess Sidonie’s other half acted. Part of her also admired Morgana because she didn’t have the guts to do half of what she was capable of doing.

‘I guess Sidonie will bury herself in a hole later,’ Ian sighed internally. ‘I almost feel sorry for her.’

Princess Sidonie was currently sleeping inside her and Morgana’s mindscape. She had been up all night dealing with important matters with the Anaesha Dynasty. A letter had arrived from her little brother, Carl, asking for advice on what to do with certain issues that had sprung up under his rule.

The doting princess stayed up all night as she wrote proposals and solutions to the problems that her little brother was facing. These letters would be sent via courier to the Southern Continent, in order to help her brother solidify his rule as Emperor.

Before she slept, she repeatedly told Morgana to conduct herself properly as a Princess of the Royal Family. Morgana promised that she would do her best, so the tired Princess reluctantly relinquished control over her body and went to sleep.

If only she knew that Morgana would create a scandal on the very first day of class, she would have attended even though she was dead tired.

This was how William’s first day started inside the most prestigious academy in the Kraetor Empire.

Because of Morgana’s little fiasco, William had not only become Class A’s Public Enemy Number One, but the public enemy of the entire Third Year Division inside Silverwind Academy.

This brought him unwarranted attention and scorn from all the influential nobles of the Empire.

A place where all the influential heirs gathered, and competed with each other in order to make their mark in the annals of history, and to gain the favor of Emperor Leonidas.

An Emperor who was given the title, The Emperor Who Stands Above The Clouds.
