Chapter 464: If Only It Were True

While the Half-Elf was chuckling in his temporary residence, the Elves all had serious expressions on their faces.

Naturally, they all came in the Anaesha Dynasty with a plan and had already arranged the tribute that they were planning to give the Young Empress in order to gain her cooperation.

However, William’s appearance was completely unexpected and had derailed their plans. What was more depressing was that their Guardian Beast, Eneru, had been taken captive by one of the Protectors of the Kraetor Empire.

This blow hit the Elves very hard. Although Empress Sidonie had promised them that the Qilin would be released, it made them realize that they were really at a disadvantage in the negotiations.

Alessio, too, had a frown on his face as he looked at the members of their delegation. He could still remember the hidden laughter in Berthold’s eyes when they left the throne room. Clearly, his counterpart was enjoying Alessio’s hardship, making the Elf feel extremely irritated.

“I’m afraid we didn’t bring enough resources to use as bribes for an alliance,” Alessio said after looking at the list that they had prepared beforehand. “If the son of the Saintess can offer the Human Empress a better deal then we will have no choice but to brace ourselves for an attack on two sides.”

Elandorr’s frown deepened because he was in agreement with Alessio’s statement. If only they were able to retrieve the treasures in the treasury of the Zelan Dynasty then things would have been different.

Unfortunately, the treasury of the Zelan Dynasty was not inside the city of Briar Glen, or in any other human cities for that matter.

Since the kingdom was founded, the Treasury of the Zelan Royal Family had always been kept inside the Sanctuary of the Minotaur Race. This was why the previous, and current rulers of the Dynasty weren’t worried that their treasure would be stolen from them.

After all, who had the courage to rob the Domain of a Myriad Beast?

“Do you think they will settle for oral promises?” Elandorr inquired.

Alessio firmly shook his head. “Oral promises are useless. At most, they will settle for a written contract signed by both parties. However, this will not be an ordinary contract. They might use a powerful enchantment to bind us into adhering to the conditions listed on it. If we break it then we might suffer dire repercussions.”

Elandorr pondered before giving another proposal.

“Isn’t a marriage alliance a very Human thing to do? How about we do that?” Elandorr proposed.

“Marriage alliances between two nations only happen between Royal Families,” Alessio replied. “You might be a high-ranking officer of this expedition, but your Rank is nothing compared to the influence of the Royal Bloodline.”

Alessio had already seen the subtle changes in Elandorr’s stance towards the Human Empress and it made him very wary. Although he was confident that the artifacts in their possession had prevented them from being Charmed, he could see that the human-hating Elandorr seemed to have other ideas about the Beautiful Empress who had complete control of the negotiations.

“Or, are you perhaps saying that we should marry, Her Highness, Princess Eowyn, to one of the Princes of the Kraetor Empire?” Alessio asked back with a serious expression. “I believe that the man that led the Kraetor Army in this expedition was a teenager named Prince Jason. Do you want to match the Princess with that Barbarian?”

“How absurd!” Elandorr immediately rejected the idea. “Our Princess is too noble to become the bride of a filthy, Human Prince. I will never allow it to happen.”

Alession gave Elandorr the ‘then why did you propose a marriage alliance?’ glare, but he didn’t voice his thoughts out loud.

The oldest among the Elven Delegation knew that now was not the right time for dissension in their own ranks. What they needed to do was to find a way on how to make the alliance work. If not, they would settle for a Non-Aggression Pact that would keep the Kraetor Army away from the newly acquired Elven Lands.

An awkward silence fell upon the room as all the Elves pondered on their next course of action. Their meeting lasted for two more hours before they reached a compromise.

——

An hour before midnight…

William laid on the comfortable bed and slept. Earlier, he was very tempted to return to the Thousand Beast Domain to sleep in his lovers’ embrace. However, he didn’t do that because he felt that he was constantly being watched.

Although the System hadn’t detected any anomalies, William trusted his guts, so he decided to play it safe and remain inside the room, and not expose the Domain that belonged to him.

The experience with Cernunnos, when the latter had trespassed in his Domain without permission, had left a lasting impression on William. He didn’t want the same thing to happen, especially since he was in enemy territory.

While the Half-Elf was currently dreaming of Asgard, the bookcase in his room moved to the side, revealing a hidden pathway.

Empress Sidonie emerged from it wearing a one-piece night gown, and stealthily walked towards the bed where the boy was sleeping.

Actually, the Young Empress was already in deep sleep. The events of the day had mentally exhausted her. Because of this, her naughty other half, took over her body and decided to give William a night visit.

Morgana had unleashed the power of dreams, to keep her beloved Half-Elf in the dreamworld, and prevent him from waking up in reality.

When she was sure that her power was in full effect, she softly brushed William’s smooth and silky hair, before kissing his rough hands that were used to wielding weapons and doing hard labor.

She also kissed his ears, cheeks, and even his nose.

‘I love everything about you, Darling,’ Morgana thought as she gazed down at William who was sleeping peacefully.

Her soft, and delicate finger traced his lips, but she didn’t dare to kiss them. She was afraid that if she gave in to her desires, she wouldn’t be able to stop herself. Also, it might break the dream spell that she had cast and wake the Half-Elf prematurely.

‘If not for Sidonie, I would have already eaten you up,’ Morgana pouted as she laid beside William, pressing her body on him, and sharing his warmth.

Suddenly, a thought appeared in her head. She blinked once then twice before a mischievous smile took shape on her sensuous face.

She grabbed hold of William’s hand and guided it towards her…

-

Sidonie opened her eyes and stared dreamily at the space in front of her. Last night, she had a good dream. She dreamed that she was sharing a bed with William and the two of them were sharing a night of passion.

All her sleepiness melted away as the images from her dream appeared to her one by one. The Young Empress blushed when she recalled a particular scene when William’s hand…

‘No good,’ Empress Sidonie thought as she felt her body heat up due to the sensuous dream that she had last night.

She reluctantly rose up from the bed, and headed towards the bathroom. The Young Empress still had to meet her Beloved as well as the Elven Delegation in a few hours, in order to hear their proposals.

‘If only it were true,’ Empress Sidonie thought as her left hand touched her chest, while the right hand moved downwards, stopping over her maidenhood.

She needed to quench the heat that had taken control of her body. The Young Empress was unaware that her other half was sleeping with a satisfied smile on her face, within their shared mindscape.

Dreaming of a wonderful dream, where her desires… had partly been fulfilled.
