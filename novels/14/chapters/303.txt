Chapter 303: Lily’s Lollipop [Part 2]

“Just like the lollipops in your world, Big Brother, my Lollipop comes in different colors as well,” Lily tapped the whiteboard with her wooden stick as she continued her explanation.

“The Red Lollipop serves as a healing potion, while the Blue Lollipop is similar to a mana potion.”

Lily had a teasing smile on her face as she watched William’s expression change the moment she explained the effects of each Lollipop that William could create using her Divinity.

After her explanation, she raised her chin arrogantly and placed both of her hands on her waist.

“Now, do you see how powerful my Divinity is, Big Brother? I bet you didn’t expect that it wouldn’t lose to Issei’s King’s Legion.”

“You’re right, Lily. I think I will never look at a Lollipop the same way again.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ufufufu. It’s quite unfortunate that you are not my follower, Big Brother. If you were, you could easily rule the world by using the High-Tier Specs of my Lollipops.” Lily bragged. “Do you regret not making me your Patron God?”

William scratched his cheek, but didn’t reply to Lily’s inquiry. He knew that the Loli Goddess was just teasing him. Although Lily’s Divinity far exceeded his expectations, he didn’t regret choosing Gavin as his Patron God.

Afterall, the life he had right now wouldn’t be the same without Gavin’s Blessing.

After Lily’s explanation, William was now aware that he could create eleven different Lollipops with different abilities.

Red - Health Potion

Basically, Lily’s Lollipops are one time consumables. Also, there is a limit to the number of Lollipops that William could create.

With the exception of the Pink Lollipop, William could only create fifty of each type of Lollipop per day. The great thing about it was that they didn’t require Magic or Spirit Power to make.

After gaining Ashe’s Spirit Core, and the Spirit Energy from the Underground Lake, William’s body gained the ability to use Spirit Power.

Spirit Power is also called Prana. Unlike Magicians who use the power within their bodies to cast spells, Spirit Power is the power to harness the energy within their surroundings.

Of course, with William’s Spiritual World in shambles, he could only use Spirit Magic sparingly. Even so, this was a great boon for him. Being able to use Spirit Power allowed him to unlock Job Classes that relied heavily on Prana, rather than Mana.

What William didn’t know was that Issei, Lily, and David planned on helping William unlock more Job Classes during his stay in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods.

How were they going to do that? Very simple!

All they needed to do was talk to their friends and allow William to hold any of their artifacts. This would allow William to unlock Job Classes and even Prestige Classes without needing to buy items in the God Shop.

It was similar to the saying “Hitting Ten Thousand Birds using a single stone!”

Lily crossed her arms over her chest and smiled. “Now that you know the different colors and abilities of the Lollipops that you can create, why don’t you give it a try, Big Brother?”

“Okay.” William rubbed his hands together as he tried to create a Red Lollipop for the first time.

After entering Lily’s Special Domain, his body had returned to being the Pink Teddy Bear that she always carried around in her backpack.

William focused his concentration on his hand as he activated Lily’s Divinity within his body. However, instead of a Red Lollipop, what appeared in his paws was a Pink one.

‘Um?’ William scratched his head in confusion. ‘Should I also say the words Red Lollipop to make my intentions known? Okay. let’s try it again!’

William handed the Pink Lollipop to Lily before trying again. The Loli Goddess placed the Lollipop inside her mouth as she looked at William with a mysterious smile.

Although she explained the different abilities of each Lollipop, she didn’t tell William the method of creating them. She didn’t do this to make things difficult for William, Lily had already broken a few rules by divulging the secrets of her Divinity to someone who was not her follower.

If she spoonfed William and told him how to use her Divinity effectively, she would suffer a backlash like Gavin had. This was something that she didn’t want to happen because her other followers needed her guidance in their times of need as well.

‘Don’t worry, Little Will,’ Lily thought. ‘A year inside my domain is equivalent to a day in Hestia. You have plenty of time to discover how to use my Divinity.’

The Loli Goddess watched as William created a dozen more Pink Lollipops, while attempting to make a Red one. Lily sat on a chair and watched with amusement as the Pink Teddy Bear waved the lollipops in his hand in frustration.

William didn’t expect that making the Lollipop he had in mind was difficult. However, he had gotten used to hardships during the harsh training he had done in the past. Lily had already told him that the effects of the Lollipops could be upgraded if he met the necessary requirements.

Right now, the power of William’s Lollipops were equivalent to Low-Tier Spells. However, he could still upgrade them with the help of Alchemy, which would make their effects extremely potent.

Another great advantage of the Lollipops was that they weren’t limited to William’s use only. Anyone could carry them around and use them at an appropriate time to deal with every situation.

For people that didn’t have any magic powers, William’s lollipops would be like consumable magic scrolls for one time use. The Half-Elf had already decided that he would arm his subordinates with his lollipops that would serve as the hidden aces in their sleeves.

That way, everyone in the Martial Class would be able to use them even though they didn’t have any magic powers inside their bodies.
