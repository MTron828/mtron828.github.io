Chapter 258: The Ending Of A Fairy Tale [Part 3]

When William’s back disappeared from view, the sales lady giggled as she leaned back on her chair.

“Looks like I won the bet, so what will you do, young lady?” the sales lady asked.

Belle walked out from behind the stall and looked in the direction where William ran. She bit her lip as she thought of the last words that she had said to him a while ago. She felt guilty and embarrassed because she tried to use William’s promise to bind him to her.

The sales lady presented a small box to Belle and opened it.

“All I need as payment is a promise,” the sales lady said. “The choice is yours to make.”

William stopped at the gate of the residence panting for breath. He had run all the way from the temple only to arrive as soon as he could. However, when he asked the guard if Belle had returned, the latter said that the Young Lady was still not inside the residence.

William didn’t believe him and entered the house to look for Belle. It didn’t take long for him to realize that the guard didn’t lie to him and hurriedly went out to look for her.

He ran back to the temple but the girl he was searching for wasn’t there. William looked everywhere, but still couldn’t find her. In the end, William walked dejectedly to the place where they first met.

William stood in the middle of the flowerfield as he looked at the stars in the sky. All it would take was for him to select “Yes”, and the pain and suffering would end.

However, he didn’t do that. There were things that he couldn’t leave behind. He couldn’t be selfish. There were people who were waiting for his return.

“I just want to see you one last time,” William said softly.

It was at that moment when something exploded in the sky and a beautiful golden flower appeared in the darkness. Soon, several more fireworks painted the darkness with an array of colors.

William watched them silently. The fireworks display lasted for five minutes before coming to an end. The fleeting beauty disappeared and the sky once again was bathed in darkness.

Suddenly, a pair of slender arms hugged him from behind. William looked up to see a beautiful face right next to him.

Belle lowered her head and planted a soft kiss on William’s lips. When the kiss ended, William faced her and wrapped his arms around her. He then stood on tiptoe to kiss the girl he had loved for many years.

The two kissed, and kissed, and kissed until they ran out of breath.

“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said those words to you,” Belle said. “I was being selfish.”

William buried his face on her chest and listened to her heartbeat. “Belle, I love you. Always have, always will. Now and forever.”

Belle hugged him and kissed his head lovingly. “So you say, but you have so many girls waiting for you back in that Fantasy world of yours. I’m sure that you will forget about me soon.”

“I will not,” William said firmly. “For the past fourteen years of my life, I have always kept you in my heart.”

Belle felt something warm spread on her chest when she heard that William had always kept her in his heart, even though he was living a new life in another world.

“You know it’s funny,” Belle said as she brushed William’s head. “You spent fourteen years in that world, while here, only a year has passed. Well, I’m not going to complain. At least you didn’t find an old hag when you returned. That would be the worst.”

William reluctantly pulled back from Belle’s warmth and softness and looked straight into her eyes. He then took out a ring from his pocket and gently placed it on her ring finger.

“Belle, for me, You are the beginning of a letter, the contents of a poem, the ending of a Fairytale,” William said after he finished putting the ring on Belle’s finger. “I don’t know what the future holds, but I will do my best to find you.”

Once again, William rose on tiptoe to kiss the woman he loved. He couldn’t get enough of kissing her and wished that he had more time. If he could only pause the annoying timer on his status page he would have paid 1 Million God Points to do it!

After their short, love-filled kiss ended, Belle took out a ring from her own pocket and placed it on William’s ring finger.

William’s eyes widened in shock as he looked at the ring on his finger. He then looked at Belle anxiously because he understood the meaning of her gesture.

“Don’t worry, it’s not as bad as you think.” Belle ruffled William’s hair. “Do your best to find me because if you can’t do that, I will have no choice but to find you.”

“Let us make some ground rules before you return to your world,” Belle said with a serious expression. “If you marry dozens of wives I will castrate you.”

“Okay,” William replied. “I didn’t intend to have dozens of wives in the first place.”

“You can marry nine people. Whether they are wives or concubines, I don’t care. However, you are not allowed to have more than nine.” Belle stated. “If you surpass that number, you’d better not show yourself to me, or I’ll make sure to fight you to the death. Do I make myself clear?”

“Yes ma’am,” William nodded his head like a henpecked husband. “But, why does the number amount to nine?”

“Because it is the… nevermind! Just make sure that you don’t surpass that number, or I will hate you for life!”

“Okay. I promise.”

“You don’t have much time left,” Belle cupped William’s face. “Let’s not waste it.”

“Mmm.” William agreed with her wholeheartedly as he raised his head.

Their lips once again pressed against each other as they savored their last kiss together.

“I love you, Belle.”

“I love you too, Will.”

“See you later.”

“See you soon. Also, that girl, Wendy. Treat her well.”

“I will. I promise.”

William’s body glowed and slowly turned into particles of light. The light flew towards the sky and bathed Belle with its golden light.

When the light finally receded, Belle knelt on the ground and covered her face with her hands. Her pained sobs echoed in the quiet night, for her star-crossed lover was no longer in her sight.
