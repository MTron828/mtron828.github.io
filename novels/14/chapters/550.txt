Chapter 550: Devourer’s Gauntlets

Two days after William had dealt with Dickie and his mercenary group…

“Finally it’s completed,” William wiped the sweat on his forehead as he looked at his latest creation.

Two silver-gilded, black gauntlets glowed faintly in front of William. Its main body was made from Adamantium, and Mithril, so its durability and ability to synchronize with its wielder’s magic power was guaranteed.

William felt that his current skill was insufficient to create a near-replica of a Pseudo-Legendary Weapon, so he decided not to push himself, and just make an Exotic Grade Weapon that is well within the limit of his capabilities.

After studying the recipe of Titania’s Gauntlet, the Half-Elf decided to tweak it. Since he didn’t know how the jewels with elemental properties worked with Titania’s Gauntlet, he altered its performance, so that his own elemental powers would work in it.

“Now that the body is made, it’s time to create the jewels for it,” William muttered as he clicked the Job Advance Job Class for the Blacksmith Job Class. “System, change my Job Class to Artificer.”

[ Ding! ]

[ Blacksmith has been successfully upgraded to Artificer! ]

-

Unlike the other Job Classes, a Blacksmith could branch out to different areas of specialties. Since William could freely change his Job Class, it didn’t matter if he chose Artificer, White Smith, or Battle Smith.

Since his priority was to create elemental jewels to place on the gauntlets he made, he needed a job that specialized for it.

William received five skill points after changing his Job Class, and he placed them all in Jewel Smithing. The Half-Elf was also interested in the Metal Smithing Skill, but for now, he decided to focus on Jewel Smithing.

Once he leveled up and gained Skill Points, it wouldn’t be too late to add points to the Metal Smithing Skill.

-

[ Jewel Smithing ]

— Allows the Artificer to refine, or create jewels for various purposes.

— Chances of success in Jewel Creation are dependent on the Skill’s Level.

— Chance of Success in Jewel Creation: 50%

-

William took out an emerald from his storage ring. He had no time to polish a gem from the beginning, so he decided to use a ready-made gem for his experiment.

Unlike the Titania’s Gauntlet that allowed its wielder to fully manipulate the Wind Element, William’s gauntlet was not so convenient. However, what it lacked in power, it made up for in diversity.

At least, that is what William had planned for the weapon he had personally crafted for Chiffon.

William closed his eyes and focused his magical power on the jewel that he was holding in his hand.

“Jewel Skill Creation.”

A faint green light glowed inside the emerald as William attached a skill to it. The glow became stronger as the Jewel Skill Creation neared its completion. However, just before William was about to succeed, cracks appeared on the emerald’s surface. A second later, the emerald turned into fine glittering green dust.

William failed on his first attempt, but William wasn’t too worried. He once again took an emerald from his storage ring and started the process all over again.

On his ninth attempt, William finally succeeded and successfully imbued a skill into the emerald.

-

[ Jewel Creation Success! ]

[ The host has created a High-Quality Jewel of Flight! ]

[ Gained Exp Points: 2,000 ]

[ Congratulations Your Artificer Job Class has Increased a level! ]

[ Congratulations Your Artificer Job Class has Increased a level! ]

William gained six additional skill points after his Job Class gained two levels. He immediately maxed his Jewel Smithing Skill and increased the chance of success to 75%

Although it wasn’t a hundred percent, William was still happy about the current success rate.

He placed the Flight Jewel on the middle slot of the right gauntlet. After admiring his work for half a minute, he once again took out a different jewel from his storage ring.

This time, William took out a Moon Stone and imbued another skill to it.

“Jewel Skill Creation.”

Several hours passed before William finally finished his masterpiece. Using his Jewel Smithing, and Metal Smithing Skills, William had worked tirelessly until the Gauntlet transformed into a Pseudo-Legendary Weapon.

[ Please give a name to your creation ]

“Name it Devourer’s Gauntlets,” William said before falling on his back. He had given his everything to create this weapon, and now he was too exhausted to even move.

“Ashe, help me,” William called out to his mermaid lover through telepathy. “I can’t move.”

A few minutes later, the door of the workshop opened and a young lady with light-blue hair walked in with a worried look.

“Three days have passed in the outside world and all of us are worried about you,” Ashe said with a sigh. “I was surprised when you contacted me, but to think that you worked till the point that you are even unable to move astounds me.”

“I know. I’m just that awesome.”

“More like that stupid.”

Ashe then looked at the glowing gauntlets on top of William’s working desk, and felt a little jealous of the little girl who would soon receive them.

Just a glance was enough to tell her that William had poured his heart and soul to its creation, to the point of exhaustion. If the Half-Elf had done the same for her, she would definitely be moved by his token of love.

Ashe picked up William from the ground and carried him like a princess. The Half-Elf willed his thoughts and the Devourer’s Gauntlet flew towards his storage ring.

Two days later, he would travel to Aamon’s Temple to finally meet with the God who could lift the curse from Ashe, Est, and Isaac.

Emperor Leonidas finally gave his permission a day after Princess Sidonie’s birthday party. Lily had said that Aamon was a moody person. If William managed to catch him in a good mood then the quest he would receive would be relatively easy.

However, if he caught him in a bad mood… he would give William an unreasonable quest that was near impossible to complete.

Having encountered Cernunnos in the past, William had already accepted that he had Dog-Sh*t Luck. He had already prepared himself for the worst case scenario in his meeting with Aamon. Even so, he wouldn’t back down.

He had promised Ashe, Est, and Isaac that he would lift their curse, and bring back the things that they had lost.

William looked forward to the day where he could finally embrace Est in her true form. More than anything else, he wanted to keep the promise that he had made with her before he went to the Central Continent.

A promise that when they meet again, they would truly become lovers, in heart, body, and soul.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
