"Where are we going?" Maple asked. "Are we going to eat again?"

"Cinnamon has just eaten dinner, but I still have room for desserts," Cinnamon commented.

Right after dinner, William took the twins outside to take a stroll.

Maple and Cinnamon had become everyone's darlings, and had been spoiled silly by his wives, and lovers. They would feed the two girls food, as if they were their pets, making William feel as if a kitten was scratching his liver.

Just as the three were walking hand in hand in the palace gardens of the Kingdom of Edelweiss, a gentle breeze blew, and several pink butterflies that glowed brightly, flew in their direction.

Maple and Cinnamon who saw these butterflies both looked at each other in surprise because this was not the first time they were seeing these butterflies.

The butterflies were not actually living butterflies, but things created by using magic.

The two little girls let go of William's hands as they followed the pink butterflies that were now flying away from them.

There was an urgency in their steps because they knew that if they followed where the butterflies were taking them, they would find the person that loved them with all of her heart.

William smiled as he followed behind the two girls who released his hand as soon as they understood where he was taking them. Although he felt a bit sad that it was time to bid farewell to the two adorable girls, he knew that he couldn't keep them by his side forever.

A minute later, they finally saw her..

A pink-haired girl stood quietly beside the magnificent fountain that was found at the center of the garden. She had her back facing Wiliam and the twins, but even then, it was quite easy for the three of them to recognize who she was. 

"Mama!" Maple shouted as she ran towards Chiffon.

"Mama!" Cinnamon ran as well with her arms spread wide. 

After hearing their voices, Chiffon turned around and smiled. She then opened her arms wide and caught her two daughters who had thrown themselves in her arms.

A few seconds later, Chiffon showered Maple and Cinnamon with kisses, and the two kissed her back, making the heart of Half-Elf who was watching the scene melt.

It was impossible not to feel anything after seeing this happy moment, and the red-headed teenager hoped that, in the future, his pink-haired wife would also be able to shower their own daughters with kisses, just like the scene he was seeing right now. 

"Are we going home?" Maple asked.

"Is it time to go back?" Cinnamon inquired.

Chiffon nodded and patted the heads of the two little girls whom she loved dearly. 

"Yes. It's time for the two of you to go back," Chiffon said softly. 

Maple and Cinnamon exchanged a glance before nodding their heads. They then turned around to look at William and waved their hands at him to bid their farewells.

"Bye bye!" Maple said. "We will come back again to play some time!"

"Bye bye!" Cinnamon shouted. "Don't miss us too much, okay?"

The Half-Elf chuckled before waving his hands back at the twins. 

"See you soon," William replied. "Be good girls and listen to your Mama, okay? Don't make her worry all the time."

"Okay!"

"Un!"

Chiffon smiled before giving William a brief nod. 

The red-headed teenager returned her gesture before turning around. He didn't want to personally see Maple, Cinnamon, and Chiffon leave right in front of him. 

For some reason, he felt as if they were leaving him for good, and it was making his heart ache.

Suddenly, a gentle breeze blew past him, and Chiffon's words reached his ears.

"Smile. The world is not ending just yet."

Several pink butterflies circled around him, as if encouraging him to do his best. They lasted only for half a minute before they bursted into particles of light, telling him that the three pink-haired girls had gone back to their own world.

The Half-Elf closed his eyes as if immersing himself in the bittersweet feelings that were rising up in his chest. 

Truth be told, the Half-Elf had been feeling very stressed as of late. He wanted nothing more than to go back to the Underworld to take his wives back, but according to Cathy, the time wasn't right just yet.

Because of this, he went to the Western Continent to take his mind off things, and focused his attention in making the Gunnar Federation part of the Grand Alliance.

But, after seeing Chiffon, he couldn't help but miss the pink-haired girl that was now stuck in Guttony's Paradise.

It was not only Chiffon that he missed. 

He also missed Princess Sidonie, Morgana, Ashe, and Celine. 

'Celine must have given birth by now,' William sighed in his heart. 'I wonder if it is a girl or a boy…'

In truth, William and Celine had talked about what to name their child if it was a boy or a girl. They came up with many names, and among them, two stood out.

Ciel and Kate.

These were the two names that William and Celine had approved of after thinking of countless names for their first child. 

In order to have a proper childbirth, Celine was taken by her Patron Goddess, Lyssa, to the Elysian Fields.

A place where all those who had done glorious deeds when they were still alive went after they died.

It was quite similar to Valhalla, but the major difference was that those that went to Valhalla were all warriors, or had died fighting on the battlefield. The Valkyries would personally go down to take their souls to the halls of Asgard, where they would be reborn as Einherjars.

They were mankind's greatest champions, and the defenders of the Nine Realms.

During the battle of Ragnarok, these brave warriors fought tooth and nail against the Army of Destruction. 

Everyone fought to the last man, and woman, leaving their bodies and weapons on the ground as they drew their last breath. 

Now, this same scene would once again happen, not in Asgard, but in the world of Hestia. 

"This time, it will be different. Is what you're probably thinking of right now, right?"

The Half-Elf abruptly opened his eyes as he turned around to look in the direction where the voice had come from. 

Since he was lost in his thoughts, he didn't notice that anyone had approached him. But, that didn't mean that he had let his guard down completely. If someone were able to get near him without detection, that only meant that their rank was as high, or higher than his.

"I found some good booze while I was taking a stroll," the old scammer of Lont said as he appeared in front of William with a smug smile plastered on his face. "Come, Will. how about we have a drink and you tell me what have you been doing while I was away scamming people?"

William's grandpa, James, walked up to the red-headed teenager carrying a plastic bag with the logo 7-EL-Heaven. 

The corner of the Half-Elf's lips twitched because after not seeing his grandpa for quite some time, the latter came back carrying food and snacks that he had bought from a popular convenience store from Earth.

He didn't know where the old coot had gone during his absence, but after seeing his grandpa, the Half-Elf felt that somehow, his world started to turn once again.
