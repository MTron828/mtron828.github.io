Chapter 487: How Long Do You Plan To Make Me Wait?

Once the Elves had left the boundary of the Giant Black Skull in the sky, they regained control of their magic. For the past three days, the Clerics, and Spiritualists of the Elves had busied themselves in healing the elves from all of their injuries, including their loss of hearing.

Some of the Elves whose hearing were stronger than others, suffered from shock which caused their bodies to be paralyzed. They had to be carried off of the battlefield by their peers, and this took a great effort on the part of everyone in the army.

Elandorr, as well as those who had a say in the war, were all gathered inside the Main Tent so they could discuss what they should do next. It would take another three days before the entire Army had been healed from their injuries, according to the Head Cleric and Arcane Spiritualist who were in charge of dealing with the aftermath.

All of them had made several proposals, but none of them managed to get the vote of the majority. They were at an impasse on what to do, because they didn’t know if the spell that rendered them helpless could be used over and over again.

Everyone in the room knew that If the Giant Skull could once again disable their hearing, and make their magic inside their bodies run amok then the same thing would happen again.

While they were at a loss on what to do, Alessio stood up from his seat and spoke his mind.

“I think I have a way to deal with this problem,” Alessio said with confidence.

Everyone in the room faced his direction as they waited for him to continue his explanation.

“I believe that the Giant Skull is powered by the Altars that our enemy built all over the Continent,” Alessio stated. “If we destroy those altars, we can prevent them from using that spell over and over again.”

No one in the room was able to refute his proposal because it sounded very logical. If they could cut off its power source then the Giant Skull would no longer pose a threat to them.

“Among us, only His Excellency, Lord Eneru, and the mighty Qilin Race, are capable of destroying those altars in a short period of time. I believe that this will deal with the root of the problem and we can continue our assault on the City of Gladiolus.”

Alessio then bowed respectfully to Eneru before returning to his seat. As the leader of Deus in the Silvermoon Continent, he couldn’t allow Conner to get the upper hand or he would lose face. He could already imagine Berthold’s ridicule and contempt going on behind his back, and it irritated him to no end.

“When the altars activated, they shot out pillars of light in the sky,” Eneru commented after Alessio’s proposal. “Although I have a general idea on their locations, it would be impossible for me to find them all. Unless… you have a way to pinpoint their locations.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Eneru stared at Alessio with a determined expression. Since the Elf had made this proposal, he naturally had a way to find these altars that he had spoken off.

“Of course, Your Excellency,” Alessio replied. “I have several artifacts that will help you pinpoint their locations. You can assign them to the members of the Qilin Race in order to finish the job faster.”

Eneru nodded. He was itching to do something, and this task suited him perfectly because he could travel at the speed of lightning. The same could be said about the members of the Qilin Tribe, so this assignment was tailor made for all of them.

“Now that the issue of the altar has been dealt with, the next problem remains.” One of the Elven Captains sighed. “How do we free, His Excellency, Lord Drauum, from his prison?”

The room descended into silence. This silence didn’t last long because Shafel, the Great Elder, spoke his mind.

“I believe that the prison where His Excellency is being held will disappear soon,” Shafel said. “A spell that can trap someone of his caliber cannot be maintained for a long time. Perhaps, it might even break at any moment from now.”

Everyone in the room looked at the Great Elder with a dumbfounded expression.

Even Alessio didn’t say anything, because he was not aware of the kind of method that the Humans had used to trap a Pseudo-Demigod. All he knew was that whatever it was, they must have paid a high price for it.

Ezkalor had his arms crossed over his chest, but didn’t participate in the discussion. He also believed that if the Humans had a way to kill Drauum, they would have already done that, instead of imprisoning it.

Since they chose to imprison it, it meant that they had no way of dealing with ii, which was very different from how they tried to kill Eneru when he challenged them alone.

Seeing that everyone had quieted down, Elandorr scanned the faces of everyone in the room before he ended the conference.

Princess Eowyn wasn’t present in the talks because she was one of the Elves that had a very strong auditory perception. The silent scream had knocked her unconscious as her ears bled due to her ruptured eardrums.

Fortunately, her life wasn’t in danger and had been personally attended to by the Head Cleric after she had regained control of her powers.

Meanwhile inside the City of Gladiolus…

Conner eyed the Golden Iron Maiden in the sky and saw faint signs of cracks appearing on its surface. He knew that the spell was only a temporary one, and the Young Prince was currently out of commission.

Even if he fed him all the Elixirs in his possession, Prince Ernest wouldn’t be able to activate the city’s defenses when the Elves came knocking on their doors.

Conner had made a workaround for that, and used the remaining power of the Giant Black Skull to reinforce the magical barrier of the city.

He also used the power of the altars that they had built inside the city to gather the souls of those that had died during the battle.

Conner knew that Alessio would think of targeting the altars that were scattered all over the continent, but he was already one step ahead of him. Those altars no longer served any purpose, because he made sure that all the souls that they had gathered had been absorbed by their trump card.

‘We can only use the skull one more time,’ Conner thought as he eyed the Giant Black Skull hovering in the sky. ‘We need to get a decisive win next time.’

The Leader of Deus in the Southern Continent caressed the pendant that hung on his neck. Memories of the distant past flashed inside his mind.

Happy memories when he was still young and innocent.

Those days were the happiest days of his life. Unfortunately, they didn’t last long. Many years later that young and innocent Half-Elf now commanded outlaws, just like him, and was currently the Commander against the Elves that were responsible for taking his beloved away from him.

Conner then shifted his attention to the city where the newly formed Ash Golems, that were born from the corpse of the Elves and the Giant Eagles, stood in formation.

Since the dead bodies of the Elves’ and the Eagles’ were of high quality, Conner was able to create over a hundred thousand Ash Golems.

The knowledge to turn corpses into golems was an open secret among the leaders of the Organization. It was one of the pieces of knowledge that had been shared with them by the Supreme Pontifex of Deus that lorded over them all.

To this day, Conner hadn’t seen the face of their Supreme Pontifex. In fact, he believed that none of the leaders of Deus actually knew what their Lord looked like.

Conner chuckled as he pushed away these thoughts at the back of his head.

‘Now is not the time to think about His Excellency,’ Conner sighed as he eyed the Elven Encampment in the distance.

If possible, he would like to crush the Elves all at once. Sadly, he was lacking in manpower and the resources needed to make this wish a reality.

It was also at that moment when the image of a red-headed boy flashed inside his head.

Conner snorted as he looked at the Southeast where the Zelan Dynasty was located.

“Just how long do you plan to make me wait?” Conner muttered. “Where are you?

“William Von Ainsworth.”
