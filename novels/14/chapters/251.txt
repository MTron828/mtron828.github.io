Chapter 251: You’re Not Qualified To Fight Me

Great Chief Evander gripped the armchair in an attempt to prevent himself from killing the boy then and there. As the Great Chief of the Northern Tribes, he had to be the example for every warrior to follow.

However, even he was finding it hard to keep his rage from rising to the surface. The boy’s mouth was simply too obnoxious that he wanted to rip it apart so badly. Even so, he endured. There was a right time for everything, and now was not the right time.

“Is this the attitude of a Knight Commander?” Great Chief Evander asked. “I expected more from an official of the Hellan Kingdom.”

William snorted before he gave his reply, “My attitude depends on who I am talking to. If I’m talking to dogs, there’s no need to be polite. Why do I have to act respectful to mongrels who only know how to hide in these mountains? Even a grandma from my hometown has more balls than all of you combined.”

Another round of roars reverberated across the Third Peak of the Chivalry as several of the warriors weren’t able to stop themselves from jumping inside the arena. They would rather die than be insulted by the hateful Half-Elf who was stepping on their pride and dignity!

“Damn this boy!”

“His mouth is too evil!”

“Brothers, let me kill that bastard!”

“No! Let me kill him!”

“Even if I die, I will bring him to the afterlife with me!”

Seeing that everything was going South, Great Chief Evander was forced to stand and pacify his people.

“Stop! Don’t listen to him! He’s just provoking all of you!” Evander shouted. “Did you not see what happened earlier?! Do you want to die as well?!”

The warriors stopped after hearing their Great Chief’s words, but soon, William’s mocking laughter irritated their ears once again.

“Would you rather die as warriors? Or die as dogs?” William sneered. “Just take a good look at your Great Chief. He is just standing there while I call all of you cowards, dogs, and pus*ies. Do you know why he’s not reprimanding me? I’ll tell you why! It’s because it’s the truth!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

William raised his chin arrogantly. “What mighty warriors? Such audacity! If you really are as mighty as you say you are then why are you hiding here in the mountains like little rats? If you are as mighty as you say you are then why don’t you challenge the Hellan Kingdom to war in a fair battle?”

William spat on the ground before sneering at Great Chief Evander. “Brave Warriors who only dare to fight when it was three against one? Just like now, I stand here alone, and yet all of you want to fight me at the same time, and you still have to ask why I call all of you pus*ies?”

The devilish Half-Elf pointed at Connal with a mocking expression.

“Look at your leader! He is desperately hiding his second son under his skirt! Second Warrior? More like Second Pus*y.”

William laughed one more time and his irritating laughter made all the warriors who heard it gnash their teeth in rage. After laughing, William raised his chin in an arrogant manner in order to continue his taunting.

“Why don’t we ask your God whether he thinks of you as warriors or not?” William then pointed his finger at the First Peak of Divinity that could be seen in the distance.

The Warriors glanced at the direction of the First Peak and waited. They wanted their God to smite this irritating boy and turn him into an ice sculpture. That way they could place him as a permanent landmark in the Third Peak where everyone could spit on his face anytime!

William wasn’t aware of what the warriors were thinking as he shouted with all of his might.

“Sovereign that rules over the Kyrintor Mountains. If everything that I have said is false then punish me here and now! The warriors of the Kyrintor Mountains are not warriors but cowards! Mere dogs who are now wagging their tails at their new masters which are the Two Dynasties of the Southern Continent! Tell me! Am I wrong or not?!”

Everyone held their breaths as they waited for the response of the Demigod that ruled over the entirety of the Northern Region.

There was no bolt of lightning, no peal of thunder, and not even a sound that came from the First Peak of Divinity. The deafening silence made the warriors’ blood turn cold for they felt that their Sovereign’s silence was its silent acknowledgement of William’s claims.

William, who was the source of the commotion, had an arrogant look on his face, but deep inside he was feeling anxious. He didn’t know what kind of being the Demigod was, or its stance towards the war that the Northern Tribes were planning to wage.

Actually, William wanted to know if the Sovereign of the Kyrintor Mountains was also in cahoots with the Two Dynasties. This was more scary than having an army invade the Hellan Kingdom because fighting against a Demigod was no laughing matter.

The silence continued. William could have sworn that mere seconds had passed, but for him, it felt like hours. When five minutes passed and still no answer came from the First Peak, the warriors of the tribe looked at their Great Chieftain anxiously.

Great Chief Evander felt cold. Not because of the warriors’ stares, but the silence of their Sovereign. Its silence was more deafening than the war cries of all the warriors combined and it chilled his very soul.

“See?” William said softly. “Even your God agrees with me. You are not warriors. All of you are just cowards who only know how to fight when it is advantageous to you.”

William was about to say more when a shout reverberated in the air.

“Shut up! Shut your mouth!” Connal’s bloodshot eyes stared at William as he rose from his seat. “You want to steal my bride? Fine! Let’s fight! If you win you can have the princess, If I win you will take your words back!”

William chuckled. However, this chuckle seemed more deafening than his laughter earlier. He no longer needed to fight Connal because he had already achieved his goal. Now that the tribe thought that their “God” agreed with William’s claims, their will to fight had also disappeared.

Connal also knew that, if this continued, his family would no longer remain as the ruling family of the Northern Tribe. The reason Evander was called the Great Chief was because all the tribes acknowledged him. If this acknowledgement disappeared then a new Chief would take his place.

There were many who had wanted to replace Great Chief Evander for a long time, but they hadn’t found a good reason to do so. Now, William presented them with an opportunity, an opportunity that they could use to finally end the Great Chief’s reign over all the Tribes in the Kyrintor Mountain once and for all.

“Take my words back? Sorry, but not happening,” William said. “Are you stupid? Even your Sovereign agreed with me. If I take it back, wouldn’t the esteemed Excellency hit me with lightning bolts?”

It was at that moment when thunder roared in the heavens. The warriors who heard this knelt down on the ground because they clearly felt the Divinity that accompanied it. Their God had finally made Its presence known and it seemed to be siding with William once again.

Great Chief Evander’s and Connal’s faces turned deathly pale. They knew that now was a crucial time and they needed to turn the situation around before it was too late!

“Fine, you want my princess? Then I’ll give her to you!” Connal shouted. “But in return, you will fight me in a duel! As per the laws of our domain! Do you dare accept my challenge?”

Connal didn’t care anymore. All he wanted to do was end William’s life in order to vent out the anger in his heart

“You’re not qualified to fight me.” William gave Connal the middle finger. At the start, he really wanted to fight Connal and make the Great Chief agree to his demands after he won the duel. However, the current situation was already good enough.

He really didn’t care about Princess Aila. Although he felt pity for her, and found her beautiful, she was just a stranger he had met for the first time. He had no obligation to help her.

‘This is the Fate of people that have chained themselves to the whim of their God,’ William thought. ‘As long as the God is on their side they are invincible, but the moment they lose Its favor, the Northern Tribes are merely castles made of sand that would easily crumble once the waves come to shore.’

On that day, on the Third Peak of Chivalry, the Great Chief, Evander Zeke, was forced to bow his head. His ambition for the Northern Tribes to march and conquer the Hellan Kingdom was put to an abrupt stop.

Cadell covered his face in regret. If only he had refused Sir Jerkins’ proposal to travel with him to the Third Peak of Chivalry none of this would have happened. How he wished that he could turn back time and correct the mistake that he had made.

He would definitely kick William out of the mountains and ban him from setting foot in their domain for as long as he drew breath.
