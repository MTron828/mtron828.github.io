Chapter 463: Divide And Conquer

William leaned on the balcony as he gazed upon the city of Veritas. He was surprised to see that the city seemed more lively and orderly compared to the capital of the Hellan Kingdom, Gladiolus.

After that episode in the throne room, Empress Sidonie told them that she would meet them again in the morning. She also advised them to use their private time to think of an offer to win her over.

The teasing gaze she gave William before she left the throne room made the red-headed boy scratch his cheeks because it was clear that the beautiful Empress would make things difficult for him.

William cast these thoughts aside as he asked the System about their real purpose for coming to the Anaesha Dynasty.

‘Are you sure about this?’

[ Yes, Host. Aside from the three Myriad Beasts, there is a Pseudo-Demigod present here in Veritas as well. ]

‘It seems that the Kraetor Empire came more prepared than the Elves when they ventured to the Southern Continent,’ William thought as he rubbed his chin. ‘How about the teleportation gate? Is it somewhere in the city?’

[ It’s not. I am currently synchronizing with your King’s Legion and constantly doing a sweep of the lands of the Anaesha Dynasty, but so far, any traces of a Teleportation Gate cannot be detected ]

Before William had arrived at the capital city of Veritas, he had assigned the Angray Birds, as well as the Blood Eagle, Scadrez, to scatter in different directions so that the System could map the lands of the Anaesha Dynasty and look for traces of the Kraetor Empire’s Teleportation Gate.

The Half-Elf wanted to know just how massive their army and hidden forces were. Both he and the System agreed that the current Top Dog in the continent was none other than the Beautiful Empress whom he had turned down in the Kyrintor Mountains.

If someone were to ask William if he regretted his decision the answer would be… Yesn’t.

Yes, he regretted turning Empress Sidonie down because if he just nodded his head and accepted her as his lover then this powerful army would have been part of his strength in fighting against the elves.

No, because although the offer was very tempting. He couldn’t possibly lie to himself. The Young Empress was indeed very beautiful. More beautiful than his lovers, but what of it? William wasn’t someone who was easily moved by beauty alone.

Especially after being exposed to the Goddess of Lust, Eros, who could make William become lovestruck with just a simple wink from her mischievous eyes.

The reason he had turned Sidonie down was because of what the latter had asked of him. She wanted Love, and that was something that William doesn’t do half heartedly.

In the past, he thought that having a Harem was the dream life of every man. However, he was wrong. Because he already had three lovers by his side, and one waiting for him back on Earth, he understood more than ever that Loving someone and Lusting over someone were two different feelings.

Although two people could fall in Love over Lust, it would not be Real Love. Lady Eros made sure to indoctrinate this into William because she was the Goddess that represented Lust. Charming people and making them do her every bidding was good, but in the end, this affection was fake.

Eros didn’t want her followers to gain Fake Love. She wanted them to have Real Love that would make Sidonie and Morgana feel happiness from the bottom of their sinful hearts.

‘How many forces does the Kraetor Empire have in the Anaesha Dynasty?’ William inquired after organizing his thoughts and feelings.

[ More than thirty thousand. I’m guessing that some of their forces are stationed in the Kingdom of Freesia in order to maintain law and order. ]

William nodded his head in agreement. In order to maintain the peace and order of the two Kingdoms under Empress Sidonie’s rule, it was only natural that they leave a part of their army to oversee the affairs of the Kingdom in the East.

Also, this was a safeguard against the Elves who might also consider attacking the far away kingdom in order to acquire more lands of their own. Obviously, although the Kraetor Empire had the upper hand, they still didn’t underestimate their enemies and made sufficient counter measures for the worst case scenario.

[ Scadrez had reached the Northern Borders of the Anaesha Dynasty. There’s no sign, or any traces, of the long distance Teleportation Gate in the route he took. ]

[ B1 and B2 have also arrived at their destination, and still no signs of any structures that would resemble a long distance Teleportation Gate. ]

B1 and B2 where the nickname that William had given to the two dumb birds that had imitated his and his lover’s voices back inside the Atlantis Dungeon. That episode was something that the Half-Elf would not forget anytime soon, so he grouped the two birds together and made them partake in this mission. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Actually, it was not only B1 and B2 that had been mobilized for this sweep of the Anaesha Dynasty.

All of the Angray Birds were currently soaring over Empress Sidonie’s territory, allowing the system to map it. William decided to use the divide and conquer method, similar to the spies of the Ant Queen that had been scattered all over the Zelan Dynasty to monitor the movements of the Elves.

Although the ants were numerous, and allowed the Queen to see through their eyes. The System was in a league of its own. Not only could it synchronize with William’s Legion to see what they were seeing, it could also emit a scan, similar to that of a radar, to check a three-mile circle radius around the member of the King’s Legion, and could also penetrate underground.

This made William’s System far superior, and a very effective spy satellite!

‘Have you found any beasts that I could tame to add to our forces?’

[ We have found several beast groups, but since the host had specified to only look for Class C Beasts and above, the numbers have dwindled drastically. Even so, I have great news because we have found a few strong candidates to add to the Host’s Herd. ]

‘Excellent.’ William grinned. ‘Mark their locations on the map so we can visit them once we have finished our business here in the capital.’

[ Understood. ]

William knew that the beasts in the Hellan Kingdom wouldn’t be enough to increase his army. Because of this, he decided to smuggle some beasts from the neighboring Dynasties and Kingdom to add to his private forces.

Empress Sidonie was not the only one that had the ability to command a massive army under her banner. What she could do, William could do better. After all, the Southern Continent was a vast land filled with many powerful beasts.

Among those powerful beasts were Herd Type Beasts

Herd Type Beasts that William could tame, so they could help him face all the obstacles that stood before him.

While William was checking the markers that the System had placed in his Status Page. A beautiful lady was watching him from a crystal ball.

Empress Sidonie who had returned to her chambers was currently monitoring William in the guestroom that was provided for him.

She thought that the latter would be wracking his brains out, trying to think of ways to get on her good side. However, what she saw made her and her other half, Morgana, disappointed.

[ Why is he chuckling like a crazy person? Did darling lose some of the screws in his head? ]

‘…’

Both girls were not aware that the Half-Elf was just unable to hide his happiness when he saw the catalogue of beasts that were native to the Anaesha Dynasty.

Beasts that would soon belong to his Thousand Beast Army.
