Fennel Kingdom…

"This isn't part of the script. Uh… good thing I managed to protect my handsome face," Silenus muttered as he tossed aside the house that collapsed over his body after one of the Giants had sent him flying with a palm strike. "I was supposed to be the Prince in Shining armor that was going to save the Princess from the Tyrant Giant, but this is just too much."

Silenus was currently facing four Demigods, who had now started to wreak havoc on their surroundings. 

Just like what was happening in Quince, the Giant Army had breached the city wall and was currently destroying the structures around them.

Silenus had chosen this time to make his appearance to embolden the people, but after a short exchange, one of the Giants slapped him, sending him crashing towards the city face first.

"I can't disillusion the hopes and dreams of the ladies that admire me." Silenus casually flipped his hair as he looked at the four Demigods who made him look bad just a minute ago. "I guess it's time to use 100% of my power."

A devilish grin appeared on the Satyr's face as the ground started to shake.

"The hundreds of years that I spent living in peace have dulled my fighting prowess," Silenus muttered. "Still, William said that the Giants we are going to face number in the millions, and within those millions are thousands of Demigods, and hundreds of Pseudo-Gods…  the future doesn't look too bright."

Silenus could now understand that this was certainly not the time to be living peacefully inside his forest because this kind of threat was about to descend in the world.

William told them that he would stage this battle to make the people of the Western Continent understand the dangers that they were about to face. 

He then told the Demigods to try and stop this "staged" invasion, and see for themselves just what kind of foes they would be facing in the future.

Suddenly, the ground under Silenus' feet burst apart, and a Giant Ent Tree, that towered hundreds of meters, rose from the ground, carrying the Satyr on its shoulders. 

"Crush my foes!" Silenus roared. "Rise, Amdusias!"

The Giant Ent then smashed its fist into the Giant's face, smashing its entire body to the ground. 

A powerful explosion shook the entire city as Silenus used his trump card, whose power reached the initial stages of the Pseudo-God Rank.

The Satyr was an easy going fellow, and most people thought that he was the weakest among the four Demigods of the Central Continent. However, they didn't know that when the flirtatious Satyr became serious, his strength would surpass the power of his peers.

Giant vines rose up from the ground and wrapped around the three other Demigod Giants, holding them firmly in place.

The earth rumbled as the Satyr and his Giant Ent, fought with everything they had, laying waste to the city that they were supposed to protect.

Kingdom of Zinnia…

"Sh*t!" Ifrit cursed as he unleashed a barrage of giant fireballs at the Giants that were pushing him back little by little. 

After getting beaten up by Astrape, Ifrit had long wanted to vent his frustration on something. 

This was why, when William devised his plan with the help of the King of Edelweiss, the Demigod of Fire thought that this was a good opportunity to finally let loose and show the Half-Elf that he wouldn't lose if it was a fight against Demigods.

However, contrary to what he expected, he was only fighting a single Demigod and he was actually getting pushed back.

The three other Demigods ignored him and started to smash the houses within the city like little kids that had somehow found a new toy to play with.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This ticked off Ifrit because he felt that the Giants were looking down on him, and thought that he wasn't much of a threat. 

Because of this, he had unleashed his strongest attack to send his enemy to the afterlife, but contrary to what he expected, the Giant he was facing endured his blow, and even managed to counter attack by hurling a random house it had grabbed from the ground in his direction.

Ifrit didn't know that William had personally handpicked the Giants that they were going to fight against. The Demigods assigned to fight against Ifrit were the Giants from Muspelheim that had been born in the hottest regions of the planet.

Because of this, they were more resistant to fire more than anything else, allowing them to shrug off Ifrit's flames, as if they were nothing but water being splashed on their bodies.

When the town was half destroyed, a black lightning bolt hit one of the Demigod Giants and pushed it back outside the city. Several more lightning bolts descended, hitting all the Giants that had managed to reach the center of the capital city of Zinnia.

A moment later, hundreds of Wyverns appeared behind Astape, carrying the members of the Demon Race, who now hurled spells against the Giants, pushing them back.

The defenders of the Zinnia all cheered after seeing this scene. They thought that when Ifrit arrived, all of them would be saved. But, contrary to their expectations, the Demigod whom they revered was actually losing ground against his opponent.

After seeing that reinforcements had arrived, Ifrit roared as he clashed against his opponent and unleashed a flurry of blows using his full power. 

"He lost it," Bronte commented as she erected a barrier to protect the rest of the city from the rampaging Demigod that was sending flames flying in every direction.

"True," Astrape commented. "This might have been a shock to him."

Before William initiated the plan he had in mind, he had made sure to set a limit to the destruction that was about to unfold.

The Giants were to only attack the city in full when most of the citizens had evacuated safely, and then they could slowly advance, destroying everything in their path.

They were also ordered to not kill any of the soldiers. This required great control, but since the Giants were under William's command, they reigned in their strength, making the defenders only suffer injuries that weren't life threatening.

To William's surprise, among the three Demigods, it was actually Silenus who managed to repel the invasion, which made the Half-Elf look at the Satyr in a different light.

However, there was a problem. The one that destroyed the city was not the Giants, but the Satyr who got carried away as he unleashed his full powers, almost turning the entire city into a forest that strengthened the power of his ability.

"Master, the attacks on all the Kingdoms have stopped," Opis reported. "But, won't they get suspicious because the Kingdom of Edelweiss didn't suffer during this invasion?"

"It's fine," William replied. "That's Alexis' problem now. Not ours."

The King of Edelweiss asked William to destroy the capital cities of all of his neighbors, so that all of them would know the severity of the situation. Of course, in order to not make it look like the Kingdom of Edelweiss wasn't attacked, the Giants destroyed one of its fortresses, which Alexis said that he planned to demolish and rebuild anyway. 

Since the plan was to destroy things, Alexis insisted that William help him turn the fortress into rubble, so that he wouldn't have to hire people to do it for him.

In the end, the Half-Elf agreed to this plan because it was the same thing he had agreed to do with the Dwarven Kingdom.

Now that the entire Western Continent knew the real threat of the Giants, they would now be more than willing to join William's Grand Alliance. 

Although staging the invasion took some time, it was still a worthwhile thing to do because it allowed the Gunnar Federation, as well as the Demigods of the Western Continent, to get a better understanding of what they would be facing in the not-so-distant future.
