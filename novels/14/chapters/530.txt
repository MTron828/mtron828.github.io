Chapter 530: Is Your Academy Teaching Weaklings? [Part 2]

“T-This!” Gilbert’s hands shook while holding William’s bracelet. His eyes turned bloodshot as he stared at William’s Merit Points.

The Professors got curious because their Headmaster was acting in a weird manner. They sneaked behind him to check what was wrong with the bracelet. Their eyes widened in shock, as their jaws dropped from the unbelievable sight that they saw.

William Von Ainsworth: 6,913,367 Merit Points

“Oh my God! Almost Seven Million Merit Points!” the Homeroom Professor of Class B exclaimed in shock. “How is this even possible?! Boy, you better explain this!”

“Did you tinker with the bracelet?” a Professor from the Fourth Year Division asked as he looked suspiciously at the red-headed teenager who had a smile on his face. “Do you know that there is a heavy punishment for anyone who dares to cheat in the Assessment Test?”

“I didn’t tinker with it,” WIlliam replied.

“Then how?!” another professor stepped forward. “Do you know that the highest record we currently have was from Prince Jason. His Merit Points were 621,489. His Highness has set a new record, and yet your points are ten times higher than him!”

“What? Only 621,489?” WIlliam replied in a dumbfounded manner. “Is your Academy teaching weaklings? Why are his points so low?”

The professors almost spat blood when they heard William’s comments. They couldn’t believe that someone actually dared to call Prince Jason’s accumulated points low. Not to mention, he even added that they were teaching weaklings?

The Homeroom Teacher of Class A in the Fifth Year division’s face became beet red out of anger. He had been feeling smug earlier because not only did the Prince set a new record, his class had also gained the highest Merit Count among the Fifth Years.

Although it was guaranteed that they would be hailed as the best class in the Fifth Year Division, he was unable to accept the fact that someone had easily beaten the new record that a student of his class had made.

“We need to investigate this.” Prince Jason’s homeroom teacher stepped forward. “How can this be possible? No one has gotten this many merit points since the Academy has been founded.”

William crossed his arms over his chest as a devilish smile appeared on his face. “No one managed to do this? Oh, my. I guess I overestimated the elite students of this academy. Something as easy as gaining six million points is deemed impossible?

“If I had taken this assessment test seriously I could have easily earned ten million points. However, I wanted to be lowkey, so I only settled for nearly Seven Million.”

The Half-Elf shook his head in disdain. “What are you going to say next? Are you going to tell me that no one has beaten the Last Boss on the 50th Floor of the Mirage Cavern? Because I just beat that boss not long ago.”

The room descended into silence after William had dropped a bomb in their faces. Gilbert almost dropped the bracelet in his hand, because of how much it shook after hearing William’s words.

“Y-You have beaten the Boss Monster at the 50th Floor of the Mirage Caverns?” Prince Jason’s homeroom teacher pointed a shaky finger in William’s face.

“Yes,” William answered. “The Boss was a ten-meter-tall purple frog, and his subordinates were three-meter tall. Each of them had a different element. Man… those toads were quite springy. They jumped around like their butts were on fire.”

William took out Five Beast Cores inside his storage ring and piled them on top of Gilbert’s desk.

A Purple Beast Core the size of a basketball, and four beast cores the size of bowling balls stood side by side.

The professors all stared at the glowing Beast Cores on top of the desk. Beast Cores that were not a day old had a certain lively luster in them that was different from those that had been stored for a long time.

All of them had fought in dungeons before and they were very familiar with the quality of Beast Cores. With this kind of evidence in front of them, it was hard to refute William’s claim.

“How did you do it?” Gilbert had regained his calm and asked this question directly.

“It’s a trade secret,” William replied before he took the Beast Cores and stored it inside his storage ring. “I don’t intend to share it with anyone.”

All the professors inside the staffroom cursed William in their hearts. What he did was not uncommon. Most adventurers didn’t want to share their strategy when dealing with High-Level Dungeons. It was their way to earn big, so these kinds of things were a well-guarded secret.

Gilbert sighed and placed the bracelet down on his desk. “The three of you may leave now. The final result of the Assessment Test will be announced in two days.”

William nodded his head and thanked Gilbert. Ian and Chiffon did the same and the three left together in a carefree manner.

After the students left, an old man wearing glasses stood up from the corner of the room. He was the Grandmaster that had created the bracelets that were used to measure the Merit Points that the students earned during this time of year.

He took William’s bracelet from the desk and scrutinized it properly. The Headmaster and the other Professors didn’t say anything and waited for him to announce his verdict.

Five minutes later, the old man placed the bracelet back on the desk. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It wasn’t tampered with,” the old man stated. He then tapped the bracelet thrice and a projection appeared in front of everyone.

The professors sucked in deep breaths after they had seen the records inside the bracelet.

They knew that once they announced the results of this year’s Assessment Test, the entire Kraetor Empire would go into an uproar. Gilbert hurriedly stood up from his seat to return to his office.

He needed to talk to Emperor Leonidas and tell him what the Half-Elf had achieved during the week-long test. Gilbert knew that if William’s record was announced publicly, it would go down in the annals of their Empire’s History.

William escorted Chiffon to Princess Sidonie’s quarters because he was afraid that the little girl would be bullied along the way.

The noble ladies looked at the disheveled Half-Elf in shock as he swaggered inside the Girl’s Dormitory.

This was not the first time that William had come here, because Princess Sidonie had often invited him to dine with her. The girls were also used to the dashing Half-Elf who made their hearts flutter with his smile.

However, seeing his current appearance, they couldn’t help but be shocked because the latter was currently not very presentable.

William noticed their stares, but he didn’t mind them one bit. He just walked with confidence as if he owned the place while holding Chiffon’s hand.

After knocking on Princess Sidonie’s room twice, the Half-Elf thought that the Princess was not around. He then opened the door to allow Chiffon to go in when he noticed a peculiar scent in the air.

William scanned the room and found that the door that led to the Princess’ bedroom was left partially open.

The Half-Elf could sense a Divine Power emitting from within, so he hurriedly walked towards it to see what was happening.

Inside, he saw the beautiful Princess lying on top of the bed, and panting for breath.

The moment her beautiful golden eyes landed on William, a barely audible plea escaped her lips.

“Will… help me…”
