Chapter 454: The Fate Of The Two Princes Of The Hellan Kingdom

Prince Lionel and Prince Rufus arrived at the capital of the Anaesha Dynasty, Veritas.

Both of them were dressed according to their rank because Conner didn’t want to give Empress Sidonie a bad impression. The young warriors of the Kraetor Empire escorted the two Princes to the throne room to meet with the young Empress who had full command of their army.

Prince Lionel walked the wide hallways of the Palace with anticipation. At first, he thought that The Organization finally decided to dispose of him, but was relieved when he was told that he would be sent as a hostage to the current ruler of the Anaesha Dynasty, Princess Sidonie.

‘I knew that the Princess cared for me,’ Prince Lionel thought as he walked with a spring in his steps. ‘Perhaps she finally understands that I am the only man that can match her intellect and beauty.’

Walking behind him was Prince Rufus who had a solemn expression on his face. Unlike his older brother that was infatuated with the Princess, the Second Prince of the Hellan Dynasty only felt dread. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He felt much safer staying inside a cell in one of Deus’ Prisons, rather than having an audience with the most beautiful young lady in the continent. Prince Rufus already knew about the power of Empress Sidonie’s Charm.

Since she was the one that his older brother adored, the Second Prince had also gathered information about her. The two of them were rivals who fought for the throne. It was only natural to know your opponent’s weaknesses.

For Prince Rufus, meeting Empress Sidonie was similar to walking to the gallows for an execution. Once he was Charmed, he would no longer have a will of his own and would only follow Empress Sidonie’s every order.

‘No matter what happens, I will not make eye contact.’ Prince Rufus vowed in his heart. ‘I don’t care if this stupid brother of mine becomes a mindless puppet. I still want to see Rebecca. I refuse to be Charmed!’

When the two massive doors of the Throne Room were opened, Prince Lionel immediately saw the lady of his dreams.

Empress Sidonie sat on a golden throne and looked at the Crown Prince with a sweet smile on her face. She even made a gesture for the Prince to walk forward, so that she could get a better look at him.

Prince Lionel didn’t need someone to tell him what to do. He walked towards the Empress with confidence and returned her smile with a smile of his own.

Prince Rufus, on the other hand, kept his head bowed and stared at the floor as if his life depended on it. One of the guards that had escorted the two Princes gave Prince Rufus a push on his back to make him walk forward.

Knowing that he had no choice but to obey, Rufus walked forward with even steps. He only stopped when the guard told him to stop, where he, and Prince Lionel were forced to kneel in front of their Empress.

“It has been a while, Prince Lionel,” Empress Sidonie said in a tone that was as smooth as silk. “I pray that you have been well since the last time we saw each other.”

Prince Lionel’s smile widened. “I’m afraid that not everything went well after the two of us parted, Princess Sidonie.”

“That’s Empress Sidonie to you!” Prince Jason commented from the side.

Prince Jason didn’t like the fawning expression on Prince Lionel’s face because he was blatantly showing his adoration to the Empress whom he had already claimed as his own in his heart.

“Of course,” Prince Lionel nodded apologetically. “Forgive me for my rudeness, Empress Sidonie. It was wrong of me to address you improperly.”

“You are forgiven, Prince Lionel,” Empress Sidonie replied as her eyes glowed with power. “Do you remember the order that you gave the members of Deus back at the Ravenlord Citadel?”

“How could I possibly forget?” Prince Lionel eyed the young Empress with a loving gaze. “I asked them to capture you and bring you to my room, so that I can shower you with my love.”

The Crown Prince of the Hellan Kingdom had been completely Charmed and he couldn’t lie even if he wanted to.

“Bastard!” Prince Jason exclaimed in anger as he drew his sword from his scabbard. “I’ll end your filthy life!”

Prince Jason was about to cut off Prince Lionel’s head when a single word stopped him in his tracks.

“Wait.”

Empress Sidonie’s order contained a hint of her Divinity, which made Prince Jason’s heart shudder, forcing him to stop his attack.

“You wish to shower me with your love?” Empress Sidonie asked.

Prince Lionel nodded as he felt his heart strings being plucked one by one by her sensuous voice. “I’ve always wanted you to be my wife. For so many years, I have waited. Ever since I saved you during that hunting expedition, my heart has belonged to you, and only to you.”

Prince Lionel’s voice was so filled with his overflowing feelings and passion that the people inside the throne room looked at him with various expressions. Some admired him, some loathed him, while some pitied him.

These young men and women had also fallen in love with the young Empress and they treated each other as love rivals. Seeing the Prince openly admit his love, which had lasted for many years, made them feel envious.

“I see,” Empress Sidonie’s eyes returned to normal as he looked at the Crown Prince with amusement. “Thank you for loving me all these years. Right now, we are in the middle of a war against the Elves and, to a certain extent, the people of your Kingdom. Do you wish to serve and fight for me?”

“Of course.” Prince Lionel pressed his fist over his chest as he bowed to Empress Sidonie like a knight swearing his fealty.

“I, Prince Lionel Arthur Vi Hellan, hereby swear upon my honor that I will fight for you, Your Majesty, till I draw my last breath,” Prince Lionel said with determination. “Your enemies will be my enemies, and I will use my heart, and body, to ensure that no harm will fall on your body. This I swear with my life.”

Empress Sidonie nodded her head in satisfaction as he made a gesture for Prince Lionel to stand.

“From now on, you will be part of my Royal Guard,” Empress Sidonie declared. “You will accompany me wherever I go and protect me from all harm. You will do this for me, yes?”

“My life is yours to command, Your Majesty.” Prince Lionel bowed his head.

“Stand five steps to the left side below my throne. From this day forward, that will be your place.”

“Yes! Your Majesty!”

Prince Lionel walked towards his designated position with a smile. Several other young men and women stood along the steps that led to Empress Sidonie’s throne.

Standing on the right side of her throne was the Archmage of the Kraetor Empire. While two Sword Saints stood behind her throne.

On her left stood Priscilla. She was Empress Sidonie’s loyal retainer and one of her most trusted advisers.

Prince Jason, on the other hand, stood farther away to prevent himself from being too affected by Empress Sidonie’s charm.

After Prince Lionel stood in his place, the young Empress shifted her attention to the Second Prince of the Hellan Kingdom who had his head bowed and looking at the floor.

“Prince Rufus, do you want to regain your freedom?” Empress Sidonie asked.

Her soft, yet teasing voice made Prince Rufus’ heart tremble.

‘Even without looking at her, my heart can’t stop itself from beating wildly inside my chest,’ Prince Rufus thought with worry as beads of sweat started to appear on his forehead.

“Your Majesty, I would like to regain my freedom,” Prince Rufus replied. “The two of us have no grudges to each other and I pray that you show your mercy upon me.”

Empress Sidonie rested her right cheek over the palm of her hand. To be perfectly honest, she didn’t know what to do with the Second Prince of the Hellan Kingdom. Unlike the Crown Prince, Prince Rufus had been very polite to her when she was the guest of their Kingdom.

Also, she could somehow tell that the Prince already had someone in his heart. As someone who was pursuing the meaning of Love, Empress Sidonie felt that she shouldn’t tamper with Prince Rufus’ feelings and grant him amnesty.

Even Morgana, who was usually the one who was thirsty to turn everyone into slaves, remained quiet within their shared Mindscape. Empress Sidonie’s other half was giving her silent approval to whatever she decided to do with the Second Prince.

“Right now, the Southern Continent is ridden with danger,” Empress Sidonie said after careful consideration. “You will remain here as my guest and will be treated according to your rank and standing. From this day onwards, you will stay at the Left Wing of the Royal Palace. You will also be given a maid and an attendant to care for your daily needs.”

Prince Rufus breathed a sigh of relief in his heart because he could tell that the Empress had decided to spare him.

“Thank you, Your Majesty, for your mercy, and generosity,” Prince Rufus replied. “I promise to abide by your wishes and stay in my quarters. In the future, if Fate permits, I swear upon my life to return this kindness.”

“Good. May you honor your word, Prince Rufus.”

“I will, Your Majesty.”

Empress Sidonie made a gesture to the guards to escort the Second Prince to his new quarters.

Only when the two great doors of the throne room had closed behind his back, did Prince Rufus breathe a sigh of relief in his heart.

‘Brother, the lady you chose is a fearsome person.’ Prince Rufus’ body unconsciously shuddered as he was guided towards the Left Wing of the Royal Palace.

The Second Prince of the Hellan Kingdom knew that his older brother’s fate was now sealed in stone. Although there was no love between them as brothers, he still felt a pang of pity for his brother who had done everything in his power to claim the throne of the Hellan Kingdom.

Now, he was no longer a candidate to become king.

He was now a slave who had lost his freedom.

A slave that was similar to a dog, whose only wish was to lick his Master’s foot.

A slave whose fate would be decided by the mood of the beautiful Master he now served.

Prince Rufus said a silent prayer in his heart as his composure returned. He prayed that if Empress Sidonie ever decided to end his brother’s life, it would be a swift death, and not a slow, and painful, one.
