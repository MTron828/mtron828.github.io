Chapter 14: Cheat Codes

Fifteen minutes after they arrived in the dungeon, William and Ella found their first target. It was a lone goblin that was currently making a weird dance over a bonfire.

For safety reasons, William dismounted Ella’s back so the goat could fight without worrying about his safety.

“Eyah.” (Mama Ella, use Steel Armament.)

The goat took a fighting stance and her horns and hooves glittered for a brief moment. The Steel Armament Skill had a duration of an hour. It was a very useful skill that ensured that Ella’s primary weapons would be as hard as steel.

“Eyah!” (Use Quick Attack!)

“Meeeeh!”

William watched as Ella’s image blurred from where she stood. The next second, the goblin that was dancing on the bonfire leaked out a shriek, as its body flew a few meters away due to the impact.

Ella immediately used its hooves to stomp at the goblin’s face repeatedly. William half covered his eyes at the brutal scene in front of him. He only stopped covering his eyes when he heard the ringing sound of a notification.

[ Gained Exp Points: 60 ]

Current Exp: 424 / 1366

Job Exp (Shepherd Level 1): 140 / 200

Ella returned triumphantly by his side. The goat licked the baby’s cheeks to assure him that she was alright.

“Eyah!” (Good Job mama!)

“Meeeh!”

After taking care of two more goblins, Ella gained another level. Since Ella and William’s skill level is the same. Both of them gained a level together.

Current Exp: 544 / 1366

[ Shepherd Lvl 2 ]

Job Exp: 60 / 461

William went to Ella’s stat page and unlocked the skill Horn Assault. Since there was an extra skill point, he decided to place it on Horn Assault as well. As for the two stat points, he decided to place all of them in Ella’s Agility.

His battle plan for Ella was simple. He wanted her to be as nimble as possible for both attack and retreat. Since he had the Bestow Skill and the Wolf’s in Sheep’s Clothing, he didn’t need to worry about adding more points to strength for the time being.

William’s job level had also increased so he had three available stat points in hand. To be honest, he was really thankful for getting the “one free” extra skill point due to Gavin’s blessing.

He didn’t think twice and pooled all of his skill points to Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing giving a massive boost to Ella’s stat points.

With each extra stat and skill point in hand, William’s confidence also grew. He had seen how Ella fought against the goblin and it took her four attacks to kill it. The body of the goblin turned into particles of light and disappeared from the dungeon.

‘No dropped loots?’ William stared at the space where the Goblin died. Even the blood had also disappeared as if it was sucked up by the floor of the dungeon.

The two continued hunting for goblins. Half an hour passed and they still hadn’t encountered any other goblins aside from the one goblin they had fought earlier.

‘I wish this dungeon had a map,’ William thought. ‘It’s hard to explore blindl- um?’

The moment William thought of a map, a floor layout appeared in front of him. Seventy percent of the map was still shrouded in darkness. Only the places they had explored earlier were visible.

‘Hah! The saying ‘ask and you shall receive’ is true!’ William exclaimed as he looked at the map in front of him. ‘Are there other features that I can use aside from the navigation system? Can I use cheat codes?’

“Eyah!” (Greed is Good 999999!)

William looked around waiting expectantly for gold coins to appear in front of him. However, nothing happened. The baby curled his lip in disdain. William had the “Never Surrender” expression on his face as he shouted the cheat codes in the games he had played back on Earth.

“Eyah.” (Debug Mode1)

“Eyah. Eyah. Eyah. Eyah!” (Up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right, A, B, A, B, Select, Start!)

“Eyah.” (Toolup)

“Eyah.” (Turtle)

“Eyah.” (Offroad)

“Eyah.” (Rosebud)

“Eyah Eyah.” (Power Overwhelming)

“Eyaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.” (WhosYourDaddy)

William panted for breath as he finished shouting the cheat codes he was familiar with. A few minutes passed as an awkward silence enveloped the baby and the goat.

‘Aiya~ so this game needs to be cleared first before I can play the NG+ version? Fine. Challenge accepted!’ William thought as she gestured for his Mama Ella to allow him to mount her back.

With the map hovering in front of him, William navigated the cave with ease. He accidentally found a stairway that was headed downwards as he was clearing the undiscovered places in his map.

Frankly, he was half tempted to proceed to the next floor, but William was a completionist by heart. After a brief struggle, he decided to fully map the first floor before he proceeded to the second floor of the Goblin Crypt.

After an hour of walking around, they were finally able to clear seventy percent of the map. It was also at that moment when William saw two red dots in the space in front of them.

‘Finally,’ William thought. ‘Time for round two.’

“Eyah!” (Mama, use Quick Attack!)

“Meeeh.”

“Eyah.” (Sorry, Mama, I got carried away.)

Ella laid down on the ground so that William could dismount. William crawled to the corner to hide. Ella immediately charged at the two goblins to engage them in battle. The baby was so focused on the scene in front of him, that he didn’t notice the red dot on the map that was slowly creeping up behind him.
