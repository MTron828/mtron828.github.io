Chapter 306: The Jack Of All Trades Is A Useless Profession [Part 2]

Naturally, not all the Gods inside the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods got along. There were several factions that were formed due to the differences in ideals and goals.

David, Issei, Lily, and Gavin were part of the Neutral Faction. They were the faction that didn’t cater to any side. Lugh, on the other hand, was part of the Righteous Faction. They were the faction that detested Evil and would often quarrel with the Evil Gods in the Temple from time to time.

“So, this brat wants to touch my artifacts?” Lugh appraised the Teddy Bear in Lily’s hand as he scratched his chin. Naturally, he could see William’s soul and see the life he had lived before he was reincarnated.

However, before Lugh can even decide whether to agree to David’s request or not, the Teddy Bear in Lily’s hand spoke up.

“Let’s leave this place,” William said in a firm manner. “I don’t want to touch any of his things. It will only make me feel dirty.”

Although William was very tempted to touch the red spear behind Lugh’s back, he couldn’t accept the way Lugh referred to Gavin. William didn’t lie when he said that touching Lugh’s belongings made him feel dirty. He couldn’t understand it himself, but the thought of acquiring Job Classes with the God’s artifact disgusted him.

“Alright,” David nodded. “Sorry, Lugh. My Little Friend is a bit sensitive. I’ll treat you to a meal next time.”

“No problem. However, Oi, you brat,” Lugh stared long and hard at the Teddy Bear in Lily’s hands. “I have no obligation to help you. You are not my follower, so you mean nothing to me. So what if I ridiculed your Patron God? Do you think that just because all of us are Gods, we should hold each other’s hand and be friends? How Naive!

“Remember this, little boy. A Jack of All Trades is a Master of none. It’s a stupid profession. You’re better off finding other Gods to be your Patron God. Instead of trying to be a filthy hybrid.”

“Lugh, right?” Wiliam asked back. “What kind of God are you? You hold a blacksmith hammer, but carry a spear and a shield. Are you a Blacksmith or a Warrior? I think it’s about time you clearly thought about what your real profession is.”

William’s anger rose up inside his chest as he stared back at the God who thought too highly of himself.

It took a while for William’s memory to kick in, but he now remembered who Lugh was from the myths that he had read about him on Earth. William laughed out loud and his laughter was filled with ridicule and contempt. After remembering who Lugh was, he now understood why the “God of Blacksmithing” didn’t like Gavin.

“Isn’t it funny?” William grinned mischievously. “Someone who can also be considered a Jack of All Trades ridicules my Patron God. What a joke. It’s like the pot calling the kettle black. Simply ridiculous.”

“What did you say, boy? Can you repeat that?”

“There’s no need to repeat it. You’re just an imitation of Gavin. A God that was hailed as the Sun God, the God of Blacksmithing, the God of Arts, and the God of Justice, as well as a Warrior God.”

William shook his head and his face was filled with contempt. “A God of Many Professions, and not a Master of one. That is you, Lugh. Someone like you doesn’t have the right to ridicule Gavin. Lily, let’s go. I don’t want to stay here any longer.”

“I agree,” Lily smiled and walked away carrying William. However, she hadn’t walked far when Lugh appeared in front of William holding his spear in his hand.

“Boy, you dare to slander a God inside our own Temple?” Lugh asked. “You’ve got guts.”

David stood in between Lugh and William and made a gesture for Lily to back away. Lily took a few steps back, but she was secretly channeling her power into her hands. If Lugh was going to attack William, she would not just stand by and watch it happen.

Issei’s hand had also moved to the dagger on his belt. The Harem God had a smile on his face, but his eyes were looking at Lugh with the intention to kill. He had recognized William as his Sworn Brother, if Lugh were to attack him, that would be equivalent to declaring war on him as well.

“Lugh, the boy is still young and hotblooded,” David said. “Although he was at fault, he hasn’t lived long enough to understand the rules of the temple. Don’t worry, I will instruct him properly. Can you let his rude remarks pass?”

Lugh snorted and returned the spear behind his back. “David, you are my friend so I will give you face and turn a blind eye just this once. However, you’d better not let me see that brat again. The next time I see him, I’ll skewer his soul with my spear and personally throw him into the Cycle of Reincarnation.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

David nodded. He didn’t want to antagonize his friend and make things difficult for both parties. The Three Gods left Lugh’s stall without turning back. David sighed in his heart because they had missed a good opportunity to help William gain new Job Classes.

Not only that, William had also gained the ire of one of the Gods belonging to the Righteous Faction.

Of course, several Gods saw this incident and all of them looked at the Teddy Bear in Lily’s hands with varied expressions. Some of the Gods belonging to the Evil Faction laughed and gave William a thumbs up.

There was a famous saying that “The enemy of your enemy is your friend”. In the eyes of the Gods belonging to the Evil Faction, William did a good deed in antagonizing one of their enemies.

‘So this is the child that my follower has set her eyes on,’ A lady that reeked of beauty and sensual desires looked at William with an amused expression. ‘I don’t know if he is brave or stupid, but I like his eyes. Maybe, I should say hi to him before he leaves the Temple.’

Not far from her, another Goddess-who sat on a black throne-eyed William from afar. A smile was on her face as she looked at the Teddy Bear in Lily’s hands. Ever since William had appeared in the Temple, this particular Goddess had sensed his presence right away.

She watched as William trained inside Issei’s and Lily’s Domains.

She listened patiently as William told Ashe her story.

She watched how he treated his “mermaid wife” with love and care.

She watched… she watched… and she watched…

This was the only thing that she could do, for she knew that the time was not yet ripe for her to make her move.

‘Your soul still burns brightly, Little Will,’ the Goddess thought as she eyed the Teddy Bear from a distance. ‘Not even Ragnarok has diminished your light. I look forward to the day when I will personally snuff out that light inside your soul.’

The Goddess sighed in pleasure as she remembered that delicious taste from thousands of years ago. The taste of the Silver-Haired Warrior who fought side by side with the Gods of Asgard, in a battle that was fated to end in their demise.

“Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that,” the Goddess said softly. “Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.”
