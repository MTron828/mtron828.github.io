Chapter 436: Wars Doesn’t Prove Who's Right Or Wrong [Part 1]

Empress Sidonie lazily opened her eyes as she looked outside the window of her room. A sigh escaped her lips as she looked towards the West, where the Hellan Kingdom was located.

The kingdom where her beloved Half-Elf currently resided.

[ I bet you the entire Anaesha Dynasty that he’s not thinking about you. ]

Morgana teased Sidonie from within their shared Mindscape. Her other half would always look to the West whenever her mind wandered.

‘I know,’ Empress Sidonie replied. ‘Right now, we are too insignificant to catch his attention.’

[ Should we attack the Hellan Kingdom? That way, Darling will be forced to pay attention to us. Just send a million ants over and the capital will be yours in a matter of days. ]

‘That is too boring, Big Sister. We can’t win his heart by trampling on his homeland. In fact, it would only make him hate us, which is not something we want to happen.’

Morgana chuckled within their shared Mindscape. If Empress Sidonie had her way, conquering the Hellan Kingdom was an easy task. However, what she wanted to conquer was William’s heart, not the nation he lived in.

‘Several chess pieces are still missing,’ Empress Sidonie said as she walked towards the window. ‘It is still too early to make our move. Besides, there are still the Elves that are currently having fun in the Zelan Dynasty.’

[ Ah… the Elves. They will make good slaves. We should get some for the feisty boys in the Kraetor Empire. Have you noticed? Prince Jason is making it very obvious that he wants to pin you down in his bed. ]

‘He’s not qualified,’ Empress Sidonie replied as she thought of her ambitious Cousin. ‘How about you, Big Sister? Are you interested in him?’

[ Hahaha. Surely you jest? The only one that I want to ravage me is Darling. Prince Jason may be handsome, and an excellent warrior, but my heart only beats for Darling. ]

Empress Sidonie smiled sweetly. The power of Lust was slowly awakening inside her body. Her desire to make William fall head over heels for her would sometimes cloud her reason, but thanks to her strong will power, she was able to brush it away.

Love and Lust had a very thin boundary between them. What Empress Sidonie wanted was Love. Morgana wanted Lust.

They loved, and lusted over, the same man and it was driving both girls to do things they had never done before. It was driving them to feel things they have never felt before.

[ Sidonie, the Elves will finish their teleportation gates in less than two months. Our side needs two months. If we don’t act soon, the advantage we have will be for naught. Our warriors may be strong, but they are still young. When the Elven reinforcements arrive, it will be too late to do anything. ]

‘Don’t worry, Big Sister,’ Sidonie replied with a calm expression. ‘I already thought of a way to deal with that matter.’

[ Oh? Pray do tell. Don’t hide things from me. ]

Empress Sidonie giggled as her eyes looked at the setting sun. how could she possibly allow the Elves to have their way? In her eyes, they were just chess pieces that she could use to make her game of Love much more interesting.

William’s flying carriage landed at the Ainsworth Residence.

It had been two weeks since Oliver had passed Ezio’s message to him, and he had done everything that he could in that span of time.

Since he was able to access the Dungeon of Atlantis no matter where he was, he decided to return to the Town of Lont in order to formulate his plan to prevent the Elves from completing their teleportation gates.

“Will!” Eve shouted as she ran towards William who had just stepped out of the flying carriage.

William grinned as he picked up his beloved niece and spun her around, making the little girl giggle in happiness. Seven ducklings chirped from beside his feet as if telling him to put their Mama down.

The White Goose, on the other hand, stayed a few meters away from William and gave him an appraising glance.

‘Not the same, but similar,’ the White Goose thought as he used his sensitive senses to examine the Half-Elf who was showering Eve with kisses on her cheeks.

Unlike Eve who was overflowing with Spiritual Power, William’s presence was only average. However, due to the White Goose being at the peak of the Millennial Rank, it was able to subtly feel the power of the Divinities within William’s body.

This made it consider William as someone that it needed to take precaution against, because for some odd reason, it had a feeling that even if it used its full power, it wouldn’t be able to defeat the Half-Elf in a one-on-one battle.

“Were you a good girl while I was away?” William asked.

“Yes!” Eve nodded her head like a good girl.

“Good. I will give you your favorite lollipops later.”

“Yay!”

William grinned as he carried his niece back inside the house. Est, Ashe, Wendy, and Isaac followed behind him. The four girls already knew how much William cared for his family members. Seeing William spoiling Eve made them think that the Half-Elf would definitely dote on his own children when they were born.

The Ainsworth Residence became a lively place after William’s arrival. Leah and Isaac worked together in the kitchen to prepare a feast for everyone.

Crown Prince Alaric and Princess Aila also arrived at the residence in order to meet and talk with William. They brought Paul along, so the latter could finally meet the person whom Prince Alaric had mentioned several times during their stay in the Town of Lont.

“It’s good to see you again, Cousin.” Prince Alaric greeted with a smile.

William smiled and made a gesture for Alaric, Aila, and Paul to join them at the dining table.

“You came at the right time,” William replied. “I was planning to look for you later after lunch to talk about important matters.”

The smile on Prince Alaric’s face widened because he had a hunch about what William’s important talk was about.

“Good.” Prince Alaric nodded. “I look forward to our discussion later.”

The two teenagers exchanged a knowing glance with each other before committing themselves to enjoying the feast that Leah and Isaac had prepared. The atmosphere was quite lively. No one talked about the invaders or the hardships that they were currently facing.

Everyone knew that this was not the place for that and simply enjoyed each other’s company.

Two hours later, William and his entourage, Celine, Jekyll, Prince Alaric, Princess Aila, and Paul, sat in the conference room inside the residence.

All of them looked at William and waited for him to start their discussion.

William briefly scanned the faces of everyone in the room. The smiles from earlier were gone, and everyone had serious expressions on their faces. The Half-Elf knew that now was a good time to start the discussion, so he finally told them the reason he had returned to Lont.

“Right now, there is only a month remaining before the teleportation gates of the Elves begin their operation,” William said. “We can’t allow this to happen, so I have decided to go to the Zelan Dynasty and meet up with Fourth Master to destroy it.”

William then glanced at the Crown Prince who was forced to flee from his own Dynasty. He knew that if he wanted to increase his chances of success, he would need people who were familiar with the lands and cities of the Zelan Dynasty.

That way, he would be able to effectively initiate an attack whenever he wanted.

William had long wanted to test his mettle against the Elven Prodigies that his Master had praised many years ago during his training. He wanted to know just how strong they were. That way, he could make an assessment to know if his own private force would be able to deal a devastating blow to their forces when they clashed on the battlefield.
