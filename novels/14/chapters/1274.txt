1274 Dammit! Stop Pushing Responsibilities On Me!

After dinner, Arwen talked to William about a lot of things. This included the current state of the Silvermoon Continent.

In truth, after the Council was dissolved, nobody else had the power to decide things for the Elven Race.

Even the Royal Family couldn’t decide anything in fear that William might sneeze in their direction from thousands of miles away.

In short, no one, aside from the Half-Elf, could dictate what the Elves could do. That was fine in itself, but there was one problem.

William wasn’t always in the Silvermoon Continent, and he had no interest in running Kingdoms, and Empires, which led to the current problem.

Who would call the shots when the Dark Prince was nowhere to be found?

This was the question that all the high-ranking members of the Elven Families had, since everyone typically just listened to whatever their Patriarchs were telling them.

“I’m the Saintess of the World Tree and my job is to look after your father,” Arwen said. “Also, I am not cut out to carry big responsibilities. My father, your no-good-grandfather, can act as a steward, but knowing him, he would just do it half-heartedly.

“If only your grandfather, James, were here, I’m sure that things would run smoothly, but since he’s off to who-knows-where, we’re just stuck waiting for you to make decisions, and we both know that you don’t like doing that for the entirety of the Elven Race, right?”

William nodded his head. Since he had no intention of handling the affairs of the Ainsworth Empire or the Demon Continent, he left it all to Nisha.

The Half-Elf believed that even though his secret mistress was very capable, controlling his Empire, as well as the Demon Realm, had already made her hands full. Adding more would just make things spiral out of control, so the Half-Elf decided to put in a figurehead that would lead the Elven Race.

“Have Eowyn become the temporary Steward of the Elven Race, and make my grandfather, Aenarion, her Minister,” William commented. “I’m sure that the two of them will do just fine in my absence.”

Arwen nodded his head because right now, this was the best course of action. Although Princess Eowyn was still far from becoming a monarch, she had experienced many hardships, allowing her to find solutions to most of the problems that the Elven Race was facing.

After discussing with Arwen the final details of the plan, William used the authority of the World Tree to send a Continental Message to every drow, and elf, living in the Silvermoon Continent.

“From this day onwards, I delegate the Fourth Princess, Eowyn Elbereth Nienna, as the Steward of the Silvermoon Continent,” William declared. “Her word is my word, and anyone who dares to defy or manipulate her words, in any which way, will be subjected to the worst execution possible.

“The one who will help her carry out her duties as the Steward of this land will be none other than my grandfather, Aenarion. I expect all of you to follow their words, because those who don’t will regret it for the rest of their pitiful and long life.”

After William’s speech ended, all the drows, as well as the members of the Royal Family, couldn’t help but think of the beautiful Elf Princess who had single-handedly handled the evacuation of the Elf children before the war started.

They were quite impressed on how Princess Eowyn managed it, and they were starting to think that she might just be able to lead them, on behalf of the Half-Elf who was usually nowhere to be seen.

Aenarion, who was smoking his pipe outside of their Family’s Main Residence, almost choked after hearing William’s words.

“Dammit! Stop pushing responsibilities on me!” Aenarion shouted at the sky. “I’m already old! I want to retire!”

Unfortunately, William, as well as Arwen, were too far away to hear his complaints. Even if they were near, they would have just completely ignored him, forcing him to work regardless of how he felt about it.

If James was there, he would have clicked his tongue, and wagged his fingers at William’s other grandpa, who didn’t even have a tenth of his shamelessness.

“You’re already this old, and you still don’t know how to scam people? Shame on you.”

That would have been James’ comment towards Aenarion if he was still in Hestia. Unfortunately, the Old Bandit of Lont had already returned to the Void and continued his journey to visit the different realms that the Army of Destruction were currently raiding.

Princess Eowyn, who had just seen and heard William’s declaration, felt a complicated feeling rise in her heart. She was the one that talked to her Master, Arwen, about the problems that plagued their race.

Never in her wildest dreams would she have thought that just a few hours after that, she would be delegated as the Stewardess of the entire Silvermoon Continent!

Princess Eowyn wanted to cry because William irresponsibly tossed such a big responsibility to her without batting an eye.

Fortunately, another poor soul had been tasked to help her, which was William’s grandfather, Aenarion, who was currently cursing his no-good-grandson.

If the Pope only knew how casually William treated the Domains under his control, she might have coughed up a mouthful of blood and strangled the Half-Elf for being useless.

If all of those territories belonged to her, she would definitely use everything in her power to ensure that every resource and manpower belonging to those lands were firmly grasped in her hands.

What the beautiful Elf Princess and the middle-aged Elf didn’t know was that William was laughing evilly in his heart, after he had finished tossing the responsibility to the two of them.

Although many might think that his decision was kinda abrupt, he had thought hard about it, and came to the conclusion that this was the best scenario for the Silvermoon Continent.

Although they had been turned into drows by him, William was confident that the Elves didn’t want a Half-Elf to rule them. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Since that was the case, they would willingly follow Princess Eowyn’s order, even if she was just a figurehead who was following William’s orders.

Even though the Dark Prince was still the one giving the orders, they would gladly turn a blindeye to this, and pretend that the order came from the Princess, who was of pure Elven blood.

It might look and sound stupid from an outsiders point of view, but for the Elves who cared about their heritage, this was enough to keep them satisfied, and allow the Silvermoon Continent to function properly even if William was away.
