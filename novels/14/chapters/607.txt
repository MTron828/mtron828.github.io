Chapter 607: Devil’s Floor [Part 2]

Lightning snaked around William’s body as the power of Stormcaller burst forth. He knew that this was a critical time, so he intended to get serious and use the power of his Prestige Class. He hadn’t been spending his time idly in the Southern Continent after the war with the Elves.

William knew that he needed more power once he stepped into the Central Continent and didn’t stop training his other Job Classes in the Dungeon of Atlantis.

[ Understood. ]

As soon as the Job Class was activated, a dozen clones appeared in front of William. This was the Clone Skill that was available in the Ninja Skill Tree. Ninjas were known for their agile movements, assassination abilities, and ninjitsu.

One of their specialties was to create clones of themselves that aided them in battle.

The Prestige Class Ninja was acquired when William visited the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods. Its requirements were the Geomancer, Stalker, and Archer Job Classes.

The Stalker Job Class was the next form of the Thief Class. As for the Archer Class, William had maxed this Job Class long ago. The Geomancer class had been trained by Ashe, which also allowed it to reach the necessary level requirement.

Two years after the war in the Southern Continent ended, William focused his attention in unlocking the strong Prestige Classes like the Elemental Lord and Ninja to boost his repertoire in battle.

Each clone possessed 50% of Wiliam’s strength. However, instead of holding Stormcaller in their hands, they were wielding various weapons.

Five of them were wielding swords called Ninjato, which was the default weapon of the Ninja Clones. The other five held Kama in each hand, while the last two held crossbows.

(A/N: Kama is a form of sickle.)

A dozen clones was the maximum number that William could create right now. If he wanted to have more clones, he would have to upgrade the Ninja Job Class to its final form, Shadow Sovereign.

Although these dozen clones were weaker than William, they gained all the buffs of William’s King’s Legion, which increased their stats by a good margin. Also, there was another hidden trick to William’s close which was…

“”Quick Shot War Art Second Form!””

All the clones said in unison. At the same time, dozens of Yara-ma-yha-who, appeared at the path leading towards them. They were so fast and agile that they were able to walk on the wall itself.

The meter-tall Yara-ma-yha-whos opened their disgusting large mouths and jumped at William’s clones with the intention to cling on them like a koala. That way, they could wrap their arms around the clone’s body, sucking their blood, while their abnormally large mouth would devour their bodies starting from their head.

This scene would be perfect for a horror movie and was guaranteed to make anyone scream in fear. Chiffon was intimidated by their appearances, and numbers. Because of this, she unconsciously took a step backwards. That was how scary the scene was in front of her.

As the Bloodthirsty Devouring little vampires jumped in the air, the clones completed the war art they had prepared in hand.

“”Shotgun!””

Powerful Auras erupted from the tip of their weapons and pushed back the approaching Yara-ma-yha-whos including those that had jumped into the air to attack them from above.

William, on the other hand, raised Stormcaller and dozens of lightning bolts erupted from its tip, blasting the disgusting creatures away and severely wounding them.

*Chuckle*

One of the severely injured Yara-ma-yha-who raised its head and grinned. The injuries on its body were healing at a rapid pace, similar to the regeneration abilities of the trollhounds.

William snorted as Stormcaller once again crackled in preparation for the next attack.

His clones followed suit as they, too, prepared to use a more powerful war art to deal with the annoying Yara-ma-yha-whos whose regeneration made them a very annoying enemy to fight.

“”Quick Shot War Art Fourth Form!””

William and his clones roared.

“”Grand Bazooka!””

A loud explosion echoed within the maze as the Yara-ma-yha-whos cried out in pain from the attack that had torn their bodies apart.

Since the passage was not that wide, the effect of the Grand Bazooka was quite profound. All the Yara-ma-yha-whos who had attacked William were all blasted into bits.

William frowned because he noticed that the pieces of flesh on the ground started to wriggle. He had a very bad premonition, so he decided to obliterate them again for the second time.

However, before he could even do anything, Chiffon stepped forward and opened her mouth. The wriggling pieces of flesh were helplessly sucked inside her mouth, making them unable to reform their bodies.

The surviving Yara-ma-yha-whos who saw this scene instantly panicked and ran away in fear. They were creatures who specialized in sucking the blood of others, and devouring them whole.

However, when they saw Chiffon do the same, their survival instincts kicked in. All of them chose to flee. They were not afraid of getting injured, or blasted into pieces because they could still regenerate and re-attach their bodies.

But, if they were devoured then that would be their end. This was why, instead of confronting the pink-haired girl, they chose to escape for the time being.

The maze had several other creatures in it aside from the Yara-ma-yha-who, so the little critters were confident that they would have their revenge. Soon, their chuckle once again echoed within the maze, making Chiffon cling to William’s arm in fright.

The Half-Elf sighed because he knew that this was only the beginning. There were blinking red dots on the map that were bigger than the Yara-ma-yha-who. The annoying little devouring vampires were troublesome enough, William only hoped that they would not encounter stronger monsters.

He was sure that the opportunistic little bastards would pay close attention to them, and wait for the right opportunity to go in for the kill.

“Let’s return to that dead end we found a little while ago,” William said. “It is not safe to travel right now. We need some rest.”

Chiffon was still shaken from the encounter, so she just nodded her head, while clinging to William’s arm.

They didn’t know that at the center of the maze, someone was paying close attention to their every move.

That being licked his lips in anticipation as he waited for his guests to arrive at his location. Even from that distance, it could hear the sound of William’s and Chiffon’s heartbeats.

“Yes. This is what I want to hear.” the being chuckled as it focused on Chiffon’s loudly beating heart. “The heart of someone with a strong Divinity. I can’t wait to pierce your chest, and take that small and innocent heart of yours from your body.”

The being once again chuckled as it resisted the temptation. He needed to ensure that his two guests would reach the center of the maze first. That way, he could start the real Trial of the 51st Floor.

A trial that would make the hearts of his prey, succulent and sumptuous. Hearts that he would eat, in order to break the seal that bound him inside the Tower of Babylon.
