Chapter 482: It Always Seems Impossible Until It’s Done

Twelve hours earlier…

Est visited the Magic Crystal Cavern like always to see if the golden snake was still sleeping.

“Dia, when are you going to wake up?” Est asked as she lightly rubbed the golden snake’s head with her finger.

Suddenly, the body of the golden snake glowed faintly.

Dia opened her eyes and raised her head to look at the person that was looking at her with a shocked expression.

As a beast that had been born from William’s blood, Dia, Thor, and Ragnar shared William’s memories. This was why Thor liked Wendy, and Ragnar disliked Ian.

This was before Ian had saved William’s life by transforming into her true form. After Ragnar had awakened, William’s memories passed through him, so his attitude towards Ashe also had a complete reversal.

Dia also knew that Est was William’s first friend outside of Lont. The golden snake already had a good impression of him before, but when William’s memories flowed through her, Dia’s perception of Est changed as well.

“Mama?” Dia asked telepathically.

The sound of her voice was like a two-year-old girl calling out to her mother.

Est immediately felt a ticklish sensation in her heart as she caressed the top of Dia’s head with her finger.

“Yes,” Est replied. “I’m your Mama.”

“Papa?”

“He’s not here.”

The Golden Snake then crawled on top of Est’s hand and slithered towards her shoulder. Est had already seen how the snake loved to coil itself around William’s neck and rest her head on the boy’s head.

Dia was now longer compared to before and was now three-feet-long. However, for some reason, she decided to revert to her former size, as she coiled herself up around Est’s neck.

“Mama, let’s go find Thor and Ragnar,” Dia said. “I want to see them.”

“Okay.”

Est then happily went to find Thor and Ragnar inside the Dungeon of Atlantis, where the three siblings were finally reunited. The three of them played together, and that was the reason why Thor and Ragnar weren’t with Wendy and Ashe, who had gone to the Villa’s indoor bath with William.

Going back to the present time…

As much as William wanted to go and look for Dia and Est, he knew that finishing his task was his current priority.

After enjoying some skinship with his two lovers, William returned to the real world and headed for the Plaza earlier than planned. The Warriors of the Minotaur Race saluted him when he made his appearance.

William gave them all a brief nod before heading to the center of the plaza and sat cross legged. Just like last time, he channeled the power of his Shepherd Job Class. Particles of green light flowed out from his body, which in turn flew towards the Minotaurs that surrounded him.

Ariadne looked at this scene from a distance, and nodded her head in appreciation. Just like her promise to King Minos, Ariadne had already given the orders to prepare for war.

Those that had been cured had already mobilized to procure the materials, and equipment that they would need for the battle that would commence as soon as William finished his promise to King Minos.

The King of the Minotaurs was right. They had already broken their oath once, they couldn’t break it again.

“It always seems impossible until it’s done,” Ariadne said with a smile. “I’ll see you later, Sir William.”

Ariadne gave William one last glance before turning her head to leave. She would return when William had reached his limit and bring him back to the residence to rest. According to her estimate, it would take seven to ten more days before all the warriors of the Minotaur Race were ready for battle. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Inside the Azure Fortress…

“How is he?” Drauum asked as it stared at the unconscious Eneru who was lying on the bed.

“He suffered a serious injury,” Ezkalor replied. “Also, his rank has regressed.”

Drauum clicked its tongue as it looked down on Eneru with contempt.

“He was a fool to go there all alone,” Drauum said. “However, this also gave us a piece of vital information. The Hellanians have some sort of Trump Card that can injure us to this extent.”

Ezkalor nodded. Although he didn’t like Eneru’s arrogance, the fact remained that both of them were on the same side. They were waiting for Eneru to wake up in order to ask him a few questions.

Knowing how he received his injuries was the first step in understanding the abilities of their opponent.

“Should we continue our march when the Main Army gets here?” Ezkalor asked.

This was the most pressing question at hand. It had already been a day since Eneru was brought back to the Fortress and the bulk of their army was expected to arrive the next day.

Drauum became silent as it pondered Ezkalor’s question. After a few minutes, it finally came to a decision.

“We will let the Army rest for a day before continuing our advance towards the Capital City of Gladiolus,” Drauum answered. “Don’t tell anyone about Eneru’s regression, but you can disclose that he got injured when he went to scout out the enemy’s capital. This will allow the Elves to think of countermeasures for whatever those puny mortals can throw at them.”

Ezkalor wanted to say that it was a puny mortal that had saved the entire Silvermoon Continent from a Demon Invasion. However, he didn’t do that. Drauum was a prideful being, and it would not admit that it was once helped by a mortal man, who had made the world tremble at one point in history.

“You look after him,” Drauum said as it turned around to leave.

Since there was nothing it could do for Eneru, the Ancient Golem decided to return to its role of guarding the fortress from surprise attacks.

Ezkalor watched him go with a sigh. He then turned his attention back to the sleeping Qilin, who had lost its right arm.

The Elder Dragon knew that Eneru had the ability to escape from any kind of attack because he could move very quickly. However, even someone as fast as him wasn’t able to prevent himself from getting injured.

Ezkalor frowned as he once again examined Eneru’s injury. He hoped that by doing so, he could find the answers that he was looking for.

Sadly, even after repeated diagnosis, he still couldn’t come up with an answer. The only thing that he could do was wait.

Wait for the Qilin to wake up and tell them what exactly happened when he went to the Capital of the Hellan Kingdom to vent out his anger and frustration.
