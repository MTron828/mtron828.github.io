[Disclaimer: This chapter contains scenes not suitable for young audiences. You’ve already watched enough “H” to know what I’m talking about. Also, please answer the comments I placed on my author notes. It is very important. Thank you.]

“Leah, you don’t have to force yourself, you just recovered from your injury,” Matthew tried to persuade his lover to stay in their hiding place until she was fully recovered.

“No.” Leah shook her head. “If I stay here, I’ll go crazy worrying about you.”

They were currently hiding inside a cave within the Lair of the Ancient Queen. They were part of the group that was tasked to break the Dungeon Core and end the threat of the Monster Outbreak.

The dungeon had 50 Floors, and their team of a hundred people managed to reach the 40th floor before they were stopped by a monster army that seemed to have waited for their arrival.

Three Class S Corrupted Lamia Queens, along with a horde of Class C Lamias, ambushed their group from different directions. The battle was intense, but they managed to defeat two of the three Lamia Queens while fighting with everything they had.

During the battle, several soldiers were charmed by the Lamia Queens and turned against their compatriots. Matthew was one of the few men who managed to resist the Charm Spell. However, the Lamia Queen used that opportunity to close the gap and deliver a powerful tail attack that sent Matthew slamming into the wall of the dungeon.

The Lamia Queen threw its poison dagger as a finishing blow to end Matthew’s life, but Leah blocked it using her body. Because of this, she was seriously injured and poisoned at the same time. If not for her Affinity with Water Magic, she might have died along with Matthew in that fight.

In that moment of desperation, she used her Water Teleport Ability to bring herself, and Matthew, to a random place in the dungeon with a body of water.

Fortunately, they landed at the base of a waterfall that had a hidden cave behind its falling waters. The unique location allowed them to hide themselves without worrying about the monster’s pursuit. Leah managed to purify the poison in her body using her Water Magic, but it had weakened her greatly.

Even so, she still used her healing magic to tend to Matthew’s injuries, which almost made her collapse completely. She only closed her eyes to rest when Matthew finally regained the color in his face.

A few hours passed before Matthew awoke from his sleep. When he saw Leah’s pale expression, he immediately used the potions he had exchanged points for in the academy to nurse her back to health.

A day later, Leah woke up and the two embraced each other for a long time. They were thankful that both of them were still alive and in each other’s arms.

Matthew became silent as he hugged his fiance. He lovingly kissed her forehead and Leah could feel the love he had for her. Both of them knew that they couldn’t stay in the cave forever. Matthew volunteered to scout their surroundings and find out whether it was possible to escape from the dungeon.

However, Leah didn’t want him to go alone, and insisted that he take her along with him.

“Matthew, don’t leave me here,” Leah pleaded as she hugged the man she loved. “If you do, I’ll make you regret it.”

“I won’t,” Matthew whispered. “If this is really what you want then I’ll agree, but I have a condition.”

“I agree.”

“I haven’t said anything yet.”

“Whatever it is, I agree.” Leah softly patted Matthew’s back as she closed her eyes to lean on his chest. “I don’t want to lose you.”

Matthew hugged her tighter because he, too, didn’t want to lose her. “Leah, after this is all over, let’s get married.”

Instead of answering Matthew’s proposal, Leah held both sides of his face and kissed him passionately on the lips. Her sudden action ignited Matthew’s feelings for her and soon, both of them were lost in their love for each other.

Leah laid within the makeshift bed that they had made inside the cave and looked up at Matthew with teary eyes.

“Are you sure about this?” Matthew asked.

“Yes,” Leah answered. “I don’t know what the future holds for the two of us, but right now, all I want is to be one with you.”

Matthew lowered his face to kiss his beloved and wiped the tears from her eyes.

“I love you, Leah.”

“I love you, too, Matt.”

Matthew kissed his lover one more time before removing the academy uniform that hid her beautiful body. He stared at the white, thin pieces of fabric that covered Leah’s womanly assets and removed them one after the other.

Although the cave was a little dark, Matthew had learned the spell Dark Vision because he often accompanied William for nighttime strolls in the countryside. He had also applied the Dark Vision to Leah, so both of them could see in the darkness of the cave.

Matthew fell into a daze as he looked at his lover’s beautiful body. Leah giggled on their makeshift bed and allowed him to look at her entirety. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You’re beautiful, Leah,” Matthew said with genuine sincerity as he lowered his head to kiss those enticing peaks that stood proud in front of him. He kissed her left breast as his hand groped the other.

Leah’s breast fit perfectly in the palm of his hand and he was surprised at how soft it was. Soon, the cave was filled with muffled moans as Leah did her best to hold back her voice.

Matthew only stopped fondling her body when his lover begged that she couldn’t hold it any longer. He kissed Leah’s lips one more time, before he lowered his hip to complete their union.

The moment Matthew claimed her maidenhood, a soft gasp of pain and pleasure escaped Leah’s lips. Matthew didn’t rush and gently brought his lover to the throes of pleasure. With every thrust of his hips, Leah could feel herself opening up to him.

Soon, both of them reached the peak together.

Matthew shuddered as he released his essence deep inside her. Staining her with his color and marking her as his woman.

He filled her up to the brim with his love.

Leah, on the other hand, felt like she was melting. It was as if she was being conquered, which brought shivers down her spine. The pleasure it brought her was so intense that for a brief moment, her world turned completely white.

When she regained her vision, Matthew was panting while hugging her body close to his chest. She shuddered in delight at the thought of doing it all over again.

As if hearing her thoughts, Matthew kissed her lips passionately and once again moved his hips to bring her to the heights of pleasure.

Within that dark cave, Matthew and Leah made love to each other as if there was no tomorrow. When they finally stopped, Leah laid her head on Matthew’s chest and fell asleep due to exhaustion.

Matthew enclosed his beloved in a protective embrace, before he, too, closed his eyes to sleep.

Meanwhile, in Celine’s house…

The beautiful dark sorceress was looking at her crystal ball with a calm expression. She was observing the Dungeon Outbreaks that were happening in the Hellan Kingdom through the eyes of her familiars.

It wasn’t the first time that Celine had spied on the affairs of the Hellan Kingdom, so she was quite knowledgeable with the location of the important cities that the king had given special attention to.

She could see the vast hordes of monsters that were trying to make their way through the city, but were being stopped by the stubborn defenders who held their ground like their lives depended on it.

Celine knew that her Potion of Miasma was not enough to corrupt a Dungeon Core completely, so she assumed that the organization had used a powerful medium to increase its potency.

“So this was their plan all along,” Celine muttered. As a Dark Sorceress, she was aware that aside from the monsters, a hidden threat was currently creeping into the lands of the Hellan Kingdom.

“Tenth Circle Spell,” Celine said with confidence. “Is this a type of revenge on the Hellan Kingdom for banning the use of Dark Magic? Looks like my acquaintances are more ambitious than I originally thought they were.”

Celine wanted to laugh out loud, but she pushed down that urge using her amazing self control.

“Perhaps this is also a blessing in disguise… this kind of spell can’t be erased by Clerics or any users of Holy Magic.” The corner of Celine’s lips curled up into a sneer. “The only ones who can break this curse are Dark Magicians. When the King realizes what is going on, it will already be too late.”

Celine was impressed by the amount of planning that the organization had made for their operation. The Dungeon Outbreak was only a cover-up to serve as a distraction, while the real danger was slowly spreading like a swarm of ants that was marching across the land.

What Celine and the organization didn’t know was that a certain Shepherd, who was currently sound asleep, would make the castle that they had painstakingly built up in the sky, shatter into a thousand pieces.
