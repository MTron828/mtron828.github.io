Chapter 222: The Siscon Brothers

William was currently sleeping outside the Baron’s residence. The reason? He was increasing the level of his recently obtained Prestige Class while he rested.

William laid perfectly still on the bench as he slept peacefully.

Dia and Ragnar were sleeping on William’s stomach, while Ella laid on the ground beside him. After dealing with the Titanic Trollhound, William made it swore an oath not to attack any towns within the Hellan Kingdom.

As the “Guardian of the Herd” any oath made to him by beasts belonging to the herd would automatically fall under David’s jurisdiction.

After taking his trollhound army inside his Ring of Conquest, the red-headed boy finally returned to Amelia’s hometown to rest.

He was up all night and was thoroughly exhausted from the events that had transpired a few hours ago.

The Sun Knight Job Class was the Prestige Class he had received after acquiring Soleil from the King. After checking its description, William found out that the only way to increase the level of this Job Class was to absorb the sunlight during the daytime.

Even if he killed monsters, it would be of no use. This was why William always chose to equip the Job Class during the day in order to maximize its effects. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

While the red-headed boy was sleeping, Amelia and her family were discussing the outcome of the battle.

Earlier, before he went to sleep, William made a report to the Baron that the Titanic Green-Scaled Trollhound had left his barony and would no longer return.

Philip was very happy with the news and profusely thanked William for his hard work. He even intended to give him a proper reward for freeing him from the biggest headache that his barony had encountered for some years.

William politely declined the additional rewards and told Philip that he was only doing this in order to recruit Amelia in[into] his Knight Order.

“How old is he again?” Amelia’s mother, Sofia, asked.

“The Commander is only fourteen-years old,” Amelia replied.

“He’s fourteen, and you’re seventeen…,” Sofia thought out loud. “I don’t think there would be a problem if we betrothed you to him, right?”

“Mother!” Amelia’s face became beet red as she held onto her mother’s hand. “The Commander is already betrothed to someone. Don’t make things difficult for both of us.”

“I completely forgot about that Griffith girl,” Sofia grinned. “But, it’s fine. From what I’ve heard, the two of them are not keen on getting together. Isn’t that why the two of them are to have a duel in three years? This is a good time to form a connection with his family.”

“No means no!”

“Silly girl. I only want the best for you.”

Philip calmly sipped his tea from the side and allowed her wife to chat with their daughter. They had been married for a very long time and he knew that Sofia was only teasing Amelia because she had missed her terribly.

What he didn’t know was that Sofia was half-serious with her proposal. If she and James met, the two would certainly get along and even conspire to make William and Amelia have a “shotgun wedding”.

Fortunately, Lont and Bradford were on opposite ends of the kingdom and it would be difficult for either party to travel between the territories without using the teleportation gates.

“According to the rumors, your Commander is a shepherd, correct?” Philip inquired.

“Yes,” Amelia answered. “At least, that is what is written in the records.”

The Louise Family may only be a barony, but they were the most informed among the nobles in the Eastern Faction. Their information network was wide-spread because they maintained good relationships and formed strong connections with all of their neighbors.

Philip placed his teacup on the table as he looked at Amelia with a serious expression. “From what I saw last night, he is no “ordinary” Shepherd. He seems to be a Beast Tamer as well because he was able to summon multiple beasts at the same time.”

“T-That, I’m not sure,” Amelia lowered her head. “This was the first time I’ve seen Commander William fight.”

“Do you really plan to join his Knight Order?” Philip raised an eyebrow.

“I promised to join if he was able to solve the problem of our barony.” Amelia nodded. “Father, I don’t want to go back on my word.”

Philip and Sofia remained silent and simply looked at their daughter’s determined expression. Truth be told, they didn’t want her to do anything that would put her life in danger. Being part of a Knight Order may seem good on paper, but in reality, it was a very dangerous profession.

Since they were the King’s Private Army, they would be asked to take on covert missions that always affected national security. These missions would definitely involve danger, so the couple was not too keen about accepting Amelia’s decision.

Philip and Sofia were blessed with four children, and Amelia was the only daughter of their household. The two of them, and their sons, treated her like their treasure and would fight anyone who dared to hurt her.

They would not give that person face, even if he was the Commander of a Knight Order.

“Father, Mother, please, trust me,” Amelia pleaded. “I believe that the Commander will not sacrifice, or abandon, us when things get rough.”

Philip massaged his temple, while Sofia sighed. They could tell that they would not be able to dissuade Amelia from her decision, so there was nothing else to do but accept it.

As if waiting for that moment, three identical boys walked into the room in a hurry.

“We’ve heard from Uncle Mark that Amelia is here!”

“Where is she, old man?!”

“Don’t you dare hide our sister from us!”

Philip’s lips twitched as he did his best to stop himself from throwing fireballs at his triplets who were certified siscons.

Plenty of nobles had visited their barony to ask for Amelia’s hand, but all of them were sent away by the three overprotective brothers. They even said that they wouldn’t recognize anyone as Amelia’s future husband unless he could beat all three of them at the same time.

“Big Brother, Asher, Andrew, Aaron!” Amelia greeted them happily as she stood up to hug them one by one.

“Little Sister, why didn’t you tell us that you were coming back?” Asher asked. “Those blasted Trollhonds ruined everything and the merchants stopped visiting our barony. I was not able to buy a present for you.”

“Little Sister, did you miss me? I’m sure you did. After all, I am the one that loves you the most in this family,” Andrew interjected.

“Little Sister, are there any guys bothering you in the academy?” Aaron inquired with a tone laced with killing intent. “Just tell us and we will immediately go there to kil- I mean, talk to him about the meaning of life.”

“That’s right! Why did I forget about that?!”

“Sister, are there any scum that you want us to kill? Just say the word and it shall be done.”

“It’s a good thing I bought a new sword from the traveling merchant. He guaranteed its sharpness and I’ve been dying to find something to test it out on.”

Amelia’s smile widened because she could tell how much her Big Brothers loved her. They always pampered her and would always beat up the boys who bullied her when she was young.

All of them had brown hair and eyes like their father. Only Amelia inherited her mother’s green hair and eyes.

Philip, who was quietly listening to this scene suddenly had an idea. A mischievous smirk appeared on his face as he made a gesture for the three boys to look at him.

“Actually, there is a boy outside the residence that is planning to recruit your sister into his Knight Order,” Philip explained. “Your sister made a promise that if he was able to resolve our current situation, she would gladly be part of his personal Knight Squad.”

“What?! A bastard dares to put my beloved little sister in danger?!”

“What?! A bastard dares to make his move on my adorable little sister?!”

“What?! A bastard dares to think impure thoughts of my cute, innocent, and kind sister?!”

“”Unforgivable!””

The three boys spoke in unison and charged out of the residence. All of them wanted to find that bastard that had tricked their sister into joining his private army and tear him to shreds!
