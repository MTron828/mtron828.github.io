Chapter 1283 Lord Kazos l Am Rolling!

Five minutes later, several more lights shone on the rainbow colored Anteater, and his band members.

They were the popular upstarts of the Underworld, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that they had taken the Second Layer of the Underworld by storm.

The drummer of their band was a Minotaur, their guitarist was a Demonic Dog with one eye, and the Pianist was a Goblin Paladin.

"The song I am going to sing tonight is a very special one," Kasogonaga said. "It is our latest single, I Am Rolling!, so make sure to purchase the original copy after this concert is over. It is very cheap. Only a hundred Hell Credits per copy. The first one hundred copies of this are signed, but they cost ten thousand Hell Credits each. Grab one while supplies last."

Erinys and the Pangolins all clenched their fists. They planned to take all 100 of Kasogonaga's latest single and make sure that everyone in the "We Love Kazo" fanclub got one no matter what.

After hyping the crowd to buy his latest album, Kasogonaga glanced at his comrades and gave them a brief nod.

Erchitu tapped his drumsticks over his head three times, signaling that the performance was about to start.

Everyone quieted down as they waited for the rainbow-colored Anteater to begin his performance.

Using a mellow voice, Kasogonaga began to sing the first lines of his latest single, I Am Rolling!

(A/N: You can sing this song using the tune of American Pie, or The Saga Begins by Weird Al.)

‚Äî--

"A long, long time ago, I can still remember, when the Humans were under an attack," Kasogonaga sang while having a pained look on his face. "And I knew if I had my chance, I can make those people dance, and maybe, they'd be happy for a while."

The strumming of the guitars increased the solemnity of the song, making the readers feel as if their heartstrings were being plucked.

‚Äî---

"But the Elven Goddess' response didn't thrill us.

She nocked her bow and tried to kill us.

We escaped from that hag, but I fell down in Fort Nazz‚Ä¶

I can't remember if I cried,

When I was sealed in a block of ice.

But something touched me deep inside‚Ä¶

The day I met‚Ä¶ this boy."

‚Äî------

Suddenly, the piano and the drums came to life as Kasogonaga sang the Chorus of the song.

‚Äî-----

I am Rolling~

My~ My~ this red-headed guy~

Maybe Dark Prince someday later, now he's just a small fry~

He died in his world, and said to his beloved goodbye~

Wishing he and her would be under the same sky.

Wishing he and her would be under the same sky~

‚Äî---

The corners of William's lips twitched after hearing the chorus of the song. He didn't expect that the rainbow-colored Anteater was singing a song based on what was not only exclusive to him, but himself as well.

‚Äî---

Right after the chorus ended, the song became very lively, as the upbeat music of the piano, guitar, and drums, accompanied by Kasogonaga's cheerful voice, made the crowd wave their joysticks happily as they listened to its song.

‚Äî---

"Did you know the truth of love?

And do you have faith in the Gods above?

If your bestfriend Est tells you so~

Now do you believe in rick and roll?

Can Wendy heal your mortal soul,

And can Ashe teach you how to dance real slow~"

‚Äî

The Anteater shook its hips as the music intensified, making Erinys' and the I love Kazo Fansclub wave their joysticks more vigorously.

‚Äî--

"Well I know that Acedia is in love with him,

Cause the two were snu-snuing in Alfheim~

The two went off the roof~

And he made her a promise or two.

He then met Chiffon in a garbage dump.

And the girl was hungry and could eat a truck.

William my boy was out of luck

The day he met his loli wife."

*Chorus*

"I am Rolling~

My~ My~ this red-headed guy~

Maybe Dark Prince someday later, now he's just a small fry~

He died in his world, and said to his beloved goodbye~

Wishing he and her would be under the same sky."

‚Äî----

William covered his face with both of his hands because the rainbow-colored Anteater was basically singing his life story for everyone to hear. He didn't know if the feeling that was bubbling inside his chest was embarrassment, or the strong urge to go to the stage and strangle Kasogonaga, who was singing his heart's out.

‚Äî--

"Now for several years we've been on our own

And my scales are harder due to my rolling zone.

But that's not how it used to be.

So William went to the Demon Realm,

In a name he borrowed from the Hospital's Dean

And a voice that came from you and me~"

‚Äî--

"Oh, the Demons was impressed, of course

They thought he could bring balance to the Horde.

They went and followed the kid,

And that's one big gamble they did."

"Because the Demon Clans had so much fear

But William said "Now listen here."

Just stick it in your demon ears,

I will~ become the Demon Lord~"

‚Äî--

*Chorus*

"I am Rolling~

My~ My~ this red-headed guy~

Maybe Dark Prince someday later, now he's just a small fry~

He died in his world, and said to his beloved goodbye~

Wishing he and her would be under the same sky."

‚Äî--

The lively music then became mellow, as Kasogonaga once again had a pained expression on its face, completely reversing the happy mood that everyone had earlier.

‚Äî---

"We then went to the Ancient Ruins,

Cause William and Celine wanted to‚Ä¶

I frankly would've liked to stay."

‚Äî---

Kasogonaga paused for a brief moment before continuing the rest of the song.

‚Äî--

"Then we all fought in that epic war,

And it wasn't long at all before.

Our William fought to save the day~"

-----

"In the end, some Shadow Demons died.

Some demons blew up, and they were fried.

A lot of our friends were croaking,

The King's Legion was broken‚Ä¶"

"And the Demonic Dog I admire the most‚Ä¶

Met up with Princess Iron Fan and he got toast

Well, we're still here and she's‚Ä¶ a Thot.

But still‚Ä¶ we lost‚Ä¶ that war‚Ä¶

‚Äî--

With a tearful voice Kasogonaga continued the last verse of the song, as the rest of his band members joined him to sing the chorus.ReùíÇùíÇd the latest stories ùíên novùíÜlbin(.)com

"I am Rolling~

My~ My~ this red-headed guy~

Maybe Dark Prince someday later, now he's just a small fry~

He died in his world, and said to his beloved goodbye~

Wishing he and her would be under the same sky~"

‚Äî-

The rainbow-colored Anteater slowly waved its paw left and right, and the rest of the audience also slowly waved the glowsticks in their hands in response to their Lord Kazo's tearful voice.

The audience then sang along with him because they already knew that they just needed to repeat the chorus for the finale.

‚Äî--

"""We Were rolling‚Ä¶"""

"""My~ My~ this red-headed guy~"""

"""Maybe Dark Prince someday later, now he's just a small fry~"""

"""He died in his world, and said to his beloved goodbye~"""

"""Wishing he and her would be under the same sky~"""

""Wishing we and him would be under the same sky~"""

‚Äî---

The song finally ended and another thunderous round of applause and cheering shook the entire venue.

William who was watching his friends on the stage didn't notice the tears that had slid down the sides of his face. He had seen through his Sea of Consciousness how desperate his friends had fought in order to buy some time to allow him and the others to escape.

Ella, Elliot, Conan, Kasoganaga, Erchitu, Jareth, and many more, sacrificed their lives in order to allow him to escape. Back then, he cried tears of blood as he watched the deaths of everyone he cared for, and who cared for him in return.

They had indeed lost that war, and through it, William had also lost many things, including half of his soul.

As the loud shouts of praise from the crowd continued to reverberate inside the arena, the black-haired teenager who had come to reunite with his wives, and unexpectedly found his friends, cried silently amidst the cheers surrounding him.

Only those that had been present for the battle in the Demon Realm knew how dire the situation was. If not for the courage, and selflessness of several individuals, the Prince of Darkness might have been crushed in Ahriman's grasp before he was even born.
