Chapter 21: Stormcaller

“Will, are you sure about your decision?” James asked.

He returned to the living room after their guests had left their residence. Although he was still feeling angry because of the cancellation of the marriage agreement, he had a feeling that his grandson was up to something.

“Grandpa, do you think someone as handsome as me will have trouble finding a wife in the future?” William replied with a smile. “Besides, someone as great as me is destined to have many wives!”

“Spoken like a true Ainsworth.” James chuckled as he brushed the boy’s head. “Indeed. I have no doubt in my mind that the ladies will line up to have a chance to become your wives. After all, when I was your age, every girl in the village wanted me to be their future husband.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Anna did her best not to roll her eyes on the grandson and grandpa pair. She then turned her head to her husband and whispered in his ears.

“I’ve always known that father was a narcissist. However, I didn’t expect that William would also grow up to be one.”

Mordred sighed and sipped his tea. He had long known about this bad habit of his father’s and had gotten used to it while growing up. It seemed that being a narcissist was embedded in their genes.

“Hmp! That sl*t and her bastard husband will regret this in the future.” James snorted. “I bet that old fool will have a heart attack once he hears that it was his family who broke the agreement.”

James glanced at William who was happily eating a slice of apple pie. He still didn’t understand why his grandson asked Agatha and Eleanor to show him rare weapons. Those weapons would usually cost over a thousand gold coins if they were sold in a weapon shop.

“Um, Will, what were you thinking when you asked them to show you those rare weapons?” James asked.

Anna and Mordred’s ears perked up when they heard this question. Just like James, both of them were very curious as well.

William smiled and opened his hand. A few seconds later, a small ice cube floated mere inches above his palm. Then, the ice-cube disappeared and was replaced by a small flame. William’s demonstration didn’t end there.

The fire disappeared and a small orb of water floated in its place. When the orb of water disappeared, a gentle breeze was felt inside the room. Lastly, a piece of rock hovered above William’s palm and stayed there for a few seconds before vanishing without a trace.

James, Mordred, and Anna gasped in shock. All of them couldn’t believe what they saw. Their eyes landed on the boy who had a smug look on his face as if what he showed them was not a big deal.

“I have the ability to learn the powers of other professions as long as I am able to hold something that belongs to that profession,” William explained. “Of course, that doesn’t mean that I can instantly become proficient in them. Just like any apprentice, I need to start from scratch in order to make use of these powers and make them my own.”

William wasn’t lying. Although he had acquired several job classes, all of them were level zero. If he wanted to use them to their maximum potential, he needed to raise the corresponding job levels in order to unlock the specialized skills under his skill tree.

“D-do you have an affinity with lightning?” James stuttered.

“Affinity? No. I don’t have any affinity with any element,” William explained. “However, if I hold an artifact or weapon that is related to a particular profession, it is very possible for me to learn that profession.”

James and Mordred glanced at each other before the older one left the room in a hurry.

“William, you shouldn’t tell this to anyone,” Mordred advised. “You must keep this as a secret.”

“Uncle, the only reason why I told everyone my ability is because everyone present here is a family member.” William smiled. “If I can’t even trust my own family then whom should I trust?”

William took a risk when he showed everyone his ability. However, he believed that all of them would keep it as a secret. He never had a family in his past life. As an orphan, he never understood what it was like to have a family.

This was also why he decided to divulge his ability. He was willing to put his trust to the Ainsworth Family. Although it was a reckless move on his part, he had a feeling that this was the right thing to do.

“Will, thank you for your trust.” Mordred felt touched by his nephew’s sincerity.

Anna felt the same as her husband and looked at William with affection. She didn’t say anything because she felt that there was no need to say anything. Trust was something that couldn’t be expressed by words. Feelings alone should be enough.

Five minutes later, James returned to the room carrying a wooden box. The box had a very intricate design. There were symbols written on it in a language that William couldn’t decipher. It was over two-meters long and a foot-wide.

William assumed that the thing that was inside the box was a weapon. Seeing that his grandson’s attention was focused on the box, James slowly opened its lid.

A flash or purple light appeared as soon as the box was opened, and tendrils of purple lightning writhed in the air like little snakes.

“… this is?” William’s eyes sparkled as he saw the weapon inside the box.

“Its name is, Stormcaller,” James said with reverence. “It is the weapon of our great ancestor, Claude Von Ainsworth.”

“Stormcaller…” William looked at the spear in wonder.

The spear was at least, six feet long. The black handle was laced with a streak of gold like a lightning bolt. The blade of the spear was of a purple color, and one look was enough to tell William that this was not an ordinary weapon.

“Go on,” James urged. “Hold it.”

James wanted to see if William would be able to harness the spear’s power. He wanted to know if the prophecy of the Ainsworth Family would come to pass in his generation.

William gulped as he reached out his hand to hold the handle of the spear. Tendrils of lightning crawled into his hands, but it didn’t hurt him. Instead, it gave William a ticklish feeling.
