Chapter 140: I Fought For Love

The entirety of the First Year students lined up inside the Hall of the Martial Class Division. Since they were outsiders, the students of the Magic and Spirit Division classes stayed outside the premises and watched the viewing crystals in front of them

They were waiting for William’s first speech as the Head Prefect of the Solaris Dormitory.

Soon, a handsome Half-Elf with hair as bright as flames walked towards the podium. His light-green eyes were clear and bright as he faced the hundreds of students who were looking at him with serious expressions.

“Good day to all of you. My name is William, William Von Ainsworth,” William started his speech. “I am a shepherd that hails from the countryside of Lont.”

The buzzing sound of murmurs spread across the hall when William gave his introductions. Even those who were watching him from outside were surprised when he said that he was a shepherd from the countryside.

“I came here today, to tell all of you why I joined the competition for the position of Head Prefect,” William continued his explanation. He then looked at the entrance of the hall and made a gesture. “Mama, please, join me.”

The door of the great hall opened and a white and fluffy goat, that was only a meter tall, walked forward with confident steps. The students watched her go up onto the stage and stand by William’s side.

William lovingly placed his hand over Ella’s back and faced everyone in the room with a smile.

“Mama, please greet everyone.”

“Meeeeeeeh!”

The students looked at William and the goat with weird expressions, but the red-headed boy paid them no mind. Instead, he raised his chin in an arrogant manner and stated his reason. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes. The reason why I joined the competition was to ensure that my Mama Ella would be able to stay by my side during my stay here at the Royal Academy,” William said firmly. “Perhaps, some of you think that this is a very absurd reason. Others, may think that it was a stupid one. However, I beg to disagree. My Mama Ella is no ordinary goat. She was the one that raised me since I was a baby.”

William’s declaration brought another round of murmurs and even the instructors glanced at the goat with curious expressions.

“All of us have important people in our lives. People we care for, people we want to protect, and people we want to love,” William was unfazed by the murmurs and continued his speech. “They could be our parents, our brothers, sisters, grandparents, neighbors, friends, lovers, and acquaintances.

“But, let me ask all of you, is your love greater than mine? Is the love you have for your lover greater than my love for my Mama Ella?”

When William asked this question, many people wanted to answer, but William didn’t give them a chance to do that.

“The answer is simple, love cannot be measured,” William said tenderly. “I will not tell you that the love you feel for your loved ones is less than mine, because like I said, love cannot be measured. Yes, the reason why I fought in the competition was for love!

“I didn’t know how strong my opponents were, how cunning they were, and how determined they were to win. Because, in my eyes, these factors were not important. As members of the Martial Classes, there will come a time when we have to face opponents that are stronger than us, opponents that are way out of our league…

“When that time comes, our only choice is either to fight or to flee. I chose to fight, because my reason for fighting is for the one I love. Regardless of the consequences, no matter the price, I must win! And win, I did.”

The girls who had become William’s fans felt their heart flutter. The way he declared that he had fought the competition for love was so suave that they couldn’t keep themselves from imagining that the person he fought for was not the goat, but them.

Kenneth, who was watching William from below the podium, looked at him with tender eyes. He had already known how much William cared for Ella, but he didn’t know the extent of how much the red-headed boy loved his second mother.

Even Est had to admire that William’s speech moved him. Ian and Isaac felt the same. They too had people they cared for and wanted to protect. William was right, love was something that could not be measured.

The great hall descended into silence, as the students unconsciously clenched their hands. They could feel that their blood was boiling because of William’s reason for fighting. They had imagined themselves fighting against a foe that they couldn’t defeat. The majority of them thought of only one thing and that was to run and escape with their lives.

Somehow, they felt ashamed and inferior to William. They could feel his strong determination to win. Even those who initially held grudges towards him, found themselves unable to hate him. Those of the Martial Classes respect the strong, even if they couldn’t accept the outcome of the competition, they had to admit that they couldn’t achieve what William had done inside the Enchanted Forest.

“Of course, I know that some of you are dissatisfied with me.” William smiled and casually flipped his hair. “But, what of it? I admit that some of you may be stronger than me, but physical strength alone doesn’t win battles. The fact that the one standing here is me and not you means that my determination to win is stronger than yours.

“If you feel that I’m not worthy of my position then feel free to challenge me…,” William declared. “But, only after you have defeated all of the candidates that participated in the competition. This is only right and proper, no?”

Excuse me? Do you think you can challenge the final boss without fighting the underlings first? Sorry, not happening!

Est, Ian, and Isaac smirked when they heard William’s shameless words. He allowed the students to challenge him, but they had to fight everyone before they earned the right to challenge William.

William was not a fool. If they wanted to fight him then he would definitely make them suffer first. However, to ensure that they wouldn’t do the shameful act of “not fighting against the challengers” the red-headed boy decided to throw in some insurance.

“We are martial students. If we don’t even dare to accept challenges then we should just pack up and leave the academy,” William said in a righteous manner. “As the Head Prefect of the Solaris Dormitory, I will expel any student who doesn’t fight in a serious manner! Now, who wants to challenge me? Raise your hands!”

Drake and Spencer resolutely raised their hands. They were still unresigned by what had happened in the competition. Both of them knew that none of the First Years were their match, so they were not afraid of one-on-one battles.

William sneered internally as he gave the two boys a refreshing smile. “Since the two of you are bold enough to challenge me then I will grant you a battle you will never forget.

“I, William Von Ainsworth, hereby order that all the members of the Solaris Dormitory will fight these two brave souls at the same time. Yes it will be the Solaris Team vs Drake and Spencer! Anyone who performs exceptionally will be given the position of Vice-Prefect!”

All the students gasped in surprise. Vice-Prefect? Isn’t that almost the same as becoming the Head Prefect? Under one person, but above hundreds of students, this was a position that could be considered as the next best thing!

Priscilla had agreed to become William’s Vice Prefect in the Enchanted Forest, but she felt that she was undeserving of the role. This was also the reason why she talked to William to have their contract revoked. The red-headed boy admired the black haired beauty’s resolution so he agreed to her request.

William felt that if he forced Priscilla to become his Vice-Prefect using the contract, it would just make things awkward for the both of them. Since that was the case, he planned to award the position of Vice-Prefect as a prize to the person who would perform exceptionally in this scheme that he had concocted.

All the First Years stared at Drake and Spencer as if they were the most delicious food that they had seen in their lives. Some of them were already itching to start the battle and become the Vice-Prefect of the Solaris Dormitory.

“Shameless!” Ian almost spat on the ground. “This fool really knows how to take advantage of his position.”

All the admiration he had for the boy earlier had evaporated into thin air.
