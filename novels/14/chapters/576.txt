Chapter 576: Kawabangga Motherf*ckers! [Part 1]

“What’s the next test?” William asked. “We just need to win one more and we can proceed to the next floor, right?”

Oogwei nodded its head. “Right. Just one more win and you guys can proceed to the next floor.”

After Chiffon won her fight, William realized that the test that was given by the little turtle, wasn’t something that could be easily overcome by any ordinary person.

If Chiffon wasn’t the personification of Gluttony, William had no doubt in his mind that they would have lost the first match. Only people with the Devour ability like Jekyll, and Chiffon, would be able to rise up to the challenge.

William looked at the three remaining Demi-Turtles and clicked his tongue internally.

‘If each of them specialized in something that we are not capable of, the chances of us winning are slim,’ William thought. ‘I just hope the next test will be easy.’

Oogwei may not be able to read minds, but William’s expression told it what it needed to know. In fact there were several players whom the little turtle had taken an interest in.

It would meet them on its floor and allow its disciples to challenge them all. Some of these players had failed miserably due to a difference in specialty, and had to stay in his domain until they either succeeded, or surrendered.

Those who surrendered were kicked out of the tower where they had to redo everything from scratch.

Oogwei was one of the pacifist Guardians of the Tower of Babylon. For it, finding worthy players was a pastime, and it liked to test them personally each time they appeared in its domain.

“Who wants to go next?” Oogwei asked its disciples.

“I will go next!” Leonardude stepped forward.

However, before Leonardude could say the details of its challenge, it was dragged away by Donutella, and Michalangelhoe. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Whatever you do, don’t challenge them in an eating contest,” Donutella whispered. “You’ve seen that girl’s ability, right? The ending will be the same. Although you are our team’s greatest eater, and I am the greatest drinker, we won’t win against her!”

Leonardude nodded its head. “I know. Don’t worry, the one that will be eating will be us, and not her.”

Michaelangelhoe heard its two siblings and understood what Leonardude was planning.

“So, you’re going to do that, right?” Michaelangelhoe whispered.

“Exactly,” Leonardude smirked.

“You’re playing dirty.”

“This is called tactics. There is nothing dirty about it.”

The three Demi-Turtles exchanged glances and smiled evilly.

William’s sensitive hearing was able to hear their conversation. However, what the three talked about was not enough to give him a hint of what the next test was going to be.

“Okay, this will be your next test,” Leonardude snapped its fingers and a portable kitchen appeared in front of it. “Your next test is that you will cook me some food. If I like it, you will pass my test.”

“That’s it?” William inquired.

“That’s it,” Leonardude replied. “Easy, right?”

Donutella, Michaelangelhoe, and Narnyah~ snickered internally. This was a trick that Leonardude always pulled when it planned to fail a player. Even if the food was delicious, it would say that it was trash, automatically making the challenger fail.

Oogwei sighed internally because it could tell that its disciple was at it again. This was not the first time Leonardude did this, but the little turtle didn’t prevent it from doing so. It believed that if the players were fated to win, not even this dirty trick was enough to stop them from climbing the tower.

“Very well, I will be the one to take this challenge,” William walked towards the portable kitchen and checked the tools that were available. They were the same cooking equipment that were commonly used in the world of Hestia, but William’s dish required something more modern.

Because of this, William decided to ask if he could bend the rules of the test a bit.

“Can I use my own equipment and ingredients in his test?” William asked.

Leonardude thought for a moment before nodding its head.

“I don’t mind,” Leonardude replied. “In fact, this is better. Give me your best shot.”

“Thank you.”

“No need to thank me. All you need to do is cook.”

Leonardude laughed internally because he was confident that no matter what kind of ingredients, or methods William used, the ending would still be the same. The Demi-turtle would just say that the food was not delicious and fail William on the spot.

The Half-Elf was not aware of this sinister plan that Leonardude was thinking.

The reason?

He was confident that he could make something that would make the Demi-turtle ask for more.

‘System, get me a portable oven that can be used anywhere. It will be best if it is powered by Magic Crystals or Beast Cores. Also, get me these ingredients. Make sure that they are of high quality.’

[ Understood. ]

The System immediately opened the God Shop to gather everything that William needed. The Half-Elf didn’t even need to spend more than Ten God Points in order to acquire everything that he needed.

William took out a big mixing bowl, and used his magic to create 3/4 cup of warm water. After that, he poured a pack of active yeast inside the bowl and gave it a quick stir.

Chiffon stood by his side and watched William as he did his work. She didn’t know what her Big Brother was making, but watching him work with a smile on his face piqued her curiosity.

William placed the mixing bowl to the side and let it rest for a few minutes, as he took out the other ingredients from his storage ring.

The Half-Elf took another mixing bowl and poured two cups of flour inside it. He then added a pinch of salt and sugar before giving it a mix with a whisk. After that was done, he took the mixing bowl with the yeast in it.

William poured a quarter of the flour in the bowl and used his hand to mix it. He added more flour along the way as he kneaded the dough. Chiffon who was watching from the side felt her hand itch because what her Big brother was doing looked fun.

“Interesting,” Oogwei muttered as it looked at the dough in William’s hands.

The Demi-turtles weren’t too impressed because they thought that William was just going to make bread. They ignored William’s performance and instead, played cards with each other. Only Oogwei kept on watching William as its eyes sparkled with genuine interest.

William placed the dough to the side to let it rest. He then glanced at Chiffon who looked to be fascinated with what he was doing. In the end, William decided to let the little girl have fun and let her play a bit in dough making.

William gave her a batch of ingredients and watched from the side as Chiffon imitated what he did earlier, albeit a bit clumsy at first.

The pink-haired girl had a photographic memory. She could instantly recall things that she had seen in the past. After watching William’s work from start to finish, Chiffon only nodded to follow his steps to create a dough of her own.

The little girl kneaded the dough with great interest. Although she still couldn’t smile, William noticed that her eyes held myrth in them. Clearly, Chiffon was having fun with her dough making session.

After watching Chiffon for a while, William returned to his own work. He took the dough and placed it inside the multi-purpose special oven that has a special “speeding up” function that works well when getting pizza dough to rise.

A minute later, William took the dough out of the oven and placed it on top of the table. He then sprinkled some flour on the table before placing the pizza dough on top of it. He then summoned a rolling pin and started to shape it.

Chiffon had also taken the pizza dough from the special oven and started using a rolling pin to shape it, imitating William.

William made the dough on his hand spin, and Chiffon did the same. The two even had a pizza dough spinning contest, which made Oogwei climb on top of the table to have a better look.

After the two had their fill, William remoulded the pizza dough to have the shape he wanted. He then brushed its top with a little bit of oil. He then added pizza sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushroom, sausage, and pepperoni.

William admired his work for a few seconds before placing his creation inside his multi-purpose special oven.

“We just need to wait ten minutes,” William said to Chiffon, who was currently placing the toppings on her own pizza.

“Big Brother, what do you call this food?” Chiffon asked after she finished her work.

William smirked before giving his creation a name. “This is called Kawabangga Pizza. This will lead us to victory.”

The Half-Elf glanced at the Demi-Turtles that were busy playing cards not far from them. He already had a feeling that this test was rigged from the start, and Leonardude had no intention of letting them win.

Since that was the case, he would force the sucker to accept defeat by using the food that was known to be the favorite of the Ninja Tortols in his world.

The moment he took the pizza out of the oven, a delicious smell spread across the surroundings. Chiffon narrowed her eyes and gulped subconsciously. She was very tempted to eat the Kawabangga Pizza that William had made because it looked delicious.

The four Demi-turtles simultaneously turned their heads to look in William’s direction. It was clear that the smell had caught their interest, which made the Half-Elf chuckle internally.

He knew that it was just a matter of time before they cleared the Third Floor of Babylon. However, before that, he planned to do something to the Demi-Turtles first to ensure that his climb to the Tower would be a smooth one.
