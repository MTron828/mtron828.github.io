Chapter 548: Eradicate! World End Tempest!

“I will come with you,” Ashe said as she watched Wiliam wear a hooded robe that covered his entire body.

She knew where her lover was going, and she intended to go with him at all cost.

“Okay,” William replied as he adjusted his assasination uniform.

Due to the trackers that the System had placed on Dickie and his subordinates, he was able to see and hear the conversation between the Mercenary Leader and the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy.

Even though the Mercenary Leader had agreed to report to his employer that Chiffon’s life in the Academy was the same as always, he had no intention of letting them go so easily.

William was someone that could see the bigger picture, so he also understood that if the mercenaries were to really do as they promised in the contract, Chiffon would no longer need to worry about her father who was on the Demon Continent.

The Half-Elf didn’t care who Chiffon’s father was because, to him, her father was scum. William even promised himself to give that person a good beating if he met him sometime in the future.

The Half-Elf was an orphan in his past life. He didn’t have any parents, nor did he know what it meant to have a family. The director of the orphanage said that he was abandoned on their doorstep, and the only thing that they had left him was an embroidered handkerchief with his name.

William.

This was why he had developed a grudge to people that abandoned their children because they were considered baggage.

William was someone that couldn’t forgive these people, so he planned to take action to protect Chiffon in the way he knew best.

“Let’s go,” William said as he opened the window of his room.

Ashe nodded and merged with William. It had been a while since the two of them had activated the ability of the Familia to fuse and fight together.

Tendrils of lightning snaked around William’s body before he disappeared from the room.

“Boss, are we really going to let that kid go?” one of Dickie’s subordinates complained. “I can’t take this lying down, Boss. I want to murder that kid so badly.”

“Boss, I feel the same way. How about we sneak inside the Academy and kill the brat in his sleep? I’m confident that we can sneak past the Academy’s defenses if we all work together.”

“Shut up!” Dickie shouted. “Stop your blubbering and just hurry up. We need to get to the next town before midnight!”

Although they could use Teleport Gates to hasten their journey, there were certain rules that they had to follow while they were in the Kraetor Empire.

Every time they came to the Kraetor Empire from the Demon Continent, they had to travel along a fixed route that was away from the Human cities. This was the compromise that Emperor Leonidas had agreed upon when he decided to allow Chiffon to stay in his territory.

“Boss, just let me have a go at that kid. I promise that I’ll end it quickly.”

“I’ll go with you, brother, let’s go back. We can reach the Academy in five hours tops if we hurry.”

Dickie wanted to slap his subordinates for their stupidity. He was the strongest in their group and the one that had fought against the boy. After their short battle, he realized that the boy was stronger than him.

This was why he used his ultimate attack as well as his Soul Devouring Scroll to finish him off and prevent the Kraetor Empire from gaining another prodigy.

(A/N: He didn’t know that William was not from the Kraetor Empire)

While he was about to take action and show the fools their place, a peal of thunder sounded in the heavens. Seconds later, a streak of lightning descended a few meters away from them.

“You don’t need to return to the Academy to find me,” William said as sparks of lightning flashed all over his body. “I have come for all of you.”

“Hahaha! Perfect!” one of Dickie’s subordinates summoned a War Axe. “You saved us the trouble. Now, it’s time for you to die!”

The man charged at William with the intention of slicing him in half. He was a veteran in the battlefield and he had already determined that William was only in the Peak of the Platinum Rank.

He was in the middle stages of the Adamantium Rank, which was two realms above the boy. With such a huge gap in power, how could he possibly lose to a teenager who was still studying in an Academy?

It was not only the Ax Wielder that decided to attack William. The other mercenaries, except Dickie, also joined in to ensure that their prey wouldn’t be able to escape.

“Exceed Break,” William muttered as he took a step forward. He had activated the skill that heightened all of his senses and multiplied them tenfold.

“Fools! Are you blinded by rage that you didn’t notice?! He’s a lightning user!” Dickie shouted as he, too, took out his weapon to assist his men in battle. “Don’t underestimate him just because his rank is lower than ours!”

Dickie’s subordinates returned to their senses after they had overlooked this important part. However, it was already too late.

At the center of William’s palm, a ball made of electricity and fire swirled like a whirlpool.

“Thunder Blaze!”

William unleashed his magical attack and sent the Axe Wielder flying. The smell of burnt flesh permeated the air as William’s eyes glowed eerily in the darkness.

After disabling one of his targets, the Half-Elf stomped his foot on the ground and jumped high into the air.

“Icicle Realm!”

Icicle Shards sprouted off the ground and trapped the mercenaries in a dome filled with razor sharp icicles. These icicles would shoot into the air and break into pieces. Each piece was sharp enough to cut off a person’s body part, and William had trapped the mercenaries in a slaughter house made of icicle shards.

Although this attack was one of William’s favorite moves, his opponents were veterans in their own right.

The mercenaries activated their spells in order to destroy William’s attempt to hold them in place, but to their surprise. The Ice that they destroyed would regenerate at a rapid pace.

The mercenaries thought that they were just fighting against a single Individual, but they were wrong. Right now, Ashe had merged with William, and she was equipped with the Ice Mage’s Final Job Class, which was the Ice Monarch.

William was currently using the Elemental Lord Job Class which allowed him to wield the powers of Wind, Water, Fire, Earth, and Lightning.

The Half-Elf gathered the five elements on both of his hands and merged them together. This was the first time that he would use this attack in actual combat. Its output was not very strong, but it was devastating nevertheless.

The purpose of the Icicle Domain was to simply buy some time until William had merged the five elements together to create a spell that he had created on a whim.

“Eradicate!” William roared as he threw the rainbow colored ball of light in his hands.

“World End Tempest!”

A blinding flash of light illuminated the dark night, followed by a loud explosion. Gilbert, who was patrolling the academy grounds saw a radiant light in the distance, and instinctively felt that something had gone terribly wrong.

‘That stupid brat!’ Gilbert immediately summoned a giant owl and headed to the direction of the light in haste. He was afraid that if he arrived a second late, the only thing he would find were ashes of the Mercenaries, who had left his Academy just a few hours ago.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
