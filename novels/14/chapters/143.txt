Chapter 143: Inner Circle Of Friends

Two days passed and the Head Prefects of the different Divisions had emerged victorious from their competitions.

William was pleasantly surprised when he received the list of the new Head Prefects. Est had successfully become the Head Prefect for the Magic Division of the First Year Students. However, William’s surprise didn’t end there, the name that appeared for the Fourth Year of the Magic Division was a name that he knew too well.

Matthew Von Ainsworth, Head Prefect of the Magic Class Division (Fourth Year).

“It seems that Big Brother Matthew is not being low profile here in the academy,” William muttered as he sat down on the bed.

Matthew was aware of William’s current condition because Leah’s and his parents’ letters had arrived at the Hellan Royal Academy. His parents, Mordred and Anna, asked Matthew to look after his cousin and make sure to keep his secret safe while he explored the world outside of Lont. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

William and Matthew had a very good relationship, and both of them treated each other as a real brother instead of a cousin. With that said, William was very happy that he could hug his “Big Brother’s” thighs if push came to shove.

In regards to the way the Martial Classes were being treated by the other divisions, William couldn’t think of a good plan to reverse the current situation. All he could do was to ensure that the people under his wing would perform well and put the arrogant Spirit and Magic Divisions back in their rightful place.

“At the end of the day, it all comes down to strength,” William sighed as he closed the document in his hand. “Master was right. Those who have the bigger fist dictate the rules. The weak can only nod their heads in submission or perish in the aftermath.”

The survival of the fittest, or the law of the jungle, was the most basic law that those who could wield power followed. William understood this concept, but he didn’t like it.

Even though it wasn’t perfect, the laws back on Earth could “force” the authorities to take the necessary actions once a citizen used “the power of the masses”. This power was so great that even those people in high ranking positions had no choice but to compromise once this move was used.

‘Unfortunately, there is no social media in this world,’ William mused. ‘Just one post and it would definitely go viral.’

Ella rested her head on William’s lap, and the boy unconsciously patted her head. This was the scene that Kenneth saw when he entered the room after checking out the latest news of the other Divisions.

Kenneth grinned as he approached William and tapped his shoulder, “There are people looking for you outside the gates. They can’t come in because a certain someone prevented them from doing so.”

“People looking for me?” William frowned. “Do you know them?”

“I only know three of them,” Kenneth replied. “Est, Ian, and Isaac. Also, there are two more people. One of them had the same hair color as you, while the other was a beautiful lady with midnight blue hair.”

Ella lifted her head from William’s lap because she recognized the two people that Kenneth had described.

“Meeeeeeh.”

“Yes, Mama. It’s definitely Big Brother and Big Sister.”

“Meeeeeh.”

“Okay, let’s meet them.” William nodded his head then thanked Kenneth for passing on their message.

Kenneth decided to follow behind William. He was very curious about the people that had a relationship with him. William didn’t mind bringing Kenneth along with him. In fact, he wanted to introduce him to his Big Brother and Big Sister as the first friend he made inside the academy.

Also, since Kenneth was his roommate, it would be a great idea if they get to know each other, so that they could look after this delicate silver-gray-haired boy when William was not around.

“Big Brother, Big Sister, Est, and Isaac, thank you for visiting me,” William greeted them with a smile as he met them at the gates. He then looked at the guards who had carried out his orders with a smile. “These two people are the Head Prefects of the Magic Division Classes. In the future, please, allow them to enter the premises if they are looking for me.”

William then raised his chin and pointed it at Ian, “As for this snot-nosed-pansy, feel free to keep him out of the premises. He’s just a side character. He is not important!”

“Y-You!” Ian gnashed his teeth in anger.

He had come here with Est to thank William because the strategy he used helped them to win the competition for the Head Prefect in the Magic Division. To think that not only did William ban them from entering, the red-headed-boy even explicitly told the guards to not let him pass because he was a side character and not important!

Ian was so close to lunging at William and beating him up to a pulp. Unfortunately, the shepherd hadn’t exited the gate and hid behind the guards that were watching over it.

Est gave a light cough as he looked at Ian with an apologetic gaze. He then moved closer to Ian and whispered something in his ear.

“I’ll ask him to let you pass after our meeting,” Est whispered. “Until then, stay here and take note of the people who tried to enter the gates aside from us. I believe that they are people who want to recruit William into their party. This is something that we cannot allow to happen, understood?”

Although Ian was still reluctant at being left out, he still nodded his head in acknowledgement. William had been a hot topic in the Spirit and Magic Divisions. There were plenty of people who wanted to make him part of their team.

The reason why they came here right after the ceremony was to ask William to join their party when they entered dungeons and domains in the future. The three children, Est, Ian, and Isaac knew full well how powerful William could be in a battle.

If the other teams were to successfully poach him, wouldn’t that lower their chances of clearing the hard dungeons that were available in the academy? This was something that they couldn’t allow to happen.

“Understood.” Ian nodded his head. He was someone who could think of the bigger picture.

“Thank you,” Est replied. “Don’t worry, I’ll convince him. Just make sure to stop butting heads with him after I succeed in the negotiations.”

“Okay.” Ian sighed. There was nothing he could do, but accept the fact that William was no longer an ordinary student that he could bully. He was the Head Prefect of a Division, which meant that he had to give him some face in front of the public.

Matthew and Leah were talking to William, but they were also paying close attention to Est and the twins that were always around him. Although they knew that they were William’s friends, the two of them were still wary of their backgrounds.

For them, William was too trusting. Since that was the case, they took it upon themselves to keep watch on the people that were trying to get close to him.

What they didn’t know was that Ella was a very good judge of character. Since she had already vouched for Est, Isaac, Ian, and Kenneth’s temperament, William would definitely keep them in his inner circle of friends.
