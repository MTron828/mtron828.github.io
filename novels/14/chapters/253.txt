Chapter 253: The Law Of Equivalent Exchange

“Is there something that you need, Lord William?” an old man with a crooked nose asked with a big smile on his face. “Our tribe is willing to accommodate your every command. You already have two beautiful wives by your side, but we could add more if you want to! Such a handsome and chivalrous young man like you will have no problem having a dozen wives!”

“Don’t listen to him, Sir Wiliam,” another old man, who had the same sturdy build as William’s grandfather, James, said as he patted the boy’s shoulder. “Our tribe produces the most beautiful and excellent fighters in the Northern Regions. If Lord William makes any number of them his wife then they would definitely give birth to handsome, and strong, warriors just like your grace.”

“Nonsense! Our tribe has the most beautiful ladies!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Hah? You old crook, why don’t you just kick the bucket already? You’re already this old and you’re still playing matchmaker! Go home and just lay quietly to the side! Shoo!”

William was using all of his willpower to prevent his lips from twitching as over a dozen old men tried to ingratiate themselves to him. He was having some afternoon tea with Wendy and Amelia when this group suddenly barged inside their tent.

The Half-Elf thought that they were planning to fight him, but they did the opposite instead. The old men started to bribe him with beautiful wives and kept on calling him handsome, strong, chivalrous, manly, and many other positive things that made even the thick-skinned Half-Elf blush in embarrassment.

“Everyone, please calm down.” William raised his hand in order to put a stop to the old men’s bickering. “Can one of you, please, tell me the reason for your visit?”

The old man with a crooked nose smiled and nodded his head, “As expected of the handsome Knight Commander, you truly know how to cut to the chase. This old one’s name is Alden, I am the Tribal Chief of the Cato Tribe. The reason why we are here is because the Great Oracle has invited you to go to the First Peak of Divinity to have a meeting with the Great One.”

Cato bowed his head respectfully after referring to their God. “We of the Cato Tribe are willing to escort Lord William to the First Peak of Divinity and brave the dangers together! Even if we face a mountain of fire and a sea of knives, our Tribe will remain by your side until the bitter end!”

“Shameless!”

“You old fart! How dare you promote your tribe in front of Lord William.”

“Oi, aren’t you afraid that if you force yourself to look good, your crooked nose will straighten?”

“Alden, why don’t you just sit down? Lord William, the Boman Tribe is willing to become your sword and spear to overcome the challenges together!”

The old men started to bicker with each other and spittle flew in the air. William frowned because this sudden change in the Tribe’s stance caught him by surprise. A few hours ago all of them were glaring at him, now, all of them were acting as if he was their best friend!

“All of you stop talking!” A commanding tone immediately silenced the rowdy crowd who was so close in having a brawl.

Great Chief Evander stepped forward and his intimidating presence made the other Tribal Chiefs unconsciously take a step back. Although his position was being challenged at the moment, that didn’t change the fact that he was still the recognized Great Chieftain of the Allied Tribes.

Their long years of being subservient to him had penetrated deep inside their bones that it was hard for them to immediately shake off his hold over them.

Seeing that his deterrence still had some effect, Evander made his way towards William and passed the exact words that the Great Oracle had given him.

“You may bring anyone you want to the Great Peak of Divinity, but know that it will not be an easy climb,” Evander explained. “Those who manage to reach the First Peak will gain great rewards. Those who fail will return here to the Third Peak of Chivalry. I know that the two of us have started off on the wrong foot and I have no plans to ingratiate myself to you.

“However, I would like to remind you that Brianna is already yours. What you do with her is up to you, but you cannot return her to the tribe. This is the law and since you have used the duel to fight for her hand, you’d better take responsibility or else, even if the Gods forgive you, I won’t forgive you!”

William faced Great Chief Evander’s glare fearlessly. He didn’t deny the Great Chief’s words because it was true. William had fought for Brianna’s hand in the name of their God and he couldn’t take those words back even if he wanted to.

However, there was a loophole in the law and that was William could either marry Briana, or marry her off to someone else. Since the Half-Elf knew that Brianna and Prince Ernest liked each other, he had already decided to play matchmaker between the two and have the adorable loli be recognized as the Youngest Prince’s fiance.

William may not be the smartest Half-Elf in the world, but he understood what Great Chief Evander was trying to imply.

‘The two of us are already attached at our hips, if we fall, Brianna will also fall!’

This was Great Chief Evander’s message, and William understood the logic behind it.

“Let’s talk after I meet with your God,” William replied. “As for Brianna, she already belongs to me. What I do with her is none of your business.”

Great Chief Evander nodded his head. William’s clear, light-green, eyes had already told him what he wanted to know. Deep inside, he was able to sigh in relief because there was still a chance to keep his position from getting snatched by the other Tribal Chiefs.

“By the way, what happens if I don’t go to the First Peak?” William inquired.

Great Chief Evander and the rest of the Tribal Chiefs looked at William as if he was the most stupid person they had seen in their life. No one in the Kyrintor Mountains would dare disobey the decree that the Great One had passed down. But, the Half-Elf even dared to question what would happen if he didn’t go. Wasn’t this a very stupid thing to ask?

“I don’t know what will happen if you don’t go to the First Peak,” Great Chief Evander admitted. “However, what I do know is that no one has defied the orders of our Sovereign since the tribes made the Kyrintor Mountains their home.”

Great Chief Evander smiled evilly at William. “I’m also very curious, Knight Commander. I want to know what would happen to you if you dared to defy our God’s decree?”

It was at that moment when all of them heard the consecutive roars of thunder across the mountain. It was like a loud laughter, but to William’s Half-Elven ears, it sounded very ominous. Since his question had already been answered, there was no choice but to go to the First Peak and meet the God of the Kyrintor Mountains.

William and his Knight Order made their journey towards the Peak of Divinity under the watchful eyes of the warriors of the Northern Tribe.

Since none of them were invited, they couldn’t accompany William on his journey. The greatest glory in their lifetime was to have the opportunity to meet their God at least once in their life. They envied William because it was very clear that their Sovereign looked at him kindly.

The moment William’s party reached the Second Peak of Enlightenment, a powerful blizzard rained over them. Visibility was almost zero and they could only see a foot in front of their faces.

Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blew over them which scattered their formation. William reached out to hold Wendy’s hand, but he was already too late. Wendy and the rest of his Knight Order were blown away by the wind and were nowhere to be found.

“Wendy! Answer me!” William shouted as he tried to look for his comrades. “Amelia! Ian! Bruno! Brutus! Where are you guys?!”

William shouted over and over again, but only the howling of the wind answered him back. On the First peak of Divinity, Ella stood straight and looked down over her beloved. She then glanced at the humanoid goat that was kneeling beside her.

“Don’t give him and his friends any special treatment,” Ella ordered. “William is not a vase that will easily break.”

The humanoid goat that was over three meters tall bowed its head in a respectful manner. The wings behind its back unfurled as it stood up. The Sovereign of the Mountains then glanced at the boy that was stranded inside the blizzard.

He felt envious of him, but held no malice for the boy. Since he was the one chosen by their Goddess then it was only natural that he recognized him as well.

“As you wish, Lady Amaltheia,” the Demigod replied. It then clenched its fist and allowed the Peak of Enlightenment to activate.

The Peak of Enlightenment was a trial for the warriors of the Northern Tribe. If they successfully cleared it, they would be able to gain great rewards. Of course, if they didn’t succeed, then they would have to pay a price as well.

Afterall, the Peak of Enlightenment followed one law and one law only, and that was the Law of Equivalent Exchange.
