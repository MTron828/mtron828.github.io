Chapter 279: I Hope That The Two Of You Can Meet Soon

Three days before the Inter-Division Battle…

Due to the arrival of the Third Princess of their allied kingdom, King Noah decided to hold a banquet for her and the Knights that came to assist them in their time of need.

Naturally, all the nobles headed to the capital in order to take part in the festivities. Ironically, all of the students of the Royal Academy were also asked to participate in this event. Which made the students that were born commoners very happy.

This was a very rare chance to see the nobles, and members of the royal family up close, not to mention, seeing the Third Princess of a neighboring kingdom in the flesh.

Every student in the academy was excited, except one person.

‘What a pain…,’ William sighed after leaving the conference room of the academy.

The Half-Elf had been suffering anxiety as of late because Carter hadn’t been making any suspicious moves since he’d snatched Wendy out from under his nose. He was also feeling guilty about Est and Isaac who were still under the control of the Mind Weaver Spell.

Because of this, he didn’t hesitate to plant trackers on them as well which cost him 3,000 God Points.

God Points: 2,980

Although the God Point expenditure was high, William didn’t bat an eye and did it anyway. For him, Est, and Isaac were more important than God Points.

There were times when he had to stop himself from giving them his lollipop in order for the spell to be broken completely, because he was afraid that if he continued, Carter would cease his activities altogether. William wanted to know the Professor’s goal and if he had other acquaintances that were helping him from the shadows.

“You have that sad expression on your face again. What’s wrong?” Wendy asked as she moved towards her boyfriend and gave him a hug. “Are you worried about something?”

“Yes,” William replied as he hugged her tightly. “I am feeling very anxious as of late. Not only that, I am also feeling guilty.”

“Mmm.” Wendy hummed as she gently patted the back of William’s head. After becoming William’s “not-so-secret” girlfriend, the blonde beauty had gotten to know that her lover would tell her the things that he wanted her to know.

Since WIlliam wasn’t telling her the reason behind why he was feeling anxious and guilty, she knew that it was not because he didn’t want to tell her, but he couldn’t. Because of this, she didn’t pry any further and just helped him to calm down.

“I love you,” Wendy said as she kissed his lips.

“I love you too,” William replied and kissed her back.

Wendy had officially moved into William’s room, bringing half of the clothes in her closet with her. Ever since she and William had dreamt about that passionate night in Valhalla, the two’s relationship had become much closer than before.

Ironically, they would often dream about the continuation of those dreams where the Silver-Haired William and the Adult Wendy would go to the realms of Yggdrasil to protect them from invaders who wished to conquer them.

Naturally, aside from fighting, the two would spend intimate moments together. These dreams would often make Wendy’s face turn beet red each time she woke up before William, and saw him sleeping next to her.

Of course, those intimate “adult scenes” were restricted to their dreams. William didn’t do anything to her, aside from hugs and kisses when both of them were awake. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Feeling better?” Wendy asked.

“Much better,” William smiled and kissed her forehead.

The beautiful blonde then dragged William to the bed in order to talk about their plans for the banquet, which would be held tonight.

“I heard that the Third Princess is so beautiful that she has to cover her face with a veil,” Wendy said like an auntie who liked gossip. “I wonder if the rumors are true.”

“If we go by the script, she would definitely be an earth-shaking beauty that would make all the men fall on their knees and beg for her good graces,” William replied.

“Including you?” Wendy inquired.

“I haven’t seen her face, so I can’t say for certain. However, there is one thing that I am sure of,” William answered with a smug expression on her face.

“And that is?”

“She will definitely fall in love with me.”

Wendy pouted and pinched William’s waist.

Instead of feeling pain, the Half-Elf just smiled and enjoyed Wendy’s jealous action.

“You’re so full of yourself,” Wendy wrinkled her nose in annoyance.

Willian pinched his lover’s nose with a teasing smile. “And that’s the reason why you fell in love with me, right?”

“Hmp!” Wendy pounded William’s chest, and the latter only laughed as he caught her fists.

The hours passed as the two prepared for the banquet. Although Wendy tried to hide it, she was looking forward to introducing William to her father in a discreet manner at the banquet.

She had asked William if it was fine for her parents to know about their relationship. The Half-Elf had no qualms about informing Wendy’s parents because he planned to take this relationship seriously. The only request was that it wouldn’t be made public until after his duel with Rebecca was over.

Wendy agreed to William’s condition and silently apologized to Rebecca inside her heart. Although she knew that Rebecca and William didn’t have any feelings for each other, she still felt like a thieving cat that got in the way of her good friend’s love relationship.

“Beautiful, simply beautiful,” William praised Wendy after he helped her put on her dress for the party.

He was even the one who helped brush her hair and chose the accessories she was going to wear. The Half-Elf was almost half tempted to not let her go to the banquet and lock her up in his room to prevent other men from looking at her.

“I bet that you say that to all the girls,” Wendy replied in a sarcastic manner, but deep inside she was very happy to be praised by William.

“Not to all the girls,” William corrected her. “I only say that to the girls close to my heart.”

“Oh? Aside from me, who else do you call beautiful?”

“My master and a black-haired beauty that is waiting for me to sweep her off her feet.”

“Priscilla?” Wendy raised an eyebrow as she looked at the handsome red-headed boy who was wearing the ceremonial black attire of the Angorian War Sovereign.

“Not her,” William shook his head. “Someone that holds my heart close to her chest and thinks about me every single day.”

“What is her name?”

“Belle.”

Wendy tilted her head as she tried to recall the names of the girls that were close to William. Her memory was good, so she easily concluded that she hadn’t met the girl named “Belle” before in her life.

“Where is she?” Wendy asked as she looked straight into William’s light-green eyes that reflected her image back to her.

William sighed before answering Wendy’s question. The short reunion with Belle was one of his most precious memories.

“In a place far from my reach,” William answered with a sad expression. He then caressed the side of Wendy’s face and looked at her with a serious expression. “I hope that the two of you can meet soon.”

“I wish for that as well.”

“Shall we go now?”

“Okay.” Wendy nodded her head.

William then bent his elbow in a gentlemanly manner to escort the beautiful lady outside the Solaris Dormitory, where Dave was waiting for them.

They were already an hour late for the party, but William didn’t care. For him, this party was just a way to blow off steam and meet Wendy’s parents. Although he couldn’t publicly announce their relationship, that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t meet with his girlfriend’s parents.

William wanted them to know that he was serious in having a relationship with their daughter. Now, whether Wendy’s parents would accept him or not, that could only be answered by Wendy’s father, Joaquin Armstrong.
