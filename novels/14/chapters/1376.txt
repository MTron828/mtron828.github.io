The Flying Ship landed at the base of the mountain, which was heavily guarded by Dwarf Cannoneers. 

William didn't mind this kind of treatment because he came to their territory unannounced. Even he would be wary of a Sovereign visiting his kingdom out of the blue, so he allowed himself and his ladies to be escorted to the underground city, where the Royal Palace of the Dwarves was located.

"It's like a maze down here~" Maple said as she walked hand in hand with William. 

"Even so, we won't get lost no matter what~" Cinnamon commented. 

The two girls were quite lively as they pulled on the Half-Elf's hands, urging him to walk faster. 

"I didn't think that I would get a chance to visit here again," Ephemera said softly as she walked behind William. "The last time I came here was during the negotiations to have Beldaral part of the Gunnar Federation. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed."

One of the Dwarf Guards escorting them snorted after hearing Ephemera's words.

"The members of the Gunnar Federation say that the reason why they became united under one banner is for the sake of peace," the Dwarf Guard commented. "However, even now that they are under one banner, the backstabbing continues. We don't want to be part of that farce."

Ephemera didn't refute the Dwarf's words because they were true. Even her own kingdom, Edelweiss, was far from being a role model of the Federation.

William was not aware of the current situation of the Western Continent, so he remained silent and just followed their guide. It would not be a good idea to antagonize the Dwarves who had come this far, so he merely listened, and didn't share his opinion.

An hour later…

"Maple is tired," Maple complained. "Uncle, are you perhaps going around in circles to tire Maple out? Why are you bullying me?"

"Cinnamon is tired, too," Cinnamon complained as well. "Uncle, why do you bully Cinnamon?"

The one guiding them felt a little guilty after hearing the complaints of the two girls. In truth, he had been indeed going around in circles, in order to better understand the qualities of their guests. 

If they started to become unreasonable, he would take them to the nearest exit, and bar them from entering their main city. 

His only problem was how he would convince his King that their unwanted guests didn't come with good intentions

"Uncle, I'm tired."

"Uncle, I'm hungry."Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

"Do you find bullying Maple fun?"

"Cinnamon doesn't like bullies."

Dwarves might be stubborn, and hardheaded, but they couldn't ignore the hardships of children. The two little girls, who had been quite lively earlier, were now using Will's hands as a means of support as they walked behind the guide, making them both look pitiful.

"I think it's about time that you take us to see the king," William finally broke his silence as he waved his hand to use his Wind Magic to lift the two girls in the air, making them float. "I don't mind playing this farce, but the children are the ones suffering."

The guide didn't reply. However, when they arrived at another intersection, he no longer took the path that would make them circle around the fortress, but chose the shortest route towards the Royal Palace, where the Dwarven King was waiting for them.

A few minutes later, everyone saw a magnificent city that stretched for miles. 

"I welcome you to the Capital City of our Kingdom, Morndhan," the guide said before turning around to look at their guests. "We will now be using a special teleportation spell that will take us to the Palace Gates. Are all of you ready to go?"

William nodded. "We're ready."

The guide nodded and took out a token from his pocket. A moment later, he, the Dwarf Guards, as well as William's entire entourage, were bathed in a blinding light.

A moment later, they disappeared from where they stood and reappeared at the palace gates of the Dwarven Kingdom.

'Optimus, set the coordinates for the Bifrost Bridge.'

< Understood. >

< Coordinates have been successfully added to the Bifrost Bridge's way points! >

The Half-Elf didn't want to waste his time walking through the maze again just to meet with the Dwarf King in the future, so he decided to use the Bifrost Bridge to bypass the defenders that would undoubtedly make things difficult for him if he were to visit them again.

If not for Maple's and Cinnamon's complaints, the guide might have taken them on a wild goose chase for a half a day before finally giving up.

Time was precious to William, and he didn't want to waste it going around in circles. 

After passing through several checkpoints, the group finally stepped foot inside the Royal Palace, which was located at the highest part of the city. The Dwarves didn't like making their houses fancy.

For them, practicality was best. Although the design of their palace wasn't as fancy as the other kingdoms in Hestia, it still gave a feeling of majesty, which made William feel more eager to meet the King that ruled the Dwarven Nation.

When the guide arrived at a large stone gate that bore the insignia of the Royal Family of Beldaral, he cleared his throat before shouting to announce the arrival of their guests.

"Emperor William Von Ainsworth has come to seek an audience with His Majesty," the guide shouted. 

"Enter."

A single word reached William's ears. 

The Half-Elf frowned because the voice sounded vaguely familiar. He even found a trace of anticipation in it, making him wonder if the Dwarf King had heard his name in the past.

When the giant stone gates opened, William and his entourage entered the throneroom of the Dwarven Kingdom.

The moment the Half-Elf's eyes landed on the person sitting on the throne, his body stiffened because he didn't expect to see that person here of all places.

"Welcome, Emperor William." 

The Dwarf whom Wiliam had met in the Deadlands looked at him with a devilish smile plastered on his face. 

"Eldon?" William asked half doubtful, and half hopeful that he was right. 

The Dwarven King smiled, but soon, his gaze landed on the two little girls that were holding the Half-Elf's hands. 

The moment he saw Maple and Cinnamon enter the throne room, his heart almost leapt out of his chest because the mere sight of them made his breath catch. 

Soon, his gaze softened as he looked at the two little girls, making him, as well as his Queen, who sat beside him, want to give them a tight, and loving, hug.

Half a minute later, he reluctantly tore his gaze away from them and shifted them back on the Half-Elf that was looking at him in disbelief. 

"Well met, Half-Elf," Eldon replied. "Now, tell me, why did it take you so long to visit your in-laws?"

Ephemera, as well as the ladies that came with William, looked at the Half-Elf in surprise. 

They didn't expect the Dwarf King, who ruled one of the strongest kingdoms in the Western Continent, to actually be his in-law, making them feel that Fate truly knew how to play pranks on people.
