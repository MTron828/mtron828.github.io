Chapter 10: Time To Fight Back!

“Guwaaaaaaaaaaaah!”

The goblin was sent flying a few meters away from William’s location. The blood on its chest gushed forth and stained the ground in a greenish hue.

Two more shrieks filled with pain followed suit. The two goblins who had been bashing the Angorian Goat were also sent flying a few meters away from the fallen beast.

All three goblins lost consciousness, which made the surroundings very quiet. William snapped out of his daze and hurriedly crawled towards his Mama Ella. He didn’t even glance at the floating wooden staff in the air that saved his and his Mama’s life.

“Eyaaah! Eyaaaah!” (Mama! Mama!)

William hugged Ella’s bloody head and cried.

“Me-ee-eeeh,” Ella bleated. Blood was spilling at the side of her face and her eyes. Sensing that William was beside her, she licked the baby’s cheeks before lowering her head to the ground. The Angorian Goat had received severe injuries and was on the verge of dying.

William kept on crying while holding unto Ella’s bloody head. He didn’t care that his clothes were stained with blood. The Goat’s coat had blood all over and he could feel that her life was slowly ebbing away.

“Uwaaaaaah! Mama! Don’t leave me! Uwaaaaah!”

As William cried, he felt something softly tapping his cheeks. As he turned his head, he saw the wooden staff floating by his side.

“Go away! Uwaaaah!”

William swatted the wooden staff. Due to the event that just transpired and the strong smell of blood that permeated the air, the baby William was not able to think properly. This was the first time he experienced such a brutal event in his two lives and it made his brain lose reason.

As his hand touched the handle of the wooden staff, a small ringing sound resounded inside his head. The sound brought with it a calming effect which allowed him to regain some clarity of mind.

Although he was still somewhat deranged from fear and sorrow, he was able to read the row of words that appeared in front of him.

[ Would you like to acquire the Shepherd Job Class? ]

[ Yes / No ]

The baby looked blankly at the glowing words in front of him. It took a few seconds before the words registered inside William’s head.

“Eyah!” (I choose Yes!)

[ Congratulations! Host has acquired the Shepherd Job Class. ]

[ Host has learned skill: Way of the Shepherd ]

[ Host has learned skill: Bestow ]

[ Host has learned skill: First Aid ]

William’s attention locked on the newly acquired skill “First Aid”. He didn’t waste any time and immediately read the skill’s information.

‘This is it!’ William knew that this skill was the thing he needed. He then glanced at his Mama Ella and was surprised to see the goat’s status window.

Seeing that his Mama Ella was indeed in a near-death condition. William touched the Angorian Goat’s head and said the skill out loud. Time was of the essence and he couldn’t afford to take things lightly.

“Eyah!” (First Aid!)

“Eyah!” (First Aid!)

“Eyah!” (First Aid!)

“Eyah!” (First Aid!)

William repeatedly cast the skill until he felt his body grew heavy. He was also feeling a slight headache due to mana depletion.

The goat’s blood stained coat was restored to its silky and fluffy appearance. Her broken legs snapped back in place, and Ella’s bloody face returned to normal.

The Goat immediately stood up and licked William’s face. The wet and warm tongue that he had grown accustomed to brought joy to the baby who had almost fallen into despair a few minutes ago.

“Eyaaah!” (Mama!)

“Meeeeh!”

William hugged the goat’s neck, while the latter closed her eyes in comfort. The two stayed like this for a full minute, before the peace was broken by the two goblins who had regained consciousness.

“Meeeeh!”

Ellah stood in front of William. The Angorian Goat pawed the ground as if preparing to attack the moment the Goblins came within her strike range.

William grimaced because he forgot that the battle was still far from over. He quickly looked at his status to check if any of the skills he had learned could turn the tide in their favor.

[ Way of the Shepherd ]

‘This is good, but not good enough,’ William thought as he looked at the other skill he had learned.

William looked at his status and found out that he no longer had any mana points. After he acquired the Shepherd Job Class, his stats had improved greatly compared to last time. The lack of mana though made him feel uneasy.

‘I have twelve available stat points,’ William thought. ‘I’ll put them all in intelligence and act as Mama Ella’s support.’

‘Time to fight back!’ William placed his hand on the Angorian Goat’s coat and used his skill.

“Eyah!” (Bestow!)

Ella’s body glowed and grew larger. Normally, her height was only a meter tall. However, after receiving William’s bestowment, she became a meter and a half tall, and the horns on her head glowed bloody red.

Although it still looked like a docile and harmless goat, its physical prowess had grown exponentially.

“Meeeeeh!” Ella bleated and charged towards the two goblins. Aside from gaining additional strength, it also became more intelligent. It knew that in order to protect William, it must take the initiative and deal with the two goblins as soon as possible.

The goblins bellowed and charged at the goat with their wooden clubs held high. They were not afraid of human livestocks. Since they had already defeated it once, they could easily defeat it again!

When the two sides were only a few meters apart, Ella stomped hard on the ground and increased her speed. She caught the two goblins by surprise, which led to one of them to their immediate demise.

Ella’s horn glowed as it pierced the Goblin’s chest. This time, the horns penetrated the goblin’s skin and tore towards the heart like a hot knife through butter. The goblin was only able to voice out a guttural death cry before it fell dead on the ground.

[ Gained Exp Points: 60 ]

After killing the first goblin, the Angorian Goat pressed both of its front hooves firmly on the ground as it used its hind legs to deliver a powerful kick aimed towards the second goblin’s head.

A cracking sound echoed in the cave as Ella’s hooves shattered the goblin’s skull. The second goblin shrieked in pain before falling down. The Angorian Goat then raised its hooves and stomped on the goblin’s face with bloodshot eyes.

[ Gained Exp Points: 60 ]

This was the goblin who had struck her body repeatedly and Ella was hell bent to smash its face to a pulp. After two hate-filled stomps, the goblin’s face caved in, almost turning into meat paste.

Ella grunted before turning her attention to the last goblin that had attempted to hit William with a wooden club. Although she hated the goblin who had beaten her up until she was near death, her hate for the goblin who tried to kill William had reached the extreme.

The Angorian Goat trotted towards the goblin. Ella knew that it was only playing dead, so that it would be left alone. Unfortunately, it had touched her reverse scale. William and Ella had no intention of keeping the bastard alive.

As if sensing that death was at hand, the goblin sprang to its feet and ran away in fear. It didn’t care about the blood that was gushing out of its chest. The goblin knew that staying would only lead to its death.

William watched the goblin while his hand moved to the space in front of him. After killing the two goblins, the Angorian Goat had increased its Job Level. Since Ella was registered as part of William’s “herd” he had the ability to distribute her stat and skill points.

One of the skills that had been unlocked after Ella gained a level was an attack skill called “Quick Attack”.

It allowed the creature to increase its speed exponentially to deliver a blow to its enemy. William didn’t hesitate and chose the skill. He didn’t want to let the goblin escape because it might call for reinforcements.

“Eyah! Eyah!” (Mama! Use Quick Attack!)

The Angorian Goat stomped on the ground and charged towards the fleeing goblin like an arrow in flight.

A miserable shriek echoed inside the cave as Ella’s bloody horns pierced through its back, impaling its heart.

[ Gained Exp Points: 60 ]

After making sure that the goblin was indeed dead, Ella returned to William’s side and licked his cheeks. Not long after, the goblins turned into particles of light and disappeared.

William was very happy that he was able to survive such a dangerous ordeal. He hugged his Mama Ella’s neck as the adrenaline rush started to disappear from his system.

“Eyah. Eyah.” (Let’s go back. Mama.)

“Meeeeeh!”

William touched the ring that was hanging on his neck. After gaining his Job Class, the appraisal skill was also unlocked. Because of this, he was able to learn the ring’s special functions.

With a brilliant flash of light the baby and the goat disappeared from that dark and damp cave and returned to Mordred’s and Anna’s bedroom.
