Chapter 242: My Future Husband Is The Best

The group traveled for two more days before finally arriving at the Third Peak of Chivalry in the Kyrintor Mountains. Along the way, they saw thousands of tents surrounding the peak, which proved that this was indeed a special gathering of the Northern Tribe.

After having a faceoff with William, Cadell didn’t try to do anything else. He only grudgingly took the representatives of the Hellan Kingdom to the Grand Residence where their Great Chief lived before he left them to attend to his own matters.

As per custom, the Chief’s attendant led them to the audience hall where the Great Chief was already waiting for them. Sitting on his right was his eldest son, Liam, and on his left was his youngest granddaughter, Brianna.

The little girl was quite adorable and she looked at William and the rest of the representatives from the Hellan Kingdom with a curious gaze. She gave them a smile, but remained seated like a proper noble lady during special occasions.

The name of the Great Chief of the Northern Tribes was Evander Zeke. After his father had stepped down from his position, Evander ruled the Tribes well. He brought them prosperity and happiness for many years, and all the other tribal leaders were very satisfied with his way of managing things.

This was also why he was loved by his people.

Now that his second son was looking for a bride, the tribes gathered and brought the most beautiful ladies in their domains to get the chance of becoming the Second Warrior’s wife. In their society, an ordinary man could have one wife, while a warrior could have four.

This was a way to preserve their lineage because the lives of warriors were very unpredictable, especially during times of war. Since the chances of them dying was high, the Tribes had agreed that having more than one wife was needed in order to preserve their legacy as the brave warriors of the Kyrintor Mountains.

Sir Jerkins gave the Great Chieftain a respectful bow before sitting on the mat provided for them. William and the others followed the Ambassador’s respectful greeting and sat down as well.

“Guests from afar, I welcome you to the Third Peak of Chivalry,” Great Chief Evander said with a smile. “Two days from now, our tribes will hold a special celebration. Please, stay and enjoy the festivities. As for your purpose of coming, I think I have an idea of what it is.”

The Great Chief of the Tribes paused before giving Sir Jerkins a serious expression. “We will hold our talks a day after my second son has chosen his brides. I am quite busy with the preparations for this special occasion and have no time to entertain you and your purpose for coming.”

Sir Jerkins gave the chief a courteous nod, “We are more than willing to experience the hospitality of the Great Chief and his people. Since Your Excellency has already issued your decree, we will naturally obey and not discuss anything related to politics. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Great Chief Evander gave Jerkins a nod of approval. “It is always a pleasure talking to you, Sir Jerkins.”

“You, too, Your Excellency,” the Ambassador replied.

Their meeting with the Great Chief ended there and they were ushered to the guestrooms that had been prepared for them. Wendy and Amelia were currently William’s fiances, so the three of them shared a room.

Five minutes after the attendant left their room, an adorable girl sneakily entered their quarters and hurriedly closed the door behind her.

Her bright and clear gray eyes looked at their guests with a sense of anticipation.

“Do any of you know Ernest?” Brianna, the youngest granddaughter of the Great Chief asked with an innocent smile on her face. She then casually sat on a sitting mat and locked her eyes on William’s handsome face.

“Are you talking about Prince Ernest?” William asked back.

The little loli nodded her head in acknowledgment of William’s question. The smile on her face widened as she looked at William expectantly.

“How is he?” Brianna inquired. “Does he think of me?”

Brianna’s stare was so pure and innocent that William felt that his heart was melting. He then took out a sealed scroll from his storage ring and handed it to the girl who seemed to be a good friend of the Youngest Prince of the Hellan Kingdom.

Before he left for the Northern Regions, the Prince gave William a letter. The Prince said that William should personally hand it to the youngest granddaughter of the Great Chief. He also added that the Knight Commander must ensure that no one else would be there when he passed the letter to her.

Brianna practically snatched the scroll from William’s hand when the boy handed it to her. She immediately broke the seal and started reading the contents of the letter. William, Wendy, and Amelia, watched in amusement as the little girl squirmed in her seat as if reading a letter that had been given to her by her crush.

She let out small giggles from time to time which brightened the mood inside the guest quarters. A few minutes passed before the little loli gently rolled the scroll and placed it inside her own storage ring.

Briana gazed at William with a look of admiration that almost made the Half-Elf avert his gaze due to its intensity.

“Ernest said that you are the youngest Knight Commander in the Hellan Kingdom,” Briana said. “Is it true?”

“Not only the youngest, but the most handsome Knight Commander in the kingdom,” William replied with a smug smile on his face.

“Little Ernie warned me about your narcissism, but seeing is believing.” Brianna giggled. “Well, you are indeed handsome, but give Little Ernie a few years and he will be more handsome than you.”

“Impossible!”

“It’s not impossible!”

“How can that little shrimp compare to me? Just look at how awesome I am. Compare it to that little brat who still hasn’t grown his hair and tell me if he could surpass my good looks,” William raised his head arrogantly. “Even if you give Prince Ernest a hundred years, he would still not be able to reach the level of my handsomeness.”

“No! Little Ernie will be more handsome after a few years!” Brianna disagreed. “My future husband is the best!”

“Tsk, is this what they mean when they say that love is blind?” William muttered. “Fine. I won’t argue with a little Loli. It’s just not worth it.”

Wendy and Amelia, who was seated beside William, giggled at the same time. They knew that their commander was just teasing the young girl, but it was still amusing that the youngest granddaughter of the Great Chief was able to fight back and put the narcissistic Half-Elf in his place.

Brianna’s eyes then sharpened as she cleared her throat. “Tell me, are you all here to ask the Northern Tribes to become your allies?”

Her adorable facade disappeared and was replaced by a serious expression that didn’t match her age.
