Chapter 564: I’m Sorry, But This Is Our Bottom Line

William awoke to soft breathing sounds that tickled his ears.

He glanced at the two beautiful girls that were currently nestled beside his body. They had spent a night of passion where they had consummated their love for each other. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ashe, Princess Sidonie, and Morgana milked him dry, and forced Little Will to wave his flag in surrender. Perhaps, it was their way of punishing William for spending his first time with his Master, who was now nowhere to be found.

It was also that night when William realized that Princess Sidonie’s sin was not just for show. The moment she lost her chastity, the power of her Divinity bloomed and the Princess transformed into a Succubus. The moment she transformed, an exact replica of her separated from her body.

The newcomer was, of course, Morgana.

The two beautiful girls, who looked exactly the same, made love to him like there was no tomorrow.

Ashe’s performance also didn’t lose to Princess Sidonie, and Morgana. The mermaid had done the deed several times with William in the Dreamworld, so her union with the Half-Elf was just as intense, even though it was her first time in the real world.

The relentless attacks of the three girls overwhelmed William. Even though he was already using his Incubus Job Class, he was unable to beat two ravenous succubi, and a jealous mermaid, who were out to milk him dry.

‘I have no regrets,’ William thought as he held the two beauties in his embrace. Morgana had already returned inside Princess Sidonie’s Spiritual World to rest after she had her fill.

William kissed the two sleeping girls on their forehead before closing his eyes to go back to sleep. He was still feeling exhausted, and decided to sleep for an hour or two to regain a little bit of his strength back.

‘I need to buy a bigger bed. A bed that will be big enough for twelve people.’

These were William’s last thoughts before his consciousness sank into sleep’s embrace.

Several hours later, he awoke in bed alone.

The two beauties were no longer there, but the evidence of their lovemaking remained in the sheets. William had no choice but to take all the evidence inside his storage ring to prevent a certain pink-haired girl from discovering them by accident.

William headed to the bathroom to take a bath, before going to the dining room to eat.

The only person inside the residence was Charmaine. According to her, Chiffon had gone to the Atlantis Dungeon with B1, B2, Psoglav, and Erchitu.

William thanked his personal maid because he had assigned Charmaine to prevent Chiffon from coming into his room at all cost. The little girl insisted on sleeping with William that night, like she always did for the past month, but Ashe and Princess Sidonie managed to convince her to rest in the guestroom for one night.

The two girls even made an excuse that they would be doing some secret training with William that shouldn’t be leaked to outsiders. Chiffon was still half in doubt, but after William promised her that this was only a one time thing, she relented and slept with Charmaine in the guestroom.

Chiffon disliked being alone. This was why William asked his personal maid to accompany her to sleep.

After eating his brunch, William drank a rejuvenation potion to speed up the recovery of his body. Today was the day when he was supposed to climb the Tower of Babylon with Chiffon, but he decided to postpone it for a day.

(A/N: Just in case any of you don’t know what brunch is, it is a late morning meal eaten instead of breakfast and lunch. Thank you Google Senpai for the answer.)

William returned to his room and sat on the couch before closing his eyes. There was a place that he wanted to visit first, and he hoped that this time around, he would find something of interest.

Crafting the Devourer’s Gauntlet using the recipe for the Titania’s Gauntlets had been very profitable for William. Because of this, he decided to visit the Auction on a regular basis, hoping to see some treasures that were worth bidding for.

He was also paying attention to rare weapons that the system could help him replicate, to increase the levels of his Smithing and Artificer Job Classes.

‘System, take me to the Auction of the Gods.’

[ Understood. ]

——

A few hours later…

William opened his eyes with a grin.

He left the Villa and asked the system to expand his Thousand Beast Domain another fourteen square miles.

William spent 100,000 God Points for this expansion, but it was not over yet. He asked the system to create a forest in the Northeast Area of the domain to become the home of the new additions to his herd.

The forest that the System made wasn’t an ordinary forest, but an Enchanted Forest filled with rich Spiritual Energy. Now that William had God Points, it was perfectly fine for them to splurge a bit.

The forest cost William 10,000 God Points, bringing the total expenses to 110,000. After everything was prepared, William opened the special feature of the God Shop which was called, Divine Bestiary.

This was where the followers of the Gods could store the beasts that they had bought in the auction before bringing them to their world. Since Beasts were living things, they needed a special storage space that could be used to store them.

Soon a five-meter-tall golden portal appeared beside William. It was the entrance to the Divine Bestiary which housed the Beasts that he had bought from the Auction of the Gods an hour ago.

“Ok, guys, time to come out,” William ordered. “Welcome to your new home.”

As if waiting for that cue, thirteen white Pegasi flew out of the portal one by one. There was a seller in the auction that auctioned a dozen of them, along with their Alpha, and this was something that William couldn’t pass on no matter what.

Fortunately, not many were interested in rearing Pegasus because they were very proud, and aggressive creatures. They were very hard to tame, and all of them were Class A Beasts.

Although they looked majestic, not everyone had the patience to make these beasts submit. Fortunately, William had two ways to make members of the herd submit. The first way was to have a peaceful negotiation.

The second way was to beat the crap out of them before using his Taming Skill to make them submit to him. Either way worked, so William wasn’t too worried about taming any of them.

Among the thirteen Pegasus, four of them were female, which meant that William could allow them to breed and reproduce.

The Pegasi looked at the unfamiliar surroundings with a curious gaze. They were currently inside the clearing of the Enchanted Forest that William had bought to serve as their home.

The most Majestic of them, the Alpha of the Herd, walked to William and raised its head in arrogance.

It was a Centennial Ranked Pegasus, and served as the leader of the group.

William stared at the arrogant, yet dumb, horse who was looking down on him. The Half-Elf had spent 700,000 God Points to buy them all in the auction, so he intended to make them submit at all cost.

“I can feel the aura of the Eternal Guardian coming from you,” The Alpha Pegasus said through telepathy. “Speak! What do you want from us? Are you one of those mortals who wish for us to become your Mounts? Even if you are a disciple of the Eternal Guardian, we will not submit to you.”

The Pegasus words were laced with disdain. It looked at William with ridicule and contempt. Its last owner wasn’t able to tame him and his group, so he decided to put them on auction to gain some God Points.

“Yes,” William replied. “The reason why I bought you and your group was so you would serve as my mounts.”

The Alpha neighed fiercely and pawed the ground, as if preparing to attack William.

“We will never submit to you!” the Alpha Pegasus said fiercely. “No one will be able to make us submit!”

Ten Minutes later…

“Boss, my Pegasi and I are at your service,” the Alpha Pegasus said as it stood with shaking legs. Clearly, it was having trouble standing up and could collapse at any moment. “Please, take good care of us in the future.”

William nodded his head with a smile. The spiked spear in his hand was still bloody after he impaled it in the Pegasus’ bum numerous times until it begged for mercy.

The other Pegasi were huddled at the edge of the clearing, and looking at William with eyes filled with fear. They had been whipped before by their former master, but they endured it and stayed true to their goal of not allowing others to mount them.

However, after seeing William’s barbaric approach to negotiation, all the Pegasi decided that it would be best to compromise than suffer the wrath of William’s spiked spear.

“Boss, we will agree to become mounts, however there is a condition,” the Alpha Pegasus stated. “We can only be mounted by women. I’m sorry, but this is our bottom line.”

“No problem,” William replied. “Now, time for all of you to officially become part of my herd.”

William raised his hand and used his Taming Skill to bind the Pegasi under his command. He was not someone that trusted the verbal promises of the Alpha Pegasus that was known for its stubbornness.

After all the Pegasi had been successfully added to William’s herd, he sent a mental message to Charmaine, as well as the twelve other elven ladies, who were currently residing in the Thousand Beast Domain.

He had already intended to make the Pegasi their flying mounts, so that they could help William in his future battles.

It didn’t take long for the Pegasi, and the Elves to warm up to each other. Both parties were quite satisfied with the arrangement that William had made for them.

“Ladies, it will be your duty to take care of them,” William said. “They will serve as your loyal companions on the battlefield. So, please, make sure to get along well.”

The Elves and the Pegasi nodded their heads in acknowledgement of William’s orders.

“Charmaine, from now on, your unit will be called Valkyries,” William declared. “You will be their leader. I will prepare a training regimen for your unit, so make sure to go to the Dungeon of Atlantis to train regularly during your free time.”

“Yes, Young Master,” Charmaine replied and bowed her head. “I will not let you down.”

William smiled, “Good.”

The Half-Elf left the group and allowed them to bond with each other more. Elves were known for their strong empathy to Magical Beasts, so William was sure that it wouldn’t take long before they would get the hang of aerial warfare.

Also, William could use Rhongomyniad and bestow upon them the Aerial Cavalier Job Class, which would speed up the process of their proficiency.

William checked his status page to check on how many God Points he had left. When he met Lily and the other Gods at the Auction, he tried to pay them back with the God Points that they had loaned him.

However, the Gods just smiled and told him to keep the points because they were just small change for them. Issei, Lily, David, and Lady Eros knew that William needed the God Points more than they needed them.

God Points: 3,440,042

-

‘Just over three million,’ William thought as he teleported to the Dungeon of Atlantis to find Chiffon and the others. For now, he intended to save his points and use them only when it was necessary.

He had a feeling that his remaining God Points would come in handy when he made it to the 51st Floor that no one had managed to conquer for the last thousand years.
