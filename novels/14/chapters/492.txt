Chapter 492: Accompany Me To The Afterlife [Part 2]

“Erchitu!” Psoglav shouted as it was helplessly thrown away by one of its friends.

After ensuring his friends’ safety.

Erchitu turned to face the Elven Riders alone.

“Come!” Erchitu roared. “Accompany me to the afterlife!”

The Giant Ox summoned his weapon. It was a giant Axe that William had personally made for him after the Half-Elf had acquired the Adamantium Mine from the Anaesha Dynasty.

Erchitu brandished his weapon, slicing everything around him. He needed to buy time for Sharx and its Goblin Cavaliers to make their escape.

Arrows, and spells landed on the Giant Ox’s body. Its pristine white fur was now dyed in blood, but Erchitu didn’t care. It held back the Elves for roughly five minutes, before its body was hit by a Dragon Breath by one of the Dragons that had accompanied the Elves in the war.

Erchitu survived the attack, but it was gravely injured. Its legs were already sharking, due to its injuries, but the Giant Ox refused to yield.

“Will,… take care of the rest,” Erchitu said softly as one of the Elven Blademasters pierced his chest with his blade.

The Giant Ox’s eyes lost its luster as it collapsed on the ground. The Wolf Riders were about to let their mounts feast on it, but the Blademaster prevented them from doing so.

Perhaps, out of respect for its bravery, or perhaps it was due to pride, but he didn’t allow anyone to disrespect the body of the Millennial Beast that had risked its life to save its comrades.

“A valiant warrior shouldn’t be treated as food,” the Elven Blademaster stated. “Go. There are plenty of Beasts to kill. You can have your fill by eating them. Leave this Ox alone.”

The Wolf Riders knew that there was no room for negotiation so they charged forward to reinforce the vanguard.

Blood flowed on the ground like a river as the battle continued. Humans, Elves, and Beasts, none were spared from death as the fervor of the battle intensified.

Icarus and Daedalus were both Pseudo-Myriad Beasts. Although their bodies were littered with wounds, and other injuries, they never stopped swinging their Great Axes as they fought for their Sovereign, and their race.

They had joined this war to uphold the vows they had made, and to atone for the one that they had broken.

Flaming Bulls, Minotaurs, Lamassus, and other members of the Minotaur Race fought not like wild beasts, but warriors.

Above them, the Rainbow Birds dove down and showered the Elves with the Magic Missiles that came from William’s lollipops. Some of them hurled the Acid Bombs that William had crafted to compensate for their lack of offensive attacks.

The Acid Bombs exploded in the air, showering the Elves with a powerful acid that made them cry out in pain. Those that were hit in their eyes were immediately blinded, and smoke rose up from their bodies as the acid ate away their flesh.

“Fck all of you!” The Red Bird whom William had given the nickname, B1, dropped all the Acid Bombs in its equipment slot like a Carpet Bomber Plane.

The Blue Bird, B2, waited until the bombs were only a few meters above the Elves before it shot them with magic missiles, creating a powerful chemical explosion that razed those who were unlucky enough to be at the point of impact.

After doing this deed, an arrow pierced its body causing it to fall from the sky.

“Fck… you,” B2 said as it unleashed the acid bombs in its possession before detonating itself, causing a powerful explosion that scorched everything within a twenty-meter-radius.

William’s Angray Birds fought bravely, but after realizing their threat, all the Elves targeted them. This caused the Rainbow Birds no other choice but to detonate themselves, bringing down as many Elves as they could.

Bastian, and the other Centaurs shot Elemental Arrows at the Dragons that were attacking them from the sky.

Thanks to William’s Quiver Trees, the Centaurs were able to get their hands on Elemental Arrows that were strong enough to damage Dragon Scales.

The Qilins were also a problem, and they had no way of dealing with them due to how fast they moved. Fortunately, there was someone in William’s Legion that was capable of harassing these nimble Magical Beasts.

Xerxes, the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor, stood on top of its Black-Scaled Salamander and cast Void Arrows left and right. These Void arrows were different from the usual ones, because they were Homing Void arrows.

After joining William’s Legion, the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor had also been Knighted by William and transformed into a Hobgoblin Arcane Doctor. With its Dual affinities of Dark and Life Magic, Xerxes was able to create powerful spells that had homing capabilities.

Among them were the Void Arrows that it could fire in the hundreds.

Rex, the Hobgoblin Chieftain, stood by its side as a bodyguard. Many had tried to attack Xerxes, but were unable to due to the Black-Scaled Salamander’s powerful body and breath attacks. After being knighted, Xerxes, and his Beast Companion’s rank had jumped to the initial stages of the Millennial Rank.

William didn’t know how it happened, but it just did, and was quite thankful because he had acquired not only one, but two Millennial Beasts with one Knighting Ceremony. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xerxes’ rank was equivalent to a Human Archmage. Because of this, he was a force to reckon with when it came to the Arcane Arts.

Ella had been paying close attention to William as she continued to help and protect her allies. Right now, she was watching over Spire who was recovering from a serious injury it had received from one of the Qilins that had focused its attention on it.

Spire had just entered the Centennial Rank, and was no match against a Beast of the Millennial Rank. If not for Ella’s intervention, the Qilin might have already killed one of William’s first allies.

Right now, Ella was also a Centennial Beast, but a Millennial Beast was nothing to her. Naturally, she couldn’t use her full powers because it would break certain Laws that the Gods had imposed upon themselves.

Also, her current vessel was not strong enough to handle her full powers. If she were to unleash it, her current body would disintegrate due to the power of her Divinity.

Time passed as each side fought for supremacy. Although they were outnumbered, William’s Herd and King’s Legion had their stats doubled and were able to resist to a certain extent.

Seeing that they were unable to annihilate their enemies, Elandorr decided to use the trump cards that Ezkalor had given him earlier.

“Let’s see if all of you will survive after this,” Elandorr sneered. He took out two golden tokens from his storage ring and threw them towards the sky. It was time to end this war, and give the Elves the victory that they deserved.

——

“You need to try harder than that, Child.” Ezkalor taunted as he sent William tumbling in the air after a powerful clash.

“Okay, I will try Harder.” William replied as he wiped away the blood that spilled at the corner of his lips.

The Sword of the Dragon God was truly very formidable and each time he clashed with Ezkalor, William felt that the bones on his hand, and arms, were about to break.

Seeing that he had no other alternative, William summoned Stormcaller.

Eneru was currently fighting against Jekyll and the Qilin had summoned a Lightning Storm and was planning to use it to attack The Alliance, while Jekyll was occupied.

William wouldn’t allow such a thing to happen as he pointed Stormcaller’s tip at the Dark Cloud that hung in the sky. Lightning bolts fell down on Stormcaller and it greedily absorbed it all. The Half-Elf had decided to go all out, and decided to no longer hide the fact that he could wield lightning.

Also, he was planning to use the Trump Card that he had recently developed while increasing his levels in the Dungeon of Atlantis.

“Lightning God War Art and Quick Shot Shepherd Fusion Form!”

“Strike with unparalleled precision, Gungnir!”

Stormcaller glowed as William imbued it with the power of his Lightning God War Art. However, he didn’t hurl it towards the Ancient Dragon, because he was still not finished with his preparations.

A new power was imbued in Stormcaller and the lightning bolts that crackled on its tip intensified.

“Destroy everything in your path,” William roared as he threw the spear forward. “Railgun!”

Ezkalor was about to dodge to the side when his battle sense that had been honed for thousands of years kicked in. The Elder Dragon immediately vanished into thin air, and Stormcaller stopped in place, hovering at a location.

Sensing that he was facing something that had the ability to threaten his life, Ezkalor subconsciously entered his own Domain, which saved him from experiencing one of William’s most deadly combination attacks.

This War Art Fusion was something that he had suggested to the system, and the latter recommended that he use God Points in order to upgrade the capability of the CPU Core.

William had long wondered if his different War Arts could be combined into one, so he didn’t hesitate and did the System Upgrade. After experimenting with it in the Dungeon of Atlantis, William had created several powerful combinations using his Lightning God War Art and his Quick Shot Shepherd War Art.

Unfortunately, his opponent had sensed the danger that he was in and chose to hide for the time being.

William took this opportunity to descend to the battlefield, just in time to see the two Golden Portals that Elandorr had summoned.

A twenty-meter long Winged Serpent emerged from the Golden Portal and roared in the air.

It was followed by a five-meter tall Deer, whose antlers shone like the colors of the rainbow.

The Winged Serpent, Drakon Nalzrig and the Guardian Deer, Zyphon, had appeared on the battlefield

The two Guardians had given their tokens to Ezkalor and told him to only summon them if the Elves were in dire need of help.

Although he was reluctant to do so, he still decided to entrust the summoning tokens to Elandorr since he was the Commander of the Elves.

He made sure that the young commander understood the repercussions for summoning them without proper reason.

Since the Elves were currently at a disadvantage, Elandorr didn’t hesitate and used the two tokens of the Guardian Beasts to allow them to be summoned from the Silvermoon Continent and make an appearance on the battlefield.

Jekyll was busy fighting off against Eneru, while Icarus and Daedalus fought alongside their brethren and dealt with the Magical Beasts of the Elven Army.

Drakon Nalzrig saw Dia, who was at the center of the millions of the beasts, and frowned. He could feel that the Golden-Winged Serpent was still young and had only finished her first growth phase.

Nalzrig roared towards Dia, commanding her to submit to his will. However, to his surprise, the latter roared back in rejection.

Dia was born from William’s blood and the power of the Dungeon Cores. She was not a Winged Serpent that would just follow anyone’s orders. William was her one and only Master, aside from him, and her chosen partner, Est, Dia would not submit to anyone.

“Foolish child,” Nalzrig bellowed. “Allow me to educate you!”

However before Nalzrig could even do what he wanted, he felt something dangerous coming from the sky and immediately coated his body with a screen of draconic energy.

A powerful explosion took place in the sky as William unleashed his Grand Bazooka at the Winged Serpent who dared to attack Dia.

Zyphon, the Guardian Deer of the Elves, raised its head and looked at William in shock. It clearly felt the power of a familiar Divinity inside William’s body.

It then gazed around and confirmed the hunch that formed inside of his head.

‘The Minotaur Race,’ Zyphon thought. ‘There’s no doubt about it. This child is…’

William arrived beside Dia and patted her head. “Don’t worry, I’ll deal with him. Est, command the army from the rear.”

“Understood,” Est replied as Dia flew back near the rear of the army.

William stood firmly on top of a cloud as he gazed at the new threats that appeared in front of him. Earlier, although they were still at a disadvantage, it was still fine. However, the arrival of the two other Guardians had destroyed the balance that they fought so hard to achieve.

Although Drakon Nalzrig and Zyphon still hadn’t done anything, the pressure on the Alliance’s side grew the moment they made their appearance. The Elven Army, the Alliance, and the Beast Army, had all backed away and separated from each other.

Around them, the dead numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Humans, Elves, and Beasts alike laid on the ground, bereft of life.
