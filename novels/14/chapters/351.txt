Chapter 351: Give Me Your Babies

Princess Sidonie and Morgana watched as the boy, whom they liked, raised his hand and lovingly… pinched their nose without any warning whatsoever!

“Kneel? Sorry, Princess, you don’t have the authority to make me kneel,” William said in a teasing tone. “Even if my lovers were to ask me to kneel, my knees will not bend. I am a man of character and my loyalty is hard to claim. Please, look for someone else to become your Knight. This Sir is not interested.”

William reluctantly let go of the Princess’ nose and the latter hurriedly took a few steps back in shock.

“Y-You dare pinch my nose?!” Princess Sidonie was shocked because this was the first time someone dared to act this rude towards her. “Wait, that’s not the problem, why aren’t you kneeling?!”

“Didn’t I state the reason just a moment ago? Like I said earlier, Princess, you don’t have the authority to make me kneel.”

“Impossible! How can you not obey my order?!”

Priscilla, who was standing at the side, looked at William in disbelief. She was one of Princess Sidonie’s loyal retainers who had traveled to the Hellan Kingdom in order to gather information for possible candidates that would serve under the Princess. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

William was one of the candidates that Priscilla had deemed able to match her Mistress’ beauty and brain. If the Commander of the Angorian Knight Order became one of Princess Sidonie’s loyal retainers then she would gain an overwhelming influence within the Hellan Kingdom.

For a brief moment, Princess Sidonie thought that her power was not working. However, Morgana assured her that it was working perfectly.

[ Switch with me, Sidonie. Let’s see if that Half-Elf can resist my charms! ]

‘Okay.’

Princess Sidonie passed the baton to her other half, Morgana, so she could deal with this unexpected situation. The moment Morgana took control of Sidonie’s body, the Princess’ aura changed.

Her hazel eyes turned a golden hue as she approached William with a seductive smile. Without asking for the Half-Elf’s permission, Morgana grabbed his hand and pressed it over her chest.

“I want to give birth to your babies,” Morgana said as she stared at William’s eyes lovingly. “Give me your babies.”

Princess Sidonie, who was watching from inside their Mindscape, covered her face in embarrassment. She didn’t expect her Big Sister to act so shamelessly in front of William and even demand that he give her his babies!

‘Noooo!’ Princess Sidonie screamed internally as her entire face turned beet red in shame and embarrassment. How she wished that she could dig a hole within their Sea of Consciousness, so she could bury herself in it.

William raised an eyebrow because of the Princess’ unexpected action. If he was still the naive boy in his past life, he would definitely try to squeeze the soft chest that was right under the palm of his hand.

Unfortunately, William had not only touched, but had done more things to the adult Wendy in his dreams. Not only that, he had also been trained by the Goddess of Lust herself in order to resist charms and seduction.

The Half-Elf was now a veteran who would not easily bend to a beautiful lady’s seductive charms.

There had been some girls who confessed to him back in the academy, but he rejected them all because he wasn’t the type to take things half-heartedly. At that time, he was dealing with the issue with Carter and his feelings for Wendy had just started to bloom.

However, this was the first time that someone asked him directly to give them his babies. Even though William was thick-skinned, he wasn’t able to stop himself from being shocked at the Princess’ unexpected demand.

“You want my babies?” William inquired.

He felt like the Princess was just joking, so he decided to confirm what she said just in case he misheard her.

“Yes. I want to give birth to two of your kids. A girl and a boy. We will name the girl Abbie and the boy Alex,” Morgana nodded. “If you want more, I can give you more, but I am worried that my figure will suffer because of the child bearing. At most, I can promise you three. How about it? Will you give me your babies?”

The corner of William’s lips twitched. If he wasn’t sure earlier, he was sure now that the lady in front of him was serious. She had even thought of the names of their children!

William had to admit that the Princess was someone that he couldn’t take lightly.

Princess Sidonie who was inside her Sea of Consciousness had already crouched down on the ground, closed her eyes, and covered her ears with her hands. She was also chanting the phrases “This is not happening”, and “This isn’t real” repeatedly as if trying to hypnotize herself that this was all just a dream.

A few moments ago she only wanted to bury herself in a hole. Now, she wanted to slam her head against the wall to knock herself unconscious from the embarrassment.

“I’m sorry, Princess.” William shook his head as he slowly, but firmly, pulled his hand away from her soft chest. “Right now, I already have four lovers waiting for me. Although I can tell that you are somewhat serious about me, I don’t think that I will be able to return your feelings.”

Morgana raised an eyebrow then shot Priscilla a glance. The latter immediately shook her head, which meant that she wasn’t aware that William had other lovers. The only potential lover she knew was Wendy, who was always by William’s side.

“What are their names?” Morgana asked in a dangerous voice. She and Sidonie had always gotten what they wanted and this was the first time that someone actually dared to refuse their advances.

If Lionel and the men of the Kingdom of Freesia were to know that their beloved Princess wanted William to become her lover, they would all hack him to pieces in order to take his place!

The red-headed boy could sense the subtle killing intent in the Princess’ words. His instincts were telling him that if he ever mentioned his lovers’ names, the angelic beauty in front of him would do everything in her power to erase them from the face of the Earth.

‘And here I thought that my Master was the only one who was the crazy kind of crazy,’ William’s expression became serious as he stared at the golden-eyed beauty in front of him. He could sense a pressure that was different from her Physical and Magical presence.

‘She’s strong,’ William thought. ‘This Spiritual pressure is insane.’

William hurriedly used his appraisal skill on the Princess. After the new features of The System were unlocked, his appraisal skill was now able to reveal some information about people as well.
