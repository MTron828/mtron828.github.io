Chapter 276: Conquest Of The Southern Continent

Silvermoon Continent…

“Finally, the time has come,” A middle-aged elf looked at the Elven Battle Ships anchored at the port with his hands behind his back.

“Patriarch, the representatives of the Saleh, Nasir, Rhys, and Eroan Clans have arrived.

“Good. Let’s go.”

“Yes, Patriarch.”

The middle-aged man met the representatives of the different clans at a villa overlooking the ocean. There, the teenage elves looked at the flagships that floated on the water with determined expressions on their faces.

When the middle-aged elf arrived, all of them stood at attention and pressed their fists against their chests in greeting.

“”All Hail the Great Elder!””

“Be at ease, let’s start the meeting.”

The middle-aged man sat on a raised chair while the other Elves sat on theirs.

“This is an important mission that I will be assigning to all of you, young prodigies of the proud Elven Clans of the Silvermoon Continent,” the middle-aged man said in a confident tone. “This mission will be dangerous, but the rewards are equally high.”

Everyone’s gazes were locked on the middle-aged man’s face as they digested every word that he said. The Patriarchs of their respective clans didn’t tell them anything. All they said was that the geniuses of their bloodline would undertake a mission for the glory of the entire Elven Race.

The middle-aged man scanned the eager faces of the young Elves and nodded with approval.

“Your mission is the conquest of the Southern Continent,” the middle-aged man explained. “Once you arrive there, you will find that the four kingdoms will be ripe for the picking. I want all of you, in the fastest possible time, to subjugate them in one fell swoop.The one that will oversee this mission will be my grandson, Elandorr.”

The middle-aged man made a gesture and a handsome Elf with blonde hair and green eyes walked towards him.

From all angles, Elandorr looked like a young man in his late teens. He was radiating a charm and charisma that made the young ladies among the Elves look at him with great interest. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“As I mentioned earlier, he will be the commander of this operation. I expect all of you to obey his orders for I believe that he is more than capable enough to lead all of you in this great undertaking,” the middle-aged man continued his speech. “The other clans are unaware of this mission, and I would like to keep it that way.

“Now, go. Capture the Southern Continent and make it the new territory of the Elves! Gone are the days when our brethren are hunted down to be turned as slaves. It is now our time to turn Humans into slaves! The Elves will finally end our hundred years of silence and begin our conquest of the Human lands! May the Goddesses of the Moon bless us all!”

“”May the Goddesses of the Moon bless us all!””

Central Continent…

A man with graying hair stood on top of a pyramid, overlooking the young warriors that had gathered from all over his empire. He had already been alerted that the war in the Southern Continent was about to begin, and it was now time to take a share of the conflict.

His name was Leonidas, the Great Emperor of the Kraetor Empire. A force that not many dared to offend in the Southern Continent. It was well-known for its military might that had brought many nations to their knees and made them part of its vast empire.

Just like the Four Kingdoms of the Southern Continent, The Kraetor Empire was one of the Eight Overlords of the Central Continent. Being one of the top eight factions in a continent that was twenty times bigger than the Southern Continent, proved how formidable it was.

“Go with haste, and reach the shores of the Southern Continent in a month’s time,” the Great Emperor of the Kraetor Empire ordered. “It’s time to stake a claim on distant shores! Conquer them in the name of the Kraetor Empire! Capture those who submit and kill those who oppose us! All of you are the proud warriors of our Empire! Glory to Kraetor!”

“”Glory to Kraetor!”” The young warriors raised their weapons in unison.

“Make my Granddaughter the Queen of the Southern Continent!” Great Emperor Leonidas ordered. “Let them know the might of our empire!”

“”Glory to Kraetor!””

Zagarl Rannath, the Demon Commander and Carter’s direct superior, gathered his forces.

Only ten days remained before the Inter-Division Battle in the Hellan Royal Academy was to occur. Carter’s reports were very positive and it made him look forward to the great harvest that they would have in a few days’ time.

He was currently making his final preparations to bring back the “broodmares” that Carter had ensnared in the academy. Commander Zagarl wouldn’t be participating in the retrieval operation, because he was guarding their borders against the persistent invasion from the Dark Elves who had, for some unknown reason, broken off their alliance.

To this day, Commander Zagarl had no idea what the dark-skinned race was thinking. All he knew was that the other forces within the Demon Continent were also looking forward to the aftermath of the conflict between the two sides.

Because of this, he had assigned his right hand to oversee the mission personally to ensure its success.

Their plan was very simple. Enter the Southern Continent through the hidden teleport gate that they had built long ago, and connect to Carter’s make-shift two-way dimensional gate within the academy.

They would help Carter conduct a massacre, but their main role was to capture the young ladies to bring back the Demon Continent. It would be a “Blitzkrieg Attack” that would last for less than half an hour before they returned to the Demon Continent in haste.

In order to facilitate the teleport gates, the Demon Race had prepared a tenth of the Magic Crystals that they had stored over the years. That was a lot of resources, so their mission mustn’t fail at all cost.

Aside from young ladies of the Magic Division, the Demons would also capture the ladies from the Spirit Division. What the Demon Race needed were warriors that would be born with magic and spirit power. They already had strong bodies, so taking captives from the Martial Division would just be a waste of their time.

Ten thousand demon warriors. This was the number that Commander Zagarl had gathered for this massive undertaking.

Their “accomplices” in the Hellan Kingdom would create a barrier around the academy to prevent reinforcements from getting in their way. Commander Zagarl was very confident with this plan, so he wasn’t worried about the results.

All that he was worried about was that the Demon Warriors would accidentally break the girls once they were brought back to their domain. Unlike Demons, human women were more delicate and prone to injuries.

This was why he had repeated over and over again that anyone who dared to indulge themselves during the mission would be killed on the spot. This was the only way to prevent the unnecessary loss of broodmares that would give birth to the next generation of demons that held powerful abilities.

What he didn’t know was that his “trusted” agent within the Royal Academy had had a change of heart and formulated his own plan as well. Although “Carter” still felt loyal to the Demon Race, the temptation of the Divinity inside William’s body was too much for him to ignore.

Because of this, there would be slight deviations to the “Demonic Invasion” that Commander Zagarl thought was already in the bag.
