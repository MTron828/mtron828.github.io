Chapter 247: Don’t Worry. I Won’t Let Him Marry You

In the beginning, William wasn’t planning on doing anything. However, when Prince Aizel was about to grab Brianna’s hand, his body moved subconsciously.

When he came to himself, he was already grabbing the Second Prince’s hand and looking at the latter’s glaring face.

Perhaps, due to himself being a victim of an arranged marriage, William felt that Brianna was very pitiful. She had just turned eleven, but was now forced to marry someone she didn’t even like.

For a brief moment, the image of Brianna’s clear and confident eyes appeared inside William’s mind. In the next instant, those same eyes clouded over and lost their brilliance. Deep inside his heart, the Half-Elf didn’t want the lively young lady to lose her radiance.

Because of this, his body moved before his mind could even think of a way to save the young girl. While the second prince was talking, the system had informed William that there was a special rule in the Peak of Chivalry that allowed special challenges to be issued.

This peak was used to settle disputes between the tribe in the form of one-on-one mortal combat. This was a bloody tradition in the Northern Tribes, but it was a tradition that all of them recognized.

No matter what happened, no matter the result, the winner was King!

Great Chief Evander stared at William with a serious expression. The phrase “The Wind may blow, but the Ice will never melt” had a significant meaning to the Northern Tribe. It was the promise that their Great Sovereign had given them before he ascended to the First Peak of Divinity.

Since then, their Sovereign had never again appeared before them. However, his blessing still remained. Only the Oracle, who served their Lord, would descend from the First Peak to relay their Sovereign’s order.

Ignoring this phrase was tantamount to ignoring the Sovereign’s pledge to his people. Great Chief Evander breathed deeply before reluctantly acknowledging William’s challenge.

“The Wind may blow, but the Ice will never melt,” Evander said. He then looked at the Second Prince of the Dynasty of Anaesha and sighed internally. He had already given his word, but he was powerless against the rules of their domain.

He’d rather break his promise to a mortal prince than ignore the pledge of a Demigod.

“According to the laws of our tribe, within the Peak of Chivalry, challenges can be issued if there is a conflict of interest,” Great Chief Evander stated with a serious expression. “Since the representative from the Hellan Kingdom also wishes to marry my granddaughter then a fair duel is needed. This is the law of our people.”

“Great Chief, need I remind you that…,” Prince Aziel wasn’t able to finish his sentence because Great Chief Evander had thrown an onyx medallion in his direction.

“I’ve returned the token that you have given me.” Great Chief Evander stood straight and released his imposing aura. “If you wish to be betrothed to my granddaughter, you will have to fight for her hand in marriage. If not then she will become this… boy’s bride.”

Prince Aziel narrowed his eyes. His mission was to ensure that the alliance between their Dynasty and the Northern Tribes succeeded. This was why his father had entrusted the medallion in his hand as a bargaining chip for Brianna’s hand in marriage.

The Second Prince knew that he couldn’t back down from this duel, because he would be ridiculed by his brothers if he returned as a failure.

Prince Aziel wasn’t afraid of fighting William in a duel because he was a warrior. The Anaesha Dynasty was a dynasty that was ruled by military strength. All the weaklings were weeded out, and this also included the members of the Royal Family.

The Prince had fought several duels before he was recognized by his father. It was also why he was the one chosen for this extremely important mission. If he succeeded then he would be showered with praises. If he failed…

“To think that a Half-Elf slave would dare to challenge this Prince. How the Mighty Hellan Kingdom has fallen,” Prince Aziel said with contempt. “Tell me slave, who are you and what is your standing in your kingdom?”

William shifted his head to the side to look at the glaring Prince who was so close to having one of his blood vessels ruptured.

“William Von Ainsworth,” William said with a smile. “I am the Commander of the Second Knight Order of the Hellan Kingdom.”

William then gazed at Great Chief Evander as he continued his speech. “I am the Commander of the Angorian War Sovereign. Nice to meet all of you.”

Great Chief Evander’s, Liam’s, and Connal’s eyes widened in surprise. The warriors that surrounded the great hall, on the other hand, started to whisper at each other while glancing at William from time to time.

“A Slave Commander?” Prince Aziel chuckled. “This is the most ridiculous thing that I have ever heard in my life. Very well, I accept your challenge, Slave.”

Prince Aziel stepped forward and looked down on William because he was half a meter taller than the boy. “I will ensure that you understand your position in society. I’ll trample on your face and use it as a sharpener for my sword. I will make sure that you regret challenging this Prince.”

“You know, that is what all the side-characters say,” William replied. “Since you are able to spout this bunch of nonsense, that means that you are just a small fry in the Anaesha Dynasty.”

A loud clap resounded inside the great hall as William’s wooden staff and Prince Aziel’s sword clashed against each other. In that initial clash, both men were able to hold their ground.

“I guess you can back your words to a certain extent,” Prince Aziel said. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Mmm.” William hummed. “However, I’m more handsome than you, so it’s still my win.”

“Keep talking while you still have your tongue, brat.”

“Did anyone tell you that you have bad breath?”

The two were about to clash again when Great Chief Evander clapped his hands to put a stop to young men who were very close to fighting inside the banquet hall.

“Since the two of you are going to fight, we will relocate to the Arena of Chivalry,” Evander declared. “All the warriors of the Northern Region will witness this battle. Do your best and show us the might of the Hellan Kingdom and the Anaesha Dynasty.”

Prince Aziel snorted and backed away. He returned to his table in a bad mood.

“Don’t worry,” William said as he patted Brianna’s head. “I won’t let him marry you.”

William didn’t wait for Brianna’s reply and returned to his table. As soon as he arrived, Sir Jerkins dragged him to the side and talked to him in hushed whispers.

“Why did you do that?” Jerkins inquired. “We are already in a precarious situation. We might not even be able to leave this place if the Tribes have really allied with the Two Dynasties.”

William patted the ambassador’s shoulder, “It is because we are in this precarious situation that we must show our strength. If the warriors of the Northern Tribe recognize our valor, they will be less willing to put us under house arrest.”

The Half-Elf gave the Ambassador a refreshing smile as glanced in the direction of the Second Prince of Anaesha. “Besides, wouldn’t this be a good opportunity to kill a prince? Once he’s dead, the Anaesha Dynasty and the Northern Tribes will end up in conflict. Isn’t this a good thing for us?”

Sir Jerkins quieted down for a few seconds. He never expected the young boy in front of him to be resolute in taking down a Prince from the neighboring dynasty. After organizing his thoughts, he finally asked the most important question.

“Can you beat him?”

William smiled, “I have no choice but to beat him. If I don’t beat him, we will have no chance of leaving this place alive.”

William didn’t lie. Right now, they were deep inside the enemy’s territory. The only way for them to survive was to create as much chaos as possible and break the Tri-Party Alliance that had been formed between the Two Dynasties and the Northern Tribe of the Kyrintor Mountains.
