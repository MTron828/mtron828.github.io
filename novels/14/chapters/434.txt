Chapter 434: Kinship Evolution

“Noooooooo!”

“Run!”

“Forgive me!”

“Please! Have mercy!”

“I don’t want to Die!”

Floyd gritted his teeth as blood seeped from the corner of his lips. He ignored the despairing screams around him and decisively used the teleportation artifact in his possession.

It was his life saving trump card that would send him thousands of miles away from the Nightmare that was currently unfolding in front of him. Never in his wildest dreams did he think that he would meet an existence that stood above the food chain in one of the only small towns that could be found in the countryside.

If he had only known that such an existence was safeguarding Lont, he wouldn’t have dared to sneak inside the town with his men to capture Celine and the surviving members of the Ainsworth Family.

The last thing that Floyd saw was the cold, chilling, gaze of a middle-aged man with long black hair before he sent himself thousands of miles away from the person who had single handedly dealt with the elite members of his organization.

Floyd appeared on top of a mountain overlooking the capital city of Gladiolus. His shaky legs gave way under him and he collapsed on the ground gasping for breath.

‘Curse you, Celine!’ Floyd gnashed his teeth in anger. He had seen the beautiful Elf with her arms crossed over her chest while looking at his and his men’s suffering.

Celine didn’t even bother to hide the disdain on her face. It was as if she was telling Floyd that he was an idiot for even thinking of going against her.

The scholar cursed Celine’s name over and over again until he finally calmed down. He was quite worried about the fate of his subordinates, but he didn’t dare return to Lont to see if any of them had managed to escape.

Floyd had barely escaped with his life, so he wasn’t too optimistic about the survival of his men.

He was at a loss about what to do because the traumatic experience was still fresh in his mind.

The disheveled scholar stared at the city in the distance with a dazed expression. Only when the sun rose from the East did he start to stir.

Floyd stood and walked in the direction of his lab with shaky steps. Clearly, even after a few hours of meditation, he still wasn’t able to clear his mind from the penetrating stare of the Demigod that had wormed its way inside his heart and soul.

“Dark Thrash!” Wendy ordered.

A three-meter-tall, Black Husky, with blue lightning bolts streaked through its fur, and steel blades shaped like wings on its back and front legs, charged with incredible speed at its targets.

Wendy sat firmly on its back as the tip of her spear thrust forward. Flashes of lightning illuminated the surroundings as Thor twisted it’s body to the side. Moments later, the Black Husky reappeared a few meters away from its target.

The upper half of the Blue-Scaled Naga’s body slid to the side before collapsing on the ground. Blue blood spurted in the air like a fountain as the Boss Monster of the Twentieth Floor died under Thor’s and Wendy’s Special Attack.

Wendy patted her new mount, Thor, and praised it for doing a good job as they looked at the Monster they had felled together.

Unlike the Goblin Crypt, the monsters in the Dungeon of Atlantis don’t turn into particles of light when they died. Their corpses remain after they were killed, and would be absorbed by the dungeon after an hour if left alone.

Perhaps this is due to the Dungeon’s High-Rank, or perhaps it was due to other factors. Right now, William and the System didn’t have enough information about High-Rank dungeons in his world. They were planning to visit other dungeons to investigate more and compare it to the unusual traits of the Dungeon of Atlantis.

William threw the corpse through a portal that led to his Thousand Beast Domain. He had already assigned some Goblin Warriors and Centaurs, that specialized in dismantling beast corpses, to handle the dirty work.

Ragnar, sat beside Ashe and looked at this scene with a calm expression. However, that was only on the surface. If one looked at its back, its tail was wagging excitedly left and right as if it was itching to join in the action and kill some Boss Monsters as well.

After the two finished their Growth phase, their ranks immediately jumped to Class B (Mid) Beasts. However, it didn’t end there. For some reason, the King Chess Piece resonated within William’s Spiritual World and unlocked a special function that became available to his Familia Members.

This function was called Kinship Evolution.

William already had this skill in his Quick Shot Shepherd Job Class, but he still hadn’t assigned any skill points to it. He had been so busy crafting acid bombs for his Aerial Cavalry that he didn’t have the time to upgrade the level of his Quick Shot Shepherd Job Class.

His Alchemist Job Class had reached its max level just a day ago, which also marked the completion of his Acid Bomb Project. This was why he decided to join Wendy, Ashe, Est, and Isaac, in their dungeon fight against the Boss Monster of the Twentieth Floor.

William knew that he would need the power of his main Job Class, so he decided to increase its level to the limit as well.

He was able to practice alchemy with peace of mind because Ashe and Wendy had been leveling his other Job Classes for him.

This was the advantage of having a Familia. William could just assign any Job Class to them and allow the two girls to increase its level, while the Half-Elf focused on equipping his King’s Legion with powerful bombs that would be used in the future.

His only regret was that he was unable to enter Est’s Dreams and accidentally *Ahem* add her to his Familia as well. There was some kind of powerful barrier that prevented William from entering her dreams.

Although William felt a little regretful, he wasn’t too bothered by it. From time to time, Est would come to find him and the two of them would train inside William’s world.

What kind of training are they doing? Of course it was a training to allow Est to increase her knowledge when it came to the things that lovers did.

Est was still very passive and allowed William to teach her the things that she needed to know. From kissing, headpats, cuddling, hand holding, and anything in between, William patiently taught his timid lover, who had the knack of making his heart skip a beat due to her cute reactions, everytime they did THIS and THAT.

While the Half-Elf was remembering the intimate kiss he shared with East just a few hours ago, Wendy jumped off Thor’s back and the latter returned to his original form, which was only half a meter tall.

‘Maybe I should get that Kinship Evolution skill and try it with Mama,’ William thought. ‘I wonder what form she would transform into?’

“Ruff!”

“Don’t worry, we will get our turn next.” Ashe patted Ragnar’s head and the latter wagged its tail happily.

In the past, Ian and Ragnar didn’t get along. It was because Ragnar felt that Ian hated William, whom it recognized as its parent. Now, it was able to feel Ashe’s love for William, which made Ragnar’s attitude to Ashe have a complete reversal.

Just like Wendy, Ashe had also gained the ability of Kinship Evolution and her partner was none other than Ragnar.

Ashe had tried to use this ability a few hours ago and the result far surpassed William’s expectations. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When Thor and Ragnar underwent Kinship Evolution, their Ranks immediately jumped to the Centennial Rank.

Thor’s Centennial Form was called Blade Xolotl, and Ragnar’s Centennial Form was Grand Cerberus.

As the name suggested, Ragnar would transform into a three-meter-tall, three-headed-dog that wielded the power of Fire, Wind, and Earth. With Ashe wielding the element of Water, the two of them were able to form combination attacks by merging the elements together.

Est felt very jealous about this because she knew that the two beasts were William’s kids, born from his blood. Technically, they were his babies and two of these babies were now chummy with William’s other lovers, which made her feel left out.

Because of this, William promised her that he would ask Dia if she was willing to become Est’s companion, once she woke up. This made Est very happy because Dia was also William’s baby, so naturally, Dia would then become her baby also.

It was at that moment when Oliver received a message from Celine through their special means of communication.

After receiving his Mistress’ message, the Parrot Monkey asked William if the two of them could go somewhere private so they could talk.

William knew that his Second Master wouldn’t ask him to talk in private if it wasn’t important, so he bid his lovers goodbye and told them to return to the Chieftain’s Residence for the time being.

Although Brianna turned a blind eye to their disappearances every now and then, William knew that the adorable loli’s inner curiosity would make her want to know where they went whenever they disappeared from the residence.

Although William didn’t mind sharing his secrets with Brianna, he still held back in the end. The granddaughter of the Great Chieftain was quite mature for her age.

William was afraid that if Brianna discovered that he had a Domain, a private army, and a couple Dungeons that he could visit whenever he wanted, she would do her best to try and join in on the fun and beg him to allow her to go with them.

Although William trusted Brianna, he didn’t trust Prince Ernest. If possible, he didn’t want any members of the Royal Family to learn about his secrets. He was still disgusted about the fact that Prince Lionel had betrayed their Kingdom and even tried to capture his Big Brother and Big Sister.

If the Crown Prince hadn’t been imprisoned by the members of The Organization, he might have already killed the bastard Prince and fed his corpse to the Supreme Killer Koalas inside his Thousand Beast Domain.
