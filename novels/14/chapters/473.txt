Chapter 473: Nice To Meet You, Fellow Demigod

William reappeared above the dark-gray clouds that covered the entire Southern Continent. His right hand was firmly holding Soleil’s handle, while the other was pressed over his chest to calm his heart that was beating like a drum in a festival.

‘Fortunately, I have Soleil,’ William thought as he felt his body slowly becoming as heavy as led. The adrenaline rush had started to recede, and he was slowly feeling the after effects of using his Heroic Avatar.

This ability of his had Two Stages. The first one was for him to wield the power of the Monkey King in any way that he wanted. He could stay in this form for an hour at most.

The Second Stage is to summon Sun Wukong to Hestia to fight by his side. If he chose to activate the second stage, the Heroic Avatar would only last for half an hour. However, Sun Wukong would be able to unleash his full powers without any restriction.

Unfortunately, this skill had a very long cooldown. Once William summoned Sun Wukong to Hestia, he wouldn’t be able to summon him again for a month.

This was William’s ultimate Trump Card because Sun Wukong had the power of a Pseudo Demigod. He even wondered if the Monkey King would be able to fight against Drauum who was pretty much invincible, as long as the Ancient Golem stood on the ground.

William merged with Soleil and flew towards the South. He didn’t intend to return to the Hellan Kingdom right away. The Half-Elf decided that he would first visit the Sanctuary of the Minotaur Race.

When he was there the last time, he somehow felt that the gate was resonating with him. It was as if the gate would open up to him and allow him to pass, if he wished for it. Halfway through the journey, William decided to descend to the ground to rest. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He planned to rest inside the Thousand Beast Domain and continue his journey when the sun had risen. However, before everything else, he first contacted his spy who was currently monitoring the events near the city where he had been encircled by the Guardians and the Elven Elites.

“Aethon,” William said softly. “How are things on your end?”

“Chirp!”

The Wren chirped happily as it reported that Eneru had lost his marbles and was currently roaring like there’s no tomorrow.

William chuckled as the image of the arrogant Qilin, whose face was distorted with rage, appeared inside his mind.

“Rest for now and continue your report tomorrow,” William ordered. “Inform me once the Elven Army starts to move.

“Chirp!”

William cut the connection and took a step forward. He reappeared inside the Thousand Beast Domain where everyone was waiting for him.

“Will!” Wendy threw herself at her lover, who had refused to let any of them participate in the destruction of the Teleportation Gates.

William hurriedly opened his arms to catch his First Wife who had an anxious expression on her face.

Wendy latched onto him like a Koala, refusing to let go. She, as well as everyone inside the Domain, had witnessed how William faced the powerful enemies alone, and had almost been captured at the last moment.

William and the System had worked together to create a Movie like Projection inside the Thousand Beast Domain, to allow everyone to see the battle. The reason why William didn’t allow them to participate was due to Eneru’s and Drauum’s existences.

If William was alone, he would be able to escape whenever he wanted to, without needing to worry about the safety of others. Although Wendy, Ashe, and Est protested, he didn’t budge in his decision.

Celine, Kasogonaga, and the other denizens of the Thousand Beast Domain also understood that William was right. In the face of absolute strength, all tricks were meaningless.

“Are you really alright?” Wendy asked “Are you hurt anywhere?”

The blonde beauty touched William all over. William felt ticklish as his lover’s hand wandered over his injuries.

Wendy breathed a sigh of relief because, aside from the tears in William’s clothes and a few minor bruises, the Half-Elf was fine.

“Heal,” Wendy said as she used the power of the Life Mage to heal William’s injuries.

A few seconds later, the bruises disappeared and the heavy feeling from the Heroic Avatar’s side effects was washed away by the gentle light that enveloped William’s body.

“Thank you, Wendy,” William said as he kissed her cheek.

“You’re welcome,” Wendy replied. “However, you should rest. Although I healed your injuries, the exhaustion in your body is still there.”

William nodded. He then faced everyone that had given him moral support from inside the Thousand Beast Domain, while he was fighting against the Elves and the Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent.

“You have all witnessed what we will be facing in the future,” William said with a serious expression. “The Qilin, Eneru, the Ancient Golem, Drauum, and an Elder Dragon, Ezkalor. These three stand at the top of the Elven Hierarchy, and they are the foes that we cannot beat at this point in time.”

All the denizens of the Thousand Beast Domain had solemn expressions on their faces. They understood that there was no way that they could contend with Myriad Beasts and a Pseudo-Demigod, even if they had the numbers.

“Hmp! If only I hadn’t regressed during my time of imprisonment, I would have easily stomped that Golem under my foot!” Kasogonaga stated hatefully.

“You? Stomp on a Pseudo-Demigod?” Psoglav chuckled. “You sure say funny things, Kasogonaga.”

“What’s so funny about it? I’m a Demigod!”

“Oh? What a coincidence! I am also a Demigod. Nice to meet you, fellow Demigod.”

Kasogonaga stomped its foot in irritation. It could tell that Psoglav didn’t believe that it was a former Demigod. The rainbow-colored Anteater was very tempted to roll up into a ball and flatten the grinning Demonic Dog like a pizza dough.

William chuckled internally, but he didn’t say anything. Kasogonaga and Psoglav had, surprisingly, become buddies during their dungeon expeditions in Atlantis. At first, the Anteater and Demonic Dog were at odds against each other, but now, they got along pretty well.

He hoped that the Beasts he had captured recently would also form bonds with the first residents of his Domain and get along with each other as well.

“You don’t have to worry about the Guardians of the Elves,” William stated. “There will be others who will face them head on. What you need to worry about is the bulk of the Elven Army. They are the foes that we will meet on the battlefield.”

William paused as he scanned the faces of his lovers, his Master, and his knights. All of them looked back at him with determination in their eyes.

He knew that they would not hesitate to fight side by side with him when the Elves arrived at the Capital City of Gladiolus.

‘The conclusion of this battle will be decided in Gladiolus,’ William thought. ‘Conner, I hope that you have made enough preparations.’

William found it ironic that he was wishing for the person that had started this whole mess, to succeed in whatever preparations he was working on.

Still, the Half-Elf knew that, even if he gave it his all, he alone would not be able to win this war. He needed Conner and his schemes.

“Everyone, rest for now,” William said with a smile. “Tomorrow is a new day, and a new set of challenges awaits us all.”

He then looked at Erchitu who was standing in front of the members of the Minotaur Race. William didn’t tell him about his plan of trying to enter the Gate of Beginnings. He didn’t want to raise the Giant White Ox’s expectations.

‘I just hope that my hunch is correct.’ William clenched his fist in anticipation. ‘King Minos… I pray that I will get the chance to talk to you tomorrow.’
