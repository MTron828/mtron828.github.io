Chapter 472: I Need No Introductions [Part 2]

“Hold it right there, you damned Brat!” Eneru roared as he streaked through the skies like a lightning bolt.

William sneered at the Qilin who was rapidly approaching his location.

“It’s not only you who can travel at the speed of lightning,” William stated as his entire body exploded in a shower of sparks.

He flew towards the East, and Eneru followed at his heels like a rabid dog out for blood.

While this was happening, the other Teleportation Gates in different cities were being crushed under the massive weight of Ruyi Jingu Bang.

William knew that he was on borrowed time. Every minute that passed was a step closer to losing the power of his Heroic Avatar. He intended to squeeze every second out of it in order to destroy as many Teleportation Gates as he could before making his escape from the Zelan Dynasty.

He didn’t bother to engage the Elven Defenders who had been woken up in the middle of the night by his antics. Everytime he destroyed a Teleportation Gate, he would immediately fly towards the next location.

The William that Eneru had encountered was one of his clones, and the latter immediately lured the Qilin away from William, and the other clones, to prevent the Guardian Beast from getting in the way of their mission. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

William was about to destroy another Teleportation Gate when a giant fist made of Earth blocked his way.

The Half-Elf immediately somersaulted upwards to evade the attack from the Ancient Golem, Drauum.

William softly landed on top of a white cloud as he stared down at the two-meter tall golem that was looking up at him with a cold gaze.

“Hi.” William sneered. “Bye!”

William subtly pointed his staff at a direction and silently activated his Quick Shot Fusion War Art. However, at that moment, the Earth rose up to enclose him in a dome. The Half-Elf immediately pointed his staff upwards and disappeared from his location.

Drauum frowned because it couldn’t sense anything in the Earth Prison that it had created to entrap William. Still, it didn’t disperse the spell right away. Instead, it made the prison shrink until it was only two meters big.

It then used its powerful detection abilities to see if the Half-Elf was only using a trick to hide his presence. After making sure that the red-headed boy had really not been captured by its Earth Prison, Drauum smashed the Earth Dome into bits.

‘That was close,’ William thought as he stood on top of a cloud.

He was currently above the dark-gray clouds that covered the continent in darkness. The Two Moons of Hestia, and the stars in the sky illuminated his image as he pointed his staff towards the nearest teleportation gate.

Now that Eneru and Drauum had arrived at the scene, his unrestricted rampage was nearing its end.

‘I’ll destroy one more before I leave,’ William thought as he once again merged with his weapon and streaked across the lands of the Zelan Dynasty.

“Bastard!” Eneru roared when he realized that the Half-Elf that he just killed was only a clone.

He once again took off towards the sky as he used its powerful senses to find the location of his target.

‘There!’ Eneru transformed into a lightning bolt as he headed towards the giant golden pillar that descended from the sky. Although he knew that it might be another clone, he still decided to go. As long as the possibility existed, Eneru was unwilling to let William go.

As someone that had ascended his rank, Eneru had developed an uncanny foresight. His instinct was screaming at him that the boy must be killed at all cost, or he would forever be suppressed under William’s heel.

This was something that he couldn’t accept. His hatred for William had already exceeded Elandorr’s. Eneru had long vowed that he wouldn’t leave the Southern Continent until William’s threat had been dealt with.

-

One by one, William’s clones were destroyed by Eneru and Drauum. The Blademasters and Archmages of the Elven Army had all mobilized to defend the various teleportation Gates that remained.

A loud rumbling sound resounded in the plaza as William destroyed another Teleportation Gate. All of the Elven Defenders that had stood in his way had already been dealt with, staining the ground with their blood.

Suddenly, a magical dome enveloped the entire city. William immediately felt a powerful pressure press down on him. However, the inherent strength of the Monkey King allowed him to brush this pressure off like rain falling down on his head.

“Impressive,” Ezkalor said with genuine appreciation. “So young and already this powerful?”

The Elder Dragon’s eyes narrowed as he appraised the Half-Elf in front of him. He was liking the boy more and more. It was as if the blood of the Elves that dyed the ground was mere water that was not worth his attention.

Ezkalor’s eyes were only focused on the boy in front of him. He had Arwen’s eyes and Maxwell’s red hair.

It was at this moment when Eneru, Drauum, and several Elves arrived at the city, encircling William. The Elder Dragon gave them all a brief nod, before shifting his attention back to the teenageer in front of him.

“Elandorr is right,” Ezkalor nodded his head in understanding. “You are using some kind of ability that temporarily boosts your strength. However, this ability of yours is about to end. Child, I already know your name, but can you formally introduce yourself to me?”

Eneru and Drauum moved closer, and the rest of the Elves used their magic powers to reinforce the Magic Barrier that had enclosed the entire city. They were not going to let William go no matter what.

“I need no introductions,” William replied calmly. “You already know who I am.”

Ezkalor smirked, “Child. You are without a doubt the most disrespectful Half-Elf I have ever heard of.”

William returned the Elder Dragon’s smirk with a smirk of his own. “But you have heard of me.”

Ezkalor’s smile widened when he heard William’s snarky reply. Even though the Half-Elf had been surrounded and had no place to escape, the latter was still calm and even seemed to be enjoying everyone’s attention.

William scanned the faces of the Elves, as well as Eneru and Drauum who were only standing a few meters away from him. Eneru had a sinister smile on his face, and William didn’t need to be a genius to understand what was going on in the Qilin’s head.

“I will make sure that you remember this day, until your dying breath, Half Elf,” Eneru said in a teasing manner that wouldn’t lose to any pompous university student that still hadn’t had the opportunity to meet Truck-kun in real life.

“Indeed.” William nodded. “This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught William Von Ainsworth.”

William gave Eneru the middle finger before vanishing from where he stood.

Everyone on the scene froze before going into an uproar.

Eneru stepped forward and waved his hand on the spot where William disappeared. He had thought that the Half-Elf was already in the bag and had no place to go.

Drauum showed a rare expression of irritation on its face as it extended its senses hundreds of miles away from where he stood. As a Pseudo-Demigod that could use the power of the Earth, it was able to detect any traces of William as long as he stood on the ground.

Ezkalor chuckled after realizing that the Half-Elf had indeed escaped from their encirclement. What was more incredible was that he did it in the presence of three of the Guardians of the Silvermoon Continent.

“What an interesting child,” Ezkalor said. He then gave the fuming Qilin a side-long glance before turning around to leave.

The City had been under his spell, so he was sure that the boy was no longer around. Even if William was there, he would pretend that the boy had escaped. He owed Maxwell a favor and was willing to turn a blind eye to his son’s mischief just this once.

He just hoped that when the Elves came knocking on the Hellan Capital’s Walls, the Half-Elf would surrender peacefully. That way, he would be able to take him into his custody and guarantee his life.

Away from the jaws of the Prideful Qilin, who was currently roaring at the sky to vent out his anger.
