Chapter 243: William's Undercover Plan

William was surprised at the sudden change in the little girl in front of him. He didn’t know if he should speak honestly or wait for Sir Jerkins to personally talk with the girl’s grandfather about the proposed Alliance between their Tribes and the Hellan Kingdom.

However, after some thought, he decided to trust his instincts and answer the girl’s question.

“Yes. That is the purpose of our visit,” William replied after careful consideration. From what he could tell, the girl didn’t just visit them to ask about her ‘Fiance’s’ well-being. Her sharp and intelligent eyes reminded William of his Grandpa’s eyes when the old man was scheming something behind his grandson’s back.

Brianna didn’t give him any malicious vibes, and Ella, who lay not far away from them, had also given her silent approval. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Listen very closely.” Brianna lowered her voice as if afraid that someone might overhear their discussion. “Aside from your group, there are two other parties. They arrived here on the Third Peak two days ago. I’m afraid that your proposal for an Alliance will not go smoothly.”

Brianna was about to say more, but was interrupted by a knock on the door. She hurriedly changed her expression to that of an innocent and naive little girl who could be easily tricked by other people to follow them in their own homes.

“They say that in the Hellan Kingdom, there are many beautiful clothes and jewelry, is that true?” Brianna asked just in time for the door to open wide.

“Brianna, you shouldn’t disturb our guests,” Liam, Brianna’s father, appeared in the room with a stern expression. “Didn’t I tell you to not wander around during this time?”

Liam then faced William and the two girls beside him before giving a brief bow. “I apologize for my daughter’s transgressions. She’s quite ignorant of the world and will often do something mischievous. I hope that she didn’t disturb or offend you in any way.”

“Father, I’m only asking them about fashionable clothes like the one that the Green-Haired Big Sister is wearing.” Brianna pouted. “Big Brother, I’m not disturbing your rest, right?”

“Of course not,” William replied. For now, he decided to play along and save the little loli from getting spanked by her father. “Lady Brianna is a very kind and respectful young lady. Even in the capital, there are few girls who have her charm and elegance.”

“See? Big Brother praised me. I’m a good girl and I’m not doing anything bad.” Brianna looked at her father with a face filled with injustice.

Liam’s gaze finally softened as he gently brushed her head. “Let’s go back. Your mother just finished baking cookies.”

“Yay! Cookies!” Brianna ran out of the room in high spirits.

Liam watched her retreating back with a helpless smile on his face. He then faced William and the two girls and gave a respectful bow before leaving the room, closing the door behind him.

Before the two girls could even say anything, William hurriedly covered their lips with his hand and said in a loud voice.

“We’ve been traveling for three days straight and I haven’t had the chance to make love to the two of you,” William said in a tone that was laced with perversion. “Why don’t the three of us do some catching up before dinner? I’m sure that the Great Chief will not mind us being a little late.”

The Half-Elf signaled the two girls with his eyes as he half-dragged them to the bed.

Wendy’s and Amelia’s faces had already reddened because even if they knew that William was just acting, both of them were still chaste maidens who had only heard a thing or two about what couples do in the bedroom.

William gently pushed the two girls onto the bed and lay between them. He then pulled them closer to him as he said words of love into their ears.

“There are three people listening to our conversation,” William whispered to Amelia’s ear. “One is hiding behind the painting on the wall, the other behind the door and the third is right outside our window.”

The Half-Elf kissed Wendy’s forehead before whispering the same things he said to Amelia to her ears.

The two girls then played their roles and acted intimate with William.

Amelia played with William’s ears, while Wendy rubbed his chest. William, on the other hand, laughed in a very lecherous manner that irritated the three men listening to their conversations.

In the end, the three left them alone when they realized that William was hell bent on playing with the two pretty girls beside him.

When the “eavesdroppers” had disappeared, William nodded to the two girls which signaled that the pests had left.

“Do you think they also sent people to monitor the others?” Amelia whispered in William’s ears.

Although the Half-Elf said that they were no longer being monitored, she still felt that it was better to play it safe rather than be sorry later.

“Definitely,” William answered without any shred of doubt. “I just hope that the others have noticed them too and made proper arrangements.”

“Do you think they will continue to monitor us?” Wendy inquired. “Will they do something to us during our stay like put something on our food and water?”

William shook his head to deny Wendy’s words. “They are not allowed to treat us like that. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that others won’t. Remember what Brianna said? Aside from us, there were two other parties that have arrived before us. I’m guessing that whoever they might be, they are not on good terms with the Hellan Kingdom.”

‘It’s quite unfortunate that I wasn’t able to bring Aethon with me,’ William thought with regret.

The little Wren was left inside the academy in order to observe anything suspicious that was happening inside it. With its knack for looking for news like a journalist, William was confident that it would have something to report once he returned to the academy.

As much as he wanted to gather information about the “unknown parties” he couldn’t do anything that might arouse suspicion from the warriors that were patrolling the Third Peak of Chivalry.

The Chief’s attendant had explicitly told them to not leave their quarters unless it was something very important. From that alone, William could tell that the Chief was hiding something from them. However, he was powerless to do anything at this point in time aside from sighing in regret.

It was at that moment when his gaze landed on Ella who was resting on the floor beside the bed.

“That’s it!” William sat up from the bed in excitement. He then hurriedly talked to Ella using telepathy which was a special ability that William could use when talking to the “Leader” of his herd.

Ella nodded her head in agreement to her son’s suggestion. Since William couldn’t leave the room then it would be up to her to gather information.

As an Angorian War Ibex, no one in the Kyrintor Mountains would dare block her passage. Even the Great Chief would have to give her face and allow her to wander around the Third Peak as she did her investigation.

William hoped that when Ella returned, some of the questions he had in his mind would finally find their answers.
