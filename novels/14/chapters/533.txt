Jason Hal Kraetor

Merit Points: 621,489

A loud cheering broke out in the crowd when they saw Prince Jason’s name appear on top of the monument. Anyone who was able to break the record of the academy was like an idol in their hearts.

This was the goal that everyone in Silverwind Academy strived for. They wanted their names to be at the very top of the monument, to be stared at by the future elites of the empire.

The Fifth Prince of the Kraetor Empire faced the crowd and gave them a princely bow that was overflowing with charisma.

Princess Vanessa’s face reddened when she saw her beloved’s name on top of the monument. She glanced at the handsome Prince, and hurriedly covered the lower half of her face with a fan, to prevent anyone from seeing the sweet smile on her face.

Prince Maximilian didn’t look at his cousin’s smug expression as his gaze remained fixated on the name on top of the monument.

‘Fool,’ Prince Maximilian sneered internally.

As the first Prince of the Kraetor Empire, he was privy to confidential information that was not readily accessible to the public. Since that was the case, he already knew that his record had been broken.

However, it was not only broken by one person.

It was broken by two people.

The Giant Black Monument showed things in its proper order. Since Prince Jason had broken his record first then his cousin’s name would appear on the monument, albeit fleetingly. What Prince Maximilian was waiting for was the moment when his arrogant cousin’s happiness would come crumbling down.

After paying the students his good graces, Prince Jason noticed that the First Prince of the Kraetor Empire was still staring at his name on top of the monument.

A sense of superiority bloomed inside his chest as he walked towards the First Prince who had always stood ahead of him for the past few years.

“Cousin, I got lucky this time,” Prince Jason said with a smile. “I hope you don’t mind.”

“I don’t mind,” Prince Maximilian said. “You did well by breaking my record.”

“This is the right attitude that a Prince should have. Cousin, let’s go to the Whispering Wind Tavern later. Drinks are on me.”

“I will take you up on that offer, Cousin. Make sure that you don’t keep me waiting.”

“But of course.”

Prince Jason chuckled as he sneered at the First Prince internally.

‘You sure know how to put on an act,’ Prince Jason ridiculed Prince Maximilian in his heart. ‘Let’s see how long you can keep up that facade of yours, dear Cousin of mine.’

What Prince Jason didn’t know was that The First Prince of the Kraetor Empire was already laughing internally. Prince Maximilian had already noticed that his cousin’s name was starting to fade from the top of the monument.

Since he was the only one looking at the monument at the moment, no one had seen the changes that were happening. The oldest Prince waited for a few more seconds before shifting his gaze at Prince Jason who had a smug expression on his face.

“Dear Cousin, it’s quite unfortunate that your happiness is short lived,” Prince Maximilian chuckled as he pointed his finger at the top of the monument. “Your name is no longer written there.”

Prince Jason sneered at his cousin before looking up at the monument. He thought that the First Prince was just saying nonsense in order to divert his attention away from him. However, the moment Prince Jason’s eyes laid on the name that was written on top of the monument, his body stiffened and the sneer on his face disappeared completely.

“W-What?!” one of Prince Jason’s lackeys gasped in shock. “O-Over Six Million Merit Points?!”

It was not only Prince Jason’s lackeys that had been shocked, but everyone in the plaza. They thought that they were only seeing things, but after rubbing their eyes repeatedly they had come to the conclusion that what they were seeing was real!

“Impossible! How could such a high merit exist?!”

“Prince Jason’s was only over Six Hundred Thousand. This new record is nearly Seven Million! How could this be possible?!”

“Wait, I know that name. Isn’t that the name of the Fiance of Princess Sidonie?”

“Now that you mention it, you are right! It’s that guy that has been tossed to Class F!”

“T-This is truly unexpected. To think that one can gain this many merit points during the Assessment Test is a first.”

Everyone was in uproar and William’s name was spoken here and there.

Prince Maximilian had a devilish smile on his face as he patted his cousin’s shoulder, who seemed to have lost the color in his face.

“I’ll be waiting for you at the Whispering Wind Tavern Later,” Prince Maximilian said. “Don’t keep me waiting, Cousin.”

Prince Maximilian chuckled as he walked away from the Giant Monument to return to his residences. The expression on his cousin’s face was priceless, and he had succeeded in secretly recording it in a crystal because Prince Jason wasn’t able to recover from the shock right away.

‘I think I will meet with this boy named William,’ Prince Maximilian thought. ‘Someone as extraordinary as him will definitely be a good addition to our Empire. I heard that he is Princess Sidonie’s Fiance. That girl sure knows how to pick good men.’

The First Prince of the Kraetor Empire was in such a good mood, that he didn’t notice that he was humming as he walked back towards his residence in the academy.

Meanwhile, while everyone was in an uproar, a certain Shepherd had just left the bathroom alongside a beautiful lady with light-blue hair.

“The results of the Assessment Test should have been posted by now,” Ashe said as she dried her hair with a bath towel. “Are you sure you don’t want to go there?”

She was currently seated on the bed, and looking at the boy who was rummaging for clothes inside the closet.

“I’ll look later,” William said as he helped his lover wear her clothes. “The test results won’t be going anywhere. Besides, I’d rather look at you than that Giant Black Monument. What’s so good about it? Can those results be eaten?”

Ashe lovingly pinched William’s ears because of his flattering words. The Half-Elf suddenly grinned mischievously as he counter attacked and pinched Ashe’s…

“You’re hopeless,” Ashe replied as she grabbed the naughty hand that had repeatedly brought her to the peak of pleasure a few minutes ago. “Be serious, Sidonie and Chiffon are already waiting for us.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

William kissed her lips before putting on his own clothes. Today was also a rest day for the students, so they planned to go to the Whispering Wind Tavern to celebrate.

The Half-Elf had gone there once when he was exploring the city in search of its popular attractions.

The Whispering Wind Tavern was a place that was exclusive for the nobles of the Kraetor Empire. No commoner could enter the place. Technically, William, Ian, and Chiffon wouldn’t be able to enter.

Fortunately, Princess Sidonie was well-known in the Academy and in Silverwind City. it would be easy for them to enter the tavern since they were going to act as the Princess’ entourage.

Also, William, Ashe, and Princess Sidonie, wanted to let Chiffon experience something that she had never experienced before. The Half-Elf had asked the little girl if she had drunk in a tavern before, and the latter firmly shook her head.

When WIlliam asked if she wanted to try going to one, Chiffon nodded her head like a hen pecking rice. The pink-haired girl was Half Dwarven, but she had never had the chance to drink wine in the past.

According to the information that William had gained from the System, Dwarves had a high alcohol tolerance. As for Ashe, William already knew what state she would be in after drinking a few glasses of wine.

The Half-Elf was half tempted to let his mermaid lover drink to her heart’s content. That way, he would once again experience that aggressive mermaid that once tore off his clothes in her drunken state.

None of them were aware of the commotion that was currently happening in the Plaza of the Academy as William’s fame shot up to the roof.
