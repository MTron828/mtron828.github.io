Chapter 386: Meeting With The Diabolical Hell Ape [Part 2]

William stood in front of the Diabolical Hell Ape, and his gaze never left the Millennial Beast’s eyes. In the past, the Ape had used its overwhelming pressure to knock him unconscious with a single stare.

Now, that same powerful stare was aimed at his body once more. Although the pressure was the same as he remembered, he was not the same boy that had met this Beast for the first time. He had undergone many battles in the time that he had spent at the academy and it had further strengthened his ability to hold his ground against strong opponents.

“Good,” the Diabolical Hell Ape said via telepathy. “Your eyes have more strength in them now compared to the first time we met. Now, tell me, child, why have you come to meet me?”

William knew that if the Diabolical Hell Ape wanted to harm him, he would definitely not be its match. He had a feeling that even Erchitu, the Giant White Ox that was now part of his herd, would not be strong enough to face off against the Sovereign of the Forest.

Unlike Erchitu and the other powerful beasts in the continent, the Diabolical Hell Ape wasn’t affected by the spell. It was born from a place where miasma was everywhere, its body had long surpassed the limits of ordinary creatures, making it almost immune to debuff spells that would weaken it.

“I am here to ask for help,” William replied after organizing his thoughts. He knew that he needed to pick his words wisely in order to command this mighty beast to lend its aid. “I am about to fight against the Organization that was responsible for casting the Continental Spell[, which has turned all the adults in the continent into statues. If possible, I would like to ask for His Excellency’s help in dealing with them.”

The Diabolical Hell Ape nodded in understanding. “That spell was truly powerful. I have never seen a spell of such magnitude in my lifetime. However, this is an affair between Humans. I don’t see any reason for us to fight. Also, what can you offer us so that we will accept your proposal?”

William was expecting that the negotiation would head in this direction. Although he had a few treasures in his possession, he wasn’t sure that the Sovereign of the Forest would be interested in them. Because of this, he decided to take a gamble.

“Is there something that His Excellency wants in return?” William inquired.

He knew that, as a being that had already reached the Millennial Rank, there were very few things that could pique its curiosity.

“Oh? So you’re asking me what I like? Now, this is something I didn’t see coming.” The Diabolical Hell Ape smiled a devilish smile that matched its sinister profile. “I thought that you were going to present me with priceless treasures and allow me to choose from them.”

“Although I do have those treasures, it will be best if I just give His Excellency what he truly wants. That way, I will be able to secure your help wholeheartedly.”

“Smart. But, the question is, are you capable of giving me what I want?”

“What is it that you desire, Your Excellency?”

The Diabolical Hell Ape looked down at William with a serious expression as he pondered the thing that he really wanted to possess. A few minutes passed in silence, but no one within the clearing said anything.

William, Ian, and the rest of the creatures in the Forest[,] waited for the Giant Ape to state what he wanted. Finally, the Sovereign of the Forest stated his demand. William’s expression became serious, but he was not alone.

Ian, Psoglav, and the rest of the rulers of the forest looked at the Giant Ape in shock when they heard his wish.

“I want to become Human.”

Five simple words. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yet, those five words relayed how serious the Diabolical Hell Ape was.

William didn’t dare to ask the Millennial Beast to repeat what it just said because he knew that the answer would be the same. If anyone who didn’t know the temper of the Diabolical Hell Ape were to hear this request, they would definitely laugh out loud.

Why? Because it was a ridiculous request. A request that seemed impossible.

But no one within the clearing dared to laugh. Because they know that the Millennial Beast would end their life the moment they did something disrespectful to it.

After a few minutes of silence, William took a deep breath and asked the Giant Ape a question.

“Your Excellency, I just want to confirm something,” William said as he stared at the Sovereign of the Forest with a serious expression. “Do you just want to be able to take Human form, or do you really want to become a Human?”

The Diabolical Hell Ape replied firmly and without room for negotiations. “A true Human. However, I still want to retain the power I currently have. If you can make it happen, I will put my life on the line to aid you in your request.”

“Your Excellency, may I ask why you want to become Human?”

“You don’t need to know.”

The Diabolical Hell’s Ape carried a tone of finality. William knew that asking for more might jeopardize his chances of being able to ask it for help. Now that the Millennial Beast had stated its terms, it was now time for him to find a way to make it a reality.

‘System, is there a way to do this?’

[ Host, If we use the God Shop, we can definitely do it. However, the cost will be not lower than 100,000 God Points, which we currently don’t have right now. ]

William sighed internally. He had just been given a loan of a Million God Points by the Gods in the Temple. His face was not thick enough to ask for more.

“Your Excellency, I cannot grant your request,” William replied honestly.

The expression of the Diabolical Hell Ape remained calm. It didn’t expect that William would be able to grant his request. If it was easy, he would have already turned into a Human long ago.

“Then we have nothing more to talk about,” the Diabolical Hell Ape stated. “When you find a way to turn me into a Human, you will know where to find me. Until then, you will be barred from returning to this forest.”

The Giant Ape was about to leave when a thought crossed its mind. “If any of the rulers of the forest, aside from Psoglav, want to accompany you then I will allow it. However, once they decide to join you, they will no longer be welcome in my domain.”

The Beasts in the forest looked at their Sovereign, and the Giant Ape only gave them a light snort before walking away. It had already said everything it wanted to say. Whether the Rulers of the Forests wanted to join William or not, he had already given them his explicit permission, in exchange for being expelled from his Domain forever.

The Rulers of the Forest, who planned to discuss terms with William, hesitated because of their Sovereign’s ultimatum. Frankly, they were fine with the current lifestyle they had. They were just jealous of Psoglav’s increase in strength and ranking due to the resources that were given to him by the red-headed boy.

They all had a difficult choice to make now.

Should they join William and take a gamble?

Or should they stay where it was safe and where they could live their lives without having to fight against strong opponents?

The Beasts were all pondering the answers to these questions while the Half-Elf stood in place. Only Psoglav was grinning ear to ear. Naturally, he already knew the answer to these questions, but he had no intention of saying anything.

For him, the less competition he had, the more rewards he would gain by staying by William’s side. As the boy’s first Demonic Business Partner, Psoglav had no intention of sharing his resources with anyone!

It hoped that his comrades in the forest would all back down. That way, he would be able to cross into the Centennial Rank in the not so distant future. After all, he was not like the other rulers in the forest.

He didn’t want to stay in a small place for the rest of his life. Psoglav also wanted to travel the world. It was a Demonic Beast that had a thirst for conquest. Although it liked to play it safe and stay away from dangerous situations, it didn’t mean that it was a coward.

It was only waiting for the right moment, to open its razor sharp fangs, and go in… for the Kill!
