Ashe panted after she dealt the final blow on the Giant Blue Slime that served as the Boss on the Fifth Floor of the Dungeon of Atlantis.

William and Wendy stood at the side and watched the battle without supporting her because it was what the mermaid warrior wanted.

After receiving the Fighter Subclass, Ashe’s techniques in wielding her Whip Sword had been refined further, which allowed her to fight against the Giant Slime with ease.

William and his group didn’t expect that the bosses for the Atlantis Dungeon would start on the fifth floor instead of the tenth floor, which was quite common among normal dungeons. This made William and the System realize the vast difference between a lower ranked dungeon and a dungeon that had been given the SSR Rating.

‘System, switch Ashe’s Job Class to Earth Mage,’ William ordered.

‘Thank you.’

William walked towards Ashe and congratulated her for her victory. Wendy did the same and the three exchanged high fives with each other.

“Ashe, I have something to tell you,” William said with a mischievous smile on his face.

“I don’t like that look on our face,” Ashe replied. “Out with it. What are you planning to do?”

“Well, how do you feel about learning Earth Magic?”

“Earth Magic? Are you referring to the magic that my twin sister can wield?”

William nodded his head. He had already told the two girls that he had the ability to bestow upon them new powers that they could use to further increase their strength. At first, Ashe and Wendy were doubtful of William’s declaration, but soon, they understood that he was not joking with them.

William had bestowed the Fighter Job Class to Ashe. His goal was to unlock the Job Class Geomancer, which required both the Earth Mage and the Fighter Job Class at their Max levels.

The Geomancer was a unique class because it specialized in magic-based attack. However, there was a trick in using this Job Class. Its attack would depend on the kind of terrain the user was in.

For example, if Ashe were to fight on land, or any ordinary terrain she would be able to wield Earth Magic. If she was fighting in a swamp, she would be able to use Water Magic.

William was quite curious about what would happen if Ashe were to fight inside a forest. Perhaps she would be able to cast Wood Magic that would devastate her enemies in the Wood-favorable terrain.

“Just, how are you able to do this?” Ashe asked. “I never heard of this kind of power before.”

William flipped his hair and gave his mermaid lover a dashing smile. “Now you know how strong I am. You are quite fortunate that you chose this handsome Half-Elf as your lover.”

Ashe and Wendy snorted at the same time. They really loved William, but whenever the red-headed boy started to brag and act arrogant, they got the urge to beat the crap out of him.

Seeing that the two girls were itching to give him a good beating, William raised his hands in surrender.

“Still, wouldn’t it be interesting?” Wendy commented from the side. “If Isaac were to see you wield Earth Magic, I’m sure her jaw will drop in shock and disbelief.”

A smile appeared on Ashe’s lips because she could already picture her twin’s reaction. Wendy was right, she was also secretly looking forward to Isaac’s reaction once she saw her Earth Magic.

William chuckled before casually wrapping his arm around Wendy’s waist and pulling the blonde beauty close to him.

“How about you, Wendy?” William asked. “Is the Rune Mage to your liking?”

Wendy nodded her head and looked up at William with starry eyes. “The Runemage is a very interesting job. I love it!”

“I’m glad that you feel that way,” William kissed Wendy’s cheek before looking at her current stats

Wendy was a magician with Dual Affinities. She specialized in Metal and Wind Magic, but since her proficiency in Wind Magic wasn’t as strong as her Metal Magic, she focused on this more while growing up.

However, after clearing the Trial of Enlightenment, her Wind Magic had become stronger and became as powerful as her Metal Magic. Because of this, Wendy was able to fight while wielding two powers simultaneously.

This was also why William decided to let her play around with the Rune Mage Job Class. Just as the name suggested, this Mage Type Job Class’ main focus was creating runes.

At first, Wendy felt intimidated because she had to memorize four different runes and learn how to write them in order to activate its powers.

Fortunately, Wendy’s aptitude to learn and dual wield was the real deal so the Rune Mage Job Class easily became her favorite. By combining two or more runes, Wendy was able to cast magic that boosted her overall fighting prowess.

One of her favorite runic spells was the Runic Blades. It allowed her to materialize Four Longswords that dealt Ethereal Damage. These Runic Blades ignored the enemy’s defense and were lethal against those wearing heavy armor.

Once the blade cut through their body, it would drastically weaken their strength, and slow their reaction time, allowing Wendy to deal the final blow with ease.

She also liked the rune traps that she could place on the ground undetected since they would automatically explode once a target stepped within its range. This was also a trump card that Wendy could use when fighting against multiple enemies and controlling the flow of battle at the same time.

William’s goal was for her to unlock the RuneMaster Job Class which required a combination of the Rune Mage and the Fighter Job Class at their Max levels.

He believed that with this additional ace under Wendy’s sleeve, she would be able to protect herself in the midst of battle.

William understood that he couldn’t always be with them when they fought on the battlefield. The only thing he could do was to increase their proficiency in wielding their new powers to allow them more leeway during tough situations.

“Let’s check the sixth floor,” William said as she pulled Ashe close to him and gave her a kiss as well. “I think we will be facing a different type of monster next.”

The two ladies beside him nodded their heads in agreement. However, before they could even step onto the next floor, the System sent a notification to William, telling him that Est, Dave, Conrad, and Isaac had finally arrived in the Kyrintor Mountains.

“Let’s postpone our dungeon expedition,” William stated. “Est has arrived. Let’s go meet her.”

Lionheart screeched before descending towards the Third Peak of Chivalry. The survivors of the Tribes, who hadn’t seen a Gryphon before, looked at Lionheart with curiosity and admiration. However, when they saw the Wyvern that was hovering right next to it, all of them cried out in shock and unsheathed their weapons.

Although they hadn’t seen a Gryphon before, they were quite familiar with Wyverns. There were Snow Wyverns that lived near the Kyrintor Mountains and they would sometimes conduct raids in order to capture the livestock s that they reared in their Tribes.

Sometimes, the Wyverns would also take some of the Tribe members during their raids to serve as their food once they got back to their nests.

Takam had turned a blind-eye in these raids because it was also a way for him to prevent the Northern Tribes from being overly complacent about his protection. The Demigod had declared that he would only aid them during an invasion. However, when it came to monster raids, he ordered them to fend for themselves.

This was why the warriors of the tribes had remained strong throughout the years, and had become a force that the Hellan Kingdom didn’t want to deal with.

William walked towards the flying carriage along with Wendy. Ian had already transformed herself into a boy and went to greet her Young Master and twin sister.

Although she liked to stay by William’s side, that didn’t change the fact that she was Est’s retainer along with Isaac. It was her duty to protect Est at all times.

“Welcome to the Kyrintor Mountains, Young Master,” Ian greeted as he held Est’s hand to help her disembark from the flying carriage.

“It’s good to see you again, Ian,” Est replied with a smile. He then lowered his head to whisper something in Ian’s ear.

“Is he cheating on us?” Est asked.

“No,” Ian replied. “He’s been busy gathering allies ever since we left the capital. Wendy and I are making sure that he doesn’t do anything funny.”

The corner of William’s lips twitched when he heard the two whispering boys, who were only a few meters away from him. Although they were whispering to each other, William’s strong hearing was able to pick up their conversation.

William felt that Est’s arrival would break the status quo and cause complications in their bedroom arrangements during the latter’s stay in the Third Peak of Chivalry.
