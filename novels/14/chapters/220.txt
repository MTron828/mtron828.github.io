Chapter 220: He Who Dwells In The Marshes

A mile away from the hometown of Amelia, the Titanic Green-Scaled Trollhound was slowly reforming its body.

Currently, the only thing that it had regenerated was its head and neck area. Its muscle tissues pulsated like the beating of a heart as it continued to reconstruct its missing body parts. If someone were to see this scene, they would think that it would perfectly fit the setting of a horror film.

“So there you are,” William said as he approached the two-meter long head while riding on Ella’s back.

Behind him were over five-hundred Trolhounds that looked like little puppies that had lost their Master. These were the ones that didn’t run away after the battle ended. The majority of the hounds scattered after their leader was obliterated in the skies of the barony. William didn’t bar their way because it was too much of a hassle.

Instead, he used his authority as the Shepherd to make the remaining Trollhounds obey his orders. Due to the shock they had received and the fact that all of them were Class E Beasts, they didn’t have the strength, nor willpower, to disobey William’s orders.

“Can you talk?” William asked.

The Titanic Trollhound snorted and closed its eyes. The one who created it was a Human, so it hated Humans to the core. Although William was a Half-Elf, the Titanic Trollhound was not interested in talking to him.

William scratched his head because he could tell that this Beast was one tough cookie. If possible, he wanted to add it to his Herd because it was the strongest creature that he could tame with his current strength.

“How about we make a deal,” William said with a serious expression. “You tell me what you want most in the world. If I can grant it, you will join my herd. How about it?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The Titanic Trollhound remained indifferent to William’s proposal. The red-headed boy talked to it for half an hour, but the creature didn’t even bother to give him a glance. William tried to entice it with different benefits, and also told it countless reasons why it should join his herd, but the Boss of the Trollhounds was resolute in ignoring him.

Left with no choice, William turned his attention to the hundreds of Trollhounds that had survived the battle behind him.

“Who among you wants to follow me?” William asked. “I promise that those who follow me will never go hungry again. You will have food to eat everyday and have the opportunity to grow stronger. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, those who want to become part of my herd, step forward!”

At first there was no movement, but among the hundreds of trollhounds, a single Trollhound walked towards William.

This particular Trollhound was so skinny, that it was almost bonelike. Clearly, it was suffering from malnutrition and was on its last legs in life. Although Trollhounds had powerful regeneration abilities, they were creatures that still needed to eat.

They could still die if their bodies didn’t receive any nutrients. Once a Trollhound died, its corpse would be eaten by its fellow hounds until not even a single bone was left. Such was the life of Trollhounds who lived in a group.

The Trollhound made a low growl laced with extreme hunger. William didn’t know if what he heard was the beast’s growl or the growl of its stomach. In any case, one thing was clear, it was starving and asking William if what he said earlier was true.

William waved his hand and the Trollhound was automatically added to the members of his herd. He then tossed a huge chunk of meat that was taken from the body of the Werehyenas that were killed in the Whimsical Forest, to the Trollhound.

Seeing the piece of meat in front of it, the Trollhound hungrily devoured it to sate its hunger. Its companions started to salivate and even thought of snatching the meat from the skinny hound. Some of them had even stepped forward to do just that, but a glare from William froze them in their tracks.

“Only those that join my herd will be eligible to eat the food I provide,” William grinned evilly. “How about it? Just say yes and you’ll be able to eat your fill. All of your lives will be easier.”

The Trollhounds were starting to waver. Their gazes shifted from the chunk of meat that their comrade was eating back to William. The red-headed boy knew that he was so close to luring the Trollhounds into becoming his subordinates, unfortunately, the Titanic Trollhound behind him chose this time to ruin his parade.

‘All Humans can’t be trusted!’ the Titanic Trollhound said via telepathy. ‘They will only use you as experimental subjects and throw you away once your usefulness is over!’

“Correction, I’m not Human,” William scoffed. “I’m a Half-Elf.”

‘You still can’t be trusted!’ The Titanic Trollhound glared in anger. ‘You have the same expression as those greedy sorcerers who only think about themselves!’

William turned his back on the Titanic Trollhound because it was useless to talk to it. It was filled with hate towards Humans that it was impossible to tame it even if he wanted to. Since that was the case, he would just poach its subordinates right under its nose!

The shepherd chuckled internally as he tossed more chunks of meat on the ground. He didn’t believe that the hungry hounds would be able to resist the temptation that he was offering them.

Soon, a small mound of meat laid in front of the Trollhounds that made their eyes become bloodshot. Their instincts for survival were leaning towards William even though the Titanic Trollhound still had its hold over them.

“I’ll be honest. I intend to turn everyone who chooses to join me into my own private force,” William said as he crossed his arms over his chest. “I will ask you to fight for me when I am faced with difficulty. Some of you may die in the process, but I don’t see any difference between my offer and your current situation.

“If you are planning to invade Human territories, you are bound to face strong warriors. You already saw what I am capable of doing and, sorry to say that there are humans far stronger than me.”

William’s words made the Trollhounds shudder. William was the strongest person they had seen so far, and he was saying that there were Humans far stronger than him. If that was the truth then wouldn’t that mean that they were just courting death?

The Trollhounds glanced at each other. Soon, more of them stepped forward and joined the skinny hound in eating the mound of meat that was in front of them. They had completely submitted to William and the latter didn’t even have to add them to his herd because he knew that these hounds were now loyal to him.

The Titanic Trollhound glared at the weaklings that were enticed by a few pieces of meat. Deep down, it disdained the Trollhounds that rebelled and cursed them.

‘All of you will regret this day,’ the Titanic Trollhound growled. ‘Don’t come running back to me when you see his true colors!’

William turned his head to look at the Beast that was looking at him in disdain. “Don’t worry. They will not regret their decision.”

Out of the hundreds of Trollhounds, only seventy decided to join William’s side. Although it was far smaller than his initial estimate, he was still happy with the result.

‘System, can you now modify the Ring of Conquest to perform the task I wanted?’

[ The Host will need to pay 3,000 God Points for the modification of the Ring of Conquest. ]

[ Do you want to proceed? Y / N ]

‘I choose yes,’ William replied.

Although his precious God Points would be consumed in the process, it was a necessary investment in order to achieve his goal.

William dismounted Ella and faced the first trollhound that had taken the initiative to join his party.

“Come here,” William said softly.

The skinny Trollhound walked towards him. When it was only two meters away from William, it knelt on the ground to show its servitude.

William summoned Rhongomyniad and rested it on the Trollhound’s head. He didn’t know if it would have any effect on beasts, but he decided to still give it a try.

“I bestow upon you a name,” William announced. “From the skinny dog that couldn’t even eat scraps of meat, to an Overlord that will be feared across the land. I give you the name of the World Wolf that once ate a God that ruled among many other Gods.”

William raised the lance in his hand as a golden light fell upon the trollhound’s body.

“Rise, Fenrir,” William ordered. “Devour all my enemies until none of their bones are left!”

The King Chess Piece inside William’s Sea of Consciousness glowed three times before returning to its normal state. It had recognized William’s choice and shared its divinity with the skinny dog who would become part of the red-headed boy’s Ten-Thousand Beast Army.
