Chapter 599: William Von Ainsworth, Launching!

A hysterical laughter rang out across the 25th Floor of Babylon.

Several Myriad Beasts were obliterated as a powerful laser beam bathed them in a golden light.

William sneered from inside the cockpit of a Giant Robot as he faced off against hundreds of Myriad Beasts that were out to destroy him.

It had been a long time since he had this much fun, and he planned to enjoy himself to the fullest

-

Several hours earlier…

After several hardships, William and Chiffon had arrived at the Floor of Creation. Upon arrival, the Half-Elf saved a pretty girl who was being chased by men wearing some kind of imperial uniform.

After beating the crap out of them, a Young Master of the ruling family, who governed the 25th Floor arrived at the scene. The newcomer immediately reprimanded William for getting in his way.

“You must be new here,” Xanhast Colton said while glaring at William. “Release my little sister before I ask the Enforcers to capture you and imprison you for life! How dare you take her hostage?!”

“Little sister?” William blinked as he looked down on the young lady that was latched on him like a leech.

The pretty girl with dark-brown hair smiled sweetly and looked at William as if she had found her Prince Charming.

“My hero,” Marissa Colton, Xanhast’s little sister, rested her head on William’s chest which made Xanhast clench his fist in anger.

“You, bastard, let go of my sister now!” Xanhast roared.

William tried to detach the pretty leech that was clinging to him because he didn’t want to add another ruling family to the list of those who were after his life.

The clash against the Agnis Family was troublesome enough, so if possible, he would like to avoid this kind of situation as much as possible.

No matter how William tried, Marissa refused to let go. The Half-Elf didn’t dare exert force because he was afraid that he would hurt the girl, leading to a confrontation between him and the Colton Family.

“Are you deaf? I said to unhand my little sister!”

“Calm your tits, bro. Can’t you see that it is your sister that doesn’t want to let go?”

Chiffon who was watching from the side frowned.

Marissa was clinging to William and it was making her feel irritated. Due to her sensitive nose, she could tell that the daughter of the Colton Family was using perfume. The fragrance had already attached itself to William’s clothes, as if marking him as her man.

Of course, this was something that Chiffon had assumed. In reality, Marissa was unaware of what was happening.

‘Big Brother is mine,’ Chiffon thought. ‘Mine.’

The pink-haired girl stepped forward and forcefully pried the pretty girl, who had started to sniff the Half-Elf’s clothes, off of William.

“H-Hey! Don’t be too rough,” Marissa cried out when Chiffon used her strength to pull her away from her Prince Charming.

Chiffon didn’t care about the girl’s nonsense and immediately pushed the thieving cat towards Xanhast, who hurriedly caught her in a firm embrace.

After dealing with the pest, Chiffon clung to William and buried her head on his chest. She then opened her mouth and devoured the fragrance that lingered on his clothes. The pink-haired girl would not allow a random girl to mark her Big Brother under her watchful eye.

William scratched his head because he didn’t know what to do in his current situation. In the end, he decided to hold Chiffon in a princess carry and left the scene as fast as he could.

Little did he know that his episode with the Brother and Sister pair wouldn’t end then and there.

Marissa, who had been tossed aside by William, was in a very foul mood. She couldn’t believe that someone would dare to reject her advances on the Floor that was ruled by her family.

Because of this, she went to the Trial Grounds, bringing along her maidservants, as well as her overprotective Big Brother, Xanhast.

“Marissa, what are we doing here?” Xanhast asked. “Don’t tell me you plan to make trouble for those two players?”

Marissa turned her head and glared at her Big Brother. She had been spoiled by her family ever since she was a little child. Because of this, she had developed a habit of always getting what she wanted, even if she had to brute force her way to do it.

She knew that no matter what she did, her parents, and her brother, would clean up her mess for her.

“What of it?” Marissa pouted. “Big Brother, that little girl bullied me. My hand still hurts because of her.”

Marissa showed her reddened hand to Xanhast, which made the latter’s gaze soften.

“It was your fault for clinging to that stranger,” Xanhast replied. “Did you forget Grandma’s warning? There is a chance that you might get pregnant if you hold hands with a boy.”

The corner of Marissa’s lips twitched when she heard her brother’s reply.

“Big Brother, I am no longer a child that you can trick with such nonsense.” Marissa huffed. “If you don’t want to help me then get out of my way!”

Marissa angrily walked away. She knew that William and Chiffon had just arrived in the Floor of Creation. Because of this, she decided to head straight towards the Trial Grounds, where the tests would be taken in order to proceed to the next floor.

The Floor of Creation was a unique floor. On this floor, people would fight against each other. However, instead of a simple fight, each person was allowed to “Create” anything that they wanted.

Of course, there is a limitation to this law.

They could only summon things that they knew by heart. Marissa may not be a fighter, but she was a scholar. She had read many ancient books, and learned a lot from them. Because of this, she was hailed as the greatest obstacle that the players had to face in order to proceed to the next floor.

Whenever Marissa was in the Trial Ground, the players-who knew about her notoriety-would cancel their appointment and wait until she left the premises, before challenging the examiner that was assigned to the trial.

The moment Marissa arrived at the Trial Ground, she immediately saw William and Chiffon in the crowd.

A sneer appeared on her pretty face as she marched towards the examiner who was about to start the examination.

“I will take over from here,” Marissa declared. “You may stand down.”

“Y-Young Lady! What are you doing here?” the examiner stuttered.

“Are you deaf? I said I will take over here. Stand down!”

“U-Understood! I apologize for my mistake.”

Marissa snorted and stepped on the podium. She then focused her attention on Chiffon who was looking back at her with a frown.

‘You b*tch, I will teach you not to mess around with me.’ Marissa cursed Chiffon in her heart.

After looking at the annoying pink bug, Marissa shifted his attention to the other players who were about to take the trial.

The moment their eyes met, the players hurriedly left the place in fear of facing Marissa’s wrath. Only William and Chiffon remained because they didn’t know how difficult it was to pass the test when Marissa took on the role as examiner.

“I will now explain the details of this trial,” Marissa said with a smile as she looked at William. “As you may already know, this Floor is called the Floor of Creation. Inside this domain, everyone is able to create something out of thin air, and use it to aid them in battle.

“In order to pass, you must defeat me and my Big Brother in combat. Don’t worry, we will take it easy on you.”

Marissa laughed internally. Even though she said that she would take it easy, she had no intention of giving William and the hateful pink bug any handicap. She would use her full power to defeat William, with the intention of showing him how powerful she was.

With a wave of her hand, Marissa activated the privilege granted to her family by the Guardian of the Floor.

William and Chiffon found themselves in a wasteland. The environment was quite desolate and dark clouds blocked the sky.

Marissa and Xanhast stood two hundred meters away from their opponents. The older brother pitied William and Chiffon because they had no idea what they were about to face. Even if he didn’t assist her little sister, the two players wouldn’t be able to beat her even if all the players earlier assisted them in battle.

“Allow me to demonstrate how this floor works,” Marissa said with a smirk.

A few seconds later, dozens of giant beasts appeared behind her.

The corner of William’s lips twitched when he saw this. The System had informed him that all of the Beasts that Marissa had created were all Myriad Beasts. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Now that you have seen how this trial works, I’ll give you a minute to create something that you can use to win against me,” Marissa stated. She was overflowing with confidence because she had stood in this battleground countless times before.

The pretty girl was even looking forward to what William could do in this hopeless situation.

“Let me confirm something, I can create anything right?” William asked.

“Yes.” Marissa nodded. “However, it must be something that you are knowledgeable about. You can’t create something that doesn’t exist.”

“Okay.” William grinned.

He had bought the information of each floor from the Merchant Guild and had a vague understanding about the Power of Creation that the 25th Floor specialized in.

In fact, he was even looking forward to going to this floor because there was something that he had missed in his previous lifetime. Growing up, William had dreamed of riding a Giant Robot.

The Half-Elf closed his eyes and let his imagination run wild.

The air trembled, and a Giant Robot that looked like a Gandamn appeared behind him. William held Chiffon’s hand as a beam of light shot down towards them.

Immediately, the Half-Elf found himself inside a cockpit holding a PayStation Controller in his hands.

The cockpit was a two seater and Chiffon sat snugly behind him. William’s eyes glowed with excitement as he pressed the button of his controller. The Gandamn started to move, which made the Half-Elf incredibly excited.

“Okay, let’s do this,” William grinned like a little boy who had found his favorite toy. “William Von Ainsworth, Launching!”

The Giant Robot’s rocket boosters that were located on its back roared to life. It then charged forward like a rocket that was about to go to space.

Marissa and Xanhast looked at the unknown metallic creature in front of them. This was the first time they had seen such a thing, but for some reason, they felt that they would have to take this fight seriously if they wanted to win against William.
