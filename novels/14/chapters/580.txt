After knowing the truth, Celeste pressed her sister for answers, which went on for an hour before the two decided to have dinner together.

“I wish I could meet him, this William,” Celeste said as she sat on the couch with her twin sister.

Celine smirked. “Don’t worry. I’m sure that you’ll meet him sooner or later. He’s a handful, but I’ve watched him since he was ten years old. I can vouch that he is a good person, albeit narcissistic.”

Celeste giggled as she leaned on her sister. Celine knew exactly what she wanted so she wrapped her arms around Celine and brushed her twin sister’s light-green hair, that was as smooth as silk, with her hand.

If the students of the academy could see their beautiful Elven Professor right now, all of them would be shocked because she was acting like a spoiled little girl. Just like Celine, Celeste was an exceptional beauty, even among the elves.

She would often receive marriage proposals from nobles, princes, and even very influential figures that hailed from all over the Central Continent. Unfortunately, she rejected them all.

The Sin she carried and the prophecy of the Elves prevented her from having a relationship with anyone. The collar on her neck also protected her from being enslaved, and forced against her will.

If anyone was foolish enough to take her by force, all of them would suffer a fate that was worse than death.

“Big Sister, is he?” Celeste asked. After hearing Celine’s tale, she managed to connect the dots together, which led to a possibility.

However, Celine’s answer invalidated the suspicion she had in mind.

“No,” Celine replied firmly. “He’s not the Prince of Darkness. I used my body to confirm this. It can’t be wrong. But, if you still have reservations, you can check every inch of it later when we bathe together.

“There’s a possibility that it appeared in a place that I couldn’t see. Would you be a dear, and do a detailed diagnosis of my body? Your ability allows you to do that, right?”

Celeste nodded her head. For her sister to use her maidenhood to confirm whether her Disciple was the Prince in the prophecy was something she didn’t expect.

She had long known that Celine had wanted to break free from the shackles of Fate that bound her. But, the method her twin sister used was quite extreme.

Celeste didn’t want to admit it, but she was quite envious of her sister’s strong determination. Unfortunately, she couldn’t do the same. The Sin she possessed wouldn’t allow that to happen.

“Don’t worry, Big Sister,” Celeste said as she held Celine’s hand. “When I find who the real Prince is. I will do my best to… kill him.”

Celine squeezed Celeste’s hand and shook her head. “If you were to cross paths with him, run away as far as you can. I will be the one to kill him. You don’t need to dirty your hands.”

Celeste bit her lip in frustration. It was always Celine that protected her from the shadows. Although she had killed people before, she was not very fond of it. Unlike Celine that wouldn’t bat an eye in ending someone else’s life, Celeste wasn’t that coldhearted.

This was why she was quite thankful that she received the rare profession Familiamancer. It allowed her to summon two powerful familiars that did the dirty work for her.

“I have a favor to ask you,” Celine said as she looked straight into Celeste’s blue eyes. “I will be going to the Demon Continent soon. I don’t know when I will be able to return to the Central and Southern Continent.

“If you crossed paths with my Disciple, look after him for me. He is a magnet for trouble, and I’m afraid that he will be doing something troublesome during his stay here in the Central Continent.”

Celeste nodded, but she couldn’t help but tease her sister for worrying too much about her Disciple.

“He sounds like a problem child.” Celeste chuckled. “Just what did you see in him to make him your Disciple?”

“… I lost a bet with him.”

“E-Excuse me?”

Celine chuckled because it was true that she became William’s Master because of a bet. Back then, she thought that the boy was just bluffing, so she agreed to bet with him.

She never thought that one of the little Shepherds of Lont, who herded goats, would someday be a conqueror that would command an army that numbered in the millions.

The image of William standing on top of Ella flashed in her mind. A few seconds later, it was replaced by William standing on top of a Bone Dragon, commanding an Undead Army that had massacred the Elves without mercy.

A frown appeared on Celine’s beautiful face when she remembered that scene that happened years ago. Although William hadn’t turned into a complete undead. He still suffered from bloodthirst due to the effects of Malacai’s staff.

During the week that they were together inside Eternity, she had offered her blood to William. Celine thought that William would reject her offer. However, the Half-Elf shamelessly accepted her offer, and sank his fangs into her tender breast.

Back then, the feeling of pleasure that washed over her body intoxicated her. Now, she understood why the Elves that were living inside her disciple’s Thousand Beast Domain, were very eager to have their blood sucked by their new Master.

The feeling was simply too good to be true.

Her only gripe was the location where William decided to suck her blood. He could have bitten her neck like he does to others, but the Half-Elf had to take her blood from that part of her body.

A blush appeared on Celine’s face when she remembered that scene. She silently cursed William for being shameless, because he did it not once, but twice, during the week that they were together.

“Big Sister, what’s wrong?” Celeste asked after noticing the redness of Celine’s face. “Is something wrong?”

“No,” Celine replied to hide her embarrassment. “I think I had too much of the wine we drank during dinner.”

“Big Sister, you only drank one cup. Usually, it takes at least twenty cups before that wine has any effect on you.”

“It’s been years since I drank wine. I guess my tolerance went down during that period.”

Celeste looked at her big sister with a doubtful expression. However, since she didn’t want to ruin the mood, she decided to toss it to the side and talk about other things.

During the entirety of the night, the two beautiful elves chatted about the experiences they had during the time that they weren’t together. They no longer talked about the Elven Prophecy, or the Prince that would one day claim one of them as his bride.

The two of them only had a few days together, and they were trying to make up for the years that they had been separated. Both of them didn’t know when they would meet again. However, one thing was certain.

The peace that both of them shared at the moment, would soon disappear, like the fleeting clouds in the horizon.
