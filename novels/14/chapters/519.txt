Chapter 519: Hunger That Knew No Bounds [Part 2]

“Big Brother, do you still have more?” Chiffon, the adorable girl, looked up at William in expectation. She had already seen the lollipop in William’s hand, but still pretended not to see it.

William stiffly handed the lollipop at her and the girl happily tore the wrapper off, revealing the chocolate candy that made her eyes sparkle.

Chiffon unceremoniously ate the wrapper first, before she placed the candy inside her mouth. This time, she didn’t chew it and just licked it, like William had told her to do.

For some reason, after eating the chocolate lollipop earlier, the hunger she felt disappeared completely. This was the first time that Chiffon experienced something like that. Usually, even after she ate three tons of garbage, the hunger would return after a few hours.

She was very shocked when a single lollipop managed to stop her hunger pains as if it was done by magic.

William stared at the cute girl who seemed to have reached enlightenment. After hesitating for two minutes, he finally decided to introduce himself to her. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“My name is William Von Ainsworth,” William said. “Feel free to call me, Will. How about you? What’s your name?”

Although he already knew the answer, he still asked the question because he felt that it would be rude to call out people’s names without proper introduction.

The loli took out the lollipop from her adorable lips as she made a curtsy and introduced herself.

“Chiffon Val Gremory,” Chiffon replied. “Big Brother, just call me Chiffon.”

“Um, I’m seventeen years old. I will have my birthday in a month. Is it really fine to call me Big Brother?”

“It’s fine, Big Brother. I am only twelve years old. You are clearly older than me.”

The corner of William’s lips twitched because the little loli dared to lie to him. If he didn’t have the System, he would readily accept her explanation without any doubt, because she did look like a twelve year-old due to her height and loveable appearance.

‘Am I fated to always stumble upon this kind of situation?’ William thought as he sighed internally. ‘My gut feeling is telling me that I’m going to be involved in something problematic.’

Chiffon watched William with genuine interest. She had an extra strong perception towards magic, and she was sure that William didn’t take out the lollipop from his storage ring.

Since that was the case, Chiffon came to a realization.

William could produce the lollipop using his ability.

The pink-haired girl didn’t know what kind of ability it was, but one thing was for certain. William was someone that could solve her hunger problems.

“Big Brother, is there something wrong?” Chiffon inquired as she walked up to him in a cute manner.

She then took hold of William’s hand and held it firmly. ‘I need to know more about this person.’

William was at a loss on what to do. He didn’t regret giving Chiffon his lollipop, but her very existence was a flag that he didn’t want to take part of. If this was a route for a game, William would steer clear off her route and look for other heroines to conquer.

Nothing good came out of dealing with one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

He already experienced the threat that Princess Sidonie and Morgana possessed, so how could he possibly underestimate someone who bore the title of one of the Greatest Sins of the world?

William cleared out his throat as he decided to make an excuse in order to leave Chiffon behind.

“Um, Chiffon, I still have things to do,” William said as he looked at the small hand that firmly held his own hand. “I need to go to Silverwind City to buy a few things.

“Is that so?” Chiffon asked. “Don’t worry, Big Brother. I came to the Academy three months ago. Although I’m not very familiar with the city, I had visited it thrice during my stay here.”

“… You don’t say.”

“?”

Chiffon tilted her head cutely, which made William’s heart shudder. Looking at Chiffon made him remember his cousin Eve, and Brianna whom he had considered as his own little sister.

“Big Brother, do you have any more of these lollipops?” Chiffon asked. “I like them very much.”

Chiffon looked up at William and stared at him intently. The innocent pair of eyes was too much for him to bear, so he averted his gaze to calm his heart.

After thinking things through, William relented. He produced ten, red, blue, and chocolate lollipops and handed them to Chiffon. He then carefully explained their uses.

“As I told you before, the chocolate lollipop can last for three days as long as you don’t chew it,” William explained. “This red lollipop has the ability to cure minor wounds. If you get injured, eat one of them. This blue lollipop replenishes magic power. If you feel drained from using magic spells, take one as well

“Remember that the red and blue lollipop can be only eaten once, and will not last as long as the chocolate lollipop. If you are feeling hungry, just place the chocolate lollipop in your mouth and lick it.”

Chiffon held the lollipops as if they were priceless treasures. She then carefully placed it inside her storage ring before looking at William with a grateful expression.

“Big Brother, thank you for the lollipops,” Chiffon said. “Where did you buy them? If possible, I want to buy them in bulk.”

“Um, these lollipops can’t be bought anywhere. These are all hand made.”

“Did you make them, Big Brother?”

“…Yes.”

William wanted to say no, but the puppy eyes that were looking up at him, made the lie that he was about to say become stuck in his throat.

“You are amazing, Big Brother!” Chiffon praised. “Maybe you should open a candy shop. I promise that I will be your number one customer!”

“… I’ll think about it,” William replied.

Chiffon nodded her head like an obedient child. She then pulled William’s hand as she walked towards the Academy.

“Big Brother, Let’s go,” Chiffon urged. “We need to get back before six in the evening. If we dilly dally, we won’t be able to stroll around the city for a long time.”

William shook his head as he allowed the girl, whom he had just met, drag him back to the Academy. Although he didn’t regret giving Chiffon his lollipops, he was feeling troubled because of the consequences of his actions.

Inside Silverwind Academy…

“Your Majesty, I have something to report,” Gilbert Geis, the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy, as well as Professor Rita’s father, said as he looked at the mirror inside his office.

(A/N: In case you had forgotten, Professor Rita is the professor in charge of Class A)

“Gilbert? Did something happen?” Emperor Leonidas stared at the Headmaster with a calm expression on his face.

“Chiffon came in contact with William,” Gilbert replied. “Should I intervene?”

An expression of surprise appeared on Emperor Leonidas’ face when he heard the Headmaster’s report. However, this surprise didn’t last long before it became serious.

“How did it happen?” Emperor Leonidas inquired.

Chiffon was a special existence within the Academy and there were people that monitored her from the shadows. When Gilbert had been informed about the current development, he immediately sought the Emperor’s opinion on how to deal with the current events.

After listening to Gilbert’s narration on how the two met, Emperor Leonidas rubbed his chin in contemplation.

“Are they getting along?” the Emperor asked.

Gilbert nodded. “I just checked and I saw Chiffon dragging William back to the academy. Also…”

“Also?”

“She seemed to be happy. Although she wasn’t smiling, I could vaguely feel her mood from afar. How should I proceed, Your Majesty?”

A minute of silence enveloped the room as the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy waited for the Emperor’s orders. Finally, after the wait that almost felt like years, Emperor Leonidas finally made up his mind.

“Gilbert.”

“Your Majesty?”

“Don’t do anything,” Emperor Leonidas ordered. “However, continue to constantly monitor Chiffon. You already know who she is, and what her affiliation is. I don’t want that bastard to say that I was not looking after the daughter that he had tossed away.”

Gilbert nodded respectfully. “As you wish, Your Majesty.”

Emperor Leonidas was about to cut off the connection, but stopped midway and asked a question.

“Did she really look happy?”

“Yes. I even have a recording. Do you want to see it, Your Majesty?”

“Show it to me,” Emperor Leonidas ordered.

The Headmaster showed a projection where Chiffon could be seen dragging William’s hand. The Half-Elf had a resigned look on his face, while the little girl was wearing an expression of calm.

When the recording stopped, the Emperor of the Kraetor Empire also ended the conversation.

Inside his study room, the Sovereign of the Empire leaned his back on his chair. The image of Chiffon dragging his granddaughter’s fiance back to the Academy was still fresh in his mind.

“Evexius was right,” Emperor Leonidas snorted. “That Half-Elf is a penchant for trouble.”
