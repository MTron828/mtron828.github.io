Chapter 365: William’s King’s Legion [Part 1]

William stared at the floating island in the sky. No matter how much he sent his senses towards the floating island, he couldn’t feel anything.

The Domain itself was void of any animal life. There were no howls of beasts, no chirping from the birds. Even the subtle sound of insects couldn’t be heard in this Domain, which made William very uncomfortable.

After looking at the floating island in the sky for five more minutes, William raised the sheathed dagger in his hand. A gentle wave of red light washed over his body.

Soon, his feet rose from the ground as the power of the dagger guided him towards the floating island. It didn’t take long before his feet were once again firmly planted on the ground.

‘Beautiful,’ the apparition of Ashe, that was floating above William’s back, said as she stared at the imposing fortress that had existed since the time of the Ancient Gods. The structure that held back the attacks of the Dark Beasts that tried to wipe the Human race from the face of the Earth.

The last stronghold of Humanity, Avalon, stood in front of William in all of its ancient glory.

William admired the fortress for a full minute before running towards its massive gates. He had already summoned Stormcaller in order to be ready for any unexpected surprises.

Ironically, when he was halfway to the gates, they opened on their own. The sound of rattling reverberated in the air as thousands of skeleton warriors poured out through the massive gates. With a glance, the red-headed boy could easily tell that they weren’t there to give him a warm welcome.

William stopped his charge and used his appraisal skill to check the undead army that was in front of him.

“The only real threat is the Death Knight and his Bone Dragon mount. At least that is what I’d like to say, but their numbers cannot be scoffed at.” William narrowed his eyes. “There are at least four thousand of them.”

Ashe took a fighting stance above William. She was currently merged with him, so she needed to coordinate with his will.

“Remember, you can’t fight for a long time,” Ashe reminded. “We don’t know if we will be fighting more monsters once we get inside. It is best to conserve your strength.”

William nodded. He agreed with Ashe because there was still the Pseudo-Demigod to deal with. He couldn’t possibly waste his limited time fighting against the skeletal army.

“Join me on the battlefield,” William ordered as he pointed his spear at the army that was approaching him. “Come forth, King’s Legion!”

Several portals appeared behind William as his Small Beast Army came forth to aid him in battle.

Ella led the Angorian War Ibexes and flanked William’s right side. Fenrir led his troop of Trollhounds and formed the vanguard in front of William.

Scadrez, the Blood Eagle, the Rainbow Birds, and the Cercopes Monkeys flanked William’s left side.

Suddenly, two giant portals appeared in the space several meters above the red-headed boy. Soon, two mighty screeches resounded in the Domain as a Wyvern, and a Gryphon flew out of the portals. The two magical beasts circled around William once before hovering several meters from his left and right sides.

“Dave Cornwell, reporting for duty, My Lord.”

“Conrad Kent Carlton, at your service, My Liege,”

“This looks interesting. Count me in!” Psoglav declared as he also appeared on the battlefield.

A small, rainbow-colored, Anteater also appeared and looked at Avalon with nostalgia. “It’s been thousands of years since I saw Avalon. It’s like having a reunion with an old friend.”

“Oh? Are those skeletons your friends as well?” William inquired.

“I can’t really tell,” Kasogonaga answered. “I can’t possibly remember the faces of all the Humans I’ve met in my lifetime. Besides, if they are really the ones I know, I will gladly send them off to end their suffering.”

William nodded his head in understanding. Kasogonaga was right, it would be best to let these undead warriors return to the Cycle of Reincarnation and put an end to their suffering.

“Dave and Conrad, the two of you handle the Death Knight and Bone Dragon,” William ordered. “The rest of you, smash that skeleton army apart!”

A series of bleating, screeches, and howls, answered William’s orders.

“”Yes, Sir!””

Dave and Conrad led the charge of William’s legion as they descended upon the skeletal army, leaving skeletal parts in their wake.

Arrows and spells flew in the air as the skeletal archers and mages fought back. Most of their attacks hit the Trollhounds, giving them serious injuries. They were the initial impact of William’s forces, but they numbered less than a hundred.

After fighting against the Goblins in the Goblin Crypt and resting inside the Magic Crystal Cavern, each of the trollhounds had increased their rank and were now all Rank C (Mid) Beasts. Fenrir had also crossed the threshold and became a Rank B (Low) Beast.

A few seconds later, these injured Trollhounds stood up and growled in anger. Because their bodies had mutated, their regeneration ability had become as powerful as the regeneration ability of a Mountain Troll. No, it was closer to the regeneration ability of a Hydra.

William had also blessed these Trollhounds with the power of Rhongomyniad. Because of this, all of their stats and latent abilities increased drastically. Their regeneration ability was only two stages short of the Gigantic Trollhound that William had fought back in the Barony of Bradford.

Fenrir roared mightily as it thrashed the skeletons in front of it. Right now, Fernrir was a meter and a half tall, which was as tall as an adult horse.

He was slightly bigger than the Trollhounds that were a meter tall and were currently fighting bravely by his side.

William couldn’t help but remember when the skinny Trollhound, who had been on the verge of death, agreed to become part of his herd. Right now, that same skinny Trollhound was looking more and more like that Legendary Wolf who had swallowed a God whole.

The Half-Elf was eager to see the day when Fenrir would become powerful enough to pave the way to allow him to emerge victorious in the battles that he would have to face in the future.

No matter who it is. Whether it is a mortal, immortal, a Demigod, or a God, William hoped that his Beast of Conquest would swallow all opposition that would block his way.
