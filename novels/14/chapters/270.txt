Chapter 270: Pain Is Temporary, But My Fists Are Eternal

“Where are we going?” Wendy asked. “What mission will we be doing this time?”

William didn’t answer as he led Wendy through the Solaris Dormitory. The students that saw them together immediately made themselves scarce because Williams was radiating a “Do not fck with me right now B*tches” aura.

Wendy was oblivious of William’s current expression because the red-headed boy was walking ahead of her. All she knew was that something was very different about the boy whom she had been with for the past few days.

When the two finally arrived inside William’s room, the red-headed boy turned around and hugged Wendy all of a sudden.

The blonde beauty was caught by surprise because she didn’t expect that William would suddenly hug her out of the blue. Also, the boy’s body was trembling as if he was trying to hold himself back from doing something.

Wendy instinctively hugged him back and caressed the back of his head, “What’s wrong? Did something happen?”

William didn’t answer. Instead, he held her tighter. The scene where Carter almost kissed Wendy played over and over inside his head, and it made him feel like killing someone. He had used all of his willpower to stop himself from attacking the professor after he opened the door in his room.

He knew that he still didn’t know whether the Professor was the true Mastermind behind it all, or if he had acquaintances that were working with him inside the academy. All he knew was that he couldn’t allow Wendy to be tainted by a man who would resort to such lengths to ensnare the girl that he wanted to protect.

A girl that had found a place inside his heart.

After calming down, William reluctantly took a step back and faced the worried-looking girl in front of him.

“Wendy, I want to give you something,” William said as he took out a lollipop from his pocket. He removed its wrapping and presented it to the girl who loved to eat candies.

“This is my candy,” William said. “Try it. I’m sure that it tastes way better than all the candies that you have eaten in the past.”

“Really?” Wendy took the candy from William’s hand and appraised it. “This is the first time I’ve seen a candy like this. What is it called?”

“It’s called a lollipop.”

“Loli… pop?”

“Yes.” William nodded. “Try it.”

Wendy smiled and placed the pink lollipop inside her mouth and started to lick it. It wasn’t as sweet as the candy that the Professor gave her, but there was an addicting taste to it that she couldn’t explain. A few seconds later, she felt light-headed, and leaned helplessly against William’s body for support.

“Don’t worry,” William whispered in Wendy’s ear. “You’re going to be fine now. Everything is going to be alright.”

The lollipop inside Wendy’s mouth dissolved completely, and its Divinity washed over Wendy’s body like a gentle breeze. It felt so good that the girl sighed once before burying her head into William’s chest to sleep.

William sighed in relief as he gently lifted her body and carried her towards the bed, so that she could sleep more comfortably. After taking off her shoes, the red-headed boy sat beside Wendy and held her hand.

He had already made his decision to remove the spell inside Wendy’s body. He wouldn’t allow Carter to use the Mind Weaver Spell to force her to do something that she didn’t want to do. The scenes that the system had shared with him while he ran full speed towards Carter’s residence made him want to murder Carter a thousand times over.

If he was only a few seconds late, Wendy might have already been…

Killing intent rose within William’s heart as his gaze sharpened like a blade. He had already considered Wendy his lover and he wouldn’t allow Carter, or any man, to lay their hands on her.

William wouldn’t allow it.

No matter who it was. Whether it was a Teacher, a Knight, a Prince, or a King, he would kill anyone who tried to hurt Wendy. He didn’t mind dirtying his hands as long as the people that were important to him lived happy and carefree lives.

Soon, the killing intent receded as William got hold of his senses. The System was currently monitoring the changes in Wendy’s body and her vital signs had already returned to normal.

[ Host, the Mind Weaver Spell has been completely erased from Wendy’s Sea of Consciousness. She is no longer under its effects. Also, with the power of the Lollipop, she has gained a high resistance against Charm Spells that are not re-enforced by Divine Powers. ]

‘Thank you for the report,’ William replied. ‘Did you succeed in planting the tracker on the Professor’s body when we shook hands?”

[ Yes. Currently, the professor is sitting in his room with his eyes closed. I assume that he is just meditating, or perhaps controlling those under the effect of the Mind Weaver Spell from his location. ]

‘Continue to monitor him,’ William ordered. ‘If he does something suspicious, let me know right away.’

[ Understood. ]

Somewhere in Asgard…

“William, do you want to join my team?” a beautiful valkyrie with red hair asked with a smile. “Your performance in the last battle against the Orcs was amazing. I’d like to have a brave warrior like you on my team.”

“I’m sorry, but I’m already a member of Captain Wendy’s Team,” William replied.

The Valkyrie chuckled as she leaned her voluptuous body over William’s. “I’m sure that I can give you more benefits than that tomboy could ever give you. If you like, I can even…”

“Hold it right there, B*tch!”

An enraged Wendy stormed towards William and pushed the red-haired Valkyrie aside.

“How many times do I need to tell you, Herja, that William is my teammate?” Wendy asked with a glare. “Stop poaching the warriors from our legion!”

Herja crossed her arms over her chest and fearlessly returned Wendy’s glare. “I’m just giving William an option. I mean, warriors are allowed to go to another Legion if they want to. You can’t make them stay by force. This is the rule that Lady Freya has decreed, is it not?”

“Yes. What you say is true,” Wendy replied with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. “However, blatant poaching of a warrior from another Legion is not included in Lady Freya’s decree. You are overstepping your bounds. If William wants to leave my Legion then I will allow it. What I will not allow is for you, or any of the other Captains, to take him away by force!”

“Silly Wendy,” Herja grinned. “I’m not forcing anyone. Like I said, I am only giving William an option. I am not the first, nor will be the last to ask him to jump ship. Others have already done so before me, so it’s only normal for me to join the trend as well.”

Herja was stating a fact and Wendy couldn’t refute it. Among the new warriors that were brought to Valhalla, William was simply too eye-catching. His silver hair, coupled with his handsome looks already made him an eye-candy to the ladies. However, aside from his good looks, he was also a strong and very capable warrior.

A warrior who didn’t shy away in the face of danger in order to protect his comrades and allow them time to escape from an enemy that was stronger than them. Valkyries may be warriors, but they were also maidens. They were constantly looking for a life partner that could protect their backs on the battlefield.

Wendy understood this, and that’s why she was always in the lookout for those who were bold enough to seduce William and whisk him away from her hold.

Seeing that the look on Wendy’s face was close to a breaking point, Herja decided to take her leave. Although they were both Valkyries, Wendy was stronger than her. It could even be said that Wendy was among the top three strongest Valkyrie Captains because she was blessed with superhuman strength.

She could easily turn an Orc Warrior’s head into meat paste with a single slap. This was why most Valkyries didn’t want to get on her bad side. The only reason why they dared to was because of William.

The silver-haired warrior was simply too irresistible for the Valkyrie Captains to ignore.

“Take your time and think about it, William,” Herja said as wings sprouted behind her back. “You are welcome in my Legion anytime.”

After saying those words, Herja flew towards the sky and gave William one last wink before flying away in the direction of her residence.

Wendy looked at the retreating figure with disdain. She was so close to summoning her spear and turning the hateful Valkyrie Captain into a skewered pig.

“William,” Wendy said as she turned her head to look at the warrior who was looking at her with a calm expression. “I have something to ask of you.”

William placed his hands behind his back as he stood straight like a sword. “Is it another mission? I am ready to go anytime, Captain.”

Wendy chuckled. This was the sort of person William was. As long as it was a mission, he would do it in a serious manner that earned him the admiration, and respect of warriors and Valkyries alike.

‘And because of this, I can’t allow others to have you,’ Wendy thought as she walked towards the warrior that she had personally taken from the battlefield of Midgard.

She looked at his silver-hair, his beautiful light-green eyes, and his face that had made the ladies in Valhalla look at him like wolves finding their prey.

“William.”

“Yes, Captain?”

“Will you marry me?”

“… Excuse me?”

Wendy looked at the confused teenager with a smile on her face. Her hands wrapped around his body in a light embrace. It was loose enough to allow William to not get suffocated, but firm enough to prevent him from escaping.

The tomboy Valkyrie Captain under Gunnr’s legion had finally decided who her “Partner for Life” would be. She would not allow anyone to take her silver-haired warrior away from her, so she decided to marry him and stop anyone from making advances on him.

“Will you marry me?” Wendy repeated. “I swear that if you say no, I’ll break all of your bones and drag you to Lady Freya’s quarters. There, we would exchange our vows and become partners for life. Don’t worry, I’ll ask the Goddess Idun to give me some of her golden apples to help your body heal after our wedding is done.”

Wendy narrowed her gaze as she looked straight into William’s eyes. They were the eyes of a woman that wouldn’t take “No” for an answer. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“So, are you going to say yes? Or must I drag you kicking and screaming like a little girl? The choice is yours to make. Also, remember this, William. Pain is temporary, but my fists are eternal. If you don’t want to suffer eternal pain, you should already know what answer you are going to give me, yes?”

“…”
