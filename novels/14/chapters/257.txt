Chapter 257: The Ending Of A Fairy Tale [Part 2]

William frowned. A voice inside his head was telling him that he shouldn’t underestimate the sales lady’s words.

Belle, who was standing beside William, grabbed his arm and pulled him away from the stall. The black-haired beauty half-dragged William towards the temple without saying a word.

The saleslady watched the two of them with a smile hidden under her veil. She had already given William a choice, whether he accepted it or not, was his own choice.

As William and Belle walked towards the stairs of the temple, a gentle breeze blew and whispered something in William’s ears.

“Star-crossed lovers, heartache and regret. When I look in your eyes, I wish that we had never met.”

After the incident at the stall, the two wandered around the temple before offering their prayer to the Deity that was said to be the patron of the temple.

Ironically, the Deity of the temple was said to be the Deity of Love and Reunions. As someone who had met real Gods and Deities, William closed his eyes and clasped his hands together.

He prayed…

He prayed with all his might to allow him to spend more time with Belle.

He poured out his heart in his prayer, hoping that his words would reach the Patron Deity that governed over Love and Reunions.

Belle had finished her prayer and looked sideways at the handsome Half-Elf that had been with her for the past two and a half days.

William had told her that he would return to his world at exactly ten in the evening. Belle had only spent such a short time with him, but something deep inside her wanted to hold onto him and never let go.

And she did just that.

While William was praying, she hugged him from behind. At first, William was surprised, but he once again closed his eyes and resumed his prayer. Belle was two heads taller than William, and if one was to look at them from the side, they would think that the two of them were brother and sister.

Finally, William finished his prayer. As if both of them had an agreement, they walked away from the crowd and looked for a place where the two of them could be alone together.

“According to the staff, there will also be a firework display,” Belle said as she sat beside William.

The two of them went to a small clearing that was located at the back of the temple. William looked up at the countless stars in the sky. These were the stars that he had not seen for many years. They looked both familiar and foreign to him.

“The stars here are different,” William said softly.

“Will,” Belle said as she held his hand. “Why don’t you just stay here? Stay here with me? I will look after you and make sure that you don’t suffer. You don’t need to fight anymore. Just, be with me. Please?”

William gazed at her eyes and felt his heart waver.

He was very tempted to say “Yes. I will stay with you”.

But each time he tried to say those words, the faces of several people flashed inside his head. They were the faces of the people that were important to him, who were on the “other side” where Belle didn’t belong.

A place where the Shepherd goes to tend his sheep…

A place where the weaver couldn’t hope to reach.

“Can you hear it?” William held Belle’s hand and placed it over his chest. “Can you feel it? This heart of mine yearns for you, and yet, I can’t say Yes to your proposal.”

“Why?” Belle asked. “Why can’t you just stay here with me? Here, where it is safe, and you don’t need to risk your life to fight for a kingdom that might fall in the upcoming war?”

“Because they need me.”

“I need you, too!”

Belle hugged William in a tight embrace. “I need you[,] too, William!”

William felt something wet fall on his head as Belle’s body trembled.

“You promised me,” Belle said between sobs. “You said that the next time we met that you would never let me go. You promised me!”

William felt like a lump was stuck to his throat as Belle poured her feelings over him. He never mentioned who he really was, but for some reason, Belle was able to guess his true identity.

The Half-Elf wrapped his arms around Belle and held her tight.

“I wish to stay with you as well. I really do,” William replied. He was doing his best not to let the tears in his eyes fall. “I’m sorry, Belle, but I can’t stay here with you.”

Belle felt her heart breaking as the emotions that she had held back for a long time exploded inside her chest. She begged William over and over, but his answer was still a no. In the end, Belle stood up and ran away with tears falling down her eyes, blurring her vision.

“William, you’re a liar! I hate you!”

Those were her parting words as she ran away from the boy who had unknowingly crossed the multiverse just to see her again.

William watched her go and the tears that he had been holding back fell like rain. He wanted to run after her, but he didn’t have the courage to do so. He just covered his eyes with his hands as his body trembled, fighting off the longing he held for her. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Back then, he was not able to be with her because of his illness.

Now, he was unable to stay with her because he had a duty to fulfill.

[ Ding! ]

[ Do you wish to remain in this world? ]

[ Yes / No ]

William opened his eyes as he stared at the string of words that appeared on his status page. He was sure that when the timer reset, he would be sent back to his world. However, this time, a new option appeared.

‘I can stay?’ William was half in doubt when he saw the system message blinking in front of him. For a moment he thought he was imagining things, but after wiping the tears from his eyes, he realized that what he was seeing was real.

He didn’t make a decision right away, instead he walked back to the Temple Shrine then down the stairs, until he reached the stall where the accessories were being sold.

“Looks like you’ve broken up with your girlfriend,” the saleslady teased the boy who hadn’t even bothered to wipe the tear stains from his face.

“You said that you will sell me the ring for a promise, right?” William asked.

The sales lady nodded. “As this ring represents the promise of love, I shall make a request as one who also loves. I wish to save the one I love.

“If you promise me that in the future you will help me save him, I will give you the ring. He resides in your world, so if you choose to take this ring, you will have to return to your world. The choice is yours to make.”

“Do you want me to write a contract or make an oath?” William inquired. “I will do it.”

“There’s no need for that,” the lady chuckled in an almost musical tone. “I believe that you are someone who will not take back your word.”

The sales lady took the silver ring from her collection and gave it to William.

“Here you go,” the saleslady said. “The Ring of Vega is yours.”

“Thank you,” William replied.

“No need to thank me, after all, it is not free.” the sales lady patted the boy’s head. “Go. Every second counts.”

William nodded his head and left the Temple Grounds. He ran with all of his might towards Belle’s Villa. He wanted to see her, to hold her, and tell her how much he loved her with the little time he had left.
