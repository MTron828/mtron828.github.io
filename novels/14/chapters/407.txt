Chapter 407: Subclass Integration

“Atlantis…,” William muttered as he looked at the information of the new Dungeon that had been registered inside his ring of conquest.

-

[ Atlantis ]

— In times long forgotten, there was once a legendary city known for its advanced culture and technology.

— Many tales abound about how this city disappeared from the face of the world. Some said that, due to its advanced technology, the city traveled towards new worlds and frontiers unknown to many.

— Some said that it was submerged somewhere in the vast ocean… waiting for someone to discover it once again.

— Countless people throughout the years have searched for this city born from Myths and Legends, but none of them were able to find it. Only its name and legacy remained, and even that, too, would also be forgotten in due time.

— The City of Atlantis. The Lost Empire of a Forgotten World.

— Difficulty Rating: SSR

— Number of Floors: 100

— Monster Types: Unknown

-

William felt anticipation as he finished reading the information of this ancient city. Deep down, he was looking forward to discovering the secrets that it held.

Wendy stirred in her slumber as she sleepily raised her head to look at William.

“Our journey is still long,” William said as he kissed her forehead. “Sleep. I’ll wake you up when it’s time for dinner.”

Wendy sleepily nodded her head and kissed William’s cheek before she closed her eyes to sleep once more. The battle inside the Goblin Crypt had made her, and Ian, very exhausted.

It would take a few more days before they reached the North where William decided to stay for the time being.

The Half-Elf didn’t want to disturb Est and Brendan while they worked to rescue the survivors on the outskirts of the Kingdom. Although he didn’t know why Deus decided to withdraw quite a few of their forces from the Hellan Capital, William had a hunch that it was due to Conner’s order to look for the Undying Lands, which was now inside his Thousand Beast Domain.

He wasn’t worried about Est’s safety because he had already briefed Brendan on what to do in case the members of Deus returned to take back their control of the capital. Also, Ezio was there to mentor Brendan as the latter underwent his Assassin Training.

Yes. William decided to make Brendan a Disciple of his Fourth Master, Ezio. This way, the Son of the Prime Minister’s talents wouldn’t be wasted. Also, having someone as capable as Brendan would become a big boost to William’s private forces in the future.

William also decided to bring Ian and Wendy to train the Dungeon of Atlantis in order to help raise their rank and allow them to gain real battle experience.

‘I almost forgot the advice that Issei had told me back in the Temple of the Gods,’ William thought as he opened the Familia option in his status page.

William didn’t stop there and accessed Ashe’s personal information.

-

Name: Ashera Dy Cordelia

Race: Half-Nymph

Age: 16

Job Class: Spirit Fencer (Level 32)

-

After checking the information that he was looking for, William consulted the System to help him conduct an experiment.

-

[ Host, you want to try adding a Subclass to Ashe’s main profession? ]

‘Yes,’ William replied. ‘Can you test if it’s possible?’

[ Understood. ]

[ Connecting to the Familia Database… ]

[ Activating the Divinity of the King’s Chess Piece and CPU Core… ]

[ Connection established! ]

[ Subclass Integration Commencing… ]

-

William waited patiently for the System to finish tweaking the Familia Settings using the power of the two divinities. He wanted to know if it was possible to bestow a Job Class that he currently possessed to Ashe to allow her to wield its power.

According to Issei’s theory, if this experiment succeeded, the Mermaid would be able to help William increase the levels of his other professions, while that class was equipped to her.

Not only would William be able to increase its levels, but Ashe would also benefit from it because she would be able to wield the power of whatever profession William wanted to bestow upon her.

It didn’t take long before William heard the familiar notification sounds of the System, announcing the result of their experiment.

-

[ Ding! ]

[ Subclass Integration has been successfully added to the Familia Settings! ]

[ Host may now add any Job Class to his Familia Member and allow them to use its power. ]

[ Would you like to add a subclass to Ashera Dy Cordelia ( Yes / No ) ]

-

William laughed internally as he planted a kiss on the sleeping mermaid’s head. Ashe didn’t react because she was a very deep sleeper. She was not aware that her lover was doing something behind her back that would benefit her in the future.

William looked at the Job Classes that were currently available to him with a serious expression. He wanted to give Ashe a compatible Job Class that would work well with her Spirit Fencer Job Class.

This way, not only would it strengthen his mermaid lover, he would also be able to increase the level of a Job Class that he was not currently using.

After careful consideration, William decided to give Ashe the Job Class Geomancer. However, he still hadn’t met the requirements for this profession.

The Geomancer profession required the Fighter Job Class and Earth Mage Job Class at their max level.

Currently, William’s Fighter Job Class was only at Level 30. He wasn’t able to upgrade this Job Class to its maximum potential because he didn’t have much time to train it before leaving Lont.

‘System, set Fighter as Ashe’s Subclass and split the Experience Point allocation to fifty-fifty.’

[ Understood! ]

[ Subclass integration successful! ]

-

Name: Ashera Dy Cordelia

Race: Half-Nymph

Age: 16

Job Class: Spirit Fencer (Level 32)

Sub Class: Fighter (Level 30)

-

William nodded his head in appreciation. This way, Ashe would be able to increase the level of her Main Class, alongside her new Subclass.

Due to their experiment, Ashe had also gained the ability to gain Experience Points as a means to increase her rank faster.

Usually, people in the World of Hestia became stronger through real life battles, and the use of Beast Cores, Magic Crystals, and Spirit Stones, to increase their ranks.

William felt sad because the only one that could benefit from the Familia Setting was Ashe. Because of the Bond that they shared with each other, the mermaid was recognized by the King Chesspiece as William’s Familia Member.

William’s only regret was that he had to wait until he came of age before he could add Wendy, and Est to his Familia as well.

The requirements for the Familia Member were strict, so William was helpless against it. For now, he could only focus on increasing Ashe’s Job Levels, while giving resources to Wendy in order for her to increase her own profession, which was Magic Lancer.

As the Lamassu pulling William’s carriage headed towards the Northern Regions, Princess Sidonie and Morgana were also hard at work in the Kingdom of Freesia.

Now that she had arrived at the capital, the Kraetor Empire started to march West. Their target was to conquer the Anaesha Dynasty which was currently under the control of the part of Deus that belonged to Conner’s Faction.

The Myriad Ant Queen opened her eyes as her ant soldiers prepared to battle. Although she was once the protector of the Anaesha Dynasty, she didn’t bat an eye and rallied her army to answer her call.

Her Master, Princess Sidonie, had ordered her to send her troops in a pincer attack in order to take control of the capital.

This was the first battle where the Kraetor Empire and Princess Sidonie’s Ant Army had collaborated to gain control of one of the four Kingdoms that had once held total dominion over the Southern Continent.
