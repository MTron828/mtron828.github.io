Chapter 302: Lily’s Lollipop [Part 1]

“Times up.”

Issei’s voice reverberated within his Special Domain.

William who was resting his head on Ashe’s lap sighed because the time they spent together had finally come to an end.

“Wait for me, okay?” William said, while his hand reached out to caress the side of his lover’s beautiful face. “I’ll come as soon as I can.”

“Don’t make me wait for too long,” Ashe replied as she lightly pinched William’s cheeks. “Goodbye, Will.”

“See you soon, Ashe.”

Issei had already already informed both of them that they wouldn’t be able to see each other again until William’s training was completed. Because of this, the two didn’t train on the last day of their stay in Issei’s Special Domain. Instead, they spent their time locked in each other’s embrace, nourishing the budding feelings they had for each other.

Ashe turned into particles of light and flew towards the sky of the domain. It was now time for her to return to her own body, leaving her lover behind.

“Satisfied?” Issei asked as he appeared beside William with a mischievous smile.

William nodded his head and smiled. “Thank you, Big Brother.”

Isse chuckled and patted William’s shoulder. “You can thank me after you’ve come of age. By then, no one will be able to stop you from going to Third and Fourth base.”

William was about to protest that he had already gone past Third and Fourth base in his dreams, but that would only make him look pitiful in Issei’s eyes, so he decided to keep his mouth shut and just nod his head in agreement.

“Well then, time for you to start your training with Lily,” Issei said.

“Big Brother, what kind of ability does Lily’s Divinity have?” William inquired. “Is the Lollipop that powerful?”

Issei rubbed his chin as he pondered William’s question. Truth be told, he had no idea what Lily’s Divinity could do. Issei and Lily were both New Generation Gods, but their fields of expertise were different from each other.

Issei’s Divinity allowed William to control an entire army under his command.

As for Lily’s Divinity…

Issei shuddered when a sudden thought came to his mind. Even he, as the Harem God, had only thought of the little Loli Goddess as a support type Goddess. Someone who would stay at the back and cheer for everyone to do their best during times of need.

However, hidden underneath that cute and childish facade was a Goddess that had many followers under her wing. If Issei was to rate the powers of the Gods based on the number of believers they had, Lily’s powers would be in the middle tier of the pyramid.

“I’m not sure how strong Lily’s Divinity is,” Issei admitted. “However, it will be best if you don’t underestimate its potential. Remember, a Divinity is something that you can’t measure based on appearance. Although a Lollipop might not be as intimidating as a sword, its uses may surprise you when push comes to shove.”

William nodded his head in agreement. Issei’s Divinity had brought him a lot of benefits. It was quite unfortunate that he could only use 30% of its power right now.

Suddenly, a pink portal appeared in front of William.

“Big Brother, let’s go!” Lily popped out of the portal and grabbed William’s hand. “Your training begins now.”

The Loli Goddess winked at Issei before dragging William into her domain.

The Harem God only smiled and bid his goodbye to William who was now about to start another round of Divinity Training.

——

Lilly stood in front of a whiteboard, wearing glasses and holding a wooden stick in her hand. She was like a little girl doing her best to look like an adult professor, and failing miserably because of how adorable she was.

“Did you fall in love with me, Big Brother?” Lily adjusted the glasses on her face and gave William a serious stare.

“Maybe a little bit,” William replied with a smile.

Right now, he didn’t care whether the image that he had seen-using the glasses that Gavin had given him back then-was real or not. Lily had always been there to support him. Regardless of her true form, William decided to accept Lily as she was. These were his honest feelings and Lily could see it as well.

“Big Brother is getting good with words,” Lily smiled sweetly. “Are you planning to add Lily to your harem?”

“No,” William answered in a heartbeat. “Although Lily is good, I will have to pass. Brother Issei told me that an F.B.I God exists. I don’t want to go to Jail.”

“Jail is just another room, Big Brother,” Lily shook her head in disappointment. “You may have the money, wealth, and love of every person in your world, Big Brother, but, if you don’t have a Loli then your life will be incomplete.”

“No Loli, No Life!” Lily then gave William a thumbs up that made his liver itch.

William rested his chin on the palm of his hand as he grinned at the Loli Goddess that was coaxing him to commit a crime.

“I’ll only consider legal lolis,” William replied. “Like one of those hundred year old Vampires that never age.”

“Vampires are too mainstream, Big Brother,” Lily giggled. “Dwarves and Halflings are always an option. Also, they are very loyal creatures. So, please do consider them, alright?”

William could only shake his head helplessly as Lily cleared her throat to continue her explanation.

“Now, let’s have a serious talk about the Divinity that I gave you, Big Brother,” Lily said with a serious expression. “Tell me everything you know about My Divinity.”

William straightened his posture before he narrated the experiments that he had done in the past using the Lollipop inside his Sea of Consciousness.

Although he had the Appraisal Skill, the abilities of the Divinity was still a mystery to him.

“Right.” Lily nodded her head. “My Divinity doesn’t only work on girls, but boys as well. Age is also not a factor. Even adults can gain benefits from eating the Lollipops you create.”

Lily wrote a few things on the whiteboard in order to properly explain the effects of her Divinity.

“Big Brother, right now, the only Lollipop that you can create is the Pink Lollipop,” Lily explained while tapping the words ‘Pink Lollipop’ written on the whiteboard.

“What this Lollipop does is remove harmful status ailments from a person’s body. You can even say that it is an all purpose ‘cure’ for lesser maladies, spells, and poison. I don’t know if you were aware of this or not, but the pink Lollipop can also cure the common cold. This is, also, why Eve hasn’t ever gotten sick.”

William was pleasantly surprised by this discovery. He never thought that the Pink Lollipop that he had given to the kids in Lont had such an amazing ability.
