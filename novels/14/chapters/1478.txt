Chapter 1478  Sidonie After Story - I Still Wanted To Have Your Babies

"That's it! Perfect!" Sidonie said as she sat on the director's chair. "Okay, cut!"

Morgana and Elliot both stopped their acting, and allowed their assistants to give them some refreshments.

They were currently shooting the Elven War Arc, where Sidonie and William were inside the Ant Nest together. This scene was very memorable to the Sin of Lust because it was where she realized that the Half-Elf was more than what he seemed.

Of course, since they were in the Ant Nest, they also asked Kasogonaga to make an appearance.

The Rainbow-Colored Anteater was now an international star both in Hestia, Earth, and the Underworld.

His single, I Am Rolling!, had sold Trillions of copies worldwide, making him the one and only SSS-List celebrity in three realms.

Kasogonaga had done several world tours, dramas, movies, and was always a favorite star invited on the most popular T.V shows.

People of all ages, including children, loved him, making him a very versatile Superstar.

"It feels like yesterday when William and I went to the Ant Nest," Kasogonaga said softly as one of his assistants handed him a fruit juice. "It sure feels nice having this part added to the adaptation."

Sidonie, who had been promoted as the Adaptation's Director, nodded. "Of course, we are also using your popularity to get high ratings for the show," Sidonie smiled. "Since William agreed to this adaptation, it is only right to go all out to make it a success."

With nearly an unlimited budget at her disposal, Sidonie didn't hold back and made this Arc, where she and William would end up as lovers, the highlight of the show.

Even her other Half, Morgana, was doing her best to re-enact the scenes. However, she bribed Elliot into making their intimate moments look more romantic, which would definitely make their sisters vomit sugar after seeing it.

The Angelic Familiar had also gained a lot of fame as of late, as an Idol on Earth.

Not only was he extremely good looking, many young ladies wished that he would take a page from William and increase the number of wives he had.

Currently, Elliot only had two wives, and everytime someone asked him in an interview if he planned to add more, he would just say that his two wives were enough for him.

Even so, his fans were still hoping that he would reconsider and open up to the possibility of having more wives than the Half-Elf, who looked exactly like him.

After a short break, another scene was re-enacted and, this time, it was the scene where Sidonie died.

This part of the story was all part of Sidonie's plan in order to show the Half-Elf's true character.

Eneru, the Qilin, had been manipulated by the Goddess of Lust to kill William, only for her daughter to save him.

This was all part of their plan, giving the Half-Elf a choice whether to resurrect Princess Sidonie or not using the Torc that Cernunnos had bestowed upon him.

"I-It's a shame," Empress Sidonie said as blood seeped out of the corner of her lips. "I still… wanted to… have… your babies."

After saying those words, the Young Empress breathed her last breath and died with her eyes looking up at William. Those beautiful hazel eyes had completely lost their luster, and looked at the Half-Elf lifelessly.

The actor who played one of Sidonie's subordinates sighed as he stood beside William, who was holding the beautiful Princess in his arms

"I had a hunch when I first saw you in the Anaesha Dynasty, but now, I am sure of it." Evexius sighed. "Our Empress favors you, and even went as far as to drag our entire army into this war. It's quite regrettable that her feelings were one-sided."

William gently closed Empress Sidonie's eyes before removing the Torc that was wrapped around his arm. This was given to him by Cernunnos when he visited the Centaur Tribe back at the Whimsical Forest. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

"Your Excellency, please, bestow your mercy upon this lady," William said as he placed the golden Torc on Empress Sidonie's chest. "Look favorably upon her, this one time."

A few seconds later, Cernunnos voice reached William's ears.

"Are you sure?" Cernunnos asked. "This bracelet is supposed to save your life once. Do you really want to give this opportunity to another?"

"Yes," William replied. "Please, save her."

The golden torc glowed as Cernunnos granted William's request. "Fine. You Humans are truly fascinating creatures. It was entertaining to watch your struggles. May you not regret this decision in the future, Little Will."

————————————

The scene then changed where the newly resurrected Princess Sidonie stood up, while being supported by William in a loving embrace.

This wasn't what had happened in the original, but since Sidonie was the one pulling the strings, the actors obeyed her will.

Of course, Morgana and Elliot were more than happy to play along. They wanted to see William's reaction to this scene once the drama series had been aired. ————————————

"Stop the war," Empress Sidonie ordered. "Much blood has already been spilled. There's no need to add more."

Princess Sidonie then looked lovingly at the Half-Elf with a faint smile on her beautiful face.

"Back in the Aenasha Dynasty, one of the conditions that was written on the contract was for you to grant a request from me," Empress Sidonie said in a soft voice. Clearly, she had still not fully recovered and was still suffering from lethargy.

"I remember," William replied.

Sidonie had asked for William's slave collar to be transferred to her, and the Half-Elf agreed to her request.

The moment he placed his slave collar on her neck, was the moment he fell into the palm of Sidonie's hands.

There was an old tradition in the Kraetor Empire that if a member from the Royal Family were to willingly allow someone to put a slave collar on their necks, it would be the same as accepting their proposal for marriage.

William, who didn't know about this rule, suddenly found himself to be Princess Sidonie's fiance.

Of course, instead of making the Half-Elf look as if he had been scammed into signing a contract that he wasn't aware of, Elliot smiled gently and said some cheesy lines to Morgana, promising to love her with all of his heart for the rest of his life.

————————————

When William and his wives watched this scene, all of them glanced at the Half-Elf and asked him if everything was true.

However, Sidonie and Morgana were seated on William's left and right sides as they watched the adaptation together.

Both beautiful ladies were acting like spoiled kids, as they clung to their husband, making it hard for the Half-Elf to resist their charms.

"Well, it has been so long since the war," William said softly as Princess Sidonie and Morgana kissed his cheeks. "I can't really remember what happened back then because I wasn't in the right state of mind after killing so many people."

This answer made the two succubi very happy because their husband had turned a blind eye to the changes in the script.

Of course, William's other wives didn't really mind because they had already expected Sidonie to do something like this.

Since they weren't there when this scene happened, they decided to turn a blind eye to the two shameless ladies, who dragged William towards their bedroom.

Princess Sidonie and Morgana planned to give their handsome husband a reward, and get their reward in turn as well.

Just like the Princess had said in this episode, the two of them wanted to give birth to more of his babies.

Naturally, the Half-Elf was more than happy to give in to their request.

Princess Sidonie and Morgana already had a daughter each. However, a year after that episode, the two of them gave birth to another pair of daughters, which made their firstborns very happy because they now had two little sisters, whom they would love very much.
