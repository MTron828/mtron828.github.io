Chapter 562: Darling~ You Can Still Do It, Right?

A few more days passed inside Eternity.

William and Celine had made love with each other countless times. Everyday that passed, the fervor of their passion grew, as if they were making love with each other for the last time.

On their last night together, Celine took the initiative to pin William down and sat on top of him. This time, she would take the lead, and William didn’t resist. He allowed her to do what she pleased, for the time they would spend together was coming to an end.

That night, William poured his heart to her. He gave her everything, and she accepted them all.

After their intense love making, Celine laid on William’s chest, and the latter held her in a firm embrace.

“Master, I will be waiting for you,” William said softly. “When that time comes, let us sit down and talk about our relationship.”

“Okay,” Celine replied. Although it was only a word, it held a promise, and that was what William needed from her.

William sighed as he allowed himself to bask in Celine’s softness and warmth. He then closed his eyes to look at his status page that had been recently updated.

Celine had been registered as William’s Third Familia Member on their first night together.

This meant that Celine was now one of William’s women, but his Master didn’t confirm nor deny it. Her goal was to see her sister, before going to the Demonic Continent to check on her Master’s condition.

Until she had seen her Master, Celine had no time to entertain romance in her life. Also, she was also worried about the Elven Prophecy that would soon come to pass. Celine didn’t want William to be involved in her affairs, because this was her burden to deal with.

In time, the two fell asleep in each other’s embrace. William felt terribly good feeling Celine’s soft, warm, naked body nestled into his. This was the kind of intimacy that he didn’t expect to share with his Master, who had been with him for many years.

An intimacy that he would not feel again, until the two of them reunited.

They woke up around noon, and bathed together for the last time. After putting on their clothes, they walked out of Eternity side by side.

The artifact shrank in size and transformed into a necklace. Celine took it in her hand and wore it, like she always did.

“Will, make sure that you return from the 51st Floor,” Celine said as she squeezed his hand with her own. “Only by doing so will the two of us meet. The place you are going to is more dangerous than the Demonic Continent. Prioritize your safety, and Chiffon’s, at all times.”

“Yes, Master,” William replied. “I promise that I will return safely. So, make sure to be safe as well.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Celine smiled and nodded her head. She gave William one last kiss on the forehead before William sent her outside the Thousand Beast Domain.

The Half-Elf sighed and looked at the blue skies overhead. The two of them had already said their final goodbyes, and there was no use in prolonging the inevitable.

With a slightly heavy heart, William returned to the Villa where Chiffon was waiting for him.

When he arrived, Chiffon was already at the dining table eating pancakes. She was being served by Charmaine, and accompanied by B1, and B2, who were also eating pancakes beside her.

The Two Dumb Birds were quite fond of Chiffon and would often accompany her whenever she visited the Thousand Beast Domain and the Dungeon of Atlantis.

William was happy for her because she found friends that would accompany her and not make her lonely. His only concern was whether the vulgarities of the two birds would rub on the innocent girl.

“Good morning, Big Brother.” Chiffon’s face brightened as soon as she saw William. When she had woken up, he was not around, but she wasn’t worried.

William had already told her that he might appear a bit late due to his training session with Celine.

“Good Morning, Chiffon,” William replied as he sat on the chair beside her. He had already eaten breakfast with Celine, so he wasn’t feeling hungry.

“Happy Birthday, Big Brother,” Chiffon said.

“Thank you.”

“Here is my gift to you.”

Chiffon stood up from her chair and gave the Half-Elf a chocolate lollipop. The corner of William’s lips twitched because he didn’t know whether he should laugh, or cry at the gift that the little girl was giving him.

In the end, he thanked Chiffon and unwrapped the lollipop before putting it inside his mouth. It had been a while since he had eaten one, and it gave him a very nostalgic feeling.

Its taste reminded him of his battle against the Celestial Army that was guarding the Heavenly Gate.

‘Zhu and Sha might have been born by now,’ William thought as he remembered the two Demons that had helped him during the trial. ‘I hope that both of them will find happiness in their new life.’

Seeing that William seemed to be enjoying the gift she gave him, the corner of Chiffon’s lips raised a bit before returning her attention to the pancakes in front of her.

She had developed a habit of not wasting any food that was served to her. Chiffon carried the Sin of Gluttony. She knew more than anyone else in the world how it felt to be hungry and had nothing to eat.

While the two were spending some quality time together, two unexpected guests appeared inside the Villa.

Ian and Princess Sidonie walked in wearing their uniforms and they both made a beeline to William.

“Happy Birthday, Will.”

“Happy Birthday, Darling!”

“Thank you.”

Morgana was currently the one in charge of Princess Sidonie’s body because her other half was still asleep. She had discussed a lot of things with Ashe till late in the night on how they would spend their night with William.

This was the day that they had been waiting for and the ever naughty Morgana had reached her limits.

“Darling, tonight, prepare yourself,” Morgana whispered in William’s ears. “Wait, I smell something funny.”

Morgana wrinkled her nose as he sniffed around her. As the embodiment of Lust, it was very easy for her to identify the scent of lovemaking.

It was at that moment when the lollipop fell out of William’s mouth because he had forgotten his lover’s special ability.

“Darling~ did you by chance spend the night with a woman?” Morgana’s sweet and devilish voice tickled William’s ears. “Did you cheat on us?”

William lightly cleared his throat and decided to ride the tiger’s back. This was the point of no return, so he decided to come clean and put all the blame on Celine!

After hearing William’s story, Ian and Morgana glanced at each other. They had long known that Celine was William’s Master, so they knew that he wasn’t lying. Also, Chiffon was there to serve as witness.

In the end, Ian and Morgana could only sigh because the early bird had eaten William’s worm. Their only concern was whether the Half-Elf could still do his duty as their lover after their class was over in the afternoon.

“Darling~ you can still do it, right?” Morgana pressed her arms over William’s shoulders. “You left something for us, right?”

William gulped because right now, he had no more juice to spare because Celine had made sure to take everything for herself.

‘S-System, look for the most powerful rejuvenation potion that you can find,’ William ordered. ‘It doesn’t matter how much it is. As long as it brings my body to peak condition, anything is fine!’

[ …Understood. ]

Chiffon, who was still eating her pancake, looked at this scene in confusion. She was wondering what Morgana and Ian were talking about as they looked down at William with dissatisfied looks on their faces.

Fortunately, William was able to buy a powerful rejuvenation potion from the God Shop which helped him with his predicament.

That night, he was sandwiched between two beauties, who were very eager to share their first times with him, not in a Dreamworld, but in the real world, where their love for each other blazed brightly amidst the darkness.
