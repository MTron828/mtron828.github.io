Aside from Eldon and his wife, the Ministers inside the throne room thought that the Half-Elf was crazy.

First he talked about Giants invading their world, and a moment later, he talked about Gods of Destruction who were hell-bent to end all of their lives.

Then, he started to talk about something that they could relate to, but still not believe, which was subjugating the four Demigods of the Western Continent.

For them, the Demigods were Gods. 

They were beings that could make the King's of the Gunnar Federation bow their heads, and anyone who sat in a seat of power would take their words seriously.

"Do you need any help in tracking down these Demigods?" Eldon asked as he patted Maple's head, who was seated on his lap. "I can introduce a guide to you that knows the general location of their territories."

"That will be extremely helpful," William replied. "I'll gladly accept your offer."

Eldon nodded. "Good. Then it's settled then. Should we all have lunch?" 

Just as William was about to reply, one of King Eldon's Minister's spoke up. 

"Wait! Please wait, Your Majesty!" the minister shouted. "Please, tell me that you are not going to believe this nonsense! If we anger the Demigods, they will certainly retaliate. Even if we are confident in our Kingdom's defenses, I am afraid that we will not be able to survive if we are to antagonize them."

"I understand your concern, Durren," Eldon said as he addressed the Minister that had spoken up. "But, you're making a big deal out of this. Aren't they just Demigods? William can easily handle them."

Durren almost spat out blood after hearing his King's casual words.

Aren't they just Demigods?

Those were the casual words that their King had said just a moment ago.

It was similar to the saying.

"Aren't they just ants? If they bother you too much then just step on them. Problem solved!"

The Ministers inside the throne room felt cold sweat starting to form on their foreheads because their King seemed to have been infected by the "crazy disease" that the Half-Elf had brought with him when he entered their Kingdom.

"My King, please reconsider," Durren insisted. "Why must we listen to the wild ravings of this Half-Elf that came from the Central Continent?"

"Ah. So this is your primary concern." Eldon nodded as if he had finally understood something. "First off, he is not just an ordinary Half-Elf that came from the Central Continent. This person is the husband of my granddaughter, Chiffon. He is family, so he can be trusted."

Durren frowned after he heard Eldon's reply. "Husband of your granddaughter?"

The Minister was April's Godfather, and he had doted upon the pink-haired Dwarf before she went to the Central Continent to go on an expedition.

When he saw the two girls that were currently seated on the King's and Queen's lap, a suspicion had already formed inside his mind, but since there was no confirmation, he just kept this matter to the side, while listening to the Half-Elf's words. 

"Then, where is she?" Durren asked after organizing his thoughts. "Since she is the King's granddaughter, why isn't she here to pay respect to her grandparents? If he really is her husband then she should be here with him, no?"

Eldon, and his wife, Eloise, had wanted to ask William this question earlier. However, since the Half-Elf wanted to talk about the Giants, they decided to ask this question in private after they had their lunch.

"This is our family matter," William replied. "I'd appreciate it if you don't intrude on our privacy."

Durren snorted, but he no longer insisted on the matter because he saw that his King was looking at him as if he didn't want this discussion to continue. Since that was the case, he didn't pry further and simply asked another question.

"You talked as if Demigods are not a big deal," Durren stated. "But, do you know the consequences that come if you anger them? Our entire Kingdom will be destroyed because of your craziness!"

The other Ministers nodded their heads because they couldn't allow their King to make a decision that would jeopardize the peace and stability that they had built for hundreds of years.

The Dwarves had a neutral policy. Meaning, they would not take the initiative to antagonize their neighbors, or start conflicts. 

Simply put, they would not start a war they couldn't win.

They could definitely fight against Myriad Beasts, but Demigods were something that they didn't want to touch, even with a 12-foot pole.

"Astrape, show them your strength," William ordered. "Just make sure to hold back, okay?"

The Half-Elf knew that the only way to convince the Dwarves was to show them that he wasn't just all talk. If he could make them understand that he could easily deal with the Demigods, whom they treated as the Apex beings of the Western Continent, all future problems would be resolved. 

"Understood, Master," Astrape grinned evilly because she had been doing her best to not slap the Minister silly for getting in the way of her Master's mission.

Astrape slowly unleashed her presence little by little.

At first, the ministers were still calm as they looked at the beautiful lady who seemed to be one of the Half-Elf's subordinates. 

However, their calm disappeared, and was soon replaced with disbelief, followed by horror.

"By the Earth Goddess…," Durren muttered. "D-Demigod!"

Astrape snorted after hearing Durren's words. 

​ "Demigod?" Astrape sneered. "Don't lump me with those small fries."

As if she was offended by Durren's words, she once again increased the power she was radiating, making all the Dwarves inside the throne room, with the exception of Eldon, and Eloise, fall on their knees, as they gasped for breath. 

"That's enough, Astrape," William said. "I'm sure they understand how strong you are now."Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Astrape stopped exerting pressure on the Dwarves, allowing them to take a breather.

"I'm sure that what I said earlier is unbelievable," William stated as he scanned the faces of the Dwarves, who were looking back at him with wariness. "If I were in your shoes, I would have been of the same opinion. However, that will not change the fact that there are indeed beings that far surpass the established norm of this world.

"When I was younger, I also thought that Demigods were the peak existences of this world. Unfortunately, they are not. Since that is the case, we need to live with the reality of knowing that the previous beliefs we held were incorrect. However, I assure you that what I told all of you earlier is the truth and nothing but the truth."

William paused as if to allow the Dwarves time to digest the words that he had just said. 

"Two years from now, we will have to deal with beings far stronger than them," William added. "I hope when that time comes, all of you will be ready to stand your ground, or else everything you hold dear in this world, will be taken away from you."

Durren, who thought that everything Wiliam said earlier was just a crazy story, started to feel afraid. 

If what the Half-Elf really said was true then how could they possibly survive such a calamity?

It was not only him that thought this way, but the rest of the Dwarves in the throne room. 

Now that the reality that there were beings stronger than Demigods had appeared before them, they had no choice but to take the Half-Elf's words seriously, making them feel that the future before them wasn't as bright as they imagined it would be.
