Chapter 767 - William’s Choice

William lowered his head when he heard Zenon's question.

The God of Familiars gave the Half-Elf a knowing smile because he knew that the answer to this question wouldn't be an easy one. In order to not make things difficult for William, he decided to throw in a lifeline to make his choice easier.

"There is no right or wrong answer to this question," Zenon said. "Just tell me what you think, and also, please, give me the reason why you chose that answer."

Actually, the reason why William frowned was not because he couldn't choose from the two. He just remembered a few things that made him sad, so he decided to lower his head to hide the expression on his face.

"Your Excellency, I know what it feels like to lose someone dear to you," William replied as he raised his head. "I also experienced the hopelessness of seeing my homeland be destroyed even after giving it everything that I had to protect it." Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Half-Elf paused as he stared straight at the God of Familiars. He wanted Zenon to understand that when it came to these two things, he would choose neither of them.

"Your Excellency, I am a greedy person," William stated. "Regardless of the cost, regardless of what happens, I will hold both my loved one and the world in the palms of my hands. I will save them both."

"In order to save both, you need strength. The way you are now, I'm afraid that you don't have the qualifications to be greedy."

"Even so, my answer will still be the same. I will save both."

Zenon narrowed his eyes as he met William's gaze. The standoff lasted for half a minute before the God of Familiars chuckled.

"Well, since that is your answer then so be it," Zenon said. "Now, time for you to take that step and become a Progenitor of the Familiamancer Profession.

Zenon raised his hand and the vial that contained the Dungeon Core Essence floated in the air. Elliot's and Conan's body glowed as the essence stored inside the vial merged with their bodies.

The Angelic Familiar and the Devil Familiar were wrapped in golden cocoons that glowed brightly.

Suddenly, a beam of light from both Familiars shot towards the gem in William's chest. The Half-Elf felt an overwhelming surge of magical energy that flowed through his entire body.

< Ding! >

< Requirements for Ascension have been met! >

< Upgrading Job Class… >

< 5%... >

< 25%… >

William waited patiently until the upgrade of the Job Class was completed. When the completion rate had reached 100%

The Half-Elf heard a cracking sound from the two golden cocoons inside of him. The golden cocoons shattered like a broken glass, revealing the two familiars within.

An angel, the size of an adult's hands floated with his eyes closed. He was still wearing the same clothes that he had before, and nothing changed much on Elliot's appearance. The only noticeable change was his wings.

Instead of two pairs of wings, now he had four.

Conan was the same. In the past, he had a pair of batlike wings, but now he had four of them. A few seconds later, both familiars opened their eyes and the power of Millennial Beasts surged from within their bodies.

"Congratulations," Zenon said with a smile. "You are now a Progenitor of the Familiamancer Profession, just like Celeste. I hope that you will do your best to spread the wonders of the Familiamancers to the entire world of Hestia."

Just as soon as Zenon finished his congratulations, a series of notifications appeared on William's status page.

William was quite happy with the additional bonus in stats. He had clearly felt an overall increase in his strength after equipping the Familiamancer Sovereign Job Class.

The one thing that piqued his curiosity was the Familiamancer Perfect Fusion. He had experienced what it was like to fuse with his wives, but he had never tried fusing with his familiars.

He was curious on how powerful his Familiars would be if they fused with him.

While he was deep in thought, Zenon's words reached his ears.

"It's time for you to go back," Zenon said. "Make sure to take care of Celeste in the future."

The corners of Zenon's lips rose as he waved his hand to send William back to the Temple.

The Half-Elf and the two familiars were enveloped in a golden light before disappearing from his Domain.

"You want to save both?" Zenon placed his hands behind his back as he looked down from the top of the Tower of Babylon. "That will be difficult, William. But, it's not impossible.. I look forward to seeing you try."
