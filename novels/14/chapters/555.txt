Chapter 555: Let’s Talk About You And Her Wedding

When Chiffon opened her eyes, she found herself in an unfamiliar room.

Fortunately, there was someone familiar to her inside the room, and it put her heart at ease.

William was sitting at the side of the bed and holding her hand. The moment their eyes met, Chiffon had the strong urge to run away. If not for the fact that she still couldn’t move her body, she might have already bolted out of the room in haste.

“How are you feeling?” William asked with a smile.

“Exhausted,” Chiffon answered. “But, aside from that, I’m good.”

William nodded his head as he asked the System to run a diagnostic scan on Chiffon’s body to ensure that nothing was wrong with her.

[ Chiffon’s vital signs are all normal. The possibility of a relapse is .001% ]

‘Thank you, System.’

Chiffon couldn’t remember much of what happened to her. There were lapses in her memory, and she wasn’t sure if what she saw was real or only a dream.

The last thing she remembered was being enclosed in William’s embrace, and hearing his promise to not leave her alone.

The two stared at each other for a full minute without saying a word. The awkward silence was unnerving, and it made Chiffon anxious. She was about to say something when suddenly, a growling sound reverberated inside the room.

Chiffon’s body stiffened because she thought that it was her stomach that was making a sound. She had just eaten an entire dungeon floor, so her hunger would be sated for at least two days.

“That was my stomach,” William said to assure the panicking girl on the bed. For some reason, seeing Chiffon’s flustered expression tickled his heart.

William took out a basket of sandwiches from his storage ring, and offered one of them to Chiffon. The little girl shook her head, and politely declined the sandwich.

The Half-Elf didn’t insist because food was a sensitive topic right now. He just ate in silence, using his right hand, while his left hand held the pink-haired girl’s hand.

After eating his fill, William returned the basket to his storage ring, and laid down beside Chiffon.

“Goodnight.” William yawned as he closed his eyes to sleep.

He had been up for nearly two days, and he was already very sleepy. He hadn’t eaten anything, and only drank water during his vigil. For some reason, he didn’t have any appetite after seeing Chiffon’s berserked state.

Two minutes later, William’s deep sleeping breaths reached Chiffon’s ears. The little glutton stared at his peaceful sleeping face, as if embedding it in her memory. She had wanted to ask William a few things, but the latter had slept before she could even ask anything.

Chiffon sighed as she tried to move her body towards William. Although her body felt heavy, the need to feel someone’s warmth fueled her determination. More than anything else, she hated being alone.

Now that someone was sleeping next to her, she decided to move closer to assure herself that what she was seeing was reality and not a dream.

“Wake up, Mr. Lollipop.”

A teasing voice reached William’s ears, which made him open his eyes abruptly.

The first thing she saw was a lady.

A very fat lady.

She was sitting on a small chair that creaked every time her body moved slightly. William couldn’t help but think that the chair would break at any time, which would make the lady fall on the ground, unable to get up due to her body size.

“You’re thinking a very rude thing,” the fat lady snorted. “Don’t you know that girls are very delicate? You already have three lovers and you still don’t understand this fact?”

The fat lady opened a red fan and started fanning herself. Her action made the chair she was sitting on creak dangerously, which made William’s teeth itch.

The Half-Elf forcefully tore his attention from the chair and looked at the lady in front of him. Since he had been around the company of Gods during his visit to the temple, it was easy for him to identify the fat lady as a Goddess.

The only question was.

Who was she?

“You really are too skinny,” the fat lady commented as he eyed William from head to foot. “I suggest that you add at least 170 lbs to your weight.”

The corner of William’s lips twitched when he heard the comment of the Goddess.

“I’ll take that into consideration, Your Excellency,” William said as he gave the lady before her a respectful bow. “My name is William. May I know, Her Excellency’s, exalted name?”

The fat lady chuckled, matching the creaking of the chair where she sat. “It has been a while since I introduced myself to a mortal, so forgive me for not introducing myself first. My name is Adephagia, and I am the Goddess of Gluttony.”

William felt the last piece of the puzzle fall in place as he heard the name of the Goddess in front of him. The Half-Elf decided to remain silent and wait for Adephagia to tell him the reason why she had brought him to the Boundary of Heaven and Earth.

He had been here not long ago when he met with Aamon, Astrid’s twin that had given him an unreasonable quest from the get go.

The Goddess smiled and nodded her head in appreciation. She had already read what William was currently thinking, so she decided to get straight to the point.

“First of all, I would like to thank you for taking care of my daughter,” Adephagia said softly. “My daughter has been through many tough times, and although her fate is filled with suffering, as her mother, I can’t help but weep for her.”

(A/N: All the Gods of the Seven Deadly Sins call their personifications in the mortal realm daughters. Yeah, all of them are born as girls. I’m just going to clarify things in case you guys are thinking of something else.)

Adephagia started to dab her eyes with a handkerchief as if to wipe away the invisible tears that weren’t there.

William played along and nodded his head in understanding.

“Chiffon is like a little sister to me,” William stated. “It breaks my heart to see her hurting.”

“I see!” Adephagia grinned. “Now, let’s talk about you and her wedding.”

“Um? What wedding?”

“Sorry, I stuttered. I meant to say let’s talk about you and her well being. Don’t you know? Having a healthy body and mind will lead you to greatness.”

The Goddess laughed with “Ohohoho!” like a second rate villainess, which made William worry about the future. Lady Eros had asked him to take care of her daughters, while she was training him in her palace.

The Goddess of Lust didn’t imply anything aside from taking care of her daughters, but the end result was having Princess Sidonie and Morgana as his lover.

Seeing that the Goddess of Gluttony had appeared in front of him. William had a nagging feeling that he was about to become the groom in a Shotgun Wedding.

“Oi, don’t think too highly of yourself,” Adephagia closed her fan and pointed it in William’s direction. “You’re too skinny for my lovely daughter. I will only allow you to become her lover if you increase your weight by 180 lbs.”

William felt that he was about to have a migraine. Earlier the Goddess mentioned that he needed to add 170 lbs to his weight, now she changed it to 180 lbs. He had a feeling that the Goddess of Gluttony would continue to increase his weight as they continued their chat. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Where was I? Oh yeah, let’s talk about you and her wedding.”

“Well-being.”

“Tsk.” Adephagia clicked her tongue before opening her fan to cover half of her face. “You are going to the Tower of Babel, right?”

William nodded his head in affirmation. “Yes.”

“Very well, allow me to give you a gift.” The Goddess of Gluttony threw two small boxes in William’s direction, and the latter caught it by reflex.

“The red box is for Chiffon, and the pink one is for you,” Adephagia stated. “You don’t need to know what is inside the box because you wouldn’t be able to open it even if you used all of your strength.

“Just know that the box will open at the right time. Hold on to them for now, and keep them safe. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Your Excellency,” William replied.

“Good. Now go back.” Adephagia made a gesture to shoo William away. “Make sure to take care of my daughter. If you don’t, I’ll sit on your head. Let’s see if you can bully her again after that.”

Even in his spirit form, William could feel beads of sweat forming on his head. If the Fat Goddess really sat on his head, it would easily be crushed like a watermelon getting run over by a tank.
