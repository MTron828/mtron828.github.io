Chapter 483: All Is Fair In Love And Lust

Two days after the Elven Army arrived at Azure Fortress, Elandorr gave the order to advance towards the capital of the Hellan Kingdom. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The news of Eneru being injured didn’t deter the Elven Army from continuing their march. Regardless of whatever vile tactics that the Humans had used to injure their Guardian, The Young Elven Commander, the Patriarch’s of the Clan, as well as the High-Ranking Officers of the Elves, knew that there was no stopping the gears of war that had started to turn.

Calum looked through his telescope and observed the countless Elves from afar. A few days ago, William’s informant had sent a message to Brendan, which had been passed over to Conner. According to the letter, the Elves numbered over five million.

That was already a twelfth of the overall population of the Elves that lived in the Silvermoon Continent. Unlike the Human race that numbered in the billions, Elves were a race that didn’t give birth easily.

Aside from the teenage Elves that were of the Platinum Rank, the required rank to become a soldier of the Elven Army was that of the Mithril Rank.

(A/N: Platinum Ranks are equivalent to Class B Beasts, while Mithril Rank is Equivalent to Class A Beasts.)

This was an army that had surpassed Human standards. It was more than enough to conquer a Human Kingdom, defended by children, and a few thousand members of The Organization.

Hundreds of Giant Eagles, that were more than five meters tall and had a wingspan of over twenty meters, soared in the sky. They were the Aerial Cavalry of the Elves and all of them were Class B Beasts.

These Beasts had been summoned by their Riders from the Silvermoon Continent to participate in this war. They were notorious for being on par with Gryphons in one-on-one combat, and were known to take down Wyverns as a group.

On land, the Elves rode on Forest wolves that were two-meters tall. They were Class C Beasts and were very agile in their own right. They were sought after not because of their speed, but for their endurance. Also, they had the natural ability for tactical combat when they attacked in packs.

Over a thousand Ash Golems that were born from the ashes of the survivors from the Zelan Dynasty advanced steadily under the command of the Branch Leader of Deus in the Silvermoon Continent, Alessio.

These three-meter-tall Ash Golems would serve as the cannon fodders of their army in their battle against the Hellannians.

Elandorr and the Patriarch’s of the different clans sat in armored carriages that were being pulled by Dire Bears.

Princess Eowyn’s carriage was at the rear of the Elven Army protected by six Silver-Haired Unicorns.

When the Elven reinforcements arrived, several royal guards from the Elven Palace also came to serve as the Princess’ bodyguards. Among them were the Six Unicorns that lived in the lands that were the personal property of the Elven Royal Family.

These Silver-Haired Unicorns were of the Centennial Rank. Only members of the Royal Family had the privilege of being protected by these noble beasts.

Of course, since Ezkalor and Eneru were part of the Army, Dozens of Qilins and Dragons had also arrived from the Silver Continent to participate in this war. These powerful Beasts were of the Millennial Rank.

This was why Elandorr was confident that even though one of their Guardians had been injured, it would not change the outcome of the war.

With such a powerful army at his disposal, Elandorr believed that only the Kraetor Empire was their match.

Calum eyed the Elven Army for a few more minutes before retreating from his location. He knew that if he stayed any longer, the scouts of the Elves would find him. The war hasn’t started yet and he couldn’t afford to be captured at this point in time.

After a brief flash of light, Calum re-appeared at the plaza of the City of Gladiolus. He immediately rushed towards the palace where Conner and the other officers of Deus were waiting for him.

According to his estimate, it would only take the elves a week before their armies could be seen from the top of the walls of Gladiolus. Instead of feeling anxious, the Second in Command of Deus had a calm expression on his face.

Just like Conner, he believed that they could still win this war if things went according to their plan. Although the Elven Army was strong, and had the advantage in numbers, the members of Deus were no pushovers.

“What a grand sight,” Evexius said in admiration. “I’ve never seen this many Elves before.”

The Grand Archmage of the Kraetor Empire was holding a crystal ball in his hand, as the Army of the Kraetor Empire continued their march. According to his estimate, their own army would arrive at their destination two days earlier than the Elves.

Just like their agreement, the Kraetor Empire wouldn’t participate in the war. They would only be there to spectate, and watch who would emerge as the victors between the two parties. Naturally, Evexius was leaning towards the side of the Elves.

He didn’t believe that a ragtag group of children and outlaws would be enough to defend a city against millions of Elven Warriors.

Empress Sidonie was currently resting on her own carriage, and had given an explicit order not to disturb her at all cost.

Because of this, Evexius and Prince Jason took charge of the Army as their Young Empress got her beauty rest.

“Sir, are we really just going to spectate?” Prince Jason asked.

Although he was the commander of the Kraetor Army on paper, the Grand Archmage was the right hand of the Emperor of the Kraetor Empire.

He didn’t dare to act superior in front of this man who had ensured that their Empire would remain as one of the strongest factions in the Central Continent.

“That will depend on our Empress,” Evexius replied. “If she orders us to spectate then we can only watch from the sidelines. However, if she orders us to charge then you and your men should better be ready to execute her order before she changes her mind. Do I make myself clear?”

A smile appeared on Prince Jason’s lips. He had courted many beautiful women in their Empire and one of the things he had learned about them was their fickleness. Even if their lips say no, their body says yes.

Inside a spacious room, a sensuous lady sat on a couch. Her slender and delicate hands were brushing the hair of two beautiful girls that were resting their heads on her lap.

“I have prepared gifts for the two of you. I will also tell you later the function of the special enchantments inscribed to them,” the Sensuous Lady said affectionately. “Make sure to wear them at all times. Do the both of you understand?”

“”Yes, Lady Eros,”” Empress Sidonie and Morgana said in unison.

“You are quite daring, Sidonie,” Lady Eros said with a smile. “Well, you will need this kind of boldness if you want to profit from this war. Use the second gift that I have given you wisely. If used at the right moment, its effect will have a more dramatic result.”

Sidonie nodded obediently and allowed the Goddess of Lust to play with her ears.

The Goddess of Lust giggled as she pinched the beautiful lady’s ear because the grand plan that the young Empress had envisioned was truly unexpected.

“I helped her, too,” Morgana protested. She felt left out because Lady Eros was only spoiling Sidonie.

Lady Eros chuckled as she patted the other beauty who was looking at her with a face filled with injustice.

“You did well, Morgana,” Lady Eros praised. “As long as the two of you are together, all the men in the world will kneel and grovel at your feet.”

“Except for one,” Morgana corrected.

“Yes,” Sidonie agreed. “However, I prefer that our charm doesn’t work on him. With this, I found someone that can come to love me, not because of my charm, but because of who I am.”

The corner of Lady Eros’ lips curled up in a smile. The Goddess of Lust was very tempted to tell her beloved daughters that she was the one that trained William to resist their charms. If she hadn’t done so, the Half-Elf would have long submitted to them, and would gladly allow himself to be tied up on Sidonie’s and Morgana’s bed.

“All is fair in Love and Lust,” Lady Eros said with a mischievous smile. “The boy you chose is a very sentimental person. As long as you manage to worm yourselves in his heart, he will go to hell and back to protect the two of you from harm.”

Sidonie and Morgana glanced at each other. Although what they planned was a little underhanded, it was something that needed to be done.

Even so, they were still worried that not everything would go their way.

Lady Eros sensed their anxiousness, but there was nothing she could do, except give them words of encouragement. She had already given them her gifts to be used at their discretion.

Even a Goddess like her wouldn’t be able to predict how this war would play out. Only the Fates who weaved the destiny of mortals could catch a glimpse of its outcome.
