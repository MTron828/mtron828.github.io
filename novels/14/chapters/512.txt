Chapter 512: When The Past No Longer illuminates The Future, The Spirit Walks In Darkness [Part 2]

In the depths of Hell, several warriors ran in an orderly fashion. These were the members of the Celestial Army that had failed to prevent William from entering the Heavenly Gate.

The Jade Emperor was lenient with his punishment and only asked them to train in hell for two years before returning to their duties.

Zhu, and Sha, who had helped in William’s endeavor had also been thrown into hell as well as punishment for their actions.

The Pig Demon and Sand Demon were enjoying a rare opportunity to drink wine together when one of the personal aids of the Jade Emperor appeared beside them.

“Zhu and Sha, the Jade Emperor has issued a decree,” the aid said crispily.

Zhu and Sha immediately knelt on the ground to listen to the decree that was given by the Lord that they had served for thousands of years.

“Starting today, the two of you are hereby given an official pardon,” the aid announced. “You are also given the chance to enter the Cycle of Reincarnation to start your new lives. The Jade Emperor also promised that after a thousand years, he will once again give both of you a chance to serve under him after you have lived your lives to the fullest.”

Zhu and Sha glanced at each other in disbelief. They had already resigned themselves to stay in hell for eternity, and yet, a miracle had happened out of the blue.

“Sha, am I dreaming?” Zhu asked.

Instead of answering, Sha slapped Zhu hard on the face.

The Pig Demon howled in pain as he caressed the side of its swollen face. “Oink! I just asked you if I was dreaming. Why did you slap me?”

“Did it hurt?”

“Duh! Of course it hurt! Oink!”

“Then it’s not a dream.” Sha chuckled. “It’s not a dream! We’re free! The Jade Emperor has forgiven us!”

The Sand Demon laughed wholeheartedly as tears streamed down the side of his face. A moment later, Zhu joined his friend as they both laughed and cried at the same time. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The aid looked at the two with a smile. Secretly, he was there when the two demonic beasts helped William fight against the Celestial Army, and even envied them a bit because they had fought for what they believed in even though the odds were stacked against them.

A few minutes later, the two had calmed down and shifted their attention to the aid that was waiting patiently at the side.

“So, are the two of you ready to reincarnate?” the aid asked.

Zhu and Sha glanced at each other before giving their answer.

“Is it possible to see the Jade Emperor once?” Sha asked.

Zhu stared at the aid in bated breath as he waited for the man’s answer.

“The Jade Emperor had given me two orders,” the aid answered. “The first one is to accompany the two of you to the Cycle of Reincarnation. The second one is to accompany both of you to meet with him in the Jade Palace if you wish to seek an audience.”

The aid then waved his hand and a Majestic Chariot descended from the sky.

“Come,” the aid made a gesture. “The Jade Emperor is waiting for both of you at the Jade Palace.”

William walked with steady steps as he left the Jade Palace. The first thing he did after getting his God Points was to negotiate with the Jade Emperor for Zhu’s and Sha’s freedom.

At first the Jade Emperor played hard to get, but in the end, he relented.

However, the price for Zhu’s and Sha’s freedom was steep.

Twenty four million God Points.

That was the price that the Jade Emperor had given William. He thought that the amount would make the boy back down, but to the Jade Emperor’s surprise, the latter agreed and didn’t even bother to bargain with him.

The Jade Emperor watched the red-headed boy from afar until William disappeared from sight. He recalled the conversation that the two of them had half an hour ago, and sighed.

“Perhaps this is Fate,” the Jade Emperor muttered. “This is their Karma.”

After William paid the Jade Emperor the amount for Zhu’s and Sha’s freedom, the ruler of the Jade Palace asked the Half-Elf why he was going this far for two criminals.

William’s answer made the Jade Emperor realize that the boy was someone who knew how to repay the debt he owed to other people.

“True friends will always find a way to help you,’ William answered. “Fake friends will always find an excuse. Zhu and Sha had done me a favor that no amount of God Points could ever repay. I have always wanted to set the two of them free, because I know that both of them were good people.”

William placed his closed fist over his chest and bowed at the Jade Emperor.

“Please, Your Majesty, give them their freedom. Allow them to reincarnate and shower them with your blessings. They have already atoned for their sins. It is time for them to return to the Cycle of Reincarnation.”

After hearing William’s reply, the Jade Emperor immediately wrote a decree and gave it to his Personal Aid. He also ordered him to carry out his order at once.

As soon as the Emperor’s Personal Aid left, the red-headed boy also left the palace.

There were still things that he needed to do in Hestia, and the aftermath of the war was still being dealt with.

The Elves that had surrendered were now stationed inside the City of Gladiolus. William had tasked them to help with the repairs of the City Walls, as well as the buildings and houses that they had destroyed during the war.

The majority of the Kraetor Army had returned to the Anaesha Dynasty, with the exception of Empress Sidonie, Evexius, Prince Jason, the Protectors of the Kraetor Empire, and a hundred thousand elite soldiers.

The reason for their stay was to help William draft certain rules that would be implemented for the entire continent as they waited for the effects of the Continental Spell to end.

Takam had told William that it could end anywhere between one to two years, so it would still take some time before things returned to normal.

For someone as lazy as William, dealing with this was a pain. However, he didn’t have a choice because he was the nominated leader of the Hellan Kingdom. He wasn’t allowed to shirk his responsibilities this time.

Somewhere in the Temple of the Ten Thousand Gods…

Sepheron, the Demigod of the Silvermoon Continent, shrieked in fear, and desperation, as an otherworldly beauty approached it with a smile.

“Worry not, I will not hurt you,” the celestial beauty said in a teasing tone. “How can I possibly hurt you? You still have a role to play.”

The lady reached out her hand to touch the struggling phoenix in the special cage that had sealed its fate.

The moment the slender, and delicate hand touched the Phoenix’s body, something incredible happened.

The blazing red flames that covered its entire body had a sudden change. Beginning on the spot where the lady had touched it, black flames started to surge forth. Soon, this black flame spread across its body as Sepheron shrieked and struggled with all its might.

“Struggling is, also, good.” the lady chuckled. “I enjoy watching the last struggle of living things. Seeing the last embers of their life being dyed in black is a truly fascinating thing to see.”

Sepheron emitted one last desperate cry, before the black flames enveloped its entire body. Two minutes later, the Black Phoenix spread its wings wide, and eyed the lady before it.

It had been reborn, and its power had also increased after its transformation. It then bowed obediently to its new Master and uttered a cry of servitude.

“Do not worry,” the lady stated while patting its head. “The time is not yet ripe. However, rest assured. You will be able to return to your world, and spread your wings far and wide.”

Yes, the time was not yet ripe.

The Goddess stared in the distance and the corner of her lips curled up into a smirk. She watched as a certain Half-Elf left the God Domain to return to his world.

The Primordial Goddess focused her attention on the Temple and locked her sights on the Goddess of Lust. She stared at Lady Eros for a few seconds before shifting her attention to the Goddess of Female Knights, Astrid.

“Foolish girl,” The Primordial Goddess said softly. “Play with fire and you will get burned. But, this is also good. You and your brother should make things difficult for him.”

The Primordial Goddess unconsciously licked her lips in anticipation. Just like a dish that was slowly being cooked and mixed with spices, she looked forward to the feast that she would partake in, when everything fell in place.

“When the past no longer illuminates the future, the spirit walks in darkness.” The Primordial Goddess giggled. “Pendragon, I don’t need you to light up my world. All I ask is for you to just sit with me, in the darkness…”
