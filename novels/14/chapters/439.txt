Chapter 439: Confrontation At The Gate Of Beginnings [Part 2]

The tinkling sounds of arrows hitting metal resounded at the Gate of Beginnings.

Erchitu’s white fur glowed in a radiant light as the arrows bounced off its surface. The Tall Gate behind the Giant White Ox shimmered as it transferred its protection to the Champion of the Minotaur Race.

Erchitu was standing inside the boundary of the gate, and it could harness its power at will. Right now, Erchitu’s defenses were as powerful as the Gate of Beginnings which had withstood the strongest attack of the Elven Grand Archmage, as well as the Blademasters who were equivalent to the Saint Rank.

If their attacks couldn’t even leave a dent on the gate then mere arrows would have no chance of breaching Erchitu’s defenses.

William stood behind Erchitu with his arms crossed over his chest. They had already devised a plan on how to deal with the pesky Elven Army, who had no intention of showing them any mercy.

As long as Erchitu stood within the boundary of the Gate, he was almost invincible. Of course, the Giant White Ox couldn’t stay in this state for too long. The Magic and Spiritual Power of the Gate of Beginnings was tremendous and it could only harness it for a short period of time or else its body would explode due to absorbing too much power.

Erchitu had told William that it could only last for half an hour before they needed to switch to their backup plan. The Half-Elf was busy paying attention to the map on his status page to gauge how large an Elven force they had lured into the Domain of the Minotaur Race.

‘A little more than two thousand,’ William frowned. ‘I was expecting more, but I guess they thought that their current forces were enough. I hope the others will be able to accomplish their mission.’

Elandorr raised his hand to order a halt to the barrage of arrows that had dealt little to no damage to the Giant Ox who was protecting the Half-Elf he wanted to kill.

“Mages! Open fire!” Elandorr ordered.

A shower of elemental spells descended upon Erchitu who stood in front of the Half-Elf who was busy eating an apple.

William completely ignored the barrage of spells because he knew that Erchitu would be able to handle them all. He wasn’t too worried about the Elves throwing everything at him. What he was worried about was that the Elves would give up and leave him alone.

After three minutes of bombardment, the spells stopped coming. Smoke rose up in the air as the Elves waited to see if their attacks had turned the Giant White Ox into barbecue.

What greeted them was William sitting on a chair, and fanning himself with a feather fan, while eating. He was looking so relaxed, it was as if he was just here to observe his surroundings.

“Eh? Is it already over?” William asked after finishing the apple in his hand. “I thought the Elven Prodigies were strong. I didn’t expect them to be so weak. Tsk! Tsk! The old grandma in my hometown can easily lift me up and spank my bum until I cry out in pain. But you Elves? Tsk, what a bunch of weaklings.”

William shook his head in dismay and raised his voice so that all the long-eared bastards could hear him.

“It’s no wonder why my father had to go to the Silvermoon Continent to save all of you from the Demon Race. What a bunch of Puss*es!” William taunted. “My father and I are not afraid of Puss*es! Hahahahahaha!”

William’s irritating laughter grated the nerves of the Elves who were itching to beat him to a pulp. Even Elandorr, who had not reacted to William’s taunts earlier, was finding it hard to keep the calm expression on his face as he listened to William’s irritating laughter.

“What is a P*ssy?” Princess Eowyn asked one of the Blademasters by her side.

The Saint Class Warrior averted his gaze and pretended that he didn’t hear the Princess’ inquiry. Princess Eowyn had been raised with love and care. The Royal Instructors, as well as the Saintess, Lady Arwen, didn’t teach her anything vulgar, and steered clear from all profanities, lest they influence her in a bad way.

Princess Eowyn looked at the laughing Half-Elf in the distance, and a frown appeared on her beautiful face. Although she didn’t understand the coarse words that the Half-Elf was using, she felt that what William was saying was very rude. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Shut up!” Elandorr shouted. “As expected of a Half-Elf. Everything that comes out of your mouth is disgusting.”

“As expected of an Elf,” William replied with a sneer. “Your face reminds me of a P*ssy! Hahaha!”

Erchitu who was standing in front of William was fighting the urge to kick the Half-Elf who was seated beside his feet. Although both of them were on the same side, he felt embarrassed listening to William’s vulgar words.

“So, what are you going to do now?” William asked in an arrogant tone. “Is this the best that you’ve got?”

The Half-Elf was paying attention to the time. Erchitu only had a quarter of an hour before it would reach its limit. Until then, he would do his best to make the Elves wish that they could hack him to bits.

“Princess Eowyn,” William called out to the Princess that was standing several meters away from Elandorr, and protected by two Blademasters. “I’ve heard many things about you from my mother.”

Princess Eowyn’s ears perked up as she heard William’s words. Aside from her parents, the Elven Princess loved Lady Arwen the most. This was why when the Saintess accepted her as a Disciple, the Princess danced in joy to the amusement of her parents.

“Lady Arwen said good things about me?” Princess Eowyn asked. “What did Master say about me?”

William’s smile widened. Of course, his mother had mentioned her two Disciples in her letters, so he had known a few things about the Princess.

“She said that you like to dance when you are happy,” William answered. “Also, your favorite food is the red berries that grow near the World Tree. My mother had said that you were an excellent Disciple and that she was very proud of you.”

A warm feeling spread across Princess Eowyn’s chest when she heard that Lady Arwen was very proud of her.

However, that feeling soon disappeared at William’s next words.

“My mother praised the Elves for their pride, dignity, and valor, but I don’t see those redeeming features among the Elves in front of me. All I see are hypocrites and ungrateful scum who have aimed their weapons at and tried to kill the son of their Saintess and Savior.”

William sneered as he looked at Elandorr in contempt. “What pride? What dignity? You call this valor? So, your Commander belongs to the Elven Clans who hate the Human Hero that saved your lands. If my father only knew that you were all ungrateful bastards, he would definitely not have even lifted a finger and left you all to be enslaved by the Demon Race.”

William’s powerful words reverberated in the surroundings which made those who heard them feel ashamed of their actions. Although some of the Ancient Elven Clans hated Maxwell, the majority of the Elves treated him as a hero. Some of the young Elven prodigies even aspired to be like him when they grew up.

Hearing William say that they were ungrateful bastards made them falter.

“Shut up! Don’t listen to him!” Elandorr ordered. “He is just spouting nonsense.”

William ignored Elandorr and shifted his gaze to Princess Eowyn. “See, Princess? This is why my mother was forced to be separated from me. These Elven scum don’t recognize me as Lady Arwen’s son. How about you? Do you not recognize me as well?”

Elandorr unsheathed his sword. He couldn’t allow William to continue with his tirades.

Unfortunately, before he could order a full blown confrontation, Princess Eowyn’s firm and dignified voice reached his ears.

“I acknowledge you as our Saintess’, Lady Arwen’s, son,” Princess Eowyn said firmly. “Anyone who dares to say that you are not my Master’s son will become my enemy. I swear this upon the honor of the Royal Family!”

Elandorr ground his teeth in frustration. Since the Princess had recognized William as their Saintess’ son, any further act of instigation would backfire on him.

The young Elven Commander stared hatefully at William, while the latter looked back at him in ridicule. Now that William’s identity was recognized by the Elven Princess, it was now time for him to initiate the next phase of his plan, to ensure that their mission for coming to the Zelan Dynasty would become a success.
