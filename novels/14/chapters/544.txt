Chapter 544: Your Souls Are Mine

“Big… Brother,” Chiffon said weakly. More tears flowed down from her eyes as she looked up at the person that had declared to become her caretaker. “Don’t fight them. They are very strong. You will only get hurt. I will go with them, and apologize on your behalf. So, please, take Ian and go.”

“Strong?” William smiled as he helped Chiffon to stand up. “A bunch of men bullying a little girl is strong? Don’t worry, Chiffon. Now that your Big Brother is here, I’ll beat up these bullies for you.”

William didn’t add that he also planned on killing them later even if he had to chase them to the ends of the continent.

The Half-Elf used his fingers to wipe away the tear stains on Chiffon’s face before shifting his attention to the purple-haired guy that dared to strangle the little girl that he had taken under his wing.

“Oi, I don’t know who you are, or where you came from, but you have successfully made me angry,” William said.

Ian, who had been pinned down on the ground earlier, was also sheathing in anger. However, the two men that were holding her in place were stronger than her. However, she was no longer worried because her lover had come to their rescue.

She sneered internally because she knew that the six people who had ganged up on them would not have a good ending.

The Half-Elf’s eyes glowed with power as tendrils of lightning snaked around his body. He then pointed behind him and two streaks of lightning zapped the two men that were pinning Ian down, sending them skidding across the ground for several meters.

Ian immediately stood up and ran towards William and Chiffon.

The six men were at least Adamantium Ranked Fighters (Centennial Ranked). They couldn’t believe that a mere teenager was able to push them back as if they were just rookie mercenaries.

The purple-haired man forcefully fixed his broken arm using an elixir before giving William a hateful glare. He didn’t know how the red-headed teenager managed to land a sneak attack on him, but now that he was on guard, he wouldn’t allow the same mistake to happen again.

“Brat, we have an agreement with the Academy, so we are not allowed to severely injure the students here,” the purple haired man stated as he summoned a greatsword in his hand. “Although I won’t kill you, I will cut off one of your arms. That way, you will know that there are people in this world that you can’t afford to provoke no matter what.”

The guards that were standing at the side glanced at each other. They were not only there to prevent the students from entering the garden, they were also there to ensure that the six Adamantium Ranked Mercenaries wouldn’t go too far with their harassment.

Now that the situation had turned for the worse, the Captain of the Guard finally decided to step in and prevent the mercenaries from harming William. However, before he could even make his move, William’s words stopped him in place.

“Since you had already decided to become mere spectators then you can stay as spectators.” William turned his head to glare at the Captain of the Guards. “Don’t interfere, or I’ll hold you accountable for turning a blind eye on this farce.”

The Captain of the Guards unconsciously shuddered because, for a moment, he thought that a blade was pressed against his neck. If he took a step forward, this blade would penetrate his flesh and draw blood.

After saying what he had to say, William shifted his attention to the purple haired man whom he was planning to torture to death.

From behind his back, a portal emerged and dozens of Rainbow Birds flew out with a vengeance. B1, and B2, had spent some time with Chiffon inside the Mirage Cavern and grew fond of the girl.

Although they didn’t know exactly what happened, William’s feelings passed through them and their gazes locked on to the purple-haired man who was a few ranks above them. Even so, the two dumb birds were not afraid. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Unfortunately, William had already ordered them to deal with the other five men, because he personally planned to beat the crap out of the bastard that dared to kick Ian and strangled Chiffon.

The last one to come out of the Portal was Psoglav. The Demonic Dog smirked evilly as his single eye scanned his surroundings.

‘Just where did that pig-headed Anteater go off to?’ Psoglav thought. ‘Well, I’ll just look for him lat-‘

Just as Psoglav was about to summon his doppleganger, a big shadow loomed over them.

Psoglav raised his head, and the smirk on his face widened when he saw a Golden Dragon hovering above them. On top of the Dragon’s head, a small rainbow-colored anteater arrogantly looked down upon the six men as if they were just little insects.

“Psoglav, Kasogonaga, B1, and B2, I will let you handle the small fries,” William ordered. “Don’t kill them, understand?”

“”Okay!””

“Ian, watch over Chiffon for me.” William summoned his wooden staff and held it firmly in his hand. Without another word, he stomped on the ground and appeared right next to the purple-haired man.

The name of William’s opponent was Augustus. He was a Demon Mercenary that had been hired by a High-Ranking Noble from the Demon Continent to ensure that Chiffon lived a miserable life in the Kraetor Empire.

He and his men would visit Silverwind Academy twice a month in order to observe Chiffon and send a report to their employer.

Augustus liked this mission very much. Why? Because it was super easy to do and the pay was quite high. He would rather bully a little girl than face dangerous missions in the Demon Continent where the chances of dying were high.

He just didn’t expect that this easy mission of his would encounter difficulties that would cause him to waste a precious elixir to fix his broken arm.

The two clashed several times against each other. Both men were trying to gauge each other’s strengths, while exchanging blows deadly enough to instantly kill a weaker opponent.

It didn’t take long before Augustus noticed that he was being pushed back by the red-headed teenager, who was looking at him as if he was a walking corpse.

Augustus channeled his aura into his weapon with the intention of using his most powerful attack, to obliterate the annoying Half-Elf.

William was about to dodge the attack when he realized that the man in front of him didn’t randomly choose this instance to hit him with a full-powered strike.

Ian and Chiffon were directly behind him. If he dodged Augustus’ attack, it would hit the two people behind him. William knew that even if the two girls survived, they would be severely injured due to how powerful his opponent’s attack was.

“Ignite!” Augustus roared. “Blaze Fury!”

William raised his left hand and summoned a Silver Shield in front of him. The wooden staff in his right hand disappeared and it was replaced by Soleil.

Right now, William had equipped the Sun Knight Job Class, which was known for its very high resistance against flame-based attacks.

William’s feet skidded on the ground as Augustus’ attack collided with his shield. The flames had ignited the flowers around them, turning their surroundings into an inferno.

Ian had held Chiffon close to her when the attack started and used his body as a shield to protect the girl from the raging flames that seemed to have a life of their own. William sneered as Soleil glowed in his hand. The Mythical Weapon greedily absorbed the flames since they could be used as a source of power.

A few moments later, the raging flames died out completely, and the spear in William’s hand turned dark red.

William didn’t dare to use Soleil inside the academy because there was a chance that some of the students might get involved in the destruction that Soleil was capable of unleashing.

Augustus clicked his tongue because his plan failed. He then hurriedly distanced himself from the red-headed teenager as he took out a Seventh-Circle Scroll from his storage ring to unleash a follow-up attack. He didn’t intend to use this scroll because it was very expensive.

However, William had angered him so much that he decided to not only pull the teenager’s soul out from his body, but to devour it alongside Chiffon’s and Ian’s.

“Your Souls are Mine!” Augustus activated the scroll in his hand. “Soul Devourer!”

The leader of the Mercenary Group knew that once he activated his Trump Card, the annoying brat and his friends were bound to die. Although it was regrettable that Chiffon would be part of the casualties, Augustus didn’t mind.

All he wanted to do was kill the boy in front of him, regardless of what methods he used to make it happen.
