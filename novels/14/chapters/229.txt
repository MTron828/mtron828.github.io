Chapter 229: Thousand Beast Domain [Part 2]

William didn’t think twice and immediately purchased the 3 Square Mile Domain that was worth 30,000 God Points.

His current problem was having a suitable place he could send the Beasts, that he was planning to add to his private army, to when he didn’t need their help. Right now, Fenrir and the other Trollhounds were staying inside the Goblin Crypt.

It was the “makeshift solution” that the system had made as a temporary housing area for them. The system built a “Barracks” inside the dungeon where the trollhounds could stay, which enabled them to explore the Dungeon anytime that they wanted.

The main reason William and the System had housed them inside the Dungeon was because The Goblin Crypt supplied the Trollhounds with an unlimited source of food, namely the goblins inside the dungeon. The additional good news was that they could gain combat experience while doing so.

It also helped them develop their team battle tactics which would greatly increase their battle prowess.

After the Domain was purchased, the system integrated it inside the Ring of Conquest, by paying additional 5,000 God Points. It also connected the domain to the dungeon which would give them additional benefits once William’s seal had been undone.

William stood inside the domain and scanned its surroundings. There was nothing inside it aside from the sky and dry land.

[ Host we will now customize the domain, but we will need God Points in order to purchase the things we need. The prices will be shown on your status page and you can arrange it in any way that you wish. ]

William nodded his head and accessed the “Domain Settings” where various landmarks like trees, mountains, valleys, plains, marshlands, rivers, lakes, oceans, could be found.

‘Hmp. The days I spent playing Simp City were not in vain.’ William grinned as he started to modify the lifeless Domain he had just bought.

’10 ordinary trees only cost 1 God Point, not bad,’ William thought as he looked at the ordinary trees that were available in the shop. Then his eyes widened when he saw several other trees that he had only heard of in this lifetime.

-

[ Dragon Blood Tree - 100 God Points each. ]

— A breed of tree that produces a red sap that could be used for making healing potions.

[ Monkey Puzzle Tree - 100 God Points each. ]

— A breed of tree that spawns one Cercopes Monkey per day

— Maximum number of Cercopes Monkeys spawned per tree is 30

[ Quiver Tree - 100 God Points each. ]

— A breed of tree that automatically creates 10 - 20 arrows per week.

— Additionally once a month it will create a batch of 10 elemental arrows.

[ Candelabra Tree - 1000 God Points each. ]

— A breed of tree that spawns two random “Rainbow Birds” a day.

— Maximum number of Rainbow Birds spawned per tree is 50.

— if a Rainbow Bird dies, a new egg will appear on the tree and hatch 24 hours later.

-

There were thousands of trees in the tree catalogue and William couldn’t possibly read them all. In the end, William bought one Dragon Blood Tree, one Monkey Puzzle Tree, one Quiver Tree, one Candelabra Tree and a Hyperion Tree, which was recommended by the system.

-

[ Hyperion Tree - 1,000 God Points each ]

— One of the tallest trees in the world

— A breed of tree that spawns one Blood Eagle

— Maximum number of Blood Eagles per tree is 1.

[ Blood Eagle ]

— Birds of Prey

— Threat Level: D (Mid)

— Blood Eagles are Class D Beasts that will continue to grow stronger as they devour the blood and flesh of their enemies.

— It has a wingspan of 3 meters and is capable of traveling 400 MPH in short bursts, making it one of the fastest birds of prey in the world.

— It’s final form is the Blood Tempest which is a Millennial Beast.

-

William spent 1,420 God Points on the trees which left him a balance of 14,580 God Points.

‘So expensive.’ William scratched his head as he arranged the trees within the domain. He placed the Hyperion Tree at the center of the domain, while he scattered the other expensive trees in the Four Cardinal locations.

William added a lake and four rivers which cost him 700 God points. Soon, the Half-Elf became too engrossed in designing his domain and bought a couple of things for Aesthetic purposes.

His added purchases cost him 2,000 God Points, but his domain became more lively because of it. The weather control was worth 1,000 God Points. This function allowed William to control the temperature and season of his Domain depending on his whim.

The other 1,000 God Points was used to buy hills, boulders, shrubs, flower fields, and a Wide Villa that would serve as his “Vacation House”.

William was planning to add a few more things in the Domain when the System stepped in and reminded him that they had limited funds, so he couldn’t use it for luxury items.

‘10,980 God Points left.’ William sighed because his “Simp City” Project was put on hold for the time being.

“I need to buy grass that will grow in the plains for the herd to consume,” William muttered as he thought of Aslan, Chronos, and the rest of the goats that were currently in Lont. He wanted to give them the best, so William decided to buy the most expensive grass he could find in the Domain Shop.

[ High Grade Spirit Grass - 5,000 God Points per Hectare. ]

— A spirit grass that nourishes the body of anyone that consumes it and helps expel impurities.

— Can be used to craft certain types of pills and medicines.

— Continuous consumption of this grass will help strengthen the body overtime.

— After it is eaten, it will take 5 days for it to regrow again.

-

‘So expensive!’ William scratched his head, but still ultimately bought a hectare worth of High-Grade Spirit Grass.

He then evenly scattered it along the Four Cardinal Directions in order to prevent the Herd Animals from fighting against each other. William vowed that he would buy more Spirit Grass once he earned more God Points through his quests.

William summoned the trollhounds to his Domain and allowed them to explore the surroundings. He forbade them from making trouble with the Cercopes Monkey and the Rainbow Birds.

William ordered the Blood Eagle not to attack anyone inside the Domain. He promised that he would take it out to hunt from time to time and the latter happily agreed.

Every Beast inside William’s domain was automatically added to his King’s Legion. Although they were not creatures of the herd, they were inhabitants of his Domain. Since William was the owner, that made him the Master of all the beasts that resided within it.

[ God Points: 5,980 ]

“System, let’s stop for now,” William said. “I’m tired.”

William had spent hours arranging his Domain and he was now feeling very hungry. Designing the domain was fun, but very expensive as well. For now, he decided to stop and save what remaining God Points he had for future purposes. He was about to leave the domain when the System stopped him.

[ Host, you are forgetting something important. ]

“I am?” William scratched his head. “Should I have added a small mountain? Or perhaps a small valley? What did I forget exactly?”

[ Host, you forgot to give your Domain a name. ]

“Ah!” William clapped his hands in realization. “How could I completely forget such an important thing. Very well, from now on, this domain will be called ‘Thousand Beast Domain’.”

William has received several titles. However, he could only equip three of them at a time. The system had told him that he could equip three additional titles after he had upgraded his Main Job Class to the next level, which made William look forward to the future.

The current Titles he had equipped were…

[ Giant Slayer ]

[ Wolf Slayer ]

After making sure that everything was in order, William left the Thousand Beast Domain and returned to the real world.

Ironically, as soon as he appeared inside his room, he heard someone knocking on his door.

“Who is it?” William asked.

“It is me, Kenneth,” Kenneth answered.

William hurriedly opened the door and saw his Ex-Roommate Kenneth with a worried look on his face. At first, Kenneth stayed with William inside the Prefect Room, but after the latter became the Commander of the Angorian War Sovereign, Kenneth returned to their old dormitory room to give William some privacy.

Although William didn’t mind if Kenneth stayed with him, the delicate looking boy insisted that they separate their living quarters.

“I came to find you an hour ago, but no one was answering when I knocked,” Kenneth said. “Do you want to have dinner together?”

“Okay, can you wait five minutes? There is something I need to do first,” William stated.

“Sure.”

“Thank you.”

William closed the door and teleported the three sleeping guardians to his Villa inside the Thousand Beast Domain. He had already prepared a room for the three of them to rest while he waited for them to wake up from their hibernation.

The Half-Elf was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief after the three kids were safely tucked into their beds. Ella decided to stay with them instead of following William to the dining room. She had already eaten. She had tested the Spirit Grass that William had planted to make sure that it was safe for consumption and she was very satisfied with it.

Five minutes later, William and Kenneth headed to the Dining Hall together. The latter looked at William suspiciously, but didn’t say anything else. His mission was to observe the boy and not interfere with his private life.

Whatever secrets William had, Kenneth had no intention of prying into them. Deep inside, he was feeling guilty, so he did his job half heartedly. The thought of William getting hurt because of his mission was something he didn’t want to have happen.

This was why he didn’t report everything about William and kept some of his secrets to himself. He hoped that when they parted ways, William would still treat him as a friend, instead of a traitor who spied on him behind his back.
