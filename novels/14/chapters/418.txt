Chapter 418: Princess Sidonie’s and Morgana’s Versions Of Love [Part 1]

“Understood, Master,” Brendan said with determination. “I will look after the capital while you are away.”

Ezio nodded and patted his Second Disciple’s shoulder. “I will keep in touch using the method that I told you about. Do not do anything reckless and do not look for me. I will find you when the time is right.”

“Yes, Master.”

“Farewell.”

Ezio turned into a black mist and disappeared into the night. He had already informed Dave and Conrad about Conner’s imminent arrival to the capital. Est and Isaac were currently helping the two boys take the crystal statues of Est’s Mother, Herman, and Nana to the flying carriage.

Est didn’t want to leave the people important to him behind and decided to bring them along. After safely loading the statues into the carriage, they immediately left the capital and headed North.

Ezio waited until the four boys had safely left the capital before heading South East. His destination was none other than the Zelan Dynasty where the Elves were staying.

He would go there to gather information. Of course, if an opportunity presented itself, he would assassinate their Commander in order to bring chaos to their ranks. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ezio was quite familiar with the Elves. He had several missions within the Silvermoon Continent when Maxwell, William’s father, was busy fighting against the Demons. Although he knew that not all Elves were hypocrites, more than half of them were.

This was especially true in regards to the Patriarchs of some of the Elven Clans who hated Humans to the bone.

True to his word, Conner arrived the next day bringing with him over a hundred subordinates. The first thing he did was summon Brendan and ask him what the son of the Prime Minister had done in his absence.

“After his Excellency left the capital, I looked for volunteers to gather the survivors that were suffering on the outskirts of the kingdom,” Brendan reported. “Since we have plenty of food in the capital, It would be a shame to let them fend for themselves and die.”

Breandan’s voice was filled with such patriotism and righteousness that Conner found it hard to find fault in his actions. Also, he had given the boy the authority to do whatever he wanted during his absence.

Although what Brendan did was troublesome, Conner had no issues with it.

‘They can be used as additional hands during the war,’ Conner mused before nodding his head.

He was currently seated on the throne of the Hellan Kingdom, while Breandan was kneeling in front of him.

“Continue gathering the survivors,” Conner ordered. “Also, bring me the documents that pertain to the defensive capabilities of the capital. I will need all the information that you can give me.”

Brendan pondered for a bit before giving his opinion. “Your Excellency, I think these documents can be found in the Ministry of War, and the Ministry of Public Works and Development. Your Excellency, I alone will not be able to search for the documents you are looking for.”

Conner nodded in appreciation because Brendan was truly helpful when it came to managing the kingdom.

“Very well. I will give you the manpower you need.”

He then waved his hand and called out twenty of his subordinates to assist Brendan in finding the documents that he needed in order to strengthen the defenses of the capital.

A few minutes after he left, the ring on his finger started to glow. Conner frowned as he activated the long distance communication device that was given to the leaders who were in charge of capturing the Kingdoms and Dynasties of the Southern Continent.

A few seconds after activating the ring, a projection appeared in front of him. The sounds of battle could be heard in the background as the anxious face of Conner’s subordinate appeared in front of him.

“S-Sir! The capital of Anaesha Dynasty is being attacked! It’s impossible to defend it,” Conner’s subordinate screamed as he rolled to the side to evade an arrow that landed in the place where he stood a while ago.

“Who is attacking you?” Conner asked. He tried to keep his voice calm, but he was already clenching his fist so hard that his nails dug into his palms. “Is it the Elves?”

“N-No! It’s the Kraetor Empire and the Ant Army!” Conner’s subordinate replied.

He was about to say more, but a three-meter tall ant descended on him from behind, forcing the man to take defensive actions.

The ant screeched as it spat a corrosive acid on the man that led Deus in the Anaesha Dynasty. A blood-curdling scream filled with pain and agony reverberated throughout the room as Conner’s subordinate got hit by the Ant’s attack.

Moments later, the man fell on the ground, dropping the communication crystal in his hand.

Conner watched as his subordinate turned into a pool of blood as the corrosive acid melted his entire body. The leader of Deus sighed helplessly as one of his trusted aides died in front of him.

He was about to cut the connection when he noticed a white, and slender, hand pick the communication crystal up off the ground. Conner’s eyes widened when he came face to face with a beauty that could bring the downfall of a nation.

Although this was the first time he had seen this beautiful lady, he still had a hunch about who she was.

Conner narrowed his eyes as he asked the girl who was looking at him with a devilish smile a question.

“Princess Sidonie?” Conner inquired.

Princess Sidonie nodded, “You must be Conner. I’ve heard a lot of things about you.”

The beautiful girl’s hazel eyes glowed with power as she looked through the crystal. Conner felt his breath grow ragged as he stared at those beautiful clear-eyes that could bring any man to their knees.

If not for the fact that Sidonie was only looking at Conner through a communication crystal, the Leader of Deus might have already been Charmed by now.

Conner used all of his willpower to shake off the feeling of infatuation that was slowly taking hold of his body. He had long heard of Princess Sidonie’s ability to Charm others, but he didn’t expect that it was strong enough to affect him through a communication crystal!

This was something completely unheard of and it filled him with dread.

“Princess, it is a pleasure to finally meet you face to face,” Conner said as he tried to keep his expression calm. “I know that both of us started off on the wrong foot, but it is not too late for us to negotiate a cooperation.”

“Oh? A negotiation?” Princess Sidonie smiled sweetly. “Then, what do you have in mind, Mr. Conner?”

Princess Sidonie was wearing dark-blue light armor. It was the ceremonial armor for the Royal Family of Freesia and Princess Sidonie donned it in order to participate in the conquest of the Anaesha Capital. With the help of the Kraetor Empire and the Ant Warriors, the members of the Organization didn’t stand a chance.

Their defenses immediately crumbled and the majority of them fled for their lives. Naturally, Sidonie didn’t care whether they lived or died and simply ordered the Soldier Ants to do whatever they wanted to do.

Now that the leader of Deus in the Anaeshian Capital was dead, Princess Sidonie was now its official ruler.

“Our true enemy are the Elves,” Conner stated. “The two of us don’t need to fight.”

“A tempting offer, but I still haven’t forgotten that your men tried to capture me.”

“I am open for negotiations. The Crown Prince who ordered your capture is currently being detained in our Headquarters. If you want, I can give him to you in order to appease your anger. Naturally, I am also prepared to pay an additional compensation if you wish.”

The corner of Princess Sidonie’s lips curled up into a smirk as she stared at the Half-Elf in front of her. He reminded her of the red-headed boy who had repeatedly rejected her advances.

A devious plan formed inside Princess Sidonie’s head, which made her other half Morgana laugh out loud.

Yes, a plan that would make a certain red-headed boy accept her version of love.
