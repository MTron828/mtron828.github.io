Chapter 587: I Guess I Will Have To Do This The Hard Way [Part 2]

Due to William’s nasty surprise, the Invaders found themselves getting mobbed by Xavier and his men who were out for blood.

William and Chiffon stayed a few meters away from him, as they, too, helped in dealing with Xander’s seriously injured subordinates. After half an hour, they managed to break through the blockade in front of them. They headed towards the north, where they believed they had less enemies, who were waiting to ambush them.

“Looks like your guess was right, Randy ,” Xander said in appreciation. “I will reward you greatly after I take your Ex-Leader’s head.”

“You honor me with your praise, Your Excellency.” Randy bowed respectfully. “I only wish to serve the future Patriarch of the Tristan Clan.”

Xavier and his subordinates glared at their ex-comrade, who smiled back at them in contempt. They had trusted the bastard with many of their secrets, so his betrayal was a very bitter pill for them to swallow.

If they only knew that they were raising a snake, they would have definitely cut off its head before it had the chance to bite them from behind.

“Xavier, don’t think badly of me,” Randy stated. “You don’t have the qualities of a Patriarch. You are far too naive. Your ideals are nothing more than daydreams. It will be best if you submit to your Big Brother. His Excellency, Xander, is a benevolent person. I’m sure that he will forgive you for your transgressions.”

Xander smirked as he glanced at his little brother whose face had now become beet red due to anger. He had no intention of letting Xavier live. As long as his younger brother was alive, the threat to his reign would continue to exist.

It was better to pull the problem from the root and deter anyone from daring to rebel against his rule, when he became the Patriarch of the Tristan Clan. He would not allow anyone to stand in his way, not even his brother by blood.

“Randy, I swear, even if I die, I will bring you and my brother with me to the afterlife!” Xavier roared as he raised his sword. “Kill!”

“”Kill!””

Xavier and his men charged towards Xander’s location with fury. They no longer wished to escape with their lives. What they wanted was to bring the two bastards with them to hell.

“Your last struggle is not bad, however, it will not change the end result.” Xander snorted. “Kill them all! Leave my Younger Brother to me!”

“”Kill!””

The two forces collided and a free for all ensued. The two brothers faced off against each other, while the four high rankers fought not far from them. both sides wanted to win over the other, so the battle was quite intense.

Although the Guardian of the Floor had decreed that only the two brothers could kill each other, that didn’t stop their subordinates from helping their chosen leader to get the upper hand.

William was fighting alongside Chiffon and observing the chaotic battlefield. For some reason, he could feel that someone was intently observing him, but he couldn’t find that person’s location.

‘I guess, I’ll just have to risk it,’ William thought as he ran towards Xavier’s and Xander’s location. Chiffon also followed suit, because she didn’t want to get left behind.

When William was only ten meters away from the two combatants, two powerful presences descended upon him from his left, and right side.

The sound of metal clashing against each other rang in the battlefield as William blocked two swords that were aimed at him using the golden-metallic rod in his possession.

‘I knew it.’ William cursed internally as he swung Ruyi Jingu Bang to push his attackers away. However, it didn’t end there. Five more High-Rankers appeared out of nowhere, and all seven of them attacked William and Chiffon without mercy.

“Where is Byron?” One of the High Rankers that attacked William asked. “Is he dead?”

William ignored the High Ranker because he currently had no leeway to reply. He didn’t know where these seven Saints came from, but all of them ignored the duel between Xander and Xavier. They focused their attention on William, and seemed to be hell bent on capturing him alive.

“Sweep away all adversaries!” William declared as the golden metallic rod in his hand extended. “Ruyi Jingu Bang!”

All seven High-Rankers had no choice but to defend against the powerful attack that William had unleashed.

William frowned because his opponents were more sturdy than he originally thought they were.

The High-Rankers of the Tower of Babylon were different from the Saints outside of the Tower. They had reached their rank by getting resources from the ruling families, which greatly increased the speed of their cultivation. This allowed them to break through the ranks faster than their counterparts outside the tower.

Not only that, they also possessed powerful weapons, and artifacts that could be exchanged using tokens. The ranks of these weapons fall under the Unique and Legendary Ranks, which allowed them to hold their ground against William’s powerful attack.

(A/N: Weapon ranks in ascending order Rare, Unique, Legendary, Myth, Divine.)

“Are you all from the Agnis Family?” William asked.

He couldn’t believe that the Agnis Family had these many Saints under their command. If he added Byron, the Saint that he had killed in the Third Floor of Babylon, the Agnis Family had eight Saints under their wing.

They had the military might that was equivalent to one of the Kingdoms in the Central Continent, which made William rethink his understanding of each ruling family’s fighting force.

“You should have submitted when you had the chance, boy,” another High-Ranker commented. “Working under one of the ruling families of the tower gives great benefits. You were a fool for rejecting the olive branch that the Agnis Patriarch extended to you.”

William snorted because he would never lower his head to a Clan that enslaved people and used them to increase their wealth. This was why he chose to side with Xavier, instead of his older brother, because he was against the practice of enslavement in the Floor of Partings.

While William was about to unleash Sun Wukong’s special abilities, a scream sounded behind him.

The Half-Elf looked behind him and saw Chiffon being held by two of the Saints that he had fought earlier.

“Bastards! Let her go!” William gritted his teeth. He didn’t think that the Saints would stoop so low as to attack a girl that was beneath their rank.

“Big Brother, just beat them up!” Chiffon shouted. “Don’t worry about me!”

One of the High-Rankers that held Chiffon snorted and dislocated her right arm. They were expecting her to cry out loud in pain, but Chiffon only bit her lip. Tears formed at the corner of her eyes, but she held them back using her willpower.

She had suffered more brutal things in the Demonic Continent, so she was used to pain. Chiffon had learned the art of disconnecting her sense of pain in her body, and converting it to hunger instead.

The reason why tears were forming in her eyes was not because of physical pain, but an emotional one. She felt frustrated that she allowed herself to be taken as hostage in order to make her Big Brother submit to their enemies demands.

“Let her go or else,” William stated. He had unleashed his full aura and its pressure made anyone below the rank of Saint in the battlefield gasp for breath.

“Or else what?” One of the High-Rankers holding Chiffon sneered. As if to mock William’s attempt to threaten them, he dislocated Chiffon’s other arm. Making both arms of the little girl bend in an unnatural angle.

William raised his weapon and slammed it towards Xander who had distanced himself away from Xavier. Ruyi Jingu Bang increased its length, and size, until it was over two hundred meters long, and fifty meters thick.

The Legendary Weapon of the Monkey King smashed towards the ground, creating a dust cloud. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The High-Rankers of the Agnis Family sneered because what William did was useless. Both brothers were protected by the Guardian of the Floor. There was no way that someone could kill them aside from each other.

When the dust cleared, William lifted the golden rod and glanced at the man that he had crushed a while ago.

Xander’s clothes were stained with blood, and his right arm was broken. Even so, he was still alive, thanks to the protection of the amulet that he wore.

“What are you waiting for?” William asked Xavier who was looking at his older brother in a daze. “Kill him!”

Originally, William had no intention of using his Heroic Avatar because of its very long cooldown time. However, he was forced to do so because he was fighting against the Saints. This ability only lasted for an hour, so every second was precious.

He couldn’t just sit by and let Chiffon be harmed any further by the Two Saints who were currently using her as hostage.

Xavier snapped out of his daze and charged at his Big Brother. This was an opportunity that he couldn’t afford to miss.

Seeing that their trading partner was about to be killed, the High-Rankers of the Agnis Family immediately moved to prevent Xavier from killing his Big Brother, whom the Patriarch of their clan, secretly supported in the background.

William snorted and swatted the annoying High-Rankers like flies, preventing them from coming close to the two brothers.

“Stop!” the High-Ranker that was holding Chiffon shouted. “If Xander is killed, we will kill this girl too!”

Before William could give his reply, the pink-haired girl that was being held hostage by the two High-Rankers raised her head.

“The one who is going to die are the two of you,” Chiffon said in a cold voice.

A second later, a scene that nobody had expected, including William appeared in front of their eyes. The pink-haired girl’s body grew until it was over five meters tall.

Chiffon then opened her mouth like a taotie, and devoured the two men that held her as a hostage a while ago.

A cracking sound reverberated in the battlefield as the Giantess chewed the two Saints inside her mouth with a vengeance. Blood flowed at the corner of her lips, but Chiffon didn’t care.

It felt as if time paused completely still, and only resumed the moment she finished eating the two High-Rankers from the Agnis Family.

Chiffon roared and this roar made everyone’s hearts tremble. She had entered a berserked state and the Devourers Gauntlets in her hands shone bright red.

Clearly, eating two Saints was not enough to satisfy her craving. Seeing that there were plenty of humans to eat around her, Chiffon hunched her body and lunged towards the nearest man, who would soon become her third victim.
