Chapter 553: I Promise That I’ll Be A Good Girl, So Please, Don’t Leave Me Behind [Part 1]

On the same day that he had returned to the Academy, William had dinner with Ian, Princess Sidonie and Chiffon. When the little girl found out that her Big Brother had come back, her liveliness and appetite returned in full.

After dinner, William finally told them about his upcoming travel towards the center of the Central Continent, where the Tower of Babylon was located.

William didn’t lie to them and told them the difficulty of the quest that was given to him by Aamon. He even added all the information that the Headmaster of Silverwind Academy had told him.

After hearing everything he had to say, the three girl’s expressions became pale. Fortunately, they already finished eating dinner. If not, the three girls would have certainly lost their appetite after hearing William’s explanation.

“… You have to make it back no matter what,” Morgana said after hijacking Princess Sidonie’s body. “Darling, you still haven’t given me your babies. You can’t die on me. I’m too young to become a widow.”

The usually naughty girl looked at William with a pleading gaze. Morgana held William’s hand with both of her hands, as if she didn’t want him to leave her.

The Half-Elf felt touched because it was very rare for Morgana to show this expression to him, whenever they were together. This just proved how worried she was about his upcoming departure.

“I promise, I will return to you safely,” WIlliam replied as he gently squeezed her hand. “You’re right. I still haven’t given you my babies. There is no way I can allow that to happen. Wouldn’t it be my loss if you get married to someone else?

“That’s right! If you don’t want me to cheat on you, make sure you return as fast as possible.”

“Okay. I will return as soon as I can. I promise.”

Ian looked at William with a determined gaze. Since he was already going to a dangerous place, she decided to follow him.

“I’m going with you,” Ian said. “I can’t let you go alone.”

William firmly shook his head. “No. You can’t come with me.”

“Why? Are you afraid that I will hold you back?”

“That’s not it. I need you to stay with Sidonie. Without me around, only you will be able to help her when her divinity runs amok.”

“B-But.”

William reached out to hold Ian’s hand and squeezed it softly. “Don’t worry. I will make it possible for you to enter the Thousand Beast Domain even when I’m away.”

“Is that even possible?” Ian inquired. If it was really possible then she could meet with William anytime.

“Of course, it’s possible,” William replied. “Sidonie can already do it by using the Collar of Wisteria.”

Ian looked at the beautiful Princess, and the latter nodded her head in acknowledgement. Because of the many things that happened, William had forgotten to tell Ian about the additional function that he had added in the Collar of Wisteria.

William knew that Ian would definitely insist on coming with him to the Tower because of how dangerous it was. If possible, he didn’t want to bring her with him. This was why he decided to ask the System for help, and allow Ian to visit the Thousand Beast Domain, whenever she missed him.

Chiffon, who had no idea what they were talking about, simply listened to their conversation. The days where William was away were the most depressing days she experienced in her life. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When she no longer had to worry about how to keep the overwhelming hunger at bay, the little girl had more free time to live as a normal girl. To be honest, it was very rare for Chiffon to find happiness in life.

This was why she was unable to smile.

Her default expression was always a frown, due to her constant worry about what she was going to eat next. Now that she had met William, Ian, and Princess Sidonie, her life became more colorful.

Sometimes, Chiffon wondered if she was living inside a dream.

‘If this is a dream, I don’t ever want to wake up again,’ Chiffon thought as she looked at William who was busy coaxing Ian and Princess Sidonie. Feeling left out, the little girl decided to catch William’s attention by asking him a question.

“Big Brother, when are we going to leave?” Chiffon inquired. “I don’t have much luggage with me, so we can leave anytime.”

William, Ian, and Princess Sidonie all looked at the pink-haired girl at the same time.

“We?” William looked at Chiffon with a dumbfounded expression. “Sorry, Chiffon. I will not be taking you with me either.”

Chiffon tilted her head in confusion. “You’re not taking me?”

“No,” William answered. “Stay here in the academy with Ian and Sidonie. They will look after you while I’m away.”

Chiffon’s eyes clouded over when she realized that William didn’t intend to bring her along with him. According to her Big Brother, it would take a month to reach the Tower of Babylon from the Kraetor Empire.

But that was only the duration of the travel. William didn’t know how long he would be staying inside the tower, and this was also Ian’s and Princess Sidonie’s concern.

The Half-Elf had only been away for two days, and yet, Chiffon felt that there was a gaping hole in her heart. She felt so empty inside while William was away to visit Aamon’s Temple.

If William were to be away for more than a month, Chiffon had no idea what was going to happen to her.

A tear fell, followed by another.

The pink-haired girl looked at her Big Brother with blurry eyes as the pain inside her chest intensified.

“Big Brother, you’re going to leave me?” Chiffon asked. “You’re going to leave me alone?”

William hurriedly stood up from his seat and went beside the little girl to wipe her tears away. For some reason, William was very weak to little children. Although Chiffon was older than him, her current appearance was similar to Brianna, whom William had treated as his own little sister, back in the Southern Continent.

“You will not be alone,” William replied. “You will be with Ian and Sidonie. They will look after you.”

Chiffon covered her face with her hands as she sobbed uncontrollably. No matter what William said, no matter what he promised, her tears didn’t stop falling. What was worse was that the moment she started crying, her stomach also started grumbling.

Although she had just eaten dinner, Chiffon’s hunger came back, and it came back with a vengeance.

The little girl had lost control of her emotions, and her powers.

[ Host! Get away from Chiffon. Her Divinity is going to activate! No! Scratch that! Bring her to the Dungeon of Atlantis instead. Hurry! If you are a second late, this whole Academy, along with all its students will be devoured! ]
