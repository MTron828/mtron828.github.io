Chapter 142: Glory To The Demon Race! [R-18]

[Disclaimer: This chapter contains R-18 Scenes]

The excitement in the First Year Martial Class Division died down after a few days. William’s stellar performance had taken a back seat because the competition for the Head Prefect of the Martial, Spirit, and Magic Division Classes in different year-levels had started.

Understand that being the commander over an entire division was a position that no one would allow to slip past their fingers. It was the easiest way to get noticed by the King of the Hellan Kingdom and receive his good graces.

William, Ella, and Kenneth wanted to see how Est would do in his competition, but they were barred from entering the Magic Division. When William asked the guards why, they only told him that the Martial Classes didn’t have the qualifications to enter the grounds of the Spirit and Magic Division Classes.

The red-headed boy was dumbfounded by this kind of treatment, but he didn’t pursue the matter. William had a meeting with Grent after the battle in the coliseum, and the latter had told him about the “unfair treatment” that the Martial Division Classes were receiving from the two other Divisions.

Grent added that if William were to experience these things, he shouldn’t get angry on the spot and just let it be for the time being.

This was the sad truth in the Southern Continent. Only those with Spiritual and Magic Powers were treated as if they were special from the rest. As for those who didn’t have magic? They would be treated just like everyone else inside the Royal Academy even if they were a noble.

“To think that there is such descrimination here in the Royal Academy,” Kenneth wrinkled his nose in annoyance.

“It’s fine,” William said as the three of them went back to the Solaris Dormitory. “Since they don’t allow the Martial Classes to enter their Divisions then I will, also, not allow them to enter ours.”

Kenneth gave him the “You can do that?” look and William only chuckled at his roommate’s dumbfounded expression.

“Of course I can do that,” William replied. “Just watch me.”

William approached the guards that were guarding the gates of the First Year Martial Division. He then showed them his prefect badge and gave out his order. Although the two guards looked at him in a weird manner, they promised that they would enforce the rules that he had given them.

Kenneth looked at how William used his authority in a very casual manner.

“You are a very petty person, you know that, right?”

“I’m one that likes to hold grudges. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!”

Kenneth shook his head helplessly as he followed his roommate back to their dormitory room.

William was feeling very smug about his blatant use of his authority, that he had completely forgotten that the few friends that had a relationship with belonged to the other divisions. This order of his would make Ian ridicule him in the not so distant future.

“Sir, the hot water you wanted is here,” the pretty girl who was working inside the inn said as she knocked on the door of a room.

A handsome man wearing elegant clothes opened the door and made a gesture for her to come in. When the pretty girl was safely inside his room, he locked the door and faced her with a grin.

The pretty girl stood still in the center of the room in a daze.

The handsome man walked towards the bed and motioned for her to come to him.

“Come,” the man ordered.

“… Yes,” the girl replied as she walked towards him. She stopped half a meter from the man and waited patiently for his next orders.

The man lifted the girl’s chin as he looked at her clouded eyes. He had placed a powerful suggestion spell on her earlier to come to his room in the middle of the night when everyone inside the inn was sleeping.

It was very easy for him to empower the suggestion spell because the pretty girl took a liking to him when she guided him to his room. The major factor that empowered the spell was because the girl was only a commoner, and had no resistance to magic. He only needed to wait until the effect of the spell matured in order to have his victim willingly enter his arms.

“Time to have a taste,” the handsome man lowered his lips and kissed the pretty girl.

The girl’s body stiffened for a brief moment before it became lax. The handsome man held her waist firmly to prevent her from collapsing on the floor.

A minute later, their lips parted as the man licked his lips in satisfaction.

“Such a sweet and innocent life force,” The handsome man sighed in appreciation. “Now, the question remains… should I pluck your cherry or not?”

The girl offered no reply. She leaned weakly on the man’s chest as if all of her strength had been sucked out from her lips. If the man really decided to have his way with her, the girl would definitely not be able to form any sort of resistance.

The handsome man expertly removed her upper clothes so her beautiful breasts appeared before his eyes. He then lowered his lips to kiss the pink tips that were fanning the flames of his lust, before placing them inside his mouth to lick and suck on them.

He was very satisfied with the softness and volume of her breast, causing him to enjoy them to the fullest. The handsome man spent a few minutes fondling, kissing, licking, and sucking the girl’s proud peaks, while soft moans escaped the girl’s lips.

He only stopped when he had enough, and prepared to go to the next phase of his night of pleasure.

As his hand was slowly making its way towards the pretty girl’s lower body, he heard the voice of the owner of the inn calling out her daughter’s name from the first floor.

“Ava?” the voice called. “Where are you, girl?”

The handsome man clicked his tongue because the opportunity had been lost. He knew that he couldn’t jeopardize his mission just for the sake of saiting his carnal desires on a mere commoner, no matter how pretty she was.

The handsome man whispered in the girl’s ears as he strengthened the suggestion spell that had already taken hold of her mind and body.

“You will forget everything that has happened. You will not remember my face, my name, or anything that is related to me. Do you understand?”

“… Yes,” the pretty girl replied weakly.

The handsome man watched as the pretty girl tottered towards the door. Even in her weakened state, the pretty girl didn’t forget to bow and lock the door behind her.

“This is only a small mishap,” the handsome man muttered as he looked outside the window of his room. “Once I enter the Royal Academy, I will follow my Lord’s order and… indulge myself on the beautiful bodies of the most talented ladies in the kingdom while I suck the life force from their luscious lips. I can’t wait to have a taste.”

The man grinned as he held back the laughter inside his chest. “Glory to the Demon Race!”
