Chapter 244: The Role Of A Chess Piece

“So, are you telling me that Lady Wendy has left the academy?” Carter asked. He just finished making a new set of candies that were meant for the beautiful young lady whom he had set his eyes on.

“Yes,” Charlotte replied with a smile. “The Knight Commander was assigned a special mission and he took her with him.”

“Is that so…” Carter smiled, but he was inwardly feeling irritated. He was currently under a strict deadline and he had no idea when his target would be returning to the academy. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

‘I guess, I will just have to improvise,’ Carter thought as he pulled Charlotte for a kiss. “I have a request for you, My Love.”

Hearing the Professor’s intimate words made Charlotte’s heart skip a beat. “I want you to distribute these candies to the officers of the First and Second Years of the Magic Division. They have done a good job in surviving the Dungeon Outbreak and this is my reward for them.”

“I don’t mind doing this for you, Professor. But, what kind of reward will you give me afterwards?” Charlotte inquired.

Over the past few days, she had received a lot of personal training from Carter. The Professor had already successfully won the noble lady’s heart. His every whim, and orders, were carried out by Charlotte without fail.

“Visit my room tonight,” Carter raised her chin with his fingertip. “I will make sure that you will have a satisfied smile on your lips when you close your eyes to sleep.”

He then lowered his head and kissed her lips which made the young noble lady very happy.

Charlotte left Carter’s room in a good mood and headed towards the dormitories of the First and Second Year students in the Magic Division.

Five minutes after Charlotte left his room, the door opened and Charlotte’s best friend, Annie, entered the room.

Carter had used his suggestion spell to make the girl come to his room, so that he could ask her about the latest news that was circulating around the merchant groups. Just like always, Annie told him that the Kingdom seemed to be preparing for the possibility of another Dungeon Outbreak and was stocking up on weapons and armors.

The professor didn’t find anything wrong with this because he would do the same if he was in the King’s position.

“What are you eating?” Est asked when he saw Isaac holding a pouch in his hands while chewing on something.

Isaac presented a different pouch to Est with a smile. “Young Master, they are candies. The Secretary of the Third Year Magic Division, Lady Charlotte, gave it to us. She said that it was a small reward for doing a great job during the Dungeon Outbreak.”

“Lady Charlotte?” The image of the pretty daughter of the Marquesse appeared inside Est’s head as he accepted the pouch from his retainer. He then casually picked up a candy from the pouch and ate it.

The sweet taste flooded his mouth and Est felt light-headed for a brief moment before everything returned to normal.

“This is quite delicious,” Est said after finishing the candy. “Do you know where she bought this?”

Isaac shook his head, “Lady Charlotte said that these were hand made so they couldn’t be bought in any stores. However, she promised to give us more after the maker had finished making another batch.”

Ian, who usually quarreled with William, was not around. Because of this, Isaac felt a little bit lonely because there were very few occasions when he had to separate with his twin. After the two finished eating the candies inside their pouch, they returned to their duties as officers of the Magic Division.

Both of them were secretly looking forward to the next batch of candies that they would be receiving as soon as it was made.

After Carter received the “resources” from the Demon Continent, he immediately went to work and produced as many as he could for the first batch. These candies were different from the first one he distributed months ago because it was fifteen times more potent.

Usually, those who ate his candies would take at least two months before the suggestion spell inside their bodies matured. With this new candy, it would only take a week or two before the effect came into fruition.

Not only that, there was another spell added in it that Carter planned to activate during the Inter-Division Ceremony. By then, everyone that had eaten the candy would give in to their inner desires and would wreak havoc on those around them.

Since the Demon General had given Carter the marching order to execute his plan at the soonest possible time, he also made sure that the resources that his subordinate received were more than enough for the massive undertaking.

Even Carter felt that what the Demon General asked of him was overkill, but he didn’t have any intention to complain. What he wanted to do above all else was to pin down the girls that he had set his eyes on, and make them his personal broodmares.

After the Demon’s defeat in the Silvermoon Continent, the number of powerful demons that had been born was very low. This was why they decided to capture the talented humans from the Southern Continent and bring them back to the Demon Continent through the portal they had hidden along its borders.

Carter didn’t know much about the specifics, but the Demon General gave vague hints that they had “helpers” in the Southern Continent. It was these helpers that had provided him the identity as the Professor of the Academy and allowed him to infiltrate their strict regulations with ease.

There was no need for a chess piece to question his master’s orders. Carter was fully aware that he was just one of the many pawns of the Demon General that were deployed to the Human Lands.

Although all of them were given different roles, their goals had always been the same.

Their only goal, in their lives as chess pieces, was to bring back the glory of the Demon Race. Nothing else mattered, not even their lives.
