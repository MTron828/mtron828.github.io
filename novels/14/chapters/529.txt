Chapter 529: Is Your Academy Teaching Weaklings? [Part 1]

The Last Day of the Assessment Test…

Princess Sidonie had just finished lunch, and was about to return to her room when she heard a commotion in the dining hall.

A crowd gathered around Prince Jason and those who had gathered were constantly praising him for his triumphant return at the academy after challenging the Mirage Cavern.

“That’s amazing, Your Highness!” one of Prine Jason’s classmates exclaimed. “You actually beat the record that was set by the First Prince. Your name will definitely go down in the Academy’s history!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Incredible! I am blessed to witness the birth of a legend in my generation. Thank you, Your Highness, for giving me this opportunity to witness your greatness!”

“Long live Prince Jason!”

“”Long Live!””

Prince Jason acted as if what he did wasn’t a big deal. When his gaze landed in Princess Sidonie’s direction, he gave her a brief smile before nodding his head in greeting.

Princess Sidonie returned his greeting with a nod of her own before turning away to return to her room.

The Prince’s eyes followed the beautiful princess until her back disappeared from view. Everyone noticed his behavior and exchanged glances with each other. All of them were well aware of the custom of the Kraetor Royal Family.

Cousins marrying each other was a very common thing, and one look was enough to tell them that the Prince was planning to do just that.

However, there was one problem.

The Princess was wearing a collar on her neck, and the one that gave it to her was none other than the red-headed boy that hailed from the Southern Continent. Due to William’s declaration of being Princess Sidonie’s lover, almost everyone in the academy had come to know his name by now.

They also knew that he had been thrown to Class F due to the reaction of the nobles of the kingdom. Simply put, they didn’t like William and they wanted Princess Sidonie to take the collar on her neck off, and find someone who was more deserving of her beauty.

None of the students surrounding Prince Jason said anything, because they didn’t want to be singled out by the Prince. Instead, they continued to praise him for his achievement, and ingratiate themselves to him.

[ What a bunch of bootlickers. ]

Morgana snorted from inside their shared mindscape.

‘Well, that’s just how the world works,’ Princess Sidonie replied. ‘Those in power tend to gather people around them. This is a very common thing when you’re a member of a powerful faction.’

[ Hmp! Just because he broke the Academy’s record he thinks he’s that good? The moment Darling returns, everyone will probably have a stroke due to shock. By the way, where is Darling? ]

‘He didn’t tell you?’ Princess Sidonie asked back.

[ No. Also, why are you asking me? If I know about it, you will also know, right? ]

The corner of Princess Sidonie’s lips curled up into a smirk ‘Big Sister, don’t think that I don’t know about your night escapades when I am in deep sleep. Every time I wake up in the morning feeling hot and bothered, I know that you’ve been doing something behind my back.’

[ W-What are you talking about? I-I’m not doing anything wrong. ]

‘You’re stuttering, Big Sister.’

[ B-Because you are saying weird things. ]

‘Heh.’

Princess Sidonie shook her head because she could tell that Morgana had no intention of spilling the beans. Actually, she wasn’t too bothered by it. She had already known how naughty her other half could be. Her only concern was that she wasn’t there to see whatever she was doing with her beloved.

As soon as Princess Sidonie entered her room, a sudden surge of power washed over her body. She almost collapsed from where she stood, fortunately, she was able to lean on the door before her legs lost their strength.

[ It’s breaking out of control again ]

Morgana muttered worriedly, as she hugged Princess Sidonie within their shared mindscape. It had been a week since the Princess had been with William, and there had been no time for them to spend some quality time with each other.

William had been helping her regulate the Divinity inside her body, but due to his absence. The Power of Lust was starting to break free from Princess Sidonie’s control.

The only saving grace was that whenever these outbreaks occurred, she was alone without anyone around her. She had long stopped using her power to turn people into her loyal subordinates.

[ Take deep breaths. Follow me, inhale… exhale… inhale… exhale… ]

Morgana guided Sidonie to help her to calm down. Five minutes later, the beautiful princess had regained control of her body.

[ Don’t worry. Darling will be back soon. Just hang in there, okay? ]

‘Yes.’

Princess Sidonie walked up to her bed and laid down. She felt so weak after fighting against the Divinity that was starting to manifest.

Just before she fell into sleep’s embrace, the image of her beloved Half-Elf appeared inside her head. She hoped that by the time she woke up, William would have already returned to the academy.

That way, he would be able to help her, dispel the Power of Lust that she had forcefully held back inside her heart.

“Should we wrap things up here? I think all of the students had already submitted their bracelets,” one of the professors that was managing the collection of the bracelets proposed.

A few of the professors nodded their heads, however the Headmaster of the Academy, Gilbert, remained seated.

“It’s only half an hour before the promised time. Let’s just wait and see it through till the end,” Gilbert said. His voice was firm, which meant that he was not going to take no for an answer.

A year ago, there was an incident when a dozen students had been unable to pass their bracelets in time because the Professors managing the collection had left earlier than the promised time.

Many nobles had complained to the Headmaster, so he decided to personally participate on the last day of the Assessment Test to ensure that all the Professors would do their duty properly.

The Professors glanced at each other before sighing inside their hearts. Since their Employer told them to wait for half an hour, they would wait for half an hour.

While everyone was waiting for the clock to strike three in the afternoon, three students entered the room. All of them looked disheveled, and it was clear that they rushed to the Academy’s staffroom in order to submit their bracelets in time.

The Headmaster immediately recognized two of the latecomers. One was a Half-Elf who was being monitored by the special agents of the Emperor, the other was a troublesome girl that hailed from the Demon Continent.

William also recognized the Headmaster of the academy and headed in his direction. He thought that it would be best if he surrendered his bracelet to the man on top, so that no mishaps would happen.

“Sorry we are late,” William said as he removed the bracelet from his wrist. “Here you go, Headmaster.”

William placed his bracelet on top of GIlbert’s desk with a smile. Chiffon and Ian did the same. Gilbert nodded before looking at the clock on the wall. There were still ten minutes before three in the afternoon, so William and his group had arrived in time.

“I have received your bracelets,” Gilbert replied as he took William’s bracelet from his desk to personally see his results. “All three of you can return to your rooms and take a bat- Wait! Don’t go!”

The three teenagers almost jumped back in fright due to the Headmaster’s sudden shout. They didn’t expect that the man who stood at the top of the Academy would look at them with bloodshot eyes, as if they had committed something outrageous.
