Chapter 54: Elven Prophecy [Part 1]

After the battle, Owen tasked William to look after Celine, while he went to treat the people that were injured during the defense of Lont. Celine wasn’t in any kind of danger. She was just thoroughly exhausted.

While doing her experiment, she didn’t eat or drink anything because what she was doing required extreme focus. Fasting in this manner was fine since she was already used to such a lifestyle. However, getting dragged away to fight a high-level battle while not in her peak condition still took a toll on her body.

William looked at the disheveled woman with pity. Her skin was pale, her hair in disarray, and her face looked very haggard. Even so, she was still beautiful. The young boy wasn’t able to stop himself from praising Celine even in her current state.

Currently, he was taking his Master back to her home while riding on Ella’s back. Celine was very light, so it was not hard for William to hold her in place. It didn’t take long for them to reach her home on the outskirts of Lont.

“Mama Ella, can you open the door for me?”

“Meeeeeh.”

Ella pushed the door with her hoof and it opened without any resistance. Due to William’s strength stat, it was quite easy for him to carry Celine with both arms.

“Intruder! Uwaaaaaaak!!” Oliver, the monkey parrot, shouted from his perch. “Intruder!”

“Shut up, Oliver!” William replied in annoyance. “Master is sleeping, don’t be noisy.”

Oliver looked down on William with contempt. It was a bit irritated because the boy dragged away his Mistress during an important experiment… The parrot monkey then looked at Celine then back at William before clicking its tongue.

“Taking advantage of the mistress while she’s unconscious. Brat, don’t you have any shame?”

“Eh? You can talk properly?” William’s eyes widened in surprise.

“Of course I can talk. I’m not a little monkey, like you,” Oliver replied with irritation. “Take the mistress to the second floor. Make sure not to do anything indecent, or else I’ll bite you to death.”

“I’m just a ten-year-old-kid, how can I possibly do something indecent.”

“A ten-year-old?”

The parrot monkey scoffed. “Kid, other people may not know, but I know that your soul doesn’t belong in this world.”

“W-What are you talking about?” William stuttered.

The parrot monkey eyed the boy before it lifted its claw and pointed at the stairs. “Let’s talk after you properly tucked in the mistress. I, also, have a lot of questions for you.”

William looked anxiously at the parrot monkey before heading towards the stairs. His mind was in disarray and several questions appeared inside his head.

Ten minutes later, he was sitting at the dining table on the first floor. He didn’t know how the parrot was able to prepare some tea. But, everything was already laid out on the table when he returned from his task of taking his Master to her bedroom.

Oliver seemed to be in a good mood, and the snarkiness from before had completely disappeared.

“Have some tea first,” Oliver said as he stood at the center of the table. “It’s very rare for us to have guests, so I didn’t have time to bake a cake. However, we still have cookies. I hope that they are to your liking.”

William obediently took a sip of the tea, but he passed on the cookie. He was more curious about how the parrot monkey knew about his identity.

Ella stood beside William’s chair. She was also curious about what the parrot monkey wanted to discuss with her baby.

The goat didn’t care about William’s past or identity. The only thing she knew was that she had raised William since he was a baby. Even so, her curiosity got the best of her, so she decided to stay and listen.

William stared at the parrot monkey with a complicated expression. Part of him wanted to roast the monkey so that his secret would be kept. The other half wanted to bury Oliver deep in the ground, so that his secret would remain. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Oliver felt Wiliam’s murderous gaze and decided to take the initiative to talk.

“Don’t look at me like that,” Oliver narrowed his eyes. “I mean you no harm. I was just surprised that someone like you was born in this world.”

“What do you mean, someone like me?” William asked. “What do you know about me?”

The parrot monkey grinned as it picked up a cup of tea and took a sip to quench its thirst. “I don’t know much. All I know is that your soul doesn’t belong to this world. However, you can’t be considered an Otherworlder since you were born naturally. That only means that this world had accepted you as one of its own, which is a very rare occurrence.”

“What do you mean a very rare occurrence?” William inquired. “Also, Otherworlders? Are you talking about transmigrators?”

“Transmigrators? You mean those souls who cross space and time and possess the body of dead or dying people?” Oliver asked back. “Well, there are a few of those cases. My Mistress’ grandfather was one of those Transmigrators you are referring to.”

“Wait, hold on.” William looked at Oliver with a serious expression. “There are transmigrators in this world?”

“What’s so surprising about it?” Oliver tilted his head. “This world is very vast. The possibility certainly exists. Although, their number would not exceed the number of fingers on one hand. The Gods wouldn’t allow more than five individuals in every era.”

“You talked about Otherworlders, what are they?”

“Simply put, they are people from another world.”

“You thought I was one of them?”

“At first, yes.” Oliver nodded his head. “But, since you were born naturally then you are not counted as such.”

“Then how did you know?” William asked the most important question of all. “Do you have the power to look at a person’s soul?”

Oliver chuckled. Since his head was that of a monkey, the chuckle sounded irritating in William’s ears. “Right now you are a ten-year-old, but the soul that I’m seeing using my ability is older. If I have to make a bold guess, you are in your late teens or early twenties, but not more than that.”

‘This is bad,’ William thought. ‘If there are other people with this ability then I’m in deep trouble!’

“What you’re thinking will not come to pass, so you can relax.” Oliver assured him. “My ability is unique and it was something that was given to me by my creator, Lord Darwin. I am fairly confident that only I have the ability to see through the soul of a person in this world.”

William sighed in relief as he heard Oliver’s explanation. Although he still didn’t know what kind of ability it possessed, he would like to believe that it was telling the truth.

Seeing that the young boy had finally calmed down, Oliver decided to tell him the real reason why he wanted to talk to him.

“William, I have a favor to ask.”

“I’ll listen to it first. Whether I can do it or not will depend on my mood.”

“Tch. You’re like your grandpa. Always haggling for benefits.”

Oliver shook his head helplessly before saying his request.

“You don’t have to do this request right away because the current you is still too weak and too young to go to that place,” Oliver explained. “All I ask is that you do your best, because the Mistress’ life is at stake.”

William frowned, “What do you mean Master’s life is at stake?”

Oliver sighed as he lowered his head and looked at the table. “Once upon a time, on the continent of Silvermoon, there was a family of elves that went by the name Rayleigh…”
