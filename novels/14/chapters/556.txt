Chapter 556: To Infinity And Beyond

William and Ashe laid on the bed, hugging each other.

The gems on their chests glowed in synchronized rhythm, as the System bestowed Ashe the ability to instantly teleport to the Thousand Beast Domain.

This was not an easy thing to do because it required fifty thousand God Points to make it possible. William didn’t mind spending that much because it allowed Ashe to have the means to visit the Thousand Beast domain anytime she wanted.

William had already told Ashe and Princess Sidonie that they could also teleport to his domain if their lives were in danger. Their safety was his priority, so he didn’t mind spending God Points to ensure their safety.

God Points: 4,250,042

If only he had known about this feature before leaving the Southern Continent, he would have definitely made it so Wendy and Est could drop by his Domain to come see him.

After half an hour, the modification of their gems had been successfully completed. It was a very delicate process, but thanks to the System’s ability, it went as smoothly as planned. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“With this I can see you anytime that I want,” Ashe said as she stared at William’s eyes. “Thank you.”

“Why are you thanking me?” William asked as he kissed her forehead. “I like having you around. If not for the fact that I’m worried about Sidonie being alone, I would have also taken you along with me.”

Ashe smiled as she buried herself in William’s embrace. Aside from William, only she had the ability to keep Princess Sidonie’s divinity from going berserk. She and the Princess had seen what had happened to their Beach Villa in the Dungeon of Atlantis.

What was once a beautiful floor was now a dark place, devoid of anything.

According to the System, the floor would revert to how it was in the past. However, it would take at least a year for that to happen. Naturally, there were ways to hasten up the process, like fixing it using the Dungeon Settings.

However, for that to happen, William needed to finish conquering it first. The progress in conquering the dungeon had halted, on the 52nd Floor because the monsters were quite powerful.

Each group had a dozen individuals, and there would always be a Millennial Beast, and two Centennial Beast among them. However, it didn’t end there. Once the teams engaged them, the Red-Eyed Razor Naga (Millennial Beast), would shout a warcry that would call the other groups to come to their location.

William and his party would then face at least Four Millennial Beast, Eight Centennial Beast, and thirty-six Class A Monsters.

This would have been easily dealt with if William was able to use his Heroic Avatar. But, for some strange reason, his Heroic Avatar was disabled on the 52nd Floor of Atlantis. This left him no choice but to allow his Herd and Legion to get stronger first, before challenging the floor again.

‘Darling, are you done?’ Morgana asked.

‘Yes. we just finished,’ William replied. ‘What’s the problem?’

‘There’s no problem,’ Morgana stated. ‘I just managed to put Chiffon to sleep, so I can join you and Ashe.’

Before William could even reply, the door of the room opened and a beautiful girl with golden eyes walked towards the bed with a sensuous smile.

“You’re going to leave tomorrow, so you need to at least do some maintenance,’ Morgana said as she sat on the bed. ‘It has been a while since the three of us did it. You’re not going to get any sleep tonight, Darling~”

The next day…

“Big Brother, what’s wrong?” Chiffon asked as she looked up at the sleepy looking William.

William yawned before patting the little girl’s head. “Nothing. I just wasn’t able to get much sleep last night.”

Chiffon tilted her head in confusion, but she decided not to pry. The two of them would be leaving today, and she was feeling quite excited about traveling alongside William.

“Ah, there you are, William,” the Headmaster of the Academy, Gilbert, appeared on the gates of the Academy. “I’m glad I managed to see you before you left the academy.”

William had notified him beforehand that he would take a leave from his studies to go to the Tower of Babylon.

The Headmaster wanted to accompany him as well, but he was currently too tied up with the school activities that had been scheduled. He also had to supervise the preparation of the tournament that would happen in less than two months.

This tournament held a special meaning to the Kraetor Empire because this decided the rankings of their top prodigies. Those who were in the top ten would be given resources in order to further increase their ranks.

Those who weren’t able to get to the top ten, but had shown great potential would be sponsored by the Empire as well. This was a way to motivate the young generation to strive for excellence, which would further boost the strength of the Kraetor Empire in the future.

“What’s wrong, Headmaster?” William asked. “Do you perhaps want to tell me to buy you a souvenir?”

“Well, that is also a good idea. But, I came here to ask you a favor.”

“I’m all ears.”

Gilbert took out a scroll from his storage ring and gave it to William. The Half-Elf spread it open and saw what seemed to be an exquisite, green flower brooch, with a sparkling jewel at its center.

“This is called the Brooch of Emerald Desire,” Gilbert explained. “It was said that it was among the priceless treasures that can be found in the Vault of the Vanished Warlord. If you are able to get the opportunity to retrieve it, I am willing to pay a hefty sum for it.”

“If I see it then I’ll trade it to you, Headmaster,” William replied. “But, if I don’t. No hard feelings, okay? There is a possibility that I might get trapped there for an indefinite period of time.”

Gilbert nodded in understanding. To be honest, he didn’t want William to go to the Tower to risk his life. He had already done his best to convince him, but the latter was determined to go.

Since that was the case, he decided to give him as much support as he could and prepared the necessities he would need in his journey.

“Very well, May the wind be always at your back, and the light shine upon your way,” Gilbert placed his hand on William’s shoulder. “Also, look after Chiffon for us. You don’t have to worry about what the other side is going to say. We will handle that for you.”

The old man lowered his head and whispered something in William’s ears.

“If it becomes dangerous, do your best to escape the floor,” Gilbert whispered. “You don’t need to run a fool’s errand. Life is very precious, do not waste it on trivial things.”

William nodded his head, and didn’t make any further comments.

“I’ll come back as soon as I can, Headmaster. Goodbye for now.”

“Goodbye, Headmaster,” Chiffon said as she bowed her head. “Thank you for letting me stay in the Academy.”

Gilbert looked at Chiffon with gentle eyes as he patted her head. “Sorry, child. We have been unfair to you. Be careful on your journey, and come back safely. We will be waiting for your return.”

“Thank you, Headmaster.”

“You’re welcome.”

William held Chiffon’s hand, as both of them walked out of the gate of the academy. They had already said their goodbyes to Ashe and Princess Sidonie, who were currently sleeping in their rooms. Just like William, both of them were quite exhausted due to their night of skinship.

“Come out, Raiden,” William ordered.

A Black Qilin who was three-meters tall, and five meters long, appeared in front of William. It was radiating the presence of a Millennial Beast, and Chiffon wasn’t able to stop herself from clinging to William’s arm.

“It’s fine, he just looks scary, but he’s harmless.” William patted Chiffon’s head before lifting her up to ride on the Qilin’s back. After the little girl was secured in place, William sat behind her and wrapped his arms firmly on her waist.

“Let’s go, Raiden,” William ordered. “To infinity and beyond!”

Gilbert watched as the Black Qilin rose in the air and flew towards the East. They were headed to the first town that would allow them to use the Teleportation Gates that were specially designated for those who planned to go to the Tower of Babylon.

The Headmaster of Silverwind Academy didn’t know if he would see the Half-Elf again. However, after observing William for a few months, he realized that the boy seemed to have the tendency to make the impossible possible.
