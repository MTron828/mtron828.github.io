Kingdom of Quince…

Kieron, the King of Quince was leisurely sipping a glass of wine on the balcony of his Royal Palace.

"Everything is so peaceful." Kieron sighed as he enjoyed the aftertaste of the best wine in his Kingdom. 

In front of him, the majestic view of the capital city of Quince, Farhan, spread far and wide. He had seen this view countless times in the past, but even now, he still felt as if he was sitting on top of the world as he looked down on the city from the balcony of his palace.

"Has there been any news about that fart Alexis?" Kieron asked. "It has been three days since that so-called Emperor from the Central Continent arrived, right?"

"Our spies said that the Flying Ship is still docked at the City of Nivale," the King's aide replied. "There has been no news about what King Alexis and the Half-Elf had talked about."

"Hah!" Kieron scoffed. "If I don't know any better, I bet that Alexis is scheming something again. Hmp! Knowing him, he'd probably send trouble coming my way."

Kieron was quite annoyed after he heard the news that the red-headed Emperor went to the Kingdom of Edelweiss alongside the three Demigods, Ifrit, Henkhisesui, and Silenus. 

The Demigods very rarely left their Domains, and whenever they did, a series of unfortunate events would befall any kingdom they visited.

However, it had been three days since the red-headed Emperor had arrived, and the Kingdom of Edelweiss remained peaceful. 

Kieron had been smiling ear to ear when he heard that the three calamities had arrived at the Kingdom of Edelweiss, but his good mood disappeared when no news of destruction reached his ears.

'Just what are those Demigods doing?' Kieron thought. 'Can't they do something good for once and smash that bastard, Alexis', capital city?'

Just as Kieron was about to refill his wine cup, the sound of something breaking reverberated in the surroundings. 

The King of Quince immediately stood up as he looked at the sky in disbelief. 

From that crack, over a hundred Giants descended, and crash landed two miles away from the city walls. 

The wine glass in Kieron's hand fell on the ground, breaking into dozens of pieces. The King of Quince stared in disbelief, as these towering monstrosities started to walk towards his city, with the intention of razing it to the ground.

"Sounds the alarm!" Kieron shouted as he pointed his scepter towards the city gates. 

Immediately a barrier enveloped the entire city, shielding it from the sudden invasion that had appeared out of nowhere.

The sound of tolling bells spread across the City of Farhan, as its citizens wondered what was happening. However, their confusion was replaced by fear when they saw a giant boulder smashing against the barrier of their city, sparking wide-spread panic among the crowd.

"Giants!" a man on the street shouted. "We are being attacked by Giants!"

It was then when the people saw hundreds of Hippogriffs rise from the city barracks and fly towards the city walls in order to stop the Giant's advance before they could even reach the city.

Officers shouted their orders from the sky, telling the people to head to the nearest shelters to hide.

The Western Continent wasn't that peaceful several hundred years ago. 

Wars were always happening somewhere on the continent, so each Kingdom had prepared emergency shelters in case that their capital cities were sieged. 

Now that a threat had come knocking on their doorstep, the defenders of Quince took up arms in order to repel the Giants that were advancing towards their city at a leisurely pace. A few of them picked up giant boulders along the way and hurled them at the barrier, as if to scare the people, who were currently being herded to the shelters.

Kieron, who had given the orders to evacuate the civilians, hurried inside the castle to put on his Royal Regalia. 

Right now, he needed to inspire his soldiers by fighting alongside them in the battlefield. 

A few minutes later, a Gryphon soared towards the sky, and on its back was the King of Quince, prepared to do battle.

Originally, he thought that the giants were only Millennial Ranked. However, after gauging their strength from the sky, his face immediately turned pale when he realized that the majority of them were Myriad Ranked.

However, that was the least of his problems.

At the center of the Giant's formation was a giant, whose eyes were burning with a blue hue.

Just a glance was enough to tell Kieron that this giant was the leader of this invasion.

Thousands of soldiers had already positioned themselves on top of the city walls, as Archers and Mages prepared to unleash their attacks, the moment the giants came within firing range.

The barrier of the city had a unique feature. It allowed internal attacks to pass through the barrier, while negating external attacks completely. This was made by the first founder of Quince, who was a Saint-Ranked Runemaster, allowing his city to resist the siege of the Kingdoms that threatened its rule.

"Steady!" Kieron ordered his soldiers as his Gryphon hovered behind the city walls. Just like his men, he was waiting for the right moment to engage their attackers in ranged combat. 

"Now! Open Fire!"

Thousands of arrows, and hundreds of spells rained down on the giants who were walking towards the city as if they were just taking a stroll.

Loud explosions were heard everywhere as the spells landed on the giants at the very front of the formation. 

Dark smoke blocked everyone's view, but that didn't deter the defenders and they continued to fire arrow after arrow, and hurled spell after spell. 

"Halt!" Kieron ordered, and his soldiers also stopped attacking.

The King of Quince narrowed his eyes as he gazed at the thick black smoke that was blocking everyone's view. He wanted to know if the countless attacks decimated their opponents, but his hopes were crushed when several figures passed through the black smoke, holding giant swords, axes, and war clubs.

Kieron's face paled when he saw the sneering faces of the giants who now started to run towards their city, making the ground, and the defenders' hearts tremble.

"Attack!" Kieron roared. "Do not let them enter the city!"

All the soldiers gritted their teeth as they once again unleashed a barrage of arrows and spells at the Monsters, who were shrugging off an attack that could already decimate Human armies. 

Unfortunately, they weren't fighting Humans, but Giants, whose strength far surpassed the defenders that were stationed in the city.

Kieron watched in horror as the vanguard of the Giant Army started hacking away at the barrier protecting the city, making it tremble with each strike. 

Shouts of fear rang out among the ranks of soldiers as they forced themselves to hold their ground and continue to use their strongest attacks in order to kill the enemies that were staring down at them as if they were ants, waiting to be trampled.

Suddenly, a cracking sound was heard, which made Kieron, as well as the soldiers defending their city, feel as if all of their blood had turned cold.

A moment later, the barrier that was holding the Giant Army at bay creaked, before shattering into thousands of pieces.

"... No."

A single word was muttered helplessly by one of the soldiers on top of the city walls, and yet, this was the collective thought of everyone facing the Giants, who were now poised to demolish, and annihilate everything that stood in their way.
