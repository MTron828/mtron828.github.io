Chapter 1084 Give Him To Me, And I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll Let All Of You Live

"No‚Ä¶. How can this be?" Celeste uttered in disbelief as she looked in front of her.

A Demon with long, platinum blonde hair and red eyes looked at her with an indifferent expression from where he stood.

Behind him, an army that numbered in the tens of thousands stood, with their flags fluttering in the wind.

"Took you brats long enough," the Demon Lord, Luciel, said in a cold and indifferent voice filled with confidence.

Just as soon as William's entourage broke past the dome of darkness, the first thing that they saw was the Demon Lord holding a giant greatsword in his hands.

Standing beside him were two Demigods.

On his left, was El Sibon, who had attacked William in the North when the Half-Elf tried to exterminate the Gremory Clan's stronghold. The Demon eyed the unconscious William, as the corner of its mouth curled up into a smirk.

Very few individuals were able to escape his grasp, but, in the end, El Sibon was still able to kill them all. The Demigod had no doubt in his mind that, today, he would add another skeleton to his collection.

On Luciel's right side, a giant ape‚Äìlike creature with a single eye on its head looked down on them. On its chest was a gaping mouth filled with razor sharp teeth. It was none other than the Demigod that ruled over the West side of the Demon Realm. The Monster, Mapinguari.

"Baba Yaga, I think you're standing on the wrong side," Luciel said with a sneer. "Shouldn't you be on our side?"

"Boy, I've been around since before you sucked your mother's tits," Baba Yaga scoffed the Demon Lord's disrespectful words towards her. "So what if you have those two dumb dumbs beside you? Do you really think that I can't smash your face when I feel like it?"

"True," Luciel admitted. "But, I'm fairly confident that you will not be able to smash my face to death. How about this, I will allow you to switch sides while I'm still in the mood. What do you think?"

The old witch raised the pestle in her hand and pointed it in Luciel's direction. "I think, I have heard enough of your bullsh*t! If you want to fight then a fight you shall get!"

Baba Yaga had long been enduring the hatred in her heart after her Disciple had been taken away from her. She was unable to fight against the Bull Demon King and his cohorts because she wasn't their match, but looking at the smugness on the Demon Lord's face rekindled the anger that she had been silently enduring in her heart.

It was at that moment when Chloee passed through the barrier. She then flew towards her people's side, and stood beside Celeste, facing the Demon Army. Just like everyone else, she had also been shocked at the scene that she saw as soon as she had escaped the dome of darkness.

Right now, she was unable to use her full powers because she was on borrowed time. At most, she could only exert 30% of her strength, which was only equivalent to that of a Millenial Beast.

Even so, the blonde-haired fairy didn't back down. Her body radiated with killing intent as she took a fighting stance, ready to attack at any given moment.

Not long after, three more creatures passed through the dome of darkness and they were none other than Psoglav, Erchitu, and Jareth. All of them landed in front of the Black Qilin, protecting their Master from Luciel's determined gaze.

"Where is Kasogonaga?" Lilith asked as she looked at the trio in front of her.

"He stayed behind to hold off our pursuers," Erchitu replied. "He will rejoin us shortly."

"I see‚Ä¶" Lilith didn't ask any more questions. She understood what Erchitu was trying to say, and it made her bite her lip in frustration.

A low growl escaped Psoglav's jaws as he stared hatefully at the Demon Army in front of him. Right now, the Demonic Dog wished for nothing more than to tear the Demons' bodies apart so he could drink their blood, and eat their flesh.

"Give him to me, and I'll let all of you live," Luciel declared. "At most, the rest of you will become slaves, but your lives will be spared. That is still a better fate than dying, no?"

Luciel eyed Celeste's beautiful figure, as well as the Elves that were currently glaring at him from on top of their winged horses. He could feel the hate that was emanating from their bodies, but the Demon Lord simply didn't care about their feelings.

For him. Women were just tools to be used in order to breed children.

Exceptional women would give birth to exceptional children. This was why he had tasked his men to kidnap the genius ladies of the different races in order to bring them back to the Demon Realm, where they would live their new lives as broodmares.

Even the Demons that were standing behind their Lord, eyed the beauties in front of them. All of them could tell that they were exceptional women, and worthy of being taken captive for their race's future.

Luciel once again shifted his attention towards the unconscious Half-Elf who was currently in the embrace of the Amazon Princess.

"I will ask you one last time. Give that boy to me," Luciel said without a trace of mercy. "My patience has its limit."

Lilith glared at the Demon Lord as she firmly gripped Gleipnir in her right hand.

"The only way you can take him from me is over my dead body," Lilith declared. "I will not let you have him."

"Such a pity," Luciel shrugged. "Don't worry. I have no intention of killing you. You still have your uses, Princess. I'm sure that your mother will be more than willing to negotiate as long as you are my hostage."

"In your dreams!"

"Foolish girl. I prefer reality over dreams. After all, only in the real world can I crush my opponents and feel their warm blood staining my hands. That Half-Elf will pay for the crimes of his father. Don't worry, I will let you personally witness how I deal with him."

"Don't let him rile you up, girl," Baba Yaga's voice reached her ears. "That bastard still hasn't changed his sick hobby of playing mind games with his enemies. Don't worry, as long as I'm here, I won't let him touch any of you."

Luciel smirked after hearing Baba Yaga's words. He was about to order an attack when he sensed several fluctuations in the air.

"Finally, we caught up with these hateful insects!" Princess Iron Fan shouted as she eyed Psoglav from where she hovered in the sky. "That mutt is mine. The rest of you can find your own playthings."

Psoglav ignored Princess Iron Fan's words because his single eye was locked on the Bull Demon King's hand. A choked sob escaped his lips as the Demonic Dog's gaze landed on the bloody creature that the Demonic Bull was holding in his hand.

Even from a distance, he could tell that the rainbow-colored Anteater was no longer breathing. Several of its scales were missing from its back, and blood covered its entire body. Blood still dripped from Kasogonaga's mouth as its body hung limply in the Bull Demon King's hand.

Psoglav growled with anger and resentment. He no longer cared if he would live to see the next sunrise. All he cared about was fighting tooth and nail against the Bull Demon King, as well as his wife, Princess Iron Fan, for what they did to his friend.

Erchitu and Jareth both summoned their weapons and held them firmly in their hands. Although they didn't say anything, they were feeling the same way as Psoglav. F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

If they were going to die today, they would rather die fighting with everything they had, than bow down and grovel at their enemies' feet. They would never do that. They would rather die than submit!

That was the least they could do for their friend who had fought for their sake, in order to give them time to escape.

"Come at me, you ugly b*tch!" Psoglav roared in defiance. "I am right here! Come and get me!"

For the first time in his life, Psoglav didn't feel fearful of fighting an opponent that was leagues above his rank. His anger burned brightly inside his chest as his single eye remained locked on his friend's bloody body as it continued to dangle in the Bull Demon King's hand.

'Wait for me, Kasogonaga,' Psoglav vowed. 'I know that you get lonely easily. Don't worry. I will be joining you in the afterlife soon.'

The Demonic Dog summoned a giant sword of darkness in his hand as he faced his hated enemies. Psoglav knew that before this day was over, this battle would come to an end.

He only hoped that when he crossed the afterlife, the friends that he had shared many memorable moments with, would be waiting for him at the crossroads between life and death.
