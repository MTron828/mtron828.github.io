Chapter 536: Sweeter Than Lollipops

Inside the Kraetor Royal Palace…

“You’ve been praising him a lot since you returned here to the Empire,” Emperor Leonidas said. “At first I thought that you were just exaggerating. But now, I’m starting to think that your praise is well deserved.”

Evexius, the Grand Archmage of the Kraetor Empire, bowed his head respectfully. “Your Majesty, that boy is someone we should bring to our side. His potential is limitless.”

Emperor Leonidas tapped the side of his armchair as he looked outside the window. He didn’t agree or disagree with Evexius’ proposal, but the Grand Archmage knew that the Emperor had agreed with him.

“That Domain is going to open in three months.” Emperor Leonidas stared at Evexius. “The top finalists in the tournament will participate in exploring that domain. If he becomes one of the finalists, I will consider your suggestion.”

Evexius nodded. “Your Majesty, I only have one concern.”

“Yes?”

“It’s Prince Jason. He is in love with Princess Sidonie. I’m afraid that he might do something reckless and provoke William.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Mmm.” Emperor Leonidas hummed as he leaned on his chair. “You may go, Evexius. Whatever happens between Jason, and that boy, William, is something that they have to settle between themselves.”

“Y-Your Majesty, you mean?”

“Nothing is settled yet. It will depend on both of their performances in the upcoming tournament. Also, His Excellency Aamon, is expecting that boy’s visit to his temple.”

Evexius frowned, but didn’t say anything. It was not his place to ask what their God wanted from the boy. The only thing he cared about was the continuous prosperity of the Kraetor Empire.

“Hey, Shepherd, looks like you did well in the Assessment Test,” Prince Jason said as he walked up towards William’s and Princess Sidonie’s table.

The Half-Elf turned his head to look at the Prince before raising one of his eyebrows.

“And you are?” William asked.

The corner of Prince Jason’s lips twitched because of the Half-Elf’s unexpected reply. They were currently in the Kraetor Empire, and he was its Fifth Prince. Also, they had met several times back in the Southern Continent, and William was pretending that he didn’t know him?

Absurd!

Princess Sidonie lowered her head, because she was doing her best to suppress a giggle from escaping her lips. William really knew how to get on people’s nerves. The Half-Elf had probably known that Prince Jason was after his woman.

Since that was the case, he didn’t need to be civil with him. Even if he was the Prince of the Kraetor Empire.

“Surely you jest?” Prince Jason said with a smile. “How can you possibly not know me?”

“Are you famous then?” William asked back. “I don’t really know who you are. Can you please introduce yourself to me?”

The lively tavern became silent as everyone listened to William’s and Prince Jason’s conversation. Everyone was thinking the same thing.

‘How could you possibly not know the name of our Prince?’

Suddenly a loud laughter reverberated inside the room. The First Prince of the Kraetor Empire, Prince Maximilian, laughed heartily as he looked at William from his table. This was the first time that he had seen someone toying with Prince Jason, and it raised his impression of the red-headed teenager drastically.

“William, was it?” Prince Maximilian raised his winecup after his laughter ended. “I toast to your good health.”

William raised his own winecup with a smile. “It is my honor for Prince Maximilian to know my lowly name. May your Highness live a long and happy life.”

“”Cheers!””

Both teenagers raised their winecup and drank its contents happily. There was a famous saying that the enemy of your enemy is your friend. Since it was very obvious that both of them treated Prince Jason as their enemy, they would stick together as allies.

“Are you still going to act dumb, Shepherd?” Prince Jason inquired. “You know the name of the First Prince, and you don’t know mine?”

He was currently doing his best to stop himself from throwing his wine cup at the irritating Half-Elf who was mocking him on purpose.

“Sorry, but I only know famous people,” William replied with an apologetic expression. “Prince Maximilian is the First Prince of the Kraetor Empire and held the highest record in the previous Assessment Test. A celebrity like him is well known by everyone. Um, let’s go back to the topic. Who are you again?”

Another loud laughter from the First Prince erupted and it grated in Prince Jason’s ears. If not for the fact that there were many witnesses inside the Tavern, he would have already engaged William in a duel.

In the end, the Fifth Prince of the Kraetor Empire held his irritation back and decided to play along with the Half-Elf’s game.

“Listen, I am the Fifth Prince of the Kraetor Empire,” Prince Jason said with veiled contempt. “Jason Hal Kraetor.”

“Chiffon, you should eat more vegetables, instead of eating only meat.” William placed a few carrot sticks on Chiffon’s plate, while the latter nodded her head obediently. “I want you to grow up as a beautiful lady in the future, so you need to eat a balanced diet. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Big Brother,” Chiffon replied. “I will do as you say.”

“Good girl. Um, what did you say your name was again?” William asked as he shifted his attention back to Prince Jason, whose hand was already on the hilt of his dagger.

“You, Bastard! Stop messing around!” Prince Jason shouted and his aura exploded around him.

A powerful gust of wind blew away the tables near him, including the nobles’ tables, who were watching the scene with dumbfounded faces. The Fifth Prince was about to lunge towards William to beat the crap out of him, but two people grabbed both of his arms and held him in place.

“Cousin, get a hold of yourself!” Prince Maximilian warned as he held Prince Jason’s right arm firmly. “Remember where we are. If news of this spreads, your reputation will suffer.”

The Third Prince of the Kraetor Empire, Kevin Hal Kraetor, grabbed Prince Jason’s left arm to prevent him from making a bigger scene.

“He’s right, Cousin,” Prince Kevin commented. “If the Emperor got wind of this, you might get punished for endangering the lives of the other nobles.”

Prince Kevin had already placed a magical circle around the three of them to prevent anyone from listening to their conversations. Although there were some people that were capable of lip reading, since most noble children weren’t taught this skill by their parents.

Prince Jason forcefully reigned in his anger, and stopped struggling. He gave the Half-Elf one last glare before telling his cousins to release him.

Prince Maximilian and Prince Kevin let go of his arms, but remained where they were. Although they would like to see Prince Jason make a fool of himself, it would reflect badly on them if news of the Fifth Prince Rampage was to reach the ears of the Emperor and their parents.

Since they were at the scene, they were duty bound to stop Prince Jason’s reckless actions to preserve the dignity of the Royal Family. Not doing anything would definitely make the Emperor become disappointed in them, and this was something that they didn’t want to happen.

Prince Jason turned around to leave the Tavern before he totally lost control of his remaining reason. His lackeys hurriedly followed behind him, but none of them dared to talk to him, or walk near him.

Only fools would do that, and they were not fools.

“You really are something, Sir William.” Prince Maximilian praised. “I have heard great things about you. The Hero that had protected his Kingdom from an Elven Invasion, truly a man of the times. I wish that I can be someone like you.”

“Hahaha! You praise me too much, Your Highness,” William replied as he scratched his head. “Feel free to praise me more.”

The corner of Prince Maximilian’s, and Prince Kevin’s, lips twitched after hearing William’s reply. The First Prince thought that he could settle the conflict by praising the red-headed teenager. However, he underestimated William’s shamelessness.

‘What a shameless person!’

This was the thought of everyone in the room, including the Two Princes, who were now regretting their earlier action of stopping Prince Jason from beating the crap out of William.

Princess Sidonie and Ian exchanged a glance as their bodies shook from trying to hold back their laughter.

Chiffon, on the other hand, was busy eating the carrot sticks that William had given her. Although she preferred eating William’s lollipops, any food in between was fine with her.

‘Big Brother sure is nice,’ Chiffon thought as he looked at the Half-Elf who was now putting some meat pieces on her plate. ‘Is this what it’s like to have a Big Brother?’

Chiffon had older brothers, and sisters, as well. However, they paid her no attention. They avoided her at all times, and didn’t even want to be in the same place as her.

While she was reminiscing these depressing thoughts, she felt a hand brush the top of her head.

“What’s wrong? Are you not hungry anymore?” William asked in a teasing voice.

Chiffon raised her head to look at the Half-Elf who was looking at her with a gentle gaze. Suddenly a thought came to her mind as her heart beated wildly inside her chest.

‘I wonder what Big Brother tastes like…,’ Chiffon thought. ‘Will he be as sweet as the lollipops he gives me daily, or will he be sweeter?’

The little girl didn’t know the answers to her question. She hoped that one day, she would get to taste it. The taste of the Half-Elf who was currently patting her head with a smile.
