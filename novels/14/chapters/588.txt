Chapter 588: Nothing Is Permanent. Not Even The End Of The World

A few minutes before Chiffon transformed into a Giant…

“Big Brother, just beat them up!” Chiffon shouted. “Don’t worry about me!”

The High-Rankers that held her snorted and dislocated her right arm. The pink-haired girl bit her lip to prevent herself from crying out loud. She immediately disconnected her sense of pain from her consciousness, like she did in the past when her father, brother, and sisters beat her up in the Demonic Continent.

‘Why? Must it always be like this?’ Chiffon cried internally as the High-Ranker dislocated her right arm.

Although she wasn’t feeling any pain, her heart was aching due to the trouble that she had brought upon William. She felt so helpless being used as a hostage against her will.

“Let her go or else,” William stated.

Chiffon watched as the Half-Elf, whom she had called her Big Brother, unleashed a powerful Aura that created a shockwave around him. She rarely saw William getting angry, but when he did, it was always about some people trying to hurt her.

“Or else what?” The High-Ranker holding Chiffon sneered and dislocated her left arm.

Chiffon’s lips trembled because she could tell that William was about to explode from anger. She was about to tell William to just attack their enemies without worrying about her. However, before she could voice out her thoughts, she found herself standing in a gray world that seemed to be in ruins.

“Child, we finally meet again.”

A voice that was familiar and unfamiliar at the same time sounded behind her. Chiffon hurriedly turned around, and saw a lady wearing shining light-weight armor, adorned in silver and gold.

She couldn’t see the lady’s face because she was wearing a veil. However, Chiffon could somehow tell that the person in front of her was a very beautiful woman.

“Who are you?” Chiffon inquired. “Where am I?”

The lady approached Chiffon until they were only a meter apart from each other.

“Who I am is not important,” the lady replied. “I came here to ask you, what is your wish?”

“W-Wish?”

“Yes. A wish. It can be anything. I was supposed to grant this wish many lifetimes ago, but an opportunity never presented itself… until now.”

The lady wearing a veil looked down at Chiffon and caressed the side of her face.

“Go on, what is the thing that you want the most in this world?” the lady asked. “I will grant your wish, no matter what it is.”

“I want…” Chiffon raised her head and held the lady’s clothes. She didn’t understand what was going on, but if this lady could grant her wish then she would believe in her words.

“I want to always be by Big Brother’s side,” Chiffon pleaded. “I want to have the strength to remain by Big Brother’s side.”

The lady giggled. “Very well. I will grant this wish of yours. However, this power that once belonged to you, is very unstable. I will allow you to use it only once, and I will seal it afterwards.

“Do not fret, you will be able to use it again in the future when you finally understand the feelings inside your heart. After all, you will need this power in order to face the person that will once again destroy everything that William holds dear in his heart.”

Before Chiffon could ask what the lady meant, the lady’s hand that was caressing the side of her face glowed. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In that instant, Chiffon saw herself standing on a chaotic battlefield where Giants, beasts, and men, fought against each other, while the world around them crumbled. The sky fell in pieces from the heavens and the earth collapsed under their feet.

At the center of that battlefield, a Giant holding a flaming sword roared in anger. Facing off against him was a man. A man whom Chiffon knew too well. The only difference was that this man didn’t have pointy ears and his hair wasn’t red, but white.

The man was swept away during their clash, because the Giant was far too powerful for him to face headon. Before the man could even stand up from the ground, the Giant slashed down with the intention to kill.

Chiffon found herself running, while shouting that man’s name. No matter what happens, she couldn’t allow the Giant to kill the man in front of her because he was the most important person in her life.

Just as the sword was about to strike the man, a Valkyrie appeared and blocked it using a silver spear that shone in the darkness. Her golden blonde hair fluttered in the breeze, and her fearless eyes, filled with determination, held back the giant’s onslaught for a few seconds, before she was swatted away like a rag doll.

The Giant once again posed to strike, but this time, Chiffon had already arrived in front of it. Using her bare hands, she caught the flaming sword that was about to kill the most important person in her life.

Her hands started to blaze, but she never let go of the sword, fearing that everything would be over once she did.

A few seconds later, the flames spread to her arms, and her entire body. It was painful, and she was scared, but the fear of losing him overwhelmed all the fears she had.

“Nothing is permanent,” the lady whispered in Chiffon’s ears. “Not even the end of the World.”

“Stop!” the High-Ranker that was holding Chiffon shouted. “If Xander is killed, we will kill this girl too!”

Chiffon felt like laughing when she heard the man’s words. Him? Kill her? How could a puny mortal possibly kill her? Better yet, how could a puny mortal dare to use her as a hostage?

The pink-haired girl found all of this very laughable. Compared to the burning flames that had the power to destroy worlds, this man’s threat was the greatest joke she had heard in both her lifetimes.

Chiffon raised her head. She’d had enough of this nonsense. It was time to end this farce.

“The one who is going to die are the two of you,” Chiffon said in a voice that was as cold as ice.

Chiffon harnessed the power that laid dormant inside her. Her dislocated arms righted themselves, and her body grew in size. She then opened her mouth wide and devoured the two puny mortals who dared to use her as hostage.

It was time for them to know that they had made a mistake. A grave, and terrible mistake. Chiffon crushed their bodies with her teeth easily, despite the fact that they were wearing armor.

‘As expected of trash,’ Chiffon thought. ‘They taste like trash.’

Chiffon swallowed the two men and set her sights on the person nearest her.

‘Not enough,’ Chiffon’s body moved to follow her bidding. ‘I want more… I want more!’

Chiffon laughed as she ran towards her target. She was feeling very hungry. It was as if she hadn’t eaten for thousands of years.

Fortunately, there were plenty of people around her. She will eat them first, before setting her sights on her prize.

Out of all the people that were in that God Forsaken Place, Chiffon knew, without a doubt, the most delicious one of them all… was the red-headed teenager, who was looking at her with genuine worry in his eyes.
