Chapter 600: The Smile Of A Devil

Chiffon couldn’t understand what was going on.

One minute she was standing beside her Big Brother, the next second she was seated on a chair with a belt that held her in place.

William’s chuckle reached her ears as the Gandamn charged fearlessly towards the dozens of Myriad Beasts that he was supposed to fight.

A monster that looked similar to Godzilla roared at the Giant Robot and released a firebreath.

William sneered as he moved the joysticks in his controller, and evaded the monster’s attack with ease.

‘System, tell me all the weapons that we have right now and how to use them,’ William ordered.

[ Understood. ]

Right now, William was just testing the speed of the Gandamn as he maneuvered in the terrain. Several magical attacks flew in his direction, but he easily dodged all of them. Seeing that their attacks weren’t working, the Myriad Beasts decided to engage William in close combat.

It was also at that moment when the System finished analyzing the Giant Robot that William was currently controlling.

[ Finished Analyzing Gandamn’s Weaponry ]

[ Beam Sabers ]

[ Plasma Beam Cannons ]

[ Railguns ]

[ Beam Rifle ]

[ Vulkhans ]

[ Chest Gatling Guns ]

[ Homing Missiles ]

[ Would the host like to synchronize with the Gandamn for maximum performance? ]

[ Yes / No ]

William didn’t think twice and agreed with the synchronization. Right after the System successfully established the connection between William and the Gandamn, the red-headed teenager felt like the entire Giant Robot had become his body.

He knew exactly well its capabilities, and the proper usage and range of its weapons. After that brief relay of information in his brain, the smile on William’s face widened.

“I’ve always wanted to try this once,” William thought as a seed seemed to sprout in his consciousness. It was some kind of awakening that it was hard to describe.

Immediately, his concentration drastically increased and his senses encompassed the entire battlefield.

The System had automatically “Locked On” the Myriad Beasts that were approaching him and just waiting for William’s order.

“Beam Rifle and Railguns, open fire!” William shouted as he pressed the buttons on his controller.

Several laser beams erupted from the Gandamn. The Myriad Beasts had no time to avoid and their heads exploded like watermelons.

“I’m not done yet!” William took out the Gandamn’s Beam Sabers and attacked the remaining Myriad Beasts in close combat.

With a slash, he cut off the head of a Black-Scaled Sabertooth Tiger that was five meters tall. The Sabertooth Tiger was fast, but it was not as fast as William’s Giant Robot which had rocket boosters attached on its back.

Seeing that her Monster Army was decreasing at an alarming pace, Marissa hurriedly summoned more. She couldn’t believe what was happening. In the past, a single Myriad Beast was enough to scare away the players who were unlucky enough to have her as their examiner.

Now, she summoned over thirty Myriad Beasts in order to trample William’s and Chiffon’s chances of clearing the trial. However, the scene that was playing in front of her eyes was a far cry to what she had envisioned in her mind.

“T-This is not happening,” Marissa stuttered. “What is that thing?!”

Xanhast was also in awe of what he was witnessing first hand. This was the first time he was seeing such a thing and it broke his common sense.

However, as the direct descendants of the Colton Family, they couldn’t afford to back down. Their battle was being displayed outside of the Trial Grounds, and everyone was able to see the battle in real time.

The Players that had left earlier couldn’t stop their mouths from opening wide. Some of them were even paying extra close to William’s Gandamn, in the hope that they would be able to create it as well in order to pass their trials.

“Sister, focus on summoning Land Beasts,” Xanhast ordered. “I will summon Aerial Beasts.”

Marissa wasn’t someone that liked being ordered, but right now, she was not in the right state to argue with her brother. She just nodded her head and summoned all the Millennial, and Myriad Beasts that their family had recorded for the past thousands of years.

Soon, over a thousand Beasts appeared on the battlefield. Half of them were flying in the air, and the others were on the ground trying to get as close as possible to the fast moving robot.

Oogwei, Xod, and Yves, who were watching William’s and Chiffon’s journey, couldn’t believe what they were seeing. The cucumber that the little turtle had already bitten fell out of its mouth due to how shocked it was.

The other Guardians were also looking at the Gandamn with fascination. They hadn’t seen anything like it even in their own worlds. Because of this, they gave the battle in the Floor of Creation their undivided attention.

If other people were to see the powerful beasts in front of them, they would probably faint. However, William just roared in laughter.

“Good! More target practice!” William pressed the triangle button on his controller and the homing missiles on the Gandamn’s back, and feet flew towards their target.

Millennial Beasts?

Myriad Beasts?

So what?

How could they possibly win against high-tier weapons that could even destroy space colonies?

The Gandamn held the two beam rifles in his hand and merged them together, creating the Buster Cannon, which was as strong as a battleship main cannon. The two plasma beam cannons protruding behind the Giant Robot’s back also activated and aimed at the monsters in front of it.

“Buster Cannons, Fire!” William roared and three powerful beams of light shot out from the tips of the weapons in his arsenal.

The monsters that the beams hit disintegrated, as well as those that were behind their back. William moved the cannons sideways, and the laser beams decimated everything it hit in a straight line.

Its firepower was truly unbelievable. Perhaps, if William had the Gandamn during the war in the Southern Continent, the Elves wouldn’t have stood a chance, even if they had their Guardians with them.

Perhaps, the Immortal Phoenix, Sepheron, would be the only one to survive such destructive power and that was only a possibility. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Marissa and Xanhast had to cover their eyes due to the intensity of the light that almost blinded them.

When the light receded, only ruins remained. All the monsters had vanished leaving only the brother and sister standing in place.

Marissa and Xanhast watched as the Giant Robot landed a few meters away from them. The cockpit on its chest opened up, revealing William with a big smile on his face.

“Please, summon more!” William pleaded. “I still haven’t played enough.”

Marissa’s eyes rolled up into their sockets when she heard William’s requests. Creating beasts was no easy feat because it required strong mental power. After summoning hundreds of them, the pretty girl had reached her limit, and William’s carefree words gave the finishing blow.

Xanhast hurriedly caught his little sister and sighed internally. He then looked up at the Half-Elf that was smiling down on them.

The eldest son of the current Patriarch of the Colton Clan hadn’t seen the Devil Race yet. However, after looking at William’s delighted expression, he believed that if the rumored Devil Race existed, they would definitely look like the Half-Elf, whose devilish smile made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.
