Chapter 353: The Sin Of Lust

A pained shriek reverberated inside Antheilm as the Golden Millennial Ant’s body slammed against the cavern wall. The other Millennial Ant didn’t fare any better as it too helplessly flew backwards after receiving an uppercut from the rainbow-colored wrecking ball.

Morgana, who stood at the center of the two Golden Ants, was caught by surprise. She brandished her whip to hit the curled up beast that she had never seen before, but the latter was quite nimble and evaded all of her attacks with ease.

One could even say that Kasogonaga didn’t even consider her a threat because Morgana’s fighting ability was only around Silver Rank. This was equivalent to a Grade D Beast, which was far beneath the rainbow-colored anteater’s rank.

William had also noticed this point, so he ignored Morgana and immediately dealt with Priscilla who was still in a daze due to the power of Morgana’s charm spell.

All it took was a quick and accurate jab to her lower jaw and Priscilla crumpled like a marionette that had lost its strings.

“Sorry, I have no other choice,” William said as he kept the black-haired beauty’s body from falling to the ground.

Although he knew that Priscilla’s loyalty belonged to the Princess of Freesia, she was still his Vice-Commander. Also, Priscilla hadn’t done anything to harm him. For William, it didn’t matter if she had been a spy and reported his information to her Kingdom.

He was not worried about their information gathering because no matter how much information they gathered about him, half of it would be wrong most of the time. This was especially true when it came to his abilities and fighting prowess.

“What are you doing?! Kill that beast, now!” Morgana ordered the two Millennial Beasts as she summoned eight Nightmare Ant Commanders.

These were the Centennial-Ranked Beasts that the Second Prince of Anaesha, Prince Aziel, had summoned during his battle with William.

“Beat that hateful Half-Elf for me, but don’t kill him!” Morgana pointed at William with a hateful glare.

She couldn’t understand why the two Millennial Ants by her side were being helplessly toyed around with by the strange Beast who seemed to be William’s ally. Those were two Millennial Beasts, not some low-ranked monsters, but they couldn’t hold a candle against a measly Anteater who wasn’t even in the Centennial Rank!

Morgana couldn’t believe it. She refused to accept it!

“Ah, these guys again,” William muttered while still holding the unconscious Priscilla in his arms.

He then waved his hand. A blast of cold air permeated around him. Although the Ants were stronger than him, that didn’t necessarily mean that he had no way of dealing with them.

“Icycle Realm!” Wiliam shouted.

A few seconds later several ice spikes jutted out from the ground, covering the entire cavern in a domain of razor sharp ice shards.

The Centennial Ants immediately gathered around Morgana to protect her from William’s sudden attack. The Half-Elf knew that once he subdued Morgana, the ants would also stop attacking him.

“Kasogonaga, didn’t anyone tell you that it’s bad manners to play with your food?” William yelled as he focused his attention on strengthening his Icycle Domain.

“Che!” The Kasogonaga understood that now was not the time to play, so it immediately wrapped its tongue around one of the Millennial Ants and swallowed it whole.

Morgana’s face paled when she saw how the Anteater had easily eaten the Millennial Beast as if it was just eating candy!

‘Impossible!’ Morgana was in a state of denial. ‘This is impossible! How can this be?!’

As if to prove that what she was seeing was real, the Rainbow Anteater grabbed the other Millennial Ant with its tongue before it could borrow into the ground to escape. The Golden Ant shrieked in unwillingness and in fear as its entire body was swallowed whole by the rainbow-colored Anteater who was only half a meter tall.

The Centennial Ants that were protecting Sidonie shuddered when the Anteater’s gaze fell upon them. Their instincts were telling them that no matter how much they resisted, their fate was sealed the moment the Kasogonaga appeared in front of them.

“Do you still want to continue?” William inquired. “My friend here has a very short temper. If you annoy it, it will swallow you whole!”

Kasogonaga glared at William, but it also understood that the boy was just bluffing. As someone that had protected Humanity during the Era of the Gods, the Anteater wouldn’t attack Humans unless it was for self defense.

Morgana had lost her composure after hearing that the Anteater would swallow her as well. Although she was still half in doubt, she didn’t want to gamble with her life.

Her fighting ability was nearly non-existent. She had been too used to hiding behind the backs of her pets and hadn’t considered fighting on the front lines. For the first time in their lives, Morgana and Princess Sidonie questioned their own ability to take control of the lives of others.

Due to her connection with the Ant Queen, she could tell that the Centennial Ants protecting her were struggling to keep themselves from running away in fear. The beautiful seductress glanced at the Anteater that was currently drooling, as it looked at the Centennial Ants around her.

She was afraid that if she was too stubborn and ignored William’s proposal, the adorable looking Beast would swallow her along with the ants.

“I… concede,” Morgana said through gritted teeth. “You won.”

Hearing the Princess’ reply, William waved his hand and the Icycle Field disappeared completely. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Princess, know that I am not our enemy,” William commented as he looked at Morgana with a serious expression. “I have heard what happened in Ravenlord Citadel. Although I am a citizen of the Hellan Kingdom, I do not agree with the Prince’s methods. Actually, I am also currently fighting The Organization that is backing him.”

Morgana’s ears perked up when she heard William’s explanation. She had long wondered if William was part of the Crown Prince’s faction. If he was, he might be one of the people that the Prince had sent to capture her.

[ Switch with me. The fight is over. It is now time for negotiations. ]

Princess Sidonie, who had kept quiet within their Sea of Consciousness, had finally decided to interfere.

Morgana reluctantly agreed to Princess Sidonie’s suggestion and swapped consciousness with her. Just like before, William had noticed the subtle changes in the Princess’ aura. However, he didn’t say anything and simply waited for the Princess to continue the conversation.

“How can I believe that you are not one of the members of The Organization?” Princess Sidonie asked. “How can you prove that you’re not one of the Crown Prince’s subordinates?”

William pondered for a while as he thought of a good way to prove that he wasn’t working for The Organization nor the Crown Prince. Although it was possible for him to easily subdue the Princess, he didn’t have any intention to antagonize her.

Their meeting was a complete accident, and William didn’t want to part with her on bad terms. Right now, he was in need of allies and Princess Sidonies’ ability to control the Ants would prove to be very useful in the battles that were yet to come.

After thinking long and hard, William decided to take a chance as he looked at the angelic beauty in front of him.

“Do you perhaps know of Lady Eros?” William inquired. “I am one of the people to whom she has given her blessing. This is why your Charm doesn’t work on me.”

Princess Sidonie and Morgana flinched at the same time when they heard William speak their Patron God’s name. No one, not even their parents, nor their slaves, knew that the Goddess they served was the Goddess of Lust.

There were many people that had the power to Charm others, so Princess Sidonie’s case was not extremely rare. However, one thing was certain. In the world of Hestia, only the Princess of Freesia was a member of the Seven Deadly Sins that represented the Sin of Lust.
