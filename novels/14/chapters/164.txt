Chapter 164: Can’t Friends Hold Hands?

William cursed internally and hurriedly called out the system for an explanation.

‘System! What is the meaning of this?!’

[ Host, I don’t understand your question. Can you please clarify? ]

‘I’m talking about this new title I acquired!’ William’s face darkened as he talked to the system. ‘What’s the meaning of this Friendzoned?!’

[ … Host, do you not understand something as simple as this? You just got Friendzoned. ]

‘@%#$%#&^#*&!’ William cursed at the system. ‘Excuse me? I didn’t get Friendzoned! I was the one confessed to and the one who told her to become friends! Are you blind?!’

[ Then host, tell me, what is your relationship with Wendy right now? ]

‘We’re friends!’

[ See? You just got Friendzoned. ]

‘What kind of logic is this?!’ William roared. ‘Hello? I demand a title revision! Change the title. At least change it to something more fitting!’

[ Sorry. I am unable to process the Host’s request. It is not within my authority to bypass the awarding of Special Titles. ]

‘T-Then who should I talk to? I can’t accept this!’

[ Just give it up host. A special title is not easy to acquire. You should be happy to acquire such a rare and powerful title. If you equip this title, the power of friendship will multiply!’

‘Fck you and the power of friendship!’ William’s body was shaking out of anger and shame.

Wendy thought that she had said something wrong because William was acting strangely. She then became teary-eyed thinking that it was her fault.

[ Host! Hold your temper! You are scaring the young lady! ]

‘I’ll deal with you later. You’d better wash your neck!’

William took a few deep breaths in order to calm himself. When he regained his calm, he looked at Wendy apologetically.

“I’m sorry, I have an ailment that appears from time to time,” William explained as he coaxed the teary-eyed girl. “It’s not your fault. It is something that has followed me since I was born.”

“A congenital illness?”

“Yes. something like that. I’m sorry, did I scare you?”

“A little bit.” Wendy wasn’t the type to lie so she said her feelings upfront.

“Then how about I make it up to you?” William smiled. “You can order me to do one thing. However, this order mustn’t harm anyone physically, emotionally, and spiritually. As long as it is within my ability, I will do it.’

“Really? I can give you any order?”

“Yes. as long as you don’t command me to hurt other people, and it is within my ability, I will do it.”

“Okay,” Wendy smiled. “T-Tomorrow, let’s have lunch together.”

“Deal.” William nodded his head.

“Then, I’ll wait for you at the gates of the Magic Division Class.”

“Don’t worry, I’ll be there. Ah, can I also bring Mama Ella with me?”

“Of course,” Wendy agreed.

The two left the secret place holding hand in hand because Wendy didn’t want to let go of William’s hand.

As the two walked towards the gate of the Magic Division, three figures appeared to block their way.

“It seems that Head Prefect William likes to sneak around the Magic Division,” Est said with a smile. However, his eyes were locked on Wendy’s hand that was holding onto William’s.

Seeing Est’s gaze, Wendy immediately let go of William’s hand in embarrassment. A blush appeared on her face as she hid behind William like a child that had done something wrong.

“Hoh~ what’s this?” Ian asked. “Is Head Prefect William planning to ‘poach’ the talents of our Magic Division? You sure have guts.”

William lightly coughed as he looked at Est and Ian who seemed like they wanted to want to eat him alive.

“Um, about this, I can explain,” William replied. “I was randomly walking without a destination in mind and suddenly found myself inside the Magic Division. Wendy saw me and she decided to take me for a stroll inside the Magic Division.”

“I see, a stroll.” Est nodded his head. “Then where did the two of you go? I was immediately notified when you came to the Magic Division, but when I came to find you, you were nowhere to be found.”

Ian wasn’t willing to let the matter drop either, so he fanned the flames while sneering at William. “We asked around, but none of the students had seen you and Wendy. Where did the two of you go? Are you perhaps doing something ‘inappropriate’ inside our Magic Division?’

William frowned. He could tell that Est and Ian were upset, and he assumed that it was due to the fact that they didn’t find him when they came out to look for him. The red-headed boy knew that he couldn’t tell them about Wendy’s secret place, so he decided to speak half truths.

“Wendy and I went to the garden to talk,” William explained. “I told her about Lont and the things that happened during my childhood.”

“Is that so?” Est narrowed his eyes. “Then why were the two of you holding hands?”

“Can’t friends hold hands?” William chuckled as he moved forward and held Est’s hand. “See, if you want, I can hold your hand anytime you want.”

Est looked at the boy’s hand, holding his own, and his anger subsided a bit. Even so, he felt that something wasn’t right, so he didn’t let him go completely. He gave an eye signal to Ian and the latter nodded his head in understanding.

“Wendy, as officers of the Magic Division, it is our duty to ensure the safety of our members,” Ian stated. “Although Head Prefect William is our friend, he is still from the Martial Class Division. Can you tell us what the two of you talked about? Did he perhaps inquire about the secrets of our Magic Division Class?”

“No! Will didn’t ask me anything related to the Magic Division Class,” Wendy answered. “It was me who asked him questions and not the other way around.”

“Will?” Ian gave William a side-long glance. “Since when did the two of you get close?”

Ian wasn’t stupid. He clearly remembered that Wendy referred to William as Head Prefect William or Sir William. The sudden intimacy between the two alarmed him.

Est also frowned when he heard Wendy’s words. He looked at William as if he was looking at his husband whom he personally caught cheating on him.

William sighed as he scratched his head. “What’s wrong with that? Didn’t I also ask you guys to call me Will? Even though I already told you to call me by that name, you still call me William. This makes me very sad.”

William was getting confused because Est and Ian were really acting quite strangely. He didn’t want to make things difficult for Wendy so he decided to leave before things escalated any further.

“I’ll be going now,” William announced. “Wendy, I’m looking forward to having lunch with you tomorrow.”

“Un! See you tomorrow, Will,” Wendy waved her hand. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“See you tomorrow,” WIlliam waved back and left the Magic Division in haste. He felt that if he stayed a minute longer, something terrible would happen.

After William disappeared from their sights, Est and Ian decided to have a “friendly” talk with Wendy and make her spill the beans.

“Where did you go?” Kenneth asked the moment William entered their dormitory room. He then sniffed the air and gave William a weird look. “Did you meet up with a girl?”

“Yes,” William replied as he sat down on his bed and hugged his Mama Ella. “I somehow ended up in the Magic Division and met Wendy.”

“I see.” Kenneth didn’t inquire any further and lay on the bed to sleep. “Goodnight.”

“Goodnight.” William kissed the side of Ella’s face before laying down on the bed. The Angorian Goat also laid down beside William and closed her eyes to sleep.

She didn’t need to question her baby where he went or who he met. For her it wasn’t important. What was important was that William was safe and he was by her side.

It didn’t take long for William to fall asleep. His heart to heart talk with Wendy had helped him get over the haze that had clouded his mind. Although he was still feeling guilty in regards to his Master, Celine, this was a matter that he couldn’t do anything about at this point in time.

William had vowed to have a heart to heart talk with Celine and apologize for the ill feelings that he had kept inside his heart during the first weeks of his training. He was not a Saint. He felt betrayed when Celine forced him to become her slave without his consent.

Even though it worked out in the end, the lingering negative feelings had buried themselves deep within his heart. Although William had buried these feelings until the time came that he could pay her back, these feelings had resurfaced to connect to the new feelings he felt when he heard Celine’s tale from Simon.

He knew that he and Celine needed to sit down and have a talk. As Master and Disciple, some things must be made clear with each other. William firmly believed this and he hoped that he, and his Master, Celine, would be able to form a “True” Master and Disciple relationship that would stand the test of time.
