Chapter 22: The Power Of The Elements

“Disciple of Thunder…,” William muttered. ‘A Prestige Class? Is it different from the other job classes? I need to reach Job level 40 on two separate job classes to unlock this job class…’

At first, William was confused, but it only lasted for a brief moment. His confusion was replaced with excitement as the hands that held Stormcaller trembled in excitement.

When James heard William mutter the words “Disciple of Thunder”, his heart skipped a beat. This was a secret that was passed down through their family lineage, and only those who held the bloodline of the Ainsworth Family knew of Stormcaller’s importance.

“H-how is it?” James asked. His voice was shaking in fear and excitement.

William took a few deep breaths in order to calm himself. He then looked at his grandfather with sparkling eyes as if he found a wonderful toy.

“Those who are able to wield this spear will be able to gain a profession called ‘Disciple of Thunder’,” William answered honestly. “However, I am unable to learn this profession for the time being.”

“For the time being?” Mordred inquired. “Meaning, you can learn it in the future?”

“Yes.” William admitted. “At most, I need two to three years in order to reach the minimum requirements.”

“Only two to three years? That’s good.” James clenched his fist as a big grin appeared on his face. “Then, from now on, this spear is yours!”

“Really?!” William gasped. “Thank you, Grandpa!”

“Hahaha!” James patted William’s shoulder. “There’s no need to thank me. However, there is something important that I must tell you. Please, sit down.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

William obeyed and sat on the couch. James sat beside him and looked at his grandson with a complicated gaze.

“Let me tell you something about the power of elements,” James said after organizing his thoughts.

“Power of elements?” William asked.

“Yes.” James nodded his head. “You can ask me questions later. Let me finish my explanation first.”

William sat properly and stared at his grandpa with a serious expression. Seeing his grandson’s countenance, James wasn’t able to nod his head in approval. He then cleared his throat to begin his explanation.

“Among the power of the elements, the most common one is fire,” James explained. “Almost all magicians are able to wield this element. Even those who didn’t have an affinity to the fire element can wield it to a certain extent. Of course, there are also magicians who can only use the element that they have an affinity with.”

“Long story short, the most common element that a magician can use is fire. The second one is Earth. Those who are able to use the Earth Element are sought after by many people. Why? Because it allows them to build things.”

James paused to allow William to understand his lecture. “Castle walls, bridges, houses, and other structures can be made using the power of the Earth. It is also a very stable Element that is mostly used for defense. Among all the elements, Earth is the sturdiest of them all.”

“Then we have Wind. This element is mostly used by the elves. You can even say that every elf was born with an affinity for the Wind Element. Of course, some of them were also blessed with Life and Light magic, but we will talk about that at a later time.”

“Wind can be gentle as a breeze and be sharp as a blade. It allows those who wield it the power of flight. Of course, if you reach a certain level of expertise, you will also be able to fly freely in the sky.”

“The next is water. Water is the element of life. Just like the air we breathe, we need it in order to live. This element can be as peaceful as a still lake, or as violent as a tsunami. If you meet anyone with an affinity to water magic, you’d better treat them kindly.”

“They are the most supportive friends, and the most viscous of enemies. If you can’t befriend them, make sure that you don’t offend them.” James chuckled. “Your grandma is a sage that specializes in Water Magic. She’s the most wonderful woman I have met in my life.”

James’ lips trembled when he remembered his late wife. William could see the change in his grandpa’s expression, so he held the old man’s hands to give him his support.

“Don’t worry. She’s now in a better place and watching over us,” James smiled then continued his explanation. “All the other existing elements in the world, branch out from the four basic elements of Fire, Earth, Wind, and Water.”

“Naturally there are exceptions to this rule which include Space, Time, Light, and Darkness magic. Ice magic is a branch of water magic. Some powers are made from the combination of two or more elements. However, among these, there is one special element that stands above all and that is… Lightning Magic.”

“A magic that stands above all?” William asked. “Don’t tell me…”

James smirked. “Lightning magic was said to be the power wielded by heroes. Anyone who was able to learn this magic would be sought out by the powers in the continent and raised with the utmost care. Naturally, there are also factions who hate these so-called heroes and among them is the Demon Race.”

“After all, the first heroes were summoned in order to defeat the Demon Lords who terrorized the land, more than a few thousand years ago. Of course, the most famous of them all was none other than our ancestor, Claude Von Ainsworth.

With Stormcaller in his hand, he called out the Heavenly Lightning to purify the land from the corruption of the Demon Race.”

“Since then, the demons had gone above and beyond to assassinate anyone who wields the lightning element. So, you little brat, make sure to not use this power lightly. The moment this power was brought to light, will be the same moment that your life will change forever. Remember this and remember it well!”

“I understand.” William nodded his head. “Grandpa, I will not use this power lightly.”

“As long as you understand then it’s good.” James patted the boy’s head. “The ring on your necklace is also a storage ring. You can store our family’s heirloom inside it, but you have to promise me that you will keep it safe.”

“I promise, Grandpa,” William patted his chest. “As long as I’m alive, no one will be able to touch our family’s priceless treasure.”
