Chapter 429: Choices Were Millions Of Lives Were At Stake

“Senior, why don’t you stay a little while longer?” Princess Eowyn said.

Kenneth shook his head. “I am worried about him, so I’m going back to the Hellan Kingdom to find his whereabouts. I only came here to tell you of his existence so that when you meet him on the battlefield, you will keep the Elves from harming him.”

“I give you my word that I will do everything in my power to safeguard his life. After all, he is Teacher’s only son.”

“Good. I can rest easy knowing that you’ll be keeping a lookout for him. Stay safe, Eowyn. Let’s meet again when Fate wills it.”

Kenneth waved his hand and a magic circle appeared on the ground beside him. A three-meter tall black fox with four tails appeared by his side. On its forehead was a silver crescent moon that glowed faintly.

“Let’s go, Luna,” Kenneth said after he mounted his Beast Companion. “To the Hellan Kingdom.”

The Black Fox nodded its head and began to float in the air. Soon, it rose towards the sky and flew in the direction of the Hellan Kingdom.

Princess Eowyn sighed as the Flying Black Fox disappeared from her view. The story that Kenneth had told her about her Teacher’s son was like the stories in fairy tales about heroes saving the damsel in distress from the hands of the evil tyrant.

It made her remember the stories of the Human Hero that protected their lands against the Demon Race’s invasion. She wasn’t able to stop herself from thinking of what the boy would feel if the Elven Race were to invade his Kingdom.

Would he feel betrayed?

Would he feel anger?

Princess Eowyn didn’t know the answers to these questions. In fact, the mere thought of facing William on the battlefield made her feel guilty.

‘Teacher, I’m sorry, but I am powerless to stop this conquest of the Human lands,’ Princess Eowyn grieved in her heart. She loved and respected Lady Arwen, just as much as she loved and respected her own mother. This was why she was feeling very guilty at the thought of invading the kingdom of the Hero that saved their lands.

Still, she was merely an observer. The one who called the shots of the operation was Elandorr. This was the will of the Patriarchs of the Elven Clans who wanted to stand up against Human tyranny.

Of course, not all the Elven Clans had this thought. The other factions didn’t like the idea of invading the Human lands, but they were ignored by the Patriarchs of the Saleh, Nasir, Rhys, and Eroan Clans.

These four ancient clans had resented Humans for thousands of years, and were the most vocal among the others when it came to having an aggressive stance against those who were not part of their race.

Some of the Elders call them the Pureblood fanatics. They advocated that their bloodlines should be preserved and not stained by the vile blood of other races.

This expedition was a closely guarded secret by these clans. However, they still decided to involve the Royal Family, so that the Elven Council wouldn’t punish them severely for their unauthorized conquest of Human lands.

The King of the Elves reluctantly agreed to have his daughter, Princess Eowyn, accompany the Elven Fleet as its Supervisor. He thought that this was a good opportunity for the Princess to experience war and the consequences that would come out of it.

‘Don’t worry, Teacher. I will do my best to ensure his life,” Princess Eowyn vowed. “I will also bring him back to the Silvermoon Continent, so that the two of you can reunite.”

Princess Eowyn had seen the sadness on Lady Arwen’s face whenever the Saintess looked at the World Tree. One of the Elven Princess’ goals in life was to do something for her teacher. Thinking that Lady Arwen would be happy to be reunited with her son, Princess Eowyn’s determination to bring William back to the Silvermoon Continent intensified.

She sincerely believed that once William and his mother had been reunited, everything would work out in the end.

‘I better discuss this matter with Commander Elandorr,’ Princess Eowyn thought. ‘No matter what happens, Teacher’s child must be secured at all costs.’

Meanwhile in the Anaesha Dynasty…

Empress Sidonie sat on the throne as she listened to the reports of the officers of the Kraetor Army. The conquest of the Anaesha Dynasty was very smooth because the Guardian Beast personally helped them repel the members of The Organization.

The Anaeshaians had complete faith in their Guardian Deity. Since the Ant Queen had acknowledged Princess Sidonie to be their new ruler, all of them reluctantly accepted it. The Kraetor Army decided that it was a good opportunity to hold a grand coronation ceremony to officially declare Princess Sidonie the new Empress of the Land.

The moment the survivors saw their new Empress, all of them instantly fell in love with her. Empress Sidonie had unleashed the full power of her Charm and made the citizens, who were in the Capital, her loyal subjects.

Prince Jason looked at this scene with awe. Although he could use violence and intimidation to make the citizens submit, they would still hold grudges in their hearts. However, his Cousin’s methods were fool proof, which allowed the smooth transition of authority to pass into her hands.

“Your Majesty, the citizens are very happy because they no longer lack food to eat,” one of the Ministers reported. “We are getting an influx of volunteers that were willing to join the relief efforts and travel to the outskirts of the Dynasty to help their countrymen. Also, they are more than happy to spread Her Majesty’s benevolence to the subjects that still haven’t gained the opportunity to swear their fealty to you.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Empress Sidonie nodded her head. “Thank you for the report, Minister. I hope that everyone will do their best to ensure that none of my citizens suffer from starvation. Also, see to it that all of their needs are met.”

“I hear and obey, your Majesty!”

“”We hear and obey, your Majesty!””

Empress Sidonie looked at the heirs of the nobles of the Anaesha Dynasty and smiled. All of them had fallen completely under her Charm. Even the members of the Royal Family were now bowing to her as if they were mere commoners in the face of their liege.

Two Sword Saints and one Grand Archmage stood a few steps away from her throne. They were her personal guards that Emperor Leonidas had personally arranged beforehand.

These three men were, also, in awe of their Emperors’s Granddaughter and felt that their plan to take over the entire Southern Continent was well within their grasp.

They had no doubt in their minds that in the face of Empress Sidonie’s beauty, intellect, and charm, no man, or woman, would be able to resist kneeling and bowing their heads in submission.

‘I wonder what you’re doing right now, Sir William?’ Empress Sidonie thought with a smile. ‘I sure hope that you think of me from time to time.’

[Don’t worry, Sidonie. Give it a month or two and Darling will have no choice but to think of us constantly. For now, you know what to do, right? ]

‘Of course,’ Empress Sidonie smiled sweetly. ‘All is fair in love and war.’

Morgana smirked from inside their shared Mindscape. The plan that they had concocted together for their beloved Prince was currently in motion. Both of them looked forward to the choices that William was going to make.

Choices where millions of lives were at stake.
