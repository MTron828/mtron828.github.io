Chapter 453: Dungeon Upgrade

William’s and Conner’s meeting ended, but no promises were made between the two. The Leader of Deus asked for a day to think things through and William agreed. Their talks would resume at noon the next day in the same conference room of the Solaris Dormitory.

An hour after Conner left the Royal Academy, William showed Celine some of his secrets, and they were none other than the Thousand Beast Domain and the Dungeon of Atlantis.

William had a smug expression on his face when he saw Celine’s usually calm expression crumble after seeing the Domain and Dungeon that were available to him.

“H-How?” Celine asked as she stared at William.

Her stare was so intense that William had a feeling that the beautiful Elf was fighting the urge to dissect him, to see what other secrets he was hiding from her.

“Master, isn’t it obvious?” William replied as he raised his chin in arrogance. “It’s because I am so handsome, and so awesome, that I always have fruitful encounters. Don’t be surprised if I suddenly acquired a Divine Artifact or Weapon in the future.”

Just as William was boasting, a rainbow-colored Anteater walked past him.

Celine’s gaze immediately landed on the adorable and unique creature that had fought beside her in the underground cavern.

“I want this,” Celine said as she picked up the Demigod who was minding its own business. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Kasogonaga glared at the beautiful Elf in front of him in annoyance. The only reason why it didn’t attack Celine was because she was William’s Master. If any other Elf had picked it up, it would have already rolled into a ball and smashed their face without showing a shred of mercy.

“Unhand me, Woman!” Kasogonaga shouted. “I am a Demigod. You dare treat me like some kind of toy?!”

Celine’s eyes sparkled when she heard that the adorable anteater was a Demigod. She thought that Kasogonaga was just a Rare Beast that William had picked up along the way.

“You are a Demigod?”

“Yes! Now, unhand me, Woman!”

Celine looked at William with a serious expression. Even without saying anything, the Half-Elf could understand what his Master was trying to tell him.

“Sorry, Master,” William said as he shook his head. “Kasogonaga is not a pet. Also, he is not my subordinate. He is my special guest.”

“That’s right!” Kasogonaga said as it wriggled its body to get away from Celine who was holding it in a vice grip. “Hey! Let me go!”

Celine clicked her tongue as she reluctantly put the rainbow-colored Anteater on the ground. Kasogonaga gave her a hateful glare before walking away to join the others in clearing the Twenty-Second Floor of the Atlantis Dungeon.

The Dungeon Monsters that were located on this floor consisted of Nagas. They were serpentine hybrids that were similar to demihumans.

All of them were Class C (Low) Monsters and were proving to be a worthy challenge for most of the members of William’s Herd and Legion.

Scadrez, the Blood Eagle, gave a mighty shriek as it descended from the sky. It unleashed crimson wind blades at the Naga that it was fighting, slicing it to pieces.

The Naga wasn’t able to offer much resistance because the Blood Eagle’s rank was now Class B (Mid).

Scadrez landed on the ground and happily ate its prey. It was a Beast similar to the Blood Wyvern that was able to strengthen itself, and gain new abilities, by eating monsters.

William glanced at the Blood Eagle in the distance. If he had more God Points, he would have purchased more Hyperion Trees and created a squad of Blood Eagles that would serve as William’s Elite Air Units.

Celine was very interested in the Thousand Beast Domain and the Dungeon of Atlantis. Because of this, she flatly told William that she would be staying in his Villa for the time being.

William was about to agree when he suddenly remembered that his Villa was now his personal “Love Nest”. He would spend the nights there with his lovers, and it would be awkward if Celine did some experiments inside it.

Because of this, He immediately asked the system to buy a spacious residence with a make-shift laboratory in it for Celine.

God Points: 642

The System bought a residence with a built-in laboratory for 50 God Points and placed it near the Villa. It was close enough for Celine to visit William, but far enough to give both of them privacy.

Celine was surprised when she saw the residence that hadn’t been there when she toured the Thousand Beast Domain with William. She eyed her Disciple, who was looking back at her with the “I’m so awesome” expression, and decided to not ask him anything.

The beautiful elf had many secrets of her own, so she wouldn’t force William to tell her things that he didn’t want to tell her.

“Thank you for this comfortable residence,” Celine said with a smile. “I’ll be staying with you for the time being since I have nothing to do in Lont. In return, I will help clear the Atlantis Dungeon and use the monster body parts in my experiments.”

“Thank you, Master,” William replied. “Having you here will put me at ease.”

William was quite happy that Celine chose to stay with him for the time being. Having her around would help greatly as the work of clearing the Dungeon continued. It would also give him the opportunity to ask her certain things when it came to alchemy.

Celine liked to do research and experiment on things, which was what William was currently doing. He hoped that with his Master’s wisdom, he would be able to make the things that he was unable to make-like the powerful acid that would be strong enough to melt armor made from precious metals.

William parted with Celine for the time being because there were a few things that he needed to handle as well.

-

Dungeon Points: 158,865

The last battle against the Elves had killed hundreds of Goblins. Although the Goblin Crypt could spawn more of them, William felt that he shouldn’t treat the Goblin Army as Cannon Fodders.

Currently, the leader of the Goblin Army was none other than the Hobgoblin Witch Doctor whom WIlliam nicknamed as Xerxes. His assistant was the Hobgoblin Chieftain whom William called Rex.

Together, they were the two leaders that led the Goblins to battle. William had already tweaked the Goblin Crypt and stopped the production of low-tiered Goblins.

He replaced them with stronger Goblins that would become the main bulk of his army. William had also increased the numbers for:

Hobgoblin Hunters

Hobgoblin Warriors

Hobgoblin Berserkers

Hobgoblin Leaders

Hobgoblin Shamans

He purchased more floors and placed the prison that held the Elves on the Forty-Fifth Floor. William was surprised when he found out that he had gained a lot of points after killing many of Elven Prodigies in the battle to destroy the teleportation gates.

This allowed the Half-Elf to add more floors to the Goblin Crypt and give it another special upgrade. Originally, the Thirty-First floor and above only spawned Danderous Goblin Dogs. Now, William changed the Dungeon’s setting and made the new floors spawn Scavenger Goblin Dogs.

These were the evolved form of the Danderous Goblin Dog, and were powerful Class B (Low) Monsters that would now serve as the mount of his Goblin Army. William increased their production rate to ensure that every member of the Goblin Army would have a mount of their own.

Although he had already prepared himself for losses in this war, he wouldn’t let his Goblin Army serve as cannon fodders. He would ensure that they would be properly equipped so that they would be able to terrorize his enemies the next time they met on the battlefield.
