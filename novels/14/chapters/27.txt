Chapter 27: Wolf Tide [Part 3]

“Meeeeeeh!” Ella charged in fury as it knocked off the Dire Wolf that was about to sink its fangs on one of her subordinates. Only two minutes had passed since the battle started and there were only eighteen goats remaining in their formation.

Taking the lead, Ella led the other goats in a mad charge that cut through the wolves with a vengeance. Their target was the three-meter tall Grey Wolf that stood at the center of the pack.

The Alpha Wolf growled and rallied the wolves to clash with the approaching goats. The clash was brutal as five more goats lost their lives in exchange for the death of the Alpha Wolf.

This was the third Alpha Wolf that Ella had killed. Each Alpha wolf commanded forty to fifty Dire Wolves each. In order to destroy their chain of command, Ella decided to make these wolves her priority.

Her white coat had long been painted with blood. William didn’t know whether the blood came from the wolves or Ella’s body. All he knew was that his Mama had now fallen into a berserk state.

Perhaps it was due to the smell of blood in the air, or the death of her subordinates, but the Leader of the Herd was now out for blood.

Even the Dire Wolves who had initially thought that they had found prey avoided her like a plague. After losing the Alpha Wolves, the wolves’ formation was in disarray. They no longer wanted to fight the crazed goat and her minions.

Instead, they ran after the fleeing sheep in the distance. It was at that moment when Ella had recovered from her berserk state and came to her senses.

Ella bleated and the thirteen remaining goats rallied by her side. Their legs were trembling due to exhaustion, but the fire in their eyes was still burning. William knew that if Ella gave them the order, these goats would charge without fear for their lives and execute her command.

Fortunately, Ella didn’t do that. After experiencing the battles in the Goblin Crypt, its intelligence had grown by leap and bounds. Although the current Ella wasn’t as smart as a human, she was not that far off.

‘Thank the Gods.’ William sighed in relief. He didn’t want Ella to fight the Dire Wolves to the death.

The boy looked at the wolves who were now targeting the sheeps and tried to count their numbers. According to his estimation, the wolves were still around four hundred strong.

The only saving grace was that they had left Ella and the other goats alone. They deemed the weak-willed sheep as a safer target. Ella wanted to run after them, but she prioritized the members of her herd.

She had already sacrificed many members of her family in order to hold the dire wolves at bay for a few minutes. As the leader of the herd, she deemed that her subordinates’ had reached their limits and were no longer able to battle.

Since that was the case, she only ordered them to be alert and hold their position. Hundreds of wolf corpses littered the battlefield as Ella and the remaining goats stood their ground. As part of William’s herd, they also learned the skills Steel Armament, Quick Attack, and Horn Assault.

Because of these skills, they were able to overpower their foes and crush them under their hooves.

163,240 experience points.

This was the amount of experience points that Ella and her subordinates had gained during their fifteen-minute battle against the Dire Wolf Pack. All the goats in Ella’s party were now level 18. In short, they were no longer the meek and naive goats that used to graze lazily in the pastures.

One of them was more than enough to beat three Dire Wolves in a three on one battle! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The helpless cry of sheep being slaughtered reached William’s ears. Unlike his goats who received his buffs and skills, the sheeps were truly domestic animals. In the face of the Hundreds of Dire Wolves, the only thing they could do was cry in panic and be eaten alive.

More than two hundred sheep fell prey to the wolf tide, while the remaining animals scattered in different directions.

In the middle of the wolves’ feeding frenzy, William saw four familiar figures running towards the wolf pack from the direction of the town.

‘Isn’t that Mr. Shawn?’ William thought. ‘What is he doing here?’

A man holding a rolling pin in his hands, fearlessly ran towards the wolf pack. He was the baker of Lont, and went by the name Shawn. William usually visited his store once a week to buy a loaf of bread before going to the valley.

Shawn was a very kind and warm person. Just like everyone in Lont, he had a carefree personality and always wore a smile on his face.

However, right now, the town’s baker was not smiling. The rolling pin in his hand enlarged and transformed into a two-meter-long silver rolling pin.

With a roar of fury, Shawn lunged at the feasting wolves and waved the rolling pin of death in a wide swing. The heads of the wolves that were on the path of his attack exploded like watermelons.

‘F*ck!’ William almost cursed out loud at the baker’s brutality. The four other people behind the baker also summoned their weapons and joined him in his slaughter.

Helen, who is often referred to as Auntie Helen by William, was their Ainsworth Family’s maid. Some of his clothes were sewn by her and all of them were of good quality.

Now, this same Auntie who had wiped William’s bum countless times when he was still a baby, was currently beheading wolves left and right just by waving her hand.

William could faintly see golden threads connected to his Auntie Helen’s fingers that sliced through the air like a flexible sword.

“Filthy mongrels,” Helen spat. “If my little William was hurt by you bastards, I swear that I will hunt down all the wolf packs in this kingdom!”

‘Auntie, don’t worry, I’m still alive!’ William couldn’t help but feel warm at his Aunt Helen’s concern for him. Seeing his Aunt Helen’s elegance in the battlefield, he generously gave her four thumbs up in his heart.

Everywhere Helen went, all the wolves would be cut into pieces.

The two other people who had also engaged the wolf pack were Lont Town’s Barber and Dentist.

The town’s barber, Mr. Bond had the most unique hairstyle in Lont. William often wondered if the barber was born with the natural Afro-Style hair. There were rumors in the town that he chose this hairstyle because he was too lazy to cut his own hair.

“Snippy, snip-snap,” Mr. Bond said as he threw six scissors in the air which pierced through the heads of the wolves charging towards him. “The name is Bond. Mr. Bond.”

A man wearing white shirt, and black pants jogged towards the wolves with a refreshing smile. He was Lont Town’s sole dentist and went by the name Jekyll.

William, and the rest of the children in Lont, had voted him to be the scariest person in town. Why? Because he was the dentist!

Had there been any child who was not afraid of the dentist? The answer is NO! Every child in Lont was afraid of him. The mere sight of him taking a stroll around town was enough to make anyone below the age of fifteen cry out in fear.

Even though he was handsome, looked prim and proper, and always had that dazzling smile on his face, there was no sane kid in Lont that would smile back at him.

Jekyll stopped in the middle of the wolf pack and placed his hands behind his back.

“Thank you for the meal.”

He then gave the wolves a refreshing smile before opening his mouth wide.

The scene that followed next gave William goosebumps.

All the wolves that were at least twenty meters around Jekyll were sucked up inside his mouth! A few seconds later, the dentist gave a loud burp which scared the Dire Wolves silly.

“Excuse me,” Jekyll said with a smile. “Don’t worry. I still have room for desserts.”
