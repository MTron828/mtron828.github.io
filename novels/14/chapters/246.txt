Chapter 246: The Wind May Blow, But The Ice Will Never Melt

Rowdy laughter and jest filled the air as the warriors of the tribe ate, drank, and laughed like this was their last day before going to the battlefield.

William’s group was allocated a table not far from the Great Chief’s, but far enough to tell them that they were not their priority.

On the Great Chief’s left and right sides, were tables of the representatives from the two Dynasties Anaesha and Zelan. On the Anaeshan side, there were four people that shared the table, with six guards standing behind their backs.

On the Zelan side, there were five people, with the same number of guards standing behind them.

“The guy wearing a red robe is the second prince of the Anaesha Dynasty, Aziel Sy Anaesha,” Sir Jerkins informed William, who was seated opposite him. “The one seated beside him is his half-sister, the second princess, Valeria Sy Anaesha. I don’t know who the two men who are seated beside them are, but I’m guessing that they are their protectors.”

William nodded his head in agreement. The Second Prince and Princess both had silky light-brown hair and were blessed with good looks. If they were brought back to Earth, both of them would be great endorsers of high-end fashion clothes for the rich and famous.

“Let’s not mix with them. Those two are Mithril Rank Fighters. How about the other side?”

Jerkins glanced at the other table and began to introduce them as well.

“The man wearing black clothes is the Crown Prince of the Zelan Dynasty,” Jerkins had a rare tinge of admiration in his voice as he introduced the devilish looking man to William. “His name is Prince Alaric Sol Zelan. I can’t believe that an important person like him actually came here to the Kyrintor Mountains.”

As the Crown Prince of a dynasty, Prince Alaric held great power and influence in their domain. For him to come to this place meant that it was of the utmost importance to their Dynasty.

“The beautiful lady seated beside him is the Third Princess, Princess Aila Sol Zelan. Although she’s only sixteen years old this year, she has many suitors in the Zelan Dynasty, but the King hasn’t found any of them worthy of his daughter. Perhaps she’s here to become… a bride.”

William observed the devilish looking Prince and angelic looking Princess from their table. Both of them had light-purple hair and eyes that made them stand out from the gathering. William was envious of their creamy white skin because it was a shade lighter than his.

After a short observation, he noticed that even though Princess Aila was smiling, her smile never reached her eyes. It even held a tinge of resignation as if she was someone who had surrendered herself to her fate.

‘A pitiful political tool,’ William thought. He then shifted his attention to the Crown Prince of the Zelan Dynasty. Perhaps it was coincidence, or perhaps it was Fate, but the Crown Prince also chose that time to look at William.

The two stared at each other for half a minute before giving each other a brief nod. Although that exchange didn’t last long, William didn’t feel any hostility from the Prince, which surprised him.

It was very different from the vibe of the Second Prince of the Anaesha Dynasty who blatantly showed his disdain for William’s group whenever his eyes glanced in their direction.

Unlike the Second Warrior of the Tribe, Connal, Aziel Sy Aenasha looked at Wendy and Amelia in a lecherous manner.

Aziel felt excited at the possibility of having his way with the two beauties, while the representatives of the Hellan Kingdom watched helplessly as he ravaged the girls in front of them.

‘Yep, this one is the true cannon fodder in this gathering,’ William mused internally. ‘I wonder if I’ll get some God Points if I beat him up.’

Lily: I donate 250 God Points.

Issei: 250 for me as well.

David: 250.

Gavin: Okay, 250 for me as well.

After the feast ended, Connal stood up and respectfully bowed to Princess Aziel. He then extended his hand in a gesture and waited for the beautiful young lady to place her hands over his.

Princess Aila smiled and held Connal’s hand. The Second Warrior held her small hand firmly, and gently pulled her close to him.

This rare act of gentleness from the Second Warrior earned him cheers and teasing remarks from the Warriors that were seated around the Great Hall.

“From this moment onwards, I declare Princess Aila as my main wife,” Connal said. Even though he tried his best to hide it, everyone could still feel the happiness hidden behind his declaration.

It seemed that the Second Warrior was really in love with the Princess and it showed in his eyes and actions.

“I am honored to be chosen as your main wife, Proud Warrior of the North,” Princess Aila replied. If she hated the fact that she had been forced by her father to marry Connal, she didn’t show it on her face.

“I propose a toast for this wonderful pairing!” Aziel, the second prince of the Anaesha Dynasty proposed. “May their union bring prosperity to the Southern Continent!”

Another round of cheers resounded all around them as the warriors gave Connal and Princess Aila their blessings.

Prince Aziel then walked towards the main table of the Great Chief and stopped in front of Brianna.

“Although you’re only eleven years old this year, I am looking forward to your growth, My Lady,” Prince Aziel said with a smile. “I am very happy to have you as my future bride.”

“Huh?” Brianna widened her eyes in shock. She then glanced at her Father in confusion.

Her father, Liam, drank wine from his goblet with a determined expression. He didn’t even look at his own daughter and pretended that he was not aware of her stare. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Brianna felt her heart grow cold as she stared at her grandfather. Great Chief Evander was different from his son and faced his granddaughter’s gaze with a smile.

“Brianna, the Second Prince of Anaesha has decided to make you his second wife,” Great Chief Evander said. “I’m sure that you will be happy in the Anaesha Dynasty. Isn’t that right, Prince Aziel?”

“Of course, Great Chieftain. I promise that I will take good care of your granddaughter. I will ensure that she grows up as a proper lady.”

“Good.”

Brianna lowered her head and clenched her fists under the table. Her father and grandfather hadn’t told her anything about this marriage agreement. No, they hadn’t told her because they knew that she wouldn’t agree to it.

Princess Aila, who was seated not far from the young girl, looked at her in a calm manner. Deep inside, she pitied Brianna. She could see herself as the youngest granddaughter of the Great Chief. Both of them were in the same position.

Both of them were just tools used for political gains between the powerful factions in the Southern Continent.

They were the sacrifices that were needed to seal the Tri-Party alliance between the Northern Tribes, and the two Dynasties, which will attack the Hellan Kingdom on all fronts.

Prince Aziel extended his hand to grab Brianna’s small hands, in order to drag her to his own table. However, before the Prince could even touch his “bride’s” hand, another hand held his in a firm manner.

Prince Aziel flinched because the hand that held his own was very rough and one could tell that it was not the hands of a noble.

The Prince turned his head to look at the fool who dared to get in his way. There he found a Half-Elf that had red hair akin to flames, who was looking at him with clear, light-green, eyes that were as beautiful as sapphires.

“I’m sorry, but I fell in love with Lady Brianna the moment I saw her,” William lied with a straight face. “I was planning to ask the Great Chieftain to make her my fiance, but I never thought that she was already betrothed to another.”

Prince Aziel snorted as he glared at the annoying Half-Elf in front of him. If someone had dared to grab his hand without his permission in the Aenasha Dynasty, that person’s hand would have been cut off, and his body whipped a thousand times over.

He laughed in anger as he tightened his grip on William’s hand. Prince Aziel had every intention of breaking the offender’s hand to teach him a lesson.

“Since you already know that the Young Lady is betrothed to me then why are you getting in my way?” Prince Aziel asked. “Know your place, and go back to where you belong, Hellanian!”

William chuckled as if what Prince Aziel was saying was complete and utter nonsense. “You ask me why I am getting in your way? You’re not very smart are you, Second Prince of the Aenasha Dynasty.”

William raised his chin in an arrogant manner and acted like a First-Rate Antagonist. “I came here for one reason, and one reason only, and that is to ‘snatch’ this beauty from your hands. Like I said, I fell in love with her and I’m not planning to hand her to anyone. Not to you, nor any other man in this great hall.”

The hall quieted down as the warriors looked at William with a grim expression. Their hands moved towards the handles of their weapons. They were only waiting for their Great Chief’s order to hack the arrogant Half-Elf to pieces.

Great Chief Evander was about to say something, but William didn’t give him that opportunity.

“I challenge you, Aziel Sy Anaesha, for the hand of Lady Briana,” William declared. “I issue this challenge in adherence to the laws of the Third Peak of Chivalry. I call upon the Sovereign of the Kyrintor Mountains to bear witness to this challenge.”

William then strengthened his grip on the Second Prince’s hand which made the latter wince in pain. After seeing the Prince’s reaction, William released his hand and faced Great Chief Evander.

“The Wind may blow, but the Ice will never melt,” William said as he ignored the pained expression of the Second Prince and faced Great Chief Evander fearlessly. “Isn’t that right, Great Chief of the Northern Tribes?”
